# Volleyball captures NCAA title
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Though Washington had received
the conference's highest seeding at
seventh, three teams from the Pac-10
reached the Final Four in Long
Beach, Calif., in what had been called
a "down year" on the West Coast.
Senior Ogonna Nnamani outdid
herself in the Regional finals in
Green Bay, swatting 28 kills against
Texas and 27 against Wisconsin,
while averaging almost 10 kills per
game, well above her season average.
In Long Beach, she continued to
lead the way with 33 kills as Stanford
advanced to the national champi
onship match with a 3-1 victory over
Washington, the Cardinal's second
win over the Huskies this season and
only Washington's third loss overall.
Minnesota also posted a 3-1 victo
ry, overpowering a surprisingly slug
gish USC team to set up the final
match-up.
It was clear early on that the Gold
en Gophers would be no match fora
determined and energetic Stanford
squad. The Cardinal had not lost in a
month and a half and were not going
to allow that streak to end in the most
important match of the season.
Helped by some of Nnamani's
best hitting of the season and several
strong supporting performances, the
Cardinal became national champions
with a 30-23, 30-27, 30-21 sweep of
Minnesota.
Nnamani made only two hitting
errors in the match, the first of which
did not come until the middle of game
two. Only one tip into the net and an
other tip that was blocked marred a
29-kill performance. Hitting at a .562
clip, she added four digs and a power

ful block.
Nnamani was named Most Out
standing Player of the Tournament.
Joining her on the All-Tournament
team were fellow senior Jennifer
Hucke (nine kills, four assists, three
digs, two blocks), sophomore outside

hitter Kristin Richards (eight kills, 11
digs, three blocks), and freshman set
ter Bryn Kehoe (48 assists, 10 digs,
one ace, two blocks).
Kehoe became the first freshman
setter in NCAA history to lead her
team to a national championship.

The rest of the lineup also had
strong performances as sophomore
middle blocker Lizzie Suiter posted
six kills and five blocks and freshman
middle Franci Girard had five kills
and a block. Libero Courtney Schultz
had 14 digs to lead the team.
Minnesota had several offensive
contributors, with four players tally
ing at least nine kills. Setter Lindsay
Taatjes had five blocks and middle
Jessy Jones had four, but the Golden
Gophers could not stop Nnamani.
Libero Paula Gentil was tenacious
on defense with 15 digs, but went out
with a neck injury early in the third
game. With her on the bench, Min
nesota was even more powerless
against Stanford's big hitting.
What started out as a weak year
for Stanford ended with record-set
ting performances in every area. Nna
mani obliterated her own single-sea
son kills record on the Farm, finishing
with 823, a Pac-10 record and the sev
enth-highest total in NCAA history.
With 2,450 kills, she also broke the
Stanford and Pac-10 career records.
Her 145 kills and 15 solo blocks in the
postseason are both NCAA records.
Kristin Richards broke the single
season digs record on the Farm with
502. Lizzie Suiter's 198 total blocks
put her second in Stanford history and
sixth in the Pac-10 in a season. Bryn
Kehoe's 1,637 assists good fora
Stanford record as well.
The national championship match
marked the end of the collegiate ca
reers of three Cardinal players: Nna
mani, Hucke, and defensive specialist
Leahi Hall.
