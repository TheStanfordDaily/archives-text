# Women's tennis dominates at Pac-10s
## 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Call it a case of deja vu.
Call it a case of the No. 1 Stanford women's
tennis team (21-0, 12-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
doing what it does best: winning.
However you phrase it, the top-ranked Car
dinal propelled junior Alice Barnes to her sec
ond consecutive doubles victory this weekend at
the Pac-10 Individual Championships in Ojai,
Calif.
And not just any doubles victory. Last year,
Stanford chalked it up to surprising good luck
when Barnes teamed up with Erin Burdette for
the first time and emerged with a Pac-10 title.
But after reclaiming the title with an 8-1 vic
tory over Arizona's Dianne Hollands and Maja
Mlakar (27-9,8-2), Barnes reconsidered the role
luck played in her breakout victory with recent
partner sophomore Anne Yelsey.
"I think we gelled right from the start,"
Barnes said. "We were prepared to have a tough
start and take a little while to adjust to each
other's playing styles. But because we both play
what you'd call 'conventional doubles," we al
ready had a good understanding of each other's
movements and ball placement."
While Barnes and Yelsey had forged a
promising 4-0 record going into Sunday's match
at Libbey Park, Stanford's numbers paled in

comparison to No. 14 Mlakar and Hollands'
month-long, seven-match winning streak.
"I would say we were nervous, but we were
aware of how well they've been playing this
year," Barnes said.
Stanford's Whitney Deason, a freshman, and
sophomore Theresa Logar also entered the dou
bles tournament. The pair was leading Washing
ton's Saskia Nauenberg and Mugette Ahn in the
â€¢ first round, 6-5, when Deason had to retire due
to injury.
In singles, the Cardinal came up just short of
victory, as No. 22 Barnes let a final decision slip
through her fingers against Southern Califor
nia's No. 9 Nicole Leimbach, 5-7,6-0,6-3.
Barnes was also runner-up in the 2004 Pac-10
competition, deferring to California alumna
Raquel Kops Jones in straight sets.
While admitting that second place is nothing
to scoff at, the Cambridge, U.K., native ex
pressed disappointment over dropping the sin
gles title.
"With the way 1 was playing, I thought I
could have won that match," Barnes said. "1 sat
back a little too much and wasn't aggressive
enough in the second set."
Despite the final results, Stanford took a
hearty command of the 32-member singles field,
seeing all four of its contestants through to the
quarterfinals and three to semis, discounting
Deason's withdrawal.

In her quarterfinal match, Logar (26-4)
breezed past Arizona's top singles player. No. 33
Hollands, in a 6-2,6-2 showing.
Leimbach would get the best of Logar in a
see-sawing semifinal battle, 6-4,4-6,6-4.
Barnes (25-7) avenged three earlier losses to
the Trojans' No. 14 Lindsey Nelson in the quar
terfinals, recording a decisive 6-2,6-3 win.
Yelsey (24-6) notched wins against her two
highest-ranked opponents all season in the
quarterfinals and Round of 16. Usually compet
ing in the No. 5 singles slot for the team, Yelsey
rose to the occasion to outlast the Trojans' No.
79 Anca Anastasiu, 6-1,2-6,6-4.
Yelsey dropped Oregon's top singles player.
No. 48 Daria Panova, in the previous round, 7-6,
6-3.
Barnes recognized the importance of indi
vidual results in a tournament often viewed as
"low-key" by Stanford head coach Lele Forood
and assistant coach Frankie Brennan.
"The coaches aren't worried so much about
our individual results at this point in the season,
but for the players, it can be a tense time,"
Barnes said. "If you're playing opponents who
are placed lower than you in the regular singles
lineup, you don't want to take losses in those
opening rounds.
