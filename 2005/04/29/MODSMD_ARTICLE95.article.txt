### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Double team titles. Double indi
vidual titles.
This is becoming routine for the
Stanford cross country teams.
On Saturday, the top-ranked
women's team and the No. 2 men's
squad raced to victory once again at
West Regionals in Fresno, Calif, at
Woodward Park. Leading the Cardi
nal to victory, seniors Alicia Craig
and Ryan Hall placed first in each of
their respective divisions.
Saturday's victory was the sixth

straight title for the women and
marked the ninth consecutive season in
which the Stanford men have nabbed
the top finish at West Regionals.
The women competed in the 6,000-
meter race and finished ahead of 27
other teams, while Arizona State
placed second. The Sun Devils took
second in the men's division as well.
The top two teams in each of nine
regions qualify for NCAAs, so both
Stanford and Arizona State earned
spots at the meet to be held next week.
Thirteen other teams will also earn at

The men's and women's cross country teams fell short of their title aspirations
at NCAAs, but both raced to first-place finishes at West Regionals.
large berths to the Championships.
Not only did Craig set the pace
for the Stanford women, she also
claimed her third consecutive Re
gional title. At the Pac-1() Champi
onships held earlier this month, she
came in second to Arizona State's
Amy Hastings; however, this week
end, Craig managed to finish the
race 11 seconds ahead of her.
In the 2003 West Regionals, Craig
outran several of her teammates, in
cluding seniors Sara Bei, Jeane Goff
and Anita Siraki, on her way to first
place; in 2002, Craig broke the 6,(XX)-
meter course record with a time of 20
minutes and 39 seconds.
The men's team showed equally
impressive strength.
Although Hall did not participate
in the earlier meets of this season, he
has more than made up for lost time.
Arizona's Robert Cheseret, last
year's Pac-10 Newcomer of the
Year, barely edged out Hall two
weeks ago at the Pac-10 Champi
onships in the 8,000-meter race.
However, just like Craig turned the
tables on Hastings. Hall learned
from his previous race and defeated
Cheseret and 149 other runners. In

Saturday's 10,000-meter race, the
Stanford senior cruised through the
finish line, placing a five second mar
gin between himself and Cheseret.
Sophomore Nef Araia placed
third with a time of 30:16 and junior
Jonathan Pierce placed 10th.
While the women are the top
ranked team, head coach Dena
Evans is slightly cautious with her
predictions for NCAAs.
"There are three or four teams
who definitely have a shot to win the
meet if they run well, and I think that
we're one of them," she said. "We
benefit from having a few members
of our seven who have run there be
fore. It's definitely going to be a
tough fight, and it's going to be close
all the way to the finish."
However, before the Champi
onships arrive on Monday, the teams
have about a week to rest up and re
flect on this weekend's performance.
"1 don't want to sound arrogant or
proud, but there was never a time
when 1 thought this team wouldn't ad
vance to NCAAs," Hall said. "When
you run hundreds of miles with guys
over a season you learn to develop a
deep trust in one another. We're like
brothers out there."
