Double team titles. Double indi
vidual titles.
This is becoming routine for the
Stanford cross country teams.
On Saturday, the top-ranked
women's team and the No. 2 men's
squad raced to victory once again at
West Regionals in Fresno, Calif, at
Woodward Park. Leading the Cardi
nal to victory, seniors Alicia Craig
and Ryan Hall placed first in each of
their respective divisions.
Saturday's victory was the sixth

straight title for the women and
marked the ninth consecutive season in
which the Stanford men have nabbed
the top finish at West Regionals.
The women competed in the 6,000-
meter race and finished ahead of 27
other teams, while Arizona State
placed second. The Sun Devils took
second in the men's division as well.
The top two teams in each of nine
regions qualify for NCAAs, so both
Stanford and Arizona State earned
spots at the meet to be held next week.
Thirteen other teams will also earn at
