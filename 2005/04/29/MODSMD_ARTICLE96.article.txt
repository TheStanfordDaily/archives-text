# MSU ends top-ranked Card's title hopes early
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to senior Susan King
Borchardt's lock-down defense,
Michigan State's Lindsay Bowen
only scored four points. Unfortu
nately, they might have been the
most important four of the game.
Her jumper in the lane with 22.8
seconds remaining extended the
Spartans' lead to three points, and
two free throws iced a 76-69 victory
over Stanford last night in the
Kansas City Regional final.
Stanford was denied its first trip
to the Final Four since 1997, as the
Spartans' Kristin Haynie scored 20
points, pulled down seven rebounds
and handed out seven assists.
"It's about making runs and
making big plays," Haynie said.
"Stanford did a great job tonight,
responding, you know, but we just
responded better."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
couldn't have been happy with what
she saw in the opening five minutes
