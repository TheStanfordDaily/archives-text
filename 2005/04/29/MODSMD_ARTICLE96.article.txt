# MSU ends top-ranked Card's title hopes early
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to senior Susan King
Borchardt's lock-down defense,
Michigan State's Lindsay Bowen
only scored four points. Unfortu
nately, they might have been the
most important four of the game.
Her jumper in the lane with 22.8
seconds remaining extended the
Spartans' lead to three points, and
two free throws iced a 76-69 victory
over Stanford last night in the
Kansas City Regional final.
Stanford was denied its first trip
to the Final Four since 1997, as the
Spartans' Kristin Haynie scored 20
points, pulled down seven rebounds
and handed out seven assists.
"It's about making runs and
making big plays," Haynie said.
"Stanford did a great job tonight,
responding, you know, but we just
responded better."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
couldn't have been happy with what
she saw in the opening five minutes
- a pair of turnovers by sophomore
center Brooke Smith and a break
down in transition defense led to an
8-0 opening run and an early 10-6
lead for the Spartans. But this
Card doesn't fold. Just ask Con
necticut, which staked a six-point
halftime lead only to fall to Stanford
by 17 on Sunday night. Stanford
stormed back, taking its first lead of
the game with 10:54 remaining in the
first half on a three-point field goal
by King Borchardt.
However, turnovers plagued the
Cardinal offense in the first half, as
Stanford gave the ball away eight
times before halftime in contrast to
Michigan State's two turnovers. The
result? A 28-28 tie at intermission
despite the Cardinal's out-shooting
the Spartans, 46.2 to 31.4 percent.
Michigan State battered Stanford
inside, limiting Smith to just four
points in the first half on the defen
sive end of the court, and picking up
seven offensive rebounds. In the
second half of its victory over Con
necticut, Stanford sprinted out of the
locker room on a mission, with more
energy and discipline than the de
fending champions. Tuesday night
was a different story altogether.
The Spartans virtually flew out
of the locker room, piloted by
Haynie. Fresh off a triple-double in
the Regional Semifinal against
Vanderbilt. Haynie amassed an in
credible 18 points in the first 22
minutes of play.
"At halftime. we felt that we
weren't really playing our best bas
ketball," senior Kelley Suminski
said. "We thought, 'We have 20
more minutes to break open this
game and show how we can play, and
unfortunately that didn't happen."'

Working inside, senior Kelli
Roehrig and junior Liz Shimek con
trolled the paint like they held the
deed to the place. And just like that,
Stanford's dream was dead.
The Spartan lead was five. Then
10. Then a whopping 13 with 11 min
utes remaining after Roehrig
drained a three-point field goal from
the wing.
But this Card doesn't fold, re
member?
A 15-2 Stanford run tied the
game with 7:06 remaining. The ener
gy, the momentum, the game, was
seemingly Stanford's.
In the end, however, there was
too much Haynie and Shimek.
Shimek collected a double-double
with game highs in points (24) and
rebounds (10). Big baskets down
the stretch kept Stanford at bay, and
her four offensive boards were as
many as the entire Cardinal team
grabbed.
A three-point play by freshman
Candice Wiggins with 43.6 seconds
pulled the Cardinal to within a point,
but it wasn't enough.
"You dream about this moment,
and you dream about being able to
advance to the Final Four." Wiggins
said. "It's really hard, especially
when you have a team like this, that
you just know there's something dif
ferent about this team, it's a special
team, and it's just so sad. I just like
playing with these seniors so much.
I'm so thankful."
"I was really proud of the way we
came back," VanDerveer said. "We
made some really good adjust
ments, we hit some big baskets, and
unfortunately we didn't make some
stops down the stretch when we
needed to."
