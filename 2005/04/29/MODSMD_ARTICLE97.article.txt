# Card seniors go out in style
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Coming off an ugly loss to Wash
ington State that put a temporarily
lid on any NCAA Tournament talk,
the Stanford men's basketball team
bounced back with its sweetest - and
most important - win of the season.
The Cardinal's 77-67 upset win
over No. 10 Washington likely
means Stanford's streak of 10 con
secutive trips to NCA As will remain
intact when the 65-team field is re
vealed on Sunday.
Yes, there was more to celebrate
in Saturday's regular-season finale
at Maples Pavilion than the careers
of seniors Nick Robinson and Rob
Little.
For one, Stanford (17-11,11-7 Pa
cific-10 Conference) helped dash
Washington's chances of winning its
first conference title in 20 years.
(Arizona, which was tied with the
Huskies for first place entering Sat
urday's games, won at Arizona State
later that day to capture the Pac-10
title outright). It was also proper
payback after Washington ended
Stanford's 26-game winning streak
in the final game of the regular sea
son last March.
Perhaps most importantly, how
ever, it showed that the Cardinal still
have some gas in the tank of their
battered ride; it was a testament to
the resilience of this year's team, a
feel-good way to end the regular
season chapter of a trying, emotion
al campaign.
"This was a great win because
we've been so up and down this year,
and to come out in the last game in
Maples for Nick and Rob and to
come off such a bad performance
Thursday, it shows we didn't give
in," junior guard Chris Hernandez
said. "We showed people we still
have something in us."
Hernandez finished with 12
points and five assists and got plenty
of support from fellow point guard
Jason Haas. The junior reserve de
livered an inspired performance,
doubling his previous career-high
with 18 points.
"After Thursday night I just said,
'Hey, we can't play any worse than
we did,"' Haas said. "With three
guys coming off the bench, someone
needs to be productive.
Haas was — scoring 13 of his
points on 14 free-throw attempts,
after getting to the line by displaying
an attack-the-glass mentality with
the Huskies focused on shutting
down Hernandez. Washington ef
fectively dared Haas to beat them on
certain possessions, and he did.
The win was a total team effort,
however, as junior forward Matt
Haryasz chipped in a career-high 24
points to go along with 10 rebounds.
"Everybody was bummed out

about the Thursday night game,"
Haryasz said. "1 think everybody did
a real good job of either using it as
fuel for this game or just forgetting
about it and coming out to play."
Stanford closed the first half with
a 10-0 run to head into the locker
room with a 31-29 lead. The Stan
ford defense held the high-octane
Huskies in check, as Washington
shot just 9-for-24 from long range
after sinking 16 three-pointers two
days prior against Cal.
Robinson scored 12 points and
grabbed nine rebounds in his final
game at Maples Pavilion. While Lit
tle's individual numbers (4 points, 4
rebounds, l-for-7 shooting) were
forgettable, the win will be one to re
member.
"It was great," Robinson said.
"I'm glad we were able to come out

and compete and get a win. It was a
lot of fun, I had a good time."
Stanford did the three simple
things head coach Trent Johnson has
preached all season. They outre
bounded the Huskies 40-34, took
care of the ball (12 assists, 12
turnovers) and played solid defense.
Afterward, Johnson made his
thoughts about the team's postsea
son hopes known.
"If we're not automatically in the
NCAAs, after beating Arizona and
now these guys, and the non-confer
ence schedule we play, and all the
things these kids have been through
since I've been hired something's
wrong."
