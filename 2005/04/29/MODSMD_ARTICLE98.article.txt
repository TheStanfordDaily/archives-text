Question: How do you replace a 16-time Ail-Amer
ican. 11-time national champion and Olympic medalist
like Tara Kirk, who finished her college career by set
ting a world record at last year's NCAA Champi
onships?
Answer: Caroline Bruce.
Bruce, a freshman and Olympian, finished a remark
able debut season at Stanford with two national titles to
lead the No. 5 Cardinal to a fifth-place finish at the
NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last
week.
Though she was not the top seed in any event. Bruce
stepped up when it counted, swimming personal bests in
the finals of both the 1 (K)-yard and 200-yard breast
stroke races.
"It was a great experience and really exciting to
sweep both of the breaststroke events in my freshman
year," Bruce said. "Tara Kirk was an amazing collegiate
swimmer. Taking after her by winning my first one and
following in her footsteps is quite an honor."
Bruce claimed the 1 (K)-yard breaststroke title with
the third-fastest time in history, just over a second off of
Tara Kirk's record set at last year's NCAA meet. In the
200-yard race, she came 1.3 seconds short of Kirk's
American record.
She also took third in the 200-yard individual medley
and helped the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays to
fourth- and third-place finishes, respectively.
Bruce ended the meet ranked second in individual
scoring with 56 of a possible 60 points.
Senior Lacey Boutwell, swimming competitively for
the last time, finished seventh in the 50-yard freestyle
and sixth in the 100-yard freestyle. She also swam on the
4(X)-yard medley relay, which finished third, and all
three freestyle medleys.
"It was great to finish this way," Boutwell said.
"There's not a moment I regret. My time at Stanford
with coach (Richard] Quick and all of the girls in our

earned a fifth-place finish. â™¦
program has been wonderful."
"Lacey Boutwell is ihc kind of
4wnw>ayoutan,buiUlaLc4m.aH>und,
because she will do anything to have
the team be successful," Quick said.
"She has been a great competitor
and great leader for four years. She's
been fantastic and Stanford swim
ming is going to miss her a lot."
Junior Dana Kirk, a 2004
Olympian alongside Bruce and sis
ter Tara, finished fifth in both of the
butterfly events and swam the but
terfly leg on both medley relays.
Also an Olympian, junior Kristen
Caverly finished 10th in both indi
vidual medleys and won the consola
tion final to finish ninth in the 200-
yard breaststroke.
Junior Laura Davis qualified for
the consolation finals in three events,
with her best finish in the 50-yard free

in which she was 11th. She finished
13th in both the 400-yard individual
medley and 2(X)-yard butterfly.
Freshman Brooke Bishop con
tributed points in several strokes,
including an 11th place finish in the
50-yard freestyle, 22nd in the 100-
yard backstroke and 26th in the
,100-yard IteeMyle. She swam on
both medley relays and two of the
three freestyle medleys and was the
Cardinal's top finisher in the back
stroke.
The distance swimmers, who
have been consistent throughout the
season, put in another good perfor
mance at the NCAA meet. In the
1650-yard freestyle, sophomore
Lauren Costella led the Cardinal
with a sixth-place finish. Freshman
Elizabeth Durot was 10th, followed
by sophomores Desiree Stahley and
Morgan Hentzen, who finished 14th
and 22nd.
