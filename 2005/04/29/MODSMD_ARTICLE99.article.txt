It is the end of an era for Stanford women's swim
ming. After 28 years of coaching and winning 12 na
tional championships, Richard Quick has decided that
the time has come for him to retire as head coach, the
athletic department announced Tuesday.
Though it was a difficult decision for him to make.
Quick said he is confident that he is doing it for the best
possible reasons.
"I have two major reasons," he explained in an in
terview with The Daily. "One of them is named Blake -
he's my grandson and he's 13 years old. And my other

Quick's family lives in Texas and he plans to spend

Quick said. "1 love Stanford. I love the student-athletes

derful coaches on the staff. There just isn't a better
place in the world to work. And I am still enthusiastic
about coaching and being here. But my grandkids just
won't cooperate. They keep growing up."

the 62-year-old Quick.
"I have actually been thinking about it for the last
four or five years," he said. "It just got to be a time
where, if I did this fora year or two or three more, pret
ty soon my grandkids are gone and I just didn't want to
miss them."
In the 17 years since Quick arrived on the Farm from
the University of Texas, he has led the team to seven
national championships, including five in a row be
tween 1992 and 1996. The team has won the Pacific-10
Conference crown 14 times and amassed a 123-10
record during his tenure. He has been Pac-10 Coach of
