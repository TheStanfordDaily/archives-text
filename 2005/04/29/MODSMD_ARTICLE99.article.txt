# A 						difficult decision
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
It is the end of an era for Stanford women's swim
ming. After 28 years of coaching and winning 12 na
tional championships, Richard Quick has decided that
the time has come for him to retire as head coach, the
athletic department announced Tuesday.
Though it was a difficult decision for him to make.
Quick said he is confident that he is doing it for the best
possible reasons.
"I have two major reasons," he explained in an in
terview with The Daily. "One of them is named Blake -
he's my grandson and he's 13 years old. And my other
reason is Emily â€” she's my granddaughter and she is
10 years old."
Quick's family lives in Texas and he plans to spend
his retirement close to them.
"If I could have somehow talked them into not con
tinuing to grow up, I would have stayed coaching here,"
Quick said. "1 love Stanford. I love the student-athletes
I get to work with and I love everything about the ath
letic department, the athletic director and all the won
derful coaches on the staff. There just isn't a better
place in the world to work. And I am still enthusiastic
about coaching and being here. But my grandkids just
won't cooperate. They keep growing up."
The decision to retire wasn't spur of the moment for
the 62-year-old Quick.
"I have actually been thinking about it for the last
four or five years," he said. "It just got to be a time
where, if I did this fora year or two or three more, pret
ty soon my grandkids are gone and I just didn't want to
miss them."
In the 17 years since Quick arrived on the Farm from
the University of Texas, he has led the team to seven
national championships, including five in a row be
tween 1992 and 1996. The team has won the Pacific-10
Conference crown 14 times and amassed a 123-10
record during his tenure. He has been Pac-10 Coach of
the Year four times and NCAA
Coach of the Year twice, in addition
to three times when he was at Texas.
He put together five straight na
tional titles with the Longhorns, and
then won a sixth consecutive cham
pionship in his first year with the
Cardinal. Before coaching at Texas,
he worked at Auburn, building the
foundation fora program that had
claimed three national crowns in a
row before finishing second this
year.
Quick has made his mark beyond

the collegiate scene, coaching Amer
ican athletes to international suc
cess. Over the years he has coached
at the World Championships, the
Goodwill Games, the Pan Pacific
Games, the World University
Games and the Pan-American
Games. He has been a coach at every
Olympic Games dating back to 1984,
three times as head coach and three
times as an assistant. In his three
stints as head coach, Americans
brought home 47 medals.
In addition to his work with the
entire national team. Quick has also
wonted privately with some of the
top swimmers in the nation, includ
ing former Stanford stars Jenny
Thompson, Dara Torres, Misty
Hyman and Tara Kirk. Thompson is

the most decorated Olympian in
American history with 12 medals,
and Torres won five medals at the
Sydney Olympics in 2(MM).
It will be an emotional transition
not only for the man who has done so
much for Stanford swimming, but for
the athletes who have learned so
many things from him.
"I would say that there is no pos
sible way that any team can be suc
cessful without a great coach, and
the Stanford women are the most
successful women's program ever,"
Dana Kirk said. "He is obviously the
best coach in women's college swim
ming and it's really sad that he is
leaving. A lot of my success is due to
some of the things that he has
brought out of me, like believing in

me, believing in all the swimmers.
And that is one thing that no one
does as well as Richard, making you
believe in yourself."
For the hundreds of Stanford
swimmers who have learned from
Quick through the years, he has
played more than just a small part.
"We're sad that he is leaving us
because, in every swimming rela
tionship, your coach is like your
dad." Dana Kirk said, holding back
tears. "He is definitely like a parent.
It's going to be hard to see him leave
but we understand."
