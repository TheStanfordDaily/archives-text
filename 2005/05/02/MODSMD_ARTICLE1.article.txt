# Group aims to make vehicle more reliable
## Solar Car Project looks ahead to July competition 
### TOLU OLORUNNIPA 
After more than a year of steady work, the
Stanford Solar Car Project's new vehicle. Sol
stice, is finally ready for the road. The student
run team, comprised mostly of undergraduates,
both designed and built the car. They will com
pete in the North American Solar Car Chal
lenge this summer.
Solstice is the seventh vehicle built by the
Stanford Solar Car Project, whose members
built its first car in 1986.
"We're using a completely new design," said
sophomore John Shen. "We've takfen every
thing we learned while building the last car and
applied it to this car."
The team began designing the car in Febru
ary of 2004 and completed construction in early
April of this year, a feat that senior Eerik
Hantsoo said will be vital to the team's success in
the competition this July.
"We made a point of accelerating the actual
construction process," he said. "We set a dead
line for ourselves and now we've got three
months to get the car tested."
Senior Alex Marshall, the electrical team
leader, said Solstice will likely fare well at the
race due to its durability, an attribute the team
focused on during the car's construction.
"A big thing that we're excited about is the
reliability of our car," Marshall said. "We have a
much better vehicle this time around. It's one of
the most reliable cars we've built in the last ten
years."

He added that the car, which completed a 180-
mile trial run in the Central Valley yesterday, has
reached speeds of 50 miles per hour and will be
even faster after additional parts are added.
Marshall said that the equipment used to
build the car cost more than $100,000, the bulk
of which was provided by corporate sponsors in
cluding Google and Cytec, a technology compa
ny that works to streamline aerospace innova
tions, among other things.
He said about one-fourth of the money
comes from ASSU special fees. This year, fund
ing for the Solar Car Project passed narrowly
with only 54.5 percent of the student body vot
ing for it to receive fees.
The team, which spends 15 to 20 hours per
week working on the car, will be sending 15 peo
ple to the Solar Car Challenge in July. The race,
which is held every other year, begins in Austin,
Texas, and ends in Calgary, Canada, a distance
of about 2,500 miles. Although the Stanford car
experienced some difficulties in 2003, Hantsoo
is optimistic about this year's race.
"I think now more than ever we have a really
coherent group of people on the team who know
what they're doing and we have a great core of
leadership coming back from last year," he said.
There are seven seniors on this year's team,
many of whom were present at the last race, in
which Stanford placed 15th out of 20 teams.
After the loss, the team decided to direct their
efforts toward building a more dependable car

they hope to make this year's car more durable than their last.
