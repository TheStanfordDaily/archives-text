# Osheroff reflects on his unique path
## Nobel turns Prof. into globetrotter Douglas Osheroff 
### CHRIS PEDREGAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff
first learned about research in his
high school chemistry class. His
teacher handed him a milk carton
with an unknown object inside it
and asked him to find out what it
was. The 10th grader from Wash
ington state took the box in his
hands and shook it back and forth,
listening to the noise it made.
Then he turned it upside down,
weighed it, rotated it slowly, rat
tled it — and by the time he was
able to guess, the future Nobel
laureate was hooked.
Today, Osheroff fits the image
of a university professor perfectly:
plaid, buttoned-down shirt, pale
complexion, meticulously kept
beard, hair neatly parted to one
side. He has a goofy laugh and
geeky sense of humor. And right
away it's clear he loves to talk.
As an undergraduate at the
California Institute of Technolo
gy. Osheroff was not particularly
distinguished. Especially during
the first years, he did not get good
grades. At one point he changed
his major from physics to electri
cal engineering because he had
been warned that physics was too
difficult. But he quickly switched
back when he realized he couldn't
stand engineering.
Then came a breakthrough. As
a graduate student at Cornell, he
helped discover super-fluidity in
He-3, a state that occurs at very
low temperatures when fluids
start moving without friction. This
discovery revolutionized the
study of low temperature physics
and eventually led to a Nobel
Prize in 19%.
After finishing graduate
school, Osheroff spent years
doing research at Bell Laborato

ries in New Jersey. Looking back
on that time period, Osheroff
claims he was a "man possessed,"
trying to prove that he was not just
some lucky graduate student by
working between SO to 1 (K) hours a
week.
"That was the time when it
would have made sense for us to
have children, but my wife and I
would never get home before nine
in the evening, and we grew very
used to that lifestyle," Osheroff
said. "In the end it's fine, I don't
think I regret it. Obviously our
lives have been very full."
It was because of his wife's job
that Osheroff decided to leave
Bell Laboratories and move to
California in 1987. After contem
plating Berkeley and CalTech, he
chose Stanford because he liked
the location and the people. The
switch from industry to academia,
however, meant a major change in
his daily routine — for once he
would have to put research on the
back burner.
"The things that I thought I
was the best at and that I was fa
mous for and that 1 enjoyed doing
the most, were things that I sud
denly didn't get to do anymore,"
Osheroff said about becoming a
professor.
But even though he missed
spending time in the lab. he loved
the idea of mentoring students
and decided to teach an entry
level physics class so he could in
teract with as many Stanford stu
dents as possible.
Osheroff's physics classes are
notorious for being extremely dif
ficult. and the running joke among
undergraduates is that he tries to
mention his Nobel as often as pos
sible during lecture. He'll say, for
example, "The sky is beautiful
today, almost as beautiful as the
sky in Stockholm."
He laughed at this joke and
said he admits that he used to talk
about the award a lot, but promis
es that he has stopped.
But it's hard to blame him —

winning the Nobel has had a large
impact on Osheroff, who now
spends a good part of his time
doing science outreach and giving
lectures around the globe. The
large photos of exotic locations in
his office record his travels and re
flect his love for photography. In
fact, Osheroff spent 10 percent of
his Nobel winnings on a top-of
the-line Hasselblad medium for
mat camera.
And because he fits the role of
the Stanford professor so well, the
University has turned him into a
kind of a poster boy. He has ap
peared prominently in pamphlets
for prospective students and even
in football game half-time shows.
A recording of the phone call he
received from the Nobel Institute
at 2:30 a.m. is also posted on the
Stanford Web site.
While Osheroff said he doesn't
enjoy the attention, he loves Stan
ford and doesn't mind "being used
a little bit in that way."
He said he plans on staying at
the University for years to come
and to continue his research. Re
cently, he became involved with
Scientists and Engineers for
Change, a political group lobbying
for energy conservation. This sum
mer he is traveling to Singapore,
China, Egypt and South America
to give lectures. He said he hopes
he'll have a chance to take some
pictures before he has to return to
the lecture hall in the fall.
"Life is full of interesting
things," Osheroff said. "The only
thing there isn't enough of is
time."
