## How to battle procrastination 
### 
That I have actually gotten to
the opening words of this column
is a feat that should not be under
estimated. I have been warily eye
ing my chair for days, distantly
contemplating this column dead
line. While my long-suffering edi
tor has tactfully avoided the sub
ject, I'm sure by now she is well
aware that she can expect my arti
cle about half a day after I've
promised it. (Sorry, Melanie.)
I take this approach to nearly
everything, but when midterm
season opened last week with as
signments totaling 30 pages, I dis
covered the limits of my faith in
frantic speed writing and deter
mined sincerely to finish my work
in a timely fashion. To my credit,
I lounged around for only a few

hours before be
ginning my prepa
rations.
In psychobab
ble, I am a "thrill
seeking" procras
tinator, the sort
who waits until
the last minute for
the panicky jolt of

Grace Liu

adrenaline.
"Thrill-seeking," however, is
singularly not descriptive of me
because I am metabolically so
sluggish to begin with that I wait
five hours every night fora
chemical rush just so 1 can stand
up, brush my teeth and go to
bed.
Now, I minored in chemistry,
even if 1 forgot to declare it and
my career adviser says it's unethi
cal to put it on my resume. I never
learned much about ethics, but I
did learn some nice terms like
"activation energy" that make me
sound like I understand my own
behavior.
The activation energy is a
high-energy hump that must be
surmounted before I can settle
into productivity. Forget that pro
crastination ends up taking more
effort in the end — that's a con
cern for the lucid mind. My con
sciousness is clouded over by
lethargy and easily sidetracked by
shiny objects and pop-up ads, so I
dither around attending to vari
ous distractions until the pressure
of time puts me over that energy
hump.
But for distractions, at least, the
principle works both ways. If I can
boost the activation energy of any
activity, I'll stop pursuing it. In the
first move toward an efficient week
in midterm writing, I identified the
main time-sucking applications on
my computer and moved the short
cuts from the desktop to more hid
den folders. In order to launch
them, I would now have to click
through a series of 20 folders, e.g.,
C:/ Program Files/Dear/Self —
/Pie ase/think/about/t he/conse
quences/for/at/least/ 10/mins/be
fore/opening/this/folder/to/launch
/AlM.exe.
That step complete, 1 then en
joyed two days of total idleness,
including a five-hour nap. I am
not so stupid as to imagine I could
start my exams a whole four days
in advance. Instead. I killed three
birds with one stone: caught up on
sleep, brought myself into a more
reasonable time frame and found
other ways to distract myself,
such as enjoying my weekly
screening of Fight Club and flip
ping through the last book I
bought.
Two days before Due Day, I
settled my laptop on my desk,
along with an array of papers that
included, somewhere, my essay
prompts. Then, for the last part of
my master plan, I went off in
search of artificial chemicals to
boost my activity levels. I drank
some tea. tried a can of Red Bull
and added on a few forms of alco
hol and had some chicken soup,
for good measure. Then I
sprawled out on the couch to pass
a few comfortable minutes while
waiting for the drugs to kick in.
When I woke up the next
morning, I experienced a sudden
— but this time, unexpected —
spike in adrenaline levels and
rapidly cranked out a quite re
spectable amount of work. I ran a
word count, and it comes up to
about half of what I have due to
morrow. That was good for now.
The nice thing about writing
classes is we get to do revisions.

I check my e-mail about 500 times a
day. Make this activity seem slightly
less pathetic by writing me at
