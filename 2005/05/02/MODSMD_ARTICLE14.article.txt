# Junior kayaks to victory on American River
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
Two weekends ago, junior An
drew Peterman took first place in
the American- River Festival Na
tional Tournament for Slalom
Whitewater Kayaking. This, how
ever, is only a small victory for the
civil engineering major and former
third-place winner in the Czech Re
public Junior World Cup.
"A firecracker personality" both
on-and-off the water, according to
his friend Jacob Gomez, a junior,
Peterman has been kayaking pretty
much all his life.
"I started kayaking when I was
about nine years old," Peterman
said. "I'm from Idaho and my fami
ly took a kayak lesson on the
Payette River. From there I joined
a kids club in Boise and started
competing in whitewater slalom
kayak races around the North
west."
Later, Peterman's kayaking took
on a more competitive edge.
"In high school, I realized I
wanted to continue racing at a na
tional and international level so I
enrolled in the Academy at Adven
ture Quest," he said. "The Acade
my, no longer in existence, was a
traveling high school for competi
tive kayak training and competi
tion. We traveled during the winter
to South and Central America, New
Zealand, Australia, etc., so we
could continue to train in the winter
months."
Through the team, he was able to
compete in major international
tournaments.
"For the last two years of high
school I also competed as a member
of the U.S. Junior National Kayak
team in the Junior World Champi

onships and Junior World Cup
events in Slovakia, Slovenia,
Poland and the Czech Republic,"
he said. "I earned a bronze medal at

the Junior World Cup in Roudnice,
Czech Republic, and I placed in the
top 20 at the 2000 Olympic Team
Trials."
Nowadays, Peterman is taking a

break from the competitive circuit
and is involved with the Stanford
Kayak Club.
"Since I've been at Stanford,

I've been in semi-retirement," he
said. "I train frequently, however I
made a decision to focus on school
rather than continue competing at
the national/international level."

According to his friend Rolf
Steier, a junior, this was an impres
sive decision for Peterman to make.
"I know Andrew made a con-

scious decision to put his kayaking
career on hold in coming to Stan
ford," Steier said. "He was definite
ly big-time, but even though he has
n't been racing consistently, I know

he's still involved in the national
and international kayaking commu
nity."
Steier recalled an incident when
one of Peterman's old kayaking
friends came to visit.
"1 remember last year when a
buddy of his, Tilo, from the German
national team came to visit fora
week," he said. "They both talked
in this weird kayak-vernacular to
each other, and they definitely
wouldn't sugarcoat it for me."
Peterman got the chance to re
turn to the kayaking scene by decid
ing to participate in the non-profit
American River Festival.
"1 decided to compete in the fes
tival because it is fairly close by and
would give me a good opportunity
to see some old friends from the
sport," he said. "I take all racing
fairly seriously, but the pressure
wasn't too high."
Though in existence since 1981,
the American River Festival be
came a non-profit fundraiser for the
first time this year with proceeds
from the event going to American
Whitewater, the American Canoe
Association, Friends of the River
and the American River Conser
vancy — all four of which promote
river conservation.
The American River is located
two hours away from San Francisco
and goes down the western slope of
the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The
south fork of the river, where the
race took place, is a 20-mile stretch
featuring difficult class 111 rapids.
Peterman competed in the
whitewater slalom race, which was
one of the featured events along
with whitewater rodeo and wildwa
ter race.

"Whitewater slalom kayaking is
where a kayaker must negotiate down
a whitewater course through a series
of about 20 gates," Peterman ex
plained. "Some of the gates you must
pass through going downstream,
while others must be negotiated in the
opposite direction going upstream."
"Typically, the courses are set
on the more difficult sections of
whitewater on a river to provide
the spectators with excitement as
well as challenge the racers. You
take two runs down the course and
the times are combined. Hitting
the gates results in a two second
penalty and missing the gates re
sults in a 50 second penalty."
Though this was Peterman s first
race in a while, his win was certain
ly not out of place considering his
experience.
"I wasn't surprised to win the
race," he said. "I've been out of the
racing scene fora few years, but
I've retained a lot of fitness as well
as technique through training
around the area."
He added, however, "I was a lit
tle rusty on my first run down the
course. After my first run I was only
up on the competition by about a
half a second."
Peterman took an opportunity
after his first run to figure out ways to
improve his time for his second run.
"Between my first and second
runs I studied the course a bit
more. I found specific places on
the course I knew I could make
up time," Peterman said. "My
second run was a lot smoother. I
ended up winning by seven or
eight seconds, with my friend
Rusty in second place."
Although Peterman has accom
plished many things in the kayaking
world, he is not one to boast.
"Andrew has been very humble
about his accomplishments," Steier
said. "I only really find out about
them when he's telling stories
about his travels to places like Chile
and New Zealand."
In these stories, however, Steier
explained that Peterman simply in
cluded his victories as "footnotes in
tales of his travels."
Steier hopes this doesn't change
with his recent victory at the festival.
"I hope he won't big-time me,
jast because he won," he joked.
Peterman, however, is already
looking ahead to his future kayak
ing plans.
* His one main goal?
I "To win," he said.

"Andrew has been very humble
about his accomplishments," Steier
said. "I only really find out about
them when he's telling stories
about his travels to places like Chile
and New Zealand."
In these stories, however, Steier
explained that Peterman simply in
cluded his victories as "footnotes in
tales of his travels."
Steier hopes this doesn't change
with his recent victory at the festival.
"I hope he won't big-time me,
jast because he won," he joked.
Peterman, however, is already
looking ahead to his future kayak
ing plans.
* His one main goal?
I "To win," he said.
Two weekends ago, junior An
drew Peterman took first place in
the American- River Festival Na
tional Tournament for Slalom
Whitewater Kayaking. This, how
ever, is only a small victory for the
civil engineering major and former
third-place winner in the Czech Re
public Junior World Cup.
"A firecracker personality" both
on-and-off the water, according to
his friend Jacob Gomez, a junior,
Peterman has been kayaking pretty
much all his life.
"I started kayaking when I was
about nine years old," Peterman
said. "I'm from Idaho and my fami
ly took a kayak lesson on the
Payette River. From there I joined
a kids club in Boise and started
competing in whitewater slalom
kayak races around the North
west."
Later, Peterman's kayaking took
on a more competitive edge.
"In high school, I realized I
wanted to continue racing at a na
tional and international level so I
enrolled in the Academy at Adven
ture Quest," he said. "The Acade
my, no longer in existence, was a
traveling high school for competi
tive kayak training and competi
tion. We traveled during the winter
to South and Central America, New
Zealand, Australia, etc., so we
could continue to train in the winter
months."
Through the team, he was able to
compete in major international
tournaments.
"For the last two years of high
school I also competed as a member
of the U.S. Junior National Kayak
team in the Junior World Champi

onships and Junior World Cup
events in Slovakia, Slovenia,
Poland and the Czech Republic,"
he said. "I earned a bronze medal at

the Junior World Cup in Roudnice,
Czech Republic, and I placed in the
top 20 at the 2000 Olympic Team
Trials."
Nowadays, Peterman is taking a

break from the competitive circuit
and is involved with the Stanford
Kayak Club.
"Since I've been at Stanford,

I've been in semi-retirement," he
said. "I train frequently, however I
made a decision to focus on school
rather than continue competing at
the national/international level."

According to his friend Rolf
Steier, a junior, this was an impres
sive decision for Peterman to make.
"I know Andrew made a con-

scious decision to put his kayaking
career on hold in coming to Stan
ford," Steier said. "He was definite
ly big-time, but even though he has
n't been racing consistently, I know

he's still involved in the national
and international kayaking commu
nity."
Steier recalled an incident when
one of Peterman's old kayaking
friends came to visit.
"1 remember last year when a
buddy of his, Tilo, from the German
national team came to visit fora
week," he said. "They both talked
in this weird kayak-vernacular to
each other, and they definitely
wouldn't sugarcoat it for me."
Peterman got the chance to re
turn to the kayaking scene by decid
ing to participate in the non-profit
American River Festival.
"1 decided to compete in the fes
tival because it is fairly close by and
would give me a good opportunity
to see some old friends from the
sport," he said. "I take all racing
fairly seriously, but the pressure
wasn't too high."
Though in existence since 1981,
the American River Festival be
came a non-profit fundraiser for the
first time this year with proceeds
from the event going to American
Whitewater, the American Canoe
Association, Friends of the River
and the American River Conser
vancy — all four of which promote
river conservation.
The American River is located
two hours away from San Francisco
and goes down the western slope of
the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The
south fork of the river, where the
race took place, is a 20-mile stretch
featuring difficult class 111 rapids.
Peterman competed in the
whitewater slalom race, which was
one of the featured events along
with whitewater rodeo and wildwa
ter race.

"Whitewater slalom kayaking is
where a kayaker must negotiate down
a whitewater course through a series
of about 20 gates," Peterman ex
plained. "Some of the gates you must
pass through going downstream,
while others must be negotiated in the
opposite direction going upstream."
"Typically, the courses are set
on the more difficult sections of
whitewater on a river to provide
the spectators with excitement as
well as challenge the racers. You
take two runs down the course and
the times are combined. Hitting
the gates results in a two second
penalty and missing the gates re
sults in a 50 second penalty."
Though this was Peterman s first
race in a while, his win was certain
ly not out of place considering his
experience.
"I wasn't surprised to win the
race," he said. "I've been out of the
racing scene fora few years, but
I've retained a lot of fitness as well
as technique through training
around the area."
He added, however, "I was a lit
tle rusty on my first run down the
course. After my first run I was only
up on the competition by about a
half a second."
Peterman took an opportunity
after his first run to figure out ways to
improve his time for his second run.
"Between my first and second
runs I studied the course a bit
more. I found specific places on
the course I knew I could make
up time," Peterman said. "My
second run was a lot smoother. I
ended up winning by seven or
eight seconds, with my friend
Rusty in second place."
Although Peterman has accom
plished many things in the kayaking
world, he is not one to boast.
"Andrew has been very humble
about his accomplishments," Steier
said. "I only really find out about
them when he's telling stories
about his travels to places like Chile
and New Zealand."

explained that Peterman simply in
cluded his victories as "footnotes in
tales of his travels."
