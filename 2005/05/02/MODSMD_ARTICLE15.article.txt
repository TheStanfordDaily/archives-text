# Travel, study or relax: putting Stanford on hold
## 
### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
College life is educational in many differ
ent ways. People learn how to live indepen
dently from their parents — albeit there's
some hand-holding in the bubble that is Stan
ford — and experiences in and out of the
classroom teach lifelong lessons. But some
times an experience away from campus — ei
ther before entering Stanford or sometime
during one?s time here — can be more in
structional.
Many Stanford students chose to stop out
of college or defer their acceptance fora pe
riod of time in order to explore different
lifestyles or just take time to themselves. Al
though reasons for taking time off vary,
many students view their sabbaticals very
positively and return to the Farm with a
fresh perspective on life. Three Stanford stu
dents— senior Karen Lanyi, junior Sarah
Baker and senior Chloe Rothstein — all de
cided to take time off sometime before or
during their time at Stanford. Their experi
ences reveal that some time away from
school can be a good thing.
Focus your academic passions
Lanyi had applied to the School Year
Abroad program in China every year of her
high school career. However, she was never
able to take advantage of the opportunity be
cause of her busy athletic schedule. Finally,
when she applied her senior year, she was
awarded a merit scholarship to go to China
for the year.
When presented with the scholarship,
Lanyi asked herself: "Do 1 want to take a
plunge and do this and have a really awesome
experience or do 1 want to go to college and
do the more mainstream thing?"

Lanyi decided to walk the path less taken.
Her time abroad also helped Lanyi realize
where she wanted to focus her academics.
"High school was pretty intense for me
and I was pretty tired by senior year," she
said. "I didn't know exactly what I wanted to
study. In China, I knew more of what my in
terests were."
Lanyi is currently double majoring in Chi
nese language and management science and
engineering.
When Lanyi came to Stanford as a fresh
man, she felt that she had a different outlook
on life than many of the other students.
"A hard part was that 1 was a freshman but
I'd been far away from home fora long time
already," Lanyi said. "Everybody else was ex
cited about the new college experience, but it
was nothing for me."
While Lanyi was very academically fo
cused already, most freshmen were still be
wildered with college life.
"To be able to focus like that was really
nice," she explained. "While everybody was
trying to figure out majors and freaking out
about classes, I had a four-year plan."
Lanyi expected that this experience gap
with other freshman might be a problem, so
she requested to live in a four-class dorm.
"It took fall quarter to understand what
was going on for other freshmen."
However, Lanyi began to bond with other
freshmen during her winter quarter.
Lanyi would recommend deferring a
year to Stanford students who. like her, felt
overwhelmed after the high school experi
ence.
"A lot of students come to Stanford a little
burned out from high school. Being able to come
here and focus and work hard is really nice. I feel
like I have the big picture, and haven't gotten
caught up in too many trivialities."

Time to Unwind
"Stopping out is one of the best things I've
ever done," explained the curly-haired, ener
getic Baker.
After traveling and studying for nine
months in Peru, India and Australia, Baker
was worn out and decided to take some time
off from the hectic life that awaited her at the
Farm. She had planned on stopping out from
Stanford to complete her human biology in
ternship, but decided to stick around home
and wind down instead.
"Stanford students tend to go, go, go and
don't take time to themselves. I needed time
to take care of myself."
Living with her family in Mountain View,
Calif., Baker began her internship at Vaden
Student Health Center, working as a physical
therapist assistant. She also took time to or
ganize her things at home, read books for
recreation and bond with her family. Baker
still took the time to spend time with friends
at Stanford, particularly the students who had
studied in Australia with whom she had
formed a close bond.
Baker also said that spending time off
campus allows one to develop a persona out
side of the Stanford community. When she
got back to campus, she found a "middle
ground between the Stanford person you are
who all your friends know and who you've be
come."
Gain Valuable Experience
Rothstein deferred her acceptance to
Stanford and spent two semesters abroad.
The first was with International Partner
ship in Service Learning in Guadalajara,
Mexico, through which she participated in
community service and took classes. She
spent her second semester at an internship

with a Boston University program in
Paris.
Rothstein knew that she wanted to take a
year off before applying to college.
"I knew I was going to spend a lot of time in
school, so why not spend some time in the 'real
world.'"
She states that living in Guadalajara gave
her a unique perspective once she arrived on
campus.
"You're living with people who have a
completely different lifestyles and whose
every day concerns are whether they have
enough money to take the bus to a doctor as
opposed to whether they're getting an 'A' or
a 'B' at Stanford."
However, this added experience did not
segregate Rothstein from other Stanford stu
dents and it made her more excited about the
academic year.
"I never felt as though I was older," she
said. "I was young for my year so that may
have made a difference. Personally, I wasn't
stressed out and I hadn't just come from ap
plying to college and taking exams."
Rothstein also said that she appreciated
taking some time off before plunging into a
busy academic schedule.
"I came from a year of not having an aca
demic experience. I was exhausted at the end
of high school and after taking a year off, I felt
really excited to start school again."
Although Rothstein does not regret her
experience away from Stanford, she added
that the decision to defer a year is not for ev
eryone.
Rothstein said she would recommend de
ferring a year to go abroad if "this is some
thing you really want to do and you are will
ing to deal with the possibility of not having a
wonderful experience the entire time. It's not
the safety net that Stanford is."
