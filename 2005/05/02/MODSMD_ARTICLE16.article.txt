# LSU dean arrested on child porn charges

(U-WIRE) BATON ROUGE, La.—
Louisiana State University police arrested asso
ciate dean of students Jim Welles late Wednes
day night after an office employee discovered a
pornographic photo of prepubescent boys on
the printer of the chief disciplinarian's Johnston
Hall office.
LSUPD spokesman Ricky Adams said police
found pornographic videotapes and compact
discs in Welles' home and several illegal files on
his computers. Welles is the campus administer
who punishes students for behavior that violates
the university's Student Code of Conduct.
Police charged Welles with one count of pos
session of child pornography and booked him in

East Baton Rouge Parish Prison around 11 p.m.
Wednesday. He was still in jail as of press time
Thursday night.
Adams said the Dean of Students Office em
ployee who tipped off police found the printed
photo about three weeks ago and brought it to
Welles. Adams said Welles told the employee
that he would report the photo right away.
When the employee questioned Welles about
the photo Wednesday morning, police said
Welles told her that Computing Services deter
mined that the photo was not illegal — meaning
the boys in the image were older than the legal
age of 17, according to police.
Skeptical of Welles' response, the office em
ployee called Computing Services. Employees
at Computing Services said they had never
heard of the photo.

The employee, who made a copy of the porno
graphic photo before she turned it into Welles,
called the police immediately.
Adams said Internet Crimes Task Force investi
gators are still investigating Welles' computers
and trying to determine the ages of the children
in the photos and on the tapes. But Adams said
he thinks the boys in the photos are younger
than the legal age to engage in pornography.
Officers searched and seized evidence in
Welles' office, his Baton Rouge, La., home and
his French Quarter residence in New Orleans.
It is too early to determine how much child
pornography Welles possessed. And though po
lice only charged him with one count of posses
sion of child pornography, Adams said police
may still add charges after investigators finish
the examination.
