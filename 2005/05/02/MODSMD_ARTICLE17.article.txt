(U-WIRE) BOSTON — Wannabe
Casanovas and satisfaction-seeking
females received sexual enlighten
ment Friday, as BU Central hosted
"The Big O" at Boston University
— a lecture that examined the topic
of the elusive female orgasm.
Event organizer Tara Glick said
she chose to host the lecture because
of the intriguing subject matter.
"It just seemed like an interest
ing, fun event,"the School of Man
agement sophomore said. "It is very
relevant for college students and
should have a big draw."
Sex educators Dorian Solot and
Marshall Miller presented topics
ranging from having better and mul
tiple orgasms to finding the G-spot.
Solot began the evening by talk
ing about her struggle with breast
cancer.
"One night I was lying in bed get
ting ready to fall asleep, and I just
stretched and absentmindedly ran
my hand down my arm and across
my chest, and I noticed this small
lump," she said. "When I found out

my lump was breast cancer, 1 was
blown away. I was flabbergasted.
"It's not wrong to touch your
body," she continued.
Solot said she began to learn that
masturbation was okay from her
parents at a young age.
"My parents said masturbation is
fine — it's just something you do in pri
vate, like not in the sandbox." she said.
Miller and Solot went on to crit
icize the sexual-psychological cen
sorship often experienced by chil
dren, specifically discussing par
ents conditioning infants to avoid
contact with their reproductive or
gans and adolescents to say "no"
to sex.
After the group presentation, the
males and females were separated
into two groups for more intimate
discussions.
In the male group. Miller said
surveys show that most women pre
fer "the motion of the ocean" over
size and dislike quiet sex.
In the female group. Solot brain
stormed "things that feel sexy" in
cluding chocolate, shower faucets,
dirty thoughts, lubrication and full
bladders during sex.
