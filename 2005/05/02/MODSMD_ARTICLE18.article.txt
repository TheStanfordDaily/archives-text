# No suspensions for first positive test
## Speculations arise of steriod use at Duke 
### MIKE VAN PELT THE CHRONICLE 
(U-WIRE) DURHAM. N.C.—
Questions involving steroid use at
Duke have surfaced this month, but
the Athletic Department has sought
to provide answers for its student
athletes since the beginning of the
school year, when it adapted its
wide-ranging drug policy.
Duke's revised Student-Athlete
Drug Policy, which went into effect
in August, no longer includes athlet
ic suspensions for an athlete's first
positive drug test — a change made
to provide a "safety net" with the
threat of suspension and revoked
scholarships at stake. The Athletic
Department can still invoke other
forms of sanctions fora student-ath
lete's first positive test.
Although Athletic Department
officials pitch their testing program to
student-athletes as random, they can
add players suspected of substance
use to a random group selected for
testing five to six times a year. The
University has no obligation to report
any finding from its own institutional
drug tests to the NCAA, which per
forms its own sporadic testing.
Assistant Director of Athletics
Brad Berndt. who oversees drug test
ing and academic support, said
Duke's new policy for enforcement
and education is comparable to other
ACC schools and was instituted pri
marily to help the student athletes.
"We felt like there was some am
biguous language in our policy, and
it really wasn't clear to the student
athletes: 'What's going to happen if I
test positive?' " Berndt said.
"If we could put something in
there that would give them a little bit
of a safety net-not an easy way out
but a safety net-to seek assistance
and seek opportunity to be educat
ed, and for us to help them we want
ed to have that flexibility."
The drug policy, included in an
orientation handbook distributed
to all players each fall, outlines an

athletic suspension of 40 percent of
the regular season fora second of
fense and permanent suspension
after the third. All positive tests
also include notification of team
mates, parents and coaches, as well
as mandatory counseling and com :
munity service.
In addition, the policy states,
"The department also reserves the
right to impose alternative sanctions
at anytime, where appropriate."
Officials said the previous proto
col, which they estimated was adopt
ed in 1999 or 2(KX) to institute Duke
sponsored drug testing for the first
time, suspended athletes 10 percent
of their teams' games for the first
positive test, followed by 50 percent
of the season and removal from the
team for the second and third posi
tives, respectively. Athletic officials
did not respond to several requests
by The Chronicle for documents
outlining former testing and en
forcement policies.
"In 2002, we had a much more
open policy with much more flexibil
ity to it," Berndt said. "We'd sus
pend certain situations, and other
situations we would not. The bottom
line, to be honest with you, we felt
like we wanted to make our policy
from a sanction standpoint-more
clear to our student-athletes."
The Student-Athlete Drug Policy
states that students are selected for
testing either randomly or "when a
coach or the Director of Athletics
has a reasonable and articulable sus
picion that the student-athlete has
used a prohibited drug."
The latter clause, referred to as
"probable cause" testing, was part of
the impetus for last year's change in the
penalty structure, said Chris Kennedy,
senior associate athletic director.
"All burden fell upon coaches,
administrators, officials of the ath
letic department to become ac
cusers, to put them in the position of
turning somebody in-potentially
causing them to lose their scholar
ship," Kennedy said.
