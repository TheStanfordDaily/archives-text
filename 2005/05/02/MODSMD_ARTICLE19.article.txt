## Editorial Graduates have many public service opportunities 
### 
"You can't serve for two years and just
leave!" declares the Stanford School of Ed
ucation, pulling on the arm of a Stanford se
nior. "Don't believe them; if you join us, you
can make a difference in just two years!" re
buts Teach For America, or TFA, yanking
on the other arm.
Both are stretching the student in oppo
site directii >ns, arguing that serving as a teach
er in low-income areas either should or
should not require interested students to ob
tain prior certification and commit more than
two years to their jobs. At the same time, each
gr< >up is so focused on winning the tug-of-war
that they lose sight of the common goal that
they have for this student: inspiring him to
c< immit to public service and essentially "pay
forward" the advantages he or she has re
ceived Iron. Ins o. her years at Stanford.
The debate over the best way to address
the problem of educational inequities in
low-income areas of the United States has
intensified over the years and recently resur
faced with the publication of School of Edu
cation Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond's
study examining the impact of uncertified
TFA teachers on their students' academic
progress. While TFA's effectiveness and
merit should be closely studied and debated,
we worry that students watching the back
and-forth in The Daily's opinions pages —
with thinly veiled insults coming from both
sides — will be disheartened and scared
away from the profession.
Despite the attention garnered by this
particular debate, it is crucial for students
who are interested in public service to know
that there are many other opportunities to
serve. While not as well known, organiza
tions such as World Teach and the Knowl
edge is Power Program place as much of an

emphasis on reaching out to those in need as
TFA or the School of Education's programs
do.
Rather than berating them for choosing
one particular non-profit organization or
program over another, we as a campus must
commend and support those students who
devote their post-graduate career to public
service. The Career Development Center,
or CDC, has already taken a positive first
step by scheduling a future non-profit career
fair and will large organizations to campus
next year. However, a more concentrated
effort needs to be made by both professors
and the CDC to encourage more students
into public service by making a wider array
of possibilities, often with smaller organiza
tions, better known.
The debate spurred by Darling-Ham
mond's study has driven home the fact that
Stanford alumni should not treat public ser
vice as padding for their resume or a way to
relax fora few years before going to grad
school. Anyone attempting to improve edu
cation in underserved American communi
ties — or to get involved with public service
around in the world — will face serious ob
stacles and the possibility that they might do
more harm than good. They must take these
positions absolutely seriously, both as chal
lenging opportunities to effect positive
change and as gateways to a lifetime dedica
tion to public service.
Regardless of ideological differences, at
the heart of both TFA and the School of Ed
ucation is an intense and admirable desire to
make a positive contribution to society. It's
time for everyone to quit pulling on the
limbs of dedicated students and start en
couraging them to search for the service
program that will fit them best.
