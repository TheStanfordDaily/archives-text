# Owls serve as pest control
## 
### STEPHANIE CHAPARRO 
Two eyes appear through the dark hole. A
small body emerges and two wings spanning
three feet unfold. The bird swoops to the
ground and snatches up the now lifeless body
of its prey.
This is an increasingly familiar scene at
the 717 Dolores and Columbae Row houses,
which have started installing owl boxes as
part of their capital improvement projects.
The boxes are being added in an attempt to
curtail the rodent problems on campus with
out using harmful chemicals. They provide a
protected nesting area for owls, which dine
mainly on gophers, a growing menace on the
Stanford campus.
"Owl boxes are an example of integrated
pest management, a movement to reduce
pesticides in the environment by using more
ecologically sound techniques," Gabriella
Judd, project manager for Stanford Housing,
wrote in an e-mail. "The boxes divert scrap
wood from a landfill, support a learning pro
gram for kids who build the boxes and sup

port local wildlife."
Integrated pest management advocates
research pests, their habits and the environ
ment where they thrive in order to develop
plans to minimize their populations without
disrupting ecosystems.
Gophers, the targeted pests on campus,
are known to tear up Stanford fields,
flowerbeds and golf greens, causing
headaches for campus landscapers and cost
ing the University up to millions of dollars in
damage. Incidentally, gophers also make up
two-thirds of barn owls' diet.
"A campus biologists informs me that
there are many barn owls on campus, and our
timing is good because young owls will be
seeking new nests in early summer," Judd
said.
When natural processes are used to elimi
nate pests, there is less need to implement
radical methods like baiting, trapping, fumi
gating and flooding that can create even
more environmental issues, according to a
recent article in Audubon Maga
zine.
Also, limited use of poison and
pesticides reduces the risk of im

pacting other local species, in
cluding nearby residents.
But residents at 717 Dolores
seem disinterested in the owl
boxes, and many were unaware
that he boxes exist at all. Several
said they thought housing offi
cials were ignoring more perti
nent pest problems.
Senior Jack Hogan, kitchen

manager at 717 Dolores, said he
didn't think the owl boxes were
worth the effort.
"I don't know if owl boxes will
be effective in mitigating the go
pher menace," he said. "What we
need to do something about is the
skeeters. We can't even eat out
side after 7 p.m. for fear of being
eaten ourselves."
