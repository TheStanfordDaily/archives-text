"Woah, you're going to be so
rich!" This was the assessment of
my future from a 16-year-old kid
from my hometown when he
found out I went to Stanford.
Lately, it seems as if he and ev
eryone else I know think that I
merely have to follow the yellow
brick, or Cardinal red, road to
riches, fame and eternal wealth.
In fact. 1 seem to be the only per-

son who has doubts about my future. (Other than my
mom, who, after 20 years of reverse psychology par
enting, is sticking to the party line and has decided I
have no prospects either.)
It might just be because 1 am an American stud
ies major, but I don't expect to hit pay dirt when 1
graduate. By my assessment, the jobs available, the
salaries they provide and, most importantly, the op
portunities they offer, are grim. Yes, the Stanford
name sure helps. And in theory, I am a productive,
intelligent and valuable member of society that any
company should be thankful to have on board. But
look at the aggregate: There are way too many of me
(college graduates) and way too few of them (desir
able jobs).
In January, Time magazine ran a cover story on
"twixters," mid-to-late twenty-somethings who
bounce between jobs, apartments and cities â€” and
still rely on financial support from their parents, if
they're not still taking up residence with them. (As
an aside, I would recommend everyone read it, be
cause that could be you in a few years. Or, seniors,
in a few months.)
The article speculated that the desire to do some
thing more meaningful with their lives has caused
nearly an entire generation to reject the notion that
just getting a job and sticking with it constitutes "suc

cess." Perhaps. But maybe part of that desire stems
from the fact that the jobs they could stick to are
lower paying, less satisfying and less promising.
Thus, work that is more meaningful is more signifi
cant.
For perhaps the first time in our country's histo
ry, we have a situation in which newly minted adults
may not be able to generate the same kind of wealth
and, therefore lifestyle, that their parents did. What
they experienced as children they may not be able to
recreate for themselves.
This has major social implications beyond just a
lack of a new BMW in every driveway. Finland and
Japan have two of the highest suicide rates in the
world. It's probably not a coincidence that both
countries also have young adult populations search
ing both for jobs that can replicate the lifestyle of
their formative years and for meaning in their lives.
There's a real sense that they will not live ifp to their
parent's socioeconomic standards. In a materialistic,
consumption-driven culture, they question how they
will derive satisfaction from a life less bling bling.
An economics major can probably better answer
whether or not we face the same predicament. But it
is worth thinking about: What if, 20 years from now,
you're not living the lifestyle you've enjoyed for the
past 20 years? How will you find meaning in your life
instead? Will we be forced to reevaluate the mean
ing of success?
Maybe that hometown kid was right. Hopefully
he was. "So rich" sounds like a nice way to describe
myself in 10 years. But if not, how will I and my fel
low under-achievers handle adjusting our lifestyles
and our definitions of success?
