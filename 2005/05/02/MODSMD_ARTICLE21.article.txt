TFA provides teachers where ihey
are needed
Having just been invited to join Teach for
America, or TFA, I've read the recent spat over
the program with interest (most recently, the let
ter "TFA alumnus' claims lack evidence," April
2f>). 1 make no claims to expertise on the subject,
hut 1 feel like the debate in these pages is missing
a basic point: schools in this country are short of
teachers and TFA helps to provide them.
I'm not surprised that credentialed teachers
tend to do better in the classrwm or that teach
ers with more experience tend to be more effec
tive. The fact remains, however, that we don't
have enough of them. TFA recruits are inter
viewed and hired by their school districts like
anyone else. If more qualified teachers were
available, the district would hire them instead.
TFA recruits aren't keeping schtxils from having
credentialed teachers. They are stepping in to
schools where not enough credentialed teachers
can be found and doing their best — often doing
wonderful things — with that they have.
I'm not joining TFA because I consider my

self God's gift t<*> the classroom. On the contrary,
I am humbled by teachers with experience who
have devoted themselves to working in strug
gling schools. I'm joining because I see a problem
that 1 care about, and I want to spend the next
few years of my life doing the best 1 can to help.

Universities should not tolerate restraints on
intellectual freedom
The Daily article "Universities' right to ex
press under attack" (April 27) begins with a com
plaint by Stanford President John Hennessy
about restraints on universities' freedom of in
quiry and expression. Certainly, this is a
widespread problem. However, the complaint
would be taken more seriously if it weren't for
these same universities' growing habit of willing
ly restraining their freedoms in exchange for
money. Contractual restraints on research re
sults, as well as other practices such as the
widespread tolerance of conflicts of interest, are

elaborated in two recent books. "Universities,
Inc.," by Jennifer Washburn and "Universities in
the Marketplace," by Stanford alumnus and for
mer Harvard President Derek Bok.
If American universities want the public to
support their rights to freedom of inquiry and ex
pression they must do a better job of convincing
us that they are truly in operation, as Stanford's
founding documents state, for"the promotion of
the public welfare."

Give Irshod Manji a 'fighting chance'
It appears to me that The Daily's editorial
board did not actually hear the lecture by Irshad
Manji ("Religious groups must seek more pro
ductive dialogue," April 28). Please give her a
fighting chance to prove her worthiness by read
ing her book. It's the least you can do before
making a judgment about whether or not she. or
the groups sponsoring her. are out to insult Islam.
You are members of an academic communi

tv. Your sole purpose should not be to make ev
eryone feel good but to explore thoughts and
ideas and to challenge assumptions whatever
they may be. Respectful dialogue should be wel
comed and encouraged so that all can have ac
cess to facts and truth. If ideas cannot be ex
plored and debated at Stanford — then where
can they be?

Computer science T-shirts are offensive
Recently, the computer science department
released its annual department T-shirt, which de
picts a line of about eight people, only one of
whom is female. Many of the computer science
students I have talked to are convinced that it is
funny and say that no one, not even any of the
women in computer science, think otherwise.
This seems quite perplexing to me. I am not a
computer science major, but as an engineering
student, there seems to be something very wrong
with singling out discrepancies in male and fe

male enrollments and putting it on the annual T
shirt for comic relief. If you were a female stu
dent in computer science, wouldn't it be trou
bling to see your minority status being displayed
on the chests of your primarily male classmates
for the purpose of humor?
