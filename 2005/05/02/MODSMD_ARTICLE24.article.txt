## The 						pursuit of ignorance 
### 
First of all, I have an apology to
make. A couple of weeks ago 1 wrote
something that, on reflection, was terri
bly offensive to a minority group that is,
understandably, a little sensitive.
I am, of course, referring to our very
own electrical engineers. 1 want to make
it clear that I am truly sorry for any of
fense caused. Judging by last week's let
ter to the editor, "Sivanandam should
look in the mirror" (April 25), (1 must

confess 1 haven't taken the advice; I've always found look
ing at oneself a rather depressing experience), 1 angered a
few of the solder-monkeys in the Packard building.
My regret knows no bounds. 1 should have realized that
EEs would be quick to anger. After all, who wouldn't be
filled with rage if they found themselves stuck studying
electrical engineering for half a decade?
Now on to other things:
Why are we here? Well obviously in some broader
sense, it's to further the cause of humanity, spread the word
of God — you choose which one — and get laid. However,
graduate school is a brief (well actually, a very long) hiatus
from these noble endeavors. Instead you're here to learn.
Learning is all very well, but I can't help but wish some
one had informed us exactly what we would be learning be
fore we got here.
Foolishly, I had assumed that one's knowledge of things
would expand as time went on. That the scope of things one
could talk intelligently about would broaden and deepen. 1
was wrong.
I've heard many people claim that struggling towards a
Ph.D. is that part of your academic career where you learn
more and more about less and less as the inexorable drive
to a thesis pushes you further into the bowels of specializa
tion.
This is not an inaccurate assessment, but it doesn't real
ly cover the whole experience. You see, grad school is also

a relentless march to ignorance, to knowing less and less
about more and more.
Somewhere in the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
trilogy, there's a scene involving a complex machine that
punishes people by making them aware of their terrifying
insignificance in the cosmos. This is basically what educa
tion does.
One starts off as a toddler slowly accumulating knowl
edge (hot things hurt, biting is not a respectable way to ex
press an opinion and so on) and then you move on through
various stages of schooling, gradually expanding one's
mind to fill it with all sorts of fun facts.
Eventually, one reaches the pinnacle of educational
glory: college. Here the splendor of the academic vista is fi
nally revealed. A daunting sight, but still one that appears
conquerable. Then grad school arrives and it all comes
crashing down.
One swiftly realizes that not only is knowing everything
impossible, so is knowing most things, or knowing some
things —or even knowing anything at all. In fact, that
whole Socrates thing of being certain of one's ignorance,
well, that's out of our range too — there's so much out
there that it's impossible even to begin to list one's defi
ciencies.
My favorite 17th century British physicist once wrote:
"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of
giants." A gracious sentiment, but sadly not one that ap
plies to all of us.
Rather than raising us to a height that affords us a
panoramic view of all that is known, the accumulated mass
of intellectual endeavor instead resembles a swamp of the
decomposing detritus of human thought, through which
one must wade in the desperate hope that something (use
ful) will stick. Good luck.

rect my prejudices? Email navins@stanford.edu with your
