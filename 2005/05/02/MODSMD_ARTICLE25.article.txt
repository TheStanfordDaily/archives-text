## Fade into Bolivian What happened to Youppi!? 
### 
As I eagerly await the arrival of my copy
of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II
(Revenge of the Ooze)" from Netflix,
I think I should have just enough time to write
an article for this week. As a multitude of read
ers may have noted (and by that, I of course
mean three), last week's article was conspicu
ously missing. In response to reader's wonder
ing what happened, the dates of April 15-26
were spent in Boston, N.Y., and D.C., where I
learned that the East Coast does not have com
puters. While computers do not exist, baseball
most certainly does, so my time was spent at
tending/watching games.
Thus, having been to more baseball games
in Washington, D.C. this quarter (2) than class
es at Stanford, and having been to more Wash
ington Nationals games than any student cur-

rently at Stanford, here is my
report on the state of base
hall in that city.
First, a few random notes
I gleaned from time at RFK
Stadium: Carlos Baerga and,
much more amazingly, Julio
Franco still play baseball.
Did anybody else get this
memo? I had pretty much as
sumed that Franco (who fin-

ished third in the Rookie of the Year Voting .
.. IN 1983!) had long since retired.
So how is the baseball experience in D.C.?
Simply, after watching a game in a stadium
better suited for football and ill-prepared for
the return of baseball after a 34-year absence,
1 can say the experience is sub-par. For exam
ple, at both games the concessions ran out of
food. There are no radios in the bathrooms nor
are there TVs by the concessions. Thus, if you
choose to purchase a deliciously salted food
product from one of the concession stands, you
also choose to miss the game. Other quibbles
include a scoreboard that is only viewable
from roughly 2 / 3 of the seats (and some seats
are physically behind the scoreboard), and
completely baffling to me, a running total of
strikeouts by Nationals' pitchers for the season
in lieu of a pitch count or other far more mean
ingful stats.
Minor problems? Certainly. Improvements
that could make the baseball experience bet
ter? Absolutely.
Next complaint: What happened to Youp
pi!? Apparently D.C. has some sorttof creative
impediment, as the Nationals are now the third
team in D.C. that has an eagle (although hon
estly, Screech the"eagle" is really a pigeon in
disguise) as a mascot. Despite my constant
calls to bring back Youppi! I was largely ig
nored by the RFK crowd which apparently
would rather take photos with a mascot born
out of an egg on Opening Day than lobby for
the return of the beloved Youppi! (Note: the !
in Youppi! is a necessary part of the mascot's
name and exhibits his excitable nature.)
