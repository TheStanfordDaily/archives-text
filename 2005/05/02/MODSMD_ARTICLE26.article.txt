# Rugby wins national title
## Stanford wins championship with wins over Princeton and Penn State at Steuber Field 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In front of a packed house at Steuber Rugby Stadium
and a live television audience, Stanford junior Olivia
Anglade struggled to describe how it felt to be a nation
al champion.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet," Anglade told a College
Sports Television reporter after Stanford dominated de
fending champion Penn State, 53-6, Saturday to capture
its first women's rugby title since 1999. "Maybe it will
sink in after a few beers tonight."
The Stanford women may still be pinching themselves
— and hungover — today, not because they ever doubt
ed that they could go all the way, but because they made
it so easy.
Stanford used its superior quickness to counter Penn
State's power throughout the match. Like most East
Coast teams, Penn State's biggest strength is its pack, but
the Nittany Lions had no answer for Stanford's speedy
wings, who were routinely in the open field en route to
break away tries and a 29-3 halftime lead.
And unlike Friday's 27-22 semifinal win over Prince
ton, in which the Cardinal built a 27-5 lead before hold
ing off a frantic Tigers rally, Stanford was in control for
all 80 minutes against Penn State.
"We remembered yesterday," freshman fly-half Jossy
Tseng said. "Once we were up at halftime we did not
want to let up."
And they didn't.
Sophomore Carey Myslewski tallied her third try of
the game 12 minutes into the second half and the con
version gave Stanford a 36-3 lead. The rest of the second
half included more of the same.
"We kept up the momentum in this game." said
Anglade, who scored a try on a long break away at the 22-
minute mark to increase Stanford's lead to 43-3.
Five minutes later, junior Victoria Folayan took a
pass from Anglade and raced down the right sideline to
push the lead to 48-3.
