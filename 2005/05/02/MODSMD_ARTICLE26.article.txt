# Rugby wins national title
## Stanford wins championship with wins over Princeton and Penn State at Steuber Field 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In front of a packed house at Steuber Rugby Stadium
and a live television audience, Stanford junior Olivia
Anglade struggled to describe how it felt to be a nation
al champion.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet," Anglade told a College
Sports Television reporter after Stanford dominated de
fending champion Penn State, 53-6, Saturday to capture
its first women's rugby title since 1999. "Maybe it will
sink in after a few beers tonight."
The Stanford women may still be pinching themselves
— and hungover — today, not because they ever doubt
ed that they could go all the way, but because they made
it so easy.
Stanford used its superior quickness to counter Penn
State's power throughout the match. Like most East
Coast teams, Penn State's biggest strength is its pack, but
the Nittany Lions had no answer for Stanford's speedy
wings, who were routinely in the open field en route to
break away tries and a 29-3 halftime lead.
And unlike Friday's 27-22 semifinal win over Prince
ton, in which the Cardinal built a 27-5 lead before hold
ing off a frantic Tigers rally, Stanford was in control for
all 80 minutes against Penn State.
"We remembered yesterday," freshman fly-half Jossy
Tseng said. "Once we were up at halftime we did not
want to let up."
And they didn't.
Sophomore Carey Myslewski tallied her third try of
the game 12 minutes into the second half and the con
version gave Stanford a 36-3 lead. The rest of the second
half included more of the same.
"We kept up the momentum in this game." said
Anglade, who scored a try on a long break away at the 22-
minute mark to increase Stanford's lead to 43-3.
Five minutes later, junior Victoria Folayan took a
pass from Anglade and raced down the right sideline to
push the lead to 48-3.

The Stanford women's rugby team, pictured above in a match earlier this season, defeated Penn State, 53-6, in
the National Championship game Saturday.
"I was so proud of our forwards
today," Tseng said. "They played so pow
erfully and got the ball to our hackline, so
we could move it wide."
"That's our strength, getting it wide,"
said Anglade, who finished with three
tries and was named Final Four MVP.
"Whoever finishes it. finishes it."
Graduate student Kelsey Lynn closed
out the Stanford scoring by punctuating a
long break away with a ball fake that
shook two Penn State defenders and freed
her for the try.
First-year coach Jonathan Griffin, who
guided England's Loughborough Univer
sity to the women's collegiate champi
onship before coming to Stanford, said
Saturday's win was every bit as exciting.
"This is as wonderful as that was,"he
said. "Each one's special. I'm just happy
for these girls. They put all the effort into
it."
Friday's semifinal win included a bit
more drama. Princeton took a 5-3 lead be
fore Stanford regained the lead in the
23rd minute and slowly increased the
margin over the final 17 minutes of the
first half.
One of Stanford's best scoring plays
came when Anglade broke away and
kicked the ball ahead of a would-be
Princeton tackier before managing to fall
on it fora try that put Stanford ahead 20-
5.
Stanford's defense managed to quiet
Princeton's top offensive threats in the
first half with strong tackles.
"We knew their 10 and their 13 [backs]
were effective, as part of their back line,"
Anglade said. "In the first half we did a
very good job of containing them."
But Princeton would not go down
without a fight, scoring 15 minutes into
the second half to cut the Stanford lead to
27-10.
"In the second half we got a little lazy
— we were up by a lot — which hurt us,"
Anglade said.
The Tigers scored on another five
meter play three minutes later to pull
within 27-17. but it was too little too late.
As the only team not from the Mid-At
lantic region in the Final Four, Stanford's
triumph represented a victory for West
Coast rugby as a whole.
"Nobody expected anything out of us,"
Anglade said. "But we always knew we
had a good team."
"West Coast rugby is here," Tseng
said.
And so is the national championship.
