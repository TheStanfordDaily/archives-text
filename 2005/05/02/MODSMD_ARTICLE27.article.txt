# It's a new day for football under Walt Harris
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Growing up in South San Francisco,
Walt Harris always had some idea that he
might end up in Palo Alto.
"1 was more of a Stanford [than a Cal]
fan," Harris said. "This was really were I
was hoping that I could end up."
It took nearly 35 years of coaching —
including a brief stint at the school across
the Bay — for Harris to land on the Farm.
But Harris, who inherits a team that has
gone 10-23 in the last three seasons under

former head coach Buddy Teevens, has no
small task ahead of him in turning Stan
ford into a team of national prominence.
Helping teams rebuild has been one of
Harris' strongest qualities in his 11 years as
a head coach. As the coach of his alma
mater. University of Pacific, in the early
90's Harris led the Tigers to an improved
record each season. His rebuilding success
was even more evident at Pittsburgh,
where he spent the last seven seasons as
the head coach. In his first season in 1997
he took the Panthers to their first bowl
since 1989 and earned the Big East Coach

of the Yepr award. £ j | j.
And while Pitt has gone to bowls for the
last five years, including the BCS Fiesta
Bowl last season, the Cardinal have failed
to make a postseason appearance since
2001.
"All I can say is this is a new day," Har
ris said.
Throughout the Stanford football pro
gram, Harris" influence is recognizable.
The Cardinal brought in seven new assis
tant coaches, most of them on offense, as
well as a different offensive system and a
whole new attitude.

"I think the biggest challenge
new staff and the players that WIS have is to
get our style across to them and get them
to execute it," Harris said. "I think our
players are excited about something dif
ferent. I think our players are excited to try
to get better, but I think how they go about
doing it is more of a struggle. I think we're
not there yet in reaching them, I'm sure we
reached some of them but we need to
reach all of them."
Not surprisingly, bringing change cer-
Harris comes home

tainly hasn't been easy. Through 15
days of spring practice, Harris has
struggled to get his new message
across to many of the players.
"What we teach is pretty basic,"
Harris said. "But sometimes it takes
time for players to decide to change
old habits and sometimes old habits
are hard to change."
While the progress may be slow,
there are early signs that Harris'
methods are getting through to
many of the players.
"The offense is getting a lot bet
ter," senior cornerback T.J. Rush
ing said after the Spring Game last
weekend. "It was a little slow be
cause it was a bunch to take in and
you can definitely see the improve
ment."
The spring practice style under
Harris gave many players who
didn't get a lot of playing time in
previous years a chance to work
their way into a more prominent
role. After the Spring Game the
coaching staff named four players
"Most Improved." All four players
— senior receiver Gerren Crochet,
junior fullback Nick Frank, junior
linebacker Michael Okwo and se
nior defensive tackle Casey Carroll
were not in the starting lineup
last season.
"All four of those guys distin
guished themselves as guys who
were very focused on doing what we
asked them to do and the excelled
in the way they played," 1 larrissaid.
While Harris sees that many new
players can take a bigger role on the
team this year, the strength may lie
in experience, especially on the de
fensive side of the ball.
"I think at this time we have
good senior leadership," Harris
said. "We have six seniors on de
fense that are capable of being good
to very good football players. I
think that we ought to have a
chance to be good on defense if the
offense can avoid turning the ball
over in an attempt to keep [the de
fense] off the field."
This comes despite the fact that
the Cardinal had five defensive
starters taken in the 2005 NFL
Draft.

The offense is another story. In
experience was a major factor in
many of last season's failures.
There will likely be only two start
ing seniors on the offensive side,
which is just one more than last
year. The senior, offensive lineman
Brian Head, was injured for the
spring practices, leaving the offense
without much veteran leadership.
"Any time you have a senior
who played a lot out it really hurts
you," Harris said. "We had no se
niors on offense — we were kind of
leaderless — like a boat without a
rudder. We had six seniors on de
fense. We had a lot of rudders over
there to guide all the other guys."
Despite the offense's lack of se
niors. Harris has proven that he can
find young players and turn them
into great ones. At Pittsburgh, Har
ris coached Larry Fitzgerald and
Antonio Bryant, two receivers who
won the Biletnikoff Award, given
to the nation's best receiver.
Boomer Esiason, Terry Glenn,
Eddie George and Orlando Pace
have also all played under Harris.
While the entire team knows it
still has work to do to improve on
last season's 4-7 record, there is a
pervading sense of optimism.
"When coach Harris got to Pitt
they were struggling and he turned
that place around," senior nose
tackle Babatunde Oshinowo said
after the Spring Game. "We really
needed that fresh beginning. Know
ing that he wants to do it the right
way or no way at all is very positive.
There is a lot of positive energy
around here."
"Our goal is just to get better and
to continue to sell this great univer
sity to more and more players out
there so we have the best possible
players on campus," Harris said.
"We always have a chance to be
successful. It just depends on how
accountable we want to be and how
quick we want to be a real good
team."
For now all Harris and his staff
can do is get ready for the start of
practices before next season, but
the team now knows, it is a new
dav.
