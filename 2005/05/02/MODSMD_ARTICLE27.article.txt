# It's a new day for football under Walt Harris

Growing up in South San Francisco,
Walt Harris always had some idea that he
might end up in Palo Alto.
"1 was more of a Stanford [than a Cal]
fan," Harris said. "This was really were I
was hoping that I could end up."
It took nearly 35 years of coaching —
including a brief stint at the school across
the Bay — for Harris to land on the Farm.
But Harris, who inherits a team that has
gone 10-23 in the last three seasons under

former head coach Buddy Teevens, has no
small task ahead of him in turning Stan
ford into a team of national prominence.

was even more evident at Pittsburgh,
where he spent the last seven seasons as
the head coach. In his first season in 1997
he took the Panthers to their first bowl
since 1989 and earned the Big East Coach

ris said.
Throughout the Stanford football pro
gram, Harris" influence is recognizable.
The Cardinal brought in seven new assis
tant coaches, most of them on offense, as
well as a different offensive system and a
whole new attitude.

"I think the biggest challenge
new staff and the players that WIS have is to
get our style across to them and get them
to execute it," Harris said. "I think our
players are excited about something dif
ferent. I think our players are excited to try
to get better, but I think how they go about
doing it is more of a struggle. I think we're
not there yet in reaching them, I'm sure we
reached some of them but we need to
reach all of them."
