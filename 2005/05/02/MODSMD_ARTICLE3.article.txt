# Exotic erotic tightens security
## University adds requirements for this year's party to ensure Exotic Erotic's safety and security 
### MEGAN WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
This year's Exotic Erotic party, hosted by 680 Lomita, is fac
ing stricter security requirements due to several breaches at
last year's event. Unlike in years past, only those with valid
SUIDs may enter the party, and organizers have been in
structed to increase the numbers of security personnel.
Junior Evan Hindman, social manager at the Row house
and this year's Exotic Erotic organizer, said the house had to
meet with Stanford's Committee on Public Events before
going ahead with planning. This is the first time the house staff
has had to meet with these officials before the event, which will
take place on May 21 from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Joey Greenwell, assistant director of student activities, said
he believes the meeting will yield positive results when it
comes to the planning and execution of the party. The com
mittee includes members from campus-wide groups, including
the Disability Resource Center and Events and Labor Ser
vices.
"They give feedback," Greenwell said. "It's not just me giv
ing support, but staff giving their expertise."
In addition to the meeting, the University has strengthened
security measures. The house is now required to hire 11
deputies and two special event police from the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety on the night of the party.
And while in the past one Stanford University identifica
tion card has allowed both the card's owner and a guest into the
party, this will no longer be the case. Because 680 Lomita only
has capacity for 1,000 people, many who show up will not be
able to enter or will end up spending the evening waiting in
line. For this reason, only those with valid SUIDs will gain
entry.
Greenwell said the party had to be shut down early last year
due to security concerns.
"Due to guests being inconsiderate, people broke through
the fencing," he said. "The major problem was crowd manage
ment. The party planners last year were the ones who shut the
party down because the security was broken though."
While the new party rules will cost both more money and ef
fort, Hindman said that the residents of 680 Lomita under
stand the need for extra precautions.
"Before we went ahead with the planning we had a meeting
with all of the residents to ask if they were behind it," Hindman
said. "The answer was a resounding yes."
He added that the house's staff and resident have already
invested an enormous amount of time and funding into the
planning and execution of the party, which was once named
one of the top 10 college parties by Playboy magazine.
"The only way that the party can be a success is if everyone

who attends the party takes personal responsibility for their ac
tions and respects the rules and regulations that have been im
plemented," Hindman said. "A few selfish individuals could
ruin the party for everyone, and that is exactly what we are try
ing to avoid."
Senior Emily Carter, a resident assistant at 680 Lomita,
echoed Hindman's sentiments.
"Our staff has talked a lot about it and we're pretty much all
on the same page," she said. "We really hope that the student
body sees this as a chance to show the University that this is im
portant. If this is going to continue, 680 needs the help of the
student body."
