# No. 4 Softball splits long road weekend
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
After a frustrating shutout loss to No. 10
UCLA (25-15, 6-9 Pacific-10 Conference) in
the first half of a doubleheader, the No. 4 Stan
ford Softball squad (37-11, 10-5) wasn't about
to be embarrassed in front of a national audi
ence yesterday. With ESPN2's camera captur
ing every pitch at UCLA fora tape-delayed
broadcast, the Cardinal put on a worthy show,
coming behind to win the second game, 5-3,
with a couple of home runs in the seventh
paving the way to victory.
"In the first game, we all got A little down,
but in the second game we had more energy
and were able to come back," freshman hurler
Becky McCullough said.
Stanford and UCLA took the field for Sun :
day's second game having split the two previ
ous meetings of the weekend. In the first game
of yesterday's doubleheader Stanford junior
Laura Severson suffered an upsetting 8-0 loss.
It wasn't that Severson was off her mark — all
eight runs came unearned. Rather, it was that
Stanford couldn't find its rhythm at the plate.
"It was a little bit rushed and a bad way to
start off the day." McCullough said, adding
that the most important thing was how the Car
dinal responded to the loss.
Just when it looked like the Cardinal would
suffer through yet another upset in the Pac-10,
the bats finally came around.
"We took that loss and we used it to fuel us
for the next game," freshman Michelle Smith
said.
Freshman Erin Howe's single in the sixth
cut the Bruin lead to 3-2, but the Cardinal
would still have some work to do in the come
from-behind win. Stanford senior Megan Sick
ler led off the seventh with a dinger to tie the
game. 3-3.
Three batters later and with junior short
stop Lauren Lappin aboard. Smith's homer
put the Cardinal up, 5-3, but the third baseman
downplayed her clutch hit.
"It wasn't as much pressure as other people
would think," Smith said. "The pitcher just
gave me a good pitch. It was a team effort and
I just happened to be the one up to bat."
The freshman's ISth home run puts her well
ahead of most competition for the home run
title in the conference.
McCullough kept the Bruin offense at bay
and pitched for her second win against UCLA
this weekend, noting that her drop ball was her

go-to pitch in both games. But she also added
that there were other key factors in the Cardi
nal's success.
"We were in a couple games where we
could have gotten drained mentally, especially
against UCLA but everyone stepped up at cer
tain times and never let up," McCullough said.
Both offenses came alive on Saturday,
though the Bruins' five-run third wasn't
enough to overcome the 7-0 lead Stanford built
by the second inning. The game, which was
also aired by ESPN2, looked like Stanford
would run away with the victory' in the first in
ning.
Junior centerfielder Catalina Morris
reached first with a leadoff single and Lappin's
hit to leftfield followed. A flyout by Smith
moved the runners up and a walk by UCLA's
Angelica Selden put senior catcher Leah Nel
son on. The rally continued when sophomore
leftfielder Jackie Rinehart singled up the mid
dle for two RBI. Stanford continued the as
sault as Howe blasted one to right field to clear
the bases.
The 5-0 hole the Bruins found themselves in
only got deeper when Stanford added two
more runs in its half of the second. Morris got
on base again and Smith followed with a
homer to left.
UCLA finally got into the swing of things in
the third inning, scoring five runs against Mc-
Cullough. though only two of them were
earned. After a Cardinal error loaded the
bases, and with three runs already in, Krista
Coburn's double pushed two more Bruin runs
across the plate to cut Stanford's lead to 7-5.
McCullough shut the Bruins down from
then on, and for the next four innings the fans
witnessed a pitcher's duel as Stanford was able
to hold on for the win.
Stanford arrived in UCLA on a sour note
after falling to No. 22 Washington (27-16,7-7)
on Friday. Lappin hit a two-run home run to
put the Cardinal ahead 3-2 after the Huskies
took an early lead off of McCullough. Kristen
Rivera's 73rd career round tripper tied the
game for Washington, which would take back
the lead against Severson. The Cardinal made
it close with one more run, but Ashely Boek
picked up the win in Washington's 6-4 victory.
Stanford weni 2-2 during its busy weekend,
a two-city road trip that took the team up-and
down the West Coast. With its road schedule
now finished, the Cardinal look ahead to a six
game homestand beginning next week against
the Oregon schools.
