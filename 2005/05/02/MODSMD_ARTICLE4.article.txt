# NomCom accepts applications

### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
Today is the last day for students to
apply to sit on Board of Trustees com
mittees, which evaluate confidential
university issues, and next Wednesday
is the deadline for students to apply to
sit on University committees, which are
specialized to address individual cam

pus issues.
University committees make up a
branch of the ASSU and allow student
members to offer their opinions direct
ly to administrators. There are more
than 40 standing committees convened
by the Academic Council, the Provost,
the President and other offices. These
advisory bodies range from the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies to the

KZSU Advisory Board, from the
Board of Judicial Affairs to the Fresh
man Parking Permit Waiver Commit
tee. Each committee requires a differ
ent number of student members. Uni
versity committees can have as many
as 30 student members or as few as
two.
While University committees
generally make policy recommen
dations, the Board of Trustees
committees do not typically make
recommendations, but are higher
level organizational boards. The
five Board of Trustees committees
each include one undergraduate
and one graduate student.
Chemistry graduate student
Justin Litchfield, a sitting member
of the Nominations Commission,
said that the Board of Trustees
committees "deal with much more
broad issues such as maintaining a
diverse environment conducive to
learning or the general business
management of the University."
Alternatively, in a University com
mittee, Litchfield said students are
"able to actively shape University
policy on very specific issues, such
as undergraduate housing, student
activities and organizational con
duct."
To serve on any University

committee, a student must be reg
istered and on-campus during the
term they serve.
Applications to sit on these
groups will be reviewed by the
ASSU Nominations Commission,
or NomCom, which will interview
the candidates and then nominate
them to sit on the committees
based on their preferences and
background. For Board of
Trustees committees, preference is
given to applicants who have never
served on such an advisory body.
NomCom member Amanda
Marshall, a freshman, said that stu
dents should consider applying to
sit on committees regardless of
their background or interests.
"We will seek to appoint people
who can share a variety of experi
ences with the administration," she
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Students complain about admin
istrative red tape or about policies
that go into affect without their
input. By appointing student reps,
NomCom helps to break down this
perceived barrier and allows stu
dents and the administration to
communicate directly."
Litchfield said he believes stu

dents have a lot to gain from serv
ing on both Board of Trustees and
University committees compared
to the relatively minor time com
mitment. He pointed out that the
frequency of meetings varies be
tween several times per quarter
and a couple of times per year,
based on the group.
"The most valuable thing that
students will get from it is, in my
opinion, a chance to influence Uni
versity policy," Litchfield said.
"Students have the opportunity to
serve on a highly focused group
and really make themselves heard.
Learning about how policy is made
on these panels is also valuable."
He added that the University
benefits from students' presence
on the various committees because
it allows them to make better-in
formed decisions.
"These committees exist to con
tinually improve student life and
interacting with students is critical
to their success," Litchfield said.
"Clearly nobody wants stodgy old
University officials making poli
cies without the insight of the
young, hip and ultra-wise students
whom these will affect."
