# Foster care project promotes higher ed
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Homelessness, unemployment
and low college matriculation rates
are just a few of the problems that
foster kids face and that a group of
Stanford students — the Stanford
Foster Care College Project — are
hoping to remedy.
About 12 to 15 students in the un
dergraduate student body are for
mer foster youths, project members
said. In fact, the group itself was
founded by one such student, senior
Johnny Madrid.
Currently in its second year, the
project's goal is to train social
workers, court-appointed special
advocates and others who work
with foster youth to improve edu
cation rates.
"Hopefully we can work on mak
ing this sustainable for the future,"
said the project's current director,
junior Ben Elberger. He has been
involved in the project since he went
on an Alternative Spring Break trip
last year during which he learned
about the various issues that foster
youth face.
Elberger said that it is "the en
joyment of knowing that I'm work
ing towards that goal of improving
life outcomes of foster youth," that
drives him and the other students

who volunteer their time for this
project. Six students are involved as
trainers right now, he said.
Madrid said he started the pro
ject because he felt the legitimacy of
Stanford could help to create a dif
ference on a macro level for kids in
the foster care system.
"I don't think anybody has ever
come up with a good solution to fos
ter care," Madrid said. "But oije
thing that is incredibly beneficial-i$
when kids go to college — thaCs
their way out."
The project was created in two
parts. First, students did a literature
review of academic articles pertain
ing to higher education outcomes
for foster youth. The research
helped them create an original cur
riculum.
"If you don't have someone
there, it is really hard to get to col
lege," said junior Cassandra Cuel
lar, one of the project's members. "1
am lucky I found someone, and I
want it to be easier to get to college,
because not everyone can find a role
model."
The second part of the project is
the training, which utilizes the cur
riculum the students put together.

scheduled for tomorrow.
The training events generally
begin with icebreakers related to sit
uations that Coster youth face, El
berger said. Then there are intro
ductory activities about the national
goals of foster care and barriers to
higher education that foster youth
confront.
"People in their everyday lives
don't really think about how diffi
cult it would be not to have parents
guiding you or people believing in

you," said Cuellar, who has been in
volved in the project since last year.
The sessions close with a dis
cussion of specific problems such
as retention, college admissions
and the different roles that people
who work with foster youth could
play. Then the group provides rec
ommendations for how to deal
with these problems — such as en
couraging foster youth to attend
college, providing them with in
formation on financial aid and
connecting them with reliable
mentors.
"The activities are interactive,"
Elberger said, "It's not so much that
we give recommendations, but more
like we put out a framework and try

to guide them towards what the re
search suggests are good ideas."
This week the project is recruit
ing students to fill six positions as
trainers and one position as an eval
uation director. The students select
ed will conduct 12 training sessions
throughout the next academic year,
and the evaluation director will
work with reviews of the trainings to
improve the project systematically.
Cuellarsaid she became involved
with the program because of her
personal experience.
"The trainings are to get people
to realize these kids need someone
there to help them, they need to be a
focus point, they need to be trying to
make success stories," she said.
