# Foster care project promotes higher ed
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Homelessness, unemployment
and low college matriculation rates
are just a few of the problems that
foster kids face and that a group of
Stanford students — the Stanford
Foster Care College Project — are
hoping to remedy.
About 12 to 15 students in the un
dergraduate student body are for
mer foster youths, project members
said. In fact, the group itself was
founded by one such student, senior
Johnny Madrid.
Currently in its second year, the
project's goal is to train social
workers, court-appointed special
advocates and others who work
with foster youth to improve edu
cation rates.
"Hopefully we can work on mak
ing this sustainable for the future,"
said the project's current director,
junior Ben Elberger. He has been
involved in the project since he went
on an Alternative Spring Break trip
last year during which he learned
about the various issues that foster
youth face.
Elberger said that it is "the en
joyment of knowing that I'm work
ing towards that goal of improving
life outcomes of foster youth," that
drives him and the other students

who volunteer their time for this
project. Six students are involved as
trainers right now, he said.
Madrid said he started the pro
ject because he felt the legitimacy of
Stanford could help to create a dif
ference on a macro level for kids in
the foster care system.
"I don't think anybody has ever
come up with a good solution to fos
ter care," Madrid said. "But oije
thing that is incredibly beneficial-i$
when kids go to college — thaCs
their way out."
The project was created in two
parts. First, students did a literature
review of academic articles pertain
ing to higher education outcomes
for foster youth. The research
helped them create an original cur
riculum.
"If you don't have someone
there, it is really hard to get to col
lege," said junior Cassandra Cuel
lar, one of the project's members. "1
am lucky I found someone, and I
want it to be easier to get to college,
because not everyone can find a role
model."
The second part of the project is
the training, which utilizes the cur
riculum the students put together.
There have been three training ses
sions so far and a fourth session is
