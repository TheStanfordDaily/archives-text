# Veritas Forum prompts religious discussion
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Veritas Forum, a five-day Christian event
that organizers call an "opportunity for the entire
university community to explore and discuss life's
hardest questions," will take place this week. And
while they say the events will "welcome and honor
skeptics and their questions," some groups on cam

pus disagree that open debate is encouraged.
The forum, which began yesterday and runs
until Thursday, will bring together professors and
scholars from across the country to discuss topics
ranging from the reliability of the New Testament
to miracles to Intelligent Design â€” the last of
which contends that nature is shaped by an intelli
gent force rather than natural selection.
Organized by the on-canipus Christian group

Mosaic, the forum will mainly present issues from a
Christian perspective. The coordinators' "biggest
desire is to foster a truly academic setting where in
quiry happens." said Steve Stenstrom, an advisor to
Mosaic from Kingdom First Ministries.
Bruce Huber, another Mosaic advisor and col
lege pastor at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church,
cited tonight's discussion entitled
"The Question of Authority" as an
example of this desire to "bring dif
ferent voices to the table."
At the event. Comparative Litera
ture Prof. Richard Rorty and Univer
sity of Southern California Philoso
phy Prof. Dallas Willard will speak
on a panel moderated by Dean for
Religious Life Scotty McLennan.
Both Rorty and Willard are
"enormously influential in their
fields," Huber said, adding that
Willard will talk from a Christian per
spective, while Rorty will present a
secular point of view.
However, members of other stu
dent groups, such as the humanist
group Rational Thought, said that
the forum will not adequately repre
sent other beliefs.
"We are concerned about the sci
entific integrity of the events," said
physics graduate student Martin
Mueller, president of Rational
Thought. Mueller said his group
mostly objects to the talks on Intelli

gent Design, which will be given
today at William R. Hewlett Teach
ing Center in room 200 by Lehigh
University Biochemistry Prof.
Michael Behe.
"[The Intelligent Design commu
nity] is known to use questionable
methods to arrive at answers they al
ready know, namely, that there is a
creator," Mueller said. "Their scien
tific principles have been examined
by other scientists and even other
clergy, and been found to be lacking."
Although members of Rational
Thought disagree with Behe, author
of "Darwin's Black Box," a book that
defends the Intelligent Design argu
ment, Mueller said many will attend
his talks to ask critical questions and
to "let attendees know that not all talk
should be accepted at face value."
Stenstrom said he thinks the talks
on Intelligent Design "will probably
be attended by a wider range of peo
ple," while some of the earlier day
time events may target a more Chris
tian audience.
He added that Mosaic had not en
countered any opposition in planning
the forum.
The first Veritas forum took place
at Harvard University in 1992 and has
since spread to over 50 campuses na

tionwide. This is Stanford's fourth
time hosting the forum.
"[Veritas] is definitely a very pop
ular event each time, probably be
cause of Stanford's name,- which
helps in drawing prominent folks,"
Huber said.
