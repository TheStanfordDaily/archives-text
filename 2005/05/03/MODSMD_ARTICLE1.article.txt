# Apple lets loose of new OS X 10.4 Tiger

### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Were it not for the florescent lights in
side and the iMacs in the window display,
one could have mistaken the Apple store
in downtown Palo Alto fora dance club
on Friday night. A long line of people
trailed out the door — and around the
corner of the block — as two large men
dressed in black regulated entry into the
store.
What was the reason for the buzz? The
global release of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, the
newest operating system for Apple com
puters. To prepare for the release, 105
Apple stores around the world closed at 5
p.m. (local times) and reopened at 6 p.m.
for the premiere. Store staff gave away
scratchcards to customers as they walked
in, giving them a chance to win a new
Powerßook G4 computer, an iPod or
iTunes songs.
Many loyal Mac users awaited the re
lease of Apple?s latest operating system.
"It's my tradition to go to the release
of every [Mac OS X] upgrade," explained
Palo Alto resident Tom French, it's a lot
of fun."
Junior Brad Moore, a resident com
puter consultant at Cardenal, attended

the release with a few residents from his
dorm. He said he came away from the
presentation impressed.
"I think it's a dramatic leap forward,"
said Moore. "This upgrade puts Mac OS
X squarely forward in front of Microsoft's
Windows operating system."
Although the release enticed hardcore
Mac fans to view the newest upgrade,
many Bay Area residents — including
Stanford students — stopped by the Mac
store out of curiosity. Senior Michelle
Lee, a symbolic systems major, was out to
dinner with some friends when she saw
the line.
"I'd never been to an OS X launch,
and I'd always wanted to do that," Lee
said. "I had read the review and was in
terested in checking out the product."
The newest upgrade of the Mac oper
ating system comes 18 months after the
last release, dubbed Panther. Tiger,
which costs $129, offers 200 new innova
tions. The most notable features that dis
tinguish Tiger from Panther are Spot
light, a tool that enables users to search
for files more efficiently, and Dash
board, which runs mini-programs on
users' screens.
