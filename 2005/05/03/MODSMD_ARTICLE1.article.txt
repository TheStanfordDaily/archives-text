# Apple lets loose of new OS X 10.4 Tiger
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Were it not for the florescent lights in
side and the iMacs in the window display,
one could have mistaken the Apple store
in downtown Palo Alto fora dance club
on Friday night. A long line of people
trailed out the door — and around the
corner of the block — as two large men
dressed in black regulated entry into the
store.
What was the reason for the buzz? The
global release of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, the
newest operating system for Apple com
puters. To prepare for the release, 105
Apple stores around the world closed at 5
p.m. (local times) and reopened at 6 p.m.
for the premiere. Store staff gave away
scratchcards to customers as they walked
in, giving them a chance to win a new
Powerßook G4 computer, an iPod or
iTunes songs.
Many loyal Mac users awaited the re
lease of Apple?s latest operating system.
"It's my tradition to go to the release
of every [Mac OS X] upgrade," explained
Palo Alto resident Tom French, it's a lot
of fun."
Junior Brad Moore, a resident com
puter consultant at Cardenal, attended

the release with a few residents from his
dorm. He said he came away from the
presentation impressed.
"I think it's a dramatic leap forward,"
said Moore. "This upgrade puts Mac OS
X squarely forward in front of Microsoft's
Windows operating system."
Although the release enticed hardcore
Mac fans to view the newest upgrade,
many Bay Area residents — including
Stanford students — stopped by the Mac
store out of curiosity. Senior Michelle
Lee, a symbolic systems major, was out to
dinner with some friends when she saw
the line.
"I'd never been to an OS X launch,
and I'd always wanted to do that," Lee
said. "I had read the review and was in
terested in checking out the product."
The newest upgrade of the Mac oper
ating system comes 18 months after the
last release, dubbed Panther. Tiger,
which costs $129, offers 200 new innova
tions. The most notable features that dis
tinguish Tiger from Panther are Spot
light, a tool that enables users to search
for files more efficiently, and Dash
board, which runs mini-programs on
users' screens.

Eager customers line up in front of the Apple store in Palo Alto for the Mac's Tiger.
"Spotlight is a search mechanism for your
entire system, kind of like Google for your
desktop, but it's literally built right into the
operating system, so whenever your creating
or moving around files, they are automatical
ly indexed on the spot," said junior Tristan
Harris, who worked with Apple on develop
ing Dashboard this summer.
For people who have a hard time organiz
ing files on their computer, Spotlight will
prove to be useful, Harris said.
"I think Spotlight is what people are going
to be really happy about in the end. as far as
affecting the 'digital lives' of students on
campus," he said. "Apple is trying to get peo
ple away from having to deal with the pletho
ra of files that exist on our system."
Dashboard, "a pretty piece of eye candy,"
as described by Harris, brings up a variety of
useful programs nicknamed "widgets" to the
desktop with the push of the Fl2 key. These
applications include a currency converter,
weather forecast tool, flight tracker and dic
tionary. These all update when connected to
the Internet, and users can download new
Dashboard programs from the Mac Web site
and other sites.
"Instead of forcing people to go through
all this clumsy software, banner ads and
poorly made Web sites," Harris explained.
Dashboard can simplify a computer user's
life by putting it all at one's fingertips.
On Friday, some students came only to
see the product — not to buy.
"The Apple store doesn't offer the educa
tional discount that the [Stanford] Bookstore
does," explained senior Alex Kehlenbeck, a
math major.

While the newest release has generated a
good amount of hype, some Mac users said
they are a little peeved at having to upgrade
on a yearly basis.
"Do I really want to pay $129 every year
for the next version of Mac OS X?," wrote
John Siracusa in a Nov. 2003 article in the
software review Web site Ars Technica.
"Worse, do 1 really want to deal with the in
evitable upgrade hassles and 10.x.0 release
bugs every single year? Is it worth it, or is a
major OS upgrade every year simply too
much, too often?"
So is this new upgrade enough for PC
users to switch from a PC to a Mac?
The debate is still up in the air.
Moore, who switched to Macs around the
time of the first release of Mac OS X, said he
enjoys working with Macs.
When asked what he likes about Macs,
Moore said, "The attention to detail, the user
interface, the incredible new search capabili
ties — and that everything just works."
Senior Kevin Christopher, an RCC at
Alondra, still owns a PC "because they are
generally cheaper," but agrees with Moore
that Macs are less prone to problems.
But Christopher said he prefers PCs be
cause they are easier to fix.
"If something goes wrong with a PC, you
can take it apart," he said. "It's like being
able to open up a car and fix the different
components. Macs are designed not to be
taken apart: they have higher quality engi
neering because they're supposed to fail less.
So it's a trade-off."
