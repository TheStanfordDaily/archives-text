U.S. nationalism in wartime. Below
is an excerpt:
" i hope that in the next war peo
ple will avoid the mistake of being
patriotic. I think 1 may say this be
cause I was one of the damned fools
who was in 1917/ Thus stated Pro
fessor Richard T. LaPiere in an in
formal discussion last night spon
sored by the International Relations
Club.
"He said in time of war. people
should think as individuals and not
as a mass. If they did. they would re
alize that they had nothing at all to
gain, and would refuse to light.
" 'People think in terms of
drama, and must have a villain for
their drama of the causes of war.
Therefore they pick the munition
makers to fill this role. But these are
not to blame," said LaPiere. "We
are, because we allow a lot of anti
quated, inexpedient ideals about
courage and heroism to be fostered

on us. It the people would refuse to
light, there would be no war.'
"Alter the lecture there was open
discussion in which LaPiere an
swered questions from the floor."
On May 3, 1990, The Daily pub
lished the story "Many women ath
letes receive obscene calls" about an
anonymous male placing sexually
explicit calls to female varsity athletes
at Stanford. Below is an excerpt:
"An anonymous man has been
telephoning several varsity women
athletes with the promise of a sexual
phone fantasy, according to mem
bers of various teams.
"Several women from the swim,
golf, basketball and other teams
have reported receiving a call or
calls from a man who claims to be
from a company called Fantasies
Unlimited. Because of their similar
content and nature, the calls are be
lieved to have been made by the
same person.
