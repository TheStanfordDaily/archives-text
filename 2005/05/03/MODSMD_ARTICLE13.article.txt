# Social Innovation
## Witnessing human rights 
### 
"See it. Film it. Change it." This is the
catchphrase of WITNESS, a human rights
organization founded in 1992 by musician
Peter Gabriel. WITNESS helps front-line
human rights organizations use video and
other media in their advocacy work.
The social innovator we interviewed
this week is the executive director of WIT
NESS, Gillian Caldwell, a lawyer and
filmmaker.
The Daily: What's the big idea' behind
WITNESS?

Gillian Caldwell: WITNESS is the first
and only organization at a global level to
provide video cameras to human rights or
ganizations. We also give them technical
and tactical guidance to use video to cre
ate change. I think the biggest problem in
human rights advocacy is that small,
under-resourced human rights organiza
tions are having difficulty getting traction
around the problems they face. WIT
NESS helps them make effective use of
media in their advo-

cacy work.
Bigger human
rights organizations
based in the West
are getting more and
more savvy in terms
of integrating media
into their campaign,
and they should.
What worries me
is what happens to
the smaller, less
well-funded organi
zations operating

under repressive circumstances a long way
from here. Those organizations are really
the frontlines against the kind of oppres
sion and abuse that we see happening
around the world.
TD: Once an organization collects footage
of human rights abuses, how is it used to
create change?
GC: Sometimes it's used for grassroots ed
ucation and mobilization. Sometimes it's
used for evidentiary submission fora
court or tribunal. Sometimes it's to work
with the media. And sometimes it's fora
screening before a key decision-maker
with the power to make a difference.
What is consistent in every campaign is
that we have online calls to action each
month, with new video broadcasts at our
Web site. One of the ways that students
and others can get involved in our work is
to go online and sign up fora free mem
bership. It's a very simple way to get alert
ed and commit to taking action on a vari
ety of issues around the world.
TD: WITNESS is involved in a number of
different human rights campaigns. What
campaign are you most proud of?
GC: Our project on the California Youth
Authority is one we have high hopes for
and that is very pertinent to California.
We are working with the Ellen Baker
Center for Human Rights on a project
called "Books Not Bars." It is an effort to
push fora complete overhaul of the Cali
fornia Youth Authority. We're trying to
close the biggest penal juvenile facilities in
the state and to replace them with the
community-based model along the lines of
Missouri's model.
TD: Before joining WITNESS, you spent
to two years with the Global Survival Net
work. What draws you to work on human
rights issues?
GC: I've been doing social justice as long
as 1 can remember. I began actively when
1 was 12, when 1 was coordinating my high
school Amnesty chapter.
It never occurred to me to work in a
private law firm. When I went to law
school, my intention was to get the credi
bility and the degree I would need to be
able to do systems-changing work at a pol
icy level.
TD: What advice do you have for students
interested in getting involved?
GC: Get creative and get energetic. There
are so many organizations that are fasci
nating places to work and develop a skill
set but may just take a little bit more ener
gy to identify.
The bottom line is that every individu
al has the capacity to make a difference.
That is the belief WITNESS is built on and
is organized around. We make it possible
for people who care to make a difference.

McHugh will slowly lose touch after they
graduate this June. If you're interested in
