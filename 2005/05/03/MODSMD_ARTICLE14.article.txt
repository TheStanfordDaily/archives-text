# Low student landline usage may change next fall
## 
### AMANDA MITCHELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kim Vinh has not used a landline phone connection through
out her five years at Stanford. A co-terminal student in the School
of Education, she instead has relied exclusively on a cell phone.
Students like Vinh have become the norm at Stanford, with an
increasing number of students choosing to forgo the cost of land
line charges in favor of the greater flexibility and long distance op
tions of cell phone plans. Many students see no need to have both
a cellular and landline connection. That may change next year
when student in-room network connection and landline tele
phone fees are combined into one service charge.
"Before 1 came to graduate school here, 1 had a cell for mobile
and long-distance reasons but had the landline as my primary
number," said Cliff Redeker, a first-year graduate student in
Management Sciences and Engineering. "I guess I've jumped on
the wireless bandwagon, as nearly everyone now has. It's a lot
more useful, and it generally is cheaper and more convenient to
have a cell only."
Approximately 50 percent of undergraduates and 75 percent
of graduate students have landline phones, according to the Res
idential Computing Web site.
Freshman Andy Zimbroff subscribed to a landline because he
was not sure of the reception quality of cell phone services in the
Stanford area. He also wanted to have the ability to use his fax
machine. However, he commented that his phone usage does not
add up to the $ 13.95 monthly fees to subscribe to a campus phone.
While many students rely on a family plan with free night and
weekend minutes to keep in touch with family and friends from
home, freshman Nicholas Jackson said that since his cell phone
contract was set a few years ago, before his cell phone usage in
creased heavily, using his landline is a more cost-effective
method.
"I got a landline so that people from the Disability Resource
Center could contact me," freshman Nicholas Jackson said. "And
I use it every day to call friends, family and the golf cart services
to get to I-Hum lecture."
A decreasing use of landlines has diminished the popularity of
the Door King system, a campus-wide service that allows students
to buzz-in visitors using a landline connection. Most students say
they do not miss the service.
"1 haven't used Door King or experienced any problems with
out it this year," said freshman Danielle Wong. "Because almost
everyone has a cell phone, they just call when they need to be let
in the dorm."
More students may opt fora landline next year due to a new
plan brought by Internet Technology Systems and Services and
Residential Computing that will require all residential students,
except those living in Schwab, to subscribe to both phone and In
ternet services.
"When I have a landline next year, I might be more inclined to
use Door King, but because people in dorms open the door for
outsiders anyway, I don't think I'll be using it much," Wong said.
Many students have expressed concern about the extra
charges, as the combined Internet and phone service will cost $48
per quarter compared to the $36 per quarter students can pay this
year for just an Internet connection. Students who plan to use ei
ther service or those who choose to just use one no longer have
the option of waving the costs.
"I would rather just pay the Internet fee," Wong said. "I might
bring a phone to college because I'm paying for the landline any
way. but it makes more sense for students to pay for what they re
ally need instead of having to pay for services they wouldn't oth
erwise use."
"I really am not supportive of the new plan," Wurzburg said.
"It is forcing half of the student body to pay for something they
don't want."
Most students who currently do not have a landline said they
will continue to rely primarily on cellular communication next
year.
"Cell phones are more convenient than the mix of cell phones
and landlines." Wong said. "In the future, I think there will be
many more cell phone users than landline users, at least among
college students. In college, you're always on the move and do dif
ferent things each day. If you have your cell phone with you, you
can go anywhere and still be available to your friends, family, etc.
Landlines are just much more inflexible."
