# Co-ed rooms found mostly at co-ops

### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
The Draw deadline has passed,
and with it countless hours of confu
sion and even tears over draw-group
decision-making. Often related to
this so-called "Draw-ma" is the ques
tion of whether or not to form co-ed
groups, especially since many stu
dents have close friendships with
members of the opposite sex.
The handbook provided by Stan
ford' Residential and Dining Enter
prises, or R&DE, states the policy on
mixed-gender groups as follows: "A
group containing both men and
women may, if they wish, apply for
housing as a group. In practice, how
ever, there may not be much to be
gained by doing this because the
Draw assigns men's and women's
housing spaces in two completely
separate runs. Therefore, a mixed
gender group will be treated as two
completely separate groups."
Even so, a sizable number of stu
dents decide to apply in mixed-gen
der groups every year, said Todd
Benson, director of housing assign
ment services. And while the Uni
versity allows these applications, it
does not permit mixed-gender
roommate pairings, he added.
The major reason the Draw as
signs male and female spaces sepa
rately is that residences must deter
mine the number of spaces available
for each gender before any assign
ments are made. The number of

spaces allotted to each gender in any
given residence is determined by
three factors: the number and loca
tions of bathrooms, the size of indi
vidual riwrns and the requirement
that no room be occupied by mixed
gender roommates.
The R&DE Web site claims it
would be too difficult to combine
male and female students into a sin
gle housing lottery. Currently, the
only way to room with friends of the
opposite sex is to rent an apartment
off-campus.
However, many undergraduate
students have also been able to re
side with members of the opposite
sex by posing as couples and apply
ing for housing in Escondido Village
studio apartments. However, before
this housing is granted, the students
applying must interview with hous
ing officials and prove that they are
in fact in a stable relationship.
While Stanford does not allow co
ed rooms in most residences, students
in many co-ops on campus choose to
room with students of the opposite
sex. Officially, every room must be
single sex, but co-ed rooms do exist
when all students voluntarily agree,
said a Kairos. No one is ever forced to
live in a co-ed room if they feel un
comfortable with the situation.
"Living with girls is absolutely
great," said a male Terra resident.
"It's always hard to find a good
roommate and on the whole girls
tend to be a little neater and nicer
smelling."

However, he said he can see how
rooming with someone of the oppo
site sex could easily go wrong.
"1 think most of the people who
want to live with someone of anoth
er gender can be accommodated by
the co-ops on campus," he said.
"Being able to live with someone of
another gender in a mature and
workable way means that both peo
ple have to have their heads on
straight where questions of gender,
sexual orientation, etc. are con
cerned. Sadly, this doesn't seem to
be the case in the general housing
population."
The Terra resident added that if a
student really wants to room with
someone of the opposite sex. he or
she will almost always be able to do
so in one of the co-ops.
Other universities across the
country have started allowing mixed
gender rooms. At Brown University,
for example, freshmen have the op
portunity to draw into housing gen
der-blind, according to Brown's Of
fice of Residential Life Web site.
Brown also designates some suites as
optionally co-ed, but each room with
in the suite must be occupied by stu
dents of a single gender.
Haverford College in Pennsylva
nia and Hampshire College in Mass
achusetts also allow co-ed rooms.
Similarly, Swarthmore College in
Pennsylvania allows co-ed rooms,
but advises students not room with
their significant others unless they
are married.
