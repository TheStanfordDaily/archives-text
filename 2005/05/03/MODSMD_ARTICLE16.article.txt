## Editorial A
						welcome financial aid announcement 
### 
Stanford President John Hennessy re
cently announced that by 2010, families
earning less than $45,000 per year will not be
asked to contribute any money to their
child's undergraduate education (" Tuition
to be waived for low-income admits," April
26). Although, as Provost John
Etchemendy acknowledged, the new policy
only affects "a relatively small number of
students." it's still the right move for the
University. The decision reaffirms Stan
ford's commitment to providing a quality
education to people regardless of economic
backgrounds.
At the same time, it's important to keep
Etchemendy's words in mind before we
sing Stanford's praises too loudly. The new
policy is a nice gesture — and that's basi
cally what it is. After all. if a student's fami
ly earns less than $45.(XH) a year, it's very
likely that a significant proportion of the
cost is already covered by financial aid.
1 lennessy's announcement makes the Uni
versity's commitment to low-income stu
dents a little bit larger and a little bit clear
er — in Etchemendy's words, "it has a huge
advantage of being easier to explain."
In other words, this new policy will
probably be most significant as a clever
public relations move — in the best sense
of the word. Stanford's sister institutions,
such as Harvard, have had similar policies
in place for several years, and Stanford
might have appeared a little cold-hearted
and stingy in comparison. Hennessy's an

nouncement should show low-income stu
dents that they can get an undergraduate
education without owing the University
thousands of dollars in student loans. This,
in turn, should encourage more low-in
come students — who may, understand
ably. have serious reservations about Stan
lord's hefty tuition bill — to apply and at
tend. And that, needless to say, is some
thing to applaud.
Ultimately, it's important that this an
nouncement does not distract administra
tors from what is more helpful to the ma
jority of the student body — not a free-ed
ucation guarantee for admits below an ar
bitrary income cutoff, but a comprehensive
financial aid program that addresses the
needs of all students. When the cost of a
Stanford education is around $40,(XM) per
year without financial aid. it's not only low
income students who feel the crunch. Mid
die-class students also need and receive a
substantial amount of aid from the Univer
sity — this is a trend that should continue.
Furthermore, this announcement should
not overshadow the fact that Stanford tu
ition recently topped $I0,(XX) per quarter,
the latest in a series of regular increases that
occur without enough explanation or scruti
ny. It would be a shame if the Board of
Trustees used the new policy as a license for
greater increases. We hope that Stanford
students — more than Stanford's public
image — will reap real benefits from the re
vamped financial aid policy.
