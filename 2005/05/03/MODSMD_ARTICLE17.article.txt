# Tales of a 19th Grade Nothing
## OK, I get it — he's rich 
### 
Ciuys are simple. We're visu
al. We're limbic. We're open
about it. When we see a pretty
girl, we will likely stare too long,
light jeans, short skirts and
hoochie tops (yes, we know what
those are) will get our attention.
The right perfume will keep us
from focusing. When someone
asks us what we like in a woman,
we'll respond with a physical de-

scription so complete' that a police artist could come
up with a composite. (I've tried this three separate
times and now have a tunny little collage of Pamela
Anderson sketches to show for it.) It's only when
we get that disapproving stare that we make the
obligatory addendums: nice, smart, funny, good
with kids. etc. This may not be the sort of answer
that warms your heart, but it's honest, and we're too
stupid to say otherwise.
While I'm ready to admit that the fairer, more
mature, tolerant and better smelling sex is clearly
the evolutionary front-runner, I'm here to termi
nate the fictions surrounding the standard wish list
that supposedly defines what women are looking
for in a man. I've asked women about this hundreds
of times, sometimes out of personal interest, others
out of abject curiosity (the same sort that makes you
slow down around car crashes).
And with little exception, I get the same stock
answers: A man should be smart, sensitive, have a
great sense of humor, etc. Then there's the bitter,
chip-on-their-shoulder crowd that is quick to add
the qualifications of: not a player, honest, mature,
older, etc. Rarely, an honest woman will admit
that she'd really like him to be cute, tall, athletic,
big, etc.
Now I know there are a few — and by a few I
mean six — of you on campus who this will not
apply to. But for the rest, please, for once, just be
real. I recently spoke with two women with whom,
in the past, I had had brief romantic relations. We
hadn't spoken in a while, and when we approached
the "what's new" phase of the conversation, each of

them mentioned a new love interest. Despite Heel
ing and surprising little pangs of jealousy, I queried
each of them about the new suitor. Each, within the
first few sentences, mentioned something that in
spired this column.
One said that her new beau was much more "in
dependent" than her past boyfriends (and that he
would be flying out to meet up with her family mid
way through their Hawaiian vacation). The other
was eager to speak of how "ambitious" her new
gentleman friend was (and his burgeoning success
at the business school). These, independently, were
the feeblest attempts to disguise gold digging with
euphemisms for "rich" that 1 have ever encoun
tered — and they are only the most recent in a long
line.
It's not as if we men don't get it. We know that
Donald Trump did not land his supermodel wife
with his "sense of humor," and that Hugh Hefner is
not seven-deep in centerfold girlfriends because of
his "intellect." Would either of my acquaintances
still be enamored with an "independent" painter or
an "ambitious" snowboarder? What makes this so
shocking to me is that 1 used to think that these sorts
of attitudes were the purveyance of a less educated,
less enlightened class of women.
But I find these preferences equally, if not more
prevalent, among women at Stanford. And it's real
ly just fine. You should be allowed to like what you
want. It is one of the great tragedies of modern so
ciety that we actually feel guilty about our prefer
ences.
But ladies, please, before you set up camp on the
moral high ground of attraction, remember, if
you?re allowed to be disappointed when that cute
guy at the bar turns out to be a pizza deliveryman.
let us be a little down when the friend with the
"great personality" you set us up with turns out a lit
tle more beast than beauty.
