The irony of 'the pursuit of ignorance'
In the interests of high pedantry and schol
arly pretentiousness, I would like to offer a cor
rection to Navin Sivanandam's column, per
haps unconsciously ironically titled. "The Pur
suit of Ignorance" (May 2).
The author erroneously attributes a quote
to his "favorite 17th century British physicist,"
presumably Newton ("If I have seen further it
is by standing on the shoulders of giants").
While Newton certainly wrote as much in 1676,
the quotation should be attributed to an llth
century neo-platonist cleric named Bernard of
Chartres.
In 1130 Bernard wrote, highlighting the in
fluence of classical thought during the 12th
century "renaissance," that "we are like dwarfs
standing upon the shoulders of giants," or at
least John of Salisbury wrote as much in his
"Metalogicon" (1159).

Professors should challenge liberal students
I appreciate Kalani Leifer's discussion of
the role of politics in the classroom, and the
potentially educational role that this discus
sion can play ("Politics in the classroom."
April 29). Academia is dependent on the free
exchange of ideas and arguments, and it's im
portant that students and professors are free
to discuss their views, especially on subject
matters relevant to the class.
However, since professors (especially at
top-tier institutions like Stanford) have per
sonal political views that lean overwhelming
ly to the left, they should remember to ques
tion and challenge the views of all students,
not just the ones with views different from
their own. Regardless of our political views,
we all deserve to have the educational bene
fit of debating, defending and explaining our
politics.

Why were owls on the front page?
I don't pretend in the slightest to be any sort
of skilled periodical editor or layout expert, nor
do I think of myself generally as a good judge of
what's newsworthy, hut The Daily's choice of
story placement in yesterday's edition certainly
bothered me. Here we have tremendous news
with our women's Rugby team winning the na
tional championship ("Rugby wins national
title"), and where do we find it? Page nine.
What's on the front page? Well, among other
things, there's this story about how owls eat ro
dents ("Owls serve as pest control").
Now. this is not to say that I didn't find The
Daily's article about owls very interesting — in
fact, I enjoyed it very much. It just seems to me
that the story chronicling the achievement of a
major milestone for one of Stanford's greatest
teams of all time should be printed before an
in-depth look at owls and their dietary habits.
