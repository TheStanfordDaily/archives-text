# Grant to research abroad
## Some notified about Fulbright scholarships 
### WILL ROGERS 
Currently, over 18 Stanford graduates are roaming for
eign turf, pursuing the academic regimens and research pro
jects of their dreams. From New Zealand to Ecuador, from
China to Botswana, these students are living, learning, and
exploring free of charge â€” they are Fulbright Scholarship
winners.
Instead of being required to study at Oxford or another
British university, Fulbright fellows, or grantees, can choose
the country where they would prefer to study.
The Fulbright Scholarship allows recent college graduates
and master's students and doctoral students the chance to
gain meaningful international experience, said officials at the
Overseas Resources Center, or ORC. Since 1946, students
have used the scholarship to travel to more than 1(X) partici
pating countries.
"Grantees plan their own programs." states ORC Web
site. "Projects may include university course work, indepen
dent library or field research, classes in a music conservatory
or art school, special projects in the social or life sciences or a
combination."
Fulbright grants for U.S. students generally pay for travel,
tuition, language courses, research costs, living expenses and
health insurance.
While news of this year?s Stanford Fulbright Scholarship
winners is beginning to float around campus, most 2(X)5-2006
recipients of the award have yet to be officially announced.
Luna Federici, Class of 2(X)3, who is currently conducting
research in New Zealand on a Fulbright scholarship, said she
would encourage anyone interested in living abroad to apply.
"It'sa fantastic opportunity," Federici added. "I think that
many people don't apply simply because they assume their
application won't be successful."
A major harrier for Stanford stu
dents is the application deadline in
September, when fall quarter is just
beginning. With eighteen grantees
last year, however, Stanford has one
of the highest acceptance rates of any
university.
"Planning ahead, contacting people
early and working around their sched
ules is key," said senior Jenn Miller,
who will begin her Fulbright-funded re
search in Honduras this summer.
As with the Rhodes and Marshall
Scholarships, the application process
involves an intensive interview.
Andrea Everett, Class of 2(XM, is

currently studying in Berlin and said
she thinks the Fulbright interviews are
not as nerve-racking as for similar pro
grams.
"The interview is only on the cam
pus level, which makes it certainly less
stressful than those for scholarships like
the Rhodes and Marshall," Everett
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Federici said that the Fulbright in
terview was much less stressful than
others, adding that professors from ap
plicants' home institutions serve as in
terviewers for the Fulbright, which cre
ates a more encouraging atmosphere.
"For the most part, the professors at
Stanford want each applicant to do
well," Federici said. "They don't try to
ask difficult questions and put you in a
corner. Instead, they try to highlight the
exceptional qualities of your applica
tion."
Once the Fulbright Foundation ac

cepts a proposal, the project can take
on an entirely different form, according
to Everett.
"You need to have a very detailed
plan of what you want your year to be
like, but most of the time it doesn't ac
tually turn out exactly that way,"
Everett told The Daily. "You definite
ly need to be prepared to arrive there
and have things go differently than you
may have expected when you applied."
Although Everett is taking classes in
political science as part of her program,
she said she feels that academics have
not been the central aspect of her expe
rience in Germany.
"Even if I spend a lot of time getting
to know people and making friends,"
Everett said, "I feel like I'm still doing
what I'm supposed to be doing, since
one of the big goals of all the Fulbright
programs is to promote cultural ex
change."
