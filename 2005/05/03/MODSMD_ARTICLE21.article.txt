# Holt's Harangue
## Dirty Harry's energy solution 
### 
Armed vigilantes calling themselves the
"Minutemen" have made headlines recent
ly for their volunteer patrol along Arizona's
border in an effort to forcefully curb illegal
immigration. In a radio interview two
weeks ago, your governor, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, said of the Minutemen, "I
think they've done a terrific job." 1 say
"your governor" because I'm from Jersey,
and if I have to choose between citizenship
in a state led by an inarticulate ex-body-

builder and one formerly run by a corrupt gay man, I'm going
with Scrooge McScrewsguys.
In opposition to Schwarzenegger, Bush previously spoke
out against the Minutemen's vigilante tactics. In a rare moment
of cross-party agreement, Democrats across the West have
spoken out against the Minutemen as well. They consider in
terfering with law enforcement illegal. California State As
semblyman Hector De La Torre, representing the southeast
Los Angeles area, has been quoted as saying: "It isn't cool that
there are people out in the desert with guns."
Stupid hippie liberals.
We should not be criticizing these actions, but encouraging
them. What we need right now are more gun-toting vigilantes
who follow their own rules. What we need right now is Dirty
Harry.
We need Clint Eastwood to drop his stupid directing kick
and go back to what he does best: playing Dirty Harry, a vigi
lante cop who doesn't give a rat's ass about the rules, soap or
"the value of a human life." SchwartezeNaderhater wants the
borders closed. Well, with Dirty Harry on patrol, 1 guarantee
that every would-be-immigrant will be scared shitless.
1 know Clint is getting up there in years, but he really is ideal
for the situation — he's had experience in"The Good, the
Bad, and the Ugly," where he fired six-shooters and patrolled
the desert for days on end. In that movie, he shot a lot of peo
ple. Some of them were Mexicans. He's perfect.
And just think of the jewels he could be saying: "Well, mi
grant worker who is trying to save enough money for his fami
ly's well being, do you feel lucky? Do you?"
On a seemingly unrelated note. Bush is pushing some ener
gy crisis solutions — blah blah — 1 don't really understand
them. I think he's pushing for more nuclear plants, which is OK
by me because my uncle is a dentist and gets a major kickback

when people have strontium 90 in their teeth. The only prob
lem is Bush needs a lot of money to build all of those nuclear
plants.
Right now. Bush either wants to cut social security bene
fits or hold a lot of bake sales, but 1 have a better plan. Why
not send Clint Eastwood down to the Arizona border to fight
illegal immigrants, and then film it? 1 know this idea is strik
ingly similar to that in Schwarzenegger's "Running Man,"
but 1 really don't think those body suits would be good in the
desert, nor fitting fora governor to be prancing around in.
Anyway, we send Clint down there and have people place
bets on how much "discretionary force" an Oscar-award
winning citizen can unleash. The tagline will be something
like: "He's got a hit on American hearts... and Mexican
body cavities."
We could use the proceeds to solve the energy crisis. We
won't even have to pay Clint much because with social securi
ty benefits being cut, he'll only be qualifying for dimes and
prune juice.
I think there's a lot of promise behind this plan: It can solve
the energy crisis, close the borders and even give me something
decent to watch on Wednesdays instead of "Will and Grace."
There may be objections to my plan, of course. Hippie love
loving liberals probably will say something about how Ameri
ca is the land of opportunity and we've only generally closed
our borders because of preconceived racist notions about
Asians, the Irish, etc. Some may say that these vigilantes won't
be cool like The Punisher or Boba Fett, but will be lame like
The Rock in "Walking Tall" or Stephen Segal in any Stephan
Segal movie.
But to them. I say, it's not irrational by any means to have
armed citizens, many of them not in the right state of mind,
pointing their guns at their fellow human beings. And I want to
emphasize that excited southerners with guns are NO cause for
concern. There is no likelihood that somebody will get killed,
or that they will try to secede again.
And to those illegal immigrants trying to cross the border,
here are some words of advice: Saying "we come in peace"
probably doesn't matter much to these guys.

Chris took the moral high road and decided to not suggest that
Schwarzenegger would like to personally lead the Minutetnan
volunteers with a chain-gun. Send complaints to cholt@stan
