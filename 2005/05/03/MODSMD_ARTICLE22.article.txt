(U-WIRE) COLLEGE STATION, Texas - Texas
A&M University-area organizations are campaigning
against recent legislation, approved by the Texas House
of Representatives, that would ban same-sex couples
from becoming foster parents and create a state consti
tutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages
and unions.
The House passed a bill on April 19 to overhaul
Texas' Child Protective Services Agency. The bill in
cluded an amendment to ban homosexuals and bisexuals
from becoming foster parents and to remove children
from homes of same-sex couples who are already foster
parents. The State Senate's version of the bill, passed in
March, does not include the ban.
College Station House Representative Fred Brown
voted for the bill.
Ryan Caldwell, vice president of Texas A&M's
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Professional
Network, said local organizations — such as chapters
of the American Civil Liberties Union; the Parents,
Family, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG),
and the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby ol Texas are
sponsoring a letter-writing campaign to voice their ob

jections to Brown.
"Foster children, in homes where they are being
taken care of, are being ripped out of homes and put
back in the system," said ( aldwell. a graduate student in
sociology and a professor of women studies.
John Barnett, a junior industrial engineering major
and chairman of the Young Conservatives of Texas, said
he agrees with the amendment. It has been proven that a
child is best reared in a house with a positive mother and
a positive father figure, Barnett said, and no matter how
much love a child receives, same-sex couples cannot fill
both roles.
Based on the research of University of Houston Pro
fessor Carol Bennett, PFLAG President Katrina Stew
art said the amendment would cost the state $17 million
to investigate sexual orientation of foster parents and to
remove children from homes.
"The Defense of Marriage Act is already in place, al
ready on the law books in Texas," Stewart said. "(This
amendment) is like taking a knife and twisting it in the
heart of gay America, specifically gay Texans."
On April 25, House representatives also approved a
constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages and civil
unions. To become law, the amendment must be ap
proved by the Senate and then voted on by Texas resi
dents. Brown co-authored the House Bill.
