(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON - George Washington
University's Hillel is circulating a questionnaire as part of
the first step in creating a kosher meal plan for next year.
Rob Fishman, interim director of Hillel, said the
questions are being sent via e-mail to students and par
ents on the Jewish center's listserv to see if there is suf
ficient interest in kosher food. Under the proposed
meal program, students would sign up and pay for
kosher meals throughout the semester. Meals would
be picked up in either the former Hall on Virginia Av
enue diner or Hillel.
While his ultimate wish would be fora lull-service
kosher venue, Fishman said, it is likely a food service
would only be open to those who register in the beginning
of the semester. Hillel serves kosher dinners to students
during the week, but it offers no formalized meal plan.
"What we're doing is working with (university)
President (Stephen Joel) Trachtenberg and Jewish

students concerned about kosher food to explore ways
to get more options on campus," Fishman said.
Kosher food adheres to certain Jewish preparation
guidelines.
Queries on the questionnaire include whether stu
dents would take advantage of a kosher meal system,
how many meals a week they would be willing to com
mit to and whether the meals should be served at a
cafeteria in the Hall on Virginia Avenue or the Hillel
building.
Fishman emphasized that the meal plan is in its pre
liminary stages, and that his organization first needs to
determine whether there is interest in the proposal.
Last summer, an attempt to open a kosher venue in
the Hippodrome failed because the university said it
would not make money on such a facility.
"While the university is not considering opening a
kosher dining hall, we are interested in understanding
the needs of our students who wish to keep kosher,"
wrote Christine Fisher, assistant director of contract
services, in an e-mail statement last week.
