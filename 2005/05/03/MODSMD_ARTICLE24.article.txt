## Soto Tape Chronicles Jordi reflects on sports lessons front Uncle Lou 
### 
I took a trip this weekend to my Uncle Lou's
house in New Hampshire for our annual
Passover family get-together. Every year we
commemorate the event with a family photo
that my grandmother puts on her mantle next to
the one from the previous year. If you walk
down the row of pictures, you can chronicle our
family history as the number of cousins grows
from three to five to six and the parents and
grandparents get slightly older and grayer.
Grandma saves all the old photos along with
decades' worth of film reel and slides. Of the en
tire collection, one photo sticks particularly well

in my mind. It's a snapshot of
my dad and Uncle Lou with
five of us kids at the local zoo.
I'm on the left, seven years old
with a mop of black hair and
clunky Rec Specs sports gog
gles firmly in place.
I don't know why I'm wear
ing my Rec Specs at the zoo. I
tell myself that it's not damn
ing evidence of my future fash
ion sense, but rather proof that

we were on our way to the local courts to play
basketball.
This isn't just my delusion — Uncle Lou
loves basketball. An ardent Knicks fan growing
up, he spent countless hours at the playground
in junior high, high school, college and medical
school. As memorialized in Grandma's stories,
he used to sit at the kitchen table and challenge
Grandpa to a game of horse by shooting crum
pled napkins into the trashcan in the corner.
Uncle Lou's family is blessed with most of
the athletic genes in the Fink lineage. A good
six years younger than my dad and his twin, Lou
is taller, leaner and more sports-savvy than his
brothers. His daughters — my cousins — sup
plement their academic extracurricular activi
ties and piano lessons with soccer practice, field
hockey clinics, cross-country ski tournaments
and lacrosse games.
After the Seder we were watching the
Celtics-Pacers game on his big-screen TV and I
asked Uncle Lou if he still followed the Knicks.
He told me that his fanaticism had given way to
a more mature, dispassionate appreciation of
the game. He follows Stanford hoops because of
me, and he still watches the NBA and gets ex
cited about the playoffs, but he has long-since
reneged on his vow never to live in a place
where the hated Celtics would headline the
morning news.
1 wondered if that would happen to me, too.
Maybe my undying loyalty to the Steelers, Pis
tons, Giants and Cardinal will one day fade as I
recognize that there might be more fruitful
places to find a raison-d'etre than in the final
scores of sports contests.

Before I got too mired in de
pressing contemplation of my fu
ture, Uncle Lou began another
story. Lou's wife, my Aunt Pam, is
closely related to Chris Klug, an
Olympic snowboarder who won a
bronze medal in the 2002 Winter
Games after recovering from a liver
transplant. As remarkable as that
story is, the real excitement starts
when both sides of Pam's family
were vacationing in the Outer
Banks of North Carolina in the
summer of 2002.
Despite a sweltering coastal
heat wave, Klug and his cousins
challenged Lou and three in-laws
to a game of basketball. In an al
most mythical scene, the Olympian
Klug walked up to Lou, a family
man cardiologist 20 years his elder,
and said: "You guys want to run
with us?"
The motley crew stepped out
onto the concrete driveway and
proceeded to play an intense 4-on-4
game of half-court. Perhaps it was
the heat, or that the younger ath
letes underestimated their competi
tion. or maybe it was Uncle Lou's
unflappable confidence in his fade
away jumper, but Lou made the
first four shots of the game and it
quickly turned into a rout.
Klug and his cousins are very
competitive and didn't take long to
react. Like a favored heavyweight
stunned by an early flurry from a
lighter opponent, they started play
ing better and the second game was
a lot closer. Both teams struggled
back and forth, exchanging buck
ets. Eventually. Lou's team was up
11-10 with possession, needing one
more basket to win. Sensing that

this was a pivotal moment and
knowing who the go-to guy was,
Klug epically pointed to my uncle
and declared: "I got him."
There they were: eight grown
men drenched in sweat, sucking
wind and trying to hang on fora few
more moments; at the top of the
key, a 6-foot-4 Olympian with
rugged snowboarder looks leaning
up against a 5-foot-10 lanky 47-
year-old with a salt-and-pepper
goatee.
As the story goes, Lou backed
Klug down into the paint, then took
two quick steps to his left and put
up a left-handed hook shot that
cleared the outstretched hands of
his Herculean defender and
swooshed through the hoop.
When Uncle Lou told this part of
the tale, his face lit up like a little
boy's and I knew that he was reliv
ing the thrill of the blacktops of
Millburn, New Haven and Philadel
phia. 1 could just see him leaning
back in his chair and banking the
napkin off of the fridge and into the
trashcan. It's the same face I get
when I describe a goal I scored in
soccer or reenact a diving catch I
made in Frisbee.
It's the same giddy excitement
he felt at age 15 when his beloved
Knicks won their first NBA cham
pionship, and that I experienced
last year when Stanford knocked
off Arizona.
1 bet Uncle Lou is right: some
day sports will start to mean less to
me and I'll renounce my childhood
allegiances. It hasn't happened yet
— I almost missed my connecting
flight in Newark because I was
glued to the airport barstool watch
ing the Pistons beat the 76ers in
overtime — but I'm 21 and it can't
last forever.

I don't know why I'm wear
ing my Rec Specs at the zoo. I
tell myself that it's not damn
ing evidence of my future fash
ion sense, but rather proof that

we were on our way to the local courts to play
basketball.
This isn't just my delusion — Uncle Lou
loves basketball. An ardent Knicks fan growing
up, he spent countless hours at the playground
in junior high, high school, college and medical
school. As memorialized in Grandma's stories,
he used to sit at the kitchen table and challenge
Grandpa to a game of horse by shooting crum
pled napkins into the trashcan in the corner.
Uncle Lou's family is blessed with most of
the athletic genes in the Fink lineage. A good
six years younger than my dad and his twin, Lou
is taller, leaner and more sports-savvy than his
brothers. His daughters — my cousins — sup
plement their academic extracurricular activi
ties and piano lessons with soccer practice, field
hockey clinics, cross-country ski tournaments
and lacrosse games.
After the Seder we were watching the
Celtics-Pacers game on his big-screen TV and I
asked Uncle Lou if he still followed the Knicks.
He told me that his fanaticism had given way to
a more mature, dispassionate appreciation of
the game. He follows Stanford hoops because of
me, and he still watches the NBA and gets ex
cited about the playoffs, but he has long-since
reneged on his vow never to live in a place
where the hated Celtics would headline the
morning news.
1 wondered if that would happen to me, too.
Maybe my undying loyalty to the Steelers, Pis
tons, Giants and Cardinal will one day fade as I
recognize that there might be more fruitful
places to find a raison-d'etre than in the final
scores of sports contests.

Before I got too mired in de
pressing contemplation of my fu
ture, Uncle Lou began another
story. Lou's wife, my Aunt Pam, is
closely related to Chris Klug, an
Olympic snowboarder who won a
bronze medal in the 2002 Winter
Games after recovering from a liver
transplant. As remarkable as that
story is, the real excitement starts
when both sides of Pam's family
were vacationing in the Outer
Banks of North Carolina in the
summer of 2002.
Despite a sweltering coastal
heat wave, Klug and his cousins
challenged Lou and three in-laws
to a game of basketball. In an al
most mythical scene, the Olympian
Klug walked up to Lou, a family
man cardiologist 20 years his elder,
and said: "You guys want to run
with us?"
The motley crew stepped out
onto the concrete driveway and
proceeded to play an intense 4-on-4
game of half-court. Perhaps it was
the heat, or that the younger ath
letes underestimated their competi
tion. or maybe it was Uncle Lou's
unflappable confidence in his fade
away jumper, but Lou made the
first four shots of the game and it
quickly turned into a rout.
Klug and his cousins are very
competitive and didn't take long to
react. Like a favored heavyweight
stunned by an early flurry from a
lighter opponent, they started play
ing better and the second game was
a lot closer. Both teams struggled
back and forth, exchanging buck
ets. Eventually. Lou's team was up
11-10 with possession, needing one
more basket to win. Sensing that

this was a pivotal moment and
knowing who the go-to guy was,
Klug epically pointed to my uncle
and declared: "I got him."
There they were: eight grown
men drenched in sweat, sucking
wind and trying to hang on fora few
more moments; at the top of the
key, a 6-foot-4 Olympian with
rugged snowboarder looks leaning
up against a 5-foot-10 lanky 47-
year-old with a salt-and-pepper
goatee.
As the story goes, Lou backed
Klug down into the paint, then took
two quick steps to his left and put
up a left-handed hook shot that
cleared the outstretched hands of
his Herculean defender and
swooshed through the hoop.
When Uncle Lou told this part of
the tale, his face lit up like a little
boy's and I knew that he was reliv
ing the thrill of the blacktops of
Millburn, New Haven and Philadel
phia. 1 could just see him leaning
back in his chair and banking the
napkin off of the fridge and into the
trashcan. It's the same face I get
when I describe a goal I scored in
soccer or reenact a diving catch I
made in Frisbee.
It's the same giddy excitement
he felt at age 15 when his beloved
Knicks won their first NBA cham
pionship, and that I experienced
last year when Stanford knocked
off Arizona.
1 bet Uncle Lou is right: some
day sports will start to mean less to
me and I'll renounce my childhood
allegiances. It hasn't happened yet
— I almost missed my connecting
flight in Newark because I was
glued to the airport barstool watch
ing the Pistons beat the 76ers in
overtime — but I'm 21 and it can't
last forever.
