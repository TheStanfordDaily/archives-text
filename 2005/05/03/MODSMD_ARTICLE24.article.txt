## Soto Tape Chronicles Jordi reflects on sports lessons front Uncle Lou 
### 
I took a trip this weekend to my Uncle Lou's
house in New Hampshire for our annual
Passover family get-together. Every year we
commemorate the event with a family photo
that my grandmother puts on her mantle next to
the one from the previous year. If you walk
down the row of pictures, you can chronicle our
family history as the number of cousins grows
from three to five to six and the parents and
grandparents get slightly older and grayer.
Grandma saves all the old photos along with
decades' worth of film reel and slides. Of the en
tire collection, one photo sticks particularly well

in my mind. It's a snapshot of
my dad and Uncle Lou with
five of us kids at the local zoo.
I'm on the left, seven years old
with a mop of black hair and
clunky Rec Specs sports gog
gles firmly in place.
I don't know why I'm wear
ing my Rec Specs at the zoo. I
tell myself that it's not damn
ing evidence of my future fash
ion sense, but rather proof that

we were on our way to the local courts to play
basketball.
This isn't just my delusion — Uncle Lou
loves basketball. An ardent Knicks fan growing
up, he spent countless hours at the playground
in junior high, high school, college and medical
school. As memorialized in Grandma's stories,
he used to sit at the kitchen table and challenge
Grandpa to a game of horse by shooting crum
pled napkins into the trashcan in the corner.
Uncle Lou's family is blessed with most of
the athletic genes in the Fink lineage. A good
six years younger than my dad and his twin, Lou
is taller, leaner and more sports-savvy than his
brothers. His daughters — my cousins — sup
plement their academic extracurricular activi
ties and piano lessons with soccer practice, field
hockey clinics, cross-country ski tournaments
and lacrosse games.
After the Seder we were watching the
Celtics-Pacers game on his big-screen TV and I
asked Uncle Lou if he still followed the Knicks.
He told me that his fanaticism had given way to
a more mature, dispassionate appreciation of
the game. He follows Stanford hoops because of
me, and he still watches the NBA and gets ex
cited about the playoffs, but he has long-since
reneged on his vow never to live in a place
where the hated Celtics would headline the
morning news.
1 wondered if that would happen to me, too.
Maybe my undying loyalty to the Steelers, Pis
tons, Giants and Cardinal will one day fade as I
recognize that there might be more fruitful
places to find a raison-d'etre than in the final
scores of sports contests.
