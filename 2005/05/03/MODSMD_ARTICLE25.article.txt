# Water polo beats USC, falls to UCLA in final
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
The smiles started to show with 56 sec
onds remaining in the first period of Stan
ford's 9-5 upset win over Southern Califor
nia in Saturday's MPSF tournament semi
final. Sophomore Alison Gregorka had
just sent a beautiful pass over the middle
from her position at the low right wing.
Sophomore driver Katie Hansen, cutting
toward the goal through an open lane, had
risen up in the water just long enough to
reach hack and control the pass. A split
second later, Hansen's shot rocketed past
USC goalie Sarah Mix to push the Cardi
nal's lead to 3-0.
The Stanford bench erupted in cheers

as Hansen and Gregorka swam back to
half-tank, their faces beaming. There was
something special about Saturday's semifi
nal match against the No. 2 Women of
Troy, and every member of the No. 3 Car
dinal knew it.
Those smiles continued to grow as the
afternoon wore on. Senior captain Hannah
Luber rounded out the first period scoring
for the Cardinal. Assisted by junior Laurel
Champion, Luber sent a blind backhand
sweep shot into the back of the cage to put
the Stanford women up by four.
The Women of Troy managed to cut the
Cardinal's lead in half, notching power
play goals on two consecutive possessions
near the end of the second period. But
sophomore Christina Hewko responded

for the Cardinal. After receiving a pass at
set, Hewko backed off her defender for just
long enough to rifle a shot into the right side
of the cage to give Stanford a comfortable
three-goal lead going into the half.
The two teams played an even third pe
riod, with each squad recording two goals.
The Women of Troy started the second
half scoring, converting an inside shot dur
ing a six-on-five advantage to make the
score 5-3.
But on the Cardinal's following posses
sion, a series of passes left Hansen open in
the middle for her second tally of the match.
The Women of Troy crawled back to
within two on junior Moriah van Norman's
third goal of the day. But minutes later,
Hansen and Gregorka combined again

with clockwork precision to notch the Car
dinal's seventh goal of the day.
After taking a long outlet pass down the
right side of the pool, Hansen slowed to
draw the Southern California coverage.
Left unmarked, Gregorka moved into
open water in front of the net. Hansen
flipped the pass over the head of her de
fender, and Gregorka buried the cross
cage skip-shot to recapture the momentum
for the Cardinal. But the spectacular play
surprised neither Hansen nor Gregorka.
"All of the offensive things we did in the
USC game we've done before in practice,"
Gregorka said. "It's been a long time com
ing in a game situation, but things finally
came together [on Saturday]."
The Cardinal offense continued
its relentless assault on the USC de
fense, netting two more goals in the
fourth quarter before the final
buzzer sounded.
But at the end of the day, it was
sophomore goalie Meridith McColl
who wore the brightest smile — and

for good reason.
The second-year standout record
ed a career-high 19 saves en route to
guiding the Cardinal to victory in
their biggest contest of the season.
Numerous times during the match,
McColl managed to single-handedly
steal the momentum of the USC
comeback attempt. In making her
most brilliant saves, McColl seemed
to see the shot even before it left the
shooter's hand.
"She was amazing," Hewko said.
"[That] was the best game I've ever
seen her play. USC couldn't get the

ball past her because she was just a
wall."
McColl posted five saves in the
first period, each more impressive
than the last. And as her shutout con
tinued, McColl's domination in the
defensive end became the definitive
point of the game. After making six
saves in the fourth quarter to close
out her effort, McColl swam exuber
antly to the side of the pool, where
she was embraced by her coaches
and teammates.
The Cardinal's field defense was
equally remarkable. Holding the

Women of Troy to their lowest goal
total of the season, the Stanford women
displayed a level of anticipation and co
ordination unseen this season.
And when the Cardinal perform
at that level, offensive production
will be a struggle for any rival squad.
"We came together to play really
amazing team defense [against
USC]," Gregorka said. "With all of
us working together, there's no way
anyone can beat us."
Prior to this Saturday's Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation semifinal
match, the Cardinal and the Women
of Troy had met two times this sea
son. The resultant familiarity be
tween the two teams clearly worked
to the Cardinal's advantage this
weekend — the Stanford defense
demonstrated both a strong grasp of
USC's offensive schemes and an ef
fective counter-strategy.
Despite losing, 9-5, to UCLA in
Sunday's MPSF final, the victory
over USC this weekend serves as a
positive inspiration to the Cardinal
as they look ahead to the NCAA
Tournament.
"We've become more comfort
able with their style of play and de
fending their attack," Gregorka said.
"|Beating them) is a confidence
booster for sure. We know that we
can beat them and that it's just a mat
ter of doing it again."
With her comment, Gregorka
struck a chord echoed by the rest of
her team — the work is not finished
yet. The NCAA tournament begins
in two weeks.
"Saturday was an all-around awe
some effort from everyone on the
team — we showed what we are capa
ble of," McColl said. "In two weeks we
hope to do it again, for keeps."
If the Cardinal can reproduce
their effort against USC in Ann
Arbor, Mich., their smiles — and
their team trophy rack — will be that
much brighter.

of the cage to give Stanford a comfortable
three-goal lead going into the half.
The two teams played an even third pe
riod, with each squad recording two goals.
The Women of Troy started the second
half scoring, converting an inside shot dur
ing a six-on-five advantage to make the
score 5-3.
But on the Cardinal's following posses
sion, a series of passes left Hansen open in
the middle for her second tally of the match.
The Women of Troy crawled back to
within two on junior Moriah van Norman's
third goal of the day. But minutes later,
Hansen and Gregorka combined again

with clockwork precision to notch the Car
dinal's seventh goal of the day.
After taking a long outlet pass down the
right side of the pool, Hansen slowed to
draw the Southern California coverage.
Left unmarked, Gregorka moved into
open water in front of the net. Hansen
flipped the pass over the head of her de
fender, and Gregorka buried the cross
cage skip-shot to recapture the momentum
for the Cardinal. But the spectacular play
surprised neither Hansen nor Gregorka.
"All of the offensive things we did in the
USC game we've done before in practice,"
Gregorka said. "It's been a long time com
ing in a game situation, but things finally
came together [on Saturday]."
The Cardinal offense continued
its relentless assault on the USC de
fense, netting two more goals in the
fourth quarter before the final
buzzer sounded.
But at the end of the day, it was
sophomore goalie Meridith McColl
who wore the brightest smile — and

for good reason.
The second-year standout record
ed a career-high 19 saves en route to
guiding the Cardinal to victory in
their biggest contest of the season.
Numerous times during the match,
McColl managed to single-handedly
steal the momentum of the USC
comeback attempt. In making her
most brilliant saves, McColl seemed
to see the shot even before it left the
shooter's hand.
"She was amazing," Hewko said.
"[That] was the best game I've ever
seen her play. USC couldn't get the

ball past her because she was just a
wall."
McColl posted five saves in the
first period, each more impressive
than the last. And as her shutout con
tinued, McColl's domination in the
defensive end became the definitive
point of the game. After making six
saves in the fourth quarter to close
out her effort, McColl swam exuber
antly to the side of the pool, where
she was embraced by her coaches
and teammates.
The Cardinal's field defense was
equally remarkable. Holding the

Women of Troy to their lowest goal
total of the season, the Stanford women
displayed a level of anticipation and co
ordination unseen this season.
And when the Cardinal perform
at that level, offensive production
will be a struggle for any rival squad.
"We came together to play really
amazing team defense [against
USC]," Gregorka said. "With all of
us working together, there's no way
anyone can beat us."
Prior to this Saturday's Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation semifinal
match, the Cardinal and the Women
of Troy had met two times this sea
son. The resultant familiarity be
tween the two teams clearly worked
to the Cardinal's advantage this
weekend — the Stanford defense
demonstrated both a strong grasp of
USC's offensive schemes and an ef
fective counter-strategy.
Despite losing, 9-5, to UCLA in
Sunday's MPSF final, the victory
over USC this weekend serves as a
positive inspiration to the Cardinal
as they look ahead to the NCAA
Tournament.
"We've become more comfort
able with their style of play and de
fending their attack," Gregorka said.
"|Beating them) is a confidence
booster for sure. We know that we
can beat them and that it's just a mat
ter of doing it again."
With her comment, Gregorka
struck a chord echoed by the rest of
her team — the work is not finished
yet. The NCAA tournament begins
in two weeks.
"Saturday was an all-around awe
some effort from everyone on the
team — we showed what we are capa
ble of," McColl said. "In two weeks we
hope to do it again, for keeps."
If the Cardinal can reproduce
their effort against USC in Ann
Arbor, Mich., their smiles — and
their team trophy rack — will be that
much brighter.
