# Water polo beats USC, falls to UCLA in final

### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
The smiles started to show with 56 sec
onds remaining in the first period of Stan
ford's 9-5 upset win over Southern Califor
nia in Saturday's MPSF tournament semi
final. Sophomore Alison Gregorka had
just sent a beautiful pass over the middle
from her position at the low right wing.
Sophomore driver Katie Hansen, cutting
toward the goal through an open lane, had
risen up in the water just long enough to
reach hack and control the pass. A split
second later, Hansen's shot rocketed past
USC goalie Sarah Mix to push the Cardi
nal's lead to 3-0.
The Stanford bench erupted in cheers

as Hansen and Gregorka swam back to
half-tank, their faces beaming. There was
something special about Saturday's semifi
nal match against the No. 2 Women of
Troy, and every member of the No. 3 Car
dinal knew it.
Those smiles continued to grow as the
afternoon wore on. Senior captain Hannah
Luber rounded out the first period scoring
for the Cardinal. Assisted by junior Laurel
Champion, Luber sent a blind backhand
sweep shot into the back of the cage to put
the Stanford women up by four.
The Women of Troy managed to cut the
Cardinal's lead in half, notching power
play goals on two consecutive possessions
near the end of the second period. But
sophomore Christina Hewko responded

for the Cardinal. After receiving a pass at
set, Hewko backed off her defender for just
long enough to rifle a shot into the right side
of the cage to give Stanford a comfortable
three-goal lead going into the half.
The two teams played an even third pe
riod, with each squad recording two goals.
The Women of Troy started the second
half scoring, converting an inside shot dur
ing a six-on-five advantage to make the
score 5-3.
But on the Cardinal's following posses
sion, a series of passes left Hansen open in
the middle for her second tally of the match.
The Women of Troy crawled back to
within two on junior Moriah van Norman's
third goal of the day. But minutes later,
Hansen and Gregorka combined again

with clockwork precision to notch the Car
dinal's seventh goal of the day.
After taking a long outlet pass down the
right side of the pool, Hansen slowed to
draw the Southern California coverage.
Left unmarked, Gregorka moved into
open water in front of the net. Hansen
flipped the pass over the head of her de
fender, and Gregorka buried the cross
cage skip-shot to recapture the momentum
for the Cardinal. But the spectacular play
surprised neither Hansen nor Gregorka.
"All of the offensive things we did in the
USC game we've done before in practice,"
Gregorka said. "It's been a long time com
ing in a game situation, but things finally
