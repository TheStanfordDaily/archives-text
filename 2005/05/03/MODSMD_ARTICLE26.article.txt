# Bach tallies four goals as Cardinal improve to 11-5 Lacrosse downs OSU
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
If the mark of a well-coached team is
improvement throughout the course of a
season, the 2(X)5 women's lacrosse squad is
making head coach Michelle Uhlfelder
look like the reincarnation of John Wood
en. After a subpar 6-5 start, five consecu
tive wins have the Cardinal as confident as
ever heading into their postseason.
Stanford's latest victory came Saturday
in a 13-7 triumph over Ohio State (5-9). Ju
nior attacker Sarah Bach netted four, ju
nior attacker Megan Burker added anoth
er three and Stanford (11-5, 5-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) used a six-goal
run in the middle of the contest to defeat
the Buckeyes in convincing fashion.
"We just wanted to win the game, but a
six-goal differential means a lot for our
momentum going into the MPSF tourna
ment," freshman goalie Laura Shane said.
"It shows where we are as a program. I
think we had a huge game beating Loyola
a couple of weeks ago, but a bigger differ
ential against Ohio State shows the growth
and maturity of all of us and reflects how
we've been working all season."
Although they would eventually rally,
Stanford started the contest slowly. Quick
strikes gave Ohio State an early 2-0 lead
just two minutes into the contest.
"Honestly, I wasn't really nervous
about their quick start," freshman goalie
Laura Shane said. "We were keeping up
with them for the most part. That's hap
pened to us a lot where the other team gets
a couple of quick goals. I think our team
has gotten a lot more mature over the sea
son. and we know we can come back and
handle that."
Indeed, the Cardinal immediately re

sponded, scoring three in a row and four of
the next six to tie the game at four as the
first half wound down. Two additional
Cardinal tallies in the last nine minutes of
the period gave Stanford a 6-4 halftime
lead, but neither team had the slightest
premonition of what was to come.
After the break, Stanford started the
second half on fire, scoring four goals in
the first 3:27 of the stanza to build to a 10-
4 lead. With three tallies during the spurt.
Bach spearheaded an offensive explosion
that surprised Stanford nearly as much as
Ohio State.
"Going into the second half, I definite
ly didn't expect that run," said Shane, who
notched 13 saves in the victory. "I know
our coach made some changes after half
time, but we scored four goals in three and
a half minutes. It was a nice buffer I defi
nitely wasn't expecting."
The six consecutive Stanford goals pro
vided enough impetus for Ohio State to
yank starting goalie Kim Hastings midway
through the streak. Hastings finished the
contest with nine goals allowed and only
two saves, and Stanford exploited backup
goalie Joy DeMarco for another four tal
lies en route to a comfortable 13-7 final
score.
"The first half was more of a defensive
battle, and then in the second half the of
fense really took over," Shane said. "The
offense has started to work together a lot
more over the past few games. Obviously,
we all have a lot of confidence in them.
They took a lot of pressure off the defense
once they scored those. It kind of zapped
Ohio State and put a damper on their mo
mentum."
Next up for the Cardinal are the MPSF
League Championships in Moraga, Calif.,
Friday and Saturday.
