# Cardinal bounce back to pound Aggies
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
With a break from conference play last week
end, the No. 24 Stanford baseball team had plenty
of time to think about last Tuesday's 7-5 home loss
to Santa Clara. Yesterday, the Cardinal (25-15)
took out their frustration by opening their season
long six-game road trip with a dominating 8-0 win

at UC-Davis, another non-conference foe.
Three pitchers combined to shutout the Aggies
(21-22) on three hits, while recording a season
high 13 strikeouts. The Stanford offense provided
enough punch despite leaving 12 runners on base.
Junior righty Jeff Gilmore got the starting nod
and allowed three hits over three scoreless in
nings. He picked up the win to improve to 7-1 in a
predetermined pitching rotation.

Gilmore and Stanford got all the offense they
would need in the top of the first. After leadoff hit
ter Jim Rapoport drew the first of his career-high
five walks, the sophomore stole second and ad
vanced to third on a throwing error by UC-Davis
catcher David Treat. Sophomore Adam Sorgi fol
lowed with a triple to right centerfield and scored
on junior Jed Lowrie's single to right to put the
Cardinal ahead 2-0.
The first two Aggies reached base in the bottom
half of the inning, but Gilmore induced designated
hitter Kevin James to hit into a 4-6-3 double play and
retired cleanup hitter Lukas Cooper on a grounder
to first base to get out of the inning unscathed.
It was the second consecutive strong outing for
Gilmore, though three times shorter than his last
start. He gave up one run on four hits in a com
plete-game victory over Washington on April 22.
Senior lefty Mark Romanczuk relieved
Gilmore and did not allow a hit in his four innings
of work. He walked one and struck out seven; he
has struck out 12 and walked two over his past two
outings.
Stanford padded its lead with Gilmore out of
the game. Sorgi singled home junior shortstop
Chris Minaker in the fourth and the Cardinal
struck for four more runs in the fifth. Freshman
Michael Taylor drove in junior John Mayberry,
Jr., who led off the inning with a single, with a dou
ble to right. Freshman Brendan Domaracki
lashed a two-run single later in the frame and
came around to score on a double by Rapoport as
the Cardinal's lead ballooned to 7-0.
Sorgi, who was 2-for-5, tallied his career-high
third RBI with a sacrifice fly in the seventh to com
plete the scoring. Minaker finished 2-for-4 with
two runs scored and Domaracki was 2-for-5 with
two RBI.
Sophomore Greg Reynolds pitched two per
fect innings and tallied four strikeouts to polish off
the Aggies and secure the combined shutout.
It was Stanford's third shutout of the season
and first since it blanked USC, 6-0, on Feb. 25.
The Cardinal return to action today with a 2
p.m. non-conference game at Nevada before be
ginning a three-game set on Friday at Berkeley.
