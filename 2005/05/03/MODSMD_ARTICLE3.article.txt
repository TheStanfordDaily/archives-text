# New film, media degrees proposed
## More options next year for film and media studies 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new major and minor program in film
and media studies will be introduced to the
Communication and Art and Art History
Departments this fall. The existing two-year
documentary film master's program, will

also be turned into a master's of fine arts, or
MFA, program in the fall of 2006.
The Faculty Senate will vote on finalizing
these programs during its May 12 meeting.
"It'll be about ideas, understanding sto
ries, genre, the language of film," said Com
munication Prof. Kris Samuelson, who will
serve as the inaugural chair of the new pro
gram for the first three years.
To make way for the MFA program, the
current MA program in filmmaking will not
be admitting a new class this fall. Applica
tions will be accepted for the following year.

allowing the current class to graduate and
the next entering class to start with a clean
slate.
Samuelson and Scott Bukatman, an asso
ciate professor of art who will direct under
graduate studies for the new program, said
interest in the new programs has been over
whelming. The film and media studies pro
gram has sponsored several events during
this academic year, and two more events are
scheduled before commencement.

One of the events, "Urban Trau
ma and the Metropolitan Imagina
tion: The City in Contemporary
Media," a conference sponsored by
the film and media studies program,
will run from this Thursday through
Saturday.
A second event on June 1 will in
clude the homecoming of Stanford
alumnus and film director Alexan
der Payne fora screening of his
Oscar-nominated film "Sideways."

The new major and minor are de
signed to have live different concen
trations: film history, film culture,
film and performance, film and
technology and film criticism. An
internship program will also be es
tablished for students who partici
pate.
Changes have been a long time
coming, Bukatman said. The pro
gram was in the works eight years
ago when he was hired, but the real
legwork began two or three years
ago.
"Stanford recognized that there
is a field out there," lie said. "Mov
ing image culture contours our lives,
and a program like this helps every

body deal with that."
Samuelson and Bukatman said
the University has been very sup
portive of the arts in general and the
development of the program in par
ticular. Providing resources, sup
port and promoting a campus-wide
effort to expand the arts, Stanford
administrators have been vital to
the creation of the program,
Samuelson said.
Unlike similar programs at peer
institutions, Stanford's major and
minor programs will not provide vo
cational training in filmmaking.
"We are not becoming a film
school in the sense of UCLA or
USC." Samuelson explained. "The

program will help students who
want to work in Hollywood, in
screenwriting, production, film
studies, film history and the study of
film â€” to work in all aspects of the
industry."
It is uncertain how many stu
dents will decide to pursue the new
major, Samuelson said, hut there
will not he a cap to the number of
majors or minors. Bukatman said he
has already seen enrollments in his
classes double during the prelimi
nary stages of the program.
"Bodies in the room is a really
nice thing," Bukatman said. "We've
had so many seniors ask 'Why
couldn't you have done this earlier?'
