A new major and minor program in film
and media studies will be introduced to the
Communication and Art and Art History
Departments this fall. The existing two-year
documentary film master's program, will

also be turned into a master's of fine arts, or
MFA, program in the fall of 2006.
The Faculty Senate will vote on finalizing
these programs during its May 12 meeting.
"It'll be about ideas, understanding sto
ries, genre, the language of film," said Com
munication Prof. Kris Samuelson, who will
serve as the inaugural chair of the new pro
gram for the first three years.
To make way for the MFA program, the
current MA program in filmmaking will not
be admitting a new class this fall. Applica
tions will be accepted for the following year.

allowing the current class to graduate and
the next entering class to start with a clean
slate.
Samuelson and Scott Bukatman, an asso
ciate professor of art who will direct under
graduate studies for the new program, said
interest in the new programs has been over
whelming. The film and media studies pro
gram has sponsored several events during
this academic year, and two more events are
scheduled before commencement.
