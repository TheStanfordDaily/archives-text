# Doctor-patient communication linked to music
## Listening to music makes for a better doctor 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Some medical students might have a better
idea about how to communicate with their pa
tients after attending last night's lecture
"Music and Medicine: The Art of Listening,"
which featured the St. Lawrence String Quar
tet and National Public Radio commentator

Robert Kapilow.
Kapilow, also a composer, drew parallels
between listening to music and connecting
with other people.
This is the second time Kapilow and the
quartet have played at the School of Medicine.
In February, they hosted a seminar on how to
listen during patient interviews for first-year
medical students.

"We're going to have fun," Kapilow said at
the start of the talk. "I promise that it will be
nowhere near as embarrassing as putting on
one of those hospital gowns."
With help from the quartet, he analyzed
two movements of Antonin Dvorak's String
Quartet No. 12 in F Major, Op. 96. But instead
of sitting back a passively listening to
the music, audience members were
required to clap, hum and sing along.
Event coordinator Audrey Shafer,
professor of anesthesiology and di
rector of the arts, humanities and
medicine program at the Medical
School, said she believes people in the
medical field have a lot to learn from
musicians.
"I would like people togain a fresh
perspective on health, illness and the
practice of health care," Schafer said.
"I hope that attendees are challenged
to think about listening to music as a
metaphor for listening to patients."
Most of the medical students who
attended agreed the talk was both en
tertaining and informative.
"Everything that he said about lis
tening was true," said seventh-year
medical student Nirav Bhakta.
"However, in certain situations, it's
hard to fully listen to someone when
there are other things going on. For
patient-doctor communication, the
biggest distraction is time."
The string quartet formed in 1989
and joined Stanford I Jniversity as the
Ensemble in Residence in the sum
mer of 1998. In addition to teaching in
the Music Department, the group ex
periments in taking music outside of
the traditional setting.
"We want to bring music to the
lives of many different people in dif
ferent groups," said Barry Shiftman, a
violinist in the quartet. "Part of our
desire is to use music to build bridges
between music and other depart
ments."
The quartet has collaborated with
Kapilow on a number of projects.
"It's inspiring to have someone
you really respect right there," Vio
iinist Geoff Nutall said of Kapilow.
"Every time we're with Rob, we have
these 'a-ha' moments where we'll re
alize things about a piece that we've
never thought of before."
Kapilow closed yesterday's pre
sentation by reminding audience
members that listening is anything
but a passive experience.
"Real communication between
people is a dialogue, not a mono
logue," Kapilow said. "Someone
must be speaking and someone must
be listening. It is what the listener
hears that makes a sound."
