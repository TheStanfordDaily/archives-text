# Philosophy encyclopedia seeks funds
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philos
ophy, or SEP — one of the most widely
used philosophy resources on the Internet
— is attempting to raise more than $1 mil
lion to keep online access free.
The encyclopedia is the brainchild of
John Perry, professor of philosophy, and
Edward Zalta, senior research scholar at

the Stanford Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information, or CSLI. Zalta is
the encyclopedia's principal editor.
The project's first working prototype,
funded by CSLI. was completed in 1998.
Since then, the encyclopedia has received
six grants totaling about $1.6 million —
five from the National Endowment for
the Humanities and the National Science
Foundation and one from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation, a private organiza-

tion that awards grant money to projects
pertaining to higher education and pur
suits in the arts, environmentalism and
public affairs.
This year, the SEP was awarded a Na
tional Endowment for the Humanities
Challenge Grant, which matches funds
from the world-wide library community
at a one-to-three ratio.

The Challenge Grant and the
other most recent grant — also from
the National Endowment for the Hu
manities— total $65(),(XX) and must
be matched by private donations,
Zalta said. The grants themselves
only cover partial operating costs.
"Basically, the SEP is trying to
raise a $4,125 million endowment,
and this will cover its annual budget
of just under $2(H),(KX)," Zalta said. "If
we can do that, we can keep the SEP
open-access and freely available for

the long-term."
This leaves about $1,125 million
for Stanford to raise from private and
corporate contributors.
"We will ask for small donations
from professional philosophers, read
ers in other academic disciplines and
our non-academic readers," Zalta
said. "We will also be asking for larg
er contributions from private individ
uals with an interest in philosophy."
The encyclopedia is tapped by stu
dents and scholars as a reliable and
impartial resource for information on
important topics in philosophy. The
site averages 4(X).(XX) hits a week, and
it is the first Google match for queries
including "voluntary euthanasia,"
"feminist ethics" and "animal con

sciousness.
"I use the encyclopedia all the
time to do research for papers and to
review material that 1 didn't think I
understood in class," said Shawn
Standefer, a philosophy co-terminal
student. "There are some topics that
still need entries, but the ones that are
done are really useful."
Encyclopedia entries are con
tributed by distinguished professors
and philosophers from around the
world. They are also solicited by invi
tation from the encyclopedia's edito
rial board, which includes three Phi
losophy Profs. Ken Taylor, Dagfinn
Follesdal and Allen Wood.
Zalta stressed that the encyclope
dia is a perpetual work-in-progress.

"Authors are given Web-based,
remote-editing access to private
copies of their entries on our server,"
he said. "As new ideas and research
are published, they can update their
entries."
The fact that access to the encyclo
pedia is free is significant to its stu
dent users.
"I've been using the SEP since I
was a freshman philosophy major at
UC Berkeley," said Lindsay
McLeary, a philosophy graduate stu
dent at Stanford. "It's an essential re
source for people from all areas of
philosophy and the social sciences."

Philosophy is available online at
