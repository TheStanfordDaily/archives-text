# Philosophy encyclopedia seeks funds
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philos
ophy, or SEP — one of the most widely
used philosophy resources on the Internet
— is attempting to raise more than $1 mil
lion to keep online access free.
The encyclopedia is the brainchild of
John Perry, professor of philosophy, and
Edward Zalta, senior research scholar at

the Stanford Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information, or CSLI. Zalta is
the encyclopedia's principal editor.
The project's first working prototype,
funded by CSLI. was completed in 1998.
Since then, the encyclopedia has received
six grants totaling about $1.6 million —
five from the National Endowment for
the Humanities and the National Science
Foundation and one from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation, a private organiza-

tion that awards grant money to projects
pertaining to higher education and pur
suits in the arts, environmentalism and
public affairs.
This year, the SEP was awarded a Na
tional Endowment for the Humanities
Challenge Grant, which matches funds
from the world-wide library community
at a one-to-three ratio.
