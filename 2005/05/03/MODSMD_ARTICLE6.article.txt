# May marks API heritage celebration
## May recognizes API's historic link to Stanford 
### CHANTEL RUSH 
Asian Pacific Islander, or API, Her
itage Month is underway, starting with
yesterday's reception and continuing
throughout the month of May with a
speaker series on relevant issues, includ
ing the portrayal of Asians in the mod
ern media and globalization's impact on
the population.
Sophomore Cindy Ng, director of the
Asian-American Activities Center, or
A3C, said that the events planned will be
significant for all students, not only
those of Asian or Pacific Islander de
scent.
The month-long celebration began as
a nationally recognized week in 1979, Ng
said. In 1992, President George H.W.
Bush and Congress lengthened the
recognition to a month. May was chosen
because the first-recorded Japanese im
migrant to the United States arrived in
May 1843 and the Transcontinental
Railroad, built largely by Asian and Pa
cific Islander immigrants, was complet
ed in May 1869.
Strong historical and contemporary
ties exist between the University and the
nation's Asian Pacific Islander popula
tion. This academic year, Asian Pacific
Islanders constitute 12 percent of the
student population and 11 percent of the
faculty. Ng noted that since founder Le
land Stanford made a large amount of
his fortune on the railroad built by Asian
and Pacific Islander laborers, they
helped amass the wealth that made
the founding of Stanford University
possible.
As a result of these connections,
API Heritage Month has been inte
grated into campus for as long as it
has existed, Ng said.
Yesterday's kick-off event was
only the first of many scheduled fes

tivities to commemorate API Her
itage this month.
Students and faculty members
can visit the art exhibition featuring
the work of Asian Pacific Islander
student artists, which opened during
yesterday's reception at Tresidder
Memorial Union. On Thursday
there will be a talk on the "Repre
sentation of Minorities in the

Media" and Stanford Taiko will host
its spring concert this Saturday.
Many students who attended the
reception said they had not been
aware of API Heritage Month be
fore arriving on campus.
The month's activities are jointly
financed by the Asian-American
Student Association and various re
lated student groups.
