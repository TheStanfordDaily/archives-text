My associates
are looking for
undergrads doing
the smart thing
— always
wearing bike
helmets when biking!
If we see you, we 11 give you a
gift card for Subway or any other Stanford Dining location. PLUS
you'll be entered in a drawing to win $1000 at the end of the quarter!
Now you can buy a high-quality universal
fit helmet for only $15 at the Campus
Bike Shop ($35 retail value)!
