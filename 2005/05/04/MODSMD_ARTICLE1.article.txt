# Janitors need OK to come to campus
## 
### SARA INÉS CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jose Gonzalez, a supervisor at
American Building Maintenance, or
ABM, the company the University
contracts to provide janitorial services,
recently announced that Stanford
workers cannot step foot on campus
without company permission.
The announcement was made on
April 21 to about 60 to 70janitors. Sev
eral Stanford students involved with
the English tutoring program Habla
La Noche were also present to pro
mote a worker-student barbecue that
weekend.
Senior Patricia Hernandez said the
supervisor told the workers present
that ABM had made the decision to
prevent them from coming to campus
in conjunction with the University.
"He said that he talked to the Uni
versity and they said if workers wanted
to come visit campus they had to noti
fy the ABM office first," Hernandez
said. "His excuse for it was that it was
for their safety, so you can be safe so
that we know if you are here or not —
it didn't really make any sense."
Several ABM workers, who asked
to remain anonymous, confirmed Her
nandez' claim, adding that Gonzalez
said that workers must request permis
sion two days in advance of coming to

campus.
Gonzalez, an operations manager
for ABM on campus, confirmed that
this was indeed a new policy. He cited
the workers' safety as the basis for the
decision, adding that it is a national
ABM policy that workers can only he
on the grounds of their workplaces
during employment hours.
The contract that all workers sign
with ABM states, "You are permitted
on the customer's premises only dur
ing your working hours, unless you
have the approval of your supervisor."
The difference in this case is that
Stanford is accessible to the general
public. No one interviewed for this
story differentiated between workers
being prohibited from entering the
buildings where they work and being
prevented from visiting open areas on
campus, such as White Plaza.
"It's a public area, but basically just
for their safety that was a decision of
both ABM and Stanford employees."
Gonzalez said, refusing to identify
which Stanford employees were in
volved in the decision-making process.
"We were the ultimate decision mak
ers."
Gonzalez said there had been an in
cident involving workers that prompt
ed the new policy, but would not elab-
orate on the details.
"Basically, anything that goes
wrong [on campus], the janitors are al
ways blamed," Gonzalez said. "There
are things that happen around here
that are definitely not being done by
janitorial folks. Buildings have been
vandalized, there have been thefts
and, again, right away, [the Stanford
police] are interviewing the janitors."
Gonzalez said it was unfair for the
police to instinctively suspect the
workers.
Kent Edwards, the Stanford pro
ject manager for ABM said of the pol
icy, "I think it was taken out of context
and that's not what it said." He refused
comment further. Deputy Ken Bates
of the Stanford Police Department
called the policy "some kind of fabri
cation" and said that in his 15 years at
Stanford, "it's been nothing but a great
working relationship with ABM."
In response to the new policy, sev
eral workers said they did not like
being told by the company what they
can or cannot do during their free time,
but that such rules were not unusual.

"It'sstupid, they're not going to tell
me what to do," said one anonymous
worker, who plays soccer on campus
during weekends. "I'm going to come
anyway."

One worker said, "Everything that
goes wrong — it's the janitors. We're
here to work and keep our jobs."
"We're not saying they can't come,
just let us know," Gonzalez said.
"They can come any time they want.
This is a beautiful campus and they
have a right to show their kids where
they put in 40 hours a week."
The union that represents the
ABM workers on Stanford's campus,
SEIU Local 1877, could not be
reached for comment.
