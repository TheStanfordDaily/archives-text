# Tuition freeze plan at Univ. of Wisconsin

(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. - A triumvirate of
Democratic Madison state legislators intro
duced a plan to increase student financial aid and
lree/.e tuition for lower-income in-state students
throughout the University of Wisconsin System
Monday at the Red Gym.
Rep. Spencer Black and Rep. Joseph Parisi,
along with Rep. Mark Pocan, joined students
from UW College Democrats and Associated
Students of Madison to announce they will in
troduce a legislative amendment to the 2005-07
biennial budget that is currently under consider
ation by the Legislature.
"Your generation should not be the first gen
eration of Americans to have less opportunity
than the generation that came before you."
Parisi said of the need to address rising tuition
rates.
The proposal, which Pocan plans to introduce
as an amendment when the Joint Finance Com

mittee considers UW's budget in the coming
weeks, would effectively freeze tuition for stu
dents whose family income is less than the state
household median of $46.(XK). This would be ac
complished through a $17 million increase in
general purpose revenue appropriations for the
Wisconsin Higher Education Grants program
over the next two years.
UW tuition rose 3K percent over the last bi
ennium as the state, struggling to cope with a
$3.2 billion budget deficit cut $250 million in
funding for the university system. Gov. Jim
Doyle's 2005-07 budget proposal projects an ad
ditional 14 percent tuition increase in the face of
the state's current $1.6 billion deficit.
Pocan acknowledged the realities of the bud
get deficit but said there is still wiggle room to
address priorities such as access to higher educa
tion. He hoped the Republican-controlled JFC
would recognize the economic benefits a well ed
ucated workforce provides for the state.
"I'm hoping thaPwe can convince the legisla
tive members of [the JCF] that as much as it's im

portant to invest in things like Wal-Mart and
other things they put literally hundreds of mil
lions of dollars of tax breaks into. The minimum
we can do is provide a small amount to make
sure all students have access to a quality educa
tion," Pocan said.
Mike Prentiss, spokesperson for JFC co-chair
Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, said he is hesi
tant to judge the proposed legislation, especially
because the lawmakers introduced it to the UW
campus before mentioning it to their colleagues
at the Capitol.
"1 think we'd be a little cautious of any pro
posal that... pits the less wealthy against the even
less wealthy with artificial cutoffs," Prentiss said.
"We want to make sure everyone that's qualified
... has access to higher education."
Lawmakers need to be very careful when re
viewing this, Prentiss added.
Prentiss also questioned where the legislators
think they will obtain the money for an increase
instate funding when the state is operating at its
current deficit.
