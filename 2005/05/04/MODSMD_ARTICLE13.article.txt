# Alcohol likely involved in incident
## Student dies from balcony fall at party 
### AUBRE ANDRUS BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. â€” An
18-year-old University of Wisconsin
male fell from a balcony on the 500
block of Mifflin Street Saturday night
as the annual block party came to a
close. Alcohol is said to be a factor in
the accident, according to a police re
lease.
Madison Police officers arrived at
the Mifflin Street house slightly be
fore midnight. The male was taken to
a local hospital, although his current
condition is unknown, the release
said.
According to Sgt. Dave McCaw,
prior to Saturday, Officer Tony Fiore
prepared the Special Events Team
fora potential balcony fall or col
lapse of a balcony during the Mifflin
Street Block Party.
"His main objective was to get a
good discussion going so everyone
on the SET team was prepared if this
happened," McCaw said. "Fiore was
really on the ball. We need to be pre
pared."
Fiore researched an incident in
which a second-story balcony col
lapsed in Chicago killing 12 people
during a party in 2003, McCaw
added.

"The Madison Police Depart
ment has been prepping for what-ifs.
We need to be ready and do the best
job," McCaw said.
Aid. Mike Verveer, District 4,
said although he is not sure whether
the balcony accident on Mifflin
Street this weekend was serious or
not, he knew police had left Mifflin
Street around 10 p.m. Saturday night.
"When it happened, there were
no cops or emergency personnel in
the neighborhood," he said. "They
had left approximately two hours be
fore the young man apparently fell."
However, there were no visible
house parties going on when the po
lice officers left the block party,
Verveer said, adding there were few
people outside probably due to the
"chilly" weather.
The city of Madison and Mifflin
Street have seen more than one bal
cony fall over the past year.
University of Wisconsin freshmen
Sean Weas fell from a College Court
apartment's balcony in January and
former UW freshmen Jason Gratzl
fell from the balcony at 453 West
Mifflin Street in August.
The balcony Grat/l fell from was
raised approximately a foot higher
before the Mifflin Street Block
Party.
