# But that's not the point...
## DIY Culture 
### 
This might be odd to admit in my col
umn, but 1 don't read The Daily
every day. I pick it up about three
days a week, read the features columns,
the editorials and do the crossword puzzle.
What I've learned from my irregular
Daily reading is that Stanford students, at
least those writing columns for The Daily,
are obsessed with certain perceptions
about our noble institution. The primary
two obsessions, in no particular order, are
how everyone at Stanford is ugly and how
everyone at Stanford has poor social skills.
These are some of the most engrained
stereotypes that Stanford has, and they
drive me absolutely insane. We've inherit
ed these beliefs from generation after gen
eration of Stanford students, just as we've
inherited the Band, the basketball team
and Full Moon on the Quad.
But the Band, while occasionally an
noying in its own right, is a good Stanford

tradition, and it has
earned its place. How
ever, these negative
beliefs about the stu
dent population have
no basis in reality, and
there is no reason to
continue to believe
them. I would like to
focus on the most per
vasive stereotypes and
address each one indi-

vidually to explain why we need to excise
these beliefs from our campus culture.
The most common stereotype is the
idea that Stanford students don't date.
Now, 1 know my "1 love being single" arti
cle didn't help (one friend said, it "gave
girls a new reason" not to date guys like
him). It's true — I don't want to "date" in
the conventional sense of the word, but
I'm not a symptom of some evil Stanford
anti-dating disease. I'm just one girl out of
thousands, and my guess is that most of
the rest of the girls here aren't like me —
they are either dating, or they want to be.
Related to this stereotype is the idea
that Stanford students are.all socially awk
ward — i.e. someone doesn't ask you for
your phone number, so they should be
banished from the dating world for "not
knowing how to do things." I honestly be
lieve that no one ever really knows exact
ly what to do — that's what the movie
"Swingers" was all about, that's why we
have "The Rules," that's the only reason
why Cosmopolitan magazine is still in
print. And yet even with this so-called
wealth of information no one knows the
right time to call someone. Is it three days?
Or is that too calculated?
If Stanford students are socially awk
ward, then so is the rest of the world. And
okay, probably a disproportionate
amount of us were nerds in high school
and are now figuring out the dating and
social world. But none of us are stupid, so
we can learn pretty fast. And I'm still not
sure that we need to worry about the rules
anyway. Straightforwardness is more im
portant than anything, as long as all is
done in good taste.
The most aggravating stereotype, and
the one least based in reality, is that Stan
ford students — especially Stanford girls
— are ugly. Logistically speaking, it just
doesn't make sense to say that the popu
lation of one place is uglier than the pop
ulation of the country at large. Specifical
ly, it is completely false to assert that be
cause you are smart, you are more likely
to be unattractive. There is a Theface
book.com group called, "God gave with
two hands," celebrating what is, accord
ing to its members, the rare union of in
telligence and beauty. Are you kidding
me?
Instead of continuing to say, "Stanford
girls are ugly," what people should be say
ing is: "The grass is greener on the other
side." You may think that Stanford girls
are uglier than girls at other colleges or in
the so-called real world, but you're sorely
mistaken. You've just seen Stanford girls
in jeans and a T-shirts often enough to de
glamorize anyone.
Not to mention, chances are girls in
other places aren't nearly as articulate or
intelligent. If you'd rather hold onto your
belief in ugly Stanford women, then I en
courage you to report back when you've
met some hot girl in a bar somewhere
down the line and she turns out to have the
brain of a turnip.
I almost feel like I'm contributing to
our school-wide fascination with these
ideas just by writing about them. So here's
my overall point, just to be absolutely
clear: Don't just assume that because peo
ple say something that it is true and that
you should go along it. We're all smarter
than that. And no matter how true you
think these stereotypes are, don't just act
self-defeated and superior. It should be
your duty to contribute something of
yourself to the Stanford culture. So stop
reading The Daily — well, OK, stop read
ing those silly columns — and do some
thing about it.
