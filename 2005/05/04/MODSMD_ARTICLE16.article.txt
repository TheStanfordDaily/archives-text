What do Japanese woodblock prints and interactive elec
tronic media have in common? Not only are both currently fea
tured in the Cantor Arts Center, but they are also the focus of
exhibitions shaped by the contributions of Stanford students.
The students involved in the Web Projects display situated in
the Rowland K. Rebele Digital Room in the museum created
the 10 pieces and the online components. Their work was part
of the class Web Projects taught last winter quarter by Gail
Wight, assistant professor of art and art history. After their
year-long display is over, the room will continue to be used for
similar digital works, according to Patience Young, the curator
for education at Cantor.
"Shini-e:The Performance of Death in Japanese Woodblock
Prints," which opened April 13, is an exhibition of 27 commer
cial commemorative prints of famous Japanese actors in the tra
dition of the "Floating World" of early-modern Japan. The ex
hibition was put together by undergraduate participants in a
fall-quarter class co-taught by Art and Art History Prof. Melin
da Takeuchi and Visiting Lecturer Christine Guth. The stu
dents involved with the woodblock prints were responsible for
selecting, organizing, researching and describing the pieces
from a 365-print collection owned by Albert Dien, a Stanford
professor emeritus.
From class to exhibit
When Takeuchi and Guth found the collection, they decided
to put together a course to prepare an exhibition at Stanford.
Nine students enrolled, running the gamut from art history ma
jors to economics and computer science majors.
"We advertised this class terrified that nobody would want to
take this class on this totally obscure subject," Takeuchi said.
The majority of the students had had no prior exposure to
Japanese art. According to the professors, it was a major task to
introduce students to the area and facilitate research into a body
of literature that was mostly in Japanese. Once the class had got
ten sufficient background in the area, students submitted pro
posals for how to best organize the exhibition. Once that was
settled, the class went about culling down the prints, research
ing their history and writing the explanatory text that accompa
nies them in the museum.
"The goal of the class was to put together an exhibition that
taught the public how to appreciate something so obscure, yet
remarkable and wonderful," Takeuchi said. "We created some
thing wonderful out of chaos."
The class opted fora smaller, temporary exhibition so that it
would be open for the students to see their work, given that ac
cess to one of Cantor's major galleries would have required
waiting two to three years. Though the exhibition was largely
prepared by Takeuchi & Guth's students, the instructors still
had to take care of many of the technical aspects, including pick
ing the wall, frame and matting colors, after the class had ended.
According to Takeuchi, there are a number of complex rules
and processes for putting together exhibitions that made the
final stages difficult.

"It is supposed to be a teaching museum," she said. "One
might wish that they could streamline their processes a bit. But
the results were worth it."
The difficulties that Takeuchi encountered in putting to
gether the exhibition of Japanese death prints are not abnormal,
given the complex process for exhibition design at Cantor. Ac
cording to Sarah Miller, the exhibitions coordinator at Cantor,
large exhibitions can take up to five years to plan, while even the
smallest usually require at least six months. The size of the ex
hibition gallery plays a significant role in the amount of time and
effort that it takes to put together, as the three galleries range in
size from 250 sq. feet to more than 4,000 sq. feet.
"For our biggest exhibitions, most staff in the museum be
come involved at some point or another," Miller said. "Our ex
hibition process is very big and includes many documents, time
lines, group meetings and deliverables."
While ideas for exhibitions are usually generated by cura
tors, the Japanese woodblock print and digital media exhibits
are just a couple of examples of the occasional contributions
from Stanford classes. "On the Edge: Contemporary Chinese
Artists Encounter the West," an exhibition that closed this past
Sunday, was based on a seminar taught last spring.
According to Young, classes in the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric, or PWR, taught by lecturer John Tinker have on oc
casion contributed to Cantor exhibits. An exhibit that opened
this past summer, "Question: An Experiment that Provokes
Questions about Art and Its Presentation in Museums," incor
porated exhibition ideas from brainstorming in Tinker's "Ob
jects of Argument" course. And his course this coming fall quar
ter will work on ideas for an exhibition dealing with the theme
of conflict slated for the summer of 2006.
Stanford's close ties to the arts
Stanford faculty members and outside scholars get involved
in promoting or designing exhibitions as well. "Revolutionary
Tides: The Art of the Political Poster 1914-1989," which opens
in September, is guest-curated by Jeffery Schnapps, the director
of the Stanford Humanities Lab.
Other ways that the Stanford community may get involved
with Cantor include symposia and lectures organized around
the themes of exhibitions. Takeuchi put together a symposium
for the beginning of the "Shini-e" exhibition and invited a num
ber of the world-class scholars whose work was researched in its
preparation to speak.
"The involvement of the Stanford community is very much
at the heart of what our exhibitions set out to accomplish,"
Miller said.
This Stanford focus is also evident in the balance of exhibi
tions and in the selection of materials for Cantor-organized ex
hibitions. Permanent exhibitions are based on Cantor collec
tions and typically last six to eight months, while temporary ex
hibitions generally rotate for about three months. Usually six of
the nine exhibitions that Cantor displays in a calendar year are
organized in-house. Only one of these exhibits is typically lent
out to other museums. Cantor tries to use its own collections in
exhibitions to whatever extent possible, sometimes supple
menting them with loans to create a full exhibition.
