# Big Sib/Little Sib programs bring family bonding to the Farm

### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Spencer Chu first arrived at Stanford,
he was bewildered by the large number of Asian£
on campus in comparison to how many there
were in his home state of Kansas. Thanks to his:
"big sibs" at Stanford, however, Chu is now ac-;
tively involved in the Asian-American communi
ty through organizations such as the Stanford".
Asian American Activism Committee.
Chu's "siblings," or "sibs," are upperclassmen;
assigned to him by the Asian American New Stu
dent Orientation Committee, or AANSOC, Sib
Program. Started more than 15 years ago, the Big
Sib Little Sib Program matches incoming Asian-
American freshmen with Asian-American up-,
perclassmen in order to help freshmen and trans-;
fers adjust to life at Stanford.
Many programs exist that are similar to the
AANSOC program: the Black Recruitment and
Orientation Committee, or BROC, and the Stan
ford American Indian Organization, or SAIO,
also pair up freshmen and upperclassmen.
The Harold and Libby Ziff Center hosts "J
-sib," a mentoring program for the Jewish com
munity. Also, a new sib program was also started
this year for the Latino community. Called Ori
entacion, the program will be in place for the
Class of 2009.
"There have been little sibs and big sibs in the
past, but these have been done through individu
al coordinators and not a specific organization,"
said sophomore Frankie Preciado, this year's
"Politica Committee Chair" for MEChA. "We're
trying to put together a formal support base using
the AANSOC and BROC programs as models."
AANSOC matches big sibs and little sibs —-*
about 450 each year — based on information
sheets that students submit during the summer
which details their academic interests, musical
tastes, partying habits and other characteristics.
The coordinators then put together a "family,"
generally made up of two big sibs and two little
sibs — one big sib and one little sib of each gen
der — although family sizes may vary.
"It's a very long process, but we try as hard as
we can to create sib families that have members
who are not only compatible and can have lots of
fun together, but who can also learn and grow
with one another," said senior Wenfei Xie, one of
this year's six program coordinators for
AANSOC.
The programs organize activities throughout
the year as a chance for all sib families to get to
gether, but everything else is left up to the indi
vidual families to decide. At AANSOC, funding
for large sib program events, such as organized
study breaks, comes from the annual "Screw
Your Sib Dance," where big sibs try their hands at
playing matchmaker.
"It's great because the members of the pro
gram pay a small fee fora really great dance, and
that money comes back to them many times dur
ing the course of the year through the other
events that we put on," Xie said.
Activities that individual "families" hold can
vary from skydiving to paintballing to pearl milk
tea excursions. The coordinators added, howev
er, that families vary greatly in the things they do
together and how closely they bond.
"Some families spend lots of time together and
some barely see each other," said AANSOC co
ordinator Dana Ung, a junior. "It depends a lot
on both the big sibs and the little sibs."
Many program participants attested to the fact
that their experiences in the program varied de
pending on the dynamics of the sib family.
Junior Katarina Ling admitted that although
her big sibs made her experience as a little sib
memorable, her own experience as a big sib was
not as fulfilling.
"We had three big sibs and one
little sib, and the dispioportion was
weird," she said.
Junior Linda I ran, who has been
both a little sib and a big sib in the
program, suggested that some ol the
less-than-positive experiences might

be improved through more careful
matching of upperclassmen and
freshmen and better support for big
sibs
" I he process by which coordina
tors match big sibs and little sibs
needs more transparency and care
ful thought," she said. "Big sibs can
also be better prepared to interact
with freshmen in terms of being sen
sitive t<> their needs and back
grounds."
I ing also mentioned that some
students may see the program as ex

elusive since there isn't a sib pro
gram for all races or ethnic groups.
Some Asian American students said
they did not sign up to be in a sib
family because they said they felt
that it might limit their social inter
actions.
For example, sophomore Reid
Yokoyama did not respond to the
letter he got during the summer be
fore his freshman year asking him to
submit an information sheet to be
matched with a big sib.
When I heard about the Big Sib
little Sib Program I thought it was
cliquish and too self-segregating — I
didn t need the support group that it
seemed to offer," he said.
However, Yokoyama plans on
being a big sib next year after be
coming more involved in the Asian
American community this year.
"I now realize the value of such a
program in providing an atmosphere
for Asian American students to so
cialize and get to know one anoth
er," he said.
Iran said that frequent attacks
on ethnic organizations or pro
grams lor being exclusive are often
misleading.
"Ethnic and / or minority-fo
cused programming does not work
to segregate, but serves to offer ad
ditional support to historically
marginalized groups," she said.
Freshman Maggie Biel, who is
ol Polish origin, was persuaded by
her roommate Gloria Hoang to
join I loang's sib family. Hesitant at
liist. Maggie found that the pro
gram was a great way to meet mo
tivated Stanford freshmen and up
perclassmen.
"I believe that cultural identity is
a very real and important thing to
discover in college, thus AANSOC
is only keeping it real by catering to
the Asian Stanford population,"
Biel said.
