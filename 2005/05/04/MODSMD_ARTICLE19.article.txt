## Editorial Returning Res Ed staff process needs to be re-examined 
### 
As another school year draws to a close,
the selection of new dorm / house stall has
once again come and gone. It's an exhaus
tive process that includes written applica
tions, numerous rounds of group and indi
vidual interviews and a mystical method of
deciding just who best fits the job.
In recent years, many a person have
cried foul (or at least wry resentment)
over the phenomenon of dorm nepotism:
the eerily uncanny way in which students
who currently reside in a dorm or house
seem to end up getting hired for next
year's staff. It's an implied concession that
— no matter how much is done to make
the process fair and equal on paper — as
long as interviews are conducted by cur
rent staff members this pattern is unlikely
to change.
Another phenomenon that seems to
go largely unnoticed in the process is the
equally uncanny way in which current
staff members who have another year of
housing can automatically stay on in their
role for another year. Granted, it is offi
cially the decision of the Resident Fellows
or other members of Residential Educa
tion whether these staff members are wel
come to return, but we believe that the lax
manner in which this process is conducted
often results in nothing more than rubber
stamping.
It is true that experience is useful;
many staff members rely on returning
veterans to help ease the transition to a

new year and allow things to be im
proved and run more smoothly. Yet hav
ing experience should not immediately
imply that that person is the best candi
date for the job. Being on staff is a unique
opportunity for both staff members and
their residents, and it seems unfair to au
tomatically limit the number of available
positions if current staff members decide
they want to stay on board. This system
could lead to complacency in job perfor
mance, decreasing quality of life for all
residents.
Bear in mind that we are not leveling
any accusations at anyone — we merely
think there should be a more rigorous
process for maintaining a staff position
from year to year. The current feedback
system for staff evaluations is atrocious,
sequestered inside a criminally lengthy
Housing Survey that too many people are
loathe to even attempt, much less com
plete. At the very least, when a staff mem
bers declares that they wish to stay for an
other year, their current residents should
be surveyed, and some form of re-inter
view process should be implemented.
We understand that the interview pro
cess itself is already arduous enough for
all involved, but shouldn't it make sense
to do everything possible to ensure that
everyone has the best residential experi
ence? Stanford students and Residential
Education deserve no less.
