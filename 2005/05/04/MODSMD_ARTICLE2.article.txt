# Great Debate starts today
## Stanford sends top three debaters to face Cal in annual debate 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the football and basketball
seasons are over, the Stanford-UC
Berkeley rivalry is still alive and well.
Today, the two universities will lock
horns during the annual Great De
bate, hosted this year on Cal's campus,
featuring the top three debaters from
each school.
The teams are tied three a piece in
the six previous Great Debates, so a
win by either team would give its
school a definitive edge.
"The rivalry infuses a bit of life
into the debate outside of the content
itself," said sophomore Faris Mohi
uddin, a competitor in the upcoming
event and head of recruitment for the
Stanford Debate Society. "Playing
up the rivalry is our way of getting
Stanford and Cal kids excited to at
tend the event and hopefully learn
something meaningful in the
process."
The debate will focus on America's
role in genocide occurring around the
world. The official resolution being de
bated is: "When the international
community fails to act, the United
States should act unilaterally to pre
vent genocide." Stanford's team will
negate the resolution
The competition will also employ a
unique debate format. Whereas the
Stanford team is used to parliamen
tary-style debate, the Cal students are
more familiar with policy debate.
Thus, the Great Debate will fuse the
two styles in a manner that Stanford
debate coach Matthew Fraser hopes
will appeal to the event's audience of
about 300 students.
"Policy-style debate focuses exten
sively on evidence preparation on a
debate topic, and de-emphasizes de
livery and off-the-cuff wit," Fraser
said. "Parliamentary debate does just
the opposite. The format was designed
to provide a compromise between the
two styles so that we would have a de
bate that is educational, yet fun and en
joyable for the audience, and also so
that the strengths of each style of de
bate could be represented in the com
petition."
In addition to the Mohuiddin, Stan
lord's team will feature junior Sihong
Chan and freshman Sarah Victor
"Sihong, Faris and Sarah are some
of our strongest debaters this year,
and their speaking styles and argu
mentation lend themselves to this
type of debate," said Johanna Wald
man. president of the Stanford De
bate Society. "Sihong and Faris both
qualified for Nationals in parliamen
tary debate and Sarah had a success
ful freshman year."
The three debaters hope to add one
more victory to an already successful
season, during which multiple de
baters finished within the top-10 at
tournaments nationwide. Fraser
added that a win at Berkeley would be

an excellent conclusion to the debate
season.
'"This is a very important event to
the Stanford team because it is a
chance to go toe-to-toe with IJC
Berkeley, a historical rival and also a
strong force in policy debate," he said.
"Berkeley tends to think that they
have the upper hand in any form of ev
idence-based debate against us, but in
truth we have some brilliant thinkers
and orators on the Stanford team.
Even though Berkeley selects the bulk
of the judges and has won the coin (lip
for six of the last seven years, Stanford
has tied them at three to three in over
all debates."
Because the debate occurs outside
of the regular season and follows an
unusual format, efforts are made to
make the event less formal and more
appealing to those who choose to at
tend. And of course, the Stanford-Cal
rivalry generates enough enthusiasm
in its own right.
"A purely academic debate about
genocide might not seem palatable,
but the nature of the competition itself
makes the debate more intriguing,"
Mohuiddin said. "It gives a reason for
people to clap and cheer when they
hear a good argument, since they're
not just supporting an argument but
their own school."
