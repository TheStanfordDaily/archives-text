# Great Debate starts today
## Stanford sends top three debaters to face Cal in annual debate 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the football and basketball
seasons are over, the Stanford-UC
Berkeley rivalry is still alive and well.
Today, the two universities will lock
horns during the annual Great De
bate, hosted this year on Cal's campus,
featuring the top three debaters from
each school.
The teams are tied three a piece in
the six previous Great Debates, so a
win by either team would give its
school a definitive edge.
"The rivalry infuses a bit of life
into the debate outside of the content
itself," said sophomore Faris Mohi
uddin, a competitor in the upcoming
event and head of recruitment for the
Stanford Debate Society. "Playing
up the rivalry is our way of getting
Stanford and Cal kids excited to at
tend the event and hopefully learn
something meaningful in the
process."
The debate will focus on America's
role in genocide occurring around the
world. The official resolution being de
bated is: "When the international
community fails to act, the United
States should act unilaterally to pre
vent genocide." Stanford's team will
negate the resolution
The competition will also employ a
unique debate format. Whereas the
Stanford team is used to parliamen
tary-style debate, the Cal students are
more familiar with policy debate.
Thus, the Great Debate will fuse the
two styles in a manner that Stanford
debate coach Matthew Fraser hopes
will appeal to the event's audience of
about 300 students.
"Policy-style debate focuses exten
sively on evidence preparation on a
debate topic, and de-emphasizes de
livery and off-the-cuff wit," Fraser
