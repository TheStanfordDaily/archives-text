## Freedom of communication 
### 
Free speech isn't free.
Yeah, it's free in the lib
erty sense of the word free,
as in I can say whatever I
want without fear of gov
ernment reprisal. But it's
not free in the monetary
sense. Each year the gov
ernment spends millions of
dollars, mostly in court and
public safety costs, to pro

tect the citizenry's right to liberty of speech
And each month, you spend $12 to he able
to say whatever you want to others over the
Internet. Perhaps you are one of the suckers
who pays $14 a month to be able to say what
ever you want to others over a landline tele
phone. And maybe you're one of the really big
chumps who shells out $28 a month so that
other people can pollute your ears with their
thoughts and opinions through cable televi
sion.
Fora long, long time, 1 was a victim of the
ITSS triple play. Yes, my ITSS bill was a stag
gering $54 a month. Try not paying that fora
quarter and see how it mounts up.
But those days, for better and worse, are
over.
As those colorful posters on the bathroom
doors tell us. we'll be paying a single quarterly
bill to be able to exercise our rights to freedom
of speech across campus and throughout the
world. While rolling Internet usage into the
housing bill is a positive step that should have
been taken long ago. my feelings about the
landline telephone are far more mixed.
These days, having a computer at school is
an absolute necessity. Most classes have course
Websites, e-mail is by far the preferred mode of
personal and mass communication on campus,
and using the Internet to research (or place
sports bets as I have recently begun to do) is a
vital part of everyday life.
The original thinking behind having the
Internet as an a la carte item was — in that
good ole' Republican school of thought
(sources tell me we can thank Condi for this)
— that people should not pay fora service

that they do not use. Originally this applied
to mostly low-income students who could not
afford a computer to bring to school.
But Stanford should be in the business of en
couraging computer and Internet use among
low-income students as computers become
more and more integral to school, future em
ployment and life (digital divide, anybody?).
Having Internet access covered by financial
aid, as it will now be, is one step in the right di
rection. Some schools go so far as to subsidize
the purchase of new computers for low income
students.
So while rolling Internet fees into the hous
ing bill is a step toward the future, forcing peo
ple to pay for landline service is a step back into
the past.
Stanford may claim that 50 percent of un
dergraduates have landlines, but I can honestly
tell you that not a single one of my friends has
one that I call. Period. I had to have one earlier
this year because I'm an RA, and it was the
biggest waste of money this side of missile de
fense.
They charged me a $33 set-up fee. Are you
kidding me? The phone line is there! They
told me that they had to "program the dial
tone." For 33 bucks? That's like five hours at
minimum wage! They could have saved them
selves the effort and me the money by making
"programming the dial tone" a CS 1068 pro
ject, no?
And the Door King argument is bogus, too.
As anybody who's ever rolled anyone out
knows, there is always a way to get into a cam
pus residence. Yeah, campus residences are
less secure because of this, but is Bobby Fresh
man actually going to not prop the door open
because his Door King works? Come on.
In conclusion, this is a bad deal simply be
cause dinosaur phones have been forced down
our throats right behind the fast Internet. And
it will probably be another ten years before
anybody with any power realizes this.
God bless utility monopolies.
