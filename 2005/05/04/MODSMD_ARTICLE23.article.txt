# Techie repairs the world
## Turning jets into free lunches

In my last column. 1 attempted to show
that the majority of our wars have not ben
efited the United States or the world. But if
1 had left it at that, I would he doing a dis
service to my readers, for I did what shrill
people have too often done; 1 will not raise
a hue and cry without offering a solution.
But I will start with a question. Why will we
spend 420 billion dollars, almost as much as
the entire rest of the world combined, on de
fense this year? This amount is nearly 20 per
cent of the U.S. government budget and 3.5
percent of GOP. It is also around six times
more than the next largest spender, China. Of
course, as a percentage of GDP, this is low.
During the height of the Cold War, we were
spending around 8 percent of the GDP on the
military, although this number had decreased
to roughly 5 percent in 1989 and 3 percent in
1999. This has been used to justify massive in
creases in our "defense" budget recently.
And yes, I put defense in quotes, because
we do not need our military for defense.
America, as a nation, would be impossible
to attack militarily. Not only is our populace
heavily armed (with more than 200 million
weapons in the country right now), but we
also have enough nuclear weapons to dev
astate any attacking nation. Our nation can
be terrorized, surely, but we've already

shown that our military
can do little to stop ter
rorist attacks. Nor can
our military attack any
nation that even ap
proaches our own
strength. They are all nu
clear-capable as well.
The truth is that our mili
tary is only useful as a
means through which to

impose our will on weaker countries.
And our legislators know this, which is
why they consistently use it in this manner. So
the solution, unless we want to be continual
ly involved in foreign wars that bear little rel
evance to our lives, is to drastically cut our
military. Reduce our active forces by more
than half, to less than three-fourths of a mil
lion people (which will still be the fifth largest
in the world). Maintain the Air Force, so we
can still bomb plausible targets. But reduce
the Army by the greatest amount, so the only
way to put American troops on the ground in
foreign countries will be to call up reserves
and the National Guard. Reduce spending on
development and purchase of new tanks and
fighter planes, such as the costly Joint Strike
Fighter. Defense spending must be more
than halved; it must be gutted to the point

that the United States will have to think long
and hard before involving itself in a regional
conflict.
There are two major risks to this strate
gy. The first is that North Korea will invade
South Korea. The second is that China will
invade Taiwan. These risks could he re
duced by giving Taiwan and South Korea
nuclear weapons (as we've already done for
Israel).
This will entail a major shift in direction
for U.S. foreign policy. We will no longer be
the world's sole superpower. We will be
come one power amongst many, and we will
have to rely on international institutions,
coalitions and our economic power to get
things done.
The benefits will also be obvious. A
large sum of money can be returned to
the taxpayers (more likely, spent by the
government on something else). America
will become less aggressive, and hence,
less hated throughout the world. And we
will be able to defuse the global arms race
between ourselves and the rest of the
world.
