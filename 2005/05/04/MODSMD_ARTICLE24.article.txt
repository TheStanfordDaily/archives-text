Edit board is in no position to
direct the pope
I must have missed the white smoke com
ing out of Hoover Tower announcing the
ascension of The Daily's editorial board to
moral leaders of the world. Otherwise, it
would be hard to explain the condescend
ing, and well, pontifical tone of the April
27 editorial on the inauguration of Bene
dict XVI as pope ("New pope can change
world").
With arrogance bordering on contempt.
The Daily marches on to direct the Pope on
what he must say and do in the upcoming years.
Perhaps 1 can offer some counterbalance to
their enlightened directives.

The "common sense" measure advocat
ed by The Daily of immediately removing
from service priests accused of molestation
is actually nonsense. Everyone likes the idea
of separation of church and state, but few re
alize that it works both ways. The state has
no standing to tell the church how to disci
pline its priests. This is a church that believes
that Jesus came to save the criminals and the
sinners, not the saints. The day the church
turns its back on accused priests and stops
having faith in their redemption and capaci
ty to heal, that would be the saddest day in
the history of the church. Zero tolerance is
good for the state, but it is anathema for the
Catholic Church.
The editorial goes on to admonish the

Pope to "be more understanding of the par
ticular conditions of life in the developing
world." Let me get this straight. The
Catholic Church cares directly for fully one
third of all the AIDS patients in the world
as well as for millions of poor people all
across the globe. Yet, surely The Daily's
editorial board members have lots of
knowledge to offer to the church regarding
the poor and the sick, knowledge no doubt
carefully crafted while sipping frapuccinos
at the local Starbucks.
The Church brings a message of hope,
faith and salvation to the people in the de
veloping world. The message from The
Daily to these people, however, is much
more practical and direct: "Please wear con

doms and stop reproducing like rabbits and
having diseases; it really makes us quiver
just thinking about it."

Quiz Bowl deserves more coverage
I read with amusement Chuck Armstrong's
letter stating that the women's rugby team
had not gotten much attention — just an arti
cle yesterday and a large photo spread today
— for winning a national championship
("Why were owls on the front page?" May 3).
While 1 agree that this is a great achievement,
the reason I was amused is that over the past
month the Stanford Quiz Bowl team won

fourth place at the NAQT Intercollegiate
Championship Tournament and third place
at the College Bowl National Championship
Tournament. These are the best finishes the
team has achieved in at least the past five
years and represent a major triumph in a
highly competitive field. Yet not only did The
Daily not cover them, but The Daily has not
run a single article on the team since 2002. 1
realize that it is important to give coverage to
athletics, but sports of the mind deserve some
ink as well, especially when the teams repre
sent Stanford so ably.
