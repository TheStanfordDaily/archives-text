# Low-fat diet promoted in new study
## 
### ANNE RITCHIE 
A low-fat diet rich in plants, soy
and whole grains is twice as effec
tive in reducing cholesterol levels
as an ordinary low-fat diet, accord
ing to a study released yesterday by
the Stanford University School of
Medicine.
The study, which sought to test
the new American Heart Associa
tion Dietary Guidelines of 2(XX),
suggests that a strong effort to con
sume more vegetables, beans and
grains is more effective than simply
focusing on which foods to avoid.
Both are comprised of 30 per
cent total fat, 10 percent saturated
fat and less than 300 mg of saturat
ed fat per day. In the past, a diet fol
lowing these guidelines has been
considered sufficient to significant
ly reduce cholesterol.
The 120 participants maintained
the same exercise habits and did
not gain or lose weight during the
study. After a month, the group on
the plant-based diet observed a 10
percent reduction in cholesterol,
compared to the 5 percent choles
terol reduction by the conventional
diet group.
The study's lead author Christo
pher Gardner, an assistant profes
sor of medicine, said that while a
plant-based diet can be vegetarian.

people who are worried about the
cholesterol levels do not have to
eliminate all meat from their diets.
"A plant-based diet can be an
Asian stir-fry with mung beans,
tofu, water chestnuts, rice and
strips of lean beef," he said. "It can
be a Mediterranean salad with
beans and greens and an olive oil
dressing that has strips of grilled
chicken. The main idea is to simply
take the emphasis off having the
meat as the centerpiece on the plate
with side-dishes of vegetables and
mashed potatoes."
Previously, physicians had rec
ommended that patients try to cut
down on fat intake. In 2(XX), the
American Heart Association

changed the emphasis of
their recom-

menda
tio n s -

by placing "choosing more vegeta
bles and fruits and whole grains" on
the top of their list, above limiting
saturated fats and cholesterol.
"This is a very important para
digm shift," Gardner said.
The study's implications could
encourage people to change their
diets, rather than take prescription
drugs, to control cholesterol Gard
ner said, adding that this is a long
term goal.

"But it takes more than one
study," he said. "And, it takes more
than people simply knowing about
it. Eating behaviors can be very

hard to change, especially
when pre-

vailing social norms get in the way,
and especially when the food indus
try has created the toxic food envi
ronment we now live in with high
calorie, low nutrient density foods
available to us everywhere."
Freshman Natasha Pereira-Ka
math has a history of high choles
terol in her family, but said she
doesn't think the findings will influ
ence her eating habits noticeably.
"I already eat pretty healthful
ly," she said. "I already eat a lot of
vegetables, so maybe I'll eat more
grains now."
