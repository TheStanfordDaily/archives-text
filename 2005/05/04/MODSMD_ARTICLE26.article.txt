# Researchers track bluefin tuna numbers

### DAVID KUO 
The Atlantic bluefin tuna is not your av
erage fish. It can grow up to 12 feet long and
can weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Not to men
tion its the market price —just one bluefin
tuna can carry a price tag of up to $1(X),(XX)
in Japanese fish markets. With an average
cost of $45 per pound, it is no surprise that
the bluefin tuna is one of the most hunted
fish in the ocean.
Enter Marine Sciences Prof. Barbara
Block of Stanford's Hopkins Marine Sta
tion who began researching bluefin tuna
more than a decade ago. Over the past
decade, she and her colleagues have elec
tronically tagged almost 800 individual
bluefin tuna. Using satellite technology, the
researchers are able to track the migrations
of the tuna over the course of the study.
"Our research is aimed at finding the lo
cations these animals occur — their hot
spots, if you will, for feeding and breeding
that will allow us then to build better inter
national and US protection for the species."
Block said.
Block and researchers from Monterey
Bay Aquarium and Dalhousie University
published their findings in Nature magazine
last week.
Conducting the research, however, was
no simple fishing trip.
"Our research involves tracking giant
tuna across the ocean," Block said. "It's
hard to catch big tuna, let alone do surgery
on the deck of a tossing boat to put in elec
tronic tags."
The electronic tags allowed the re
searchers to track diving behavior, location
and body temperature, the most in-depth

tracking to date of the once-mysterious
species.
"The tags allow us to follow the fish in
the ocean for the first time — to see their
world — while remaining completely sub
merged," Block said. "The tags are small
computers that ride with an external sen
sor."
The researchers concluded that there
were two distinct breeding populations: the
Western population that breeds in the Gulf
of Mexico and the Eastern population that
breeds in the Mediterranean Sea.
The most interesting discovery, howev
er, is the fact that these two populations
mix, contrary to the previously held opin
ions. Because the Eastern and Western
populations have different fishing quotas,
migrating tuna had been caught and acci
dentally counted in the wrong batch. Ac
cording to Randy Kochevar, a marine biol
ogist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
there are 10 times as many Eastern tuna as
a result of current commercial fishing prac
tices.
The authors suggest a policy that would
further protect the Western Population by
having stricter quotas regarding the capture
of the animals and revised geographic divi
sions which would define the distinct tuna
populations.
Although such policy would probably
face opposition from the commercial fish
ing lobby, Kochevar is hopeful that conser
vation efforts do not need to be at odds with
business.
"Using good science for sound policy
will allow for sustainable economics, and
without good science, business becomes
boom or bust." Kochevar added.
