## Right in the Babymaker Clover's perfect game would make Emanski proud

1 cannot stress enough the significance of
what you are about to read. Knowing that
my readers can tolerate, at most, one or
two pieces per quarter about my experiences
with intramural sports, it took a lot to drive
me to write a column prematurely about IM
sottball — a topic I was saving fora postsea
son retrospective. Those who know me are
well aware that I could fill volumes with in
humation nobody cares to know about intra
mural Softball. But last Saturday, 1 was con
fronted with an athletic accomplishment so
ludicrous that it made the 2001 Mariners look
like a Little League team, and I felt com-

pciled to share.
Preston Clover is a highly
evolved human being. You
probably know him as a 275-
pound offensive guard for
the Cardinal football team
— or, for those of you who
don't follow sports, the large
blonde unshaven man in the
black "CTU" T-shirt who
you may have seen driving a
golf cart from Mirrielees to

Durand late at night. But I know him as far
more — a skilled grillmaster, an expert out
doorsman and a man who operates a power
handsaw and full set of Black & Decker sock
et wrenches with the dexterity with which
most people handle their own fingers. All
things considered, Preston is a formidable
ally. But his star was elevated into another
universe entirely last Saturday, when he
pitched a perfect game in IM soft hall.
For the unenlightened, some background
information: IM softball is not played with
the 12-inch-circumlerence, hard ball that you
see on ESPN2 at four in the morning. The
standard IM softball is 16 inches around and
has a core of cotton and sawdust surrounded
by a cloth cover. This makes hitting an exer
cise of strength as well as skill, and never fails
to fluster people who have grown up on
"real" softball.
Additionally, there tend to be three
breeds of IM softball teams. The first exam
ple is the freshman dorm team, its lineup
swelled by RA-dictated compulsory atten
dance, and, as a result, comprised largely of
barefoot students with the athletic coordina
tion of a dog on Rollerblades. The second is
the fraternity team, fueled to lopsided victo
ry by on-field forties of Mickey's and Steel
Reserve.
The third genre, however, is a special
group: the grad student team. Grad students
are the only people I know who take IM soft
ball as seriously as I do, but even I don't wear
baseball pants or batting gloves to the field,
and I leave my flip-down sunglasses at home
in a rare concession to appearances. If not an
overabundance of talent, you can generally
count on a grad student team arriving with a
healthy understanding of the rules and one or
two good players. Preston took the mound
Saturday against a group fitting this descrip
tion.
Now would be a good time for me to reit
erate how difficult it is to prevent hitters
from reaching base in IM softball. First of all,
the bases, which the rules dictate to be set at
60 feet from one another, are typically
around 50 feet unless steps are taken to in
tervene. Virtually any ball hit on the ground
is a potential infield hit. Secondly, intramural
umpires are generally about as perceptive
and mobile as Ray Charles in a 12-century
suit of armor, so throwing a runner out by
less than two steps runs the risk of giving up
a base hit. So when we — and when I say
"we," I mean Tom Emanski's Defensive
Drill All-Stars — entered the top of the fifth
