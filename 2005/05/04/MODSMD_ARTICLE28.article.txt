# Baseball blasts Nevada
## Card record second straight shutout, 13-0 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
The last time the Stanford base
hall team visited Nevada, in 2002, the
Cardinal lost an offensive shootout,
13-12. Yesterday afternoon the Stan
ford bats once again came alive at the
offense-friendly Peccole Park â€” lo
cated more than 3,(XX) feet above sea
level. But this time, even the eleva
tion couldn't help Nevada get any
thing going as four Stanford pitchers
combined to shutout the Wolf Pack
(20-21) and help No. 24 Stanford (26-
15) to a 13-0 win.
The two teams' respective offen
sive performances couldn't have
contrasted more. Nevada was held to
four hits and had only six total
baserunners. The Cardinal tallied 13
runs on 11 hits and seven walks.
The Wolf Pack was within striking
distance through most of the game,
but five Cardinal runs in the seventh
and four runs in the ninth put the
game well out of reach.
The five-run rally began with a
leadoff walk by sophomore pinch
hitter Ryan Seawell, before junior
left fielder Chris Lewis singled
through the left side. Two batters
later, sophomore third baseman
Adam Sorgi hit a sacrifice fly scoring
the first run of the inning.
The sacrifice fly drove in Sorgi's
fourth run of the game, marking a
new career high. His previous career
high of three RBI came Monday af
ternoon in an 8-0 win over UC-
Davis. He also extended his career
high hitting streak to eight games.
The rally continued as the next
two Cardinal batters reached base
before junior catcher John Hester
smacked a three-run homer over the
leftfield fence. The home run, Hes
ter's fourth of the season, moved him
into third on the team in the catego
ry.
The four runs the Cardinal added
in the ninth featured another home
run, as junior shortstop Chris Mi
naker clubbed a two-out dinger to
left with two men on. Seven of the
nine Cardinal starters scored at least
one run.
While the offensive outing was
certainly impressive, the Cardinal
