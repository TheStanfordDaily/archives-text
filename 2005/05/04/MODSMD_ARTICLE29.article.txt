### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's track and field
team stole the show this past weekend at
the Penn Relays in Philadelphia. The
women's relay teams won three of the six
events they competed in, but among a flur
ry of Stanford triumphs, freshman Erica
McLain's victory in the triple jump stood
out from the rest.

Not only did McLain set a new season
best for herself, she also broke the school
record of 43'4.5" that has stood since 1992.
McLain leaped 43'9.25" to victory, estab
lishing herself as the school record holder in
both the indoor and outdoor triple jump.
And all this was done on a weak ankle.
' The main thing was I had a sprained
ankle and I had to go in there and try to get
healthy," McLain said.
Under the watchful eye of head

women's coach and jump coach Edrick Flo
real. who insisted McLain step off the field
if she began to limp. McLain beat out 12
other top women's triple jumpers to win the
championship heat.
"I had been rehabbing it since we got
there Wednesday," McLain said. "So I put
a brace on it, taped it up and went out there
â€” 1 felt pretty good."
Competing amongst experienced ath
letes is nothing new for McLain. who has

been exposed to the best of her sport since
she was 16.
"The main adjustment has been trying
to recoup from injuries I had in high school
that I am still trying to deal with," McLain
said. "My ultimate goal is to hit the qualify
ing standards for Worlds, which is just
below 47 feet, and try to make the world
team that goes to Helsinki, Finland."
