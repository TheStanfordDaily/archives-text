# Track teams enjoy record-setting weekend
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's track and field
team stole the show this past weekend at
the Penn Relays in Philadelphia. The
women's relay teams won three of the six
events they competed in, but among a flur
ry of Stanford triumphs, freshman Erica
McLain's victory in the triple jump stood
out from the rest.

Not only did McLain set a new season
best for herself, she also broke the school
record of 43'4.5" that has stood since 1992.
McLain leaped 43'9.25" to victory, estab
lishing herself as the school record holder in
both the indoor and outdoor triple jump.
And all this was done on a weak ankle.
' The main thing was I had a sprained
ankle and I had to go in there and try to get
healthy," McLain said.
Under the watchful eye of head

women's coach and jump coach Edrick Flo
real. who insisted McLain step off the field
if she began to limp. McLain beat out 12
other top women's triple jumpers to win the
championship heat.
"I had been rehabbing it since we got
there Wednesday," McLain said. "So I put
a brace on it, taped it up and went out there
— 1 felt pretty good."
Competing amongst experienced ath
letes is nothing new for McLain. who has

been exposed to the best of her sport since
she was 16.
"The main adjustment has been trying
to recoup from injuries I had in high school
that I am still trying to deal with," McLain
said. "My ultimate goal is to hit the qualify
ing standards for Worlds, which is just
below 47 feet, and try to make the world
team that goes to Helsinki, Finland."

McLain is a contender for the NCAA triple jump
championship title. At the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships this past March, she finished second in the
triple jump with a leap of 44'8.25".
Meanwhile, the Stanford 4 x 1,500-meter relay
raced to victory, four seconds ahead of second-place
Villanova. Sophomores Katy and Amanda Trotter and

Arianna Lambie, and senior Sara Bei finished the relay
m 17:38.16.
"That was the second year in a row that the team
won that relay," Floreal said. "So it was very exciting."
Thirty-five teams raced for the women's distance
medley relay title, with the Cardinal's stacked squad
earning a fifth-place finish. Freshman Laura Mottaz,

Katy Trotter and seniors Christine Moschella and Bei
finished the race in 11:24.17. Duke won in 11:10.18.
The women's sprint medley relay finished second
while the 4 x 800-meter relay set a new school record
with a first-place finish ahead of North Carolina. Mot
taz, Lambie, sophomore Ashley Freeman and junior
Chinny Offor finished in 8:32.02.
The men had a challenging weekend at the Penn Re
lays. where they did not race as well as expected.
"Everything was going well for the relays," head
men's coach Robert Weir said. "Then something would
go wrong in the fourth leg. It is really just a little fine
tuning here and there. When you go to a meet like that
you have high expectations for the team and for the ath
letes — it is not that they did badly, it is just that we had
hoped for more."
The men finished sixth in the 4 x mile relay, the
crown jewel of relays in outdoor track and field. Red
shirt freshmen Russell Brown and Lauren Jespersen,
sophomore Joaquin Chapa and senior Evan Fox fin
ished with a combined time of 16:34.43.
The Cardinal Invite, held at the Cobb Track and
Angell Field on Sunday evening, told a different story
for men's track and field.
Senior lan Dobson became the fastest male 10,000-
meter runner in the nation this year as he raced to a
fifth-place finish behind a group of foreign competitors.
He ran the 25-lap race in 27:59.72.
Senior Don Sage won the 1,500-meter run in the
final lap. finishing in 3:41.62, just ahead of Ismail

Ahmed of Nike Oregon, who clocked in at 3:41.97. It
was a season-best for Sage, who holds two NCAA
championship titles in the 1,500-meters.
"Don is now looking like an NCAA champion,"
Weir said. "He looks like his old self. Just a couple of
weeks ago he was on his way back to fitness."
Senior sprinter Nick Sebes won the 4(X)-meter dash
in 47.45, just ahead of senior Curtis Goehring.
"It is going to be so difficult to replace him," Weir
said. "He and Curtis have done a phenomenal job for
the sprint program. Despite having only two 4(X)-meter
sprinters, week in and week out they have found a way
to produce competitive results for the team."
Sophomore Keith Avila and junior Bryan Kelley
both earned career-best throws in the javelin, while ju
nior Michael Robertson won the discus with a mark of
198'.
Freshman pole-vaulter Graeme Hoste vaulted a
lifetime-best mark of 16'6.25", finishing second and
qualifying for Regionals.
"The women had a mixed bag of performances at
the Cardinal Invite," Floreal said.
Senior Undine Becker earned two regional marks,
with back-to-back wins in the long jump at 197", and
400-meter hurdles in 59.67 seconds.
Becker holds the third-best mark in the Pacific-10
Conference in the 400-meter hurdles.
Sophomore Jakki Bailey won the 100-meter dash in
11.89 seconds, which was a huge improvement for her,
Florealsaid.

record of 43'4.5" that has stood since 1992.
McLain leaped 43'9.25" to victory, estab
lishing herself as the school record holder in
both the indoor and outdoor triple jump.
And all this was done on a weak ankle.
' The main thing was I had a sprained
ankle and I had to go in there and try to get
healthy," McLain said.
Under the watchful eye of head

women's coach and jump coach Edrick Flo
real. who insisted McLain step off the field
if she began to limp. McLain beat out 12
other top women's triple jumpers to win the
championship heat.
"I had been rehabbing it since we got
there Wednesday," McLain said. "So I put
a brace on it, taped it up and went out there
— 1 felt pretty good."
Competing amongst experienced ath
letes is nothing new for McLain. who has

been exposed to the best of her sport since
she was 16.
"The main adjustment has been trying
to recoup from injuries I had in high school
that I am still trying to deal with," McLain
said. "My ultimate goal is to hit the qualify
ing standards for Worlds, which is just
below 47 feet, and try to make the world
team that goes to Helsinki, Finland."
Dobson sets 10,000-meter mark

McLain is a contender for the NCAA triple jump
championship title. At the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships this past March, she finished second in the
triple jump with a leap of 44'8.25".
Meanwhile, the Stanford 4 x 1,500-meter relay
raced to victory, four seconds ahead of second-place
Villanova. Sophomores Katy and Amanda Trotter and

Arianna Lambie, and senior Sara Bei finished the relay
m 17:38.16.
"That was the second year in a row that the team
won that relay," Floreal said. "So it was very exciting."
Thirty-five teams raced for the women's distance
medley relay title, with the Cardinal's stacked squad
earning a fifth-place finish. Freshman Laura Mottaz,

Katy Trotter and seniors Christine Moschella and Bei
finished the race in 11:24.17. Duke won in 11:10.18.
The women's sprint medley relay finished second
while the 4 x 800-meter relay set a new school record
with a first-place finish ahead of North Carolina. Mot
taz, Lambie, sophomore Ashley Freeman and junior
Chinny Offor finished in 8:32.02.
The men had a challenging weekend at the Penn Re
lays. where they did not race as well as expected.
"Everything was going well for the relays," head
men's coach Robert Weir said. "Then something would
go wrong in the fourth leg. It is really just a little fine
tuning here and there. When you go to a meet like that
you have high expectations for the team and for the ath
letes — it is not that they did badly, it is just that we had
hoped for more."
The men finished sixth in the 4 x mile relay, the
crown jewel of relays in outdoor track and field. Red
shirt freshmen Russell Brown and Lauren Jespersen,
sophomore Joaquin Chapa and senior Evan Fox fin
ished with a combined time of 16:34.43.
The Cardinal Invite, held at the Cobb Track and
Angell Field on Sunday evening, told a different story
for men's track and field.
Senior lan Dobson became the fastest male 10,000-
meter runner in the nation this year as he raced to a
fifth-place finish behind a group of foreign competitors.
He ran the 25-lap race in 27:59.72.
Senior Don Sage won the 1,500-meter run in the
final lap. finishing in 3:41.62, just ahead of Ismail

Ahmed of Nike Oregon, who clocked in at 3:41.97. It
was a season-best for Sage, who holds two NCAA
championship titles in the 1,500-meters.
"Don is now looking like an NCAA champion,"
Weir said. "He looks like his old self. Just a couple of
weeks ago he was on his way back to fitness."
Senior sprinter Nick Sebes won the 4(X)-meter dash
in 47.45, just ahead of senior Curtis Goehring.
"It is going to be so difficult to replace him," Weir
said. "He and Curtis have done a phenomenal job for
the sprint program. Despite having only two 4(X)-meter
sprinters, week in and week out they have found a way
to produce competitive results for the team."
Sophomore Keith Avila and junior Bryan Kelley
both earned career-best throws in the javelin, while ju
nior Michael Robertson won the discus with a mark of
198'.
Freshman pole-vaulter Graeme Hoste vaulted a
lifetime-best mark of 16'6.25", finishing second and
qualifying for Regionals.
"The women had a mixed bag of performances at
the Cardinal Invite," Floreal said.
Senior Undine Becker earned two regional marks,
with back-to-back wins in the long jump at 197", and
400-meter hurdles in 59.67 seconds.
Becker holds the third-best mark in the Pacific-10
Conference in the 400-meter hurdles.
Sophomore Jakki Bailey won the 100-meter dash in
11.89 seconds, which was a huge improvement for her,
Florealsaid.
