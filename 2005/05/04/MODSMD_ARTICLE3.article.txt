Associate Medical Prof. Marilyn Winkleby
and History Prof. Albert Camarillo are the re
cent recipients of the 2005 Stanford Universi
ty Miriam Aaron Roland Volunteer Service
prize, which recognizes faculty members who
encourage students to get involved with public
service. Students and colleagues said that
there are few people as deserving as Winkleby
and Camarillo. who will split the $5,000 prize.
"1 don't know of another member of the
faculty who is as dedicated to community ser

vice as Professor Camarillo," said History
Prof. Gordon Chang. "Community service to
him, I believe, is something that contributes
to society but also to the individual."
Camarillo, the founding director of the
Center for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, has initiated a number of on-cam
pus programs to promote Stanford students'
involvement in volunteer service.
"I remember I taught the first intensive
service-learning course in 1991, and now, in
any given year, the University offers 40 to 60
courses with significant internships," Camar
illo said.
His "Poverty and Homelessness in Amer
ica" class, for instance, gives students the op
portunity to leave the classroom and the
Stanford bubble behind.
"His class is set up to introduce Stanford
students to the issues of homelessness
through a hands-on experience, while provid-

ing homeless shelters with much
needed reliable interns and volun
teers for six months out of the
year," said senior Regina Celestin,
a student in the class.
In 2002, Camarillo helped a
group of his students find summer
internships at nonprofit agencies in
Compton, a low-income area in
South Central Los Angeles. The
following year they enrolled in his
"Race and Ethnicity in the Metrop
olis" class and produced oral histo
ry projects based on interviews
with Compton residents.
"Prof. Camarillo has promoted
community service through his
consistent support of the Haas
Center, his own service-learning
courses, his volunteer work and re
cently in his serving as the resident
fellow in Lantana, which has com
munity service as its dorm focus,"
Chang said.
Winkleby has also worked ex
tensively to promote volunteer ser
vice within the Stanford communi
ty-
"Marilyn has a strong commit
ment to people, especially under
privileged people," said Wes Alles,
director of the Stanford Health Im
provement Program and the Stan
ford Health Promotion Resource
Center. "She does things for people
throughout the year, many of

which no one knows about. She
doesn't care about the recognition;
she just does it because that's who
Marilyn is."
Winkleby founded the Stanford
Medical Youth Science Program,
or SMYSP, 18 years ago to diversi
fy the healthcare field. Every year,
24 high school students from low
income areas are accepted into the
summer residential program to
work closely with 10 undergradu
ate students, most majoring in
human biology, who come from
similar backgrounds.
"Dr. Winkleby's motivation and
the goal of the program as a whole
is to positively impact these stu
dents' lives to the extent that once
leaving the program they are
equipped with an entirely new level
of confidence and academic re
sources," said senior Michel
Kwarteng, a counselor for SMYSP.
"She genuinely cares about each
applicant to this program, whether
or not they are admitted. She has
used her resources to make a pro
found difference in the lives of
many students through SMYSP."
Sophomore Dontae Rayford, a
fellow counselor, agreed.
"She has committed her entire
being to helping the underprivi
leged children that partake in this
program," he said. "Working
alongside Dr.Winkleby has forced
me to reanalyze my life and ask
how I can do more to give back to
the children that come from under
privileged homes and communi
ties, just like me."
