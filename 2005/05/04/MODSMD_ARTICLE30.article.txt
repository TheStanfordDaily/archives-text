# Men and women begin preparation for Pac-10s
## Crew can't top No. 2 Cal 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 5 men's and the No. 9
women's crew teams, Saturday evening's
showdown with the No. 2 California teams
marked the culminating point of the regular
season schedule. Racing against one of the
top programs in the nation, both squads had
the opportunity to see where they stand
heading into the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships in two weeks.
The Stanford men entered the weekend
on a roll. In last week's competition, they
posted a clean sweep over No. 10 Oregon
State for the first time in more than a decade.
In preparation for the Bears, the Cardinal
put together a strong week of training and
developed a race strategy designed to break
the California boat early. Looking to gain
the psychological edge over the Bears with
an early lead, the Cardinal planned moves at
40 seconds and 1:40 into the race.
Unfortunately, neither one of the men's
boats was able to successfully execute that
plan. Within the first minute of its race, the
men's second varsity boat found itself be
hind.
"We focused all week on getting off the

line quick, knowing that our fitness would
carry us through the finish," junior Jeremy
Barton said. "But our start wasn't clean, and
we were only even with Cal for about the
first 150 meters."
The Bears built a three-seat lead and
never looked back. The Cardinal tried sev
eral times to pull their way back into the
race, but each time the Cal boat checked the
move.
Unable to make any headway, the Stan
ford men fell further and further behind as
the Bears continued to widen the gap. The
race concluded with the Cardinal crossing
the finish line nearly 10 seconds after the
Bears.
The first varsity boat lined up looking to
salvage a split decision for the men's squad
in the weekend competition. After a strong
start, the Cardinal passed the 500-meter
mark even with the Bears.
The race seemed to be developing as a
repeat of the two boats' first meeting this
season, in which the Cardinal pulled of an in
credible upset by a two-second margin.
But several technical mistakes during the
second 500-meters cost the Cardinal pre-
