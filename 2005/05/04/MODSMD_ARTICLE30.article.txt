# Men and women begin preparation for Pac-10s
## Crew can't top No. 2 Cal 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 5 men's and the No. 9
women's crew teams, Saturday evening's
showdown with the No. 2 California teams
marked the culminating point of the regular
season schedule. Racing against one of the
top programs in the nation, both squads had
the opportunity to see where they stand
heading into the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships in two weeks.
The Stanford men entered the weekend
on a roll. In last week's competition, they
posted a clean sweep over No. 10 Oregon
State for the first time in more than a decade.
In preparation for the Bears, the Cardinal
put together a strong week of training and
developed a race strategy designed to break
the California boat early. Looking to gain
the psychological edge over the Bears with
an early lead, the Cardinal planned moves at
40 seconds and 1:40 into the race.
Unfortunately, neither one of the men's
boats was able to successfully execute that
plan. Within the first minute of its race, the
men's second varsity boat found itself be
hind.
"We focused all week on getting off the

line quick, knowing that our fitness would
carry us through the finish," junior Jeremy
Barton said. "But our start wasn't clean, and
we were only even with Cal for about the
first 150 meters."
The Bears built a three-seat lead and
never looked back. The Cardinal tried sev
eral times to pull their way back into the
race, but each time the Cal boat checked the
move.
Unable to make any headway, the Stan
ford men fell further and further behind as
the Bears continued to widen the gap. The
race concluded with the Cardinal crossing
the finish line nearly 10 seconds after the
Bears.
The first varsity boat lined up looking to
salvage a split decision for the men's squad
in the weekend competition. After a strong
start, the Cardinal passed the 500-meter
mark even with the Bears.
The race seemed to be developing as a
repeat of the two boats' first meeting this
season, in which the Cardinal pulled of an in
credible upset by a two-second margin.
But several technical mistakes during the
second 500-meters cost the Cardinal pre-

Coming off a strong weekend against Oregon State, tfie Stanford men's crew teams lost to Cal in Saturday's Big Row
cious rhythm. The Bears took ad
vantage d 1 the situation and pulled
ahead as the two boats passed the
midway mark. The Cardinal
couldn't keep pace over the second
half of the race as their cross-Bay ri
vals walked away with the victory.
"[Our performance] against Cal
was extremely disappointing," Bar
ton said. "We've worked too hard
for too long to let them slip away like
they did this weekend. We know
that we have what it takes to win. but
we need to step it up and perform."
The Stanford women, mean
while, managed to put forth a much
more promising performance. Own
ing a combined 11-1 record in dual
races this season, the Cardinal
looked to strengthen their case fora
bid to NCAAs with a good effort
against the Bears.
The women's second varsity boat
jumped off the starting line and held
a split-second lead over the Califor
nia boat for the first quarter of the
two-kilometer race. The Bears ulti
mately fought back to earn the win,
but the Cardinal accomplished the
goals they had set for themselves
going into the race.
"We've spent a lot of time work
ing on specific parts of our race plan,
and we wanted to pull it all together
fora solid and complete race," ju
nior Christina Liebnersaid. "We did
a great job reaching our technical
goals and had our strongest opening
KMMI-meter split this season."

In the final race of the weekend,
the women's first varsity boat held
its own all the way down the course
against the California women. The
Cardinal built an early lead before
the Bears brought themselves even.
As the two boats passed beneath the
bridge just beyond the course's
halfway mark, the Bears maintained
a lead of less than two seconds. Over
the final 900 meters of the course,
the California boat was only able to
pick up three more seconds of sepa
ration from the Cardinal.
"We raced at a new level of inten
sity this weekend, but there are still
points in the body of the race where
we can squeeze out a few more sec
onds," junior Margit Zwemer said.
"But a few more seconds is all it
takes."
Even in defeat, the Stanford
women accomplished something no
other collegiate crew had accom
plished this season.
"We had a great start and were
up three seats in the beginning," se
nior captain Missy Fiesler said. "No
other crew has had seats on Cal at
any point in a race this
season. We had one of our best rows
this race, and we're just going to take
it one notch higher when Pac-lOs
rolls around."
How the Cardinal fare in Sacra
mento, Calif., two weeks from now
will depend on their preparation in
the meantime.
"It'll be exciting to see what we
can get done in the next two weeks
before we face Cal again," freshman
Claire Sadler said. "We've come a
long way this season and are confi
dent we can pull off a medal finish at
Pac-lOs."
