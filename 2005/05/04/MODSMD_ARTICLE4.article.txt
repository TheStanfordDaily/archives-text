Newly elected Undergraduate Senate Chair
Chris Nguyen, a sophomore, presided over the first
official meeting of the seventh ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate yesterday. The main topic of the meeting
was a presentation explaining next year's residential
dining meal plan options.
Executive Director of Stanford Dining Rafi

Taherian and Associate Director Eric Montell gave
a presentation entitled "Simplicity, Flexibility and
Value: Building a Meal Plan," describing the
changes that will be made to residential dining plans
for the next academic year.
Taherian said Stanford Dining's main objectives
are to offer more choices and flexibility and provide
meal plans that are simple and easy to understand.
They identified stakeholders in the changes as not
only the students, but their parents, the Health De

partment and the Stanford Board of Trustees.
Currently, Stanford Dining offers two types of
meal options for students: all-you-care-to-eat and a
la carte. The a la carte meal plan allows students to
use points to pay for individual items of food and is
currently offered at Manzanita Dining and the
Wilbur Marketplace.
A major problem with a la carte is that it is con-
fusing for many incoming freshmen,
dining officials said. Also, while many
students run out of points too quickly,
lighter eaters have too many points
left over at the end of each quarter.
In order to fix the problems in the a
la carte system, Stanford Dining will
be eliminating this meal plan system
and implementing all-you-care-to-eat
meal plans at all residential dining lo
cations.
The individual meal plans that will
be offered are 19 meals per week, 14
meals per week plus 420 Cardinal
Dollars — which can be spent at
many retail locations across campus,
including Subway and CoHo — and
10 meals per week plus 750 Cardinal
Dollars. Each of these plans will cost
$4,656 for three quarters.
Because the meal plans will be sim
plified, late night service will be avail
able every day of the week, the CoHo
will be open until 2 a.m. seven nights a
week and students will be able to eat
at any residential dining facility on
campus, Taherian said.
After the presentation, the Senate
elected Senator Danny Arbeiter, a
freshman, to be the Deputy Chair for
next year and confirmed freshman
Chris Elmore as the funding coordina
tor.
In addition, the Senate dealt with
several budget modifications and re
serve transfer bills. A total of $21,8%
was allocated to student groups, in
cluding Alpha Delta Kappa Phi, the
Stanford Israel Alliance, Stanford
Students for Life and Stanford An
thology for Youth.
