# E-mail worse for IQ than marijuana
## 
### LY CHHENG 
Spending hours in front of the
computer checking e-mail or flirting
over instant messenger may be detri
mental to your health — and not just
efnotionally.
Researchers at the University of
London's Institute of Psychiatry re
cently released a report showing that
workers bombarded with phone
calls, e-mails and text messages suf
fer a greater loss in 10 than marijua
na users.
Glenn Wilson, a psychiatrist at
King's College London University,
and his team of researchers moni
tored the 10 of 80 volunteers while
they performed problem-solving
tasks, first in a quiet environment
and then while being distracted with
e-mails and phone calls. The study
found that people balancing a steady
inflow of messages while attempting
to work experienced a 10-point de
crease in IQ — more than double
the four-point drop caused by smok
ing marijuana.
"This is a very real and wide
spread phenomenon," said Wilson
in an April 22 CNN article. "We
have found that this obsession with
looking at messages, if unchecked,
will damage a worker's performance
by reducing their mental sharpness."
A survey of 1,100 British citizens
conducted by TNS Research, a mar
ket information group, and commis
sioned by Hewlett Packard found
that distractions such as e-mail and
phone calls reduce productivity and
leave workers feeling tired and
lethargic.

David Smith of HP said \n/4he
same article, "The research suggests
that we are in danger of being caught
up in a 24-hour 'always-on' society."
Stanford students, accustomed to
multitasking and rapid communica
tion, do not appear to be deterred by
the results of the study. Many even
questioned its validity.
"I'm skeptical about the results,"
said senior Gregory Eastman. "Until
1 see the results replicated, it's not
going to have any effect on my e-mail
usage." Eastman, who said he does
not consider e-mail a distraction,
keeps his e-mail client open through
out the day and checks it whenever
new messages have arrived.
Sophomore Jack Stahl, who does
the same, said he believes most stu
dents probably would not care about
the study's results.
"They're much more concerned
about getting through the hell that is
schoolwork than the quality of their
work," said Stahl. "And if they need
AIM or e-mail to make writing a
paper more enjoyable, they'd proba
bly knowingly take the hit to their
work's quality, even if they trusted
the survey, which I doubt all that
many do."
Some Stanford faculty also called
the study's legitimacy into question.
"IQ never was meant to be a mea
sure that fluctuated hour-to-hour,"
said Robert Fisher, professor of neu
robiology at Stanford's School of
Medicine.
He did. however, agree that the
constant barrage of e-mails and
modern demands on attention dis
tract from deep thought.
