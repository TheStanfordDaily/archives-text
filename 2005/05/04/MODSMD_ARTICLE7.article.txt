# Students receive funds for start-ups
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
On the afternoon of April 9, sophomore Sam Altman
and his group won $2,000 in the BASES Business Plan
Competition. That night, he was on a red-eye flight to
Cambridge, Mass. fora final-round interview for the Sum
mer Founders Program, a venture-capital program that
funds students to create their own companies.
Altman's group, Viendo, and a team headed by fresh
man Aaron Swartz were recently selected from a pool of

227 as one of nine groups to make it into the program.
The Summer Founders Program is sponsored by the
venture firm Y Combinator. Currently in its first year, the
program was designed to target college students. Paul
Graham, one of the four partners in Y Combinator, said
that the novelty of the program rests in its timing.
"Nobody has really done this before," he said in an in
terview with The Daily. "The Summer Founders Program
plugs into the summer job slot. A lot of startups really take
off during the summer because of the extra time people
have to work on it. In fact, our own
startup really got started in the sum
mer."
Graham was one of the developers
of Viaweb, an online store software
that was acquired by Yahoo! in 1998
for about approximately $49 million.
"[Graham is] very well known,"
Swartz wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Pretty much everything he
does is featured on Slashdot, which is
sort of like the New York Times of the
computer world-everybody reads it."
Each of the nine groups will re
ceive $6,000 for each person who
spends the summer in Cambridge. In
addition, the program's partners will

offer advice at weekly dinners, help
write a business plan and may consid
er giving additional funding after the
summer is over. However, Graham
stressed that the partners plan on
being hands-off otherwise.
"There are no strings attached-stu
dents have no obligations," he said.
"You just hope that they want to do it
for real."
The finalists for the Summer
Founders Program were invited to
Cambridge for the final round of in
terviews on a $300 budget, which his
why Altman and Swartz flew solo
across the country to represent their
groups. The application for the pro
gram stressed that "the people are
what matter most to us," and Graham
said that both Stanford groups were
chosen as much on the basis of per
sonality as for their ideas.
"Sam and Aaron seemed to be ma

ture beyond their years," he said. "We
felt like they both seemed to under
stand what is entailed in starting a
company. Of course, they were both
talking about very good ideas. [Vien
do] is working on GPS in cell phones,
which is very hot stuff right now.
Aaron is working on an idea that re
lates to computer blogging, and he's
been involved with blogs fora very
long time, so he knows that world in
side and out. Really, though, the main
test was the people involved."
Viendo, which includes sopho
mores Alok Deshpande and Nick
Sivo as well as senior Peter Deming, is
in the process of developing a social
network for cell phones based on
global positioning system, or GPS,
programming. Altman said that the
funding the group received from the
BASES competition and will receive
from the Summer Founders Program

will help their venture tremendously.
"We're really excited about this
opportunity. The people putting to
gether the program are smart, experi
enced and give excellent advice," Alt
man said in an interview with The
Daily. "We'll be able to pay for soft
ware development as well as other
things, such as testing our phones with
carriers. We're really moving ahead,
and we hope to have a working proto
type by the end of summer."
Altman said that the group is de
ciding on which two people to send to
Cambridge, while the two other mem
bers will work on the venture from
other parts of the country; the Sum
mer Founders Program recommends
that each team consist of two to three
members.
Swartz, who at 14 co-authored the
RSSI.O specification, which is used by
Web sites such as Reuters.com,

Yahoo! News and thousands of oth
ers, declined to discuss the specifics of
his idea. His group, which includes
two friends from Europe, is currently
developing a prototype for the soft
ware. He said that they had not yet re
ceived significant funding from other
sources.
"No, this project wouldn't have
gotten off the ground without this
program," he said. "It really provided
us with the catalyst and the opportu
nity to make it happen."
Graham said that the partners of Y
Combinator were excited about the
program.
"The great thing is that we got to
choose from a large pool of appli
cants, so we got to be pretty selective,"
he said. "This is real venture funding.
Now the only question is whether
they'll get anything off the ground."
