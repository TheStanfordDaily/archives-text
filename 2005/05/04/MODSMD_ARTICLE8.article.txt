Attacking mountains and bridges on unicy
cles, defying gravity on rock and ice. kayaking
rapids in remote Zambia, trekking across Aus
tralia, skiing off cliffs, paragliding in the Andes.
These are just some of the escapades fea
tured in seven short films that the Bay Area Ad
venture Film Festival, or BAAFF. will screen
today from 7:30 to 1():(X) p.m., at the Spangen

berg Theater at Gunn High School. Net pro
ceeds from the BAAFF. the brainchild of elec
trical engineering doctoral student Laura Cook,
will be given to the Leukemia and Lymphoma
Society.
"I came up with the idea of doing a film
screening, and the idea ended up evolving into
something bigger than 1 had originally in.ag
ined." Cook said. "These extraordinary films are
appealing to all audiences; they will ama/e and
inspire everyone from the most seasoned moun
taineer to the armchair adventurer." After sign

in Training trains individuals for en
durance sports, and, in return, partic
ipants raise money for leukemia,
lymphoma and myeloma research.
"I enjoy the fact that while the
films show the amazing things peo
ple can do while pushing the enve
lope of what is considered possible,
they also give an idea of the lifestyle
the athletes lead and the amazing
cultures they interact with along the
way," Cook said.
Cook has become increasingly in
volved in sports after moving to Cal
ifornia.
"While I definitely am not an ex
treme athlete, I've always enjoyed
sports that are fast moving or chal
lenging," she said. "I wanted to do
some sort of endurance event, and a
friend suggested that I might like ad
venture racing. It is similar to a
triathlon but is more interesting to
me because it is raced as a team and
involves mountain biking, trail run
ning and kayaking. It can also incor
porate special challenges — like get
ting over a 12-foot wall without a
rope — along the way."
Cook's classmates said they are
impressed by her efforts.
"Team in Training donation re
quests have become very common,
and I think it's inspiring that Laura
didn't just ask for money and instead
put so much time and effort into cre
ating a unique fundraiser for donors
to enjoy," said Bob Schaffer, also an
electrical engineering doctoral stu
dent.
"I'm impressed by the creativity
of Laura's fundraising project," said
Paul Gurney, a third-year electrical
engineering doctoral student. "I
think people will really enjoy seeing
the extreme sports, remote cultures
and some of the world's greatest
wilderness brought to life on the big
screen."
The minimum ticket donation is
$15. Additional information can be
