In the laboratory and classroom:
• Enable the sleep settings on all computer monitors.
(Screen savers do not save energy but sleep settings do.)
• Turn off lights when leaving classrooms and labs where
safe and practical.
• Close the sash on fume hoods when they are not in
active use.
• Schedule energy-intensive equipment use in the morning
or after 6 pm to avoid peak demand hours when possible.
• Contact us for more information, energy-saving tips,
or to submit your ideas for saving energy on campus.
