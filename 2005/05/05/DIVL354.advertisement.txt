Arab Apartheid?
In 1947, Arab leaders rejected a UN plan to form an Arab state
alongside Israel and went to war. Encouraged by their leaders to leave
Israel, some 600,000 Palestinians became refugees in Arab nations.
For over 50 years, Arab nations have denied these Palestinians and
their descendants citizenship and basic civil rights, including the right
to own property, to get an education, or take out loans. In many cases,
Palestinian refugees in Arab countries live in squalid refugee camps
without basic services.
Why?
Hisham Youssef, spokesman for the 22-nation Arab League, has
acknowledged that the Palestinians perpetual status as refugees -
and "very bad [living] conditions" - are a deliberate Arab policy to
help the refugees "preserve their Palestinian identity. If every
Palestinian who sought refuge in a certain country was integrated
and accommodated into that country, there won't be any reason for
them to return to Palestine."
"The Arab States do not want to
solve the refugee problem. They
want to keep it as an open sore, as
an affront to the United Nations
and as a weapon against Israel.
Arab leaders don't give a damn
whether the refugees live or die."
— former director of UNRWA (UN Palestinian Relief Works
Agency), Ralph Garroway, in August 1958
