# Balancing school and spouse
## Undergrads tie knot, live in EV 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO 
Stanford students often complain about being too busy to
date. But some aren't too busy for marriage.
Seniors Eric and Kristen Frantz got married over spring break
after finishing their major requirements last quarter. They cur
rently reside in couples housing in Escondido Village.
"Kristen is still taking classes so that we can get on-campus
housing," Eric said. "She's taking 12 units to be a full-time stu
dent. I just audit cultural psychology with her."
Eric and Kristen both said that any stress they face now is
nothing compared to planning a wedding and that finally being
married is a "wonderful feeling."
Amanda, a married sophomore who also lives in Escondido
Village and asked that her last name be withheld, echoed the
Frantzes' sentiments.
"Being married has helped me grow as a person," she said. "1
have someone else to think about now, not just myself."
Even so, both Amanda and Eric Frantz said that being mar

ried places them in the obvious minority on campus.
"It's a little awkward because, especially at Stanford, you feel
a bit unique," Eric said. "There aren't too many married stu
dents, especially undergrads. But I think it's awesome."
Amanda, who has been married since she first arrived on cam
pus last year, said she also feels like somewhat of a novelty among
her classmates.
"1 had to make a really big effort freshman year because 1
didn't have a dorm." she said. "Stanford helped by assigning me
a dorm to be associated with, but I will never get to live in a dorm
as an undergrad or have a roommate."
When it comes to the social scene, Amanda said there is a no
ticeable divide between her and her peers.
"I'm not worried about dating or anything like that like other

Getting hitched on spring break

people are," she said. "I see people
worried about getting to the dining
hall on time, but I have a whole
household to run. The responsibility
level is different." Still, Amanda said
she still has a life outside of her mar
riage.
"I've tried to get involved as much
as I could in the undergrad communi
ty so that I would have the undergrad
experience," she said. "I'm in a soror
ity and I have a lot of friends."
Amanda said she decided to get
married when she did because "the
level of commitment between my
husband and me was there at the
time. We knew we wanted to gel mar
ried anyway. I just wanted to and it
felt right."
Despite the fact that her family
and friends didn't believe they would
make it as a married couple, Amanda
said she was not afraid of tying the
knot.
"I was committed enough to han
dle it," she said. "We have always
been conscious of making sure our re
lationship was good. We have been
happy ever since."
Like Amanda and her husband.
Eric and Kristen are also happily mar
ried. Part of their reason for holding
the wedding over spring break was so
that their friends from Stanford and
the Bay Area could attend.

"We were afraid that after we left
the Stanford area it would be harder
fora lot of them to make it and we
wouldn't be able to share our wed
ding with a lot of other people," Eric
said.
Their deep religious convictions
also contributed to their decision to
get married.
"Our faith is what motivates us
more than any other thing," Eric said.
"We both trust that Christ is going to
allow us to build a strong marriage
over time. We're not really afraid of
the various situations that might arise
or the problems we might face. We
trust Him to help us through those.
We love each other and we felt we
were ready for marriage."
Eric and Kristen said they made
sure to finish their academics before
getting married. "In that sense
we're also done," Epic said. "It wasn't
like we were going to be seriously im
pacting our studies or anything."
Amanda and Eric added that
being married will impact their plans
following graduation.
"We can no longer make arbitrary
decisions for ourselves alone," Eric
said. "We need to think of the other
person as well. One of the best ways
that 1 can show my love for Kristen is
to take her feelings and views into ac
count when I make decisions that im

pact both of us."
In the future, the Frantzes said
they plan on getting involved in activ
ities they can share. " This
summer we're attending a Biblical
training program in Colorado, possi
bly seminary, or possibly an intern
ship with some churches or some
community service organizations,"
Eric said.
Amanda said her marriage has al
ready influenced some important
choices.
"I won't ever go abroad because I
wouldn't know what to do with my
husband," she said.
These considerations will affect
her plans post-graduation as well.
"My husband wants to be a
teacher and I want to be a lawyer,"
she said. "He'll go wherever I go after
graduation to nuike sure our schools
are close enough to each other. I'd
rather travel with him than go do my
own thing."
Amanda added that she does not
feel at all limited by her husband.
"He's never asked me to give up
anything and I haven't asked him to
give up anything either," she said.
"I'm optimistic about my future. I
know that I want to be a lawyer and
that I want kids â€” but not until my
30s I always have someone with me
who is there to support me."
