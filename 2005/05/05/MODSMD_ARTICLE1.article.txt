# Balancing school and spouse
## Undergrads tie knot, live in EV

Stanford students often complain about being too busy to
date. But some aren't too busy for marriage.
Seniors Eric and Kristen Frantz got married over spring break
after finishing their major requirements last quarter. They cur
rently reside in couples housing in Escondido Village.
"Kristen is still taking classes so that we can get on-campus
housing," Eric said. "She's taking 12 units to be a full-time stu
dent. I just audit cultural psychology with her."
Eric and Kristen both said that any stress they face now is
nothing compared to planning a wedding and that finally being
married is a "wonderful feeling."
Amanda, a married sophomore who also lives in Escondido
Village and asked that her last name be withheld, echoed the
Frantzes' sentiments.
"Being married has helped me grow as a person," she said. "1
have someone else to think about now, not just myself."
Even so, both Amanda and Eric Frantz said that being mar

ried places them in the obvious minority on campus.
"It's a little awkward because, especially at Stanford, you feel
a bit unique," Eric said. "There aren't too many married stu
dents, especially undergrads. But I think it's awesome."
Amanda, who has been married since she first arrived on cam
pus last year, said she also feels like somewhat of a novelty among
her classmates.
"1 had to make a really big effort freshman year because 1
didn't have a dorm." she said. "Stanford helped by assigning me
a dorm to be associated with, but I will never get to live in a dorm
as an undergrad or have a roommate."
When it comes to the social scene, Amanda said there is a no
ticeable divide between her and her peers.
"I'm not worried about dating or anything like that like other
