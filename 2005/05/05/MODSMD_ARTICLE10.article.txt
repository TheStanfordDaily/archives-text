# Measure would renew parcel tax in PA
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Ballot Measure A, a proposed $493 annual
parcel tax that will he voted on hy residents of
Palo Alto in the June 7 election, would provide
$9.3 million annually for six years to the Palo
Alto Unified School District.
The Campaign for Excellence, a volunteer
organization dedicated to passing the measure,
held a rally on April 30 at the Lucie Stern Com
munity Center, that featured state Assembly
man Ira Ruskin and stale Senator Joe Simitian.
The funds provided by the measure would re
place those currently provided by a parcel tax
that more than 75 percent of local voters ap
proved in June 2001. T his tax provided $5.5 mil
lion each year to retain quality teachers, reduce
class sizes and support educational programs.
School administrators have said that this sta
ble source of funding helped them weather the
economic downturn in recent years, and propo
nents of Measure A said that if this tax. which is

slated to expire next year, is not replaced, cuts in
the number of teachers and core academic pro
grams will be unavoidable.
But this has not been the only attempt to re
place the previous tax. Last November, Palo
Alto residents voted on Measure 1, which in
creased the parcel tax to $521 per year. While
22,000 voted yes on the measure, it still fell 1 per
cent short of the needed 66.7 percent for ap
proval.
Megan Swezey Fogarty, co-chair of the Cam
paign for Excellence, said that opposition to
Measure A has been minimal.
"The opposition that has signed the ballot ar
gument is all folks who live outside the Palo Alto
Unified School District boundaries and sign
these arguments against similar ballot measures
in the region." she said. "There is also a small but
vocal number of Palo Alto residents â€” they
mostly don't have kids in school and are not in
volved in PAUSD schools."
For many years the school district received
funds from the state, but beginning in 2003, these

lunds were eliminated to balance the budget. As
a result, PAUSD lost a total of $4.4 million in an
nual state funds over the last three years, and un
like many other districts, it does not receive in
creased funding when additional students enroll.
Thus, since January 2003, the school district
has cut $6.5 million from its annual budget and
used $3.4 million from its limited reserves. Ac
cording to proponents of Measure A, four major
factors contributed to the need for budget cuts.
Over the past three years, FAUSI) has grown
by 594 students but there has been no increase in
revenue. Like any other employer, the school
district's costs for healthcare benefits, insurance,
utilities and many other items have also in
creased over time.
Property taxes provide 70 percent of
PAUSD's funding. And while the market value
of homes in Palo Alto has continued to rise in re
cent years, the growth in assessed value of these
residences has been capped by a state proposi
tion. This has limited the increase in property
taxes that would go to local schools.
