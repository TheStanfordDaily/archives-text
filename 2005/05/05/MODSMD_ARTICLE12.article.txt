# Stellar Suggestions
## Hairy can be scary 
### 
The issue of body hair had never
concerned me much until one mem
orable Saturday morning at the Fit
ness First gym in downtown Wash
ington, D.C. Feeling a little under
the weather after a night's very
happy hour at my summer job, 1 at
tempted to make up for my un
healthy behavior with a sacrifice to
the exercise gods. As 1 lethargically
pushed the pedals of the elliptical
trainer, I looked around the room,
trying to figure out if the other gym
visitors were guilty masochists like
me or healthy people committed to
regular exercise.
It was then that I caught a
glimpse of possibly one of the hairi
est creatures in the metropolitan
D.C. area. This guy was engulfed in
thick reddish bristle from the neck
down — it was everywhere but his
head. All of his body hair was glis
tening with sweat, which didn't drip
down to the floor as the laws of
gravity suggest, but accumulated in
each of the curls on his chest and

back. It was a
sight to remem
ber. As much as I
tried to remain
calm and non
judgmental, my
hung-over self
could not take
much more. For
the rest of my
workout, I delib-

erately stared in the other direction,
wondering how much the prissy
hair salon in Dupont would charge
to wax a beast like that.
Mind you, 1 am usually a lot
more tolerant of body hair for sev
eral reasons: first, I happen to be of
Armenian descent, which means
that most of the people in my fami
ly are very hairy and some even
have unibrows; second, I have lived
in Europe, which is notorious for
people sporting body hair au na
turel; and third, 1 consider myself a
liberal, feminist, even pseudo-hip
pie human being who appreciates
human bodies the way they are.
That guy in the gym, however,
made me seriously reconsider my
stances on this issue.
Even Hollywood, the land of
Brazilian waxes and unattainably
artificial beauty, cannot seem to
come to a conclusion on body hair.
A couple of years ago, Julia Roberts
exposed her fully grown armpit hair
in front of the camera during the
Notting Hill premiere, provoking a
lot of discussion among fashionistas
and feminists alike. Was it a politi
cal statement or was Julia just too
lazy to call an esthetician? Or was it
perhaps a requirement for her role
in a new movie? Or was she starting
a new fashion trend?
To the disappointment of the
body hair activists, Julia Roberts'
choice turned out to be not much of
a statement but rather a matter of
personal preference, her movie
characters remained feminine (and
presumably waxed), and the trend
has failed to captivate Tinseltown
and the rest of the country. Women
and metrosexual men everywhere
continue to endure the pain of wax
ing, while most guys (including my
friend at Fitness First) don't stress
about their body hair at all. And
both camps seem to be perfectly
content.
Getting rid of body hair could be
a costly enterprise — most waxing
salons in the Palo Alto area charge
no less than $50 fora leg wax and
$75 for (ouch!) a Brazilian bikini
wax. The procedure has to be re
peated approximately every month,
so you do the math. To a large ex
tent, cost is the reason why most
people I know at Stanford prefer
the old-fashioned shaving method,
which requires more maintenance
work, but is much cheaper than the
salon treatments.
The bottom line is that the "to
wax or not to wax" decision should
remain a matter of personal prefer
ence for men. women or Holly
wood celebrities. Just, you know,
use deodorant and keep things aes
thetically pleasing — especially if
you like working out on Saturday
mornings.
