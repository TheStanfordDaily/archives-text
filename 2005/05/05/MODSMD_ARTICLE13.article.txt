# Flip-flops fight foot fungus
## 
### LAUREN GONG DESK EDITOR 
Flip-flops didn't become popular footwear
just because they're fashionable, they can also
protect the health of your feet. Wearing them
in dorm bathrooms helps protect against ath
lete's foot and other unwanted fungal dis
eases transmitted in the shower or locker
rooms.
But some students have fallen into the habit
of jumping into the shower without such pro
tective wear — either out of laziness or out of
forgetfulness.
"Laziness plays prominently into my ex
posed feet." sophomore William Greene said.
"I am one of the few people who does not wear
flip flops in the shower; 1 have too little fear of
catching foot fungus from those who do pro
tect their own feet."
Others are more careful, even if they don't
quite understand the exact risks.
"1 wear flip-flops because people say there's
weird stuff in the shower," said junior Harsim
ran Singh. "Sometimes people don't wear
them and 1 haven't seen them catch anything,
so it could be an urban legend or something.
But who wants to take the risk?"
Others are not as cautious. Sophomore
William Greene says he has not worn flip flops
in the shower fora year and still maintains
healthy fungus-free feet.
According to WebMD.com, an online
medical resource, there are three types of foot
fungi that people are at risk of contracting
when using a public restroom. The most com
mon is "Tinea pedis," otherwise known as
athlete's foot, which is characterized by a rash
on the skin of the foot. Highly contagious,
athlete's foot commonly grows on the top
layer of human skin and thrives in warm,
moist areas such as the area between the toes.
It can be spread by simply touching the af
fected area.
The good news is athlete's foot is easily
treatable with an over the counter anti-fungal
cream, according to Robyn Tepper, a doctor at
the Vaden Health Center.
According to Tepper, there were seven
new reported cases of foot fungus in March of
this year and four in April. Because foot fun
gus can be treated by over the counter medi
cation, she said she suspects the number of

foot fungus cases on campus is probably high
er and she said she assumes students are self
medicating appropriately.
The other two types of foot ailments are not
as easily treatable. First, if the fungus spreads
to the toe nail, necessary treatment requires
oral medication.
"These oral medications are very expen
sive, can potentially cause side effects and are
not usually covered by insurance," said Tep
per. "The infections tend to recur, even with
prolonged oral treatment and are very frus
trating to everyone."

Another type of fungus students are at risk
of contracting is caused by the virus that caus
es plantar warts, according to WebMD.com.
These warts begin when the plantar virus en
ters the foot through microscopic scratches.
Once these warts develop they are very diffi
cult to remove and may even require surgical
removal from a podiatrist.
"In my experience as a basketball player [in
high school], I have suffered a couple of times
from plantar growths," said a senior who re
quested to remain anonymous. "It is easily
transmitted through surfaces such as the show

er, so I do all that 1 can to protect myself. As a
freshman in Wilbur 1 definitely wore shower
sandals in all situations."
Tepper said students should not be overly
concerned about foot fungus.
"There certainly is not an epidemic of Tinea
pedis on campus, considering the numbers of
students that share bathrooms," she said.
"Also, even if you are exposed to a fungus, it
does not mean that you will get an infection."
Still, she suggests that students take two sec
onds to slip into flip-flops before they grab
their shampoo and soap.
