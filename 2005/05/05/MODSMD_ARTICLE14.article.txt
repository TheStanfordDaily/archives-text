# Getting golden brown without sun or UV rays
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In preparation for summer, stu
dents can be spotted at the gym ham
mering down on the elliptical machines
and lifting those twenty-five-pound
weights in hopes of trimming down
and building those coveted lean arm
and leg muscles before shimmying into
their swimsuits.
And to accentuate their sculpted
bodies, many students spend hours to
get a bronzed summer look. Yet tan
ning, whether indoors at a tanning
salon or outdoors under the sun, can
put one at risk for dangerous skin can
cers. In order to avoid these risks,
some students are turning to Ultravi
olet or UV free tanning options such
as Mystic Tan.
For those who choose the most nat
ural and inexpensive way to get a tan,
sunbathing is a popular option. Fresh
man Mallory Bounds is one of Stan
ford's frequent sunbathers.
"I'm definitely envious of people
with nice tans," said Bounds. "Unfor
tunately for me, 1 was born really
white, so in the summertime I like to
get as much sun as possible."
Bounds said she enjoys spending
time outside whether or not she is sun
bathing.
"I enjoy the sun," she said. "Some
times I go out in pants and a shirt,
rather than a bathing suit, just for that
aspect. But the darker color is definite
ly the goal I have in mind."
For those who don't have the time to
soak up the sun for hours, a trip to the
nearest tanning salon for instant color is
an alternative option.
Yet indoor tanning — or outdoor
tanning, for that matter — has not
been deemed safe. Research by the
Skin Cancer Foundation has found
that 90 percent of these cancers are
caused by exposure to dangerous UV
rays emitted by the sun or the beams of
indoor tanning booths. In its position
statement on indoor tanning, the
American Academy of Dermatology

Association, or AADA. opposes in
door tanning and calls fora ban on the
sale and use of indoor tanning equip
ment for non-medical reasons.
According to the American Cancer
Society, more than one million Ameri
cans are diagnosed with skin cancer
each year. Melanoma, the most serious

form of skin cancer, is projected to af
fect 59.580 Americans in 2005. It is the
cause of three-quarters of all skin can
cer-related deaths and kills more
young women than any other cancer
does.
Robyn Tepper, chief physician at
Vaden Health Center, raises another

concern for students who don't consid
er skin cancer a serious enough deter
rent.
"For those who are young and think,
'Well, skin cancer only happens to older
people,' a more immediate concern is
aging," said Tepper. "Exposure to UV
light ages your skin. Too much time in
the sun has been shown to speed up the
occurrence of blotchiness, sagging skin
and wrinkles that are associated with
aging."
UV rays are naturally emitted by
the sun. The two most common
forms of UV rays are UVA and
UVB. UVA rays are of longer wave
length, so they penetrate deeper into
the skin than do UVB rays. As UVA
rays penetrate the skin, they start the
production of melanin, the pigment
that causes the skin to tan. This also
makes UVA rays responsible for
premature aging.
In contrast, UVB rays are of a rela
tively short wavelength. They touch
mainly the outer layers of the skin and
are responsible for sunburn. It is be
lieved that overexposure to UVB rays
are the main cause of skin cancer.
But according to Sharon Reyes,
tanning specialist and owner of Ingrid's
Suntanning in Palo Alto, indoor tan
ning is relatively safe.
"Indoor tanning is more con
trolled," said Reyes. "We know the
percentage of UV rays you're getting
and we never allow people to tan for
the maximum amount of time allotted
because the point is not to get sun
burned."
Reyes' salon, however, is one of the
many in the country that now offers
Mystic Tan. The makers of Mystic Tan
boast that their new tanning system
avoids the risks of traditional sun tan
ning by being completely UV-free. The
system is essentially a self-tanning mist
that is applied to the skin while the tan
ner stands in a booth.
The bronzing solution contains aloe
vera, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), and
either a bronzing agent or clear "myst."
A Food and Drug Administration or

FDA-approved tanning agent. DHA
acts as a color additive by reacting with
proteins in the skin to give a darker tone
lasts on average seven to 10 days, ac
cording to Reyes. It takes between two
and four hours for the tan to become
visible, but this wait can be expedited
by the use of the bronzing additive.
The popularity of Mystic Tan is ev
ident to Reyes, who sees between 25
and 30 customers a day in her tanning
salon. Her salon carries two Mystic
Tan booths and offers special packages
to those who opt for the U V-free spray.
An introductory session costs $25.
According to Tepper, Mystic Tan
seems to be the healthiest choice for
those who insist on tanning.
"It seems totally safe," Tepper said.
"It's comparable to the over-the
counter tanning lotions that you find in
drugstores. As long as it doesn't have ul
traviolet in it, it's not harmful."
Some Stanford students find Mystic
Tan a good option.
"I'm not so obsessed with sun
bathing that I need to go to a tanning
salon, but if I had a choice [between in
door tanning, sunbathing and Mystic
Tan] I'd choose Mystic Tan," sopho
more Annie Ta said.
"I would never do indoor tanning,"
added Bounds. "I've seen the pictures
and heard the horror stories, but I
would consider the spray on tan — ei
ther from a bottle or in a booth."
But while Mystic Tan is UV-free,
safety is still a concern. The FDA re
cently issued a list of precautions to be
taken before using DH A-based prod
ucts. These precautions include cov
ering the eyes, lips and nasal passages,
and avoiding inhalation or ingestion
of the compound.
Whichever option is chosen to tan,
Tepper emphasized exercising caution
— particularly with more traditional
tanning options.
"Tanning can be dangerous," she
said. "Tanning booths [those that use
UV beams) are bad and if you go out in
the sun, even wearing sunscreen isn't
always effective."
