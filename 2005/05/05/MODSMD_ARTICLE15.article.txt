# College students not as likely to sign up for army as high schoolers
## Army struggles to enlist new recruits 
### JARRET RAFFETY MINNESOTA DAILY 
(IJ-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS —People often
know them when they see them. They're handing
out brochures, telling success stories and encour
aging people to serve their country and the free
doms they enjoy.
From an office in Dinkytown to another on
Lake Street West in Minneapolis, U.S. Army re
cruitment constantly continues in the metro area,
and some University of Minnesota students con
template signing up or actually do join the ranks.
A team of five recruiters leads the work in the
Minneapolis area, looking for future Army sol
diers. They're after people who want career ad
vancement. the opportunity to serve or financial
gain or stability. They also want people with values
and goals that will help them succeed in the chal
lenging environments that wartime can bring, they
said.
Minnesota has 24 Army recruitment stations, of
the approximately 1,700 scattered nationwide.
Mary Lou Eckstrand. U.S. Army Recruiting
Battalion Minneapolis chief of advertising and
public affairs, said there are 41 recruiting battalions
nationwide, with approximately 6,(HH) recruiters on
active duty and approximately 1.7(H) recruiters on
reserve.
Each battalion works in multiple states and
varies in size because of geography and popula
tions. Eckstrand said. The Minneapolis battalion is
in charge of Minnesota, North Dakota and South

Dakota.
Sgt. Ist Class Gary Flowers, U.S. Army recruit
ing station commander, recruits people by dis
cussing what the Army can do for their goals.
Formerly a combat engineer with the 82nd Air
borne Division, Flowers has spent approximately a
third of his 12-year Army career as a recruiter.
Army recruiters do not choose their positions
but are picked by the Army because their mental
competency scores are in the top 10 percent of their
vocational branch.
Soldiers become recruiters after completing a
two-month recruiting school and learning about
Army history, programs, training and benefits nec
essary to recruit.
"Many don't want to recruit at first, but the
communication skills they learn change their
minds," Flowers said. "It's very different talking to
high school students, versus college students, ver
sus parents."
There is no commission for recruiters, and they
are paid like other soldiers, he said.
Flowers said he does have friends serving in
Iraq and Afghanistan, and he wishes he could be
there with them.
"As much as they're putting their lives in dan
ger, I'd like to be with them, watching their back
and protecting them," he said. "But by bringing
them recruits of the same character, values and be
lief to replace my presence, I'm giving them some
one just like me or better."
Recruiting has only become more challenging
since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,2(H) I.

Parents of recruits are more apprehensive
about letting their children enlist. Flowers said.
"The numbers recruited haven't changed, but
the reasons for joining have," Flowers said. "More
are inspired by patriotism and less for the financial
and career opportunities."
He said more people are now interested in com
bat positions. Interest in the Army during wartime
shows strong character and will, he said. Joining
also takes living up to Army values such as loyalty,
duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and
personal courage to succeed. Flowers said.
"We have a standard, and we try our best not to
take away from that standard," he said.
Flowers and his recruiters enlisted 12 Universi
ty students in the Army last year and four so far this
year, he said.
Looking on the streets for people interested in
joining the Army is the most common and success
ful method for recruiting. Flowers said.
Cpl. Chris Mundon has been recruiting for
nearly two months after being selected from the 1-
1 Cavalry Regiment, in which he was an MIAI
armor crewman. He said he can sometimes tell by
looking at someone if they'd be interested in Army
service.
"You don't have to look athletic to be quali
fied," Mundon said. "But sometimes, you can tell
by someone's appearance where their leanings
would be."
Flowers said no recruiter can assume interest,
but if someone shows interest, the recruiter will fol
low up on it.
