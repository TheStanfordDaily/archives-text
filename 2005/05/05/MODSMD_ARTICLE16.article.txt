# Parents favor attractive kids
## 
### GINGER GIBSON THE REVEILLE 
(U-WIRE) BATON ROUGE,
La. — With a mouthful of metal
and not quite the style and glamour
of her older sister, Jan Brady was
convinced everyone liked Marsha
more — and a recent study shows
Jan might have been right.
Professor Andrew Harrell at
the University of Alberta in Cana
da will release a study at the end of
the week that suggests parents treat
their more attractive children bet
ter than their less attractive chil
dren.
In a presentation at the 16th
annual Warren E. Kalback Pop
ulation Conference. Harrell said
his research concludes that par
ents favor more attractive chil
dren because of an evolutionary
bias.
Information Harrell sent The
Daily Reveille via e-mail says past
studies have shown that children
who are more attractive have genes
that are more likely to survive, and
unconsciously parents favor the
child with the better genes.
Harrell and a team of re
searchers followed parents in gro
cery stores for 10 minutes and ob
served how they acted toward their
children.
Researchers observed whether
parents buckled their children into
the cart, how often they permitted
dangerous activities such as stand
ing in the basket and how far they
let their children wander away in
the store.
While observing the parents, re
searchers also ranked the chil
dren's appearance on a scale from
one to ten. Four observers aver
aged their ranks of the children's
appearance to reach an average
score.
The children ranged in ages
from one to five.
Researchers found that 13.3
percent of the most attractive chil
dren were buckled while only 1.2
percent of children categorized as

the least attractive were buckled.
Researchers concluded that fa
thers were more likely to favor at
tractive children when buckling
them into the basket.
Seventy-five percent of adults
allowed their children to wander 10
feet away at least once in a shop
ping trip, and most let them wander
away more than 10 feet at least
three times during a shopping trip
according to the study.
The study found mothers are
more likely to allow 10 or more
feet of distance between them
selves and an unattractive boy or
an attractive girl. But that mothers
and fathers most closely guarded
attractive boys in the grocery
store.
The idea of parents playing fa
vorites based on the appearance of
their children rang true for some
students.
Valerie MacNeill, a philosophy
junior, who is a middle child, said
her dad favors her older sister and
her mom favors her younger sister.
"I was the smart one of the fam
ily, and my sisters were the pretty
ones," she said. "I didn't realize it
until I was 16, and then it really
bothered me. It doesn't bother me
anymore."
Paul Harang, a political science
sophomore, said he never thought
his parents had favorites, but his
sister got more attention.
"My little sister is very good
looking, and she gets a lot of atten
tion," Harang said.
Not all students think their par
ents considered appearances in
their family.
Nicole Zaleski, a psychology
and women's and gender studies
junior, said she was closer to her
mom and her two younger brothers
were closer to her dad.
"I don't think [appearance]
would be the reason, not in my fam
ily," Zaleski said.
Ikechukwu Igbo, a kinesiology
junior, said that while his parents
had favorites, it was not because of
appearances.
