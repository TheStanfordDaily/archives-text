## Editorial Just another media circus 
### 
Six hundred guests, 14 bridesmaids, 14
groomsmen, one priest, one beautiful bride
and one anxious groom. Everything was
perfectly planned for this spring wedding in
the small town of Duluth, Ga. But with every
couple, there are wedding jitters.
But Jennifer Wilbanks, now known as
the "runaway bride," took weddingjitters to
another level when she disappeared while
jogging last Tuesday. She then called her fi
ance and reported that she had been kid
napped. In reality, Wilbanks boarded a
(ireyhound bus to Las Vegas, cut her hair to
disguise herself and took another bus to Al
buquerque, N.M.
Meanwhile, 100 police officers and hun
dreds of friends and family began the search
for this 32 year-old bride-to-be. Quickly,
news outlets drew parallels between
Wilbanks and Laci Peterson, transforming
the search from a missing-persons case to a
criminal investigation. Wilbanks' fiance,
John Mason, was even subjected to a poly
graph test to rule him out as a suspect,
Eour days after the kidnapping,
Wilbanks placed another call to her fiance
admitting that she lied about being kid
napped and instead was the victim of ex
treme pre-wedding nervousness. Soon after,
the town of Duluth and the entire country
learned of Wilbanks' elaborate hoax.
While many people can understand how
stressful and overwhelming a weddingcan be.
everyone following the story was left think
ing,"what the ... ?" Who fakes their own kid
napping to get away from the stress of a wed
ding? Why not just leave a note on the refrig
erator? Why didn't Wilbanks simply escape
to the local motel or to her mother's house?
Whatever her reasons, Wilbanks' wed
ding jitters have come at a high price. In

total, the Duluth Police Department esti
mates that $60,(XX) was spent in the search.
Even beyond the financial resources ex
pended by the town, every news station in
the country jumped to report on this story
because of the recent influx of abductions of
women and girls across the country.
The Wilbanks case had all the makings of
a great, long, drawn-out news story: a plead
ing fiance, crying parents, grainy pictures of
the missing Wilbanks and trivial updates
from the police. This media circus has its ad
vantages in terms of informing the public
and helping the police gather leads, but there
are also a few disadvantages.
Filling the 24-hour news cycle encourages
incessant coverage of stories. Reporters will
stakeout in front of the victim's home or hos
pice and try to extrapolate tiny details to fill
our, the audience's, desire for more informa
tion. They feed us gossip and speculation, and
we feed them our viewership. And the vicious
cycle continues. In the end, the quality of re
porting declines, and the people involved in
these scandals suffer. Viewers should reject
the "constant coverage" mentality and tune
out from stations that choose rumors and
punditry — to say nothing of the invasion of
privacy — over substantive journalism.
Wilbanks just happens to be the news
story of the moment. But given her faux-kid
napping, there are some serious implications
for her wedding jitters. Many think she
should be criminally held accountable for
fakingacrime. However, imprisoning some
one for nervousness is a bit harsh. A more
appropriate punishment would be for
Wilbanks to reimburse the state for the esti
mated $60,000 that was spent on her
"search." Any other consequence would be
a further waste of time and resources.
