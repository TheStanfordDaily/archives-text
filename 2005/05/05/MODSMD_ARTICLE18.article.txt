# Writing in the Margins
## For us crazies, by us crazies

1 saw Dave Eggers last
Wednesday. Walking into
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, I
could see the rabid Dave
fans. Dressed in their
hippest finery (black cor
duroy pants so new the
fabric still glimmers, but
ton down shirts with
smooth white undershirts
beneath, patent leather

shoes with white piping,
and short, gelled hair — retro glasses option
al), the Dave Heads surrounded me in Row A.
I stuck out, with my smelly t-shirt and jeans,
and hair that doesn't need petroleum based
additives to be greasy. Glancing through my
program, I caught sight of the Man.
"Oooh! He's cute," my HPAC Ashni
oozes as she glances over my shoulder, catch
ing sight of the Man. Her purring sends shivers
down my spine.
Dave Eggers is a writer. He composes fic
tion, most recently "How We Are Hungry."
a collection of stories with a title that refuses
to be forgotten. But Dave isn't the only au
thor in his galaxy; he's surrounded by writers.
His older brother, a Republican operative (as
Dave refers to him), writes books. His
younger brother and sister-in-law are authors
as well, and his wife has been known to put
out a good tome. He's so steeped in the world
of writers, a world I don't imagine being full
of beautiful people, that it's hard to wrap my
head around Ashni's gushing. He's supposed
to be moderately unattractive and smelly,
like me.
On my left side, the face of Alyssa (my SLE
tutor) lights up, and a smile creeps across her
face, growing unsustainably. And so the Man
steps out. He looks exactly like his picture in

the program if that man were going out to din
ner at a nice restaurant. He walks to the podi
um and squints in the light. He seems so nor
mal, calm and centered. He drops humorous
anecdotes about the Patriot Act, and things 1
didn't write down, but I'm fairly sure that at
least one person I went with characterized him
as being "charismatic." I can feel the fan-girls
sighing and swooning even now, thinking
about what a nice, cute guy Dave is—l'm
wedged between them.
"Normal people write things, but crazy peo
ple have writings," Dave jokes, adding that he
thinks he falls into the former category.
However, I can see the Dave behind the
podium and suspect that he has more writings
than he lets on. The facade of the normal,
charismatic gives way to an image of a fidgety
man. His face looks serene, but his hands
refuse to stop moving. They uncontrollably
wrap themselves around the podium again and
again, or they grasp the microphone, the water
bottle, anything. He wrings them every now
and then, to stir things up. The frenetic move
ment finds its way down to his feet. They move
back and forth, searching fora comfortable
posture which doesn't exist. His right heel rises
and falls mechanically while his toes remain
tethered to the ground. When Dave makes his
way to a chair, he props up his right leg, reveal
ing the sole of his shoe. The sole, still relatively
unworn, has fractured where his heel strains
the rubber. His heel is quite quirky.
"Oooh!" I squeal in my mind, "His heel is
crazy! And I like it."
He may have writings after all, and I prefer
writings to the things people write.

Seth would like to have Dave Eggers title his
columns, bind out how hungry he is at ssham
han@stanford. edu.
