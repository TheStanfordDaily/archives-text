T-shirt not sponsored by computer
science department
In response to Betty Zhao's letter "Com
puter science T-shirts are offensive" (May
2), the computer science department does
not have an annual department T-shirt and is
not in any way sponsoring on endorsing the
shirt students are distributing this year.
We are well aware of the gender imbal
ance in engineering disciplines, including
computer science, and are actively trying to
help solve the issues it creates. We have an
active group. Women in Computer Science
(http://wics.stanford.edu/) that provides
mentoring, workshops, a speaker series and
other activities. Women lecturers and pro
fessors teach several of our most popular
courses and advise a significant number of
computer science students. Female students
are section leaders and teaching assistants
for several of the first courses students take
when considering majoring in computer sci
ence. We are striving to create an environ
ment where both men and women feel com
fortable and that they can succeed, and we

welcome constructive input to that end.

Measure A deserves support
When our family moved to the Bay Area
in 19f>4, we paid a premium price (a whop
ping $32,500) to buy a house in Palo Alto be
cause of its reputation for good schools. We
witnessed firsthand how parents, teachers,
administrators and good financing can make
for excellence in education. Our four chil
dren benefited from this good basic training
and now seven of our grandchildren have
been privileged to be in the Palo Alto school
system. Needless to say, we are two senior
citizens who fully support passage of Mea
sure A.the renewal of the school parcel tax,
on the June 7 ballot. Even if we did not have
children or grandchildren in the schools we
would support this measure because strong
schools benefit our entire community.
