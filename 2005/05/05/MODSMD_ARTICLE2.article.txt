"What number did you get?"
That was probably the most-asked question among
non-graduating undergraduates yesterday, when Draw
numbers were released. It's likely that some jumped
for jubilation and others shed tears. But it may well be
the case that no one at Stanford should complain - by
some outside standards, residential life here may be as
good as it gets.
A recent New York Times article applauded Rutgers
Douglass College in New Jersey for its unique, revolu
tionary system in which their residences have themes,
such as "The Human Rights House," which bears the
symbol of the United Nations in its lounge. Stanford's
East Coast counterparts were commended for having
similar programs and for instigating a new wave of em
phasis on undergraduate education in housing.
But it's no secret that at Stanford, theme dorms have
existed for decades.
"We truly try to make the experience in the resi
dences a learning and personal growth experience in
the context of a major research university," said Jane
Camarillo, director of residential education since 1995.
The formal organization of Residential Education at
Stanford has been in existence since the late 19605, ac
cording to Camarillo.
Residential education, as described on its Web site,
is based on "the essential conviction ... that living and

Universities across the country are starting to adopt resi
dential life programs that incorporate learning into dorm
life, much like the one that exists at Stanford.
learning should be integrated not
separate; that formal teaching, in
formal learning and personal sup
port in residences is integral to a
Stanford education."
Thom Massey, associate dean of
student affairs, served on committee
in 1%9 that proposed the first ethnic
theme dorm.
"The idea has always been to pro
mote cross-cultural education,"
Massey said. "As the program rapid
ly developed, there was a shift from
simply thinking about the ethnic con
centration to thinking about the ef
fect that ethnicity and culture has on
the development of students."
As more and more colleges devel

op residential education systems,
Stanford can truly be seen as a model
for effective residential education.
"Stanford believes that educa
tion transcends the walls of the
classroom and has a place inside of
the dorms," said Arcadio Morales,
a residence dean for Governor's
Corner and a resident fellow in
Twain.
Resident fellows are one of the
many layers of support available to
undergraduates and play a big role in
choosing dorm staff. Ellen Morales,
also a resident fellow, said "the best
part of residential education is the
personal role we get to play in the de
velopment of the staff as leaders."
The Morales' devote much of their
time and energy to promoting a
healthy dorm environment.
"I love working with Stanford
students because they enter curious,
innocent, and vulnerable, and leave

as mature, self-confident, and inde
pendent," Arcadio said. "1 like to
think that somewhere along the line,
I had a hand in this outcome."
Not only was Stanford one of the
first college campuses to actively
employ residential education, but
also its true uniqueness stems from
the diversity of options. Whether
you are interested in a rigorous in
house academic environment like
Structured Liberal Education, an
ethnic theme dorm like the African
American-themed Ujamaa or sim
ply a non-traditional dorm environ
ment like a co-operative house —
Stanford has it.
Robyn Smith, the focus assistant
in Murray, helps to promote and in
tegrate the theme of Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity into
dorm life. Every focus assistant
spends one quarter teaching a
course in the dorm on a topic related

to the theme.
"My course was called The Inter
section of Race and Ethnicity and So
ciety,' " Smith said. "Every week we
looked at a different aspect of how
race and ethnicity affect your life."
Smith said that themed dorms
allow education to transcend the
walls of classrooms.
"I've had so many informal con
versations in which we talked about
all sorts of issues," she said. "The
dorm community is enriching and
lends itself to learning."
Resident assistants at Stanford
are unique also from any other col
lege, according to Kyle Bruck, the
only RA returning to his staff posi
tion for the third year.
"Staffing is definitely one of the
greatest opportunities here at Stan
ford," Bruck said. "You learn a lot
about yourself, how to let your ego
go, and how to take criticism."
