# Let it be
## GERs waste students' time 
### 
My dad has a saying:
"The fact that people ask
whether you believe in
something is a good indi
cation it doesn't exist." A
Google search for "Does
God exist" pulled up
1 ()3.(HH) Web sites, but a
search for "Does Clinton
exist" "did not match any
documents." You'd think

someone would he wondering.
1 think that also goes for whether things
matter. If people keep debating whether
something is important, then maybe its days
are numbered.
Thus, 1 noted one of this spring's courses:
"Does Literature Matter?" Granted, I'm not
taking this course, and 1 can't speak about its
content, but the title amuses me.
I do know that my I-Hum lectures and
sections addressed this topic. My professors
debated whether literature mattered,
whether it's worth studying the humanities,
etc., and they always came up with the same
answer: yes.
Of course they're going to say that the hu
manities matter, after staking their intellec
tual and professional value in them, just as
most psychotherapists and their patients will
say that treatment helped. Who would vol
untarily devalue their own profession or
admit that something they've put extensive
time and money into doesn't matter?
But the question is not "Does it matter?"
but "Does it matter very much compared to
other things?"
"Does X matter?" is almost a pointless
question, because in a chaotic world, every
thing matters. You've probably heard the
saying about a butterfly causing a hurricane.
Maybe someone's book on the symbolism in
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" will inspire a
teenager to buy her first lit-crit book upon

which she will become interested in scholar
ly pursuits and do well enough in school to
come to Stanford, where she will start out as
a humanities major but realize that the hu
manities aren't really going anywhere and
thus switch to management science and engi
neering, make several million dollars and do
nate it all to the Rewilding Fund to preserve
wild spaces. So yes, I'll agree with the world's
humanities scholars — studying the humani
ties matters.
But how much do the humanities matter
compared to other things?
In science and engineering, a common
way to find out whether something matters is
to remove it, at least in a simulation, and see
how things are different.
Imagine the world without literary criti
cism. I'll grant that it would lack some of the
good aspects of lit crit, but I don't know
whether it would be so different. But then
imagine the world without computer science
or biology.
And for courses, imagine a Stanford edu
cation without the gender studies require
ment or without I-Hum. If you performed a
long-term study on students with and with
out the humanities GERs, I'm not sure you'd
find much difference. If there were a notice
able difference, I'd expect it to be that the
students who weren't forced to take human
ities would read more after college.
I'm sure that plenty of people have had
great experiences in their I-Hum and hu
manities courses. There must be scores of
students who think they got something out of
their required courses.
Yet the question is not "Did they get
something out of these courses?" but "Did
they get more from them than they would
have gotten from other courses?"
I hinted at this to my 1-Hum teaching fel
low. "I-Hum is bad for my education," I said.
She didn't see how this could be true. But it

seems to me that even if we're getting some
thing out of our humanities GERs, we're get
ting less out of them than we'd get from other
uses of our time, energy and course credits.
General requirements "hurting" students?
How can that he, you might protest. But I
think it's happening even now. Someone I
know from my stochastic processes class said
one reason American students are so far be
hind their foreign counterparts in science and
technical subjects might be that we're held
back by all these breadth requirements.
And there are other ways general re
quirements can hurt students. They create
the situation 1 hoped I'd left behind in high
school — students taking courses they'd
rather not be in. Besides being hard on
teachers, taking courses just to fulfill re
quirements leads to the unpleasant feeling
that you're being forced to learn something
you don't think is important and trying to
squeak by while diverting as little time and
effort as possible from things that actually
are interesting and important to you.
So what's my solution?
Easy. The same way that honors work in
a major is optional, GERs should be option
al. Just as students can decide whether ful
filling honors requirements and earning the
distinction will benefit their education, stu
dents should be allowed to decide whether
they want to earn distinction in each of the
GER areas.
As for people who keep arguing that the
humanities really matter and people need to
study them, I dedicate this quote from
"Hamlet": "The lady doth protest too much,
methinks."
