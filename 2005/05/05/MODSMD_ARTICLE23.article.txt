# Princeton students protest
## Opposition against Frist's attempt to block filibusters 
### NEIR ESHEL THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
The filibuster at Princeton Universi
ty's Frist Campus Center continued
into its eighth day yesterday, as the
taping of a lengthy segment on
MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris
Matthews" drew hundreds of stu
dents to the event and brought out
the first organized counter-protest
since the rally began.
Chanting "FIL-i-BUS-ter" and
holding signs reading "Support mi
nority rights," crowds of students
came to defend the filibuster and
protest a push by Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist, Class of 11)74,t0l l )74,to
change Senate rules to make it more
difficult for Democrats to block judi
cial nominees.
A smaller group of students, car
rying a cardboard cutout of Presi
dent Bush and signs reading "Major
ity rules" and "Yea or nay without
delay," showed up to support Frist
whose family contributed $25
million to the campus center — and
oppose the filibuster.
"It's slightly disrespectful that

Frist gave $25 million and we come
and crap on his doorstep," former
College Republicans president Evan
Baehr, a senior, said. "This is a polit
ical stunt. It's great to heighten
awareness of these issues, but not
when you confuse people because of
false premises."
Meanwhile, camera crews from
"Hardball" came to televise the
event, and Chuck Pennacchio, a De
mocratic candidate for the U.S. Sen
ate in Pennsylvania, became the lat
est addition to the roster of politi
cians who have come to speak.
Braving the weather under a multi
colored umbrella, hundreds of stu
dent activists have spoken out for
more than 175 straight hours against
Frist's proposed rule change, which
would allow a simple majority of 51
senators to end debate on judicial
nominees, rather than the 60 cur
rently needed.
The filibuster is the only method
to avoid "power-mongering" in the
Senate, said Pennacchio, a professor
at the University of the Arts in
Philadelphia who took questions for
almost an hour.
"Power corrupts and absolute
power corrupts absolutely," he said.
"I'm fighting fora principle here
the right to dissent."
After Pennachio's speech, Chris
Matthews interviewed filibuster or
ganizer Asheesh Siddique, a sopho
more, and College Republicans
member Rob Biederman, a Iresh

man, over satellite uplink, showing
hundreds of thousands of national
viewers a scene of chanting students
waving signs.
"It's great for publicity," Sid
dique said after the interview. "1
think we got our point across. It will
be good for the filibuster, and it
shows that Princeton is active."
Though the filibuster has gar
nered unusual publicity, Baehr said
it "should not be mistaken as the first
real instance of political activism."
"People often talk about apathy ai
Princeton, but we're not apathetic,"
he said. "We just channel our pas
sions in constructive ways. There are
much more constructive ways than
this filibuster."
Earlier in the afternoon. Senator
Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), who is travel
ing this week in Darfur, sent a press
secretary to read a statement sup
porting the filibuster.
"Thank you for continuing to
draw attention to this fight," the
statement read. "I applaud your
civic mindedness and strong belief in
the ideals of America."
Congressmen Rush Holt (D-
N.J.) and Frank Pallone (D-N.J.)
have already spoken at the event, as
well as Nobel laureate Frank
Wilczek GS, Class of 1M75. In addi
tion to "Hardball," the filibuster has
been featured in the Washington
Post, CNN. the AP wire, the Thorn
Hart mann radio she>w and on dozens
of liberal blogs.
