## The 						Double Clutch It's a shame all these events even happened 
### 
After many years of reading the sports
pages, I am still amazed by the number of
inane stories 1 read through to the end.
Stories that make no sense. Stories that focus on
events that never should have happened. Stories
that offended your very humanity or just made
you scratch your head and flip right over to the
TV page.
I give you the inane headlines of the past year:
Rhythm hires Ashley McElhiney: A year out
of college, the 22-year-old former Vanderbilt
hoops star was hired as coach of the American
Basketball Association's Nashville franchise.
1 frantically scoured the Internet looking for

McElhiney's coaching experi
ence. It was nowhere to be
found, per my research. Say
what? Maybe she coached
AAU during the summers, but
that's barely enough to get a
graduate assistantship.
There's an idea in coaching
known as paying your dues, and
McElhiney hasn't even had
time to get the bill.

The players have spoken well of her, and the
team has won. but not all the sailing has been
smooth. In a January incident that euphemizes
the word "bizarre," franchise co-owner Sally An
thony marched onto the court midgame and fired
McElhiney on the spot, only to rehire her five
days later.
The thing that really stinks about this is that
the Rhythm owner could have made an in-state
call to University of Tennessee women's coach
Pat Summit and within two minutes gotten the
names of 10 female coaches who were ready for
this kind of gig. The farce that ensued between
McElhiney and Anthony has probably killed
those other coaches' chances fora while.
I don't have any opposition to women coach
ing men. All I'm saying is that when the time
comes, I want somebody tried and true to take the
step into history.
The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim: This
just makes no sense. Apparently they took a cue
from the New York Jets and Giants, both of
whom have their main offices in New Jersey.
Anaheim isn't even in Los Angeles County. I
think Dan McCarthy was on to something with
his the-mayor-is-sleeping-with-the-owner's-wife
theory.
The Full-Year NHL loekout: Eviscerating the
heart of Canada, the labor-owner impasse has
kept the Zambonis quiet. Meanwhile, no one
south of the 40th parallel noticed.
What's even more surreal is the collective
yawn of the sporting world. ESPN has painted
over its hockey programming with poker, college
football spring practices and even (yay!) Softball.
Any fans won over when hockey moved into
the South will almost surely not come back. I ad
vise that the league contract to the original six
franchises and rebuild from there.
Navin Sivanandam's Daily columns: This
bum whines about his lack of sex life and with a
series of backhanded and fronthanded com
ments, blames it on the EE department. He for
gets to tell readers that he's a freaking physics stu
dent and apparently didn't realize that the frat
party scene doesn't extend to grad school. (If he
still wants it, I can probably swing him an audition
for Old School II.)
Meanwhile he admits the fact that he's read
the Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy series. The
women must be fawning.
Kandy Johnson traded to the Yankees: Is
every great player of the generation going to wear
a Yankee uniform? And what's with the NYY
pitching staff, with a median major-league tenure
of 13 years?
"The Curse": The Curse of the Bambino
ended, according to Peter Gammons, with the
Red Sox's postseason win over the Yankees last
October. But for too long, it was a running punch
line to a joke that no one in Boston got.
Let's get one thing straight. No one in New
England blames the 1919 sale of Babe Ruthforthe
handful of bizarre Red Sox mishaps. That's be
cause no one up there ever believed in the damn
curse. If they believed in it, Boston's Fenway Park
wouldn't have been one of the most hostile envi
ronments in baseball for decades on end.
And if The Curse is over, can loathsome au
thor and Boston Globe reporter Dan Shaugh
nessy quit profiteering on this mythology now?
And the rest of the baseball world can stop talk
ing about it, too â€” as if Brewers and Padres fans
had any right to mock Boston's baseball past.
Rick Neuheisel's wrongful termination law
suit: Slick Rick claimed he'd been unfairly lired
after taking part in NCAA-violating basketball
pools and lying to investigators about it. Alter
lying his way through four years as Washington's
football coach, he expected the jury to trust him as
a character witness. It gets dumber: turns out the
NCAA violated its own policies in the course of
the investigation, leaving Rick on the right side of
a combined $4.5 million settlement.
Super Bowl 39: Despite the backstories of the
Patriots consummating their dynasty and Terrell
Owens playing with guts on a sore leg. this game
was a stinker. Everyone made brainless mistakes.
Donovan McNabb wilted under the pressure.
Tom Brady looked nothing like the quarterback
he was in two other Super Bowls. Busted cover
ages, fumbles, bad calls; the whole thing was a
quagmire.
By the end of the third quarter, I didn't even
care who won; I just wanted the game to get itself

more sloppy, careless football.
Paul Hamm's gold medal: A
judge's scoring error gave the Ameri
can gymnast gold at the Athens
Olympics. Howls came from all cor
ners that Hamm should cede his
medal to South Korea.
I sympathize with the anger over
poor officiating, but it's dangerous to
set a precedent of overturning results
after the fact. The first rule of any
sport is that the winner at the end of
the contest is the winner. Unless an
athlete was shown to be cheating,

that's the end of the story.
When the lOC overturns the Sovi
et theft of the 1972 Olympic basket
ball final and rightfully awards the
U.S. team its gold medals, South
Korea can have its gymnastics gold.
Honorable Mention: Norm Chow
quits USC, goes to the NFL; Aaron
Rodgers falls in NFL Draft (who
cares?); Braves clinch 2005 NL East
crown yet falter in postseason (you
know it's going to happen); MIT de
fensive end named Academic All-
America; Stanford wins Sears Tro
phy; Trailblazers player (take your
pick) in trouble with the law; the sec
ond season of "The OC."
