## Women anxious for possible Cal matchup on Saturday

After a heartbreaking 11-10 loss to California in the
finals of last year's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
tournament, the Stanford women's lacrosse squad will

look for payback this weekend at the conference cham

6 a conference title might catapult the Cardinal into the
NCAA tournament for the first time in school history.
The top-seeded Cardinal will first look to extend
their perfect conference record this Friday against the
winner of Thursday's Oregon / UC-Davis matchup.
Stanford will be a heavy favorite against either squad, as
the Cardinal had little trouble in dispatching either foe
earlier in the season.

A 19-6 victory over Oregon and an 11-4 conquest of
UC-Davis, both in February, provide head coach
Michelle Uhlfelder's squad with confidence heading
into Friday's semifinal matchup.
"I think it's actually an advantage to play a team
you've already beat," freshman goalie Laura Shane said.

even larger contest looms on Satur

a dream matchup.
"I think it's really important to
show we are able to compete not
only nationally, hut also on the West
Coast," Shane said. "Obviously, we

but it'd be more intense than the
regular season game."
Both teams would enter the con
test seeking revenge. Stanford suf
fered an 11-10 setback in last year's
MI'SF title game. This season. Stan
ford's April 1 home victory by the
same 11-10 margin would provide
( al with plenty of motivation as well.
"The stakes are higher," Shane
said. "They'll want some revenge on as
for their earlier loss. We'll have to
come out strong and more fired up
than they are. I know that the team
from last year is looking to revenge the

the ( ardinal will thrive physically.
"Conditioning-wise and all that.

we're definitely prepped from the
offseason to handle two games,"
Shane said.
Shane said she also recognizes
that the Cardinal will need to sum
mon determination and grit to win
two consecutive matches.
"We just have to be mentally
tough." said Shane, who enters the
weekend with IK9 saves, second in
single-season school history. "I
think we're prepared. Our coach
tried to schedule a weekend earlier
in the season where we played two
MPSF games on a Friday and a Sun
day just to give us a feel for that. We
just have to take it one game at a
time. We'll scout the game on Fri
day first, and if we win that, then
we'll move on to Saturday. We're
definitely not going to look ahead."
If the Cardinal conclude the
weekend with two victories. Stanford
will await the NCAA's selection an
nouncement with baited breath, hop
ing that it earns its first-ever bid to
the NCAA tournament. Stanford
enters the MPSF tournament ranked
1 in the nation, and the NCAA se
lects 16 teams for tournament, so two
victories would appear to put the
Cardinal squarely on the bubble.
"Making the tournament would
be a huge thing for this program to
accomplish," Shane said. "It's been
our goal ever since the program start
ed. For the seniors leaving this year,
it would be incredible. I don't even
understand how the selection works,
but we all know if we're even going to
have a chance, we have to do really
well this weekend, and hopefully
something good will come of it."

While Stanford has never played back-to-back games this season, coach Michelle Uhlfelder's team feels prepared to possibly do so this weekend.
