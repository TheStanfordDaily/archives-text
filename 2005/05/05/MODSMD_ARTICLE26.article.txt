# Stanford tackles Regional
## Cardinal women set sights on top-eight finish 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The top eight teams. Be one of them. This
week. That's all that matters.
Only once a year is the Stanford women's golf
team's mission this clear. At this week's NCAA
West Regional, the Cardinal must finish in the top
eight in a 21-team field to advance to their 17th
consecutive NCAA Championship Tournament.
In Stanford's appearance at the Pacific-10
Conference Championship two weeks ago, a win
or top-three finish would have been great for the
sake of confidence and seeding, but the Cardi
nal's ticket to the NCAA West Regional was al
ready reserved after a strong regular season per
formance.
But today none of that matters.
After three rounds of play, the top eight
teams from the field of 21, as well as two individ
uals from non-qualifying teams, will advance to
play in the NCAA Championship in Sunriver,
Ore., on May 17.
"We've all put in hours last weekend," senior
Wendra Liang said. "Various players have been
working on specific things in the past week or so,
and we're seeing the changes come together."
As the Cardinal applied the finishing touches
in practice, they headed to Las Cruces, N.M.,

and the New Mexico State University Golf
Course, site of this year's three-day 54-hole re
gional. The hosts, however, will be forced to sit
on the sidelines this year. After qualifying for 11
consecutive NCAA Regionals, the Aggies did
not receive an at-large hid to this year's event.
Although the Cardinal competed against
some top-notch fields during the course of the
year, a finish in the top eight this week will he no
mean feat given the strength of the West Region.
No. 2 UCLA is the runaway favorite in this
field and easily the hottest team in the country.
The defending national champion is once again
hitting its stride at the right time; the Bruins have
won their last four tournaments and all but one
event this spring. Their worst finish since the fall
was a runner-up performance at the Regional
Challenge in February,
Two Bruins, seniors Charlotte Mayorkas and
Susie Matthews, are ranked in the nation's top
10 as individuals, and along with UCLA fresh
man Amie Cochran, were named to the All Pac
-10 First Team.
Stanford will also get a chance to compete
against teams from the South and East for the
first time since September's Fall Preview. No. 5
Georgia, No. 7 Oklahoma State and No. 9 Ten
nessee will all join the fray, as will familiar Pac
-10 foes No. 16 Southern California, No. 17 Ari
zona, No. 23 Washington State and No. 25 Cali
fornia.
