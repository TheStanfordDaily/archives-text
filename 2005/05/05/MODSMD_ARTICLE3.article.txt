# GSC evaluates grad student health care
## Task Force predicts care to worsen for undergrads 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
In its first meeting under its new leader
ship, the Graduate Student Council last night
heard concerns related to impending prob
lems in graduate student health care.
According to Maria Elena Gonzalez, a
graduate student in sociology and member of
the Graduate Health Care Task Force, health
care issues will continue to worsen for gradu
ate students and will likely become a problem
for undergraduate students as well.
"The health care market will become un
sustainable in the next decade and out of the
reach of the middle class," she said.
Gonzalez, along with medical student Lisa
Wong, told the GSC that Stanford's location,
with the high cost of living in surrounding

areas, does little to dispel the rising costs of
health premiums.
"We live in the most expensive health care
market in the U. 5.," Gonzalez said. "We don't
live close to a hospital other than Stanford's,
which is one of the most expensive hospitals in
the region."
Finding cheaper hospital care in Mountain
View or Redwood City is also problematic for
the large number of Stanford students without
cars — especially freshman who are prohibit
ed from having cars on campus, she said.
Gonzalez added that undergraduates will
likely begin placing a greater strain on the
Cardinal Care system, which would adversely
affect coverage for graduate students and un
dergraduates alike.
"The trend is that people are restricting
health care plans to persons 19 and under, and
more undergrads will be going on the Vaden
health care plan," she said. "It used to be a
graduate student problem. It's going to be-
come an institutional problem."
Tom Lee. a third-year engineer
ing student and GSC deputy chair,
said that many graduate students
remain concerned about their
health care options.
"Health care costs continue to
be a major issue for graduate stu
dents, especially those with fami
lies." he said. "We've had increases
of more than 20 percent for the last
two years. At this point, we defi
nitely need to find some sustainable
long-term solutions for this prob
lem."
Wong said the Graduate Health
Care Task Force recommended
several potential solutions to the
GSC, including advocating for the
provost's office to subsidize a new
plan for dependent students, as well
as looking into a cross-subsidized
plan.
However, she clarified that
many of the proposed solutions are
"viable options for single students,
hut not if you have preexisting con
ditions such as asthma or allergies."

Also at the meeting, the GSC di
versity committee reported on an
ongoing survey designed to seek
out and address diversity issues at
the University's seven graduate
schools.
The committee received strong
support from GSC leadership.
"1 think everyone in the GSC is
eager to see the results of the diver
sity committee survey," said GSC
Chair Jenny Allen, a first-year law
student. "The survey will he a very
valuable tool because it will get stu
dent anecdotes which have not
been previously available in survey
format."
While some students questioned
whether their identity would be
protected when the survey's results
are published. Lee maintained that
confidentiality is important to those
conducting the survey.
"We want to be able to get an
idea of people's experiences while
still respecting their privacy," he
said.
The GSC last night also ap
proved funding requests from the
Chicano / Latino Graduate Student
Association, Stanford Canadian
Club, Stanford India Association,
and SOUL'D OUT, the first gradu
ate student hip-hop group.
