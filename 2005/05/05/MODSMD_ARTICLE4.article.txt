## 
### MARI HAYMAN 
Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck announced tentative plans to open an
other Palo Alto restaurant last Sunday during a Passover Seder held at
Spago, his existing restaurant on Lytton Ave. The opening of the pro
posed restaurant — which Puck predicted would be "sometime in 2006"
— would coincide with his son's enrollment into Stanford in the falL
"I come here (to Palo Alto) about once a month. But since my son
is planning to go to Stanford, 1 will be spending much more time
here," said the Los Angeles-based chef.
Stanford students unaccustomed to fine dining concepts like bread
"sculptures" and.for that matter, salad forks, are probably unfamiliar
with Puck's sophisticated brand of cuisine, which at Spago includes
pizza topped with black caviar. Most students were markedly under
whelmed when they heard the rumor about Puck's new restaurant.
"Wolfgang Puck? If you hadn't said 'restaurant' I would have as
sumed he had something to do with hockey," senior Kelly Wells said.

What's your lucky number?

"As far as I'm concerned, it's just an
other restaurant in Palo Alto that I can't
afford ... and unless it's expanding into
the space currently occupied by a park,
public library, or La Bodeguita del
Medio [a Cuban restaurant on Califor
nia Ave.], it is utterly irrelevant to my
life."
Puck did not say whether the new
restaurant will be targeted at college
students or offer cheaper menu items
than its predecessor, which caters most
ly to a crowd of power-lunchers in their
late thirties.
Spago publicist and special events
manager Mishel LeDoux declined to
comment on the food or the predicted
clientele base that the new restaurant
would serve.
"(The new restaurant] is rumor. I
have no new information at this point."
During his visit to Palo Alto. Puck
had remarked that the restaurant "still
is very much in the talking stages."
In the meantime. Stanford stu
dents don't seem to be holding their
breaths for the restaurant's grand
opening.
"I'm pretty sure the restaurant's out
of my price range." said senior Karl
Goodman.
For students like Goodman and
Wells, they might find some consola
tion in a chance to see Puck's son eating
with them at Stern dining next year.
