### MARI HAYMAN 
Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck announced tentative plans to open an
other Palo Alto restaurant last Sunday during a Passover Seder held at
Spago, his existing restaurant on Lytton Ave. The opening of the pro
posed restaurant — which Puck predicted would be "sometime in 2006"
— would coincide with his son's enrollment into Stanford in the falL
"I come here (to Palo Alto) about once a month. But since my son
is planning to go to Stanford, 1 will be spending much more time
here," said the Los Angeles-based chef.
Stanford students unaccustomed to fine dining concepts like bread
"sculptures" and.for that matter, salad forks, are probably unfamiliar
with Puck's sophisticated brand of cuisine, which at Spago includes
pizza topped with black caviar. Most students were markedly under
whelmed when they heard the rumor about Puck's new restaurant.
"Wolfgang Puck? If you hadn't said 'restaurant' I would have as
sumed he had something to do with hockey," senior Kelly Wells said.
