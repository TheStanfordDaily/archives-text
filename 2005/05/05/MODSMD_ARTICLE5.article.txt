# Alumna links feminism, dance and striptease
## 
### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
"Can there be feminism at strip
clubs?" Stanford alumna Wendy Mari
naccio asked her audience, adding that it
is a question that has baffled her and her
fellow feminists for years. Marinaccio
spoke on Tuesday as a guest to Dance
161: "Dance and Live Art in the 20th

Century," a course offered through the
Dance Division, part of the Drama De
partment.
Marinaccio said her academic interest
in dance and feminism was cultivated
through her experiences as a Stanford
dollie, a drummer and feminist studies
major. Even so, she said that from a fem
inist perspective she was unsure whether
being a drummer was better than being a

dollie, a role that seemed, to her, to ob
jectify women.
This "conundrum" led her to pursue
further studies in dance and feminism
and to develop an academic interest in
the performance aspect of striptease
from a feminist's point of view.
Because it has been so stigmatized,
stripping has not been explored within a
theoretical framework, she said.

"Part of the stigma associated with
striptease dancing is that the performers
are valued for their bodies and not their
minds," she said, challenging the societal
mentality that devalues the body. "Why
are we so excited to see Barishnikov? Is it
just because of his meaning? His virtuos
ity? Or could we also be excited because
he is incredibly attractive?"
In her exploration of the rele
vance of stripping to dance and vice
versa, she studied dance theory
works, feminist theories, the history
of stripping and went to 19 strip
clubs from Manhattan to San Fran
cisco.
Marinaccio said that stripping is
closely tied with what our culture
values: sex, desire, money and con
sumption. These values are also es
sential to ballet and other perfor
mance arts, she said. She also
stressed that desire and pleasure of
watching bodies are intrinsic to both
dance and striptease.
This notion of stripping as perfor
mance dance renders a feminist
ideal viable in the striptease dancer.
"Striptease dancers have the po
tential to rework conceptions of the
subject and object of the gaze, the
body, money and art to unexpected
ly come up with sexual liberation,
agency, monetary gain and power
for women." Marinaccio said.
She also called into the question
the idea that audience members
control performances as spectators
and paying customers.
"She has control over her cos
tume. choreography â€” her job is to
create a fantasy," she said. "So the
striptease spectator is paying to

watch strip dancing, to participate in
a fantasy, but not to have control of
a woman's body."
She emphasized that through dis
playing the virtuosity and beauty of
their bodies in dance movement,
strippers can not only escape being
objectified but also empower them
selves by being in control of the situ
ation and earning money.
This subversion of the concep
tions of "the subjectivity and objec
tivity, the body, money and art"
provides a meaningful connection
between striptease dancing and
concert dance, Marinaccio said.
She urged that even though she still
questions exactly what constitutes
art. the more inclusive definition of
dance should be pursued and the
similarities between dance and
striptease should not be over
looked.
"I thought it would be valuable
for Stanford undergraduates to be
exposed to the work of a young
scholar who is bringing a feminist
perspective to investigate striptease
as a performance practice," said
Dance Prof. Janice Ross, who teach
es the class.
Marinaccio has worked at the
San Jose Office of Cultural Affairs,
the Brooklyn Arts Council and City
Center Theater in New York City.
Following graduation from Stan
ford. she earned a master's degree in
performance studies with a focus in
dance and feminism from New York
University's Tisch School of the
Arts.
