Robert L. Joss, dean of Stanford's Graduate School of Busi
ness, was re-elected to the board of directors of Wells Fargo on
April 26. This is his 22nd year working for the bank, and his
sixth year on the board.
Joss is one of two academics sitting on the governing body.
The other, Cynthia Milligan. is the dean of the College of Busi
ness Administration at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.
The board includes one attorney and 12 former chairmen of
other companies.
Prior to Joss' appointment as dean of the Business School in
1999, he served as chief executive officer at one of Australia's
largest banks. Before that, he worked as assistant secretary for
economic policy at the U.S. Treasury Department, where he
was also a White House fellow. He started working with Well
Fargo in 1971.
"As a Business School dean and faculty member, this board
work keeps me in touch with the reality of today's legal and
commercial practice, which is helpful in terms of student inter
ests," Joss said in an interview with The Daily.
"Stanford is my full time job," he added. "This service as a
director is concentrated into bi-monthly meetings that involve
about 10 days per year."
Joss explained that a lot of the Business School's faculty
members serve on industry boards.
"It is fairly common, especially where the person has certain
experience or expertise that complements that of other board
members in the company's particular industry," he said, citing
as an example University President John Hennessy. who was
appointed to Google's board of directors last year.
