EDNA KATZ
VS. FLUFFY TIE Ml
It's either Fluffy or Aunt Edna. When one has to go, don't call
the kennel. Call us. We're much nicer. Not to mention cleaner.
We feature allergen-free rooms with sophisticated air filtration
systems that deliver fresh clean air. Edna will thank you (and
so will Fluffy).
