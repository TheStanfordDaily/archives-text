Product Stewardship
Product Stewardship. also known as lixtended Product Responsibility or Manufacturer Responsibility is becoming
a popular tool to use to reduce landfill waste by designing products with the end in mind.
What Is Product Stewardship?
Product stewardship is a product-centered approach to
environmental protection. It calls 011 those in the product
life cycle-manufacturers, retailers, users, and disposers
-to share responsibility for reducing the
environmental impacts of products. Product
stewardship recognizes that product manu
facturers can and must take 011 new respon- 1 ™
sibilities to reduce the environmental foot-
print of their products. The product stew- J
ardship approach provides incentives to
manufacturers to consider the entire life- xwM
cycle impacts of a product and its packaging
energy and materials consumption, air and water emis
sions, the amount of toxics in the product, worker safety,
and waste disposal - in product design, and to take
increasing responsibility for the end-of-life management
of the products they produce. The objective of product
stewardship is to encourage manufacturers to redesign

products with fewer toxics, and to make them more
durable, reusable, and recyclable, and with recycled
materials. The challenge of product stewardship is to
move beyond disposal to facilitate a paradigm shift toward
M "zero waste" and "sustainable production."
Where Is It Being Used?
Product Stewardship principles are begin
ning to be used in electronics, carpet, gas
cylinders, mercury products, paint, pesti
cides, and tires, but are also being consid
ered for expansion into everyday common
objects.
