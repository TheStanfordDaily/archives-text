# Seniors Thiry, Hoffman overcome odds together
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Michelle Thiry and Katherine Hoffman
have a lot in common. They arc both fifth
year seniors; they are both play major roles
on the Stanford softball team; and three
years ago. neither thought she would ever
be out on the field again.
Hoffman originally came to Stanford as a
runner, but decided during her sophomore
year that, after multiple injuries sidelined her
for most of her first two years, she would
need to give up cross country and track.
"Running just didn't work out for me,"
Hoffman said. "But 1 am still great friends
with a lot of the girls I ran with on the cross
country team."
Thiry played a year of softball for the
Cardinal before she too had a potentially
career-ending injury. With broken bones in
both hands and some nerve damage in one
of them, she took a redshirt year as a sopho
more to recover.

"1 was a mess," Thiry said.
When the two met during their recover
ies. nobody expected that they would soon
be teammates, but Thiry was persuasive
and Hoffman, who had played competitive
ly throughout high school, was willing to
give it a try.
"She was working on a project with one of
the people in my dorm," Thiry said. "I went
up to show off my new cast — my new hot
pink cast — and we started talking about
softball and I said she should try out."
"That was the quarter I had stopped run
ning and 1 was itching to do some sort of
athletic activity," Hoffman recalled. "1 had
never not done something and 1 was at the
point were my injuries had gotten better. 1
would go running sometimes on my own
and 1 would make people go out and play
catch with me because I had brought my
glove to school."
Thiry convinced Hoffman to make the

Michelle Thiry and Katherine Hoffman have been around the softball program long enough
to know what it takes to make the College World Series. They say the 2005 team has it.
switch to Softball and in the fall the
Cardinal had a new pinch runner.
Hoffman's speed immediately
made her a valuable asset to the
team.
"She's fast," Thiry said of Hoff
man. "We had no speed on our team
at the time. We wanted a bigger
team, so she tried out. Coach was
real excited. He was like, 'Where
has she been the last two years?
Why am I just getting her now?'"
The team has grown consider
ably since Hoffman walked on three
years ago; there are 20 players on
this year's roster, Stanford's biggest
ever.
"When I came here five years
ago, there were 13 of us and three
were just pitchers," Thiry said. "We
had one extra person, so if some-

body got hurt it
was "oh my gosh,
what do we do?'
Now we have so
much depth and
people who can
do so many
things. Every
body is stepping
up and doing
their thing."
"There are al
ways people
pushing and com
peting for every

position and making the entire
team better," Hoffman said. "And
even though there are so many peo
ple on the team, in all of our big
wins, there have been role players
who have come in off the bench.
There are pinch runners and pinch
hitters that are making an impact.
So it's not like there are nine people
out there and the II of us on the
bench. It's all a team effort. It real
ly makes it feel like everyone is a
part of it all."
Hoffman has been one of those
contributors from the bench. Thiry
recalled Hoffman's scoring the
game-winning run against Wash
ington on April 10.
"Hoff came in and made an
amazing slide and got her hand in
there behind Rivera, their monster
catcher," Thiry said. "She got in
there and won the game for us."
T hiry has also made a significant
contribution in her time on the
team. After starting nearly every
game before her injury, she has set
tled into the position of bullpen
catcher and sees action in more
than half of Stanford's games.
In their live- and three-year ca
reers, Thiry and Hoffman have had
many great moments with their
teammates, but they said none quite
matches the "tornado game" against
Oklahoma at last year's College
World Series. The two laughingly re
call the game, which was suspended
with the Cardinal trailing 2-1 in the
sixth inning after a tornado warning
forced the teams and the press into
an underground shelter. They talk
over each other and fill in details like
good friends do.
"We all went into the storm shel
ter," Thiry said. "And [junior pinch
runner| Shoney Hixson starts en
tertaining the reporters by singing."
"She was in the press room with

the microphone at the interview
table. And then Laura [SeversonJ
chimes in because she is a good
singer too," Hoffman added.
Thiry and Hoffman said that
Hixson, an Oklahoma native, was
in the local newspapers the next
day.
"So we had her singing, and
Dana [Sorensen, Class of 2004] get
ting worked on, trying to stay loose
in case we had to go back out there
and play, because she was hurting,"
Thiry said. "And then somebody
brought in this box of hotdogs, so
we're all mowing through these
hotdogs and they decided to call the
game for the day."
When play resumed the follow
ing day, the Cardinal came back to
win, propelled by a leadoff home
run by junior Lauren Lappin. Hoff
man said that Lappin, her room
mate on the trip, had spent the night
thinking about her impending al
ba t.
"The next thing we know, we

win and move
on and have
to come back
and play
UCLA that
same day,"
Thiry said.
"We went 13
innings with
them. Same
day, same
pitcher. It was
unbeliev
able."
"Yeah.

That was a great day," Hoffman
said.
The trip to last year's World Se
ries was the second of Thiry's ca
reer and the first for Hoffman and
most of the Cardinal roster. Thiry
was a freshman when the team
made its only other appearance in
the WCWS in 2001.
"Once you have that taste in
your mouth, you can't imagine
ending your season any other
place but Oklahoma City, because
of the energy and the whole expe
rience," Thiry said. "This year I
think we can do it again. If we
keep playing the way we have
been and don't let up, we'll be
back. I have no doubt."
That would be the perfect end to
the seniors' time at Stanford. Alter
five years on the Farm, the duo is
graduating in June and both have
jobs waiting for them. Thiry will
stay close to Softball, becoming a
volunteer assistant coach at Wash
ington and working with a trainer
with the Seattle Mariners, staying
near her hometown of Kenton.
Wash. Hoffman will put her me
chanical engineering degree to use
with a small company in Kansas
City, also near her childhood home,
making CiPS devices.
This was not how she planned to
spend her college years, but Hoff
man said she has no regrets about
her decision to walk on to the team
as a junior.
"This has been an amazing expe
rience," Hoffman said of her three
years with the softball squad. "I have
made friends that I will have forever.
I look back at when I came here my
freshman year and where I thought
I'd be live years later, and this is def
initely not where 1 thought I would
be. But I'm very happy about the di
rection it went."
