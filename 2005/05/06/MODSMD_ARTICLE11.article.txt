## Candidate's mother looks to Election Day 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SAN ANTONIO — Tomorrow,
Rosie Castro may have more than
just hei birthday to celebrate. One
of her twin sons. Julian, could be
come the next mayor of San Anto
nio or, at the very least, qualify for
the run-off election.
"We're very proud," she says
outside her son's campaign head
quarters in downtown San Antonio.
"That was what we were fighting
for." she says, referring to the op
portunities both of her sons, Julian
and Joaquin, a member of the Texas
House of Representatives, have
taken advantage of to get where

they are today.
She adds that the road to Elec
tion Day has been paved with gener
ations of work and sacrifices, not to
mention hope for the next genera
tion. As a long-time community or
ganizer in San Antonio, she ran for
city council 35 years ago and lost.
Now, she is the proud mother of two
successful politicians.
Stanford played an important
role in shaping the Castro brothers
and their political ambitions, Rosie
Castro says. Both graduated in 19%.
"1 would have loved to have had
the opportunity to go to Stanford,
but that didn't exist," she says. But
nowadays, she says, after genera
tions have fought to make a place
for Latinos in the United States,
she is able to stand in the campaign
headquarters of a real political
player, who also happens to he her
son.
"Every generation pushes it a lit
tle further until you have your right
ful destiny — your rightful place,"
she says.
Part of that place. Rosie Castro
explains, is Stanford and Harvard,
where both of her sons attended law
school. It was at Stanford, she says,
where the Castro brothers' political
ambitions came to the fore when the
two were elected with the highest
number of votes to the ASSU Sen
ate.
"The Stanford Daily was the first
paper to write about our political
careers." Julian says.
"That's really where they decid
ed that this was something they
wanted to do." Rosie Castro says."I
always liked Stanford because I felt
that it gave them a lot of opportuni
ties."
Outside, San Antonio is pleas
antly warm and not too humid —
perfect campaign weather. Rosie
Castro sits with her friends from the

"old days" and they talk about what
campaigning used to be like: manu
al typewriters, no cell phones, no
photocopying machines, no bath
room and one phone. The men
would strategize and the women
would do all the work, they say,
laughing.
"When you're young, you can do
anything," says Anna Riojas, who is
working on Julian's campaign. She
has known him literally since before
he was born.
"What did we have to lose?"
Rosie Castro asks. "We didn't have
anything to lose."
The work that Rosie Castro and
her friends care most about is mobi
lizing people, getting people regis
tered to vote, informing people
about their voting rights.
She is wearing a t-shirt for her
son's campaign and talking about all
the work it has taken to get him
here, but she's still smiling.
"Our generation, by speaking
out. working, running for office, re
ally pushed forward our communi
ties into another leve — being part
of the American mainstream. This
generation can be at the table and
craft policy and express them
selves."
It's crunch time. The election is
tomorrow, but Rosie Castro is
working late into the night. It's time
fora staff meeting, the last one be
fore Election Dav.
