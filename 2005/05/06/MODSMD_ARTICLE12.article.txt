### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Institute for International Stud
ies, or SI IS. will welcome prominent figures from
international relations community to its first-ever
International Day conference being held today at
the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center.
The event, entitled "Challenges in a New
Era," kicks off the recently announced Universi
ty-wide International Initiative, designed to ele
vate Stanford's role as an international influence,
said Political Science Prof. Coit Blacker, director
of SI IS.
"Our primary motivation is to stimulate dis
cussion on these really critical global issues," he
said. "The way to do that is to attract a really in
teresting group of people to Stanford to talk."
The conference will include notable speakers
Hans Blix, chairman of the International Com
mission on Weapons of Mass Destruction and
former leader of weapons inspections in Iraq, and
Paul Collier, a professor from Oxford University
who worked at the World Bank.
Samuel Berger, former National Security Ad
viser to President Clinton, and Phillip Zelikow,
counselor for the U.S. Department of State and
former executive director of the 9/11 Commis
sion, will also deliver lectures.
"Participants wiil include members of the
board of trustees, faculty, graduate students and
undergraduates," Blacker said. "It's been my
view that it should have student participation.
The level of student interest on these issues at
Stanford is very high."
Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan, who will sit
on a panel discussing the future of nuclear
weapons, said that the event provides students
with a real opportunity to see policy makers from
all over the world interact with Stanford faculty
members and researchers.
"It will be a rare opportunity 1 hope people will
take advantage of," he said.
According to Klas Bergman, associate direc
tor for communications for SI IS. the event will
also feature "some of the best of what the Stan
ford faculty can offer," including sessions on top
ics including international health. United Nations
reform and climate change led by a number of
professors from a variety of disciplines.
Faculty panelists will include SIIS Senior Fel
lows Stephen Stedman, David Victor. Alan Gar
ber and University President Emeritus Donald
Kennedy.
"Stanford has a long tradition of bringing ex
cellence in scholarship together with public policy
concerns so that some of the best scientific and
engineering work done can address pressing is
sues of international concern," Sagan said. "The
International Day is an example of that, but also
a model of what we want to do even more of in the
future."
With the launch of the University's Interna
tional Initiative, Stanford will emerge as a "pow
erhouse" for research and policy involvement in
international studies, he added.
"Stanford already has great strengths in inter
national studies," he said. "But the International
Initiative will help grow these strengths into
something quite unique as Stanford becomes a
truly international university."
The University has already taken in nearly
$100 million in new grants and pledges as part of
the Initiative, Blacker said. Some of the funds will
be used to create up to 10 new faculty positions,
and others will probably be devoted to attracting
highly-qualified international students to Stan
ford by extending the need-blind admissions pol
icy to non-citizens.
"We want to take Stanford to the world and
bring the world to Stanford." Blacker said.
