There arc some who say it is his charisma
that has fueled his success. Others assert
that it's his youthful enthusiasm and his
fresh ideas. Regardless, the buzz around
CNN political analyst and Stanford Law
School graduate Carlos Watson is certainly
hard to miss, and the former editor of the
Stanford Law Review ascribes his achieve
ments to his love of learning new things and
a thirst for originality.
In addition to regularly contributing to
various CNN programs. Watson hosts prime
time specials throughout the year during
which he interviews celebrities and politicians
on subjects outside their usual realm. In "Off
Topic with Carlos Watson." he has ques
tioned Shaquille O'Neal about his post-re
tirement political plans, played video games
with supermodel Heidi Klum and discussed
music with Sen. Barack Obama (D-111). Wat
son. a self-described "political junkie." said
the idea for the show sprouted from his long
time love of politics.
"1 thought, 'Wouldn't it be neat to have a

show where you had a diverse number of
guests and instead of them coming to you. you
went out to them." " he said in an interview
with The Daily. "The show marries the best of
some of the different genres and in some ways
brings a youthful flair to it."
Watson said it's his vivacious delivery of
political news that draws in viewers. "1 thinks
it's important to deliver the information with
some energy, with some dynamism," he said.
"And I think that people can tell that I have a
real passion for news, a real passion for poli
tics, current events and history."
Watson, who attended Harvard as an un
dergraduate, attributes much of his success in
the business, journalism and political world to
the experiences he had at Stanford Law
School. A self-described "curious and ener
getic student."Watson, who lived in Crothers
for three years, said he enjoyed the versatility
Stanford offered through its interdisciplinary
approach.
While in law school, he took business, ed
ucation and language classes. He said this
wide range of courses has helped him
throughout his versatile career.

"I think having an interdisciplinary
approach has prepared me to produce
better work," he said.
Watson added that he has benefit
ed from the success stories of Stanford
entrepreneurs such as David Packard
and Excite co-founder Joe Kraus.
"Being here in Silicon Valley and
hearing all those stories about Stan
ford graduates going out there and
taking risks gave me a lot of inspira
tion," he said. "I think what I've
learned and gained from Stanford is a
willingness to take a risk, a willing
ness to try something new, a willing
ness to try something a bit en
trepreneurial."
Shortly after graduating from the
Law School in 1995, Watson began
work at McKinsey & Company, a
global strategic consulting firm.
After two years, he left his job and
co-founded Achieva College Prep
Service, aimed at urban school dis
tricts. Achieva, which was based in
Palo Alto, quickly became highly ac
claimed in publications such as
Forbes and Black Enterprise and
blossomed into one of the leading
educational forces in the country
that helped high schools prepare stu
dents for college.
Watson sold Achieva to a publicly
traded corporation in 2(X)2 but re
mains very active in promoting educa
tion for underprivileged students in
the Bay Area. He is currently on the
board of directors for College Track, a
program he co-founded that aids stu
dents in East Palo Alto and Oakland.
"Carlos has always had a passion
for teenagers and young adults, which
is one of the reasons why he co-found
ed College T rack." said N icole T aylor.
chief executive officer of the organiza
tion and also a Stanford graduate. She
added that Watson frequently visits

the students in the program and
speaks about the opportunities that an
education provides.
And few people would know the
value of a good education better
than Watson. Both of his parents
are teachers and, although he was
pulled out of kindergarten due to
some mischievous behavior early
on. he lauds his parents for keeping
him on track.
"I certainly took from my parents a
willingness to work extremely hard,"
he said. "Both my parents always em
phasized a willingness to go way
above and beyond what is expected."
And Watson's hard work has paid
off. He is currently being touted one of
the contagious personalities in the in
dustry.
After he sold Achieva, he ap
peared on many television interviews,
which became his doorway to a televi
sion career of his own. Since then, he
has worked for CNBC and CNN and
has been a guest on a number of radio
programs, including the Doug Banks
Morning Show and The Tavis Smiley
Show. His weekly political column.
"The Inside Edge with Carlos Wat
son" is one CNN.com's most popular
features.
But even with all of his success,
Watson has not forgotten his ties to
the Stanford community. Many stu
dents said that they often see him at
various basketball courts on campus,
polishing the skills that helped his in
tramural team win the championship
while he was in law school.
"I'm still tied to Stanford in lots of
ways," he said. "Stanford is where I
made some of my best friendships."
Watson advises current Stanford
students to "learn as much off campus
as [they] do on campus." as well as to
"have a well-rounded education."
So what's next for the law student
who went on to become a Silicon Val
ley entrepreneur and is now making
waves in the journalism industry?
Watson laughs at the question.
"You never really know."he said.

for teenagers and young adults, which
is one of the reasons why he co-found
ed College T rack." said N icole T aylor.
chief executive officer of the organiza
tion and also a Stanford graduate. She
added that Watson frequently visits

the students in the program and
speaks about the opportunities that an
education provides.
And few people would know the
value of a good education better
than Watson. Both of his parents
are teachers and, although he was
pulled out of kindergarten due to
some mischievous behavior early
on. he lauds his parents for keeping
him on track.
"I certainly took from my parents a
willingness to work extremely hard,"
he said. "Both my parents always em
phasized a willingness to go way
above and beyond what is expected."
And Watson's hard work has paid
off. He is currently being touted one of
the contagious personalities in the in
dustry.
After he sold Achieva, he ap
peared on many television interviews,
which became his doorway to a televi
sion career of his own. Since then, he
has worked for CNBC and CNN and
has been a guest on a number of radio
programs, including the Doug Banks
Morning Show and The Tavis Smiley
Show. His weekly political column.
"The Inside Edge with Carlos Wat
son" is one CNN.com's most popular
features.
But even with all of his success,
Watson has not forgotten his ties to
the Stanford community. Many stu
dents said that they often see him at
various basketball courts on campus,
polishing the skills that helped his in
tramural team win the championship
while he was in law school.
"I'm still tied to Stanford in lots of
ways," he said. "Stanford is where I
made some of my best friendships."
Watson advises current Stanford
students to "learn as much off campus
as [they] do on campus." as well as to
"have a well-rounded education."
So what's next for the law student
who went on to become a Silicon Val
ley entrepreneur and is now making
waves in the journalism industry?
Watson laughs at the question.
"You never really know."he said.
