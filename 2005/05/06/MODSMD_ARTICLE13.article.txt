There arc some who say it is his charisma
that has fueled his success. Others assert
that it's his youthful enthusiasm and his
fresh ideas. Regardless, the buzz around
CNN political analyst and Stanford Law
School graduate Carlos Watson is certainly
hard to miss, and the former editor of the
Stanford Law Review ascribes his achieve
ments to his love of learning new things and
a thirst for originality.
In addition to regularly contributing to
various CNN programs. Watson hosts prime
time specials throughout the year during
which he interviews celebrities and politicians
on subjects outside their usual realm. In "Off
Topic with Carlos Watson." he has ques
tioned Shaquille O'Neal about his post-re
tirement political plans, played video games
with supermodel Heidi Klum and discussed
music with Sen. Barack Obama (D-111). Wat
son. a self-described "political junkie." said
the idea for the show sprouted from his long
time love of politics.
"1 thought, 'Wouldn't it be neat to have a

show where you had a diverse number of
guests and instead of them coming to you. you
went out to them." " he said in an interview
with The Daily. "The show marries the best of
some of the different genres and in some ways
brings a youthful flair to it."
Watson said it's his vivacious delivery of
political news that draws in viewers. "1 thinks
it's important to deliver the information with
some energy, with some dynamism," he said.
"And I think that people can tell that I have a
real passion for news, a real passion for poli
tics, current events and history."
Watson, who attended Harvard as an un
dergraduate, attributes much of his success in
the business, journalism and political world to
the experiences he had at Stanford Law
School. A self-described "curious and ener
getic student."Watson, who lived in Crothers
for three years, said he enjoyed the versatility
Stanford offered through its interdisciplinary
approach.
While in law school, he took business, ed
ucation and language classes. He said this
wide range of courses has helped him
throughout his versatile career.
