# Alpha Kappa Alpha hosts 11th Dating Game
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even though the participants of
Stanford's 11th annual Alpha Kappa
Alpha Dating Game were not alive
when the original show aired in the
I%(K and 19705, the event's populari
ty rivaled its vintage namesake. Man
zanita Dining Hall, artfully decorated
with the sorority's colors, green and
pink, was packed with by the time the
program began at 8:30 p.m. yesterday.
The game consisted of three
rounds â€” two with three bachelors
competing for one eligible bache
lorette, and one with the situation re
versed. Audience members partici
pated as eligible bachelor and bache
lorettes, and off-campus contestants
were included for the first time in the
event's history.
Questions posed to the potential
suitors included: I just won a trip for
two to the Bahamas, why should I
take you with me? Describe the per
fect meal you would cook for us. If 1
were in a candy shop, what kind of
sweet would you be? And do you
wear boxers or briefs and can you
please show the audience?
Contestants' voices were scram
bled so that the selector could not
identify them. Audience members as
sisted during the decision-making
process by applauding for one of the
three contenders.
"People need to know that there is
dating at Stanford," said senior Sham
Fregia, co-chair of AKA's Dating
Game. "We just wanted students to

come out and have fun. which they
clearly did."
Co-chair Taurean Brown, a senior,
said, " This is my third time being in
volved with this event and even
though 1 knew what to expect, it's
something I still find very entertain
ing, especially after a long week of
midterms. Participants get an all-ex
penses-paid date and possibly meet a
new friend and maybe make a love
connection."
Fregia noted that AKA's Dating
Game falls under the sorority's na
tional goal of promoting healthy rela
tionships.
The winning couples received gift
certificates donated by nearby Ce
cila's Mexican restaurant, California
Pizza Kitchen, Nola Restaurant and
Bar and Pasta? fora romantic dinner
date. Other participants had the op
portunity to meet someone special
during the mixing and mingling party
held before and after the show.
"A lot of people may think our
programming is only for the Black stu
dent population, but it is really cater
ing to the entire Stanford communi
ty," Brown said. AKA is one of Stan
ford's black-interest sororities.
The Dating Game is one of the
highlights of AKA's programming
week. Today, the Greek group is or
ganizing a barbeque at the Caravan
1 louse, a residential group home for
at-risk teenage girls. A discussion
about the history and achievements
of black women is planned for this
Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in Tresidder
Union.
