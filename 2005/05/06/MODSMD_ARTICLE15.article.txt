"I owe this all to my parents, because they
encouraged me to dream - and on Wednes
day. I dreamed the dream," said sophomore
Mike Garcia.
"I told my mom the news on the phone,
and she said it was the happiest day of her
life." sophomore Joaquin Chapa said.
No, these guys aren't referring to winning
a prestigious scholarship or scoring a sweet
summer job. Rather, Garcia, Chapa and four
of their classmates — Kevin Bickham. Rus
sell Brown, Lauren Jesperson and Forrest
Tahdooahnippah — are celebrating being

number one — in the housing Draw.
"I don't really think it's about luck,"
Chapa said. "It's about skill, merit and looks.
I'm planning to put it on my resume."
Brown agreed, stating confidently that he
is "not even writing a resume anymore."
The sophomores, who are all on the track
and field team, said that they are not at all sur
prised by their draw results.
"1 was calling top three from the begin
ning," Tahdooahnippah said.
All hut Garcia, who lives in Sigma Nu this
year, drew together last year as well and re
ceived a 471, which got them into Suites.
Brown said that while fliey were happy at
the time, number "471 just wasn't really what

we're all about."
Last night, the guys scoured campus to
check out their housing options for next year.
Although they visited Boh and Xanadu right
away, they said they will probably not list ei
ther among their first choices. The guys said
they like the houses, but fear that they will
fare poorly in the in-house draw.
"We feel like in-house draw doesn't re
spect number one," Tahdooahnippah said.
"Also, number one has been slightly disap
pointing. We heard all of the houses would
wine and dine us to try to get us to choose
their house."
This special treatment has yet to occur.
The guys said they are going to check out

Jerry next, hut emphasized the faet that they
are thinking about rejecting their housing al
together if Jerry does not "come through big
time."
"We want something that would be too
good for number two." Tahdooahnippah said.
Bickham and the group is on a mission to
scheme up better options.
"Stanford should build us a house—just
number ones." Garcia said.
Wherever they end up. the six sophomores
will likely remember this year's Draw as their
claim to fame for quite awhile.
"Klamath Falls. Oregon — my hometown
— is having a parade to honor us tomorrow."
Jesperson said.
