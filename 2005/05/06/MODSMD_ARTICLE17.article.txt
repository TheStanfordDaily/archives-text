## West campus is socially vibrant, I swear 
### 
Stanford has been fraught with its fair
share of divisions. But there is one deep
seated, historical feud that has consumed all
of campus, one that is akin to age-old rival
ries such as the battles between the Mon
tagues and the Capulets, the North and the
South, and Zack Morris and A.C. Slater be
fore they became friends.
And that, my friends, is the feud between
east campus and west campus.
The problem with this feud, though, is

that neither side knows
the other exists. Or
rather, no one knows that
west campus exists.
The divide between
east and west campus
shouldn't be surprising
when you consider that
the concept of dorm ri
valry was ingrained in us
from the beginning.

Remember Orientation? And all those
cheers we had to learn, with the flags and the
marching? Or the all-class assemblies in
MemAud where dorms competed to out
cheer each other, which usually amounted to
"Branner Sucks" and "No, it doesn't?"
We were groomed from the beginning to
hate each other. And that was pretty cool. 1
suppose it was relatively fun and exciting to
walk 20 minutes all the way out to MemAud.
marching in unison with our dorm, singing
hate songs and dorm-pride cheers relent
lessly (even though we had pretty much no
idea what Branner was and why it sucked so
much). Those were good times. It's nice to
engage in a little healthy dorm rivalry, com
plete with jeering and taunting.
But it's somewhat difficult to do when
most people have never heard of your dorm.
With east campus dorms and west cam
pus dorms situated on opposite ends of cam
pus, there is little interaction between the
two. The farthest east campus kids have
trekked is probably to some Row house such
as Xanadu, and the farthest east most west
campus kids have traveled is probably to.
well, Xanadu.
This geographic distance has fostered
many misconceived notions about the other
half of campus, especially the west half.
To most people, east campus is the life
and center of social activity while west cam
pus is some amorphous entity that is defined
more often as "not east campus" than any
thing in its own right.
Which makes it impossible to tell people
where I live.
"I'm from Adelfa."
Awkward silence.
"That's in West Lag."
More awkward silence, this time with a
quizzical look.
"Next to Roble."
Finally: "Oh. That's like way off the other
side, right?"
Why doesn't anybody know where west
campus is? I mean, it's called "west cam
pus." It is situated on the west end of cam
pus.
Not to mention the gross stereotypes
about west-side kids.
Most people think west campus is far
away from everything, but in reality it's just
as close to the Quad as east campus. FroSo-
Co, I'll admit, is pretty far away, which is
why I disown it and do not include it in my
discussion of west campus dorms. And
FroSoCo is just weird.
But anyway, just because most west cam
pus dorms are four-class doesn't make us
any more "tame" or "uncool." You guys can
have your "Disturßank" parties (held by
Burbank — and come on, who the hell
knows where that is?) all you want, but we
still have an incredibly vibrant social scene.
When we're not at the Row, we're known to
have some crazy wild games of Boggle and
Disney Princess Uno — and that's only on
Friday nights.
And no, contrary to popular belief. West
Lag is not for retired people, er, seniors.
And personally, I hate east campus. The
dorms all look like sterilized hospitals with
their long white hallways, with the exception
perhaps of Manzanita or Branner. But Man
zanita is deathly silent and Branner sucks.
Yet this is a hatred I'm willing to put aside
for the sake of unity. Or maybe not so much
unity as recognition that west campus exists.
You may have larger rooms, wider food
selections and a more active social scene,
but, as we once stressed repeatedly during
Orientation, we have better Late Nite. And
also pride. Plus, our dining halls aren't that
bad. The Lagunita Dining Hall is actually
rather pretty when you consider the archi
tecture.
And we might not have a lot of parties
but we're a lot closer to the Row. And to
Jamba Juice. You can't really top that lethal
combination of a Friday night at Sigma Nu
and a tropical tango smoothie with a free
"Femme boost", followed by an intense
game of Boggle.
So give west campus a little more respect.
At least we're not as far away as FroSoCo.

If you are upset by the portrayal of your dorm
in this column, there's not much you can do,
