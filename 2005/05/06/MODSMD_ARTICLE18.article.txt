# Tas – Friends not foes

### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
They grade your papers and
problem sets. They spam you
with e-mail. They talk to you
about the importance of Henry
Stimson's atomic bomb theory.
They are the teaching assis
tants, or TAs, you come to know
and love — or dislike.
While the professors provide
the core concepts and facts of
their courses, TAs often lead sec
tions, hold review sessions and
meet with students during office
hours. TAs are often responsible
for creating problems sets and
paper topics and then grading
students' work. TAs benefit stu
dents who are taking the courses
by providing a more accessible
means of receiving course infor
mation. TAs also receive finan
cial benefits and the opportunity
to work closely with professors.
Some, like Katherine
Kuchenbecker, a TAin mechan
ical engineering, do it simply be
cause they want the experience
of leading a class and hope that it
will set the stage for their future
career plans.
"It is a really incredible
chance to teach," said Kuchen
becker, who eventually wants to
become a professor. "When 1
was thinking about going to grad
schools, one thing that really im
pacted my choice was that I
knew grad students here got to
be teaching assistants in a num
ber of classes if they wanted to."
Kuchenbecker, who is now
completing her fifth year in the
mechanical engineering pro
gram, knew that she wanted to
become a TA since her freshman
year at Stanford back in 1996.
"I really wanted to assist in
the product realization lab,"
Kuchenbecker said. "It's a ma
chine shop, and when I was an
undergrad engineer, the TAs in
that lab were the coolest people
in the world. I was lucky enough

to TA there for my first six quar
ters in the graduate program."
Some departments require
their graduate students to be
come TAs. In the History De
partment, it is a requirement for
students in the Ph.D. program to
serve as TAs for at least three
quarters.
"Part of the fellowship pack
age in the History Department is
that we get funded for five
years," said Natalia Mehlman, a
graduate student and a TAin the
History Department. "And a
condition of that fellowship is to
serve as a TA for three or four
quarters. You are guaranteed
one class in your field, but in
evitably it ends up that a lot peo
ple are TAs for the '20th Centu
ry U.S.' course who are from Eu
ropean or Medieval history
[backgrounds]."
But not all TAs are graduate
students. While certain depart
ments such as the history and
mechanical engineering employ
only graduate students, other de
partments prefer to use under
grads. Many professors in the
Computer Science Department
feel that students grasp the infor
mation more easily when taught
by an undergraduate TA.
"Professor Eric Roberts did a
study that when you have under
graduate section leaders, the stu
dents end up learning more,"
said sophomore Peter Pawlows
ki, a TA for the Computer Sci
ence Department, who first
taught as a freshman last spring.
"If you're taught by students
who learned the material only
two years ago you tend to absorb
more than you would by stu
dents who learned it six years
ago."
But there are more than just
intellectual bonuses to using un
dergraduate TAs — about one
fourth the cost of a graduate TA.
