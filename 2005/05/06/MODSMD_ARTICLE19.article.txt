## 
### LORI SIMPSON DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN 
(U-WIRE) OXFORD. Miss. —The name
Avior might not be well-known today, hut
10 to 15 years from now it could be one of
the hottest clothing companies for
teenagers.
Avior (pronounced 'savior' without the s)
first formed in the mind of Adrian Dickey. 23.
a University of Mississippisenior graphic de
sign and marketing major from Tupelo, Miss.,
last year when he became interested in graph
ic design.
Dickey was also inspired by extreme
sports, such as skateboarding and surfing.
"I started getting involved in extreme
sports when I began hanging out with friends
from Pensacola," he said.
He also plans on designing clothes in ac
cordance to the style of those who participate

in extreme sports. 1 le hopes to target kids who
listen to hardcore, screamo bands such as Un
deroath.
"1 wanted to develop a clothing company
which had something to do with that scene —
I wanted something which represented
them," he said.
Before he had a name for the company. Dick
ey had already designed the logo for Avior —
a star with a cross going through it.
"The brightest star in the sky right now is
named Avior," he said. "(The logo) has a spir
itual side, as well, and it all just sort of
clicked."
Dickey first began designing the logo in
Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator programs at
his house, sometimes staying up until 2 or 3
a.m. working.
Dickey then approached graphic designer
/ screenprinter / filmmaker Matt Wymer,
who was in one of his design classes, about

printing the first batch of shirts.
Things worked out well for both, and it was
cheaper for them in the long-run. The first
shirts are black with the silver logo and com
pany name.
"Right now, I am just selling shirts out of
my car," Dickey said. "And as funny as it may
sound, a lot of my first sales have come from
thefacebook.com"
As of Tuesday, Hot Dog Records on the
Square will be selling the shirts, as well.
He also hopes in the near future to set up a
Myspace account and Web site for the com
pany, and he is currently in search of a Web
site designer.
Dickey's friends have been supportive of
his latest project.
"My friends are helping me come up with
new ideas, and my parents have started to be
supportive about it,"he said.
Jace Granberry, a freshman graphic design

major from Franklin, Tenn., has been a driv
ing force in aiding Dickey with the company.
As for the future. Dickey hopes to attend
Savannah College of Art and Design to get his
master's degree in art after graduating next
May.
"And after that, I want to live on the coast
somewhere — California or Florida," he said.
He hopes to expand his company to offer
shirts for boys and girls, polo shirts, hats, de
cals, stickers, shoes and jeans.
Dickey also hopes to sponsor skaters,
surfers and wakeboarders in the future.
He currently sponsors two Ole Miss wake
boarders, Matt Clendenian and Leif Lacey.
Lacey has also been a part of the wakeboard
ing pro-tour.
He plans on sponsoring bands under the
"hardcore, screamo" category.
"To sponsor a band like Underoath would
be awesome," he said.
