# Cal defies expectations with steady pitching and small ball strategy
## Stanford takes on rival Bears 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
From the start of the season, the Cal
ifornia baseball squad (29-20, 9-9 Pacif
ic* 10 Conference) looked far from
fierce on paper. Ten players departed in
the offseason, including the team's lead
ing offensive threat. The pitching staff
had the label "inexperienced" stapled
all over it. The team's starting lineup
was anything but fixed. Pundits chalked
California up as a warmup for stronger,
more experienced, postseason-bound
Pac-10 opponents.
This weekend, the No. 24 Cardinal
(26-15, 7-5) will head to Berkeley's
Evans Field to face a Golden Bears
team that has distanced itself from its
on-paper identity and become a three
dimensional. though still not terribly ex

perienced, conference threat.
Though the Bears are behind Stan
ford in the Pac-10 standings, Cal has a
better record than the Cardinal has
against top 25 teams. And while Stan
ford has its powerhouse reputation to
prop up its postseason expectations, Cal
must find the playoffs with a roster full
of athletes that have never been there
before. (California's last NCAA Tour
nament berth was in 2001.)
The Golden Bears are getting by on
hunger, making every Pac-10 series a
must-win.
Even now that California has earned
its way out of Pac-10 basement and is
playing above expectations, the team is
not overwhelming. Crafty is more like it.
The Bears are arguably the best small
ball squad in the conference, successful
ly laying down a league-leading 62 sacri

lice bunts this season. Washington is
second in the Pac-10 in that category
with 37 hunts.
It's an offensive strategy that has
served the Bears well and notably so in
Cal's 10-4 win over Stanford last month,
in which Travis Howell (California's
.190-hitting backup catcher) laid down
three sacrifice bunts.
Cardinal pitcher Jeff Gilmore has
said that getting out the leadoff man is a
crucial part of giving Stanford a chance
to win, and that strategy will be all the
more important this weekend against
the Bears.
Gilmore. a junior, will lake the
mound this afternoon against Cal ace
righthander Adam Gold, who was lit up
for four earned runs in less than two in-
