# Queer Formal celebrates community's diversity

"Imagine being invisible on a prestigious, elite
university campus," said a coordinator of tomor
row night's Queer Formal. "Imagine having to be
conscious of safe and non-safe spaces at all times.
This is what it is to be queer. This formal is a rare
opportunity where queer people can breathe
freely."
The formal, themed "Mix and Match," starts at
10 p.m. and will be Stanford's first. Universities
around the nation have been holding similar
events in recent years and Stanford committee
members — sophomore Galen Panger, senior
Howard Shen and another student, who asked to
remain anonymous for safety reasons — said they
felt that it was about time the tradition be brought
to Stanford.

"This is a conservative campus," the anony
mous member said. "It might as well be thousands
of miles away from San Francisco. Simple forms
of expression are not a privilege afforded to queer
people in settings like this. But this dance pro
vides safe queer space."
The dance will be hosted at the Elliot Pro
gramming Center in Governor's Corner, and ads
posted throughout campus boast a night of dance,
dessert and, most importantly, dignity. Although
well-known DJ Trey of San Francisco's G-Bar
will be present, the event's significance should not
be overshadowed by mere pomp and circum
stance, members of the planning committee said.
"We wanted an event that would celebrate the
normalcy of being queer, homosexual, bi, etc. and
acknowledge the beauty of gay relationships,"
Panger said. "Not everyone who is coming to the
formal is going to be queer or in a relationship, but

I think everyone who will come doesn't like to see
the love between two queer people be marginal
ized by society."
For many who attend, the dance will give them
a chance the relive high school experiences they
might have missed.
"We also wanted to have an event for everyone
who has ever felt left out of prom or a formal
dance because of their sexual orientation,"
Panger added. "Prom, especially in high school, is
such a tradition-laden event, and most of those
traditions have a distinct heterosexual flavor. It
can be a stigmatizing event for queers, and we
wanted to reach back out to those students with
this event."
Those who attend the formal should expect a
healthy display of balloons and flower and deco
rations meant to reflect the diversity of the queer
community, Panger said.
