## Editorial Republicans close to tyranny of the majority 
### 
Recently, certain Senate Republicans
have classified their Democratic counter
parts' attempts to filibuster some of Presi
dent George W. Bush's judicial nominees
as antireligious. This claim, which explicit
ly ties politics to religion, is both ludicrous
and frightening.
So far this year. Bush has nominated
seven judges to fill vacancies on various
U.S. appeals courts. Many Democrats
see the nominees as ultra-conservative
ideologues whose views on social issues
such as abortion, homosexuality, affir
mative action and the environment lie
too far outside the mainstream and
whose appointments would represent a
serious step backwards from the
progress of past decades. As such, they
plan to filibuster a! 1 seven, a decision that
prompted Republicans to draft a bill that
would make it impossible to filibuster ju
dicial nominees.
Under the current system, it takes only
a simple majority, or 51 senators, to con
firm a judicial nominee, but 60 votes are
needed to end a filibuster and bring the
nomination to a vote. Republicans claim
that the judicial system should run
smoothly, unimpeded by partisan politics,
and the proposed bill would therefore
make it impossible for dissenting senators
to filibuster judicial nominees.
This issue has markedly increased the
already sharp divide between the two par
ties and has particular relevance with po
tential vacancies on the Supreme Court
bench on the horizon. Politicians predict
that at least one Supreme Court justice
will retire before the end of Bush's presi
dency — the oldest justice, the liberal
John Paul Stevens, is K5 — and the current
filibuster fight holds great significance on
that front.
Democrats worry that if the bill passes,
Bush will use the Republican majority in
the Senate to nominate a social conserva
tive who will decisively tip the balance of
the Supreme Court to the right. Republi
cans worry that if the option to filibuster
judicial nominees is kept intact. Bush will
be forced to pick a candidate who does not
oppose the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision, which legalized abortion.
In trying to gain support for their pro
posed bill. Senate Republicans, including
Majority Leader Bill Frist, have spoken to
various religious groups. At these rallies,
talk about the filibuster issue has turned

religious and leaders have called
Democrats' attempts to filibuster Bush's
nominees "judicial tyranny to people of
faith."
This overt fusion of church and state is
troubling. One of the most significant —
and still contested — parts of our constitu
tion is the vital importance of a distinct
separation of church and state. Using reli
gion to justify the elimination of filibusters
on judicial nominees, Senate Republicans
have effectively done away with this es
sential separation. How can Republicans
— who are, when it suits them, notorious
ly strict interpreters of the Constitution —
completely ignore one of the most impor
tant parts of that document?
Politics and religion simply should not
mix. While politicians must respect people
of faith, using religious beliefs to rational
ize a political decision is both unconvinc
ing and highly subjective. Calling a group
— especially one as large and diverse as
the Democratic Party — antireligious is a
groundless claim that has little basis in po
litical truth. The idea that Republicans ap
preciate religion more than Democrats is
preposterous. Republicans are no more
devout than Democrats; they just tend to
rely on — and whine about — religion
more than their liberal colleagues.
Moreover, the idea that judicial fili
busters are antireligious is completely il
logical. Just because Democrats do not ap
prove of some of Bush's more radical
nominees does not mean they are raging
atheists, and this editorial board is having
trouble recalling the exact passage of The
Bible that mentions filibusters.
This new hot-button political issue rais
es another important question: Are we
spiraling into the exact kind of "tyranny of
the majority" that —as all good A.P. U.S.
History students know — James Madison
specifically warned about in Federalist
No. 10? Both the executive and legislative
branches are strongly on the Republican
side of the fence, and if the proposed bill
eliminating filibusters against judicial
nominees passes, it is highly likely that the
relatively balanced judiciary will join
them. This is a scary thought, and one that
would inevitably jeopardize many of the
liberties we take for granted. As such. Re
publicans need to recognize the distinc
tion between politics and religion and use
it to keep political issues separate from re
ligious ones at all costs.
