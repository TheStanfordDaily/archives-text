## Sperm donation on the straight and narrow 
### 
I'm going to try to he
as pragmatic and objec
tive ahout this as is hu
manly possible. The
Food and Drug Admin
istration, or FDA. will
shortly implement new
regulations advising
American sperm banks
to reject all men who
have engaged in honio-

sexual intercourse in the past five years.
Their rationale is that, on average, gay men
have a greater likelihood of carrying the
AIDS virus. This is absolutely true. Statisti
cally, young inner-city men in certain ethnic
and racial groups are more likely to steal
cars and deal drugs. This does not make
racial-profiling acceptable.
The truth of the matter is that discrimi
nation, in law and order or gamete dona
tion, is practical. It increases efficiency and
lowers the risk of the guilty roaming the
streets and HIV-carrying sperm entering
circulation. But last time I checked, this so
ciety values equality and liberty over effi
ciency.
In the case of sperm donation, however,
such discrimination can theoretically save
lives by preventing the use of infectious ga
metes. This is precisely why there is donor
and donation screening. This screening in
cludes an almost-endless barrage of ques
tions concerning everything from sexual
history, to familial medical history (going
far beyond the nuclear family), to pheno
typic traits. In addition to this inquisition is
both a preliminary offering to determine
sperm count / motility and a fully analyzed
blood test.
Earlier this year, a bunch of guys from
my dorm, enticed by the $9(X)-per-month
self-pleasuring deal, decided to give the
sperm banks a try. Only one of my friends is
still in the running (or swimming). Even
after this rigorous process of elimination,
the donations (the euphemism of the year)
undergo a six-month freezing cycle, tested

before and after for any trace of HIV /
AIDS, along with a host of genetic diseases.
This process all but eradicates any chance
of transfusion.
Moreover, if the major concern here is,
in fact, accidental infection, then homosex
ual men should not be the only group tar
geted. Heterosexual African-American
women are presently the division of the
population with the fastest growing number
of new infections per year. Clearly,
African-American women don't factor into
the sperm-donation equation, but this
statistic is indicative of a general trend in
America — and the world, for that matter:
HIV/AIDS is no longer a phenomenon
limited to the gay community, it is a catas
trophe that we all face.
It would seem that a more effective and
morally appropriate method of decreasing
the risk of transfusion would be monitoring
and accepting donor applicants based more
restrictively on sexual behavior, not sexual
orientation. When this FDA "recommen
dation" is adopted, even gay men who have
practiced safe-sex with a single partner in a
monogamous relationship for the past five
years will be denied — straight men who
lead far more promiscuous lifestyles won't
be subject to the same restrictions.
Ultimately, this new discrimination
against gay men would appear to be an ex
ample of homophobia infecting yet anoth
er arena. In the guise of AIDS-prevention,
government will henceforth control for
the "disorder" of homosexuality, much
like Tay-Sachs, sickle cell and cystic fibro
sis. And that's if a gene for homosexuality
even exists — which has not been proven.
And if such a gene is eventually isolated,
who is to say that homosexuality is a nega
tive "trait" to inherit? The FDA's most re
cent action seems to be a modern-day stab
at eugenics — one in which society stands
to lose a lot.
