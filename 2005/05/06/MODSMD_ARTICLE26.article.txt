## There's No Place Like Stanford'?: Notes from the Exceptionalist University 
### 
Admit weekend is the
rare occurrence whose
events will impassion to a
small group of 17 year
olds hut almost in
evitably tiresome to ev
eryone else. So it was
with some hesitation that
this 22 year old decided,
in order to spend time
with a first-year friend, to
attend last Friday's a cap-

pella showcase for prospective students.
Everything that one expects in any uni
versity's admit weekend was there: the
cheerleading, the sentimentality, the awk
ward marriage of publicity and education.
One a cappella group prefaced its set with
a series of skits caricaturing the luckless sub
jects of peer universities: the fidgety science
majors at MIT. the sexist snobs at Harvard
and the Yalies, cowering after supposed gun
fire in New Haven. Though that final joke
seemed to me to demonstrate exceptionally
poor taste on the part of Mixed Company,
the theme of a unique Stanford was what
came across most clearly.
These supposed distinctions were brought
to fuller light with the structure of the evening's
program, where the diverse a cappella line-up
was interlarded with appearances by campus
sports figures and religious leaders. Through
out the night, I heard the note of an "excep
tional Stanford" whose distinction from other
schools lies in our considerably more athletic,
polymathic and cool student body.
1 am hardly fit to judge college athletics or
well-roundedness, and still less our claims to

be cool. But after three years here, I do feel
safe concluding that exceptionalism is both a
deep-running Stanford narrative — and a
misleading one.
" There's no place like Stanford," I once
read on a T-shirt, and the phrase embodies a
feeling among undergraduates that extends
beyond admit weekends and orientations.
Few late-night bull sessions, for example, pass
without someone addressing the issue at hand
by saying, "At Stanford, we ..." or "Stanford
wants us to be ... " or some variant thereof.
When noting affiliations, one will rarely
lump oneself in with the "students of elite
universities," the "privileged educated class"
or even residents of Santa Clara County or
California. We are a self-referential lot, and
the reference is nearly always Stanford.
But repetition does not imply accuracy. If
countless students can tell of how "unique"
Stanford seemed upon their initial visits, then
countless others have friends at other schools,
wish to apply elsewhere for graduate pro
grams or generally think of their college expe
rience as something larger than Stanford.
Further, recruiting faculty from else
where may demonstrate the appeal of Stan
ford. but so too docs it illuminate the cross
fertilization of the American university sys
tem. And when Stanford loses a faculty
member or even lends one out fora year's
fellowship, our claims to exceptionalism are
ever more vitiated.
Among the many connotations of excep
tionalism is the notion that we have been cre
ated and guided separate from outside influ
ences. This is at least one of the meanings of
the "Stanford bubble," which has become

the cliche of our generation mostly because it
is accurate.
But the cliche — or the "bubble" — has
its own masking effects. For while the "bub
ble" explains the club-like remove of the
University, it says nothing about the vexed
history of land use and economic develop
ment between Stanford and Palo Alto. Or,
for that matter, between the University and
all of the Bay Area.
What's more, the federal government's
vast Cold War investment in Stanford's sci
ence and technology testifies to the fact that
we did not develop in a "bubble," as do the
2003 changes in the alcohol policy — which
were owed, in part, to an effort to conform to
nationwide university standards.
1 mention the nation and the federal gov
ernment because exceptionalism is a species
of thought especially prevalent in the United
States. It is no surprise, then, that 1 have
often heard Stanford referred to as "the first
American university." That scholars have
gone about debunking "American excep
tionalism" should be borne in mind when we
consider Stanford.
After all, to say that Stanford differs from
its peer institutions is to speak a basic truth of
American universities. Harvard is unlike
Stanford; Stanford is not Wayne State Uni
versity. But to say or imply that we are ex
ceptional is to promote an intriguing idea
that nonetheless cannot be sustained.
