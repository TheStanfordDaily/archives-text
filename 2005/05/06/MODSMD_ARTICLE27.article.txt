## Returning RAs not a problem 
### KYLE BRUCK STEPHANIE SUD 
While there are many inadequacies in the
staff selection process, resident assistant re
applicants and re-appointees are not a signif
icant problem. The Daily's editorial "Re
turning ResEd staff process needs to be
reevaluated" (May 4) exaggerated the
amount of RAs who return: of the 174 RAs
hired this year, there are 27 returning RAs,
and of those 12 are reappointed.
Reappointment means that the resident
fellow, or RF, allows their RAs to return to
their same dorm without having to go
through the interview process again. It is the
RF or supervisor's decision as to whether or
not an RA should be reappointed to their
dorm. Most RFs are very involved in their re
spective dorms and know whether or not
their RA should be reappointed. In the re
cent past there have been RFs who have cho
sen not to reappoint their R A.and there have
been RAs who reapplied and did not receive
positions. Granted, the Row only has a su
pervisor who may not know enough about
their RAs to make an informed decision, but
none of the returning Row RAs were reap

pointed this year. AU of the returning (but
not re-appointed) RAs had to go through the
application and interview process.
Reappointed RAs are a boon for the
dorms they live in. They already have a sense
of community and are familiar with the dorm
and its traditions. They also have a year's
worth of experience, which is the best kind of
training. Additionally, the RF knows exactly
how that staff member interacts with the
dorm and can choose co-staff to match his or
her personality and make a cohesive group.
The editorial also complained about nepo
tism inherent in choosing current residents to
become RAs. We would like to point out that
there is a significant difference between
choosing one's friends and choosing a "known
entity." While the Row process is different be
cause they can almost choose their friends
without supervision; in the dorm process the
RF makes the final decision. RFs strive to
choose a staff that not only work well together
but also is diverse enough to appeal to differ
ent residents in the dorm. In selecting our
staff, we had a total of 60 interviews and know
ing a candidate's personality beforehand can
