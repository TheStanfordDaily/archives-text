## Returning RAs not a problem 
### KYLE BRUCK STEPHANIE SUD 
While there are many inadequacies in the
staff selection process, resident assistant re
applicants and re-appointees are not a signif
icant problem. The Daily's editorial "Re
turning ResEd staff process needs to be
reevaluated" (May 4) exaggerated the
amount of RAs who return: of the 174 RAs
hired this year, there are 27 returning RAs,
and of those 12 are reappointed.
Reappointment means that the resident
fellow, or RF, allows their RAs to return to
their same dorm without having to go
through the interview process again. It is the
RF or supervisor's decision as to whether or
not an RA should be reappointed to their
dorm. Most RFs are very involved in their re
spective dorms and know whether or not
their RA should be reappointed. In the re
cent past there have been RFs who have cho
sen not to reappoint their R A.and there have
been RAs who reapplied and did not receive
positions. Granted, the Row only has a su
pervisor who may not know enough about
their RAs to make an informed decision, but
none of the returning Row RAs were reap

pointed this year. AU of the returning (but
not re-appointed) RAs had to go through the
application and interview process.
Reappointed RAs are a boon for the
dorms they live in. They already have a sense
of community and are familiar with the dorm
and its traditions. They also have a year's
worth of experience, which is the best kind of
training. Additionally, the RF knows exactly
how that staff member interacts with the
dorm and can choose co-staff to match his or
her personality and make a cohesive group.
The editorial also complained about nepo
tism inherent in choosing current residents to
become RAs. We would like to point out that
there is a significant difference between
choosing one's friends and choosing a "known
entity." While the Row process is different be
cause they can almost choose their friends
without supervision; in the dorm process the
RF makes the final decision. RFs strive to
choose a staff that not only work well together
but also is diverse enough to appeal to differ
ent residents in the dorm. In selecting our
staff, we had a total of 60 interviews and know
ing a candidate's personality beforehand can
streamline the process. We can ask known
candidates more direct questions and make
more informed decisions about their role on
staff.
We freely admit that the current applica
tion and interview process can be unfair be
cause applicants can misrepresent themselves.
Also, good applicants can slip through the
cracks if they had a bad interview. However,
this reasoning only serves to show how know
ing an applicant beforehand can be beneficial.
Known applicants cannot fake the interview
and appear stronger than they actually are. A
bad interview does not matter as much be
cause a staff, who know the applicant, can pre
vent applicants from slipping through the
cracks.
There are indeed problems with the cur
rent staff evaluation system, most significant

ly that it is part of a "criminally lengthy"
housing survey that many students deem too
long to bother with. However, Residential
Education offers many incentives to get par
ticipation rates up. The house in which we
live had a 70 percent survey response rate this
year, and both us and our RF read every
word and took what was said to heart.
Before an RA decides to come back fora
second year. Josh Schiller (the assistant direc
tor of residential education) meets with us to
talk about what it means to return. He en
courages us to think about our motivations
for coming back, what we would hope to get
out of a second year, and how we would pre
vent ourselves from burning out. We then
have discussions with our RFs, and if we each
still think reappointment is a good idea from
a personal and community standpoint, the RF
can approve it. No one knows better the in
credible commitment needed to be an RA
than someone who has done it before, and
thus no RA makes the decision to return
lightly.
The staff selection process could certainly

be better, but re-applicants and re-ap
pointees should not be the focus of the effort
to improve it. It is our belief that the area on
which to concentrate is Row staff selection.
Because of the lower level of supervision,
nepotism and generally unfair processes are
more likely to occur. Also, RAs are chosen
by the new house staff, which usually does
not have experience running a house and
thus is less likely to know what to look for in
a good RA. So while we recognize that the
selection process could be improved, fairness
in the re-hiring of 15 and the re-appointment
of another 12 RAs pales in comparison to the
larger problems of lack of supervision, a lack
of candor during the interview process and
poor interviewing.
