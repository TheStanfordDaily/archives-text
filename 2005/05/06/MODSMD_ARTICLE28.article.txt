Undergraduates will not strain
Cardinal Care
I am writing to correct a statement at
tribute to me in the article on the Graduate
Student Council and health care ("GSC
evaluates grad student health care," May
5). Nowhere in my presentation to the GSC
did I state (or intend to imply) that under
graduates will place a greater strain on the
Cardinal Care system, and that this would
negatively affect graduate health care.
More undergraduates on Cardinal Care
will not strain Cardinal Care nor will more
undergraduates on the plan negatively af
fect grad students. Rather, I stressed the
fact that right now Cardinal Care coverage
is not an issue that affects a lot of under
graduates, but that in the future this would
become an issue for undergrads.
It is the hope of the Graduate Health
Care task force that the undergraduate
community will be proactive and work with
the graduate community on this issue. Fur
thermore, 1 would like to state that while
Stanford Hospital is one of the more costly
hospitals in the region, the Stanford Hospi
tal has always worked with Vaden and Car
dinal Care to give generous discounts to stu
dents who are treated at Stanford Hospital
in order to keep the Hospital accessible to
students at Stanford.
Unfortunately, despite the many admin
istrators and students working on contain
ing the cost of our health care plan, students
at Stanford are feeling the effects of health
care market in which treatment, and the
technology used in treatment, is getting
more and more expensive. The delivery of
health care in the United States is an issue
that all students at Stanford, and all Ameri
cans, should be concerned about.
