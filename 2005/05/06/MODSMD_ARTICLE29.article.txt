# Course readers abandoned for Web
## 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Students often complain about the prices of text
books and weighty course readers. Turns out profes
sors have been listening. More and more faculty mem
bers are choosing to post material online to save their
students sky-high course reader costs.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein has long been con
cerned about steep hikes in course reader prices and fi
nally decided to call up the publishers to get the scoop.
"One of my readers went up from $29 to $42 dollars
in just one year," he said. "That's a 30 to 40 percent in
crease in price for over a hundred of my students. 1
found out that it was due to a change in publishing
companies to Custom Publishing, which is a branch of
the University of Southern California."
With the switch. Bernstein said he believes many of
the written authorization from authors to provide free
copies of their material for educational purpose was
lost, which allows USC's Custom Publishing to charge
royalties unnecessarily.
Custom Publishing Manager David Akwimbi said
the price increase is misconceived as a blatant
markup.
"While we are under the umbrella of USC, the
higher prices are not because of that," he said.

"Rather, they reflect the mistakes the previous com
pany was making. They didn't realize that only a very
small amount of authorizations carry over to the next
year — most only last for one quarter."
Bernstein said that while Custom Publishing asked
him to show copies of the authors' written consent to
the lower prices, this was an unreasonable expectation.
"The permissions wer'e supposed to be scanned
into their system," Bernstein said. "Of course I didn't
have a copy of them from four years ago."
In response to the spike in course reader costs,
many professors now post much of their course ma
terial online. Launched in the fall of 2001, Stanford's
Course Work Web site has become the primary al
ternative to bulky and expensive course readers.
A recent article in The Wall Street Journal, which
examined this new trend at universities including
Stanford, explained that online materials are the re
sult of a "clash between professors and publishers
over copyrights," suggesting that Stanford faculty
members often post material with no regard for copy
right law.
However, Senior University Counsel Lauren
Schoenthaler said that this claim is not true and that
Stanford takes careful steps to comply with copyright
regulations.
"It can absolutely be okay to put
material on Course Work and elec
tronic course readers are absolutely
a good thing if done legally,"
Schoenthaler said. "There's a whole
host of materials already available
on the Web and Course Work is just
a way to point students to it."
Students and professors approve
of the convenience and low-cost on
line approach, but they agree there
are drawbacks.

While The Stanford Bookstore
and other companies that make
course readers manage the neces
sary payments for copyrights and
royalties themselves, Course Work
does not currently have such a fea
ture. The site's staff is currently
working to install one.
"Right now professors have to
get permission themselves,"
Schoenthaler said. "Before next
fall, we are working on putting up
links to the copyright clearance
center. Over the summer we will
figure out the best way to stream
line getting permissions."
Students who have taken classes
that depend on Course Work as an
alternative to course readers said

they have mixed feelings. While
many said they enjoyed the lower
costs, others said the online format
sometimes cuts into their learning.
"1 think I read about the same
amount, but 1 like to have some
thing on paper to look at." said
freshman Sam Shrank. "1 don't
want to print the material out. so
I'm sort of less prepared for class."
Freshman Nayantara Kothari
agreed with Shrank.
"It's nice knowing we don't
have to buy a course reader, but it's
difficult to read stuff online — I
get headaches," she said. "I never
print out stuff that's online. I feel
like it defeats the purpose of it
being online."
