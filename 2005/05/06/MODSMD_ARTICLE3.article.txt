# Softball ends season with six-game homestand
## Card face Pac-10 leader OSU 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's softball team
(37-11, 10-5 Pacific-10 Conference) has
played at home twice in its last 13 games.
Now that their 2005 regular-season road
schedule has finished, the No. 4 Cardinal
have good reason to look forward to get
ting some well-deserved rest from travel
with a six-game homestand before
NCAAs. Add to that a 19-4 record in
games at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Sta
dium and, yes, it's good to be home.
"We all love being at home," senior
Megan Sickler said. "It's way easier. It's fun
traveling with the team, but having a crowd
here is way better and less stressful."
There's also something unique about
playing at Stanford's stadium, tucked in
between the rugby, baseball and field
hockey fields. For the Stanford players, it
really captures a sense of home.
"Personally for me, I love the view of
Hoover Tower," said freshman Erin
Howe. "It's really weird but we go to a lot

of schools and we never get to see their
campus from the Softball field. 1 love how
our field is set up, how you can kind of get
to see the sights of campus at the same
time. Just to play at home and have this
whole Stanford atmosphere â€” you can't
heat that."
Howe, who collected five RBI last
weekend in Los Angeles, is hoping to see
the stadium filled with more fans than
usual this weekend with hefty competition
in the form of No. 7 Oregon State (38-10,
11-4) in town. While the turnout may not
be quite as large as it was for the California
series, tomorrow and Sunday's afternoon
tilts could prove equally exciting.
"Oregon State isn't really a team to get
much hype, but if people knew that they
were No. 1 in the Pac-10, then maybe peo
ple would come out," Howe said.
Fans might get the chance to see the
Cardinal, who are second in the confer
ence, topple the Beavers. Beating Oregon
State is key to improving last year's sec
ond-place conference finish.
"If we beat them twice we would move

up to first," said Sickler, who hit a game
tying homerun last Sunday to beat UCLA.
"It's actually a really big deal for us to win
against Oregon State."
Winning the Pac-10 Championship
would be a boost fora Cardinal team in
search of another Women's College World
Series appearance.
"It would be huge to go again," Sickler
said. "It would definitely be the best soft
ball experience ever."
In comparing this season's squad to last
season's, the possibility of a repeat show
ing isn't all that far fetched. The offense
looks better this year, Sickler said, and the
basic team structure is still the same. The
hole left by Ail-American pitcher Dana
Sorensen was filled by junior Laura Sever
son (14-6), who has been aided by rookie
pitcher Becky McCullough (16-3) in the
starter's spot. A freshman class of six that
mixed extremely well with six seniors this
year has also given the 2004-2005 squad
plenty of benefits.
