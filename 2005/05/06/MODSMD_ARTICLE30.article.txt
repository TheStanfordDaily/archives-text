## Physicist Drell wins Heinz Award 
### MARI HAYMAN 
Sidney Drell, professor emeritus at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, will be awarded with one of the largest individual achievement
prizes in the world on Monday. The Heinz Award, consisting of a medal
lion and a $25(),(MH) cash prize, is awarded annually to five Americans by
the Heinz Family Foundation, a philanthropic organization led by Teresa
Heinz-kerry, wile of Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.)
Drell, a theoretical physicist and Hoover Institution fellow, will be hon
ored in the area of public policy for his ongoing work with arms control and
national security issues.
"The Heinz Awards were created to recognize excellence, intangible
qualities of spirit and the intention to go good work for the betterment of
mankind," said Kim O'Dell. director of the Heinz Awards, adding that
Drell stood out as a candidate for the public policy prize "because of the
leadership that he's shown to reduce the danger of nuclear weapons, and
certainly his academic career at Stanford doing pioneering research and
particle physics with other students and other scientists to help them un
derstand the importance of [these] issues."
Abraham Sofaer, also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, has col
laborated with Drell during past projects on biological and chemical
weapons, and they co-edited the book "The New Terror: Facing the
Threat of Biological and Chemical Weapons" in 1999. The two academics
plan to hold a conference on preventative force at the end of May.
"He is an incredibly good colleague and friend." Sofaer said of Drell.
"He has a wealth of experience in the real world, in politics and as a scien
tist and scholar."
Drell. who served as deputy director at SLAC until his retirement in
1998, has contributed new discoveries to the scientific fields since the
19605. For instance, he pioneered research that led to the discovery of sub
atomic particles called quarks. Today, he is a major authority on the tech
nical aspects of the national security debate.
"One of the big components of his work has been serving as an advisor
on technical and classified national security matters," O'Dell said, citing
Drell's work on the JASON project, an academic-based advisory panel on
national defense issues.
In 19X3, Drell and co-director John Lewis, professor of Chinese politics,
emeritus, founded the Center for International Security and Cooperation,

or CISAC, a national security research institute on campus.
This month. CISAC is sending two nuclear nonproliferation experts to
New York fora conference to review the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, which is reevaluated every five years.
"CISAC would not be here today without Sid Drell getting the hall
rolling with John Lewis in 19X3 and turning it into a leading research cen
ter on national security," said Sharan Daniel, media and publications man
ager for CISAC. "We're delighted to see him recognized in this way be
cause he's been such an important part of arms control and the nuclear
non-proliferation movement."
The first Heinz Awards were granted in 1994. in memory of Sen. John
Heinz 111. who served in the U.S. Senate for 15 years before his untimely
death in a 1991 plane crash.
