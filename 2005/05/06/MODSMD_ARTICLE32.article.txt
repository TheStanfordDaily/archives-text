Marie, a five-year-old Jewish
girl, sat on a train amidst Nazi sol
diers in Warsaw, Poland. On both
sides of her train, wails and sobbing
echoed through the night as sol
diers thrust Jews into airtight cattle
cars. Blonde hair and blue eyes
concealed her Jewish identity, but
she knew that if the Nazis discov
ered her secret, she too would be
sent to the camps.
Wednesday night, Marie
Brandstetter. now in her early
70s, recounted her story of sur
vival at the Taube Center for Jew
ish Studies in commemoration of
Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memo
rial Day.
"Whenever I think back to
those years. 1 must have had an
angel on my shoulder," said Brand
stetter, the recent author of
"Mania's Angel: My Life Story." "I
still cannot believe that 1 survived."
Following the Nazi invasion of
Poland in 1939, Branndstetter and
her family tied from the country
and wandered as refugees through
the Soviet Union atid Central Asia.
Traveling by foot and hiding on
coal transport trains, they some
times didn't eat for days at a time.
"At one point my brother and 1
were so hungry that we stopped in
the middle of the road and re
fused to walk further," Brandstet

ter said. "My mother found a
mule covered by maggots on the
road. I was sick to my stomach,
but she forced it down our throats
so that we would have the
strength to go on."
Starvation and disease were
rampant in the Soviet Union dur
ing this period, Brandstetter said.
She said she almost died during a
lengthy battle with stomach ty
phoid.
She also spoke about her expe
rience aboard the Exodus. Brand
setter recollected that when the
ship approached the shores of
Palestine, the British began to as
sail the Jewish refugees.
"They were attacking us with
tear gas and water hoses and we
were fighting back with cans of
food and potatoes," she said.
"There was so much screaming and
crying going on. I still can hear it in
my mind today."
Julie Veroff, a junior who at
tended the event, said she appreci
ated that Brandstetter shed light
on the plight of Holocaust victims
who were not sent to concentration
camps, but whose survival stories
are just as poignant.
Students asked Brandstetter if
she is afraid that accounts of the
Holocaust will die with those who
survived it.
"When we are no longer here,
the second generation and you
yourselves, the third generation.

will speak out," she said. "When
my grand-daughter asked me to
speak to her fifth grade class in Bal
timore, they were so respectful and
concerned that 1 could not stop cry
ing."
Brandstetter said she also feels
secure about the future of the Jew
ish people since the emergence of
the State of Israel.
"Now there is a free Jewish state
to be proud of — one that stands
tall among the nations of the
world," she said.
Following Brandstetter's
speech, members of STAND, Stu
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur.
praised Jewish organizations that
have played active roles in efforts
to end the genocide in the Darfur
region of Sudan.
"In Darfur, 'Never again' has
become 'Once again,' " said
Chrissie Coxon, STAND member.
Students said they felt that it
was significant that the program
connected this current genocide to
that perpetrated during World
War 11.
"The reason why learning about
the Holocaust is so important is
that it happened in a time and place
that nobody would have even ex
pected such monstrosities to
occur," said audience member ju
nior Adi Grief. "As Darfur and the
Holocaust demonstrate, we must
constantly be on the lookout for
such malevolence."
