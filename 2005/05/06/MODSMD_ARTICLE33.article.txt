## Jeff Dorman Sucks! A
						little luck and all the money 
### 
UT call," I say, sweating my marginal hand of
I 8-10unsuited.
"Raise."
"Damn." I fold, with my frustrations sweating
off my sleeve. I just tried to sneak a look at the Hop
and was rejected like a ninth grader at the winter
semi-formal. Mike Boutross, my only opponent,
reaches out to corral his chips.
"All the money please," he says.
Three weeks ago, Boutross, a senior, won the
biggest prize of his life: a seat at the World Series
of Poker Main Event. But right now we're going
heads-up, one-on-one and I'm not about to let the
best player I've ever sat with take all my money.
Now. I've played poker before. I've even
played with Boutross before. But never heads-up.
In fact, for most of the summer, I was so scared of

Boutross that whenever he was
in a hand, I was out. I just never
knew what he had. and after
every play, he would call out
my exact cards. With his trade
mark little grin, he would say
something like, "Clown, what
are you doing raising with
Queen-Jack?" I would then
fold my Queen-Jack.
But not Wednesday night.

The tables would turn and I would take down a
guy who this summer will sit down in Vegas for his
chance at $10 million. In contrast, this summer 1
will be sitting down in interviews for my chance at
an unpaid part-time internship.
We play Texas Hold'em, each buying in for 10
dollars, with the blinds at 25 and 50 cents. For
those of you unfamiliar with Hold em, each play
er is dealt two "down cards" followed by a round
of betting. Five cards then come as "community
cards," with betting after the third, fourth and
fifth card. Each player tries to make the best five
card hand he can. using the community and his
own down cards. "Blinds" are merely antes,
forced bets that induce action to win the pot.
It seems like just a few days ago that I was play
ing poker with friends, watching Boutross ner
vously finger his chips, waiting for his internet
poker tournament to start. In fact, I still remem
ber that I had to remind him at 9:15 to head back
to his computer. 1 knew he had won a smaller
tournament earlier in the day, and that this tour
nament was a satellite qualifier for the World Se
ries. but not until I checked my e-mail the next
morning did I truly understand the potential gain
that befell him.
"Big Papi," Boutross' Pavid Ortiz-inspired
Internet moniker, had won a prize worth $13,5(X)
— hotel, spending cash and a seat at the World
Series of Poker.
And I was going to break him? I had a better
chance of winning the Kentucky Derby without a
horse.
But as they often do, things started out auspi
ciously for your favorite columnist. I started to
catch cards. It was luck, really, any strategy would
have won money. I had pocket aces when he had
pocket sevens, had three of a kind when he picked
up two pair and was catching my draws. Before
you could say "All the money please," Boutross
was reaching into his pocket to buy in for the third
time.
Life was good. I was winning big and this is no
lie. Now. if a certain sorority that will remain
nameless calls 400 packaged Taco Bell tacos a
"barbecue", then. well, that is a lie.
It was Tri Delt.
But back to poker. By this time. Boutross and
I had attracted a small audience, with Chip Han
key, whose first name matches his physical
stature, peeking over my shoulder during every
hand. Second-guessing my every move on a hand
I lost. Chip condescendingly reminded me that I
was the small blind on the next hand. Beyond
angry. I told my diminutive friend that if I poked
out his eyes, he'd be the "small blind." Boutross
called this the best poker joke he had ever heard.
And he's even seen "Tilt!"
In the end. I won $20 that night. Boutross
clawed back from poverty after we expanded the
game to three players, but never really caught the
cards that could take me down in a big pot. Some
times the right cards just don't fall.
Poker has taken on a new significance in
American culture recently. ESPN is riddled with
poker shows: repeats of past tournaments fre
quently trump live programming. Shows like
"Tilt," films like "Rounders." and high-profile
tournaments like the World Series have made
household names out of Phil Ivey, Daniel Negre
anu and Johnny Chan. Certainly, there are nega
tive aspects to this resurgence. For every dollar
won. there is a dollar lost and the addictive nature
of the game has many worried about the effects
on teenagers.
However, the allure of the game will keep it
thriving. Unlike sports such as basketball, loot
ball or even curling, anybody has a shot at the title.
There are no physical barriers to entry — any
body with $ 10.(KX) can take a seat at the World Se
ries. So just as I can get the better of a superior
player one night, so could Mike Boutross at the
World Series this summer.
But poker is not an exact science, so 1 can't tell
you that Boutross will end up at the final table,
staring down Marcel Luske for the $10 million.
Hell. Boutross would rather take the cash value of
his seat if he can. But if he does end up next to
Luske and says on ESPN. "Clown, why are you
raising with Queen-Jack?", I'd advise Marcel to
fold.
All the money, please.
