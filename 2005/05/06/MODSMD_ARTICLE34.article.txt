# Dobson one of Stanford's track greats

Senior lan Dobson became the fastest American
10,000-meter runner this year with his performance at
the Cardinal Invitational on Sunday night. Dobson ran
the race in 27:59.72, beating his previous career-best of
28:15.66.
The Klamath Falls, Ore. native is looking more and
more like a professional runner these days. The political
science major finished his degree last quarter, and now
spends his time living off campus reading, watching
movies and, of course, running.
"I live with two guys on the team, and one of them,
Chris [Emme] is in the same boat with me," Dobson said.
"He and I are done taking classes, so we hang out a lot to
gether and read and watch movies and whatnot, but for
me it is kind of like a test period for professional running.
I am definitely going to continue running next year, and
a lot of people say you need to have a part time job or
something to keep your brain moving, you know, and
keep sane so you don't just think about running all the
time, hut a lot of runners do not do that either."
Dobson has taken the latter path, and so far he is
happy with his decision.
"This is my period to try it out without a job and I re
ally like it," Dobson said. "Somehow I fill up the time.
Today I spent the entire day making a Mother's Day
card."
In terms of racing, Dobson is having one of the best
years of his career, breaking records and winning nation
al championships. Dobson was named the Pacific-10
Conference co-athlete of the week for his record-setting
10,000-meter run. He said his win at the 2005 NCAA Na
tional Indoor Championships last February, though, is
his biggest accomplishment thus far.
"This last weekend was a good one," Dobson said.
"But people tend to focus too much on times rather than
the race, and as far as race wise, during the 5k at Indoor
Nationals this winter I really felt good and very competi
tive."
Dobson has been a runner since he was in grade
school.
"My parents both ran — they were competitive run
ners — so it was always sort of a sport that was in my
repertoire," Dobson said. "Once I got to high school I de
cided it was something that I really wanted to do. I start
ed putting my energy into running, and then I made it my
goal to run at a really good college and get a scholarship
to run."
As a freshman at Stanford, Dobson placed fifth at the
cross-country NCAA West Regionals and helped lead
his team to a fourth-place finish at the NCAA Champi
onships. Dobson redshirted his freshman track and field
season, but won the 5,000-meters at the U.S. Junior Na
tionals, securing a place for himself at the Junior Pan-
American Games in Argentina. Since then he has earned

sport that has been part of his life since he was in elementary school.
