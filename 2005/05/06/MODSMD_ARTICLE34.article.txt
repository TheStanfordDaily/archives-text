# Dobson one of Stanford's track greats
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior lan Dobson became the fastest American
10,000-meter runner this year with his performance at
the Cardinal Invitational on Sunday night. Dobson ran
the race in 27:59.72, beating his previous career-best of
28:15.66.
The Klamath Falls, Ore. native is looking more and
more like a professional runner these days. The political
science major finished his degree last quarter, and now
spends his time living off campus reading, watching
movies and, of course, running.
"I live with two guys on the team, and one of them,
Chris [Emme] is in the same boat with me," Dobson said.
"He and I are done taking classes, so we hang out a lot to
gether and read and watch movies and whatnot, but for
me it is kind of like a test period for professional running.
I am definitely going to continue running next year, and
a lot of people say you need to have a part time job or
something to keep your brain moving, you know, and
keep sane so you don't just think about running all the
time, hut a lot of runners do not do that either."
Dobson has taken the latter path, and so far he is
happy with his decision.
"This is my period to try it out without a job and I re
ally like it," Dobson said. "Somehow I fill up the time.
Today I spent the entire day making a Mother's Day
card."
In terms of racing, Dobson is having one of the best
years of his career, breaking records and winning nation
al championships. Dobson was named the Pacific-10
Conference co-athlete of the week for his record-setting
10,000-meter run. He said his win at the 2005 NCAA Na
tional Indoor Championships last February, though, is
his biggest accomplishment thus far.
"This last weekend was a good one," Dobson said.
"But people tend to focus too much on times rather than
the race, and as far as race wise, during the 5k at Indoor
Nationals this winter I really felt good and very competi
tive."
Dobson has been a runner since he was in grade
school.
"My parents both ran — they were competitive run
ners — so it was always sort of a sport that was in my
repertoire," Dobson said. "Once I got to high school I de
cided it was something that I really wanted to do. I start
ed putting my energy into running, and then I made it my
goal to run at a really good college and get a scholarship
to run."
As a freshman at Stanford, Dobson placed fifth at the
cross-country NCAA West Regionals and helped lead
his team to a fourth-place finish at the NCAA Champi
onships. Dobson redshirted his freshman track and field
season, but won the 5,000-meters at the U.S. Junior Na
tionals, securing a place for himself at the Junior Pan-
American Games in Argentina. Since then he has earned

a score of top place-finishes and
record-setting marks in cross coun
try. and during the indoor and out
door track seasons.
Staying physically motivated
through five taxing years of compet
itive running, though, has not been
the only challenge for Dohson.
"Staying motivated for academics
has really been my biggest challenge
here at Stanford." Dobson said.
"And the coaching change two years
ago from Vin Lananna to Andy Ger
ard has been the other big challenge
for me. Vin is still sort of this godfa
ther figure in track, and he built the
program up from nothing to a really
good program. So when Gerard
came in I did not know what to ex
pect. and he has done a good job. but
a lot of being a successful runner is
having a coach you can stick with and
really trust and get to know."
Dobson attributes his success —
he will graduate this spring as one of
the best Cardinal distance runners
of all time — is his genuine love of
running, a trait he says that some
collegiate runners lack.
"I love running, and really I am
lucky because there are guys who do
not like it and it is really hard for
them," Dobson said. "1 go out to
Huddart Park in Woodside, and it is
just very rejuvenating. It is an awe
some place. 1 probably would not
have made it through my five years
here without having that park.
"My (running) goals are foremost
in my mind. too. so I do not have any
problem with motivation, like getting
out the door in the morning fora run
or stretching. 1 do not have TV or In
ternet, so for better or worse running
is what my life revolves around."
Dobson's goals include winning
the 5,000-meter or 10,000-meter
run. or both, at the NCAA Champi
onships in June. At the 2004 Cham
pionships, Dobson finished third in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase, but
with his goal of earning a contract
this year, Dobson is focusing on the
more prestigious 5k and I Ok races.
Meanwhile, he will continue to
run his average 90 miles a week in
preparation for Pac-10 Champi
onships, West Kegionals and out
door nationals.
The rest of the men's and
women's track and field teams are
busy preparing for the big meets
coming up as well. This weekend,
about 20 athletes will travel to
Sacramento for the Sac State Invita
tional, a tuneup meet before the
postseason gets underway.

Fifth-year senior lan Dobson finished his political science degree last quarter and is now devoting his time to running, a
sport that has been part of his life since he was in elementary school.
a score of top place-finishes and
record-setting marks in cross coun
try. and during the indoor and out
door track seasons.
Staying physically motivated
through five taxing years of compet
itive running, though, has not been
the only challenge for Dohson.
"Staying motivated for academics
has really been my biggest challenge
here at Stanford." Dobson said.
"And the coaching change two years
ago from Vin Lananna to Andy Ger
ard has been the other big challenge
for me. Vin is still sort of this godfa
ther figure in track, and he built the
program up from nothing to a really
good program. So when Gerard
came in I did not know what to ex
pect. and he has done a good job. but
a lot of being a successful runner is
having a coach you can stick with and
really trust and get to know."
Dobson attributes his success —
he will graduate this spring as one of
the best Cardinal distance runners
of all time — is his genuine love of
running, a trait he says that some
collegiate runners lack.
"I love running, and really I am
lucky because there are guys who do
not like it and it is really hard for
them," Dobson said. "1 go out to
Huddart Park in Woodside, and it is
just very rejuvenating. It is an awe
some place. 1 probably would not
have made it through my five years
here without having that park.
"My (running) goals are foremost
in my mind. too. so I do not have any
problem with motivation, like getting
out the door in the morning fora run
or stretching. 1 do not have TV or In
ternet, so for better or worse running
is what my life revolves around."
Dobson's goals include winning
the 5,000-meter or 10,000-meter
run. or both, at the NCAA Champi
onships in June. At the 2004 Cham
pionships, Dobson finished third in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase, but
with his goal of earning a contract
this year, Dobson is focusing on the
more prestigious 5k and I Ok races.
Meanwhile, he will continue to
run his average 90 miles a week in
preparation for Pac-10 Champi
onships, West Kegionals and out
door nationals.
The rest of the men's and
women's track and field teams are
busy preparing for the big meets
coming up as well. This weekend,
about 20 athletes will travel to
Sacramento for the Sac State Invita
tional, a tuneup meet before the
postseason gets underway.
Senior Nicholas Taylor will com
pete in the decathlon this Saturday
and Sunday at the Pac-10 Multi-
Event Championships.
