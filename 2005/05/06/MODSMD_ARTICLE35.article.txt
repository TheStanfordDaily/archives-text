# Cycling finishes strong in Nevada
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford cycling team
capped off one of its most successful
seasons in recent memory last week
end with a slew of top finishes at the
Western Collegiate Cycling Confer
ence Championships in Reno, Nev.
Senior Chris Montague-Breakwell
and master's student Amber Rais
won the Men's A and Women's A
criteriums, respectively, and Stan
ford won both the Men's A and B
team time trials as well.
While the Cardinal were unable
to hold off Cal for the 2005 WCCC
Team Omnium title, three Stanford
riders ended the season with yellow
jerseys as individual Omnium cham
pions. Doctoral student David
Pierce and Rais captured the Men's
and Women's A titles, respectively,
and freshman Ryan Parnes won the
Men's B.
Montague-Breakwell, who fin
ished 12th in the Men's A Omnium
— one spot behind Stanford's Scott
Giles — scored valuable team
points with his first win of the season
in Saturday's criterium, which con
sisted of 24 laps around a 1.1 mile
loop.
"Winning the criterium was the
highlight of my season,* said Mon
tague-Breakwell, who has raced
bikes for the past 12 seasons, includ
ing two years professionally. "After
winning the Conference road race
last year and then finishing second at
the Collegiate National Road Race
Championships. I've been marked
all year."
Pierce placed seventh in the cri
terium and 15th in Sunday's road
race but managed to hold off Cal
Poly's Ken Hanson for the individu
al Omnium.
Montague-Breakwell said that
the road race was the deciding factor
in Cal's come-from-behind team
Omnium win. He started strong,
breaking away with a UC-Santa Bar
bara and a Cal rider off the starting

line of the 88-mile race, and re
mained in the front pack for more
than half of the ride.
"Uhfortunately, the group that
caught us included only one Stan
ford rider, Scott Giles, to two Cal
riders," Montague-Breakwell said.
"I was tired from the early effort and
the two Cal riders got away on the
final climb at mile 75. Scott and I
chased and came within 20 seconds
of catching them by the finish line,
but the damage had been done."
Cal's first three riders placed
fourth, eighth and 12th, while Stan
ford's placed 10th, 13th and 15th. Cal
also outperformed Stanford in the
Women's A road race, with its first
three riders placing first, sixth and
seventh. Rais placed second, while
Ashley Fouts and Sheela Singla
placed ninth and 13th, respectively,
for Stanford.
Rais, who was tied with UC-
Santa Barbara's Brooke Miller for
the Women's A Omnium heading
into last weekend, said she was fo
cused entirely on maintaining Stan
ford's lead in the team Omnium at
Conference Championships.
"The more points 1 could muster,
the better for the team," Rais said of
Saturday's criterium. "It just turned
out that in going for these points I
finished ahead of Brooke to move
into the lead for the individual Om
nium."
The story was the same in Sun
day's road race, as Rais and Cal's
Stefanie Graeter, a professional
rider and the defending Collegiate
Road National Champion, broke
ahead early on. They finished one
two. placing Rais ahead of Miller,
who took third.
"1 had never made this an explic
it goal for myself," Rais said. "After
such a fantastic season for Stanford,
it's icing on the cake."
Parnes ran away with the Men's B
title, while Ueyn Block, who placed
second in the criterium in Reno, fin
