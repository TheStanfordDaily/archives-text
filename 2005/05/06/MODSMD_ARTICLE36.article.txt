# The 						best is yet to come for KC
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
He was Pacific-10 Conference freshman
ol the year and Stanford freshman athlete of
the year. The All-American also played in
the U.S. Open, won a Pac-1() doubles title
this year and an NCAA doubles title in 2(X)4.
And according to his coach, we still haven't
seen what KC Corkery can do.
"Wc haven't seen KC's best tennis yet,"
head coach John Whitlingersaid. "That is yet
to come, but he's a winner and he's done a
great job."
The junior began playing tennis at the end
of elementary school when his father put him
in front of a ball machine and handed him a
baseball bat. Corkery practiced for about an
hour but had a bit of difficulty with the bat.
I he next day. his father handed him a tennis
racquet, and that's when he started swinging
away.
Corkery played a wide spectrum of
sports, including basketball, baseball, soccer
and water polo in high school. However, ten
nis ultimately was the sport in which Corkery
excelled. At one point Corkery was the top
junior player in Southern California and in
the top 10 nationally. Still, Corkery said that
he was not highly recruited by colleges, and
he decided to take a year off from school to
play tennis.
Originally born in Australia, Corkery has
dual citizenship and returns to the Land
Down Under whenever he can. All too fa
miliar with travel, he had more than his share
of travel time in his year off. Corkery, also
called "Roo," played tennis for about 40
weeks out of the year and, at one point, for 17
weeks in a row.
"My parents were the biggest supporters
of taking a year off to play," Corkery said.
"They said I wasn't going to have another op
portunity like this where 1 pretty much had
no responsibilities, got a chance to travel the
world, experience a lot of new things and be
independent."
Corkery achieved a singles ranking as
high as KKO in the world and said he felt as if
he earned a little more respect and recogni
tion on the college tennis scene.
"I traveled and played so much that I was
in about as good of [tennis] shape as I think I
could have been coming into school, and I
think that's what helped jumpstart my col
lege career," Corkery said.
When considering colleges, Corkery
looked fora school strong in academics, be
cause according to him, that was one of his

parents' original reasons for his involvement
in the sport.
"They were looking fora way to maybe
help me get into a college someday," Cork
ery said. ' They weren't looking for me to get
a scholarship or anything like that; they were
just hoping it might help me get into a good
academic school.
"When I got the chance to go to Stanford,
a great academic institution as well as being
the premiere tennis college program in the
last 40 years, it was very hard for me to pass
that up."
Stanford was also full of faces that were
familiar to Corkery from his days as a junior.
He had faced current seniors Sam Warburg
and Phil Sheng. as well as redshirting junior
James Pade in numerous tournaments, com
peting with and against them since the age of
12.
"It's cool how 10 years ago we were all
playing together and we're all playing to
gether on the team now," Corkery said. "It's
neat to think that half of my life, I've been
playing tennis with these guys. There's some
thing special about that for sure."
Since coming to Stanford, Corkery has
made the transition from the tour to college
tennis and has compiled an impressive re
sume, including the NCAA doubles crown,
an appearance in the main draw of the U.S.
Open and most recently the Pac-10 doubles
title with Warburg. Just this week, the duo
received a No. 2 seed for the NCAA individ
ual tournament to be held later this month in
College Station. Texas.
Whitlinger attributes the pair's success
thus far to their competitive nature and will
ingness to do anything it takes to win a
match, in addition to the fact that they have
played so many matches together.
"They know what serves work, when to
move and where the other guy is; that comes
with playing with the same guy a lot,"
Whitlinger said. "But it hasn't been all rosy
for them — they've had their ups and downs.
But they come on the same page when it
counts, like last year at Tulsa, when they won
NCAAs. All of a sudden everything started
clicking."
Corkery has also excelled in singles. He
has posted a 19-3 record this year in dual
matches, including a current eight-match win
streak. Although he is often seen running
around his backhand in singles matches to hit
a forehand, the junior's backhand is not
weak by any means.
"I think he likes to build points to where
he gets to his forehand, because that's deli

"//'s neat to think that half
of my life, I've been playing
tennis with these guys.
There 'v something special
about that for sure."

nitely the weapon he wants to get to,"
Whitlinger said. "His backhand is getting
better and better and it's a shot 1 still think
can get even better."
Whitlinger likens Corkery's style to that
of current professional Mike Bryan in that
both possess all-court games. Whitlinger said
he thinks that Corkery's chances of capturing
the NCAA singles title are as good as anyone
else's.
"KC serves pretty well," Whitlinger said.
"When he needs a big serve on a big point. 90
percent of the time he gets it. He's also quick
and can move around the net well, and he's
not afraid to serve and volley. Yet he can stay
on the baseline and work the ball and vary
the speeds. He's a pretty good all-court play
er and can do a lot of different things."
Whitlinger and junior Jon Wong view KC
as one of the leaders on the team.
"He's not our captain," Wong said, "but
he definitely leads by example and always
has things on his mind that he wants to con
vey to the team. He has a really strong per
sonality, and he's not afraid to speak his mind
and let everyone else know what he's think
ing. For that reason, he's a good leader and
always has really good insight."
Wong recalled a speech that Corkery
made after the team's 4-3 loss to Pepperdine.
"He was talking about how we need to
have a different attitude," Wong said. "KC
said, 'We've always been the favorite and ex
pected to win. but this year, people are less
afraid to play us. They've played their best
against us and are playing to win while we are
playing not to lose.' 1 thought it was interest
ing hearing KC talk about how sometimes
we have to look at ourselves as underdogs to
get that lire and to get that intensity back.
Alter losing a few matches, we kind of lost
our fire a little bit."
Whether the team lost its lire temporarily
or not. all of the players are still a part of the
Stanford tennis community, one of Cork

ery's favorite aspects of being on the Farm.
One of his most memorable moments was at
former coach Dick Gould's retirement din
ner, when he looked around at the large
number of former and current players and
realized how special it was to be a part of that
community.
"I grew up hearing stories about Stanford
tennis and it's something I thought of doing
when 1 was a kid," Corkery said. "There's a
pride with being a member of the Stanford
tennis tradition. When I'm out there playing.

as much as I'd like to win individually, you
feel a bond, not only with the other team
mates, but also with the guys who have gone
through the program and have made it what
it is.
"1 never had individual aspirations of win
ning NCAAs," he continued. "While that
type of accomplishment is very fulfilling, 1
think it really hit me the most at the dinner
when 1 was able to look around and realize
that Stanford tennis is something that will be
with me for the rest of niv life."

"He's not our captain," Wong said, "but
he definitely leads by example and always
has things on his mind that he wants to con
vey to the team. He has a really strong per
sonality, and he's not afraid to speak his mind
and let everyone else know what he's think
ing. For that reason, he's a good leader and
always has really good insight."
Wong recalled a speech that Corkery
made after the team's 4-3 loss to Pepperdine.
"He was talking about how we need to
have a different attitude," Wong said. "KC
said, 'We've always been the favorite and ex
pected to win. but this year, people are less
afraid to play us. They've played their best
against us and are playing to win while we are
playing not to lose.' 1 thought it was interest
ing hearing KC talk about how sometimes
we have to look at ourselves as underdogs to
get that lire and to get that intensity back.
Alter losing a few matches, we kind of lost
our fire a little bit."
Whether the team lost its lire temporarily
or not. all of the players are still a part of the
Stanford tennis community, one of Cork

ery's favorite aspects of being on the Farm.
One of his most memorable moments was at
former coach Dick Gould's retirement din
ner, when he looked around at the large
number of former and current players and
realized how special it was to be a part of that
community.
"I grew up hearing stories about Stanford
tennis and it's something I thought of doing
when 1 was a kid," Corkery said. "There's a
pride with being a member of the Stanford
tennis tradition. When I'm out there playing.

as much as I'd like to win individually, you
feel a bond, not only with the other team
mates, but also with the guys who have gone
through the program and have made it what
it is.
"1 never had individual aspirations of win
ning NCAAs," he continued. "While that
type of accomplishment is very fulfilling, 1
think it really hit me the most at the dinner
when 1 was able to look around and realize
that Stanford tennis is something that will be
with me for the rest of niv life."

Junior KC Corkery will team up with senior Sam Warburg to defend their doubles title at
the 2005 NCAA Championships later this month.
He was Pacific-10 Conference freshman
ol the year and Stanford freshman athlete of
the year. The All-American also played in
the U.S. Open, won a Pac-1() doubles title
this year and an NCAA doubles title in 2(X)4.
And according to his coach, we still haven't
seen what KC Corkery can do.
"Wc haven't seen KC's best tennis yet,"
head coach John Whitlingersaid. "That is yet
to come, but he's a winner and he's done a
great job."
The junior began playing tennis at the end
of elementary school when his father put him
in front of a ball machine and handed him a
baseball bat. Corkery practiced for about an
hour but had a bit of difficulty with the bat.
I he next day. his father handed him a tennis
racquet, and that's when he started swinging
away.
Corkery played a wide spectrum of
sports, including basketball, baseball, soccer
and water polo in high school. However, ten
nis ultimately was the sport in which Corkery
excelled. At one point Corkery was the top
junior player in Southern California and in
the top 10 nationally. Still, Corkery said that
he was not highly recruited by colleges, and
he decided to take a year off from school to
play tennis.
Originally born in Australia, Corkery has
dual citizenship and returns to the Land
Down Under whenever he can. All too fa
miliar with travel, he had more than his share
of travel time in his year off. Corkery, also
called "Roo," played tennis for about 40
weeks out of the year and, at one point, for 17
weeks in a row.
"My parents were the biggest supporters
of taking a year off to play," Corkery said.
"They said I wasn't going to have another op
portunity like this where 1 pretty much had
no responsibilities, got a chance to travel the
world, experience a lot of new things and be
independent."
Corkery achieved a singles ranking as
high as KKO in the world and said he felt as if
he earned a little more respect and recogni
tion on the college tennis scene.
"I traveled and played so much that I was
in about as good of [tennis] shape as I think I
could have been coming into school, and I
think that's what helped jumpstart my col
lege career," Corkery said.
When considering colleges, Corkery
looked fora school strong in academics, be
cause according to him, that was one of his

parents' original reasons for his involvement
in the sport.
"They were looking fora way to maybe
help me get into a college someday," Cork
ery said. ' They weren't looking for me to get
a scholarship or anything like that; they were
just hoping it might help me get into a good
academic school.
"When I got the chance to go to Stanford,
a great academic institution as well as being
the premiere tennis college program in the
last 40 years, it was very hard for me to pass
that up."
Stanford was also full of faces that were
familiar to Corkery from his days as a junior.
He had faced current seniors Sam Warburg
and Phil Sheng. as well as redshirting junior
James Pade in numerous tournaments, com
peting with and against them since the age of
12.
"It's cool how 10 years ago we were all
playing together and we're all playing to
gether on the team now," Corkery said. "It's
neat to think that half of my life, I've been
playing tennis with these guys. There's some
thing special about that for sure."
Since coming to Stanford, Corkery has
made the transition from the tour to college
tennis and has compiled an impressive re
sume, including the NCAA doubles crown,
an appearance in the main draw of the U.S.
Open and most recently the Pac-10 doubles
title with Warburg. Just this week, the duo
received a No. 2 seed for the NCAA individ
ual tournament to be held later this month in
College Station. Texas.
Whitlinger attributes the pair's success
thus far to their competitive nature and will
ingness to do anything it takes to win a
match, in addition to the fact that they have
played so many matches together.
"They know what serves work, when to
move and where the other guy is; that comes
with playing with the same guy a lot,"
Whitlinger said. "But it hasn't been all rosy
for them — they've had their ups and downs.
But they come on the same page when it
counts, like last year at Tulsa, when they won
NCAAs. All of a sudden everything started
clicking."
Corkery has also excelled in singles. He
has posted a 19-3 record this year in dual
matches, including a current eight-match win
streak. Although he is often seen running
around his backhand in singles matches to hit
a forehand, the junior's backhand is not
weak by any means.
"I think he likes to build points to where
he gets to his forehand, because that's deli

"//'s neat to think that half
of my life, I've been playing
tennis with these guys.
There 'v something special
about that for sure."

nitely the weapon he wants to get to,"
Whitlinger said. "His backhand is getting
better and better and it's a shot 1 still think
can get even better."
Whitlinger likens Corkery's style to that
of current professional Mike Bryan in that
both possess all-court games. Whitlinger said
he thinks that Corkery's chances of capturing
the NCAA singles title are as good as anyone
else's.
"KC serves pretty well," Whitlinger said.
"When he needs a big serve on a big point. 90
percent of the time he gets it. He's also quick
and can move around the net well, and he's
not afraid to serve and volley. Yet he can stay
on the baseline and work the ball and vary
the speeds. He's a pretty good all-court play
er and can do a lot of different things."
Whitlinger and junior Jon Wong view KC
as one of the leaders on the team.
"He's not our captain," Wong said, "but
he definitely leads by example and always
has things on his mind that he wants to con
vey to the team. He has a really strong per
