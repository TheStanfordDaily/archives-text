# Baseball a family affair for Stanford's closer
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
For Cardinal hurler Matt Man
ship, pitching has always been a
family affair. His father, John,
pitched for the Arizona Wildcats
in his college days, as did his uncle,
Jim, who would go on to play in
the Brewers' organization. When
Matt and his younger brother,
Jeff, were growing up, there was
little doubt what position they
would play.
"Especially at a younger age,
not many people can pitch, so
[John] said, 'this is the path, this is
the way to go,'" Matt said. He en
joyed the offensive side of the
game more and thought of himself
primarily as a corner infielder
until his junior year in high school,
when he became convinced that
his father had been right all along.
Watching Matt pitch for the

Cardinal this year, it is hard to be
lieve that he ever thought of him
self as anything but a hurler. But
he would tell you that the offen
sive mentality that he learned
early on has been a big part of his
success.
"When you're out on the
mound, you're on defense, but
you have to be in offensive con
trol," he said. "I think that's prob
ably the best way to describe it: be
offensive rather than defensive."
He began the year with a
streak of 16 2/3 consecutive
scoreless innings and has al
lowed only one run since then,
posting a stifling 0.43 ERA and
striking out 16 batters over 21 in
nings. He earned his first save of
the year in a home game against
Oregon State on April 10, slam
ming the door on a 4-3 Cardinal

While Matt Manship is busy reclaiming his place as the Cardinal's clos
er, younger brother Jeff is regaining his starting spot at Notre Dame.
victory willi iwo strikeouts over 1
1/3 innings.
That performance in part has
helped him to regain the closing role
that he held during his freshman sea
son. hut lost last year to senior David
O'l lagan.
But that kind of dominance is
nothing new to the Manship family.
Jeff, a sophomore pitcher at Notre
Dame, posted a similarly sterling
0.65 ERA to go with a record of 22-2
during his senior campaign at Rea
gan High School in San Antonio,
where the brothers pitched together.
Baseball America ranked Jeff as
the third-best high school pitching
prospect two years ago, behind
North Carolina's Andrew Miller and
Southern California's lan Kennedy.
When Jeff committed to the Fight
ing Irish, he was the highest-ranked
pitching prospect to ever don the

blue and gold.
But while Matt is thriving in the
closer's role for the Cardinal, Jeff is
trying to get his feet back under him.
I le underwent Tommy John surgery
on Feb. 11 last season, a procedure in
which ligaments are grafted onto the
elbow. The Stanford baseball team
was gearing fora series with Kansas,
but Matt was worried about his
brother.
The brothers, who are only 13
months apart, had always played on
the same Little League teams, often
coached by their father.
But now, they are separated by the
more than 2,(HX) miles that span from
Palo Alto to South Bend, lnd. After
his surgery, Jeff couldn't rely on his
older brother for support, except
over the phone, and Matt was frus
trated because he couldn't help Jeff
through the rough road ahead of him.
"It was terrible for him just be
cause he was out of the game for so
long, and you still have to be around
it because you're still on the team,"
Matt said. "I think that was probably
the worst part for him, was being

around it but not being able to par
ticipate at all. I wasn't there with
him. but from just talking with him.
but I'm sure ii was just terrible. It
was not an experience that you
would want anyone to have to go
through."
Jeff has had a relatively quick re
covery from the surgery, which can
take up to 14 months to come back
from. He played catch for the first
time with Matt at the end of last sum
mer, and he returned to the mound
for the first time on March 7 this year
in a start against Texas State. I le al
lowed three runs in one inning,
struggling with his control, but, as
Matt says, it is going to take some
time for Jeff to get his old form back.
"You've got to get used to it,"
Matt said. "He was wild at first, but
like 1 told him, that's to be expect
ed. You can't expect to go out and
be in top form . .. that's just ridicu
lous. It takes a while. It's a develop
ing process."
Jeff has started six games, pitch
ing one or two innings in each of
them, and he is getting his form back.

His best performance to date came
on April 10 against Boston College,
when he threw three scoreless in
nings in a relief appearance.
Matt, meanwhile, has come into
his own. relishing the opportunity to
close games out for the Cardinal.
"It's a great role, it's a fun role,"
Manship said of closing. "It's an
adrenaline rush. It's a lot different
than starting. You really have to
pace yourself when you're starting,
but when you're closing you really
don't have to think about that at all.
It's right then and there, you have to
get the first guy you see or the sec
ond guy you see, or that could be the
whole game."
Matt said that he talks on the
phone with his brother often, but he
was t|uick to point out that baseball
usually doesn't come up.
"We never really see each other,
so we talk about more important
things," Matt said. "You know, how
we're doing, stuff like that."
Even in a baseball family, there
are things more important than the
game.
