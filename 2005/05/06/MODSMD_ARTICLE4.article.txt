# Baseball a family affair for Stanford's closer
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
For Cardinal hurler Matt Man
ship, pitching has always been a
family affair. His father, John,
pitched for the Arizona Wildcats
in his college days, as did his uncle,
Jim, who would go on to play in
the Brewers' organization. When
Matt and his younger brother,
Jeff, were growing up, there was
little doubt what position they
would play.
"Especially at a younger age,
not many people can pitch, so
[John] said, 'this is the path, this is
the way to go,'" Matt said. He en
joyed the offensive side of the
game more and thought of himself
primarily as a corner infielder
until his junior year in high school,
when he became convinced that
his father had been right all along.
Watching Matt pitch for the

Cardinal this year, it is hard to be
lieve that he ever thought of him
self as anything but a hurler. But
he would tell you that the offen
sive mentality that he learned
early on has been a big part of his
success.
"When you're out on the
mound, you're on defense, but
you have to be in offensive con
trol," he said. "I think that's prob
ably the best way to describe it: be
offensive rather than defensive."
He began the year with a
streak of 16 2/3 consecutive
scoreless innings and has al
lowed only one run since then,
posting a stifling 0.43 ERA and
striking out 16 batters over 21 in
nings. He earned his first save of
the year in a home game against
Oregon State on April 10, slam
ming the door on a 4-3 Cardinal
