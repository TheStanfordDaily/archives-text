# It's a 'Brav New World'
## Open letter to the Stanford community 
### 
For those who passed Memorial Church
during the early hours of May 4 and wit
nessed the proud head of John Bravman
watting in the morning air;
For those who gathered in Memorial Au
ditorium on the afternoon of April 28 and
saw the same face unfurled am* >ngst a crowd
of 1 .(XX) admits and their famililes;
For those who have noticed the burgeon
ing slock of shirts circulating the Campus
with the Vice Provost's visage urangerl akin
to Andy Warhol's silk-screens|>f Chairman
Mao;
For those who rode over the versi< >n of his
face taped lo the asphalt in the so-called "in
tersection of

death;"
For those wlu>
live in ihe FroSo-
Co, the heart of
the Vice Provost's
dominion, whose
buildings still con
tinue to dawn the
cardinal red ban
ner of Bravman's
head;
And for Dr.
John C. Bravman
himself, we offer a
claim of responsi
bility and firmly
note the follow
ing: What you are
witnessing is nol
an act of terror
ism.
It is Project
BraV New
World, a perfor
mance artwork.

And wc arc a
group of experimental artists who have as
sembled to answer a single, vital question:
What happens when a Cult vif Personality
appears around a certain individual,
overnight, without His knowing? I low does
the public behave upon seeing the instanta
neous construction of such a Cult? And,
more importantly, how does He, the unwit
ting Cult Leader, react?
To the third question, we've only the be
ginnings of an answer. We know that Dr.
Bravman came into his first contact with
Brav New World while speaking on

the stuge of
Memorial Audito
rium. His talk,

"Making the
Most of Your
Undergraduate
Education,"
was presided
over by a 12-by
-15 foot revolu
tionary banner
of himself, un
furled sponta-

neously from the second-floor balcony.
His reaction? Dumbfounded. For what
does one do when confronted with a giant
image of oneself, staring back, with famil
iar glasses, tie and the signature chin? The
talk stopped. He addressed the banner
with a friendly "hello." However all ami
able signs disappeared when two func
tionaries of the VPUE were signaled to
take the poster out of sight. Where is it
now. we wonder?
We are often asked by our associates,
Why a Cult of Bravman? We find this ques
tion at the heart of our artistic inquiry — it
is interesting that one asks — for hasn't one
already noticed that the Cult existed long
before us? Turn to the FroSoCo or the
movement of Ujatnaa to Flo Mo. ascend to
tlu third floor of Sweet Hall which he has
elujmcd under the colonial acronym
VPI-'H, hear the legends propagated
around him: "His undergraduate poverty
i»ent him to hashing at Stern to make ends

meet," whispers
one. "He has
never left campus
for more than six
months," mum
bles the other
back.
John Bravman
has established a
cult of personality
around himself
long ago. We are
simply making it
Manifest.
Like the great
textile artists
Christo and
Jeanne-Claude,
wcreceivc no pay
ment tor our art
work. Rather, our
project is support
ed by the sale of
some 2(H) Brav
man shirts, featur
ing the vice

provost on thi front and one of three simple
words ("Barbecue". "Canada" and
on the back. The oblique' Co
nnection of each word to the VI'UE is left to
the viewer's interpretation.
We are an apolitical project. We are nei
ther for Bravman nor contrary to him. We
invite you to enjoy our Efforts and to sup
port theni with our Apparel which you will
soon see vended on Campus. We invite
Public Discussion, in the forum of The
Daily or elsewhere. Most importantly, we
invite you to have a new Sense of Wonder,
to see our Vice Provost in a dif-

ferent Light as His Visage
gazes down on you.
