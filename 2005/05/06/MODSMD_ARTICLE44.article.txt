### TIM LIPUS ASSHOLE 
Ever since Sunday, all that anyone has been talking
about is the fact that "Family Guy" is now back on the
air. At least that is all Tim Li pi is, Asshole, has been
talking about. Wednesday night, he headed around
campus to gauge the reactions of fellow students.
Tim Upas, Asshole: Hey, it's you again.
Vaguely Asian Guy From a Previous Week: Hey.
TL A: Did vou see the new episode of "Family Guy"?
VAGFAW: No
TL, A: So do you remember that part where he's
like, looking at the comic book, and he's like, "Look
at all those cheeseburgers. You can't eat all those
cheeseburgers"?
VAGFAW: I can imagine it, but no.
Tl, A: Yeah, that was awesome.
VAGFAW: Wait, are you just doing a bit that you
stole from Chris Farley?
[Pause]
TL, A: Yes.
On Wednesday, Draw numbers were announced,
and Tim Lipus, Asshole, miserable with his own IS2I,
decided to find out how other people had done. He
was also eager to use some newly acquired and prob
ably very offensive quotes from the new episode of
Family Guy.
TL A: Excuse me, you appear to be high and / or
drunk. Can I ask you some questions about the Draw?
High And / Or Drunk Guy: Sure

ed. I mean we all need to sacrifice a little bit. There's a
war going on, man.
