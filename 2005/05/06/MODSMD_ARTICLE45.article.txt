## WORSE THAN A CAR 'CRASH' 
### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSION MOVIE CRITIC 
Racist cops. Minority cops.
Self-righteous thugs. Paranoid
immigrants. Privileged whites.
Privileged blacks. Paul Haggis's
"Crash" is a highly distilled
dystopia of racial conflict and mis
understanding. where everyone is
wary of everyone else — often for
all the right reasons. In short, it's
the first feel-good movie of the
year.
Don Cheadle plays Graham, a
black L.A. police detective arriv
ing at an unknown crime scene as
the movie opens. His partner is
Gia (Jennifer Rsposito), an im
probably curvaceous Latina who
shares more than just a squad car
with him. From this brief intro the
film immediately flashes back to
the previous day and the multi
tude of events leading up to that
moment. We meet a varied as
sortment of L.A.*s denizens, all
victims or perpetrators of racist
tendencies.
It's clear that "Crash" intends
to provoke — "Live your life at
the point of impact," says the omi
nous tagline on the poster — but
for just what specific purpose re
mains unclear. Writer / director
Haggis has given us a perpetually
conflicted, eternally damned vi
sion of the world, where people
literally have no choice but to
think in black and white (and oc
casionally yellow).
Frankly it's not a world I
would want to live in, nor am I
convinced it accurately depicts
real-world L.A. "Open up your
eyes, man!" I'm sure Haggis
would scream at me. ''Racism is
EVERYWHERE!" Point taken,
but "Crash" is so earnest and in
i

bludgeoned with a health bar.
Credit should be given for the way
the film's storylines dole out equal
parts tragedy and salvation to its
characters, but even this might be
part of the problem; I can't fault
Haggis for wanting to avoid easy
solutions or heavy-handed moral
izing, but his assumption that
merely provoking people is a
noble aim in itself seems danger
ous. Instead of feeling enlight
ened afterwards I merely felt
threatened by Haggis's specific
perception of the world, and
maybe freshly paranoid of my
own.
In spite of its committed cast,
the multiple threads seem to ob
struct any real depth of under
standing. "Crash" wants to be a
"Magnolia" meets "Traffic" set in
the L.A. of "Collateral" type of
job, but given its tone and subject
1 found myself thinking it would
do better with fewer stories and a
more intimate scope in which to
play out its higher ambitions.
There are more than a few grip
ping situations in this movie —
Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe
do particularly well as a pair of
beat cops, one a veteran racist and
the other still an idealistic recruit,
and Michael Pena draws real em
pathy as a blue-collar locksmith
— but taken all together they
each seem robbed of weight.
And even while individual
performances click on and off,
there is seldom any excitement
felt in wondering what will hap
pen next, which characters will
run into each other; we just wait
for the movie to play its hand.
How the characters all crash to
gether is indeed a spectacle; whether
its worth the effort to process is an
other question.
Interview with Ryan Phillippe
By GREG LARSON
INTERMISSION BARFLY
As a valet in a tuxedo and a stovepipe
hat took my car, Ryan Phillippe's agent
met me in the portico of San Francisco's
Ritz Carlton.
"They're in the Promenade Room," he
said.
I was running late, so I rushed through
the lobby all a-fluster... but not before
first overhearing the agent tell the valet,
"Charge it to the Terry Heinz master ac
count."
Teresa Heinz Kerry?
Things became coherent in the Prome
nade Room, where Ryan Phillippe was a
ray of hot fucking sunshine. He sat next to
"Crash"'s writer / director Paul Haggis.
There were four other college interview
ers — one guy and three girls. All were
smitten with Ryan. I was initially embar
rassed about walking in late, but my
biggest worry now — and I could tell that
the other male interviewer was with me on
this one, and perhaps even Paul Haggis,
too — was that I'd pop an unsightly erec
tion.
In "Crash," Phillippe plays a rookie po
lice officer stuck in a squad car with a racist
partner (Matt Dillon). It's a serious role,
and his answers about it were equally seri
ous.
RP: "This movie is going to make you
think. So many these days require you to
just check your mind at the door, and you
sit and watch the pretty pictures. This
movie really hits you hard."
INT: When dealing with issues like racial
prejudice, there's a danger of sounding
preachy — how well do you think
"Crash" avoids the pitfall of moralism?
RP: "Paul [Haggis] treats the audience
with enough respect and intelligence to
let them make their own decisions. It's
great — far too often, you know, the
music starts to drum up. you're supposed
to get all teary and feel this way or that,
and it's all very black and white. Here
there are shades of gray. None of us are all
good or all bad, but we all have both with
in us."
"Crash" is Paul Haggis' directorial
debut. He wrote the screenplay for"Mil
lion Dollar Baby," but otherwise he's a
television man: His long list of accom
plishments is highlighted (or marred?) by
"Walker, Texas Ranger." for which he
was creator, head writer and executive
producer. Paul Haggis is — surprise! — a
white guv.
INT: "W F hat are the challenges of making
a movie about race when vou're white?"
PAUL HAGGIS:
"I asked the same
question to Terry
George when he
did 'Hotel Rwan-
da' - I was so
moved by it. but
then I saw Terry at
the festival — he's
* a white guy! So I
said 'Terry, inv god!
How the fuck did you
have the balls to write
and direct this movie?'
And he said, i waited
nine vears, and no one
else was doing it, so I had
to.'"
RP | who is also white): "I don't
care what color the characters are,
or what background they're from
— if you find a great new
story that needs
to be
told, that's the only issue."
After the interview, we were walking
out of the Promenade Room when 1 sud
denly found myself alone in the elevator
with Ryan Phillippe. He pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket.
"I asked that other interviewer for
some restaurant recommendations - I'm
not too familiar with San Francisco. Have
you heard of these?"
Two restaurants were scribbled on the
piece of paper: Lit Folie and Fleur de Lys.
"French restaurants."
"I fucking knew it! I'm not really feel
ing the pate foie gras."
We then sat down fora drink at the Ritz
Carlton bar.
1 didn't hear his order, but it was heavy
on the rum. 1 ordered a vodka tonic, but
since 1 knew I only had a $10 bill
in my wallet and this was the Ritz, 1 went
for their cheapest vodka — Vox.
Putting the tape recorder on a cocktail
napkin. I continued the interview.
INT: " What's it like being married
to another movie star, having
your life under public scruti
ny? I'm sure "Star Maga-
zine" and "US Weekly"
must really suck for you
Mmm, we re sure there are plenty of you out there that
would just to PULL THAT DRAWSTRING .

Racist cops. Minority cops.
Self-righteous thugs. Paranoid
immigrants. Privileged whites.
Privileged blacks. Paul Haggis's
"Crash" is a highly distilled
dystopia of racial conflict and mis
understanding. where everyone is
wary of everyone else — often for
all the right reasons. In short, it's
the first feel-good movie of the
year.
Don Cheadle plays Graham, a
black L.A. police detective arriv
ing at an unknown crime scene as
the movie opens. His partner is
Gia (Jennifer Rsposito), an im
probably curvaceous Latina who
shares more than just a squad car
with him. From this brief intro the
film immediately flashes back to
the previous day and the multi
tude of events leading up to that
moment. We meet a varied as
sortment of L.A.*s denizens, all
victims or perpetrators of racist
tendencies.
It's clear that "Crash" intends
to provoke — "Live your life at
the point of impact," says the omi
nous tagline on the poster — but
for just what specific purpose re
mains unclear. Writer / director
Haggis has given us a perpetually
conflicted, eternally damned vi
sion of the world, where people
literally have no choice but to
think in black and white (and oc
casionally yellow).
Frankly it's not a world I
would want to live in, nor am I
convinced it accurately depicts
real-world L.A. "Open up your
eyes, man!" I'm sure Haggis
would scream at me. ''Racism is
EVERYWHERE!" Point taken,
but "Crash" is so earnest and in
i

bludgeoned with a health bar.
Credit should be given for the way
the film's storylines dole out equal
parts tragedy and salvation to its
characters, but even this might be
part of the problem; I can't fault
Haggis for wanting to avoid easy
solutions or heavy-handed moral
izing, but his assumption that
merely provoking people is a
noble aim in itself seems danger
ous. Instead of feeling enlight
ened afterwards I merely felt
threatened by Haggis's specific
perception of the world, and
maybe freshly paranoid of my
own.
In spite of its committed cast,
the multiple threads seem to ob
struct any real depth of under
standing. "Crash" wants to be a
"Magnolia" meets "Traffic" set in
the L.A. of "Collateral" type of
job, but given its tone and subject
1 found myself thinking it would
do better with fewer stories and a
more intimate scope in which to
play out its higher ambitions.
There are more than a few grip
ping situations in this movie —
Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe
do particularly well as a pair of
beat cops, one a veteran racist and
the other still an idealistic recruit,
and Michael Pena draws real em
pathy as a blue-collar locksmith
— but taken all together they
each seem robbed of weight.
And even while individual
performances click on and off,
there is seldom any excitement
felt in wondering what will hap
pen next, which characters will
run into each other; we just wait
for the movie to play its hand.

Interview with Ryan Phillippe
By GREG LARSON
INTERMISSION BARFLY
As a valet in a tuxedo and a stovepipe
hat took my car, Ryan Phillippe's agent
met me in the portico of San Francisco's
Ritz Carlton.
"They're in the Promenade Room," he
said.
I was running late, so I rushed through
the lobby all a-fluster... but not before
first overhearing the agent tell the valet,
"Charge it to the Terry Heinz master ac
count."
Teresa Heinz Kerry?
Things became coherent in the Prome
nade Room, where Ryan Phillippe was a
ray of hot fucking sunshine. He sat next to
"Crash"'s writer / director Paul Haggis.
There were four other college interview
ers — one guy and three girls. All were
smitten with Ryan. I was initially embar
rassed about walking in late, but my
biggest worry now — and I could tell that
the other male interviewer was with me on
this one, and perhaps even Paul Haggis,
too — was that I'd pop an unsightly erec
tion.
In "Crash," Phillippe plays a rookie po
lice officer stuck in a squad car with a racist
partner (Matt Dillon). It's a serious role,
and his answers about it were equally seri
ous.
RP: "This movie is going to make you
think. So many these days require you to
just check your mind at the door, and you
sit and watch the pretty pictures. This
movie really hits you hard."
INT: When dealing with issues like racial
prejudice, there's a danger of sounding
preachy — how well do you think
"Crash" avoids the pitfall of moralism?
RP: "Paul [Haggis] treats the audience
with enough respect and intelligence to
let them make their own decisions. It's
great — far too often, you know, the
music starts to drum up. you're supposed
to get all teary and feel this way or that,
and it's all very black and white. Here
there are shades of gray. None of us are all
good or all bad, but we all have both with
in us."
"Crash" is Paul Haggis' directorial
debut. He wrote the screenplay for"Mil
lion Dollar Baby," but otherwise he's a
television man: His long list of accom
plishments is highlighted (or marred?) by
"Walker, Texas Ranger." for which he
was creator, head writer and executive
producer. Paul Haggis is — surprise! — a
white guv.
INT: "W F hat are the challenges of making
a movie about race when vou're white?"
PAUL HAGGIS:
"I asked the same
question to Terry
George when he
did 'Hotel Rwan-
da' - I was so
moved by it. but
then I saw Terry at
the festival — he's
* a white guy! So I
said 'Terry, inv god!
How the fuck did you
have the balls to write
and direct this movie?'
And he said, i waited
nine vears, and no one
else was doing it, so I had
to.'"
RP | who is also white): "I don't
care what color the characters are,
or what background they're from
— if you find a great new
story that needs
to be
told, that's the only issue."
After the interview, we were walking
out of the Promenade Room when 1 sud
denly found myself alone in the elevator
with Ryan Phillippe. He pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket.
"I asked that other interviewer for
some restaurant recommendations - I'm
not too familiar with San Francisco. Have
you heard of these?"
Two restaurants were scribbled on the
piece of paper: Lit Folie and Fleur de Lys.
"French restaurants."
"I fucking knew it! I'm not really feel
ing the pate foie gras."
We then sat down fora drink at the Ritz
Carlton bar.
1 didn't hear his order, but it was heavy
on the rum. 1 ordered a vodka tonic, but
since 1 knew I only had a $10 bill
in my wallet and this was the Ritz, 1 went
for their cheapest vodka — Vox.
Putting the tape recorder on a cocktail
napkin. I continued the interview.
INT: " What's it like being married
to another movie star, having
your life under public scruti
ny? I'm sure "Star Maga-
zine" and "US Weekly"
must really suck for you
Mmm, we re sure there are plenty of you out there that
would just to PULL THAT DRAWSTRING .

Racist cops. Minority cops.
Self-righteous thugs. Paranoid

Privileged blacks. Paul Haggis's
"Crash" is a highly distilled
dystopia of racial conflict and mis
understanding. where everyone is
wary of everyone else — often for
all the right reasons. In short, it's
the first feel-good movie of the
year.
Don Cheadle plays Graham, a
black L.A. police detective arriv
ing at an unknown crime scene as
the movie opens. His partner is
Gia (Jennifer Rsposito), an im
probably curvaceous Latina who
shares more than just a squad car
with him. From this brief intro the
film immediately flashes back to
the previous day and the multi
tude of events leading up to that
moment. We meet a varied as
sortment of L.A.*s denizens, all
victims or perpetrators of racist
tendencies.
It's clear that "Crash" intends
to provoke — "Live your life at
the point of impact," says the omi
nous tagline on the poster — but
for just what specific purpose re
mains unclear. Writer / director
Haggis has given us a perpetually
conflicted, eternally damned vi
sion of the world, where people
literally have no choice but to
think in black and white (and oc
casionally yellow).
Frankly it's not a world I
would want to live in, nor am I
convinced it accurately depicts
real-world L.A. "Open up your
eyes, man!" I'm sure Haggis
would scream at me. ''Racism is
EVERYWHERE!" Point taken,
but "Crash" is so earnest and in
i

bludgeoned with a health bar.
Credit should be given for the way
the film's storylines dole out equal
parts tragedy and salvation to its
characters, but even this might be
part of the problem; I can't fault
Haggis for wanting to avoid easy
solutions or heavy-handed moral
izing, but his assumption that
merely provoking people is a
noble aim in itself seems danger
ous. Instead of feeling enlight
ened afterwards I merely felt
threatened by Haggis's specific
perception of the world, and
maybe freshly paranoid of my
own.
In spite of its committed cast,
the multiple threads seem to ob
struct any real depth of under
standing. "Crash" wants to be a
"Magnolia" meets "Traffic" set in
the L.A. of "Collateral" type of
job, but given its tone and subject
1 found myself thinking it would
do better with fewer stories and a
more intimate scope in which to
play out its higher ambitions.
There are more than a few grip
ping situations in this movie —
Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe
do particularly well as a pair of
beat cops, one a veteran racist and
the other still an idealistic recruit,
and Michael Pena draws real em
pathy as a blue-collar locksmith
— but taken all together they
each seem robbed of weight.
And even while individual
performances click on and off,
there is seldom any excitement
felt in wondering what will hap
pen next, which characters will
run into each other; we just wait
for the movie to play its hand.

Interview with Ryan Phillippe
By GREG LARSON
INTERMISSION BARFLY
As a valet in a tuxedo and a stovepipe
hat took my car, Ryan Phillippe's agent
met me in the portico of San Francisco's
Ritz Carlton.
"They're in the Promenade Room," he
said.
I was running late, so I rushed through
the lobby all a-fluster... but not before
first overhearing the agent tell the valet,
"Charge it to the Terry Heinz master ac
count."
Teresa Heinz Kerry?
Things became coherent in the Prome
nade Room, where Ryan Phillippe was a
ray of hot fucking sunshine. He sat next to
"Crash"'s writer / director Paul Haggis.
There were four other college interview
ers — one guy and three girls. All were
smitten with Ryan. I was initially embar
rassed about walking in late, but my
biggest worry now — and I could tell that
the other male interviewer was with me on
this one, and perhaps even Paul Haggis,
too — was that I'd pop an unsightly erec
tion.
In "Crash," Phillippe plays a rookie po
lice officer stuck in a squad car with a racist
partner (Matt Dillon). It's a serious role,
and his answers about it were equally seri
ous.
RP: "This movie is going to make you
think. So many these days require you to
just check your mind at the door, and you
sit and watch the pretty pictures. This
movie really hits you hard."
INT: When dealing with issues like racial
prejudice, there's a danger of sounding
preachy — how well do you think
"Crash" avoids the pitfall of moralism?
RP: "Paul [Haggis] treats the audience
with enough respect and intelligence to
let them make their own decisions. It's
great — far too often, you know, the
music starts to drum up. you're supposed
to get all teary and feel this way or that,
and it's all very black and white. Here
there are shades of gray. None of us are all
good or all bad, but we all have both with
in us."
"Crash" is Paul Haggis' directorial
debut. He wrote the screenplay for"Mil
lion Dollar Baby," but otherwise he's a
television man: His long list of accom
plishments is highlighted (or marred?) by
"Walker, Texas Ranger." for which he
was creator, head writer and executive
producer. Paul Haggis is — surprise! — a
white guv.
INT: "W F hat are the challenges of making
a movie about race when vou're white?"
PAUL HAGGIS:
"I asked the same
question to Terry
George when he
did 'Hotel Rwan-
da' - I was so
moved by it. but
then I saw Terry at
the festival — he's
* a white guy! So I
said 'Terry, inv god!
How the fuck did you
have the balls to write
and direct this movie?'
And he said, i waited
nine vears, and no one
else was doing it, so I had
to.'"
RP | who is also white): "I don't
care what color the characters are,
or what background they're from
— if you find a great new
story that needs
to be
told, that's the only issue."
After the interview, we were walking
out of the Promenade Room when 1 sud
denly found myself alone in the elevator
with Ryan Phillippe. He pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket.
"I asked that other interviewer for
some restaurant recommendations - I'm
not too familiar with San Francisco. Have
you heard of these?"
Two restaurants were scribbled on the
piece of paper: Lit Folie and Fleur de Lys.
"French restaurants."
"I fucking knew it! I'm not really feel
ing the pate foie gras."
We then sat down fora drink at the Ritz
Carlton bar.
1 didn't hear his order, but it was heavy
on the rum. 1 ordered a vodka tonic, but
since 1 knew I only had a $10 bill
in my wallet and this was the Ritz, 1 went
for their cheapest vodka — Vox.
Putting the tape recorder on a cocktail
napkin. I continued the interview.
INT: " What's it like being married
to another movie star, having
your life under public scruti
ny? I'm sure "Star Maga-
zine" and "US Weekly"
must really suck for you
Mmm, we re sure there are plenty of you out there that
