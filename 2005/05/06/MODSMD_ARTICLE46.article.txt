# Interview with Ryan Phillippe
## 
### GREG LARSON INTERMISSION BARFLY 
As a valet in a tuxedo and a stovepipe
hat took my car, Ryan Phillippe's agent
met me in the portico of San Francisco's
Ritz Carlton.
"They're in the Promenade Room," he
said.
I was running late, so I rushed through
the lobby all a-fluster... but not before
first overhearing the agent tell the valet,
"Charge it to the Terry Heinz master ac
count."
Teresa Heinz Kerry?
Things became coherent in the Prome
nade Room, where Ryan Phillippe was a
ray of hot fucking sunshine. He sat next to
"Crash"'s writer / director Paul Haggis.
There were four other college interview
ers — one guy and three girls. All were
smitten with Ryan. I was initially embar
rassed about walking in late, but my
biggest worry now — and I could tell that
the other male interviewer was with me on
this one, and perhaps even Paul Haggis,
too — was that I'd pop an unsightly erec
tion.
In "Crash," Phillippe plays a rookie po
lice officer stuck in a squad car with a racist
partner (Matt Dillon). It's a serious role,
and his answers about it were equally seri

ous.
RP: "This movie is going to make you
think. So many these days require you to
just check your mind at the door, and you
sit and watch the pretty pictures. This
movie really hits you hard."
INT: When dealing with issues like racial
prejudice, there's a danger of sounding
preachy — how well do you think
"Crash" avoids the pitfall of moralism?
RP: "Paul [Haggis] treats the audience
with enough respect and intelligence to
let them make their own decisions. It's
great — far too often, you know, the
music starts to drum up. you're supposed
to get all teary and feel this way or that,
and it's all very black and white. Here
there are shades of gray. None of us are all
good or all bad, but we all have both with
in us."
"Crash" is Paul Haggis' directorial
debut. He wrote the screenplay for"Mil
lion Dollar Baby," but otherwise he's a
television man: His long list of accom
plishments is highlighted (or marred?) by
"Walker, Texas Ranger." for which he
was creator, head writer and executive
producer. Paul Haggis is — surprise! — a
white guv.
INT: "W F hat are the challenges of making
a movie about race when vou're white?"

PAUL HAGGIS:

"I asked the same
question to Terry
George when he
did 'Hotel Rwan-

da' - I was so
moved by it. but
then I saw Terry at
the festival — he's

* a white guy! So I
said 'Terry, inv god!
How the fuck did you
have the balls to write

and direct this movie?'
And he said, i waited
nine vears, and no one

else was doing it, so I had
to.'"

RP | who is also white): "I don't
care what color the characters are,
or what background they're from
— if you find a great new

story that needs
to be

told, that's the only issue."
After the interview, we were walking
out of the Promenade Room when 1 sud
denly found myself alone in the elevator
with Ryan Phillippe. He pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket.
"I asked that other interviewer for
some restaurant recommendations - I'm
not too familiar with San Francisco. Have
you heard of these?"
Two restaurants were scribbled on the
piece of paper: Lit Folie and Fleur de Lys.
"French restaurants."
"I fucking knew it! I'm not really feel
ing the pate foie gras."
We then sat down fora drink at the Ritz
Carlton bar.
1 didn't hear his order, but it was heavy
on the rum. 1 ordered a vodka tonic, but
since 1 knew I only had a $10 bill
in my wallet and this was the Ritz, 1 went
for their cheapest vodka — Vox.
Putting the tape recorder on a cocktail
napkin. I continued the interview.

INT: " What's it like being married
to another movie star, having

your life under public scruti
ny? I'm sure "Star Maga-

zine" and "US Weekly"
must really suck for you



Mmm, we re sure there are plenty of you out there that
would just to PULL THAT DRAWSTRING .
guys."
RP: "Well there's pictures, there's
gossip, but it's from afar-they don't
really know us, you know? If they can
piece together enough
innuendo and fabrications then they
have a story, but it's just their version
of things."
I must have been nervous, be
cause my vodka tonic was already
gone. Once Phillippe finished his rum
cocktail, he asked the bartender to fill
him another. He looked at me and
asked, "Do you have time fora sec
ond?"
"Um — yes. I'll have another."
"Ok," he said, "then you'll have to
upgrade your vodka."
"It's really just a student budget
thing."
"Relax, I got it."
He suggested I try the Belvedere,
at which point the bartender snapped
into action.
"Speaking of which," I said,
"everybody's saying this movie was a
low-budget indie deal — but the
Ritz? Not too shabby."
"Well, one thing is for sure: I
didn't get paid shit for this movie.
Maybe they're trying to make up for
it."
INT: "How did you prepare for your

Hotter than sliced
bread, and how!

role in "Crash"?
RP: "I did some ride-alongs with the
LAPD. The best part about that was
when I did it with Matt [Dillon]. I was
sitting up in front with the Lieu
tenant, wearing a hat, knowing I'd be
in a police car. But Matt, he sat in the
back, without a hat, so when we pull
up to a stoplight, some kid looks over
and sees Matt Dillon in the back of a
squad car. The first thing he does is
get out his cell phone and starts call
ing everyone he knows, telling them
Matt Dillon's been arrested."
The drinks were done. Ryan
Phillippe had won my heart, and I
wanted this interview to go on forev
er. I considered asking for his cell
phone number. But, alas, we parted
in the lobby. I was tipsy — the Ritz
isn't stingy with their cocktails —
and I wanted to end on a zinger.
"One more question. You and
your wife Reese Witherspoon just
have beautiful children, right?"
"Yeah, they're amazing."
"Do you ever get worried," I said,
"that your kids will grow
up, and one day they just might be
hotter than you?"
Ryan Phillippe kind of smiled.
"I don't know — we'll see, I guess.
Take care, man."

you heard of these?"
Two restaurants were scribbled on the
piece of paper: Lit Folie and Fleur de Lys.
"French restaurants."
"I fucking knew it! I'm not really feel

We then sat down fora drink at the Ritz
Carlton bar.
1 didn't hear his order, but it was heavy
on the rum. 1 ordered a vodka tonic, but
since 1 knew I only had a $10 bill
in my wallet and this was the Ritz, 1 went
for their cheapest vodka — Vox.

RP: "Well there's pictures, there's
gossip, but it's from afar-they don't
really know us, you know? If they can
piece together enough
innuendo and fabrications then they
have a story, but it's just their version
of things."
I must have been nervous, be
cause my vodka tonic was already
gone. Once Phillippe finished his rum
cocktail, he asked the bartender to fill
him another. He looked at me and
asked, "Do you have time fora sec
ond?"
"Um — yes. I'll have another."
"Ok," he said, "then you'll have to
upgrade your vodka."
"It's really just a student budget
thing."
"Relax, I got it."
He suggested I try the Belvedere,
at which point the bartender snapped
into action.
"Speaking of which," I said,
"everybody's saying this movie was a
low-budget indie deal — but the
Ritz? Not too shabby."
"Well, one thing is for sure: I
didn't get paid shit for this movie.
Maybe they're trying to make up for
it."
INT: "How did you prepare for your

role in "Crash"?
RP: "I did some ride-alongs with the
LAPD. The best part about that was
when I did it with Matt [Dillon]. I was
sitting up in front with the Lieu
tenant, wearing a hat, knowing I'd be
in a police car. But Matt, he sat in the
back, without a hat, so when we pull
up to a stoplight, some kid looks over
and sees Matt Dillon in the back of a
squad car. The first thing he does is
get out his cell phone and starts call
ing everyone he knows, telling them
Matt Dillon's been arrested."
The drinks were done. Ryan
Phillippe had won my heart, and I
wanted this interview to go on forev
er. I considered asking for his cell
phone number. But, alas, we parted
in the lobby. I was tipsy — the Ritz
isn't stingy with their cocktails —
and I wanted to end on a zinger.
"One more question. You and
your wife Reese Witherspoon just
have beautiful children, right?"
"Yeah, they're amazing."
"Do you ever get worried," I said,
"that your kids will grow
up, and one day they just might be
hotter than you?"
Ryan Phillippe kind of smiled.
"I don't know — we'll see, I guess.
Take care, man."
As a valet in a tuxedo and a stovepipe
hat took my car, Ryan Phillippe's agent
met me in the portico of San Francisco's
Ritz Carlton.
"They're in the Promenade Room," he
said.
I was running late, so I rushed through
the lobby all a-fluster... but not before
first overhearing the agent tell the valet,
"Charge it to the Terry Heinz master ac
count."
Teresa Heinz Kerry?
Things became coherent in the Prome
nade Room, where Ryan Phillippe was a
ray of hot fucking sunshine. He sat next to
"Crash"'s writer / director Paul Haggis.
There were four other college interview
ers — one guy and three girls. All were
smitten with Ryan. I was initially embar
rassed about walking in late, but my
biggest worry now — and I could tell that
the other male interviewer was with me on
this one, and perhaps even Paul Haggis,
too — was that I'd pop an unsightly erec
tion.
In "Crash," Phillippe plays a rookie po
lice officer stuck in a squad car with a racist
partner (Matt Dillon). It's a serious role,
and his answers about it were equally seri

ous.
RP: "This movie is going to make you
think. So many these days require you to
just check your mind at the door, and you
sit and watch the pretty pictures. This
movie really hits you hard."
INT: When dealing with issues like racial
prejudice, there's a danger of sounding
preachy — how well do you think
"Crash" avoids the pitfall of moralism?
RP: "Paul [Haggis] treats the audience
with enough respect and intelligence to
let them make their own decisions. It's
great — far too often, you know, the
music starts to drum up. you're supposed
to get all teary and feel this way or that,
and it's all very black and white. Here
there are shades of gray. None of us are all
good or all bad, but we all have both with
in us."
"Crash" is Paul Haggis' directorial
debut. He wrote the screenplay for"Mil
lion Dollar Baby," but otherwise he's a
television man: His long list of accom
plishments is highlighted (or marred?) by
"Walker, Texas Ranger." for which he
was creator, head writer and executive
producer. Paul Haggis is — surprise! — a
white guv.
INT: "W F hat are the challenges of making
a movie about race when vou're white?"

PAUL HAGGIS:

"I asked the same
question to Terry
George when he
did 'Hotel Rwan-

da' - I was so
moved by it. but
then I saw Terry at
the festival — he's

* a white guy! So I
said 'Terry, inv god!
How the fuck did you
have the balls to write

and direct this movie?'
And he said, i waited
nine vears, and no one

else was doing it, so I had
to.'"

RP | who is also white): "I don't
care what color the characters are,
or what background they're from
— if you find a great new

story that needs
to be

told, that's the only issue."
After the interview, we were walking
out of the Promenade Room when 1 sud
denly found myself alone in the elevator
with Ryan Phillippe. He pulled a piece of
paper out of his pocket.
"I asked that other interviewer for
some restaurant recommendations - I'm
not too familiar with San Francisco. Have
you heard of these?"
