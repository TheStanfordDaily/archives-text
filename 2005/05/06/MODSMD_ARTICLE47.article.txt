On April lU, Intermission got a chance to sit down with Seih Mac
farlane fora very personal interview. And hy that, we mean Intermis
sion had a chance to participate in a massive national conference call.
Still, Seth is a fascinating guy. So without further delay. Intermission is
pleased to bring you our interview with the creator of the much
beloved "Family Guy" and the up and coming "American Dad."
INTERMISSION: So how do you respond (o those that question the
decision to return to Fox for season four?
SETH M ACFARI.ANE; The sh< jw is still going to be ou Oartt»on Net
work and it'll air on Fox and on ('artoon Network and on TBS. Even
it the show is not a success on Fox. it could continue to have a hie on
Cartoon Network. I he financial reality is that in order to really do the
show the way we did it before with the number of writers we have,
which you need to generate the amount of jokes that we do on a week
ly basis, to the live orchestra that allows us to do all our musical num
bers, you really can only do that with a network.
INT; So now, we've touched on they said that it's TBS and DVD sales
and Adult Swim that helped resurrect "Family (iuv," What do you
think personally brought it back'.'
SIM I mean that's it. 'Phone are the two. to me. and I think ol the studio
that the two main reasons that the show is back It was a combination
of DVI) sales that surpassed anyone's expectations, including mute, by
a long shot anil the fact that the show was topping Leno and Letlcrmaii
in those adult male demo* on Cartoon Network.
Iliose t W'O coupled together, I think lor everyone involved, was re
ally nothing to sneeze out and they really kind«»l made everyone take
a second look
INT So now why did you choose to create a more political cartoon
with American Dad alter the fun that everyone enjoyed from Family
(iiiy, which is pictiv etxy going «u<i nu-llow''
SM Part ol it was you don't want to do the same show twice You do
want to do something different "Family Guy" was created during the
Clinton years. Obviously, thin j* a much more polarized political cli
mate that we're now and it just seemed like the right time to do a show
tike this, "All in the Family" worked so well in the '70s during what.was.
I think, a very similarly polarized climate and it seemed like the right
time to do show tike this
"American Dud," at the end of the day, it is still about this family
and the fact that he works in the political arena, it's more color At ihe
end ol day, if the stories were about politics, it would make it less char
inter driven We don't want it to J*, preachy m any way, lire stories
are still family stories. It's just iho backdrop is more political
INI S. »now, I hear that you have a "Family Guy" movie coming out
Dun i \t mi think it's a hull strange that, even a show like the " Hi.
Simpsons," they've never had a movie, What made you decide to make
a "Family (iuy" film''
SM ' Flu Simpsons," the reason that they haven't done it i* lime, 1
know tlu ie arc certainly people theie who wanted to do.that lot.»long
lime, but |ust the physical reality of getting even one animated show
lit>ne«»n a weekly basis, there's so much to d<», and thet e\ no hiatus ami
vou pretty much go year around, that its just time II it were a llteatri
cal ielea.se. ii would be very different. We wouldn't have been able to
do it I his is directed video release What it was is essentially the pro
diii lion ptocett lor three episode# dial are actually a movie.
INI' So now. it "son video, but arc you going to lie able to curse and do
a lot o| naughty animated things that you weren't allowed to do on

Fox?
SM It's interesting that there is a question, are we going to do a tacior
version and a cleaner version".' The only thing that would be different
ori the racier version is language. The show is what ii
is. We're not "South Park;" we don't get
that racy. At the end of the dav, wc

don't want the show to
change.

INT: And when is

that coming out?
SM It's coming out later this
ye a i 1 don't think we have an actu
al release dale yet.

INT. All right S» i n« »w ahoutyou, I want to Kin >w. w»mlU you like
totfyiklingoulsldcol doing the .tuminUd voius and pul I hut votot
i»l yours to work on the Mgacrwn or somethingdue'?
SM I think anyone who hud sent my guest spotN on I nii.*i |»i im- would
say prohuhly, no I don i know, hut I have a htig< flare lot ou caiuecji
acting. | haven't ifully
INI' I |ik< <1 you <iii Adult Swim I thought you were funny, just a jt'rk

with a little pipe und everything. I thought. ... I was like, he's realty not
like thiit; I l>ct he's just acting.
SM:I was doing a character.

INT: See, you can do it.

SM; 112 n movies, you have to he
yourself on camera, That's
just 100 damn difficult.

INI So now. in "Family
fitiy." I noticed thai you're al
ways picking on the Irish, hut isn't
Macl atlarie Scottish''

SM 11 is
INT'; Sec I knew it I told them,
SM Yes I hat $ why I piek on ihr Irish

one equally
INI Do me a favor , pick on black people more, okay'.'
SM AH right
INT: Because 1 like lhat I'm black
SM, We have a wonderful episode, "Parody of Roots." in the upcom
ing season.
INT: Really quickly, how much would you say thai Monty Python has
been an influence in your show?
SM: I think that 's definitely an influence. It's a very bizarre random out
of lelt field type of comedy Monty Python. "The Far Side," I think
those arc both influences as far as "Family (iuy" is concerned.
INT Do you have any advice h>r networks as far as tapping in to that
audience that made your show such a hit on cable and on DVD*'
SM: It's interesting. 112 or that reason, we're writing 'lie same as we al
way* have, As I've '.aid before, we do write for adults, 'I here are
enough Bob Hope references thai I think younger viewers may not
get. Again, I'm always surprised when younger viewers do respond to
these shows because there really are a lot of very old dated references.
Hveiy writer in that room is over 30, li is what ii is. We haven't changed
anything We're still writing to the adult audience.
As far as network executives, lo me, the bent thing they can do is put
the show on a consistent time slot and keep it there, I think the show
will do the rest, If it's worthy, il we've done our job, then people will
watch and il they don't, then we shouldn't be on the air anyway, I think
the audience is what il is arid we have uot changed anything about the
show, Either they'll continue to respond o> they'll check out I lie show
1 1 sell ha* not changed We haven I changed our writing style at -ill
INT; It seems like the more screwed up thing* arc in the world easier,
it makes your job as a satirist. How easy do you think it was than to
< ome up with new materials h h the new episodes and American I )ad?
SM: 11 s never easy, but when there's more going on m the political
arena and when it's more lively around here, yes. it does get linle ew
ici I here ignore sluli "American Dad," the fact that the country
is so polarized, il just kind of pointed tight lo a show like "American
Dad." It remains to be seen whether something lhat I'm not compar*
mi;.- us lo "All m lltr I, irmly" bceause H* -i very <lilt' rent .how and
that's like the greatest sitcom ever So we can only hop' ty>dohalt iln
job thai they did
We are pretty careful to satirize both extremes. It is Hollywood, so
obviously there are a lot of liberals. But we've all, including mc, made
a conscious effort not to cotltc oil like liberal* We do try and saliri/«.
both sides I he knee, jerk flag waving pcrs< inality ol Sian and the Haley

There is much rejoicing.







On April lU, Intermission got a chance to sit down with Seih Mac
farlane fora very personal interview. And hy that, we mean Intermis
sion had a chance to participate in a massive national conference call.
Still, Seth is a fascinating guy. So without further delay. Intermission is
pleased to bring you our interview with the creator of the much
beloved "Family Guy" and the up and coming "American Dad."
INTERMISSION: So how do you respond (o those that question the
decision to return to Fox for season four?
SETH M ACFARI.ANE; The sh< jw is still going to be ou Oartt»on Net
work and it'll air on Fox and on ('artoon Network and on TBS. Even
it the show is not a success on Fox. it could continue to have a hie on
Cartoon Network. I he financial reality is that in order to really do the
show the way we did it before with the number of writers we have,
which you need to generate the amount of jokes that we do on a week
ly basis, to the live orchestra that allows us to do all our musical num
bers, you really can only do that with a network.
INT; So now, we've touched on they said that it's TBS and DVD sales
and Adult Swim that helped resurrect "Family (iuv," What do you
think personally brought it back'.'
SIM I mean that's it. 'Phone are the two. to me. and I think ol the studio
that the two main reasons that the show is back It was a combination
of DVI) sales that surpassed anyone's expectations, including mute, by
a long shot anil the fact that the show was topping Leno and Letlcrmaii
in those adult male demo* on Cartoon Network.
Iliose t W'O coupled together, I think lor everyone involved, was re
ally nothing to sneeze out and they really kind«»l made everyone take
a second look
INT So now why did you choose to create a more political cartoon
with American Dad alter the fun that everyone enjoyed from Family
(iiiy, which is pictiv etxy going «u<i nu-llow''
SM Part ol it was you don't want to do the same show twice You do
want to do something different "Family Guy" was created during the
Clinton years. Obviously, thin j* a much more polarized political cli
mate that we're now and it just seemed like the right time to do a show
tike this, "All in the Family" worked so well in the '70s during what.was.
I think, a very similarly polarized climate and it seemed like the right
time to do show tike this
"American Dud," at the end of the day, it is still about this family
and the fact that he works in the political arena, it's more color At ihe
end ol day, if the stories were about politics, it would make it less char
inter driven We don't want it to J*, preachy m any way, lire stories
are still family stories. It's just iho backdrop is more political
INI S. »now, I hear that you have a "Family Guy" movie coming out
Dun i \t mi think it's a hull strange that, even a show like the " Hi.
Simpsons," they've never had a movie, What made you decide to make
a "Family (iuy" film''
SM ' Flu Simpsons," the reason that they haven't done it i* lime, 1
know tlu ie arc certainly people theie who wanted to do.that lot.»long
lime, but |ust the physical reality of getting even one animated show
lit>ne«»n a weekly basis, there's so much to d<», and thet e\ no hiatus ami
vou pretty much go year around, that its just time II it were a llteatri
cal ielea.se. ii would be very different. We wouldn't have been able to
do it I his is directed video release What it was is essentially the pro
diii lion ptocett lor three episode# dial are actually a movie.
INI' So now. it "son video, but arc you going to lie able to curse and do
a lot o| naughty animated things that you weren't allowed to do on

Fox?
SM It's interesting that there is a question, are we going to do a tacior
version and a cleaner version".' The only thing that would be different
ori the racier version is language. The show is what ii
is. We're not "South Park;" we don't get
that racy. At the end of the dav, wc

don't want the show to
change.

INT: And when is

that coming out?
SM It's coming out later this
ye a i 1 don't think we have an actu
al release dale yet.

INT. All right S» i n« »w ahoutyou, I want to Kin >w. w»mlU you like
totfyiklingoulsldcol doing the .tuminUd voius and pul I hut votot
i»l yours to work on the Mgacrwn or somethingdue'?
SM I think anyone who hud sent my guest spotN on I nii.*i |»i im- would
say prohuhly, no I don i know, hut I have a htig< flare lot ou caiuecji
acting. | haven't ifully
INI' I |ik< <1 you <iii Adult Swim I thought you were funny, just a jt'rk

with a little pipe und everything. I thought. ... I was like, he's realty not
like thiit; I l>ct he's just acting.
SM:I was doing a character.

INT: See, you can do it.

SM; 112 n movies, you have to he
yourself on camera, That's
just 100 damn difficult.

INI So now. in "Family
fitiy." I noticed thai you're al
ways picking on the Irish, hut isn't
Macl atlarie Scottish''

SM 11 is
INT'; Sec I knew it I told them,
SM Yes I hat $ why I piek on ihr Irish

one equally
INI Do me a favor , pick on black people more, okay'.'
SM AH right
INT: Because 1 like lhat I'm black
SM, We have a wonderful episode, "Parody of Roots." in the upcom
ing season.
INT: Really quickly, how much would you say thai Monty Python has
been an influence in your show?
SM: I think that 's definitely an influence. It's a very bizarre random out
of lelt field type of comedy Monty Python. "The Far Side," I think
those arc both influences as far as "Family (iuy" is concerned.
INT Do you have any advice h>r networks as far as tapping in to that
audience that made your show such a hit on cable and on DVD*'
SM: It's interesting. 112 or that reason, we're writing 'lie same as we al
way* have, As I've '.aid before, we do write for adults, 'I here are
enough Bob Hope references thai I think younger viewers may not
get. Again, I'm always surprised when younger viewers do respond to
these shows because there really are a lot of very old dated references.
Hveiy writer in that room is over 30, li is what ii is. We haven't changed
anything We're still writing to the adult audience.
As far as network executives, lo me, the bent thing they can do is put
the show on a consistent time slot and keep it there, I think the show
will do the rest, If it's worthy, il we've done our job, then people will
watch and il they don't, then we shouldn't be on the air anyway, I think
the audience is what il is arid we have uot changed anything about the
show, Either they'll continue to respond o> they'll check out I lie show
1 1 sell ha* not changed We haven I changed our writing style at -ill
INT; It seems like the more screwed up thing* arc in the world easier,
it makes your job as a satirist. How easy do you think it was than to
< ome up with new materials h h the new episodes and American I )ad?
SM: 11 s never easy, but when there's more going on m the political
arena and when it's more lively around here, yes. it does get linle ew

On April lU, Intermission got a chance to sit down with Seih Mac
farlane fora very personal interview. And hy that, we mean Intermis
sion had a chance to participate in a massive national conference call.
Still, Seth is a fascinating guy. So without further delay. Intermission is
pleased to bring you our interview with the creator of the much
beloved "Family Guy" and the up and coming "American Dad."
INTERMISSION: So how do you respond (o those that question the
decision to return to Fox for season four?
SETH M ACFARI.ANE; The sh< jw is still going to be ou Oartt»on Net
work and it'll air on Fox and on ('artoon Network and on TBS. Even
it the show is not a success on Fox. it could continue to have a hie on
Cartoon Network. I he financial reality is that in order to really do the
show the way we did it before with the number of writers we have,
which you need to generate the amount of jokes that we do on a week
ly basis, to the live orchestra that allows us to do all our musical num
bers, you really can only do that with a network.
INT; So now, we've touched on they said that it's TBS and DVD sales
and Adult Swim that helped resurrect "Family (iuv," What do you
think personally brought it back'.'
SIM I mean that's it. 'Phone are the two. to me. and I think ol the studio
that the two main reasons that the show is back It was a combination
of DVI) sales that surpassed anyone's expectations, including mute, by
a long shot anil the fact that the show was topping Leno and Letlcrmaii
in those adult male demo* on Cartoon Network.
Iliose t W'O coupled together, I think lor everyone involved, was re
ally nothing to sneeze out and they really kind«»l made everyone take
a second look
INT So now why did you choose to create a more political cartoon
with American Dad alter the fun that everyone enjoyed from Family
(iiiy, which is pictiv etxy going «u<i nu-llow''
SM Part ol it was you don't want to do the same show twice You do
want to do something different "Family Guy" was created during the
Clinton years. Obviously, thin j* a much more polarized political cli
mate that we're now and it just seemed like the right time to do a show
tike this, "All in the Family" worked so well in the '70s during what.was.
I think, a very similarly polarized climate and it seemed like the right
time to do show tike this
"American Dud," at the end of the day, it is still about this family
and the fact that he works in the political arena, it's more color At ihe
end ol day, if the stories were about politics, it would make it less char
inter driven We don't want it to J*, preachy m any way, lire stories
are still family stories. It's just iho backdrop is more political
INI S. »now, I hear that you have a "Family Guy" movie coming out
Dun i \t mi think it's a hull strange that, even a show like the " Hi.
Simpsons," they've never had a movie, What made you decide to make
a "Family (iuy" film''
SM ' Flu Simpsons," the reason that they haven't done it i* lime, 1
know tlu ie arc certainly people theie who wanted to do.that lot.»long
lime, but |ust the physical reality of getting even one animated show
lit>ne«»n a weekly basis, there's so much to d<», and thet e\ no hiatus ami
vou pretty much go year around, that its just time II it were a llteatri
cal ielea.se. ii would be very different. We wouldn't have been able to
do it I his is directed video release What it was is essentially the pro
diii lion ptocett lor three episode# dial are actually a movie.
INI' So now. it "son video, but arc you going to lie able to curse and do
a lot o| naughty animated things that you weren't allowed to do on

Fox?
SM It's interesting that there is a question, are we going to do a tacior
version and a cleaner version".' The only thing that would be different
ori the racier version is language. The show is what ii
is. We're not "South Park;" we don't get
that racy. At the end of the dav, wc

don't want the show to
change.

INT: And when is

that coming out?
SM It's coming out later this
ye a i 1 don't think we have an actu
al release dale yet.

INT. All right S» i n« »w ahoutyou, I want to Kin >w. w»mlU you like
totfyiklingoulsldcol doing the .tuminUd voius and pul I hut votot

SM:I was doing a character.

INT: See, you can do it.

SM; 112 n movies, you have to he
yourself on camera, That's
just 100 damn difficult.

INI So now. in "Family

SM AH right
INT: Because 1 like lhat I'm black
SM, We have a wonderful episode, "Parody of Roots." in the upcom
ing season.
INT: Really quickly, how much would you say thai Monty Python has
been an influence in your show?
SM: I think that 's definitely an influence. It's a very bizarre random out
of lelt field type of comedy Monty Python. "The Far Side," I think
those arc both influences as far as "Family (iuy" is concerned.
INT Do you have any advice h>r networks as far as tapping in to that
audience that made your show such a hit on cable and on DVD*'
SM: It's interesting. 112 or that reason, we're writing 'lie same as we al
way* have, As I've '.aid before, we do write for adults, 'I here are
