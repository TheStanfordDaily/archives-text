## Who wants more of Moore? 
### JENNIE KIM INTERMISSION QUESTION-ASKER 
Republicans outnumber Democrats 12-to-l in
Orem County, UT, which bills itself as "Family
City, U.S.A." Paying Michael Moore to speak
there, just two weeks before the 2(X)4 Presiden
tial Election, would be about as logical as hold
ing the Republican National Convention in a
place filled with crazy-ass liberals, like say. New
York City.
Well, it seems that anything is possible, be
cause both actually happened. Plus, the Sox won
the pennant.Luckily, filmmaker Steven Green
street was able to capture the whole kerfuffle
last September, when Orem's Utah Valley State
College, or IiVSC, invited Moore to come on
over. In addition to featuring some truly cata
tonic Utahans, Greenstreet's documentary,
"This Divided State," depicts the greater battle
over the First Amendment. Some want to pre
serve the right to free speech by extending it to
all - chubby liberal filmmakers included. Others
want to protect it by putting it into a sturdy glass
jar - you know, for safekeeping - and then doling
it out on a kind of penury schedule.Stanford was

stop No. 21 on Greenstreet's
cross-country tour to pro-

mote "This Divided
State," which comes out
011 DVD late summer
and looks forward to lim-

ited theatrical release in
the fall. Check out thisdi
videdstate.com for more

information.Following an
on-campus screening last

Tuesday, Greenstreet sat
down with Intermission to
discuss Michael Moore, get
ting sued and the breakdown
of civil discourse in America.

INTERMISSION: How was
"This Divided State" born?
STEVEN GREENSTREET:
My friends and 1 run a produc
tion company in Provo, Minori
ty Films, so we got faxed the
press release about Michael
Moore coming to UVSC, i
which is four miles away in I

Orem. We took one look
at the fax and said, "Peo-

ple are going to start yelling
at eaeh other, like, today — let's

go down there."! guess it came
out of a filmmaker's intuition just to

start rolling
camera and
see what hap
pened. Actu
ally. one of the
main things I
wanted to do
in this film was
go hack to the

grassroots methods of mak
ing documentaries. For ex
ample, I don't narrate this
documentary like Michael
Moore does in his. I just let
the camera roll, then see
what happens.
INT: What drew your inter
est to this topic?

S(J: There's a
number of
reasons why

I was in
trigued by
it. First, you
can't help

but notice
the reli
gious influ
, ence, the
Mormon
i influence
on the
events in

the film.
Having a
Mormon
upbring-

ing myself, I
was personally

r
intrigued by that.
Also, after looking

at all the footage. I realized that it served as a
powerful message of how free speech is a deli
cate subject in America — how people mistreat
it, misunderstand it, and how they misunder
stand each other. Nobody in the film acted in a
gentlemanly way. They didn't take time to sit
down, shake hands and try to understand each
other.
INT: So the moral of the story is?

SCi:That civil discourse failed miserably. People
didn't even try to get along.
INT: Why do you think the situation turned out
to he such a screaming mess?
S(i: The real issue was that Michael Moore
didn't "represent the community," so he

shouldn't be heard. But he did. in fact, represent
a minority in that county, and the idea that we
should only hear the majority voice is fascist.
INT: Have you heard from Michael Moore yet?
SG: Yeah, actually, Michael Moore called me
three weeks ago, and said he had heard about
the movie. I sent him a copy of it. He was sooo
pissed off about what happened at the end.
INT: There's a perpetually angry man who stars
in the documentary. Do you ever run into him,
like at the grocery store?
SG: Well, I haven't really been home because
I've been on tour for the movie, but he did file
two lawsuits against me. He filed a restraining
order against the film to prevent it from getting
shown in public. He also filed one against me,
personally. He had signed a release form for it,
but he tried to revoke his signature after the film
was done and people who had watched it were
asking, "Who is this guy, and why is he such an
asshole?" I had to hire a legal team because he
threatened to sue. but he eventually dropped the
suit.
INT. What's your next project?
SG: I've started working on a general documen
tary about oil because we hear about it all the
time —why does it cost so much? Why do the
prices fluctuate? Why are we drilling in Alaska?
But people don't really seem to know the an
swers. I also want to do a documentary about the
reason why Bush won. which, like "The Divided
State," reflects the religious divide in America
right now.




Michael Moore: There is no better person to criticize ihe
over-indulgences of corporate Amenca, right? Go ask
McDonald's.
