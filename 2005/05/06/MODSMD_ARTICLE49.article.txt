## Sass Attack! They Lickees Everything, But Balls 
### KARANMAHAJAN INDIE MUSIC EXPERT 
111 the time between I conducted this interview with The Lickees,
and the time it took for our words to steam off the Daily's presses,
these fiery-fashionista rockers had recorded a song called, get this:
FUCK THE INTERVIEW. Now, a lesser writer with a more ten
der ego might well have sabotaged this campus band's future in a fit
of personalized fury, but me? 1 was fucking enthralled. This is ex
actly the sort of snickering disregard for authority that made me
single-handedly rescue floundering bands like Radiohead, Le
Tigre, The Strokes, The Velvet Underground and The Libertines

from their yolks of obscurity — and I'll be damned if mv influential
career as a music critic doesn't culminate in the rock-n-roll corona
tion of The Lickees. After all, it's one thing to say on one's Web site
that "WE DONT LICK BALLS," but it's quite another thing to
simply chew these aforementioned testicles right off with savage
guitar riffc and spermicidal screaming. It's one thing to practice pro
fessionally, and quite another thing to drown your EV apartment
in a tantrum of thrift-score clothing and neighbor-deafening drum
ming- gggfe
its one thiitg to be a riot girl band, and quite another thing to
riot.

St), to a cut a long album review short: y<hi ought to huv into the
concept, because the album doesn't exist yet. And 10introduce the de
cidedly-fucked interview: I sat down with the band in then EV hide
out to discuss their upcoming Tuiropean tour, plans fora sophpnu >re
album, their glorious website ( http://www.stanford.«lu/~aini2( >05 )
and to generally revel in their overwhelming hotness. Trfempstirring
collective consists Anna Letish Mumford, Wendy. Molly Goldberg,
Bonnie Johnson, Joseles De La Cruz, Mari Hayman (part-time band
members) and Natalie RuizTofano, 1 hmter Hargraves, Masha I -isak.
John Yandell, Michalina Rinkus (full-time groupees).
Hear us out.

INTERMISSION: Where did the name Lickees
come from?
LICKEES: We were sitting around drinking one
night and came up with the name. It actually comes
from "We Don't Lick Balls." hut then we stalled
to think about the fact that we're not actually that
opposed to the concept of licking balls. We're into
sexual liberation and we're aware of the fact that
some members of the band actually feel more
comfortable licking balls.
INT: When I entered the room 1 heard Metric
playing. What are your other musical influences?
What lalx-l &re you signed with ?
L: 'nicies currently an epic battle between K
Ravrds and Kill Rock Stars to sign the Lickees.
V'e'rc just holding out right no>v.^ye f ,|ujght start

up and coming indcpendenttalcht let uSKrtdW. Or
no talent —jusUots of enthusiasm.

INT: Speaking of performing live, how do you rec
oncile those tensions between your non-hierarchi
cal instincts and being up on stage?
L: We've also talked about doing what Lighting
Bolt does — just playing on the floor in the middle
of the audience. 'Cause we like that idea. Our
groupies get lonely when we're playing on stage
and they want people to dance with.
INT 1 m overwhelmed by the band's fashion

111 the time between I conducted this interview with The Lickees,
and the time it took for our words to steam off the Daily's presses,
these fiery-fashionista rockers had recorded a song called, get this:
FUCK THE INTERVIEW. Now, a lesser writer with a more ten
der ego might well have sabotaged this campus band's future in a fit
of personalized fury, but me? 1 was fucking enthralled. This is ex
actly the sort of snickering disregard for authority that made me
single-handedly rescue floundering bands like Radiohead, Le
Tigre, The Strokes, The Velvet Underground and The Libertines

from their yolks of obscurity — and I'll be damned if mv influential
career as a music critic doesn't culminate in the rock-n-roll corona
tion of The Lickees. After all, it's one thing to say on one's Web site
that "WE DONT LICK BALLS," but it's quite another thing to
simply chew these aforementioned testicles right off with savage
guitar riffc and spermicidal screaming. It's one thing to practice pro
fessionally, and quite another thing to drown your EV apartment
in a tantrum of thrift-score clothing and neighbor-deafening drum
ming- gggfe
its one thiitg to be a riot girl band, and quite another thing to
riot.

St), to a cut a long album review short: y<hi ought to huv into the
concept, because the album doesn't exist yet. And 10introduce the de
cidedly-fucked interview: I sat down with the band in then EV hide
out to discuss their upcoming Tuiropean tour, plans fora sophpnu >re
album, their glorious website ( http://www.stanford.«lu/~aini2( >05 )
and to generally revel in their overwhelming hotness. Trfempstirring
collective consists Anna Letish Mumford, Wendy. Molly Goldberg,
Bonnie Johnson, Joseles De La Cruz, Mari Hayman (part-time band
members) and Natalie RuizTofano, 1 hmter Hargraves, Masha I -isak.
John Yandell, Michalina Rinkus (full-time groupees).
Hear us out.

INTERMISSION: Where did the name Lickees
come from?
LICKEES: We were sitting around drinking one
night and came up with the name. It actually comes
from "We Don't Lick Balls." hut then we stalled
to think about the fact that we're not actually that
opposed to the concept of licking balls. We're into
sexual liberation and we're aware of the fact that
some members of the band actually feel more
comfortable licking balls.
INT: When I entered the room 1 heard Metric
playing. What are your other musical influences?
What lalx-l &re you signed with ?
L: 'nicies currently an epic battle between K
Ravrds and Kill Rock Stars to sign the Lickees.
V'e'rc just holding out right no>v.^ye f ,|ujght start
are own label "lick or be licked."' any
up and coming indcpendenttalcht let uSKrtdW. Or
no talent —jusUots of enthusiasm.
INT: Speakiqgof which, I've never seen so much

hype prefifiAif a band that's

never before. I
