### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, DOUBLE AGENT 
If you don't want a commitment, why have one?
We all know that "friend with benefits" is the top
rung of the ladder theory. So this week's advice is on
how to keep multiple "open" relationships going.
Roxy's not a player, she's a relations opportunist.
In order to pull this off, you'll need some help.
The most useful item you can procure is an identi
cal twin sibling, or, barring that, a really good
wingman. When it comes down to dealing with
your many relationships, public events are actual

ly good places to be. You may think one option
will see you there with another person. Yeah â€”
they'll see you and about 300 other people. Keep
all your conversations short and don't stray far
from your wingman. His need to get a beer or her
need to hit the bathroom can always save you if an
other prospect is close by. You can, of course, al
ways let them know "you'll be right back." And
who knows ... maybe you will be.
There's no need to choose who you are going
home with until the music stops and the lights flick
er on. However, the earlier you leave, the easier it is
to get away and the more options you have later on.

Once you've made your choice, check to see that the
coast is clear and move with conviction. Don't get
caught up when that redheaded kid from your fresh-

man dorm wants to take a stroll down
memory lane. Pretend you didn't hear
him, push that sweaty football player out
of your way and hit the road.
The next day you can explain your
disappearance from the party a few dif
ferent ways. If they saw you leave with
another option, play dumb. You were
drunk and certainly don't really remem
ber when you left. "You saw me leave at

one? 1 think I was
still at the party 'til
almost two." If you
weren't spotted,
you helped walk a
drunk friend home.
Not only are you in
the clear, you're
also a Good Samar
itan. Give yourself
a pat on the back.
All of this
seem like child's
play to you so far?
Well Roxy's here
to help you pull a
special trick: get
ting with two
lovers in one night.
Not at the same

time, but one after
the other. This takes consider
ably more skill than pulling off
a threesome with some less
than-impressive date and their

roommate. Here's where the quality of your wing
man comes into play.
Once you have your first partner engaged in the

throws of pas
sion, flip them
over doggy-style
and quickly
think-up a reason
to pull out.
You're going to
climax too soon,
you just need to
readjust, whatev
er. Pull out,
stealthily back
away from your
partner and usher
in your wingman.
Who said playing
wingman was a
thankless job?
Your sidekick
picks up where
you left off, leav
ing your first date
none the wiser.
If you're
feeling especially
bold, position
your partner so
that they are look
ing outside their
dorm window.
After you've

made the switch and are on your way back to the
party, stop and wave to them. Those in the know call
this the Houdini. "If you're outside, then who's
doing me?" Simply hilarious!


Bondage with this guy? Not quite as appealing as it
would be with Tiger Woods' wile.
