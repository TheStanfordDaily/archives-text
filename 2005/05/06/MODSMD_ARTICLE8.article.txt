## Symposium finds the art in metropolis 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
The visually and emotionally startling images gen
erated by the abrupt collapse of the World Trade Cen
ter and civil conflicts in Bosnia have prompted two
members of the film and media faculty to organize a
public symposium. Participants in the conference can
examine how society's ever-changing perception of
contemporary urban living is being depicted in the
media.
The event, entitled "Urban Trauma and the
Metropolitan Imagination." also marks the emerging
trend of film and media studies being brought into the
mainstream of the University. Students can major in
film and media studies through the Art and Art Histo
ry Department for the first time beginning in the fall.
Art Profs. Scott Bukatman and Pavle Levi have as
sembled a group on campus of movie makers, film crit
ics. architects, scholars and even comic artists. In the
next two days, these media and film experts will care
fully explore the political and social catalysts for
change in metropolitan experiences. They will also
scrutinize the presentation of metropolitanism as seen
in different visual outlets — especially in a world they
consider to be filled with traumas and drastic transfor
mations.
"These urban upheavals make us think and rethink

about our cities today and those in the future," Levi
said. "The discussion will look at the way in which
cities are imagined and depicted in response to cultur
al, political and economic forces."
In particular, two film directors from the Bosnian
city of Sarajevo will offer views on how the civil war
there in the 1990s has transformed their vision on
urban life. The panel discussion will take place in Cub
berley Auditorium today from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

" "Summer in the Golden Valley' intends to show
how wars can change a city into a very hostile territo
ry," said one of the Bosnian directors, Srdjan Vuletic,
referring to his film that was screened in the Aquarius
Theatre in Palo Alto last night. "It sheds light on the
bad side of a city in a postwar era."

maker Ernie Gehr will appear in a
special event in Cubherley tonight,
in which Katchor will read his pic
ture stories and Gehr's 1991 film
"Side / Walk / Shuttle" will be
screened.
Bukatman stressed that while
New York, along with Sarajevo,
serves as a major paradigm in the
symposium, the event is not mere
ly a case study of how the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks changed the fabric
of New York's metropolitan life.
"We don't want 9/11 to be treat
ed as an isolated incident," he said.
"We want it to be understood in
the international context, across
culture and media."
Krysia Zajonc, a sophomore
who is planning to major in film
and media studies, said she wel
comes the intellectual challenge
posed by the symposium and looks
forward to meeting with a diversity
of filmmakers.
"Our generation has always
been associated with political apa
thy-now there's a war going on, and
few people our age seem to care
much about it," she said. "But films
are so cool, because it's a media that
our generation can understand."
