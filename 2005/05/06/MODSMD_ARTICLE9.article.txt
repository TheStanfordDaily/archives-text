# Playboy scouts out Stanford
## 
### ANDREW LEIFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Playboy magazine is coming to Stanford next week to re
cruit female students for inclusion in its October "2(X)5 Girls
of the Pac-10" issue.
"So, if you're a Trojan. Bruin, Bear or Cardinal then it's
time to represent your school and let those East Coast con
ferences see what they're missing besides the weather,"
reads Playboy's advertisement in The Daily on Monday.
Playboy photographer Kim Mizuno will be leading the
interviews on May 9 and 10. but so far student response has
been lackluster.
"We haven't even gotten a little bit of a response from
Stanford yet, especially compared to the other schools like
Berkeley." Mizuno said.
Playboy's visit to Stanford will complete the magazine's
tour of Pacific-10 conference colleges, which include the
University of Arizona and the University of Washington,
among others.

During a typical interview a candidate fills out a ques
tionnaire and is then asked questions by Playboy represen
tatives. Following the questioning, candidates pose and
have their pictures taken.
Hopefuls are often nervous during the interview por
tion, Mizuno said.
"We expect them to be nervous," he said. "Not only are
you going to meet people and show your body in some way,
but it's the fear of being rejected that some girls really hate.
They have to realize that we are not here to reject them.
We're here to help them succeed."
Mizuno emphasized that those who apply from Stanford
have even less reason to fear rejection.
"You have to realize with Stanford, since we haven't
gotten too many responses, we really want them to succeed
â€” so the door will be open even wider," he said.
Even so, female students on campus expressed little in
terest in posing for the magazine.
"If a girl wants to pose for Playboy she can." said sopho-

more Tracy Petznick. "But I wouldn't
because I like being naked with one
person and not the world."
Freshman Jenn Fuller, a member
of Thefaceb<iok.com'group "50 Most
Beautiful People at Stanford," said
she would be hesitant to apply to ap
pear in Playboy.
"It depends on what it would re
quire," Fuller said. "I might try it, but
1 would never be naked because that's
degrading," Fuller said. "Also. I have
a boyfriend and 1 d have to see how he
felt about that."
Fuller was not surprised to learn
that Stanford had a smaller turnout
than other Pac-10 schools.
"Here there is a lot less emphasis
on being pretty and I don't think it's as
important," Fuller said. "At other
schools, like Arizona, that's what they
live for. People here have different
values and have different priorities."
Sophomore Lindsey Gannaway
said she feels similarly.
"It doesn't seem to be very charac
teristics of the students here," she said.
Mizuno assured that Playboy will
never try to convince someone to pose
who doesn't want to.
"One girl canceled on me this week
because she spoke to her parents
about it and they didn't think it was a
good idea," Mizuno said. "We told her
we understand.
Regardless, he said he was still op
timistic.
"We're hoping that the numbers
will increase in the next couple of
days," he said. "A lot of times the girls
wait until the last minute."
If no one does apply, he said in jest.
"We're going to take [Stanford] off
the Pac-U) and call it the Pac-9."
Candidates must be at least 18
years old. They are not required to
pose nude and if they are selected they
can choose from four types of poses
ranging from nude to clothed. Those
selected will be paid an undisclosed
amount dependent on what type of
pose they perform.
Interviews will be hosted at a hotel
off campus.
"We don't advertise the exact loca
tion." Mizuno said. "We don't want to
have the hotel packed with a bunch of
boys hanging in the lobby."
