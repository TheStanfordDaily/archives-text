# Playboy scouts out Stanford
## 
### ANDREW LEIFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Playboy magazine is coming to Stanford next week to re
cruit female students for inclusion in its October "2(X)5 Girls
of the Pac-10" issue.
"So, if you're a Trojan. Bruin, Bear or Cardinal then it's
time to represent your school and let those East Coast con
ferences see what they're missing besides the weather,"
reads Playboy's advertisement in The Daily on Monday.
Playboy photographer Kim Mizuno will be leading the
interviews on May 9 and 10. but so far student response has
been lackluster.
"We haven't even gotten a little bit of a response from
Stanford yet, especially compared to the other schools like
Berkeley." Mizuno said.
Playboy's visit to Stanford will complete the magazine's
tour of Pacific-10 conference colleges, which include the
University of Arizona and the University of Washington,
among others.

During a typical interview a candidate fills out a ques
tionnaire and is then asked questions by Playboy represen
tatives. Following the questioning, candidates pose and
have their pictures taken.
Hopefuls are often nervous during the interview por
tion, Mizuno said.
"We expect them to be nervous," he said. "Not only are
you going to meet people and show your body in some way,
but it's the fear of being rejected that some girls really hate.
They have to realize that we are not here to reject them.
We're here to help them succeed."
Mizuno emphasized that those who apply from Stanford
have even less reason to fear rejection.
"You have to realize with Stanford, since we haven't
gotten too many responses, we really want them to succeed
â€” so the door will be open even wider," he said.
Even so, female students on campus expressed little in
terest in posing for the magazine.
"If a girl wants to pose for Playboy she can." said sopho-
