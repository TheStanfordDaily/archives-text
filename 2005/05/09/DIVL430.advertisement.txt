GAP founder funding campaign against California
students and working families.
Shouldn't a store that sells to students stick up for students?
Not the GAP.
GAP founder Don Fisher, who's now a board director and the
company's single largest shareholder, is one of Governor
Schwarzenegger's leading special interest fundraisers —
and one of his biggest donors.
Together, Fisher and his family have given $154,700 to
Schwarzenegger and his committees — even though
Schwarzenegger has raised student fees, cut school funding,
vetoed the "Car Buyers Bill of Rights" and terminated consumer,
patient and environmental protections, while calling students
and nurses "special interests."
After promising to fully fund California schools, the Governor
shortchanged students by over $2 billion this year. 10,000
students were turned away from college last year because
of his cuts.
Now Don Fisher is out raising money for the Governor's special
election attacking teachers, school funding and worker pensions
— and he's one of the leading contributors to a right-wing scheme
to silence the voice of labor unions and working people.
When you pay the GAP, you pay the price.
