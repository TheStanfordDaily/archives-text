Hey STANFORD,
PLAYBOY

Attention female student body! Ever fantasized about being pictured in the
number one men's magazine in the world? Now's your chance to turn fantasy
into reality!
Representatives from PLAYBOY magazine are in Stanford to interview
and photograph female students for the fall 2005 "Girls of the PAC 10"
pictorial. Thousands of coeds have tried out for PLAYBOY since it began its
college conference pictorials 28 years ago. Many have gone on to become
PLAYBOY Playmates, models and actresses. Who knows what the future
holds for you?
To be considered for this pictorial and to qualify for an interview, candidates
must be at least 18 years of age and registered as a full- or part-time student
at a PAC 10 university. Clear copies of identification-one verifying enrollment
in school and one a photo ID that shows date of birth-must be brought to the
interview. All photos become property of PLAYBOY and cannot be returned.
Interview sessions are being held MAY 9, 10 & 11.
