# Int'l Day brings Blix, Zelikow
## Organizers hope event will mark expansion of international studies 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
Stanford played host on Friday to a col
lection of dignitaries, ambassadors, faculty,
students and interested community mem
bers during the first annual International
Day conference, put on by the Stanford In
stitute for International Studies, or SIIS.
The conference, entitled "Challenges in a
New Era," drew big names from the interna
tional studies community, including Hans
Blix, former head of United Nations
weapons inspections, and Philip Zelikow.
counselor of the U.S. Department of State
and former executive director of the 9/11
Commission.
The day's festivities officially kicked off
the University's International Initiative, an
interdisciplinary effort designed to turn Stan
ford into a hub for international policy stud
ies over the next 10 years.
Speeches delivered by Blix and Zelikow,
along with former National Security Advisor
Samuel Berger, who served under President
Bill Clinton, and Oxford University Profes
sor Paul Collier, headlined the event. The
conference also featured a number of break

out discussion sessions chaired by Stanford
faculty members. Panels ranged in topic
from climate change to U.N. reform to the
future of energy supplies.
Blix told those in attendance that, among
the threats facing the international commu
nity in coming years, a global nuclear arms
race is unlikely.
"The world is not milling with would-be

proliferators," he said. "It will be hard for the
United States to pursue a lonely arms race."
Former Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, who chaired a discussion on the
environment and climate change, thanked
Blix and Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. William Perry for "telling
everyone that climate change matters as
much as terrorism" for the future of interna
tional relations.
"It's very hard to get policy traction on
this issue," Kennedy told listeners. "I hope
the thing we get out of these repeated as
saults on the problem is determination to get
something done."
Attendees also witnessed interaction
among Stanford faculty at the session on the
United Nations and its future role in interna
tional security. SIIS Senior Fellow Stephen
Stedman chaired a panel featuring Adam
Thomson, deputy ambassador to the United
Nations, and Shirin Tahir-Kheli of the U.S.
State Department.
While Stedman addressed the issues, he
took a lighthearted approach. In contrast,
Thomson criticized the U.N. Security Coun
cil for not debating the escalating conflict in
the Persian Gulf appropriately, arguing that
it was necessary to "lance the boil of Iraq."
The panel also fielded questions from
Stanford faculty members Scott Sagan, pro
fessor of political science, and Allen Weiner,
professor of international law and diplomacy

said the conference, as well as the In
ternational Initiative at large, hoped
to foster and cultivate on campus.
"To get interaction between a di
verse set of professors from different
fields and policy makers who deal
with issues that faculty members are
analyzing is a real opportunity for
creative thinking," Sagan said.
Officials at SIIS called the confer
ence a resounding success in gauging
prospects for Stanford's growth in in
ternational studies.
"I couldn't be happier," said SIIS
Director Coit Blacker. "I am very
pleased with how things have gone."
" This was the test phase," added
Klas Bergman, associate director for
communications at SIIS. "So far it's
been a very positive experience."
Bergman said that he was opti
mistic that the International Day will
become an annual event at Stanford.
"I hope we can do this every
year," he said.
University President John Hen
nessey, who introduced the Interna
tional Initiative on April 28, wel
comed conference participants and
was on hand throughout the day to
partake in the events.
"The conference shows what we
can do when Stanford acts as a plat
form to bring together thinkers and
scholars," he said. "Universities have

an important role to play in creating
these types of discussions."
"The fact that we can get these
people is great," Hennessy said of the
speakers and faculty participates.
Even so, the conference and the in
ternational initiative with it will
thrive on student participation, he
added.
"I think ever since 9/11 there has
been a substantial increase of student
interest in foreign affairs," he said.
"We've all realized that no nation is
an island. We are touched by events
that occur throughout the world."
A number of students in atten
dance shared Hennessey's senti
ments and said they were impressed
by the speakers as well as their inter
action with the academics.
"It's amazing to be put in the mid
dle of all this," said freshman Alina
Syunkov, who is interested in inter
national relations. "It's great to see
how decisions are made and to see
professors in a setting with policy
makers and politicians, where there is
a bridge between academia and poli
cy."
Seeing professors in a different
setting was particularly intriguing for
junior Oriana Mastro, an East Asian
studies major who said she was struck
by a pessimistic remark made by SI IS
Visiting Prof. Michael Armacost in a
session addressing the situation on
the Korean Peninsula.
"It was the first time I've heard an
academic say that there was no
hope." she said. "It was very realis
tic."-
