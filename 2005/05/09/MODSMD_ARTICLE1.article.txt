## Organizers hope event will mark expansion of international studies

Stanford played host on Friday to a col
lection of dignitaries, ambassadors, faculty,
students and interested community mem
bers during the first annual International
Day conference, put on by the Stanford In
stitute for International Studies, or SIIS.
The conference, entitled "Challenges in a
New Era," drew big names from the interna
tional studies community, including Hans
Blix, former head of United Nations
weapons inspections, and Philip Zelikow.
counselor of the U.S. Department of State
and former executive director of the 9/11
Commission.
The day's festivities officially kicked off
the University's International Initiative, an
interdisciplinary effort designed to turn Stan
ford into a hub for international policy stud
ies over the next 10 years.
Speeches delivered by Blix and Zelikow,
along with former National Security Advisor
Samuel Berger, who served under President
Bill Clinton, and Oxford University Profes
sor Paul Collier, headlined the event. The
conference also featured a number of break

out discussion sessions chaired by Stanford
faculty members. Panels ranged in topic
from climate change to U.N. reform to the
future of energy supplies.
Blix told those in attendance that, among
the threats facing the international commu
nity in coming years, a global nuclear arms
race is unlikely.
"The world is not milling with would-be

proliferators," he said. "It will be hard for the
United States to pursue a lonely arms race."
Former Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, who chaired a discussion on the
environment and climate change, thanked
Blix and Management Science and Engi
neering Prof. William Perry for "telling
everyone that climate change matters as
much as terrorism" for the future of interna
tional relations.
"It's very hard to get policy traction on
this issue," Kennedy told listeners. "I hope
the thing we get out of these repeated as
saults on the problem is determination to get
something done."
Attendees also witnessed interaction
among Stanford faculty at the session on the
United Nations and its future role in interna
tional security. SIIS Senior Fellow Stephen
Stedman chaired a panel featuring Adam
Thomson, deputy ambassador to the United
Nations, and Shirin Tahir-Kheli of the U.S.
State Department.
While Stedman addressed the issues, he
took a lighthearted approach. In contrast,
Thomson criticized the U.N. Security Coun
cil for not debating the escalating conflict in
the Persian Gulf appropriately, arguing that
it was necessary to "lance the boil of Iraq."
The panel also fielded questions from
Stanford faculty members Scott Sagan, pro
fessor of political science, and Allen Weiner,
professor of international law and diplomacy
â€” the very sort of interaction that organizers
