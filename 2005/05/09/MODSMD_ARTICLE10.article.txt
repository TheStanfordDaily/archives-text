On May V, IVM, The Daily pub
lished the story "Sit-In Ended as Aca
demic ('ouncil Supports Amnesty, No
Suspensions" about the successful
conclusion to a student strike demand
ing that the University not suspend
several students involved in protesting
Central Intelligence Agency recruit
ment. Below is an excerpt:
"Fifty-six and one-half hours
alter they walked into the Old Union
with only themselves for support,
over 650 student demonstrators
peacefully departed last night with
an unprecedented vote of support
for their demands by the Stanford
faculty.
" The Academic Council, assis
tant professors and above, met yes
terday afternoon and early evening
for three and a half hours and rec
ommended after heated and emo
tional debate that the proposed sus
pension of seven Central Intelli
gence Agency demonstrators be set
aside by President Wallace Sterling.
"The Council also asked in a vote
of 284 to 245, that no students be pe
nalized as a result of the current
demonstrations in the Old Union.
The Council strongly urged the
demonstrators to leave the building.
"The Council recommendations,
which passed largely with votes from
the Humanities and Sciences and
Medical School faculties, supported
a comprehensive plan for reformed
judicial structures which the Com
mittee of 15 created early yesterday
morning.
"Though the Council actions
were a blow to administration policy
concerning the demonstration, the
Council did unanimously express its

confidence in Sterling and the ad
ministration.
"Two hours after the Council ac
tion, the demonstrators left the Old
Union following their own emotion
al debate about tactics and goals for
the future. The group plans a meet
ing in White Plaza today at noon to
discuss the Committee of 15's pro
posals, the one area they seem dis
satisfied.
"Some students strongly urged
that the sit-in continue, but they
were overwhelmingly voted down as
many students stressed the impor
tance of quickly leaving the building
in response to the 'victory' and newly
gained faculty support.
"Bruce Franklin, faculty mem
ber and a leader of the dissident stu
dents, who had continually urged
remaining in the Union until de
mands were met, called for immedi
ate departure after the Council
meeting. Earlier in the day, the stu
dents sitting-in had voted to leave
the union if the faculty agreed to
their demands.
" The Council meeting and subse
quent student action ended a day
that had begun with continued dis
cussion of tactics at the Old Union,
gatherings of students and faculty at
that site and several completely vain
attempts my opposing students to or
ganize against the demonstrators.
"At noon in Bishop Auditorium
at the Business School, leaders of the
opposing students met in an 'organi
zational meeting,' but it soon degen
erated into a confused and frustrat
ing debate over Robert's rules. The
students walked out after an hour."
