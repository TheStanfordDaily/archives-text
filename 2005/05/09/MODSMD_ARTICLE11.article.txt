## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
It's not easy to take time out of a professional ca
reer to go back to school. But every year, mid-ca
reer journalists compete for the prestigious Knight
Fellowships, which offer the chance to study inde
pendently at Stanford and participate in special
seminars fora year.
Last week, 12 U.S. journalists were selected as
Knight Fellows for the 2005-06 academic year, the
40th year of the program. Another six to eight in
ternational fellows will be announced later this
month.
The fellows will be studying a broad range of
subjects. Laura Rauch, a western regional photog
rapher for the Associated Press, said she hopes to
concentrate on "how and why America goes to
war." Tom Meyer, an editorial cartoonist at the San
Francisco Chronicle, is looking forward to special
izing in the role of metaphoric language in culture
and politics.
Each fellow proposes an individualized pro
gram of study in his or her application. In addition.

weekly seminars are held for fellows and their
spouses and partners.
Communications Prof. Jim Bettinger. the direc
tor of the Knight Fellowship Program, said that
many fellows choose to participate in the program
because it can advance their careers.
"Fellows take a year out of their careers fora fel
lowship because they believe it will help them im
prove the quality of their work by providing them
with intellectual stimulation and the time to think
deeply about journalism and related subjects," he
said.
According to the program brochure. Knight Fel
lows can audit classes in all schools at Stanford, in
cluding professional schools. They do not receive
credit and are not bound to complete class assign
ments, but they may choose to do so if they wish.
"The Knight Fellowships bring a wealth of jour
nalism and real-world experience to the Stanford
community," Bettinger said. "Knight Fellows
speak in classes, in residence halls and in sympo
sium panels. They can also provide real-world per
spective in classes. Last year Knight Fellows made
about 60 public appearances, which means that

during the academic terms. Knight Fellows were
speaking somewhere about twice a week."
Bellinger said that the program also depends in
part on the community's reception.
"The success of the Knight Fellowships Pro
gram rests largely on the welcome the fellows re
ceive from the Stanford community," he said. "We
are pleased to he so warmly received here."
The fellows were chosen in a three-stage
process. First, Bettinger, Deputy Director Dawn
Garcia and an outside reader selected 38 semifinal
ists from a group of 107 applications. In the second
stage, 28 finalists were chosen after interviews with
Bettinger, Garcia and groups of three former fel
lows.
"[The finalists' files] were reviewed by our pro
gram committee, which did the final evaluation and
ranking of the candidates," he said in an interview
with The Daily. "When we're considering Knight
Fellows, we look for an outstanding record of ac
complishment. serious ambition, the intellectual
flexibility and energy to make use of a year at Stan-
ford, and an enduring commitment
to journalism."
Applicants are required to have at
least seven years of full-time profes
sional experience as journalists. They
must also agree not to do any profes
sional work for the duration of their
fellowships. The program covers
Stanford tuition and includes a
stipend to cover living costs.
In addiction to Rauch and
Meyer, this year's fellows are Jo-
Ann Armao, assistant managing ed
itor of metropolitan news at The
Washington Post. Karen de Sa, staff
writer at The San Jose Mercury
News, Emily Harris, a Berlin corre
spondent for National Public Radio,
Pam Maples, assistant managing ed
itor of projects and investigations at
The Dallas Morning News, Maria
Martin, president of Gracias Vida
Productions in Austin, Texas, Ivan
Penn. reporter at The Baltimore
Sun, Mary Pols, a movie critic at The
Contra Costa Times, Janet Rae-
Dupree, freelance technology writer
in San Jose. Mike Swift, staff writer
at the Hartford Courant and Gary
Wolf, contributing editor at Wired
magazine.
