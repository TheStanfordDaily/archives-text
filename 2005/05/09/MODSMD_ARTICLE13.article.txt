# Water in the Milk Bottle
## Put a cap on it 
### 
I buy bulk packs of blue ballpoint pens and
leave them everywhere so 1 will always have
one within reach. On occasion, I'll leave one
uncapped, which has resulted in concentrated
blue circles on blankets, jeans, exam papers and
my fingers. Most recently, I threw an open pen in
my bag and now have a giant stain in my sturdy
carryall.
Given the frequency of such incidents, 1 no
longer consider discarding the ink-stained object.
It would only be a matter of time before its suc
cessor fell victim to the same fate. By now, I'm
looking fora solution to the perpetual problem.
I have no understanding of household mainte
nance. I never put the right amount of detergent
in the dishwasher, and I use the cold setting in the
washing machine rather than dealing with sorting
my laundry. My M.O. for cleaning is to find pun
gent chemicals, take my brownest sock and scrub.
If that doesn't work, I'm completely at a loss.
Thank god for TV commercials. Yesterday, I
watched "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Se
crets" (not bad), which was interrupted by a
round of unvarying commercials every two min
utes— stuffed-crust pizza, ant-like swarms of
children in Old Navy clothing and a range of cars

that elicited whoops of excite
ment from my friend Ducky
— "Ooh! Is that for Mazda?
Ooh! the Prius! Ooh! Toyota
Spyder! Hotness." Apparent
ly she likes all cars except
Hyundai.
For me. the most memo
rable commercial was for Ox
iClean. In the story of this all
purpose stain remover, the

protagonist goes to a party or
other social event, where he or she is assaulted by
OxiClean goons who slather condiments and
food all over the hapless target's shirt. The goons
then produce a bucket of OxiClean and magical
ly erase the stain, leaving the protagonist enlight
ened and grateful.
So 1 checked out the OxiClean product Web
site, where a handy "Ask the Expert" feature
suggested I blot the spot with towels, apply dena
tured alcohol and launder with Triple Power
Stain Fighter.
Hairspray, the guide noted, contains alcohol
and works for these purposes. But if you know
me, you know that, aside from bleach and dye, 1
have no familiarity with hair products. If you
don't know me, take a closer look at my picture.
At this point, if 1 get caught borrowing any
thing else from the chem lab. the consequences
may be severe, so 1 reverted to a second rule of
housekeeping: Alcohol and peroxide are more or
less the same thing. I blotted the ink spot, soaked
in some peroxide and threw the bag in the wash
with three different products. 1 figured that was
just about the effect "Triple Power" was going
for anyway.
My bag is now a crinkly, splotchy mess of
bleached-out and bluish spots. It may have been
the peroxide, the three different detergents or
the fact that my bag is labeled "dry clean only."
Now the tie-dye effect, along with the holes from
dragging the bag through the JFK airport last
summer, give my tote a sort of hippie look. I've
decided to consider it an aesthetic choice.
For the rest. 1 guess my best bet is to always
cap the pen.

Alex Marshall promised me e-mail. Ill be look
ing out for it at igliu@stanford.edu.
