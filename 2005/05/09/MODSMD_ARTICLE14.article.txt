# Greeks give back to the community
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Crazy parties, red cups and alcohol probation often come to mind when
Stanford students think of Greek life. Yet participating in community ser
vice is an integral part of belonging to a fraternity or sorority. Students in
the Greek system give back to the community in a variety of ways, in
cluding raising money for worthy causes and increasing awareness about
social issues.

"Our reputation on campus is very socially oriented — people think we
throw parties and that's it," said senior Jeff Brunski, a member of Sigma
Chi. "There's another dimension to Greek life. We take a lot of pride in
doing events for the community and helping people out."
One such event is Derby Days, a charity event held last week organized
by Sigma Chi. Four sororities — Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Fi Beta Phi — took part in the
fundraiser.

Junior Ozmond Ganapathi, ihe philanthropy director for
Sigma Chi. helped organize the event.
"Derby Days is a national Sigma Chi event, but the Stanford
chapter put it on for the first time this year," he said. "The event
was very successful, and we ended up raising over $ 1 ,(XX). which
we will donate to the Children's Miracle Network, specifically
[benefiting] the Oakland Children's Hospital."
During Derby Days, the four sororities competed against
each other to see who could raise the most money by selling bal
loons and t-shirts. The event culminated on Friday with a
karaoke competition among the sorority members.
"We hope that Derby Days will become an annual thing,"
Brunski said. "I think it's a really unique effort in that so many dif
ferent organizations were involved and were all working towards
the same cause."

Another upcoming charity event in which many of the Greek or
ganizations will be involved is Relay for Life. The 24-hour event rais
es money for the American Cancer Society and will begin at 10 a.m.
on Saturday May 14. Prior to the event, students form teams and raise
money for their group. On the day of the relay, they alternate walk
ing or running on the track so that at least one member is on the track
for 24 hours.

"Most of the fundraising happens before the event," said Megan
Shackleton, Relay For Life co-chair and member of Kappa Alpha
Theta. "Throughout the day, we will have a lot of fun things to do, such
as dancing and games. We will also have more serious events in honor
of people who have survived cancer or who were lost to cancer, in
order to promote cancer awareness."
According to Shackleton. out of the 30 groups participating, eight
will be Greek organizations, and many members of Greek organiza
tions are involved in planning the event.
"It is really troubling when individuals and chapters in our Greek
system are not respected for the immense amount of community service
that they take part in." said junior Allison Dencker. president of the In
ter Sorority Council."I think that many people would be surprised to
find out how much community service Greek community members take
part in. both with their chapters and in their own time."
Junior Derek Alley, a member of Kappa Sigma, blames this miscon-

ception of Greek life on a lack of exposure.
"The newspaper doesn't do an excellent job of going out and looking
for good stories, so a lot of the good things that the Greek community
does don't get the spotlight that they should." he said. "Community ser
vice is one of our national initiatives. It is a big focus nationally and on the
Stanford campus."
Sophomore Mike Kovack, president of the Inter Fraternity Council,
said he feels that fraternities often get more negative than positive press.
"Often I feel the negative image comes from events the campus deems
newsworthy," he said. "People tend to gossip more about some alcohol re
lated problem than a community service event. That is human nature, and
we can deal with it so long as we continue to make a positive influence on

the campus."
Alley said that his fraternity serves weekly breakfast to the home
less. organizes a quarterly blood drive and works with homes for
the elderlv.

"It's really frustrating that people overlook a lot of the positive
things that we do," Shackleton said. "We do a lot of amazing
things out in the community, and it's frustrating that what the only
thing the community sees are issues with drinking. We are all

working hard to try to promote a positive image of Greek life on campus."
