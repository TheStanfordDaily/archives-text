# Busy students find time for Mom
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly 90 years ago, Congress passed a
resolution to make the second Sunday of
May an official holiday to honor and thank
mothers around the country. Today, sons
and daughters show their appreciation for
their moms by buying flowers — online
tlower sales topped $K() million in the week
leading up to Mother's Day, according to
Com Score.com —or by spending quality
time with their mothers.
At certain schools on semester systems,
the possibility of spending Mother's Day at
home is a real possibility. Students at schools
such as Yale may very well have taken their
final exams and traveled home to be with
mom on this special day.
What do Stanford students, with almost a
month left of school, do for Mother's Day?
For students from the Bay Area, celebrating
Mother's Day in person is feasible. For oth
ers, a card or a phone call is the best one can
do given the distance.
Freshman Sam Adams, whose family lives
in Berkeley, took his mom out to dinner last
night.
"I normally cook her breakfast and take
her out to dinner," Adams said on Sunday
morning. "But today, I'm making her a card
and she's coming down here later. I still have

to make reservations for dinner. But every
one has a duty to be nice to their mommies
and make sure to call them on Mother's Day."
What about students from Southern Cali
fornia, the Midwest or the East Coast whose
mothers cannot drop by to visit?
Stanford students, for the most part, ex
press their love for their moms in the form of
a card, flowers or a small gift.
Freshman Karen Jones sent her mother a
handmade card.
"1 just mailed my mom a card, which she
opened a few days ago," Jones said. "She
called and said thank you for it and that she
loves homemade cards. She said she opened it
a few days ago and it cheered her up."
Another student. Elizabeth Norman, sent
her mom a more practical gift.
"I sent my mom a card and a book — a
Japanese cookbook." she said. "She said she
wanted to learn to cook Japanese food."
For some students, it is difficult to balance
a life at Stanford with spending time with fam
ily.
"My family goes out to brunch and nor
mally to Marie Calender's, which is down the
street from the house." said junior Allison
McCarty, an RA at Cedro. "This year, I was
going to go home and surprise my mom. but 1
couldn't because I had to staff here. Then I
tried to convince my parents to come up here,
but they said it was too long of a drive. Instead

I sent my mom candles and a gift certificate
and a card, and she and my dad went out to
brunch this morning."
Yi-Ren Chen, a sophomore, said that he
tried to make Mother's Day even more spe
cial given that he couldn't be there in person.
"I would usually make a card and put it by
the kitchen sink where she'll see it,"he said.
"But now that I'm away, 1 send a letter in
stead. 1 think it means more because it is a let
ter. I'll also give her a call later."
Some students said they felt that Mother's
Day was more about showing love and appre
ciation for their mothers through personal
communication rather than using an object
such as a card or a gift, which they perceived
as materialistic.
"1 called my mom Saturday and just
wished her a Happy Mother's Day," said
freshman Xin Xie. "1 feel that 1 don't really
need to send her a card or anything. I've lived
for my mother for long enough that she knows
that I love her, and I feel like there's no need
for me to buy a card."
And for the ever-busy Stanford student,
even making a phone call needed a bit of a re
minder.
"I knew it was coming all week, and I just
needed something to jolt my memory," said
freshman Lane Barrasso when asked what his
plans were for Mother's Day.
He rushed off to make a phone call.
