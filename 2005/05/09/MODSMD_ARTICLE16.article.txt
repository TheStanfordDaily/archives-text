## Campaigners feel crunch in last days 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SAN ANTONIO — It's Thursday, May 5, and the campaign
headquarters of San Antonio mayoral candidate Julian Castro, class
o! 19%. are hardly visible from the street. There'sonly a small sign that
says "Entrance in Rear" accompanied by a small campaign poster.
But writing off Castro — who is in last place among the three
leading candidates in terms of fundraising — would be a mistake.
I le has volunteers, history and enthusiasm on his side, and despite
everything, has a double-digit lead on his much older opponents.
"1 always knew they were going to go far in life," said Marie
Arias, who worked at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Anto
nio when Castro and his twin brother Joaquin attended school
there. She's been placing calls reminding people to vote for weeks.
The race is coming down to the last day, and the campaign is get
ting intense. Castro, 30, appeared on the steps of city hall today to
commemorate the National Day of Prayer. Maps of voting
precincts and lists for phone banks are being assigned.
Almost everyone in the office is wearing a campaign t-shirt, but
ton. sticker or other campaign logo. Some are even wearing t-shirts
that say "I am NOT Julian," referring to an incident dubbed
"Twinsgate," when the other mayoral candidates alleged that
Joaquin stood in for Julian at a river parade.
"I'm not shaving until election day — it's a superstition," said
Trinity University student Ross Rocketto, 20, who has been work
ing up to 41) h( >ursa week for Castro's campaign, despite the fact that
it's his finals week.
"It's like a well-oiled machine - if it works well," he said with a smile.
Headquarters would he easy to miss if it weren't for the many
cars with "Julian Castro for Mayor" bumper stickers. The walls are
covered with maps and old newspaper clippings. Stacks of papers,
posters, lawn signs and water bottles are everywhere. Everyone is
nervous and excited at the same time, and last-minute campaigning
is all anyone can talk about.
Though it is now known that there will be a run-off election, early
voting results seemed promising. The number of votes cast early
reached a total 0f52,000 and was three times as high as the early vot
ing in the last contested mayoral race, in 2001. There were also 10,000
mail-in ballots. Both types of voting are important, because early
voting can constitute as much as 45 percent of the total vote, said
Rosie Castro, Julian's mother and headquarters office manager.
"We worked on that very hard," she said, referring to the early
voting effort. "We had people at the polls during the period."
Jorge Urby is on the verge of graduating from Texas State Uni
versity at San Marcos — he only neds to turn in his paper and pre
sentation about the Castro campaign for his comparative politics
class. I le moved from Austin to San Antonio just to work on the
campaign and said he was impressed by Castro's overwhelming
amount of support, despite criticisms by his opponents that he is too
young to seek the office.
"Our founding fathers were his age when they founded this
country," Urby said. "Julidn has support I have never seen before.
I le's in a league of his own - there's no competition."
