# Med School helps scan mummy child
## Researchers hope to discern mummy's name, age and gender 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
State-of-the-art medical imaging equip
ment shed light on a life from the ancient
past Friday, as Stanford. Silicon Graphics
and the San Jose Rosicrucian Egyptian Mu
seum began studying the body of a 2.000-
year-old Egyptian child mummy with x-ray
scans that will be evaluated in the coming
months.
The collaboration was inspired by the Na
tional Library of Medicine's Visible Human
Project, which in 1994 received the body of a
death row inmate, said Project Manager Af
shad Mistri of Silicon Graphics. They froze,
sliced and scanned the body, which the in
mate had chosen to donate. By 1997. the
same imaging techniques were used by oil
and gas companies to locate underground oil
wells, increasing the probability of successful
drilling from 20 to 75 percent.
In 2001. the British Museum — which
houses more than 200 mummies — opened
an exhibit on x-ray scans of its mummy col
lection that broke attendance records, inter
ested in this research. Silicon Graphics

scanned its first mummy in 2003.
The Rosicrucian child mummy dates
from the Roman Period, circa 0 BCE. While
it has been x-rayed before, researchers hope
to answer many more questions with ultra
high-resolution CT scans and 3-dimensional
digital projection technology. Specifically,
they hope to ascertain the child's sex, its
cause of death, any disabilities it suffered
from and a more detailed inventory of the
mummy case's contents.
Stanford Hospital's CT scan lab, which
takes very precise measurements, will be
used to generate images of unprecedented
detail, all without disturbing the case or its
contents.
"It's especially useful for teeth, which are
the key to figuring out age," said Rebecca
Fahrig, assistant professor of radiology at
Stanford. "We're able to see a lot more, and
since it's digital, we can stitch the images to
gether."
The machine will be used to create a data
base of about 16,000 images of the mummy.
"We can figure out the exact geometry of
the bone structure and apply muscle forces
to figure out to some degree how the person
walked." said Garry Gold, assistant profes
sor of radiology. Previous x-rays of the skele
ton. which is less than three feet long, have
shown evidence of a misaligned pelvis.
"Perhaps the mummy limped," Gold
added.
Kevin Montgomery, technical director of
the National Biocomputation Center at

Stanford, will he in charge of reconstructing
the child's face from scan data and existing
databases of human physiognomy.
"I'm going to try to combine the 3-D data,
the x-ray data and get the computer to find
all the bones inside, all of the soft tissue and
everything," Montgomery said. "What I'm
going to do. which hasn't been done before,
is to take the bone structure and the soft tis
sue — skin and muscle — and using other

models of children of the same race, layer the
tissue on top of the bone structure, to try to
see what this child looked like."
The CT scans are so precise that they can
register the added thickness of paint on plas
ter. By scanning the gesso breastplate that is
traditionally found on child mummies and
matching the data against an inventory of
known hieroglyphic characters, Egyptolo
gists may be able to read the mummy's name.

"That's my particular dream," said Lisa
Schwappach-Shirriff, curator of the Rosi
crucian Museum. "I would like this child
not to be anonymous anymore after 2.000
years."
The data will take months to compile, but
the team is enthusiastic about the potential
outcome.
"We're bringing her back to life," Mistri
said.
