# New glass designed to prevent drink spiking
## Drink Spike Detector created to reduce date rape incidents 
### SANDYA NAIR THE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER 
(U-WIRE) BALTIMORE â€” Drink spik
ing, where alcohol or other drugs are added to
a person's drink without him or her knowing,
is a growing problem in bars and clubs. Tom
Martin, 23, a design student at London's
Brunei University hopes to combat this with
his new invention. According to CNN News,
Martin created the "Hollow." a glass that is
specifically designed to prevent drinks from
being spiked.
The Hollow is a special, two-walled glass
with a hollow, bottomless center. The inner
wall of the glass is lower than the outer, and
there is a narrow gap between the two walls.
The nozzle of the Hollow is directly attached
to the optic used to pour spirits, but once the
optic is removed, it becomes virtually impossi
ble to add anything inside because of the nar
rowness of the gap.

Martin told CNN, "If you were to drop
anything into the glass, it would go straight to
the middle. If any drug did land inside the
walls of the glass, it would he such a low per
centage that it wouldn't have an effect."
Aside from its design, the Hollow comes
with another protection device against drink
tampering. A mat that the Hollow sits on
changes color, depending on how long it has
been left unattended. According to CNN. the
mat turns blue alter 10 minutes, to warn the
drinker of potential spiking.
A London company, R&G products, has
launched another device to combat drink
spiking, the Spikey. The Spikey is a rubber
stopper, which fits into the top of a bottle,
tightly sealing the area around the straw to
prevent tampering with the drink. According
to the PR Newswire. Ray Lockett, a resident
of London, created the device after his daugh
ter's drink was spiked. Fortunately, Lockett's
daughter's friends noticed she was behaving
strangely, even though she had been drinking
only juice, not alcohol, and they took her
home to safety. The incident worried Lockett,
and he wanted to do something to combat
drink spiking.
Lockett told PR Newswire, "My son Mark
told me of a spiking incident with one of his
close friends and ideas started to How. It had

to be a one-use stopper unlike other reusable
caps on the market. Spikey prevents a poten
tial rapist picking up your drink, lifting the
cap. spiking it and replacing it."
Tom Martin tells CNN that he hopes that
his invention, the Hollow, will present an ad
vantage over the Spikey. "The Hollow is good
for wine drinkers. Lots of women drink wine
and they are the main targets of having their
drinks spiked."
Drink Safe Technologies has marketed an
other product, the Drink Spike Detector to
detect the presence of "date rape" drugs
(GHB. Ketamine, scopolamine and Zopi
clone) in drinks. The Drink Spike Detector is
a card, about the size of a credit card, with two
tests. After placing a few drops of the drink,
the two testing areas of the card will react,
changing color to indicate the presence of any
of these drugs in the drink.
The development of these technologies is a
concerted response to the growing problem of
drug-induced rape. People, often women, find
themselves the victims of rape after inadver
tently consuming drinks spiked with Rohyp
nol and GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate),
which are both colorless and odorless, accord
ing to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
The NIDA indicates that Rohypnol inca
pacitates victims, rendering them unable to

resist assault. Rohypnol is illegal. When mixed
with alcohol and other drugs, Rohypnol can
be lethal. It also causes anterograde amnesia,
so the victim does not remember events while
under the influence of the drug, according to
NIDA.
The other drug, GHB, is a depressant of
the nervous system and has been abused for its
euphoric and sedative effects. The NIDA also
states that GHB may cause comas, seizures,
nausea, or breathing problems, especially
when combined with other drugs. Ketamine,
Scopolamine and Zopiclone, and alcohol are
also commonly used to spike both alcoholic
and non-alcoholic drinks.
Many clubs in the UK are handing out free
Spikeys and other devices to combat the prob
lem of drink spiking. Tom Martin hopes that
his glass, the Hollow will become commercial
ly available. Until then. Reach Out! offers the
following guidelines to avoid drink spiking:
Don't accept drinks from strangers or
leave drinks unattended. If someone offers
you a drink, go to the bar with them.
Buy your own drinks and know what you
are drinking.
Don't drink something you did not open,
or see opened or poured.
If you're unsure about your drink, do not
drink it and leave it.
