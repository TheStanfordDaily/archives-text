## Castro faces run-off in San Antonio election 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
By the time supporters had left the Julian
Castro post-election celebration, the man of
the hour had been working the crowd —
along with his twin brother Joaquin and his
mother — for several hours. The food had
been eaten, the music played, interviews
given and the election results announced:
There will be a run-off on June 7.
In San Antonio, a mayoral race is not
won until a candidate receives more than 50
percent of the vote. In the race on Sunday,
Castro came away with 42 percent of the
vote. His closest rival. Phil Hardberger, 70,
got 30.1 percent of the vote, and a third can
didate, Carroll Schubert, 57, got 26.3 per
cent.
Because mayoral races are non-partisan
in San Antonio, the manner in which cam
paigning restarts will be tricky. Both Castro

and Hardberger are Democrats and both
campaigned to reform city hall. The big is
sues left to divide the two candidates can be
boiled down to age and race.
Even though it is the eighth-largest city
in the nation, San Antonio saw remarkably
low voter turnout, with 114.000 ballots cast
in a city of 1.3 million people. The run-off is
scheduled to provide candidates with exact
ly 30 days to re-invigorate their campaigns.
One issue that Castro's opponents
latched onto early in the game was his

youth. But Castro turned this into an advan
tage, touting his ability to bring young
blood, ideas and a lack of corruption to city
government. Opponents have also criti
cized Castro for the infamous "Twinsgate"
incident, in which Joaquin was mistakenly
identified as Julian. Some still say the inci
dent illustrated a lack of character and trust
worthiness.
Those who voted for Castro said that nei-

election. He spent his last day greeting voters at polling booths.
tlier issue was a problem, arguing that the "Twins
gate" incident was blown out of proportion by the na
tional media.
People like Emily Guerrero, who went door-to
door encouraging people to vote for Castro on
Election Day, said that race impacted voters' deci
sions differently.
She said that one Caucasian man told her fellow
campaigner to "tell that mojado to go back to Mexi
co," referring to Castro. Yet in contrast, another Cau

casian man told Gilbert Salinas, another campaign
worker, that he had beaten Salinas to the punch by
voting for Castro earlier in the day.
Strategizing for the next month began before the
final ballots were even counted, in the back room of
campaign headquarters marked "Do Not Enter."
There, Castro volunteers — including several of the
Castro brothers' friends from Harvard Law School —
tallied polling numbers in every one of San Antonio's
10 districts. As 7 p.m. and the close of polls drew near,
Castro returned to his home district, asking supporters
to get their family members to vote.
Rosie Castro, Julian and Joaquin's mother, was
hoping fora victory to celebrate her birthday — which
was also Saturday — and Mother's Day. While many
on the campaign were less than thrilled about the final

election results, most people saw an all-out win as op
timistic. The primary challenges facing the campaign
now are fundraising and pressing the flesh with as
many members of the general public as possible.
No one thinks that the next month is going to be a
walk in the park. The grassroots campaign has not
been without challenges — be it fiscal, staffing, tech
nological and even plumbing — yet no one ques
tioned sticking around for another month to close the
deal.
Castro wasn't lacking in popularity.
Supporters or not, Castro greeted voters in front of
polling places with jokes about "Twinsgate." And at
the end of the day, even Castro's security detail took a
moment to pose with the man who most on that side of
town like to call "the future mayor of San Antonio."
