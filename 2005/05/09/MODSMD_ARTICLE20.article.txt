# Prof, discourages pre-marital sex
## Says contraception contradicts giving of self through sex 
### JENNIFER GARFINKEL THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H.
â€” John Grahowski cautioned
against premarital intercourse and
spoke about the body as a "social
construct" during his talk at the
Aquinas House at Dartmouth Col
lege on Friday evening. The lec
ture was about the late Pope John
Paul li s book "Theology of the
Body," for which Grahowski, a
professor at the Catholic Universi
ty of America, wrote the foreword.
Grahowski discussed the impli
cations of the pope's views on the
body as set forth by the content of
the pope's book.
Intercourse is a symbol of "total
self-gift" and fidelity, and people
who engage in premarital sex are
therefore doing something with
their bodies that is not mirrored by
the lives they lead, Grahowski said.
"They're writing a check with
their bodies that their lives can't
cash." he said.
In addition to reviewing the
pope's ideas of original solitude,
original unity and original naked
ness. Grahowski applied two
moral applications to the pope's
ideas: contraception and homo
sexuality.
Grahowski heralded natural
family planning as the most appro
priate means of contraception.
Couples who use natural family
planning have higher rates of com
munication and better rates of
overall intimacy, and although
there is no hard data to explain
why, the divorce rate for these cou
ples is only 2 to 3 percent, he said.

"What happens when a couple
engages with contraceptive inter
course?" Grahowski posed.
To answer this. Grahowski sug
gested that "with their bodies,
they are speaking a language of
complete self-gift" but that they
are contradicting that by not giv
ing themselves fully. He pointed
out that family planning is 98 per
cent effective while oral contra
ceptives are only 92 percent effec
tive and latex contraceptives are
only 80 percent effective, statistics
he said were from the World
Health Organization.
Grahowski said homosexuality
is not a sin because a person does
not choose to be homosexual. A
person is not culpable for some
thing that is discovered, he said.
"One is not responsible for
being homosexual, one is responsi
ble for what they choose to do with
it," Grahowski said. "If a homo
sexual person is in a stable rela
tionship. that's the best they can
hope for."
Grahowski reminded the audi
ence that although the Catholic
Church condemns homosexuality,
it condemns hatred as well.
The majority of the talk cen
tered around the idea that the
body is a person's means of ex
pression.
"Our intellect and our freedom
display themselves through our
bodies," he said.
In addition to speaking about
premarital intercourse, Grahows
ki discussed religious celibacy,
saying that it is still giving the body
as a gift, but to God instead of a
spouse.
Grahowski also explained how
important it is for married couples
to share different types of intima
cy, such as spiritual intimacy.
"When sex is the only intimacy
that the couple enjoys, there is no
real depth to the relationship," he
said.
