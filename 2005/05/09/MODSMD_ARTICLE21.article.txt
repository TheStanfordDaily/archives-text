## Editorial Look out for club sports 
### 
Stanford's women's rugby team re
cently heat Penn State to clinch the na
tional championship title, defeating the
defending champion 53-6. Its victory
came after beating Princeton 27-22 in the
semifinals. We congratulate the women's
rugby team on its stellar performance and
hope that it will extend its winning tradi
tion in the years to come.
Students and other members of the
Stanford community tend to devote the li
on's share of their attention to a few high
profile, generally male sports, such as
men's football and men's basketball, and
to major events like Big Game. While this
focus is understandable, it also means that
a large group of equally deserving Cardi
nal athletes gets overlooked.
The fact that our some of our club
sports teams have been doing better than
their more glamorous varsity counterparts
may come as a pleasant surprise to some
students. Despite working with a reduced
budget — and without the athletic schol
arships available to varsity athletes —
club sports have done more than justify
their presence and have won accolades for
the University.
But club sports play an important role
on campus besides winning titles. We ap
preciate their presence at Stanford for
several reasons. First, club sports let stu
dents participate in a wide variety of ac
tivities, ranging from archery to ultimate
Frisbee.
Also, club sports present less of a bar

rier to athletes who played in high school
and would like to continue at the college
level without the all-consuming intensity
of varsity sports.
With over 1 ,(XK) students who play club
sports, the average Stanford student is
likely to have one or more friends in
volved in the club sports program, and
these students are likely to support their
friends during major tournaments and
events. In this way, club sports serve to in
tegrate athleticism into our daily lives,
even for non-athletes.
We encourage the student body to pay
attention to club sports because of the
many ways in which these teams con
tribute to the University; fans of Stanford
sports should take pride not only in our
more famous varsity teams, but in our
club athletes as well. In particular, club
sports deserve our financial support
through ASSU special fees. Given the
many direct and indirect benefits that club
sports bring, our special fees for club
sports are well invested.
We are heartened by the fact that 76
percent of undergraduates voted to ap
prove special fees for club sports in the re
cent ASSU elections. However, we are
perplexed by the graduate student com
munity's reluctance to endorse club sports
in the same elections. While searching for
ways to improve graduate student life on
campus, we hope that the graduate com
munity will recognize the many benefits
that club sports bring to Stanford.
