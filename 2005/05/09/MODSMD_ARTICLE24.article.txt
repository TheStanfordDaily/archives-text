So there was an election last week. An
important one. A medium-sized cog in
the machinery of the "free world" went
through the motions of democracy and
• w-L.JctcJ us government.
Now, this may come as surprise to you.
In fact, my informal questioning last
weekend suggested that very few of my
peers were aware of the potential politi
cal upheavals poised to take place on the
other side of the Atlantic.

This apparent ignorance of the outside world is not sur
prising. Actually, it's not even something to he ashamed of.
Most events across the globe have little relevance for hu
manity's "last, best hope."
Why should you care if Tony Blair gets re-elected? Amer
ica is perfectly capable of managing its stewardship of the
planet without its citizens having to keep up with events in
satellite states.
It's true that last year's U.S. presidential election was fol
lowed closely around the world, but quid pro quo isn't nec
essarily appropriate — ultimately, we foreigners care a great
deal more about you than you do about us.
In truth. 1 don't mind the towering ignorance that the peo
ple around me demonstrate about the U.K. elections; rather,
it's the sense of being disconnected from events back in the
homeland that's been bothering me.
California's a fabulous place: You have sunshine, girls
and In N' Out — what more could a person ask for? Occa
sionally, however, I do miss London life and English news.
Somehow the Internet, while overflowing with informa
tion. isn't quite the same as being "in country." It's simply
not enough to just read about events, you have to be close
enough to them to hold water cooler discussions.

Keeping up with news as it unfolds is often more about
having a conversation over a couple of pints than it is about
following the minutiae of the unfolding. You can know every
detail of a story, but still be too far away (by 6,(KX) miles) for
the casual drink that's needed to be able to fully grasp what's
going on.
It's even worse when you switch from hard news to pop
culture. Nothing felt quite so strange last year as trying to fol
low the David Beckham / Posh Spice / Rebecca Loos scan
dal (Google it) on BBC News Online.
Without the daily glance at the tabloids on the newsstands
at tube station entrances (OK, so maybe I indulge in more
than just a glance), the events didn't really stick. And absent
the bi-weekly afternoon coffee and accompanying gossipy
chat, everything 1 managed to recall seemed a little clinical.
In general it's much easier to immerse yourself in a new
place than it is to let go of an old one. We have too many
links. Not just those that come from friends and from family,
but other, more ephemeral ones.
The ongoing antics of various aging 'C'-list celebrities.
The ins and outs of the Premier League (that's football with
a round ball). The day-to-day political bickering that would
never qualify as international news. These are a few of my fa
vorite things, and I can feel them slipping away.
Still, 1 suppose that even as old ties fray, new ones
strengthen. I may no longer have the Beckhams to enliven
my conversation, but there's always Paula Abdul and the
"American Idol" sex scandal. And you know what they say:
When in Rome ...

Are you a generous American with a solid background in
celebrity gossip? E-mail navinsQPstanford, edu and help educate
a poor foreigner on the local culture. Ill explain U.K. parlia
mentary democracy in return.
