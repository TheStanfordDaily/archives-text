# A 						Break from the Bubble
## Thefacebook.com is uncool 
### 
I've already established that
any social commentary based on
thefacebook.com is problematic,
but, paradoxically, sometimes un
representative and biased sam
pling is the best way to do research:
In many ways,
thefacebook.com has become the
measuring slick of just how "pop
ular" you are. As 1 wrote in my
March 9 column ("An ugly dis
play of character"), with its exclu-

sive, invitation-only groups, thefacebook.com has
allowed Stanford to crystallize the sort of cliquish
ness that we're supposed to leave behind when we
graduate from high school.
Of course, because thefacebook.com prides itself
on being the all-purpose social networking tool,
there are several other means of measuring how
"cool" you are.
If you have more messages on your wall than the
95 theses Martin Luther posted on some church
door almost S(X) years ago, you must be popular,
right? If you have alcohol somehow prominently
featured in your picture, clearly you're fun. Any sort
of inside joke in your profile means you're so cool
that others don't even deserve to know what you're
talking about.
Theoretically then, the best way to ascertain how
popular someone is would be to count how many
facebook friends they have. And it's exactly this that
1 find to be most ironic component of theface
book.com, and to some extent Stanford in general.
1 will humbly admit up front that I am in no posi

tion to measure how cool anyone is (I'm a columnist
for The Daily, after all). But often times it is the peo
ple with a lowly 40 friends who I think are the most
fun, while the people with 500 friends no one really
seems to like.
This reverse logic extends even farther: The
coolest, most interesting people I know on campus
are the ones who aren't on thefacebook.com at all.
When I walked-on this quarter and wanted to do
investigative research on my future roommates, 1
facebooked them. One wasn't on thefacebook.com.
1 knew right then he would be cool, and sure enough,
he is (shout out to Kyle, perhaps the one person I
know who even reads my column!).
Maybe it's because of self-selection, but the few
who aren't on thefacebook.com are also the ones
who care the least about what others think of them.
Particularly at a school where just about every girl
has that white Abercrombie skirt and every guy has
a popped collar, you have to respect that.
If only I could remember who those select few are
— since they're not my friends on thefacebook.com,
sometimes I forget that they even exist.
So, to recap: if you want to be cooler, ax your face
book friends from your freshman year IHUM sec
tion and pare down your friends list to under 50 peo
ple. But if you want to be really cool, get off theface
book.com altogether.

If you want to tell him how cool he is for having a wall
that scrolls for two pages, contact him at dlouk@stan
ford. edu. Just don'/ add him as a friend — that 11 make
him less cool.
