Study on attractive vs. ugly kids is silly
The Daily's May 5 article, "Parents favor attractive kids," disappoint
ed me, but not for the reason you might think. As The Daily reported,
psychologists in a supermarket observed that parents of cute children fas
tened the shopping cart seatbelt 13.3 percent of the time, but parents of
ugly children did so only 2.1 percent of the time. They concluded that
"parents favor more attractive children because of an evolutionary bias."
This study is silly: Even beyond the questionable attempt to rate kids'
attractiveness, these statistics compare children of different parents and
are thus subject to confounders such as socioeconomic status. The con
clusion also ignores the reverse causal explanation, which is more plausi
ble â€” that responsible parents have well fed and well groomed kids.
In the future, I encourage The Daily to avoid stories that lend author
ity to marginal science, even if they sound catchy. Besides, those of us who
were given ugly genes have enough cause to be grumpy already.

We need more religion in politics; not less.
Although I agree with The Daily editorial ("Republicans seeks tyran
ny of the majority," May 6) denouncing Republican party members' at
tempts to change the filibuster rules, especially the wild claims that de
fending the filibuster is anti-religious, I completely disagree that religion
should be kept out of politics.
Most religions are about justice, caring for the poor, the sanctity of life
and a consistent, faithful, disciplined adherence to high moral standards.
Clearly we could use more of these faith-based moral standards in our
politics today. When actions that would avoid the loss of tens of thousands
of lives (peaceful elimination of Saddam instead of preemptive war) ap
pear less important than saving one life in Florida, our moral compass is
out of whack.

Fora comprehensive look at the role religion and faith should play in
U.S. politics today, read Jim Wallis' "God's Politics: Why the Right Gets
it Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It".
Separation of church and state does not mean that each should pre
tend the other doesn't exist. They are both better off engaged rather than
divorced. The real culprits are individuals with a lack of consistent moral
standards and this is exactly what most religions preach and teach.

Row staff is not the problem
In their op-ed piece on returning Residential Education staff ("Re
turning Res Ed staff are not the problem," May 6) Kyle Bruck and
Stephanie Sud write of Row staff selection: " Because of the lower level
of supervision, nepotism and generally unfair processes are more like
ly to occur."
As someone who has been involved in Row RA selection three times
on both sides of the table, I'll just say I was amused by the suggestion that
RFs are somehow more supervised than Row staff. There seems to be an
implicit assumption that RFs are professional enough not to require su
pervision while Row staff do not meet that standard. That has not been
my experience.
The University entrusts Row staff with a great deal of responsibility in
running their houses, and I think the persistent popularity of the Row in
the housing draw is evidence of their success. No Row house has as high
a concentration of singles as Roble or Lag, but the Row remains ex
tremely popular.
I don't think the Row staff could achieve such success if they took such
a cavalier attitude towards RA selection.
