# Flyers targeted in years past
## Posters vandalized at Univ. of Chicago

Three posters advertising an event
for the Chicago Friends of Israel
(CFI) were defaced with swastikas
on Sunday evening in the Regen
stein Library at the University of
Chicago. More of the same posters
were found torn down and vandal
ized in various places around cam
pus on Monday, according to CFI
president Jon 11irsch, a second-year
in the College.
At approximately 10 p.m., the
Maroon was alerted to the fact that
swastikas had been drawn on three
CF I posters for Israel Week, in the
stairwell leading to the Fx Libris,
the Regenstein Library coffee shop.
The swastikas had apparently been
drawn with a blue ballpoint pen, and
were accompanied by an "X" over
the face of the keynote speaker for
an event CFI will host on May 9 as
part o! Israel Week. No one has
come forward to identify the perpe
trator.
Hirsch said that CFI members
had posted the posters by around 7
p.m. on Sunday. Upon learning of
the vandalism in the Regenstein,
Hirsch conducted a survey of the
posters around campus on Monday
afternoon. "Many CFI flyers had
been torn down while others had
been taken down and taped back
wards, with the information facing
the wall," he said. Hirsch noted
that posters advertising other
events had been taped over the CFI
posters, in spite of "ample unused
space" to either side. A hole had
been burned into one flyer, disfig
uring the image of the event's
speaker.
According to Hirsch and former
CFI president Adam Weissmann. a
fourth-year in the College and mem
ber of CFI, this is the third consecu
tive year in which CFI flyers have
been negatively targeted. Weiss
mann recalled an incident from
April 2002 in which a 12-page mani

festo, featuring swastikas and anti-
Semitic cartoons, was posted in the
hallway of Pierce Hall.
Israel Week is traditionally cele
brated between Holocaust Memori
al Day and Israeli Independence
Day, and begins this year on May 4.
Weissmann said that CFI started a
celebration of Israel Week in spring
2003, for which the group posted
"large, glossy flyers" around cam
pus. "Ninety percent of the posters
were torn down in two days," he
said, and some were defaced with
swastikas and anti-Semitic quotes.
In fall 2003, CFI advertised a
panel entitled "Why 1 am a Zionist."
Alternative posters mocking the
panel were subsequently posted, re
versing the order of the title to read:
"Why am I a Zionist?" and falsifying
the original information. Last
spring, CFI intentionally planned a
poster campaign that would not
arouse passions, focusing on
achievements of Israelis in technolo
gy. such as the invention of AOL in
stant messenger and the clothing
company GAP. Hirsch said that the
flyers were also torn down and de
faced.
Vice President and Dean o! Stu
dents in the University Steve Klass
condemned the recent acts of van
dalism. " This kind of public poster
defacement is absolutely unaccept
able anil will not be tolerated by this
community," he said. "Policy-wise,
these behaviors violate University
standards when they threaten the se
curity of individuals or groups of in
dividuals. or inhibit any individual's
or group's full-participation in the
life of the University."
Klass noted that the perpetrator
might not be a student, given that
the vandalism look place in publicly
accessible spaces. He said that if
there were evidence that a student
had committed this kind of vandal
ism. the student would likely be
brought before a divisional discipli
nary committee and could face sanc
tions ranging from disciplinary pro
bation to expulsion.
