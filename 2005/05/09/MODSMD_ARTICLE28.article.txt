# Survey shows prescription drug abuse
## 
### J. SCOTT BOWMAN KANSAS STATE COLLEGIAN 
(U-WIRE) MANHATTAN, Kan. â€” Pre
scription drugs can help people who need them,
or get the people who want them high.
Ritalin, Adderall. Valium, Vicodin and Oxy-
Contin, the last also known as the "poor man's
heroin." are all prescription drugs that have
been abused.
Other than over-the-counter drugs, there are
two main types of drugs that pharmacies deal
with: controlled and noncontrolled. Dr. Charles
Eisenberg, director of the Mercy Health Center
pharmacy, said.
Controlled drugs are designated by the Food
and Drug Administration as having significant
abuse potential. Eisenberg said.
"There are five different schedules of con
trolled drugs that a pharmacy might see," he
said. "Schedule one we don't see. which would
include heroin, because there isn't a typical
medical use.
"Schedule two includes morphine, which we
use all the time, and cocaine, which has medical
use in hospitals."
Schedules three through five are still con
trolled. but less than the first two, Eisenberg
said. He said with the first two schedules, pre
scriptions must be brought in. not faxed, and

they can't be refilled.
He said that of some of the more known
drugs, Ritalin is a schedule two, Vicodin is a
schedule three and Valium is a schedule four.
There are programs on campus that can help
students who are abusing prescription drugs,
Aaron Carlstrom, therapist with the University
Counseling Services, said. He said Counseling
Services doesn't have drug and alcohol counsel
ing. but there are services available for individu
als faced with drug abuse.
"What we do is address issues of the sub
stance abuse," Carlstrom said. "We'll see if the
abuse is linked with depression or anxiety. If
things are more serious, we'll refer them for
treatment in the community."
Carlstrom said there is information for stu
dents interested in getting help at the Counsel
ing Services Web site, www.ksu.edu/counseling.
He said they have an annual report that lists
the types of issues the employees at the Coun
seling Services encounter.
According to the latest report, the majority
of issues that are dealt with are mood disorders.
According to the report, only 24 of every 100
clients who visit the Counseling Services have
substance abuse problems. Carstrom said the re
port has overlap, meaning someone who has
substance abuse problems might also have a
mood disorder.

Addiction to drugs, including those pre
scribed. stem from psychological or physiolog
ical reasons that vary from person to person,
Bill Arck. director of the Alcohol and Other
Drugs Education Service, said. He said the
people who tend to abuse prescription drugs
are generally those who abuse other illicit
drugs.
"Basically, they are the folks who've done
other drugs," Arck said. "They're not going to
be people who don't smoke or drink and sud
denly wake up one day and say 'Hey, I'm going
to crush up some Ritalin and snort it.'"
Arck said people who buy prescription drugs
on the street should be concerned about where
the drugs they are buying come from. He said
the drugs might not be what one thinks they are,
and might come from a pharmacy from another
nation that doesn't have the same standards as
the United States.
The Alcohol and Other Drugs Education
Service just completed a drug survey, Arck said.
He said prescription drug abuse is fairly rare on
the K-State campus.
"We just finished the survey last week and we
asked the question of people abusing prescrip
tion drugs," Arck said. "We saw a few people
mentioning pain killers, but it's less than one or
two percent of the population. It's a very small
percentage."
