# Bill proposes extending daylight savings
## 
### JULIANNE PEPITONE DAILY ORANGE 
(U-WIRE) SYRACUSE, N.Y. â€” To alleviate
some of the demand on the nation's oil. the gov
ernment has elected to spread sunshine all over the
land in the form of a new hill concerning daylight
saving time.
Daylight-saving time will he extended by two
months if the U.S. Senate approves the energy hill
that passed unanimously in the House of Repre
sentatives.
The hill, which was developed by Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass.. and Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich.,
was brought before the House Committee on En
ergy and Commerce. Daylight-saving time current
ly begins in early April and ends in October. If the
Senate approves the bill as expected within the
next few weeks, daylight-saving time will begin the
first Sunday in March and end the last Sunday of
November.
According to a press release from Markey's of
fice, the bill is supported by studies that show the

rates of both fatal automobile accidents and gener
al crime decrease during the longer days of day
light-saving time.
While supporters of the bill argue more hours of
sunlight means people will use less electricity and
thus conserve up to K).(KK) barrels of oil a day.the
State University of New York College of Environ
mental Science and Forestry chair of environmen
tal studies faculty, Richard Smardon, said this
claim is merely wishful thinking.
"There needs to be a behavior shift in the lives
of the bulk of the people," Smardon said. "People
want to drive SUVsand leave their air conditioners
on. We need to do something to tie it to their every
day lives."
People would benefit from suggestions regard
ing what they can do to conserve energy, Smardon
continued.
"Unless people hear about what they can do im
mediately. it goes in one ear and out the other." he
said. "People won't know if it isn't combined with
education programs."
For people to try to make improvements in their

energy consumption, they must first know more
about the problem. Many people at Syracuse Uni
versity do not, in fact, know about the proposed
legislation.
"1 hadn't heard about (the bill)," said graduate
fellow and professor of personality psychology
Ryan Thibodeau. "1 could see how people look for
ward to that extra hour of sunlight, but I don't think
it will affect me in how I do business every day."
Freshman psychology major Pamela Parker
was surprised to hear about the proposed change.
"1 had no idea about it," she said. "Why would
they even bother? It seems fine as it is. I don't see
any problem with how it is now."
Some students worried about the degree of con
trol that the government imposes on our lives.
"I think it's ridiculous that the government
thinks that they can control our lives that much,"
said freshman surface pattern design major Emily
Sapienza.
Others said they felt changing daylight-saving
time is just another of many ways the government
has stepped beyond the boundary of its power.
