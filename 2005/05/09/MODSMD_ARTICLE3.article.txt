# Powwow brings native culture and dancing
## 
### CAILEAN COOKE 
Unfazed by the dreary weekend weather,
the Stanford American Indian Organization, or
SAIO. held its 34th annual Powwow, drawing
thousands of natives representing North Amer
ican tribes and many non-native visitors to the
Eucalyptus Grove. The three-day celebration is
the best-attended multicultural event hosted on
campus each year and the largest student-run
powwow nationwide.
Some attendees said that attending the event
had great personal significance.
"I've spent too many years in the white
man's world, so I use powwows to get back
among my own people," said participant
Growling Bear, who traveled from Canada to
be at the event. At 80 years of age, he was one of
the oldest to take part in the intertribal dance.
He was raised on a Chippawa reserve in On
tario, Canada and has been participating in pow
wows for the past decade.
Sophomores Spring Golden and Sarah
Kaopuiki, both native Hawaiians and student

coordinators, helped with dance competition
registration.
"It feels good," Kaopuiki said. "It's really
hopeful that they still have a presence here."
Sophomore Hodge Wasson, SAIO financial
officer and powwow publicity head, empha
sized that the event was intended to spread
awareness among the native and non-native
communities.
"Anyone and everyone is invited to come
out and participate," Wasson said. "It's a good
chance to get together and celebrate culture
when for so long we've been punished for
speaking our native tongue and participating in
powwows."
The highlight of the event is the dance com
petition. Joel Mena, a 12-year-old Apache from
Santa Maria, said he enjoys dancing in pow
wows across the country. He recently competed
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
"I wanted to compete because I watched the
older kids dancing and it looked fun," Mena said.

Dancer competes at SAIO's 34th annual Powow at tfie Eucalyptus Grove this weekend.
"My costume Is heavy, but you get used
to it." Mena wore a traditional costume
complete with headdress, feathers,
bussels and roach.
The powwow dance contest is split
between the sexes, and ages range
from liny Tots (under 5 years) to
Golden (over 5() years).
Senior Jerold Blain, who was the
2(X)5 booth committee head and 20()4
co-Chair, said the powwow costs
roughly $125,000 per year. Stanford's
powwow is a student-run event and re
ceives University funding from the Of
fice of the President, Vice President,
Vice Provost and Dean of Students as
well as special fees funding from
SAIO. The rest of the budget is met
through fundraising, txxrth vendors
and casino and local tribe grants.
"Since this is my last year at Stan
ford, I was really happy to be a part of
the tradition for one last time," Blain
said. "It's amazing what a small group
of students can do when everyone col
laborates."
Next year Blain hopes to enter a
graduate program in museum studies.
"The experience I've had has given
me opportunities in dealing with other
people and institutions like Stanford,"
he said.
The event boasted handcrafted
wares such as jewelry and woven rugs
for sale and food booths with funnel
cakes, chili and even pad thai for hun
gry dancers and spectators.
Cireyday Child, a Navajo from Ari
zona, sold silver and turquoise rings,
necklaces and earrings on Saturday.
She said that her tribe picked up the
jewelry-making styles of the Pueblo
Indians when they were relocated to
New Mexico and began incorporating
silver into their stone jewelry.
"There is a story that the white man
was given stone and the Indian was
given gold," Child said. "The white
man took the gold and left the stone.
The Indian took the stone and left the
gold."
The stones were used in symbolic
designs to decorate bridles and concho
belts and have different meanings de
pending on the kind of stone or shell,
such as clam shell or abalone. Child
said that uneven nuggets are highly
valued.
"White men would only value the
smooth stones, but to us, the value is in
the eve of the beholder," Child said.
