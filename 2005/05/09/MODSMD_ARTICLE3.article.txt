# Powwow brings native culture and dancing
## 
### CAILEAN COOKE 
Unfazed by the dreary weekend weather,
the Stanford American Indian Organization, or
SAIO. held its 34th annual Powwow, drawing
thousands of natives representing North Amer
ican tribes and many non-native visitors to the
Eucalyptus Grove. The three-day celebration is
the best-attended multicultural event hosted on
campus each year and the largest student-run
powwow nationwide.
Some attendees said that attending the event
had great personal significance.
"I've spent too many years in the white
man's world, so I use powwows to get back
among my own people," said participant
Growling Bear, who traveled from Canada to
be at the event. At 80 years of age, he was one of
the oldest to take part in the intertribal dance.
He was raised on a Chippawa reserve in On
tario, Canada and has been participating in pow
wows for the past decade.
Sophomores Spring Golden and Sarah
Kaopuiki, both native Hawaiians and student

coordinators, helped with dance competition
registration.
"It feels good," Kaopuiki said. "It's really
hopeful that they still have a presence here."
Sophomore Hodge Wasson, SAIO financial
officer and powwow publicity head, empha
sized that the event was intended to spread
awareness among the native and non-native
communities.
"Anyone and everyone is invited to come
out and participate," Wasson said. "It's a good
chance to get together and celebrate culture
when for so long we've been punished for
speaking our native tongue and participating in
powwows."
The highlight of the event is the dance com
petition. Joel Mena, a 12-year-old Apache from
Santa Maria, said he enjoys dancing in pow
wows across the country. He recently competed
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
"I wanted to compete because I watched the
older kids dancing and it looked fun," Mena said.
