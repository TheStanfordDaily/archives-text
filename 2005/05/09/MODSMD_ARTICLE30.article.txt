## Fade into Bolivian You gotta catch 'Up For Grabs'

Winner of the Audience Award for Best
Documentary at the Los Angeles Film
Festival, Stanford MBA recipient
Michael Wranovics' "Up For Grabs" tells the
often hilarious story of Alex Popov and Patrick
Hayashi's legal wrangling for ownership of Barry
Bonds' historic 73rd home run ball.
In the first inning of the Oct. 7,2(X)1 game at
the park formerly known as Pac Bell (now SBC).
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dennis Springer
grooved a full-count knuckleball to Bonds. As he
had done many times that season. Bonds raked
the ball into the right field arcade for his record
setting 73rd home run. Fans, who swamped the
arcade in hopes of becoming instant millionaires
(and possibly also to watch the game) immediate
ly converged on the ball.
Video images (from the so-called Keppel

Tape, shot by local news cam
eraman Josh Keppel) show
Alex Popov using what a
Major League umpire would
later describe during a court
room scene as the "largest
mitt" he'd ever seen, making a
snowcone-esque catch. How
ever. Mr. Popov was quickly
bum-rushed by a massive sea
of humanity, overwhelmed.

and taken to the ground. As fans fought for the
ball. Patrick Hayashi. like a Phoenix rising from
the ashes, emerged unscathed from the scrum
with the ball. He was quickly whisked away by se
curity to confirm the authenticity of the ball.
Despite calls from Bonds and most sensible
people for Popov and Hayashi to sit down fora
couple of brews and amicably agree to jointly split
the profits from the auction of the ball, both men
claimed sole possession. With no agreement
reached outside of the courtroom, in typical
American fashion, the men decided to hide be
hind their hired legal hands and wage an exceed
ingly expensive two-year legal battle.
Did Popov cleanly catch the ball and have pos
session? Did Hayashi pull a Mike Tyson and bite
a kid during the melee? Did Hayashi steal the ball
from Popov's glove? Interviews with eyewitness
es, legal experts and sports journalists offer wide
ly differing viewpoints about who is the rightful
owner.
While the 90-minute film briefly focuses on
the legal aspect of the home run (i.e. what defines
possession?), a greater emphasis is placed on de
veloping the personalities of Popov and Hayashi.
At first, the film portrays Popov as the
wronged character and the rightful owner of the
ball. However, as Popov continually spouts off
over the duration of the documentary, the viewer
learns that Popov is an arrogant media-whore, in
tent on using the ball to garner as much media at
tention as possible.
Even with a girlfriend, we see Popov using his
attachment to the 73rd homerun ball to pick up
chicks with lines such as: "Have you heard about
Barry Bonds' 73rd home run ba11?... I'm the guy
who caught it." Classy.
In contrast, Hayashi shies away from the
media maelstrom, as he appears to be uncomfort
able with the breadth of the situation. Just be
cause Hayashi is not an arrogant prick with a
sense of entitlement, he becomes the more like
able character in Wranovics' story.
Wranovics does little to narrate the story; in
stead, he allows those surrounding the event —
the media, the eyewitnesses, the legal experts,

footage of Bonds' press conferences
and the two fans fighting for the ball
— to tell it. These witnesses provide
plenty of comedic opportunities, as
they offer contrasting stories about
what transpired on that fateful Octo
ber day.
Key witnesses include a young man
who was allegedly bitten by Hayashi
(although he can't actually remember
where he was bitten), an orthodontist
more interested in giving a play-by
play of the 73rd home run than work
ing on his patients, an umpire intent on
promoting his umpire training video,
and a lady from Hewlett Packard
whose voice sounds like the Dalai
Lama.
Why were people so adamant
about catching the ball? In the eyes of
the filmmaker, it was the pursuit of
quick money. Much like Popov and
Hayashi, those stationed in right field
were pure opportunists looking to win
the home run lottery. The fate of Mark
McGwire 70th home run ball helps ex
plain why Popov and Hayashi were
willing to wage battle over Bonds"
73rd.
In January 1999, "Spawn" creator
and owner of the United States' fifth
largest action-toy manufacturer Todd
McFarlane bid an astronomical $2.7
million (plus an additional $3(X)K
commission to Guernsey's auction
house) for McGwire's 7()th home run
ball. Although not discussed in the
movie, it is interesting to note that Mc-
Farlane also purchased Bonds' 73rd
home run ball (I would have liked to
see an interview with McFarlane
about his fascination with baseball
memorabilia).
I will not reveal the outcome of the
court case or reveal the fate of the 73rd
home run ball. However, I will tell you
that ultimately the movie ends with
two intriguing twists as the trial culmi
nates. Unfortunately, this low-budget
documentary (Wranovics ran out of
money filming the movie and relied on
a private investor) will not be coming
to a theater near you anytime soon.
Even with accolades and positive
media attention, "Up for Grabs" is still
in extremely limited release — after a
three-week screening in San Francisco
and Oakland, the film is currently only
beingshown in New York. It returns to
Santa Cruz on May 17.
