# Lax wins MPSF tourney, misses NCAAs
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
The season hung in the balance for the
women's lacrosse team last night. This time,
though, there were no shots to block, no cuts
to make, no opponents to guard. No team
mates beckoned fora pass, no coaches drew
up a play. This time, all the team could do
was wait and hope.
Finally, College Sports Television aired
the announcement. Despite winning the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tour
nament this past weekend on the heels of a
seven-game winning streak. No. 19 Stanford
(13-5, 7-0) did not qualify for the 16-team
NCAA tournament field. The news, which
draws the Cardinal's season to a close,
dampened an otherwise glorious weekend
for Stanford lacrosse.
"It's definitely disappointing because
making the tournament has been a goal of

mine ever since I've been here," senior mid
fielder Nina Pantano said. "We're bummed,
but super-excited for our program's future.
The day we make it is going to be great."
Pantano also took solace in the fact that
qualifying for the NCAA tournament is
much more difficult for Stanford, as the
MPSF is one of the few conferences whose
champion does not receive an automatic
bid.
"The system is kind of complicated with
all the automatic qualifiers," Pantano said.
"For example, Colgate is in and we played
and beat them. I think that our league
doesn't get the automatic qualifier sort of
lessens the blow. It makes it much harder for
us. We know there are teams in there we
could beat."
The pain of missing the NCAAs sharply
contrasts with the joy the Cardinal experi
enced just a day earlier, while winning the
MPSF championships in Moraga, Calif. The

Cardinal capped their tournament run with
a 12-9 defeat of California in the title game,
avenging Cal's 11-10 victory in last year's
MPSF final.
"It's always great to beat Cal," Pantano
said. "We were out for revenge from last
season, when they beat us in the last six sec
onds. I think what was especially great is
that we had the lead the entire time. We
truly played the whole 60 minutes and never
let up."
Stanford's defense led the way against
Cal, holding the Golden Bears to only one
first-half goal en route to a 4-1 halftime lead.
The Cardinal's dominance continued into
the second half, as Stanford notched four
additional scores while holding Cal to just
one tally in the first nine minutes of the sec
ond stanza. The resulting 8-2 lead proved
too much for Cal's spirited rally in the final
20 minutes to overcome, and Stanford
walked off the field 2005 MPSF Champions.

"Being MPSF Champions means a lot
because it's saying we're the best of the
west," Pantano said. "We fought to regain
that title and it's something we take a lot of
pride in. As much as we go and play all these
East Coast schools, we want to be the lead
er out here. We're very happy we went un
defeated in our league this spring."
Junior attacker Megan Burker led all
Cardinal with four tallies against Cal, while
junior attacker Sarah Bach and Pantano
each notched hat tricks. The conference rec
ognized all three for their efforts in the
MPSF Tournament — Pantano was
crowned the tournament's MVP, while
Bach and Burker were named to the All-
Tournament Team, along with senior mid
fielder Kelsey Twist.

named and recognized for their efforts, Pan-

thrown blood, sweat and tears into
this season. Everyone deserved to be
honored.

tano added. "I'm really happy to go

reer here: being recognized tor all my
hard work."

Cardinal opened the tournament in a
Friday semifinal against UC-Davis.
Stanford emerged with a 14-6 victory
as Twist, Bach and freshman attacker
Daphne Patterson powered the Car

ditial attack with three scores apiece.
Stanford's 9-1 run midway
through the first half cemented the
win for the Cardinal, who outshot
UC-Pavis by an impressive 41-17
margin. A stingy Stanford defense
hounded the Aggies into 25
turnovers, forcing freshman goal
keeper Laura Shane to record only
eight saves in the win.
"First off, we were really focused
on that game and not worrying about
the championship or consolation on
Saturday." Pantano said. "A bunch
of different people scored, but, most
importantly, as a team we were doing
the little stuff right in terms of
ground balls, turnovers and ground
controls. It was a pretty good game
and we felt solid going into the sec
ond day."
