# Card squeezed out of victory
## No. 24 baseball wins one of two at Berkeley; make-up game today 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Friday afternoon, the No. 24 Stanford baseball team (27-
16, 8-6 Pacific-10 Conference) played its game: solid pitching
from the start, score first, score often. The squad toppled Cali
fornia (30-21,10-10) in Berkeley 7-5.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the Golden Bears played
their game on Saturday afternoon, winning the contest 2-1 in
the 11 th inning on a suicide squeeze.
The Pac-10 series will be decided today at 2:30 p.m., with
yesterday's rubber match postponed due to weather.
The weekend's second game was highlighted by arguably
the strongest, most controlled start of the season lor junior left
hander Mark Romanczuk.
Romanczuk, in only his second Saturday start of the season,
tossed nine scoreless innings — his third nine-inning eflort of
the season — despite striking out only two batters.
"1 probably had the best command that I've had all season.
Romanczuk said in a release.
Cal starter Eric Dworkis put together a stellar pitching out
ing to match Romanczuk's. The senior transfer from Gonzaga
gave up only four hits in a scoreless first nine innings
The hurlers gave way to a bit of scoring in the 10th inning,
when freshman Michael Taylor and junior Chris Minaker hit a
pair of two-out doubles off of Dworkis to score the game's first
run.
Cal answered in the bottom of the inning when the leadoff
batter singled, was bunted over to second and scored two base
hits later, with junior Cardinal closer Matt Manship on the
mound. With the bases loaded and one out freshman reliever

Junior pitcher Mark Romanczuk tfirew nine innings of scoreless baseball, but a suicide squeeze in the 11 tfi gave
Cal a 2-1 victory and Romanczuk a no-decision.
Nolan Gallagher entered the game
and struck out two straight Cat hatters
to take the game to an 11 th frame.
The game ended in heartbreaking
fashion in the 11th. After the Cardinal
went down quickly in the top half of
the inning, Cal got things going right
away in the bottom half. A double
and two intentional walks loaded up
the bases lor the Golden Bears with
no outs. Blake Holler came in to re
lieve Nolan Gallagher — who even
tually took the loss — and allowed
the bunt back up the middle that
scored the game-winner. The bunt
was put down by Travis Howell, who
sacrificed three times in the Bears' 10-
4 win over the Cardinal last month.
"This a tough pill to swallow, but it
is baseball and that's they way it
goes," Romanczuk said. "The great
part about baseball is that we have a
chance to come back tomorrow, get
after it and take the series."

quess, who coached in his 18(X)th
game at Stanford last Monday, can
add another to the list of great pitch
ers' duels he has seen in his years at
the helm.
" This was a great college baseball
game, but unfortunately we came out
on the short end," Marquess said.
"Both starting pitchers were fantas
tic."
Junior Jeff Gilmore also put to
gether an impressive outing on the
mound on Friday afternoon, tossing
seven innings without giving up an
earned run.
Trailing 7-0. the Bears put togeth
er a five-run seventh inning as the re
sult of a series of uncharacteristic slip
ups on defense. The left side of the in
field combined for three errors, which
resulted in five unearned runs on the
scoreboard.
The Cardinal provided steady
smatterings of run support to back
Gilmore's effort, including a home
run each from junior John Hester,
sophomore Adam Sorgi and Taylor.
Stanford will make up the rained
out game tomorrow at Berkeley be
