How much can a team grow in three days?
After an ugly ninth-place finish at the Pacific-10
Conference Championship two weeks ago, experts
wrote off Stanford's streak of 16 consecutive NCAA
Championship appearances as a thing of the past. They
picked anyone and everyone to unseat the Cardinal as
perennial challengers for the national crown.
Apparently the Cardinal don't read the papers.
Five members of the Stanford women's golf team
quelled any talk of an off year at this week's NCAA
West Regional by battling through the toughest of the
country's three regions to advance to a 17th consecu
tive NCAA Championship.
No. 24 Stanford's season came down to a mere three
shots as the Cardinal fought for their postseason lives
in Las Cruces, N.M. After 908 total shots at the New
Mexico State University Golf Course, Stanford edged
No. 5 Georgia by just three strokes en route to an
eighth-place finish, locking up the West Regional's
final NCAA Championship berth.
No. 2 UCLA took the team title in a tie-breaker
over No. 9 Tennessee with a three-day total of 889 (25
over par). The defending national champion Bruins
captured their second consecutive NCAA West Re
gional, while California's Sophia Sheridan claimed the
individual crown with a four-under-par total of 212.
Sheridan was the only player to finish in red figures.
After a final-round 301 (13 over par) on Saturday,
the Cardinal gathered as a team to see if their work
would be enough to secure a 17th consecutive NCAA
Championship appearance.
