## Women's golf NCAA-bound

How much can a team grow in three days?
After an ugly ninth-place finish at the Pacific-10
Conference Championship two weeks ago, experts
wrote off Stanford's streak of 16 consecutive NCAA
Championship appearances as a thing of the past. They
picked anyone and everyone to unseat the Cardinal as
perennial challengers for the national crown.
Apparently the Cardinal don't read the papers.
Five members of the Stanford women's golf team
quelled any talk of an off year at this week's NCAA
West Regional by battling through the toughest of the
country's three regions to advance to a 17th consecu
tive NCAA Championship.
No. 24 Stanford's season came down to a mere three
shots as the Cardinal fought for their postseason lives
in Las Cruces, N.M. After 908 total shots at the New
Mexico State University Golf Course, Stanford edged
No. 5 Georgia by just three strokes en route to an
eighth-place finish, locking up the West Regional's
final NCAA Championship berth.
No. 2 UCLA took the team title in a tie-breaker
over No. 9 Tennessee with a three-day total of 889 (25
over par). The defending national champion Bruins
captured their second consecutive NCAA West Re
gional, while California's Sophia Sheridan claimed the
individual crown with a four-under-par total of 212.
Sheridan was the only player to finish in red figures.
After a final-round 301 (13 over par) on Saturday,
the Cardinal gathered as a team to see if their work
would be enough to secure a 17th consecutive NCAA
Championship appearance.
"The wait after our round was absolutely
nerve-wracking," junior Stephanie Luesaid. "We
knew that we beat Georgia, but we also knew that
Arizona, Northwestern and Colorado State were
still out on the course. All three teams are talent
ed, and we were definitely worried about them. It
was such relief when we saw the NCAA repre
sentative walk over towards us with the NCAA
information package — we knew that we made
it."
Though Stanford prevailed in a photo-finish,
the Cardinal's opening round was anything but
picture perfect. An 18-over-par 306 left Stanford
in 12th place overall on Thursday and convinced
many that the predicted demise was on the hori
zon.
Except the Cardinal, of course.
"We definitely didn't light it up [in the first
round], but we were only five shots out of sixth,
and UCLA was only two strokes better than us —
we weren't worried at all," sophomore Lauren
Todd said. "We were in the toughest region in the
country, so the first day didn't shake us at all. Our
team has more heart than any other team, and we
knew we would fight for every stroke coming
down the stretch."
Fight they did. Junior Kelly Husted led a sec
ond-round rally by rebounding from a nine-over
par 81 on Thursday with a 71 on Friday that cata
pulted her up the leaderboard. Sophomore Jenni
Tangtiphaiboontana backed up her opening 76
with a 75, and Lue also shot 75. her best round of
the tournament.
Friday was moving day for Stanford. On the
toughest day of the week for scoring, the Cardi
nal's 301 was the third-best total among 21 teams,
and they were instantly in a tie for ninth place,
poised to grab a championship berth.
"We played really well under the windy condi
tions in the afternoon (in the second round),
which really helped us," Tangtiphaiboontana
said. "Most of the top teams struggled in the
wind, but our team played really well. I think the
biggest factor was that we all fought really hard
out there on the course. We always kept a very
positive attitude and never gave up."
Tangtiphaiboontana (76-75-74) led Stanford,
finishing in a tie for 20th place. Husted (81-71-74)
also moved up the leader board on the final day,
tying for 26th place.
Todd (77-80-77) and senior Wendra Liang
(74-84-76) took different routes to the same des
tination, tying for 65th place overall. For Liang, a
change of attitude was all she needed to finish
strong.
"1 personally got off to a really bad start [Sat
urday], and what saved my round was the fact
that I started playing with a more aggressive men
tality," Liang said. "I knew that it wouldn't help
the team to try and protect what I had so far, but
that I needed birdies coming in."
The senior's adjustment may have bought her
team a championship berth. Liang rattled off
three consecutive birdies late in the round and
played her final eight holes in two under par.
Lue (79-75-81) finished just a shot back of

Todd and Liang, tied for 73rd place.
With their 301 in the final round. Stanford sent
a number of traditional powers home early. The
Bulldogs plummeted from their third-place perch
on the final day. missing the national champi
onship for the first time in eight years.
No. 17 Arizona and rapidly rising No. 23

Washington State will also miss out on this year's
NCAA Championship. The Wildcats saw their
own 11-year appearance streak come to an end
with their 13th-place finish.
As for the Cardinal, they return home fora
week of practice before flying to Sunriver, Ore.,
to begin play fora national title on May 17.
