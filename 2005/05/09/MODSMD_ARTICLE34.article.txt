## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
With the Pacific-10 Conference season com
ing to a close, every game takes on added signif
icance for the No. 4 Stanford softball team (39-
12, 12-b). When the Cardinal played host this
weekend to No. 25 Oregon (32-22. 5-13) and
conference leader No. 7 Oregon State (40-11,
13-5). the Cardinal knew that they would need to
fight for everything. They handily dispatched
the Ducks Friday night, but had a harder time
Saturday against the Beavers, who came out on
top of a one-run, extra-innings battle. Stanford
rebounded Sunday with a burst of early home
runs en route to a 6-4 victory.
The Cardinal opened their weekend with a 5-
1 win over the Ducks on Friday. Oregon loaded
the bases with one out in the first inning, but
freshman hurler Becky McCullough pitched the
Cardinal out of the jam.
Stanford got on the board in the second in
ning when freshman Tricia Aggabao scored
sophomore Jackie Rinehart with a groundout.
Junior Catalina Morris scored her first run of the
day on an RBI single by senior Leah Nelson in
the third to put the Cardinal ahead 2-0.
Stanford made it 5-0 in the sixth inning when
freshman Anna Beardman singled, then stole
second, and came home on an error by Oregon's
leitfielder. Dani Baird scored Oregon's scored
only run in the seventh on a double play hit by
Joanna Gail.
Stanford swept the season series with the
Ducks, having picked up two wins in Eugene
earlier this season. Morris led the way for the
Cardinal with two runs on 3-for-4 hitting. Mc-
Cullough (17-4) got the win, allowing only one
run on seven hits with five strikeouts.
As was expected, Saturday's matchup with
()SIJ was a pitching battle. In her third consecu
tive start. McCullough gave up only one hit in
the first three innings. Facing Oregon State's ace
Brianne McGowan (33-6), the Cardinal batters
fared no better, managing only a single in the
first two innings.
Stanford had a promising start to the third in
ning. with a leadoff double by senior Meghan
Sickler, but OSU's defense stepped up and got
three quick outs to retire the side.
The Beavers threatened in the fourth inning.
McC 'ullough walked Lisa Allen to load the bases
with only one out, but worked out of the jam and
stranded all three runners.
In the bottom of the seventh. Aggabao got on
base and senior Heather Shook came in as a
pinch runner. Sickler's sacrifice bunt advanced
Shook to second, but McGowan struck out
Beardman to force extra innings.
The tie held until the top of the ninth when
Adrienne Alo tagged McCullough fora solo
homer over the centerfield wall. The Cardinal
recorded two quick outs to keep the deficit at
one, but could not come up with the tying run in
the bottom half of the inning.

Sickler led the team with two doubles on 2-
for-3 hitting and Rinehart also had two hits. Mc-
Cullough threw her second complete game of
the weekend and gave up just one run on six hits
with a walk and four strikeouts.
Despite a wet morning, Sunday's game began
on schedule, and both teams got off to a quick
start offensively.
Morris led off the bottom of the first with a
blast to deep centerfield. Oregon State center
fielder Natalie Johnson gave chase and crashed
into the outfield wall, only to see the ball sail out
of the park. Morris's 12th homer of the season
opened the floodgates for the Cardinal.
After the Beavers answered with a run in the
top of the second. Nelson led off the second by
taking a cue from Morris and sending the ball
out of the park to where her father was standing
just beyond the centerfield wall. The second
Stanford home run in as many innings sent Mc-
Gowan to the bench and Amy Klever came on
in relief. Coming into the weekend. McGowan
had given up only 10 home runs in 36 games.
"She was maybe a little tired." Morris said of
McGowan. "And it helps that we had seen her
yesterday and we all had a few at-bats against
her, so we were seeing her for the fourth or fifth
time."
Stanford head coach John Rittman agreed it
was only a matter of time before the Cardinal
figured out the Beavers' ace.
"Good hitting teams see the same pitcher for
that many innings, and they're going to make ad
justments," Rittman said. "I think we made
some good adjustments."
Klever started well, recording two quick outs,
but Morris's bat was hot and she sent another
ball out of the park in the fifth, this time to right
field.
Though she was no longer pitching. Mc-
Gowan stayed in the batting lineup and smacked
a two-run double in the fourth. In the middle of
her 20th inning of the weekend. McCullough
went to the bench and junior Laura Severson
(15-6) came in to pitch in relief.
"To pitch nine innings yesterday and then
turn around and be asked to pitch another game
against this kind of competition is not easy,"
Rittman said. "Both pitchers, Becky and Mc-
Gowan were a little off and good hitters adjust."
With one out and runners on second and
third in the bottom of the fifth, the Beavers
brought in their third pitcher of the game,
Ta'Tyana McElroy. Freshman Erin Howe
brought home both runners, but was called out
sliding into second.
Morris led the offensive charge for Stanford
in the 6-4 win. going 2-for-3 with two solo home
runs. She hit .454 for the weekend with four runs
scored. Howe went 2-for-2 with three RBI, Nel
son went l-for-3 with a home run and junior
shortstop Lauren Lappin scored a run on 2-for
-3 hitting.
Starting in the circle for the Cardinal, McCul
lough struck out two and gave up three runs be

fore heading to the bench in her 2()th inning in
three days. Severson earned the win in relief,
giving up one run and striking out three in 3 2/3
innings. McGowan took the loss for the Beavers,
dropping to 33-6 on the season.
The Cardinal will remain one game behind
the Beavers in the Pac-10standings heading into
the last weekend of conference play. Stanford
has clinched the season series against every Pac

10 opponent except No. 3 Arizona, whom they
will face twice next weekend to wrap up the con
ference schedule.
"Oregon State is a good team," Rittman said.
"Obviously we would have liked to leave this
weekend tied in the conference, but it's a good
conference and they are a great team playing re
ally well right now. I'm really pleased. We just
need to finish strong down the stretch."

into the outfield wall, only to see the ball sail out
of the park. Morris's 12th homer of the season
opened the floodgates for the Cardinal.
After the Beavers answered with a run in the
top of the second. Nelson led off the second by
taking a cue from Morris and sending the ball
out of the park to where her father was standing
just beyond the centerfield wall. The second
Stanford home run in as many innings sent Mc-
Gowan to the bench and Amy Klever came on
in relief. Coming into the weekend. McGowan
had given up only 10 home runs in 36 games.
"She was maybe a little tired." Morris said of
McGowan. "And it helps that we had seen her
yesterday and we all had a few at-bats against
her, so we were seeing her for the fourth or fifth
time."
Stanford head coach John Rittman agreed it
was only a matter of time before the Cardinal
figured out the Beavers' ace.
"Good hitting teams see the same pitcher for
that many innings, and they're going to make ad
justments," Rittman said. "I think we made
some good adjustments."
Klever started well, recording two quick outs,
but Morris's bat was hot and she sent another
ball out of the park in the fifth, this time to right
field.
Though she was no longer pitching. Mc-
Gowan stayed in the batting lineup and smacked
a two-run double in the fourth. In the middle of
her 20th inning of the weekend. McCullough
went to the bench and junior Laura Severson
(15-6) came in to pitch in relief.
"To pitch nine innings yesterday and then
turn around and be asked to pitch another game
against this kind of competition is not easy,"
Rittman said. "Both pitchers, Becky and Mc-
Gowan were a little off and good hitters adjust."
With one out and runners on second and
third in the bottom of the fifth, the Beavers
brought in their third pitcher of the game,
Ta'Tyana McElroy. Freshman Erin Howe
brought home both runners, but was called out
sliding into second.
Morris led the offensive charge for Stanford
in the 6-4 win. going 2-for-3 with two solo home
runs. She hit .454 for the weekend with four runs
scored. Howe went 2-for-2 with three RBI, Nel
son went l-for-3 with a home run and junior
shortstop Lauren Lappin scored a run on 2-for
-3 hitting.
Starting in the circle for the Cardinal, McCul
lough struck out two and gave up three runs be

fore heading to the bench in her 2()th inning in
three days. Severson earned the win in relief,
giving up one run and striking out three in 3 2/3
innings. McGowan took the loss for the Beavers,
dropping to 33-6 on the season.
The Cardinal will remain one game behind
the Beavers in the Pac-10standings heading into
the last weekend of conference play. Stanford
has clinched the season series against every Pac

10 opponent except No. 3 Arizona, whom they
will face twice next weekend to wrap up the con
ference schedule.
"Oregon State is a good team," Rittman said.
"Obviously we would have liked to leave this
weekend tied in the conference, but it's a good
conference and they are a great team playing re
ally well right now. I'm really pleased. We just
need to finish strong down the stretch."

No. 4 Stanford picked up two victories this weekend at home. They opened with a 6-4 win over
the No. 25 Oregon Ducks before splitting a two game set with the No. 7 Oregon State Beavers .
With the Pacific-10 Conference season com
ing to a close, every game takes on added signif
icance for the No. 4 Stanford softball team (39-
12, 12-b). When the Cardinal played host this
weekend to No. 25 Oregon (32-22. 5-13) and
conference leader No. 7 Oregon State (40-11,
13-5). the Cardinal knew that they would need to
fight for everything. They handily dispatched
the Ducks Friday night, but had a harder time
Saturday against the Beavers, who came out on
top of a one-run, extra-innings battle. Stanford
rebounded Sunday with a burst of early home
runs en route to a 6-4 victory.
The Cardinal opened their weekend with a 5-
1 win over the Ducks on Friday. Oregon loaded
the bases with one out in the first inning, but
freshman hurler Becky McCullough pitched the
Cardinal out of the jam.
Stanford got on the board in the second in
ning when freshman Tricia Aggabao scored
sophomore Jackie Rinehart with a groundout.
Junior Catalina Morris scored her first run of the
day on an RBI single by senior Leah Nelson in
the third to put the Cardinal ahead 2-0.
Stanford made it 5-0 in the sixth inning when
freshman Anna Beardman singled, then stole
second, and came home on an error by Oregon's
leitfielder. Dani Baird scored Oregon's scored
only run in the seventh on a double play hit by
Joanna Gail.
Stanford swept the season series with the
Ducks, having picked up two wins in Eugene
earlier this season. Morris led the way for the
Cardinal with two runs on 3-for-4 hitting. Mc-
Cullough (17-4) got the win, allowing only one
run on seven hits with five strikeouts.
As was expected, Saturday's matchup with
()SIJ was a pitching battle. In her third consecu
tive start. McCullough gave up only one hit in
the first three innings. Facing Oregon State's ace
Brianne McGowan (33-6), the Cardinal batters
fared no better, managing only a single in the
first two innings.
Stanford had a promising start to the third in
ning. with a leadoff double by senior Meghan
Sickler, but OSU's defense stepped up and got
three quick outs to retire the side.
The Beavers threatened in the fourth inning.
McC 'ullough walked Lisa Allen to load the bases
with only one out, but worked out of the jam and
stranded all three runners.
In the bottom of the seventh. Aggabao got on
base and senior Heather Shook came in as a
pinch runner. Sickler's sacrifice bunt advanced
Shook to second, but McGowan struck out
Beardman to force extra innings.
The tie held until the top of the ninth when
Adrienne Alo tagged McCullough fora solo
homer over the centerfield wall. The Cardinal
recorded two quick outs to keep the deficit at
one, but could not come up with the tying run in
the bottom half of the inning.

Sickler led the team with two doubles on 2-
for-3 hitting and Rinehart also had two hits. Mc-
Cullough threw her second complete game of
the weekend and gave up just one run on six hits
with a walk and four strikeouts.
Despite a wet morning, Sunday's game began
on schedule, and both teams got off to a quick
start offensively.
Morris led off the bottom of the first with a
blast to deep centerfield. Oregon State center
fielder Natalie Johnson gave chase and crashed
into the outfield wall, only to see the ball sail out
of the park. Morris's 12th homer of the season
opened the floodgates for the Cardinal.

top of the second. Nelson led off the second by
