## Artist pulls work after piece stolen 
### CAILEAN COOKE 
On April 25 a painting was reported missing from
the Bechtel Center, and it has not been recovered.
According to the organizer of the exhibit, Kavous
Barghi of the Hoover Institution Library, there are
no leads in the case. Police found no evidence of a
break-in, even though the building had been locked
for the night.
The work was one in a four-piece collection by
San Jose State University senior Mehrzad
Karimabadi.
"When the news was confirmed, I felt real pain,"
artist Mehrzad Karimabadi said. "For an artist to
face the fact that her art piece has been stolen is like
facing that her child has been kidnapped."
Karimabadi will be graduating with a bachelor's
degree in fine arts this May. Her exhibit represented
the literal and metaphorical growth within the four
seasons. The vanished piece was titled "Zemestun."
meaning "Winter" in Farsi. When the painting dis-
appeared, she removed her other
works from the show immediately.
"Every piece is an organ that
makes the body of the work — with
out a single piece, the work is consid
ered incomplete," Karimahadi said.
"Winter is missing from the year, and
I do not consider the four seasons
complete without a winter."
Karimahadi and Barghi hope that
publicity regarding the mysterious
loss will lead to the painting's recov
ery. Karimahadi has offered a mone
tary reward for the return of "Zemes
tun."
Though the long-time artist was
saddened by the loss, she said it has
not discouraged her from displaying
her work in the future.
"I will continue to have more ex
hibits in the future, since I believe art
in isolation will not satisfy my pur
pose, which is to enhance our life ex
periences through meaningful com
positions conveying messages and di
alogues among artists and art audi
ences," she said.
