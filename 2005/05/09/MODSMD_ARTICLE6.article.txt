## Bechtel hosts int'l festival 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
An annual tradition for more than 40 years, Stanford's
International Festival regularly attracts students and com
munity members interested in the sights, sounds and tastes
of cultures across the world. This years event, hosted Sat
urday afternoon by the Bechtel International Center, fea
tured cultural displays, food and live performances.
Event organizers said the festival had two missions.
"It's really the goal of the international center to pro
vide a framework that allows international student organi
zations on campus to show each other the cultures that
they come from," statistics graduate student Armin
Schwartzman said. "That's the main goal for Stanford stu
dents, but, at the same time, we want to show the commu
nity in general the cultures at Stanford. We want to create
awareness and integrate international students with Palo
Altans."
Festival planners reported they were pleased with the
event at the end of the day.
"We were a bit concerned because there are a lot of
other events on campus this weekend that might detract
some people from coming, but that hasn't been a prob
lem," said Schwartzman, who served as the event's master
of ceremonies and estimated the
turnout at 500 people. "I think people
have enjoyed it. It's a really beautiful
display of different cultures through
dance, song, food and displays of art."
While the smells of Pad Thai and
samosas may have initially lured
many visitors to the festival, passers
by said the highlight turned out to be
the live performances. From India to
the Caribbean, from Japan to Africa,
16 student groups performed songs,
dances and even martial arts demon
strations from their respective re
gions of the world.
In a performance sponsored by
the Caribbean Students Association,
Carlos Mendoza played the drums in
traditional Caribbean style. Men
doza, a native of Trinidad, said he
hopes his performances tie the mod
ern world to an older time.
"The drum was brought to the
Caribbean from West Africa and car
ried forward to this time," said Men
doza. whose wife Wendy works at
Stanford's Clark Center for Biomed
ical Engineering and Sciences. "Be
fore the telephone and computer, the
drum was the first form of communi
cation. It's the link we keep to this day
to keep our old ancient culture mixed
into the Western culture."
Mendoza said he found his perfor
mance at the International Festival
deeply spiritual.
"I played a combination of five
different rhythms signifying peace,
love and unity," Mendoza said.
"When I play the drums I just play
from my heart. What's in your heart is
what comes to the people."
