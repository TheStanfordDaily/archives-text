# Week marks Israel pride

In the opening event of Israel
Pride Week last night. Israeli ac
tivist Avner Even-Zohar argued
that Israel is at a social and politi
cal crossroads, with opportunities
for both positive and negative
change.
Even-Zohar, who is the cam
pus division director for the San
Francisco-based Israel Center, ti
tled his speech "Yesh matzav?"
— Hebrew for "There is a situa
tion?" — to highlight the uncer
tainty surrounding the nation. He
referenced coffee in his opening
remarks to examine the unique
ness of Israeli life, pointing to the
recent failure of Starbucks in Is
rael.
"Entrepreneurs thought that
everything you brought over
from America would be a hit," he
said, noting that fast food giant
McDonald's is thriving there.
"But Israeli's prefer their cafes."
But the socialist tradition that
has made Israel so different from

its peers in Western Europe and
North America is in danger of
being undone by privatization
and cuts in services, Even-Zohar
argued. The gap between the
richest and poorest citizens, once
the smallest in the world, has now
ballooned.
"Twenty years ago. you didn't
see any homeless people because
there were none," he said, a shift
he attributes to the government's
close alignment with the capitalist
United States and the decline of
the Kibbutz system.
Even-Zohar also pointed to a
rise in religious conflicts within
Israel. As evidence of social ten
sions, he highlighted this sum
mer's Jerusalem World Pride pa
rade, a rare lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender gathering in the
Holy Land that has ignited an in
ternational uproar among reli
gious conservatives. Growing dis
taste for Orthodox Judaism —
due in part to the sect's disap
proval of interfaith marriages —
has led to the creation of the sec
ular Shinui Party, he explained.

Before the speech, sopho
more Lubya Wolf — co-presi
dent of the Stanford Israel Al
liance, one of the main sponsors
of the Israel pride festivities —
stressed that the week's events
are intended to look beyond vio
lence in the region.
"There is too much emphasis
on the conflict," she said. "There
is a culture, a people and a faith.
We want to show another face of
Israel."
But Even-Zohar's talk ulti
mately returned to familiar terri
tory, as he sought to present an
objective take on the political sit
uation facing Israeli Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon and Palestinian
Liberation Organization Chair
man Mahmoud Abbas.
But even this nonpartisan
analysis was not entirely uncon
troversial. Even-Zohar equated
the Israeli settlement withdrawal
to "giving the land back to the
Palestinians," eliciting an inter
jection Armin Schwartzman, a

statistics graduate student.
"What do you mean give back?"
Schwartzman asked. "When was it
ever 'Palestinian' [land]?" In re
sponse, Even-Zohar shrugged in
casual disagreement.
Aside from the Palestinian con
flict, Even-Zohar stressed that Is
rael's political structure offers hope
for the future, noting that the coun
try's constitution is highly adapt
able to the will of citizenry.
"People of our generation have
the power to shape the constitu
tion," he said. "That's what gets
people excited about Israel."

The second annual Israel Pride
Week, sponsored by an array of
Jewish campus groups, will offer
students a diverse offering of cul
tural activities, ranging from mar
tial arts classes to parties with
"hookah and hummus."
Wolf said the week's coordina
tors planned it to he lighter in tone,
a celebration rather than a debate.
"People have felt like our events
have been intimidating and not dia
logue-provoking," she said.
Freshman Mishan Araujo, vice
president of programming for the
Stanford-Israel Alliance, agreed,
pointing to the myriad of social and
cultural developments in Israel that
transcend the conflict.
"I think it's important that the
Stanford community know what's
going on in Israel," she said.
