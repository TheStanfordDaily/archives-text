# Doctors research preventative counseling

Family planning and tobacco use are not common
topics at a typical teenager's medical check-up — at
least not according to a Stanford I Jniversity School of
Medicine study, which found that less than 50 percent
of adolescents receive preventive health counseling
during medical visits.
The results of this study come in spite of recom
mendations made by the American Medical Associ
ation in 1992 lor doctors to discuss healthy behavior
with patients before problems emerge. Research has
shown that such services effectively promote healthy
behavior and reduce risky activities.
Stanford's more recent study examined data for
eight different counseling topics, including diet, exer
cise, skin cancer prevention, injury prevention, fami
ly planning and prevention of sexually transmitted
diseases.
It found that most adolescents who received coun
seling focused on diet and exercise issues. In contrast,
only 9 percent of patients received HIV and STD

transmission counseling, and X percent received fam
ily planning counseling. The study contends that the
results are troublesome because prenatal care is the
most common reason for female adolescents to visit a
doctor.
The research also showed that 39 percent of ado
lescent visits between 1997 and 2000 included pre
ventive health counseling — a minimal improvement
from the numbers reported between 1993 and 19%.
"What's really alarming is the lack of improve
ment in adolescent preventive counseling over time,"
said Jim Ma, the lead author on the report and a re
search associate at the Stanford Prevention Research
Center. "Even though they are clear guidelines, you
see a gap between recommendations and practice."
Ma attributed the lack of improvement to the cur
rent system's focus on acute care and crisis manage
ment. This is the exact paradigm that the 1992 Amer
ican Medical Association recommendations aimed to
change, he added.
"One of the strategies is to have medical care shift
away from the acute care model," said Randall

Stafford, one of the report's authors and associate
professor of medicine. "We need to move towards a
system that's more focused on helping populations."
But Ma argued that it will take more than just gov
ernment recommendations to change the health in
dustry's present emphasis on acute care.
"It will take effective multifaceted interventions,"
she said, adding that in order to effect real change,
every sector of the medical field must get on board, in
cluding policy makers, health care providers, hospital
administrators and patients.
There is not adequate support in all of these areas
to modify the system, a situation that is exacerbated
by the fact that physicians report that they do not feel
adequately trained to provide counseling services.
Ma said. Additionally, many parents say they do not
see the benefits of adolescent counseling programs.
Similarly, while some Stanford students said they
recognize the benefits of preventative health counsel
ing, they don't think it is necessary.
