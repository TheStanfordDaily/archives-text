# Registrar speaks about internships, quarters

### KATHERINE COX 
As the quarter nears its end, Stan
ford students are scrambling to se
cure summer internships â€” some
that may conflict with Stanford's no
toriously late finals week. This year
the academic school year officially
ends on June 8, but for next year the
final day has been pushed back a
week to June 14.
According to University Registrar
Roger Printup, "every thing gets dri
ven by when the winter quarter
starts."
"Fall quarter ends late, so in order
to give students three full weeks off
for winter break, winter quarter must
start later than usual," he said. He
added that there was a time when
winter break was only two weeks
long and that "the students didn't like
that."
Printup said that the New Year's
holiday is another reason next year's
winter quarter is scheduled to start
relatively late, on Jan. 10.
"Next year, Jan. 1 falls on a Sun
day. which means that Monday is the
second, and we have never brought
students back on the second." he said.
"The dorms would have to open on
the 31st which means that students
would either have to travel on the
first or be on campus for New Years
Eve, and we wouldn't want that."
Printup attributed internship con
flicts with Stanford's quarter system
in general.
"Many internships may start in
mid-May and that is an advantage of
semesters," he said. But he added
that many companies and organiza

tions seeking student interns "often
want students who can work up until
Labor Day, and because we're on
quarters, students can work that
long."
Freshman Rebecca Jacobs said
that when sifting through summer
openings, she "just ended up looking
for internships that were more open
ended."
"I lucked out because I found an
internship that was pretty flexible,"
said Jacobs, who will be interning at
the Bay Area-based International
Diplomacy Council this summer.
"Although, in the end I had to show
that my schedule was flexible too and
that 1 could work longer than others
this summer."
Molly Goldstein, a freshman who
applied for nearly 40 summer posi
tions, found that the late finals sched
ule for this year was somewhat limit
ing.
"Most of the internships 1 applied
for didn't specify start and end
dates," Goldstein said. "However, I
did interview with the Los Angeles
Opera for three different positions
and 1 didn't get one of them because
I wasn't available when they needed
me."
Goldstein will be working with
opera this summer, but in a different
department.
Despite some student grumbling,
Printup said he has not received any
formal complaints concerning Stan
ford's late end date.
"My general sense is that students
at Stanford like the quarter system,
and would not want to change to the
semester," he said.
