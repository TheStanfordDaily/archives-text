# Technical Innovation
## Deleting the arbitrary 
### Daniel Berdichevsky 
Three weeks ago, I was nearsighted. Once I
would have had little choice in the matter. A few
laser bursts later, I see 20 / 20.
I've heard innovation in science and technology
described as the process by which the impossible
becomes possible, the unimaginable imaginable
and the unprofitable profitable. These things may
be as true as they are grandiose; I don't presume to
judge. But here's my take: Innovation — and
"progress" in general — steadily shrink the role of
the arbitrary and unpredictable in our lives.
Flat irons straighten hair; perms curl locks. You
can have longer fingernails in about five minutes.
Air conditioning makes it possible to live (and die)
in Las Vegas. Perfume, deodorant and Listerine
strips let us choose how we want to smell.
Electric lights allow us to achieve sleep depriva
tion. Cell phones and the Internet
(Thefacebook.com, anyone?) mean our friends
aren?t just limited to people who live nearby
(though the Web doesn't seem to reduce the inci
dence of dormcest).
Not even the day someone is born is completely
arbitrary nowadays. Expectant mothers can sched
ule C-sections for particular days, and now that the
mystery of conception is a little less mysterious,
many couples try timing pregnancies to fit larger
life agendas.
Web sites where you can "virtually hunt" have
been in the news lately. You select an animal you
want shot, and the company does it for you. It's
ghastly — but it's in keeping with innovation's ero
sion of the arbitrary. Why let the fact that you live
in a penthouse apartment in Manhattan stop you
from terminating an elk in Missouri?
People change their names. There?s even a
newly-minted "Jesus Christ" who issued his new
driver's license in Washington, D.C.
People change their faces. Makeup has allowed
this for years, but now we have Botox, facelifts,
rhinoplasty, photofacials and whatever Michael
Jackson did. Sooner or later there?s bound to be a
pill to stop hair from going white. In the meantime,
there?s hair dye.
People change their heights. Parents often
pressure endocrinologists to give their children
growth hormone. Adults may opt for surgery. It?s
a painful procedure involving the intentional
breaking of bones, but in a world where higher
shoulders correspond to higher salaries, maybe
not an absurd one.
People can even change their gender. Their
moods. Their attention spans. The sizes of their
various body parts.
First cable TV supplied us more choices; now
DVRs permit us to watch what we've chosen
whenever we want to watch it.
Our location and local climate no longer limit
what we can eat. Fast shipping and good refrigera
tion give us apricots in February and freshly baked
cookies as far as UPS can ship them.
So when I consider what future innovations may
bring us. I look toward the things that are still more
arbitrary in our lives. For instance, Red Bull
notwithstanding, we still have to sleep. Someday
we may see treatments that reduce how much.
To some extent, we're still limited in where we
go to school by where we live, and we're still limit
ed in where we can live by how much we own or to
whom we were born. E-learning promises to give
us more choices no matter what our location or
economic condition. Controversial political inno
vations, such as vouchers, address the same issue.
We are even changing the weather ( global
warming), and someday we may be able to do so in
tentionally. For instance, scientists have been
working on ways to divert hurricanes and to seed
rainstorms during droughts.
Studies have shown that, on average, people
tend to be attracted to others who look a little like
them. ?Love at first sight? is the most arbitrary
thing of all. Companies already sell perfumes laced
with pheromones that claim to increase how at
tractive you come across to the opposite sex. Some
day, someone is going to hit on the right formula.
On any given night you may be able to choose not
only how attractive you are, but what kind of mate
you want to attract.
A hot debate in politics, one that may have
helped sink John Kerry in the final presidential de
bate, is whether or not people choose their sexual
orientation (in other words, whether it's arbitrary
or discretionary). So far science has weighed in on
both sides, and this isn't going to stop anytime soon.
What definitely isn't arbitrary is whether tech
nology ought to keep pushing newfound options
into every nook and cranny of our lives. We should
pause more, evaluate and decipher an innovation's
significance. Drugs aren't the only things that have
side effects. Maybe some things are better off with
in the realm of choice — but maybe others, like our
children's eye color or the age when they enter pu
berty, shouldn't be.
Of course, even the most advanced innovative
products ultimately run headlong into some im
mutable arbitrages of life.
Men can't bear children (with one notable ex
ception who can't run for president because of
where he was, arbitrarily, born).
We can hide it, but we still grow old.
We can defer it, but we still die.
Did 1 say these things were immutable? 1 take it
back. I've imagined them (and I'm far from the first
one), so they aren't unimaginable. They may sound
impossible, but so was FedEx, once. And they're
bound to be profitable.

Daniel Berdichevsky did not choose his name, his
birthplace, his gender or his first language. He is cur
rently in the process of not choosing what to do next

thing of all. Companies already sell perfumes laced
with pheromones that claim to increase how at
tractive you come across to the opposite sex. Some
day, someone is going to hit on the right formula.
On any given night you may be able to choose not
only how attractive you are, but what kind of mate
you want to attract.
A hot debate in politics, one that may have
helped sink John Kerry in the final presidential de
bate, is whether or not people choose their sexual
orientation (in other words, whether it's arbitrary
or discretionary). So far science has weighed in on
both sides, and this isn't going to stop anytime soon.
What definitely isn't arbitrary is whether tech
nology ought to keep pushing newfound options
into every nook and cranny of our lives. We should
pause more, evaluate and decipher an innovation's
significance. Drugs aren't the only things that have
side effects. Maybe some things are better off with
in the realm of choice — but maybe others, like our
children's eye color or the age when they enter pu
berty, shouldn't be.
Of course, even the most advanced innovative
products ultimately run headlong into some im
mutable arbitrages of life.
Men can't bear children (with one notable ex
ception who can't run for president because of
where he was, arbitrarily, born).
We can hide it, but we still grow old.
We can defer it, but we still die.
Did 1 say these things were immutable? 1 take it
back. I've imagined them (and I'm far from the first
one), so they aren't unimaginable. They may sound
impossible, but so was FedEx, once. And they're
bound to be profitable.
