# Stanford, WTO partnership digitizes documents
## 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For scholars interested in international commerce over
the past 50 years, April 19 was a big day. On that day, the
GATT Digital Library — a collection of 30,000 public doc
uments and 200 reports related to the workings of the Gen
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT — was up
loaded online at http://gatt.stanford.edu. The library is the
culmination of a six-year project to digitize and archive the
GATT archives.
The GATT executive-congressional agreement goes
back to 1947, when several countries decided to reduce tar
iffs and establish international trade rules. After several
rounds of modifications, the GATT was succeeded by the
World Trade Organization, or the WTO, in 1993.
The WTO has thus far made 150,000 of its public docu
ments, which span from 1995 to the present, available
through its Web site. However, most of the documents
from GATT's history, which address international com
merce and trade barrier restrictions from 1947 through
1994, were previously unavailable in digital format. The
Web site now hosts digital copies of the entire collection of
public documents owned by Stanford on microfiche.
According to Charles Eckman, head of the Social Sci
ence Resource Group in Cecil H. Green Library, the new
collection should make it much easier for scholars to locate
and access information about the GATT. The non-digitized
organization system previously used to locate GATT docu
ments made it difficult for researchers who were not famil
iar with the treaty to find relevant documents in the mi
crofiche system.
"Even though it was there, it was not much exploited,"
Eckman said. "Digital is the way to go with something like
this."
The Stanford team worked closely with the WTO on ac
cess to and organization of materials in developing the
GATT Digital Library. The Web site was modeled on the
WTO's interface: The archival system and search fields
were developed according to the WTO document organi
zation and classification scheme. Additionally, the WTO
has asked Stanford librarians to help assess the cost of digi
tizing French and Spanish documents. If the WTO is able to
obtain funding, the library team at Stanford may be in
volved in the multilingual project as well.
Funds for digitizing Stanford's microfiche GATT collec
tion and creating the online digital library were provided in
part by a $250,000 grant for the Institute for Museum and
Library Services, an independent federal agency. However,
the University has invested several million dollars in the
broader library project, which included the digitization of
actual physical archives housed in WTO headquarters in
Geneva.
The GATT Digital Library project started in 1999 as a
collaboration between the WTO and Stanford University
Libraries and Academic Information Resources, or SU
LAIR. to digitize archival documents stored in Geneva.
Stanford librarians first discovered the archives when work
ing with Judith Goldstein, professor of political science,
whom Eckman described as the "prime mover for the pro
ject," to find more GATT resources for her research. Ac
cording to Eckman, both parties had a lot to gain from the
project.
"We wanted to find out what kind of scholarly materials
was available from those organizations that libraries didn't
seem to have," Eckman said. "They had concerns about the
preservation of their print archives."
During the summers from 1999 through 2(X)4. when the

WTO was not in session, Stanford librarians traveled with
25 to 75 American students to Geneva to scan the GATT
documents by hand. The digitization team set up an assem
bly line consisting of 11 workstations, two servers, nine
scanners and two metadata stations for cataloging material
in the Grand Salle, the largest hall of the WTO complex.
Almost all of the two million pages from the GATT
archives digitized at the WTO, which include central reg
istry archives, are still under restriction. As the WrO de-re
stricts materials, the library plans to make its digital ver
sions of these, which it already owns but holds secure, avail
able in the GATT digital library.
The one major group of documents not included on the
Stanford GATT Web site, even though the public is al
lowed access, is the photographic archive. Eckman said that
the complexity of organizing photographic material ac
counts for the delay and anticipated that the archives would

be available online soon.
According to the GAIT Digital Library Web site, "ac
cess to the Library will be of interest to a broad range of
communities, including scholars, non-governmental orga
nizations, commercial entities, as well as national and inter
governmental agencies."
Although improved access to important economic and
historical documents surrounding G ATT is the major ben
efit of the Digital Library project, it also fits in with a broad
er push by SULAIR to develop digital resources. Stanford
is a member of the Digital Library Federation, which is a
consortium of 33 universities, public library systems and
other organizations that are building expertise in digitiza
tion and digital archiving.
Stu Snydman, a Computer Info Systems Analyst in the


TERESA MCWALTERS/The Stanford Daily
Digital Services Group, has been
very involved in the GATT Digital
Library, working on everything from
the scanning processes to the cre
ation of the Web site. He said that
the skills, technologies and equip
ment for the GATT Digital Library

are still used and built on in a variety
of projects undertaken by the group
and the Stanford library system as a
whole, such as a robotic book scan
ning lab.
"The project gave us useful experi
ence with the complex logistics of set
ting up a production digitization lab at
a remote site," Snydnian said. "The
Digital Services Group has an ongo
ing digitization program that utilizes
many of the technologies developed
for the GATT project."
