When freshman Casey Zuber fell
in love with a pair of shoes she found
online, not being able to try them on
was the only thing that kept her from
immediately purchasing them.
"I may try a similar pair on for fit
at Nordstrom, but since I'm not sure
if they carry the ones I want I may just
risk it and buy them online," said
Zuber, who does not have a car and
thus finds online shopping the most
convenient.
As online shopping has become
increasingly popular, college stu
dents and other young people have
embraced the technology faster and
with more confidence than other age
groups, according to a campus mar
ket study conducted by Greenfield
Online, a consumer and marketing
research firm. According to the
study, 81 percent of college students
have made an online purchase.
"Online shopping is easier, faster
and cheaper," said freshman Omer
Shah. "1 started shopping online five
years ago and really haven't had any
problems."
According to the study, although
58 percent of students who shop on
line purchase textbooks and a close
42 percent have used it to purchase
clothing.

Freshman Amanda Johnson said
she loves perusing Old Navy's online
Web site because of the great deals
she can find.
"Old Navy's Web site is really
convenient, and I can find a larger va
riety of sale items than at the store,"
Johnson said. "1 also shop with Ama
zon.com because I can always find
high-quality items for really cheap
prices."
Many students said they found on
line shopping appealing because they
are able to find a wide range of prod
ucts that are otherwise difficult to
find in stores.
"1 bought a pair of amazing teal
Jelly sandals, like the ones we all had
in elementary school, online for $7,"
said freshman Audrey Brown. "It
was such an awesome purchase and
one I couldn't have made without the
Internet."
One of the conveniences of online
shopping is that it can be done any
time and anywhere â€” even during
lecture.
"Online shopping is a beautiful
thing," said Claire Cormier, a fresh
man. "I do it almost daily, and can
usually accomplish about half of my
shopping during I-Hum lecture."
Cormier's roommate, freshman
Debbie Warshawsky, affirmed
