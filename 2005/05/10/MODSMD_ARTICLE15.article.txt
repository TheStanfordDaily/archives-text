# When the mall is only a click away

When freshman Casey Zuber fell
in love with a pair of shoes she found
online, not being able to try them on
was the only thing that kept her from
immediately purchasing them.
"I may try a similar pair on for fit
at Nordstrom, but since I'm not sure
if they carry the ones I want I may just
risk it and buy them online," said
Zuber, who does not have a car and
thus finds online shopping the most
convenient.
As online shopping has become
increasingly popular, college stu
dents and other young people have
embraced the technology faster and
with more confidence than other age
groups, according to a campus mar
ket study conducted by Greenfield
Online, a consumer and marketing
research firm. According to the
study, 81 percent of college students
have made an online purchase.
"Online shopping is easier, faster
and cheaper," said freshman Omer
Shah. "1 started shopping online five
years ago and really haven't had any
problems."
According to the study, although
58 percent of students who shop on
line purchase textbooks and a close
42 percent have used it to purchase
clothing.

Freshman Amanda Johnson said
she loves perusing Old Navy's online
Web site because of the great deals
she can find.
"Old Navy's Web site is really
convenient, and I can find a larger va
riety of sale items than at the store,"
Johnson said. "1 also shop with Ama
zon.com because I can always find
high-quality items for really cheap
prices."
Many students said they found on
line shopping appealing because they
are able to find a wide range of prod
ucts that are otherwise difficult to
find in stores.
"1 bought a pair of amazing teal
Jelly sandals, like the ones we all had
in elementary school, online for $7,"
said freshman Audrey Brown. "It
was such an awesome purchase and
one I couldn't have made without the
Internet."
One of the conveniences of online
shopping is that it can be done any
time and anywhere — even during
lecture.
"Online shopping is a beautiful
thing," said Claire Cormier, a fresh
man. "I do it almost daily, and can
usually accomplish about half of my
shopping during I-Hum lecture."
Cormier's roommate, freshman
Debbie Warshawsky, affirmed

Cormier's frequent online shopping
habit.
"She's always making these ran
dom late-night purchases," War
shawsky said. "Online shopping al
lows you to find everything weird or
unique all at one time."
Given that you cannot try on dif
ferent items on when you are making
an online purchase, some students
said they were reluctant to click away
their savings.
"1 shop about once every two
months online for obscure things, like
paintball supplies that I got fora real
ly good deal, but for clothes I'll usual
ly go to store so I can try them on."
said freshman Andy Zimbroff.
For those who are hesitant to
buy clothes online, new innovative
software in development by the
Toshiba Corporation and Digital
Fashion Ltd. based in Osaka,
Japan, may one day allow people to
try clothes on virtually. According
to the company press release, "The
system will capture images of peo
ple, outfit them in the virtual
clothes of their choice, and then dis
play naturalistic images in real time,
including movement of the person
and the clothes." The system is
scheduled to become commercial
ized in 2006. but it may be a while
until it makes its way into your fa
vorite online clothing store.
Until then, students must rely on
shopping at one store consistently or
trying their luck with various manu
facturers to figure out their exact size.
"You really have to be an expert
shopper to buy clothes online,"

Cormier said. "It can he tricky to
know your size for everything, but
I've generally had pretty good luck."
Not all online shoppers have had
hassle-free experiences. The uncer
tainty of buying goods online sur
faced recently for freshman Mike
Lindquist, who purchased speakers
from eßay that never arrived.
"1 went onto eßay and saw that
the guy I had bought the speakers
from had recently unregistered his
eßay account," said Lindquist.
"Even though he used to have all
good feedback [from different buy
ers], he had a string of bad feedback
starting the day 1 bought the speak
ers. 1 think he may have died or some
thing actually, so I felt a bit weird
about trying to get my money back
through Pay Pal."
One of the concerns many stu
dents have when purchasing things
on the Internet is the possible influx
of spam e-mails that can overwhelm a
shopper's e-mail inbox.
"I haven't received too much
spam anyway," said freshman Anne
Barry. "But I use an alternate email
account when I shop online so that
even if I do get spam, it doesn't go to
the account I use everyday."
Some online sites require the use
of Pay Pal.com, an online merchant
tool, which does sell e-mails address
es and information "to companies
that perform marketing services on
our behalf" and "toother financial in
stitutions with whom we have joint
marketing agreements," according to
the Pay Pal Website.
Thus far, Cormier said her experi
ence with Pay Pal has not caused any
spam problems.
"I have had spam problems, but
using an alternate e-mail address has
at least limited the spam to an address
1 don't rely on," Johnson said.
