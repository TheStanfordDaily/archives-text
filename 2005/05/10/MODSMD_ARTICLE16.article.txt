## Editorial International Initiative provides real a break from the bubble 
### 
Forget everything you've heard about
our "self-enclosed" campus — this Stan
lord bubble has just opened up to include
the rest of the world. With the launch of the
new $44 million International Initiative this
year, Stanford is appropriately recognizing
its position and influence in the world and is
taking read steps to provide both under
graduate and graduate students with un
paralleled opportunities to get involved.
While Stanford and other prestigious
universities have often been criticized for
their willingness to focus solely on their
own ivory towers, Stanford and its Insti
tute for International Studies, or SI IS,
should be applauded for their willingness
to pop the proverbial bubble of self-ab
sorption. In recent years, the University
has seen a rise in the number of students
pursuing international relations and a
trend that favors more interdisciplinary
courses of study. Although cynics might
say that Stanford is only trying to stay
competitive with its peer institutions' sim
ilar initiatives and create "brand-name"
recognition around the world —which
could very well be true — it is very real
that this move will inevitably enhance the
research and educational capabilities of
the University as a whole.
According to recent interviews with
SI IS faculty, part of the $1(M) million dona
tion will be used to fund 10 interdisci
plinary professorships, endow the direc
torship of SI IS and fund research across
the University's schools and departments.
Although details regarding such funding
have not yet been released, this can be seen
as a chance for Stanford to finally hire fac
ulty and recruit stellar scholars who are ex
perts in areas that could use more repre
sentation on campus. The ability to award
professorships, for example, may attract

scholars who would otherwise be lured to a
university offering greater remuneration.
On the other hand, Stanford graduates
and undergraduates will also be able to
benefit from the far-reaching implications
of this initiative. Although it will most di
rectly affect International Policy Studies
students who will benefit from an expan
sion of their master's program and inter
national undergraduates who will finally
be able to receive need-based scholarship
support, the advantages of this initiative
are not limited to just these students. By
creating such an interdisciplinary endeav
or. the University is opening the doors for
all majors to explore the ways in which
their fields relate 011 a global scale. The
first annual International Day conference
held last week provided students with the
chance to hear from worldwide leaders of
organizations such as the United Nations
and U.S. Department of State. Of course,
all of these perks will only benefit stu
dents who are willing to participate in
these events, ask speakers difficult ques
tions and generally just take advantage of
the international expertise that is being
brought to our doorstep.
Stanford's initiative to become a glob
al university, while still in its early stages,
holds much promise for the entire com
munity. As a university with some of the
most extensive interdisciplinary pro
grams in the country, it is exciting to see it
expanding to become more of an interdis
ciplinary and international school. By cre
ating this initiative, it is clear that faculty
and administration are already on board
to address global change. As students, it is
our turn to finally disprove all those criti
cisms of the "Stanford bubble" and show
our support by participating to the fullest
extent possible.
