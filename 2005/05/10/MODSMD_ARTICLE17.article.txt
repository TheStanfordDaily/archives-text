# Holt's Harangue
## Draw drama 
### 
Depending on whether or not the
housing Web site is down, the Draw
should be over by the time this column
comes out. Thus. I've decided to come up
with some suggestions for next year. It's
never too early to prepare and be para
noid about the Draw.
First, make sure that one of your
draw mates is abroad in a country that
doesn't have e-mail, phone or toasters.
Make it so it's nearly impossible to actu-

ally contact them with your housing choices.
How large should you make your draw group? Well,
there are advantages to any number. A group of two in
sures that you'll have at least somebody to talk to at meals,
and you know you'll get along with them. That is, of course,
unless she (or he) starts cheating with your boyfriend, in
which case that back-stabbing Enya listening piece of sh*t
can stay on her half of the room for the rest of the year.
Bitch.
Also, make sure you and your draw mates apply for pri
ority m several places. It's a great opportunity to get to
know the house, its residents and even get some perspec
tive on what it is like to live there. How much time do you
spend each week doing chores? What kind of program
ming is there? The answer to these questions will be irrele
vant as you cry over your draw number in the upper 2000s.
If you live in the lower row, people will often visit you to
"check out your room." You, however, are the temporary
occupant. You do not matter. It's kind of like selling your
car but knowing you won't receive a cent for it. So, where
is the incentive for salesmanship? If they slipped me a five
maybe I'd tell them the real deal.
But really the only incentive I have is that if enough peo
ple don't like the house, maybe I can draw in there again.
Thus, I do not clean up my room during draw week. Nor do
I put on clothes. When they ask how you like it here. I stare
off into the distance and say: "Oh. just fine. The Spirit of

the Mighty Bobcat and I look forward to living here again."
Then I suggest that if they don't like the smell of goat's
blood, they should not live here.
During the draw process, I find it's best to try to under
stand how each house does in-house draw. Is it by seniori
ty, by priority? By how many years residents have lived in
the house? By who is sleeping with the RA? If you ask the
latter question, I wish you the best of luck in a year that will
be pretty freaking awkward.
1 think it would be really awesome if some of the aca
demically themed houses had tests to see if you could get
into the house. For example, in order to gain priority at the
hum bio-themed Storey house, one must be able to per
form an appendix removal on one for the current staff. At
Naranja, the entrepreneur-themed house, one must be an
intern to a Fortune 500 company or have already started
one. At Roth, in order to get priority, one must have a
vagina.
What factors should you have considered in selecting a
house? Location? Food? Number of two-room doubles?
Will your friends be there? Will your friends visit? Really?
Not even if you call them? Oh come on, how about Friday?
What do you mean Sterling Quad is too far to walk? This is
so typical. No, I'm not mad. Yeah, see you around.
Well, to conclude, I didn't get a good number this year.
I call this "bad luck." Some of my readers may call this
"karma."
But to show I'm a good sport, I'm going to let you all in
on a secret. All of the lower row houses have a combination
of asbestos, locusts and termites. They will all be con
demned effective September. In order to be reassigned to
a healthy and safe environment, those students with low
draw numbers are encouraged to refuse their housing as
signments.

If Chris accidentally slips into one of these houses with his
four digit draw number, it's purely coincidence. Send com
