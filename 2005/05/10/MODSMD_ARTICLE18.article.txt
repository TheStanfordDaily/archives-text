Stanford Dems to stage own filibuster
As reported in The Daily's editorial "Republi
cans Seek Tyranny of the Majority" (May 6), the
U.S. Senate Republicans are attempting to im
pose a nuclear option, effectively outlawing the
use of the filibuster to stop the lifetime appoint
ment of radical judicial nominees. Such a law
would destroy the minority party's ability to
check the majority party. For 13 days now. Prince
ton University students have been staging their
own filibuster in protest to Senate Majority Lead
er Bill Frist's introduction of the "nuclear option"
bill. In a show of mutual solidarity and protest, the
Stanford Democrats will begin Stanford's very
own filibuster at noon on Wednesday. We hope
our voice, along with that of Princeton students,
will help build pressure to stop this violation of
minority rights in the federal legislature. We hope
the Stanford student body will join us in this sym

bolic gesture, in an effort to draw attention to the
blatant attack on the independent judiciary and
constitutional balance of powers which has been
taking place.

No more Runyan
I didn't realize open-season had been declared
on Daily columnists until Chris Anderson called
out columnist Navin Sivanandam as the source of
some of the "inane headlines of the past year"
("It's a shame all these events even happened,"
May 5). What really surprised me. however, was
that he forgot to mention Andrea Runyan. who
seems to thrive on inane headlines. Andrea's
columns have bashed Stanford humanities ("Hu

manities: the killing, er, dying fields," May 5), sci
ences ("Not enough women in science? Good for
them!" March 3) and really, any major at all ("No
more majors," Feb. 24).
It makes you wonder what she's doing here at
all — she's certainly not putting too much time
writing thoughtful articles. Her April 14 column
("Don't Shoot the Columnist") contains five sen
tences of original thought. Seriously, count them.
She trumped herself a week later when she pub
lished a column with no independent though at all
— I don't mean that her argument is contrived, I
mean that the entire article consisted of direct
quotes.
If the Runyan can't fill her article with intelli
gent thought, the least The Daily can do is replace
her with more bunny conversations.
