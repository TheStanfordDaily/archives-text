## Former Stanford president and environmental expert addresses students, faculty

"Now is a fabulous time to work on a scien
tific journal." said former University President
Donald Kennedy at last night's lecture entitled
"What's Around the Corner in Science." He
rapidly covered a gamut of topics, ranging from
the human genome to space science to AIDS
prevention to global climate change.
"This is an interesting time for science not
only because the science itself is exciting, but
also because in a number of areas scientific ad
vances have converged with important policy

decisions and invited political controversy,"
Kennedy said.
He first tackled the competition between
public and private research in genomics and the
religious politics of stem cell research.
"My position on stem cells is that it is a mis
take to restrict research because it limits scien
tific possibility and because the controversy
arises from religious objections, not ethic uni
versals," Kennedy said.
He then evaluated the general public's lack
of interest in space exploration, lamenting the
fact that people are concerned only with what
directly impacts their lives on earth.
"I wish we could find ways of making robot
ic missions sexier," Kennedy said.
Turning his attention to the U.S. govern
ment's recent $15 million initiative to fight
the spread of HIV and AIDS in developing
countries, he explained that the "ABC pro-

gram" — which Kennedy said is
short for "abstinence, be faithful and
condom usage" — is the hallmark of
the initiative, which is backed by
USA ID, a federal organization that
distributed resources to developing
nations to alleviate poverty and en
courage democracy.
An editor in chief of Science maga
zine, Kennedy referred to climate
chance as "an absolutely critical issue,"
adding that even without the accumu
lation of greenhouse gases, global
warming will still occur.
He also argued that U.S. policy re
sponses to scientific issues often hinge
on electoral outcomes.
"This administration is not science
friendly and doesn't care a lot about
science," he said, referring to decisions
made by President George W. Bush.
However, sparking public interest
in scientific topics can be even more
difficult than garnering government

attention, particularly because a ma
jority of American citizens report that
they do not believe in evolution.
Kennedy said.
"Waking this society is difficult —
we are impatient." he added. "We are
at some risk fora retreat in enlightened
thinking."
The event was the second in the
Public Lecture Series in Science
sponsored by the Stanford Scientific
Review.
Junior Diana Tseng, director of the
Scientific Review, said that while she
was happy with the turnout, she would
like to see more people attend future
talks.
According to Consulting Human
Biology Prof. Renu Heller, the Scien
tific Review's faculty mentor, this lec
ture series should be of great value to
the Stanford community.
"It'sclear now that science has pro
ceeded to a level where society needs
to take interest," Heller said. "If the
public doesn't know where their
money is going, then it's their loss.
Stanford is doing this for the public,
with the feeling that it has the respon
sibility to educate others."
