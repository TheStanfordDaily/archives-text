# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## An ode to John Mason 
### 
You may not know who John
Mason is but you should. You see,
John Mason is a victim and is the
most tolerant man in America. It
would he hard for you to escape the
hubbub surrounding last week's
"runaway bride" coverage — rife
with the thinly veiled accusations of
the would-be heir to the Scott Pe
terson Jerk-Husband Hall of Fame.
And by exercising his Constitution
al right to refuse to voluntarily sub-

Mit to a polygraph examination (albeit fora whole two
hours), he became America's most suspicious man.
Parents were watching their kids around him, and he
was cast sidelong glances everywhere in a community
where days before, he was a favorite son.
What's most egregious is that John had already tol
erated a great deal. 1 mean, six hundred people at the
wedding? Fourteen bridesmaids? Fourteen grooms
men? Let me tell you something folks, none of that
was John's idea. You see. when a man proposes, his
proposal is just for the girl — that's all he wants, that's
all he needs. The counter-proposal, however, is the
months (here, years) of planning the associated event
— and that (at least in Georgia) belongs solely to the
bride. And when she says "yesV to you, you're also
agreeing to her. Now that's not to say that there aren't
those guys out there who actually enjoy picking out
flowers, china patterns, invitations or reception halls,
but my hunch is, they're in the serious minority. John's
a nice guy and tolerated all of this, probably even
missed his share of NASCAR coverage, all because he
loved Jennifer. And what did he get for his trouble?
The enduring hatred of a nation bent on looking at
every man as a potential predator.
There is a clear double standard here — if John
had been the one to leave without a trace, he would

have already been tried and convicted by the court of
public opinion. I mean, what kind of man would leave
his bride standing at the altar on what was supposed
to be the most memorable day of her life? He
wouldn't have been found, his body would have been
"discovered" ... probably up on two pieces of wood,
no less. But because it was Jennifer, she was just "ner
vous" and needed some time to think; she got a free
pass. Okay folks, there's a lot of different reasons to
go to Las Vegas. A lot. But one of them is not to "clear
your head and think." There are even fewer reasons
to go there with a new haircut and a one-way bus tick
et, and again, not so much "to think." I mean, if one of
these two is the next Scott Peterson — which one
snuck out of town with a new hairdo? Of course when
Scott did it, it was "suspicious," but for Jennifer it's
"understandable" and "she was troubled"?
I don't care what Jennifer's lawyer says. She's a
criminal. Her plan was premeditated (both the wed
ding and the escape) and caused the untold pain and
suffering of hundreds — and that's to say nothing of
what she did to John. The media isn't the real criminal
here, they're just stupid, and they didn't say anything
we all weren't thinking. There's also a civil case here,
and if you're reading this, John, as soon as I get my bar
card in November, I'll represent you pro bono.
Finally, in the craziest turn of the story yet. it ap
pears John still wants to marry Jennifer. Now. I can
not fathom how you can begin to forgive someone for
something like this, or how you could ever trust some
one like Jennifer again. But if that is. indeed, the case,
Jennifer, I have something to tell you. You'd better
grab a hold of John, because "runaway brides" only
get second chances in the movies.
