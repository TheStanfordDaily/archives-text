## Soto Tape Chronicles Discovering the joy of water polo 
### 
Spring quarter is the time to try new
things, from Wiffle ball in the lounge to
philosophy classes. In the sports world
my new hobby is watching women's water
polo.
I love being at the games and feeling like
I'm on some tropical vacation. I love basking
in the sun at Avery and hearing the water lap
the sides of the pool. I like the sense of com
munity with the small number of fans who go
regularly to the games and getting to know
the players and their style of play.
I've gotten used to the constant whistles,
even though I remain completely inept at de
termining what is a foul and what is Oscar
worthy acting. I've finally learned the two-

meter rule (the water polo
equivalent of offsides) and
figured out the ejection rule
(the water polo equivalent
of time-outs in preschool).
I even discovered why
water polo caps have the
funny looking ear guards. I
always figured that, with all
the grappling that goes on in
the pool above and below

the surface, the ear guards were meant to
keep you from having to dive down to the bot
tom of the pool to recover your cartilage. My
water polo-watching friends disagreed. The
Human Biology major among them main
tained that it was to protect the eardrum from
rupturing after a particularly nasty slap to the
head.
I don't know much about auricular anato
my, so after weeks of lively sparring, I finally
asked the expert, my friend on the water polo
team. She confirmed the eardrum hypothesis.
Go figure.
She also said that despite the ear coverings
the players do hear what is said in the stands.
This validates all the times 1 cheered at the
games, but it also has serious implications for
this weekend's NCAA Tournament in Ann
Arbor, where it was announced that Stanford,
the third seed, will have to play the host
Michigan Wolverines in the first game of the
eight-team tournament.
It is important for Stanford to beat Michi
gan because the two schools are neck-and
neck for the 2005 NACDA Director's Cup
with the fall and winter seasons in the books.
It is important for Stanford to beat Michi
gan because it would be disappointing to
work so hard all season long, travel so far and
come up short of the ultimate goal.
But really, Stanford has to beat Michigan
on Friday afternoon so that they can start lay
ing last year's demons to rest.
Last year, the table was set for the No. 2
ranked Cardinal to challenge USC in the title
game. After two regular season losses and
with the home crowd behind the Cardinal, it
seemed like Stanford would finally solve the
Trojan riddle. But sports are fickle and com-

petition is unpredictable. With ev
eryone focused on the final game,
unheralded Loyola Marymount
snuck in and wrecked the party with
a last-second game-winning goal in
the semifinals.
This year's team has learned
from that experience. Though last
year's disappointment doesn't hang
over the players' heads constantly,
the lessons from that LMU loss
have shaped the way the team will
approach this weekend's games.
There is much to look forward
to in the tournament. If Stanford
advances to Saturday's second
round it'll have to face USC again,
a team it heat for the first time in
two years last weekend at the
MPSF Tournament. If Stanford
moves on to the championship
game, they will likely have to face
UCLA. The Bruins are last year's

Trojans: In three head-to-head
matches, the Cardinal have no vic
tories to celebrate. The Bruins
have a potent lineup starring sev
eral upperclassmen that missed
last season because of commit
ments to the U.S. National Team.
Stanford is anxious to prove to
USC that the MPSF game was no
fluke and ready to take another
shot at UCLA, but the team knows
it can't overlook Michigan.
As my friend on the team says,
"We know that if we don't concen
trate enough on the first game we
won't make it to the second, and if
we don't concentrate on the second
we won't make it to the third."
The plastic protective ear cups
won't block out the home crowd at
Canham Natatorium and there
won't be too many students making
the trip to cheer on the Cardinal,
but the team has waited all year for
this moment and they have the tal
ent and altitude to win it all.
