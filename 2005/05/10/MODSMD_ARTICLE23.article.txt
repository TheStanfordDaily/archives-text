# Cal takes rubber game from Cardinal, 9-5
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Three batters into the bottom of the first inning yesterday
at Berkeley's Evans Diamond, it was hard to believe that this
was the same California team that needed an 11th inning
squeeze bunt to steal a 2-1 victory from Stanford two days
earlier.
Back-to-back-to-back hits off of Stanford sophomore
starter Matt Leva — the last a home run by Chris Errecart —
staked the Bears to an early 3-0 lead and paved the way fora
9-5 win in the rubber game of the series, which was delayed
one day after Sunday's contest was postponed due to rain.
After Leva retired the next three batters, Stanford (27-17,
8-7 Pacific-10 Conference) took the sophomore right-hander
off the hook — for the tim ,-ing — with five runs in the top
of the second against Cal starter Michael Cooper.
With two outs, freshman Brendan Domaracki was hit by a
pitch and junior Chris Lewis reached on an error by senior third
baseman Matt Einspahr. The ball also rolled under the glove of
junior leftfielder Allen Craig, who was also charged with an
error, allowing Domaracki and Lewis to advance to third and
second, respectively. Sophomore Jim Rapoport followed with a
two-run double to left-centerfield, sophomore Adam Sorgi sin
gled and junior Jed Lowrie launched a three-run shot to deep
right. Just like that, Cal's lead was no more.
The two-out rally gave Stanford a 5-3 lead, but it, too,
would quickly evaporate.
Mike Van Winden led off the bottom half of the second
with a single for Cal (31-21,11-10) and advanced to third two
outs later on a stolen base and a throwing error by Stanford
sophomore catcher John Hester. Leadoff hitter Craig, who
finished 4-for-5, doubled to center and Josh Satin drilled a
home run to give Cal a 6-5 lead and end Leva's afternoon.
The Bears added one more in the third and two more un
earned insurance runs in the fifth on a two-out single by
Einspahr off of sophomore reliever Blake Holler. Matt
Swanson and Travis Talbott came on to shutout the Cardinal
over the final 71/3 innings in relief of Cooper, allowing only
five hits combined.
Sorgi, who had at least two hits in all three games of the
series, was 3-for-5, and John Mayberry, Jr. had two hits for
Stanford.
Leva dropped to 3-2 after allowing six runs on six hits in
just 12/3 innings. Swanson picked up the win to improve to
6-2 after allowing no runs on five hits, walking two and strik
ing out two in five innings of relief.
Cal had lost seven straight series dating back to 2001 be
fore yesterday's win.
With the loss, Stanford remains in fifth place in the Pac
-10.4.5 games behind conference leader Oregon State (14-4).
Stanford will complete its season-long six-game road
swing tonight when it returns to action at Santa Clara at the
recently opened Stephen Schott Stadium. The Broncos
opened the new stadium on April 30 with a 13-inning, 3-2 win
over Gonzaga.
That marathon was reminiscent of Stanford's final trip to
Buck Shaw Stadium, where the Broncos played since 1963,
on April 27 of last year. Stanford won 12-8 in a game that went
14 innings and lasted five hours and 18 minutes. The teams
combined to use 46 players and 15 pitchers in the game, which
was delayed for eight minutes when the infield sprinklers
went on with the bases loaded and no outs in the top of the
14th.
Stanford is 1-1 against the Broncos this season. The Car
dinal came back from a 6-0 deficit to win 7-6 on April 5 and
lost 7-5 on April 26. Today's first pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m.
