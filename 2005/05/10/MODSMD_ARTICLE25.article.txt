## Tom Emanski Defensive Drill All Stars solidify top ranking 
### 
'ITie Tom Emanski Defensive Drill All Stars took
the field in the rain on Sunday afternoon not know
ing whether they would be given an opportunity to
defend their newly-earned No. I ranking in Division
2 intramural softball. Rather than facing their sched
uled opponent, Roble, the Emanski All Stars took
on AEPi in a highly anticipated matchup of the only
two remaining undefeated teams in the 4 P.M.
league.
After Emanski senior third baseman Spencer
Porter came up with some timely offense, though,
the All Stars were alone at the top of the standings
after cruising to an 84) victory. (Porter is a sports
columnist for the Stanford Daily.)
Due to the absence of senior starter Noah Velt
man, sophomore hurler Preston Clover and senior
third baseman Glenn Bean, the shorthanded All
Stars had anticipated a struggle, but it was no contest
from the start. Porter's home run in the bottom of
the second inning provided the All Stars with an
early lead, but he added another in the fourth — a
towering drive over the leftfielder that scored Dailv

Sports Editor junior Dan McCarthy and pushed the
All Stars' lead lo,f>-().
"I would personally call myself player of the
game," Porter said of his performance — a career
day on which he went 3 for 4 with 3 RBI.
Porter's second bomb also aided the other Eman
ski hitters.
"I think my greatest accomplishment wasn't so
much the second home run, but the fact that after
ward the left fielder moved about twenty yards deep
er. so that [sophomore second baseman] Sam [Tanz
er]'s hit dropped in front of him," he continued.
Having allowed only one run on the season, the
Emanski All Stars were expecting to rely on their de
fense, which helped Clover produce a perfect game
last Saturday against Escondido Village. AEPi put
runners on the corners in the first inning thanks to a
rare error by shortstop McCarthy and a well-placed
base hit but failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the
first, too. the normally dangerous top of the Emans
ki order could not produce, leaving the score tied at
zero at the end of the first frame.

Alter their first-inning defensive lapse, however,
the All Stars did not allow a runner past first base. At
the plate, too, in what became a recurring theme lor
the All Stars, the bottom of the order picked up the
slack. In addition to Porter's hitting display, Tanzer
went 2 for 4 and junior catcher Andrew Rogers
picked up his first RBI of the season, despite almost
being ejected fora dangerous slide into second base.
Porter also discussed the impc )rtance ol conditioning
— a critical factor in the upcoming playoffs, which re
quire three games in a single afternoon.
"I was gassed rounding third on the second home
run,"he said. "The fact that I was able to cross home
plate was a minor miracle in and of itself."
Hie Emanski All Stars face the Wankers next
Sunday at Sand Hill 1M Fields.
