# ASSU Senate discusses costly textbooks
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
Members of the seventh ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate have already set themselves apart from
their predecessors, changing their meeting time to
9 p.m. on Monday nights and their location to the
lounge in Castano in Manzanita Park. For most of
the session. Joe Moore, course materials manager
at the Stanford Bookstore, spoke on climbing
textbook prices, and afterward, the Senate passed

several funding and budget modification bills.
Moore explained the current policy for pricing
of course materials.
"Prices for new textbooks are set by publishers,
not by the Bookstore," he said. "They'll either
charge us a net price fora book or they'll have a
suggested retail price. The average mark-up for
the book store industry in general is 25 percent."
Thus, students can save 25 percent simply by
buying used books. But, as most students know,
used books aren't always readily available at the
Stanford Bookstore.

And because obtaining used course materials
from outside sources is often a problem, Moore
encouraged students to sell back their books at the
end of each quarter.
"Every finals week we have a very big buy
back list up for the upcoming quarter." Moore
said. "If there's a book you want to sell and we
have an order for it for an upcoming quarter, then
your chances of getting a good price on it are pret
ty good. If it's a book that we need, we'll give you
half of what you paid."
Moore said that it's also advanta
geous for the Bookstore to sell and
purchase used books because then it
avoids paying shipping costs.
"The most important aspect of
textbook acquisition is getting or
ders early from the faculty before
students leave for the summer so
that they can sell their books back,"
Moore said. "My goal is to get as
many used books as possible."
In an effort to meet this objec
tive, Moore said he sent out letters
to the entire Stanford faculty sug
gesting that they submit book lists
for their autumn quarter classes by
May 15.
"The response is a little more
positive than it has been in the past,
but it's too early to tell," Moore said.
One senator suggested that ship
ping costs could be avoided by pur
chasing books that have their text
posted online. But Moore said there
has been much resistance to the idea
of electronic workbooks and text
books.
Another senator expressed his
concern about the high prices of
course readers, but Moore said the
Bookstore cannot control these
prices because they are produced by
an outside source.
"The Bookstore and the Univer
sity made the decision to outsource
course readers a couple of years ago
because there's such a liability about
copyright material, so it needs to be
done right," Moore said.
Following the presentation, the
Senate voted to allocate $14,492
from the general-fee fund to various
student groups, including the Jewish
Leadership Council, Stanford Raa
gapella, the Black Family Gathering
Committee and the Stanford Drag
on Boat Club.
The Senate also unanimously
passed a bill that abolished the assis
tant publications director position of
the ASSU's Publications Board — a
post typically filled by an undergrad
uate — because it was felt that the
funding coordinator of Stanford
Student Enterprises, which works
closely with the ASSU, and the pub
lications director could perform all
of its functions effectively.
