the stated goals of the academy in
clude encouraging study and service,
promoting public exchange of ideas,
mentoring the next generation and
recognizing excellence.
The Stanford fellows were nomi
nated and elected by current mem
bers of the academy in a highly com
petitive process that honors scholars
who have made significant contribu
tions to their respective fields and so
ciety as a whole. The fellows reflect
the diversity in discipline and
thought that the Academy embraces,
representing fields from statistics to
biology.
The 2005 academy class of 213
men and women also includes actor
and director Sidney Poitier. jour
nalist Tom Brokaw and Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehn
quist.
Robert Keohane, a fellow at Stan
ford's Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, was also
honored recently, being named to

the National Academy of Sciences
on May 3. This private organization
recognizes scientists and engineers
who are making significant contribu
tions to the progression of science
and its use in society.
While the honor does not neces
sarily include any responsibilities, it
does offer opportunities. Malenka
said that as a fellow, he may "[help]
out on various committees that pro
duce reports on the societal impacts
of various scientific discoveries and
public policies."
Even so, election to the academy
is a major mark of distinction for the
fellows.
"To be thought to be worthy of
being in that company is a real com
pliment," Roberts said. "The Uni
versity's representation is a "testa
ment to the quality of the intellectu
al community that is Stanford."
Felstiner said he was similarly
flattered by the recognition.
"Naturally I'm pleased, and while
the honor doesn't make it any easier,
next day in class, to get Emily Dick
inson's or Robert Frost's so-neces
sary genius into 50 minutes, I feel at
least temporarily buoyed by a sign of
support," he said.
