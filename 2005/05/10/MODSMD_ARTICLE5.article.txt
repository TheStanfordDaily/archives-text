## Journalists address post 9/11 coverage 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I n recent years, media bias has come
to the forefront of the public discourse
on the state of American journalism,
with those in the field and regular citi
zens alike questioning the conservative
or liberal bent of many high-profile
publications.
But for many in the business, the
question is better framed in terms "ad
versarial" or "deferential" when it
comes to the relationships between the
media and those in power.
Three top print journalists and one
media scholar addressed this issue last
night during a panel discussion entitled,
"Adversarial of Deferential Journal
ism: Press Performance in the Post-9/11
E:ra."
The panelists included Lance Ben
nett, director of the Center for Com
munication and Civic Engagement at
the University of Washington; James
Fallows, a national correspondent for
The Atlantic Monthly; Dana Priest, na
tional security correspondent for The
Washington Post; and Philip Taubman.
the Washington. D.C. bureau chief for
The New York Times.

Taubman summed up the evening's
central question: "Are we lapdogs to
the Bush administration or are we
watchdogs?"
Not surprisingly, much of the sym
posium addressed the media's cover
age of President George W. Bush's
claims that Iraq possessed weapons of
mass destruction. Few newspapers
doggedly questioned his administra
tion's agenda, which some later pub
licly regretted. The Times, for instance,
apologized to its readers in an editorial
for its reporting on the lead-up to the
U.S. invasion of Iraq: "Looking back,
we wish we had been more aggressive
in re-examining the claims as new evi
dence emerged — or failed to
emerge."
The Post has been similarly criti
cized, but Priest defended the paper,
arguing that some of its reporters chal
lenged the weapons of mass destruc
tion claims, but that these stories were
glossed over by the Democratic Party
in order to stir a more heated political
debate.
Priest drew parallels between this
situation and reporting done on the
Central Intelligence Agency's system
of detainment, transportation and in
terrogation of suspected terrorists.
"It's incredible to me and the others
who wrote the stories that there has not
been more public debate about these
claims, especially in Congress," she
said.
Bennett argued that it may be im
possible for the press to function prop
erly in the absence of a strong opposi
tion party.
He questioned whether national
newspapers were too accepting of the
Bush administration's denial that Abu
Cihraib was part of a larger, govern
ment-sanctioned system of torture.
"How much evidence does it take to
call it 'torture,' instead of 'a case of iso
lated and regrettable abuse'?" Bennett
asked the audience.
Fallows suggested that news cover
age in the last few years has been undu
ly influenced by the fact that the two
cities targeted in the Sept. 11 attacks.
New York and Washington, D.C., also
happen to be "high citadels of the
press."
"If those attacks had come to other
cities, we would n< >t have seen The New
Yorker maga/ine. the week before the
war, publish a pro-war editorial," Fal

lows said.
The three journalists all spoke of the
difficulty in covering an administration
that is minimally accessible to the press.
Priest said that more and more govern
ment information has been classified
for national security reasons.
Fallows pointed out that members
of the administration frequently dis
count reported information simply be

cause it comes from The Post or The
Times.
" This is the first group of politicians
I've seen that views the press as funda
mentally illegitimate," he said.
During the question-and-answer
session, several members of the audi
ence suggested that the media inten
tionally squelches stories that are criti
cal of the administration, a claim that

the three journalists strongly denied.
"The allegation that the media cov
ers things up—l don't understand,"
Priest said. "Why? What would be the
motive?"
Several audience members groaned
when Fallows said his next story in llie
Atlantic Monthly will address the pos
sibility that there might never be anoth
er Democratic president.
