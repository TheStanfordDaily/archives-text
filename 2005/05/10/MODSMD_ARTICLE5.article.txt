## Journalists address post 9/11 coverage 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I n recent years, media bias has come
to the forefront of the public discourse
on the state of American journalism,
with those in the field and regular citi
zens alike questioning the conservative
or liberal bent of many high-profile
publications.
But for many in the business, the
question is better framed in terms "ad
versarial" or "deferential" when it
comes to the relationships between the
media and those in power.
Three top print journalists and one
media scholar addressed this issue last
night during a panel discussion entitled,
"Adversarial of Deferential Journal
ism: Press Performance in the Post-9/11
E:ra."
The panelists included Lance Ben
nett, director of the Center for Com
munication and Civic Engagement at
the University of Washington; James
Fallows, a national correspondent for
The Atlantic Monthly; Dana Priest, na
tional security correspondent for The
Washington Post; and Philip Taubman.
the Washington. D.C. bureau chief for
The New York Times.

Taubman summed up the evening's
central question: "Are we lapdogs to
the Bush administration or are we
watchdogs?"
Not surprisingly, much of the sym
posium addressed the media's cover
age of President George W. Bush's
claims that Iraq possessed weapons of
mass destruction. Few newspapers
doggedly questioned his administra
tion's agenda, which some later pub
licly regretted. The Times, for instance,
apologized to its readers in an editorial
for its reporting on the lead-up to the
U.S. invasion of Iraq: "Looking back,
we wish we had been more aggressive
in re-examining the claims as new evi
dence emerged â€” or failed to
emerge."
The Post has been similarly criti
cized, but Priest defended the paper,
arguing that some of its reporters chal
lenged the weapons of mass destruc
tion claims, but that these stories were
glossed over by the Democratic Party
in order to stir a more heated political
debate.
Priest drew parallels between this
situation and reporting done on the
Central Intelligence Agency's system
