Stanford students may discover a new way to
manage stress and fine-tune their mental capaci

by philanthropist Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the
founder of the world's largest volunteer-based
non-governmental organization, and Nobel
Prize-winning economist Myron Scholes, a for
mer Stanford business professor. In their speech,
the two will give audience members advice on
how to better balance day-to-day responsibilities
so that they can more effectively help others and
achieve future personal goals.
Many students may already be acquainted
with Shankar through classes offered through his
foundation, the Art of Living Foundation. Psy
chology graduate student Emma Seppala decid
ed to plan the event after attending one of the
Foundation's six-day courses on yoga-based
breathing techniques designed to relieve stress.
Kanishka Shrivastava, a computer science
graduate student who also took an Art of Living
course, said he was skeptical of the breathing
techniques beforehand, but has benefited from
the program since.
