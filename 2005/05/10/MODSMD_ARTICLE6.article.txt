# Mental capacity improved
## Students get rid of stress 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students may discover a new way to
manage stress and fine-tune their mental capaci
ties at tonight's talk "Leadership and Trust," led
by philanthropist Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the
founder of the world's largest volunteer-based
non-governmental organization, and Nobel
Prize-winning economist Myron Scholes, a for
mer Stanford business professor. In their speech,
the two will give audience members advice on
how to better balance day-to-day responsibilities
so that they can more effectively help others and
achieve future personal goals.
Many students may already be acquainted
with Shankar through classes offered through his
foundation, the Art of Living Foundation. Psy
chology graduate student Emma Seppala decid
ed to plan the event after attending one of the
Foundation's six-day courses on yoga-based
breathing techniques designed to relieve stress.
Kanishka Shrivastava, a computer science
graduate student who also took an Art of Living
course, said he was skeptical of the breathing
techniques beforehand, but has benefited from
the program since.
"The soul of the course is a
breathing technique called the Su
darshan Kriya," Shrivastava said.
"Practicing the Kriya regularly, 1 can
see a world of difference in myself.
I'm much more relaxed and my out
look to things has become more pos
itive."
And Shankar's regimen is not
only designed for students, said Nan
cie DiSilverio, an Art of Living in
structor who lives in Palo Alto. Peo
ple from a range of fields have put
the programs to use — employees of
the Shell Corporation, the Indian
government and the World Bank
have taken part in the stress-man
agement yoga classes. Scholes first
became acquainted with Shankar
and his breathing exercises two years
ago.
"It was recommended to me
through a former student who told
me of the wonderful effects of his
breathing techniques and suggested
I take his course," Scholes said. "It

was really terrific at reducing stress
and at helping me to focus and with
stand difficult times."
He added that he hopes tonight's
event will show attendees that stress
reduction can create a significantly
better environment for learning and
personal growth.
"I hope that people will get an
idea that there are many practices
that have existed for generations in
Eastern culture and that [Shankar]
has taken this and turned it into a
movement," Scholes said. "Anyone
can see how it can apply to their
own lives and how it has created
such a difference in other people's
lives."
In addition to the Art of Living
Foundation, Shankar also founded
the International Association for
Human Values, an organization that
develops programs to promote
awareness of human values. The or
ganization hosts programs with
celebrities to generate capital and
offers trauma relief programs for
people impacted by disasters such as
Sept. 11 and the Southeast Asian
tsunamis.
DiSilverio said that breathing
techniques have helped victims of

traumatic events cope with shock.
"From an economics perspec
tive, one of our most valuable re
sources is human capital," Scholes
said. "There are people of value all
around the world whose value we
cannot husband efficiently. The
way that Shankar addresses how
we interact with each other can
create a greater output of human
capital."
On a more local level, Shankar
said he hopes that the Stanford com
munity will see how it can potential
ly benefit from the Art of Living's
central tenets.
"One of the main problems that
students face is attention and reten
tion," Shankar said. "My techniques
can help them to become mentally
and emotionally very strong and
sharp. They'll feel very uplifted."
Seppala said she hopes that stu
dents will be motivated not only by
what Scholes and Shankar have to
say, but also by their collective work.
"I really hope that people get in
spired to learn about what it takes to
influence the world in a positive way
and be successful," she said.
The event is at 5:30 p.m. in Kres
ge Auditorium.
