In "Journalists address post 9/11
coverage" published yesterday,
The Daily failed to mention that
the event was sponsored by the
Communication Department.
Entitled "Adversarial or Defer
ential Journalism: Press Perfor
mance in the Post-9/11 Era," the
event brought three prominent
journalist and one communica
tion scholar to campus on Mon
day.
In the article "Profs, receive dis
tinguished fellowships," pub
lished yesterday, The Daily inac
curately stated that seven Stan
ford faculty members had been
elected to the Academy of Arts
and Sciences when actually only
five were elected and the other
two, Nancy Pritzker and John
Scully, are the honorees of
named endowed professorships
held by two of the faculty mem
bers that were named fellows.
