# Students mark Nakbah, Palestinian catastrophe
## 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Nakbah is the most important date on the
Palestinian calendar," said sophomore Omar
Shakir, co-president of the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East, or CJME, during the Nakhah
Day event held yesterday in White Plaza, as part
of Palestinian Awareness Month.
The student group said on its Web site that the
event was to commemorate the destruction of
Palestinian society and the dispossession of the
Palestinian people by Zionist forces in 1947-1948.
Nakbah means catastrophe in Arabic.
The Nakbah Day event was sponsored by the
Organization of Arab-American Students in
Stanford, or OASIS, CJME and the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network, or MSAN.
"The purpose of the event is to raise aware
ness of what happened because recognition of the
Palestinian suffering on this tragic day in history
is needed to move forward," Shakir said. "I think
that this topic hits close to home because U.S. tax
dollars support the Israeli occupation in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip. This is clearly an injus
tice that most people are completely unaware of."
Though Nakbah Day will be celebrated

throughout the Arab world on Sunday, May 15,
Shakir said CJME thought that they could get a
much better audience on a weekday.
The event consisted of free falafel, poetry
readings, speeches, music, refugee-like tents and
silhouette cut outs of Palestinians who have died
during the conflict.
Among the speakers were Shakir, juniors Ami
nah West and Famia Nkansa, Hilton Obenzinger, a
lecturer in American Literature and the associate
director for Honors Writing, and Badawi Qawas
mi, a graduate student in civil engineering and Di
rector of Palestine Events for MSAN. Qawasmi is
also an international student from Palestine.
Student reactions to the celebration were
mixed, though many expressed a desire to learn
about the conflict from the event.
Junior Shahnawaz Nawabi said he came be
cause "it is a very pertinent issue for me ... I
think it' pretty great. A lot of people have showed
up from both [Israeli and Palestinian] sides of the
issue. The speeches have been very interesting."
One senior, Josias Aguiar, said "I'm here to
learn about it. We have a lot of messages from the
media and the government, but to hear from peo
ple who share that background just opens my
