## Study evaluates writing collected by seniors for four years 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
When this year's seniors were
freshmen, the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric began collecting writ
ing samples from a randomly-se
lected 12.5 percent of the class as
part of the Stanford Study of Writ
ing, or SSW. The goals were to ob
serve and evaluate the ways in
which students' writing develops,
and to use the findings to strength
en the writing services Stanford of
fers.
The selected students have con
tinued to submit papers through
out their time at Stanford and will
be asked to evaluate their writing
skills a year after they graduate,
said Andrea Lunsford, director of
PWR and the project's principal
investigator.
Similar studies have been per
formed on grade school students,
but rarely on college students, she
said.
"We are not evaluating the writ
ing — only gathering it and de
scribing it," Lunsford added.
So far, the study has gathered
more than 10,000 writing contribu
tions from 189 students. Lunsford
said she expects the total number

of submissions to jump to 12,000 or
13,000 by the end of next year. In
addition to providing writing sam
ples, the students respond twice a
year to surveys about writing expe
riences and resources at Stanford.
"Writing is very plastic; it molds
and adapts itself to whatever is
around it," Lunsford said, "Writ
ing absorbs technologies and
changes them into powerful com
munication mediums. SSW is a lon
gitudinal study that creates a pro
file of writing at Stanford and ex
plores the development of writing
and rhetoric, especially in an in
creasingly technological world."
She said that the college years
are a particularly opportune time
to cultivate writing skills.
"Students' cognitive abilities
are challenged constantly, en
abling them to think in increasing
ly complex and sophisticated
ways," Lunsford said.
In its early research stages, SSW
primarily evaluated essays. But as
the study progressed, the re
searchers began to incorporate
PowerPoint presentations, Web
pages, movies and flash presenta
tions, which the team considers to
be valuable writing samples as
well, said Corinne Arraez, the aca
demic technology specialist for
PWR who designed the study's
database.
"We're excited to see the stu
dents use all different media in
thoughtful projects," Arraez said.
"Media has the reputation of being
superficial and gimmicky, but

we're seeing students use images,
sound and even videos to create
meaningful messages. We're sim
ply exploring the relationship of
medium to message."
In addition to conducting the
all-encompassing study, SSW has
performed a more focused evalua
tion of I-Hum papers from the
class of 2005. Lunsford said the
team observed significant levels of
improvement between first- and
third-quarter writing.
Lunsford added that she plans
to approach the data differently by
focusing on case studied during her
sabbatical next year.
"We are less interested in
sweeping generalizations than
about individual improvements,"
she said.
To further evaluate the data
that has been collected, the re
searchers are creating a rubric to
determine the students' represen
tation of self, connection to an au
dience and use of evidence and
sources in their writing.
Lunsford and Arraez said that,
so far, SSW has come to three main
conclusions. First, students gener
ally adapt their writing to a partic
ular audience. In high school, stu
dents wrote for their teachers, but
college students often cater to a
broader readership. Second, most
student writing is motivated by a
desire to make something happen
in the world. Lastly, students con
ceptualize writing as performance
and that for some, writing has be
come very personal.
