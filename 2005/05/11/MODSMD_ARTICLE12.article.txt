# But that's not the point.
## A 						TV version of me 
### 
Last weekend, my dorm went on a trip
to go see the filming of the popular TV
show "The Price is Right." To be honest, 1
had no desire to go on the trip to begin with.
I was not one of those kids who regularly
skipped school and stayed home to watch
"The Price is Right." When I skipped
school, I watched reruns of "Family Ties"
and"The Andy Griffith Show." I avoided
game shows like the plague, and to this day
the only game show I like is "Jeopardy."

The reason for this
never really hit me until
I walked into CBS stu
dio and saw the kitschy
painted banners and the
flashing bulbs of "The
Price is Right." Sudden
ly, I realized that I could
be on TV. Yes, me. On
TV. I could be called
down, I could be the one

giving really bad guesses
for the prices of grandfather clocks and
espresso makers, and I could be the one
jumping up and down, hair messy and
boobs bouncing, when 1 got to go on stage.
In case you can tell by my somewhat
terrified and embarrassed tone, this kind
of TV is not my style.
I never watched TV for real people. I
still don't. But I do watch a lot of TV. 1
watch approximately 11 shows a week and
this is considering the fact that all the MTV
reality shows are on hiatus at the moment.
1 even pay the monthly TiVo charge de
spite my dwindling checking account, be
cause I am that committed to my televi
sion. But I don't have any desire to see my
self on TV — and that's not just because
the camera adds 10 pounds.
I want to see unreal people on TV. Ob
viously I want the plots to be borderline re
alistic, and I want the actors to be moder
ately talented, but when it gets down to it,
I watch TV to escape from real life, not to
see it reflected in harsh, money-wheel
game show colors.
Take my old standby, "Felicity." Most
of you paid no attention to this four-year
blip on the WB's radar, but fora lot of the
women out there, I suspect that this show is
the reason you went to college (although it
may have made you hesitate to choose
Stanford over NYU). The basic plot of "Fe
licity" was that the protagonist decides to
go to the fictional University of New York
instead of Stanford because her high school
crush Ben, whom she had never spoken to
but faithfully stalked at track meets, wrote
something nice in her yearbook. Over the
next four seasons. Felicity becomes well
adjusted, stops wearing baggy sweaters, be
comes an art major and eventually ends up
boning the said high school crush.
When I was 14, this seemed like the ulti
mate goal in life. I really think that 1 became
an RA because of Noel, Felicity's hot RA.
Clearly this show had an impact in my life.
I now know that Felicity was of a some
what crazy stalker, that she was oversensi
tive and that in a real college environment
she would either have slipped through the
cracks or meekly transferred back to Stan
ford and lived at home with her doctor dad
in Palo Alto. She would have never ended
up with Ben. And 1 know this because I
share many of Felicity's characteristics, but
I exist in real life and so my life didn't turn
out the way Felicity's did.
Sometimes (okay, often) this pisses me
off, because that damn character got away
with everything that I've been mocked
and patted on the head for during my col
lege career.
However, my own personal anger aside,
I still have a point to make. First, 1 should
clarify that I am unbelievably happy with
the course that my real life has taken and
would not exchange it for Felicity's fantasy
path. But 1 still watch "Felicity," even
though 1 know it's not true or representa
tive of real life in the slightest. 1 watch it be
cause it has a little gem of unreality to fla
vor the broth.
In other words, vicarious living isn't bad
— I actually think it can be healthy, as long
as you don't let it take over your life. After
I got over the idea that my life could not be
like the characters I see on TV (which took
some doing, let me tell you), I settled into
the comfortable knowledge that when I
need something that can't be found in real
life, it's always on the tube. It's nice to be
able to detach from all the other crap I
have to do on an everyday basis and watch
Seth Cohen mumble cutely every week on
"The 0.C."
I sound a little obsessed with my televi
sion, and that's arguably true. But TV is
good to have around when you realize that
we can't always get what we want, as the
Rolling Stones sing.
I think this column has been a little
more of an homage to one of my favorite
hobbies (couch potato-ing) than an expla
nation of anything revelatory. I just felt
like it deserved the attention. No one said
TV was supposed to be high art. It's just
something to do with your downtime. And
it can be pretty damn good.

"The 0.C."
I sound a little obsessed with my televi
sion, and that's arguably true. But TV is
good to have around when you realize that
we can't always get what we want, as the
Rolling Stones sing.
I think this column has been a little
more of an homage to one of my favorite
hobbies (couch potato-ing) than an expla
nation of anything revelatory. I just felt
like it deserved the attention. No one said
TV was supposed to be high art. It's just
something to do with your downtime. And
it can be pretty damn good.

Emily has been reading too much Chuck
Klosterman and may have unconsciously
ripped off his style in this column. If you
