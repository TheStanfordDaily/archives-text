# Best Bites
## The 						Daily's gourmet rates Row House meals 
### NOAH WEISS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After nearly a year of Stern
Dining's "squash medley" —
served every day, varying in
color but not in flavor — and
"creamy pesto" — actually an
Alfredo sauce with a hint of
basil — a food vacation was in
order. Instead of reviving my
deadened palette on University
Ave., where each meal would
have costa month's worth of
Late Night savings, 1 headed
over to the Row to mooch off
Daily editors' guest meals.
All the houses had the same

meal setup: a small salad bar,
bread, a main dish, a vegetarian
option, which usually was tofu
or vegetables substituted for
meat, and dessert. The food
was consistently above dining
hall quality, but the houses var
ied significantly in quality and
the chef's creative flair.
Accompanying me on this
culinary tour of the row were
fellow Stern diners freshman
David Sinsky and junior Jimmy
Caputo. If you were lucky
enough to draw well, read on. If
not, well, there are always your
fortunate friends that can spare
a guest meal or two.

While Grove's food was gin
gerly sprinkled with flavor, Haus
Mitt's dinner overflowed with
sauces.
Lightly cooked tofu was pre
pared in a sweet glaze with
onions, chickpeas and kidney
beans. The tofu was soft and
soaked up the sugar in the sauce,

making fora main dish that could
have passed for dessert.
Beef and chicken were served
in rich gravy, topped with sauteed
peppers and onions.
"The beef was flooded with
sauce and tender," Caputo said.
"The chicken was mildly burnt,
but still moist. It was a little too
salty for my liking."
Even the bread was sweet. The
loaf was a foot wide, freshly
baked with a light coating of
honey.
There was also plain, tri-col
ored spiral pasta and steamed
broccoli.
Ending the meal with more
sugar, coming full circle, were
chewy dough buns, sprinkled
heavily with cinnamon, wrapped
around and drenched in a gooey
maple sauce. They were so sweet
you felt guilty your dentist might
detect them at your summer
checkup.

"It was a good meal that filled you
up, but it wasn't spectacular," Sinsky
commented as he put his fork down
at Grove Mayfield. We sat down
with the diners of both Grove La
suen and Grove Mayfield, as they
dine together at Grove.
Unlike other houses where the
best dishes disappeared before one
could get seconds, Grove had a seem
ing abundance of food. But whether
the still half-full entree platters at the
end of the meal were a sign of the
$ cook's portions foresight or reflective
of the mediocre meal is uncertain.
The potato pancakes were golden
brown and thick. Unlike most latkes
that are one part potato and two
parts grease, these were only lightly
fried. Dipped in applesauce, each
bite was a sweet, moist morsel,
fp There-were two chicken dishes:
one a consisted of drumsticks glazed

with honey, while the other featured
chopped chicken drizzled with herb
flavored oil.
The biscuits were dry, but at least
they retained the natural grain flavor
compared to the processed Pillsbury
esque biscuits the dining halls serve.
Unseasoned steamed vegetables
were the side dish.
Dessert was Rice Crispy Treats
— a dessert everyone was careful to
stay five feet away from. Note to self:
Good place if you're trying to stay
away from sweet things.

Tomato halves and
slices of eggplant were
baked with a heaping layer
of parmesan and bread
crumbs. The juicy tomatoes
burst through crispy cheese
tops.
Breaded chicken cutlet
was the main entree.
"The breading was a lit
tle plain: but the chicken
was cooked just right," Ca
puto said.
Rivaling — or, dare I
say it — topping La Maison
Francaise's tender pizza
crust was Bob's focaccia,
which was topped with
roasted peppers and a thin
layer of cheese. Under
neath the flaky top, the
bread was moist and
spongy.

Dessert was good,
though disappointingly
plain, banana bread, ac
companied with a bowl of
fruit salad.
Even though Caputo
was impressed, he was not
won over.
"These meals haven't
made me regret choosing
Lambda Nu last year," he
said.

Living up to its cultural heritage, the
French House delivered with a gourmet
lunch.
Across campus, students have the op
tion of mixed lettuce or spinach for their
salads. But here, they can use the leafy
greens that are at the bottom of every up
scale restaurant's $10 salad: mesclun.
There were five different pizzas, all
served on a doughy flat bread that left
tasty flour on your fingers. Each pie was
cooked to perfection, the crust crunchy
but chewy on the inside.
The plain pizza was sprinkled with a
heavy dose of rosemary. It was refreshing
to eat a pizza flavored with spices.
Another pie had slices of salami and
cremini mushrooms.
"It was an interesting combination,"
Sinsky said. "The cook was creative."
The other types of pizza included one
topped with mixed vegetables, one with
out cheese and with one with baby shrimp.
For those who did not stuff them
selves with the myriad of pizza options,
there were also chocolate brownies.
"Clearly more homemade and more
gourmet than Stern's pizza," Sinsky con
cluded.
The final verdict? Row House food is
good. If a chef is cooking fora few dozen
rather than a few hundred, the quality is
going to be better. As for the individual
houses, it depends on what you're looking
for. Good luck with the draw — and bon
appetit.
