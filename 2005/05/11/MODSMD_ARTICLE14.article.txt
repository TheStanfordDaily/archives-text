# Bad draw number? The ups and downs of living off campus
## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many students on campus. May 5 was a big
day — draw numbers were released.
For many students, living on campus is an im
portant part of Stanford life, a chance to develop
intimate relationships with dormmates. Co-op?
Row House? Dorm? The options are many.
Yet students are not limited to the confines of
the Farm when looking at housing options. Al
though only 3 to 4 percent of Stanford students live
off campus, students have chosen to live some
where else agree that it is an option worth consid
ering.
Unlike many other universities, Stanford guar
antees undergraduates four years of on-campus
housing. Because living off-campus in areas such
as Palo Alto is often expensive and less conve
nient, many students choose to remain in dormito
ries or other University residences for their entire
undergraduate term.
"I think on-campus housing works well for the
vast majority of students, but there may be a small
number of students who prefer, for one reason or
another, to live in a more isolated environment
and who have the money to be able to afford it,"
said Todd Benson, director of housing assign
ments.
Benson pointed out that students living off cam
pus have to pay a number of fees for services such
as water, electricity and transportation. According

to Benson, the cost of living is gener
ally less expensive in undergraduate
residences.
Although Stanford subsidizes
off-campus housing for graduate
students, undergraduates are not
presented with a comparable offer.
However, students who want to live
off campus can go to the Housing
Assignments Web site, which offers
a list of off-campus housing options
that students can access.
One option for students is to live
in one of the "Dead Houses"
owned and rented out to Stanford
students by Rob Levitsky. Levit
sky, who has no official ties to Stan
ford, owns 12 houses near campus
all named after Grateful Dead
songs. Each house may have any
where from four to 12 residents,
and singles in the houses go for
about $6(X) per month.
"I started out with an extra room
in one house, which I rented to Stan
ford students," said Levitsky. "That
worked out well, so as I was able to
buy more houses, I was able to make
more houses available to students."

Although vacancies in the Dead
Houses generally spread by word of
mouth, students can also find olf
campus housing by looking through
newspapers and online advertise
ments. For example, senior Timmy
Lu, who lives in East Palo Alto,
found his current house through
Craigslist, a popular Web site that is
used by people nationwide to buy or
sell anything from books to housing
(http://craigslist.org).
Lu decided to move off campus
because he felt that housing options
on campus did not suit his needs.
"I was frustrated by the general
level of filthiness in dorms and peo
ple disrespecting other residents and
the folks who work here," he said.
Lu argues that although living in
Palo Alto may be more expensive
than living on campus, there are
many cheap housing options in near
by areas such as East Palo Alto,
Redwood City or Menlo Park.
"The money I save from not buy
ing a Stanford meal plan and not
paying for housing has been signifi
cant," he said. "As a working-class
student who has to support my fami
ly, every dollar I save by living off
campus counts."
In addition to saving money,
students may choose to live off
campus fora greater sense of free

dom and to escape from what is
often a noisy and distracting dorm
environment.
"1 would think the benefits for liv
ing off campus are being able to take
a break from the constant energy of
campus life and having a truly sepa
rate sphere in which to relax," said
sophomore Emily Hite, who plans
on living in graduate student housing
next year.
Some students also feel that liv
ing off campus is a good way to break
out of the Stanford bubble and stay
in touch with the real world.
"I sometimes find myself so
wrapped up with people and work
on campus that I forget there's a real
world out there filled with little ba
bies, middle school kids and par
ents," said sophomore Celen Zepe
da, who lives in Toyon.
"Living off campus, 1 feel I would
get to interact more with 'real' and
'normal' people — those that aren't
as privileged Stanford students," she
added.
However, living off campus does
have its difficulties. For students
without a car, having to plan sched
ules around public transportation
can be cumbersome. Other students
living off campus stated that it wasn't
always convenient to drive home
after a late night at the library or so

cializing with friends.
Sophomore Priyanka Goel, a
Roth House resident, said that she
thought that since most students do
live on campus, living off campus
might limit one's social activity on
campus.
"1 know a couple people living
off-campus, and 1 definitely see less
of them now than I did before when
they were living on campus," she
said.
Benson cautions that students
should think carefully before they
give up the advantages of living on
campus.
"There are many advantages to
living on campus, including cost, the
experience of living in a community
with other students and easier ac
cess to Stanford resources, such as
the library, athletic facilities, enter
tainment and sporting events," he
said.
Both Lu and Levitsky recom
mend that students who are consid
ering off-campus housing options
should start looking early. Lu also
suggested that they should find oth
ers with whom they would be com
fortable living fora year.
"Finding others who you'd like to
live with." he explained, "and who
will be able to support you through
out the year is crucial."

on campus did not suit his needs.
"I was frustrated by the general
level of filthiness in dorms and peo
ple disrespecting other residents and
the folks who work here," he said.
Lu argues that although living in
Palo Alto may be more expensive
than living on campus, there are
many cheap housing options in near
by areas such as East Palo Alto,
Redwood City or Menlo Park.
"The money I save from not buy
ing a Stanford meal plan and not
paying for housing has been signifi
cant," he said. "As a working-class
student who has to support my fami
ly, every dollar I save by living off
campus counts."
In addition to saving money,
students may choose to live off
campus fora greater sense of free

dom and to escape from what is
often a noisy and distracting dorm
environment.
"1 would think the benefits for liv
ing off campus are being able to take
a break from the constant energy of
campus life and having a truly sepa
rate sphere in which to relax," said
sophomore Emily Hite, who plans
on living in graduate student housing
next year.
Some students also feel that liv
ing off campus is a good way to break
out of the Stanford bubble and stay
in touch with the real world.
"I sometimes find myself so
wrapped up with people and work
on campus that I forget there's a real
world out there filled with little ba
bies, middle school kids and par
ents," said sophomore Celen Zepe
da, who lives in Toyon.
"Living off campus, 1 feel I would
get to interact more with 'real' and
'normal' people — those that aren't
as privileged Stanford students," she
added.
However, living off campus does
have its difficulties. For students
without a car, having to plan sched
ules around public transportation
can be cumbersome. Other students
living off campus stated that it wasn't
always convenient to drive home
after a late night at the library or so

cializing with friends.
Sophomore Priyanka Goel, a
Roth House resident, said that she
thought that since most students do
live on campus, living off campus
might limit one's social activity on
campus.
"1 know a couple people living
off-campus, and 1 definitely see less
of them now than I did before when
they were living on campus," she
said.
Benson cautions that students
should think carefully before they
give up the advantages of living on
campus.
"There are many advantages to
living on campus, including cost, the
experience of living in a community
with other students and easier ac
cess to Stanford resources, such as
the library, athletic facilities, enter
tainment and sporting events," he
said.
Both Lu and Levitsky recom
mend that students who are consid
ering off-campus housing options
should start looking early. Lu also
suggested that they should find oth
ers with whom they would be com
fortable living fora year.
"Finding others who you'd like to
live with." he explained, "and who
will be able to support you through
out the year is crucial."
