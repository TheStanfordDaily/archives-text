## Editorial Calling all Stanford Playboy models 
### 
Playboy magazine is visiting campus
this week in search of Stanford women to
till the pages of its annual "Girls of the
Pac-10" issue. We encourage all female
students interested in becoming a Play
boy model to interview with representa
tives from the men's magazine.
In last Friday's issue of The Daily, the
article "Playboy Scouts out Stanford" de
scribed Stanford girls' general lack of in
terest in posing for Playboy. Several stu
dents quoted in the article said they fell
there is less of an emphasis on physical ap
pearance at Stanford in comparison to
some of the other schools in the Pac-10.
One freshman female said that there is
less emphasis on "being pretty" at Stan
ford compared to other Pac-10 schools.
This attitude is understandable, and
there's some truth to it. Many girls at this
school care far more about their aca
demics than they do about maintaining
model looks — this is Stanford after all,
not Barbizon. But that should not deter
those girls who would like to take a shot at
modeling for Playboy.
We acknowledge that there is a soci

etal stigma attached to posing for Play
boy. The fact that posing for Playboy
could potentially damaging long-term
consequences fora female's professional
career is an unfortunate product of our so
ciety, and one that ought to be addressed.
But it's a shame that those who want to
pose should face judgmental attitudes.
Also, it's important to note that Play
boy gives their models the option of pos
ing either nude or semi-clothed. Think of
it like posing in your Exotic Erotic outfit.
Furthermore, Playboy is one of the
most upstanding men's magazines on the
market, and it is equally famous for its lit
erary value as for its pictures (well, al
most). Authors like Ernest Hemingway,
John Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac have
had their work published in Playboy,
which continues to be a popular outlet for
budding authors to get their work into cir
culation. So it can be argued that Playboy
is more than naked pictures.
We are not saying that all Stanford
women should audition to model in Play
boy, but for those who want to, we say, ig
nore what others say and go ahead.
