## Advice for those who make it to the top 
### 
Here at Stanford, you
have the opportunity to
become whomever you
want to be. Some of you
will continue to live in
your hippie love triangles
until you're 34, penniless
and mostly bald. This col
umn is not for you. On
the other hand, some of
you will go on to become

rich, powerful and come to rule some small
country. II this describes you. read on (or
clip for future reference).
First, a warning to all you would-be
tyrants: getting there is hard, and I have no
insights on how to climb the ladder.
Now, what I can help you with is deciding
what to do and what not to do once you get to
the top. A lot of untrustworthy people are going
to talk about you behind your back, and there
will be many decisions you'll have to make.
First, you need to choose the type of gov
ernment you want. Despots tend to have
more fun (see Bahrain), but people tend not
to like them very much. It you choose some
authoritarian form of government, make
sure to be very cozy with the army and at
least tell the rest of the world that your coun
try's a democracy.
Pretending to be democratic will help you
drink from the sweet, sweet fountains of for
eign aid that rich countries want nothing
more than to lavish on smaller ones so that
they can feel better about themselves. And
there's nothing better than free money.
Tactfully rig an election, use the word "re
form" a lot and. most importantly, promote
a woman to be your vice president or some
thing high and important. (Note: Even if you
are a woman, having another one close to
the top will only help your cause, so the same

advice applies.)
Now that you have your government and
your money, focus on your appearance. Peo
ple like a sexy leader. Bill Clinton: very sexy.
Not only could he charm the pants (or skirt)
off of anybody in the room, but the man just
looked good. He was well dressed, always
smiling and managed to stay just a little trim
mer than the average American. Much of
the same can be said for his successor.
In the "how not to be" category, we have
by far the scariest world leader: Vladimir
Putin. The man just looks evil. He scowls,
frowns, grimaces and wears that black
trench coat just a bit too often. To boot, he's
lacking a little in the hair department, which
is by no means the worst thing in the world,
but nobody would choose to go bald.
The last thing you'll need is a hand ges
ture and a catch phrase. The Queen of Eng
land seems to have a patent on her little
hand-wave, and John Edwards has perfect
ed his thumbs-up thing. Perhaps try a salute
or negotiate with Tiger Woods for the rights
to the fist pump. For the catch phrase part,
there are always the oldies but goodies â€”
God bless your country, etc. But try a little
"woo, woo" after your speeches and see the
response you get.
After all that, there's policy and society
building and taking care of your people. But
you're a Stanford graduate, so you'll either
know how to do this already, or you're real
ly good at getting your TAs to cough up the
answers (keep in touch with them).
As you can see, living at the top is not easy,
but it can be mastered with the proper tech
niques. So best of luck on your assent and don't
forget to send a postcard when you get there.
