## Israeli, Palestinian groups should educate 
### LYUBA WOLF 
I would like to thank The Daily for cover
ing the first Israel Pride Week event ("Week
Marks Israel Pride," May 12). The portrayal
was largely honest and accurate; however,
the reporter slightly misunderstood one of
the comments I made. 1 did not say that the
Stanford Israel Alliance's past events were
"intimidating and not-dialogue promoting,"
hut rather that recent events surrounding the
conflict had been. I was referring specifically
to the Hedy Epstein's talk last fall comparing
the situation of Palestinians to the Holocaust
("Tensions boil as Holocaust survivor de
cries treatment of Palestinians," Oct. 21,
2(X)4), as well as recent Palestinian Aware
ness Month events. Regrettably, Palestinian
Awareness Month has raised little aware
ness about Palestinian culture and prospects
for Palestnian democracy. Instead, it has
been a virulently anti-Israel campaign, de
monizing and dehumanizing Israel. In one of
the films shown as a part of this month re
ferred to Israelis as "evil devils" ("Students

describe violence in Gaza," April 13). Fram
ing the conflict in this way is not helpful or
educational, but rather polarizes the campus
and incites defensiveness.
Notably, all of the Jewish Leadership
Council of Stanford Israel Alliance pro
gramming in the past year related to Israel
has steered resolutely clear from labeling
Palestinians as terrorists, choosing rather to
focus on prospects for peace as well as edu
cation about Israeli society in general.
Speakers on Israel have included left-lean
ing Knesset Member Yuli Tamir and ex-
Knesset Member Avram Berg, who both
emphasized the need for Israel not only to
expedite its peace efforts but also to address
urgent problems within Israel. Stanford Is
rael Alliance was also involved in bringing to
campus Thomas Friedman, who reiterated
that we ought to be optimistic and celebrate
democratic progress in the Palestinian Au
thority and the Middle East rather than
falling back on Israel bashing. Friedman's
words can apply to the recent Palestinian
Awareness Month events, which do not eel

ebrate the fact that Palestinians held their
first open election, let you know that cur
rently plans are on the way to withdraw from
Gaza and that Israeli and Palestinian plan
ners are sitting together to plan for the Pales
tinians' economic future.
Hopefully in the future. Israeli and Pales
tinian students groups can work on events to
educate — rather than propagandize — the
Stanford community. We believe firmly in il
lustrating the nuances that are vital to truly
understanding the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict, as is obvious by our first Israel Pride
Week event. In the meantime. I urge every
one at Stanford to look beyond pessimistic
negative programming. Things are not as
hopeless as they seem. We are at a great
crossroads for peace. We invite you to join us
in our Israel Celebration on White Plaza on
Thursday at noon, in the spirit of peace and
hope for reconciliation.
