Sitting alongside Graduate School of Busi
ness Prof. Emeritus Myron Scholes, His Holi
ness Sri Sri Ravi Shankar looked into last
night's packed audience at Kresge Auditori
um and said, "I want you all to turn to a per
son next to you and tell them that you don't
trust them."
The audience's confused and awkward re
action to his order humorously underscored
Shankar's message: Many people find it un

comfortable to confront, let alone speak
openly about, issues of trust. Shankar is the
founder of the Art of Living Foundation, an
NGO that also offers many self-help courses.
In response to questions from Scholes, a
Nobel laureate in economics, and the general
audience, Shankar said that successful leader
ship is based on trust. Without it, any compa
ny, no matter how talented its employees,
would suffer in the long-term, said Shankar.
Scholes, too, emphasized the relationship
between trust and successful leadership â€” it

provides the preconditions for an ef
fective business team.
"To create a better team, enhances
the value of a business and the output
of that business," Scholes said. "To be
a good team, the team members must
trust one another to offer constructive
criticism, which will improve the out
put."
To strengthen the capacity to be an
effective and trustworthy leader,
Shankar focused primarily on efforts
to improve the self and attain spiritual
and physical balance. He said that
one's breathing bridges the relation
ship between body and mind and that
controlling breathing through medita
tive techniques can both enhance
one's interpersonal trust relationships
by improving one's effectiveness as a
friend and leader.
"Silencing the mind fora few min
utes and breathing quietly fora few
minutes each day can leave a person
feeling refreshed and better prepared,
as a leader to handle many difficult sit
uations," Shankar said.

In a video clip shown at the event
entitled "Service: Expression of
Love," numerous respondents tout
ed the positive effects of Shankar's
stress-relieving course and empha
sized how it alleviated numerous ail
ments ranging from depression to
asthma.
Addressing potential skeptics, Sc
holes said that recent studies conduct
ed at Columbia University reveal the
biological basis for the breathing
method. More specifically, evidence
from these studies proves that
Shankar's techniques stimulate a
nerve in the brain which promotes
emotional, psychological and physical
homeostasis. All of this helps to re
move what Shankar refers to as "all of
your body's impurities."
In addition to facilitating a ques
tion-and-answer session between the
audience and Shankar, Scholes of
fered his perspective on what he be
lieves constitutes good leadership and
the basis for trust.
"Good leadership is composed of
the capacity for effective learning, per
sistence, teamwork, clear objectives,
completeness and most of all truthful
ness," Scholes said. "Strengthening
these attributes can help empower and
enhance the value of human capital."

According to Scholes, what distin
guishes good leadership from ade
quate leadership is one's ability to in
tegrate these qualities in a way that al
lows a person to handle life's shocks
and recover faster.
While generally intrigued by
Shankar's method and movement,
some audience members, including
Business School student Mano Iyer,
felt that Shutikar shallowly addressed
the proposed discussion topics.
"Although I agree that there is
tremendous potential in Shankar's
teachings, 1 believe that his presenta
tion was more flash than substance,"
Iyer said. "1 was surprised that he did
not really address leadership and trust
topics."
Although agreeing with Iyer that
Shankar did not address the set topics
in much depth, Rahul Ghosh, of the
Business School, felt that the presenta
tion was worth attending.
"It was informative, and I liked the
focus on self-improvement," Ghosh
said. "The discussion reinforced a very
uplifting and secular message."
The event was sponsored by the
Graduate School of Business, the
Asian Religions and Culture Initiative
and Sanskriti, Stanford's South Asian
student organization.
