## The 						great American road trip

Jake and Elwood,
Dean Moriarty and Sal
Paradise, Raoul Duke
and Dr. Gonzo, Rahul
Kanakia â€” just a lew of
the people who've em
harked upon the Great
American Road Trip.
But of course, since this is
the new millennium, my
road trip didn't involve a

saltshaker half-full of cocaine or five sheets
of high-quality blotter paper. Rather, it was
just me, my hike and a destination shrouded
in myths and lies.
At first the bare streets across which I
trekked seemed lifeless and sterile. There
were few people and few establishments
standing out against the miles of pavement.
But soon I began to see a desolate beauty in
the byways. Each building, each father and
child, each car with a single occupant, was a
single unit. They were indistinguishable
from each other, yet completely separate. It
was as if America was filled with identical gas
molecules, filling up the available space no
matter what their size.
And 1 saw for the first time that every
thing in our great nation is designed to cater

to this dream of segregation from one's fel
low man: the drive-thru, the house in the sub
urbs with its own little lawn, the two cars in
the driveway. Even when we have to interact
with people, we make sure to do it at a dis
tance. We shop at giant stores so we don't
have to deal with the idiosyncrasies of "mom
and pop." Employees wear uniforms so we
can see them all as being the same person.
Even in the office, we demand our own cubi
cle to block out the gaping faces of our
coworkers.
Our entire culture is founded on conve
nience and isolation. We use the Web to cut
out even the semblance of interaction with a
human being. We watch TV, which doesn't
require any participation from the viewer.
We listen to mass-produced music that is in
distinguishable from everything else in its
genre. Each of us builds his or her own bub
ble and lives inside it.
That is the beauty of America. The only
way to make Americans use public trans
portation, live in apartment blocks, eat in
dining halls, or sit at the same table with a
stranger is to force them. We crave our pri
vacy above everything else. And the solution
to environmental problems is not to make
the cost of privacy high, it is to use the desire

for isolation to attain sell-sufficiency.
Americans want to live in castles. We
want to live in super-duper technologically
marvelous homes. We want to live in self
sufficient "green" houses with solar panels
and efficient insulation that let us say "fuck
you" to the power and gas companies. We
want to use battery-powered cars that let us
drive by the pump and not interact with an
other gas station attendant. We want to work
from home, saving ourselves (and the envi
ronment) hours of driving each day.
My great road trip culminated at a tech
nological Mecca, a silicon oasis, an eighth
wonder known as Fry's. In this mega-store 1
was directed by slightly accented recent im
migrants to the games and DVDs of my
choice and I was back home within an hour.
At no point did 1 have an exchange longer
than one sentence with any person. I came
back feeling refreshed, purged of the detri
tus of a year of human contacts. And then I
wrote this column ... which is somewhat
strong in the concept department, but ulti
mately lacks a point.
