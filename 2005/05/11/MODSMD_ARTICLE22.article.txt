## Supporters gear up for another month of campaining

SAN AN IONIC) — During the last hour
of voting in the mayoral election, Julian Castro
paced outside the Joe Ward Recreation Cen
ter in his home city council district 7.11e greet
ed people as though he knew them, "How are
you?" and asked for their support. I le fiddled
with his clothing and kicked around rocks in
the parking lot in between greeting voters.
The skies had been gray all day, and as soon
as the polls closed, it began to drizzle. Ner
vousness abounded at Castro's campaign
headquarters and at the polls. And as it nerves
weren't frizzled enough, Texas state represen
tative Joe Moreno, 40, was killed in a car acci
dent early in the morning the day before Elec
tion Day. Representative Rafael Anchia, 36,
was also hospitalized.
But obstacles were not new to the Julian
Castro for Mayor campaign, which seemed to
have faced an uphill battle from the start:
under-funded, under-staffed and under-esti
mated.
"A year ago, everybody had written us off,
that 1 wouldn't be able to raise enough
money," he said election night, after the offi
cial count placed in him a run-olf election.
"Tonight we are well ahead of them," he said,
referring to his 41 percent share of the vote.
"You are going to win," said Benita Her
nandez to Castro as she entered the polls,
slowly, with her walker. "We know that he can
do the job. Julian — God bless him," she said
after exiting the poll.
Kevin Lopez, a campaign consultant who
has worked on 49 campaigns, drinks a
Heineken and smokes a cigar at the crack of
dawn each Election Day, a la Bobby Kennedy.
He crunched numbers and frowned the night
before the big day.
Ross Rocketto worked 4() hours a week or
more for the campaign and even sacrificed his
spring break for the effort. Election Day hap
pened to coincide with finals week at Trinity
University in San Antonio and Rocketto fin
ished two papers early so he could dedicate time
to the campaign. He still has a final and a paper
to finish.
"I'm not shaving until Election Day-it's a
superstition," he said the day before the elec
tion.
Hard to miss were the many friends of Cas

tro's mother Rosie, who helped in the cam
paign effort by making phone calls, cleaning
the office, making sure everyone was fed and
doing all the small things that oil the wheels of
a large campaign. Anna Riojas and Irma Mire
les have known Castro since he was in the
womb, and were very politically active
decades before "the boys" were.
And then there are the lawyers. Half of
them worked heavily on the campaign, sever
al of them are Castro's friends from Harvard
Law School. TJ Duane and Jay Hulings took a
leave of absence from their law firms in New
York and Los Angeles, respectively, to work
on the campaign.
"It's not very often your friend runs for
mayor." said Hulings, who has been in San
Antonio since January. "He's a smart guy and
he has his heart in the right place."
Jorge Urby helped plan the parties for the
campaign and is on the verge of graduating
from Texas State University-San Marcos,
where he is writing a paper about the Castro
campaign for his Comparative Politics class.
"Our founding fathers were his age when
they founded this country," Urby said. "Julian
has support 1 have never seen before. He's in a
league of his own — there's no competition."
Castro, who had a consistent double-digit
lead over his opponents throughout the race,
listened to Guns 'N' Roses' "Welcome to the
Jungle" and played with a basketball inside his
office the day before Election Day, in between
making phone calls and granting interviews.
Supporters came from all walks of life, and
Castro heartily greeted many of them. Stu
dents, lawyers, friends, family members and
citizens who believed in civic responsibility
took part. An open-heart patient at a local hos
pital even called and wanted to vote from the
hospital bed.
Many from the community, such as Susan
Dumph, a mother of three and a law student,
said that it was for Castro's economic vision
she and her husband — who were not able to
vote in the election because they live in anoth
er city — volunteered their time. The diversity
of Democrat Castro's support was evident as
Dumph's minivan drove away with a"Re-
Election Bush 2(X)4" bumper sticker.
Castro spent most of Election Day greet
ing voters at polls with his twin brother, a
state representative. Keeping a keen eye out
for voters, the two posed for photos and
talked strategy at half a dozen polls that day.
They drove around in a black Blazer with a
faded 1 larvard alum license plate, stopping at
McDonald's fora quick bile to eat.
At 9:45 p.m., a band of female mariachis
sang Rosie Castro happy birthday. Later,
Joaquin took the stage to thank the crowd for
