## Right in the Babymaker Going all out for Stanford lacrosse 
### 
There are a few things 1 will not do when
it comes to being a sports fan. I refuse to
sing or dance in any way, shape, or form;
I will never do the Wave; and I will never wear
a foam finger. You will notice that painting my
torso and generally making an ass of myself is
not one of the prohibited activities.
On Saturday afternoon in Moraga, Calif.,
the Stanford women's lacrosse team beat Cal
12-9 to secure the MPSF championship and
avenge last year's one-goal defeat. Of course,
since the team includes Elizabeth "1" Hope
"My Father Will Eventually Acknowledge
My Superhuman Quadricep Strength" Piselli

and Michelle "I Also Live In
Durand" DeChant, I
showed up to support them
with three friends. We cov
ered ourselves in Cardinal
red poster paint, which I
would later find out has an
SPF of zero, and spelled out
the word L-A-X! on our
chests. (In retrospect, it
probably would have made

more sense to spell C-A-R-D, but there's
something about the feeling of cold, wet paint
on your nipples that damages your decision
making process.)
Now, typically, I would consider this sort of
behavior to be on par with putting your own
name on the back of a pro team jersey in the
Hierarchy of Unacceptable Sports Behavior.
However, occasionally you get the opportuni
ty to do something so ludicrously inappropri
ate that it absolutely has to be done. Like
George Mallory climbing Everest, I had to do
it because the poster paint and the Cal fans
were there. As long as you approach a situa
tion of this type with a modicum of humor (and
a lot of alcohol), it becomes justifiable to at
tend a sporting event where 80 percent of the
fans in attendance are rooting against you. It
also helps when two of the guys you attend the
game with are members of the Stanford foot
ball team's blocking department and possess a
combined height and weight of well over 13
feet and 6(X) pounds.
There were many highlights, but the crown
jewel was one Cal fan, a kid with the voice of a
50-year-old chain smoker whose screams got
progressively more intense and less coherent
as the game went on. He would also punctuate
every moment of heightened importance
(every Cal goal, any stoppage of play or any
perceived infraction by a Stanford player) by
standing and clapping with a level of coordina
tion and tenacity rivaling that of an epileptic
child being electrocuted. As far as his epithets,
there were a few winners, but his fallback was
"Hey, refs, how much did Stanford pay you?"
This refrain came up at least 20 times over the
course of the game — until, of course, he was
apparently touched by divine inspiration and
began adding "It's all right — Stanford can af
ford it!"
Now, this brings up something else I hate:
the notion that all Stanford kids are trust
fund prep products who wear ties to class and
