# Baseball falls at Santa Clara
## Stanford lets lead slip away in 10th, Broncos win 6-5 in 12 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
After two tough losses in last
weekend's series to California, No. 21
Stanford was itching to get back on
the winning track. But in order to do
that, it would have to take down the
Santa Clara Broncos, a team that had
given Stanford fits while splitting the
two games with the Cardinal coming
into last night's contest.
The Broncos battled once again,
coming back from deficits of three
runs and two runs before taking the
game, 6-5, in 12 innings.
The contest looked to be in Stan
ford's grasp after freshman rightfield
er Michael Taylor crushed a two-run
home run over the leftfield fence in
the top of the 10th. Taylor's third
blast of the season gave the Cardinal
a 5-3 lead, and with Stanford's ERA
leader and closer, junior Matt Man
ship. on the mound, things were look
ing good.
But Santa Clara didn't go down
quietly in the bottom of the 10th.
With Manship on the hill, Santa
Clara strung together two singles and
a walk to load the bases with one out.
Manship struck out second baseman
Eric Newton but he then walked first
baseman Nathan Faulkner to bring
in a run.
The next batter, centerfielder
Ryan Chiarelli, hit a sharp ground
ball to junior shortstop Chris Mi
naker, who tried to make the play at
second, but the runner slid in just
ahead of the tag, allowing the tying
run to score. Catcher Kris Watts also
tried to come around from second but
was tagged out after being caught in a
rundown to end the inning.
The Cardinal went down quickly
in the next two frames, picking up just
one baserunner combined in the 11th
and 12th innings.
Santa Clara ended it with one run
in the bottom of the 12th off of sopho
more reliever Jeff Stimpson. With
one out, pinch hitter David Hoffmire
singled into leftfield. A wild pitch al
lowed Hoffmire to advance to second
and two batters latter he was driven
in on an RBI single by Newton.
Taylor made a terrific play on the
ball in right field to make the play
close at home, but Hoffmire was able
to slide in just ahead of the tag.
The loss was the Cardinal's third
in a row and also marked the first
time that Stanford has lost a season
series to Santa Clara since 1980, when
the Broncos took three of four from
the Cardinal.
The game was Stanford's second
extra-inning loss of the week. The
Cardinal dropped a heartbreaker to
Cal, 2-1, in 11 innings on Saturday.

Stanford falls to 0-3 in extra-inning
games this season.
Tuesday night's game brought
back memories of last season's 12-8,
14-inning marathon victory for the
Cardinal at Buck Shaw Stadium,
which featured a delay when the
sprinklers went off in the middle of an
inning late in the contest. This time,
at Santa Clara's brand new Stephen
Schott Stadium, the sprinklers stayed
off and Stanford came up short.
The Cardinal got on the board first
last night, picking up three runs in the
top of the second inning. After a dou
ble by Taylor, a routine fly ball off the
bat of junior Chris Minaker to shallow
right field was dropped by Newton, al
lowing Taylor to come around and
score. Three batters later, freshman
catcher Jeff Boes dropped a bloop
single into right field to drive in a run.
Boes made his first career start be
hind the plate, giving the regular
starter junior John Hester a much-de
served break. Hester had played
every inning of every game coming
into the contest.
Santa Clara answered two innings
later, picking up one run in the bot
tom of the third before tying the
game in the fourth on a two-run home
run by Watts.
The home run came off of fresh
man right-hander Erik Davis, who
entered the game in relief of sopho
more starter Greg Reynolds.
Reynolds made his first start since the
Sunday game against Cal State-
Fullerton on Feb. 6. Reynolds went
three innings, allowing one run on
two hits.
Santa Clara played most of the
game without head coach Mark
O'Brien, who was ejected in the bot
tom of the sixth inning for arguing a
call at first base. The play in question
occurred when Chiarelli hit a harm
less grounder toward junior second
baseman Jed Lowrie. While Lowrie
took the ball to first himself, Chiarelli
was standing in the batter's box main
taining the ball hit off his foot. He was
called out to end the inning, and when
O'Brien came out to argue the call, he
was ejected from the game.
The game was the final of a six
game road trip on which the Cardinal
went 3-3. They face off against
UCLA at home this weekend in a
critical Pac-10 series to start a seven
game homestand.
Notes:
Junior pitcher Jeff Gilmore (8-1) was
named the Pac-10 pitcher of the week
for his performances against Cal and
UC-Davis. He threw 10 innings with
out giving up a run and picked up two
wins. He is the 69th Stanford pitcher to
win the award.

Fullerton on Feb. 6. Reynolds went
three innings, allowing one run on
two hits.
Santa Clara played most of the
game without head coach Mark
O'Brien, who was ejected in the bot
tom of the sixth inning for arguing a
call at first base. The play in question
occurred when Chiarelli hit a harm
less grounder toward junior second
baseman Jed Lowrie. While Lowrie
took the ball to first himself, Chiarelli
was standing in the batter's box main
taining the ball hit off his foot. He was
called out to end the inning, and when
O'Brien came out to argue the call, he
was ejected from the game.
The game was the final of a six
game road trip on which the Cardinal
went 3-3. They face off against
UCLA at home this weekend in a
critical Pac-10 series to start a seven
game homestand.
Notes:
Junior pitcher Jeff Gilmore (8-1) was
named the Pac-10 pitcher of the week
for his performances against Cal and
UC-Davis. He threw 10 innings with
out giving up a run and picked up two
wins. He is the 69th Stanford pitcher to
win the award.
