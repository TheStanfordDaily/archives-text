# Kayak Club gearing for Nationals

### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
When the Stanford women's rugby team won the Na
tional Championship against Penn State on April 30, club
sports on the Farm suddenly seized the spotlight.
However, Varsity and club sports are not the only teams
on campus that have won national titles. The Stanford
Canoe and Kayak Club, which has only been an official stu
dent group since 2001, is already a three-time collegiate
National Champion in flatwater sprint kayaking. And they
will try for another title this weekend.
But what on earth is flatwater sprint kayaking, any
way?
Flatwater sprint races are "best described as track
meets on water," said senior Cara Bertron, this year's co

captain.
The sprints come in three lengths: 200 meters, 500 me
ters and 1,000 meters. The boats used in these races are
long, thin and fast — not your average kayak — but the
trick is balance.
"My first race, I was scared out of my wits because I
was still having a lot of trouble balancing," said sopho
more Beth Wilkins. "I was just shaking from head to toe,
which probably didn't thrill my teammates. Once we got
started, though, I had to paddle hard, so I didn't have time
to think about being afraid. After a while I actually start
ed singing in time to the paddles and just reveling in the
water and the sunshine. It was fabulous."
