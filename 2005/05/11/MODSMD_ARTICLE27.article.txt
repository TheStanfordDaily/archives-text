# Kayak Club gearing for Nationals
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
When the Stanford women's rugby team won the Na
tional Championship against Penn State on April 30, club
sports on the Farm suddenly seized the spotlight.
However, Varsity and club sports are not the only teams
on campus that have won national titles. The Stanford
Canoe and Kayak Club, which has only been an official stu
dent group since 2001, is already a three-time collegiate
National Champion in flatwater sprint kayaking. And they
will try for another title this weekend.
But what on earth is flatwater sprint kayaking, any
way?
Flatwater sprint races are "best described as track
meets on water," said senior Cara Bertron, this year's co

captain.
The sprints come in three lengths: 200 meters, 500 me
ters and 1,000 meters. The boats used in these races are
long, thin and fast — not your average kayak — but the
trick is balance.
"My first race, I was scared out of my wits because I
was still having a lot of trouble balancing," said sopho
more Beth Wilkins. "I was just shaking from head to toe,
which probably didn't thrill my teammates. Once we got
started, though, I had to paddle hard, so I didn't have time
to think about being afraid. After a while I actually start
ed singing in time to the paddles and just reveling in the
water and the sunshine. It was fabulous."
Under the tutelage of coaches Gina Sanchez and Peter

Romankevich, the latter of whom
once coached the Russian National
Team and has trained many athletes to
win international titles, members of
the kayak club quickly learn balance
and technique, even if they have never
kayaked before.
"I kayaked recreationally approxi
mately once a year before Stanford,
but I never raced before, and I don't
think I even knew flatwater racing ex
isted," freshman Becca Zarin-Pass
said. "Coming to Stanford, I never ex
pected to be on a legitimate athletic
team, let alone participate in a nation
al competition."
The team is currently training for
Nationals, held this weekend in Geor
gia, and their practice schedule is an ex
tensive one. Practices are held from 3 to
6 p.m. every weekday and from 9 a.m.
to noon on Saturdays. However, team
members simply attend as many prac
tices as they are able to.
"We have paddlers who come to
almost every practice and people who
come once a week," Bertron said. "It
all depends on the time and energy an
individual wants to put into kayak
ing."
For the Stanford team, putting
time into kayaking often means
spending time in rather unpleasant
water. When asked about their least
favorite part of the kayak club, an
overwhelming majority of paddlers
named the polluted water and the
bloodshot eyes caused by the chemi
cals it contains.
"The Bay is just disgusting, and
you have to try not to think about
what's in there if you fall in," Wilkins
said. "If you get any water on you, it
smells so gross."
However, less-than-ideal practice
conditions have not deterred this
group of student-athletes from being
dedicated to their team.
"It's a great community to be a
part of, and it's nice to be part of a
sports team again," said freshman
Audrey Brown. "It's given me an op
portunity to meet a group of people

that I probably would have never run
into, had I not joined the team. It's
been fun getting to meet a group of
new people and especially fun learn
ing a completely new sport."
Other paddlers agreed that the
people on the team were a big part of
why they endure cold, polluted water.
"Your friends and teammates al
ways support you in any condition or
outcome," said senior Benjamin
Chang. "It's a great team bonding ex
perience. I started with the team since
its early conception in the 2001-2002
school year. I saw it grow from a cou
ple of boats owned by our coach to a
large fleet that we purchased through
fundraising. A dedicated coach can
inspire a whole group of students."
Being a part of the kayak club has
taught these paddlers many such life
lessons.
"Kayaking has been an area of per
sonal discovery for me," Wilkins said.
"1 hadn't done any sports since ele
mentary school before I joined, and
it's been fun to realize that yes, if 1
work hard enough, I, too, can be ath
letic."
Sophomore Leigh Davenport has
learned a lot from her experience with
the K4, a four-person kayak.
"It is very important that everyone
paddles in sync," Davenport said. "If
you do not coordinate strokes, it is
very difficult to pull the boat and
maintain balance. Learning to work
with three other people to attain that
stability has reinforced for me the ne
cessity of good communication and
cooperation, whether in paddling or
any other group task."
The lessons they have learned and
skills they have acquired over the
course of this year will be put to the
test this weekend.
The competition will be tough.
Paddlers who have not been to Na
tionals before are placed in a novice
division. But all other paddlers, no
matter how experienced, are lumped
into one big competition.
Still, the Stanford team feels ready
for the challenge.
"We've won Nationals the past
three years, and we have a really
great, dedicated team," Brown said.
"I think we have a good shot at win
ning again."
