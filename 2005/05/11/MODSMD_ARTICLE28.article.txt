### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It is a testimony to his endurance
and versatility that senior decathlete
Nick Taylor finished fifth at the Pa
cific-10 Multi-Events Championship
this past weekend. But it was also
Taylor's commitment to improve
ment this season that earned him a
career-best 6,832 points at UCLA,
where the Championship was held.
"I was feeling pretty confident,"
Taylor said. "There is always a de
gree of nervousness, hut I knew the
competition because I had gone
against those same guys so many
times before. And I have been
doing better lately in practice, so I
knew I would surprise them with
some better marks."
Taylor, whose previous person
al-best was 6,501 points, has seen a
dramatic step up in his decathlon
performance this season.
"Nick was ranked at the bottom
before the championship and fin
ished an impressive fifth place,"
men's head coach Robert Weir said.
Of the two days of decathlon
competition, Sunday was an espe
cially impressive day for Taylor,
who finished third in the 110-meter
hurdles and fourth in the 1500-
meter run, javelin and pole vault.
Taylor attributes his improve
ment to his coach and the work he
has done on specific events in order
to tighten up his overall effort.
"I improved a lot in pole vault be
cause of coach [Kris] Mack," Taylor
said. "He knows the event really
well. He and I work together to de
cide which events I need to work on
and which are okay. That's why I im
proved. It is really an individual ef
fort with the coaches' help."
