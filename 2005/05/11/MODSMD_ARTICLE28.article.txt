# Taylor finishes fifth in Pac-10 decathlon
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It is a testimony to his endurance
and versatility that senior decathlete
Nick Taylor finished fifth at the Pa
cific-10 Multi-Events Championship
this past weekend. But it was also
Taylor's commitment to improve
ment this season that earned him a
career-best 6,832 points at UCLA,
where the Championship was held.
"I was feeling pretty confident,"
Taylor said. "There is always a de
gree of nervousness, hut I knew the
competition because I had gone
against those same guys so many
times before. And I have been
doing better lately in practice, so I
knew I would surprise them with
some better marks."
Taylor, whose previous person
al-best was 6,501 points, has seen a
dramatic step up in his decathlon
performance this season.
"Nick was ranked at the bottom
before the championship and fin
ished an impressive fifth place,"
men's head coach Robert Weir said.
Of the two days of decathlon
competition, Sunday was an espe
cially impressive day for Taylor,
who finished third in the 110-meter
hurdles and fourth in the 1500-
meter run, javelin and pole vault.
Taylor attributes his improve
ment to his coach and the work he
has done on specific events in order
to tighten up his overall effort.
"I improved a lot in pole vault be
cause of coach [Kris] Mack," Taylor
said. "He knows the event really
well. He and I work together to de
cide which events I need to work on
and which are okay. That's why I im
proved. It is really an individual ef
fort with the coaches' help."

Sophomore Feranmi Okanlami jumped a career-best 50'3".25 to win the
triple jump at the Sacramento State Open and earn a spot at NCAA Re
gional.
Taylor s efforts paid off in the
very last event Sunday when he fin
ished fourth in the pole vault with a
mark of 14 3.25
Taylor has gotten used to being
the only decathlete on the team,
though it has been the hardest part
of his track and field career.
"Training on my own has been
the hardest thing for me. It would
have been great to have someone
else there to train with, but you deal
with it."
In addition to Mack, who is the
multi-event and pole vault coach,
Taylor has worked with throwing
coach Weir and jump coach Edrick
Floreal throughout his time at Stan
ford.
"If I am training for the long
jump, sometimes I get feedback from
Edrick," Taylor said. "Or when I
work on throws I work with Robert."
Taylor, who came to the Farm
four years ago from Sandy, Utah,
has found his motivation to compete
and train every day in his desire to
continuously improve and challenge
himself.
"I started doing the decathlon
when I got to college," Taylor said.
" It was not always easy to get practice
every day. But getting back to Pac
10's this season and scoring more
points is really what motivated me."
Taylor finished ninth last year at
the Pac-10 Multi-Event Champi
onships, just barely missing the top
eight scoring positions. This year, his
fifth-place finish earned valuable
points for the Cardinal. He will com
pete alongside the rest of his team at
the regular Pac-10 Championships
this weekend.
While Taylor competed at
UCLA, a group of Cardinal com
petitors traveled to Sacramento
State Open for their second to last
chance to qualify for Regionals. The
meet also helped to confirm which
athletes will be traveling to UCLA
on the Pac-10 Championship team.
The men's and women's team will
each be made up of 24 athletes.
Two regional qualifying perfor
mances stood out as the Cardinal's
highlights at the meet. Freshman
Anna McFarlane won the pole vault
while sophomore Feranmi Okanla
mi won the triple jump.
McFarlane's vault of 12-7.25"
ranked fifth in school history and
was a season-best for her. The per
formance was impressive, consider
ing Mack was at UCLA with Taylor.
"I was kind of nervous at first,"
McFarlane said. "It was the first time
I have vaulted without my coach.
But Graeme |Hoste) and Ben [Dick
ens] made good substitute coaches.
You just need people to watch your
form and your take-off and they
were really good about that."
The nerves faded quickly for Mc-
Farlane, who managed to top all of
her competition and accomplish a
personal best for this season.
"I am always nervous when I start
vaulting," McFarlane said. "But I
just keep building confidence with

every attempt — the more you vault
the easier it gets."
McFarlane hopes to vault in the
low to mid-thirteens at Regionals
this year and to earn a personal-best,
something she has not done fora
while.
Okanlami jumped 50'3.25", the

eighth-best triple jump in school his
tory, and a career-best for him.
"Feranmi did extremely well,"
Weir said. "Going straight from the
long jump to the triple jump where
he had a personal best. His perfor
mances were just outstanding."
The Sac State Invitational did not

see many more standout perfor
mances for the Cardinal, who are
now gearing up for Pac-10 Champi
onships this weekend.
"We didn't get a whole lot accom
plished," head women's coach Flore
al said. "For the girls, Anna was real
ly the best performance there."

jump, sometimes I get feedback from
Edrick," Taylor said. "Or when I
work on throws I work with Robert."
Taylor, who came to the Farm
four years ago from Sandy, Utah,
has found his motivation to compete
and train every day in his desire to
continuously improve and challenge
himself.
"I started doing the decathlon
when I got to college," Taylor said.
" It was not always easy to get practice
every day. But getting back to Pac
10's this season and scoring more
points is really what motivated me."
Taylor finished ninth last year at
the Pac-10 Multi-Event Champi
onships, just barely missing the top
eight scoring positions. This year, his
fifth-place finish earned valuable
points for the Cardinal. He will com
pete alongside the rest of his team at
the regular Pac-10 Championships
this weekend.
While Taylor competed at
UCLA, a group of Cardinal com
petitors traveled to Sacramento
State Open for their second to last
chance to qualify for Regionals. The
meet also helped to confirm which
athletes will be traveling to UCLA
on the Pac-10 Championship team.
The men's and women's team will
each be made up of 24 athletes.
Two regional qualifying perfor
mances stood out as the Cardinal's
highlights at the meet. Freshman
Anna McFarlane won the pole vault
while sophomore Feranmi Okanla
mi won the triple jump.
McFarlane's vault of 12-7.25"
ranked fifth in school history and
was a season-best for her. The per
formance was impressive, consider
ing Mack was at UCLA with Taylor.
"I was kind of nervous at first,"
McFarlane said. "It was the first time
I have vaulted without my coach.
But Graeme |Hoste) and Ben [Dick
ens] made good substitute coaches.
You just need people to watch your
form and your take-off and they
were really good about that."
The nerves faded quickly for Mc-
Farlane, who managed to top all of
her competition and accomplish a
personal best for this season.
"I am always nervous when I start
vaulting," McFarlane said. "But I
just keep building confidence with

every attempt — the more you vault
the easier it gets."
McFarlane hopes to vault in the
low to mid-thirteens at Regionals
this year and to earn a personal-best,
something she has not done fora
while.
Okanlami jumped 50'3.25", the

eighth-best triple jump in school his
tory, and a career-best for him.
"Feranmi did extremely well,"
Weir said. "Going straight from the
long jump to the triple jump where
he had a personal best. His perfor
mances were just outstanding."
The Sac State Invitational did not

see many more standout perfor
mances for the Cardinal, who are
now gearing up for Pac-10 Champi
onships this weekend.
"We didn't get a whole lot accom
plished," head women's coach Flore
al said. "For the girls, Anna was real
ly the best performance there."
