# Banks offer sessions on loan consolidation
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Spring quarter is an important time for seniors
with outstanding federal loans. Pending increases
in interest rates and the probability of changes in
government regulations make it especially ap
pealing for loan-borrowers to consolidate their
loans because they can save money on low interest
rates.
"There are many factors to be considered when

deciding whether to apply fora federal consolida
tion loan," said Karen Cooper, associate dean and
director of financial aid. "That is why we've decid
ed to arrange day-long sessions with the lenders
used most often by our students for the Stafford
loan program." The Stafford loan does not re
quire students to pay back the loan while they are
still in school.
The Financial Aid Office's decision to bring
these lenders to campus was prompted by the ex
pectation that Stafford loan interest rates will in

crease in the near future. Cooper said.
After July 1, interest rates for the Stafford loan
program could rise as much as 2 percent, so there
is a sense of urgency among graduating seniors to
consolidate their loans and "lock in"the current
low rates.
"Currently the Stafford loan interest rate is 2.77
percent during in-school, grace and deferment pe
riods and 3.37 percent during repayment," said
Cynthia Hartley, director of graduate
student aid programs. "The interest
rate for Stafford loans is variable and
may change annually, whereas the in
terest rate on the consolidation loan
is the weighted average on the loans
being included in the consolidation
but will be fixed, rather than vari
able."
For this reason. Cooper said that
the Federal Consolidation Loan
Program may be beneficial for many
students.
"The Federal Consolidation
Loan Program allows borrowers to
refinance their federal student
loans in an effort to simplify re
payment," Cooper said. "With a
consolidation loan, the original
loans are paid off and the borrow
er has a new loan with one lender,
with a fixed interest rate, a new re
payment schedule and terms. The
repayment can be made over a
long period of time, resulting in
lower monthly payments."
For some borrowers, however.

Cooper warned that this could result
in paying significantly more interest
over the life of the loan.
"Historically, consolidation loans
were recommended only for bor
rowers with multiple loans from
multiple organizations, causing un
manageable monthly payments,"
Cooper said. "However, current his
torically low interest rates make the
Federal Consolidation Loan Pro
gram an attractive option fora
broader range of borrowers."
Some of the lenders coming to
campus to discuss students' finan
cial options include Washington
Mutual, Bank of America and
Citibank. These lenders will be
available on campus between May
16 and May 31.
"We've asked the lenders to give
brief presentations at the beginning
of each hour and then leave time to
answer individual questions," Hart
ley said. "Since each lender will be
here from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on their
particular day, we assumed the How
would not be too heavy at any par
ticular time. No scheduling is re
quired for individual students."
Several students said they will be
happy to have this opportunity It)
speak with lenders about their per

sonal situations.
"I'm incredibly nervous about
paying off my loans," said senior
Marisa Juarez. "I openly admit that
my parents have handled most ot
my financial needs during my four
years here, and 1 know I'm not the
only one. I just sign where they tell
me, but now that I'm graduating,
I'm curious as to what, exactly, my
debt is going to be."
Juarez said she is interested to see
what the lenders have to say.
"Since my parents have handled
all of my loans for me, 1 would be
afraid to meet with them without my
parents present to be able to apply
my personal situation," she said.
"But, it wouldn't hurt to just go hear
what they have to say then come
back and discuss it with my parents
without committing to anything."
However, Cooper said graduat
ing seniors do not have much time to
decide.
"Students who are graduating in
June will enter their grace period on
June 9," she said. "To take advan
tage of the low fixed rate, they would
need to apply before July 1. So, there
is only a brief window of time in
which these students can file their
consolidation loan applications."
