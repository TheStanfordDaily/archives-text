# Banks offer sessions on loan consolidation
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Spring quarter is an important time for seniors
with outstanding federal loans. Pending increases
in interest rates and the probability of changes in
government regulations make it especially ap
pealing for loan-borrowers to consolidate their
loans because they can save money on low interest
rates.
"There are many factors to be considered when

deciding whether to apply fora federal consolida
tion loan," said Karen Cooper, associate dean and
director of financial aid. "That is why we've decid
ed to arrange day-long sessions with the lenders
used most often by our students for the Stafford
loan program." The Stafford loan does not re
quire students to pay back the loan while they are
still in school.
The Financial Aid Office's decision to bring
these lenders to campus was prompted by the ex
pectation that Stafford loan interest rates will in

crease in the near future. Cooper said.
After July 1, interest rates for the Stafford loan
program could rise as much as 2 percent, so there
is a sense of urgency among graduating seniors to
consolidate their loans and "lock in"the current
low rates.
"Currently the Stafford loan interest rate is 2.77
percent during in-school, grace and deferment pe
riods and 3.37 percent during repayment," said
