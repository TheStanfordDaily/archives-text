# Some residents upset by short notice
## Stanford, Palo Alto reach land-use deal 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In what has been touted by com
munity members as a landmark in
relations between Stanford and its
neighbors, the Palo Alto City
Council last week voted five to one
to approve a land-use deal negotiat
ed between the University and the
city.
Under the agreement, Stanford
will build playing fields for the city
on the corner of Page Mill Road
and El Camino Real; tear down
330,000 square feet of old office
space and construct at least 250
units of housing on California Av
enue; and develop 300,000 square
feet of office space in the southern
portion of Stanford Research Park.
The deal represents a new model
for collaboration between the Uni
versity and Palo Alto, said Larry
Horton. Stanford's director of gov
ernment and community relations.
"It's a cooperative agreement

that provides significant benefits
both for the city and for Stanford,"
he said. "It's an approach that we
think is very promising for the fu
ture."
Horton said Palo Alto ap
proached Stanford in 2000 about
using the undeveloped land on the
corner of Page Mill and El Camino.
Rather than butting heads as they
often have in the past on land use is
sues, the University and the city
worked together for years to reach
an optimal agreement.
The development in the Stan
ford Research Park, prime Silicon
Valley property, figures to be lucra
tive for the University. The playing
fields, coveted by land-starved Palo
Alto, were a concession Stanford
was happy to make. The University
will lease the land to the city at $1 a
year for 50 years.
As for the housing, at least 50
units will be designated as "afford
able housing," meaning that they
will be priced below market rates and op
erated according to city guidelines. The
remainder of the units will be built at
Stanford's discretion, meaning they could
be limited to people with University affil
iation.
Most on the Palo Alto City Council
agreed with Horton's assessment that the
plan will benefit both the city and the
University. But that doesn't mean every
body is happy with it.
Yoriko Kishimito, the councilmember
who voted against the deal, said that the
plan is good overall but has flaws that
could have been fixed had the council and
affected community members been con
sulted earlier.
Not being included in the negotiations
between Stanford and the city manager

"did create a frustrating situation for me
and members of the public," Koshimito
said.
Horton said both Stanford and the city
worked hard to keep nearby residents
abreast of developments, but because of
an oversight on the city's part, many peo
ple affected by the deal were not in
formed until near the end of the process.
Residents of the Peter Coutts neigh
borhood were not notified because they
live on unincorporated Santa Clara
County land, and so are not officially Palo
Alto residents. They worry that the new
housing will obstruct their views of the
Bay, puncturing property values.
"1 woke up one morning in the begin
ning of April and saw a big balloon out my
window," said Sociology Prof. John
Meyer, who has an Bay-view apartment
in the Peter Coutts neighborhood. "1
thought somebody was having a birthday.
But no, it was an estimate of a 50-foot
building they're going to put out here.
Wow."

Meyer said although lie thinks the gen
eral idea of the arrangement is reason
able, he just objects to the way it was han
dled, especially the fact that he and his
neighbors didn't learn about it until a
month before its final approval.
"Stanford needs housing nearby, and
this is a great location," he said, gesturing
out his backyard to the Agilent Technolo
gies building that will be torn down to
make way for the new units. "But this was
a complete planning failure."
On the other end of Stanford Research
Park, Koshimito fears that the new office
development â€” which will bring in
creased traffic and require new stoplights
will alter the rural character of the
Hillview area. Residents of neighboring
Los Altos Hills also were not notified
until late in the process.
Going forward, Horton said the Uni
versity "will definitely have a systematic
outreach program to work with resi
dents" to address their concerns in the
project's implementation.
