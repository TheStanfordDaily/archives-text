# Schiavo case prompts discussion
## Life and death ethics debated 
### ANNE RITCHIE 
"Americans overall are very conflicted about
death," said Jose Maldonado, assistant professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford's
School of Medicine and the Stanford Center for Bio
medical Ethics. He was one of three panelists at last
night's discussion entitled, "Health Care and Life Ex
tension: Ethics and Policy."
The event, organized by Stanford in Government,
hosted Maldonado as well as Jon B. Eisenberg, a civil
appeals attorney with the American Civil Liberties
Union, and Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann, senior
associate dean for religious life at Stanford.
Much of the night's focus was spent on the Terri
Schiavo case, as Eisenberg was part of a team of
lawyers representing Michael Schiavo, Terri's hus
band, in court.
Stanford in Government member Eric Friedman,
a junior, said the event's topic was chosen because of
the Schiavo case but also to "demonstrate the more
general implications of the issue," if the ethics behind
life and death. The panelists' represented a variety of
perspectives on the issue, he said.
Eisenberg provided the legal framework for life
extension decisions by giving an overview of the cur
rent law. In California, Eisenberg said, residents are
constitutionally guaranteed autonomy in health care
and the right to privacy. When applied to end of life
issues, these rights allow residents to refuse health
care or treatment at any time. Although the law is
clear in this regard, it gets more complicated, accord
ing to Eisenberg. when the patient's mental compe-
tence is in question.
In a legally perfect world, every
one would have an Advanced
Health Care Directive, a legal docu
ment that explicitly states an individ
ual's health care preferences, should
they be declared incompetent. But
Eisenberg said only 10 percent of
Americans have such a document.
Then, directions to family members
take precedence over health care
decisions, as they did in the Schiavo
case.
Karlin-Neumann provided a reli
gious take on the ethics of life exten
sion. In the past, "religious tradi
tions were inherently conservative
about life," she said, but more re
cently, liberal interpretations of the
Talmud, a collection of Jewish rab
binical writings, and other texts have
lent support to those who choose to
end their loved ones' lives bv remov

ing feeding tubes.
Though a doctor himself, Maldon
ado freely admitted that the medical
profession often falls short when it
comes to patient preferences. Doc
tors tend to aggressively push treat
ment at patients, even when it is
against the patient's wishes.
The three panelists agreed that
the ethics of life extension and
health care are complex, especially
when family members of uncon
scious loved ones attempt to recon
cile legal, religious and bioethical
perspectives. According to Maldon
ado, the issue is compounded by
human irrationality.
"I've never seen a reasonable
person," he said.
The panelists' discussion was ex
tended to a question-and-answer
session with the 20 or so audience
members. In response to one ques
tion about what people should do,
Eisenberg urged the audience to
create their own Advanced Health
Care Directives in order to avoid
possible confusion in the event of an
emergency.
