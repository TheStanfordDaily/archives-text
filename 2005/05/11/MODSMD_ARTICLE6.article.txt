by Cherrie Moraga, will be presented
by the Stanford Drama Department
starting today at 8 p.m. and ending on
May 22 at the Pigott Theater behind
Memorial Auditorium.
The play is part of the "Rite to Re
member: Performance and Xicana/In

digena Thought," or R2R Project, a
year-long programming umbrella fo
cusing on indigenous thought and non-
European approaches to performance.

opens with Medea being imprisoned
for the murder of her son, and
through a series of flashbacks, the
play reveals the story leading up to
his murder. "The Hungry Woman"
also incorporates mythology and in
timate realism to describe the embat
tled position of Chicanos/ as within
the United States and the Chicano
community
"With the combination of direc
tors, actors and collaborating artists at
work on this new production, for the
first time in my life I am able to realize
the vision of my play without compro
mise to any aspect of its purpose cul
turally, aesthetically or politically,"
said Moraga, who is an artist-in-resi
dence in the Drama Department.
Most of the actors are Stanford
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents. Adelina Anthony, a drama
graduate student, co-directed the
production, and Chris Gonzalez
Clarke, assistant director of El Cen
tro Chicano, helped develop original
music to be performed live onstage.
"The play's conceptual artist
Celia Herrera-Rodriguez as well as

choreographer Alleluia Fanis are
both an integral part to the project
because of the way their work brings
indigenous aesthetics onto the stage
as well as into the costumes and the
dance," said Michelle Zamora, a
graduate student in Modern
Thought and Literature and execu
tive producer of the R2R Project. "1
think their collaborative work makes
this Stanford production really im
portant in the history of Chicana
teatro [theater J."
Moraga noted, "[ The work of all
the collaborators] reflects a lifetime
commitment to an integration of an
indigenous sensibility into their art
practice."
Zamora said that those involved
with the production are doing a great
deal of outreach in the Bay Area's
communities of color as well as in the
Chicano and queer communities.
"We already have folks from
southern California and all over the
southwest who are coming in to town
to see the play," she said.
"The Hungry Woman" has been a
10-year project for Moraga that was
first a staged reading at Berkeley
Repertory Theatre in 1995. It has
also been read at the Mark Taper
Forum, Brava Theater Center, The
Esperan/a Center in San Antonio,
The Magic Theater and Celebration

Theater.
Moraga — a prolific Chicana les
bian poet, playwright and essayist —
is a past recipient of the National En
dowment for the Arts' Theatre Play
wrights' Fellowship. Her other works
include the plays "Watsonville:
Some Place Not Here," which twice
received the Fund for New American
Plays Award, and "Heroes and
Saints," which earned the Pen West
Award for Drama.
"As Artist-in-Residence in the
Department of Drama since 1997,
Moraga has worked hard at mentor
ing young students of color into
drama and writing, as well as working
with grad student advisees," Zamora
said. "I think this has blossomed right
now to bring an amazing community
of artists on campus so that this Chi
cana-Chicano production is possi
ble."
Anthony, who describes herself as
a Chicana lesbian teatrista and multi
disciplinary artista, has received nu
merous awards and recognition of
her work as an actor, writer and di
rector, including the Critics' Choice
for Best Director in 2(XJ 1.
"The Hungry Woman" is running

post-show conversation with Moraga
