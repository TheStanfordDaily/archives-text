# Focus on industrial design
## VW partners with Stanford 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recent partnership between Stanford and
Volkswagen Automotive University, an institu
tion of post-graduate education run by the corpo
ration, could yield both advanced driving technol
ogy and greater opportunities for doctoral stu
dents to gain research experience with industry
professionals.
The collaboration — outlined in an agreement
signed on May 4 by Larry Leifer, director of the
Stanford Center of Design Research; Peter Hartz,
a member of the Board of Management of Volk
swagen; and Walther Zimmerli, president of
Volkswagen Automotive University — is focused
on the area of industrial design.
The contract stipulates that an Automotive
University employee spend a year working and re
searching industrial design at Stanford. Addition
ally, two Stanford professors will give lectures and
courses at the Automotive University. Volkswa
gen's electronic research lab in Palo Alto will also
participate in the project.
"The Stanford Design community brings fresh
ways of thinking, an emphasis on innovation and
design-thinking," said Leifer, a mechanical engi
neering professor at Stanford.
"I think the partnership between Stanford and
Volkswagen Auto-Uni is a fair trade-off," said
Auto-Uni Prof. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht. "Auto-
Uni hopes to profit from Stanford's academic ex
pertise and prestige as an institution — it wants to
learn. Stanford, I assume, hopes to develop inter
esting collaboration in high-tech with Volkswa
gen, through the university."
Gumbrecht himself is a link between Stanford
and Volkswagen as he is a professor in Stanford's
Comparative Literature Department as well as a
member of the scientific board and the academic
advisory board at Volkswagen Auto-Uni.
Cooperation between academics and auto-de
sign moguls is nothing new for Stanford Universi
ty. For instance, the Mechanical Engineering De
partment's Engine Lab and contemporary nan
otechnology research projects are closely related
