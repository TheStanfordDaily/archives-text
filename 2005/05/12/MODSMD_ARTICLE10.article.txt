## 
### ZUBIN AGARWAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On September 1, 2005, Psy
chology Prof. Claude M. Steele
will become the seventh director
of the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences — an
independent research organiza
tion — on Sept. 1. ITie center was
formed by the Ford Foundation to
expand knowledge on the princi
ples that govern human behavior.
The Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
is a non-profit group dedicated to
research in behavioral sciences.
The center seeks to create an en
vironment that fosters intellectual
freedom and interdisciplinary
stimulation by providing fellows
with unencumbered time.
"The center is among the most
important of the independent re
search centers in science and hu
manities in the world," said Dou
glas McAdam, outgoing director
of the center. "Top scholars have
produced very important work
that has very significantly influ
enced thinking."
McAdam said he was pleased
with Steele's appointment, adding
that Steele was"a skilled adminis
trator" with "exactly the right
kind of vision and values to ensure
the ongoing success of the cen

ter".
A fellowship to study at the
center is extremely competitive.
Scholars must be nominated to
receive the honor. There are cur
rently 3,000 nominees and fewer
than 1 percent will be awarded a
fellowship. Only the top scholars
and most promising rising stars
in behavioral sciences are con
sidered.
The center is independent of
Stanford and uses its endowment
to support the research of fellows,
though it is located on land leased
from Stanford. The scholars,
drawn from various universities
and other organizations, come to
the center fora year to study. Typ
ically, the center provides half of
the scholars' yearly salaries and
their home institution provides
the balance.
McAdam noted that Steele
will have to deal with restricted
support from outside founda
tions.
"Very significant changes in
the external funding environment
pose a real challenge to the cen
ter," he said, adding that Steele
will have to transition the center
to becoming more self-sufficient.
Steele is also the Lucie Stern
professor in social sciences and has
been at Stanford since 1991. He
could not be reached for comment.
