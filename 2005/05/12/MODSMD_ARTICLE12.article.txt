# An Ounce of Prevention
## Site for the lonely 
### 
This week I thought I'd write
about love and relationships. I feel
a little awkward approaching this
subject because it is not my field of
expertise and I don't consider my
self an especially social person.
Also, I don't date very often ...
well, ever.
But then again, we are at Stan
ford, so maybe that last one applies
to you. In any case, relationships
have a lot more to do with health
than we often think. And wherever
an important health issue lurks,
your trusted health columnist is
bound by duty to follow.
While discussions regarding ro
mance and love rarely consider
health issues beyond matters of sex
ual health, meaningful relation
ships are essential to our physical
well-being in many ways. Several
British studies have found that feel-

ings of love in
crease levels
of serotonin
and dopamine
in the body,
giving us feel
ings of elation.
Studies have
also shown
that unrequit
ed love can
lead to heart
problems and

symptoms of obsessive compulsive
disorder. These potential health ef
fects make the old adage that
"there's no dating at Stanford"
seem more ominous.
Greek organizations and dorms
have responded to this concern by
throwing formal events that en
courage students to find dates.
Vaden offers specialized counsel
ing and psychological services to
students who feel lonely or have re
lationship troubles.
Recently, however, it has come
to my attention that there is a per
son more fit than either fraternities
or University administration to
combat the romantic concerns that
plague so many Stanford students.
This person is presently spreading
the gospel of dating, relationships
and social skills across the Stanford
kingdom. And she's doing it with a
blog.
Junior Marie Cannizzaro, who
goes by the Web moniker Marie
Christine, is the creator of "Stanford
Single" (http://www.xanga.com
/stanfordsingle), a Web site that as
pires to "make Stanford more social,
one student at a time."
Visitors to the blog are greeted
by a title bar with the ambitious
proclamation "Go from awkward
to awesome just by reading this
blog!" and clip-art of pouting red
lips. From my very first visit to
"Stanford Single," I could tell the
Web site was going to change my
life.
Through general commentary
and didactic illustrations using typi
cal Stanford students "Naaron" and
"Boomqueesha," Marie Christine
teaches the basics of decent human
interaction to the socially awkward.
Her first five posts have covered
phone etiquette for men and
women, rules on who should make
the first move and thoughts on
"Why the Stanford dating scene
sucks — and what to do about it."
Clever mnemonics make the practi
cal suggestions easy to remember.
Impressed and intrigued by the
sage advice I found on her Web site,
I arranged for an interview with the
alluring Web mistress. And now,
for the benefit of the entire Stan
ford community, 1 present our casu
al, entirely unscripted conversation
here:
Priya Jayachandran: What quali
fies you to give the kind of advice
that you do?
Marie Cannizzaro: I think I'm pret
ty unique in that I have a significant
amount of experience with both se
rious relationships and playing the
field. I know what it feels like to be
rejected and how awesome it is
when you find someone you really
click with. Also, I'm really into in
terview and selection processes,
and I think there are a lot of paral
lels between that and dating — like
identifying the appropriate candi
dates and projecting a desirable
image.
PJ: Do you think it is true that there
is no dating at Stanford? And if so,
why?
MC: In my opinion, the dating
scene here is severely handicapped
fora variety of reasons. First of all,
we're at a competitive university
full of high achievers. We don't


Prfya Jayachandran
like failing, and thus it's extremely
difficult for most people to he com
fortable making themselves emo
tionally vulnerable to others. Sec
ond. the dorm-centric social culture
puts a lot of pressure on non-pla
tonic interactions. Like I said in one
of my posts, it's hard to date some
one casually when you know you're
going to see them every time you
exfoliate. All of these things create
a "hookup vs. marriage" phe
nomenon with little room for any
thing in between.
PJ: What effect do you think the
lack of dating and / or prevalence of
random hookups has on students?
MC: Students need to realize that
the more practice they have with
separating the emotional aspects
from the physical aspects of love and
sex, the more difficult it will be for
them to re-integrate these things
when they want to find a life part
ner. I predict that our generation
will see astronomical rates of infi
delity and divorce for just this rea
son. There's a verv real danger of

large numbers of students graduat
ing without much sense of how to in
teract appropriately with potential
or current romantic partners.
PJ: What should students do about
it?
MC: We need to realize that positive
interactions are not built on alcohol
and short-term physical gratifica
tion. Random hookups seem like a
nice outlet for all the tension you've
built up during the week, but they're
emotionally (and often physically)
unhealthy. If this is the sole compo
nent of your social life, you need to
realize that you are setting yourself
up for some big-time heartache
when you leave the Farm. Forego
the all-campus party scene once in a
while for more intimate venues
where you can have a real conversa
tion with someone. Assume that you
will have to endure rejection at
some point, but also assume that
you will meet a bunch of really awe
some people. And keep your eyes
on the prize: Finding someone with
whom you can share consistent,
truly mind-blowing physical and
emotional intimacy.

Studies have
also shown
that unrequit
ed love can
lead to heart
problems and

symptoms of obsessive compulsive
disorder. These potential health ef
fects make the old adage that
"there's no dating at Stanford"
seem more ominous.
Greek organizations and dorms
have responded to this concern by
throwing formal events that en
courage students to find dates.
Vaden offers specialized counsel
ing and psychological services to
students who feel lonely or have re
lationship troubles.
Recently, however, it has come
to my attention that there is a per
son more fit than either fraternities
or University administration to
combat the romantic concerns that
plague so many Stanford students.
This person is presently spreading
the gospel of dating, relationships
and social skills across the Stanford
kingdom. And she's doing it with a
blog.
Junior Marie Cannizzaro, who
goes by the Web moniker Marie
Christine, is the creator of "Stanford
Single" (http://www.xanga.com
/stanfordsingle), a Web site that as
pires to "make Stanford more social,
one student at a time."
Visitors to the blog are greeted
by a title bar with the ambitious
proclamation "Go from awkward
to awesome just by reading this
blog!" and clip-art of pouting red
lips. From my very first visit to
"Stanford Single," I could tell the
Web site was going to change my
life.
Through general commentary
and didactic illustrations using typi
cal Stanford students "Naaron" and
"Boomqueesha," Marie Christine
teaches the basics of decent human
interaction to the socially awkward.
Her first five posts have covered
phone etiquette for men and
women, rules on who should make
the first move and thoughts on
"Why the Stanford dating scene
sucks — and what to do about it."
Clever mnemonics make the practi
cal suggestions easy to remember.
Impressed and intrigued by the
sage advice I found on her Web site,
I arranged for an interview with the
alluring Web mistress. And now,
for the benefit of the entire Stan
ford community, 1 present our casu
al, entirely unscripted conversation
here:
Priya Jayachandran: What quali
fies you to give the kind of advice
that you do?
Marie Cannizzaro: I think I'm pret
ty unique in that I have a significant
amount of experience with both se
rious relationships and playing the
field. I know what it feels like to be
rejected and how awesome it is
when you find someone you really
click with. Also, I'm really into in
terview and selection processes,
and I think there are a lot of paral
lels between that and dating — like
identifying the appropriate candi
dates and projecting a desirable
image.
PJ: Do you think it is true that there
is no dating at Stanford? And if so,
why?
MC: In my opinion, the dating
scene here is severely handicapped
fora variety of reasons. First of all,
we're at a competitive university
full of high achievers. We don't

like failing, and thus it's extremely
difficult for most people to he com
fortable making themselves emo
tionally vulnerable to others. Sec
ond. the dorm-centric social culture
puts a lot of pressure on non-pla
tonic interactions. Like I said in one
of my posts, it's hard to date some
one casually when you know you're
going to see them every time you
exfoliate. All of these things create
a "hookup vs. marriage" phe
nomenon with little room for any
thing in between.
PJ: What effect do you think the
lack of dating and / or prevalence of
random hookups has on students?
MC: Students need to realize that
the more practice they have with
separating the emotional aspects
from the physical aspects of love and
sex, the more difficult it will be for
them to re-integrate these things
when they want to find a life part
ner. I predict that our generation
will see astronomical rates of infi
delity and divorce for just this rea
son. There's a verv real danger of

large numbers of students graduat
ing without much sense of how to in
teract appropriately with potential
or current romantic partners.
PJ: What should students do about
it?
MC: We need to realize that positive
interactions are not built on alcohol
and short-term physical gratifica
tion. Random hookups seem like a
nice outlet for all the tension you've
built up during the week, but they're
emotionally (and often physically)
unhealthy. If this is the sole compo
nent of your social life, you need to
realize that you are setting yourself
up for some big-time heartache
when you leave the Farm. Forego
the all-campus party scene once in a
while for more intimate venues
where you can have a real conversa
tion with someone. Assume that you
will have to endure rejection at
some point, but also assume that
you will meet a bunch of really awe
some people. And keep your eyes
on the prize: Finding someone with
whom you can share consistent,
truly mind-blowing physical and
emotional intimacy.
