# An Ounce of Prevention
## Site for the lonely 
### 
This week I thought I'd write
about love and relationships. I feel
a little awkward approaching this
subject because it is not my field of
expertise and I don't consider my
self an especially social person.
Also, I don't date very often ...
well, ever.
But then again, we are at Stan
ford, so maybe that last one applies
to you. In any case, relationships
have a lot more to do with health
than we often think. And wherever
an important health issue lurks,
your trusted health columnist is
bound by duty to follow.
While discussions regarding ro
mance and love rarely consider
health issues beyond matters of sex
ual health, meaningful relation
ships are essential to our physical
well-being in many ways. Several
British studies have found that feel-

ings of love in
crease levels
of serotonin
and dopamine
in the body,
giving us feel
ings of elation.
Studies have
also shown
that unrequit
ed love can
lead to heart
problems and

symptoms of obsessive compulsive
disorder. These potential health ef
fects make the old adage that
"there's no dating at Stanford"
seem more ominous.
Greek organizations and dorms
have responded to this concern by
throwing formal events that en
courage students to find dates.
Vaden offers specialized counsel
ing and psychological services to
students who feel lonely or have re
lationship troubles.
Recently, however, it has come
to my attention that there is a per
son more fit than either fraternities
or University administration to
combat the romantic concerns that
plague so many Stanford students.
This person is presently spreading
the gospel of dating, relationships
and social skills across the Stanford
kingdom. And she's doing it with a
blog.
Junior Marie Cannizzaro, who
goes by the Web moniker Marie
Christine, is the creator of "Stanford
Single" (http://www.xanga.com
/stanfordsingle), a Web site that as
pires to "make Stanford more social,
one student at a time."
Visitors to the blog are greeted
by a title bar with the ambitious
proclamation "Go from awkward
to awesome just by reading this
blog!" and clip-art of pouting red
lips. From my very first visit to
"Stanford Single," I could tell the
Web site was going to change my
life.
Through general commentary
and didactic illustrations using typi
cal Stanford students "Naaron" and
"Boomqueesha," Marie Christine
teaches the basics of decent human
interaction to the socially awkward.
Her first five posts have covered
phone etiquette for men and
women, rules on who should make
the first move and thoughts on
"Why the Stanford dating scene
sucks — and what to do about it."
Clever mnemonics make the practi
cal suggestions easy to remember.
Impressed and intrigued by the
sage advice I found on her Web site,
I arranged for an interview with the
alluring Web mistress. And now,
for the benefit of the entire Stan
ford community, 1 present our casu
al, entirely unscripted conversation
here:
Priya Jayachandran: What quali
fies you to give the kind of advice
that you do?
Marie Cannizzaro: I think I'm pret
ty unique in that I have a significant
amount of experience with both se
rious relationships and playing the
field. I know what it feels like to be
rejected and how awesome it is
when you find someone you really
click with. Also, I'm really into in
terview and selection processes,
and I think there are a lot of paral
lels between that and dating — like
identifying the appropriate candi
dates and projecting a desirable
image.
PJ: Do you think it is true that there
is no dating at Stanford? And if so,
why?
MC: In my opinion, the dating
scene here is severely handicapped
fora variety of reasons. First of all,
we're at a competitive university
full of high achievers. We don't
