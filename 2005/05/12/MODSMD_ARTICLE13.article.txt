# Keeping hydrated during exercise: How much water is too much?
## 
### KRISTIN COHOON 
Ask a room of college students how much water a seden
tary person should drink each day and you will hear a unan
imous and resounding cry of "eight glasses." Even the most
casual runner has doubtless heard warnings about dehy
dration.
But most students don't know exactly what counts to
ward the goal of hydration. Myths abound about the dehy
drating powers of tea, coffee and alcohol. So what do most
students end up doing? They stop keeping track of their in
take.
"I know you're supposed to drink water all day, but I'm
not always good about it," said junior Amanda Schwartz. "I
think about it most when I know I'm going to run." After a
run, Schwartz said she drinks two or three glasses of water.
The concern is usually about drinking too little water —
rarely do people stop to think that they may be drinking too
much.
"From a scientific point of view, I know your cells can
burst if you drink too much water," Schwartz said. "I don't
know how much water is too much, though."
An April 14 article in The New York Times recently
brought this issue into the public eye. According to the
article, 13 percent of the 488 runners in the 2002 Boston
Marathon were diagnosed with hyponatremia, or very
low blood sodium levels, after completing the 26.2-mile
odyssey. Hyponatremia is a condition of low sodium lev
els in the blood, and can even cause seizures or death
According to the article, slower runners who take more
than four hours to complete the course tend to stop more
often and drink more at rest stops. Because the kidneys
shut down during hard exercise, cells become overfilled
with water, and the brain stem can be compressed, which
can disrupt vital functions.
Although the body does a fairly good job of reabsorbing
salts lost through perspiration, prolonged exercise can de
plete sodium that is not routinely replenished. Athletes
may lose more than two grams of salt per liter of water,
which means that at least a gram of salt is lost in each hour
of intense exercise. Sports drinks that include sodium and
salty foods are good for marathon runners, and increasing

sodium intake in the days prior to a
race can also reduce the risk of hy
ponatremia, according to
SportsMedWeb.com, an online edu
cational resource sponsored by Rice
University.
The symptoms of hyponatremia
are similar to those of dehydration:
nausea, cramping, lightheadedness
and confusion. Upon experiencing
these symptoms, over-hydrated ath
letes may think they are dehydrated
and drink more water, making their
hyponatremia worse.
Even Stanford athletes, well
versed in sports nutrition and train
ing, said they knew little about hy
ponatremia.
"I've heard of extreme cases
where one woman died, but I have
heard that it's not commonplace
for someone to over-hydrate," said
senior Anita Siraki, a member of
the cross country and track teams.
Junior Stanford swimmer Laura

Davis agreed.
"I know that people have died
from it, hut it would be next to im
possible fora swimmer to drink too
much water while practicing," said
Davis. "We do not have enough time
at the wall."
However, the importance of ap
propriate hydration cannot be ig
nored — the key is to replenish fluids
and electrolytes. Even very experi
enced runners can drastically mis
judge the amount of fluid lost. In a
study by the Gatorade Sports Science
Institute, IS veteran runners in a 10-
mile race underestimated both the
fluid lost by sweat and their fluid in
take so greatly that they only replen
ished 30 percent of their body water.
Even a 2 percent loss in body flu
ids can reduce performance by 10
percent. Athletes may not feel
thirsty until much later, especially in
humid climates.
The human thirst response is
much less developed than in other
animals such as dogs.
According to Sports Guide Mag
azine. seven ounces of water every
15 minutes is a very reasonable
amount of fluid to drink during in

tense exercise. This amount exceeds
older recommendations, which ad
vocated drinking 4 ounces of water
every 15 minutes.
"1 feel like coaches at Stanford
don't emphasize hydration all that
much," Siraki said. "They assume
that we already have it down by
now."
Both Siraki and Davis said they
work hard just to replace the water
they lose.
"I have to consciously think
about it because I tend not to drink
during practice," Davis said. She
practices five hours a day in two ses
sions during swim season.
"It is harder being in a pool be
cause it masks the fact that you
need water," she said. "1 could
never get to the point of drinking
too much, because I hate water."
she added.
Siraki, who runs about 80 miles a
week, said she tries to rehydrate —
particularly in hot weather.
"When I'm trying to stay hy
drated I try to drink about twelve
cups of water a day" said Siraki.
"At least eight cups. That's not
very much."
