# Keeping hydrated during exercise: How much water is too much?
## 
### KRISTIN COHOON 
Ask a room of college students how much water a seden
tary person should drink each day and you will hear a unan
imous and resounding cry of "eight glasses." Even the most
casual runner has doubtless heard warnings about dehy
dration.
But most students don't know exactly what counts to
ward the goal of hydration. Myths abound about the dehy
drating powers of tea, coffee and alcohol. So what do most
students end up doing? They stop keeping track of their in
take.
"I know you're supposed to drink water all day, but I'm
not always good about it," said junior Amanda Schwartz. "I
think about it most when I know I'm going to run." After a
run, Schwartz said she drinks two or three glasses of water.
The concern is usually about drinking too little water â€”
rarely do people stop to think that they may be drinking too
much.
"From a scientific point of view, I know your cells can
burst if you drink too much water," Schwartz said. "I don't
know how much water is too much, though."
An April 14 article in The New York Times recently
brought this issue into the public eye. According to the
article, 13 percent of the 488 runners in the 2002 Boston
Marathon were diagnosed with hyponatremia, or very
low blood sodium levels, after completing the 26.2-mile
odyssey. Hyponatremia is a condition of low sodium lev
els in the blood, and can even cause seizures or death
According to the article, slower runners who take more
than four hours to complete the course tend to stop more
often and drink more at rest stops. Because the kidneys
shut down during hard exercise, cells become overfilled
with water, and the brain stem can be compressed, which
can disrupt vital functions.
Although the body does a fairly good job of reabsorbing
salts lost through perspiration, prolonged exercise can de
plete sodium that is not routinely replenished. Athletes
may lose more than two grams of salt per liter of water,
which means that at least a gram of salt is lost in each hour
of intense exercise. Sports drinks that include sodium and
salty foods are good for marathon runners, and increasing
