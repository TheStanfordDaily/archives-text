# Steroids: Are the risks worth the muscles?

### JASON BRUMMOND THE DAILY IOWAN (U. IOWA 
It's hard to say no.
One Internet site selling "safe" anabol
ic steroids tells potential customers they
will get stronger faster by using their prod
uct. "Gain incredible muscle mass and
strength!" the site advertises, "Get vascu

lar, hard, and ultra ripped!"
Doctors and witnesses of anabolic
steroids agree the drug works.
Charles Yesalis, a professor of health pol
icy and administration at Pennsylvania State
University who has researched steroids for
25 years, said results of increased muscle
mass and a better physical appearance
doesn't help deter steroid use.

"I think the major side
effect of anabolic steroids is
that they work," he said.
"The so-called benefits are
things that are valued very
much by our society, so it's
easier to overlook them."
Steroid abuse has gained
increasing attention in pro
fessional sports, from base
ball to, most recently, horse
racing. A handful of major
league players have been
suspended under baseball's
new policy, but experts warn
the attention will increase in
terest in high-school stu
dents.
All the anabolic steroids
are a synthetic version of the
primarv male sex hormone.

testosterone. Steroids are available legally
only through prescription, usually to treat
conditions in which abnormally low amounts
of testosterone are produced.
Anabolic steroids can be taken orally or
injected, and they are usually cycled over
weeks or months. Cycling means "taking nu
merous doses of steroids over a specific peri
od of time, stopping fora period, and starting
again," according to the National Institute on
Drug Abuse.
The agency also says that users often
consume several different types of steroids
simultaneously — called stacking — to
maximize effectiveness and minimize neg
ative effects. Athletes use steroids to en
hance performance and physical appear
ance.
"They make you bigger and stronger and
allow you to train more frequently with
greater intensity for longer period of times,"
Yesalis said.
Two years ago, lowa catcher Kris Welker
played on a junior-college team with at least
"four or five" steroid users.
Performance increased dramatically for
the players at the College of Southern Idaho,
Welker said.
He remembers watching an average hitter
turn batting practice into a home-run derby.
"There is a visible difference," he said.
"You can definitely tell guys that are on it."
The encouraging performance results is
what worries coaches.
The negative effects are overwhelming.
Oral anabolic steroids can adversely af

feet the liver and the lipid profile — causing
good cholesterol to plummet, Yesalis said.
Steroid abuse can also lead to jaundice,
high blood pressure, severe acne, and trem
bling, according to the drug-abuse institute.
It warns that many side effects of steroids
are sex-specific.
In men, steroid abuse can cause shrinking
of the testicles, reduced sperm count, bald
ness, development of breasts, and increased
risk for prostate cancer.
In women, the drugs can cause facial hair
growth, permanent deepened voice, and
male-pattern baldness.
"There are potential effects on the repro
ductive system," Yesalis said.
"In many men, it causes your sperm count
to go down to castrate levels. In women,
these drugs can permanently masculinize
[them]."
In teenagers, steroid use can close growth
plates down and permanently stop growth if
the drugs are taken before an adolescent
growth spurt, Yesalis said.
Some studies illustrate that steroid abuse
changes the mindset and causes extreme
mood swings, the drug-abuse institute says.
Depression, paranoid jealousy, extreme
irritability, delusions, and impaired judg
ment can occur, according to the American
Journal of Psychiatry.
"The negative side effects are overwhelm
ing," said lowa Football Strength and Condi
tioning Coach Chris Doyle.

"You're immediately going to
start altering your whole makeup."
Despite the obvious dangers, the
extent of research on the long-term
effects of steroids is limited, Yesalis
said.
Three research proposals in the
late 1980s and early 1990s by
Yesalis and a team of international
experts were rejected for funding.
He speculates that other abused
drugs present a more serious threat.
Binge drinking, for example, is
more wide-spread on campuses
than steroid abuse.
But Yesalis thinks that shouldn't
dismiss steroids as a problem.
"Cocaine and heroin, in my opin
ion, are more dangerous than
steroids, but that doesn't give you you
meaning the government — a ratio
nale to ignore [steroids]." he said.
"I think in great part they've
been ignored. There has been some
research money given to this, but it
has been far too little in my judg
ment, even taking into account that
we have more serious drugs of
abuse out there."
