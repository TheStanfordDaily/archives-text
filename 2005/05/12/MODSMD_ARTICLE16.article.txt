# Students return to liquor of Van Gogh

### YASHODA SAMPATH DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Tex.—
The green fairy is making waves
again. Despite a negative reputa
tion, absinthe has seemed to make a
comeback in favor among intellectu
als and college students. Whether
they import it through customs or at
tempt to make it themselves, people
are finding ways to acquire this mys
terious beverage.
Created in 1792 by Dr. Pierre Or
dinaire, absinthe was originally mar
keted as a cure for tapeworm and
other digestive diseases. However,
once Henri-Louis Pernod acquired
the recipe, he marketed it to the
French army in the 1840s as a way to
ward off tropical fever, dysentery
and fatigue. When the boys came
back home, the drink became a hit.
Though Pernod's drink became a
staple among intellectual elites all
over Europe, it was hardly afford
able for the proletariat. Cheap
knock-offs eventually gave absinthe
a bad reputation. Inexpensive
brands would use all manner of sol
vents and dyes to achieve the trade
mark green color, and these chemi
cals often account for the madness
and murder attributed to absinthe
drinking, said Ted Breaux,
renowned absinthe expert and
founder of Jade Liqueurs, a brand of
absinthe.
"The wine industry put forth a
bunch of hokev science which was

aimed at maligning absinthe,"
Breaux said. "Absinthe was so pop
ular it put them at a disadvantage, so
they lobbied strongly against it."
The drink was banned in the
United States in 1912, following a
French ban seven years before.
Then in the 19705, the FDA passed
legislation forbidding the importa
tion and sale of any alcoholic bever
age containing artemisia absinthi
um, also known as wormwood, one
of the main active ingredients in ab
sinthe.
Absinthe minus the wormwood is
commonly for sale in the United
States, but possession and consump
tion of the wormwood variety is not
illegal. Absinthe drinkers need only
rely on customs to look the other
way when travelers attempt to im
port absinthe.
Despite its reputation, modern
connoisseurs insist that the so-called
hallucinogenic effects are nothing
but myth.
"It's a potent herbal liquor made
with a variety of herbs with estab
lished medicinal properties,"
Breaux said. "Calling it a hallucino
gen is marketing crap."
The intended effect of absinthe,
Breaux added, is to give the drinker
an unusual sense of clarity in spite of
the high alcohol content.
Nonetheless, many students
credit their interest to the bohemian
aura that surrounds absinthe, know
ing full well that the reputation for
hallucinations may be false.

"I think the appeal comes from
the whole concept," Dale Hsieh, a
University of Texas alumnus and ab
sinthe fan, said. "It's so shrouded in
this mystique. You hear about all
these great painters using it, and
that's what attracted me."
Artists and writers including Vin
cent Van Gogh, Edgar Degas,
Ernest Hemingway and T.S. Eliot
have credited the green muse for
providing them with inspiration.
"The first stage is like ordinary
drinking, the second is when you
begin to lee monstrous and cruel
things, but if you can persevere, you
will enter in upon the third stage,
where you see things that you want
to see, wonderful curious things,"
famed writer/philosopher Oscar
Wilde said about "la fee verte" or
the green fairy in French.
When Van Gogh couldn't get a
hold of a bottle he would drink tur
pentine as a substitute.
More recently, the infamous
green fairy was brought to life in the
film "Moulin Rouge," taking the
form of Ewan McGregor singing the
title song from"The Sound of
Music." The film is often credited for
the resurgence of interest in absinthe.
"Absinthe is popular not because
of its hallucinogenic effect but be
cause it is a deceptively strong bev
erage with a very pleasing taste,"
Breaux said.
However, quality taste certainly
does not apply to the homemade or
Eastern European varieties.
