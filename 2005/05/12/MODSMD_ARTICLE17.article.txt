## Editorial Peer academic advising needs rethinking 
### 
Freshmen in the class of 2(XW will he
greeted by Peer Mentors, or PMs, instead
of Peer Advising Assistants, or PA As. The
new peer mentor position combines the re
sponsibilities previously held by PAAs and
Orientation Volunteers, eliminating the
need for two large groups of volunteers to
do perform largely similar tasks over the
course of Orientation Week.
However, we are concerned that this
change could fundamentally alter the na
ture of peer academic advising at Stan
ford. Tellingly, volunteers were once
known as Peer Academic Advisors, then
downgraded to Peer Advising Assistants
and finally called Peer Mentors. While
this could be seen as a string of insignifi
cant name changes, it appears as if the
academic component of peer advising has
been slowly drained from the undergrad
uate advising program. As it stands, the
new Peer Mentor program looks set to be
come a glorified Big Sib program.
Indeed, the new PM program reflects a
shift from previous years, when PAAs were
able to give more directed academic advice.
The online application form for Peer Men
tors makes it clear that PMs are to "answer
questions on 'HOW' and 'WHERE' to ac
cess resources and information, guiding
students through the process. Iliey should
NOT, however, assist students in making
academic decisions. If any of these ques
tions come up, PMs should strongly en
courage the students to discuss these issues
with their Academic Advisor."
But this only creates more problems,
because many Academic Advisors are not
familiar with the academic system at Stan
ford. Many Academic Advisors are, by
and large, poorly equipped to respond to
students' needs. First, many students are
assigned Academic Advisors who are out
side of their department of interest. In ad
dition, they rarely meet with students for
more than a couple of times a year. This
represents a serious gap in the current un

dergraduate advising program.
We feel that Peer Advising Assistants
could potentially step in to fill the gap.
Many students rely on the advice of their
peers rather than Academic Advisors
when making decisions about which
courses to take. Incoming freshmen can
relate better to peer advisors than their
Academic Advisors, just as Peer Aca
demic Advisors can give advice that is
more practical and relevant. Unfortu
nately, the current PAA program fails to
live up to its potential, because many Peer
Advising Assistants do little to help fresh
men once orientation ends. PMs, who will
been even less involved with students'
academic lives, are hardly a solution.
Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the
fact that the University administration rec
ognizes the problems with the current ad
vising system, and are taking concrete
steps to improve the situation. We also ap
plaud the University's commitment to un
dergraduate advising, especially in terms
of the financial support that has been chan
neled in this direction. In spite of all our
grouses, there are many excellent academ
ic resources on campus, including depart
mental advisers, student services special
ists and peer tutors. Also, we believe that
the people responsible for changes in the
undergraduate advising program have
their heart in the right place, and genuine
ly want to create an advising program that
benefits undergraduates in concrete ways.
As such, we hope that the Undergradu
ate Advising Programs and the Freshman
Dean's Office will carefully evaluate the
new Peer Mentor program in its first year
next fall. The Peer Mentor program has
the potential to help freshmen navigate
their way through the labyrinth of oppor
tunities that Stanford has to offer. Howev
er, we urge the offices involved to consider
reintroducing peer academic advising pro
grams in a meaningful way to the incoming
freshmen community.
