# Writing in the Margins
## Caught out there

That's it. No more. I have had with The
Stanford Review. I wasn't going to say
anything about it here, in the sacrosanct
world of literature that is my column. But
then, well. The Review just had to put its
mouth onto my area of the world: books.
Right now, sitting on my lap, I have the
latest issue of everyone's favorite Bush
loving campus publication, and it's all
about books.
Not only is The Review all about

books this week, its examination of the written word gives
my putrid column a run for its money as the worst literary
outlet on campus. In the first paragraph of a review of
Hoover Fellow Robert Conquest's book "Dragon of Ex
pectation," Tristan Abbey manages to discuss Conquest
without employing even a drop of irony. Oh. but it just gets
better. Abbey's article laundry lists Conquest's stunningly
original views on special interest groups (they are evil, es
pecially those who want women to be allowed to fight as
combat infantry) and the United Nations. And then, after
wading through all this sludge, I have to sit and read as
Abbey informs me that Conquest thinks that "education
no longer seems geared to training students how to think
critically."
Well here I am. and I'm going to think about The Stan
ford Review. I dislike The Review's book issue not only be
cause it's stepping onto my territory. I dislike it because it is
so disingenuous. Page six features Consulting Editor Alex
Moore's wonderfully positive review of Eric Jackson's "The
Pay Pal Wars," a history of the Internet company. Even
though this article purports to review a book dealing with

the "founding" of Pay Pal, it never once mentions the names
of anyone except for Eric JackSon, who was not one of the
founders. I would have wanted to learn who founded Pay-
Pal, or who runs it these days, instead of being left in the
murky world of "brilliant entrepreneurs" and"the
founders," who seemed to experience "exhilaration."
Mr. Conquest, I'm going to try and think critically here.
On a page called "Grab Bag," The Review places an article
attacking common liberal dogma (evolution) and the great
conservative beacon, Pay Pal. It doesn't make a lot of sense.
But even more than that, how can an article about a book
that chronicles Pay Pal exist without any mention of the key
figures who have made Paypal successful, and who are, no
doubt, mentioned in Jackson's book. It can't be that The
Review running an article related in any way to Pay Pal is
slightly suspect, can it?
Why of course not. The founder of Pay Pal also happens
to be the founder of my beloved Review. Peter Thiel, as
http://www.paypal.com/html/infoweek-122401.html in
formed me, started The Review in his sophomore year, and
continued writing for it even once he began studies at Stan
ford Law School. The Review's allegiance to Pay Pal makes
the article's simple existence more understandable.
It's important to praise the hand that feeds you. Whether
or not Thiel, who no longer runs Paypal, or his successor ac
tively donated to The Review, stanfordreview.org boasts a
Pay Pal icon which begs the viewer to donate. I think The
Review has far too much money as it is. Go back to your own
territory, Stanford Review.

Seth Shamban thinks free speech is important. And yet, he hates
The Review. E-mail him at sshamban@stanford.edu.
