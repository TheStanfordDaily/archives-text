## Stanford must divest from Sudan 
### ELISSA TEST NIKKI SERAPIO 
The situation in Darfur, Sudan is dire: one
person dies every three minutes, 2 million out of
6 million Darfurians have been driven from
their homes and UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan describes the situation as "little short of
hell on earth." New York Times Columnist
Nicholas D. Kristof offers a typical scene from
the province: "I found a man groaning under a
tree. He had been shot in the neck and jaw and
left for dead in a pile of corpses. Under the next
tree I found a four-year-old orphan girl caring
for her starving one-year old brother. And
under the tree next to that was a woman whose
husband had been killed, along with her seven
and four-year old sons, before she was gang
raped and mutilated."
After the Holocaust, Rwanda and Bosnia, the
international community said that we would never
again allow genocide to be propagated against any

group, that we would do everything we could to
stop it. The situation in Darfur, Sudan is genocide
and no less than the U.S. Department of State, for
mer U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell,
Congress, the EU Parliament and Physicians for
Human Rights have found this. This time, though,
we have the ability to do something and our action
must start here, at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily has reported that the chair
of Stanford's Administrative Panel on Investment
Responsibility knows there to be at least $1 mil
lion of Stanford's endowment invested in four
companies that financially assist the Sudanese
government, the major force in executing the
genocide ("Investment disclosure denied." April
7). These companies engage in oil extraction in
Sudan, pay the Sudanese government and, ac
cording to a former Sudanese transportation min
ister, 80 percent of these oil revenues go towards
the purchase of weapons. Numerous sources cite
the use of these government weapons by Su

danese troops in the attacks in Darfur.
An important and powerful action Stanford
should and must take is to divest their endowment
from these companies that aid the government of
Sudan. This action by a world-renowned and re
spected institution would be a key step in the
broader campaign for divestment. And the fact is,
divestment works. In the 19705, '80s and '90s, a
campaign by universities and public funds to di
vest from companies doing business in South
Africa played a large part in breaking the back of
the South African government and ending
apartheid. In the late '90s, a campaign by Christian
conservatives to divest their personal portfolios
from oil companies operating in Southern Sudan
caused three major oil companies to close up shop
and leave. Two years later, an important peace
agreement sought by Christian conservatives was
signed between the Sudanese government and
