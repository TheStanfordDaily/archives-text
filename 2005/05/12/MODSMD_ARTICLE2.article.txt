# New legislation could change loan system
## Some argue that change could benefit low and middle-income students 
### DAVID KUO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Student Aid Reward, or STAR, Act
— currently under consideration in the U.S.
Senate — could change the way student loans
are distributed, particularly to low-income
families.
Colleges have two choices when it comes
to offering loans to students: the Federal Fam
ily Educational Loan Program, or FFELP,

which is offered through private lenders, and
the Federal Ford Direct Loan Program, which
is funded directly by the federal government.
However, the federal government still sup
plies subsidies to the privately funded FFELP
The STAR Act would divert $3 billion dol
lars in these subsidies — currently going to
private institutions through the Federal Fam
ily Educational Loan Program — to the Di
rect Loan Program. The STAR act would
then distribute these loans through the feder
al government's loan programs to students
from low-income backgrounds.
Private lenders form the main opposition
to this bill. Kevin Bruns, the executive direc
tor of America's Student Loan Providers, ad
vocates use of the FFELP and opposes the

new legislation.
"America's Student Loan
Providers opposes the Student Re
ward Aid Act because it is based en
tirely on the fiction that the Direct
Loan Program saves taxpayers
money and that the bill will save
even more," Bruns said.
In terms of dollars, each side ar
gues that its program makes more
sense.
A May 5 report issued by the Cal
ifornia Public Interest Research
Group, or CaIPIRG states that "ac
cording to President George W.
Bush's 2006 education budget, stu
dent loans made through the more
expensive program cost the federal
government nearly $11 more for
every $100 loaned to students than
the same loans made directly by the
federal government."
Accordingly, CaIPIRG supports
the Direct Loan Program.
Bruns, however, said he was
skeptical of the report's findings.
"It's based on numbers that don't
add up," he said. "A recent study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, and be
fore it, [government agencies],
demonstrates that budget score
keeping rules seriously understate
the true costs of the Federal Direct
Student Loan Program."
The impact of the STAR Act on
Stanford will probably not be as
dramatic as supporters of the bill

believe, said Karen Cooper, direc
tor of the Financial Aid Office,
adding that the act would take time
to significantly affect Stanford stu
dents.
"If the Student Aid Reward Act
was to be implemented as currently
written, it would have no immediate
impact on the Stanford campus,
since Stanford does not currently
participate in the Direct Loan Pro
gram," she said. "The aim of the
bill's authors is to entice more
schools to participate in the Direct
Loan Program by promising more
federal funds for low income stu
dents at schools who are participat
ing. Because of our commitment to
meet full need, for individual stu
dents there really would be no im
pact."
Cooper added that the Universi
ty has considered switching to the
Direct Loan Program in the past.
"The FAO has evaluated the Di
rect Loan Program at several points
since it was introduced in the early
1990s and has felt that our students
are better served by the FFELP pro
gram," Cooper said. "FFELP loans
make it possible for students and
their parents to borrow for educa
tional costs through private lenders
at below-market rates."
So while Cooper emphasized that
FFELP makes higher education af
fordable for students from middle to
low-income backgrounds, the Uni
versity is still monitoring the status
of financial aid policies.
"If implemented, the STAR Act
would be another factor for consid
eration," she said.
