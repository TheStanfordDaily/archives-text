# Let it be
## Loving your courses 
### 
I love my classes, and I'll
bet many of you reading this
do (or did), too. I love classes
in general, but especially
those statistics and math, my
major. I feel like I'm literally
in love with the subject.
I look forward to my class
es every night as 1 go to bed. I
dread the weekends, and
Monday is my favorite day of

the week. My favorite activities are classes,
homework and office hours — but the best thrill
of all comes from tests. I watch movies and go to
parties occasionally, but I honestly enjoy tests a
lot more. The anticipation, the practicing and
preparing for something, the adrenalin high dur
ing the test, and the relief afterward.
I'm not kidding. Learning and love are pretty
similar.
Freud had a term for the connection — subli
mation, the channeling of sexual energy into so
cial, artistic and scientific achievement.
How else are learning and love similar or in
tertwined?
If you're like me, then you literally miss my
courses, the same way one misses "a lover.
When you're serious about your subject of
study, you have a connection to other people who
are serious about that topic. My first roommate, a
French horn player who hoped to join an orches
tra, said she probably would marry another musi

cian — she wanted someone with whom she
could share this big part of her life (she's now
switched to astrophysics).
When you love people or have a crush on
them, you tend to value what they study. I started
studying math and statistics in the first place be
cause someone 1 had a crush on excelled at it, and
because I highly respected my professors in those
courses.
Picking a major feels like courtship. You
"date" many different majors and hopefully find
one that suits you and meets your criteria. It can
be stressful to be single / majorless, and you
might despair of ever finding "the right one," but
once you've found him / her / it, you know it, un
less you're more suited for polyamory or serial
monogamy...
Love and learning both can be addictive. I go
into withdrawal during weekends and especial
ly during breaks, just as when I'm deprived of
hugs and love. The more you get, the more you
come to need. Fora while, I tried to break my
addiction to learning — by taking a quarter off
and volunteering — but I was miserable, and I
think I'll just smoke a pack of courses every day
for life.
If learning is love, then Stanford is Wood
stock, and it's a great place to be.
