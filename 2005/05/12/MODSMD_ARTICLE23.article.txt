Playboy editorial is sexist
I am writing to voice my concern
about the attitudes expressed in The
Daily's editorial, "Calling All Stan
ford Playboy Models" (May 11).
Why is The Daily telling "girls"
what they should do with regard to
how they choose to display their bod
ies? I'm certain that the female pop
ulation at Stanford is intelligent
enough to find out how to sell images
of their bodies to adult magazines
without the help of The Stanford
Daily. I cannot imagine a situation in
which an editorial board would tell
any other population of students
how to make their personal choices.
Why The Daily would think that this
is an acceptable message to commu
nicate to women reflects an incredi
bly sexist and paternalistic attitude
toward its female readers. 1 expected

better of a student publication at
Stanford University.

No more bunnies
I've seen a lot of satire in The Daily,
but Flip Tanedo's letter "criticiz
ing" Andrea Runyan's columns
("No more Runyan," May 10) has
been the best. At first I wasn't sure
if he was being serious in his criti
cism of the Daily's most interesting
columns in years, but I knew he
must be joking when he suggested
that the bunnies be expanded. Ev
eryone knows that they haven't
been funny all year.
