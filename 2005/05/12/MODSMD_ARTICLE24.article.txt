## The 						Double Clutch Award carries soldier's name 
### 
Don Holleder loved his team. As a football
player at West Point, he gave up the
chance to be a two-time Ail-American
and switched positions for the good of the team.
He also loved his country. He chose to attend
the U.S. Military Academy, where each cadet is
commissioned an army officer at graduation, and
then chose to serve the nation as a professional
soldier. When his commitment was up, he re
newed his service. And in the fields of Vietnam,
he made the ultimate sacrifice for the good of a
different team.
Holleder's name lives on at the Point - those
familiar with the Academy will recognize the
Holleder Center, the indoor athletics facility -
but the recent alliance between a football coach
and a group of veterans has kept his legacy going

in another way.
Holleder came out of
super-powerhouse Aquinas
Institute in Rochester, N.Y.,
and was recruited to West
Point by an assistant coach by
the name of Vince Lombardi.
This was in the twilight of
Colonel Earl "Red" Blaik's
tenure, who in the mid-forties
had fielded some of the great
est teams in the history of in
tercollegiate football. (One of

the two Heisman Trophy winners from those
teams, Glenn Davis, died this past March.)
The 1954 team had led the nation in total of
fense and finished 7-2. But Blaik's 1955 team was
rife with holes, most glaringly under center.
The coach looked for the number one re
quirement fora quarterback - leadership - and
turned to Holleder, who had won All-America
honors as a tight end but had never played in the
backfield. Nonetheless, the rising senior wanted
to lead and made the conversion.
He didn't receive any hero's platitudes at the
time. The team struggled, and the Army faithful
— even cadets — grumbled loudly and publicly.
At one point Holleder went to the coach's office
to offer a return to his previous position, but
Blaik would have none of it and told him, "You
are my quarterback!"
As the Cadets prepared to take on a superior
Navy team, Blaik told the squad he was tired of
taking the walk across the field to congratulate
victorious coaches.
Blaik heard a voice say "Colonel, you are not
going to take that walk tomorrow!" It was his
quarterback.
Holleder was right. Leading an infantry
charge (283 yards on the ground and none
through the air), he directed a 14-6 upset that vin
dicated both player and coach. The win drew a
congratulatory telegram from none other than
five-star General and rabid Army football fan
Douglas Mac Arthur.
A decade later, Holleder went to Vietnam as
a member of the 28th Infantry, a regimental unit


Christopher
Anderson
of the "Red 1" Ist Infantry Division. The 28th
was the first American unit to win a European
engagement, earning victory at Cantigny in
France in 1917. The 28th has been known ever
after as the "Black Lions of Cantigny."
He volunteered fora second tour in Viet
nam. On October 17, 1967, with the 28th in
volved in the vicious Battle of Ong Thanh,
Major Holleder landed his helicopter in the
combat zone. With little self-concern, he pre
pared to pull the wounded out of the jungle
when he was cut down. (The battle is docu
mented in Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter
David Maraniss' latest book, "They Marched
Into Sunlight." A Tom Hanks-produced film
version is in the works.)
Said medic Dave Berry of Holleder's sacri
fice, "On a day when acts of heroism were the
rule, rather than the exception, his stood out."
Holleder left behind a wife and four chil
dren. That wasn't all, however.
Since 2001, hundreds of youth and high
school football players have received the Black
Lion Award, which coaches who participate in
the program present "to that player who best
exemplifies the character of Don Holleder."
The certificate elaborates with words like lead
ership, courage and devotion to duty.
Hugh Wyatt, a Yale graduate and football
coach now residing in the Columbia River
hamlet of Camas, Wash., was taken by Holled
er's story and posted it on his Web site. He was
soon contacted by two Ong Thanh survivors:
General James Shelton and medic Tom
Hinger, in whose arms Holleder died.
Wyatt has made it his mission to publicize
Holleder's story as an example of the sort of
thing coaches try to teach in football. With the
permission of Holleder's widow, Wyatt initiat
ed and administrated the award, which is per
sonally signed by General Shelton.
Last spring, Wyatt received word that
thanks to the sponsorship of the Army Football
Club (the association of letter winners). West
Point head coach Bobby Ross would himself be
presenting the Black Lion Award to a member
of the Army football team. The Army winner is
one of hundreds of our country's finest young
men - think of the challenge of picking just one
of them.
The first winner at West Point was senior
defensive end Will Sullivan. A graduate of At
lanta's Marist School who will go into the ar
mored branch after graduation, Sullivan wore
the Black Lion unit patch on his jersey during
the nationally-televised Army-Navy game. He
told me his first reaction to hearing his name
called was surprise — surprise that the award
didn't go to his friend Greg Washington, a
linebacker and one of the team's captains. I
The Black Lion Award is not for the most
valuable, most improved or hardest worker, al
though winners can be all those things too. It is
for the man who puts the team first. A football
team needs as many of them as it can get. So
does a military unit.
As do marriages, families, schools, business
es and all the other "units" of civil society.

Wyatt for all he's done. Email him at cpan
