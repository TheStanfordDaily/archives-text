## The
						Double Clutch Award carries soldier's name 
### 
Don Holleder loved his team. As a football
player at West Point, he gave up the
chance to be a two-time Ail-American
and switched positions for the good of the team.
He also loved his country. He chose to attend
the U.S. Military Academy, where each cadet is
commissioned an army officer at graduation, and
then chose to serve the nation as a professional
soldier. When his commitment was up, he re
newed his service. And in the fields of Vietnam,
he made the ultimate sacrifice for the good of a
different team.
Holleder's name lives on at the Point - those
familiar with the Academy will recognize the
Holleder Center, the indoor athletics facility -
but the recent alliance between a football coach
and a group of veterans has kept his legacy going

in another way.
Holleder came out of
super-powerhouse Aquinas
Institute in Rochester, N.Y.,
and was recruited to West
Point by an assistant coach by
the name of Vince Lombardi.
This was in the twilight of
Colonel Earl "Red" Blaik's
tenure, who in the mid-forties
had fielded some of the great
est teams in the history of in
tercollegiate football. (One of

the two Heisman Trophy winners from those
teams, Glenn Davis, died this past March.)
The 1954 team had led the nation in total of
fense and finished 7-2. But Blaik's 1955 team was
rife with holes, most glaringly under center.
The coach looked for the number one re
quirement fora quarterback - leadership - and
turned to Holleder, who had won All-America
honors as a tight end but had never played in the
backfield. Nonetheless, the rising senior wanted
to lead and made the conversion.
He didn't receive any hero's platitudes at the
time. The team struggled, and the Army faithful
— even cadets — grumbled loudly and publicly.
At one point Holleder went to the coach's office
to offer a return to his previous position, but
Blaik would have none of it and told him, "You
are my quarterback!"
As the Cadets prepared to take on a superior
Navy team, Blaik told the squad he was tired of
taking the walk across the field to congratulate
victorious coaches.
Blaik heard a voice say "Colonel, you are not
going to take that walk tomorrow!" It was his
quarterback.
Holleder was right. Leading an infantry
charge (283 yards on the ground and none
through the air), he directed a 14-6 upset that vin
dicated both player and coach. The win drew a
congratulatory telegram from none other than
five-star General and rabid Army football fan
Douglas Mac Arthur.
A decade later, Holleder went to Vietnam as
a member of the 28th Infantry, a regimental unit
