# No. 3 Cardinal face No. 6 Michigan
## Stanford takes aim at NCAAs 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this week, the members of the women's water polo team (20-6, 9-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) received an informative report from sopho
more two-meter defender Alison Gregorka. But the report was not on anything
even remotely related to water poloâ€”it focused, instead cm the great state of
Michigan.
Among other things, the No. 3 Stanford women learned that celebrities Stevie
Wonder, Eminem and Magic Johnson were all born in Michigan; that the state bird
is the robin; and that the Great Lakes constitute 18 percent of the world's fresh
water supply.

The'report, prepared by Gregorka at the request of head coach
John Tanner, was supposed to relieve the team's increasing feelings

of anxiety as it departed early yesterday morning for the Uni-

versity of Michigan at Ann Arbor in hopes of capturing its

first NCAA Championship since 2002.

Senior captains Hannah and Kelty Luber will be mak
ing the final appearances of their decorated collegiate

careers this weekend. They will also be competing in
the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive

year, a claim no other player in the league can
make this season.
"Kelty and I will be playing with three years
of NCAAs behind us and hope that that will carry
into the water and into our play," Hannah said.

Hie Luber twins are the only members of
this year's squad who have won an NCAA title.
As freshmen on the 2002 championship team,
they played alongside Stanford water polo leg
ends Ellen Estes, Jackie Frank and Brenda Villa.
As they prepare for their last three games as

members of the Stanford Cardinal, Hannah and
Kelty hope to end their final season on the Farm the

same way they ended their first.
"We're the only ones who have experienced
winning an NCAA championship, and we want the

rest of our team to know how it feels," Hannah said.
"We're just so proud of what the team has accom-

plished this year and we're excited to see how it
*all pans out."

For freshman driver Megan Nes
land, the coming weekend will mark her

not won the NCAA tournament since 2002.
