# No. 3 Cardinal face No. 6 Michigan
## Stanford takes aim at NCAAs 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this week, the members of the women's water polo team (20-6, 9-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) received an informative report from sopho
more two-meter defender Alison Gregorka. But the report was not on anything
even remotely related to water polo—it focused, instead cm the great state of
Michigan.
Among other things, the No. 3 Stanford women learned that celebrities Stevie
Wonder, Eminem and Magic Johnson were all born in Michigan; that the state bird
is the robin; and that the Great Lakes constitute 18 percent of the world's fresh
water supply.

The'report, prepared by Gregorka at the request of head coach
John Tanner, was supposed to relieve the team's increasing feelings

of anxiety as it departed early yesterday morning for the Uni-

versity of Michigan at Ann Arbor in hopes of capturing its

first NCAA Championship since 2002.

Senior captains Hannah and Kelty Luber will be mak
ing the final appearances of their decorated collegiate

careers this weekend. They will also be competing in
the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive

year, a claim no other player in the league can
make this season.
"Kelty and I will be playing with three years
of NCAAs behind us and hope that that will carry
into the water and into our play," Hannah said.

Hie Luber twins are the only members of
this year's squad who have won an NCAA title.
As freshmen on the 2002 championship team,
they played alongside Stanford water polo leg
ends Ellen Estes, Jackie Frank and Brenda Villa.
As they prepare for their last three games as

members of the Stanford Cardinal, Hannah and
Kelty hope to end their final season on the Farm the

same way they ended their first.
"We're the only ones who have experienced
winning an NCAA championship, and we want the

rest of our team to know how it feels," Hannah said.
"We're just so proud of what the team has accom-

plished this year and we're excited to see how it
*all pans out."

For freshman driver Megan Nes
land, the coming weekend will mark her

first trip to the NCAAs. As thrilled as she is to
be headed to Ann Arbor, Nesland said she un
derstands the importance of maintaining com
posure during these high-stakes contests.
"The team as a whole is extremely level
headed and ready to go," she said. "It really
helps a freshman like me to see that you can be
full of excitement and yet completely collected."
Nevertheless, Nesland acknowledged that
she was still in awe of the opportunity the Car
dinal have in this final weekend of competition.
"I can't quite wrap my head around [the
fact that) we're competing for the national
championship," she said. "But then again,
maybe it's better that 1 can't."
For Gregorka, the trip to NCAAs is also a

trip home. Gregorka, the only member of this
year's Stanford squad who was not born and
raised on the West Coast, will have the oppor
tunity to play in front of many of her friends
and family for the first time since she was a star
at Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor.
The Stanford fan base that Gregorka's
roots will bring to the Canham Natatorium
may minimize the disadvantage the Cardinal
will have in taking on the host team in the first
round of play. Seeded third after a strong per
formance at the MPSF tournament two
weeks ago, the Stanford women drew sixth
seeded Michigan for Friday's first-round
matchup.
The Wolverines defeated a strong Indiana
squad in the Eastern Conference end-of-the
year tournament to earn an automatic bid.
While the Cardinal have not faced the Wolver
ines this season, they say they are confident
that they will be able to silence the hometown
crowd Friday afternoon.

Provided the Stanford women pass their
first-round test, they will likelv have to face the
top two teams in the nation in order to bring
the championship title back to the Farm. First
would be No. 2 USC\ which the Cardinal upset
in the MPSFtournament semifinal with domi
nating performances in both ends of the pool.
Top-ranked UCLA remains undefeated this
season and enters the NCAA tournament as
the clear favorite.
But none of that matters to the Cardinal,
who have proved over the course of the season
that they can take both teams to their limit.
And in the two weeks since the MPSF tourna
ment. the Stanford women have had the op
portunity to get every part of their game
primed for the coming weekend.
"Finally getting all the pieces put together
at MPSFs has given us a lot of confidence,"
Gregorka said. "We've had the last two weeks
to fine-tune the little things we needed to. so
we're definitely readv to go."

The Cardinal have seen the Women of
Trov and the Bruins on multiple occasions this
season, and will not be intimidated should they
meet again in Ann Arbor.
"There's definitely no team we can't beat,"
sophomore driver Katie Hansen said. "If we
play the way we can and the way we've been
coming together lately, we have a solid chance
of winning it all this weekend."
Knowing they have the skills, the Cardinal
know that their performance this weekend will
be determined by their ability to realize their
potential.
"We're better in a lot of ways than every
team in the tournament, so winning the cham
pionship is just a matter of putting it all togeth
er for three days," Hansen said.
Gregorka agreed.
"We need to be on top of our stuff enough
that our playing will click and work like it does
every day," she said. "If everything's clicking,
there's no stopping us."

Nevertheless, Nesland acknowledged that
she was still in awe of the opportunity the Car
dinal have in this final weekend of competition.
"I can't quite wrap my head around [the
fact that) we're competing for the national
championship," she said. "But then again,
maybe it's better that 1 can't."
For Gregorka, the trip to NCAAs is also a

trip home. Gregorka, the only member of this
year's Stanford squad who was not born and
raised on the West Coast, will have the oppor
tunity to play in front of many of her friends
and family for the first time since she was a star
at Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor.
The Stanford fan base that Gregorka's
roots will bring to the Canham Natatorium
may minimize the disadvantage the Cardinal
will have in taking on the host team in the first
round of play. Seeded third after a strong per
formance at the MPSF tournament two
weeks ago, the Stanford women drew sixth
seeded Michigan for Friday's first-round
matchup.
The Wolverines defeated a strong Indiana
squad in the Eastern Conference end-of-the
year tournament to earn an automatic bid.
While the Cardinal have not faced the Wolver
ines this season, they say they are confident
that they will be able to silence the hometown
crowd Friday afternoon.

Provided the Stanford women pass their
first-round test, they will likelv have to face the
top two teams in the nation in order to bring
the championship title back to the Farm. First
would be No. 2 USC\ which the Cardinal upset
in the MPSFtournament semifinal with domi
nating performances in both ends of the pool.
Top-ranked UCLA remains undefeated this
season and enters the NCAA tournament as
the clear favorite.
But none of that matters to the Cardinal,
who have proved over the course of the season
that they can take both teams to their limit.
And in the two weeks since the MPSF tourna
ment. the Stanford women have had the op
portunity to get every part of their game
primed for the coming weekend.
"Finally getting all the pieces put together
at MPSFs has given us a lot of confidence,"
Gregorka said. "We've had the last two weeks
to fine-tune the little things we needed to. so
we're definitely readv to go."

The Cardinal have seen the Women of
Trov and the Bruins on multiple occasions this
season, and will not be intimidated should they
meet again in Ann Arbor.
"There's definitely no team we can't beat,"
sophomore driver Katie Hansen said. "If we
play the way we can and the way we've been
coming together lately, we have a solid chance
of winning it all this weekend."
Knowing they have the skills, the Cardinal
know that their performance this weekend will
be determined by their ability to realize their
potential.
"We're better in a lot of ways than every
team in the tournament, so winning the cham
pionship is just a matter of putting it all togeth
er for three days," Hansen said.
Gregorka agreed.
"We need to be on top of our stuff enough
that our playing will click and work like it does
every day," she said. "If everything's clicking,
there's no stopping us."
