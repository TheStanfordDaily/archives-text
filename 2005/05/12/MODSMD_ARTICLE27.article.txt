# Top-seeded Cardinal host NCAAs
## Barnes and Liu anxious to help give Stanford its 14th championship title 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford juniors Alice Barnes and Amber
Liu sparkle with pre-game excitement as they
prepare for tomorrow's opening round in the
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships
against unseeded Army (23-4, 5-0 Patriot
League). As the chance for another NCAA
title draws close, the effervescent duo is struck
by the realization that some childhood dreams
do, in fact, come true.
Like most players of their caliber, Barnes
and Liu ate, slept and breathed tennis from a
young age. By high school, Liu had ventured
from her La Mesa, Calif., home to travel inter
nationally in the International Tennis Federa
tion junior circuit.
She would rub shoulders and racquets with
the worldly likes of Barnes, a Cambridge. U.K.
native. Barnes reflected on the rare opportuni
ties presented to her by the fast-paced sporting
lifestyle.
"I sometimes think about the random
memories from the junior circuit, [like] meet
ing up with players from Brazil in Bangkok,"
Barnes said. "But for me, the real highlight has
been my Stanford experience.
"There's nothing like it in England,
[where] tennis feels like more of a [non-de
script] activity, an obligation," Barnes added.
"Before college I was starting to wonder, was
it worth it? I never realized that people would
care about tennis the way they do here."
Indeed, both women's personal triumphs
are supported by a slew of Cardinal accolades.
Barnes and Liu were selected to the
Pacific-10 Conference First Team for
their stellar regular-season perfor
mances, after helping Stanford to a
21-0 record.
No. 1 Stanford (21-0,7-0) is unde
feated for the second year in a row
and clinched its 18th consecutive con
ference title.
Seventh-ranked Liu (14-3) has
garnered first-conference honors in
all three of her years on the Farm,
while No. 20 Barnes (25-7) received
the honor for the second time.
In addition, Barnes received the
Northwest Region ITA / Arthur
Ashe Award for Leadership and
Sportsmanship. The modest singles
player joked about the seriousness of
the award, but appreciated its testi
mony to her quiet dedication as team
captain.
"It says something about how
you're representing your university,"
Barnes said. "I don't know how strin
gent the selection process is, but it's a
nice reminder that you try hard to
carry yourself well on the courts."
With 13 NCAA Championship ti
tles, the top-seeded Cardinal are
again the team to beat.
Liu and Barnes acknowledge this
and point out that Stanford is the only
team in the nation to emerge from
dual match play without a loss. Its two
closest competitors, No. 2 Florida and
No. 3 Kentucky, both emerged from
conference play at 12-2.
"It's easy to get caught up in lega
cy," Liu said. "But I treat every season
as a last season, and I think that's what
makes it so memorable. "
Members of the Army squad have

their work cut out for them. While
Army's top singles player, unranked
senior Marissa Limsiaco (18-16),
clings to a winning record, her lone
match against a ranked foe. No. 28
Tsippy Waterman of Division II
Nova Southeastern, ended in a
straight-set loss.
Having coached the team through
a 13-match winning streak — its
longest streak since clinching 15 con
secutive matches in 1993 — Army
head coach Paul Peck approaches the
seemingly inevitable with resolve.
"If we're going to play someone,
we might as well play the best," Peck
said in a recent press release.
Being the best doesn't always
bring out a good crowd, though.
Barnes noted that many would-be
fans are reluctant to attend Stanford
matches, citing a general resignation
over the Cardinal's unwavering suc
cess. The Cardinal are ever-deter
mined, not complacent, she said.
"It's really quite rare to see a team
accomplish this much," Barnes said.
"We put in a lot of work year-round,
with no off-season. And we know
that the dynasty we've built up can
dip before you know it."
Bames encouraged fans to come
out Friday, dispelling the myth that
tennis is always as prim and proper as
the professional world would indicate.
"It's college tennis; you can actu
ally be raucous," she said.
Stanford will take the courts at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium to
morrow at 2 p.m. No. 45 Fresno State
and No. 29 Oregon will play at 10
a.m. fora spot in Saturday's second
round.
