# Top-seeded Cardinal host NCAAs
## Barnes and Liu anxious to help give Stanford its 14th championship title

Stanford juniors Alice Barnes and Amber
Liu sparkle with pre-game excitement as they
prepare for tomorrow's opening round in the
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships
against unseeded Army (23-4, 5-0 Patriot
League). As the chance for another NCAA
title draws close, the effervescent duo is struck
by the realization that some childhood dreams
do, in fact, come true.
Like most players of their caliber, Barnes
and Liu ate, slept and breathed tennis from a
young age. By high school, Liu had ventured
from her La Mesa, Calif., home to travel inter
nationally in the International Tennis Federa
tion junior circuit.
She would rub shoulders and racquets with
the worldly likes of Barnes, a Cambridge. U.K.
native. Barnes reflected on the rare opportuni
ties presented to her by the fast-paced sporting
lifestyle.
"I sometimes think about the random
memories from the junior circuit, [like] meet
ing up with players from Brazil in Bangkok,"
Barnes said. "But for me, the real highlight has
been my Stanford experience.
"There's nothing like it in England,
[where] tennis feels like more of a [non-de
script] activity, an obligation," Barnes added.
"Before college I was starting to wonder, was
it worth it? I never realized that people would
care about tennis the way they do here."
Indeed, both women's personal triumphs
are supported by a slew of Cardinal accolades.
