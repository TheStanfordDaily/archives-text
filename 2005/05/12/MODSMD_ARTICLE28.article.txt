### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The final whistle of the college
basketball season was blown back
in April, but for two Stanford
women, the offseason isn't all rest
and relaxation. Freshman Candice
Wiggins and sophomore Brooke
Smith have been rewarded for their
successful rookie campaigns for the
Cardinal with an invitation to the
2(X)5 USA Basketball Women's Na
tional Team Trials in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
The trials will run May 1 9 to 22, as
the Collegiate Committee selects
players for both the USA Women's
Uiy World Championship Team and
the USA World University Games
Team. The 12-member Ul9 World
Championship Team will travel to
Tunis, Tunisia, to compete July 15 to
24. The 12-member World Universi
ty Games Team will compete Aug. 11
to 21 in Imzir, Turkey.
Wiggins, who at 19 is eligible for
both teams, is just one of many in the
57-player pool who boasts previous
experience in international competi
tion. She captained the 2(K)4 USA
Ul9 World Championship Qualify
ing Team that captured gold in
Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, averaging
12.4 points and 4.8 rebounds per
game, including a game-high 23
points in the gold-medal contest.
"It was amazing," Wiggins said of
her experience in last year's competi
tion. "It was an absolute honor to
have the opportunity to represent my
country, and the playing experience
was great as well. I think a key reason
to why I was so successful during my
freshman year in college has a lot to
do with my international experience
last year and I'm looking forward to
playing again this summer."
Playing her first season at Stan
ford after transferring from Duke,
Smith led the team in rebounding
while finishing second to Wiggins in
scoring. She also joined Wiggins and
senior Kelley Suminski on the All-
Pacific-10 Conference First Team.
Drawing the top high school and
college players in the nation, USA
Basketball will have no shortage of tal
ent or experience from which to select.
Seven of Wiggins' 11 teammates from

the Ul9 World Championship Quali
fying Team return this year, including
high school senior Courtney Paris of
Piedmont, Calif., who averaged 15.8
points and 9.0 rebounds per game in
Puerto Rico. Paris was also named
high school player of the year by USA
Today.
From the college ranks, six Asso
ciated Press Ail-Americans will
make the trip to Colorado Springs,
including National Player of the Year

Seimone Augustus of Louisiana
State.
Finalists for both teams will be
named following the May 22 trial
session.
"The reason why playing USA
basketball is so much fun is not only
because of the experience, but also
the friends you make," Wiggins said.
"I respect all of these girls and I
learned a lot from every one of
them."
