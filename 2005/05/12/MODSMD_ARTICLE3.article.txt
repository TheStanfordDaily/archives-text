# Students use Web site to track hookups, fetishes
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
If imitation is the most sincere form of flat
tery, then the creators of Thefacebook.com
must feel quite flattered right now.
TheAssßook.net is the first significant
rival to Thefacebook's throne of online col
lege social networking. The brainchild of a
group of students at the University of Chicago
led by junior Yitzhak Wasileski, TTieAssßook
describes itself as "an online directory that
connects people through whom they have
hooked up with."
Its design and structure intentionally
mimic Thefacebook, down to the widely re
viled "poke" feature — although TheAss-
Book has renamed it the "tap that ass" fea
ture. Instead of messages, users receive
"booty calls." You can't register a party, but
you can register an orgy.
The idea originated during the course of an
epic annual scavenger hunt at the University

of Chicago, during which students were sent
to hunt down oddities such an atlatl, a primi
tive dart gun used by Spanish conquistadors,
and a gold ingot. Item number 162 on the list
was simply "http://www.theassbook.com."
Strangely enough, that URL had already
been claimed, but Wasileski settled for
http://www.theassbook.net and turned the do
main into a working Web site. The competi
tion ended last Sunday, with Wasileski's team,
"Armadillo of Darkness," tying for first place.
A significant number of points were awarded
to his team for the creation of TheAssßook.
Even though the hunt is over, Wasileski has
decided to keep the site up and running.
"I'd kind of like to continue the project, be
cause the fundamental problem it's working
on — how do I get my users laid? — is one of
the most fundamental and basic of problems,"
Wasileski said in an interview with the Daily.
Wasileski began work last Thursday, and
the site is still in its infancy. But as of last night,

the site had 639 users, 96 of them
Stanford students. Of the more than
80 schools represented on the site,
Stanford has the second-highest
number of users following the Uni
versity of Chicago, which boasts
more than half the members.
"I think it's hot," said Stanford ju
nior Anthony Viola. "I mean, I think
it would be a good resource for Stan
ford students. It would provide a safe,
healthy outlet for their sexual procliv
ities." Viola, a counselor at the Sexu
al Health Peer Resource Center,
hasn't joined yet, but intends to soon.
Junior Joshua Smith heard about
TheAssßook through the Stanford
band's e-mail list.
"It's hilarious," he said. When asked
whether he's a member, he added, "Not
yet. Wait, wait — no. Not yet implies that
I'm going to be, and I don't think I will."
Unlike Mark Zuckerberg's experi
ence with Thefacebook, Wasileski has
no business plans for TheAssßook.
"I'll keep rolling out updates
pretty frequently, so you should be
looking for new features," Wasileski
said. "Right now it doesn't hold a
candle to Thefacebook, which is
very well-thought out and mature,
but it'll be improving with time and
there's a specific goal in mind."
Despite these plans, Wasileski
still remains down-to-earth.
"Hell, and getting some ass wouldn't
be a bad thing, either," he added.
