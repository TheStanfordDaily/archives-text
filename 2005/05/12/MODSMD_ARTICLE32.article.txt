# Supreme Court considers bans on military recruiters
## 
### NIKKI BUSKEY DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Texas — Universities could
be able to ban military recruiters from campus for dis
crimination against gays depending on a U.S.
Supreme Court case that has been set for oral argu
ments next fall.
The Supreme Court announced on May 2 that it
will consider whether a law prohibiting universities
from receiving defense funding if they ban military re
cruiters from their campuses violates the universities'
First Amendment rights.
A handful of American law schools, including
Harvard and Yale, have banned military recruiters
from their campuses since the 19705, because they
claim the military's "Don't ask. don't tell" policies
violate the schools' sexual orientation discrimina
tion policies.
The law in question, called the Solomon Amend
ment, was enacted in IW4 in response to the
schools' action. It had little effect initially, because it
only affected the law schools themselves, but it was
beefed up in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist at
tacks. The regulations were amended to disqualify
an entire university from millions of dollars in de
fense funding, if any department of the school
banned military recruiters.
Faculty and activists from several schools, many of
whom are filing anonymously, formed a coalition to
challenge the law. Called the Forum for Academic
and Institutional Rights, it argues that Congress and
the U.S. Department of Defense are violating tradi
tional values of political and academic freedom.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with

FAIR in November 2004, stating in its decision that
the Defense Department failed to show the necessity
of on-campus recruiting.
However, the dissenting opinion on the case ar
gued that it was not necessary for the Defense De
partment to prove necessity of on-campus recruiting,
because it is not a First Amendment issue. Schools
may continue to actively protest the military's "Don't
ask, don't tell" policy, if they wish.
The Defense Department appealed the case to the
Supreme Court, arguing that the exclusion of re
cruiters from campus harms its ability to find qualified
lawyers for military justice positions.
"Military lawyers play a vital role in the ongoing
combat missions of the armed forces," acting U.S. So
licitor General Paul Clement said in the government's
appeal. "The military services depend significantly on
campus access to recruit lawyers they need to carry
out their missions."
The Defense Department also stressed heightened
recruitment needs for ongoing military operations in
Iraq and Afghanistan.
Military recruiters in the Austin area refused to
comment.
According to University of Texas policy, "No per
son shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation regarding admission; employment;
or access to University programs, facilities or ser
vices."
However, representatives of the law school said
that they have not banned recruiters from campus.
University officials could not be reached for com
ment.
A decision in the case, dubbed Rumsfeld v. FAIR,
is predicted for early 2006.
