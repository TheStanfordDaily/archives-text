The tireless efforts of volunteers and pub
lic servants are not often rewarded with fancy
cheese and live piano music. But last night,
several student philanthropists were hon
ored with these and more at the annual pre
sentation of the James W. Lyons Awards for
Service and the Dean of Students Outstand

ing Achievement Awards.
Ten student groups — out of nearly 600
on campus — and eight individuals were
chosen to receive the accolades, which in
cluded plaques and medallions. These win
ners, according to Associate Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves, represent the best of
the best at Stanford.
