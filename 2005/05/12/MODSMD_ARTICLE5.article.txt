# Club sports fees the cause
## GSC budget shows decline in student fees 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council, or
GSC, approved the 2005-2006 ASSU Op
erating and Fee System Budget during
last night's meeting at the Graduate Com
munity Center. The new budget features a
decrease in graduate student fees for next
year, said GSC Deputy Chair Tom Lee,
an electrical engineering graduate stu
dent.
The GSC unanimously approved both
the ASSU Senate budget and a separate
GSC budget.
"The decrease in fees is largely be
cause Club Sports did not receive [gradu
ate student] funding this year," said GSC
Funding Committee Chair Adam Beberg,
a first-year engineering graduate student.
"We also encouraged organizations
with large reserves to spend them down,"
he added. "Even if Club Sports had gotten
their money, fees still would have gone
down."
Lee said he was sorry that the Club
Sports Program no longer receives spe
cial-fees funding from the graduate stu
dent community.
"It's unfortunate that the special fee
for club sports didn't pass," he said.
