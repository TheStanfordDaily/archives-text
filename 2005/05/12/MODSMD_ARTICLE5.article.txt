# Club sports fees the cause
## GSC budget shows decline in student fees 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council, or
GSC, approved the 2005-2006 ASSU Op
erating and Fee System Budget during
last night's meeting at the Graduate Com
munity Center. The new budget features a
decrease in graduate student fees for next
year, said GSC Deputy Chair Tom Lee,
an electrical engineering graduate stu
dent.
The GSC unanimously approved both
the ASSU Senate budget and a separate
GSC budget.
"The decrease in fees is largely be
cause Club Sports did not receive [gradu
ate student] funding this year," said GSC
Funding Committee Chair Adam Beberg,
a first-year engineering graduate student.
"We also encouraged organizations
with large reserves to spend them down,"
he added. "Even if Club Sports had gotten
their money, fees still would have gone
down."
Lee said he was sorry that the Club
Sports Program no longer receives spe
cial-fees funding from the graduate stu
dent community.
"It's unfortunate that the special fee
for club sports didn't pass," he said.

"We've had discussions with them
and were working with them to
make sure that they stay afloat this
year.'"
Club sports received 67.64 per
cent of the graduate student vote.
But because less than 15 percent of
the total graduate population voted
for Club Sports during the election,
the group failed to receive graduate
funding. They did still receive un
dergraduate funding.
"Not enough grad students
voted," Lee said. "That's something
we need to work on."
Lee said the budgeting process
was not at all contentious.
"A lot of people worked really
hard to communicate with others
about their needs for the year," he
said. "We hashed out a lot of issues be
forehand. That's why we had a rela
tively smooth budget process especial

ly when that came to the final vote."
The GSC proposed nominating a
liaison to the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate to further improve relations
with the ASSU and the undergradu
ate population.
"One of the things we'd like to do
is improve communications be
tween the different branches of the
ASSU," Lee said. The liaison will go
to the Undergraduate Senate meet
ings and represent the GSC's point
of view when appropriate.
"If something is going on, we
should be there giving the grad stu
dent perspective," he said. "There
are only a few things that only affect
the undergrad population. We will
be making sure we identify items of
mutual interest and make sure they
progress."
The council voted by consensus
to fund and sponsor an In-N-Out
Study Break, scheduled for Thurs
day, June 2. It also passed funding
requests from the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business Canadian
Club and the Stanford Malaysia
Forum.
