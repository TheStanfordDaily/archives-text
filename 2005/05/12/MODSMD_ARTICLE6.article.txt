# Study examines student writing progress
## 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
When this year's seniors were fresh
men, the Program in Writing and Rhetoric
began collecting writing samples from a
randomly-selected 12.5 percent of the class
as part of the Stanford Study of Writing, or
SSW. The goals were to observe and eval

uate the ways in which students' writing
develops, and to use the findings to
strengthen the writing services Stanford
offers.
The selected students have continued to
submit papers throughout their time at
Stanford and will be asked to evaluate
their writing skills a year after they gradu
ate, said Andrea Lunsford, director of

PWR and the project's principal investiga
tor.
Similar studies have been performed on
grade school students, but rarely on col
lege students, she said.
"We are not evaluating the writing â€”
only gathering it and describing it,"
Lunsford added.
