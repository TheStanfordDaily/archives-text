# DH spot a learning experience
## Domaracki finds place in Card offense

Freshman Brendan Domaracki didn't expect to arrive
at Stanford and step right into the Cardinal lineup. He'll

to bigger names than his on Stanford's list of 2(X)5 recruits.
Randy Molina. Brian Juhl, Darren Gemoll â€” those were
