# DH spot a learning experience
## Domaracki finds place in Card offense 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Brendan Domaracki didn't expect to arrive
at Stanford and step right into the Cardinal lineup. He'll
be the first to tell you that there were higher hopes pinned
to bigger names than his on Stanford's list of 2(X)5 recruits.
Randy Molina. Brian Juhl, Darren Gemoll â€” those were
the guys that Domaracki said were the incoming fresh
men to watch.
But when head coach Mark Marquess pencils you into
the batting order, you don't argue-you slap on a helmet,
grab a bat and swing away.
Domaracki has been one of three Cardinal players to
try his hand at the designated hitter spot. He and his coun
terparts, sophomore Ryan Seawell and junior Ben Sum
merhays, have been met with only marginal success in the
lineup, combining fora .205 batting average. The DH spot
hasn't historically been the strongest in the order for Stan
ford. but this season's struggles come along with an of
fense that is not as productive as it has been in years past.
Like the Cardinal offense as a whole, Domaracki is a
work in progess.
"The thing is, you're not going to hit .300 in college,
like all of us did in high school," he said. "During the fall.
I gained 10 pounds in the weight room. That's helped me
out as far as bat speed and strength. We've worked a lot
on my hands, my stance."
The physical adjustments have only amounted to a .207
average. And yet. Domaracki's potential seems thus far
untapped. He owns four of the five extra-base hits by des
ignated hitters, including a homerun two weeks ago that
hinted at his power possibilities. He runs the bases much
faster than his two swiped bags would indicate.
The situation alludes to the challenging mental adjust
ments necessary fora designated hitter, not to mention
fora newcomer to the Farm. Domaracki made his first
start in the Cardinal's second series of the season, and
DH learns
from veterans

since then he has had to learn to fit into his
unique role on the team game by game.
"| As a designated hitter,) if you have a had
at-hat you can't just go out in the field and get an
out. catch the next fly ball, make the next play,"
Domaracki said. "You have to go back and sit
on the bench and cheer on your team. So that's
something I've had to figure out."
112 iguring out his role on a team that is still
struggling to figure out its own identity is luckily
not something Domaracki has to do without
help. Sophomore Adam Sorgi had similar chal
lenges hist season, trying to work his way into
the up-lor-grabs Cardinal infield.
"When I have a bad at-bat [Sorgi is] the one
in the dugout telling me to keep my head up,"
Domaracki said.
For the most part Domaracki, who has near
ly twice as many at-bats as Seawell and Sum
merhavs combined, has found his stride against
non-conference opponents. He has six RBI in
Ins last three non-conference games, and his
only triple of the season knocked in the eventu
al winning run in a down-to-the-wire victory
over Santa Clara.
Pacific-10 Conference foes, however, have
posed quite a problem for the Tampa, Florida
native. I le is an anemic 4-for-39 (.103 average)
with one double in Pac-10 contests.
And, as though conference pitching wasn't
already unkind enough to the Domaracki, the
freshman suffered the most frightening hit-by
pitch incident of Stanford's season against Cali
fornia. Domaracki took a fastball to the head
two months ago that dropped him to the ground
for several minutes. It was an occurrence that
made his learning experience just a little
rougher.
"I don't remember getting hit," said Do
maracki. who still has a slight hearing loss from
the incident. "I remember going down; my ears
were ringing and I had a bad headache fora
week My first at-bat afterwards I felt a little
funny about getting back in there."
()ne thing that Domaracki has never felt any
hesitation about is his willingness to do what it
takes to help the team win, whether he is in the
batter's box or not. But if he does get the chance
to pick up a bat this weekend against UCLA, he
said that Ins at-bats will reflect the team's desire
to improve its situational hitting to make up for
the power lost in the offseason.
"Moving runners over," Domaracki tics the
( ardinal's goals off on his fingers. "Not needing
to get the big inning and instead scoring one or
two runs every inning. Getting clutch singles."
I he gameplan may take a little time to be
come a consistent component of Stanford's ar
senal, but Domaracki doesn't seem concerned.
Alier;Ul. lie knows what it's like to be a work in
progress.
