Few events during the school year bring together
Greek organizations, all-frosh dorms, student-led reli
gious groups and local high schools. But the American
Cancer Society's signature activity. Relay for Life, has
accomplished this feat, uniting Stanford students and
locals in a 24-hour-long event to combat cancer.
While the main goal of Relay for Life is to raise
money for the American Cancer Society, it also re
members those who have lost the battle against cancer
and those who have survived. This year's relay will start
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium.
Nine dorms, six fraternities, four sororities, a di
verse array of student groups and area high schools

cy efforts.
The heart of the event is the actual relay, during
which teams will try to keep at least one member of its
team running or walking on the stadium track for the
entire 24 hours.

with each day of being a cancer patient," said Stanford
Relay for Life C o-director Megan Shackleton. a junior.

promote cancer awareness.

encourage any student survivors to participate,"
Shackleton said. "There will be cancer awareness edu
cation going on throughout the day. as well as a lumi
naria ceremony at night."
Luminaras, paper bags filled with sand and candles,
are meant to represent cancer victims and honor those
who are fighting or have successfully fought the dis
ease. Luminarias will light the way for those on the
track throughout the night, Shackleton said.
Aside from the relay, entertainment will be provid
ed throughout the day. Among the performers will be
Stanford Counterpoint, Bent Spoon and Mixed Com
pany. Seniors Chris Babson and Chris Ayer will also
perform.
Shackleton added that Relay for Life has played an
integral role in the Cancer Society's successes.
"The American Cancer Society has made amazing
strides in the search fora cure, and I think that all of us
participating have confidence in the work that they do.
and faith that by supporting their organization, hope
fully someday there will be no more need for Relay,"
she said.
