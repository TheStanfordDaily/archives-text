### BRENDAN SELBY SENIORS STAFF- WRITER 
Yesterday morning at 3:55 a.m. sopho
more Matt Vassar could be heard from as
far away as El Centro Chicano reading
from Jon Stewart's best-seller "Atneri
ca." Vassar had an audience of one â€” his
fellow filibusterer Bobby Lepore. a
sophomore, who had just finished reading
excerpts from the 4/11 Commission re
port.
Other reading material has included
the Harry Potter series and the Declara
tion of Independence.
"It's actually a fun document to read."

said sophomore Marie Jonas, president of
the Stanford Democrats, referring to the
Declaration. "It has a little spark to it."
Having started on Wednesday at noon,
the Stanford filibuster was scheduled to
last for 25 hours. Instead, it will continue
until at least I p.m today and possibly
longer.
The participants are protesting the ef
forts of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill
Frist (R-Tenn.) to change Senate rules to
prohibit Democrats from using the fili
buster to block President George W.
Bush's judicial nominees. A filibuster is a

A student reads from the U.S. Constitution during the second hour of the filibuster in White
Plaza. The protest has already run over its originally scheduled 25-hour run.
Senate tactic that enables a minor
ity party to prolong debates on an
issue ad infinitum, effectively
killing any legislation by prevent
ing it from reaching a vote.
"There have been so many peo
ple asking about it and signing up.
so we decided to continue it for an
extra day." said freshman De
bashish Bakshi, a member of the
Stanford Democrats who helped
man the filibuster's table yesterday.
The Stanford filibuster is mod
eled after a similar protest at
Princeton, Frist's alma mater,
which has garnered national media
attention.
One hour at a time, Stanford
students have been reading aloud
from anything they please at a
makeshift podium under the Bird

cage in White Plaza.
While the Stanford students
cannot boast the 3K4 hours logged
by their Princeton peers, they have
already passed the marks set by
protesters at both I larvard and UC
Berkeley, who ended their fili
busters on schedule, at 25 and 26
hours, respectively.
Thus far. Political Science Prof.
Larry Diamond has been the only
faculty member to participate.
Diamond, who served as an ad
viser to the American-led Coali
tion Provisional Authority in Iraq
early last year, made an appear
ance at the podium on Wednesday
afternoon to give a "non-partisan"
speech on the importance of the fil
ibuster.
Sixty out of 100 U.S. Senators
will have to vote to end debate on a
judicial nominee in order to end
the current filibuster and force a
vote. Frist is currently attempting
to change the requirement to a sim
ple majority, to to 51 votes,to

break up the filibuster. If Frist and
his colleagues succeed, the right
for legislators to filibuster could be
abolished entirely.
When she finished her time slot
at 1 p.m. yesterday, the first thing
Jonas did was reach fora bottle of
water. She had already read for
two and a half hours the day be
fore.
"Yesterday was okay but today
my voice is a little shot," she said.
"I try to project into the plaza."
Jonas read at a particularly diffi
cult time, having to compete with
the stereos set up by Raagapella
and the Mendicants.
As of yesterday afternoon.
Jonas said that more than 50 peo
ple had participated in the Stan
ford filibuster and more than 200
letters had been signed to send to
U.S. Senators. There were also a
few late-night slots that had not
been claimed, which the organizers
have been trying to sell as the
"drunk hours."
