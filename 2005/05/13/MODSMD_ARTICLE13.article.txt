# Junior to teach fiscal responsibility
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many young adults from low-in
come backgrounds start their adult
lives with little financial knowledge.
That's a problem, says junior Jamelia
Morgan — and she's got $ 10.(KH) to
change that.
Morgan recently won the Donald
A. Strauss Public Service Scholar
ship, a grant given to about 14 Cali
fornia college juniors each year. The
program Morgan designed is called
SMARTS — short for or Strength
ening Monetary Acquisition and Re
sponsibility with Teaching and Sup
port — a series of workshops intend
ed to equip low-income youth in East

Palo Alto with knowledge and skills
to help them improve their financial
situations later in life. The workshops
will cover topics including managing
money, saving for the future, creating
and balancing a budget, building
good credit and understanding loans.
"I've had the idea for SMARTS
fora while," Morgan said. "I realized
that the lack of financial education is
one thing that is seriously hindering
young people in low-income commu
nities. I wanted to create a way to
help these young people learn sound
financial practices."
All of Morgan's lesson plans will
include homework assignments, such
as balancing a fictional checkbook in
order to measure fiscal competency

and the program's effectiveness.
SMARTS will be integrated into
after-school programs at some local
Bay Area high schools this fall.
"Instead of reinventing the wheel.
SMARTS seeks to build upon exist
ing programs at local schools or in
low-income communities," Morgan
said, adding that she will be using a
majority of the scholarship funds to
support and expand the program.
Morgan is no stranger to public
service. As a college freshman, she
became involved with the AIDS
Treatment Access Initiative group
and was in charge of planning the San
Francisco AIDS walk to raise money
