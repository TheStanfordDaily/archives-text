# Junior to teach fiscal responsibility
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many young adults from low-in
come backgrounds start their adult
lives with little financial knowledge.
That's a problem, says junior Jamelia
Morgan — and she's got $ 10.(KH) to
change that.
Morgan recently won the Donald
A. Strauss Public Service Scholar
ship, a grant given to about 14 Cali
fornia college juniors each year. The
program Morgan designed is called
SMARTS — short for or Strength
ening Monetary Acquisition and Re
sponsibility with Teaching and Sup
port — a series of workshops intend
ed to equip low-income youth in East

Palo Alto with knowledge and skills
to help them improve their financial
situations later in life. The workshops
will cover topics including managing
money, saving for the future, creating
and balancing a budget, building
good credit and understanding loans.
"I've had the idea for SMARTS
fora while," Morgan said. "I realized
that the lack of financial education is
one thing that is seriously hindering
young people in low-income commu
nities. I wanted to create a way to
help these young people learn sound
financial practices."
All of Morgan's lesson plans will
include homework assignments, such
as balancing a fictional checkbook in
order to measure fiscal competency

and the program's effectiveness.
SMARTS will be integrated into
after-school programs at some local
Bay Area high schools this fall.
"Instead of reinventing the wheel.
SMARTS seeks to build upon exist
ing programs at local schools or in
low-income communities," Morgan
said, adding that she will be using a
majority of the scholarship funds to
support and expand the program.
Morgan is no stranger to public
service. As a college freshman, she
became involved with the AIDS
Treatment Access Initiative group
and was in charge of planning the San
Francisco AIDS walk to raise money
for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation.
As a sophomore, Morgan was
elected president of the Stanford Na
tional Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People and was re
sponsible for implementing an
NAACP-sponsored tutoring pro
gram at a local, low-income charter
school in East Palo Alto.
When she received the phone call
from Duncan Strauss, son of the
scholarship's namesake, informing
her she had won, she was shocked.
"I couldn't believe I was select
ed," she said. "1 actually thought he
was calling to set up an interview.
After that, 1 went on a calling frenzy
and told everyone I knew."
After graduation, Morgan said
she plans to work and then return to
Stanford to receive a business degree
with a focus in social entrepreneur
ship. Eventually, she hopes to start
her own nonprofit organization pro
viding low-income workers with the
financial knowledge that inspired the
creation of SMARTS.
Winning the Strauss scholarship is
a dream-come-true, she said.
"I honestly feel overwhelmed by
the opportunity to really make a dif
ference in our surrounding commu
nity," she added. "Like many Stan
ford students. I talk about changing
the world a lot, so in a way. I feel like
I am one step closer to that goal."
