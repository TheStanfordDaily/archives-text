"The world is changing at a faster rate than any other
time in history," said Richard Lampman. senior vice
president and director of Hewlett Packard Labs, during
a talk last night. "There's no better time to be an inven
tor and entrepreneur."
In a speech sponsored by the Stanford School of En
gineering, the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity and the Stanford
Program in Science, Technology and Society, l ampman
attributed HP's immense success to its unique approach
to research.
"HP has become an increasingly rare animal in the
corporate world," he said. "Fewer companies are looking
at long-term research, but it pays to have researchers
looking beyond the quarter to quarter, year to year ap
proach. The $3.5 billion a year we invest in research and
development has made us one of the 10 most innovative
companies in the world."

A changing customer base, a shift toward focusing on
software and collaboration with other companies has
helped HP develop into the company it is today, he said,
emphasizing that HP is not "working on technology for
technology's sake."
"HP works with customers to understand where we
need to drive our technology." he said.
Lampman also described four projects HP is current
ly working on. all based on collaboration with customers
and other companies. One of these projects is radio fre
quency identification, or RFID. advertising.
"With things like TV on the internet and TiVo, the
traditional advertising world is under pressure," Lamp
man said. "RFID in the retail environment can be built
into cell phones and can provide customized information
for customers. For example, if you were buying a CD you
would simply have to walk up to it and you could get sam
ple tracks on your cell phone. You could download re-
views for productsjust by walking up
to them. If you like a movie and want
a souvenir, all you have to do is walk
up to a movie poster and the poster
will he 'Fed-exed' to your house."
Junior Nicholas Hsu. director of
the "Looking Ahead" speaker series
that brought Lampman to campus.

said that he was pleased that the lec
ture had attracted a large crowd.
Senior Justin Worth, associate di
rector of the program, said the goal
of the speaker series is to bring busi
ness. political and technological
leaders and students together.
"At the end of the speech, he said
'Just e-mail me.'" said junior An
drew Schwartz. "It's exciting that he
cared that much about students."
Additionally, Lampman offered
students looking for career advice
two take home messages.

"112 irst, you need to figure out
what's the best fit for you." Lamp
man said. "Go where the revolu
tions arc happening — healthcare,
nanotechnology, engineering. Sec
ond. stretch your view — cross-pol
linate. For example, if you're study
ing engineering, check out the busi
ness school. If you're in business,
talk to the engineers. In the real
world they intersect and you need
both a breadth and depth of knowl
edge to succeed in the coming
world."
