# Alcohol ban placed on Berkeley's Greeks

### JOSH KELLER DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.
— The University of California at
Berkeley banned Monday alcohol at
all campus fraternity and sorority
events after two incidents in the past
month have brought renewed atten
tion to the school's Greek community.
"The significant increase in the
number of non-compliant Greek
sponsored events as well as concern
raised by a number of reported hazing
incidents in chapters throughout the

Greek community obligate the univer
sity to take action," Dean of Students
Karen Kenney wrote in an e-mail to
chapter presidents on Monday.
The ban, which immediately
takes effect at the campus' 70 frater
nities and sororities, comes after two
highly publicized incidents involving
alcohol.
Three members of Pi Kappa Phi
fraternity are suspected of shooting
a pledge more than 30 times with a
BB gun last month in what police
called a hazing incident.
And earlier this month, police ar

rested four people at a ferry party
sponsored by the Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity after fights broke out,
forcing the boat to make an emer
gency stop in Oakland, Calif.
The university will lift the mora
torium when the Greek community
makes "significant progress" in pre
venting further problems, Kenney
wrote.
The university imposed a similar
ban in April 2002 after a serious in
jury and several fights at Greek
events. The ban was repealed six
months later.
