On May 13,1966, The Daily published the story "Rival
Draft Test Scheduled for Saturday," about student Viet
nam War protesters meeting their peers taking the Govern
ment's Selective Service Examination with an exam of their
own. Below is an excerpt:
"Members of the Stanford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, in cooperation with the Students fora Demo
cratic Society, will confront men taking the Government's
Selective Service Examination tomorrow with their own
special test, a spokesman for the group announced yester
day.
"The exam. 'National Vietnam Examination,' and an
accompanying message, 'Call for an Examination of Con
science,' which were drawn up by the SDS, whose nation
al headquarters is in Chicago, will be distributed at 900 of
the 1,200 Selective Service test centers throughout the na
tion, reported Norman Potter, SDS staff member at the

San Francisco regional office.
"The exam contains 18 multiple-choice questions. As
an example, There were approximately 540,(XX) South
Vietnamese in all branches of the Saigon government's
fighting forces in 1%5. About how many South Viet
namese deserted during 1965?' Of the five answers sug
gested, the highest, 113,(KX). is the correct one, according
to the documented answer sheet which accompanies the
questions.
In the 'Call for an Examination of Conscience,' the
SDS explains that their exam "will ask you questions about
the war — fair and objective questions — and about how
you see your relation to it, and what kind of government
ours has become.'
" 'When you kill a man. you kill a man. And we think
you'd better know what you're doing when you do it,' the
'Call' declares.
"Challenging the ethics of conscription and question
ing the democratic intentions of institutions which force
men to fight, the 'Call' asks, 'Why doesn't the Govern
ment look for people who want to be soldiers in the war?'
"The report continues, 'And if nobody wants to fight,
and if they can't persuade us, then why don't they quit try
ing to force us to fight? After all, the thing about Ameri
can democracy is supposed to be that the democracy is
supposed to be that the government belongs to the peo
ple. Or maybe things have changed? Maybe the real bat
tle for democracy is right here in America?' "
