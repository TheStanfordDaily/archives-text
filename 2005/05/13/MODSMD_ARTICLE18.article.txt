# Weight discrimination in the work place
## 
### SUEANN TANNIS DISTRICT CHRONICLES 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON — Al
most every day, eager shoppers pass
ing through Prince George's County
Mall can spot a slender Black man
with neatly twisted hair standing at a
colorful kiosk labeled "Edu Basics."
The man's name isTorrence Hall Jr.,
and the 24-year-old Fort Washing
ton resident is demonstrating how
the educational learning system for
kids works. It's his new job, and he
loves every minute of it.
But almost a year ago, employ
ment wasn't something to be enjoyed
for Hall — in fact, it was hard to find,
and when he did find a job. his ap
pearance often made it difficult to
keep.
"I've been on certain job inter
views and because of my plaits, I
didn't get the job." said Hall, who was
unemployed for nearly two years.
Hall claims that being a Black male
often worked against him as well. "As
a female, all you got to do is look
good and smell good. As a male, you
have to work harder," said Hall.

But for Brandy Facey. a 21-year
old from Northeast D.C. who works
in the fitness industry in Prince
George's County, discrimination on
the basis of color and gender has
been her major challenge. At her
previous department store job,
which employed mostly Whites,
Facey says she was the object of rude
comments and nonverbal insults
from both employers and customers.
She finally left after six months, but
she claims that her harassers proba
bly didn't know any better.
"If people knew more about dif
ferent cultures, they wouldn't dis
criminate as much," she said.
But while color and gender com
bined to place both Hall and Facey
in the bull's-eye of discrimination,
some people across America are fac
ing pressure at their job because of
their weight. According to the
American Obesity Association's
Web site, www.obesity.org, nearly
17 percent of persons who are more
than 50 percent above their ideal
weight reported either being fired or
forced to resign because of their ap
pearance. In addition, in its analysis

of the study the AOA stated that
more than one in four obese Ameri
cans said they were denied benefits
like health insurance because of
their weight.
But according to Helen Darling,
president of the D.C.-based Na
tional Business Group on Health,
some businesses are taking steps to
stop weight discrimination. In fact.
Darling says companies are giving
their employees reasons to remain
fit with the aim of increasing pro
ductivity.
"More and more employers are
seeing the value of helping their
workers become and stay fit and
trim." she said. "Over the past few
years, we have seen a growing num
ber of companies implementing var
ious fitness programs aimed at help
ing workers lose weight, eat healthy
and create an overall healthy
lifestyle."
In a health poll of 84 large U.S.
organizations taken last year, more
than two out of three companies ei
ther had on-site fitness centers or
sponsored or had their own fitness
programs.
