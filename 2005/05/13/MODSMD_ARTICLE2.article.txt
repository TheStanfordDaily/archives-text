# Small-town girl hits big
## CF Morris' all-around game impacts Card 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Trying out for the softball team was more difficult for
Catalina Morris than for most girls her age. While there
was a Little League team in her small hometown, there
was no softball team. In order to play the game she'd go
on to star in. Morris had to drive for an hour to Tucson,
Ariz.
Morris' hometown is one of those blips on the Ari
zona desert map. Sonoita, Ariz., is a small community
with a lot of land. The town of 2,000 averages 18 people
per square mile and boasts ranches fit for horses —
ranches where girls like Morris could learn to ride. But
ranch-related activities are about all the town can offer;
for anything else, its residents have to travel.
For Morris, softball was that perfect opportunity to
travel. She moved around often with her travel softball
team and the hour to and from home, three times a
week, made fora hectic schedule.
"It was tough because I played all the other sports in
middle school, too," Morris said. "I'd go off after basket
ball practice and practice from seven to nine at night and
come home. My parents had to do a lot of driving for
me."
All that extra gas money has certainly paid off. Mor
ris, now a junior centerfielder for No. 5 Stanford, is one
of the best all-around players in the game. Leading off
and usually getting on base is where you'll find her doing
her best: Morris leads the team with 61 hits and is second
with 13 home runs. She also holds a .365 average and has
yielded 43 runs for the Cardinal, who are looking for
their first ever conference title this weekend against one
of the teams Morris grew up watching — Arizona.
While Morris said she doesn't pay attention to num
bers, her career statistics are impressive. She hit .324 as
a freshman and then .304 last year with 63 hits and 51
runs. As part of a trio of juniors — Morris, pitcher Laura
Severson and shortstop Lauren Lappin — that has
greatly impacted the team since its first year on the
Farm, Morris has never felt the pressure to beat the bar
she set for herself her first two years.
