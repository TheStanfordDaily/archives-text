# Small-town girl hits big
## CF Morris' all-around game impacts Card 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Trying out for the softball team was more difficult for
Catalina Morris than for most girls her age. While there
was a Little League team in her small hometown, there
was no softball team. In order to play the game she'd go
on to star in. Morris had to drive for an hour to Tucson,
Ariz.
Morris' hometown is one of those blips on the Ari
zona desert map. Sonoita, Ariz., is a small community
with a lot of land. The town of 2,000 averages 18 people
per square mile and boasts ranches fit for horses —
ranches where girls like Morris could learn to ride. But
ranch-related activities are about all the town can offer;
for anything else, its residents have to travel.
For Morris, softball was that perfect opportunity to
travel. She moved around often with her travel softball
team and the hour to and from home, three times a
week, made fora hectic schedule.
"It was tough because I played all the other sports in
middle school, too," Morris said. "I'd go off after basket
ball practice and practice from seven to nine at night and
come home. My parents had to do a lot of driving for
me."
All that extra gas money has certainly paid off. Mor
ris, now a junior centerfielder for No. 5 Stanford, is one
of the best all-around players in the game. Leading off
and usually getting on base is where you'll find her doing
her best: Morris leads the team with 61 hits and is second
with 13 home runs. She also holds a .365 average and has
yielded 43 runs for the Cardinal, who are looking for
their first ever conference title this weekend against one
of the teams Morris grew up watching — Arizona.
While Morris said she doesn't pay attention to num
bers, her career statistics are impressive. She hit .324 as
a freshman and then .304 last year with 63 hits and 51
runs. As part of a trio of juniors — Morris, pitcher Laura
Severson and shortstop Lauren Lappin — that has
greatly impacted the team since its first year on the
Farm, Morris has never felt the pressure to beat the bar
she set for herself her first two years.

during Pac-10 season

"I try to take each game one at a
time and each season one at time,"
Morris said. "I knew if I just set a stan
dard for myself for batting average it
would be too hard — it would be on
my mind too much. I really tried to
forget about what I 'd done the season
before and do the best I could for that
season."
For Severson. just getting to watch
who she calls one of her closest friends
succeed is fun and exciting. According
to Severson, Morris's all around game
is what stands out the most.
"She has a gun for an arm; she hits
the ball hard; she runs fast; she drops
bunts," Severson said. "She's just
such a threat up there offensively and
defensively she's made huge plays for
us, huge catches, thrown people out.
"I remember one of the first prac
tices we had freshman year when I
saw her hit; she just lasered balls over
the right field fence," Severson
added. "The thing about her is that
she improved as a hitter. She always
pulled the ball freshman year . . .
She's become such a complete hitter
now. You see her drive the ball to all
fields. So I'm certainly glad 1 don't
have to pitch to her."
It's that sort of play that caught the
attention of the USA Softball Elite
Team. Last summer, Morris had the
opportunity to travel again for the
World University Softball Games.
But amid a busy schedule, the desert
native found time to go back home.
While Morris isn't a farm girl, in
some ways, Morris is a small-town
kind of girl. She misses horseback rid
ing, and though she doesn't ride at
Stanford, she has visited Red Barn
and still docs it at home. Severson said
Morris loves to talk about her horses,
her home and her family.
"It's something unique about her
that she embraces ... She's a truly
genuine person, and she likes to stay
true to her roots," said Severson. who

shares the small-town background,
family values and love for home with
her roommate.
The daughter of Doug Morris and
Valerie Hing, Morris exhibits small
town traits as well. Paired up with
Severson, the vivacious "cheerlead
er" for the squad, the two make an in
teresting team.
"When we came on our recruiting
trip together she was really quiet and
I'm outgoing, Severson said. "But
she's always is polite and smiles and
that says something about her — she's
a warm character. Once you get know
her she s not quiet — she's normal. We
have a lot of fun hanging out. She's def
initely somebody it takes a little while
to get to know, but once you get to
know her she's a good friend."
Her actions on the field would suf
fice to do most of the talking fora typ
ically reserved Morris. Last Sunday,
a'gainst Oregon State, the junior
homered twice, and on Friday she
went 3-for-4 with two runs scored.
Morris doesn't talk about a particular
part of the game she's improved upon,
but Pac-lOs have brought out some
thing extra.
"Once Pac-lOs started I worked on
getting mentally prepared before
every game." Morris said. "I had a
better mental approach during the
Pac-10 games and I m proud of myself
for being mentally prepared for every
game and it's helped me be more suc
cessful."
While Morris enjoys playing in the
Bay Area, her heart still lies in Ari
zona. With the weather heating up
just in time for the last regular season
series, Morris can experience a taste
of home.
"It's really hot in the summertime,
but I'm definitely a warm weather
girl." Morris said. "I'd much rather
practice in sunny weather when its
100 degrees than when it's raining and
cold."

with a lot of land. The town of 2,000 averages 18 people
per square mile and boasts ranches fit for horses —
ranches where girls like Morris could learn to ride. But
ranch-related activities are about all the town can offer;
for anything else, its residents have to travel.
For Morris, softball was that perfect opportunity to
travel. She moved around often with her travel softball
team and the hour to and from home, three times a
week, made fora hectic schedule.
"It was tough because I played all the other sports in
middle school, too," Morris said. "I'd go off after basket
ball practice and practice from seven to nine at night and
come home. My parents had to do a lot of driving for
me."
All that extra gas money has certainly paid off. Mor
ris, now a junior centerfielder for No. 5 Stanford, is one
of the best all-around players in the game. Leading off
and usually getting on base is where you'll find her doing
her best: Morris leads the team with 61 hits and is second
with 13 home runs. She also holds a .365 average and has
yielded 43 runs for the Cardinal, who are looking for
their first ever conference title this weekend against one
of the teams Morris grew up watching — Arizona.
While Morris said she doesn't pay attention to num
bers, her career statistics are impressive. She hit .324 as
a freshman and then .304 last year with 63 hits and 51
runs. As part of a trio of juniors — Morris, pitcher Laura
Severson and shortstop Lauren Lappin — that has
greatly impacted the team since its first year on the
Farm, Morris has never felt the pressure to beat the bar
she set for herself her first two years.
Lefty shines brighter
during Pac-10 season

"I try to take each game one at a
time and each season one at time,"
Morris said. "I knew if I just set a stan
dard for myself for batting average it
would be too hard — it would be on
my mind too much. I really tried to
forget about what I 'd done the season
before and do the best I could for that
season."
For Severson. just getting to watch
who she calls one of her closest friends
succeed is fun and exciting. According
to Severson, Morris's all around game
is what stands out the most.
"She has a gun for an arm; she hits
the ball hard; she runs fast; she drops
bunts," Severson said. "She's just
such a threat up there offensively and
defensively she's made huge plays for
us, huge catches, thrown people out.
"I remember one of the first prac
tices we had freshman year when I
saw her hit; she just lasered balls over
the right field fence," Severson
added. "The thing about her is that
she improved as a hitter. She always
pulled the ball freshman year . . .
She's become such a complete hitter
now. You see her drive the ball to all
fields. So I'm certainly glad 1 don't
have to pitch to her."
It's that sort of play that caught the
attention of the USA Softball Elite
Team. Last summer, Morris had the
opportunity to travel again for the
World University Softball Games.
But amid a busy schedule, the desert
native found time to go back home.
While Morris isn't a farm girl, in
some ways, Morris is a small-town
kind of girl. She misses horseback rid
ing, and though she doesn't ride at
Stanford, she has visited Red Barn
and still docs it at home. Severson said
Morris loves to talk about her horses,
her home and her family.
"It's something unique about her
that she embraces ... She's a truly
genuine person, and she likes to stay
true to her roots," said Severson. who

shares the small-town background,
family values and love for home with
her roommate.
The daughter of Doug Morris and
Valerie Hing, Morris exhibits small
town traits as well. Paired up with
Severson, the vivacious "cheerlead
er" for the squad, the two make an in
teresting team.
"When we came on our recruiting
trip together she was really quiet and
I'm outgoing, Severson said. "But
she's always is polite and smiles and
that says something about her — she's
a warm character. Once you get know
her she s not quiet — she's normal. We
have a lot of fun hanging out. She's def
initely somebody it takes a little while
to get to know, but once you get to
know her she's a good friend."
Her actions on the field would suf
fice to do most of the talking fora typ
ically reserved Morris. Last Sunday,
a'gainst Oregon State, the junior
homered twice, and on Friday she
went 3-for-4 with two runs scored.
Morris doesn't talk about a particular
part of the game she's improved upon,
but Pac-lOs have brought out some
thing extra.
"Once Pac-lOs started I worked on
getting mentally prepared before
every game." Morris said. "I had a
better mental approach during the
Pac-10 games and I m proud of myself
for being mentally prepared for every
game and it's helped me be more suc
cessful."
While Morris enjoys playing in the
Bay Area, her heart still lies in Ari
zona. With the weather heating up
just in time for the last regular season
series, Morris can experience a taste
of home.
"It's really hot in the summertime,
but I'm definitely a warm weather
girl." Morris said. "I'd much rather
practice in sunny weather when its
100 degrees than when it's raining and
cold."
