# Pop Culture Exposed
## Gossip: Shameful and debasing, but I love it 
### 
We all have our little methods of procras
tination — Thefacebook.com stalking,
checking e-mail every 15 minutes, nap
ping, AIM-ing, staring at the wall, wan
dering the hallways looking for open doors, doo
dling, cleaning or taking strange online quizzes on
sketch Web sites like "What Careßear are you?"
and "What color is your heart?"
But my latest endeavor in the art of procrastina
tion has been something near and dear to our hearts,
something we all engage in to a degree: good, old
fashioned gossip.
Now, a lot of people would call me a horrible per
son for liking gossip. But, according to a recent on
line quiz, 1 am Thug Bear and I don't have to take
that kind of crap because I listen to Tupac.
Gossip, in general, has a pretty bad rep. For most
people, it conjures up images of 13-year-old girls
whispering in the corner about you at your middle
school dance or the malicious prom queens out to
steal your boyfriend and destroy your social status.
There are even those who go out of their way to
avoid gossip, deeming it underhanded, spiteful and
backstabbing-like. They consider themselves
"saints" for avoiding the rumor mill, for not using
thefacebook.com to check out

iiiuiacviA/wiv.wiii IO VIIWVI\ vui
the subjects of said rumors and
for not judging people or spread
ing hearsay about them.
And that's fine. You can be
one of the elite "saints" and
avoid gossip because it's "im
moral" or go about actually
"helping" people, doing good
deeds to improve the world and
stay out of other people's busi
ness. But if you're like most nor-

mal people, you enjoy a nice little dish of gossip on
the latest scandal every now and then because —
let's face it — most people's lives are pretty boring
and in dire need of some juicy drama to spice it up.
And no one wants to be left out of the loop.
I'll admit that there are those who take it too far
— that is, they take gossip for fact, or they have
some kind of an agenda and really do enjoy charac
ter assassination and spreading distorted rumors.
That's a little sketch. At that point, it's not just a pro
crastination tool anymore — it's malicious.
But otherwise, typical innocent gossip about dat
ing and scandals is a natural part of any society.
Think of gossip less as slander and more like, say,
news. Or the WB. Either one.
Like other readers of the news, I like to be aware
of my surroundings. I like to know how social re
form policies are going in Washington and whether
Angelina really did break up Brad and Jennifer.
Plus, listening to gossip is like having the WB
right in front of you — you can see who's dating
whom, who cheated on whom, who had an illegiti
mate child with whom. That last one's a little less fre
quent, so you'll have to turn to the actual WB for
that kind of stuff.
And despite the amount of flack it gets for being
"immoral" and "debasing." everyone gossips, even
if they won't admit it.
If someone starts to tell you that there was this
girl this one night, and OMG. she totally cheated on
her boyfriend with the Tree from the Stanford
Band, you'd probably find it amusing fora second,
wonder why your life never had such interesting
drama like that, and then go back to working on
your problem set and lead the rest of your boring,
boring life.
Or take the interest in celebrity gossip, for exam
ple, which is usually a lot more entertaining. We may
all scoff at it as trivial news that's beneath us Stan
ford intellectuals, but you know you were just as
shocked and intrigued with all of the latest bizarre
(supposed) Hollywood hook-ups, like Tom Cruise
and Katie Holmes, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, or
Michael Jackson and eight year-old boys.
Speaking of which, I still don't buy the whole
Brad and Angelina thing. She's a Goodwill Ambas
sador. She has a little Cambodian kid. She wouldn't
do that to Brad and Jennifer. Her crazy vial-of
blood-around-the-neck days are over, I know it.
Anyway, all in all, gossip isn't as evil or malicious
as people take it to be, so long as you take it in small
doses and don't take it too seriously. We all need
some kind of gossip in our lives. Without it, we'd
have to resort to some other way of distracting us
from our boring lives, like taking strange online
quizzes or — dare I say it — actual work.

If you have any interesting gossip that can distract
Shivani from her boring, pathetic life, email her at
