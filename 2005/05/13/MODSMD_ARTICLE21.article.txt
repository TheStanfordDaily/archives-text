Although Lauren Brady, a second-year
student at the Stanford Law School, often
finds herself buried under piles of school
work, she finds time each week with young
sters at a juvenile detention facility teaching
them their basic legal rights.
The work Brady does is for free — or pro
bono in legalese. She is one of many Stanford
law students who spends hours working with
organizations to help the community and to
get real life experience.
The Stanford Law School established
the Pro Bono Initiative in 2003 to recognize
students who volunteer at least 50 hours of
pro bono work during their time at the law
school.
"All students should participate in the
Pro Bono Program to the extent possible —
be that for one hour or for one hundred
hours per year," said Anna Wang, assistant
director of public interest programs at the
Law School. "A student who meets the 50-
hour goal will be recognized for their com
munity service at the Public Service Awards
ceremony and at graduation."
Many law students say that this 50-hour
goal is very easy to meet.
"I'm already hours and hours over,"
Brady said. "Fifty hours is an admirable goal,
but if you're involved in any number of pro
jects, you will have no problem getting it."
Brady is involved with Street Law, a pro
gram in which law students teach at-risk
youth their basic legal rights.
"We go into juvenile detention facilities
and teach an eight-week program of law-re
lated education," Brady said. "The classes are
45 minutes to an hour and a half once a week
and include information on search and
seizure, Miranda rights, the juvenile deten
tion process, racial profiling, jobs and future
opportunities."
Brady said that her pro bono work has in
fluenced her future plans.
"I've always liked working with kids," she
said. "But when you get a chance to actually
work with youth who are in the juvenile jus-

tice system and see the impact on their life

and learn where they are coming

from, it makes a difference .

in terms of what you do

in your career.

That's the point

of the Pro

Bono Initia-

tive — to get peo-

ple involved in things

that pique their interest."

First-year law student Ruth

Barnes agreed that doing pro bono work
while in law school van be very influential on
life-time goals.
"I'm committed to a public interest law ca
reer when I graduate and the pro bono work
Barnes said. "When I think about how much
of a difference one or two hours can make, I
realize that dedicating my life t6 public inter
est law is absolutely what I want to do."
Barnes does pro bono work for the Com
munity Legal Services of East Palo Alto. She
conducts intake interviews with low-income

clients who do not have the means to access
paid legal help.
"I have started logging hours for the Pro
Bono Initiative and 1 think it's a wonderful
idea," she said. "Sometimes the public inter
est and private sector communities at the Law
School can be too distinct. I think it is impor
tant to encourage pro bono work among
those students intent upon a private sector ca
reer so as to create a public service communi
ty that spans the entire law school popula
tion."

Helping the community,

however, is not the only

benefit of doing pro

bono work as a

law student,

Wang said.

"Students who

contribute pro bono

service derive two main bene-

fits: serving the public good and honing

one's legal skillsWang explained. "In addi
tion, pro bono service equips students with a
better understanding of the field they are
about to enter as law students. They work
very closely with attorney supervisors and are
able lu iitwu vi the hrwrn attiun, as wdl aa
some of the challenges of the legal profes
sion" "i
Wang said that pro bono work is encour
aged not only by the Law School, but also by
the American Bar Association, or ABA,
which suggests that students complete 50
hours of pro bono service each year.

"The ethical codes of the American legal
profession provide that lawyers should aspire
to provide significant pro bono legal service,"
Wang said. "Members of the legal profession
advance the common good through rigorous
representation of clients and dedication to
ethical standards that require us to serve the
public. Stanford Law School similarly expects
its students and faculty to aspire to provide
such service."
Second-year law student Adam Ander*
son has already exceeded the 50-hour goal of
the Pro Bono Initiative.
"So far I've worked in three clinics: the im
migrants' rights clinic, the community law
clinic and the national security human rights
clinic, in which I worked on real cases with su
pervising attorneys," he said. "A certain
amount of hours of work at the clinic goes to
ward academic credit, but any overtime
counts as pro bono work."
Anderson said the importance of doing
pro bono work as a law student is intuitive be
cause students get to perform some hands-on
work. Barnes, who said she is satisfied with
her experience, agreed.
"In part it's great because you get to see
application of the laws you learn during class
time to real life situations but I think the main
thing is that you can have a really positive im
pact on other people," Barnes said. "I do it
because I know that I have an opportunity to
make a difference and I know that the impact
can really change someone's future."
Doing volunteer work is one of the few
ways you can make a real impact on society as
a law student, according to Brady.
"There is so much pro bono work to be
done that you can have an impact even with
very little legal knowledge in the first
semester of your first year," she said.
Second-year law student Emily de Ayoro
said that, although she has not done much pro
bono work yet, such a service is very impor
tant for the legal community.
"You can't have a society without law and
you can't have law without lawyers," she said.
"Lots of people need to participate in the
legal system but have no way to pay for a
lawyer, so its part of our jobs to help out in
that way."

"This is only the Second furl year of the
program, which means that students have not
been urged since their first day of school to
participate," Wand said. "We are pleased to
still have had this high level of participation."
