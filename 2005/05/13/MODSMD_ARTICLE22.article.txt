# Aplia keeps students and professors on the same page
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
Graduate School of Business Prof. Paul Romer said he
was first inspired to create an online teaching tool in the
late 1990s when he realized that his teaching was being in
hibited by the lack of preparation among students and the
mass number of assignments he had to grade. His goal was
to create a system that would keep up with students'
progress and force them to complete the assignments,
without further taxing the professor or teaching assistants.
His idea turned into Aplia (http://www.aplia.com), an
economics Web teaching tool developed to encourage
more effort from students and minimize grading by profes
sors. The goal is to help students get a better understanding
of the material by assigning interactive online homework.
Since the work is graded and distributed by the program,
professors are able to delve further into the material and
spend more time with students rather than grade problem
sets and papers.
"One of our core missions is to help professors become
better educators while also improving students' education
experiences," said Aplia Marketing Manager Jerry Gee.
"We do this by providing high quality content in an easy to
use course management system. Professors adopt the use of
Aplia much like they adopt a particular textbook."
The program consists of a collection of Web-based tools
focused on assigning frequent homework and creating in
teractive activities that can be incorporated into the class
room. Problem sets, news analyses, experiments, tutorials,
reports of students' progress and new digital editions of the
course textbooks are all available online.
Aplia offers interactive tools fora variety of courses, in
cluding introductory economics, macroeconomics and mi
croeconomics. The Aplia program alone costs students $28

per course, while the integrated textbook and Aplia pro
gram combined can run from $ 115 to $ 130, depending on the
textbook selected.
"Aplia gets students more actively engaged by actually
'doing' economics rather than watching someone else do
it," Gee said. "They get to manipulate graphs, participate
in experiments and apply economic principles to today's
news articles."
In order to make sure that students complete all the on
line assignments, the work on Aplia is automatically tracked
and graded â€” and the grades count toward determining stu
dents' success in the course.
"When professors want to use this program, they make
the homework a strong part of the class grade," explained
Romer, who teaches a macroeconomics course at the Busi
ness School. "The students who want to take the class have
to submit their work online."
By having homework as a course requirement, students
would be forced into keeping up with the material rather
than putting it all of to the last minute. This also helps the in
structor who can teach to a class of students who are all on
the same page.
"There were things in my teaching that I just couldn't do
because I couldn't get the tools I wanted and students hadn't
read," Romer said. "I would waste class time practically
reading the book out loud. It was a terrible waste of time, but
because they didn't know the basics, we couldn't really
progress into the more interesting and conceptual issues."
Romer came to refer to this lack of preparation amongst
students as a "death spiral."
"It became a death spiral because since some students
didn't do the reading, I would spend more time explaining
what was in it," Romer said. "This would then bore the stu
dents who did do the reading, and they would stop doing it
and then it just accumulated. Having a lot of required home

work helped us break out of that cycle."
Although the program was first developed at Stanford, it
has now spread to more than 450 colleges around the nation
and is currently being used by more than 50,000 students.
This rapid development has been partly due to the $ 11.2 mil
lion of funding that the company secured from the Skandia
Life Insurance Company in 2002.
"It's amazing to see the change over the past couple of
years," Gee said. "When I first started [at Aplia], I was an
swering questions like, 'Aplia who?' These days the re
sponses are more like 'Oh, I've heard about you from so
and-so. He uses Aplia and can't stop raving about it.' Over
all, the reaction has been extremely positive. We have a high
retention rate of users. Those who use us once stick with us."
However, regardless of his personal affiliation, Romer
feels that the virtues of Aplia are more necessary at schools
without Stanford's educational benefits. Ironically, no pro
fessor at Stanford is currently using the program.
"It is important to realize that a lot of the world is not like
Stanford," Romer said. "We deal with professors [at other
schoolsjwho teach courses with a thousand students and
don't have teaching assistants. In many of those classes pro
fessors have just stopped assigning homework."
According to Romer, there has been a positive reaction
to Aplia from students around the country who have used
the program. While they might grumble about the work
load, in the end they are quick to acknowledge the virtues of
such a program. Romer finds satisfaction in their com
plaints.
"Students do complain sometimes about the work," said
Romer. "But I judge whether we're succeeding by how much
they complain. Usually the best courses of their careers are
the ones that they complain about and that are most chal
lenging. Presenting a challenge to students is the best thing a
professor can do."
