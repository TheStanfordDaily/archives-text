# Students lobby for attention to Darfur

### DIANA SCHOLL DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. —
After seeing the film "Motel
Rwanda," Althea Thomas want
ed to do something to help the sit
uation in Darfur, Sudan.
Thomas, who graduated from
Northwestern University in 1959,
had to complete a volunteering
project for her leadership class
and decided to work with NU stu
dents to form the Darfur Project.
The project is lobbying the
U.S. government to act against
the genocide that has killed
300,000 to 400,000 people in Dar
fur since February 2003. About 2
million refugees have come out
of the Darfur conflict.
"We're just ordinary people
who want to have our voices
heard," said Thomas. "We're not
experts but that's what this effort
is about."
The Darfur Project, a group of
seven NU students, is working
with other campus organizations,
including the African Students
Association and NU Darfur Ac
tion Coalition, to bring aware
ness of the crisis in Darfur.
Through a letter-writing cam
paign, the group will press the
U.S. government to take a
stronger stand.
The NU Darfur Action Coali
tion works mainly with NU stu
dents, but the Darfur Project is
also going to high schools in the
Chicago area to raise awareness
of the conflict.
Monica Bieniewski said the
group is hosting many events,
starting with a letter-writing peti
tion at an A&O Productions
showing of "Hotel Rwanda," so
as many students as possible can
be made aware of Darfur.
"The main idea is to continue
pushing it," said Bieniewski, a
Weinberg sophomore who
helped found the group. "It's not
something you can do just once."
On Tuesday about 30 people
attended "Take a Stand Against

Sudan." co-sponsored by the
African Students Association.
The event brought Sudanese
refugee Gabriel Akoon and Ak
enji Ndumu of Africa Action, a
lobbying group that lobbies for
U.S. policy to help Africa.
Akoon and Ndumu described
the conflict as a religious and eth
nic conflict that has affected all ol
Darfur. Ndumu said former U.S.
Secretary of State Colin Powell
declared Sudan a genocide in
September 2004 but the Bush ad
ministration has since "back
tracked" by not offering any
troops to Sudan. He said the
African Union has given 2.700
"monitoring observation force"
troops, but bringing lasting peace
to Darfur requires non-African
countries to contribute to the
20.000 to 50.000 troops needed.
"This is endemic of how the
world approaches African prob
lems," Ndumu said. "But geno
cide is not an African problem.
It's an international problem that
needs an international re
sponse."
Ndumu said Americans need
to put pressure on their lawmak
ers and noted that the crisis in
Rwanda more than a decade ago
shows the importance of taking
action.
"During Rwanda, we were
watching O.J. and now with Dar
fur we're watching Michael Jack
son," Ndumu said. "When a
genocide occurs, everyone is re
sponsible."
After the speakers finished,
students were asked to sign let
ters and a petition. The Darfur
Project will mail the letters to
congressmen.
Ashley Bryant, a Weinberg
sophomore and a founder of the
Darfur Project, said she doesn't
know if the letter-writing cam
paign will influence politicians'
actions, but she thinks the crisis is
too important to be ignored.
"We can never know if it can
make a difference or not." she
said, "but how can we not try?"
