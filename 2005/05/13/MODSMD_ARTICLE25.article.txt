## Editorial Measure A will provide needed funds to PA schools 
### 
Everyone loves schools, right? Usually,
the answer is a resounding "yes" — unless
there's a price tag attached. Then things
get a little dicier.
Palo Alto voters will face a similar
question when they go to the polls on June
7. If passed. Measure A would provide
$ 1 >.3 million annually to the Palo Alto
School District for six years ("Measure
would renew parcel tax in PA," May 5).
While Palo Alto doesn't resemble any
one's image of a needy school district, it
has, like the rest of California's schools,
been affected by recent budget cuts at the
state level. The district has lost a total of
$4.4 million instate funds over the past
three years, and while the enrollment has
been increasing (594 students in the past
three yenrs), there has not been a corre
sponding increase in funds.
To make matters worse, property taxes
which provide 70 percent of the dis
trict's funding — are capped by state law,
meaning that Palo Alto's schools have
seen little benefit from skyrocketing hous
ing prices.
The school district has been drawing
from its limited reserves to cover current
expenses. Certain extracurricular and aca
demic programs have already been cut.
and if the measure is not passed, school of
ficials say that more cuts will follow, as will
a reduction in the nummber of teachers.
Measure A would provide the money
to alleviate these pressing concerns. Palo

Alto passed a similar tax in 2001, which
school district officials say provided a sta
ble source of funds to support them during
the recent economic downturn, hut this
tax expires next year.
In addition. Measure A targets the
hank accounts of many of the people who
benefit the most from good schools. Hav
ing quality, high-performing schools in the
area isn't just a good investment, it also
pays off with higher property values. So it
makes sense that many of those who will
reap the financial benefits — and who
may have been drawn to Palo Alto by the
lure of a good education for their children
put up the funds to protect their invest
ment.
Hut what does this have to do with
Stanford students? Enveloped in the oft
mentioned bubble, it's easy to ignore local
elections. Who cares what's going on in
local elections, right? Hut Stanford, and its
students, are part of a larger community.
Measure I. an earlier attempt to renew the
parcel tax, fell just 1 percent short of its re
quired two-thirds vote last November.
The new measure reduces the tax from
$521 to per parcel, but the necessary
66.7 percent of support is far from guaran
teed.
Stanford students who are eligible to
vote in the coming election — especially
for those of us who benefited from strong
public education — we have an obligation
to support Palo Alto schools this June 7.
