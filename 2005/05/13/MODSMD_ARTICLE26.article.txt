## Filibustering for the filibuster 
### 
In the spirit of one of Stanford's
most enduring and productive tradi
tions. White Plaza has once again be
come the stage for political demon
stration. Don't worry, though, you
won't find anything controversial
like mock same-sex marriages or
miniature anti-abortion cemeteries.
And while the present display of
youthful involvement is being staged
by a partisan organization — the

Stanford I )emocrats — it should by all means be a bi
partisan endeavor. One of the U.S. Senate's own most
enduring and productive traditions, the filibuster, is in
danger of extinction at the handsof a shortsighted few.
The filibuster, for those long removed from 10th
grade I I S. Gov, is the process by which senators in the
minority camp can prevent an initiative from reaching
a vote by never ending its debate. But the speeches
being delivered don't have to relate to the topic at
hand — at all. Some senators have even been known
to read from the telephone book. After a period of
prolonged frustration, the majority inevitably throws
the topic out the window and moves on. So based on
my description, what about filibusters, other than the
name, is worth saving?
At the very foundation of the argument for pre
serving this institution is its uniqueability to prevent
tyranny of the majority. It has been all too common in
American history — especially in government —
that a simple majority can, without obstacle, impose
its will on all. The filibuster remains one of the only
vehicles by which the minority of the American pop
ulace (which can be quite large, as seen in the past two
elections) can have its voice heard. And even then
only in a last-resort effort to moderate the voice of the
majority.
The reason why the filibuster has been thrust back
into the forefront of the American consciousness (and
the birdcage in White Plaza) is that after nearly two
centuries, the Republican Party is attempting to elim
inate the filibuster for judicial nominees. This newest
push has not been entirely unprovoked, to be fair. The

44 Democrats in the Senate (41 are necessary to insti
tute a filibuster) have blocked the approval of 10 of
Bush's federal court appointees by using or threaten
ing the use of the filibuster. On the other hand, they
have more than 2(M) under George W.
Because of these blockades, which in the context of
history seem strikingly insignificant, the G.O.P. is at
tempting to rid itself of the nuisance of 199 years of
democratic tradition. What these red-state senators
fail to realize, however, is that by taking the easy way
out in the short-run. they will seriously and adversely
affect American politics in the long-run — for
Democrats and inevitably also for Republicans. The
filibuster has historically been an advantageous tool
for the Republicans as much or more than it has been
for Democrats. In fact, the record for filibustering was
set by the quintessential Republican, Strom Thur
mond, at 24 hours and 18 minutes in opposition to the
Civil Rights Act of 1957. Indeed, the senator dehy
drated himself in a steam room prior to taking the
floor so that he could drink without taking bathroom
breaks — and even so an aide was on-call in the closet
with an emergency bucket.
Seriously, however, the political pendulum will
eventually swing back the other way; such has been
American political history. In these liberal years, the
Republicans will be the minority — and it will be quite
clear then who wants the filibuster and who doesn't.
But ultimately, this boils down to a non-partisan
issue. While it goes without saying that the American
people have the final word on who constitutes the ma
jority (though the 44 Democrats in the Senate happen
to represent significantly more votes than do the 55
Republicans), it should also be recognized that it is un
democratic. even tyrannical, to muffle the minority.
This is why the Stanford Dems have been filibus
tering for the filibuster in White Plaza around the
clock for the past couple of days. This is also why Stan
ford Republicans should join them.
