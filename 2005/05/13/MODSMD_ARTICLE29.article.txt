"Love is hard to explain," the Cow
hoy Junkies sang, and the unsung corol
lary is also true: If you think you've ex
plained it, you probably don't under
stand it. To the category of essential but
vexing we could also assign nobility,
grace and honor. The question of
whether the pursuit of these virtues car
ries a deferred benefit animated Mill's
conception of utilitarianism, though
neither he nor anyone since seems to
have found a successful measure for
what is necessarily vague.

Perhaps, to borrow Justice Potter Stewart's assessment
of pornography, you know these virtues when you see
them.
But none of this need act as an excuse for equivocation.
With regard to this university's I lonor Code — available
on the Web site of the Office of Judicial Affairs — a lack
of rigorous thought threatens to obscure what should be
an ethical beacon.
The University must choose a point between two ex
tremes. On the one end, a system of comprehensive proc
uring. citation-checking and no take-home tests would act
most strongly against plagiarism and cheating. On the
other hand, absolute student freedom with no policing and
no prosecution would throw open the door to cheating; the
consequences of such actions would rest only upon stu
dents' consciences.
Whatever the I Jniversity chooses, it must satisfy a set of
agreed-upon principles: that "unpermitted aid" in assign
ments unfairly raises cheaters' grades and that plagiarism
is the height of intellectual dishonesty. (The extent to
which grades have become needlessly competitive is a
deeply disturbing matter for another moment.)
If the goal is the pursuit of these principles, then logic
might dictate that Stanford choose the extreme of com
prehensive proctoring. Instead, the Honor Code charts a
middle course between full policing and no policing. We
students have the freedom of take-home exams and the
freedom from faculty oversight, but we are enjoined to be
our own watchdogs and report the deviancies of our peers.
Stanford thus attempts to reap the benefits of full polic

ing under a system that is nearly free of policing. Full polic
ing might best guarantee the realization of academic in
tegrity. but a semi-policed Honor Code is just as practical
a means to an end and is — as the cultivation of "honor"
an end in itself. That was the delicate balance first
struck in 1921 and then significantly revised in 1997.
Available studies seem to indicate that Stanford's
Honor Code — and public knowledge about it — has
helped to discourage cheating. It is a success at that, at
least. But how much "honor" does our Honor Code actu
ally instill?
I have posed the question incorrectly. Like love and
grace and nobility, "honor" can no more be "instilled"
than it can be explained or measured. We need our ethical
guideposts. our examples and even our teachers. Ulti
mately, though, honor is not so much taught as it is
learned.
But doesn't the existing Honor Code allow us precisely
to learn and adopt honor? Well, not exactly. Section a.2 of
the Honor Code enjoins students to "do their share and
take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor
Code."
Alleged violators are subjected to judicial considera
tion. Though less harsh than those of other universities,
the consequences — academic probation, rights-ceding
and community service among them — seem to approxi
mate the penalties one would suffer if caught cheating by
a proctor. Stanford University's Honor Code, under the
guise of high ethics, remains something of a de facto proc
tor system.
The proctoring may be delayed, it may be diminished in
scale, its vigilance may fall informally and largely on the
hands of students. But while the University disclaims full
policing, it still retains the threat of material punishment.
And if the Honor Code means nothing without the threat
of punishment, then we are talking about coercion or im
position, but not honor per se. And that it is something
that could use an explanation.
