# Baseball to meet weak UCLA team

### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When John Savage took the UCLA head coaching
job this year to replace Gary Adams, who had coached
the Bruins for 30 years, Savage knew it was going to be
an uphill battle in the Pacific-10 Conference. The team
had lost five starting position players and all of its start
ing pitchers. But the Bruins looked like a squad on the
way up: They-finished third in the Pac-10 last year after
successive seventh- and fifth-place finishes. No one,
however, imagined that Savage would have as hard of a
time as he has had this year. As the Bruins (12-33, 1-14)
travel to Sunken Diamond this weekend, they find
themselves near the bottom of the Pac-10, just a notch
ahead of winless Washington State.
The Bruins are coming to town at an opportune time
for the Cardinal (27-18,8-7), who hope to get a breather
after a tough week during which the team dropped three
of four games. The Cardinal will be playing for playoff
position. The Bruins, meanwhile, will be playing for
their pride — but a team that has nothing to lose late in
the season can be dangerous.
The Bruins got off to an 8-4 start at the beginning of

in a row — setting a school
record for futility — and 25 of 26
