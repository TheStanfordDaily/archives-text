# Baseball to meet weak UCLA team
## 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When John Savage took the UCLA head coaching
job this year to replace Gary Adams, who had coached
the Bruins for 30 years, Savage knew it was going to be
an uphill battle in the Pacific-10 Conference. The team
had lost five starting position players and all of its start
ing pitchers. But the Bruins looked like a squad on the
way up: They-finished third in the Pac-10 last year after
successive seventh- and fifth-place finishes. No one,
however, imagined that Savage would have as hard of a
time as he has had this year. As the Bruins (12-33, 1-14)
travel to Sunken Diamond this weekend, they find
themselves near the bottom of the Pac-10, just a notch
ahead of winless Washington State.
The Bruins are coming to town at an opportune time
for the Cardinal (27-18,8-7), who hope to get a breather
after a tough week during which the team dropped three
of four games. The Cardinal will be playing for playoff
position. The Bruins, meanwhile, will be playing for
their pride — but a team that has nothing to lose late in
the season can be dangerous.
The Bruins got off to an 8-4 start at the beginning of

the season, but the team's honey
moon with Savage ended soon
after, as they dropped 19 games
in a row — setting a school
record for futility — and 25 of 26
over two months.
The team came to life on May
1, winning its first conference
game of the year against Califor
nia.
Several of the Bruins' veter
ans are struggling, but the team is
not without its bright spots and
success stories. Redshirt junior
Chris Jensen won the starting job
in rightfield halfway through the
season and has hit .455 with four
homers and 12 RBI since then.
He went 4-for-5 with a long ball
and three RBI against UC-lrvine
on Tuesday.
Junior first baseman Brett
McMillan has hit seven home
runs and driven in 28.
The fact that McMillan, the

team's cleanup hitter, has only 28
RBI indicates how the team has
struggled to put men on base all
season. By comparison, Stanford's
leading RBI man, junior Jed
Lowrie, has 52. Four of the Bruins'
regulars have posted on-hase per
centages below .300.
The UCLA series will begin
the Cardinal's final homestand of
the year, which will also include a
three-game set with Pac-10 leader
Arizona next weekend. The Car
dinal will try to use this weekend
to get themselves back on track
after they dropped two of three to
California last weekend and lost a
12-inning battle against Santa
Clara on Tuesday, marking the
first time since 1980 that the Car
dinal have lost a season series to
their neighbors from the south.
But with games against the
Wildcats and Trojans looming in
the next two weeks, the Cardinal
will have to he careful not to look
past UCI \
Friday's pitching matchup will
pit two streaking hurlers against
each other. Stanford will throw ju
nior Jeff Gilmore, who has given
up only one run in 19 innings since
being named the team's ace on
April 22. Gilmore earned Pac-10
Pitcher of the Week honors for the
first time in his career last week
after going 2-0 and tossing 10
scoreless innings in games against
UC-l)avis and Cal.
Freshman Hector Ambriz, who
has been the one saving grace for
the Bruins this season, will take the
hill for UCLA. Ambriz shut out
Oregon State for seven innings last
Friday. In addition to being the
team's ace, he is also its leading hit
ter with a .333 mark.
On Saturday, junior lefty Mark

shutout innings in his last outing, will
get the start for the Cardinal. The
Bruins will likely throw Bryan Beck,
who is 0-9 this year with a 5.87 ERA.
Brant Rustich will take the
mound for UCLA on Sunday.
Stanford has not announced who
will start Sunday's game. Sopho
more Matt Leva is the likely
choice.
