Advising directors committed to
entrancing program
We would like to thank the editorial
board for recognizing our efforts in under
graduate advising ("Peer academic advising
needs rethinking," May 12). We have indeed
committed ourselves wholeheartedly to en
hancing the program in every possible way.
Peers provide many services to freshmen
that faculty and staff cannot, and we applaud
the time and energy that they devote to the
guidance of the newest students on campus.
At the same time, we continue to work very
hard to recruit committed faculty and staff to
be advisors. We are well aware that no one fac
ulty or staff member knows everything that an
advisee might wish to know. We ourselves arc
in that group that does not know everything.
We nonetheless feel strongly that increased
exposure to faculty and staff in the advising
role is of critical importance to freshmen as
they begin to shape their academic programs.
We urge them to supplement their conversa
tions with their assigned advisors with conver
sations with full-time professional advisors in

the Office of Undergraduate Advising Pro
grams. We have a staff of experienced and
dedicated advisors in the office, and they are
available to all students, Monday to Friday, 8
a.m. to 5 p.m.. ITiey both advise students and
help students to make connections with facul
ty in any of the departments and programs that
might interest them.
()ur aim is to build a harmonious program
in which faculty, staff and peers each play the
role best suited to their expertise and experi
ence. We arc delighted to have received
close to 3(H) applications for the peer mentor
role. We are also in the process of hiring an
associate director of Undergraduate Advis
ing Programs, one of whose major responsi
bilities will be to assist us in shaping the pro
gram and evaluating its effectiveness.

Book columnist 'completely
misses the point'
Daily columnist Seth Shamban complete
ly misses the point of The Stanford Review's
special book review edition ("Caught out
there," May 12). The purpose of most of the
book reviews was to highlight the diversity of
views that constitute conservatism. We ran
reviews covering traditional, libertarian, anti
communist and neoconservative strains of
conservatism so that people across the politi
cal and philosophical spectra might be ex
posed to these ideas.
The Stanford Review is a publication
that strives to serve the entire Stanford
campus so Shamban should not be sur
prised that we have ventured onto his sa
cred territory of "books." Shamban makes
a big fuss about the inclusion of a book re
view of "The Pay Pal Wars" by I'ric Jack
son. Shamban should not be surprised by
this choice, given that Eric Jackson is a for
mer editor in chief of The Stanford Re
view. For alumni who have been following
The Stanford Review since its founding.

the inclusion of his book is particularly rel
evant.
Although "The Pay Pal Wars" book re
view was not primarily included with the in
tention of enlightening readers about con
servative political philosophy, the story of
Pay Pal is rich with political implications.
Part of the humanitarian motivation for Pay-
Pal's creation was to empower oppressed
people around the world to be able to freely
make financial transactions, bypassing the
restrictions of authoritarian regimes. Since
Shaniban seems so interested in getting
more information about Pay Pal, he might as
well read the book.

Peace will come only after 'an end to the
occupation'
I A üba Wolf deserves respect for her com
mitment to peace and reconciliation be
tween Israelis and Palestinians ("Israeli,

Palestinian groups should educate," May
11). The problem is that for Palestinians, the
"nuances" she refers to don't exist. Palesti
nans face instead the brutal realities of mili
tary occupation. Long before the suicide
bombings began, Israel imposed harsh re
strictions in the occupied territories. Pales
tinians needed a permit for every normal ac
tivity and were subject to constant harass
ment and humiliation. Their land was seized,
orchards were uprooted and homes were de
molished to make way for Israeli settle
ments.
I oday, under Israel's policy of collective
punishment, Palestinians live in a giant
prison surrounded by walls and forced to
wait endless hours at checkpoints. Israelis
and Palestinians must find a way to live to
gether if they are to survive, but they can
only do so as equals, not as oppressor and op
pressed. ITie plain truth is that peace and
reconciliation will only come with an end to
the occupation.
