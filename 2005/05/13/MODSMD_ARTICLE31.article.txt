## 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate voted unanimously to create an
undergraduate film studies major through the Art and
Art History Department at its meeting last night.
In the past, film studies has been offered as a minor
through the Communication Department.
"This will be a film and media studies degree," said
Communication Prof. Kristine Samuelson. "While
some studio work will be included, the major will be
based strongly in the liberal arts."
The new major will be similar to programs at Yale
and the University of Chicago, which also house their
film studies majors in their Art and Art History De
partments. The major, which will be offered starting in
the fall, will require 65 units of course work.
The Senate also honored two former faculty mem
bers with Memorial Resolutions. Arthur B.C. Walker,
Jr., professor of physics and applied physics, passed
away in April 2001. Robert A. Horn, professor of

American history, passed away in March 2002. Repre
sentatives outlined the achievements and contribu
tions of both individuals, and the Senate observed a
moment of silence in their honor.
In another order of business. University Provost
John Etchemendy gave his standing report, address
ing requests from community members that Lake La
gunita be filled year-round.
"Lake Lag. when it is full, leaks about 500 gallons
of water per minute," he said.
University officials have decided that it is not eco
nomical or environmentally sound to irrigate the lake,
he said. In the springtime, the University maintains at
least two feet of water so that the tiger salamander
population has breeding grounds. However, no more
water will be diverted from nearby sources in the fu
ture, Etchemendy said.
He also addressed the malfunctioning hands of the
Tower Clock at the intersection of Escondido and La
suen Malls.
