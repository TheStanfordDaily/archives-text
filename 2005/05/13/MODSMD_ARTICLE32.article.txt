(U-WIRE) RADNOR. Pa. — A 19-year
old boy was driving down a road when he was
pulled over for speeding. When the police of fi
cer asked the boy for his license and registra
tion. the officer noticed an additional identifi
cation in the boy's wallet. He confiscated the
II). only to find that it was a fake driver's li
cense. claiming that this bov was of the age of
21.
Now, what used to seem like a small offense
is considered serious, and it is even considered
an act of terrorism. This boy is now facing po
tential prison time.
Tons of underage college students all over
the United States have had fake IDs at some
point or another, mostly to be able to purchase
alcohol and enter bars. However, what stu
dents don't realize is that there are rcpercus
sions for having a fake ID.
According to the U.S. Code, Title IS. Part I,
Chapter 47, a person who knowingly and with
out lawful authority produces an identification
document or a false identification document,
knowingly transfers an identification docu
ment or a false identification document know
ing that such document was stolen or produced
without lawful authority, and knowingly pos
sesses with intent to use unlawfully or transfer
unlawfully five or more identification docu
ments (other than those issued lawfully for the
use of the possessor) or false identification
documents, could potentially serve up to 15
years in prison, if there were no other charges
or crimes involved. The punishment for an of
fense under this could be a fine or imprison
ment.

Since the Sept. 11 tragedy, the government
has become much more strict with those pos
sessing, producing and transferring any kind of
false identification. According to CNN.com,
since state IDs, such as a driver's license or
birth certificate often vary by state or county,
it's almost impossible for service employees to
verify the authenticity.
Chris McGoey, a San Francisco, Calif. -
based security consultant, has worked with nu
merous major retailers on combating identity
theft. He has seen hundreds of falsified IDs,
and while he hasn't seen the ones used by the
alleged September 11 hijackers, he offers some
insight into how they could have been ob
tained. "If you take an L.A. birth certificate to
New York, they're probably not going to have
a clue as to whether it's official or not," says
McGoey, according to CNN.com.
Many college students believe it is very easy
to obtain a fake ID, especially those at close
proximity to a big city. With cities like
Philadelphia and New York, young adults
claim that the process of getting a fake ID is
simple.
A young man by the name of Aaron Gins
berg is a 20-year-old sophomore at New York
University in New York City. Ginsberg has
lived in the city for two years now and claims
that everyone knows where to go and how to
get fake identification. Ginsberg said. "All
there is to do in New York is go to bars and
clubs. Because barely any young people here
drive, they aren't very strict with carding at the
door, because they know they won't be at risk
for trouble with people driving drunk after
wards. It they didn't have these young people
coming to their bars, they wouldn't be making
the same money."
