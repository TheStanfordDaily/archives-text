## Jeff Dorman Sucks! First stop on the farewell tour 
### 
Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, let me
introduce you to the first of the last few
fcolumns by your favorite columnist.
Spencer Porter (what, you thought it would be
Dave Barry?).
That's right, single ladies, though 1 can hear
your hearts break across campus, I am graduating
this year, and with my diploma comes an end to
this column, a three-year tour-de-force of fame
and grandeur. I mean, I don't want to say that this
column is popular, but my T-mobile sidekick just
got hacked for Paris Hilton's phone number. Ex
cept "My T-Mobile Sidekick" is a little man
dressed up as Catherine Zeta-Jones who follows
me around and asks if I'd like more "whenever"
minutes.
In any event, welcome to my swan song, my re
tirement tour and my last chance to receive hate

mail from hairy people and
girlfriends — though thankful
ly, not from hairy girlfriends.
But it's time to stop stalling.
In my last few columns, I want
to leave the knowledge I have
accrued over my years on the
page. I want the freshman in
Lag not to make the same mis
takes I have made. 1 want you
to feel like I have made a posi-

tive difference in your life. See, I'm a good guy at
heart.
So my first stop on this farewell tour? The best
pump-up mix.
Now, those golden oldies among you may re
member a past column in which 1 detailed my all
time best pump-up mix. But I was a sophomore
then, and honestly, anything I wrote back then
should have come with a warning sticker — Dick
Vitale wrote more coherent columns than I did.
Now, before I get to it all, 1 should say that I
have subscribed to a new theory in "pumping up."
A pump-up mix is like my body since soccer sea
son ended — it must build upon itself, growing
larger and larger by the second; it must bulge to gi
gantic proportions. OK, I'm fat.
So in order to right my past wrongs, here it is,
my updated pump-up mix:
No. 1" —"A Change Is Gonna Come" by
Sam Cooke
This simple ballad won't find its way onto
many pump-up mixes, but after Seyi Abolaji
forced it onto the varsity soccer warmup tape, 1
truly appreciated the significance of its anticipa
tory tone. Hauntingly apprehensive of tenuous
race relations years ago, this song translates to the
sports world as well.
No. 2 — "Paint It Black" by The Rolling
Stones
The night before my high school soccer team
won state section, we all watched "Fulll Metal
Jacket." To this day, I'm not sure why a movie
about disorder within order and the terror of war
was a good motivational tool, but we won, and
this song caps the movie off.
No, 3 — "Air Force Ones" by Nelly
It's my ringtone. Sorry.
No. 4 — "Breathe, Stretch, Shake" bv Mase
Now, I'm no theologist, but a rapper turned
minister turned rapper saying "I used to be the
guy [who] stood next to Diddy, crucified for
bringing sex in the city," might do well to avoid
comparisons between him and Jesus.
No, 5 — Higher and Higher" by Jackie Wil
son
This is the ultimate pop song. Listen to Jackie
Wilson's voice and you can feel happiness drip
ping off him. Put some pep in your step!
No. 6 — "Do You Believe In Magic?" by The
Lovin' Spoonful
Yeah, OK, so I like sugary pop songs. Wanna
fight? You're just lucky I resisted putting
Dream's "I Love You Not" up here. Fiona Apple
wasn't far behind. Oh do I love my "Criminal."
No. 7 — "Get Your Walk On" by Xzibit
The first line of this song is: "I can drink a
whole Hennessey fifth. Some call that a problem
but I call it a gift." I call it a great way to hydrate
for the game.
No. 8 — "Head Sprung" by LL Cool J
I have a feeling that this song is like the "Skeet
Skeet" song, where white people like the song,
but it will be a couple months before we find out
what it really means.
No. 9 — "Dream On" by Aerosmith
Classic
No. 10 —"Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob
Dylan
This song is long. It's whiny. It isn't well sung.
But by the end of it, you are rocking out like you
were fighting the man, and oh yes, you're win
ning.
No. 11 — "Chicago Bulls Entrance Music"
Listen to this warmup, and I dare you to not
think that you are Michael Jordan. I can feel the
UNC shorts chafing my thighs, personally.
No. 12 — "Rudy — The Final Game"
I may not be five-foot nothing, and I'm sure as
hell not KM) pounds and nothing, but this song is
the most inspirational song I have ever heard,
even for us "plus size" athletes.
No. 13 — "Runnin' (Dying to Live)" by
Tupac Biggie High-Voiced Little Person
Let's just hope that Lag and Escondido Vil
lage can get along, because this East-West vio
lence must come to an end.
No. 14 — "Shawshank Redemption," 2nd
Theme
This is the song that plays as Andy breaks out
of prison. As I always say. in sports you must ei
ther get busy livin', or get busy crawling through a
sewage pipe.

Spencer Porter, a senior, is really just burned out
from planning Senior Formal at SBC park. Why he
didn't write about his Intramural prowess is beyond
him. E-mail him atporters@stanford.edu.
