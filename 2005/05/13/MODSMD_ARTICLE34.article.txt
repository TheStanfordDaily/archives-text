# Men hit NCAA tourney
## Card meet San Diego 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It's go time for the No. 22 Stanford men's ten
nis team as it heads into the NCAA tournament.
In the first round, the Cardinal (13-10,4-3 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will face No. 39 University of
San Diego on Saturday afternoon in Malibu,
Calif., in a rematch of Stanford's first home dual
match of the season.
"San Diego is a good team, and they have
some talent," head coach John Whitlinger said.
"Even though we beat them 7-0,1 don't want to
take them lightly. We are playing [NCAAs] one
match at a time. Our focus is on San Diego, and
that's it right now. That's all I want the guys to
worry about."
The Cardinal defeated San Diego in early
February with a clean 7-0 sweep of the Toreros
despite a slight struggle in doubles. Toward the
end of the doubles, Stanford was even in two of
the matches and trailing in another. In the end.
the Cardinal won all three of the doubles match
es. with two of them coming in tiebreakers.
Doubles has been an issue for the Cardinal
men this season. While the team boasts the
third-ranked duo in the nation, defending
NCAA doubles champions senior Sam War
burg and junior KC Corkery, the team has had
trouble producing two doubles wins in order to
garner the crucial first point. Stanford, which
has experimented with every doubles combina
tion imaginable, has lost all but one match when
losing the doubles point.
The most recent switch-up was made before
the final match of the regular season against
Santa Clara. Against the Broncos, Warburg
paired up with sophomore Eric McKean and
Corkery teamed up with sophomore James Wan.
while junior Jon Wong and senior Phil Sheng re
mained partners at the final doubles spot.
All three pairs earned wins with the clos
est match finishing at 8-4. The Broncos were
unranked, however, and these pairs could
fare differently against higher-ranked oppo
nents should the team decide to keep these
pairings.
While the Cardinal have three ranked singles
players — top-ranked Warburg. No. 15 Cork
ery and No. 73 Wan — San Diego has two. No.
10 Pierrick Ysern and No. 69 Nicolas Beuque.
