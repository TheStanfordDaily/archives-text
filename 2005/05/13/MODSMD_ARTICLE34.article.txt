# Men hit NCAA tourney
## Card meet San Diego 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It's go time for the No. 22 Stanford men's ten
nis team as it heads into the NCAA tournament.
In the first round, the Cardinal (13-10,4-3 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will face No. 39 University of
San Diego on Saturday afternoon in Malibu,
Calif., in a rematch of Stanford's first home dual
match of the season.
"San Diego is a good team, and they have
some talent," head coach John Whitlinger said.
"Even though we beat them 7-0,1 don't want to
take them lightly. We are playing [NCAAs] one
match at a time. Our focus is on San Diego, and
that's it right now. That's all I want the guys to
worry about."
The Cardinal defeated San Diego in early
February with a clean 7-0 sweep of the Toreros
despite a slight struggle in doubles. Toward the
end of the doubles, Stanford was even in two of
the matches and trailing in another. In the end.
the Cardinal won all three of the doubles match
es. with two of them coming in tiebreakers.
Doubles has been an issue for the Cardinal
men this season. While the team boasts the
third-ranked duo in the nation, defending
NCAA doubles champions senior Sam War
burg and junior KC Corkery, the team has had
trouble producing two doubles wins in order to
garner the crucial first point. Stanford, which
has experimented with every doubles combina
tion imaginable, has lost all but one match when
losing the doubles point.
The most recent switch-up was made before
the final match of the regular season against
Santa Clara. Against the Broncos, Warburg
paired up with sophomore Eric McKean and
Corkery teamed up with sophomore James Wan.
while junior Jon Wong and senior Phil Sheng re
mained partners at the final doubles spot.
All three pairs earned wins with the clos
est match finishing at 8-4. The Broncos were
unranked, however, and these pairs could
fare differently against higher-ranked oppo
nents should the team decide to keep these
pairings.
While the Cardinal have three ranked singles
players — top-ranked Warburg. No. 15 Cork
ery and No. 73 Wan — San Diego has two. No.
10 Pierrick Ysern and No. 69 Nicolas Beuque.

Senior Sam Warburg and the men's tennis squad will face USD, which the team beat 7-0 in February, in the first round of NCAAs.
Championships, San Diego fell to
No. 9 Pepperdine, 4-2. However, the
Toreros earned two singles wins
from the Waves in straight sets, at the
first and fourth singles spots, and
Pepperdine won two singles contests
at the second and fifth singles posi
tions. Two of the remaining singles
matches went to three sets, with Pep
perdine winning at the third singles
position in a third-set tiebreaker.
The final singles match did not finish
but San Diego was leading 6-5 in the
third.
While the Toreros faced the
Waves on April 24, the Cardinal have
not played a match since April 19
when they defeated Santa Clara.
Stanford has used the break from
dual matches to practice and recover.
"I think practice has been going
extremely well," McKean said. "It's
tournament time, and I think we had
a good time off. Now it's time to
crank it up and put it in gear."
Warburg agreed that the break al
lowed his body to relax but he's set to
play now.
"It's been a little while without
matches," Warburg said, "but I've
been itching to play a match and
have some competition. I love to
compete, and I'm ready to go."
Although the team has not com
peted in a dual match, it competed in
the individual Pac-1() tournament
where Warburg won the singles draw

for the second year in a row and also
brought home the doubles title with
Corkery. Just last week, Warburg
was named Pac-10 Singles Player of
the Year, and he and Corkery were
named the Pac-10 Doubles Team of
the Year. Warburg also garnered the
West Region ITA /Ted Farnsworth
Senior Player of the Year honor ear
lier this week.
"He's had another incredible year
as the number one player,"
Whitlinger said. "He's done about
everything we could have asked him
to and it's an honor that's well de
served."
While Warburg said he is pleased
with his individual achievements, the
senior captain said that it's team
time.
"We can do it,"he said. "We just
have to play well. If everyone comes
to play, and everyone's fired up and
ready to go, then there's no reason
why we can't win."
That said, Stanford's match on
Saturday against USD will be a
good one. Pepperdine and UC-
Irvine will play first, followed by the
Cardinal and Toreros. The winners
of both matches will face each other
in the round of 32, and then the win
ner of that round will travel to Col
lege Station, Texas, for the rest of
the tournament.
"We cannot [look ahead] in this
tournament," McKean said. "We
have to survive every round and
advance. You have to look at every
round as a very important match.
We're definitely focused on San
Diego first, and then hopefully
Pepperdine."
