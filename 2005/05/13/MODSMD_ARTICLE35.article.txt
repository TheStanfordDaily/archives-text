# Lightweight crew sends off four seniors
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Three years ago, the Stanford lightweight
rowing program gained official status as a varsi
ty sport. But the distinction does not guarantee
success — and the program's athletes experi
enced that truth firsthand.
In their first three seasons, the Stanford
women struggled to develop both the skills and
roster depth needed to compete against the es
tablished programs on the East Coast.
But recently, the lightweights have begun to

see the results of this struggle. They have been
celebrating their program's fourth year of exis
tence in style and have defined themselves as a
force to be reckoned with in the collegiate row
ing world.
It started with a promising first-place finish
at the Newport Rowing Festival in their final
race of the fall season. After a tireless and ded
icated offseason training effort, the Cardinal re
turned to win the A.W. Coggeshall Cup at the
San Diego Crew Classic and followed that ef
fort a week later with a strong performance at
the Windermere Classic.

But without the leadership, energy and in
spiration provided by seniors Krishna Peter
son. Cadv Kintner. Michelle Ramirez and Kate
Vieh, it is likely that the lightweight squad
wouldn't be celebrating much at all this season.
In just a few weeks, all four will move on
from the Farm as the lightweight team's first
graduating class.
Peterson and Kintner are the only two
members of the lightweight squad who have
rowed each of the last four years; they are often
looked up to as •"the backbone of the team," ac
cording to Vieh.

Kintner came to Stanford from Waterbury,
Vt.. where she starred as both a distance runner
and cross-country skier. Kintner. who head
coach A1 Acosta describes as "an endurance
athlete from the middle of nowhere," initially
envisioned herself trying out for Stanford's
cross-country team. She changed her mind
after considering the experience she would
likely have as an un-recruited runner.
"I really wanted to be a part of a team where
I could make a difference, instead of just being
a walk-on trying to keep up," Kintner said.
She ultimately found that opportunity with
the crew team, which also allowed her to take
advantage of her endurance conditioning.
Peterson, meanwhile, arrived on campus
with several years of high school rowing and
swimming experience. Her decision to attend
Stanford effectively ended her career as a
swimmer, and Peterson was left without an out
let for her competitive energy. She turned to
crew, hut within a month managed to commit
one of the few mortal sins in the rowing religion
— she overslept for her first 6 a.m. practice.
Peterson might have dropped the sport, had
it not been for the gentle manner in which
Acosta handled the situation.
"I was actually really scared [after missing

practice], but A1 just said, 'On the first day of
the carnival, not all the rides work,'" Peterson
said.
Peterson hasn't missed a morning practice
since.
Not surprisingly, it was the issue of morning
practices that initially kept Ramirez, and Vieh
from joining the team during their freshman
years. But after a year of living with a member
of the open weight team, Ramirez decided to
experience the lifestyle of a rower for herself.
As a result, the lightweight team gained a valu
able member who was voted "Most Inspira
tional Rower" last season.
"[Rowing] has been a challenge, but a real
ly good motivating challenge," Ramirez said.
"You just want to keep getting better and
there's always an opportunity to reach for."
For Ramirez this year, that opportunity has
been to row in the open weight women's four
seat boat. Competing with the open weight
squad at this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference
championships, Ramirez hopes to help bring a

bid to NCAAs back to the Farm.
Vieh was the last to pick up the sport, join
ing the team late in her sophomore year. Ad
mittedly. she failed to lit the crew personality
stereotype.
"I'd played sports in high school, but I defi
nitely wasn't the endurance type, as was
painfully apparent when I first started." Vieh
said. "And I was definitely not a 5 a.m. riser."
Nevertheless, the example Vieh sets in
working to make herself a better rower is an ex
ample beneficial to the entire team. Acosta
echoed a similar sentiment in comparing the
approach Kintner and Vieh take to their daily
training.
"As an endurance athlete, Cady has this per
sonality where she'll put in the work and never
complain," Acosta said. "But at the same time
there's someone like Kate Vieh who's not an
endurance athlete and will just try as hard as she
can."
Kintner had nothing but praise for the man
ner in which Ramirez and Vieh approach the

challenge of self-improvement day in and day
out.
"I think they exemplify the spirit behind
crew, and I think these two show [what you can
do] if you have the right attitude and the right
sort of energy," she said.
As different as they may be as individuals,
all four fulfill their leadership roles on the squad
with admirable work ethics and a passion loi
perfection. That passion has clearly had a con
tagious effect in the transformation that the
lightweight squad has undergone in the last
three years.
"They've been really good leaders, and that
has really come out in the consistency of their
performances," Acosta said. "They've won
some races and lost some races, but they always
rebound from [both) with consistent perfor
mances.'l "hat's something wc haven't seen ;i lot
in our first seasons."
But the effect of the senior core's stabilizing
presence has extended far beyond technique
and emotional consistency it lias also inllu

enced the squad's ability to remain competitive
regardless of roster additions and losses.
"After our freshman year only four of us
came back, and it was a big deal." Kintner said.
But each year that we go on. there's a tradition
established by the team about what our work
ethic is going to be and what we want to do dur
ing the season. ()ne person not coming back
unexpectedly isn't going to break us at this
p< >int."
Ramirez noted that the precision of the
squad's practices and the manner in which
the team's novice rowers approach their
work has reached new heights. The quality of
that approach reflects on the team's attitude,
which ultimately reflects back on the team's
leaders.
As they approach the final races of their col
legiate careers, the four senior members of the
lightweight squad would love to make one last
contribution to Stanford crew, a goal that they
helped put within reach - a victory at national
championships.

performances," Acosta said. "They've won
some races and lost some races, but they always
rebound from [both) with consistent perfor

"After our freshman year only four of us
came back, and it was a big deal." Kintner said.

Ramirez noted that the precision of the
squad's practices and the manner in which
the team's novice rowers approach their
work has reached new heights. The quality of
that approach reflects on the team's attitude,
which ultimately reflects back on the team's
leaders.
As they approach the final races of their col
legiate careers, the four senior members of the
lightweight squad would love to make one last
contribution to Stanford crew, a goal that they
helped put within reach - a victory at national
championships.
Three years ago, the Stanford lightweight
rowing program gained official status as a varsi
ty sport. But the distinction does not guarantee
success — and the program's athletes experi
enced that truth firsthand.
In their first three seasons, the Stanford
women struggled to develop both the skills and
roster depth needed to compete against the es
tablished programs on the East Coast.
But recently, the lightweights have begun to

see the results of this struggle. They have been
celebrating their program's fourth year of exis
tence in style and have defined themselves as a
force to be reckoned with in the collegiate row
ing world.
It started with a promising first-place finish
at the Newport Rowing Festival in their final
race of the fall season. After a tireless and ded
icated offseason training effort, the Cardinal re
turned to win the A.W. Coggeshall Cup at the
San Diego Crew Classic and followed that ef
fort a week later with a strong performance at
the Windermere Classic.

But without the leadership, energy and in
spiration provided by seniors Krishna Peter
son. Cadv Kintner. Michelle Ramirez and Kate
Vieh, it is likely that the lightweight squad
wouldn't be celebrating much at all this season.
In just a few weeks, all four will move on
from the Farm as the lightweight team's first
graduating class.
Peterson and Kintner are the only two
members of the lightweight squad who have
rowed each of the last four years; they are often
looked up to as •"the backbone of the team," ac
cording to Vieh.

Kintner came to Stanford from Waterbury,
Vt.. where she starred as both a distance runner
and cross-country skier. Kintner. who head
coach A1 Acosta describes as "an endurance
athlete from the middle of nowhere," initially
envisioned herself trying out for Stanford's
cross-country team. She changed her mind
after considering the experience she would
likely have as an un-recruited runner.
"I really wanted to be a part of a team where
I could make a difference, instead of just being
a walk-on trying to keep up," Kintner said.
She ultimately found that opportunity with
the crew team, which also allowed her to take
advantage of her endurance conditioning.
Peterson, meanwhile, arrived on campus
with several years of high school rowing and
swimming experience. Her decision to attend
Stanford effectively ended her career as a
swimmer, and Peterson was left without an out
let for her competitive energy. She turned to
crew, hut within a month managed to commit
one of the few mortal sins in the rowing religion
— she overslept for her first 6 a.m. practice.
Peterson might have dropped the sport, had
it not been for the gentle manner in which
Acosta handled the situation.
"I was actually really scared [after missing

practice], but A1 just said, 'On the first day of
the carnival, not all the rides work,'" Peterson
said.
Peterson hasn't missed a morning practice
since.
Not surprisingly, it was the issue of morning
practices that initially kept Ramirez, and Vieh
from joining the team during their freshman
years. But after a year of living with a member
of the open weight team, Ramirez decided to
experience the lifestyle of a rower for herself.
As a result, the lightweight team gained a valu
able member who was voted "Most Inspira
tional Rower" last season.
"[Rowing] has been a challenge, but a real
ly good motivating challenge," Ramirez said.
"You just want to keep getting better and
there's always an opportunity to reach for."
For Ramirez this year, that opportunity has
been to row in the open weight women's four
seat boat. Competing with the open weight
squad at this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference
championships, Ramirez hopes to help bring a

bid to NCAAs back to the Farm.
Vieh was the last to pick up the sport, join
ing the team late in her sophomore year. Ad
mittedly. she failed to lit the crew personality
stereotype.
"I'd played sports in high school, but I defi
nitely wasn't the endurance type, as was
painfully apparent when I first started." Vieh
said. "And I was definitely not a 5 a.m. riser."
Nevertheless, the example Vieh sets in
working to make herself a better rower is an ex
ample beneficial to the entire team. Acosta
echoed a similar sentiment in comparing the
approach Kintner and Vieh take to their daily
training.
"As an endurance athlete, Cady has this per
sonality where she'll put in the work and never
complain," Acosta said. "But at the same time
there's someone like Kate Vieh who's not an
endurance athlete and will just try as hard as she
can."
Kintner had nothing but praise for the man
ner in which Ramirez and Vieh approach the

challenge of self-improvement day in and day
out.
"I think they exemplify the spirit behind
crew, and I think these two show [what you can
do] if you have the right attitude and the right
sort of energy," she said.
As different as they may be as individuals,
all four fulfill their leadership roles on the squad
with admirable work ethics and a passion loi
perfection. That passion has clearly had a con
tagious effect in the transformation that the
lightweight squad has undergone in the last
three years.
"They've been really good leaders, and that
has really come out in the consistency of their
performances," Acosta said. "They've won
some races and lost some races, but they always
rebound from [both) with consistent perfor
mances.'l "hat's something wc haven't seen ;i lot
