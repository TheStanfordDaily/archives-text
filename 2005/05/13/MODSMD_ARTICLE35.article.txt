# Lightweight crew sends off four seniors

cording to Vieh.

Kintner came to Stanford from Waterbury,
Vt.. where she starred as both a distance runner

coach A1 Acosta describes as "an endurance
athlete from the middle of nowhere," initially
envisioned herself trying out for Stanford's
cross-country team. She changed her mind
after considering the experience she would
likely have as an un-recruited runner.
