Senior Sara Bei knows what it is like to over
come adversity. She has found what she needs,
though, to carry herself through four intense years
of cross-country and track and field.
"I just kept reminding myself that God has
given me this gift and I owe it to Him to glorify
Him and use my gift to the best of my ability," Bei
said.

The distance runner
from Santa Rosa, Calif., has
seen highs and lows during
her career at Stanford, and
has maintained an attitude
of humility and gratitude
throughout.
"Running is a very con

don't really like how self-

centered it is. But if I am doing it for Him, if I am
doing things for the right reason, ultimately it
gives these things meaning."
As a sophomore, Bei suffered an injury to her
knee during indoor track and field, hut her biggest
challenge came last fall, when an injury to her
back took her out of the cross-country season.
Running was out of the question for Bei, who
trained on a bike instead.
"Having to do things 1 do not enjoy, like biking,
was really difficult." Bei said. "My injuries made
me think twice about running after college. But

and could have finished first in the 3,000-meter
run if she had not been tripped from behind.
"It was really surprising how fast I came back
into things," Bei said. "I got tripped in the 3,000,
but it would have gone pretty well if I had not."
Bei has been running since she was in seventh
grade and is the first person to have won four in
dividual California state high school cross-coun-

try titles. She was a three
time state champion in both
the mile and two mile, and
won the Footlocker Nation

senior in high school. Like
many young runners. Bei
quit her first love, soccer, to
pursue running.
"My primary motiva
tion is that God has given

me this gift to run, and I want to pursue this gift the
best I can," Bei said.
Bei considers her best accomplishments to be
last year's NCAA cross-country championships
and her performance at the Olympic trials last
summer. At the NCAAs Bei finished third over
all. helping the Cardinal to the team title. At the
U.S. Olympic Trials in July. Bei finished 11th
overall in the prelims of the 5,000-meter run, ad
vancing her to the finals where she ran a career
best 15:36.21.
"Cross-country nationals last year were a big
step for me because I had not performed very well
for the past two years," Bei said. "So that was very
exciting for me. Olympic Trials last year was also

so hard, but I kept through and finished well. I was
