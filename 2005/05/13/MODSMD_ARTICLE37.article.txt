# Crew heads to Championships
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
When the middle of May rolls around,
crews across the nation know that it's time
to drop the hammer. After countless hours
on the erg, in the weight room and out on
the water, the fate of a team's season comes
down to its ability to execute perfectly for
six minutes of pure intensity. And when the
Pacific-10 Conference championships begin
Sunday morning in Sacramento, Calif.,
members of the No. 5 men's team and the
No. 9 women's team say they will be up to
the challenge.
The Stanford women enter the weekend's
competition coming off a strong perfor
mance two weeks ago against No. 2 Califor
nia. Racing on their home course at Red
wood Shores, both Stanford varsity eights
managed to take seats against their opponent
before ultimately falling behind over the re
mainder of the race. But even in their defeats,
the Cardinal managed to achieve something
no other crews have managed to do this sea
son — build a lead over the Bears.
"Our race against Cal was encouraging in
terms of how far we had come over the
course of the season, and it served as great
fuel for our last two weeks of training before
Pac-lOs," said junior Alexis Peterson, who
rowed in the second varsity boat. "We were
ahead of Cal for the first 500 meters of the
race [and that] means we're capable of

hanging with any boat at Pac-lOs."
As promising as the performances of the
Cardinal's boats were, they were far from
perfect. In response, the Stanford women
devoted their last two weeks of training to
building up their ability to execute a com
plete race.
"We've been working on our speed and
composure and making sure that we have
both at all times," Peterson said. "Our
[training] pieces have focused on recreating
the toughest parts of race situations and
proving to ourselves that we can perform to
a very high standard in those situations."
At stake this weekend for the Cardinal is
a bid to NCAAs two weeks from now. The
Pac-10 races will be the last opportunity for
the Stanford women to prove themselves
deserving of one of the three NCAA bids
typically awarded to west region schools.
"There are a lot of strong schools fighting
fora bid, and while performance during the
whole season plays a role, performance at
Pac-lOs is a crucial factor," senior Sam
Magee said.
Despite the pressure of the Cardinal's
situation, the weekend puts them in a posi
tion long-awaited by every member of the
team.
"We're excited to race and are looking
forward to seeing all of our Pac-10 competi
tors on the line this Sunday," senior captain
Missy Fiesler said. "We'll finally get the
chance to prove our speed and take advan-

tage of all the hard work we've put in all
year."
The Stanford men also competed against
California two weeks ago, hut unlike the
women, they were unable to execute races
up to their standards. Nevertheless, the Car
dinal have potential fora dominating per
formance at Pac-l()s.
'We're very confident in our ability to
race," junior Jake Cornelius said. ' We think
we have a better shot than our opponents
give us credit for, which is to our advantage.
It's critical that we execute the way we know
we can without getting distracted by what
the other crews are doing."
Key to an effective performance for the
men in Sacramento will be a stronger push
between the starting and finishing moves.
"Our races so far this year have shown us
that it will take more tenacity than we have
exhibited thus far in the middle thousand
meters," Cornelius said.
That tenacity is one the Cardinal are con
fident they can dig deep to find. And in the
eyes of junior Jeremy Barton, who will be
unable to race this weekend due to a broken
wrist, that tenacity combined with the Car
dinal's power and technique will mean a dif
ficult challenge for the rest of the Pac-1().
"We've practiced hard and both boats re
sponded well, showing some newfound
drive and speed." he said. "We're ready to
go. It's the postseason —we've trained all
year for this, and its time to step it up."
