It is the last weekend of
softball in the nation's tough
est conference, and it is shap
ing up to be a good one: Four
teams, all in the top six na
tionally, have a legitimate
shot at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title.
Helped by a win over Ari
zona State last night and an
upset of conference leader
No. 6 Oregon State by No. 21
Washington. No. 4 Stanford
sits in a tie with OSU for first
place in the Pac-10 â€” and the
Cardinal has two games
against No. 3 Arizona still to
come. No. 2 California is also
in the running for the regular
season title.
To claim at least a share of
the program's first conference
