It is the last weekend of
softball in the nation's tough
est conference, and it is shap
ing up to be a good one: Four
teams, all in the top six na
tionally, have a legitimate
shot at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title.

sits in a tie with OSU for first
place in the Pac-10 — and the
Cardinal has two games
against No. 3 Arizona still to
come. No. 2 California is also
in the running for the regular
season title.
To claim at least a share of
the program's first conference


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Four teams in the Pac-10 will vie this weekend fora share of the conference crown. The Cardinal are tied with Ore
gon State for the lead after last night's games.
title ever, the Cardinal will likely
need to sweep the Wildcats. The
two last faced each other in the con
ference season opener, a 4-2 Ari
zona victory in Tucson.
"We try to downplay it and take
it one day at a time," head coach
John Rittman said of the potential
title. "It's something that we have
talked about, but it's not going to
change the way we play our game.
We know that we need to bring our
A game."
With a loss to Cal last night, the
Wildcats fell two games behind the
Pac-10 leaders, likely taking them
out of contention for the conference
title. OSU has a chance to reclaim its
lead with a two-game series against
UCLA. California, currently only a
game behind Stanford, will be host
ing ASU in a two-game series this
weekend.
The Cardinal's second-place
Pac-10 finish last season was the
highest conference finish in the his
tory of the program. There is work
to be done before the conference
season ends, however. The Wildcats
lost to UCLA last weekend, but
then swept a three-game series with
Washington to stay with the confer
ence leaders. They lost a close game
to Cal yesterday, with the only run
coming in the bottom of the sev
enth.
Kristie Fox is responsible for the
bulk of the Wildcats' offense with 63
RBI this season and a team-leading
nine homeruns — roughly a third of
Arizona's total scoring. Jackie
Coburn has also been a major scor
ing threat with 36 RBI and eight
homers. Caitlin Lowe is the most
consistent hitter on the roster, hit
ting a whopping .509 overall. She
was recently named to the 10-per
son shortlist for USA Softball Play
er of the Year honors.
Wildcat ace Alicia Hollowell
(26-7) has gotten the majority of
starts this season and boasts a 1.10
ERA and 369 strikeouts in only 217
innings. Both Hollowell and Lowe
were invited to the USA National
Team Selection Camp in June,
where they will see Stanford's ju
nior shortstop Lauren Lappin and
alumna Jessica Mendoza.
When Arizona and Stanford last
faced off in early April, Lowe hit 3-
for-3 with three runs scored to lead
the Wildcats. Hollowell got the win
in the circle and Stanford freshman
Becky McCullough (18-4) took the
loss, her first of the season. Since
then, she has won 10 games and lost
three. The Cardinal has posted a 15-

6 record since that loss, while Ari
zona has gone 10-7 in the same time.
[ "They are a very good team,"
Rittman said of the Wildcats. "The
key will be to keep their speed off
the bases and also good pitch selec
tion against Hollowell,"
The Cardinal got the weekend
off to a good start last night, with a
solid 3-0 win over ASU for their
40th win of the season. This is the
squad's eighth consecutive 40-win
season.
Stanford did all its scoring in a
flurry in the bottom of the second
when senior rightfielder Meghan
Sickler brought home pinch runner
Shoney Hixson. Later in the inning,
junior Catalina Morris sent the ball
deep to centerfield fora two-RBI
double, giving the Cardinal a 3-0 ad
vantage after two innings.
"We got lucky that they made
some mistakes in that one inning,"
Rittman said. "And then Cat Morris
came up with a big hit when we
needed it."
McCullough's sharp play kept
the game scoreless in the fourth.
With the bases loaded and only one
out, she got a ball bouncing into the
circle and tossed it to catcher Leah
Nelson for the force out at home.
Nelson whipped the ball to fresh
man first baseman Erin Howe to
complete the double play.
McCullough pitched a complete
game shutout for the Cardinal, with
five strikeouts and only one walk.
ASU's Burkhart (10-13) took the
loss, with six strikeouts, a walk and
one earned run.
Morris led the Cardinal batters,
continuing her hot streak from last
week, with a two-RBI double on 1-
for-3 hitting. Sickler also had an
RBI and scored a run, hitting 1-for
2, and Lappin recorded the only
other hit for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal will take on Ari
zona today at 7 p.m. and then close
the season Saturday at 1 p.m. A trib
ute to the six graduating seniors will
take place before Saturday's game.
On Sunday afternoon, the team
will be watching ESPN's selection
show to find out where it will be play
ing when the NCAA Tournament
begins next week. Regional competi
tion will be followed by Super Re
gional over Memorial Day week
end, with the Women's College
World Series being played in Okla
homa City June 2 to 8. Last year was
the second time in history that Stan
ford went to the World Series, finish
ing in a tie for third.
"It's always hard to predict the se
lection show because there is so
much parity in softball," Rittman
said. "It would be nice to be able to
host, but this is a team that has
played very well on the road. Really,
we just want a fair draw."
