### 
WASHINGTON, DC.,
(Reuters) — A life-like prosthet
ic penis called the Whizzinator
and other products promising to

help illegal drug users pass
urine tests provoked U.S.
lawmakers on Wednesday
to take legal action with sub
poenas of manufacturers.
lawmakers objected to
attempts to circumvent
drug tests with products
such as The Whizzinator, a
fake penis that can provide
a How of clean urine "again
and again, anytime, any
where you need it!" accord
ing to the Web site,
www.whizzinator.com.
A congressional sub
committee voted to sub
poena the owner of Puck
Technology of Signal Hill,
California, the company
that makes the Whizzina-

tor. The panel also voted to sub
poena the owners of Health
Choice of New York City and
Spectrum Labs of Cincinnati,
two companies that lawmakers
said also were suspected of sell
ing products aimed at circum
venting workplace drug tests.
ITie owners were required to
provide financial and operational
records by Monday and to ap
pear at a congressional hearing
on Tuesday.
"These companies seek

through deception to make a
buck hy violating our trust and
compromising our security," said
Rep. F.d Whitfield, a Kentucky
Republican who chairs the
House Energy and Commerce
Committee's oversight and in
vestigations panel.
"It is a risk we simply cannot
tolerate. This panel will uncover
how widespread these products
are and recommend the neces
sary steps to end their use," Whit-

field said in a statement.
Actor Tom Sizeniore, who
played a sergeant in the war
movie "Saving Private Ryan."
was caught using the Whizzinator
to try and pass drug tests, Califor
nia prosecutors said in February.
He was put in jail after using a
similar device and failing a drug
test, prosecutors said.
Drinks to flush drugs
The House committee is inves

tigating whether federal legisla
tion is needed to stop companies
from making similar products,
such as drinks that promise to
Hush out drug ingredients in urine.
The company officials had
previously declined to testify and
provided little information, a
committee statement said.
Michael Fichera, owner of
Health Choice, said he had told
the committee he would cooper
ate with the investigation.

"I don't think there's
anything wrong with the
products we're selling,"
Fichera said in an inter
view. "We do a service. 1
think it's way more posi
tive than negative."
He said users of his
company's products,
which include drinks and
capsules, must be "clean"
for two to three days be
fore using them to pass a
drug test.
"We're not beating or
cheating on ding tests. We
are just accelerating the
cleansing time." Fichera said.
An official at Spectrum
Labs did not immediately
res|xind to a request for

comment about the congressional
action. A man who answered the
phone at Puck Technology said no
one was available to comment.


Don't worry, that's not a real penis. It's the Whizzinator
available in shades of white, tan, Latino, brown and black.
Hot.
