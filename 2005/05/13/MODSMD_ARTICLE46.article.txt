## 
### TIM LIPUS ASSHOLE 
Wednesday, Intermission once again
engaged the services of Tim Lipus, Ass
hole. You'd think we would have learned
our lesson by now.
TimLipus, Asshole, started his evening
by approaching a Mysterious South Amer
ican Girl.
TL,A: Hoi a!
MSAG: OK, enough, get this guy away
from me.
TL,A: Can I quote you for the paper?
MSAG: Get the fuck out of here.
TL,A : You're right. You and me should get
out of here.
MSAG: [Leaves]
It was an excellent interview. But the night
was just beginning forTim Lipus, Asshole,
who wanted to find out what Stan ford stu
dents thought about golf The next person
willing to talk to him (for reasons still un
clear) was a Mysterious But Probably Not
South American Ciuy.
TL,A: When was the last time you went
golfing?
MBPNSAG: A couple of weeks ago.
TL,A: Where did you go?
MBPNSAG: The Stanford Golf Course.
TL,A: Do they allow women and black
people to play there?
MBPNSAG: I don't really know.
So why do you think a lot of golf cours
es don't allow women and black people.
MBPNSAG: I guess they just want to be
racist.
TL,A: So why don't you like black people?
MBPNSAG: I'm not answering that. I'll
give you a comment off the record.
TL,A: That's fine. Let me just record this
so that I can remember what your off-the
record comment was.
MBPNSAG: I'm not answering that ques
tion, OK? I don't hate black people.
TL,A: You hate black people?
MBPNSAG: I'm half black.
TL,A: Really? Me too.
Tim Lipus, Asshole, is not half black. He

also has no problem with being an Asshole.
He soon walked past a dorm room with a
golf bag inthe corner and decided to talk to
its owner.
TL, A: I see you have some golf clubs in
your room here.
(Juy With Hippie Hair: Yes.
TL,A: The golf course you go to — why
doesn't it allow women?
GWHH: The truth is —
TL,A: Because you are a racist?
GWHH: I didn't say that. 1 feel like you put
words in my mouth. The truth is — hold on.
[Interrupts interview to pour cup of beer
fromgiant plastic tub] The truth is, I'm not
a racist per se. I just don't like Ethiopians.
[Pause]
TL,A: Wow. I don't even know how to an
swer that.
Tim Lipus, Asshole, soon spotted a Girl
in a lilue Sweatshirt and decided to investi
gate her views on the subject at hand.
TL,A: Do you golf?
GBS: No.
TL,A: That's good, actually. I'm looking for
an outsider's perspective. Why do you think
that all golfers ... don't like Ethiopians.
(IBS: I 've never heard that.
TL,A: It's a common stereotype, actually,
that golfers don't like Ethiopians.
GBS: Do you have to be a golfer to know
that stereotype?
TL,A: 1 don't know, I'm not a golfer.
GBS: I 've never heard that.
TL,A: So what you're saying is, you don't
like Ethiopians either? Is that true?
GBS: No
TL,A: You don't like them?
GBS: I guess it's because I play golf.
TL,A: Oh so first you don't play golf, and
now you do. Changing your story to cover
up your own racism. I am shocked and
appalled.
GBS: Are we done here?
TL,A: Can I have your phone number?
Needless to say, Tim Lipns, Asshole,
could not have her phone number. Think
you can figure out why? Direct your
thoughts to tlipus@stanford.edu
