## â€˜Kingdom' falls short of higher purpose 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
After a green lighting process for his Cru
sades-era epic "Kingdom of Heaven" that
must have required a Higher Power, director
Ridley Scott likely then wrestled with an even
greater challenge: In an era of ongoing military
conflict between the West an the Arab world,
how should one approach a story about Euro-

pean Christians invading the Holy
Land and slaughtering Muslims?
The film could have touched
upon some universal truisms
about the complex nature of reli
gious conflict or at least been
thought-provoking. Unfortunate
ly, the director's attempt to as
suage the inherent political incor
rectness of the movie's premise re-

sults in an effort that, although beautifully shot
and well acted, lacks the subtlety such an ambi
tious project deserves.
To elucidate the point that religious fanati
cism of any stripe is abhorrent, "Kingdom of
Heaven" takes the easy way out by simply cre
ating two archetypes in its characters. There
are the seculars with shining moral compasses,
and then there are fanatics who sneer a lot and
say, "God wills it!" at roughly 30-second inter
vals to justify their maniacal ways.

'Kingdom of/|4agaH
Heaven'
Dir. Ridley Scott vH

The hero of the story, French blacksmith
Balian (a buffed-up Orlando Bloom) is clearly
a member of the former group. A family
tragedy has caused Balian to lose his faith in
God. The sudden appearance of the knight
Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), who reveals
himself as Balian's father, along with the fact
that the law is on his heels, encourages Balian
to switch professions and join the Crusades.
Before parting ways, Godfrey legitimates

and knights his heretofore
bastard son, giving him the
ear of the dying Christian
king of Jerusalem (Edward
Norton) once he reaches the
Holy City. As the health of
this benevolent ruler falters,
the tenuous peace between
the Christians and Saladin,
the king of the Muslims, is

about to be put to the test by rival factions with
in the Christian camp - the pacifists led by
Balian and the king's advisor, Tiberias (Jeremy
Irons), and the unmitigated evil of the war
mongers headed by Guy de Lusignan (Marton
Csokas). Lusignan is the heir to the throne by
nature of being married to the king's sister,
who - following standard movie logic - is having
an affair with Balian.
As blood begins to spill, the film's contempt
for religious fanaticism becomes pronounced

to the point of distrac
tion. Lusignan (who can
be identified as malevo
lent by dint of his
French accent) fights
Muslims for wealth and
power in the name of
God, whereas the faith
less Balian, like the "in
fidel" Saladin, is more
Christian than any of
the Christians, just
wanting to keep
Jerusalemites alive.
"I would rather live
with them than kill
them," he proclaims, re
ferring to the Muslims.
Why can't we all get
along, indeed.

Moral complexity is
something "Kingdom of Heaven" avoids like
leprosy, replacing characters with any sort of
inner strife with those who simply represent
points along a one-dimensional line from malev
olent fanatic to moralistic secular. Yet this cer
tainly doesn't take away the fun of the battle
scenes; this movie is from the man who made
"Gladiator" after all. The violence is depicted
with a seriousness and an attention to detail that
are really quite astounding.

It's a pity, however,
that the same effort
wasn't placed on the
film's parting refer
ences to today's Israeli-
Palestinian conflict,
which, from Ridley
Scott's point of view, is
a historical conflict with
no new contested issues
since the Middle Ages -
border wall and suicide
bombers be damned!
Perhaps the organizers
of Israel Pride Week
and Palestinian Aware
ness month could tell
Scott a thing or two.
Nonetheless,
"Kingdom of Heaven"

is a well-crafted, pro
fessional epic, able to sustain its tone and in
tensity throughout. But it could have been
more. With today's political climate, this film
had an opportunity to say something profound
- or at least interesting - about geopolitics or the
nature of religious wars or really anything at all.
With caricatures instead of characters, being a
solid but unimportant epic is all "Kingdom of
Heaven" could accomplish, despite its ambi
tions.




He's sad. Not anti-Semitic.
