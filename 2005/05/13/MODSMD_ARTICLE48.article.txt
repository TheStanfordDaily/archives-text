# Jaume Serra's ‘House of Wax’a house of camp
## 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION MOVIEGOER 
Ah... camp. Dictionary.com de
fines "camp" as "banality, vulgarity,
or artificiality when deliberately af
fected or when appreciated for its
humor." Whatever that means. Just
replace that ostentatious definition
with "House of Wax," the new pro
foundly silly horror movie / laugh-

at-Paris-Hilton-fest,

and you've got a

much more

tangible

idea of

what "camp" is all about.
"House of Wax," directed by
Jaume Serra, is a "re-imaging" of what
I'm sure was an equally campy 3D film
from 1953. 'Thankfully, the new ver
sion doesn't bother to take itself seri
ously. It does, however, take very seri
ously the rules of the genre.. .1
A bunch of hot 20-somethings on
a roadtrip? Check. Elisha Cuthbert
(in what must be the world's shortest
shorts) and co. certainly qualify.
And they're on their way to the

year's biggest football game. How
nice.
Said 20-somethings full of drama?
Check. Carly (Cuthbert) is trying to
keep the peace between her
boyfriend (Jared Padalecki) and her
brother. Nick (Chad Michael Mur
ray), while Nick's dullest-tool-in-tbe
shed friend Dalton (Jon Abrahams)
ogles her. Oh yeah. Paris Hilton is
there too.
Needless exposition? Check.
"Why did you gotta steal that car?"

"You should tell
him you're preg
nant," etc. Why
don't you just look
right at the camera
and tell your life
story, while you're
at it?
Being stranded in
the middle of
nowhere, only to

meet a creepy guy who leads the
aforementioned hot 20-somethings
to a small, curiously unpopulated,
town? Yep, it's got that one too,
Crazy serial killers? Hell yeah! It
takes them almost an hour to get
going but these two (both played by
Brian Van Holt) are as psycho as
psycho killers get - even Freddy and
Jason never thought of turning their
victims into wax sculptures. As in
any other horror flick, half the fun
here is trying to guess the order in
which the kids meet their grisly
deaths. Unlike the others, the other
half of the fun here is making fun of
Paris Hilton. Though not a great ac
tress by any stretch of the imagina
tion, Paris is undoubtedly a good tar
get, explicitly spoofing her more fa
mous role from"The Simple Life" -
and from the Internet sex tape you
could only say you haven't seen if
you were lying through your teeth.

"House of Wax" certainly has its
share of blood and gore, with
lopped-off fingers and Achilles ten
dons with a peculiar affinity for hav
ing kuives rammed through them. It
also has the required explanation of
why the psycho killers have chosen
their line of work. In this case, it
doesn't much matter - "House of
Wax" seems to be the movie for
which the phrase "suspense of disbe
lief was conjured. If you bother ask
ing questions like "How can he sur
vive an arrow through the chest?" or
"How can her cell phone get recep
tion there?" you clearly haven't
caught the spirit.
In a way, the silliness of the movie
is a flaw, rendering it less scary than a
more believable film. But "House of
Wax" is pure camp and never pre
tends to be anything else. It might be
dumber than Paris Hilton on a warm
day, but it sure is fun.
