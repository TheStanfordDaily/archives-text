Ah, the miniature golf course. Eighteen holes, lluorescent
arcade games, tiers of worthless prizes, cardboard pizza and
Icees. And even though we're 20 now, it's still a great way to spend a
sunny afternoon — or, more realistically, a not-so-sober Tuesday night.
But with our hectic Stanford schedules and all the "work" engineers pre
tend to do so they can "get a job" when they graduate, who has time to indulge
in a little bit of childhood nostalgia? The answer: Who cares? Make time.
Goifland USA is located at 855 El Camino Real in Sunnyvale. It's a 20-niinute
drive — well, half an hour if you listen to the guy in the back seat who swears Foothill
is faster — and it's worth every mile. Walk into Goifland and you're greeted by two
full courses of green, blue and mauve synthetic carpet. The King's Quest course is said
to be more fun, but if you're looking fora challenge, Goifland suggests you try the Tiki
Safari. Either way, 36 high-class holes await. Goifland has impossible to resist loop
the-loops, classic windmill holes, blue-spired castles, abandoned mine shaft-themed
shots, three or four holes that actually require you to launch your ball about eight
feet in the air, and a few ultra-frustrating volcano hills that make you hit the ball
just right or risk it rolling all the way back to where you fucking started ... in
case you can't tell, I'm still a little frustrated.
Seriously, we're not talking about any piece-ot-crap Malibu course here
(although Intermission does appreciate Malibu's batting cages and go
karts). This is a world-class joint. And I'll let you in on a little se
cret. The hole with the three dragon-type things'.' Hit the
, middle one in the mouth — hit it really hard — and ...
it'll spit out a free ball. I can't guarantee it'll
work again, but it worked once.

INTERMISSION:
What's your favorite hole?
"Depends who it belongs to."
"The butt."

Picture it: A serene midsummer afternoon out on the
links. You're there with a few pals, ready for friendly competi- tE!'
tion. Wafting in on the warm breeze comes the pleasant smell 0f...
the most humongous blunt you've ever seen, being smoked by the ill-at- Vfl
tired group of teenage slackers who are letting you play through on the third
hole. This ain't golf. Tiger. It's FRISBEEgoIf, a superior variant that does |
away with the drivers, the dress codes and the decorum that plague real golf.
In my hometown of Columbus, Ohio, they know how to do disc golf. The cours
es are in picturesque metropolitan parks: At each "tee" — OK, it's a strip of con
crete with a red line on it — there's a signpost that shows the par, the distance and a
map of the hole, so you can plot out how best to approach it. Yes, we have lots of time
on our hands in the ol' C-Bus. Out here in the Bay Area where land is scarce, disc golf
requires a bit more resourcefulness. But not much. AxeComm has a Web site
(http://www.stanford.edu/group/axecomm/frisbee.html) that outlines the unoffi
cial Stanford frisbee golf course. It starts and ends at the Law School, and some
where in the middle it involves whizzing your frisbee past the heads of unsus
pecting Daily staffers in the Storke Publications Courtyard. Don't peg the
journos in the head — it'll mess up your drive!
The game is eminently simple. Starting from a designated spot, you try .
to get your frisbee to smother designated spot — usually about 3(X) feet
away — in as few throws as possible. In the meantime, it's con
sidered good form to knock back a few beers. And dammit,
yell "Fore!" if you think you might hit someone j
wandering across your fairway! Not that

"I never thought golf was
a physical activity before,
but 30 balls later... you
get pretty tired."

Br While numerous Stanford students might be well versed in the
l§r ways of the traditional golf course, it's hard to say exactly how many
ok have experienced the wonder and awe that necessarily accompany beach
Kg? golf. It's like regular golf, in the sense that you use clubs (mostly the sand
P 1 * wedge) and balls (orange are easiest to see if you're forced to beach golf at night),
r" but at the same time, it's so, so different.
You see, in regular golf, you have a "score." You hit the ball "toward" something
*' in particular, specifically a hole. In other words, there's actually a greater purpose that
! one might have in mind when playing it other than simply whacking some dimpled bal
ata blob and seeing where it goes. Beach golf, on the other hand, has no greater pur
pose, which is precisely why it is so ... great.
The Intermission staff was introduced to beach golf at the most recent Daily staff re
i treat. Armed with 20 golf balls, a few wedges and a whole lot of heart, the team
I trooped down to the Santa Cruz surf. Sure, one might not be "allowed" to hit golf
I, balls into the Pacific Ocean. And yeah, it might be hard to "hit" the golf ball when
it's pitch black outside. But we'll be damned if beach golf ain't the best Ameri-
E* can-born game since football (American football, that is). (Editor'snote: Who
the hell admits to liking both football and golf at the siune time? Hmmph.)
And remember, beach golf isn't just some cop out excuse for a sport.
HLjk Not just anyone can do it all that well. Many may play it, but few
. will master it. We prefer to t hink of it as a life sport — or at
least as something to keep you amused until you get
sick of having to buy new golf balls every
damn time you go play it.

"Now if only it
rowto straight."

You've seen the rest, now try the best — if you haven't . . '
•>!:$ already, that is. Sure, there might be a lot of hype elsewhere on
this page about playing various incarnates of golf that feature smaller
than-nonnal proportions, frisbees or sand, but there's no real substitute _
for the smell of fresh-cut grass and the aesthetic beauty of the standard 18-
hole course.
Besides, Stanford is Tiger country, so what could possibly be a better place to start
teeing off? Face it, you've got no excuse, so buck up and start working on that swing.
Remember to start early: You'll need all the help you can get when you're out there
hacking away, making a mockery of the game of golf as well as yourself in front of your
roommates and any others you were silly / stupid enough to invite along.
Most Stanford students are practically ready to hit up the links anyway — everyone's
got a friend or two whizzing around in a golf cart because of that "knee injury" or "bro
ken spinal column." And you'll find saving money through avoiding cart rentals to be
quite helpful since golf, in general, tends to be an absurdly expensive sport. If you're
going to be dropping $3 per ball and $300 per driver, you'll need to cut some cor
ners on cost somewhere (but don't you dare think of raiding your grandpa's
closet for golf apparel).
But even if you've got the personal drive and the name-brand gear to
get going for those greens, you might still be hindered by the fact that
you're not any "good." Don't worry about that, though. That's
the story of every golfer who has ever walked the face of
the earth (well, except for Tiger and that Vijay
guy). And besides, why else would Stan- t
ford offer Athletic 52?

plaid and the only place you
can pop your collar and not
get dirty looks or immediately
feel ashamed."



Mnim, the ole windmill at the mini golf course. Note
the stylish bench in the background that seems awk
