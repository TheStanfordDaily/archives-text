## Linx: On-campus location, off-campus quality 
### ANN CHIN INTERMISSION GOURMET 
Disappointed in Stanford Dining?
Give them a chance to redeem them
selves by checking ouLUflCa
ria with relatively ujfl&ale food in the
new Clark Centyf(the Bio-X build
ing), just acros/Campus Drive from
the Gates BiJllding. With well-pre
sented dishesierved by serious-look
ing chefs, thiJplace could almost pass
for an off-campus restaurant (which
is, of course, agood thing).
The space \s supposed to foster
ground-breakin\ lunchtime chit-chat
among scientists, the atmosphere is
open and with light

streaming in through

two glass walls

and pic
tures of

giant
green
leaves cov
ering an
other. The

man sitting
a few seats
from me

spent all of lunch talking loudly

about diagrams he had drawn on his
napkin, so maybe the plan is working.
The menu is divided into three eth
nic food groups: American, Asian and
a loose umbrella category that ranges
s from IndiaTlSthe
American cuisjrfe is regional n morbs,
rectfatly Soufnwestern, the Asian is
usualrV noddle soup and a combina
tion stff-firy bowl, and the Mediter
ranean/Indian can be anything from
polenta |> curry.
Theflprices are moderate,
rangi 4\ rom around $6 to $7 for

a dis/, \but if

you/re \

[yt\-
-mges

pecially hungry,

the amount of food in

some dishes might not

be enough to fill you

up.

In particular, I would highly rec
ommend the Asian noodle soups,
which the chefs have taken some po
etic license in preparing. The Viet
namese pho noodles and the Japanese
udon efcfcily what
you'd findafan ethnic
\hey're Jfght and flavorful adapter
trons. /

\Tlre menu
\ /

sionally, hut the

recent Pap-

pardelle with Grilled Chick-

en, Prosciutto Mushrooms

and Aged Parmesan is a

simple but colorful pasta

dish. What's most im-

pressive is t)yit the pasta is consistent
ly al dente anutije sauces are lightjjjro
If you're into spicy food, consider

the Stir-Fry Malaysian Flat Noodles
with Chiliesand Soy Roasted Salmon.
These flat noodles are thinner and
easier to chew than their coarsely pre-

pared coun-

ter

part^»t-Wtthms

aKhough just as

" "b" \
oily. And the icing onNihe

cake is the fresh and sta-

vory salmon, amazingl\
moist and complement-\

eclpy a subtle soy glaze.
k)ther than the made-to-order ]
d»kes, there's also a salad bar and a/
of the same sushi they offer
M and Union Square fc\
/ TresicftJer, as well as some surprising
ly authentic ethnic soups a
cup. How aiiftmmic' l > {'lljunrffTi for the
Tangy Duck with Salted Vegetables,

but I can't comment on the Moroccan
Carrot. For less adventurous eaters,
the Cream of Broccoli Cheddar is a
safe bet. The soups are overshadowed
by the hot entrees that get adver-

tised on fancy plasma-

screen monitors, but
they're perfect fora
side item or a small

lunch.

There's also some
thing to be said about the ser-

vice. Instead of just scooping

mounds of preheated food on

your plate, the chefs take a bit

more time constructing each

a* order it. The

food is much "fresher, but

sometimes at the expense ofSjme. At

ttfe Mediterranean/Indian station,
iney'll wait until you actually plare an
• order before they start steamingVthe
I fresh mussels (yes, mussels) or fit ish
I boiling the half-cooked pasta.
\ The bottom line is that it's worth
Viving this place a try. It's not q/uite
fye going off-campus, but thylood
is pood enough and the Cen
ter enough that might
even fnfyai is University
dining.
