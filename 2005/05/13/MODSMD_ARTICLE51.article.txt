# Rob Schneider: Gettin' jiggy in Europe
## 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION SCHNEIDERPHILE 
Rob Schneider is reprising his role
of from 1999's dumb/funny comedy
"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo." In
termission caught up with Schneider
pimping the new film, "Deuce Biga
low: European Gigolo," in theaters
August 12.
Intermission: How did you decide to
make a sequel to "Deuce Bigalow"?
Rob Schneider People really liked the
first one, and it was relatively success
ful. I never planned to make a sequel,
but then I started thinking about it. I
was thinking it'd be fun to go where
prostitution is legal: Amsterdam.
INT: Except for"The Empire
Strikes Back," most sequels tend to
be sub par. How do you think you're
correcting this problem with this
movie?
RS: Well, "The Empire Strikes
Back" was the best. As far as come
dies go, "The Pink Panther Strikes
Again" is really the only good one.
INT: Where'd you shoot this movie?
RS: "Deuce Bigalow" was shot en

tirely in Amsterdam. I loved it. Ams
terdam is a beautiful city. It's gor
geous; it was great to live there for
four months... When 1 wasn't work
ing, I'd see the guys from the crew in
their own boat, going through the
canals in beautiful Amsterdam.
INT: Have you ever met an actual
gigolo?
RS: Just Richard Gere.
INT: Do you relate to the charac
ter in any way?
RS: I 'm not quite as big a loser as
Deuce Bigalow, but we share a
lot in common. I'm equally
as unsuccessful with

women.
INT: Is Deuce your favorite
character you've played?
RS: I really liked "50 First
Dates." Deuce Bigalow was
a lot of fun. "The Hot
Chick" was a lot of fun too. I
love to work. Getting to
work with Anna Faris and
Rachel McAdams was
great. They're great girls.
Guys' girls - they like guys
more than they like girls.

They've got a good sense of humor
and they laugh at everything I say. I
demand that.
INT: Do you miss working on "Sat
urday Night Live"?
RS: Sometimes. When I'm at home,
and. you know, trying to roll what's
left of a joint. Sometimes 1 think of

something funny and go, "Oh, it's
perfect for Saturday." And then I re
member I haven't been on the show in
ten years. Then I get depressed. Then
I just call Adam [Sandler] and tell
him. He's a great laugher - he's very
generous with laughing... "Saturday
Night Live" was like getting accepted

into an exclusive club, a club of
show business diarrhea. It was
a marathon to get something
funny on. And if it is funny, you
can have all of America talking
on Sunday. But I haven't
watched it in a few years. It
seems to be less idea driven
and more performance driven.
INT: Where did "You can do
it!" come from?
RS: I got a phone call from
Adam saying he wanted me to

be in"The Waterboy" and they
had this one line. Tim Herlihy

wrote it, Adam's partner in a lot

of stuff he writes. And
Adam thought it was a
line that people could
repeat. He told me I
wouldn't be able to go

anywhere without hearing, "You can
do it!" And when the movie came
out, it was just like that: "You can do
it all night long!" And now we try to
put it in every movie, which always
gets a little more ridiculous.
INT: Is there another line like that?
RS: Yeah. "That's a huge bitch" from
"Deuce Bigalow. I try to put that in
every movie.
INT: You're doing "The Bench
warmers" with Jon Heder. How's
shooting a movie with Napoleon Dy
namite?
RS: We call him Nap D. We try to say
the lines from that movie and he
keeps correcting us. "I can do what
ever 1 want to do, gosh,'' or whatever
it is.
INT: What are your plans for the fu
ture?
RS: Well I'm going to finish up one
more movie ["The Bench warmers"]
and then I want to take a little bit of a
break... I'm going to take off to Cuba.
I'm going to smoke some cigars. And
then we're going to do this movie
"The Barbarian" either in Argentina
or Africa.
