## Spoon's 'Fiction' is not quite a 'Gimme' 
### WILL OREMUS INTERMISSION SPOONER 
Spoon gained notoriety when
their song "The Way We Get By"

graced the first
soundtrack from
"The 0.C." But
you're more likely
to hear their new
album on NPR
than on the stereo
at your local Chris
mukkah party.
"Gimme Fic
tion" isn't a collec
tion of spiffy songs.
It's an Album.
From portentous

opener "The Beast and Dragon,
Adored" to coda"Merchants of
Soul." each builds on the last. Yes,
two is "The Two Sides of Monsieur
Valentine." If lead singer and song
writer Britt Daniel were naming the
band today, I wouldn't be surprised
if he called it"The Mysterious
Spoon of Death."
When I first saw the track list I
worried the music would be extra
pretentious too, but it's not so: The
Spoon sound is still intact. Daniel
carefully constructs each song from
a foundation of repetitivechord
progressions (mostly guitar, some
piano) locked to simple rhythmic

grooves (think Mod
est Mouse), giving
the listener confi
dencethat even,' note
has a purpose. On the
first listen it comes
off as straight-ahead
rock, but it's the op
posite of the bar
band or jam-band

aesthetic. Spoon's simplicity is
achieved not through spontaneity,
but through effort and attention to

detail.
While the signature sound re
mains, the breezy hooks and playful
lyrics of past Spoon hits have given-

way to darker,
more obscurely
metaphoric fare.
Eight of the 11
tracks on
"Gimme Fic
tion" are longer
than the longest
on 2002's "Girls
Can Tell." And
lyrics like "Re
member the
weight of the
world / It's a
sound that we

used to buy" (from"I Summon
You") all but announce: "This is,_.
Maybe the best reference point
for "Gimme Fiction" is the recent
Wilco album "A Ghost is Born."
Both take a classic-rock-ra
diosound and toy with it artfully,
exploring instrumental repetition,
guitar solos and feedback as a
means of reinvigorating a tired
form. And both may appeal to 30-
something cognoscenti more than
the MTVgeneration. My own
short attention span led me to de
clare this album"boring" after
three or four listens. Luckily, my
sense of dutycompelled me to
keep listening.

If you're just going to
download a few tracks (legally,
of course), go for"I Summon
You" — a beautiful, lilting
plaint about long-distance love
— and "Monsieur Valentine,"
one of the only songs where
Daniel sounds like he's actually
having fun. In the firstverse,
Monsieur Valentine (bedecked

in "his coat
and his boots
and his black
heart ma
chine") kid
naps the
queen. The
second time
through, he
makes love
to the Duke.
It's silly
enough that

it almost sounds improvised —
though you can be pretty sure it
isn't.
