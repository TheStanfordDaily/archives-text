# Not everything's rosy on Adams' new 'Cold Roses' double album
## 
### DAVID KUO INTERMISSION ALT-COUNTRY AFFICIOANADO 
You might remember Ryan
Adams. No, not the guy who sang
"Everything I Do" or "Summer of
'69" (You're thinking of Bryan
Adams). If he still doesn't ring a bell,
Ryan's biggest hits were "New York,
New York" (his own work, not the
Sinatra standard) that brought a tear
to everyone's eye after 9/11 and the
chilling cover of the Oasis classic,
"Wonderwall."
Those songs, however, don't
begin to describe the former alt
country bandleader turned
singer/songwriter. And if you still
don't know him, think David Gray
singing songs Wilco would write.
Once compared to the likes of Mor-

rissey and Paul Westerberg (both
former frontmen of influential and
imploded bands), Adams has quietly
defined his own genre, fusing folk,
country and rock over bittersweet
lyrics that make you feel that he's
singing about you.
"Cold Roses," a double album
and the artist's latest release, is only
the first of three albums slated for
this year (take that, Bright Eyes).
Usually as a solo artist, Adams joins
forces with the Papal-approved
backing band, The Cardinals on
"Cold Roses." It isn't easy to divert
the attention from Adams' somber

and candid vocals, but the Cardinals
compliment the lyrics so well that it
sounds like the

artists have
been together
for years. With
slide guitar, the
occasional
vocal harmony,
and a solid
rhythm section,
the Cardinals
give Adams
something he's
been missing
since he went
solo: a worthy

baCKing sound for his sometimes
thoughtful, other times brash, but al
ways earnest lyrics.
"Cherry Lane," my favorite track
on the album, begins with a quasi-

Rolling Stones
honky-tonk open
ing and slows to just
a soft vocal harmo
ny over guitar. The
lyrics also jab at
your heart - "Stare
into her eyes and
then try and explain
it/Try and explain it
/ But that shit just
fucks you up / And 1
can never get close
enough." Okay,
maybe on paper, the
lyrics aren't that im
pressive - but add in
a crescendo of gui
tar and harrowing
vocal harmonies,
and you'll see why
there aren't too
many comparable
artists in this genre.

Adams' more mellow tunes
("Rosebud," "Now that you're
Gone" and "When Will You Come
Back Home") remind me of Adams'
earlier releases - but the big differ
ence with these new songs is the
greater role of instrumentation. The
addition of memorable yet curt gui
tar licks gives these compositions an
edge over Adams' more depressive
songs that sounded bare with just
guitar and vocals.
Unfortunately, the faster-paced
tracks ("Let it Ride" and "Beautiful
Sorta" come to mind) fall short of the
upbeat energy of "New York, New
York," which propelled Adams out

of the Indie underground and into
the alternative mainstream. I'm not

ready to admit
that Adams' has
lost his musical
prowess yet, but
the lack of mem
orable lyrics is a
concern. Call me
a cynic, but hear
ing the same
phrase repeated
a dozen times in
the span of three
minutes isn't my
idea of musical
genius, even if

the guitar is rockin'.
"Cold Roses" eventually gets a lit
tle boring, and at times the only clue
that you're listening to a different
song is that Adams is singing a differ
ent lyric over and over and over. The
songs in all of their musical worth be
come inundated with the same for
mula of guitar, vocal harmony and
the occasional instrumental solo.
Then again, it's that same formula
and predictability that keep me from
deleting "Cold Roses" from my
iPod. After listening to the album
over and over, 1 began to hear its
finer points - usually a catchy lyric
that makes you stop, get a little con
templative, and go on with your life,
or a fresh musical flourish that you
didn't hear before. If you're interest
ed in listening for musical nuances
and don't mind the heavy alt-country
tilt, this album is at least worthy of an
Our Tunes download.


Think smoking doesn't make you look cool? Huh? Then how come
I'm famous? (The hunting knife doesn't hurt either.)



He's like Sfevie Wonder, but not blind.
