# Buses. Elevators and Dark Hallways: Sex at Formal
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, FOXY FOXTROTTER 
Roxy's talked a lot about sex in her
day. Sex with multiple partners, sex
with your date's roommate, sex in the
library. But Roxy's neglected one of
the most rewarding types of sex there
is: formal sex. No, I'm not talking
about sex that follows a lot of rules
and regulations, I'm talking about sex
at formats. May is formal season -
there are fraternity and sorority for
mals, Senior Formal (tomorrow),
Queer Formal, frosh boat dance for
mals. Junior Formal and probably
some I'm missing. Anyway, you get
the picture. There are a lot of formals

coming up, and that means lots of
chances to have sex at them.
Allow Roxy to enlighten you on
why formal sex is so great. Slimming it
up with adjectives, it's risky, adven
turous, different, new, wild, kinky and
flippin' sweet. Not to mention, over
the course of the night you'll be pre
sented with multiple chances to score.
The four stages of the night include:
the bus ride to formal, the formal it-

self, the bus ride home
and the last ditch ef
fort post-formal chill
session.
The bus ride to the
formal is perhaps the
most difficult time to
score. This early part
of the evening is only
for the highly skilled,
because you've got a

lot of ob
stacles to
tackle,
like the
large
number
of still
semi-
sober on
lookers.
So, per
haps this
stage of
the night
is best
used as a
prelude.
Foreplay
on the

bus will get both partners warmed up
before you get to the club. This is es
pecially for those of you taking a love
ly lady as your date. If she's not ready
to go, bus sex is not going to be fun for
either of you! Take Roxy's word for

it. Get her juices flowing and the
kitchen in the back of Gordon Bier
sch won't know what hit it.
Formal sex is certainly not limited
to backroom kitchens. Hallways,
staircases, even elevators can become
a sexual hideaway. San Francisco City
Hall still doesn't know what went
down in its elevators during Senior
Formal 2003, but you can imagine.
At some point, the dancing will end
and you'll stumble to the buses. The
bus ride home, in contrast to its evil
twin, is probably the easiest place to
get laid. Most other passengers are
also hooking up and therefore paying
no attention to you, drunk and passed
out, or voyeurs who dare not disturb

your game. Really, stop wor
rying about who's looking at
you anyway. You could've
been having sex by now if

you'd just let go of those inhibitions.
Go ahead, get your groove on. The
average bus ride from San Francisco

gives you at least 40 minutes to
do the deed. Just pray your for
mal isn't at Piccolo's.
So you're back on campus
and you've squandered all of
your earlier chances at formal
sex? Don't worry, there's still
one last chance: the after-party.
Hopefully you and your date
are both still functioning. As
suming you are, you're back on
home turf, so spit game the way
you normally would. Invite
your date inside to raid your
open kitchen, offer to walk

them home, let them sleep at your
place if you live near Tressider and
they live in Suites. Roxy trusts that
you have instincts, so use what's avail
able to you. Formal Season is here,
enjoy it!
