### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Despite all the activity in White Plaza
yesterday at lunchtime — from the a cap
pella groups selling tickets to senior class
representatives soliciting Senior Gift dona
tions to a filibuster-ers on a podium — it
would have been hard to miss the Yom
Haiatzamaut, or Israel Independence Day.
celebration. The area in front of El Centro
Chicano was decorated with white and blue
balloons, banners and flags to celebrate the
holiday.
"We wanted to send a message to the

Stanford community that there is more to Is
rael than the Palestinian conflict," said
freshman Cheryl Pruce, vice-president of
the Stanford Israel Alliance and one of the
coordinators of the event. "There is so much
negative stigma associated with Israel and
we want people to recognize that Israel is a
beautiful country with a very rich history
and culture."
One of the highlights of Israel Pride
Week, which began on Monday and ends to
morrow, included speakers, dancing, music
and food. Many students from the audience
joined in on the singing and dancing while
others waited in line for free falafels. Stu

dents organizing the event also sold candles,
Israeli flags and various Israel-themed t
shirts. one emblazoned with the phrase "I
love Israel. I want Peace, I am a Zionist."
Sophomore Lyuba Wolf, co-president of
the Stanford Israel Alliance, gave a speech
on her personal definition of Zionism.
"I'm a Zionist," she said. "I'm tired of
people telling me that Zionism is racism.
Zionism is a love of Israel and a hope for
peace."
She added that although she has never
stepped foot on Israeli soil, she feels a strong
connection to the country. In an interview with
The Daily, Wolf explained that Israel Indepen
dence Day is a holiday for all Jewish people,
not only those living in Israel.
Other student organizers echoed these sen
timents.
"This day is significant to the Jewish people
as a whole because the founding of the State of
Israel marked the realization of the Jewish
people's aspirations for self-determination fol
lowing a history of expulsions, persecution and
the lack of a secure existence in other coun
tries," said Adina Danzig, executive director of
Hillel at Stanford.
The event's coordinators stressed that this
celebration was meant to be purely cultural,
not political.
"We want to celebrate the country of Israel
— that includes its culture, its people, and all of
its achievements," Wolf said. "We don't have
any specific stance on Israel's foreign policy,
other than the fact that we believe that the Jew
ish state has a right to exist."
Students, faculty, staff and members of the
community who attended the celebration said
they approved of the event's goals.
"I'm very pleased that this event hap
pened," said freshman Danny Arbeiter. "It
was obvious that the organizers put a lot of time
and effort into this, the food was great and I had
fun."
Unlike last year's celebration, which was
met with protesters bearing Palestinian flags,
the event went smoothly with no opposition.
"Last year, there was a silent protest by pro-
Palestinian students, so we were expecting
some kind of protest this year as well," said
freshman Mishan Araujo, vice-president of the
Stanford Israel Alliance. "There is a lot of hos
tility on campus because of the Israeli-Palestini
an conflict. We hope that this event has helped
promote cultural awareness and allowed peo
ple to realize Israel's cultural significance."
