## But some complain of untidy laundry rooms on weekends 
### LY CHHENG 
Stanford students come from di
verse social, economic and political
backgrounds — but in the end. they
all have to do their laundry.
To gauge student satisfaction
with the relatively new laundry sys
tem. Student Housing Services cir
culated a feedback survey, and the
results have been overwhelmingly
positive, according to Associate Di
rector for Housing Operations
Imogen Hinds.
She said it was clear from com
ments and ratings that residents
feel the laundry rooms are being
kept sufficiently clean by custodial
staffs during the week. However,
students expressed lower satisfac
tion with the cleanliness of laundry

rooms over weekends.
"In many residences, the stu
dents feel tKat the residents them
selves are tailing to keep the laun
dry rooms clean and tidy during the
weekend or in the evenings,"
Hinds added.
Student I lousing administrators
said they hope an increase in Resi
dential Education programming
will encourage students to keep the
rooms cleaner when custodial staff
is unavailable. In addition. Student
Housing is piloting a Sunday custo
dial cleaning program in Toyon,
Branner and Manzanita Park this
quarter.
As an incentive for participating
in the laundry survey, four random
ly chosen participants will be award
ed $50 and $25 gift certificates.
"I took the survey just to see if I
could get one of the gift certifi
cates." sophomore Jared Brown
said. "My goal is to win one of them
before I graduate because then I'll
be convinced that they actually

Brown added that he felt that sev
eral the survey questions were irrele
vant and pointless. He cited a ques
tion asking whether there was
enough signage posted in the laundry
room.
"All we want are the machines.

not stuff to read," said Brown.
Sophomore Chris Williams said
he took the survey because he want
ed Student Housing to know how
good the program was and to possi
bly win something in the process.
Unlike Brown, Williams said he felt
the questions were reasonable and
useful.
Student Housing instituted the
"Just Like Home" laundry program
last fall, replacing the old coin and
SUID card-operated laundry system
with free washer and dryer service.

According to the Housing Assign
ment Services Web site, the no-coins,
no-card program, first proposed by
the ASSU Cost Policy Group, allows
all students living in on-campus resi
dences and apartments to do their
laundry in brand new. energy effi
cient and water-saving machines as
part of their housing charges.
Residents have been able to do
their laundry without hav ing to worry
about coins, card balances or broken
card readers, and instead pay a flat
annual fee of $K4.
