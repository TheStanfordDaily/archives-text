"ON GETTING PEOPLE TO TELL YOU
MORE THAN THEY WANT TO"
H HE
Dr. Todd Gitlin
Columbia University
There is a naive assumption that respondents in social research want to tell the truth as
they best see it. But of course they have other motives as well: to present themselves
as respectable; to protect their honor. Dr. Gitlin will draw on his experience of
interviewing (a) journalists and (b) television entertainment decision-makers to explore
some of the pitfalls of excessive gullibility in particular. He will reflect upon the ethical
dilemmas entailed.
