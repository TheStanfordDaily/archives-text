# Nobel laureate addresses grads

### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Iranian human rights lawyer and 2(X)3
Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi
delivered a politically charged com
mencement address at the Stanford Law
School yesterday morning. In her speech,
entitled "The Role of Justice in Reducing
Social Terrorism," Ebadi urged the grad
uating class to consider human rights and
peaceful strategies to bring an end to ter
rorism.
Ebadi, who gave the speech in Farsi —
translated by an interpreter — received a
law degree from the University of Tehran
and in 1969 became the first female judge
in the history of the Iranian justice system.
Following the Islamic Revolution of 1979,
a new government policy was established
forbidding women from serving as judges

and she was dismissed from the bench.
Since then, she has founded two non
governmental organizations to support
human rights. She has been imprisoned
several times and was even barred from
practicing law for 13 years. Today, she
works on high-profile human rights cases
and is the first Muslim woman to have re
ceived the Nobel Peace Prize.
She is currently working a case related
to Zahra Kazema, an Iranian-Canadian
journalist who was arrested for taking
photos of a student protest in Iran and
who died in custody shortly thereafter.
In her address, Ebadi stressed the im
portance of fundamental human rights
and their role in the war on terror.
"We are punishing terrorists to end
terror," she said. "It's certainly a neces-

sary and legitimate task, but it must
be done within the framework of
human rights. Fighting terrorists
must not be an excuse for destroying
individual and social freedoms. Pun
ishing terrorists will not suffice —
we must find and destroy the root of
terrorism. It is prejudice and injus
tice that forces a group to engage in
such acts."
Ebadi added that cultural and reli
gious understanding is a "step on the
path to viable peace" and that it is the
responsibility of universities to take
this first step. She suggested that to
preserve the memory of the victims of
the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States
could establish an educational insti
tute in a developing country for each
individual who died.
"Otherwise, resorting to violence
will not solve any problems, as vio
lence begets violence," she said,
adding that the best way to end vio
lence and terrorism would be to ex
tend democracy and social justice.
"We must take care that Western
countries do not take advantage of
democracy and human rights and use
these concepts as license to attack
other countries, just as undemocratic
Islamic countries do not have the
right to take the name of Islam for
terrorism," she said. "The best
means to create democracy is

through negotiations and if they fail,
by resorting to the United Nations.
Only as such are these efforts legiti
mate and defensible."
Law School graduate Stuart
Rosenberg said he approved of the
speech's political nature.
"I heard a lot of people saying
that they were happy that the speech
wasn't just dishwater and full of plat
itudes, that it had a real political bite
instead," he said. "Personally, actu
ally, 1 wanted the dishwater. A cou
ple of the more politically conserva
tive people didn't want to hear it, but
I know a lot of people found it in
spiring."
Zeenat Basrai, another graduate,
agreed.
"I was really looking forward to
hearing her speak and it met all of my
expectations," she said, 'i particular
ly liked how she compared the war on
terror with our role in it. 1 didn't think
it was too political — it felt like a call
to action in the sense that we should
pay attention to what we do and re
member how our actions affect oth
ers."
Ebadi said the ultimate goal
should be globalization of human
rights, even if such a thing "may be a
dream in the midst of world chaos."
"Our challenge here today is to
dream, to move forward in what we
believe in, but more realistically and
not to forget that many of man's
achievements began with a dream,"
she said. "We must deliver a world in
better form than what was delivered
to us by our fathers."
