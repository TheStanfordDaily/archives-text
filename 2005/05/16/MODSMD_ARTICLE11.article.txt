# Students dress as Disney characters
## Big Dance draws record numbers 
### MEGAN WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Students were dancing late into the night and well past quiet
hours this weekend, hut they weren't engaged in your average frat
party grind. It was Big Dance, an annual event held at Roble Gym
during which participants showed off their social dance moves.
In accordance with this year's theme, Big Danceyland: The
Wonderful World of Big Dance, the attendees arrived dressed in
costumes ranging from Lilo to rigger. There was a lineup of dance
performance groups, live bands and a guest appearance by Vienna
Teng.
I his year 211 students, a record high, stayed all night — from 9
p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday.
Senior Tina Wong, chair of this year's event and a member of
Danse Libre one of the groups that performed at Big Dance —
said the Big Dance is always unique and provides performance op
portunities fora diverse range of groups.
' Big Dance is a pretty significant contrast to Viennese Ball,
which is Stanford's other large annual social dance event," Wong
said. "It helps people to see that there are all sorts of ways to have
fun with social dance — formal balls are an amazing and elegant
tradition, but you can also ditch the formality and just have fun and
be wacky."
Junior Gem ( hien, a member of the event's facilities committee,
decided to help coordinate the dance as a way to say thanks for all
the lun she's had in social dance classes.
"I have had a great experience in the social dance community,
and I've enjoyed meeting people a lot," she said. "Since I've been
able to enjoy it so much I feel like it's my responsibility to do the
background work so other people can enjoy it too."
Sophomore Juliann Schamel said that the appeal of Big Dance
is partially the length of the event and partially the featured Stan
ford dancers.
"It's the only dance each year that I can justify leaving in the
middle to gel ice cream and know fora fact that it will still be going
strong when I get back," Schamel said. "I love Stanford dances be
cause everyone is so non-competitive. They come just to have fun
and you can see it in their faces and in the way they move."
Wong also noted that the event can be an important experience
for new dancers still learning the basic steps.
"I think Big Dance contributes to the dance community because
it's a pretty big accomplishment for new dancers," she said. "Once
you've stayed at a dance event till 6 a.m., you can really start to feel
like you can identify yourself as a dancer — I know that's how 1 fell
after my first year as an all-nighter."
While the event usually draws a large student crowd, attendees
included alumni and residents from surrounding areas.
Dustin Madden, Class ol 2(M)4, decided to attend even though he
is no longer a student.
"I basically went to Big Dance in an attempt to use my dancing
prowess to pickup on innocent young girls," Madden said in an e
mail to The Daily. "I had a great time, even though my goal was un
fulfilled. I guess the scraggly facial hair and sketchy 1-already-grad
uated aura just aren't in style anymore."
