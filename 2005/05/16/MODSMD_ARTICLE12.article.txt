# Law students win libel suit
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
"All in all, it was the most miserable, sleazy, cheap opera
tion I have ever worked for," former Ampex employee Scott
Cargle wrote on a Yahoo! message board in 2(H) 1 after he was
laid off. "1 just wonder how the crooks fooled everyone for so
long." Soon alter the words were posted, the company sued
Cargle for libel.
The California Court of Appeals recently ruled in Cargle's
favor, which was good news for several Stanford students.
While Cargle, who worked for Ampex subsidiary iNEXTV,
posted the original message anonymously, he was forced by a
lower court to reveal his identity. It was then that he asked
Stanford Cvberlaw Clinic Director Jennifer Grannick for legal
representation. She not only agreed but also encouraged her
students to pitch in for elective credit.
Carl Anderson, a third-year law student, was involved in the
clinic when it filed a motion against Ampex on Cargle's behalf.
The motion alleged that Ampex's suit violated California's
Anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation statute,
which prohibits companies from filing frivolous suits to scare
employees or former employees into silence.
Four years later, Anderson delivered the winning oral argu
ment before the Court of Appeals, which then decided to dis
miss Ampex's case.
Anderson said the hands-on experience he gained taught
him lessons he could not have learned in a classroom.
"This case doesn't just round out my legal education, it is my
legal education," said Anderson, who was asked to assist in the
case due to his interest in free speech law. "Instead of learning
theory about what your client's rights are and what they should
be. this is actually going to court and getting your clients' rights
vindicated. It's one thing to talk about why this corporation
can't sue a person to try to get him to stop criticizing them, but
another thing to go to court and ac
tually fight it."
While Ampex has the opportuni
ty to appeal the decision, Anderson
said he believes the current ruling
will withstand future challenges.
"Ampex can seek California
Supreme Court review and they
may, but the Supreme Court has
discretion over whether or not to
accept, so 1 think their lawyers are
deciding whether to even try," An
derson said. "The Supreme Court
takes very few cases for review. We
feel confident."
Not only is the decision unlikely
to be reversed, but the Appeals
Court certified the case for publica
tion so that it might serve as a prece
dent in similar suits, Anderson said.
"In this case, the court has issued
an opinion that's explained the
types of things the anti-SLAPP law
is supposed to apply to," Anderson
said. "When the opinion is pub
lished, it becomes law in California
and in the future, people will cite
this."
