## The 						future of synchronous menstruation 
### 
I'd like to state for the record that my parents'
genes are wonderful. Collectively, they are smart,
slim, personable and build muscle quickly. They are
tall and beautiful. As a child, I was cute, charming and
tall for my age. But then I mutated, from standing too
close to the microwave. My parents warned me about
that one.
Now that I'm short, flabby, ulcerated and have
sparse, irregular eyebrows, I've come to understand
the consequences of my youthful insubordination.
The current wisdom on female pheromones is that
these airborne chemicals waft from the armpits of one
woman to the noses of others nearby. Hormones com
pete, and the dominant female wins. The surrounding
inferiors shift their menstrual cycles gradually until
they match the dominant woman.
If the victor is the alpha female, then I am the
omega female. Everyone else's pheromones interfere
with my cycle. Sometimes, I synchronize with my
friend Haps when I've only talked to her on the
phone. We joke about "phone pheromones" and mar
vel at the coincidence, but secretly, I believe my cir
cumstances are just that bad.
Other people make little red dots or stars or frowny

faces on their calendars to track
their time of the month. (Have I re
vealed the secrets of your subtle
markings? Sorry.) But my calendar
is clean and colorless, because I
don't have a time of the month. In
fact, I've found my predictions are
better when I look at other people's
calendars.
This is not as easy as it sounds. I
had a frustrating roommate who
was too proper to discuss anything
important.

"I don't talk about my grades," she would say. If I
mentioned money, she would change the subject with
horrified restraint. When some CS guy started pursu
ing her through the medium of tiny, elaborate origami
boxes, she kept a stiff upper lip. With this girl, men
struation was certainly not a viable subject of conver
sation.
Money, grades, even lover's origami that I under
stand. So she was civilized and secure. I had no busi
ness poking into her bank statements or transcripts or
gift drawer, voyeuristically satisfying though that
might have been.
But I would argue that information on her cycle
greatly affected me. I'm an omega, after all, and my
roommate was probably somewhere between alpha
and epsilon. For months on end, I tried to plan my
study schedule around anticipated PMS and cramps,
only to be foiled time and again by her dictatorial
body odors. And my cramps are worse when I'm off
schedule.
Pheromonal dominance lends an unfair advan
tage, and in a genetically egalitarian society, I feel
it's something we need to correct. Therefore, I sub
mit that all women should undergo a pheromone po
tency evaluation and carry identity cards to show
their results. Alpha women and beta down to psi
women as well should then be required to produce
at least a two-cycle record to any woman of lower
pheromone rank.
Doubtless, one day my kind will band together and
end this chemical tyranny. We'll demand pheromone
information and develop complex algorithms for
roommate selection, dorm assignments, seating charts
and countless other technological advancements.
With improvements in genetic testing, we'll even
tually be able to tag oppressors early on. For now,
though, I've figured out who the nearby culprits are.
Haps, Ley, Ducky and Peet: Show me the goddam
calendar. I have finals coming up.
