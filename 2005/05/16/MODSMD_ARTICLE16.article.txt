# Students Display Films at Spring Festival
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Feel like watching a drama? A mocku
mentary about a cappella groups? A fake
film-noir comedy about a dog private de
tective? The Stanford Film Society, or
SFS, will be showing these and over 20
other short films at its annual Student
Film Festival, which will run from this
Thursday through May 21 starting at 7:30
p.m. each night at Cubberley Auditorium.
Senior John Jackson, co-president of the
SFS, said more than 100 shorts have been
shown at the film festival over the last
four years.
Although the film and film studies
major will only be offered beginning next
year, budding filmmakers have a variety
of resources at their disposal to shoot
films for the festival from equipment
available at Meyer Library, the Stanford
Channel Broadcasting Network,
orSCBN, and SFS. An entirely student
run group, SFS sponsors several pro
grams designed to promote student film
making.
"The Student Filmmaker's Workshop
is a student-run course taught by The
Stanford Film Society, not for credit,
which instructs 18 students on the basics
of lighting, shooting, editing and sound
recording that go into film and video pro
duction," Jackson said. "It functions sole
ly in MiniDV video format, which at the
moment is the best quality for an afford
able price."
Several of the students participating in
the Student Filmmaker's Workshop end
the yearlong course by showing a 10-
minute short film at the Student Film Fes
tival. The Advanced Filmmaker's Work
shop, a more collaborative effort between
coordinators and students with prior film
making experience, is also sponsored by
the SFS.
So what does it take to produce a short
film? Senior Matt Dyer, a workshop coor
dinator for the SFS, said that the equip
ment necessary for shooting a film is read
ily available around campus.
"If you already have a camera, you can
shoot a film and edit it in a few hours," he
said. "But the people participating in the
workshops put a lot more time into it. Try
ing to do a large-scale production, for ex
ample, is much harder because you have
to work around the typical Stanford
schedules of your crew or actors."
The time necessary to produce a stu
dent film is certainly something student
filmmakers agreed was a large contstraint.
"Anyone who has tried to make a stu
dent film on campus can tell you that the
primary sacrifice of a filmmaker is time"
Jackson said. "The three major shoots for
my current short, 'Surviving,' all lasted
from around 10 p.m. until 4 a.m. As op
posed to many other creative outlets, film
requires more than your time it requires
that of your cast and crew as well, which
can be massive."
Junior Jimmy Mosqueda said that time
commitments ran beyond the time re
quired for shooting films.
"You also have to invest even more
time into post-production, which includes
editing and sound mixing," he said. "This
doesn't include the time you spend writ
ing the script, finding and organizing a
cast and crew, running rehearsals and all

these other things you might not think
about when you dedicate yourself to mak
ing a film. As for money, a student film
can cost anywhere from nothing to sever
al thousand dollars. Most of the films
playing at our festival cost several hun
dred dollars, with a few going way beyond
that."
Students can apply to get funding for
their films from the SFS Film Grant Pro
gram, which awards up to $500 to cover
the price of props, tapes and other costs.
Or. one can look for outside grants. Ac
tors for films are usually easier to find
many filmmakers use their own friends.
"People get really excited at the
prospect of acting, so it is never difficult to
find someone," Mosqueda said. "Of
course, if you want a really good actor,
most people look to the Drama Depart
ment on campus."
Others, like Dyer, took advantage of
outside resources. His short film, 'The
Motel Office,' will feature a professional
actor.
"Someone put a casting call online in
January, and a lot of actors showed up,"
he said. "More people than you'd expect
will work with you if you're upfront about
what you're doing and the fact that you
usually can't pay them.?

However, Dyer said he has to get
clearance from the Screen Actors Guild if
he plans on screening the short film in any
other festivals. Dyer said he plans on pur
suing a career in film, particularly in di
recting, and said that many Stanford stu
dents are interested in filmmaking.
"For example, over spring break the
SFS and the Stanford Alumni Entertain
ment Group collaborated to send 12 stu
dents to Los Angeles to tour the major
studios and offices there," he said. "We
spent three days driving around, talking
to alumni in the entertainment industry,
including alum Jay Roach, who directed
the 'Austin Powers' and 'Meet the Par
ents' series. I would say there are definite
ly people who are very focused on film
making as a career."
But he also agrees with Jackson, who
believes that the average student filmmak
er is one who has yet to decide on a career.
"Normally they love film. Many of them
create fiction through plays, poems or short
stories, and they want to try and see if they
can grasp film," Jackson said. "Most take
film courses, or at least one or two to grab a
footing, and SFS and the annual Film Festi
val give them the opportunity to test their
mettle at filmmaking. About half of those
who begin to make a short never finish, but

those who do have a strong grasp of how in
tense filmmaking is."
The Student Film Festival will also in
clude films accepted through the open
submission program, in which any stu
dent, faculty, or staff member who has
made a short while at Stanford can drop
off independent films. According to
Mosqueda, about a third of the films
shown at the festival are typically from
open submission.
"All genres are accepted, as long as the
films are 10 minutes or less," Dyer said.
"One year, a film was a 25-minute docu
mentary about the Stanford drug counter
culture that essentially featured one per
son, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The movie was 25 minutes of a blacked
out talking head."
Jackson, who spent the weekend fin
ishing "Better off Undead: A Zombie
Musical" for the festival, said that the Stu
dent Film Festival will include short films
from both beginning filmmakers and
"those want to have a career of some sort
in the film industry, the filmmakers who
spend well over 30 total hours shooting a
10-minute short." Both, he said, would
round out the festival.
"In the end," he said, "everyone is still
learning."

other festivals. Dyer said he plans on pur
suing a career in film, particularly in di
recting, and said that many Stanford stu
dents are interested in filmmaking.
"For example, over spring break the
SFS and the Stanford Alumni Entertain
ment Group collaborated to send 12 stu
dents to Los Angeles to tour the major
studios and offices there," he said. "We
spent three days driving around, talking
to alumni in the entertainment industry,
including alum Jay Roach, who directed
the 'Austin Powers' and 'Meet the Par
ents' series. I would say there are definite
ly people who are very focused on film
making as a career."
But he also agrees with Jackson, who
believes that the average student filmmak
er is one who has yet to decide on a career.
"Normally they love film. Many of them
create fiction through plays, poems or short
stories, and they want to try and see if they
can grasp film," Jackson said. "Most take
film courses, or at least one or two to grab a
footing, and SFS and the annual Film Festi
val give them the opportunity to test their
mettle at filmmaking. About half of those
who begin to make a short never finish, but

those who do have a strong grasp of how in
tense filmmaking is."
The Student Film Festival will also in
clude films accepted through the open
submission program, in which any stu
dent, faculty, or staff member who has
made a short while at Stanford can drop
off independent films. According to
Mosqueda, about a third of the films
shown at the festival are typically from
open submission.
"All genres are accepted, as long as the
films are 10 minutes or less," Dyer said.
"One year, a film was a 25-minute docu
mentary about the Stanford drug counter
culture that essentially featured one per
son, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The movie was 25 minutes of a blacked
out talking head."
Jackson, who spent the weekend fin
ishing "Better off Undead: A Zombie
Musical" for the festival, said that the Stu
dent Film Festival will include short films
from both beginning filmmakers and
"those want to have a career of some sort
in the film industry, the filmmakers who
spend well over 30 total hours shooting a
10-minute short." Both, he said, would
round out the festival.
"In the end," he said, "everyone is still
learning."

Feel like watching a drama? A mocku
mentary about a cappella groups? A fake
film-noir comedy about a dog private de
tective? The Stanford Film Society, or
SFS, will be showing these and over 20
other short films at its annual Student
Film Festival, which will run from this
Thursday through May 21 starting at 7:30
p.m. each night at Cubberley Auditorium.
Senior John Jackson, co-president of the
SFS, said more than 100 shorts have been
shown at the film festival over the last
four years.
Although the film and film studies
major will only be offered beginning next
year, budding filmmakers have a variety
of resources at their disposal to shoot
films for the festival from equipment
available at Meyer Library, the Stanford
Channel Broadcasting Network,
orSCBN, and SFS. An entirely student
run group, SFS sponsors several pro
grams designed to promote student film
making.
"The Student Filmmaker's Workshop
is a student-run course taught by The
Stanford Film Society, not for credit,
which instructs 18 students on the basics
of lighting, shooting, editing and sound
recording that go into film and video pro
duction," Jackson said. "It functions sole
ly in MiniDV video format, which at the
moment is the best quality for an afford
able price."
Several of the students participating in
the Student Filmmaker's Workshop end
the yearlong course by showing a 10-
minute short film at the Student Film Fes
tival. The Advanced Filmmaker's Work
shop, a more collaborative effort between
coordinators and students with prior film
making experience, is also sponsored by
the SFS.
So what does it take to produce a short
film? Senior Matt Dyer, a workshop coor
dinator for the SFS, said that the equip
ment necessary for shooting a film is read
ily available around campus.
"If you already have a camera, you can
shoot a film and edit it in a few hours," he
said. "But the people participating in the
workshops put a lot more time into it. Try
ing to do a large-scale production, for ex
ample, is much harder because you have
to work around the typical Stanford
schedules of your crew or actors."
The time necessary to produce a stu
dent film is certainly something student
filmmakers agreed was a large contstraint.
"Anyone who has tried to make a stu
dent film on campus can tell you that the
primary sacrifice of a filmmaker is time"
Jackson said. "The three major shoots for
my current short, 'Surviving,' all lasted
from around 10 p.m. until 4 a.m. As op
posed to many other creative outlets, film
requires more than your time it requires
that of your cast and crew as well, which
can be massive."
Junior Jimmy Mosqueda said that time
commitments ran beyond the time re
quired for shooting films.
"You also have to invest even more
time into post-production, which includes
editing and sound mixing," he said. "This
doesn't include the time you spend writ
ing the script, finding and organizing a
cast and crew, running rehearsals and all

these other things you might not think
about when you dedicate yourself to mak
ing a film. As for money, a student film
can cost anywhere from nothing to sever
al thousand dollars. Most of the films
playing at our festival cost several hun
dred dollars, with a few going way beyond
that."
Students can apply to get funding for
their films from the SFS Film Grant Pro
gram, which awards up to $500 to cover
the price of props, tapes and other costs.
Or. one can look for outside grants. Ac
tors for films are usually easier to find
many filmmakers use their own friends.
"People get really excited at the
prospect of acting, so it is never difficult to
find someone," Mosqueda said. "Of
course, if you want a really good actor,
most people look to the Drama Depart
ment on campus."
Others, like Dyer, took advantage of
outside resources. His short film, 'The
Motel Office,' will feature a professional
actor.
"Someone put a casting call online in
January, and a lot of actors showed up,"
he said. "More people than you'd expect
will work with you if you're upfront about
what you're doing and the fact that you
usually can't pay them.?

However, Dyer said he has to get
clearance from the Screen Actors Guild if
he plans on screening the short film in any
other festivals. Dyer said he plans on pur
suing a career in film, particularly in di
recting, and said that many Stanford stu
dents are interested in filmmaking.
