For freshman Carolyn Mansfield, a resident of Ju
nipero, earning $ 10 an hour is simply a matter of walking
to Residential Fellows Gavin Jones and Judy Richard
son's cottage to baby-sit their eight-month old daughter
Hazel.
"I like kids and it's an easy, convenient job that's not
too time consuming," Mansfield said. "Gavin and Judy
are really laidback employers."
Mansfield is one of five babysitters who watch Hazel
once a week for two hours.
"We spend a lot of time just hanging out and watching
'Bear in the Big Blue House' and going for walks," she
said.
Mansfield is just one of many Stanford students who
balances classes and clubs with part-time work, largely
for financial freedom and flexibility. The University of
fers a variety of employment opportunities ranging from
working as a research assistant to earning $75 a quarter
for taking notes for the Disability Resource Center.
Dining hall days
Perhaps, the most popular places of employment on
campus though are Stanford's dining halls and eateries.
Sophomore Esmeralda Fuentes, for instance, has
worked at Ricker Dining for $10.30 an hour, four and a
half hours a week, since fall quarter.
Fuentes said she took the job because she found it to

be "very convenient and because of
the money as well not only for
books but for all the shopping I
do," she joked.
She also gets a free meal
every time she works, which is a
big plus, considering the high
cost of meal plans on campus.
Despite the jobs perks, how
ever, Fuentes plans to look into
other job options on campus
next year.
"It's easy money because all I
do is swipe cards, but it's not

something I'll do again," she said.
"This year was more than enough. I

think it's good for the convenience but something more
fulfilling, or at least more interesting, would be better."
An Urban Studies major, Fuentes would like to find a
job that relates to her major to build up her resume and
build experience.
"I really like tutoring," she said. "Right now 1 do it as
a volunteer, but I could get work study for that. I'm prob
ably going to be a coordinator for Habla La Noche next
year too and that could also be my part-time job."
Movie maven
Junior Katie Gillum has already been able to find a
job that caters to her interests through working with
movies at Media Microtext in Green Library.

Gillum
took the

job two years
ago because "I
needed money and because I like making and watching
movies."
She found out about working at Media Microtext
from a friend she met the summer before sophomore
year.
"I was in the Sophomore College film theory class and
one of the other kids knew that they were hiring at the
beginning of the quarter," she said.
So far, Gillum has found the job to be very fulfilling.
Because of her position as a resident assistant. Gillum

currently works six hours a week as opposed to the 10 to
12 that she worked last year. Because she works on
weekends, she gets paid $11 an hour as opposed to the
usual $10.30.
In addition to checking movies in and out, Gillum has
to deal with students who are trying to get tapes for the
course Development in a Global Environment, or
EDGE, at the last minute or those who are trying to get


JAIREH TECCARO/The Stanford Daily
tapes on reserve. One drawback of
the job that Gillum noted was that it
was "hard to (work enough) hours
because they're given on the basis of
seniority and merit," the latter which
is decided subjectively.
Additionally, she said that some
times the students checking out
DVDs can be difficult to deal with.
"The hardest thing about the job is
that some people come in and expect
it to be a Hollywood Video with mul
tiple copies of each title," she said.
Gillum noted, however, that
some of the job's special benefits re
ally outweigh the cons.
"It's really awesome to have ac
cess to movies and flat-screen TVs,"
she said. "It's also nice to be able to
do my (school) work during the job."
A fishy job
Freshman David Villafranca
took on an unusual job at the Talbot
lab, a research lab looking at Ze
brafish genetics. Since March, Vil
lafranca has performed two-hour
shifts of feeding fish and changing
the water of the lab?s 200-plus tanks
for $12 an hour. Villafranca works
ten hours a week.

"It's probably the most disgusting
job I've ever had," remarked Vil
lafranca. But Villafranca admits that it
pays more than other campus jobs and
enjoys "having my own financial free
dom." As a result, he said he'll proba
bly continue working there next year.
Villafranca heard about the job
from a friend, freshman Stepanie
Oberfoell, who has worked at the lab
since February.
Oberfoell used to always perform
the same tasks as Villafranca but
now sometimes works in the upstairs
part of the lab as well where she does
genetic screenings of the fish DNA
in yeast cells. She said she prefers
this work to that required in the
basement of the "fishery."
"We feed them fried shrimp that
smells like vomit and the fish tanks
have maggots covering them," she
said. "Also, the room is kept at 85
degrees Fahrenheit and feels like it
has 100 percent humidity."
For both jobs at the lab, Ober
foell and Villafranca have the bene
fits of getting to listen to their music
while they work and basically mak
ing their own hours.
"It's disgusting, but it brings
home the bread," Oberfoell said.
Putting tech skills to the test
As Web Content Monitor and a
member of the support staff at El
Centro Chicano, Carlos Ortiz's job

gives him the flexibility of being able
to work from his room when updat
ing El Centra's Web site.
Having worked at El Centro
Chicano since November 2003,
Ortiz works between 10 and 20
hours a week for $12.50 an hour.
He found the job through the Ca
reer Development Center his
freshman year.
" I just needed a job and there was
an opening," he said.
The amount of work usually
varies for Ortiz, and as "the tech
guy" he does everything from ar
ranging the sound and light systems
for special events to helping set-up
and clean-up for Cinco de Mayo, for
example.
"Some of it's just being at the
front desk and being in the office,
and doing what needs to be done,"
he said.
One aspect of Ortiz's job at the
center, which he said he particularly
enjoys, is the social atmosphere.
"The people who work at the cen
ter are very involved and committed
to what they do," he said. "I really
like working with them because it
just rubs off on me."
Overall, Ortiz said he likes his
job.
"I just like having a job and being
able to have my own dispensable in
come. The office is a lot of fun and 1
like to be informed about what's
going on at El Centro Chicano."
