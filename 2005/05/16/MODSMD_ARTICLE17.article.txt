For freshman Carolyn Mansfield, a resident of Ju
nipero, earning $ 10 an hour is simply a matter of walking
to Residential Fellows Gavin Jones and Judy Richard
son's cottage to baby-sit their eight-month old daughter
Hazel.
"I like kids and it's an easy, convenient job that's not
too time consuming," Mansfield said. "Gavin and Judy
are really laidback employers."
Mansfield is one of five babysitters who watch Hazel
once a week for two hours.
"We spend a lot of time just hanging out and watching
'Bear in the Big Blue House' and going for walks," she
said.
Mansfield is just one of many Stanford students who
balances classes and clubs with part-time work, largely
for financial freedom and flexibility. The University of
fers a variety of employment opportunities ranging from
working as a research assistant to earning $75 a quarter
for taking notes for the Disability Resource Center.
Dining hall days
Perhaps, the most popular places of employment on
campus though are Stanford's dining halls and eateries.
Sophomore Esmeralda Fuentes, for instance, has
worked at Ricker Dining for $10.30 an hour, four and a
half hours a week, since fall quarter.
Fuentes said she took the job because she found it to

be "very convenient and because of
the money as well not only for
books but for all the shopping I
do," she joked.
She also gets a free meal
every time she works, which is a
big plus, considering the high
cost of meal plans on campus.
Despite the jobs perks, how
ever, Fuentes plans to look into
other job options on campus
next year.
"It's easy money because all I
do is swipe cards, but it's not

something I'll do again," she said.
"This year was more than enough. I

think it's good for the convenience but something more
fulfilling, or at least more interesting, would be better."
An Urban Studies major, Fuentes would like to find a
job that relates to her major to build up her resume and
build experience.
"I really like tutoring," she said. "Right now 1 do it as
a volunteer, but I could get work study for that. I'm prob
ably going to be a coordinator for Habla La Noche next
year too and that could also be my part-time job."
Movie maven
Junior Katie Gillum has already been able to find a
job that caters to her interests through working with
movies at Media Microtext in Green Library.

Gillum
took the

job two years
ago because "I
needed money and because I like making and watching
movies."
She found out about working at Media Microtext
from a friend she met the summer before sophomore
year.
"I was in the Sophomore College film theory class and
one of the other kids knew that they were hiring at the
beginning of the quarter," she said.
So far, Gillum has found the job to be very fulfilling.
Because of her position as a resident assistant. Gillum

currently works six hours a week as opposed to the 10 to
12 that she worked last year. Because she works on
weekends, she gets paid $11 an hour as opposed to the
usual $10.30.
In addition to checking movies in and out, Gillum has
to deal with students who are trying to get tapes for the
course Development in a Global Environment, or
EDGE, at the last minute or those who are trying to get
