On Saturday United Students for Veterans'
Health, or USVH, celebrated a year of accomplish
ments with guest performances, carnival games, art
projects, photo booths, snow cones and raffle prizes.
The event also showcased musical and dance
groups from Stanford and Palo Alto High School.
According to senior Jacky Hoang, the direc
tor of the Stanford Chapter of USVH, the event
was designed to provide a"day of pure fun for
the veterans."
Members of USVH, a student-run community
service group, volunteer weekly at the Menlo Park
Veteran's Hospital. Leaders of USVH said they
hope to build connections between Stanford stu
dents and veterans.
Founded in IW4, USVH has since established
twelve chapters at peer institutions, including
UCLA, Oregon Episcopal, Duke and Santa Clara
University.
Approximately 70 Stanford students spend 2

hours each week with patients in the geriatric and
psychiatric wards. Stanford students are paired with
veterans, with whom they build a strong relation
ship over time, Hoang said, adding that students are
like "one-on-one personal therapists" and even
keep log notebooks.
While forging a connection with older veterans
— the average age is 75 — may seem challenging
for most Stanford students, Hoang said she views it
as a "chance to see a friend every week".
Senior Kenny Gundle. the national director of
USVH, said that "volunteers brighten up the hos
pital and bring a lot of energy to the lives of these
veterans."
Gundle regularly speaks at conferences
around the nation and recently starred in a movie
called "A Million Reasons to Volunteer," which is
sometimes shown during Orientation Weekend to
inspire freshman to get involved with community
service.
The Department of Veterans Affairs' Voluntary
Services Office, which coordinates volunteer activi
ties throughout all veterans affairs hospitals, recent

ly released "Living Memories: Reflections of Stu
dents Volunteering in VA Hospitals," a book of es
says by USVH student volunteers.
Gundle said he is thrilled with the assistance
UVSH has received from the Department of Vet
erans Affairs.
"People have been incredibly supportive of our
mission," he said.
Some students say that USVH has changed their
outlooks on life.
"Dealing with life-threatening problems puts
things into perspective for me and helps me to pri
oritize what is important in my life," Hoang said.
"The issues that veterans deal with are much more
important that what students normally worry about,
like what they got on their bio midterm."
USVH and the Menlo Park veterans affairs hos
pital were recently recognized by Stanford's Office
of Public Affairs with the 2005 Community Part
nership Award. The award recognizes individuals
and programs that benefit the local community and
represent successful partnerships between Stanford
and its neighbors.
