## Editorial On health care, undergrads should take lead from grads 
### 
While undergraduates generally think
little about health care and insurance
costs, rising health care costs nationwide
with no end in sight — may put the
issue at the forefront on future students'
minds.
Many employers have begun restrict
ing insurance coverage to dependents
under the age of 19. That means more un
dergraduates will have to pay to receive
Cardinal Care coverage, and as insurance
becomes more expensive it will become
an extra financial burden on already ex
pense-overwhelmed students and their
families.
Graduate students who typically rely
on Cardinal Care for insurance have been
grappling with this issue for years. Under
graduates need to take a page out of the
Graduate Student Council's book and
begin looking into unique solutions to the
health care issue. The graduate student
community formed a taskforce to look
into this issue and have continually cham
pioned health care costs as one of the
most important issues facing graduate
students. Meanwhile undergraduates, in
cluding the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate, have neglected the issue. It is time for
that to change.
It is particularly important for the un
dergraduate student body to become in
formed on health care costs and insurance
before the problem becomes as pervasive
as it is among graduate students. This
issue is one of the more complicated is
sues facing the country — and there is no
consensus on the issue. The tandem of
more expensive prescription drugs, ever

improving technology, a more litigious so
ciety and an older population are forcing
up health care costs. It will take time for
undergraduates to become informed on
the issue even before a debate can begin
as to the proper solution.
The first step should be for the ASSU
to ask the Graduate Health Care Task
Force if it would be possible for under
graduates to sit in on meetings to begin
understanding the different faucets of the
issue. The graduate students have done
in-depth research on the issue and would
provide the best foundation for under
graduates to begin exploring the issue.
Particularly, the issues facing under
graduates are similar enough to graduate
student issues with medical costs that re
sources can and should be shared. With
both sides of the student body working on
the issue, it will assume even greater im
portance among University administra
tors.
It is true that graduate students face
some issues that are more complicated
than the issues facing the average under
graduate, including spouses and children.
However the general issues are similar
enough that there is room for collabora
tion.
While health care costs have rarely
made it on the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate radar, hopefully the new ASSU
executives will change that. They should
make it one of their key planks of their up
coming agenda. The rising cost of health
care is an issue on the nation's agenda,
and Stanford undergrads need to realize it
will soon be an issue for them, too.
