# Web site calls for divestment
## STAND posts petition for divestment online 
### LAURA CARWILE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students Taking Action Now: Darfur, or
STAND, the student group lobbying the Uni
versity to divest from companies that support
the current Sudanese government, launched
its Web site last week to further its efforts. Vis
itors are asked to sign a petition pressing the

Stanford Board of Trustees to vote to divest
from comparties PetroChina, ABB Ltd.,
Sinopec and Taftnet and requesting that the
Stanford Management Company investigate
the records of other companies the University
invests in that deal through Sudan.
The Web site states that "U.S.-based com
panies are not permitted to do business in the
Sudan because of the egregious crimes com
mitted by the Khartoum regime." However,
foreign companies that are traded in U.S. mar
kets are still allowed to do business there.
"Stanford is invested in companies that are
complicit in the genocide through their finan

cial support of and continued relationship with
the Sudanese government," the Web site
claims.
STAND member Ben Elberger, a junior,
said the purpose of the Web site is to raise
awareness of the situation in Darfur not only
among students and professors on campus,
but also alumni and parents who do not see the
group's more visible demonstrations.
He added that the site's goal is to "give peo
ple an avenue through which to tell Stanford
to divest and take a substantive stand on the
genocide in Darfur."
STAND members said they be
lieve that if enough students protest in
vestments in Sudan, the University
will consider taking action.
The petition included on the web
site will eventually be sent to the
Board of Trustees, the only governing
body with the power to divest from the
companies in question; the Special
Committee on Investment Responsi
bility; and the Stanford Management
Company, which controls how Stan
ford's endowment is invested.
"This is very much a solid step for

ward," said sophomore Nikki Serapio,
one of STAND'S leaders. "It's impor
tant to remember that divestment
works, as evidenced by the case of
Apartheid [in] South Africa."
He added that Stanford has a
unique opportunity to galvanize ad
ministrators at other institutions to di
vest.
"If a considerable number of uni
versities and state public pension
funds divested their Sudan holdings,
this would deprive the Khartoum
regime of revenues which they use to
carry out this genocide," Serapio said.
"What's more, nationwide divestment
will send a strong, concrete message to
Congress and the Bush administra
tion."
Sophomore Elissa Test, co
founder ol STAND, said that with the

support of many Stanford students the
group was ready to take action.
"We decided that we cannot afford
to wait for the slow bureaucratic
process to run its course in making a
decision," she said. "We felt that we
needed to put the pressure on the
Stanford administration to make a de
cision about divestment. We are trying
to make it loud and clear that we, and
over a thousand other students, facul
ty, and community members, do not
want our dollars supporting a murder
ous regime."
In addition to the Web site,
STAND has sponsored and co-spon
sored various events including a one
day fast, a donation drive at a screen
ing of "Hotel Rwanda" and several
letter-writing campaigns to members
of Congress.
