First off, isn't that a
great title fora column? It
rhymes, which is terribly
witty and intelligent. Of
course, I didn't come up
with it myself, but it's the
plagiarism that counts.
Every so often one
stumbles across little jour
nalistic pearls extolling
the "newly discovered'

cool of the geek — the most recent one I've
seen is in the current issue of Current maga
zine.
Incidentally, for those of you who don't
know, the cleverly titled Current magazine is
an ambitious extension of the campus maga
zine — instead of not being read by the just
the students at a single university, it aims not
to be read by students all over the country.
Back to business: 1 find this occasional
nerd idolizing rather entertaining. Largely, of
course, because it's an elaborate fantasy. No
right-minded person thinks geeks are cool. In
fact the word "geek" is meant to convey the
very essence of uncool and along with it ap
propriate levels of scorn and derision.
What's more, geekiness is unattractive.
When faced with a choice between someone
with an encyclopedic knowledge of "Buffy,
the Vampire Slayer" mythology and some
one with a bicep, most people will choose the
bicep.
On the other hand, most people are idiots,
so Buffy fans shouldn't lament too much —
you're just attracting a better quality of intel
lect (well maybe not. but you can dream).
Actually, this week is a very special one in
the nerd world. The final (until the billion dol
lar revenue becomes too much to resist) "Star
Wars" film is coming out. And this has many
folks filled with anticipatory excitement.
Now. such anticipation is understandable
in small children, but 1 do find the levels of en
thusiasm amongst my peers a little strange.
It's all very well for grade-schoolers to get
worked up. but the single-minded obsession
of a 27-year-old graduate student is a tad odd.

As fascinating as Anakin's descent into
the "dark side" is. I find it hard to fathom the
hours that so-called grown-ups can spend
trawling the Internet for the latest update on
the particular facial expression that's going to
ruin scene No. 23.
It's when the quality of the analysis ap
proaches that of a real world discussion that I
truly start to worry. There's something partic
ularly disturbing about overhearing a serious
conversation on the strategic errors of the
Jedi Council and what alternative courses of
action should have been taken (apparently
invading Iraq was a mistake).
Of course, the new film also means that
Lucas's elaborate universe is coming to an
end, topping off a rough few weeks for the
geeks. Fans also have had to come to terms
with the tragic departure of "Star Trek" from
our television screens. It's a veritable cull, and
1 have a horrible feeling that miserable geeks
are going to be even more irritating than ex
cited ones.
Standards at Stanford are different from
those out on the mean streets, where there's
less of the "be yourself" nonsense, and more
of a "get a life" attitude. This, in turn, makes
it much easier to retreat into fantasy worlds
on the Farm.
Fantasy worlds are a powerful tool, and I
spend many hours contemplating what it
would be like to live in one. However, during
the occasional moment of clarity, 1 do some
times wonder if perhaps the desperate claw
ing at any means of escape is indicative of
deeper problems.
Still, while the need to immerse oneself in
the minutiae of light sabers and intergalactic
politics is probably a sign of either serious
mental problems or rapidly disappearing so
cial skills, sometimes resistance is futile. May
the Force be with you.
/ know the hist sentence was groan-worthy, my
apologies, I couldn 't help myself — I'm a geek.
E-mail me at navins@stanford.edu if you want
to start an extended discussion on the finer
points of Huffy mythology.
