Why keep the filibuster?

1 know Kalani Leifer, I respect him, but
his last article ("Filibustering for the fili
buster," May 13) had its facts wrong. First of
all, when Strom Thurmond filibustered the
Civil Rights Act. he was a Democrat. This is
a point of fact.
Historically, it was the 20-some members
of the Democratic Southern Caucus who
used the filibuster to block every piece of
civil rights legislation for eighty years, even
though they consistently had the support of
the majority of the House and Senate.
In view of this egregious use of the fili
buster. which denied equal rights to a large

percentage of the population for many
years, I challenge Leifer to name a single
instance in which the filibuster has served
this country well ("Mr. Smith goes to
Washington" notwithstanding). Just one
instance in which a modern day man would
say, "Damn, I'm glad we have the fili
buster." I can't name such an instance, and
1 doubt he can either. 1 know his article,
while high on theoretical ideas, didn't
name any cases. Surely in the past 200
years, the filibuster has done some good.
And if it hasn't, why not eliminate it?
