# A 						break from the bubble
## Does alcohol equal fun? 
### 
This past weekend, 1 partied it up with my
cousins and their friends in L.A. Being the
bailers that they are, we rode around the city
in a huge stretch limo, had our own room at
the club we went to and shared four bottles
of booze (including two "family-sized"
literally, in this case — bottles of Grey
Goose) among the nine of us.
Yet. despite what on paper constituted an
amazing time, looking back on the night, I re
ally didn't have all that much fun. Alcohol
was the focal point of the evening, with any
other activities decidedly ancillary to en
gagement with the bottle. 1 came away from
the night feeling skeptical of how healthy our
generation's attachment to booze is.
1 was talking recently to a fellow student
who suggested that alcohol is. in fact, quite
crucial to having a good time. He expressed
concern that Stanford might follow Berke
ley's lead in banning alcohol in fraternities
after the hazing incident that took place
there. He lamented that if that were to hap
pen, Stanford would stop being a fun school.
As it is, he said, the campus is no longer
what "used to make it Stanford" — said with
special emphasis on "Stanford" — ever
since alcohol was banned in freshman dorms.
The inference behind this was that if Stan
ford continues toward drier policies, its pop
ulation of fun students will also dry up.

Who knew that world
class academics, a top Di
vision 1 sports program,
an incredibly diverse and
vibrant student commu
nity and an absurdly hos
pitable living environ
ment weren't enough to
attract students. No — a
liberal alcohol policy is
really what people should
care about.

Now. I would be a hypocrite if I didn't
admit that since my 21st birthday earlier this
quarter, I too have had my fair share (and
possibly more than my fair share) of "fun."
Nevertheless. 1 abstained from alcohol all of
last year and still managed to have at least
enough fun to be willing to come back for an
other year. And sure, alcohol often can make
a night out more fun — but it shouldn't be
the defining aspect of the evening.
For whatever reason, many in our gen
eration have become overly reliant on alco
hol for, as my former RA once put it. "so
cial lubrication." We are becoming inured
to the alarming preponderance of alcohol
abuse and health problems related from
binge drinking. It seems easy when we're
young to distance ourselves from alco
holism and liver problems, but habits creat-

Ed now can be hard to undo, and many al
coholics first develop their addictions in
college.
Despite this, the solution is not to insti
tute dry policies in dorms or across campus.
Instead, we should each individually con
sider how much of having a good time is de
termined by our level of sobriety. Chances
are. if you can't have fun sober, you should
find something else to be doing in the first
place.
The goal should be to develop collegiate
culture where having fun can take a num
ber of forms, only one of which is indulging
in alcohol. As unlikely as it may sometimes
seem, having a blood alcohol level above
.08 is not the only way to have an enjoyable
evening. If nothing else, consider the ad
vantages of staying sober: You can remem
ber just what you did last night, the likeli
hood you drunk-dial someone is pretty slim
and — most importantly — you can drive
yourself to Jack in the Box to cure those
post-party munchies.

Studies. I'he same Irish Catholic genes that
blessed him with high alcohol tolerance also give
him a predilection for guilt and repentance, so if
