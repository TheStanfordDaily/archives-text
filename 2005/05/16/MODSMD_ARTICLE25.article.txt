## Civility in the Israel-Palestine debate 
### RANIA ELTON TANYA HAJ-HASSAN 
On Thursday, May 12. a group of Stan
ford students clad in white joined in a circle
around a Palestinian Hag covered with flow
ers on the lawn between the claw and bird
cage in White Plaza. The goal was to give stu
dents the chance to freely discuss Nakba Day
("The Palestinian Catastrophe") and reflect
on what Palestine means to them. In the spir
it of respect and dialogue, the event gave the
chance for concerned students to express
their feelings about the Israel-Palestine con
flict without disrupting the celebration of
others.
The impetus behind the formation of this
circle was the lunch-time celebration of Israeli
Independence Day. In The Daily article cov
ering this event ("Israel Pride Week marches
on," May 13). the coordinators of the Inde
pendence Day event "stressed that this cele
bration was meant to be purely cultural." yet
the event honors the day in which Israel was
created on the land of the indigenous Pales
tinian people who lived there. On Israeli Inde
pendence Day 57 years ago, the mass migra

tion of Jews forced two-thirds of the Palestini
an population (just under a million people at
the time) to he displaced from their homes, led
to the complete destruction of over 4(H) Pales
tinian villages by Zionist forces and caused
countless Palestinian deaths.
Students who joined the circle expressed
no opposition to the celebration of Israeli
culture. Rather, they came to express their
frustration with the clear political under
tones inherent in such a celebration. Israel is
defined just as much by the 5 million Jews
that now inhabit the land as the 5 million
Palestinians that are refugees because of its
creation (which constitutes two-thirds of all
refugees worldwide), or the more than I mil
lion Palestinians who live in the Jewish state
as second-class citizens.
Moreover, Israel currently occupies the
Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. The Palestinians suffer unbear
able injustice under intense Israeli military
occupation, including house demolitions, in
hibited freedom of movement, impover
ished living conditions, overcrowding, limit
ed water resources, extended curfews and
arbitrary killings bv the Israeli army.

None of this was mentioned during Thurs
day's celebration. The sad reality is that sup
porters of Israel have failed to acknowledge
the tragedy wrought on generations of Pales
tinians who were expelled from their homes
during Israel's War of Independence.
The participants in the Circle for Pales
tine were there to remember these forgotten
Palestinians, who suffer mistreatment to this
day, and to remind people that peace re
quires supporters of Israel to acknowledge
the injustice that was perpetrated against the
Palestinians at the time of Israel's creation.
I he organizers of the circle chose to foster
dialogue in a respectful manner. Steering
clear of disrupting the event by staging a
loud counter-rally with signs just feet away
from the celebration, advocates for Pales
tinian rights chose the high road of respect,
tolerance and dialogue. We hope that the
tone ol discourse on this topic can move in
this direction in the future.
