## Fade into Bolivian Five moments, four great years

Following Vikings running hack Onterrio
Smith's admission that he carries around a
fake penis for his cousin (Imagine how
happy the Whizzinator Corporation must be
right now; you can't buy publicity like that. The
Whizzinator Corporation proudly offers dildos
in white, tan. Latino, brown and black for the in
terested consumer,), it is now time to count
down my live most memorable sports memo
ries from my time on the Farm (Enjoy the non
sequitur? Good, so did I.).
The rules of this countdown are pretty sim
ple — to be nominated for inclusion on this list,
the sporting event must first have been contest
ed during my four years at Stanford, and sec
ond, I must have attended and enjoyed that
event.
No. 5 — Tony Giovacchini
Shocks the World
Stanford was trailing Oregon 78-75 with
mere seconds left on the clock, and everybody

in Maples Pavilion knew that
Casey Jacobsen would at
tempt to send the game into
overtime. However, with the
Ducks defense putting the
clamp on Casey, senior point
guard Tony Giovacchini
(having successfully convert
ed zero field goal attempts on
the night despite being promi
nently featured on the 2001-

2002 Cardinal men's basketball poster) found
himself four feet behind the arc, ball in hand
with four seconds remaining on the game clock.
Expecting the worst, the 6th Man Club collec
tively moaned in agony as Giovacchini released
his miracle shot from the corner. Somehow, in a
completely improbable way, the shot found the
bottom of the net, forced overtime, and the
Card went on to win the game, 90-87.
No. 4 — 2004 NCAA Men's Water Polo
Final: UCLA vs. Stanford
This is a game which GoStanford.com de
scribes as "the most emotional, highly dramatic,
tense, nerve-wracking championship game in
the long history of the NCAA Men's Water
Polo Championship." To this writer, that seems
like a fairly apt description of a double-over
time thriller that found the Cardinal down two
goals with nary a minute left in regulation. Stan
ford's Tony Azevedo, who had been held score
less to that point, put the biscuit in the basket as
he scored the equalizer with 21 seconds remain
ing in the match to force the first overtime.
While Stanford fell by one goal, 10-9, this game
still stands out.
No. 3 — 2002 Stanford Cross Country
National Champions
In 2003, the Stanford Men's XCTeam would
win the NCAA title with the largest margin of
victory ever, completely spanking Wisconsin on
the frozen tundra of Waterloo, la. Yet, what
made the 2002 Championship more memorable
was the anguish that the Cardinal had felt fol
lowing a demoralizing one-point loss to Col
orado in the 2001 Championship. One year
later. The Machine found itself as the newly
crowned NCAA Champions, standing proudly
on the podium in Terre Haute, Ind.
No. 2 — Nick Robinson with
"The Shot-Part II"
