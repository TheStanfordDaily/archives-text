# Softball drops a set but still wins Pac-10
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
For 13 consecutive innings, the
Cardinal offense looked lost against
No. 3 Arizona. Then, down 3-0 in the
seventh inning Saturday's regular sea
son finale, Stanford finally found its
groove, loaded the bases and scored
two runs.
While the Cardinal eventually ran
out of outs, falling to the Wildcats 3-2,
the squad still found a happy ending
15 minutes after Saturday's game was
over — the No. 4 Cardinal earned a
share of the Pacific-10 Conference
title for the first time in sch(X)l history.
Stanford finished 40-14 and 13-8 in
league play, the Cardinal's best con
ference record ever.
Stanford entered the Arizona se
ries in a tie for first place in the confer
ence, and despite its two losses this
weekend, earned a share of the crown
with Arizona, Oregon State and Cali
fornia. In addition to the Pac-10 title,
the squad also celebrated its departing
seniors.
"It wasn't that bad," senior catcher
Leah Nelson said of possibly ending
her time at Boyd and Jill Smith Fami
ly Stadium with a loss. "Every game is
going to be tough in the Pac-10... I
just know the season's not over, so it's
not too bad."
Stanford was named the No. 6
overall seed in the NCAA Softball
Championship and will face Robert
Morris (29-20-1) this Friday in
Columbia, Mo. Missouri and South
ern Illinois are also in the Cardinal's
Regional.
On Friday, Arizona moved toward

a season sweep of Stanford with a
close 1-0 win. Cardinal freshman
pitcher Becky McCullough took the
circle in front of a large crowd and
pitched well, scattering 10 hits. But er
rors, deflected balls and the lack of
timely hitting handed her the loss.
The Wildcats' star pitcher, Alicia
Hollowell, dominated the Stanford of
fense, recording easy out after easy
out. The righty allowed only three hits
in her 16th shutout of the season.
While Arizona's leadoff hitter
reached base in five innings, the Wild
cats were also unable to string togeth
er hits. One run in the third would
prove to be enough, however. With
Caitlin Lowe at second following a
single. Jackie Coburn lofted one over
the head of McCullough into shallow
centerfield and Lowe came in to score.
The Cardinal had two on in the sec
ond but failed to score. Stanford had
another chance with the top of the
order coming to the plate in the sixth,
but Hollowell pitched around the
threat.
Hollowell would also get out of a
jam in the second matchup. Leslie
Wolfe started for Arizona and held
the Cardinal scoreless through six in
nings. The typically loud bats of third
baseman Michelle Smith and short
stop Lauren Lappin were stifled
throughout the game.
"It's good strategy for [Arizona] to
throw Wolf," head coach John
Rittman added. "She's a different
type of pitcher than Hollowell — off
speed, a lot of drops. After seeing Hol
lowell last night, it was tough to adjust
