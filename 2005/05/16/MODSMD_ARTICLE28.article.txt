# Softball drops a set but still wins Pac-10
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
For 13 consecutive innings, the
Cardinal offense looked lost against
No. 3 Arizona. Then, down 3-0 in the
seventh inning Saturday's regular sea
son finale, Stanford finally found its
groove, loaded the bases and scored
two runs.
While the Cardinal eventually ran
out of outs, falling to the Wildcats 3-2,
the squad still found a happy ending
15 minutes after Saturday's game was
over — the No. 4 Cardinal earned a
share of the Pacific-10 Conference
title for the first time in sch(X)l history.
Stanford finished 40-14 and 13-8 in
league play, the Cardinal's best con
ference record ever.
Stanford entered the Arizona se
ries in a tie for first place in the confer
ence, and despite its two losses this
weekend, earned a share of the crown
with Arizona, Oregon State and Cali
fornia. In addition to the Pac-10 title,
the squad also celebrated its departing
seniors.
"It wasn't that bad," senior catcher
Leah Nelson said of possibly ending
her time at Boyd and Jill Smith Fami
ly Stadium with a loss. "Every game is
going to be tough in the Pac-10... I
just know the season's not over, so it's
not too bad."
Stanford was named the No. 6
overall seed in the NCAA Softball
Championship and will face Robert
Morris (29-20-1) this Friday in
Columbia, Mo. Missouri and South
ern Illinois are also in the Cardinal's
Regional.
On Friday, Arizona moved toward

a season sweep of Stanford with a
close 1-0 win. Cardinal freshman
pitcher Becky McCullough took the
circle in front of a large crowd and
pitched well, scattering 10 hits. But er
rors, deflected balls and the lack of
timely hitting handed her the loss.
The Wildcats' star pitcher, Alicia
Hollowell, dominated the Stanford of
fense, recording easy out after easy
out. The righty allowed only three hits
in her 16th shutout of the season.
While Arizona's leadoff hitter
reached base in five innings, the Wild
cats were also unable to string togeth
er hits. One run in the third would
prove to be enough, however. With
Caitlin Lowe at second following a
single. Jackie Coburn lofted one over
the head of McCullough into shallow
centerfield and Lowe came in to score.
The Cardinal had two on in the sec
ond but failed to score. Stanford had
another chance with the top of the
order coming to the plate in the sixth,
but Hollowell pitched around the
threat.
Hollowell would also get out of a
jam in the second matchup. Leslie
Wolfe started for Arizona and held
the Cardinal scoreless through six in
nings. The typically loud bats of third
baseman Michelle Smith and short
stop Lauren Lappin were stifled
throughout the game.
"It's good strategy for [Arizona] to
throw Wolf," head coach John
Rittman added. "She's a different
type of pitcher than Hollowell — off
speed, a lot of drops. After seeing Hol
lowell last night, it was tough to adjust

The No. 4 Cardinal dropped a pair of games this weekend to No. 3 Arizona, but still claimed
a share of the Pac-10 championship.
to her early. We finally got to her and
made them bring Hollowell in."
Though Smith finally got hot again
in the sixth, a leaping catch by the Ari
zona shortstop robbed freshman Erin
Howe of a base hit. The Cardinal fi
nally got going in the seventh against
Wolf. Megan Sickler opened up with a
leadoff double to deep left center.
Freshman Tricia Aggabao followed
with a clutch single past the second
baseman to bring in the run.
With the lead down to two runs,
the Wildcats made a pitching change.
After a strikeout, centerfielder Catali
na Morris hit a double into centerfield.
Lappin was walked to load the bases
and one out later the Cardinal scored
their second run thanks to a wild pitch
by Hollowell.
The 5-foot-2 Aggabao collided
with the 6-foot-1 Hollowell at the
plate, but jumped back up with a
pump of her fist. Hollowell struck out
the next batter and Stanford walked
away with another close loss.
"Any time you're in an opportuni
ty, and you're kids are battling back
when you're down three runs, you're
very proud of your players and the
way they battle," Rittnian said.
McCullough got more fly balls on
Saturday than Friday, and ground ball
errors were avoided as the battery
aimed fora different approach.
"[Friday] we went through more
dropped balls," Nelson said. "They
adjusted to that well so we thought
we'd throw them off today with some
different pitches - some rise balls and
screw balls to mix them up a little bit
and keep them on their toes."
McCullough was handed her sec
ond loss of the weekend as she was
tagged for two runs in the third.
Allyson Von Liechtenstein hit a ball
to left that rolled fora double and the
next batter, Lowe, launched one just
inside the right foul pole fora two-run
homer. Arizona scored an insurance
run, and the eventual game-winner, in
the sixth. Liechtenstein singled
through McCullough's legs, was
moved up on Lowe's perfect bunt and
scored on an RBI single by Coburn.
"[McCullough ] was throwing good
pitches, but they were making adjust
ments," Nelson said. "They've got
some of the best people in the country
on their team so it was difficult to get
them out. Caitlin Lowe scored from
second base on what would be a
blooper in normal circumstances. But
she's so fast that it's hard to defend
against that speed."
After Saturday's tilt, Stanford hon
ored its six seniors: Nelson. Sickler,
Michelle Thiry, Katherine Hoffman,
Elizabeth Bendig and Heather
Shook. While winning the conference
title is something this year's squad can
appreciate, it also has its eyes set on
something bigger: the Women's Col
lege World Series.
"It would be huge to go again,"
Sickler said two weeks ago. "It would
definitely be the best softball experi
ence ever."
So, is last year's WCWS appear
ance the best memory for this class
thus far?
"I have some good memories of
the World Series last year," Nelson
said. "But I'm hoping to make some
more."

she's so fast that it's hard to defend
against that speed."
After Saturday's tilt, Stanford hon
ored its six seniors: Nelson. Sickler,
Michelle Thiry, Katherine Hoffman,
Elizabeth Bendig and Heather
Shook. While winning the conference
title is something this year's squad can
appreciate, it also has its eyes set on
something bigger: the Women's Col
lege World Series.
"It would be huge to go again,"
Sickler said two weeks ago. "It would
definitely be the best softball experi
ence ever."
So, is last year's WCWS appear
ance the best memory for this class
thus far?
"I have some good memories of
the World Series last year," Nelson
said. "But I'm hoping to make some
more."
For 13 consecutive innings, the
Cardinal offense looked lost against
No. 3 Arizona. Then, down 3-0 in the
seventh inning Saturday's regular sea
son finale, Stanford finally found its
groove, loaded the bases and scored
two runs.
While the Cardinal eventually ran
out of outs, falling to the Wildcats 3-2,
the squad still found a happy ending
15 minutes after Saturday's game was
over — the No. 4 Cardinal earned a
share of the Pacific-10 Conference
title for the first time in sch(X)l history.
Stanford finished 40-14 and 13-8 in
league play, the Cardinal's best con
ference record ever.
Stanford entered the Arizona se
ries in a tie for first place in the confer
ence, and despite its two losses this
weekend, earned a share of the crown
with Arizona, Oregon State and Cali
fornia. In addition to the Pac-10 title,
the squad also celebrated its departing
seniors.
"It wasn't that bad," senior catcher
Leah Nelson said of possibly ending
her time at Boyd and Jill Smith Fami
ly Stadium with a loss. "Every game is
going to be tough in the Pac-10... I
just know the season's not over, so it's
not too bad."
Stanford was named the No. 6
overall seed in the NCAA Softball
Championship and will face Robert
Morris (29-20-1) this Friday in
Columbia, Mo. Missouri and South
ern Illinois are also in the Cardinal's
Regional.
On Friday, Arizona moved toward

a season sweep of Stanford with a
close 1-0 win. Cardinal freshman
pitcher Becky McCullough took the
circle in front of a large crowd and
pitched well, scattering 10 hits. But er
rors, deflected balls and the lack of
timely hitting handed her the loss.
The Wildcats' star pitcher, Alicia
Hollowell, dominated the Stanford of
fense, recording easy out after easy
out. The righty allowed only three hits
in her 16th shutout of the season.
While Arizona's leadoff hitter
reached base in five innings, the Wild
cats were also unable to string togeth
er hits. One run in the third would
prove to be enough, however. With
Caitlin Lowe at second following a
single. Jackie Coburn lofted one over
the head of McCullough into shallow
centerfield and Lowe came in to score.
The Cardinal had two on in the sec
ond but failed to score. Stanford had
another chance with the top of the
order coming to the plate in the sixth,
but Hollowell pitched around the
threat.
Hollowell would also get out of a
jam in the second matchup. Leslie
Wolfe started for Arizona and held
the Cardinal scoreless through six in
nings. The typically loud bats of third
baseman Michelle Smith and short
stop Lauren Lappin were stifled
throughout the game.
"It's good strategy for [Arizona] to
throw Wolf," head coach John
Rittman added. "She's a different
type of pitcher than Hollowell — off
speed, a lot of drops. After seeing Hol
lowell last night, it was tough to adjust

The No. 4 Cardinal dropped a pair of games this weekend to No. 3 Arizona, but still claimed
a share of the Pac-10 championship.
to her early. We finally got to her and
made them bring Hollowell in."
Though Smith finally got hot again
in the sixth, a leaping catch by the Ari
zona shortstop robbed freshman Erin
Howe of a base hit. The Cardinal fi
nally got going in the seventh against
Wolf. Megan Sickler opened up with a
leadoff double to deep left center.
Freshman Tricia Aggabao followed
with a clutch single past the second
baseman to bring in the run.
With the lead down to two runs,
the Wildcats made a pitching change.
After a strikeout, centerfielder Catali
na Morris hit a double into centerfield.
Lappin was walked to load the bases
and one out later the Cardinal scored
their second run thanks to a wild pitch
by Hollowell.
The 5-foot-2 Aggabao collided
with the 6-foot-1 Hollowell at the
plate, but jumped back up with a
pump of her fist. Hollowell struck out
the next batter and Stanford walked
away with another close loss.
"Any time you're in an opportuni
ty, and you're kids are battling back
when you're down three runs, you're
very proud of your players and the
way they battle," Rittnian said.
McCullough got more fly balls on
Saturday than Friday, and ground ball
errors were avoided as the battery
aimed fora different approach.
"[Friday] we went through more
dropped balls," Nelson said. "They
adjusted to that well so we thought
we'd throw them off today with some
different pitches - some rise balls and
screw balls to mix them up a little bit
and keep them on their toes."
McCullough was handed her sec
ond loss of the weekend as she was
tagged for two runs in the third.
Allyson Von Liechtenstein hit a ball
to left that rolled fora double and the
next batter, Lowe, launched one just
inside the right foul pole fora two-run
homer. Arizona scored an insurance
run, and the eventual game-winner, in
the sixth. Liechtenstein singled
through McCullough's legs, was
moved up on Lowe's perfect bunt and
scored on an RBI single by Coburn.
"[McCullough ] was throwing good
pitches, but they were making adjust
ments," Nelson said. "They've got
some of the best people in the country
on their team so it was difficult to get
them out. Caitlin Lowe scored from
second base on what would be a
blooper in normal circumstances. But
she's so fast that it's hard to defend
against that speed."
