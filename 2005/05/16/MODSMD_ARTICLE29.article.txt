# Water polo finishes second at NCAAs
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Going into this
weekend's NCAA Championship, the
Stanford women's water polo team knew
that strong play in the defensive end would
be critical to its success. Having limited op
ponents to an average of 4.30 goals per
game throughout the regular season, the
Cardinal entered the tournament as one of
the premier defensive teams in the nation.
With the NCAA title at stake, the Stan
ford defense lived up to its reputation and
delivered three of its finest performances of
the season. But even though each perfor
mance was more dramatic and more im
pressive than the last, it wasn't enough to
carry the Cardinal to their first national title
since 2001.
After inspired victories over Michigan
and Southern California, the Cardinal
couldn't knock off undefeated UCLA in
the title game despite holding the Bruins to
a mere three goals in a heart-wrenching 3-2
loss.
Sophomore goalie Meridith McColl
posted eight saves to keep the Cardinal in

the game and would have had more had it
not been for the Stanford field defense's sti
lling coverage.
"Any time you can hold a team with four
Olympians to three goals it's impressive,"
McColl said.
The Cardinal had the opportunity to tie
the game on a power play in the final sec
onds of regulation, but a UCLA intercep
tion crushed all Stanford hopes fora come
back.
Still, Stanford's march to the title game
was impressive.
The Cardinal opened their weekend
against tournament-host Michigan on Fri
day afternoon with a 7-2 win. After con
verting two power plays early on, senior
captain Hannah Luber's first tally of the
day gave the Cardinal a decisive 3-0 lead
going into the half.
Despite being forced to defend the six
on-five advantage 10 times over the course
of the game, the Cardinal defense dominat
ed the Michigan attack and surrendered
only two second-half goals. Luber complet
ed a hat-trick at 4:13 in the fourth period.
Saturday evening's semifinal match pit
ted Stanford against defending champion

Southern California. Two weeks ago, the
Cardinal pulled off an upset against the No.
2 Women of Troy at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament in com
manding fashion. With the memory of that
stunning upset fresh in their minds, the Car
dinal were eager to repeat their effort.
USC senior Eszter Gyori struck first for
the Women of Troy at 5:28 in the first peri
od. and junior Moriah van Norman built
the lead to two by capitalizing on a man-up
advantage assisted by sophomore Brittany
Hayes.
Despite falling behind early, the Cardi
nal didn't alter their game plans or defen
sive strategies. 112
"We were playing really well at that
point," sophomore Alison Gregorka said.
"They picked up a couple of goals off the
six-on-five, but other than that we were
pretty confident the way we were playing."
At 2:28 junior Laurel Champion found
junior captain Scotti Shafer open in the
middle of the pool fora shot that brought
the Cardinal back within one.
After the Women of Troy regained a
two-goal advantage in the second period,
the Cardinal defense tightened up and shut

down the USC attack for the remainder of
the half. With just over a minute remaining
in the second period, Luber, left unmarked
on the far side of the cage, screamed for
Shafer's attention as she cut toward the net.
Shafer sent the pass perfectly across the
middle and Hannah Luber sent a shot into
the back of the net.
The goal sent Stanford into the half with
the emotional momentum on its side. In the
second stanza, the defense picked up right
where it had left off, forcing two consecu
tive shot-clock turnovers.
At 5:11 in the third, Hansen sent a pow
erful skip shot into the left-hand side of the
cage to tie the score. The Cardinal surge
continued two minutes later when junior
Nancy El-Sakkary fired a shot toward the
low-right corner of the net. The ball de
flected of USC goalie Sarah Mix's hand
and bobbed across the line, bringing the
Stanford bench and fans to their feet with
a roar.

goal in two days. Assisted by Hewko
and Shafer, she managed to fake Mix
out of position and sent a soft lob into
the right of the cage to stretch the
Cardinal's lead to two.
After USC pulled to within one
and with the clock showing 20 sec
onds, Hewko was ejected, giving the
Women of Troy a six-on-five with a
chance to force overtime. For per
haps the tensest 15 seconds of the
season, the Cardinal worked to keep
a hand in the face of every shooter.
Finally, Hayes took a pass at the
low-right wing and pump faked
twice before firing off her last des

perate shot. The ball seemed des
tined for the back of the net before
McColl's arm shot up and deflected
it off the crossbar to clinch the 5-4
victory.
The win avenged the Women of
Troy's undefeated championship
campaign a year ago, and despite
their ultimate loss to UCLA in the
final, the Stanford women can look
back on their tournament effort and
see how much they proved. Were it
not fora restructured tournament
format that increased the NCAA
championship field from four teams
to eight, the Cardinal would not
have even had the opportunity to
play for the title.
Instead they finished as the tour
nament's runner-ups.
"All along we thought about it as
crashing the party," Luber said. "We

weren't even really supposed to be
here, but we ended up taking it all the
way to the last minute."
For twins Hannah and Kelty
Luber, the two senior members of the
team, yesterday's loss to UCLA
marked their final time suiting up for
the Cardinal. And walking away from
their collegiate careers with the mem
ories of this weekend, neither bears
any regret whatsoever.
"This was by far our favorite sea
son," Kelty said. "It was the most
thrilling, the best group of girls and
the most rewarding.
And with the beautiful ability to
take from any situation the most
valuable and positive perspective,
she added, "It didn't turn out the
way we wanted it to, but at the same
time we were able to make of it what
we wanted."

ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Going into this
weekend's NCAA Championship, the
Stanford women's water polo team knew
that strong play in the defensive end would
be critical to its success. Having limited op
ponents to an average of 4.30 goals per
game throughout the regular season, the
Cardinal entered the tournament as one of
the premier defensive teams in the nation.
With the NCAA title at stake, the Stan
ford defense lived up to its reputation and
delivered three of its finest performances of
the season. But even though each perfor
mance was more dramatic and more im
pressive than the last, it wasn't enough to
carry the Cardinal to their first national title
since 2001.
After inspired victories over Michigan
and Southern California, the Cardinal
couldn't knock off undefeated UCLA in
the title game despite holding the Bruins to
a mere three goals in a heart-wrenching 3-2
loss.
Sophomore goalie Meridith McColl
posted eight saves to keep the Cardinal in

the game and would have had more had it
not been for the Stanford field defense's sti
lling coverage.
"Any time you can hold a team with four
Olympians to three goals it's impressive,"
McColl said.
The Cardinal had the opportunity to tie
the game on a power play in the final sec
onds of regulation, but a UCLA intercep
tion crushed all Stanford hopes fora come
back.
Still, Stanford's march to the title game
was impressive.
The Cardinal opened their weekend
against tournament-host Michigan on Fri
day afternoon with a 7-2 win. After con
verting two power plays early on, senior
captain Hannah Luber's first tally of the
day gave the Cardinal a decisive 3-0 lead
going into the half.
Despite being forced to defend the six
on-five advantage 10 times over the course
of the game, the Cardinal defense dominat
ed the Michigan attack and surrendered
only two second-half goals. Luber complet
ed a hat-trick at 4:13 in the fourth period.
Saturday evening's semifinal match pit
ted Stanford against defending champion

Southern California. Two weeks ago, the
Cardinal pulled off an upset against the No.
2 Women of Troy at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament in com
manding fashion. With the memory of that
stunning upset fresh in their minds, the Car
dinal were eager to repeat their effort.
USC senior Eszter Gyori struck first for
the Women of Troy at 5:28 in the first peri
od. and junior Moriah van Norman built
the lead to two by capitalizing on a man-up
advantage assisted by sophomore Brittany
Hayes.
Despite falling behind early, the Cardi
nal didn't alter their game plans or defen
sive strategies. 112
"We were playing really well at that
point," sophomore Alison Gregorka said.
"They picked up a couple of goals off the
six-on-five, but other than that we were
pretty confident the way we were playing."
At 2:28 junior Laurel Champion found
junior captain Scotti Shafer open in the
middle of the pool fora shot that brought
the Cardinal back within one.
After the Women of Troy regained a
two-goal advantage in the second period,
the Cardinal defense tightened up and shut

down the USC attack for the remainder of
the half. With just over a minute remaining
in the second period, Luber, left unmarked
on the far side of the cage, screamed for
Shafer's attention as she cut toward the net.
Shafer sent the pass perfectly across the
middle and Hannah Luber sent a shot into
the back of the net.
The goal sent Stanford into the half with
the emotional momentum on its side. In the
second stanza, the defense picked up right
where it had left off, forcing two consecu
tive shot-clock turnovers.
At 5:11 in the third, Hansen sent a pow
erful skip shot into the left-hand side of the
cage to tie the score. The Cardinal surge
continued two minutes later when junior
Nancy El-Sakkary fired a shot toward the
low-right corner of the net. The ball de
flected of USC goalie Sarah Mix's hand
and bobbed across the line, bringing the
Stanford bench and fans to their feet with
