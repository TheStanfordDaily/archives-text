Last year, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team defeat
ed Quinnipiac and Michigan in the first and second rounds,
respectively, of the NCAA Championships, 4-0. In 2003, the
Cardinal topped Louisiana-Monroe and Michigan 4-0 en
route to the Sweet 16.
The results from 2002 and 2001 were just as intimidating.
So there was no mistaking the familiar feats of this year's
top-ranked squad (23-0), as it breezed past its opponents in
the first and second rounds of NCAAs, 4-0.
The Cardinal rolled over Army (23-5) at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium on Friday and continued their momentum in
a defeat of Oregon (17-8) on Saturday.
"The first two rounds are a building process for us," sopho
more Anne Yelsey said. "The teams we played this weekend
have really good lineups at the top, but toward the bottom
they kind of fade out."
Holding down the No. 6 singles slot, Yelsey allowed her
two challengers a grand total of one game.
The Black Knights' Lyndsey Nott was clearly outmatched
as she fell to Yelsey, 6-0,6-0. On Saturday, Yelsey made quick
work of the Ducks' Ester Bak, 6-1,6-0.
Yelsey's results were nearly identical to the other singles
matches that were completed. No Cardinal player allowed
her competitor more than one game per set.
Seventh-ranked Amber Liu, a junior, clinched Friday's
match for Stanford at the No. 1 singles spot. After taking the
first set, 6-1, Liu faltered only once, as Marissa Limsiaco
broke serve to tie the second set at one game apiece.
Liu quickly broke back and won the second set, 6-1.
At No. 5 singles, freshman Whitney Deason posted a 6-1,
6-1 victory and decided a team match of her own as she
downed Oregon's Anna Leksinksa on Saturday.
Deason, ranked No. 36, improved to 28-3 while
Leksinksa's season ended at a disappointing 12-20.
