Last year, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team defeat
ed Quinnipiac and Michigan in the first and second rounds,
respectively, of the NCAA Championships, 4-0. In 2003, the
Cardinal topped Louisiana-Monroe and Michigan 4-0 en
route to the Sweet 16.
The results from 2002 and 2001 were just as intimidating.
So there was no mistaking the familiar feats of this year's
top-ranked squad (23-0), as it breezed past its opponents in
the first and second rounds of NCAAs, 4-0.
The Cardinal rolled over Army (23-5) at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium on Friday and continued their momentum in
a defeat of Oregon (17-8) on Saturday.
"The first two rounds are a building process for us," sopho
more Anne Yelsey said. "The teams we played this weekend
have really good lineups at the top, but toward the bottom
they kind of fade out."
Holding down the No. 6 singles slot, Yelsey allowed her
two challengers a grand total of one game.
The Black Knights' Lyndsey Nott was clearly outmatched
as she fell to Yelsey, 6-0,6-0. On Saturday, Yelsey made quick
work of the Ducks' Ester Bak, 6-1,6-0.
Yelsey's results were nearly identical to the other singles
matches that were completed. No Cardinal player allowed
her competitor more than one game per set.
Seventh-ranked Amber Liu, a junior, clinched Friday's
match for Stanford at the No. 1 singles spot. After taking the
first set, 6-1, Liu faltered only once, as Marissa Limsiaco
broke serve to tie the second set at one game apiece.
Liu quickly broke back and won the second set, 6-1.
At No. 5 singles, freshman Whitney Deason posted a 6-1,
6-1 victory and decided a team match of her own as she
downed Oregon's Anna Leksinksa on Saturday.
Deason, ranked No. 36, improved to 28-3 while
Leksinksa's season ended at a disappointing 12-20.
While singles turned out to be a
wash, both Army and Oregon's dou
bles teams posed more of a threat.
"Oregon especially had tough
doubles teams," Yelsey said. "We
didn't take it for granted that we were
going to win."
Yelsey teamed up with Liu at No.
1 doubles to get the best of the Ducks'
No. 53 Dominika Dieskova and Daria
Panova (23-12), 8-4.
While the Oregon duo's mediocre
record may not suggest the best suc
cess, they took UCLA's No. 4 team of
Daniela Bercek and Riza Zalameda
to the brink in the regular season be
fore falling 8-6.
Stanford showcased the depth of
its lineup this weekend. Junior Joan
na Kao stepped up to play her second
team match of the year with No. 3
doubles partner, sophomore Theresa
Logar.
While the pair had previously

competed in individual tournaments
and notched a losing 1-4 record, Kao
and Logar defeated Oregon's Davina
Mendiburu and Bak, 8-5.
With seven starting players, the
Cardinal could have filled the No. 3
position any number of ways but head
coach Lele Forood gave Kao the nod.
"It was more of a strategic move,"
Yelsey said. "We've had a few injuries
this season and there was no point in
risking anyone's health at this point.
Having Joanna play for us was really
great and she helped pull out a big
win."
Kao's performance also drove the
message home to other schools that,
injuries or not, the Cardinal are as full
of potential as ever.
"We wanted to set the record
straight that we're doing fine and
we're just as solid as we were during
the Pac-10," Yelsey said,
Stanford will have a bit of time to
rest up before continuing its NCAA
run in Athens, Ga., this Thursday.
The Cardinal will face Harvard
(19-6) in the Round of 16 at Dan Mag
ill Tennis Complex. Match play is set
to begin at 9 a.m.
