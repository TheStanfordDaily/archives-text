# No. 21 Cardinal take two of three
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
When the No. 21 Cardinal (29-19,
10-8 Pacific-10 Conference) play
UCLA (13-35, 2-16), it almost al
ways seems to come down to the
final inning. Coming into this past
weekend's series at Sunken Dia
mond, four of the last six games the
teams had played were not decided
until the bottom of the ninth.
Though Stanford is the superior
team on paper, this weekend's
games were no exception to that
trend. Stanford scored three runs to
pull out a 3-2 victory in the final
frame on Friday, but was unable to
score in a similar situation on Satur
day and lost, 4-3.
But the dormant Stanford offense,
which has been a point of concern all
year, finally sparked to life in the third
game on Sunday, as the Cardinal
clinched the series with an 11-1 win.
"A lot of it is contagious, both
good and bad," head coach Mark
Marquess said of his team's hitting.
"A lot of times when you struggle,
it's like, 'Why is everyone struggling
at the same time?' Or, 'Why does ev
eryone hit at the same time?' There's
an element of relaxation, or whatev
er it may be. [Today,) everyone just
got into sync, feeling good about
themselves."
On Friday, the Stanford bats were
silenced through the first eight in
nings by UCLA ace Hector Ambriz,
who held the Cardinal to two hits
and allowed UCLA to take a 2-0 lead
into the ninth. But with the pressure
on and Ambriz tiring, the Stanford

offense came through. Sophomore
centerfielder Jim Rapoport led off
the inning with a single and junior
secondhaseman Jed Lowrie doubled
down the leftfield line two hatters
later to plate Rapoport and end Am
briz's shutout bid. Junior firstbase
man John Mayberry Jr. singled to
bring home Lowrie and advanced to
second when UCLA tried to throw
out Lowrie at the plate.
With two outs, junior catcher
John Hester broke the tie, doubling
home Mayberry to lift the Cardinal
to a 3-2 victory.
The Bruins got their runs across on
a fourth-inning homer by rightfielder
Chris Jensen and an RBI double by
first baseman Matt Sharp in the fifth.
Up until the final frame, Friday's
game was a classic pitcher's duel. Ju
nior Cardinal ace Jeff Gilmore (9-1)
tossed his second complete game of
the season, allowing only two runs
and seven hits. Ambriz finished the
game for UCLA, which seemed re
luctant to call upon its bullpen, and
perhaps for good reason â€” only one
of the Bruin relievers has an ERA
under 6.00 this season.
On Saturday, UCLA head coach
John Savage found himself in the po
sition to make a similar decision, but
this time he opted to go to the
bullpen. The decision paid off as re
liever Brian Shroeder squelched the
Cardinal rally.
Stanford trailed 4-3 heading into
the bottom of the ninth. With one out,
junior designated hitter Ben Summer
hays reached on an error by UCLA
first baseman Brett McMillan, his sec
ond in as many innings. Junior left

fielder Chris Lewis singled through the
right side, allowing senior pinch-run
ner Cameron Matthews to advance to
third with the potential tying run.
Shroeder, a lefty, replaced starter
Bryan Beck, who had allowed three
runs (two earned) through 8 1/ 3.
Shroeder struck out Rapoport on a
full count and got sophomore third
baseman Adam Sorgi to pop up to
end the inning.
Stanford junior starting pitcher
Mark Romanczuk (5-5) cruised
through the first six frames, allowing
only one run, but ran into trouble
with one out in the seventh when
Sorgi's throwing error allowed
UCLA designated hitter Mike Met

zger to reach base. Romanczuk al
lowed two hits after that, sand
wiched around a hit batter, giving
the Bruins a bases-loaded situation
with one run already across.
Freshman Nolan Gallagher came
on in relief of Romanczuk and struck
out UCLA outfielder Josh Roenicke
for the second out. But Jensen drove
in two with a two-out single to right,
staking the Bruins to a 4-2 lead.
Stanford made sure that there
would be no need for late-inning hero
ics on Sunday, pounding out 11 hits and
winning in convincing fashion, 11-1.
Sophomore starting pitcher Matt
Leva (4-2) delivered his most com
manding performance of the season.

allowing just two hits and one run
over 6 1/ 3 innings of work. Leva's
bid fora no-hitter was broken up in
the fifth, when Bruin third baseman
Matt Sharp homered to left.
"The staff in general has done re
ally well lately," Leva said after the
game. "We feel really confident from
a pitching standpoint that we're going
to hold the other team to fewer runs."
Sophomore lefthander Blake
Holler came on in relief of Leva and
pitched well, throwing 2 2/3 score
less innings and striking out five to
finish out the contest.
The Stanford offense, deter
mined not to put itself in the hole
again, jumped on Bruin starter Brant

Rustich early, scoring two runs in the
first on RBI doubles by Lowrie and
Mayberry, respectively. Lowrie
went 3-for-5 in the game and drove
in three runs. The team added a pair
in the third and tacked on three more
runs in the fifth on an RBI single up
the middle by Sorgi and a two-run
single by Lowrie over the out
stretched glove of leaping UCLA
second baseman Sean Smith. The
onslaught forced the Bruins to use
six pitchers, each of whom allowed at
least one run.A three-run homer by
sophomore pinch hitter Ryan Sea
well in the eighth, the first of his ca
reer. punctuated the Cardinal scor
ing attack.
