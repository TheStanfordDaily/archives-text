### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
Newsweek Editor Mark Whitaker has
cancelled his lecture, originally scheduled for
tonight as part of the John S. Knight journal
ism symposium. Accordingly, the panel dis
cussion, which was supposed to take place to
morrow, has been moved to today at noon in
the Bechtel Conference Center in Encina
Hall.
Whitaker must stay in New York to deal
with the aftermath of an apology Newsweek
issued yesterday for printing a short article
about American guards at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, flushing a Koran down a toilet in its
May 9 edition, said Communication Prof. Jim
Bettinger, director of the Knight Fellowship
Program.
Many have blamed the piece for inciting
riots in Pakistan and Afghanistan that have
led to the deaths of 17 people. The magazine
has no plans to run a full retraction.
"We regret that we got any part of our
story wrong, and extend our sympathies to
victims of the violence and the U.S. soldiers
caught in its midst," Whitaker wrote in the
newest issue of Newsweek.
Bettinger will moderate today's sympo
sium, which will also include Tim Porter, au
thor of the journalism blog First Draft, and
Katrina Heron, a former editor for the San
Francisco-based Wired magazine. Before
Whitaker's cancellation, the discussion was
planned to focus on his remarks, but will in
stead address press credibility issues.
Before starting First Draft, Porter edited for
the San Francisco Examiner and the Rich
mond Independent. Heron is a former editor of
New York Times Magazine, Vanity Fair and
The New Yorker.
