# New alcohol policy proves successful
## Statistics show a decrease in hospitalizations after policy implementation 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
University officials claim that the two
year-old alcohol policy has decreased the
number of hospitalizations among under
classmen. Since its implementation, the poli
cy has been largely accepted by resident as
sistants and most freshmen have coped, but
some have defied the new rules and faced stiff
consequences.
The policy, which came into effect during
the last academic year, states that all-fresh
man residences cannot serve alcohol at
events in their lounges, hallways or outdoor
patios. But some students and school officials
are worried that the change would lead to
heavy drinking behind doors, where danger
ous activities could not be monitored by R As.
However, Ralph Castro, an alcohol and drug
educator at Vaden Health Center, said that
hasn't happened.
"I think it's played out rather well," he said.

In fact, according to Director of Residen
tial Education Jane Camarillo, early statistics
point to a slight decrease in alcohol-related
hospitalizations among freshmen.
"In fall and winter quarters in particular, I
felt that we were seeing less extreme prob
lems with the freshman class," she said in an
e-mail to The Daily. "This year, as last, I have
felt that more of our calls for emergency

room visits have been for upperclass
men (mostly sophomores), but 1 can
not yet confirm that with the data.
But I am convinced that the frosh
transports are down compared to up
perclassmen."
Before the policy went into effect,
RAs expressed concern that they
would be forced to police their resi
dents, breaking the trust that has ex
isted between dorm staff and stu
dents. But Castro claims this has not
been the case.
"RAs have told me they like the
policy," he said. "From a staff point
of view, (the policy) allows their stu
dents to interact without the social

pressures of alcohol."
Senior Laurel Anderson, an RA
in the all-frosh dorm Otero, agreed
that the policy has not strained the
student-staff relationship.
"When we are hired, we're told
that our job is not to he policemen,"
she said. "It has always been [the
Otero staffs) policy from the very be
ginning that even though there's no
alcohol in public places, that people
should keep the doors open so we
know what's going on."
Senior Josh Seifert, an RAin the
all-frosh dorm Larkin, agreed that
the policy was helpful.
"I laving a policy is nice because it
means there's something written that
I can say: Here's why you can't be
doing this, it's not my fault,' " he said.
According to Anderson, the re
moval of alcohol from public spaces
has been made easier by the fact that

freshmen don't know what dorm life
was like before the new policy.
"The freshmen don't know any
different, so it hasn't been a problem,
because that's just the way it is and
they don't question it," she said.
Leigh Biddlecomb, a freshman in
Branner, agreed.
"It's hard to foresee what would
happen if they got rid of the policy,"
she said, noting that she did not know
what dorm social life was like in years
past.
Most students have coped with
the policy and say there is still plenty
of drinking in all-frosh dorms.
"My roommate and I had a lot of
pre-parties in our room, so for us it
wasn't a problem," said freshman
Mark Bonney, who lives in the all
frosh dorm Paloma. "So I guess the
only thing we were missing out on
was huge dorm-wide progressives."
Biddlecomb echoed these com
ments.
"We had a cocktail party that
spilled out into a hall, but the RAs
are fine with it as long we clean up
and it doesn't get too crazy," she said.
"Parties still happen but they tend to

be smaller."
But this does not mean the policy
lacks teeth. In March, freshmen
Nick Parker and Donny Vaughn
were kicked out of Cedro for throw
ing a three-keg birthday party. A vi
olation of the alcohol policy, the
party ended when a fire alarm was
accidentally set off, bringing the fire
department to their door. Residen
tial Education forced the pair to
move to dorms across campus and
banned them from both Cedro and
Wilbur Dining.
"I feel like we were made exam
ples of," said Parker, who sits on The
Daily's editorial board. "I think they
overreacted. I thought we would get
a slap on the wrist, and instead they
went as far as threaten expulsion."
Some have suggested that the
move to centralize the freshmen pop
ulation on east campus is designed to
more carefully regulate drinking
among first-year students, an allega
tion Camarillo denies.
"The Undergraduate Housing
Master Plan was not motivated in any
way by the desire to control alcohol
consumption but rather to create a

more coherent vision for undergrad
uate residences," she said. "Our col
leagues on the East [Coast) who have
freshman residence campuses would
likely also attest that clustering all
freshmen on one part of campus
doesn't allow for more control as it
regards alcohol consumption, though
programmatic efforts might be done
differently if one does have such clus
tering."
Decreasing the prevalence of
hard alcohol, Castro said, is one tac
tic that could make campus drinking
safer.
"In the six years I have been here,
I have seen an increasingly large up
tick in hard liquor consumption," he
said. "It has just blown me away.
Every dangerous situation has had
hard liquor. I think you can get every
thing you want out of drinking from
beer, wine and malt liquor."
At Pomona College, school offi
cials have spotted the same correla
tion and have actively worked to dis
courage hard alcohol consumption,
said Frank Bedoya, associate dean of
campus life at Pomona.
"Hard alcohol is not permitted in
any room where the student is under
21 years of age," he said in an inter
view with The Daily. "Students
caught with hard alcohol are subject
to fines and possible J-board action.
R As are the front line in terms of en
forcement."
Pomona tacitly pushes beer as an
alternative, Bedoya said. The Associ
ated Students (Pomona's version of
the ASSU) runs an "alcohol fund,"
which is derived from the profits of
that organization's businesses. Stu
dent groups can then apply for

money from the fund to buy kegs for
on-campus parties.
Castro, however, said he does not
foresee Stanford providing students
with beer, citing legal reasons. Over
all, though, efforts to ensure student
safety are in the interest of campus
social life, he added.
"If there is a high-profile, alcohol
related student death, we'd probably
have to become more stringent," he
said, pointing to Bowdoin College as
an example.
In 19%, an intoxicated sopho
more from the University of Maine
fell to his death while trying to climb
onto the roof of a Bowdoin fraterni
ty. In the aftermath of that incident,
the college cracked down on drink
ing, banning hard alcohol and drink
ing games like beer pong on campus.
Parties must now be registered by a
student over 21. and campus security
officers stop by every party to ensure
that event organizers are not serving
beer to minors.
It is this extreme, Castro said, the
administration wants to avoid.
"I don't think anybody wants
Stanford to become a dry campus,"
he said. "It's eliminating the irre
sponsible use of alcohol. Blackouts,
hangovers, missed classes, poor acad
emic performance is what we're talk
ing about."
Seifert, the RAin Larkin,
agreed and added that the changing
behavior goes beyond any Univer
sity policy.
"Problems with the policy, in my
mind, are more fundamental Ameri
can cultural problems surrounding
alcohol â€” starting with a 21 year-old
drinking age," he said.
