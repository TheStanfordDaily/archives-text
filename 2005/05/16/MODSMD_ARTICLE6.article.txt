# Students try to make Bravman a celebrity
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
John Bravman's face has been popping
up on campus lately â€” ever since a group
of students picked the vice provost for un
dergraduate education for their experi
ment, entitled Project Brav New World.
These students, who are associated with

the Matthias K. Rath Museum of Destruc
tion and Resurrection located in Kairos,
aim to explore the effects of a "cult of per
sonality" through the project.
Photographs of Bravman have adorned
banners, flyers at the intersection of death
and T-shirts worn by students.
