# Students try to make Bravman a celebrity
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
John Bravman's face has been popping
up on campus lately — ever since a group
of students picked the vice provost for un
dergraduate education for their experi
ment, entitled Project Brav New World.
These students, who are associated with

the Matthias K. Rath Museum of Destruc
tion and Resurrection located in Kairos,
aim to explore the effects of a "cult of per
sonality" through the project.
Photographs of Bravman have adorned
banners, flyers at the intersection of death
and T-shirts worn by students.

"I thought it was the most hilari
ous thing I had ever seen," said
FroSoCo College Assistant Mark
Berghausen, a senior, about the ban
ner outside of his dorm.
Senior Nick Casey, one of the
founders of the Rath Museum, said
the project is wholly apolitical and is
simply an experiment via perfor
mance art. Influences include Andy
Warhol, Christo, Jeanne-Claude and
Joseph Stalin, he said.
"The question is: What happens if
you set up a cult of personality
around an individual without [his or
her) knowing overnight?" Casey
said. "It's our own personal curiosi
ty."
And why was Bravman the obvi
ous choice for the group?
"Bravman strikes me as the most
obvious example," Casey said. "[He]
kind of set up a cult of personality
around himself already — with
FroSoCo and taking over the third
floor of Sweet Hall."
Senior Ross Perlin, also a founder
of the museum, said he is interested
in studying the relationships between
citizens and artists under a dictator.
"Bravman is not a dictator," Per
lin said, "The point was to inject the
idea of dictatorship and a cult per
sonality just to see how people would
react."
The experiment is not a thesis or
research project.
DeAnna Dalton, a freshman at
FroSoCo, said people living near the
banner hanging from the second
floor noticed it immediately.
"Everyone was pretty confused."
she said. "Nobody quite knows why
they're up. Everyone is part-con
fused, part-amused, but it's exciting."
So far Bravman has laughed off
the phenomenon.

"I thought it was humorous," he
said in an interview with The Daily,
"Nothing like this has ever happened
tome before."
He has even requested a T-shirt to
commemorate the experience, which
Casey and Perlin said they will cus
tomize.
When asked about the fate of the
banners, Bravman said he did not
know what happened to the banner
displayed in front of Memorial
Church. But he asked one of his stu
dents at FroSoCo to take down the
banner located there after a week.
He added that he joked about the
affair at a recent staff meeting and
had a "good laugh" about it in one of
his classes.
According to Perlin, the point is
for the banners to mean different
things to different people. Making a
large-scale statement is inevitably
ambiguous, he said.
"What the thing means is entirely
up to them," Perlin said. "Watching
the community define their relation
ship to this banner has been totally
fascinating."
Casey added that he found Brav
man's reaction interesting as well.
"We find it odd that [Bravman]
has become almost obsessed with
this project of iconicizing his face,"
he said, citing rumors that Bravman
currently owns the banner from
FroSoCo and his request for T
shirts for both himself and his fi
ancee.
Almost all of the 200 T-shirts
made have been sold, Perlin said, and
most of the big projects have already
been done. However, it's hard to say
what is left in store for Project Brav
New World.
"We hope that other campus citi
zens will do crazy and bizarre things
to make a final gape and wonder —
make a stop in our daily lives and feel
weird fora moment," Perlin said.
"That's good, to feel weird. We
might be involved in something, it's
hard to say."
