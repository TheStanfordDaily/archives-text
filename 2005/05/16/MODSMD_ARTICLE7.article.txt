# Stanford represents at Bay to Breakers
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Elvis impersonators, inflatable dinosaurs
and a flock of "runaway brides" were standard
fare at San Francisco's annual Bay to Break
ers walk-run, which took place yesterday, rais
ing money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma
Society, the Sports Medicine Institute and Or
gans R 1 Us.
Stanford boasted several strong finishers
who ran the 7.46-mile course in less than an

hour.
"It was good weather fora run," said elec
trical engineering graduate student Diederik
Marius, who crossed the finish line with a time
of 1:09. "I ran into a lot of people I recognized
from Stanford."
Several seniors avoided by the morning
crunch by staying overnight in the city after
Senior Formal. But the Stanford representa
tion was small among the almost 50,00() regis
tered participants.
The race began at 8 a.m. at the Embar

cadero with a festive crowd tossing tortillas
and saluting the news helicopters hovering
above. Nearby residents stood on their
rooftops to watch the procession.
In keeping with Bay to Breakers tradition,
groups of "salmon" — people running in the
opposing direction — ran against the crowd
and many participants ran in the nude.
"Some people say it hurts to run naked,"
said a streaker named Brian. "But it doesn't
hurt 'real men.'"
The nudity, and the event's
prominent display of gay pride, also
attracted religious protesters, who
lined segments of the course with
megaphones and large signs embla
zoned with quotes from the Bible.
Several urged participants to shun
their naked compatriots, labeling
the race course a "road to sin and
perdition."
But not all the sign-bearers had
hostile messages.
"1 used to be a hippie too," said a
born-again Christian named Doug,

who hailed from Oregon for the
event. "It's a beautiful day. I just want
everybody to know Jesus loves
them."
Mathematics graduate student
Paul Dehaye said that most of the
people he saw during the walk found
humor in the protest.
"I saw one man in a devil costume,"
he said. "When we passed by a reli
gious guy with angry signs, everyone
just started yelling Tm with Satan.'"
Computer Science graduate stu
dent Kavi Goel said that the event of
fered a little something to everyone.
"The silly people can wear cos
tumes, the serious athletes race and
everyone goes to a carnival afterward
to enjoy themselves," he said. "And
even the serious people aren't too se
rious."
