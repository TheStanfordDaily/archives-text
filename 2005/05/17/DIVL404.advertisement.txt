2005-06 Intel Foundation
Ph.D. Fellowship Award Recipients
Altug, Carlstrom, Houston, Iroaga, Ju and Porter were awarded
Ph.D. fellowship grants from the Intel Foundation for the
2005-06 academic year.
• Altug's fellowship research will focus on demonstration of high
speed and yet nano-scale photonic devices including lasers and
all-photonic switches that can be integrated in Silicon for on-chip
optical interconnects. Advisor: Dr. Jelena Vuckovic
• Carlstrom's fellowship research will focus on Transactional
Coherency and Consistency (TCC). Advisor: Dr. Kunle Olukotun
• Houston's fellowship research will focus on finding ways to define
task as well as data parallelism in an easy and natural way for
users. Advisor: Dr. Pat Hanrahan
• Iroaga's fellowship research will focus on simplifying the analog
blocks to look more like their digital counterparts and borrowing
some concepts from digital design to increase overall system
performance. Advisor: Dr. Boris Murmann
• Ju's fellowship research will focus on innovative systems for
monitoring and encouraging cardiovascular health of car drivers.
Advisor: Dr. Larry Leifer
• Porter's fellowship research will focus on the initial stages of
atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a leading high-k candidate,
hafnium oxide, to elucidate the mechanisms of film growth,
defect formation, and impurity incorporation.
Advisor: Dr. Stacey Bent
This year, the Intel Foundation Ph.D. Fellowship Program
awarded 43 fellowships totaling $1.8 million to outstanding
Ph.D. candidates pursuing leading-edge research at 17 U.S.
universities. To learn more about Intel's commitment to highe
