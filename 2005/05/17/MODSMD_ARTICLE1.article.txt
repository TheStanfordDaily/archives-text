# Say goodbye to long-distance phone bills
## 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
Roommates Ray Chen and Harrison Tang, both
master's students in electrical engineering, envision a
world in which the Internet replaces traditional land
line telephone networks.
They are banking on this vision by helping to found
YapperNut, a startup company marketing a device
called the Yapperßox, which allows users to make In
ternet calls through traditional phone sets.
"This is the biggest thing in recent years because it
will replace landline phones," Tang said, referring to
VoIP — short for Voice over internet Protocol — the
technology that enables voice conversations to be
transmitted over the Internet, allowing users to bypass
often hefty long-distance telephone bills.
YapperNut is Chen and Tang's second attempt at
entrepreneurship. After coming up with the idea fora
VoIP startup, Chen and Tang talked to Rafael Aldana
and Dan Witte, two electrical engineering doctoral
students that Tang knew from the lab he worked in as
a Stanford undergraduate.
"It was a coincidence that they were thinking about
it, and we were thinking about it, and so it came to
gether," Chen said.
However, a venture to lower the cost of interna
tional calling makes sense for the four founders, since
all have family and friends living abroad.
About the size of a paperback book, the Yapper-
Box plugs into a landline jack and connects your tele
phone set to your personal computer. You talk into
your telephone handset, and the box converts analog

audio into digital data, which your home computer
then transmits over the Internet to a user anywhere in
the world via a free software application called Skype.
From the creators of Kazaa. Skype is a VoIP pro
gram that uses the same peer-to-peer, or P2P. model
that Kaaza uses for music file sharing, thus allowing for
computer-to-computer voice communication at no
cost. However, fora fee, Skype users can use a feature
called SkypeOut to make calls to a regular landline
phone. Landline users can also call computers running
Skype using Skvpeln at an additional cost.
