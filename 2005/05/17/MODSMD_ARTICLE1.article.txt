# Say goodbye to long-distance phone bills
## 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
Roommates Ray Chen and Harrison Tang, both
master's students in electrical engineering, envision a
world in which the Internet replaces traditional land
line telephone networks.
They are banking on this vision by helping to found
YapperNut, a startup company marketing a device
called the Yapperßox, which allows users to make In
ternet calls through traditional phone sets.
"This is the biggest thing in recent years because it
will replace landline phones," Tang said, referring to
VoIP — short for Voice over internet Protocol — the
technology that enables voice conversations to be
transmitted over the Internet, allowing users to bypass
often hefty long-distance telephone bills.
YapperNut is Chen and Tang's second attempt at
entrepreneurship. After coming up with the idea fora
VoIP startup, Chen and Tang talked to Rafael Aldana
and Dan Witte, two electrical engineering doctoral
students that Tang knew from the lab he worked in as
a Stanford undergraduate.
"It was a coincidence that they were thinking about
it, and we were thinking about it, and so it came to
gether," Chen said.
However, a venture to lower the cost of interna
tional calling makes sense for the four founders, since
all have family and friends living abroad.
About the size of a paperback book, the Yapper-
Box plugs into a landline jack and connects your tele
phone set to your personal computer. You talk into
your telephone handset, and the box converts analog

audio into digital data, which your home computer
then transmits over the Internet to a user anywhere in
the world via a free software application called Skype.
From the creators of Kazaa. Skype is a VoIP pro
gram that uses the same peer-to-peer, or P2P. model
that Kaaza uses for music file sharing, thus allowing for
computer-to-computer voice communication at no
cost. However, fora fee, Skype users can use a feature
called SkypeOut to make calls to a regular landline
phone. Landline users can also call computers running
Skype using Skvpeln at an additional cost.

Goodbye phone cards: make calls using your computer

"YapperNut uses Skype because we
believe that Skype is by far the best
product or VoIP," Aldana said. "The
voice quality is better than regular
phone service."
For now, although YapperNut and
Skype are not affiliated, the Yapperßox
only works with the Skype program, so
customers are limited to the Skype net
work for free calls. But the makers of
Yapperßox say that their device could
be reconfigured with new software later
if a better VoIP client becomes avail
able.
Because YapperNut capitalizes on
the free Skype network, the service only
involves a one-time fee for its hardware.
According to Tang, other Internet
phone providers, such as Vonage and
Packets, charge a $20to $30 monthly fee
because they maintain a central server
to process voice communication.
But why not just use Skype with a
pair of computer speakers and a micro
phone? Tang claims that it's the same
reason why drivers don't use pressure
sensitive joysticks to maneuver BMWs
— people enjoy using a familiar inter
face, in this case, a telephone handset.
Moreover, if using a cordless phone.
Tang added, users are no longer teth
ered to their computers while making
Skype calls.
"From a tech perspective, it's a small
step from accessory to gateway." Tang
said, referring to the first generation of
Yapperßoxes. "From an economic per
spective, it's a revolution. Imagine if ev
eryone bought it. They are set forever.

We are trying to put a CPU inside [for
future models], and it will be like a
router."

But for now, YapperNut customers
can expect to receive a gateway

box with attaching cables
Additionally, customers

can download soft
ware that pro-

vides "answer
ing machine,"
"morning call"
and "message
scheduler" ser
vices for the
product, avail-

able from the Yap
perNut Web site at
no extra charge.

"What's unique
about us is that we're

a hardware comp, but
Skype is a social thing —

we have to make it friendly,"
Chen said. "We're trying to make
software for it and give it away for

free."
YapperNut launched pre-order sales
of the Yapperßox last Wednesday via
their Web site. They expect to begin
shipping their product May 30.
Where does YapperNut expect to go
from here?
"A lot people are interested, but
we're still working on the overall strate
gy, feeling out the overall market." said
Chen.
"Two years we'll go public," said Al
dana with a laugh. "Then I'll retire."
