# Six grad students recognized
## Techie PhD. candidates receive fellowships from Intel 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
With today's announcement of the 2005-2(X)6 Intel
Foundation Ph.D. Fellowship winners, Stanford has six
more prestigious awards under its belt. Each year, the
fellowships are granted to about 40 doctoral candidates
across the country.
To be considered for the award, applicants' work
must focus on topics that fit Intel's research and busi
ness priorities — namely, increasing Internet and com
puting accessibility worldwide.
Stanford's 2005 recipients are Hatice Altug, a grad
uate student in applied physics; Brian Carlstrom and
Michael Houston, graduate students in computer sci
ence; Echere Iroaga, a graduate student in manage
ment science and engineering; Wendy Ju, a graduate
student in mechanical engineering; and David Porter, a
graduate student in chemical engineering.
"A total of 43 graduate students across 17 univer
sities were given the awards," said Brenda Christof
fer of Intel's Higher Education Program, a branch of
the corporation dedicated to cultivating future busi
ness and technology leaders. "This year, Stanford
leads in the number of students receiving this com
petitive honor."
More than 20 Stanford graduate students have re
ceived Intel Foundation Ph.D. Fellowships since 2000,
Christoffer added.
The two-year program includes a stipend for tuition
and other fees, a new laptop and an internship at Intel.
"Internships provided are in line with the students'

technical research," Christoffer wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "The students are matched with an Intel re
search. technology or business group at a U.S. site and
work with an Intel technologist who mentors the re
search work. Internships generally last from three to six
months."
While Ju said she will work at Intel this summer, fel
lows are not required to participate in the internships.
"I will probably not pursue the internship opportu
nity that is part of the fellowship program," Carlstrom
said. "My group at Stanford already collaborates with
several groups at Intel's Microprocessor Research
Laboratory in Santa Clara. If we didn't already have
the chance to work with Intel directly from Stanford, I
think I would have taken the internship."
Whether or not the fellows choose to intern, Intel
technologists are available to help them with their re
search.
This years Stanford fellows said they will investigate
a wide variety of topics.
"I'm working on ways to allow programmers to take
better advantage of upcoming computer architectures
like multi-core central processing units, clusters of cen
tral processing units and large supercomputers," Hous
ton said.
Carlstrom said he plans to use his fellowship for "re
search in building programming systems for new com
puter architectures built around transactional memo
ry''
Houston said that he thinks the most exciting aspect
of the fellowship program is the opportunity to work
more closely with Intel and receive feedback on his
work.
When asked what aspect of the Fellowship he most
looked forward to. Carlstrom said, "I should probably
say the validation of the importance of my research
area to industry or the mentoring opportunity, but I'm
most excited to be getting a new laptop."
