# Social Innovation
## From Stanford engineering to social innovation 
### 
Can a water pump help alleviate poverty? Our
social innovator of the week, Martin Fisher, has
spent the last 15 years proving that it can.
In 1991, Martin Fisher and Nick Moon founded
ApproTEC, a non-profit organization that devel
ops technologies for alleviating poverty. More
than 36,000 farmers in Kenya have now used their
low-cost water pumps to create their own small
businesses. Fisher and Moon hope to help 400,000
people in the next few years.
Before founding ApproTEC, Martin Fisher
earned his Ph.D. in engineering from Stanford.
The Daily: What's the big idea behind Appro-
TEC?
Martin Fischer: ApproTEC is all about enabling
poor people to make enough money to actually es
cape poverty. We do this by developing and mass
marketing very low-cost capital equipment that
people can buy and use to start profitable busi
nesses.
TD: Your most popular products are water pumps.
How can they alleviate poverty?
MF: We work in Africa, where 80 percent of poor

people are farmers. These farm
ers have one asset, a small plot
of land, and one basic skill,
farming. The best business op
portunity for them is to move
from subsistence farming into
farming cash crops.
Our manual irrigation
pumps enable farmers to do ex
actly that. On average, when a
farmer uses our pumps, he in
creases his income from $110 per
year to over $1,100 per year. In

Africa, that brings him from below the poverty line
into the middle class.
TI): Why help the poor start private businesses?
Why not ptovide direct aid?
MF: Our mission is to enable millions of families to
escape from poverty. When we're talking about
poverty we're talking about a lack of a way to make
money.
We define poverty in a way that is very different
from how people traditionally would. Traditional
ly, people talk about poverty as lack of clean water,
lack of healthcare, lack of schooling and etc. But
the bottom line is that nearly everyone in the world
lives in a cash economy. If you have a way to make
money, then you can afford all those other things.
TD: You're critical of much of international devel
opment work. What's the problem?
MF: One thing about development is that there
seems to be a very short institutional memory. We
really need to go back and learn the lessons of the
past because I see the same mistakes made again.
Right now, we are back to thinking we can fly
into a village and bring some piece of equipment,
make it community owned and make a difference.
That just won't work.
Development is generally all about giving
things away to communities and doing social engi
neering. We've realized it's much better to sell
things to individual people, using the existing pri
vate sector.
TI): How do you use the private sector in your own
work?
MF: In our supply chain, everybody makes money.
We have big manufacturers who mass-produce the
pump equipment. We have wholesalers who make
money selling it. We have 250 retail shops, in every
little village, town and city in Kenya. They all make
money. It's a completely sustainable supply chain.
When we walk away from it, people will be able to
go back and get spare parts and get new equip
ment.
TD: You received a Ph.D. in engineering from
Stanford. How did you end up as a social en
trepreneur?
MF: After earning my doctorate, I went down to
Peru on a vacation. That was my first experience
being face-to-face with real poverty.
As an engineer, I just remember thinking that
there has to be something we can do to change such
a situation. I started researching the "appropriate
technologies" movement in Kenya. I was supposed
to go for 10 months, but I ended up staying for 17
years.
TD: Do you have any advice for students who are
inspired by your work?
MF: Right now, it's most important to prove these
models can work. We need more appropriate tech
nology models that work, are cost-effective and
show sustainable impacts. In order to do this, peo
ple need to be very entrepreneurial and willing not
to make a lot of money. It's hard work to go out
there and make it happen.
But once we do that, then we can actually start
to eradicate poverty fora change.
