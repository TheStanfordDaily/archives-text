### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
After months of hammering out cover letters, mail
ing out packets of resumes and selling yourself in tough
job interviews, you've finally snagged that ever-elusive
job. You — yes you — are finally employed.
The news could not be better — except that they
want you to relocate. To a city you've never been to.
Moving to another area is never easy, but there are
several Web sites and tools that can help make the tran
sition easier.
Finding your pad
One of the best Web sites to look for housing is
http://www.craigslist.org. developed by San Francisco
resident Craig Newmark. Craigslist boasts pages for 105
cities in 23 countries and is used by about eight million
people per month. Completely free, Craigslist allows
you to search for sublets, roommates, apartments, hous
es — and you can search by price, number of bedrooms
or use a keyword search (to look for housing in a specif
ic neighborhood, for example).
Paul Rademacher, animation tools technical leader at
Dream Works Animation, combined Cragslist.com and
GoogleMaps (http://maps.google.com) so that you can
now include a visual component to your search and narrow
down your housing choices by location. The Web site,
which is not affiliated with Google or Craigslist.com, is
available at http://paulrademacher.com/housing. When
you type in a series of search terms, a map appears with red
and yellow balloons. The yellow balloons represent
Craigslist.com postings with pictures, while the red ones

simply list the posting information. However, the

Web site only includes Craigslist listings

that provide a complete address, re
sulting in fewer search results

than Craigslist itself.
You can also

use your

Stanford connections to find housing by subscribing to
inCircle, an online Stanford social networking commu
nity. at http://incircle.stanfordalumni.org. You need not
have graduated to join, and the service is completely
free. You build your network by connecting with your
friends — either alumni or current students — and you
can then receive messages from friends, friends-of
friends or friends-of-fricnds-of-friends.
Network 'til you drop
Still looking fora job? Want to keep your options
open even as you're starting out in your new position?
Check out Linkedln.com (http://www.linkedin.com), a
Palo Alto-based networking Web site that can connect
you to people in your industry. Since its launch in 2003,
it has been used by 2.5 million people around the world,
according to a May 8 Washington Post article. When
you sign up, you can choose how much of vour resume
others see and whether or not others can contact you.
If you have an idea of the company you might want
to work for or the industry you are interested in, try
doing a search at Careerßuilder.com, (http://career
builder.com). Careerßuilder.com has partnered up
with several major newspaper companies — Knight
Ridder, the Tribune Company and Gannett Co., Inc.
— to reach a wide audience on the newspapers' Web
sites, thereby creating a large network of job postings.
The Web site also lists upcoming career fairs, which
can be a great way to explore jobs you wouldn't have
considered otherwise.

Eat, drink and be merry
Face it, you'll never fully break out of the Stanford
bubble. So why not use the bubble to your advantage? If
you're relocating, check out the events hosted by your
nearest Stanford club. Some clubs have their own Web
sites, while others have a contact person at the Stanford
Alumni Association Web site; check the different sites
out at http://www.stanfordclubs.org. The clubs sponsor
fun, professional and educational events. The Phoenix
club, for example, will host a rock-climbing event for
young alumni on May 19, while the Washington D.C.
club is featuring a lecture on corporate social responsi
bility on May 24.
For foodies, a subscription to the Zagat.com Web
site may be a worthwhile investment (http://.zagat.com).
The Zagat guide considered by many as the gold stan
dard for food guides and provides ratings on service,
food, decor and cost. The cost is $25 fora year's worth
of complete access to the site — which includes restau
rants. hotels, clubs and bars — or you can choose to
view the restaurants only for $20. Given that the cost of
one Zagat guide is $13. this is a good deal.
If you're locating to one of the bigger cities — New
York City. Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas
or Boston — sign up to receive your Daily Candy
(http://www.dailycandy.com). A short, colorful daily note
tells you about fashion trends and chic stores, culture and
arts events, and places to eat and drink in your city. Ban
ish weekend boredom by checking out the weekend
guide, read reviews of shops, restaurants, bars and muse
um openings, and find the best places for beauty services.
