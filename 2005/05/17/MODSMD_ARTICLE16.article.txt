## Editorial Film studies major should incorporate production 
### 
Stanford may be located in the home
state of Hollywood and major motion
picture studios, but until recently, its con
tributions to undergraduate film passions
have fallen short. Fortunately, the Facul
ty Senate decided early last week to es
tablish film studies as an official major of
fered by the Art and Art History Depart
ment. While this is clearly a commendable
and exciting step toward expanding the
University to include more of the arts, it
should also be seen as a good opportunity
for collaboration between the film studies
program and established student organi
zations such as the Stanford Film Society,
or SFS.
With high turnout at events such as An
Art Affair, organized by the Student Or
ganizing Committee for the Ahs, and the
annual Student Film Festival, it's clear
that Stanford students are eager for more
opportunities to get involved with and ex
perience the arts at all levels on campus.
The current proposal for the film studies
major incorporates five different concen
trations: film history, film culture, film and
performance, film technology and film
criticism. There is also an internship com
ponent. Although this may seem to in
clude most pertinent areas at first glance,
it is missing the crucial component of film
production studies that will, at best, only
be touched upon within the film technolo
gy concentration.
As stated by faculty representatives, the
overall goal of the film studies major is to

prepare students to work in all aspects of
the industry. However, it is obvious that a
Stanford undergraduate with a film and
media studies degree who has not received
training in production will find him / her
self with fewer job opportunities than
someone who has received that training.
While there is much to be said for giving
students a strong critical and historical
background in film, marketable skills
should not be ignored, particularly when
most students who choose the major will
be interested in production.
Since it may not be financially or logisti
cally feasible to include a sixth component
to the new program, faculty should consid
er teaming up with student groups that can
offer film production courses and equip
ment. SFS has the resources and student
staff to offer both an introductory and ad
vanced Student Filmmaker's Workshop
each year, which currently cannot be taken
for credit. If credit were to be offered for
film studies students interested in learning
about production, they would have further
incentive to acquire the lighting, shooting,
editing and sound recording skills that go
into film and video production.
Many other programs and opportuni
ties, such as SFS' film grant program and
activities sponsored by the Stanford Alum
ni Entertainment Group, are certainly
worth looking into for the new depart
ment. Such collaboration will allow the
film studies major to offer as much as pos
sible to students.
