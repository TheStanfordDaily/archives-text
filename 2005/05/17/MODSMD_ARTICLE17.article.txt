# Holt's Harangue
## Pirate Pride, Ninja Nay-Saying 
### 
Alright, that does it. I'm tired of these
ceaseless "debates" that are nothing more
than one group talking at the other, spew
ing venom without making any head way.
Our campus has been in an uproar over this
last week; things have been tenser than a
Newsweek editors' meeting.
I'm talking, of course, about the debate
between the Ninjas and the Pirates. Last
week was the beginning of Ninja Pride
Week and also Pirate Respect Month, a

scheduling conflict that is equivalent to hosting a presidential
address the same night as the World Series.
Although The Daily reported about Ninja Pride Week, the
Pirates were remarkably absent in the press. When I went to
White Plaza, though, all I saw was Pro-Pirate demonstrations.
The Pirates had planned a "Blackpearl Remembrance Day"
that happened to coincide with Ninja Week. Both groups held
rallies peacefully, but their sentiments were about as peaceful
as an A's fan-base.
It all centers on what happened several decades ago. ITie
Pirates and the Ninjas had an altercation that they, to this day,
are still fighting about. Something about a pirate wench they
both claimed, 1 dunno. She's pretty old now. But they are still
fighting over her.
No, instead of flipping out and killing everyone as an un
stoppable partnership that would leave robots, chickens, and
robot chickens in fear, they remain divided.
Unfortunately, despite our progressive-minded universi
ty's best intentions, no one has curbed this hatred. While
both groups speak of "pride" for their group and claim that
they want "peace," such statements always preclude bash
ing the other group. Being pro-Ninja means that you are
Anti-Piratical. It's them or us. You can't show pride in being
a Pirate or a Ninja without then saying how "the Ninjas are
yellow-bellied bastards" or "the Pirates lack honor or good
hygiene."
I'm tired of the scare tactics, too. Both sides try to play to
our sympathies by depicting the horror of the other side.
Posters and ads about ritualistic seppuku and walking the
plank get grim after a while. As 1 walked around campus this
last week, I felt really irritated. Both were claiming the others

were saying hate-speech, but they turned a blind eye, or eye
patch, to their own group's hateful words.
Captain Bluebeard of the Piratical pride group spoke last
week, giving a keynote speech in White Plaza:" Yarr, a pirate's
life for me." The crowds of Pirates in the audience, wooden
legged, swash-buckling and parroted, all cheered. The com
ment was shortly followed by, "The Ninjas are treacherous
bastards." This too received cheers, and the hisses of dis
agreement from the black-clad forms of the Ninjas.
The Ninjas, for their part, were doing traditional Ninja
demonstrations: guitar solos. But when asked about the anti-
Ninja statements made by the Pirate Captain, Black
Death Shadow said: "Honestly, I'm hurt. We're trying to cele
brate the first great guitar solo of our forefathers and here they
are picking a fight with us. Not cool." He then executed a triple
tlip before disappearing into the shadows.
While violence between the two groups has not occurred as
of yet, tensions are on the rise. Every year the campus be
comes divided over the issue, and every year the student pop
ulation forgets about it for the other 11 months out of the year.
Some pessimists (and visual effects artists) just want to see
them have at it in a fantastical display of martial arts, sword
play and nun-chucks. But personally, I think the two groups
can settle their differences through peaceful means.
This will start with each group agreeing to stop hiring out
side speakers to incite near riots every other week. Why, dur
ing Ninja Pride Week, do the Ninjas feel the need to bring in a
former Pirate who now hates Pirates? How does that aide the
dialogue? It shouldn't then be a surprise when the Pirates hire
an equally vehement anti-Ninja speaker who considers Ninja
"war-mongers" and "wack guitar players."
I think both groups have valid concerns. I also think both
will probably want me dead after writing this column. I just
think that at a certain point they should be able to talk to each
other, stop making broad sweeping statements about the
other groups and realize they both have things in common:
they are total bad-asses and can pick up babes like dude, you
don't even know.

Chris apologizes to anyone who took thus metaphor as anything
other than light-hearted farce. He does think people need to light
en up a hit though. Send complaints to cholt@stanford.edu
