## Beneath the surface of the filibuster 
### MICHAEL FELDMAN 
I read Nick Benavides' letter "Why
Keep the filibuster?" (May 16), and
while I applaud the fact that he correct
ed a few details from Kalani Leifer's
column, 1 think he needs a better un
derstanding of the filibuster as an insti
tution before he can criticize it.
First of all. the filibuster is a different
entity today than it was in the times of
Strom Thurmond's attack on civil rights
legislation. Therefore it doesn't make
much sense to attack the filibuster on
those grounds.
Since Thurmond's time, there have
been revisions to the congressional
rules for stopping an immensely un
popular filibuster. While Strom Thur
mond may have been able to single
handedly stop any legislation in his
time as long as he was willing to stand
up long enough, today a supermajori
ty can call for cloture to end a fili
buster. The filibuster is a way for the

minority to assert its will in an effec
tive way in the face of a stubborn or
unsympathetic majority, but if the ma
jority is large enough, if there is
enough general support for legislation
that will actually do good, the majori
ty can overcome a filibuster.
I think Benavides misses the point
completely when he challenged Leifer
to present an instance in which the fili
buster has done good. This is simply the
wrong question to ask. An actual fili
buster does not have to occur for the in
stitution of the filibuster to do good. In
politics today, the threat of a filibuster is
often enough to convince someone to
drop a piece of legislation unless they
have the necessary votes for cloture. In
recent congressional sessions, there
have been bills defeated by the threat of
filibuster on all sides of the political
spectrum.
Since so much of politics is behind
the scenes now — with the majority
and minority whips counting and pres

suring party votes, congressmen and
women trading votes on bills they feel
are important and preventing legisla
tion through threats of retaliatory ac
tion in the form of amendments, riders
and filibusters — it is often difficult to
discover what caused the passage or de
feat of any given bill. Nevertheless, the
filibuster remains a powerful congres
sional tool to protect the interests of a
minority against harmful legislation by
a majority.
1 would beg anyone reading this or
any other discussion of the filibuster to
get to know all the facts, not just the su
perficial statistics. Try to understand
the function of something like the fili
buster and its ramifications in the polit
ical arena, rather than just looking up
how many times it has occurred in
Congress.
