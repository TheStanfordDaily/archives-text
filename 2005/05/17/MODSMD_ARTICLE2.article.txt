# Football fan club in the works
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
With new Head Coach Walt Harris promising to
provide a reason for Cardinal football fans to cheer de
spite three straight losing seasons, the Stanford Sports
Marketing Department is spearheading an effort to
bring more students to the games.
This fall, the Stanford All Axe-cess pass will include
membership in a new student football group compara
ble to the Sixth Man Club. A contest open to all Stan
ford students to name the group and design a T-shirt is
underway and will wrap up on Friday.
Harris, hired to replace Buddy Teevens in Decem
ber 2004, will judge the entries himself. The winner, to
be announced next Tuesday, will receive a 2005-2006
All Axe-cess Pass and be recognized on the Stanford
Stadium video board at home football games in the fall.
The contest, which has been advertised on GoStan
ford.com for the past week, grew partly out of Harris'
desire to increase student support for the football team.

"We did some brainstorming and decided we really
wanted to get a new football student group going," said
Stanford Athletics Marketing Associate Megan Tipton.
Tipton led a focus group to discuss the idea earlier this
month with Sophomore Class President Michael Lazar,
ASSU Executive Cabinet Member Brandon Edmond,
a junior, and ASSU President Melanie Kannokada,
also a junior.
"We decided a contest would be the best way to give
the students buy-in and get this group to be something
that students want to be a part of," Tipton said.
Lazar, who said he goes to all the home football
games, backed the proposal.
"The idea is to make the games more fun, especially
because Coach Harris wants more student involve
ment," Lazar said.
He cited the success of a similar program at North
western. even though the Wildcats don't rank among
the top teams in the nation.
There are obvious obstacles to im
proving the atmosphere at Stanford
football games. Rarely is the 80,(XX)-
seat stadium packed, giving it a cav
ernous feel, and even the closest seats
are unusually far away due to the
track that encircles the field.
"It's hard to hear the cheering,"
Tipton said, adding that 1,5(X) stu
dents purchased All Axe-cess passes
last season. An additional I,(XX) stu
dents purchased football season tick
ets, an increase from the previous sea
son.
Unlike at basketball games, where
seating is scarce, there has been little
incentive for students to arrive at foot
ball games early and many don't come
at all. Tipton said she is hoping the
new group will remedy these prob
lems.
"We've talked about possibly rop
ing off an area with the best seats or
having a pre-game tailgate where
group members would get free food,"
Tipton said. "We're still narrowing
down the possible incentives for want
ing to be a part of the group."
Given the different factors in draw
ing students to football and basketball

games, Lazar said he doesn't think it
would be lair to compare the new
football group to the wildly successful
Sixth Man Club.
"You can call it a success if stu
dents are interested and wearing the
shirts and feel the spirit and like
they're a part of the game," he said. ''It
will hopefully give us some more sem
blance of being at a college football
game. It's also good for the players on
the team to know that there are stu
dents there supporting them." »
Sophomore Tracy White said she
hopes the plans for the group involve
condensing the student section.
"I think the size problem is a big
issue and that that would be moving in
the right direction," she said.
Freshman Jennifer Ladd agreed.
"I'd probably be more likely to go
because it's nice to go with a group of
people and be close to the action," she "
said.
But not all students are convinced
that the idea will increase student in
terest. Sophomore Sean Ross said the
group is a good idea, but he thinks the
poor student attendance is directly
linked to the team's recent perfor
mance.
Students may submit up to three
suggestions for names and three T-
Shirt designs to Tipton at
mtiptonl@stanford.edu until Friday
at 5 p.m.
