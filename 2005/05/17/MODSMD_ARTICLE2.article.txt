# Football fan club in the works

### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
With new Head Coach Walt Harris promising to
provide a reason for Cardinal football fans to cheer de
spite three straight losing seasons, the Stanford Sports
Marketing Department is spearheading an effort to
bring more students to the games.
This fall, the Stanford All Axe-cess pass will include
membership in a new student football group compara
ble to the Sixth Man Club. A contest open to all Stan
ford students to name the group and design a T-shirt is
underway and will wrap up on Friday.
Harris, hired to replace Buddy Teevens in Decem
ber 2004, will judge the entries himself. The winner, to
be announced next Tuesday, will receive a 2005-2006
All Axe-cess Pass and be recognized on the Stanford
Stadium video board at home football games in the fall.
The contest, which has been advertised on GoStan
ford.com for the past week, grew partly out of Harris'
desire to increase student support for the football team.

"We did some brainstorming and decided we really
wanted to get a new football student group going," said
Stanford Athletics Marketing Associate Megan Tipton.
Tipton led a focus group to discuss the idea earlier this
month with Sophomore Class President Michael Lazar,
ASSU Executive Cabinet Member Brandon Edmond,
a junior, and ASSU President Melanie Kannokada,
also a junior.
"We decided a contest would be the best way to give
the students buy-in and get this group to be something
that students want to be a part of," Tipton said.
Lazar, who said he goes to all the home football
games, backed the proposal.
"The idea is to make the games more fun, especially
because Coach Harris wants more student involve
ment," Lazar said.
He cited the success of a similar program at North
western. even though the Wildcats don't rank among
the top teams in the nation.
