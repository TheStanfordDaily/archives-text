# Tales of a 19th grade nothing
## A 						brief look back 
### 
I graduated from the Law
School this past weekend, and I
have to say that Stanford looks a
lot different from this end of the
experience than it did during my
first visit — unfortunately, a lot
worse.
For those of you expecting
something funny this week, 1
apologize. I d like to think 1 could
write something inspiring here.

some great "Wonder Years"-style closing mono
logue to draw some heart-warming lesson. But
there's no happy ending here. There is an enormous
amount of perspective gained when one completes
something like law school, and as I prepare to depart
the not-so-friendly confines of Stanford Law School,
there are a few observations I would like to offer:
There is nothing more terribly and awfully ugly
than arrogance and yet nothing more attractive than
confidence. It is the thin line between tragic comedy
and heroic success, and many people here, rather
most people here, tread on the wrong side of that
line. 1 spent 10 years in the Navy and have seen many
places and people. That said, 1 have never met a
group of people more tragically over-invested in
their own importance. What makes it even more ter
rible is the false pride we take in not being Harvard
or Yale, and therefore not steeped in their Ivy
League elitism. I'm here to tell you we are just as
bad, if not worse. Because thinly wrapped in palm
trees, Rainbow sandals and mountain bikes, we're
just Harvard with more sun.
When I left the Navy, someone asked me what I
valued most in people. And true to my training, I an
swered, "honesty." But since being here, my answer
to that question has changed. You see, I learned in
law school that an item's scarcity determines its
value. (Not to draw any negative parallels, but you
know how a sort-of-attractive person can feel a lot
more attractive in a place where there aren't many
attractive people?) Honesty is not necessarily in

short supply around here, but there is something
that is, and it is what I now value most in others: hu
mility. For those of you who are confused, humility
is that funny ability to realize that you just aren't that
big of a deal, no matter what it says on your resume,
transcript, press release, etc. I learned this lesson
with a fresh and unsavory haircut in a boot-camp
barracks when I was 18, and it hasn't left me. Despite
the intellectual prowess of my peers, many of them
don't have this simple knowledge. If I could tell
them one thing upon graduation it would not be
"good luck" or "keep in touch." it would be none of
this makes you better than anyone else —just fan
tastically different.
For those naysayers, I will admit to living in a
glass house of my own. All of my biggest mistakes in
law school have names— I certainly haven't exer
cised the same discretion I learned in the military in
my personal life. But I'd like to think that 1 learned
a little something from my tragically bad taste in
companions. And that is, attractive "psychos" are
(now pay attention here) still "psychos."
1 've a little space left, so a few parting shots of advice:
* It is well and good not to care what others think, but
like my father used to add, "If everyone in the room
thinks your an asshole, you might be an asshole."
* The things you do for the people who work for you
are infinitely more important than the things you do
for the people you work for.
* And finally, there isn't anything wrong with people
here that a good butt-kicking wouldn't fix.
Looking back, I don't want to say there aren't
some good things about the Law School. Actually
there are two: the staff and the faculty. I will miss
them terribly. For the rest, I'll be looking forward to
seeing them when they grow up.

Glenn Truitt is now a proud (well, sort of proud) grad
uate of the Stanford Law School, hut will still write
through the end of the semester. And the funny will he
hack next week! Any good law student stories? Share
