Nakba commemoration lacked 'civility'
Regarding "Civility in the Israel-Palestine De
bate" (May 16): such civility would indeed improve
the situation at Stanford — if it were really practiced
and if it dealt in the facts of the matter. Hut the piece
by Rania Elton and Tanya Haj-Hassan offers little but
half-truths and un-truths.
First of all. the "spirit of respect and dialogue"
they claim to represent was scarcely present during
an earlier Nakba commemoration in White Plaza, as
Lyuba Wolfs op-ed ("Israeli, Palestinian groups
should educate," May 11) made clear. What's more,
organizers of the Israeli Independence Day event last
week had approached the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network, offering to display a sign opposing the
occupation if they would show one affirming Israel's
right to exist. But this gesture of respect and dialogue
was rejected.
Elton and Haj-Hassan's paragraphs on Israeli
statehood consist of long-flaunted notions that bear a
tenuous relation to reality. That "Israel was created
on the land of the indigenous Palestinian people who
lived there" is both historically and semantically in
correct. That "the Palestinian population" was simply
"displaced" or "expelled" in 1948 ignores the fact that

when the state was declared after a United Nations
vote, the invading Arab governments mainly assured
Arabs in Palestine they could safely leave until the
Jews were swept into the sea.

Measure A opponents 'want to abolish
public education'
Thanks to The Daily for its excellent editorial about
the upcoming June 7 vote on the renewal of Palo
Alto's school parcel tax ("Measure A will provide
needed funds to PA schools," May 13).
The Stanford community should be aware that the
lead author of ballot arguments against Measure A is
chairman of the local chapter of the Libertarian Party.
The Libertarian Party's platform on education,
adopted at its national convention last year, calls for
"the repeal of the guarantees of tax-funded, govern
ment-provided education" and "immediate reduc
tion of tax support for schools."
Students, faculty and staff: don't be fooled. These
critics of Measure A aren't trying to make our local
schools more efficient — they want to abolish public
