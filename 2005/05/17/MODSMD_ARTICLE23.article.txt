## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
During last night s meeting, the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate approved the ASSU operating and special
lee system budgets for the 2(X)5-2(X)6 fiscal year, in ad
dition to several funding and budget modification bills.
ASSU Financial Manager Justin Fishner-Wolfson, a
co-terminal student in computer science, presented the
proposed budget to the Senate. He explained that it
covered the expenses of the Graduate Student Council,
the Senate and other ASSU executive branches and
that the writing of the budget was a collaborative effort
between all parties concerned.
Fishner-Wolfson also described the details of the
special-fees budget. For the next academic year, the un
dergraduate special-fee will be $84 per quarter. This is
a slight decrease from this year's special fee, which was
$86 for the fall and winter quarters, and $84 in the
spring for undergraduate students. The decrease in
next year's special fees was attributed to the decrease in
the number students demanding special-fees refunds
this year.
The Senate unanimously passed both budgets,
which had already been approved by the GSC.
Twelve funding bills, totaling $18,361, were pre
sented to the Senate after receiving a green light
from the Appropriations Committee. Several of the
student groups that requested money to be allocated
from the general-fees fund were Cardinal Calypso,
the Volleyball Club and the Middle East Issues Dia
logue Group.
Former ASSU Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior, said
that the Senate should remain cautious when-allocating
funds. While the Senate typically approves $1(),(KK) to
$15,(MX) in funding each week, it has passed an average
of $ 18,249 each week for the past three meetings.
Lin called attention to the proposed $3,5(X) of fund
ing for Stanford Raagapella, stating that the Senate
usually doesn't approve the costs of recording CDs for
a cappella groups. He also said that the $5,750 approved

for the Black Graduation Committee seemed excessive
fora one-day event in the context of what is being spent
on other commencement ceremonies.
Senator Danny Arbeiter, a freshman and member of
the Appropriations Committee, said that because this
was Raagapella's first CD. the a cappella group was
being subsidized under the agreement that the CD

would be sold at a cheap rate. ASSU Vice President
Aneto Okonkwo, a junior, also stated that the gradua
tion ceremony shouldn't be compared to others and
that even though it is a one-day event, it represents the
culmination of four years of work.
Ultimately, all 12 funding bills were approved by the
Senate, as were the budget modifications.
