# New students backpack, camp
## Pre-orientation outdoors trip looks to expand 
### JIN YOON 
Camping under the stars, hiking along the trails of
the Sierra Nevada and fostering friendships in a re
laxed environment without any school work — these
are all part of the Stanford Pre-Orientation Trip, or
SPOT, scheduled to take place before New Student
Orientation.
The five-day backpacking program was initiated
in 2003 in an attempt to help transfer students adjust
to Stanford, said Sarah Rubinfeld, a graduate stu
dent in civil and environmental engineering and one
of the program's coordinators. In its first year, only
transfer students could participate, but in 2004,
SPOT expanded to include selected incoming fresh
men from the Northeast. Out of 50 freshmen who ap
plied, 27 embarked on the journey along with 23
transfer students.
"Everyone involved with SPOT is committed to ex
panding the program so that it will eventually serve all
interested new students," Rubinfeld said. "Participat
ing in a program like SPOT allows new students a
chance to meet other new students before classes
begin. The bonding that takes place within the small
groups eases the transition to Stanford and provides a
basis for ongoing friendships."
According to Rubinfeld, the SPOT program has
positively impacted the Stanford community at large.
"Staff members who have been exposed to the pro
gram have seen the impact of its affects on participants
in areas ranging from room-draw to academic advis
ing," she said.
SPOT also offers outdoor leadership experience
and training for trip leaders, who are current students
or young alumni.
"It was great," said junior Andrew Gradman, who
participated in SPOT in 2004. "I met some of my best
friends there."
He added that he thought the trip was well orga
nized.
Although SPOT is backed by the Freshmen Dean's
Office and has received positive feedback from partic
ipants, Rubinfeld said that expanding the program has
not been easy and coordinators are still long a way
from expanding the program to include "all interested
students."
The difficulty of opening the program to all inter
ested new students stems in part from its limited re
sources. Rubinfled said that the SPOT program needs
"new trip leaders willing to commit their time, people
to train the new leaders, storage space for equipment
and funding from the University" in order to run ef
fectively.
"There is no single resource that is limiting SPOT'S
growth — it simply takes time to build up an infra
structure to support this type of program." she added.
Central to the expansion of SPOT is increasing the
number of trip leaders, Rubinfeld said. In conjunction
with publicity efforts to promote the program campus
wide, more training trips and workshops have been of
fered to prospective trip leaders this year.
SPOT organizers are also seeking funding that
would allow part-time University staff members to
commit their time to the program. They are also trying
to cultivate a partnership with the Haas Center for
Public Service in order to implement community ser
vice trips as part of the SPOT program.
