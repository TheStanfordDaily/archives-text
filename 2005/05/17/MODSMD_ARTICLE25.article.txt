## Soto Tape Chronicles FC Barcelona: the royalty of Spanish futbol 
### 
On Saturday night in Valencia,
Spain, F.C. Barcelona took the
field against lowly Levante C.F.
to try to secure its first Spanish league
title in six years. A few minutes before
kickoff it was announced that Seville and
Real Madrid drew in their match, so
Barca needed only a tie to raise the tro
phy. Ninety minutes later, after both
teams had managed to score one goal
apiece, the whistle blew and it was all
over.
The past couple of days have seen the

Catalan capital en
veloped in a party of the
size usually reserved for
San Fermin in Pam
plona. One million fans
took to the streets,
cheered on the team as
players toured the city in
an open-air bus and
filled the stadium for an
extravagant celebration.

My grandmother said that people honked
their horns as they drove down the street
and wave flags out of their windows.
Soccer is a big deal in Europe. Every
one knows that. But this trophy is partic
ularly meaningful to Barcelona fans be
cause it has been so long since we've tast
ed success. In the past six years Barca has
not won any hardware. It has lost to sec
ond- and third-division opponents in the
early rounds of the King's Cup, an elimi
nation tournament that is played concur
rently with the regular season. One year
they even failed to finish in the top four
for the first time in more than a decade.
Meanwhile, as I alluded to in a column
about Spanish soccer in November, dur
ing the prolonged dry spell, Barca fans
had to watch their arch-nemesis Real
Madrid celebrate two European champi
onships, win two Spanish championships
and be proclaimed by FIFA to be the best
club of the century.
I'm not a typical Barcelona fan. I don't
live in Spain, and if I'm lucky I make it to
one or two games when I visit my family.
However, I read the local soccer newspa
per on a daily basis and regularly watch
live updates of games in progress.
I wonder how I became such a big
Barcelona fan. Sure, my mom and grand
father probably had something to do with
it. Avi was one of the longest-running
season ticket holders in club history.
When she was six. Mom once ran onto
the field to present a flower to the team
captain during pre-game warmups. But
beyond my family's influence, there is a
specific moment that established my love
for the team.
I'm no developmental psychologist,
but it seems that at a certain point one's
sports consciousness suddenly blossoms.
For example, I started liking baseball
after Dad took me to see my first game at
Tiger Stadium. I began following Michi
gan basketball after my third-grade stu
dent teacher mentioned the incoming re
cruiting class that people were calling the
Fab Five. I started rooting for the Red
Wings because of the photos and jerseys
on the walls of my barbershop.
For Barcelona soccer, it was its victory
in the 1992 UEFA Champions League,
the Holy Grail of European club soccer,
that made me aware of a world outside of
the Ann Arbor U8 recreational league.
My sudden fandom coincided with the
most successful stretch in F.C. Barcelona
history. Under the command of Johann
Cruyff, who earned the nickname the
Flying Dutchman as a stellar forward in
the 19705, Barca had a magical Dream
Team (the in vogue term used to describe
everything exceptional in those years fol
lowing the '92 Barcelona Olympics) that
won every trophy in sight.
Somewhere in my grandmother's attic
is the video of that unforgettable Cham
pions League final. I have watched it so
many times that I know the announcer's
call by heart. I still remember the starting
lineup, and I have old newspaper pho
tographs stored away for posterity.
As the 13th anniversary of the game
rolls around. I will celebrate the new tri
umph vicariously with all of Barcelona. I
can't rest easy, though, because there is
still work to be done: Next year Barca
wants to contend for the Champions
League, so the offensive stars need to be
re-signed and the defense needs to be im
proved. As 1 write this column, president
Joan Laporta is in Beijing negotiating a
deal to put promotional sponsorship on
the front of the jerseys for the first time in
the club's 106-year history. While the
revenue will help team finances, it signals
the end of an era of purity where the team
shield was all that adorned the uniforms.
1 have no power over these sporting
and economic decisions, but as a fan I
care deeply about the outcome. That
being said, it's really nice to worry about
these things and know that, deep down,
you're the champions.
