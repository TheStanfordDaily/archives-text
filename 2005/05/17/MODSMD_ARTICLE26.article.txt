## Pac-10 title a first for women 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's track and field team captured
its first ever Pacific-10 Conference title last weekend,
breaking UCLA's eight-year reign at its own stadium.
The Cardinal left favorites UCLA, Southern California
and Arizona State in the dust, scoring 173 points to the
runner-up Bruins' 125.
The men placed sixth in the team standings with 66
points; Oregon won the men's team competition with 152
points.
"I'm extremely happy with the results of the women,"
men's head coach Robert Weir said. "The programs to
gether support each other very, very well, and to have
one of the teams be successful is always a great thing. I
couldn't be happier for the women's team and for the
head coach."
"I think we competed well," said head coach Edrick
Floreal, who has been at the Farm coaching the sprinters
and jumpers, as well as serving as the women's coach, for
five years. "A lot of people stepped up and did a great
job. Something like 21 of the girls scored within the top
five and if you do that it's going to be hard for anyone to
stop you."
The Cardinal women said they used the meet's setting
to their advantage.
"It was a motivating factor," Floreal said. "We
weren't the favorites, so it was a lot easier to win, and
there wasn't a better place for people to be competitive."
On Saturday, Senior Alicia Craig and freshman Erica
McLain began the women's weekend of domination,
with victories in the 10,000-meter run and the long jump,
respectively.
"Alicia had to run by herself," Floreal said. "But she
had to get the performance done to get qualified for na
tionals, so she just kicked it off from the beginning and
ran exactly the pace she had to do. But then again, she is
such a stud we just expect that from her."
Craig finished in 34:02.79, more than a minute ahead
of second-place finisher Victoria Jackson of Arizona
State, who finished in 35:24.43. Freshmen Lindsay Flacks
and Katie Harrington finished third and fifth, respective
ly. Flacks' time of 35:30.82 was the fifth-best freshman
10,000-meter mark in school history.
McLain's win in the long jump was a meet upset in ad
dition to being a freshman school record, the second-best
mark in school history and a Regional qualifying mark.
McLain jumped 21 '2.5", well ahead of runner-up and fa
vorite Candice Baucham of UCLA, who jumped
20'7.75".
The Cardinal tallied 21 points in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase with second, third, fifth and sixth place fin
ishes. Sophomore Katy Trotter finished in 10:24.71,
while senior Jeane Goff took third in 10:29.53. Freshman
Lindsay Allen's performance earned a fifth-place finish
in 10:31.99.
"Considering she's a freshman and it was real hot
[Allen was impressive]," Floreal said. "And the last thing
you wanted to do was run 3,000-meters in the pretty good
heat. That was fantastic. The steeplechase was a huge
boost, coming up with that many points on the first day of
the meet helped tremendously."
Freshman Danielle Maier finished sixth and qualified
for Regionals with a freshman school record mark of
150'2" in the javelin.
