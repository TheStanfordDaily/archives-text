# Tennis bounced by Waves
## Stanford knocked out in second round of NCAAs, 4-2 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 22 Stanford men's tennis team had a score
to settle with No. 9 Pepperdine going into the NCAA
tournament this past weekend. The Cardinal (14-11,
4-3 Pacific-10Conference) had lost. 4-3, to the Waves
on April 12 and were looking for revenge.
Stanford defeated No. 39 University of San Diego
in the first round to meet Pepperdine in the second
round of the tournament. Playing at the Ralphs-
Straus Tennis Center in Malibu, Calif., on Sunday,
Stanford came within games of victory. Despite win
ning four of the first sets in singles, the Cardinal could
not close out the match and were handed a 4-2 defeat.
"In singles, we came out and we showed them we
meant business, and they took that punch of ours and
they fought back," head coach John Whitlinger said.
"I'm proud ol the whole team. We've fought hard all
year long, but just couldn't quite get over the hump.
The effort was definitely there, and I know Pepper
dine knew that they were in a match after it was
over."
Stanford kept the doubles lineup that it imple
mented at the end of the regular dual-match season
against Santa Clara. As was the case against the
Broncos, the No. 3 tandem of senior Sam Warburg
and junior KC Corkery were split up, with Warburg
pairing up with sophomore Eric McKean at the top
doubles position and Corkery teaming up with
sophomore James Wan at the second doubles posi
tion. Senior Phil Sheng and junior Jon Wong made up
the final doubles duo.
In April, Stanford was dealt losses in all three dou
bles matches, with two of the losses coming in
tiebreakers. On Sunday, Sheng and Wong won the
third doubles match for Stanford with an K-2 victory.
Pepperdine evened the score as Corkery and Wan
suffered an K-4 defeat. With the first point of the dual
match depending on the remaining doubles match,
Pepperdine's team led by a break at 7-5 and then pro
ceeded to break Warburg's serve to clinch the dou
bles point.
As singles play began this past weekend, the Car
dinal evened the score at one apiece when No. 1 War
burg defeated No. 34 Scott Doerner in a decisive 6-0,
6-1 victory, only giving up a single game at the very
end of the second set. While Corkery was 20-3 at the
second singles position heading into Sunday's match,
the Ail-American was handed a defeat by No. 25
Pedro Rico.
"I really felt confident that KC could beat Rico,
but it was one of those days where Rico was just a lit
tle bit better," Whitlinger said. "I think that's the

match KC's going to win the majority of the time, but
I've got to give credit to Rico. He's a tough player
who really fights hard, and he had the crowd behind
him. I was surprised [about the results] because KC's
been playing so well, but I'll pick KC any day of the
week."
At the third singles position, Wan's was the only
other match to finish in straight sets. The sophomore
edged out his opponent in a tiebreaker for the first set
and proceeded to win the second set, 6-2.
The remaining matches all went to three sets, and
Stanford needed two of the final three matches to
win. Sheng and freshman Phil Kao won their first sets
while McKean gave up his first set 6-2. However, the
second sets all went the opposite way as Sheng and
Kao lost their second sets, 6-2 and 6-3, respectively,
and McKean won his at 6-4.
Kao was the next to finish his match as he tallied a
6-2 loss in his final set. With his fall, Stanford would
now have to win both of the remaining matches.
Sheng was down a break in the third set, and his op
ponent served out the match and seized the win for
Pepperdine on the first match point as McKean was
serving for his match at 5-4. If McKean were to hold
serve, Sunday's loss to the Waves would have been
the Cardinal's seventh 4-3 loss this season.
"I've got to give a lot of credit to the guys [who
played the fourth through sixth singles spots),"
Whitlinger said. "They fought like heck and have im
proved the last month of the season, the last three
weeks especially in practice. They were playing a ton
better, and I was really proud of the way they fought,
the way they played and I have no problem with the
effort that they gave."
En route to Sunday's match, the Cardinal won the
doubles point against San Diego by capturing the first
and third doubles matches, with Sheng and Wong's
victory coming in a tiebreaker.
Stanford won all six of the first sets of singles, and
Corkery, Wan and McKean finished their matches
first to clinch the Stanford victory. Per NCAA tour
nament rules, the remaining matches were not com
pleted. Warburg and Sheng were trailing 3-5 and 2-5
in their second sets, respectively, and Kao led 7-5,4-
1 when Stanford claimed the victory.
"[San Diego's] a dangerous team," Whitlinger
said. "They played a tough match against Pepperdine
in the West [Coast] Conference Final. I was really
happy and proud of the way our guys played that
match; they were all business and came out and did a
really good job."
Warburg and Corkery will return to Stanford fora
few days before they head to College Station, Texas,
to compete in the individual NCAA tournament.
Warburg is the second seed for singles, and he and
Corkery have both earned All-American status again
for their seedings in the tournament. The duo is also
the second seed for doubles and will begin play a
week from tomorrow.

suffered an K-4 defeat. With the first point of the dual
match depending on the remaining doubles match,
Pepperdine's team led by a break at 7-5 and then pro
ceeded to break Warburg's serve to clinch the dou
bles point.
As singles play began this past weekend, the Car
dinal evened the score at one apiece when No. 1 War
burg defeated No. 34 Scott Doerner in a decisive 6-0,
6-1 victory, only giving up a single game at the very
end of the second set. While Corkery was 20-3 at the
second singles position heading into Sunday's match,
the Ail-American was handed a defeat by No. 25
Pedro Rico.
"I really felt confident that KC could beat Rico,
but it was one of those days where Rico was just a lit
tle bit better," Whitlinger said. "I think that's the

match KC's going to win the majority of the time, but
I've got to give credit to Rico. He's a tough player
who really fights hard, and he had the crowd behind
him. I was surprised [about the results] because KC's
been playing so well, but I'll pick KC any day of the
week."
At the third singles position, Wan's was the only
other match to finish in straight sets. The sophomore
edged out his opponent in a tiebreaker for the first set
and proceeded to win the second set, 6-2.
The remaining matches all went to three sets, and
Stanford needed two of the final three matches to
win. Sheng and freshman Phil Kao won their first sets
while McKean gave up his first set 6-2. However, the
second sets all went the opposite way as Sheng and
Kao lost their second sets, 6-2 and 6-3, respectively,
and McKean won his at 6-4.
Kao was the next to finish his match as he tallied a
6-2 loss in his final set. With his fall, Stanford would
now have to win both of the remaining matches.
Sheng was down a break in the third set, and his op
ponent served out the match and seized the win for
Pepperdine on the first match point as McKean was
serving for his match at 5-4. If McKean were to hold
serve, Sunday's loss to the Waves would have been
the Cardinal's seventh 4-3 loss this season.
"I've got to give a lot of credit to the guys [who
played the fourth through sixth singles spots),"
Whitlinger said. "They fought like heck and have im
proved the last month of the season, the last three
weeks especially in practice. They were playing a ton
better, and I was really proud of the way they fought,
the way they played and I have no problem with the
effort that they gave."
En route to Sunday's match, the Cardinal won the
doubles point against San Diego by capturing the first
and third doubles matches, with Sheng and Wong's
victory coming in a tiebreaker.
Stanford won all six of the first sets of singles, and
Corkery, Wan and McKean finished their matches
first to clinch the Stanford victory. Per NCAA tour
nament rules, the remaining matches were not com
pleted. Warburg and Sheng were trailing 3-5 and 2-5
in their second sets, respectively, and Kao led 7-5,4-
1 when Stanford claimed the victory.
"[San Diego's] a dangerous team," Whitlinger
said. "They played a tough match against Pepperdine
in the West [Coast] Conference Final. I was really
happy and proud of the way our guys played that
match; they were all business and came out and did a
really good job."
Warburg and Corkery will return to Stanford fora
few days before they head to College Station, Texas,
to compete in the individual NCAA tournament.
Warburg is the second seed for singles, and he and
Corkery have both earned All-American status again
for their seedings in the tournament. The duo is also
the second seed for doubles and will begin play a
week from tomorrow.
