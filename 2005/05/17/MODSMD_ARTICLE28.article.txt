# Lue ready to lead Stanford's charge in NCAAs
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If one were listing the key attributes fora
successful golfer, a few would rise to the top.
Patience is a must. The little white ball is
a formidable foe, and one bad hole can turn
into a terrible round with a small dose of
temper.
Strong nerves, particularly when standing
over a testy four-footer for par, are essential.
And, oh yeah, a strong back. The ups and
downs of thousands of rounds of golf and rig
ors of competition can always teach patience
and resolve under pressure. Hut try this on for
size: bend, rotate, torque, repeat. One hun
dred times. 1 lilting an industrial range bucket
worth of drives will test out muscles that the
folks at Nautilus haven't discovered yet.
Week after week, year after year, the
daily grind quickly becomes just that.
Junior Stephanie Lue thought she had all
the ingredients in place. And who would
have said otherwise?
A stranger to golf until the age of 15, Lue
picked the game up in a hurry after a golf
camp at the local country club. After the club
pro labeled her as someone with "potential,"
everything else, including her former pas
sion, tennis, was history.
Her first entry into the competitive
arena? A victory at an American Junior Golf
Association qualifier and a fourth-place fin
ish at the AJCJA tournament.
"I was pretty much off and running from
there," Lue said. "Up until I finished so well
in that tournament, I didn't even think col
lege golf was an option for me. My dad and I
made up my resume and sent it out to a few
coaches. I came on a recruiting trip [to Stan
ford] and loved it here. Later, I found out I
got in.and said Well, of course I 'm going to
Stanford!'"
After a year at the Farm, all was coming
together for Lue, as she was learning the col
lege game under the leadership of a host of
veterans on a team that was a perennial con
tender for the national championship.
Then, at the end of her freshman year, she
began to feel some pain in her back. Just
some muscle soreness — nothing to lose
sleep about. The summer offseason and fall
of her sophomore year passed with incident
until she felt pain again in February, this
time in a different spot.
"I just played through the pain for most of
the spring," Lue said. "I was playing well, so
1 didn't think much about it. Over the sum
mer, it just got worse, so I figured I should
get it checked out."
In the fall of this year, the verdict was in:
the pain was a result of a stress fracture to
her lumbar spine. So she sat for most of the
fall season and all of the winter break. She
was forbidden to hit so much as a putt in
practice.
The Cardinal roster, already small at six
players, was reduced to five, the number
each team competes with on a weekly basis.
"From October to February. 1 didn't do
anything golf-related," Lue said.
When the team began its spring schedule,
Lue was just beginning to hold a club again.
"I started taking full swings, and I was hit

ting it more solidly than I had in the fall, so 1
thought. I guess the recovery process won't
he as bad as I thought it would be,"' Lue said.
"Then I played in a few tournaments, and
you realize it's not so much the physical part
as getting the mental toughness back that 1
had last year."
Trying to get the edge back. Lue also
found herself playing into shape in some of
Stanford's most important tournaments dur
ing the season's stretch run. Despite the dif
ficulty of missing so much time, Lue is grad
ually finding her rhythm as the Cardinal
wrap up their season and prepare for next
year's campaign.
"In terms of team dynamics, we definite
ly missed Steph's presence when she
couldn't practice or travel with us," senior
Wendra Liang said. "It has been great to see
her make such a comeback — her ballstrik
ing is more solid than ever, and seeing her
give KM) percent in getting back to competi
tive form has been motivational for us all."
Today, Lue and the rest of the Cardinal
gear up for their final rounds of the year at
the NCAA Championship in Sunriver, Ore.
Playing in its 17th consecutive national
championship, Stanford will try to take

home the team title for the first time ever.
Despite weather reports calling for chilly
temperatures and rainy skies for most of the
week at the Sunriver Resort, coach Caroline
O'Connor's memories of the par-71 6,312-
yard Meadows Golf Course should be decid
edly warmer. O'Connor's team came as
close to hoisting a championship trophy as it
ever has — a second-place finish behind
Arizona State — when the tournament was
last hosted at Sunriver in 2(KX).
For the only time this year, teams will
compete for four rounds over four days, in
stead of the customary three-round format.
The field of 24 teams will fight out the
climax to the marathon eight-month golf
season. Once again, the favorites in this
year's tournament hail from the country's
coasts.
No. 2 UCLA is the defending national
champion and returns three players —
Charlotte Mayorkas, Susie Mathews and
Hannah Jun — from the team that set the
all-time NCAA Championship scoring
record a year ago. As for the remaining
openings, freshman Amie Cochran was
named to the All-Pacific-10 Conference
First Team and was edged out of the Fresh

man of the Year award by Arizona State's
Louise Stable, the No. 1 player in the coun
try.
In addition to one of the nation's most tal
ented rosters, the Bruins also arrive in Ore
gon with more momentum than any team in
the field. UCLA has reeled off five consecu
tive victories entering today's first round (it
was February the last time the Bruins failed
to win a tournament), including successful
title defenses at the Pac-10 Championship
and the NCAA West Regional.
Before the Bruins load the trophy in the
team van, however, they will have to deal
with No. 1 Duke, a team with its own world
class talent and no shortage of reasons to
face the Bruins. It was UCLA, after all, that
set fire to the Blue Devils' storybook 2003-
2004 season by stealing a national title from
the overwhelming favorites from Durham,
N.C.
Last year's Duke team, considered by
many to be the best women's collegiate
squad of all time, played to show that records
were made to be broken, winning 10 of its 11
tournaments and shattering numerous his
torical school marks in the process. Yet, de
spite having all five of their players ranked in
the nation's top 15 individually, the Blue
Devils fell to a red-hot UCLA group in the
final event.
This year's Duke team has fought to
claim a No. 1 regular-season ranking despite
a roster of just five players (much like Stan
ford's predicament for much of the year) and
having to travel the NCAA-minimum four
to multiple events. To battle the rainy Ore
gon conditions and claim Duke's third na
tional championship would be sweet, to say
the least.
"We are going to need to be tough,"
coach Dan Brooks said. "I have been look
ing at the 10-day forecast, and the highs are
in the low 60s and the lows in the 30s. They
have had a rainy spring. We are going to
have more of that. All these reasons we will
have to be mentally strong and patient. I
think the numbers are going to be pretty low,
but it is an extremely tough course."
As for No. 23 Stanford, the Cardinal
enter today's round with some momentum
of their own. After being picked by many to
miss the cut for its 17th consecutive national
championship appearance, Stanford fought
through arguably the toughest of the three
regional tournaments to capture the final
team bid to this week's event.
With so many talented teams in the final
field of the year, the key for the Cardinal will
be to hang around through the early rounds,
which have been a struggle at times for Stan
ford, and look to make a move late in the
week.
"You can't win a golf tournament after
the first round," Lue said. "But you can def
initely take yourself out of contention by
playing poorly."
Every member of the Cardinal's young
lineup boasts NCAA Championship experi
ence, led by Liang, who makes her third ap
pearance this year. Sophomore Lauren
Todd's 44th-place finish a year ago is the best
championship showing for any member of
O'Connor's lineup.
