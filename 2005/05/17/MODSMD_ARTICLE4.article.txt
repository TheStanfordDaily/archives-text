# Iraqi students to visit campus
## Stanford hosts students from Iraqi universities for 10 days 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Five Iraqi university students will arrive on campus
late today to participate in a 10-day event spearheaded
by the Stanford-Iraq Student Exchange, or SISE. This
student group, formed with the help of faculty sponsor
Coit Blacker, director of the Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies, was created to develop what it calls an
exchange between Iraqi and American college atten

dees.
SISE selected the Iraqi students — three women and
two men — from an initial pool of 100 applicants. They
hail from different regions of Iraq and represent various
ethnic and religious backgrounds. Even their academic
interests are diverse; English, political science and engi
neering are among the subjects they plan to pursue.
Organizers of SISE have planned a number of events
on campus for the students, including meetings and pre
sentations with other student organizations and faculty
in their respective areas of academic interests. Deputy
Director of SISE Nikhil Sachdev, a sophomore, said
SISE hopes that these students will get a taste of Amer
ican college life and make lasting connections with both
students and professors.
"In an idealistic sense, we hope to build
mutual trust and understanding between
Iraqi and American students," Sachdev said.
The Iraqi students will speak about their
personal experiences during a welcome din
ner on Saturday night hosted by Stanford's
Islamic Society. There will also be an inter
faith dialogue next Wednesday on religious
pluralism in America, sponsored by the Of
fice of Religious Life. The discussion will be
moderated by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neu
mann, senior associate dean for religious
life.
"I hope that this will be a free exchange
where the Iraqi students can get a sense of
how we do religious pluralism and the vari
ety of religions we have in America," Karlin-
Neumann said. "On the Stanford side, I
hope students will see how religion is experi
enced in Iraq."
All members of the Stanford community
will have the opportunity to interact with the
Iraqi students and SISE leaders at the
"Forum on Improving Iraqi-American Rela

tions," an event scheduled for next Monday.
The event will include a panel discussion
with Political Science Prof. Larry Diamond
and Hoover Institution Fellow Bill Evers.
They will go sightseeing in San Francisco
and Sacramento, where they will meet with
state legislators and visit the secretary of
state's office to learn more about democracy
and the electoral process, Sachdev said.
"We hope to allow the Iraqis to experi
ence student life and American culture,"
said senior J.P. Schnapper-Casteras, direc
tor of SISE. "We hope to expose them to de
mocratic institutions, civil society, communi
ty service and interfaith dialogue as they
occur in the United States."
Evers said that the visit will be a unique
opportunity for both the Iraqi students and
their Stanford peers who organized the trip.
"It will be interesting for someone who's
been in a country that's been closed off for
the past 30 years to get a sense of how other
people are living," Evers said. "At the same
time, this has been an amazing challenge for
Stanford students who dealt with not only
University administrators, but also Ameri
can federal, state and Iraqi bureaucracies. In
general, it should be a valuable experience
for everyone involved."
Blacker, who has aided student groups
running exchange programs with the Soviet

Union and Asian nations, agreed with Evers.
"People carry around stereotypes of
what it means to be an Iraqi and what it
means to be an American." Backer said.
"It's not very often that these stereotypes
are backed up by firsthand knowledge.
Programs such as this serve to humanize
people and give a deeper understanding of
our differences."
The idea for the Iraqi students' visit was
first pitched by Schnapper-Casteras, who
initiated SISE last spring after taking a sem
inar on democracy promotion from Political
Science Prof. Michael McFaul.
"Historically, exchanges have been in
strumental in promoting democratic ideals
and establishing democratic institutions
abroad." Schnapper-Casteras said. "I was
dismayed to discover that there were essen
tially no such programs in Iraq and decided
to do something about it."
According to Sachdev, the exchange has
been in the works since the beginning of the
school year. The group had to win the ap
proval of Stanford administrators, make
contact with Iraqi universities and design ap
plications.
Sachdev said SISE hopes to eventually
establish a close relationship with an Iraqi
university so that Stanford students can at
tend, making this initiative a true exchange.
