# Journalists address media credibility
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The same day that Newsweek retracted a story that
many believe contributed to deadly riots in Pakistan
and Afghanistan, three professional journalists
speaking on campus yesterday offered divergent
views on the debacle's implications. The event was
pulled together at the last minute after Newsweek Ed
itor Mark Whitaker canceled his scheduled John S.
Knight Lecture.
At a panel discussion on media credibility in the age
of 24 / 7 news, sponsored by Stanford's Knight Fellow
ships program, Portland Oregonian Editor Sandra
Mims Rowe said Newsweek's gaffe would lead news
organizations to be more careful about how they use
anonymous sources. Newsweek has admitted that the
May 1 story — which alleged that U.S. interrogators at
Guantanamo Bay had flushed the Koran down a toilet
to unsettle Muslim detainees — was based on the
word of a single anonymous government source.
"There's a huge gap between thinking you know
something and knowing something," Rowe said.
"That's a gap that we have to close."
Rowe's fellow panelists said they envision more
wide-ranging consequences.
Tim Porter, author of the journalism blog First
Draft, said Newsweek's mistake was indicative of a
skewed set of values on the part of major news media
institutions.
"The value system rewards scoops," Porter said.
"It's internally based. It's journalists valuing the work
of other journalists, rather than a value system based
on benefit to the community or benefit to the reader."
Porter said he hoped that the decline in the public's
confidence in the news media, fueled by incidents like
the Newsweek story, would spur a long-term shift in
priorities away from speed and exclusivity and toward
context, collaboration and accuracy.
