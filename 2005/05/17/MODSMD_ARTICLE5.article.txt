# Journalists address media credibility
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The same day that Newsweek retracted a story that
many believe contributed to deadly riots in Pakistan
and Afghanistan, three professional journalists
speaking on campus yesterday offered divergent
views on the debacle's implications. The event was
pulled together at the last minute after Newsweek Ed
itor Mark Whitaker canceled his scheduled John S.
Knight Lecture.
At a panel discussion on media credibility in the age
of 24 / 7 news, sponsored by Stanford's Knight Fellow
ships program, Portland Oregonian Editor Sandra
Mims Rowe said Newsweek's gaffe would lead news
organizations to be more careful about how they use
anonymous sources. Newsweek has admitted that the
May 1 story — which alleged that U.S. interrogators at
Guantanamo Bay had flushed the Koran down a toilet
to unsettle Muslim detainees — was based on the
word of a single anonymous government source.
"There's a huge gap between thinking you know
something and knowing something," Rowe said.
"That's a gap that we have to close."
Rowe's fellow panelists said they envision more
wide-ranging consequences.
Tim Porter, author of the journalism blog First
Draft, said Newsweek's mistake was indicative of a
skewed set of values on the part of major news media
institutions.
"The value system rewards scoops," Porter said.
"It's internally based. It's journalists valuing the work
of other journalists, rather than a value system based
on benefit to the community or benefit to the reader."
Porter said he hoped that the decline in the public's
confidence in the news media, fueled by incidents like
the Newsweek story, would spur a long-term shift in
priorities away from speed and exclusivity and toward
context, collaboration and accuracy.
But former Wired magazine editor Katrina Heron
said it's too late for all that. Tradi
tional national media institutions
like Newsweek "are headed the
way of the dodo," she said, since
the Internet has opened access to
so many different sources of news
from around the world.
"The public is way ahead of the
curve, already engaged in new ex
plorations," she said. "People tell
me constantly, 'I read this interest
ing thing in Al-Jazeera today.' "
The audience was relatively
small but attentive and participato
ry. Attendees included Newsweek
San Francisco Bureau Chief Karen
Breslau, who took the microphone
at the end of the panel to offer her
perspective on the discussion.
"One thing I'd like people to
think about is how few news orga
nizations left aspire to and have the
resources to do foreign news cov

erage," Breslau said. "I don't ever
want Al-Jazeera to he my news
source."
Breslau added that hlogs, as
useful as they might be in some re
gards, are no substitute for on-the
ground reporting by trained jour
nalists who strive to report the
news objectively.
Other questioners in the audi
ence worried that the Newsweek
scandal would have a "chill effect,"
prompting major news organiza
tions to refrain from publishing
controversial stories.
The panelists responded that
there is still a place for anonymous
sourcing in investigative coverage,
but that there is no excuse for
printing a story based on the word
of one anonymous individual.
Still, the journalists expressed
empathy for Whitaker.
"These mistakes get made and
they are unforgivable, but on some
level they are understandable,"
Rowe said. "You have to be in
credibly vigilant about the infor
mation you're dealing with, and

you have to know on some very
profound level that you're influ
encing lives and potentially deaths
also."
Communication Prof. Jim Bet
tinger, director of the Knight Fel
lowships program, said Whitaker
called him at 5:44 p.m. Sunday to
say he wouldn't he able to give his
lecture, entitled "Choices in an
Age of 24 / 7 News." the following
day. The Knight Fellowships pro
gram acted quickly to cancel a fol
low-up symposium scheduled for
today and enlist two of its partici
pants to talk last night.
Knight Fellows in the audience
said they felt the panel raised inter
esting issues, even though no con
sensus emerged.
"People, both the public and
journalists, are very concerned
about media credibility," said
Phillip Davis, a Knight Fellow who
regularly works as a correspondent
for National Public Radio.
"There's a feeling that some proac
tive steps need to be taken. That's
a good sign."
