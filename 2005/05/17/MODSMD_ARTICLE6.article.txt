# Prize-winning German poet reads his work

### BONNIE SWIFT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before a pinstriped and pleated crowd, poet Durs
Gruenbein made a brief appearance at Stanford yester
day to read his poetry. He read in German, while three
graduate students read the corresponding English trans
lations. The event drew people than expected and the
venue had to be switched to a room much larger than an
ticipated.
Gruenbein was the 1995 recipient of the Georg Buch
ner Prize, the most prestigious literary award in Ger
many. Born in what was then the East German city of
Dresden, Gruenbein was in his mid-twenties when the
Berlin Wall fell in 1988. In the years following, he became
one of the chief chroniclers of reunited Germany. He has
published five books of poetry, a collection of essays and
translations of John Ashbery, Samuel Beckett, Henri
Michaux, Aeschylus and others.
"In the 50 years of separation, there were almost two
national literatures," said Stanford Literature Prof. Hans
Ulrich Gumbrecht, who attended the reading. "Gruen-

bein was so young when Germany re
united, that many see him as repre
sentative of a generation that identi
fies itself as neither East nor West."
Indeed. The Frankfurter Allge
meine Zeitung, a German newspa
per. called Gruenbein the first poet
to overcome the division of Ger
many.
"Ashes for Breakfast," Gruen
bein's first volume of poetry to be
translated into English, has only
been recently released in the United
States. It took four vears for Michael

Hofman, the son of a German writer
living in England, to translate the
text.
Quoting Robert Frost, Gruen
bein said that "the first thing that is
lost in the translation of poetry' is po
etry itself." He was quick to add that
"the whimsicality that many people
see in Ashes for Breakfast comes di
rectly from the translator."
Whether the poem was a descrip
tion of an everyday activity such as
shaving or showering, a scene from
Berlin, or a memory from Dresden.
Greunbein's tone in German was
consistent and melodic throughout.
"What I like most about his poet
ry is the striking moments of bril
liance, which are almost sarcastic and
bitter," said Michael Hover, a gradu

ate student in comparative literature
who read the translations alongside
Gruenbein. She said it was difficult to
imitate his tonality in a different lan
guage, comparing it to musical inter
pretation.
In a poem about Los Angeles en
titled "Greetings from Oblivion
City," Gruenbein observed a quick
pace of "life in the solarium," which
invoked images that may have res
onated particularly well with some
members of his Stanford audience.
The reading was organized by the
German Studies Department, the di
vision of literatures, cultures and lan
guages research unit and the Euro
pean Forum. It is the first in a series
of readings dedicated to contempo
rary German literature.
