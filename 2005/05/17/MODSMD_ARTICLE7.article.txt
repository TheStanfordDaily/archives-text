# Obese workers have higher med costs, lower pay
## 
### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Many studies have shown that obese employees are
paid less on average than their slimmer colleagues, sug
gesting that appearance-based discrimination exists in
the workplace. But a new study conducted at the School
of Medicine has concluded that these workers are only
paid less when they are covered by employer-sponsored
health insurance.
Employers often estimate that obese workers will
have higher medical bills, so companies reduce their
overall pay, researchers have found.
Designed by Mary Kate Bundorf, assistant professor
of health research and policy, and Jayanta Bhat
tacharya, assistant professor of medicine, the study
aimed to determine who bears the economic
brunt of obese workers' medical costs.
The results of the study are particularly
relevant today due the increasing number of
obese people in the country. Bundorf said. In
2001,20.9 percent of U.S. adults were classi
fied as obese, an 8.9 percent increase since
1991. These Americans suffer from higher
rates of heart disease, diabetes and hyperten
sion.
Bhattacharya said his research was in
spired by labor economics literature on dif
ferences in wages for obese and non-obese
workers.
"Many researchers have attributed the
difference to prejudice on part of the em
ployers," he said. "Looking at data of cost of

obesity for health insurers and seeing that the
people who are obese tend to spend more on
health care, we thought these facts were cor
related. The reason why obese workers make
less is because health care costs are higher for
them."
Both Bundorf and Bhattacharya analyzed
statistics collected in the late 1990s correlat
ing employee pay and body weight. They
found that insured obese workers earned
$3.41 less per hour in 1998 compared to in
sured non-obese workers. Also, they found
that average-weight workers with employ
ment-based health insurance receive salary
increases more quickly than obese workers in
the same positions.
When they examined the wages of work
ers lacking employment-based health insur
ance, there was no difference in pay. The re
sults supported their hypothesis that employ
ers lower wages for insured employees that
they predict will have significant medical ex
penses.

Randy Livingston, vice president for busi
ness affairs and chief financial officer at Stan
ford. told The Daily that he is not aware of
"any policy or data that would suggest that
Stanford alters people's pay based on obesi
ty"
However. Bhattacharya said he assumes
the study's results apply to Stanford, since
the University insures its employees.
When asked about the ethical underpin
nings of the wage disparity. Bundorf said that
although many people tend to focus on possi
ble weight-based discrimination, their find
ings showed that discriminatory behavior
was not purely appearance-based.
The report may be worrisome not only for
overweight workers, but also for anyone
whose health care is insured through their
employers, the researchers said.
"When employers give you health insur
ance, they're not giving you something for
nothing," Bhattacharya said in a press re
lease. "It's coming out of your paycheck.
