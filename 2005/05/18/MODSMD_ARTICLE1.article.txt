# A 						trove of Stanford history
## Uncovering Frost 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
On the corner of Campus Drive and
Galvez St., the Arrillaga Alumni Center
stands prominently as a testament to Stan
ford's commitment to its past. But behind
the new building, enveloped within a grove
of tall trees, is Frost Amphitheater, a more
discreet, yet much more storied symbol of
Stanford history and tradition.
Many students may not be familiar with
the amphitheater, which can seat up to 7,000
people, but the cavernous space that now
mostly echoes with the chirping of birds and
skittering raccoons was once filled with the
booming of cannons, the blasting chords of
the Grateful Dead and the bellowing rheto
ric of world leaders.
A beautiful site, a difficult concert venue
Like the University, the Laurence Frost

Memorial Amphitheater is a dedication to a
lost son. Mr. and Mrs. Howard Frost donat
ed $90,000 to create a space that would con
tribute to the spiritual and cultural advance
ment of Stanford students for years to come
in honor of their son John Laurence Frost,
Class of 1935, who died of polio at age 23.
Under the direction of Palo Alto land
scape architect Leslie Kiler, Class of 1924,
Frost was designed to resemble the rolling
California foothills. The concave structure
sinks 22 feet below the original ground sur
face, and the terraced grass seating area
rises a similar distance above ground level.
Densely layered trees and plants surround
the amphitheater to give what Kiler called
"an effect of a heavily forested area."There
are approximately 150 varieties of trees
growing in and around the bowl, including
Apple, Birch, Elm, Mulberry and Cherry.

Fights at Frost leads to concert bans

While the natural feel of Frost is certainly part of its
charm, it is also what makes holding events there com
plicated.
Groups such as the Stanford Concert Network, or
SCN, and Stanford Lively Arts have been working to
keep Frost a part of the Stanford experience; however,
the amphitheater's architecture and the nature of
today's concert industry have made it difficult to sched
ule events there often.
With little infrastructure in the amphitheater besides
the stage itself, staging an event at Frost requires paying
for additional equipment. Moreover, working with big
name artists and production companies can be costly
and present many challenges.
Challenges and contention have long been a part of
Frost history. In the 19705, a fight broke out during a
rock concert, leading to a temporary rock music mora
torium in Frost.The venue's complexity is part of its cap
tivating history that has enriched the campus for
decades.
"Since Frost is such a large space and it is also sort of re
cessed, anything that's needed for the event to go on needs
to be shipped in there besides the stage and the stands," said
sophomore Josh Constine, who books medium-sized
events for SCN. Necessary equipment can include lighting,
garbage facilities and security measures, to name a few. "All
those things are quite costly," Constine said.
From Gorbachev to Tchaikovsky:
Stanford history at Frost
Frost opened in June of 1937, in time for the year's
Commencement exercises, which were held there with a
special service dedicating the amphitheater. When Frost
was built, Kiler chose foliage that would be at its best in
June, since Commencement ceremonies were intended
to be the most significant of the events held at the venue
each year. Red and white roses that would bloom every
June were planted around the stage. Commencement
was held in Frost until 1984, when it moved to Sunken
Diamond fora year before settling at Stanford Stadium.
Generations of alumni finished their Stanford ca
reers inside the amphitheater, listening to the venerable
guests invited to speak at Commencement, such as then-
United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold
in 1955 and then-U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl
Warren in 1964. In 1990, then-Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev visited Frost, where he announced to a
crowd of thousands. "The Cold War is now behind us.
Let us not wrangle over who won it."
The amphitheater has also been used for dramatic
productions such as the Speech and Drama Depart
ment's first outdoor show. "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," in 1958.
Frost is perhaps best suited, though, for musical per
formances.
In 1942, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra took ad
vantage of the amphitheater's acoustics with a perform
ance ofTchaikovsky's 1812 Overture that included real
cannon shots.
Now. most all of the musical events that take place in
Frost happen in the summer.
"One of the challenges with Frost is (hat given the
weather, the best time do concerts is late May, summer
and early fall — when most of the student body isn't
here," said Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe.
"I'd love to see more concerts there but it's going to be
hard to have very many because of weather issues."
The Stanford Lively Arts program holds a concert
each July 3; Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has been scheduled
for this year. This tradition has its roots in The Stanford
Summer Festival of the Arts, which began in at Frost in
1964 and brought in notable acts such as the Preserva
tion Hall Jazz Band. The Summer Festival lasted five
years and finally evolved into what is now today's Stan
ford Lively Arts program.
The Children's Health Council Summer Symphony is
the other annual event that takes place in Frost. Several
thousand Bay Area residents come each year to picnic in
the sun and listen to top notch performances to raise
funds for the Children's Health Council, a nonprofit
agency in Palo Alto dedicated to meeting the needs of
children with educational, behavioral and developmental
disorders.
"[The] Symphony is not always as student oriented
as it could be," Howe said, but she added that "the sym
phony fundraiser is really fun, and they have really good
acts every year. There's something about annual events

that over time work better in this environment."
RockiiT out at Frost: From fun to violence
Perhaps the most famous concerts to take place in
Frost were those of the Grateful Dead. The legendary
rock band got its start in the Bay Area and made Frost
Amphitheater one of its usual stops for years.
"One of their earliest concerts was performed on the
deck of Tresidder Union," Howe said. "For years they
would perform in Frost, even when they could sell out
larger venues. It was one of their favorite venues to per
form."
In fact, the arrival of the Dead is what brought about
the formation of the SCN.
"Originally the Grateful Dead began playing shows
here in the late '60s, and it the event was planned as
usual "Constine said."But since it was becoming a year
ly event, they started a committee to plan it, and that's
how the SCN was born."
With the Dead playing often at Frost, one could as
sume that the University was comfortable with the rock
music scene developing at Stanford. One concert in
1971, however, quickly changed that.
On July 18,1971, fights sporadically broke out among
the crowd during an afternoon concert featuring the
Elvin Bishop Group and Cold Blood. Flying fists and
bottles left several bloodied victims. In response to this
event, the University placed a suspension on rock con
certs in-Frost.
On Nov. 29,1971, the University Committee on Pub
lic Events, or COPE, formed a subcommittee to evalu
ate the problems surrounding rock concerts.
"Unfortunately, our experience with past rock con
certs in Frost Amphitheater has shown there are many
severe difficulties including physical and property dam
age, violence, robbery, drugs and other medical prob
lems," said School of Medicine Prof. John Bunker, who
chaired the subcommittee. "Acceptable solutions for
these must be found before the continuance of Frost
rock concerts can be allowed."
Then, after students crashed the gates and reported
ly broke out into fights at a Miles Davis concert on Oct.
1,1972, the moratorium was extended to not just rock
concerts, but all popular music concerts.
"Rock concerts by their very nature attract a certain
group of young people bent on making the event un
pleasant," Director of Public Events Tom Bacchetti said
in an Oct. 5, 1972 press release. "It was our hope that
other forms of popular music would not attract this
same segment of the population. Sadly, the Oct. 1 con
cert proved us wrong."
Music concerts are allowed at Frost nowadays and
while crowd control has since become less of an issue at
Frost, it is still a serious concern, along with noise con
siderations. This is especially true due to Frost's location
on campus.
"It's cornered to the Business School, Mem Aud, the
athletics field and the alumni center," explained the
SCN Director Alida Garcia, a senior. "Stanford's cam
pus is generally an over programmed campus, so it's
hard to find a day when all of those places don't have
something going on and you can use amplified sound."
Additionally, Frost's seating capacity makes it diffi
cult for groups such as the SCN to be able to afford big
name artists who could potentially sell out the venue.
"The concert scene has changed dramatically," Howe
said. "A lot of this is driven by the concert industry and
how much bands get paid and what they want their
sound and image to be."
Constine said that the SCN has tried to work around
these challenges with solutions such as booking less fa
mous acts. In June 2003, SCN brought the Latin-influ
enced ska band Ozomatli to Frost.
"It was a free show, which cut down on costs for secu
rity, and also the band was not predicted to sell out
Frost," said Constine, who explained that Ozomatli cost
less to book than a more popular group.
Garcia said the SCN has been working to come up
with more creative solutions to book concerts at Frost
and to budget appropriately for such an event so that
Frost can remain a beloved landmark.
"I think that we did a good job with the budget this
year so that next year it will be a possibility [to hold a
concert in Frost,]" Garcia said. "It's such a beautiful
venue, and it shouldn't go unused. Live music is not nec
essarily Stanford's priority — as it shouldn't be — but it
is my interest."

Fights at Frost leads to concert bans

While the natural feel of Frost is certainly part of its
charm, it is also what makes holding events there com
plicated.
Groups such as the Stanford Concert Network, or
SCN, and Stanford Lively Arts have been working to
keep Frost a part of the Stanford experience; however,
the amphitheater's architecture and the nature of
today's concert industry have made it difficult to sched
ule events there often.
With little infrastructure in the amphitheater besides
the stage itself, staging an event at Frost requires paying
for additional equipment. Moreover, working with big
name artists and production companies can be costly
and present many challenges.
Challenges and contention have long been a part of
Frost history. In the 19705, a fight broke out during a
rock concert, leading to a temporary rock music mora
torium in Frost.The venue's complexity is part of its cap
tivating history that has enriched the campus for
decades.
"Since Frost is such a large space and it is also sort of re
cessed, anything that's needed for the event to go on needs
to be shipped in there besides the stage and the stands," said
sophomore Josh Constine, who books medium-sized
events for SCN. Necessary equipment can include lighting,
garbage facilities and security measures, to name a few. "All
those things are quite costly," Constine said.
From Gorbachev to Tchaikovsky:
Stanford history at Frost
Frost opened in June of 1937, in time for the year's
Commencement exercises, which were held there with a
special service dedicating the amphitheater. When Frost
was built, Kiler chose foliage that would be at its best in
June, since Commencement ceremonies were intended
to be the most significant of the events held at the venue
each year. Red and white roses that would bloom every
June were planted around the stage. Commencement
was held in Frost until 1984, when it moved to Sunken
Diamond fora year before settling at Stanford Stadium.
Generations of alumni finished their Stanford ca
reers inside the amphitheater, listening to the venerable
guests invited to speak at Commencement, such as then-
United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold
in 1955 and then-U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl
Warren in 1964. In 1990, then-Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev visited Frost, where he announced to a
crowd of thousands. "The Cold War is now behind us.
Let us not wrangle over who won it."
The amphitheater has also been used for dramatic
productions such as the Speech and Drama Depart
ment's first outdoor show. "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," in 1958.
Frost is perhaps best suited, though, for musical per
formances.
In 1942, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra took ad
vantage of the amphitheater's acoustics with a perform
ance ofTchaikovsky's 1812 Overture that included real
cannon shots.
Now. most all of the musical events that take place in
Frost happen in the summer.
"One of the challenges with Frost is (hat given the
weather, the best time do concerts is late May, summer
and early fall — when most of the student body isn't
here," said Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe.
"I'd love to see more concerts there but it's going to be
hard to have very many because of weather issues."
The Stanford Lively Arts program holds a concert
each July 3; Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has been scheduled
for this year. This tradition has its roots in The Stanford
Summer Festival of the Arts, which began in at Frost in
1964 and brought in notable acts such as the Preserva
tion Hall Jazz Band. The Summer Festival lasted five
years and finally evolved into what is now today's Stan
ford Lively Arts program.
The Children's Health Council Summer Symphony is
the other annual event that takes place in Frost. Several
thousand Bay Area residents come each year to picnic in
the sun and listen to top notch performances to raise
funds for the Children's Health Council, a nonprofit
agency in Palo Alto dedicated to meeting the needs of
children with educational, behavioral and developmental
disorders.
"[The] Symphony is not always as student oriented
as it could be," Howe said, but she added that "the sym
phony fundraiser is really fun, and they have really good
acts every year. There's something about annual events

that over time work better in this environment."
RockiiT out at Frost: From fun to violence
Perhaps the most famous concerts to take place in
Frost were those of the Grateful Dead. The legendary
rock band got its start in the Bay Area and made Frost
Amphitheater one of its usual stops for years.
"One of their earliest concerts was performed on the
deck of Tresidder Union," Howe said. "For years they
would perform in Frost, even when they could sell out
larger venues. It was one of their favorite venues to per
form."
In fact, the arrival of the Dead is what brought about
the formation of the SCN.
"Originally the Grateful Dead began playing shows
here in the late '60s, and it the event was planned as
usual "Constine said."But since it was becoming a year
ly event, they started a committee to plan it, and that's
how the SCN was born."
With the Dead playing often at Frost, one could as
sume that the University was comfortable with the rock
music scene developing at Stanford. One concert in
1971, however, quickly changed that.
On July 18,1971, fights sporadically broke out among
the crowd during an afternoon concert featuring the
Elvin Bishop Group and Cold Blood. Flying fists and
bottles left several bloodied victims. In response to this
event, the University placed a suspension on rock con
certs in-Frost.
On Nov. 29,1971, the University Committee on Pub
lic Events, or COPE, formed a subcommittee to evalu
ate the problems surrounding rock concerts.
"Unfortunately, our experience with past rock con
certs in Frost Amphitheater has shown there are many
severe difficulties including physical and property dam
age, violence, robbery, drugs and other medical prob
lems," said School of Medicine Prof. John Bunker, who
chaired the subcommittee. "Acceptable solutions for
these must be found before the continuance of Frost
rock concerts can be allowed."
Then, after students crashed the gates and reported
ly broke out into fights at a Miles Davis concert on Oct.
1,1972, the moratorium was extended to not just rock
concerts, but all popular music concerts.
"Rock concerts by their very nature attract a certain
group of young people bent on making the event un
pleasant," Director of Public Events Tom Bacchetti said
in an Oct. 5, 1972 press release. "It was our hope that
other forms of popular music would not attract this
same segment of the population. Sadly, the Oct. 1 con
cert proved us wrong."
Music concerts are allowed at Frost nowadays and
while crowd control has since become less of an issue at
Frost, it is still a serious concern, along with noise con
siderations. This is especially true due to Frost's location
on campus.
"It's cornered to the Business School, Mem Aud, the
athletics field and the alumni center," explained the
SCN Director Alida Garcia, a senior. "Stanford's cam
pus is generally an over programmed campus, so it's
hard to find a day when all of those places don't have
something going on and you can use amplified sound."
Additionally, Frost's seating capacity makes it diffi
cult for groups such as the SCN to be able to afford big
name artists who could potentially sell out the venue.
"The concert scene has changed dramatically," Howe
said. "A lot of this is driven by the concert industry and
how much bands get paid and what they want their
sound and image to be."
Constine said that the SCN has tried to work around
these challenges with solutions such as booking less fa
mous acts. In June 2003, SCN brought the Latin-influ
enced ska band Ozomatli to Frost.
"It was a free show, which cut down on costs for secu
rity, and also the band was not predicted to sell out
Frost," said Constine, who explained that Ozomatli cost
less to book than a more popular group.
Garcia said the SCN has been working to come up
with more creative solutions to book concerts at Frost
and to budget appropriately for such an event so that
Frost can remain a beloved landmark.
"I think that we did a good job with the budget this
year so that next year it will be a possibility [to hold a
concert in Frost,]" Garcia said. "It's such a beautiful
venue, and it shouldn't go unused. Live music is not nec
essarily Stanford's priority — as it shouldn't be — but it
is my interest."
On the corner of Campus Drive and
Galvez St., the Arrillaga Alumni Center
stands prominently as a testament to Stan
ford's commitment to its past. But behind
the new building, enveloped within a grove
of tall trees, is Frost Amphitheater, a more
discreet, yet much more storied symbol of
Stanford history and tradition.
Many students may not be familiar with
the amphitheater, which can seat up to 7,000
people, but the cavernous space that now
mostly echoes with the chirping of birds and
skittering raccoons was once filled with the
booming of cannons, the blasting chords of
the Grateful Dead and the bellowing rheto
ric of world leaders.
A beautiful site, a difficult concert venue
Like the University, the Laurence Frost

Memorial Amphitheater is a dedication to a
lost son. Mr. and Mrs. Howard Frost donat
ed $90,000 to create a space that would con
tribute to the spiritual and cultural advance
ment of Stanford students for years to come
in honor of their son John Laurence Frost,
Class of 1935, who died of polio at age 23.
Under the direction of Palo Alto land
scape architect Leslie Kiler, Class of 1924,
Frost was designed to resemble the rolling
California foothills. The concave structure
sinks 22 feet below the original ground sur
face, and the terraced grass seating area
rises a similar distance above ground level.
Densely layered trees and plants surround
the amphitheater to give what Kiler called
"an effect of a heavily forested area."There
