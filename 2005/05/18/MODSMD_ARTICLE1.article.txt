# A
						trove of Stanford history
## Uncovering Frost 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
On the corner of Campus Drive and
Galvez St., the Arrillaga Alumni Center
stands prominently as a testament to Stan
ford's commitment to its past. But behind
the new building, enveloped within a grove
of tall trees, is Frost Amphitheater, a more
discreet, yet much more storied symbol of
Stanford history and tradition.
Many students may not be familiar with
the amphitheater, which can seat up to 7,000
people, but the cavernous space that now
mostly echoes with the chirping of birds and
skittering raccoons was once filled with the
booming of cannons, the blasting chords of
the Grateful Dead and the bellowing rheto
ric of world leaders.
A beautiful site, a difficult concert venue
Like the University, the Laurence Frost

Memorial Amphitheater is a dedication to a
lost son. Mr. and Mrs. Howard Frost donat
ed $90,000 to create a space that would con
tribute to the spiritual and cultural advance
ment of Stanford students for years to come
in honor of their son John Laurence Frost,
Class of 1935, who died of polio at age 23.
Under the direction of Palo Alto land
scape architect Leslie Kiler, Class of 1924,
Frost was designed to resemble the rolling
California foothills. The concave structure
sinks 22 feet below the original ground sur
face, and the terraced grass seating area
rises a similar distance above ground level.
Densely layered trees and plants surround
the amphitheater to give what Kiler called
"an effect of a heavily forested area."There
are approximately 150 varieties of trees
growing in and around the bowl, including
Apple, Birch, Elm, Mulberry and Cherry.
