# Student teaches financial skills
## Ramit Sethi offers classes to other students on how to manage their money 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
College is the time when many students take
charge of their own money. Now, thanks to the
efforts of an economics whiz kid, students can set
aside their financial fears.
Ramit Sethi, a fifth-year co-terminal student in
psychology, runs a program to teach college stu
dents and recent graduates about personal fi
nance. Today, Sethi travels around the country giv
ing lectures on personal finance and runs a non
profit Weh site, IWillTeachYouToßeßich.com.
"I've talked to some of the smartest students
around the country, and some of them have no
idea how to manage their money simply because
no one has taught them how," Sethi said."l want
to help people avoid situations in which their
choices are constrained by money."
Sethi teaches a one-hour class approximately
one to two times per week to dorms and student
groups on campus. Overall, he has spoken in
front of about 1 ,000 students on both coasts. Stu
dents interested in taking Sethi's class can con
tact him via e-mail. Additionally, he offers free
classes to groups of 10 or more.

"About 25 percent of the class covers saving,
banking and budgeting," Sethi said. "The rest of
the time I talk about investing and the difference
between stocks, bonds and mutual funds."
Senior Athalie Laguerre, a resident assistant
in Mirrielees, invited Sethi to speak to her
dorm's residents.
"This was the first time anyone ever actually
told me what I'm supposed to do to effectively
manage my money," she said. "He got a feel for
the room to see what people already knew, and
since we didn't know too much he went through
it step-by-step and explained what steps to take
tomorrow as well as 10 years from now."
Laguerre said she found his speech to be in
formative and lively. Sethi admits that personal
finance can be a boring topic and that he tries
hard to keep his lectures upbeat.
"Most other personal finance education is
written by old white men for old white men," he
said. "It's not directed towards college students
and it's boring. I try to make it fun."
• Chris Resto, head of the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology's Undergraduate Practice Op
portunities Program, had Sethi give a talk to about
120 of the university's students earlier this year.
"Ramit's speech goes over well with students
because it's short and sweet," Resto said."Ramit
was also able to make a greater impact on the
students because he is close to their age and be
cause he is not affiliated with any financial insti
tution."
Sethi began his Web site and classes during
his sophomore year at Stanford.

"I received my first scholarship check in high
school for $2,000," he said." I invested it all in the
stock market and lost half of my money right
away.That's when I decided to learn how to man
age my money."
Sethi stressed the importance of starting to
learn good money management habits as soon as
possible.
"I wish I had taken a class like Ramit's in my
freshman year because I realized that people
need to start taking care of their money early,"
Laguerre said.
Recent graduate Anton Du Buncio, '04, who
took Sethi's class at Du Buncio's consulting firm
in San Francisco, agreed.
"The effects of doing the right thing as early
as you can have a large impact, as everything that
you do now can greatly effect what you do in the
future," Du Buncio said. "If you do the right
thing now. you won't have financial problems
and uncertainty in the future."
Many students who have attended Sethi's
classes said the information definitely enhanced
their understanding of personal finance.
"I came in to the class with a very shallow
understanding of what I could do with the little
money I have and now feel that I am much
more capable of saving my money in a fiscally
responsible manner," said senior Sheena
Chandran. who took Sethi's class earlier this
year. "I know that I'm still not an expert, but I
am confident that my new saving strategies are
going to leave me with a lot more money in the
long term."
