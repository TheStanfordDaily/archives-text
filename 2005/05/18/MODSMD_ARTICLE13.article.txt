# But that's not the point...
## 15 Things I Hate About You 
### 
My friends and I are all guilty members of the Live-
Journal.com online community, which, I swear, we
mostly used when we were all abroad and scattered
around the globe, but now functions as one of the pri
mary bonds keeping the group together — and hon-

est with one another.
Which is why, I think, this trend
was such a hit. One of my friends
posted a list of 15 numbered state
ments, each addressed to an un
named individual — family, friends,
exes, whatever. The idea was that
everyone would write their state
ments and never tell which state
ment was for which person.
It's kind of a throwback. I admit,
to online chain letters or Slam

books, but since we're all in college now, we can turn
these things into eloquent statements of honesty and
enmity. For example, here are a few of the statements
from my list, edited to maintain some semblance of
privacy and dignity:
1. You're so strong that I often don't feel I can
measure up to you as a person. I stay friends with you
because I suspect that, deep down, you are not as
strong as I assume.
2.1 am sorry I haven't made your life better.
3. Our continuing friendship surprises me, but
when I think carefully about it, 1 know that we could
n't be any other way.
1 suspect that you see the problem with this right
away. If you don't know who any of the statements are
for, then you immediately start to wonder which one
was for you. And that's exactly what happened: a rash
of questions — "Am I the one you said ... ?" The
panic was understandable, especially since most of the
statements were a little harsh, the kind of honest per
sonality assessment that you wish your friends would
either tell you to your face or never think at all.
Immediately, most of us started to regret ever writ
ing a single sentence. However, the more I thought
about it, the more I thought this was a lesson we all
needed to learn — and maybe one that could be useful
fora lot of people. As I read statement after statement,
I started to question my assumptions — about my
feelings for my friends, my friends' feelings for me and
my feelings about myself. Any of those 15 statements
could have been about me — and 1 decided that if they
►feel true to me, then perhaps they are, just a little bit.
1 There are probably a lot of things that we would
;never tell our friends to their faces,, which I think is
ipretty sad. in one way or another. We might tell them
roundabout ways, carefully picking our words, or
•when we've had one cocktail too many. I'm not telling
'you to suddenly confront your BFF with a list of all
the things that piss you off about him or her — but I
do think you should ask yourself what it is you're
holding back, and why.
That's what I had to do the other night as I read
over my friend's 15 statements and my own. Even
though each statement was a little applicable to every
one. no statement encompassed the whole truth. Even
though I might occasionally think things that I don't
tell my friends, I think a lot more positive things about
them as well. If I had to list those, the list would prob
ably be longer, and no one would want to read it be
cause it would drown them in sap. However, reading
(and writing) all these statements really made me ex
amine my friendships closely, and I'm better off for it.
The 15 statements all expressed sentiments of worry,
jealousy.care, trust, reservation, resentment and guilt.
And most importantly — these sentiments were ur
gent, proving that even if I feel this way toward my
friends sometimes, they still matter deeply to me.
I 'm not religious, but my sketchy understanding of
faith tells me that you are supposed to doubt in order
to believe — so perhaps in friendship, you have to
question your assumptions in order to be a better
friend. I did that this past week, and I implore you to
do the same.
