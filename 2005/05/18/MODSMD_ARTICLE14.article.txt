# Sierra Camp: Taking Students From The Farm Into The woods
## 
### PAMELA SUD 
Tucked in between the picturesque shores of Fall
en Leaf Lake and the beautiful peaks of Desolation
Wilderness is Sierra Camp, a summer camp for alum
ni and their families. The program, which runs for 13
weeks, is staffed by 60 Stanford students who, over the
years, have started many traditions unique to their
jobs — from using their own slang (they call them
selves "staph" members) to dressing in costumes
throughout their shifts. And their eccentricity, coun
selors say, is what bonds them together.
"Some of my best friends have been made through
our close interactions as a summer 'staph,' " said sen
ior Brian Mohr. who has served as a counselor for the
past two summers. "[Sierra] Camp truly embodies the
Stanford experience."
Camp staff say that they work eagerly to earn their
wacky reputation. Every summer, the water ski dock
puts on a ski show where one person tries to throw a
back flip — wearing a chicken costume.They jump in
the lake after dinner shifts, chant at staff meetings and
wear "rally," Sierra camp slang for costume, to almost
any shift. Ninja-themed gear, nerdy outfits and war
rior-themed costumes have all been donned, Mohr
said.
Sophomore Katie Taylor, a counselor returning
this summer as the arts and crafts instructor, describes
her fellow staff members as high energy, outgoing, ex
uberant and always enthusiastic.
"It is their dynamism and spirit that made me want
to come back to camp,"Taylor said.
It is not just the counselors that have a blast at
camp. Counselors and coordinators alike take pride in
the success and popularity of Sierra Camp. According
to Sam Booth, summer staff director this year, there is
a waiting list of three to four years for families. Stan
ford alumni families spend a seven-day session at
Sierra Camp for about $5,000, depending onthe cabin
size.
For about half of the day, parents can have some
child-free hours to hike, play tennis or kayak on the
lake while their children spend time in the
"Munchkin" unit (which houses children ages three to
four) or "Yahoos" unit (ages nine and 10). Afternoon
and evening activities are for the families to spend to
gether, whether it is Disco Bingo, Game Day or Camp
Fire.
Senior Katie Fogelbong will be a first-time Sierra
Camp counselor this summer after having attended
the camp with her family for the past 20 years.
