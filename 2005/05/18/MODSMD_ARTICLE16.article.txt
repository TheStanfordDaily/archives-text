# Giant salamander existence debated

### ANDY SCHNEIDER 
One of the most long-standing mysteries on
campus is the existence of Laggie, the giant
salamander who supposedly resides in Lake
Lagunita. Recently the plot has thickened with
a profusion of fliers on campus reporting:
"Salamander Grows to Great Size."
The a cappella group Fleet Street has even
borrowed from the myth, dubbing their up
coming performance "Fleet Street vs. The
Monster of Lake Lag." Members of the singing
group allege that they managed to catch a
glimpse of the beast slithering its way through

the Main Quad.
The average tiger salamander, which does
in fact make its home at the lake, reaches 7 to
14 inches in length.
In response to the rumors. Stanford Conser
vation Biologist Alan Launer said it is not pos
sible for the salamander to grow beyond a foot.
"We hope not. at least," he added.
In fact. Launer said, the salamanders in Lake
Lagunita are actually smaller than average.
"They're all about five inches long at most,"
Launer said. "Some might get to be six or seven
[inches] before Lag dries up."
Their smaller size can be attributed to their

life cycle, he said, which also explains why the
University does not artificially fill the lake. Sala
manders only gravitate toward water to repro
duce, and once they mature they become terres
trial. It is at this stage, when the salamanders no
longer inhabit the lake, that they reach their
largest size â€” up to 10 inches, Launer said.
However Launer did say that some exotic
breeds have been sighted near the lake.
"You never can quite tell what you're going
to find in there," he said. "There've been some
strange animals. We've found Asian water
dragons in the creek that were three feet
long."
