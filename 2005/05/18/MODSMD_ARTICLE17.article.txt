(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. —Uni-
versity of California admissions of
ficials are complying with state law,
according to the findings of a uni
versity study, and do not consider
race when determining which qual
ified students should receive ad
missions.
The 2004-2005 Eligibility and Ad
missions Study Group evaluated sta
tistical data between campuses and
predicted admission rates and deter
mined that UC is following Proposi
tion 209 faithfully, according to a
summary analysis of its May 13
meeting.
A first round of analysis conclud
ed that race did not influence campus
admissions decisions, but panelists
recommended that despite their con
fidence in the results, a second analy
sis be conducted to better under
stand their findings.
The second analysis of rates uti
lized several different statistical
methods, and UC Provost and Se
nior Vice President of Academic Af
fairs M.R.C. Greenwood said in a
conference call that the analysis is an
accurate look at the factors that in
fluence what types of students are
admitted.
"The real admissions process is
more interactive where several fac
tors play a role," Greenwood said.

"This is a more interactive analysis
and is more likely to reflect the out
come in the way admissions decisions
are made."
Greenwood added that the uni
versity feels confident there is no
real issue involving its admissions
and compliance of Proposition 209,
which voters passed in 19%. The law
requires that the state not discrimi
nate against or grant preferred
treatment to any individual on the
basis of race in the operation of pub
lic education.
Also discussed at the meeting was
concern that eligibility rates are low
among particular ethnic groups, in
cluding African Americans and Chi
canos/Latinos.
Greenwood said even though
the representation of minorities is
increasing on UC campuses, the
proportion of minorities in the high
school population is even greater.
The second round of analysis
showed a widening gap between the
numbers of underrepresented mi
norities in the high school graduat
ing class and in the UC freshman
class.
According to the ethnic analyses
of 2004 admissions to UCs, the pro
portion of underrepresented minori
ties of California public high school
graduates in 2(X)4 was 44.6 percent
while the proportion of underrepre
sented minorities of new UC fresh
men was 18.3 percent.
