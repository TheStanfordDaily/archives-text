## Editorial Seniors should give to Stanford 
### 
Traditionally, the annual Senior Gift
campaign at Stanford, a senior class-led
fundraising effort that benefits the Stan
ford Fund, suffers from abysmal partici
pation rates. Although about 80 seniors
made gifts of $100 or more in last year's
campaign, only 41 percent of outgoing se
niors even donated anything to the Senior
Gift. In contrast, Stanford's peer institu
tions— Harvard, Princeton and Yale
have senior class giving rates of about 65
to 80 percent. I'his year's Senior Gift will
likely have a participation rate under 50
percent as well.
We understand that seniors may be an
noyed at having to give money to Stan
ford while still having to bear the enor
mous financial burden of paying fora
Stanford education. The Hoard of
Trustees continues to make sizeable in
creases to tuition every year, while the
cost of room and board goes up unrelent
ingly. Seen in this light, a donation to the
Senior Gift campaign seems like one ad
ditional cost added to the hefty price tag
of a Stanford diploma.
But thinking that way misses the point
of the campaign, which is to instill a cul
ture of giving back to Stanford that will
last long after students graduate. Accord
ing to the Senior Gift Web site, "Every
gift, whatever the size, counts towards
participation." So while many seniors this
year will make a donation of $20.05, anv

amount donated contributes to the over
all participation rate and to this culture of
giving. We feel that a donation of $5 —
the price of a Subway sandwich — would
be a reasonable sacrifice for seniors to
make.
To put things in perspective, last year's
senior class raised $23,784. The money
raised by seniors was matched by outside
donors, who gave more than $3 for every
$ 1 raised. After matching gifts, the class of
2004 raised a grand total of $141,285.
However, the Senior Gift campaign
could be better organized. Current cam
paign efforts bear an uncanny resem
blance to a pyramid scheme, with mem
bers of the 70-strong Participation Com
mittee trying to cajole friends into making
a donation. Seniors are also likely to be
put off by the unsolicited mail and phone
calls they receive. The campaign ought to
promote giving through its Web site more
often in order to make the process more
efficient.
Perhaps the organizers could look into
more creative ways to encourage seniors
to participate in the campaign. One idea
for next year's committee, for example,
would be to partner with the organizers of
Pub Night, where a fraction of the pro
ceeds from drinks would go to the Senior
Gift. Strategies like these are more likely
to encourage greater participation among
the graduating class of seniors.
