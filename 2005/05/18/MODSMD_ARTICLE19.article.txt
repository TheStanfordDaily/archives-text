This column has gen
erally been devoted to
extreme solutions he
cause those are just sexi
er. No one would put a
plaque at the Alamo say
ing, "Here KM) patriots
held out against Santa
Ana for 10 days, then ne
gotiated to the last man."
No one would write an

homage to Gandhi saying, "He fought
valiantly against the British before moderat
ing his demands for independence and final
ly settling for home rule."
If Patrick Henry had said, "Give me lib
erty, or give me death ... But I'd also settle
for some limited liberties that will displease
both you and me but won't involve loss of life
on either side." he probably would not be as
big of a national hero.
But the fact remains that extreme solu
tions are often not very effective in combat
ing the problem. Let's take one example: di
vestment from Sudan. Now. embargoes are
hot. We just love a good embargo or a nice
round of sanctions. What could be better
than punishing a naughty country by making
sure they get no money?
And really, there is nothing wrong with it.
I mean, it makes us feel better, it makes the
Sudanese poorer, and it doesn't make their
government stop doing anything. Oh wait —
—the point isn't to make us feel better? It's
to stop genocide? Then perhaps the main
problem is that divestment isn't going to
work.
We've already proven that the power of
sanctions to defeat evil men is extremely lim
ited. We proved it in Iraq, North Korea, Iran,
Cuba, Libya, India and Pakistan (after their
nuclear bomb blasts), every communist
country. Japan (our sanctions helped drive
them to war) and many others.
The shining star for sanctions "working"
is South Africa, where we imposed extensive

sanctions in the 1980s. But even if these sanc
tions did contribute to the fall of the
Apartheid, they were only a contribution.
And they only worked because South Africa
was in somewhat of a unique situation. It was
a democratic nation (albeit with an extreme
ly limited franchise). Us voting populace was
accustomed to a high standard of living,
which was gradually deteriorating.
This isn't true for Sudan. Sudan is a dicta
torship. It is already a pariah. And it is al
ready poor. If it were a person, it would be
"judgment-proof" — it does not have any
assets that could be stripped away in a civil
suit. They are immune to economic pressure.
Furthermore, if we divest and sanction them,
we remove our only lever for control.
How can we ignore that countries like In
donesia, China, South Korea and Taiwan
only began to reform their human rights
records after capitalism was well-estab
lished? Surely we can detect at least a corre
lation here. Nations that are part of the in
ternational economic community eventually
grow more democratic and free. Countries
that we turn into pariahs run amok.
I hate what's happening in Sudan —
thousands of people are dying every month.
But we have to face up to a hard fact. We do
not have the guts to intervene militarily, and
that is the only thing that will stop them. And
if people are going to die there no matter
what, is it right for us to wring our blood-free
hands and say, "We have nothing to do with
it?" Or should we take the hard decision and
accept that our money is being used to sup
port a morally corrupt regime? Do we trade
with them to ensure that the people there
have some semblance of an economy and
some hope of eventual freedom? Or do we
just wash our hands of them?

Extremism in the pursuit of liberty is no vice,
unless you can get half a liberty for free, and
then pursue the other half at your own leisure.
