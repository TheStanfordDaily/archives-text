# Wein presents recommendations
## Prof. finds security flaws 
### DAVID KUO STAFF WRITER 
Last fall. Graduate School of Business Prof.
Lawrence Wein discovered flaws in the government's
US-VISIT Program, causing worry among politicians in
the program's effectiveness in catching terrorists.
In early May, Wein published strong recommenda
tions for the Department of Homeland Security to rem
edy the problem. He conducted research on the $10 bil
lion US-VISIT Program, implemented after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which requires visitors to the United
States give two index fingerprints that are cross-refer
enced with a database of criminals.
Wein's findings call fora more precise method of fin
gerprinting because the probability of matching decreas
es when fingerprint quality is poor.
The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first
approached Wein with a proposal to analyze the US
VISIT program by investigating waiting lines at airports.
But when that project stalled, Wein decided to personal
ly delve into the study of fingerprints.
But his interest in potential flaws in the US-VISIT
program didn't come by chance, he said.
"There was a reason to believe there was vulnerabil
ity in the system from the National Institute for Stan
dards and Technology," Wein said. "Unlike other home
land projects, fingerprinting was well documented. We

understood the problem so we devel
oped a mathematical model captur
ing the main features of the data."
Manas Baveja, a graduate student
in computational and mathematical
engineering, helped Wein with his re
search.
"These models,in conjunction with
simple game theoretic models, helped
us in highlighting vulnerabilities in the
current US-VISIT program," Baveja
said. "We then spent our time thinking
about strategies to make the system
more robust."
Addressing the issue of poor finger
print quality, the researchers suggested
collecting 10 fingerprints instead of
two, which is currently the standard.
The 10-fingerprint strategy yielded a
much higher probability of a match
even if the fingerprint quality was poor,
according to their models.
Cost, however, will be the major
hurdle to implementing changes, Wein
said.
"Right now, it's the money be
cause you scrap the two finger ma
chines and buy 10 finger machines,"
Wein said. "But, on the scale of the
$10 billion program, it wouldn't be
that expensive."
Wein. who has since briefed gov

ernment officials and staff members
at the White House and the Depart
ment of Homeland Security, said he
hopes the US-VISIT program can be
refitted with more effective equip
ment within a year.
No stranger to advising the govern
ment on Homeland Security, Wein has
previously worked on projects involv
ing smallpox vaccinations, anthrax
policies and port security regulations
regarding the entry of nuclear
weapons into the country.
Some international students have
expressed concern that the changes to
the system might make entering the
country even more difficult.
Freshman Wontai Cho from
South Korea said that the potential
shift in policy might further damage
the United States' image in eyes
of visitors.
"Collecting foreign students' fin
gerprints and taking photographs
doesn't make the first impression of
the United States any better," he said.
"As an international student whose
photograph and fingerprints are
stored in the Pentagon, I really hate
the way that the U.S. government
treats all foreigners like they are ter
rorist suspects."
So far, the US-VISIT program has
denied 7,000 visas and 594 admissions
to the U.S, and has has led to 39 arrests
since January 2004, according to a
press release issued by the Depart
ment of Homeland Security TUesday.
