# Op-Ed
## Clearing up the returning RA and CA selection processes 
### JOSH SCHILLER 
Earlier this month. The Daily published
an editorial and op-ed about the resident as
sistant and college assistant select ion pro
cesses ("Returning ResEd staff process
needs to be re-examined." May 4. and "Re
turning ResEd staff are not the problem,"
May 6). Both pieces contained inaccurate in
formation and misperceptions that I would
like to clarify.
RAs and CAs who wish to return for an
other year fall into one of two categories: re
applicants (those who wish to serve in a dif
ferent residence from their current appoint
ment) and re-appointments (those who wish
to return to the same residence). Re-appli
cants participate in the same selection pro
cess as all other applicants. They have to sub
mit an application, two letters of recommen
dation (one written by their current resident
fellow, college director or supervisor) and
participate in interviews. They are evaluated
based on the merits of each proccss. They
may use their experience as a strength, but it

is not assumed that a re-applicant is a better
candidate than someone who has not been
an RA or CA before simply because they
have experience.
Re-appointments are made prior to the
beginning of the R A / CA selection process.
Permission to return as a reappointed R A or
CA is granted by the RF, CD or supervisor of
the Row or Suites. The major factors that in
fluence the decision are the person's job per
formance over the course of the year (as as
sessed by the supervisor's direct observation
and residents' feedback), the working rela
tionship between the RF, CD or supervisor
and the R A or CA, and a discussion between
the RF. CD or supervisor and the RA or CA
about the candidate's motivation for return
ing. The point to emphasize is that these re
appointments are not automatic. RAs and
CAs who are re-appointed have demonstrat
ed a strong ability to carry out their responsi
bilities and have established a strong and
productive working relationship with their
supervisors.
ALL potential returning RAs and CAs

must attend a special information session
where their motivations for returning are
discussed. Residential Education has addi
tional expectations for returning RAs and
CAs with regard to training and leadership,
and it is vital that each of them is committed
to improving upon their previous year and
to being role models within the residential
staff community.
In regard to how the Row RA selection
process is conducted: Residential Education
has worked hard to ensure fairness through
out the process. Each outgoing Row RA is
responsible for leading the selection process
for each individual Row House. They are re
quired to attend a training session specifical
ly designed to prepare them for the selection
process and to review and implement fair in
terview practices. Prior to holding individual
house interviews, each Row RA is required
to submit a list of interview questions for ap
proval by the Row Office.
Furthermore, each Row RA is required
to submit an interview evaluation for each
applicant they interviewed. These evalua

tions are used to support decisions about
their final house preference list. Even then,
the supervisor of the Row RAs. along with
the Row residence dean and the director of
Residential Education, has the authority to
review the list for final approval.
For each individual Row House, the in
terviewing team consists of the incoming
management team under the direction of the
outgoing RA. It is the outgoing RA who is
responsible for providing perspective to the
new managers and helping them evaluate
the strengths and weaknesses of each candi
date. In this system, the RA takes on much of
the role of the RF, and the Row RAs take
that responsibility very seriously. They are
very aware of the misperception of "rampant
nepotism" on the Row, and they and the
management teams have made it a priority to
uphold a high level of objectivity in the pro
cess. The requirements that are in place en
sure that Row RA selection is a fair process
for all applicants.
Overall, the RA/CA selection process is a
very competitive one. This year, approxi

mately 275 people applied for 174 positions.
In this selection process, as is customary for
any job selection process, consideration will
be given to a person who has demonstrated
an ability to perform the duties described in
the job description. Unfortunately, some ca
pable candidates may not have received a
position and this may cause people to sec
ond-guess the process or the RAs and CAs
who have been selected.
Each year Residential Education re-exam
ines the selection process for RAs and CAs
and changes are implemented to improve the
process. One constant underlying value is that
everyone who participates in the R A / CA se
lection process is committed to selecting the
strongest residence staff possible. The contin
ued quality of the RAs and CAs within Resi
dential Education is a testimony to the objec
tivity of staff during the selection process.
