## The 						Democrats and the filibuster 
### 
The battle in the U.S.
Senate over a proposed
rules change that would
eliminate the use of the
filibuster to block judicial
nominees has come to a
head. On Monday, Sen
ate Minority Leader
Harry Reid (D —Nev.)
broke off talks with Ma
jority Leader Bill Frist

(R —Tenn.) that could have resulted in some
sort of compromise. Perhaps the only hope
for keeping the filibuster lies with a handful
of moderate Republicans who sit outside the
party's leadership.
Yes, it would be bad for the Democrats
— and for U.S. democracy — to eliminate
this kind of minority protection that has ex
isted for so many years in the upper chamber
of Congress. But most of the debate in the
media over whether or not to do away with
the filibuster tends to miss several of the
larger issues.
First, a short history lesson: The Senate
doesn't really have many written rules;
therefore, there is no great precedent con
cerning how to change these rules. The
Founders envisioned the Senate as a consen
sus-based gentleman's club, where respected
elder-statesmen, elected by the legislatures
of the various states, would sit around, have
a good cigar or two and discuss the merits of
different bills.
At first, almost everything in the Senate

was done on a consensus basis. Most impor
tantly, to stop debate on a matter, every single
member would have had to agree that enough
debate had occurred. This changed at the be
ginning of the last century when, at the urging
of President Woodrow Wilson, the Senate
adopted a rule that set the threshold for stop
ping debate at two-thirds. Thirty years ago,
the threshold was reduced to three-fifths.
Slippery slope anybody? What's to say that
in a few years, the majority party won't point
to the rules change of 2005 and announce. "If
every judicial nominee deserves an up-or
down vote, so does every bill?" Nothing.
But the even bigger issue here is that the
Republicans think that they can get away
with this. They think that the American peo
ple will agree with their purely majoritarian
view of democracy. They have faith that
their slick media machine can portray their
demolition of the rules of the game as a nec
essary reform in a gridlocked system.
I'd like to think they're wrong. I'd like to
think that the American people are proud
that they've elected reasonable people who
can hammer out their differences in civilized
ways and don't need to railroad policy down
the throat of the minority.
I also know I'm wrong.
I'm wrong because the Democrats have
done a horrible job getting their message
out. It's like they've forgotten how the polit
ical game works. This has happened for two
reasons.
First, they completely lack charismatic

leadership. Tom Daschle? Harry Reid?
These are the people who they've entrusted
to try and convince people who are on the
fence? No wonder Al Franken and Jon Stew
art have won more liberal converts than the
elected leadership has in the past five years.
Second, they lack a plan. Phis has been
the case ever since Bush was elected, but has
become especially apparent in recent
months. All they seem to do is try and ex
plain why the Republicans' plans are bad for
the American people and cannot, for the life
of them, put forward viable alternatives that
people might find attractive. Can you name
the Democrats' plan for social security? No
— all you know is that they oppose private
accounts. How much does that solve?
1 level these criticisms not because 1 hate
the Democrats; in fact, quite the opposite. I
want more than anything — OK, more than
most things — for the Democrats to turn into
a nationally viable opposition party. But a lot
needs to change for this to become the case.
It seems that Frist is going to change the
rules whether the Democrats like it or not.
This presents an opportunity for the
Democrats in the next elections to hammer
the G.O.P. for desecrating an age-old tradi
tion. But without courageous leadership
and proper planning, they should open wide
and be prepared to swallow whatever the
Republicans want to feed them fora long
time to come.
