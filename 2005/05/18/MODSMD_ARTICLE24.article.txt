## Right in the Babymaker I'll say it: Bill Simmons sucks 
### 
I had to get this column out of me before I graduated.
There is one sportswriter whose popularity in America
today is unparalleled and who is more widely read than
any other: Bill Simmons, the Sports Guy, who writes for
ESPN.com. I have my own opinions on him, which have
been kept silent for quite some time, but that time is over.

You know that guy who thinks that all
his friends are hilarious and that the sto
ries that make him and Ray-Ray and P-
Dog pee their pants will translate into
humor for the masses? That guy who
comes back from Vegas on Monday and
tells you how wild his weekend was, only
to get into how he had six shots of Abso
lut Citron, lost $400 and had a "ridicu
lous" drunken conversation with the
dealer? That guy who treats the occa-

sional night away from his petty, boring wife as an oppor
tunity to cut loose at Hooters with the boys fora real rip
roaring good time?
That is Bill Simmons.
I don't want to get into the quality of his writing, be
cause any perceptive reader could tell you that his work
has declined significantly over the past year or two. How
ever, he still clearly has the capacity to be a good sports
writer. Note the prominence of the word sports in that sen
tence. Simmons puts together witty and meaningful pieces
about sports from time to time, but we have now reached
the point where he will write entire columns on "Survivor"
and his everyday experiences as if there were an audience
waiting eagerly to hear how his trip to the Mirage with J-
Bug turned out. From the anecdotes about his friends to
his experiences in college to his whiny beta-male approach
to women, it is brutally apparent that regardless of
whether Simmons is a good writer, his personal life is nei
ther interesting nor cool enough to warrant mentioning in.
much less to be the subject of, a column that is read by peo
ple nationwide.
But the decline of the columns' quality wasn't enough
— we now have a cartoon that accompanies Simmons'
work on a weekly basis. Words cannot describe the ineffa
ble crappiness of that production. Let's take the first in
stallment as an example: Red Sox third base coach Dale
Sveum waves a runner home, only to get him thrown out
... resulting in Simmons' friend building to a slow burn
before his head explodes. That's it. That's the humor.
When I first saw it, I was literally dumbstruck by how
lame and unfunny it was. I was even more shocked when
1 found out that Simmons himself wrote it. How could he
possibly attach his name to a creation with that level of
stupidity? ESPN hyped the cartoon as follows: "Every
Thursday,you can watch Sports Guy, Sports Gal, Dad and
the gang live a life you'd only want to dream about.Trust
us." Apparently, the Sports Guy's writing is now part of
ABC's primetime TV programming schedule.Tune in for
Bill Simmons' wacky antics, right after "According to
Jim!"The lack of humor inherent here is akin to the Pla
tonic form of unfunny.
The tortured hero Red Sox fan identity? Good at the
start, but overdone. The Las Vegas gambling stories?
Painfully average. Vegas is full of Sports Guys. The guy at
the blackjack table who comes up with funny names for
the dealer. The guy who thinks staying up for 28 hours
straight and smelling like cigarettes and booze is on par
with a Hunter S.Thompson bender.The masturbatory in
tern contest takes the cake, though, where we get to see a
legion of suck-up twentysomethings using their law school
degrees as a platform to come up with zingers about Kevin
Costner and "Lost."
Simmons has also reneged on his promise to keep all
his material free, indicated by the small orange "lnDe
mand" boxes that appear next to virtually all of his past
columns. I realize this is a financially savvy decision, but
come on — he had to have at least an inkling that he
would be faced with that dilemma eventually. What bog
gles my mind even more is that people will pay good
money to read his columns, as if they had a pressing need
to see how "The Shawshank Redemption" is a perfect
metaphor for every thing that happened in sports in the
past 20 years.
If sportswriting were television. Gary Smith would be
"Roots" and Bill Simmons would be "My Wife and Kids."
Even aside from the conspicuous absence of sports in his
recent work, Simmons has gone from a guy who could be
counted on for an occasional one-liner about A-Rod to a
monotonous Jay Leno monologue. Last week, on Janu


Dan McCarthy
from "Survivor:""Did she answer an
ad from the MGM that read 'Want
ed: Tall, ganglv showgirl who looks
like Medusa'?" Ba-ZING! Thanks,
I'll be here all week. Remember, this
is a guy who Jimmy Kimmel fired
because he wasn't funny enough.
My favorite counter-argument is
that Simmons is good because he's
popular. If there is anything that the
continued exposure of Paris Hilton
and "Blue Collar TV" has taught us,
it is that the American entertain
ment industry — and, by extension,
a large portion of the public — has
no concept of what is and is not inci
sive or intelligent humor.
The Sports Guy is not, and will
never be. the end-all-be-all of Amer
ican sportswriting. At least I hope
not. Content delivery is changing
fast, and the Simmons blog ap
proach. wherein a writer just dumps
all of his banal thoughts on mass cul
ture onto the page,is becoming more
and more popular. He has been
given a forum that a lot of writers
would kill for, and he uses it to ex
pound regularly about the Real
World and to make more Rocky IV
references than an "E! True Holly
wood Story" on Dolph Lundgren.in
between trying to reconcile his
sports addiction and his painfully sit

com-esque marriage. "Remember
that time I wanted to watch the
Celtics game instead of the OC?
Boy, the Sports Gal sure was pissed
about that! Ha ha ha!"
It's not impossible to combine
pop culture and sports. Simmons'
columns on the relationship be
tween "Goodfellas" and sports and
the Unintentional Comedy Scale
were genius. But there comes a time
when it's just too much. That time is
when you open up ESPN.com and
read Monday's Sports Guy headline,
which, more than any other, is repre
sentative of the shift: "Bill Simmons
takes a break from parenthood to
remind you which reality TV show is
still the best in the business."
So there you have it. Bill Sim
mons is the guy who explains his
friends' inside jokes to his cowork
ers, the guy who thinks his gambling
plays and last night's episode of
"Fear Factor" are appropriate topics
of discussion around the water cool
er. He has become a real-life sitcom
character. If he is the new voice of
ESPN's inevitable move from
"sports" to "sports entertainment,"
just look for me at the bottom of San
Francisco Bay.
And if you're looking for Bill
Simmons, just check out ESPN's
Page 2. Or, more likely, you'll see
him on the next episode of "I Love
the '905." Where he belongs.
