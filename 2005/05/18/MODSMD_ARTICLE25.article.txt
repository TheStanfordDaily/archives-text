# Cardinal blow out Gaels, 10-0
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
In the 49 games the Cardinal have played this
season, it has been rare for both the hitters and the
pitchers to be fully on their games. But last night, in
their final non-conference game of the season,
everything came together for the Cardinal (30-19)
as they took down the Saint Mary's Gaels (20-30) at
Sunken Diamond. 10-0.
The offense scored in the double digits for the
second straight game, blowing the game wide open
with six runs in the bottom of the eighth inning.
But while the offense was certainly impressive,
four Stanford pitchers stole the show, combining
fora four-hit shutout, while striking out 14 batters
and walking none.
Sophomore pitcher Greg Reynolds got the
start for the Cardinal and had his best outing of the
season, giving up just two hits in four innings of
work. He also struck out five Gaels.
"Coming into the game I knew there were going
to be a lot of free swingers in their lineup," Reynolds
said. "The one thing I wanted to do was just attack
them until I got a couple swing-throughs and a cou
ple quick outs. Luckily my stuff tonight was good
enough to get a bunch of easy outs and get a couple
of strikeouts."
Reynolds was followed by a duo of freshman
relievers, Erik Davis and Nolan Gallagher, who
helped keep the shutout alive in four combined in
nings of work. Gallagher was especially dominant,
striking out the final four batters — including
three straight looking — that he faced.
Junior reliever Matt Manship came on in the
ninth and struck out the side. In total, the Cardinal
pitchers struck out the last seven Saint Mary's hit
ters who came to the plate.
"It's always nice when you get four pitchers in a
row that come out and throw a lot of strikes,"
Reynolds said. "Coach Marquess always says,
'Don't give them any free passes.' No walks
through four pitchers is really remarkable."
Even the Cardinal hitters were in awe of the
dominant pitching performance.
"[Our pitchers] were attacking the hitters all
night," said junior shortstop Chris Minaker, who
went three-for-five in the game. "Everyone was
pounding the zone and they weren't afraid to let the
defense work. At the same time, as soon as they
started being aggressive with the hitters, you saw
the strikeouts mount"
Minaker and the Stanford hitters didn't let the
pitchers down as they picked up 10 runs on 13 hits
The big blow for the Gaels came in the bottom
of the eighth when the Cardinal tacked on six runs,
with the help of some Saint Mary's miscues.The in
ning featured a hit-by-pitch, two walks, an error on
a routine fly ball and three hits.
"Lots of times a ballgame can be decided by
one break," Minaker said. "Obviously, tonight was
a blowout, but you always have to be able to capi
talize because in that close game you must be ready
to take advantage."
The Cardinal got the scoring going with one run
in the bottom of the third. With one out, sopho
more designated hitter Ryan Seawell walked.
