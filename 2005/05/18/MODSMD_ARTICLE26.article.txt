# Stanford Frisbee teams head to Nationals
## 
### NEIL DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the past decade, the world of
Collegiate Ultimate Frisbee has had a
shadow cast over it by one school: Stan
ford. Thus, come Labor Day weekend,
the Stanford men's and women's Ulti

mate Frisbee teams will return to Cor
vallis. Ore., with one goal in mind —
winning the National Championship.
The men's team, known as Blood
thirsty, will come to Corvallis riding the
momentum of a victory in the North
west Regional Final. After underper
forming through stretches of the season

due to injuries to key members includ
ing junior co-captain Doug Allen,
Danny "Bronx" Newman, Mark Sher
wood and Tom James, the Cardinal en
tered the Northwest Regional as the
No. 4 seed. Amazingly, James, who
broke his right (dominant) throwing
hand before the Northwest Region

Tournament, played left-handed.
A rejuvenated Stanford team found
itself matched against the University of
British Columbia, a team that had pre
viously defeated the Cardinal twice
during the season, in the final. Al-
though Bloodthirsty's bid for Na
tionals had already been secured
regardless of the outcome of the
Regional Final, Allen noted that
the team "needed to prove to the
nation that we are still one of the
top teams." The Regional Final
"dispelled a lot of the doubts we
had coming off a season where we
had started off hot but experienced
a lot of difficulties throughout the
year," Allen said.
Bloodthirsty captain Robbie
Cahill said that Stanford "dictated
the entire game" in securing the re
gional title. Bloodthirsty prevailed,
beating ÜBC 15-13.
Both Cahill and Allen empha
sized the balanced nature of Blood
thirsty's attack as key to perform
ing well at Nationals. Allen said the
team will rely on the "faceless
army" motto, insisting that any of
the team's 24 members has the abil
ity to come up big in clutch situa
tions, regardless of what seven guys
are placed on the line.
"Bloodthirsty, ranked second
nationally behind Colorado, must
return to its roots and rely on "hard
man defense, calm offense, and
good looks" to win Nationals,
Cahill said. Led by the dominating
play of graduate student James
Herbert, a Callahan Award candi
date (the Heisman Trophy of Ulti
mate Frisbee), Bloodthirsty moves
on to Nationals as the team pre
pared to taste the spoils of victory.

Similarly, the top-ranked
women's team, known as Superfly,
enters Nationals riding a wave of
momentum: the team has emerged
triumphant in each of its previous
four tournaments. After an early
season loss to a rival Santa Cruz
team, Superfly rebounded by
"pushing ourselves at sprint prac
tice, in the weight room, and at
sprint tournaments throughout the
season," according to senior co-cap
tain Lauren Casey.
Recently, at the Northwest Re
gional Final, Superfly — facing a
field of six of the top teams in the
nation vying for three spots to Na
tionals — punched its ticket to Na
tionals by defeating UC-Berkeley,
13-6, in the final.
For senior co-captain Enessa
James, the storied tradition of Su
perfly can be attributed to Stan
ford's pool of athletically driven
women that the team gets to
choose from each year. James de
scribes how Superfly "consistent
ly has well-rounded rosters" of
driven individuals molded by the
mastermind coaching of former
Superfly members Gwen Ambler
and Robin Knowler. In addition
to Callahan Award Candidate
James, whom Lauren Casey de
scribes as an incredible leader
and one of best all-around play
ers in women's Ultimate, other
team standouts include defensive
stalwart Hannah Griego — who
has no qualms sacrificing her
body on defense — and prime
time receivers senior Alicia
Danztker and sophomore
Christina Contreras.
"There isn't much that other

teams can throw at us to catch us off
guard." James said. "I expect Stan
ford to do very well at Nationals
this year.We are a consistent team,
we do well under pressure and we
have a great record thus far."
Superfly enters Nationals as the
prohibitive favorite.
Behind the leadership of sen
ior co-captains James, Lauren
Casey and MaryLyn Stein, Stan
ford enters the 16-team National
tournament as a No. 1 seed. "It

definitely gives us a sense of con
fidence. but it also means that all
of the other teams are gunning for
us," Casey said. "We're the team
to beat. We're treating every team
we'll play as the best team in the
country."
In two weeks. Bloodthirsty and
Superfly will once against attempt
to ingrain Stanford in the collective
psyche of the Ultimate Frisbee
community and continue their re
spective dynasties.
