# Crew successful at Pac-10s
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
After a long season of pushing them
selves mentally, physically and emotion
ally, the members of the Stanford crew
teams put their preparation to the test
this past weekend against the best crews
on the West Coast. Competing at the Pa
cific* 10 Conference and Pacific Coast
Rowing Championships at Lake
Natoma in Sacramento, Calif., each Stan
ford squad entered the weekend's com
petition with its own set of goals.
The No. 5 men's team was looking to
challenge perennial powerhouses No. 2
California and No. 4 Washington.
The second varsity boat kept pace
with the Bears for the first half of the
race, but as the Bears and the Huskies
pulled away in the second thousand, the
Cardinal found themselves facing a late
charge from Oregon State.
"As we passed the thousand we took a
[power] 20 to hold OSU back, but they
took a move to gain a seat," sophomore
Nate Rooks said. "At that point I had a
feeling that [their] coach had trained them
fora strong second thousand [and that]
they were going to start coming on strong."
The Cardinal barely held off the surg
ing Beavers and took bronze.
The men's first varsity boat hung equal
ly tough in its Grand Final and earned the

Cardinal squad another bronze behind
Washington and California.
"We executed our moves throughout
the middle of the race nearly as well as we
could have as we sat side by side with
UW," sophomore Justin Brown said. "We
know now whai parts of our race plan and
strategy we need to work on in the next
three weeks leading up to Nationals to
improve and catch up to them."
The No. 9 women's squad headed to
Sacramento looking to conclude its sea
son-long case for an NCAA bid with a
flourish. And after a strong performance
against No. 2 California in their final reg
ular season regatta, the Cardinal looked
poised to pull everything together for all
the Pac-10 to see. And had it not been for
a single uncoordinated stroke, they like
ly would have succeeded in doing so.
In their afternoon final, the members
of the second varsity boat sat ready on the
line waiting eagerly to fire off their open
ing strokes. But the Cardinal failed to exe
cute their opening jump in perfect unison.
"It was just one bad stroke at the start
of [the race]," sophomore Lani Marsden
said. "We had an off stroke that sent the
boat down to starboard, and so we bob
bled the start."
Despite being eliminated from con
tention early on, the Cardinal recovered

The Stanford women's first varsity boat took silver in the Grand Final at the Pac-10 Championships in Sacramento last weekend.
to stroke their way past Washington
State within the first five hundred
meters of the race.
"I was really proud of the way we
kept fighting," junior Laura Creager
said. "Our boat has a lot of heart and
it came through this weekend."
Later that afternoon, the
women's first varsity boat took silver
in its Grand Final event to end the
squad's afternoon on a positive note.
The Stanford women crossed the
halfway marker battling No. 13
Southern California and No. 12
Washington. With five hundred me
ters to go the Cardinal had picked up
a few seats on the USC boat â€” and
it turned out that they would need
every one of them.
ITie Women of Troy executed a
powerful sprint in the closing meters of
the race and nearly pulled back even
with the Cardinal. Ihe official results
showed the Stanford boat crossed the
line a mere .20 seconds ahead of USC.
"USC was next to us the entire
way down the course, but we did a
good job of not letting them break
our focus," senior Susan Be Ville said.
Additionally, the Stanford silver
medalists learned yesterday that
they had earned an at-large bid to the
NCAA championships and will get
another shot at catching the Bears.
"I think we surprised some teams
who didn't expect to see speed from
us," freshman Stephanie Morrison
said. "But at the same time, Cal kept
the bar high and that's going to moti

vate us and ultimately make us faster."
The Stanford lightweight women
entered two boats in the Pacific
Coast Rowing Championships, the
Cardinal took gold in both the
novice and varsity divisions.
The novice boat fell behind rival
California shortly after the start of the
race. But as the Cardinal built up their
rhythm and power, there was nothing
any other boat could do to keep pace.
"It was beautiful watching their
boat fall farther and farther behind,"
freshman Rachel Bosley said. "By
the end of the race we were at least a
boat length ahead, if not more."
Ihe lightweight varsity boat dupli
cated the novice effort and walked
away with the gold medal by a 14-sec
ond margin. So dominant was the
Cardinal's effort that they passed run
ner-up San Diego State's boat within
the first two minutes of the race.
" Ihe thing I was happiest about in
our race was that we didn't get com
placent," sophomore Meredith Cole
man said. "We continued to open up
water between ourselves and the
other boats throughout the race."
The Cardinal know that it will
take a much greater effort to take
gold against East Coast programs at
the IRA National Championships to
be held June 3 and 4 than it did this
weekend in Sacramento. Neverthe
less, it's a goal the lightweight
women believe is achievable.
"We're kx)k forward to doing every
thing we can in practice the next two
weeks to increase our boat speed,"soph
omore Jennie Morawetz said."Our goal
for IRAs is to dominate Georgetown
again and to beat Radcliffe. And given
the way we have been rowing lately, that
goal is within our reach."
