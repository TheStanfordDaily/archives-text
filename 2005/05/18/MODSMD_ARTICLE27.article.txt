# Crew successful at Pac-10s
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
After a long season of pushing them
selves mentally, physically and emotion
ally, the members of the Stanford crew
teams put their preparation to the test
this past weekend against the best crews
on the West Coast. Competing at the Pa
cific* 10 Conference and Pacific Coast
Rowing Championships at Lake
Natoma in Sacramento, Calif., each Stan
ford squad entered the weekend's com
petition with its own set of goals.
The No. 5 men's team was looking to
challenge perennial powerhouses No. 2
California and No. 4 Washington.
The second varsity boat kept pace
with the Bears for the first half of the
race, but as the Bears and the Huskies
pulled away in the second thousand, the
Cardinal found themselves facing a late
charge from Oregon State.
"As we passed the thousand we took a
[power] 20 to hold OSU back, but they
took a move to gain a seat," sophomore
Nate Rooks said. "At that point I had a
feeling that [their] coach had trained them
fora strong second thousand [and that]
they were going to start coming on strong."
The Cardinal barely held off the surg
ing Beavers and took bronze.
The men's first varsity boat hung equal
ly tough in its Grand Final and earned the

Cardinal squad another bronze behind
Washington and California.
"We executed our moves throughout
the middle of the race nearly as well as we
could have as we sat side by side with
UW," sophomore Justin Brown said. "We
know now whai parts of our race plan and
strategy we need to work on in the next
three weeks leading up to Nationals to
improve and catch up to them."
The No. 9 women's squad headed to
Sacramento looking to conclude its sea
son-long case for an NCAA bid with a
flourish. And after a strong performance
against No. 2 California in their final reg
ular season regatta, the Cardinal looked
poised to pull everything together for all
the Pac-10 to see. And had it not been for
a single uncoordinated stroke, they like
ly would have succeeded in doing so.
In their afternoon final, the members
of the second varsity boat sat ready on the
line waiting eagerly to fire off their open
ing strokes. But the Cardinal failed to exe
cute their opening jump in perfect unison.
"It was just one bad stroke at the start
of [the race]," sophomore Lani Marsden
said. "We had an off stroke that sent the
boat down to starboard, and so we bob
bled the start."
Despite being eliminated from con
tention early on, the Cardinal recovered
