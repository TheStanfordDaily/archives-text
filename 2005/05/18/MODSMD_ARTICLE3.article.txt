### ALIYYA HAQUE DESK EDITOR 
Coming off the heels of a $50 million
gift, the Stanford Institute for Interna
tional Studies, or SIIS, will be re-named
the Freeman Spogli Institute for Inter
national Studies at Stanford in honor of
the two alumni donors, Bradford M.
Freeman, Class of 1964, and Ronald P.
Spogli, Class of 1970. The name change
will go into effect Sept. 1.
"We've decided to change the name
in recognition of two generous donors
who gave a very large gift recently to
the Institute and Stanford's Interna
tional Initiative," said Klas Bergman,
associate director for communications
at the SIIS.
Freeman is a member of Stanford's
Board of Trustees, and Spogli sits on the
Board of Visitors at the SIIS. Both are
founding partners of the investment

firm Freeman Spogli & Co.
In a May 13 press release, Coit Black
er, director of the SIIS, said that the do
nation will "lay the groundwork for the
transformation of international studies
at Stanford, and the Institute and the
University stand ready to embark on a
fundamentally new and very dynamic
course in international research and ed
ucation."
Blacker was unable to be reached for
comment.
Along with the name change, the
SIIS staff hopes to implement many far
reaching changes in the future thanks to
the large donation.
"The changes will not be irtimediate,
but we are now looking at the needs of
the institute and determining what the
money should be used for," Bergman
said. "However, [the donation] will
make it possible to fund at least 10 new
professorships, which is one of the main

aspects of the gift. When you appoint
new professors, this leads to new ideas
and new programs."
The SIIS currently consists of five
main research centers. The oldest one,
the Center for International Security
and Cooperation, concentrates on is
sues relating to nuclear proliferation
and homeland security. The newest one
is the Center on Democracy, Develop
ment and the Rule of Law, which focus
es on economic progress and democra
cy-building efforts in developing coun
tries.
Various other donors have con
tributed $44 million to SIIS.
"This is a very exciting time not only
for the SIIS but for Stanford as a
whole," Bergman said. "We'll be able to
see new resources and programs and a
widening of what we can offer Stanford
students in terms of international edu
cation and affairs."
