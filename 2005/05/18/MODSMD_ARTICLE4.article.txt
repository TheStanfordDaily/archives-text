# Global warming brings spring early
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Man-made global warming has caused spring
weather to appear an average of 10 days earlier than
the start of spring 30 years ago, according to a report
released Monday by Stanford scientists. Co-au
thored by married couple Stephen Schneider and
Terry Root, both professors at the Center for Envi
ronmental Science Policy, the report links changes in
plant and animal populations with artificially-caused
temperature fluctuations for the first time.
Root said the study is particularly significant be
cause it demonstrates how humans are affecting
plants and animals on a regional and local scale.
Global-climate computer models have allowed
more reliable data to be collected at a local level, she
added.
The researchers looked at approximately 130
species within 41 150-square mile grids.
"At a local level — on the Stanford campus, for
example — a significant portion of the warming we
have experienced over the last 30 years has been due
to the fact that humans are using the atmosphere as
free sewers," Root said in an interview with The
Daily.
The evidence obtained from wild plants and ani
mals will be difficult for those who oppose the idea
of global warming to refute, according to Root. The

researchers hope that their findings will help animal
and plant preservation workers to take the affects of
global warming into account.

"Global warming is the largest-scale threat faced
by the planet today, crossing the boundaries of

countries, economics, cultures and ecosystems,'
said Dena MacMynowski, a post-doctoral student
working with Root to research large-scale ecolog
ical changes caused by global warming. "Changes
in timing of plant and animal behavior, such as

flowers blooming or arrival of migrant birds,
which are associated with climatic change have
been documented."

MacMynowski added that the study is novel
because it shows that the majority of these
changes can be best explained by the human

injection of greenhouse gases into the atmos-

phere.
"Natural variation in the earth's tempera
ture, such as that caused by solar output or
volcanoes, is not an adequate explanation,"

MacMynowski said. "Global warming is
real and almost certainly caused by human

actions."
Root said she believes the study will
spur ecologists at Stanford and other uni-

versities to study the impacts of global

warming in their local areas.
MacMynowski has applied the
framework of the global study to an
alyze changes in the spring arrival of
birds in the Bay Area.
"The study helps me understand
how species interact with climate
and how they might be impacted by
global warming," she said.
Root said the results came as a
surprise to her and her husband.
"In ecology it is difficult to figure
out what is causing change," she said.
"Yet when we did our study, we
found in some species that the vari
ance was 25 percent for how species
were being affected by both human
warming and natural warming or
just human warming."

Root and MacMynowski said
they view global warming as a
local, as well as national and global
issue.
"People's decisions on energy
usage in their homes and in the vehi
cles they drive impact the atmos
phere that we all share,"
MacMynowski noted. "We make
personal choices and support the
choices of elected officials that will
improve or worsen the future of
earth's climate for all people and all
other organisms."
Root said she believes that in the
next 50 to 100 years, global warming
will become the biggest problem hu
mankind faces, and she hopes to be
leading efforts to halt the trend. In
the near future, Root said she plans
to focus on migrant species that are
on the verge of extinction, starting
with how changes in the wind pat
terns may affect birds near the Gulf
of Mexico.
