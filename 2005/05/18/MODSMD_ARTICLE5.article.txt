# Minorities receive funds
## To promote diversity, women and minorities given funds by foundation 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to increase diversity in scientif
ic and technological fields, the National Sci
ence Foundation, or NSF, announced last
month that it will provide $400,000 in mone
tary awards to women and minority students
across the country participating in biomedical,
environmental, biomechanical or electrical en
gineering graduate research already funded by
the NSF.
To qualify for these awards, students must
be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, intend
to earn a doctoral degree, identify themselves
as women or minorities and participate in re
search that is being funded by grants through

the Bioengineering and Environmental Sys
tems Division or the Electrical and Communi
cations Systems of the NSF. Most importantly,
these specifications must be certified by a prin
cipal investigator, a professor or researcher
who will make the funding request on behalf of
the student.
The announcement of these Graduate Re
search Supplements comes in response to a re
cent NSF survey that showed that few women
and minorities receive tenure at engineering
schools across the country. Only 13.7 percent of
those obtaining or pursuing tenure in certain
engineering fields are women, while less than
7.5 percent are African-American or Hispanic.
NSF officials said that these numbers indi
cate a broader problem â€” a dearth of minori
ties and women participating in engineering
fields, starting at graduate-level institutions
like Stanford. The NSF Web site states that
these disparities signify "a significant untapped
technical resource for the nation."

The National Science Foundation is awarding monetary awards to women
and minorities in order to increase diversity in fields like engineering.
of Engineering, said he agrees with
the NSF that the number of women
and minorities at graduate engineer
ing schools is lacking and should be
remedied.
"We can always do more to in
crease representation of minorities
and women at institutions like Stan
ford," Plummer said in an interview
with The Daily. "Only about 13 per
cent [at Stanford] are women and a
small percentage is minorities."
However. Plummer also touted
the Engineering School's aggressive
efforts to boost representation of
these groups, including active re
cruitment of minorities.
"We do a lot more than just ad
vertise that we encourage diversity,"
Plummer said. "We make aggressive
efforts to recruit and let others know
about the programs we offer here.
These efforts have led to a recent in
crease in the percentage of women
enrolled in the Engineering Depart
ment."
While the school may be making
efforts to increase diversity at Stan
ford, Paloma Beamer, a graduate
student in civil and environmental
engineering, concurred with Plum
mer that not nearly enough is being
done to increase diversity in gradu

ate science and mathematics pro
grams.
"There needs to be a top down
commitment to diversity," Beamer
said. "While this exists in theory, it
needs to be backed up with more
funding for underrepresented stu
dents and policies. There also needs
to be some training on the impor
tance of diversity for the people that
sit on admissions committees for
graduate school."
The Graduate Student Council
Diversity Committee is researching
and preparing recommendations for
University administrators on how to
increase graduate student diversity,
Beamer said.
Plummer said that he welcomes
efforts made by the NSF and other
programs to strengthen student rep
resentation of minorities and
women in engineering fields.
"In the real world, students are
going to have to work in environ
ments with many different types of
people," Plummer said. "Getting an
education in an isolated community
that is unlike the outside world is not
going to prepare students well for
what is to come."
Beamer underscored the benefits
of diversity, especially in the field of
engineering.
"Engineering is about being cre
ative and designing technological
inventions," Beamer said. "And cre
ativity is naturally enhanced by di
versity."
