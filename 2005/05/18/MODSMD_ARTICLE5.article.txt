# Minorities receive funds
## To promote diversity, women and minorities given funds by foundation 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to increase diversity in scientif
ic and technological fields, the National Sci
ence Foundation, or NSF, announced last
month that it will provide $400,000 in mone
tary awards to women and minority students
across the country participating in biomedical,
environmental, biomechanical or electrical en
gineering graduate research already funded by
the NSF.
To qualify for these awards, students must
be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, intend
to earn a doctoral degree, identify themselves
as women or minorities and participate in re
search that is being funded by grants through

the Bioengineering and Environmental Sys
tems Division or the Electrical and Communi
cations Systems of the NSF. Most importantly,
these specifications must be certified by a prin
cipal investigator, a professor or researcher
who will make the funding request on behalf of
the student.
The announcement of these Graduate Re
search Supplements comes in response to a re
cent NSF survey that showed that few women
and minorities receive tenure at engineering
schools across the country. Only 13.7 percent of
those obtaining or pursuing tenure in certain
engineering fields are women, while less than
7.5 percent are African-American or Hispanic.
NSF officials said that these numbers indi
cate a broader problem â€” a dearth of minori
ties and women participating in engineering
fields, starting at graduate-level institutions
like Stanford. The NSF Web site states that
these disparities signify "a significant untapped
technical resource for the nation."
