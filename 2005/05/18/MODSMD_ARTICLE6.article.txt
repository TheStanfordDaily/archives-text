# Retrovirals temporarily stave off AIDS
## HIV infants studied 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Infants infected with HIV who are
treated with one or two antiretroviral
drugs within two months of birth are
less likely to develop AIDS by their
third birthdays than infants who are
treated later, according to a new study
conducted by researchers at Stanford's
School of Medicine and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. Babies
who received a cocktail of three anti
retroviral drugs fared even better. The
results are significant because there is
still some uncertainty about potential
side effects when drugs are adminis
tered at a very young age.
"There is a significant difference in
the likelihood of disease progression,
even though there is only about a
month separating the initiation of ther
apy in the two groups," said Associate

Prof, of Pediatrics Yvonne
Maldonado, the report's sen-

ior author.
Currently, decid-

ing when to begin
treating an HlV
infected infant is
the responsibility
of the child's physi-

cian, largely because

the long-term effects of ongoing retro
viral treatment are unknown.
"The whole idea of the study is to
follow children with HIV over time and
make sure we could track the illness in
children, then to use that tracking to
make sure we could treat children bet
ter and more effectively," Maldonado
said.
Without treatment, about 20 to 30
percent of infected infants will develop
AIDS by the time they reach four
months old. The rest will develop ad-

vanced symptoms by the time they are
six years old.
Since some of these infected infants
will appear healthy, researchers suggest
that early treatment might be appropri
ate for even those who do not show
symptoms of the disease. However,
they caution that clinical trials are need
ed to determine if every infected new
born should be treated or if some in
fants will benefit more than others,

Maldonado and her colleagues col
lected data from hospitals throughout
northern California over a 17-year pe
riod beginning in 1988. They followed
the children for the first three years of
life, tracked their age when AIDS de
veloped and the rate of survival
through their third birthdays
"We were able to analyze children
with the full-spectrum of disease across
many years, rather than using mathe
matical models to predict the develop
ment of illness in the children," Mal
donado said. "We were able to see the
real distribution of illness, what kinds of
treatment the children were given and
the ages when they started treatment."
The researchers divided the new
borns into three groups: those born be
tween 1988 and 1991, between 1992
and 1995 and between 19% and 2001

based on the types of therapy available
in those years. Members of the early
group were tested for infection by their
first birthday; members of the middle
and late groups were assessed within
the first month, and those in the late
group benefited from the introduction
of a special type of antiretroviral drug
called a protease inhibitor, which inter
feres with the virus' ability to replicate.
Not surprisingly, infants born later
were more likely to receive triple-drug
therapy and less likely to experience
symptoms of AIDS. In fact, none of the
23 children who received triple-drug
therapy developed AIDS before their
third birthdays and none died.
"This is an important finding be
cause there's been a lot of controversy
in the literature as to whether infected
but asymptomatic infants should be
started on therapy right away," Mal
donado said." We've clearly shown that
early treatment of asymptomatic in
fants — no matter what it is — makes a
big difference in preventing or delaying
the progression of the disease."
