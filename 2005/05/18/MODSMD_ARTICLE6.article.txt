# Retrovirals temporarily stave off AIDS
## HIV infants studied 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Infants infected with HIV who are
treated with one or two antiretroviral
drugs within two months of birth are
less likely to develop AIDS by their
third birthdays than infants who are
treated later, according to a new study
conducted by researchers at Stanford's
School of Medicine and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. Babies
who received a cocktail of three anti
retroviral drugs fared even better. The
results are significant because there is
still some uncertainty about potential
side effects when drugs are adminis
tered at a very young age.
"There is a significant difference in
the likelihood of disease progression,
even though there is only about a
month separating the initiation of ther
apy in the two groups," said Associate

Prof, of Pediatrics Yvonne
Maldonado, the report's sen-

ior author.
Currently, decid-

ing when to begin
treating an HlV
infected infant is
the responsibility
of the child's physi-

cian, largely because

the long-term effects of ongoing retro
viral treatment are unknown.
"The whole idea of the study is to
follow children with HIV over time and
make sure we could track the illness in
children, then to use that tracking to
make sure we could treat children bet
ter and more effectively," Maldonado
said.
Without treatment, about 20 to 30
percent of infected infants will develop
AIDS by the time they reach four
months old. The rest will develop ad-

vanced symptoms by the time they are
six years old.
Since some of these infected infants
will appear healthy, researchers suggest
that early treatment might be appropri
ate for even those who do not show
symptoms of the disease. However,
they caution that clinical trials are need
ed to determine if every infected new
born should be treated or if some in
fants will benefit more than others,
