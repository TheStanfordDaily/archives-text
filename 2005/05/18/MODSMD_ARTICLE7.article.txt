# Offices can receive rebate if they recycle
## 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University uses about 175 million kilo
watt-hours of electricity, 470 million pounds of steam
and 29 million ton-hours of chilled water each year,
according to Campus Energy Manager Susan Ku
lakowski.
In an attempt to curb the large amount of energy
used at Stanford, the Utilities Division has developed
a program through which offices can receive $200 or
$500 dollar rebates when they recycle their old refrig
erators or copier machines and replace them with En
ergy Star certified products.
The division decided to focus on refrigerators
and copier machines because they both require a lot
of electricity and Energy Star
products use 20 to 50 percent less
electricity than non-Energy Star
appliances.
Rebates are also offered to
dorms and other residences, with
the exception of a few houses on the
upper Row that get their electricity
from PG&E and not the Utilities
Division.
While the future of the rebate
program remains uncertain, Ku
lakowski urges offices to submit an
application for the rebates by the
July 15 deadline.
The program has already en
couraged the purchase of 28 energy
efficient refrigerators, which will
save 6,000 kilowatt-hours per year.

The Office of Land and Buildings
and the School of Humanities and
Sciences bought 21 of the 28 refrig
erators.
Yet, the program has still only
scratched the surface. Facilities Op
erations, the Chemistry Depart
ment and Environmental Health
and Safety have participated the
most in the program, but many de
partments have not participated at
all.
In an attempt to raise awareness
about the rebate opportunities, the
Utilities Division sent information
to building managers and depart
ment property administrators by e
mail and have made a number of
presentations.

Kulakowski said the program
originated in response to a survey of
refrigerators and freezers at Gilbert
Biology and Herrin Labs that re
vealed many old, inefficient units
being used. Hie refrigerator rebate
program was offered for the first
time during the 2004 fiscal year,
with the copier machine program
beginning last January.
Introduced in 1992 by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency,
Energy Star is a government
backed program that helps busi
nesses and individuals protect the
environment and save money on
their utility bills.
Today, Energy Star has partner
ships with more than 8,000 private

and public sector organizations,
providing their partners with the
technical information and tools that
they need to become more energy
and cost efficient.
In 2004, Energy Star enabled
Americans to save enough energy
to power 24 million homes and
avoid greenhouse gas emissions
equivalent to those from 20 million
cars, stated the Energy Star Web
site. At the same time, the group
managed to save $10 billion.
In order to be eligible fora re
bate. the new equipment needs to
be installed in a building that is
served by the Utilities Division. Ap
pliances that are to be replaced can
not be Energy Star certified.
