HOPES:
Summer 2005 Positions Available!
The Huntington's Outreach Project for Education, at Stanford (HOPES) is a student-run
educational web resource offering a "layperson's guide" to the scientific understanding of
Huntington's disease (HD).
We currently have openings for researchers, web developers, and graphic artists.
The task of the researchers is to "translate" research literature on HD into accurate, user
friendly text for the general public. The task of the web developers is to manage the
website, and keep it interesting and up-to-date. Graphic artists are needed for the
abundant illustrations and animations on the site.
Compensation: Units or pay (starting salary of Sl2 per hour)
Commitment: During Summer - Minimum of 10 hours/wk, up to 40 hours/wk (hours
are flexible based on individual schedule). During school year - 6 to 10 hours/wk.
Faculty Coordinators: Profs. Bill Durham & Ron Barrett
Applications for Summer 2005 are due by Friday, Mav 20 at 12 noon at the HOPES
office (360-362K) and consist of a letter of application, current resume, and unofficial
transcript. The letter should include a candid discussion of your qualifications for the
position, your other time commitments during the summer, and your reasons for interest
in the project. It is a "plus" if you are willing to continue part time during next academic
year. To learn more about HOPES or for application instructions, visit our website at
