# Rising costs drive grads off-campus
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
With housing and health care costs on the rise, more
graduate students are turning to off-campus housing. Ihese
issues, along with the resulting increases in on-campus rent,
were highlighted in the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee's report, presented last night to the Graduate
Student Council.
Natalie Chun and Peter Lee, GSC representatives from
the Schools of Humanities and Sciences and Business
respectively, told their fellow council members that issues in
housing remain unresolved, particularly with rising costs and
other changes brought about with the construction of the
Munger housing project.
GSC Deputy Chair Tom Lee, an electrical engineering
graduate student, said that rising housing costs weigh heavi
ly on the minds of graduate students
"It's almost all cost,"he said. "With health care going up
and housing costs going up, the Stanford student budget is
being squeezed."
"Right now it's not a deal to live on campus," he said.
"The bottom line is that it's much more expensive."
"During the dot-com boom, housing on campus was a lot
cheaper than off campus," Lee said. "Now that's all changed
and there are many affordable options for students oft cam
pus, so the University has more competition in terms of the
housing market."
Lee added that the addition of the Munger housing com
plex would be a mixed blessing for graduate students
"Munger will give us a lot of new beds," he said. "The
biggest concern is that they'll be expensive."
Lee said that with Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman's proposed housing changes,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls would switch from
graduate to undergraduate housing, a proposition that has
left many graduate students displeased.
"Under current plans with Crothers going to undergrad-
uates, graduate students are losing the
most affordable housing on campus,"
he said. "Also, the engineers have pri
ority at Crothers Memorial.There's no
plan to replace the engineering priori
ty."
"It's kind of a double blow to the
engineers," Adam Beberg, an engi
neering graduate student who attend
ed the meeting, said.
Chun told the GSC that because of
the rising popularity of living off cam
pus, there is less demand for on-cam
pus housing, particularly for the sum
mer months.
"Our concern is about trying to
adjust prices so that they are lower in
the summer and there is more
demand," she said.
Additionally, students at the meet
ing questioned the current University
policy prohibiting students of the
opposite sex from living together
unless they choose more expensive
couples housing.
Alex Ene, a physics graduate stu
dent, claimed that the current policy is
essentially a relationship tax on cou
ples.
"Two single students pay less than
couples in the same apartment," he
said.
"This is probably a very old policy."
Chun said on the subject. "It has to do
with changing times"
Lee told the attendees that the
University is aware of the problems
current policy poses to student cou
ples.
"This is something they want to
change," he said.
