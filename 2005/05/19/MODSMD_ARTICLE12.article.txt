## Sleepless at Stanford: diary of an all-nighter 
### 
If "Stanford: All-Nighter" was an
analogy question, the correct answer
would definitely be along the lines of
"Wall Street: Trading" or "Holly
wood: Movies."
Remember that empowering
feeling during fall quarter of fresh
man year when you stayed up all
night for the first time? Sure, your
parents and older friends had told
you that all-nighters were stupid, but
with the Chemistry 31 midterm and
an 1-Hum paper due the next day, it
was too hard to resist. Post facto, you
probably bragged about it to your

friends, feeling ac
complished and
fully integrated
into the Stanford
community.
1 have a confes
sion to make. Dur
ing my four years at
Stanford, I have
never managed to
pull a solid all-

nighter. There were cramming ses
sions the night before the Human Bi
ology Core midterm, and there were
many instances of late-night socializ
ing, reading and drinking, hut never a
bona fide all-nighter. I have to admit
that for some stupid reason this has
always made me feel somewhat in
adequate. Therefore, I decided that 1
had to try it once — better late than
never, right? — and attempted my
first sleepless night three weeks be
fore graduation.
It went as follows:.
9:20 p.m.: It is time to stock up on
food and caffeine. I go toTresEx and
pick up two bottles of Honest Tea and
a caffeine-free Diet Coke. I know
that too much caffeine will make me
feel jittery, so I am counting on the
placebo effect of the decaf — after
all, it tastes just like regular Diet
Coke. In addition, inspired by some
"Brain and Behavior"-type article, I
pick up a square of marzipan choco
late to make my gray matter happy.
9:30 p.m.: I settle down in Meyer
Library surrounded by my over
priced beverages and chocolate. I
start my all-nighter by making a list
of things to do: revise my honors the
sis presentation slides, do my math
problem set, finish coding my inter
view for the community health class
and write a column for The Daily. I
know 1 am probably forgetting
something important, but that looks
overwhelming enough, so 1 take a big
gulp of the Honest Tea and open up
Microsoft PowerPoint on my com
puter.
10 p.m.: An AIM session with a
friend ensues. As far as 1 am con
cerned, AIM is a nuclear weapon to
work ethics. I decide that the best
way to resist temptation is to yield to
it and spend the next 20 minutes talk
ing to my other friends, including the
girl sitting across the room from me,
checking and judging others' at
tempts at witty away messages, and
trying to come up with a clever one
myself. Unable to do so, I resume
working.
11 p.m.: I am bored out of my
mind and my productivity is ap
proaching zero. I take a break to go
to Moonbean's, but the coffee shop is
sadly closed. The placebo Diet Coke
is not working, and I want something
with actual caffeine. How about
these yellow Vivarin pills that came
with the "care package" that we got
at the Bookstore freshman year? Oh
well, it's too late to go looking for
one, so I drink a glass of cold water
and open the math book.
12 a.m.: If it were Dead Week. I'd
hear the Primal Scream, but right
now I am so tired that I feel like
screaming myself. Being the optimist
that I am, I try to focus on the posi
tive: my honors thesis Powerpoint
looks done. Besides, my thesis advi
sor is asleep, and there is no way I
could get his feedback on the slides
before the next morning. 1 cannot
help but notice that my eyelids are
getting heavy. Uh oh.
1:30 a.m.: I am too old and weak
willed for this. I'll finish the work at a
more appropriate hour. To quote my
favorite cartoon, screw you guys — 1
am going home.
