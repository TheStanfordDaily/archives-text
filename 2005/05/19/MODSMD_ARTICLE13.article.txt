# Diet pill use on the rise among teenage girls
## 
### LAUREN GONG DESK EDITOR 
From benign green tea supplements to
the dangerous fen-phen drug combination,
diet pills exist in every shape, way and form.
With early two-thirds of Americans over
weight and just under one-third obese, ac
cording to the National Insititute of Health,
dieting has become a national hobby. Type
in the words "diet pills" into Google and
you'll receive more than 800,000 hits.
As long as Americans keep buying, the
companies will keep selling. According to
the book "Fat: Exploding the Myths" by
Lisa Colles, Americans spend between $30
and $50 billion each year on diet programs;
$6 billion of this amount spent on fraudu
lent products.
Diet pill use is common among young
people, including college students. A recent
study conducted by Linn Goldberg, head
physician of health promotion and sports
medicine at the Oregon Health and Science
University, revealed that approximately 30
percent of teenage girls have used diet pills
at some point.
Robyn Tepper, chief physician at Vaden
Health Center, said she didn't know
whether Stanford students took diet pills,
but she did state that there is a strong desire
to be thin on campus, which can frequently
lead to drastic measures taken by students.
"1 honestly do not know what students
are taking on their own," said Tepper.
"However, the desire to lose weight is com
mon among students, so I suspect that these
substances are around."
An junior who requested to be anony
mous, said that diet pills are frequently used
within her social circle.
"I live with four girls, and all of us have
at one point taken diet pills this year," she
said. "Sometimes it creates tension within
the group because they seem to make
everyone a little more edgy and prone to
pick fights."
Although some pills do result in weight
loss, the benefits come with a price. Accord
ing to Tepper, common side effects from
weight loss medications include nervous
ness, irritability, headaches, dry mouth, nau
sea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarhea,
sleep problems, intense dreams, and even
heart problems.

Diet pills range the gamut, from the fen
fluramine and phentermine (fen-phen)
combination — that led to more than 100
Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, re
ports of heart-valve malfunction to — nat
ural products such as chitosan extract, de
rived from shellfish exoskeletons, which is
advertised as a fat-hinder in the gut. While
prescription pills go under FDA regulation
and testing, dietary supplements do not,
which is a problem for the consumer.

"Many herbal supplements have not
been studied well and are not regulated by
the FDA," Tepper said. "Therefore, we can
not be sure of the safety of these products."
Tepper pointed out that many natural plants
are actually poisonous, such as some mush
rooms or hemlock, so one should be very
careful when taking natural supplements.
One of those natural supplements previ
ously deemed as safe, ephedra, was at one
point banned bv the FDA when it was

linked to heart attacks, strokes and even
some deaths. Ephedra, otherwise known as
ma huang or Ephedra sinica, is derived
from an evergreen plant and was used by
the Chinese to treat asthma or hay fever ac
cording to WebMD.com, an online medical
resource. A powerful stimulant, ephedra
causes the heart to beat faster and also
leads to bronchial tubes expansion.
In April of last year, the ephedra ban
took affect, but soon after a court case
weakened the FDA's power over ephedra
sales. In mid April, a federal court judge
ruled that the FDA could not ban ephedra,
or products that contain 10 milligrams or
less of ephedra due to the FDA's inconclu
sive evidence that low doses of ephedra was
linked to health problems.
Some consumers remain wary., such as
the junior who chose to remain anonymous,
now look for ephedra-free products when
shopping for diet pills.
"1 choose diet pills that are ephedra free
just to be safe," said the anonymous junior.
"I know that diet pills in general are not
necessarily safe, but I equate them to taking
something like caffeine pills."
And for consumers who are worried
about fraudulent products, the federal
government has taken action. On Nov. 9 of
last year, the Federal Trade Commission,
or FTC, began what was named "Opera
tion Big Fat Lie," a nationwide law en
forcement sweep against six major com
panies selling fraudulent products or
making false claims. By targeting those
companies, the FTC is pushing to stop de
ceptive advertising and possibly lower the
sales of fraudulent — sometimes danger
ous — products.
"False and misleading advertisements are
about as credible as a note from the Tooth
Fairy," said Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Deborah Piatt Majoras in a press
release. "As part of our eno tolerance! policy,
we are announcing six new cases against ad
vertisers using bogus weight loss claims. By
also working with media outlets to reject
false ads and educating consumers to make
informed choices, the FTC hopes to keep this
national obesity epidemic from getting
worse."
