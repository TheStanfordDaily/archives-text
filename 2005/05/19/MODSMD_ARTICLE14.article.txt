# Good news for tennis players
## New research for treatment of "tennis elbow" 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman Whitney Deason had her
share of injuries. A member of Stanford's
women's tennis team, Deason has suf
fered from a number of injuries ranging
in severity from strained muscles to
sprained ankles to shoulder problems.
And Deason is not a stranger to ten
donitis in her arm,a common type of ten
donitis known to avid tennis players
as"tennis elbow."
But Deason and other tennis lovers
everywhere may have less to worry about
in the future as a new treatment for ten
donitis is now undergoing national test
ing. Allan Mishra, an orthopedic surgeon
at the Menlo Clinic, an affiliate of the
Stanford Hospital, has developed a way
to use the body's own chemistry to heal
injuries sustained by overuse.
Tendonitis in one's arm occurs when
the muscles that pull the arm backwards
become injured through overuse, strain
or a direct hit. These muscles become in
flamed, causing a severe burning pain on
the outer side of the elbow. The elbow
also tends to appear swollen and may feel
tender. In severe cases, the muscles may
even tear, causing pain during simple mo
tions.
Although tendonitis in the arm is most
commonly associated with sports such as
tennis, racquetball, squash and weight
training, the non-athlete is also at risk.
According to Mishra, any repetitive
stress on the elbows and wrist is a risk fac
tor for tendonitis. In fact, tendonitis in the

wrist is actually most common in people
who spend eight hours a day in front of
their computers or planting petunias in
their gardens.
In most cases, the pain and tenderness
associated with tendonitis subsides with
rest and restriction of the stress-inducing
activity. Physicians also often recom
mended stretching and strengthening ex
ercises. In addition, anti-inflammatory
medication is sometimes recommended if
necessary.
Activity restriction, however, may be
near to impossible for the college level or
professional athlete.
Deason admits that frequent injuries
can be an impediment to any training
regime, but currently Deason and her
teammates, for the most part, practice
through the pain of minor muscle strains.
"Often times we continue to train and
do what we can without aggravating the
current injury," Deason said. "If an injury
could possibly be serious and there is
enough pain, then we stop practicing, but
our training schedule definitely changes
depending on the severity of our in
juries."
For those who play recreation sports,
tendonitis can also be a hindrance.
Freshman Esther Cheng played tennis
in high school and said that oftentimes
her teammates played through their pain.
"More than once I've seen people ig
nore the doctor and play against the rec
ommendation." said Cheng.
According to Mishra, those who con
tinue to train through their pain put
themselves at risk for more serious injury.

"Tennis elbow is more of a nuisance
than a big disaster, but it can impact activ
ity severely," said Mishra." Repetitive
stress can lead to tear of the tendon."
For Deason and her teammates,
Mishrai's study may prevent many future
painful practices.
At the annual meeting of the Ameri
can Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in
February, Mishra presented findings that
treating people suffering from tendonitis
with platelet-rich plasma, or PRP, a deriv
ative of blood, can help heal overuse in
juries. PRP contains potent growth fac
tors that aid the development and differ
entiation of blood cells, which can help re
pair ligaments and tendons. Mishra and
his team found that treatment of tennis
elbow with PRP decreased the pain felt
by patients with the disorder. In eight
weeks, patients recorded that their pain
had decreased by 60 percent. After six
months, patients felt their pain decrease
by 81 percent.
A national trial is now in the works to
evaluate Mishra's findings. Planned to
commence in the late summer or early
fall, the double-blind, randomized study
will be conducted at several centers
across the country. These centers hope to
simulate Mishra's results in hopes of find
ing effective treatment for tendonitis.
If the study is a success, the Food and
Drug Administration may approve
platelet-rich plasma for the treatment of
tendonitis. Until then, tennis players
and computer-users alike will have to
bear the pain â€” or be cautious about
their habits.
