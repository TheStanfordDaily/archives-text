# Students drawn to Star Wars as if by force

### JOHN WALKER SCROLL 
(U-WIRE) REXBURG, Idaho— Yoda gets
zapped. Padme cries. Palpatine lights Mace
Windu and — is that Chewbacca?
The last installment of the "Star Wars" saga;
"Episode 111 — Revenge of the Sith," is coming
to local theaters today.
Star Wars fans are preparing for what could he
a huge blockbuster, following in the tradition of
all earlier Star Wars films.
Many fans say they were satisfied by
"Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Clones";
the latest installments of the Star Wars films, but
they hope George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars
saga, will finally bring his series to a satisfying
close.
"The first two films were adventurous, they
kept me interested the whole time," Sierra Garcia
a freshman from Murrieta Calif, said. "Since this
is the last one, I have higher expectations."
Some fans have been getting sneak peaks of
the film by watching the "Episode 111" movie
trailer.
For weeks leading up to the release of the new
trailer, rumors and bootleg copies Hew across the
Internet. In fact, some BYU-Idaho students even
got their hands on a copy of still photos from the
movie that outline and describe what happens in
nearly every scene.
While these students declined to give their
name, thev did sav that "Revenue of the Sith" will

not be a disappointment.
In fact "Revenge" is rated PG-13 for "sci-fi
violence and some intense images," according to
www.movies.yahoo.com It is the first of the six
movie saga to be rated above a PG rating.
But this doesn't make much of a difference for
fans. "I'll still go see it." Garcia said. "I just want
to see how Anakin turns into Darth Vader and
how his face gets all messed up."
In "Revenge," Anakin Skywalker is the lead
ing character who eventually turns to the dark
side and becomes Darth Vader. Through this
telling, the Galactic Empire forms and the Jedi
Council is destroyed.
Rumors about "Revenge"have been circulat
ing the Internet since the release of Attack of the
Clones in 2(M)2. But whatever audiences want to
know (or don't want to know), die-hard Star
Wars fans are split on whether or not to pursue
early release material.
"I like to get a sneak peak at what's coming
because my curiosity is too strong for me to
wait," Lacey Martin, a junior from Moses Lake,
Wash., said.
"Seeing what the movie is about doesn't spoil
it for me, it just makes me more excited for when
the movie comes out." Martin said.
However, some students would prefer not to
know what Revenge holds in store. They say that
the mystery is part of the whole appeal.
Nancy Harvey, a senior from Rexburg, is a big
Star Wars fan. She is looking forward to seeing
the movie, but doesn't want any of the surprises

spoiled.
"It doesn't bother me that people talk about
the movie and the rumors and ideas about what
is going to happen," Harvey said. "However 1
don't want to know the rumors, so I just don't
read them."
Telling Star Wars fans not to speculate about
"Revenge" would be impossible. But there seems
to be a justification for pirated photos and story
lines off the Internet.
Speculation of what Revenge holds in store is
perhaps too much for some fans to bear, there
fore they go searching.
"There are so many unanswered questions
from the other movies," Harvey said. "I'm look
ing forward to putting all the puzzle pieces
together."
Scott Baird.a freshman from Richland, Wash.,
said that real Star Wars fans should respect the
way things are done and not post or read spoilers
on the Internet.
I think that as a true Star Wars fan you should
respect the way things are done," Baird said.
"Skipping ahead spoils the plot, I think."
Some Web sites even speculated as to what the
movie rating would be. "Revenge" was
announced with a PG-13 movie rating and the
movie promises to be an emotional tearjerker
with the death of many prominent characters.
"It's Star Wars how violent can it get," Baird said.
"Throughout all the movies they have kept a pretty
good standard with violence. I would like to see a lit
tle more intense version of Star Wars, though."
