(U-WIRE) POMONA. Calif. — Jacqueline
Legaspi, a 21-year-old communication stu
dent at California Polytechnic Institute at
Pomona, says she wishes she would have
been more informed five years ago when she
began taking Orthotricyclen-10, a form of
birth control.
She was on the pill for about three years but
still managed to get pregnant. Legaspi said she
didn't know how her pregnancy could have hap
pened while on the pill. It wasn't until a visit to
her doctor that she was informed the pill is 99.9
percent effective only if used in combination
with a condom with spermicide.
"Someone should have told me before,
because I had been on it fora while and all of a
sudden I was pregnant," she said. "1 don't know
what to trust anymore."
According to a recent study by Ortho-McNeil
Pharmaceutical. Inc., when choosing a birth con

trol pill, women are looking fora contraceptive
that's safe with few side effects.
ITie same rings true with Cal Poly-Pomona
women.
But some women don't have as much infor
mation as they should or would want about the
pill.
Liz Pavlik, a fourth-year communication stu
dent, said she did get some very basic informa
tion about her birth control pill. Orthotricyclen.
when she started taking it.
"I got it at the health center and the nurse
practitioner told me basic stuff like, effectiveness,
side effects and how long it would take to go into
effect," said Pavlik.
But sometimes this basic information isn't
enough.
According to the Ortho-McNeil study, many
women have become concerned with an occur
rence called breakthrough bleeding, which is
essentially just unexpected bleeding during the
month.
Women are not aware that this is normal in

the first three months of taking the pill and can
happen for no reason. Breakthrough bleeding
occurs in 10 to 55 percent of women who start
the pill.
"[Breakthrough bleeding] can depend on the
girl. Some girls adapt well to taking the pill and
others don't," said Katrina Lee, a peer health
educator at the Wellness Center.
Some other reasons for breakthrough bleed
ing include forgetting to take a pill or taking it at
different times of the day.
For detailed information about the pill, the
Wellness Center offers a birth control options
class. Hie class is aimed at showing alternative
birth control options, how to use them and their
effectiveness. Participants also get a chance to
ask any questions they may have.
Because of the common side effects
women are unaware of when on the pill, some
discontinue use. According to the Ortho-
McNeil study, in the U.S., this accounts for
about 700,000 unplanned pregnancies each
year.
