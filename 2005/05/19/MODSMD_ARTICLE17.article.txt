## Editorial Bolton is the wrong choice for U.N. 
### 
John R Bolton should not be our next
ambassador to the United Nations. His
personality does not fit the job, and he
would not present a good image of the
United States to the rest of the world.
President George W. Bush made a mis
take in nominating Bolton, who has been
the undersecretary of state for arms con
trol since May 2001, and we hope that the
U.S. Senate recognizes the nominee's
faults and does not confirm him for the
position.
Last ITiursday, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted 10-8 to send
Bolton's nomination to the full Senate,
but it did so without a recommendation.
The vote was along party lines, but Sen.
George Voinovich (R-Ohio) expressed
such doubt in Bolton's ability to get the
job done that he agreed to support the
nominee only if the committee would
withhold its recommendation — a pro
cedural move that is very rare.
Though it is upsetting that Bolton's
nomination has gotten as far as the full
Senate, the fact that he passed without an
endorsement is an encouraging sign.
After the committee passed the nomina
tion. Voinovich said that he planned to
vote against Bolton when the nominee
comes up in the full Senate and would
encourage other senators to do the same.
Bolton needs a simple majority of 51
votes to win confirmation, and though
Republicans control 55 seats in the
chamber, there will undoubtedly be a
few who, like Voinovich. will defect from
the party and vote against the embattled
nominee. We must hope that at least six
of these senators will recognize the prob
lems that Bolton would present to the

United Nations.
Bolton has been described by journal
ists and commentators as a combative and
stubborn man, and a person with these
two traits will not fare well in an organiza
tion like the United Nations in which
communication and collaboration are
key.Three times over the course of his ca
reer, Bolton attempted to have intelli
gence agents punished for trying to pre
vent him from making false claims about
weapons programs in other countries.Try
ing to modify intelligence to fit his own
needs is enough to disqualify Bolton from
the position by itself, but he has also held
the United Nations in contempt through
out his career in international affairs.
Moreover, in a 1994 speech, Bolton told
his audience, "There is no United Nations.
There is an international community that
occasionally can be led by the only real
power left in the world — that's the Unit
ed States — when it suits our interests and
when we can get others to go along." This
attitude is unacceptable fora potential
member of the United Nations, and the
fact that Bolton is even being considered as
U.S. ambassador to that world body is scary
in itself. His nomination reflects how light
ly we take the United Nations and the in
ternational community in general.
If the Senate chooses to confirm
Bolton for the job, the United States
would be signaling to the international
community that we do not care about
our relationship with it. On the other
hand, if the Senate decides to vote
down Bolton's nomination, it would be
a good first step in trying to repair our
fractured relationship with the rest of
the world.
