## Deep ecology: No more 'people' 
### 
What do I mean by "no
more 'people'"?
The phrase could mean
"no more people than we
have now" — limiting our
population tor the sake of
other species — or it even
could mean "zero people."
There's a group called the
Voluntary Human Extinc
tion Movement with the

slogan, "May we live long and die out."'
What 1 really mean by "no more 'people'
" is something that both of these ideas exem
plify: no more putting people first. Just as
scientific discoveries prompted a shift in
paradigms from a geocentric to a heliocen
tric solar system, discoveries about human
relatedness with other species call fora shilt
in priorities from anthropocentrism to eco
centrism.
This is the heart of a philosophy 1 like
very much: deep ecology. Its tenets include:
• The well-being and flourishing of
human and nonhuman life on earth have
value in themselves.
• The flourishing of human life and cul
tures is compatible with a substantial de
crease of the human population. The flour
ishing of nonhuman life requires such a de
crease.
• Humans have no right to reduce this
richness and diversity except to satisfy vital
needs.
• Those who subscribe to the foregoing
points have an obligation directly or indi
rectly to participate in the attempt to imple
ment the necessary changes.
How would putting the earth first make
things different?
• Instead of weighing the costs and bene
fits of drilling for oil in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, we never would have con
sidered it.
• No more clear-cutting.Though it's log
gers' preferred method of harvesting trees, it
also causes the most damage to forest
wildlife and soil.
• Don't develop any more undeveloped
land. Instead, "un-develop" land. Die Great
Plains Restoration Council is working to
create the Buffalo Commons, a restored cor
ridor from Mexico to Canada where buffalo
can migrate freely.
• To take the principle even further, indi
viduals could put the earth's interest even
ahead of their own. Many people talk about
helping the world by doing what they love,
but it's rare to hear of people making sacri
fices for the biosphere the way they would
for families and friends. Yet there are plenty
of sacrifices that would help, such as choos
ing not to have children.

1 think putting the earth first ironically
can help us deal with some of the hardships
of not being first anymore ourselves.
• While there might not be a god taking
care of us, we can take solace in having an
earth that takes care of us.
• Some people find it depressing to think
that "humans are just animals." But if we ap
preciated the intelligence and importance of
other animal species, the view could be, not
"Oh. humans are just animals," but rather
"Wow! Humans are animals!"
• I can think of nothing that would in
crease my peace of mind more than knowing
my species was living sustainably and equi
tably in the world. It's the difference be
tween being in orbit in a space station, and
hurtling toward the ground in a crashing
plane.
• Many people diagnose our culture with
narcissism (e.g. Christopher Lasch). It's not
hard to see why individuals would be narcis
sistic, when our species as a whole is among
the most narcissistic in terms of its dealings
with the ecosystem. If our species respected
the interests of other species, maybe we'd re
spect the interests of other humans.
• We might no longer believe in life in the
traditional sense, but when we see ourselves
as part of the world, and food for other
species just as they are food for us, death
isn't as daunting.
• Deep ecology can be a general return
to eastern and earth-based religious prac
tices. I personally don't believe in "God,"
but I certainly believe in the earth (I can
see it, feel it, no one asks me whether I be
lieve in it, etc.) and 1 have good reason to
be grateful for it, since it provides for my
needs and so forth. Lately, there's been dis
cussion (e.g. in"The God Gene") — about
our need to worship something. Why not
"worship" the earth and the biosphere?
Deep ecology is starting to sound like trib
al religion.
There's yet another meaning to the call
for "no more 'people.' " Maybe it would be
good if we ceased to see "people" as non-an
imals and "people" as owners of the earth
and went back to being more like "humans"
as the diverse, intelligent species that lived
more or less in equilibrium with the earth
for thousands of years. In that sense of the
phrase, too. I advocate no more people: not
too many people, not people first and not
people as pariahs of the ecosystem. But "hu
mans" as Homo sapiens, putting the earth
they depend on ahead of themselves, I advo
cate whole-heartedly.
