## New program on issues of inequality announced 
### DEBASHISH BAKSHI 
Members of the Institute for Research in the
Social Sciences, or IRiSS, tackled issues of
social, racial and gender-based inequality during
a conference yesterday in the Tresidder Oak
Room.
"Great universities have a responsibility to
solve global challenges," University Provost John
Etchemendy said in his introductory remarks.
"And such challenges are solved at the intersec
tion of the social sciences."

IRiSS will be expanded to include a new "pro
gram in inequality," Sociology Prof. David
Grusky announced during the event. This inter
disciplinary program would include a new under
graduate course on "Controversies about
Inequality" and the creation of a Web site to act
as a clearinghouse for relevant research.
Sociology Prof. Paula England, whose
research interests include the gender wage gap
and gender dynamics in the family, has analyzed
gender inequality over the past 40 years. Her
main finding is that American women are filling
typically male jobs at a faster rate than American
men are adopting female roles. England found a
similar trend in the acquisition of college
degrees.

Maria Charles, professor of sociology at U.C. San Diego, addresses gender discrimination at tfie Institute
for Research in the Social Sciences' "Conference on Inequality."
Throughout the conference,
speakers from a wide range of
academic disciplines shared their
perspectives on topics such as
criminal justice, health care, race
in America, and gender.
Speakers presented a variety of
data to highlight the significance
of the idea of the "mass-imprison
ment society." For instance,
between 1980 and 1990, non-vio
lent drug-related arrests increased
by 400 percent, and in 1990 alone
approximately 8.3 percent of
black males in their 20s were
either instate or federal prison.
Larrv Bobo, director of the

Center for the Comparative Study
of Race and Ethnicity, or CSRE,
said that the U.S. judicial system
was "unfair by design."
Sociology Prof. Dan Barr
focused on one question â€”
"When is it appropriate to use a
patient's race to help deciding
treatment?"
Barr cited several reports pub
lished by reputable medical jour
nals showing that drugs pre
scribed for heart conditions have
different effects on patients of dif
ferent ethnicities.
Then, drawing on a study about
the link between genetic informa
tion and race and ethnicity, Barr
demonstrated that racial divisions
are much more complicated than
most people believe.
Using Shakespeare as an exam
ple, Barr argued that most doctors

would classify Othello as black,
whereas he was described to be a
North African and therefore
would have been genetically
white. In this vein, physicians must
be cautious before they begin
using race as a basis of medical
practice.
Freshman Diane Cheng said
she found the material discussed
to be relevant to her academic
pursuits, and Bobo is one of her
professors this quarter.
"Most people are aware that
racial minorities are dispropor
tionately represented in prisons,
but some of us just discount that
fact as the result of more minori
ties committing crimes and over
look how seemingly race-neutral
policies have a disparate impact
on certain groups," she said.
