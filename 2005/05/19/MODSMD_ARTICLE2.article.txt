### DEBASHISH BAKSHI 
Members of the Institute for Research in the
Social Sciences, or IRiSS, tackled issues of
social, racial and gender-based inequality during
a conference yesterday in the Tresidder Oak
Room.
"Great universities have a responsibility to
solve global challenges," University Provost John
Etchemendy said in his introductory remarks.
"And such challenges are solved at the intersec
tion of the social sciences."

IRiSS will be expanded to include a new "pro
gram in inequality," Sociology Prof. David
Grusky announced during the event. This inter
disciplinary program would include a new under
graduate course on "Controversies about
Inequality" and the creation of a Web site to act
as a clearinghouse for relevant research.
Sociology Prof. Paula England, whose
research interests include the gender wage gap
and gender dynamics in the family, has analyzed
gender inequality over the past 40 years. Her
main finding is that American women are filling
typically male jobs at a faster rate than American
men are adopting female roles. England found a
similar trend in the acquisition of college
degrees.
