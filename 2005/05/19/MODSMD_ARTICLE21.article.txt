# Writing in the Margins
## Seth Shamban and 870 pages of boring 
### 
If it's a Sunday after
noon and I have a paper to
write, hut would rather
write my column, then I'm
probably screwed. Thank
fully, I've come to accept
my inevitable failure at
life and would like to sere
nade you with the sweet
booty of my recent
epiphany.

The only thing that sucks at life more
than yours truly is the summer. Afternoons
in the San Fernando Valley cause me great
pain.The heat presses against the windows,
and the sun sits on the roof. Going outside
fora run or a bike ride in August can only
be categorized as suicide. 1 could swim, but
I'd rather be a curmudgeon.
This year, besides not having definite
plans yet, summer might not be so terrible.
Sure, it'll be hot and smoggy. but one fine day
in July, J.K. Rowling will descend from the
Billionaires' Club and finally let the world
read "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince." Now. I must say that I am looking for
ward to the sixth installment of the Isn't Hog

warts Cool Collection, but only because it will
be a slim 627 pages.
Harry Potter's life required more and
more pages to describe as he aged. The first
book was an accessible 309 pages, the next an
acceptable 352, the "Prisoner of Azkaban" an
engaging 448 pages and then the shit hit the
fan. "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" of
fered an excruciating ride filled with subtle
jabs at the British press and an ungodly num
ber of pages: 734. J.K.. Rowling followed that
opus up with an even more back breaking
tome: At 870 pages, "Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix" is the longest book
that 1 have ever read.
1 shop in the 500-pages-or-less section of
my local reputable book retailer. Every now
and then, I leave the sweet embrace of rela
tively terse writers such as Calvin Trillin and
Yasunari Kawabata, and give myself over to
authors who are nearly as prolific as God.
(Did the Bible have an editor? I mean, real
ly. ) And if I'm going to spend more than eight
hours reading a book, it better be damn good.
"East of Eden" — check. "The Corrections"
— check. "Amazing Adventures of Kavalier
and Clay" — check. "Harry Potter and the

Goblet of Fire" — no go.
With her expanded page limit,J.K. Rowl
ing created less taut and affecting stories. 1
read the fifth "Harry Potter" in record time,
sitting on my bed with a lamp on late into the
night. I read it to get it over with.Two years
later, I can't even begin to describe the plot
of the book except that the climax was anti
climactic, and it was terribly overwritten. In
anticipation of "Harry Potter and the Half-
Blood Prince," 1 calculated how long it
would be based on the increase in length
from book to book. Based on false calcula
tions, 1 deduced that it should be 968 pages,
and I complained about it, a lot, to many
people.
When the length of the sixth volume final
ly leaked, I rejoiced. 627 pages is still pretty
long, but it's far shorter than books four and
five. Hopefully, with nearly 300 pages less to
write on, J.K. Rowling's sixth book will avoid
her recent pitfalls and reach the exhilarating
heights of "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban."
