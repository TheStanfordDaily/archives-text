## A 						letter to Hennessy 
### MATT SERIFF-CULLICK STANFORD LABOR ACTION COALITION 
Dear President Hennessy:
On March 28, the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition, or SLAC, received your letter re
sponding to our request fora meeting to con
tinue an ongoing discussion regarding a Code
of Conduct for Employment at Stanford and
the recommendations put forth by the Presi
dential Advisory Committee on Workplace
Policies. We were disappointed that you have
declined to meet with us unless we sign an
statement that we believe would amount to
agreeing to refrain from staging or participat
ing in non-violent protests, a practice student
groups have been using for generations.
Over the past six years, SLAC has always
been committed to pursuing a civil dialogue
with administrators and the larger Stanford
community. We have a long history of com
munication with your office, and have re
quested a meeting with you prior to every
single major action this year. It is only when
you ignore our attempts at creating a civil di
alogue that we take the kind of direct action
you describe in your letter as "disruptive"
and "disrespectful."
As we mentioned above, many have used
direct action effectively to push for social
change, most recently demonstrated by suc
cessful gains in campus labor policy at Har
vard and Washington Universities.
In his "Letter from Birmingham Jail,"
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote,"You may
well ask: 'Why direct action? Why sit-ins,
marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a
better path?' You are quite right in calling,
for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very pur
pose of direct action. Nonviolent direct ac
tion seeks to create such a crisis and foster
such a tension that a community which has
constantly refused to negotiate is forced to
confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize

the issue that it can no longer be ignored
(April 16,1%3)."
As people committed to making positive
change within our university community, we
cannot in good conscience agree to refrain
from the kind of action that so many before us
have used in order to further justice, such as
the struggles to end segregation, apartheid
and child labor.
Furthermore, as the president of this uni
versity, you have a responsibility to the en
tire campus community to engage in dia
logue regarding this and other pressing is
sues. As students, we believe that we have a
responsibility to exercise our freedom of ex
pression in order to transform Stanford into
the just and equitable institution we would
like it to become.
We hope that by re-considering your posi
tion on meeting with us, you will demonstrate
to the larger Stanford community a genuine
commitment to free expression and open dia
logue.
The undersigned share common concerns
about the shrinking protection of student
voice and student access to decision-making
on campus and see the aforementioned issues
in the context of these larger problems.
