Divestment works
I am writing in response to Rahul Kanakia's col
umn regarding the divestment efforts of Students
'Hiking Action Now. Darfur,or STAND (' \vww.stan
fondinvestmenlcom (not a real site)" May 18).
Kanakia is dead-on that divestment should
not be used solely as a way to allow Stanford to
feel better about itself. STAND took this con
sideration into mind when deciding which
companies it would pursue divestment on.
Kanakia also rightfully considers the impact
of divestment on the people of Sudan. Howev
er, local employment opportunities that the
four companies offer in Sudan are limited, at
best. Reports from Human Rights Watch even
indicate that one company. PetroChina, brings
in Chinese prisoners to work the oil fields. Last
ly, the tradeoff of temporarily higher unem
ployment in exchange fora long-term end to
the genocide seems pretty obviously biased in
favor of ending the crisis in Darfur.
Throughout his column, Kanakia claims
that divestment, as a tool, does not work. How
ever, as recently as 2001, institutional divest
ment has worked and in Sudan no less. Intense
lobbying from economic and international in
stitutions during the bloody Sudanese civil war
convinced Talisman Energy Corp. (an oil com
pany doing business in Southern Sudan) to exit
the country. Shortly thereafter, several other
companies followed suit. These companies' de
partures were followed by the historic signing
of the Naivasha Treaty, the most significant de
velopment in years in the country's civil war.
We don't believe that divestment, by itself,
will halt this tragic humanitarian crisis. But it is
an important part of the effort to end the geno
cide in Darfur. Much as divestment helped to
break the back of the South African govern
ment, divestment from these four companies
can help to break the back of Khartoum.
