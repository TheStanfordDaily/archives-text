## The 						Double Clutch Topher's worst sports moments 
### 
November 23, 2002: Probably the worst
day of my life as a sports fan. Anguish,
disappointment and depression racked
me at every turn. I use a complex and sophisti
cated system to decide who I root for in college
football, and that day.it all went to hell.
First, I attended the Harvard-Yale game.

{Note: I did not attend either
school. I was rooting for Yale
for reasons not hard to figure
out.) For those who have not
seen the Harvard Coliseum,
it's basically one huge block of
granite. It was just above
freezing that day, and despite
its charm, the place had all the
comfort of a meat locker.
Harvard is arguably the
best program in the Ivy

League, and uncharismatic Yale coach Jack
Siedlecki is reviled by some of the Yale faithful.
So it wasn't shocking that the C Yimson took the
game over in the second half in front of their
boisterous home crowd (if a gang of Harvard
people could ever be described as boisterous),
powering to a 20-13 win.
I had seen on the scoreboard that my
beloved Michigan Wolverines held a lead
against the undefeated Ohio State Buckeyes,
but after getting home I found they had lost
after giving away the game-winning touchdown
and two turnovers in the last five minutes.
Hoping to salve my pain, my sister and I ven
tured to an Allston, Mass., bar to watch the
Washington-Washington State game — possi
bly the most atrocious display of malicious inep
titude ever seen on the gridiron. It was a stinker
dropped by all three parties involved: the
Huskies, the Cougars and the officials. A bad
team (UW) was just good enough to beat a good
team that played bad, helped along by a Key
stone Cops ref crew.
WSU quarterback Jason Cesser was so
jacked up for the game he was calling for the
snap early and throwing the ball high. Ihe
Cougars' best running back pulled his groin and
Washington got stopped on fourth-and-one.
Cesser suffered a nasty calf injury midway
through the fourth quarter and the Cougars did
n't gain a first down afterward. Cesser's quick
cadence haunted the team as his replacement
Matt Kegel endured an endless series of false
start penalties. Despite taking over on the one
yard line after a botched IJW punt. WSU settled
fora field goal, only to see the I luskies erase the
20-10 lead, with the aid of a Cougar who
roughed the kicker.
With the game refusing to end in the third
overtime,fans were witness to the worst officiat
ing call since Jeffrey Maier. With UW in the lead,
a blitzing linebacker deflected Kegel's pass.
After a long ref conference, it was ruled that the
ball was traveling backward and was therefore a

fumble, and with the Huskies recovering, the
game was over.
Somebody give me a break.The ball traveled
about two feet before getting batted I'm not for
selective enforcement of the rules, but it's un
conscionable to end a game on a call that could
n't even be determined by the TV audience after
multiple angles of replay. And they wonder why
the Pacific-10 Conference officials have the
worst reputation this side of the Big Ten.
To add to the bitterness, I found that Stan
ford had lost its first Big Game in eight years. I
was 0-for-4 on the biggest day of the year. The
memories haunted me for months.There would
be others, though:
2003 Stanley Cup Playoffs: Ihe defending
champion Detroit Red Wings were swept by the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks (who made it all the
way to Game 7 of the finals despite being the
only spoils franchise one degree from Emilio
Estevez).This gave my Penguins-loving ex-girl
friend a great opportunity to shove something in
my face.Thanks, Kathleen.
2001 ALCS: Mariners lose to Yankees. Our
116-victory masterpiece team was emasculated
by the hard-charging New York dynasty, includ
ing a 12-3 Game 5 that wrapped things up. Seat
tle still hasn't recovered from the sting.
2003 ALCS Game 7: NYY 6, Boston 5. I
mention this because it wasn't a worst moment.
I mean, losing the game sucked if you were in
Boston — which 1 was.
One of the wildest Championship Series in
recent memory had gripped the city fora week
and a half, with Boston answering every New
York challenge throughout the series. Ihe Red
Sox' lead in Game 7, though, was not to last as
the Yankees scored the last four runs to advance
to the World Series.
All the scapegoating of Red Sox manager
Grady Little for not lifting tiring starter Pedro
Martinez was deserved, but it wouldn't have
been an issue if Pedro hadn't allowed all those
hits that tied the game in the Bth. nor if a number
of other boneheaded moves had been avoided.
People across the country wanted to blame it
on "The Curse" (which was debunked in my col
umn two weeks ago). Ix-t's get serious. Ihe loss
left the entire Red Sox organization so motivat
ed that it won the whole damn thing the next
season.
Sox fans got to smile a week later, anyway,
when New York lost the World Series in six
games.
Honorable Mention: 1972 Olympic Basket
ball Final (Honorable Mention only because I
wasn't alive at the time); Stanford's Final Four
loss to Kentucky; Cardinal baseball blasted by
Miami in NCAA final; the Buddy Teevens Era.
