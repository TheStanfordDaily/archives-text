# '05 NBA playoffs just like old times
## 
### 
The NBA playoffs have served as a blessing
for those who suffer from what I call "dis
satisfied fan syndrome," or DFS.
Ihose afflicted with I )FS enjoy basketball,es
pecially on the college level, but simply feel frus
tration and anxiety when watching the NBA. One
symptom is a longing for the I WOs, when basket
ball was considered pure.
An idealization of short shorts, the "Bad Boy"
Pistons, MJ before the titles. MJ before the sur-

gery and child molestation
charges and the holy grail of
all modern basketball, Bird vs.
Magic. If DFSers had it their
way, Norman Dale's "four
passes before you shoot" rule
irom Hosiers would be law
for all teams.
Those afflicted with DFS
crave team-oriented and fun
damentally sound basketball.

They despise how the NBA
sometimes looks more like a circus than a sports
league. They squirm at the constant isolation
plays, frustrating turnovers, unnecessary shots
and Kobe Bryant.
Well, folks, it's starting to look a lot like the
NBA is coming full circle, but without the tight
shorts. These playoffs have allowed some to put
away their old Tears for Fear CDs and actually
enjoy basketball, for there is a lot to enjoy.
Hie "Leastern" conference now features
three teams who would make the playoffs in the
West, instead of the usual none.
In fact, the most physical and contested rival
ry the NBA has seen for years will determine who
plays for the championship. The Pistons and the
Pacers have fulfilled our craving fora rivalry in
which the players, coach and even front office of
each team would like nothing more than to bury
the other. The two teams have already given us
one of the most controversial incidents in NBA
history, so who knows what's next?
Hope fully, a long-standing rivalry with memo
rable moments — one that those with DFS will
confuse for. dare 1 say, the old Bulls-Pistons rival
ries (sans Michael Jordan). You can feel the ha
tred in the air when you watch these teams play
each other.
Both teams are throwbacks to the older East
ern Conference teams that played a slower, more
defensive-oriented type of game.
Yet, (and this might really shock you) both
squads actually play gcxxl team basketball and
shoot well. It's especially fun to watch retiring
sharpshooter Reggie Miller face off against Rip
Hamilton — his 21st century clone, complete
with face mask.
The East also features the Miami Heat, the
team I predict will win it all. Those with the syn
drome can associate with this team as it features
the top three picks from the IW2 NBA draft — a

time when DFSers actually enjoyed basketball.
Dwvane "Flash" Wade is a throwback to an era
when NBA players actually tried to make each
other better.
Last year. Wade turned Rafer Alston, a life
time street bailer, into one of the NBAs best
three-point shooters. This year, he's turned
Damon Jones — who was cut by almost every
other NBA team — into, well. Rafer Alston. He's
also helped Christian"! was on the Dream Team"
Laettner look like a real life basketball player.
And, oh yes, the Heat have one of the most
dominant players in NBA history. You may have
seen him; he starred in the hit movie "Kazaam."
Interestingly enough,most of the teams having
success in the playoffs,such as Miami, Indiana and
Detroit,feature a team-oriented style of game that
receives approval from those with DFS.
In the Wild Wild West, Phoenix and San Anto
nio (teams I expect to meet in the Conference Fi
nals ) play completely different styles of team bas
ketball, bringing much needed variety to the
N BA.The Suns, led by the prototypical Canadian
guy next door, S.teve Nash, will run at you in
enough directions to leave your head spinning.
He'll either set up his team's stable of three-point
shooters or pick-and-roll with the human dunk
machine, Amare Stoudemire.
San Antonio plays a more methodical offense
based on ball movement and strong post play.
Tony Parker, probably the only Frenchman in all
of San Antonio, and Manu "Taz" Ginobli comple
ment Tim Duncan, the NBA's most underrated
and understated player.
This year's playoffs have much to offer those
who were turned off by basketball years ago.
Ihe NBA is still not perfect, and even these
playoffs have highlighted some existing flaws. Ex
pansion has diluted talent and even contending
teams fail to feature five legitimate starters. The
game can still be frustrating to watch as players
will take ridiculous shots and pass in ways that
make one wonder if the athletes have actually
played more than 80 games with one another.
Still, these playoffs have been a vast improve
ment over the past few years in terms of overall
quality of play.TTiere is more ball movement,better
shooting and less ball hogging by winning teams.
It's no coincidence that of the NBA's top five
players,the two most able to fit in a team structure
— Duncan and Shaquille O' Neal — are enjoy
ing the most success.The games will only get bet
ter if Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert can stop try
ing to sabotage Leßron James and let him finally
lead the Cavaliers to the playoffs.
So, for the casual basketball fan or those with
DFS,look out for leg warmers and the "Karate Kid
Part 4." It's looking a lot like I*JB5 in NBA land.
