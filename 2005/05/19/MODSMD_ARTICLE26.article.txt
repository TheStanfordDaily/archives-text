### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
No. 25 senior Erin Burdette is in.
Juniors Alice Barnes and Amber Liu are
in. So are sophomores ITieresa Logar and
Anne Yelsey.
And who could forget the fantastic fresh
men, Whitney Deason and Lejla Hodzic?
Ihey're in, too.
With seven Cardinal qualifying for
NCAA Individual Championships, the No.
1 Stanford women's tennis team (23-0) con
tinues NCAA team play in Athens, Ga.,
today with an unwavering message for the
masses: They're in it for the long haul.
Stanford ties the record for the most
number of individual players sent to the
fast-paced tournament, which follows the
NCAA Team Championships. Team action
at Dan Magill Tennis Complex wraps up
with Sunday's final and individual show
downs begin early Monday morning. The
last team to receive seven individual bids
was UCLA in 1982.
But first, the title-hungry Cardinal will
turn their attention to their Round of 16 op
ponent. No. 19 Harvard (19-6).
llie Crimson have mounted a comeback
since last year's first-round disappointment:
the squad deferred to No. 39 Ohio State on
Crimson turf, 4-2. Last year, the Crimson
ended the season with a 14-10 record and a
No. 38 ranking.
With considerable improvement in the
rankings this year, the Crimson have
matched Stanford's wits in first- and sec
ond-round NCAA contests.
After wrapping up a 6-1,6-1 win thanks
to No. I singles player Liu (15-3), Stanford
trounced unranked Army last Friday to
start the postseason at 4-0.
Harvard posted a shutout of its own,
downing Maryland (11-12) after No. 3 sin
gles player Celia Durkin (28-7),a freshman,
topped Jennifer Dent (15-20), 6-4,6-4.
While the Cardinal rolled over Pacific-10
Conference foe Oregon in the second
round, 4-0, the Crimson took on No. 16 seed
Tennessee (15-9) and won easily, 4-1.
Durkin survived an early 4-6 upset from
the Lady Volunteers' No. 95 Victoria Jones
(27-10) to emerge victorious in the last two
sets.
At No. 2 singles, Harvard's Susanna
Lingman (19-9) dispatched Blakeley Grif
fith (20-14) to clinch the match, 6-4,6-3.
After narrowly defeating USC and los
ing the doubles point in a win over UCLA,
the Cardinal said they realized that, for all
its 18 years of league dominance, nothing
could be taken for granted.
With the rollercoaster ride of Pac-lOs

and the first two rounds behind them, the
Cardinal are primed for the next step to
ward another title.
"You can't focus on [any] one team at the
Championships," Barnes said. "I would say
that the entire nation has been unpre
dictable this year."
Stanford surely remembers the shocking
second-round exit of No. 2 Florida (20-2)
last year, when the Gators lost to Miami.
Florida, which is second only to Stanford in
number of NCAA titles won, is seeded sec
ond in this year's tournament.
Stanford might also recall how No. 6
Northwestern (26-2), the NCAA's fifth

seed, took a 4-2 blow from less formidable
Cal in March.
In the face of uncertainty, Liu remains
optimistic about the Cardinal's postseason
prospects.
"It's just a fresh start for us," Liu said.
"Everyone in the conference knows each
others weaknesses, and there are plenty of
rivals."
However, Stanford might not be able to
make a clean break from Pac-10 opponents.
The Cardinal could face the Bears in the
Elite Eight if Cal (14-8) upsets No. 8 Geor
gia (17-7).
Match play begins today at 6 a.m. PST.
