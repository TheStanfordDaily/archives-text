# Cardinal golf hosts West Regional
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford was trotting out five-man
squads packed with future PGA Tour players
during the mid- 19905, one would scarcely have
believed that the Cardinal would be an after
thought on the national scene just a few years
later.
However, since a Stanford team featuring
Tiger Woods, Joel Kribel and Conrad Ray fin
ished fourth at the NCAA Championship in
19%, the Cardinal have made just one other
visit to the year's biggest tournament, notching
a 20th-place finish in 2001.
Nine years after those glory days, Ray is
coaching at his alma mater, anil his Cardinal
host this week's NCAA West Regional hop
ing to find their way into the top 10 and ad
vance fora shot at a national title. Amid a tal

ented field of 27 teams, Stanford may relish its
newfound niche as the little guy on its home
course.
"[To advance to the NCAA Champi
onship] would be a huge accomplishment, es
pecially since a lot of people think we're the un
derdog, and I think we are," said Rob Grube.
Pacific-10 Conference Freshman of the Year.
"In terms of talent, we'd overachieve, which is
always what you want,but we'd surprise a lot of
people. It would prove that we do have a lot of
talent, and we do have a lot of heart. It would
just lie great to be there."
If ever there were a team primed to upset
the field, this year's Cardinal would be it. Stan
ford comes off a solid sixth-place finish at the
Pac-10 Championship and, more importantly,
a fifth-place showing at Stanford's U.S Inter
collegiate.
Hours of practice on the course have the

Cardinal as comfortable as they've ever been
at home. How comfortable? Sophomore Zack
Miller carded a course-record 64 during a prac
tice round last week â€” on the same day that
Grube shot 66 and senior Kevin Blue shot 69.
"I'm a huge believer that Stanford plays
easier the more you know it and the more
you've seen it," Ray said. "I think that's really
going to help us over the course of the week. I
think the guys have been playing solid, and
everyone kind of realizes that it's do or die for
us, and I don't think anybody's ready for our
season to be over after this week."
As comfortable as the Cardinal have
looked at home, there are two teams at this
week's West Regional who couldn't be happi
er to see Stanford on their travel itineraries.
No. 18 UCLA and San Diego State have
both enjoyed their time at the Farm over the
past two years. In the two tournaments during
that span, SDSU's average team score has
been 4.34 strokes over par / rd, while UCLA's
has been an unbelievable 2.33 strokes over par
/ rd. In comparison, Stanford has played those
same events at an average of 8.17 strokes over
par/rd.
Besides the Bruins and Aztecs, a host of top
teams rounds out this week's field. They in
clude No. 4 UNLV; No. 5 New Mexico; No. 6
Auburn: No. 12 Brigham Young and five other
teams in the nation's top 25.
In individual competition. UNLV's Ryan
Moore and New Mexico's Spencer Levin, the
No. 1 and No. 2 players in the country, highlight
a talented group all trying to claim medalist
honors. The defending co-champions are de
parted seniors TVavis Johnson of UCLA and
Chris Nallen of Arizona.
Ray will send out a lineup of Grube, Blue,
Miller,senior Pat Phillips and sophomore Matt
Savage this week. Though the par-70 6,742-
yard course is not the longest that teams have
faced this year, spring rains have given the
thickening rough a powerful appetite for bala
ta, placing a premium on accurate driving.
"The course is set up tough, but fair." Blue
said. 'The rough is really thick, but if you keep
the ball in the fairway, you have a good chance
of shooting low scores, The rough will be the
main factor of the week."
The three-day event begins today with a
round of 18 holes and continues with single
rounds on Friday and Saturday. Stanford will
tee off from the first tee at 7:12 a.m. today and
from the l()th tee at 11:51 a.m. on Friday.
