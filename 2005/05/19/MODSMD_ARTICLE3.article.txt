# Big Game rescheduled for broadcast

### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
The annual Big Game between Stanford and
UC Berkeley has traditionally ranked as one of
the top football face-offs in the nation. Next year's
match, the 108 th Big Game, will be broadcast
regionally by the ABC television network on Nov.
19. This is the first year it will be aired live on the
West Coast, and in order to accommodate this
change, kick-off at Stanford Stadium has been
pushed back to 4 p.m., three and half hours later
than usual.
"The decision to air the game regionally was

made in concert with Cal," said Gary Migdol,
Stanford's senior assistant athletic director.
The last time ABC televised the game was in
1991, and since then has only been aired by local
ABC affiliate KGO in recent years.
"To be broadcast on a regional basis by ABC is
something that hasn't happened in the past,"
Migdol said. "The Pac-10 has an agreement with
ABC and Fox Sports Network, and [the networks]
are obligated to make some television selections
by May 1 and some by June 1.
Other traditional Pac-10 rivalries will also
receive airtime. The match-ups between the
University of Oregon and Oregon State, and

between Washington University and Washington
State will also be broadcast regionally on the same
day as the Big Game. And while USC and UCLA
used to play on the same day as Stanford and Cal,
their version of the big game will take place two
weeks later on Dec. 3.
ABC is paying Stanford more than $300,000
for the rights to broadcast the game.
"Because the amount is based on a formula, it's
hard to say the exact number," he said.
Most Stanford and Berkeley fans have
approved of the change.
