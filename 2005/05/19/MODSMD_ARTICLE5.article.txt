Wushu — chances are, you've heard of it, but do
you really know what it is? If not, tomorrow night will
be your chance to find out, as the Stanford Wushu
Club hosts "A Night of Wushu." All proceeds from the
performance will go to UNICEF's Tsunami Relief
Fund.
Wushu means "martial arts" in Chinese and is
based on the early practices of Shaolin monks, said
senior Christopher Li, a member of Stanford Wushu.
However, contemporary wushu has evolved into more
of a performance-based art form showcasing the com
plexity of human movement, athleticism and speed, he
said.
"The large term wushu includes quiet internal
forms, such as tai chi, as well as the numerous varia
tions of explosive and showy external forms, such as
long fist, southern fist, animal forms and weapon
forms, among others," said freshman Scott
Blankenship, president of Stanford Wushu.
But wushu isn't just about agility
"To me, of all the martial arts, wushu is the one that
most deserves to be called an art," said graduate stu
dent Filip Krsmanovic, a Stanford Wushu coordinator.
"You can paint a beautiful picture with wushu for an
audience and it feels good for the performer as well —
to answer the physical and mental challenge of getting
your body to do what does not come easily, yet look so
good. Fora guy like me who cannot draw or paint or
sculpt, this is my art."
Recently wushu has enjoyed the limelight, featured
in popular films such as "Hero" and "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon." And the sport may gain an even
greater international following as it is under consider
ation for inclusion in the 2008 Olympic Games in
Beijing.
