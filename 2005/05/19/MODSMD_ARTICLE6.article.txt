# Students opt for private schools
## UCs struggle to up minority enrollment 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University of California schools are always in com
petition with other colleges for high-achieving stu
dents, and even more so for minorities — especially
now, with a growing proportion of minority students
opting for private colleges like Stanford. Education
researchers attribute this trend to the 19% passage of
Proposition 209, which banned affirmative action in
UC admissions processes.
While most of the UC campuses have continued to
attract high numbers of minority students, two of the
most competitive universities, UCLA and UC
Berkeley, have not. This year, Berkeley's incoming
freshman class had the smallest percentage of minori
ty students of any of its UC peers, prompting
Chancellor Robert Birgeneau to call for an investiga
tion into admissions and financial aid standards.
Even though Stanford's tuition is much higher than
that of any of the UCs, financial aid packages can make
a big difference for prospective students.
"Stanford was cheaper because they offered more
financial aid," said sophomore Erica Menchaca. "The
UCs — other than UCSD — didn't have any financial
aid funds to offer me."
Many students say the UC system's neutral stance
on race has altered college decision-making process.
"Applying to college, 1 was choosing between two
very different institutionalized approaches to race,"
said Stanford senior Jeffrey Trevino. "Stanford flew me
— all expenses paid — up fora weekend of program
ming that presented Stanford as a culturally enlight
ened haven of diversity for intelligent minority stu
dents. Berkeley and San Diego, on the other hand,
were unable to give me any special treatment because
Prop. 209 prohibits them from
devoting attention to race in
admissions."
Trevino said that while he
knows there are many ethical
issues related to affirmative-action

admissions policies, a good person
al experience with a university is
often the deciding factor.
"Stanford has the resources and
legal permissions to actively recruit
smart students of underrepresent
ed backgrounds, and it works," he
said.
Stanford Director of
Admissions Anna Marie Porras
also emphasized Stanford's active
promotion of diversity.

"Our prospective students real
ize what our current students and
faculty know from their own expe
riences here — that an intellectual
adventure of exploration and dis
covery requires a campus that
embraces diversity of all kinds and
at all levels," she said. "It is no sur
prise that a diverse pool of students
will want to study and live at an
institution that mirrors that diversi
ty."
