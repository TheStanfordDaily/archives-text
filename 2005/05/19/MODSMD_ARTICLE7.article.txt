### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Office for Religious Life
held an open interfaith memorial
service for members of the Stanford
community yesterday in the Round
Room of Memorial Church. The
service, entitled "Honoring Lives,
Remembering Losses," was intend
ed to give attendees the chance to
honor their loved ones who have
passed away.
This is the eight year the spring
quarter service has been held as a
complement to a quarterly work
shop for students on grief and

bereavement sponsored by
Counseling and Psychological
Services, Residential Education and
the Office for Religious Life.
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann,
senior associate dean for religious
life, said the memorial was opened
up to the entire Stanford communi
ty rather than just students to pro
vide a more inclusive atmosphere.
"It was our sense that the experi
ence of those we've lost pervades
our lives at Stanford and we wanted
to create the time and place to
honor their importance within the

Stanford community," she said.
Although the specific date of the
event changes each year, it is always
held in May to coincide with Spring.
"We chose Spring Quarter both
for the imagery of the season â€”
green emerging after the dark of
winter, and to gather people as they
were planning to go off into other
realms of their lives," Karlin-
Neumann said.
Although the Religious deans
have developed a special type of
liturgy for the memorial, this year
speakers read sacred texts from
Jewish, Buddhist, Christian, and
Muslim traditions. The service was
also composed of various activities

encouraging reflection and remem
brance.
"[The service] always includes
quiet music for meditation, an
opportunity to do some reflection in
writing, the lighting of candles in
memory of those we've lost, con
cluding with the eating of strawber
ries, which in the Ojibway Native
American tradition is considered a
'heartberry.' to affirm life," Karlin-
Neumann said.
Although this was a capstone
service for the Grief Group, Karlin-
Neumann hoped that the Memorial
experience would result in
increased bonds among Stanford
students.
"I was touched by the care and
support students from the Grief
Group offered to one another.
Once the story of their loss has been
told to one another, the bonds are
deep and enduring," she said.
