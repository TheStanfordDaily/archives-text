# Cardinal face red-hot Wildcats
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last season's Cardinal lineup was nearly unstoppable. The 2004
squad — which went 46-14 — posted a team batting average of
.324, a .520 slugging percentage, 499 runs and 230 extra-base hits.
One Pacific-10 Conference team has put up eerily similar num
bers in 2005. Unfortunately, it isn't the Cardinal.
The power-hitting Arizona Wildcats (34-16, 14-4), who have,
amazingly enough, outdone the 2004 Cardinal in several offensive
categories, will travel to Sunken Diamond this weekend for
Stanford's final home series of the season.
Arizona currently leads the conference in virtually every bat

game in order to avoid being rolled.
Stanford (30-19. 10-8) has the misfor
tune of entering the series on a sour note
after losing any chance of defending its
Pac-10 title last weekend and falling out of
the top 25 for the first time in 12 years.
Arizona, on the other hand, is coming
off of a series win over rival Arizona State,
another team noted for its bat power. The
Wildcats outscored the Sun Devils — who
swept Stanford last month — by a 36-10
margin on the weekend and held onto sec
ond place in the conference.
Leading the way for the hot-hitting
Wildcats is junior outfielder Trevor Crowe,
who, like his team, leads the Pac-10 in just
about every offensive category. Crowe is
