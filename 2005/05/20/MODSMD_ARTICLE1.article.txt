# Cardinal face red-hot Wildcats
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last season's Cardinal lineup was nearly unstoppable. The 2004
squad — which went 46-14 — posted a team batting average of
.324, a .520 slugging percentage, 499 runs and 230 extra-base hits.
One Pacific-10 Conference team has put up eerily similar num
bers in 2005. Unfortunately, it isn't the Cardinal.
The power-hitting Arizona Wildcats (34-16, 14-4), who have,
amazingly enough, outdone the 2004 Cardinal in several offensive
categories, will travel to Sunken Diamond this weekend for
Stanford's final home series of the season.
Arizona currently leads the conference in virtually every bat
ting category, including batting average (.334), slugging percentage

(.542). runs (439), hits (613), doubles (135),
triples (38) and sacrifice Hies (33). While
most college coaches — including Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess — preach that
pitching and defense will win champi
onships. offensive juggernauts like Arizona
can still be formidable postseason con
tenders, which means that the Cardinal will
have to be sharp in every aspect of the
game in order to avoid being rolled.
Stanford (30-19. 10-8) has the misfor
tune of entering the series on a sour note
after losing any chance of defending its
Pac-10 title last weekend and falling out of
the top 25 for the first time in 12 years.
Arizona, on the other hand, is coming
off of a series win over rival Arizona State,
another team noted for its bat power. The
Wildcats outscored the Sun Devils — who
swept Stanford last month — by a 36-10
margin on the weekend and held onto sec
ond place in the conference.
Leading the way for the hot-hitting
Wildcats is junior outfielder Trevor Crowe,
who, like his team, leads the Pac-10 in just
about every offensive category. Crowe is

hitting .427 on the season with a .759 slug
ging percentage — not to mention 22
stolen bases. Crowe's 12 triples are four
more than total number of triples by the
entire Cardinal lineup.
The projected first-round draft pick is
only the best in a whole lineup of consis

tent bats. Six of Arizona's starters are hit
ting above .340. while all but one starter
are hitting above .300 in Pac-10 contests.
The Cardinal hurlers have a good
chance of at least slowing Arizona's nine
runs-pcr-game production. Juniors Jeff
Gilmore and Mark Romanczuk have set
tled well into the first two starting jobs,
while junior closer Matt Manship and
sophomore reliever Blake Holler have
molded reliability into the bullpen's char
acter.
Stanford's offense, however, will have

to forge a new identity for itself in order to
support its pitching staff. The Cardinal
average more than six runs per game, but
the teams bats have fallen silent in a few
contests that would have otherwise been
within reach.
Stanford will face a decent, but hardly
impressive Wildcats pitching staff that
allows nearly five runs per game on aver
age in conference games. Ace John
Meloan is 8-2 overall, but 3-2 in Pac-10
play. Sunday starter Sean Rierson will be
starting in only his second conference con

test of the season. Tomorrow's starter,
Kevin Guyette, is the most solid of the trio,
posting a 4-1 Pac-1() record (9-4 overall)
with a 3.70 ERA (3.75 overall).
Arizona also has a proven weapon in
the bullpen in closer Mark Melancon, who
ranks fourth in the Pac-10 in ERA (2.45)
and third in saves, with eight.
The series will kick off today at 6 p.m.,
and the contest will he followed by the
annual Town and Country Village fire
works show. Tomorrow's and Sunday's
games will begin at 1 p.m.
