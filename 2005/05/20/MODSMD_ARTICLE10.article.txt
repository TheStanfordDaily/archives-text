While post-Sept. 11 immigration laws
have caused a nationwide drop in the num
ber of international students coming to the
United States, Stanford has bucked the
trend.
"International student enrollment num
bers have not decreased since 2001," said
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel Inter
national Student Center.
Across the country, international stu
dent enrollment has fallen by 2.4 percent
since 2003.The decline is thought to reflect

both shifts in the global economy and new
security laws, which require extensive
screenings for students seeking visas â€”
particularly those in science and technolo
gy fields.
Even so, the number of Indian students
studying at Stanford has increased by 23
percent over the last two years.
"I haven't been really affected by any of
the new laws personally, but a lot of interna
tional students have been,"said Indian citi
zen Akhil Gupta, a first-year graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering from the
United Arab Emirates.
"We're required to carry an 1-20 (inter

national student document) and passport
at all times," Gupta explained. "I know a lot
of my friends who are recent immigrants do
that, because they're scared. I don't do it
anymore, because it's unnecessary. Most
people are pretty tolerant.
Gupta added that Indian students have
been less affected because, like China, the
country has maintained good relations with
the United States.
But still many international students are
making the choice not to remain in the
United States after graduation. Several In
dian students said there are better job op
portunities waiting for them at home.

"When I first got here,a lot of Indian stu
dents weren't sure about whether they'd
stay after graduation." said senior Vishal
Dhandhia. "Now almost all of them are
sure they're going back.'lhey think of their
years at Stanford as more of a four-year va
cation."
Most international students at Stanford,
however, characterized the new rules as lit
tle more than a nuisance.
"As a European student who came in
2001.1 can tell you that the rules have not
grown too annoying for me personally."
