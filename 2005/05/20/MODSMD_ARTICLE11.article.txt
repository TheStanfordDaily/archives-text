# Grad students and their children gather
## EV gears up for carnival 
### JENNY ALIEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pony rides, clowns making balloon pen
guins and a petting zoo will be just several of
the attractions at tomorrow's Graduate Fam
ily Carnival in Escondido Village.
Hosted by EV family community associ
ates, or family C As, the party will run from 10
a.m. to 1 p.m. on the field next to the play
ground structure between the Hulme and
Barnes neighborhoods.
"The carnival is a reflection of the focus of
the graduate families — our children." said
EV Family CA Maggie Ellis, who will be vol
unteering at the carnival."lt is a big, fun event
and the kids love it.The scope of the carnival
and the time put in by the organizers shows
how much we care about the qualitv of life in
EV."

Carnival coordinators said they hope the
event will provide students and their spouses
with a rare opportunity to spend time with
their children and neighbors. Such events are
what build a sense of community, they added.
"Moms and dads can take an afternoon
off from school work and study and spend
some quality time with their children." said
Emily Shunn, also an EV family CA."I know
that my son Jack is really looking forward to
the carnival, especially the snow cones and
cotton candy."
Andy Hernandez, assistant dean of gradu
ate life,estimated that S(X) adults and children
will attend.
"Many new friendships are made as grad
students and their spouses or partners meet
other graduate families in a setting that is fun
and safe," Hernandez said. "It's also
one of the few carnivals in the area that
is aimed specifically at little children
ages one to five, who make up the ma
jority of the children living in EV."
EV family CA Kathleen Strickler
said that the carnival is the biggest
event her cohort has planned, both in
terms of cost and staffing.
ITie event started out as a dance on
the EV tennis courts in the late 19K()s,
said Chris Griffith, associate dean of
graduate student life.
"The families and children, in par
ticular, had a fabulous time," Griffith
said. "It was really at that point that we
realized the importance of bringing
families together beyond their individ
ual neighborhoods and to provide op
portunities for them to be a part of a
larger community of students who
share common experiences and chal
lenges. We also realized the impor
tance of providing opportunities in

which children can participate in inter
active activities."
In the early the first carnival
with arts, crafts and games was hosted,
and since then the event has grown to
include face painting, inflatable
jumpers and the petting zoo.
New to this year's carnival is a
magic show and miniature train rides.
Hernandez said the Stanford Band
will also make a guest appearance at
the end of the festival.
"This event is successful because
of the very hard work of our EV Fam
ily Community Associates and the
other volunteers who help out, in
cluding a dedicated group of Stan
ford undergraduates from the Stan
ford Latter-Day Saints Students As
sociation (LDSSA) group," he said.
"We really appreciate the financial
support from the Graduate Student
Programming Board, the Graduate
Student Council and my office — the
Graduate Life Office — which pays
for all the entertainment and refresh
ments."
Strickler, who has coordinated the
event's volunteers for the past five
years, said she considers teamwork in

planning, shopping and setting up the
key to the carnival's continual success.
"I am grateful to the LDSSA for
providing about half of the volunteers
needed this year and for some single
students in family housing who decid
ed to help out," she said. "Family CAs
and other parents of children in EV
round out the number needed —
about 25 volunteers per shift."
In addition, the carnival helps
members of the graduate community
achieve a balance between work and
play.
"1 think often as students, especial
ly students with families, it is easy to get
bogged down with research, home
work," Shunn said. "The carnival is a
great opportunity for people to get out
and forget about that fora few hours
and just enjoy the good weather and
time with family."
Griffith also acknowledged that
graduate study can be all-consuming.
"For student families, who are bal
ancing academic work and family
needs, organized family activities help
maintain a healthy balance and help
sustain a healthy perspective," she
said.
