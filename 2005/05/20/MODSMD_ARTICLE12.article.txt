Stanford's Program in Creative Writ
ing announced yesterday the winners ol
the Bocock-Guerard Fiction Prize and
Urmv-Hardv Poetry Prizes.
Established by Albert Geurard. Eng
lish professor emeritus, and his wife, fic
tion writer Maclin Bocock in 1923. the
$1,000 prize was awarded to fifth-year
senior Sarah Willeman. Junior Mark
Provence and senior Tony TUlathimutte
nabbed the second and third prizes, re
spectively.
"In doing creative work, the feeling of
pouring myself into a project is satisfying
in itself, but it's gratifying in a different

way to realize I've managed to communi
cate with readers." said Willeman, who
won for her story "No Prisoner."
The Urmv-Hardy award was estab
lished in 1930. in part by Clarence Urmy,
described by some as "the first native Cal
ifornian poet." The first prize was award
ed to senior Jade Wang. Seniors Graeme
Mullen and Swati Rao came in second
and third place, respectively.
Creative Writing Assistant Mary
Popek said that this year has been partic
ularly positive since many students from a
diversity of academic departments ap
plied.
"We had more than 140 entries for tie-
tion and poetry," she said. "Both cat
egories received an almost equal
number of entries. This is a little
more than last year. They also come
from all different majors — not just
creative writing or English."
In fact, only one of the winners is
an English major, she said, while
four have creative writing minors.
Wang is finishing her major in
biological science and plans to
spend the next five years pursuing a
doctorate in neuroscience. She
wrote her winning poem, "Last Dry
Season," to "capture a moment,"
she said.
"At the time of writing it, 1 was
obsessed with movement in mo
ments," she said. "It is a moment
stripped of everything except what
it needs to be, when it needs to be
nothing else. Mostly, it's a moment
of realization of destruction."
Willeman, a psychology major,

said that her prize-winning story
revolves around her experiences as
a show-jumping rider.
"I was reluctant to write from
those experiences, because the
girls-and-horses thing is so cheesy.
But there's a lot going on in the
horse show world that you would
n't necessarily imagine — the so
cial issues, the prejudices, the hard
work, the physical dangers, the un
derside of the image of refinement
that a lot of people associate with
horseback riding."
Despite their divergent inter
ests, the winners said they were in
terested in continuing writing while
pursuing other subjects. Mullen,
who wrote a script for Miramax last
summer, said that a love for cre
ative writing has introduced him to
the art of screenplay writing.
Willeman said she is interested
in earning her master's in fine arts
degree in fiction writing down the
road.
The writers will read from their
work on Monday in the Terrace
Room of Margaret Jacks Hall. The
event is open to the public.
