# Surgeon sues Univ., hospital
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A surgeon at Stanford Hospital has filed suit
against both the University and the hospital alleging
racial and gender discrimination.
Denise Johnson, associate professor of surgery
and the only African-American female surgeon at
Stanford, filed the case on Monday in Santa Clara
County Superior Court
She claims, among other things, that she was paid
less than her white and male counterparts, that she
has been unfairly targeted because of past complaints
she made against the University and that she was
asked to submit to a random drug test even though
the practice is inconsistent with hospital policy.
"We believe Dr. Johnson's case is without merit,"
wrote Paul B. Costello. a spokesperson for the Stan
ford Medical Center, in a brief statement.
He also denied that Johnson had been required to
submit to drug testing.
In addition to compensation for lost wages and
emotional distress. Johnson is seeking to prohibit ran
dom drug testing on the grounds that it is a violation
of privacy.
She also claims that she was not asked to apply for
the position of chief of breast surgery even though
she specializes in cancer research and is well-known
in the field. But Costello denied any "pattern of em
ployment discrimination" against Johnson.
"During the past few years." Costello wrote, "Dr.
Johnson has been promoted in two instances: first, to
an assistant dean for medical student advising in Sep
tember 2002 and second, from assistant to associate
professor in the medical school in May 2003."
After she was passed over for the chief of breast
surgery position. Johnson said the hospital reduced
the number of patients she would receive, causing her
practice to lose 77 percent of its business.
In March 2005. Johnson sent an e-mail to the Med
ical School Dean's Office estimating that she had
been paid $500,000 less than "similarly situated sur
geons" since 2000. Less than a week later, she was ac
cused of being under the influence during surgery.
Johnson contends that this incident led directly to the
drug testing, the results of which were negative.
These allegations come as Stanford, like many of
its peer institutions, struggles to increase minority
and female representation.
The University Provost's Advisory Committee on
the Status of Women Faculty, for example, reported
that women in the clinical sciences are "are signifi
cantly less likely than their male colleagues to per
ceive their workplace as supportive" or "to believe
that they receive sufficient information for profes
sional advancement."
Campus-wide, the number of black faculty
dropped by 2.2 percent last year, and the number of
female faculty grew by only 0.4 percent, according to
a report presented to the Faculty Senate on April 28.
Johnson has received numerous scientific grants
for breast cancer research and several teaching and
mentoring awards from the University.
In 1989, she became the first African-American
woman hired in the General Surgery Department. Be
fore that, she worked at the Stanford-affiliated Palo
Alto Veterans Administration Medical Center until
she was fired in 1997 for refusing to take part in firing
or demoting two other physicians.
During her employment at Stan
ford, Johnson and several other fe
male physicians and faculty mem
bers submitted a complaint against
Stanford with the U.S. Department

of Labor.
Her most recent lawsuit claims
that when Stanford learned about
that complaint, Johnson and the
other women were "systematically
targeted" for harassment and dis
crimination.
In a 20(M) article about racism
that appeared in the weekly news
paper Metro, Johnson spoke about
her experience as a minority physi
cian.

"At Stanford, sometimes pa
tients used to think I was a nurse or
a medical student or something,"
she said. "Now that I'm older, they
think that I'm a resident. But you
can't be a full-fledged doctor."
Johnson's attorney, Kathleen
Lucas of the San Francisco-based
Lucas Law Firm, told The San Jose
Mercury News that her client hopes
to continue her work and research
at Stanford.
