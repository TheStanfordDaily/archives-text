## Defend your cable and your honor 
### 
It's amazing how much you miss in the real
world when you lose something as vital and world
connecting as cable on TV. You lose an entire lane
of contact with the outside world and remain igno
rant of such world-changing news such as the re
union of the Backstreet Boys or how J.Lo's latest
attempt at comedy lopped Will Ferrell's at the box
office. What a travesty.
Many have tried to explain to me that not hav
ing cable isn't that big of deal — and is even a good
thing.They tell me that you can use the Internet to
download your precious movies and TV shows

and that you'll spend more of
your time being productive if
there isn't any visual stimula
tion around to distract you.
They are all lies.
First, I still rarely ever leave
my room. It requires too much
effort and movement.
Second, 1 got an e-mail noti
fication from the MPAA after
my first attempt to download
an episode of "Saved By the

Bell." It said that 1 was a horrible person for resort
ing to illegal methods that deprived the poor mak
ers of "Saved By the Bell" from I don't even know
what because it was a long e-mail with lots of big
words and so I stopped reading.
Third, it takes more than turning off my cable to
stop me from procrastinating.
In short, don't get rid of cable. 1 didn't realize
how much I missed it until I had to fight for the TV
in our lounge and explain why a WB show about il
legitimate children is better than "Scrubs."
But now in retrospect, after having spent such a
long time relying on VCRs and other people's
bootleg copies for my TV fix, I've realized it's not
just the convenience of havingTV in my room that
I miss about cable — it's the commercials.
After having spent such a long time living com
mercial-free due to the aid of VCRs, I've really
come to appreciate those previously hated 30-sec
ond segments of shameless advertising. When I oc
casionally watch programs on live TV, I am re
minded of just how strange, random and infinitely
amusing these commercials can be.
I'm probably in the minority. After all, every
one claims to hate commercials. Everyone likes to
complain about how lame and unoriginal com
mercials are. How they shamelessly resort to cute
children or sex symbols to sell products. How an
noyingly they interrupt our programs at the most
inappropriate moments, like when Kirsten on
"The 0.C." just barely manages to avoid a fatal car
accident by braking abruptly in the middle of an in
tersection only to be slammed into by an on-com
ing vehicle semi seconds later. Cut to Neutrogena
commercial.
But while most other people consider commer
cials as "break times" to do productive things like
homework, as a true procrastinator, I watch them
avidly and have started to gain a new appreciation
for their randomness and cheesiness.
The Saturn commercials, for example, are just
amazingly random to the point where I can't tell if
they are works of pure genius or total idiocy For
example, there is one where one lady spends the
entire time talking about the joys of motherhood:
"It's funny," she says. "You spend your entire
life putting yourself first and, then, just like that,
you're second — and you're just so thankful...
That's why I bought a Saturn."
Or the one with a guy who rambles sentimen
tally about his dad:
"I always wanted to be that kind of dad: the
kind of dad that can teach you to throw a perfect
spiral," he says. "That can fix your bike, or a skate
board ramp. That takes you to football games. My
dad was that kind of dad, and now, so am I. That's
why I bought a Saturn."
The Lifetime movie-esque sentimentality is
great and all. but let's be honest here. That's not
why you bought a Saturn. You bought a Saturn be
cause you couldn't afford the Mercedes, just like
the rest of us. I like how even the advertisers could
n't figure out why anyone would want to buy a Sat
urn and had to come up with that sentimental crap.
And in addition to randomness, as a member of
the 18-to-34-year old demographic, I can always
count on at least half of the commercials I see to
bring up sex. crude humor or celebrity endorse
ments.
Plus, commercials are like little sound-bytes of
pop culture, keeping you up-to-date on movies,
clothing lines and detergent. And their interrup
tion of shows just builds more suspense and anxi
ety for the drama.
I'd probably have gotten over that huge semi
crashing into Kirsten out of the blue a lot sooner
and not thought it was such a big deal if they had
n't cut to a Neutrogena commercial right after and
made me wait five whole minutes to find out
whether or nor she was in a coma.
That's something neither the Internet nor
VCRs have been able to recreate. Pop-ups may
recreate the "interruption" factor, but "Punch the
Monkey" and "Win $$$$$Viagrass!!!!" ads don't
really capture the feel or essence of commercials.
So I guess not having cable isn't that bad. No
wait, that's not my point. My point is: Protect your
cable. Because even with the convenience of
VCRs and bootleg copies, you'll still end up miss
ing out on the unappreciated glory of commercials.

Is your roommate trying to turn off your cable
because you can t "afford"it and it's too "distract
ing"? Don 't give in to peer pressure like Shivani
