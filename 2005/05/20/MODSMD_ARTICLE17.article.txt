# More than just nudity: The co-op life
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
At the top of San Juan street, above
the chaos of the Row.sitsa beautiful New
England-style house. Dried herbs and
flowers hang from hooks in the kitchen,
and the scent of fresh bread fills the
rooms. A few people are seated at wood
en picnic tables, while others lounge on
an enormous trampoline in the center of
the lawn.
With its relaxed atmosphere and
earthy undertones, the setting resembles
something out of a Mark Twain novel.
One would never guess that this house is
home to 55 Stanford students.
In addition to Terra. Columbae, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forrest. Chi ITieta
Chi and Hammarskjold, Synergy is one
of the six cooperative houses on campus.

While these co-ops are still a part of cam
pus life, they have a culture that is very
much their own. Each house has its own
unique style and reputation, but they are
all connected by the common emphasis
on community and self-sufficiency.
"People in co-ops are really into
working together," said senior Shannon
Wood, the resident assistant at Synergy.
"They are into being part of a communi
ty and into taking responsibility for their
actions and the way their actions and be
haviors impact and influence other peo
ple."
Unlike most dorms and houses, many
people draw into co-ops by themselves.
This shifts the emphasis from draw
groups to the house as a whole.
"It's really more of a family than a lot
of other places on campus," said sopho
more Laura Bloomfield. "More people

know what you're doing and what's
going on in your life.That's generally why
people choose to live there."
ITiis concept of community is also
nurtured by the communal effort that is
required to keep up a co-op. Every per
son is expected to help out by doing an
equal share of various chores to keep the
house functioning. With the amount of
cooking, cleaning and organizing that co
ops require, many find living in one com
parable to a five-unit class.
'ITiere is definitely a greater sense of
responsibility," said senior Tony DeLisi, a
manager in Chi Theta Chi. "Because the
residents are in charge of the house,
peers come to you for help on repair is
sues. You also have to do all the cooking
and cleaning."

Ibe emphasis on work and re
sponsibility is often what draws peo
ple into co-ops. Students find them
selves wanting to be more account
able to their living environment and
the people around them. Junior Jose
les De La Cruz found that co-op life
at Stanford was the only setting
where he could be responsible for his
own space.
"I really don't like the idea of
other people having to clean up after
me," said De La Cruz, who serves as
the I BF kitchen manager.'"["he kind
of people that join co-ops are those

that arc willing and wanting to clean
lip after themselves."
I lie co-ops house a diverse group
of people, from those who are heavi
ly involved in activist issues to those
who just want to live in a communal
setting.
"In each co-op there's a whole
range of people," said DeLisi. "You
do find the people who are more
e;irthy and hippie, but then there are
the people who joined because they
just really like to cook for themselves
and clean."
lhere are also the more notorious
stereotypes.
"Someone referred to Synergy as
a theme house with the theme of nu
dity once," said Bloomfield, who
lived in Columbae last quarter and
will be the kitchen manager for Svn

ergy next year. "'lTiey legitimately
thought that that was our theme. I
told them that it was more like a fa
vorite past time."
While some students know from
the start that they want to be part of a
co-op. others just stumble into them.
DeLisi did not know that co-ops exist
ed until the spring of his freshman year.
" Iliere didn't seem to be much
community anywhere, and then 1 dis
covered the co-ops," Delisi said."l was
like, 'lliese people are happy, laid
back and not concerned with a lot of
stupid stuff." My draw group drew a 55
and we all went Chi ITieta Chi."
For De La Cruz, it was all about
the names.
"I was reading through the unoffi
cial guide at Stanford and saw the
names "Enchanted Broccoli Forest'

and Synergy,' " De La Cruz said. "I
just thought they were really cool
names so 1 looked them up."
Despite a number of similarities
between all of the co-ops. they each
have individual traits and character
istics that define them around cam
pus. Columbae and Synergy are the
two vegetarian co-ops. and Chi ITieta
Chi is the only one that owns its
house. Because of Synergy's location,
it is often associated with a certain el
ement of separateness that doesn't
come with the other co-ops.
"Synergy is alone on a hill," said
Wood."lt's quieter, and the removed
location makes me feel like I am
going home' more than feeling like I
am still on campus. We have a bigger
garden, and because we are further
away, I think we are able to do more

things on our own than we would if
we were centrally located."
EBF is regarded by many as the
most social and least isolated co-op.
"EBF is more independent so a
variety of people live there," said De
La Cruz. "There are a lot of people
from the Greek system. Because of
our Flappy Flours, we draw a lot of
people that are more social and like
to party."
And Chi Theta Chi's "weird
party" is unlike any event at Stan
ford.
"It's just really weird," said Delisi.
"Everyone transforms their room in
their own special way. There was one
room where they lay sod on the
ground and brought in heaters and
cricket noises and created the atmos
phere of a Southern porch."
