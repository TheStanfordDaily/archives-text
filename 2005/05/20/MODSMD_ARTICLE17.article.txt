# More than just nudity: The co-op life
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
At the top of San Juan street, above
the chaos of the Row.sitsa beautiful New
England-style house. Dried herbs and
flowers hang from hooks in the kitchen,
and the scent of fresh bread fills the
rooms. A few people are seated at wood
en picnic tables, while others lounge on
an enormous trampoline in the center of
the lawn.
With its relaxed atmosphere and
earthy undertones, the setting resembles
something out of a Mark Twain novel.
One would never guess that this house is
home to 55 Stanford students.
In addition to Terra. Columbae, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forrest. Chi ITieta
Chi and Hammarskjold, Synergy is one
of the six cooperative houses on campus.

While these co-ops are still a part of cam
pus life, they have a culture that is very
much their own. Each house has its own
unique style and reputation, but they are
all connected by the common emphasis
on community and self-sufficiency.
"People in co-ops are really into
working together," said senior Shannon
Wood, the resident assistant at Synergy.
"They are into being part of a communi
ty and into taking responsibility for their
actions and the way their actions and be
haviors impact and influence other peo
ple."
Unlike most dorms and houses, many
people draw into co-ops by themselves.
This shifts the emphasis from draw
groups to the house as a whole.
"It's really more of a family than a lot
of other places on campus," said sopho
more Laura Bloomfield. "More people

know what you're doing and what's
going on in your life.That's generally why
people choose to live there."
ITiis concept of community is also
nurtured by the communal effort that is
required to keep up a co-op. Every per
son is expected to help out by doing an
equal share of various chores to keep the
house functioning. With the amount of
cooking, cleaning and organizing that co
ops require, many find living in one com
parable to a five-unit class.
'ITiere is definitely a greater sense of
responsibility," said senior Tony DeLisi, a
manager in Chi Theta Chi. "Because the
residents are in charge of the house,
peers come to you for help on repair is
sues. You also have to do all the cooking
and cleaning."
