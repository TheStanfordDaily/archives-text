La Maison Francaise offer a number
variety of opportunities for Francophiles
to enjoy different aspects of French cul
ture. From a French viticulture class to a
French conversation course, students can
explore French customs up close. The re
vival of the Palo Alto French CineClub
will now offer students and community
members yet another avenue to learn
about the country that produces many
renowned international films.
The club was founded in 1971 by He
lene Laroche, who used to work with
French director Francois Truffaut. She
started the club as a way to respond to a
lack of foreign — and in particular
French — cinema available in the Bay
Area.
CineClub was run for 29 years by
Laßoche before it was handed over to
the organization Inter French, but the
club had to stop its activities in 2004 due
to a lack of committed volunteers who
were available to run it. Then, Inter-
French asked Fabien Cappa to take over
the project's management.

"Starting from scratch, we rebuilt a
minimal volunteer team and proceeded
to put everything back together," Cappa
said. "Lots of time, dedication and faith
was put into this adventure." The
CineClub reopened its doors on May 4.
The CineClub audience consists of a
wide variety of people, mostly from Palo
Alto and surrounding area, interested fn
cultural events. Knowledge of French is
not required.
Ashraf Wahba, Class of 2004, met
Cappa at a francophone gathering last
month, where Cappa explained to him

how he was trying to revive the
CineClub. Wahba liked the idea and of
fered to help him advertise for the club at
Stanford.

"What we wanted ffOffl the'tfeginnirlg
was to create an informal environment

where people can talk about the movie
they just watched," Wahba said. "If we
are having question-and-answer sessions
it will start looking like a lecture, and
many Stanford students will agree with
me when I say that 10 p.m. on Wednesday
is not a good time for lectures."
