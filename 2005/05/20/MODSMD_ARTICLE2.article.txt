# Senior prepares for last hurrah
## Sickler aids evolution of program 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
A lot has changed for the No. 4 Stanford soft
ball team in the past four years. The roster bal
looned from 13 to 20 players, the team reached
the College World Series for the second time in
2(X)4 and the Cardinal claimed their first Pacific
-10 Conference title last week.
"Ihis team has really come a long way in the
four years that the seniors have been involved in
the program," head coach John Rittman said.
"What is unique about this senior class is that
they have been asked to play different positions
and different roles in their four years. They have
done a good job of accepting their roles and they
have contributed a lot to the team's success."
Senior outfielder Meghan Sickler has wit
nessed this evolution since she first arrived on
campus.
"It's been awesome," she said. "I came here
and we were pretty good, and we just got better
and better. The program was already building
when I came and it has become really outstand
ing, bringing in the number-one recruits each
year. Our freshman classes just keep getting bet
ter and better."
Sickler — one of six seniors on a team that
balances youth with experience — has become a
mainstay in the outfield. After playing in every
game as a junior, she has started all but three con
ference games in her senior campaign, the most
successful one of her career.
She has been a dependable presence in the
outfield and a steady contributor to the
Cardinal's offense
"She will do anything we ask of her," Rittman
said. "She has played second base and in the out
field and has been in different places in the hitting
lineup. In the last two years, she has become a very
consistent offensive threat. She has a fantastic arm
out there in right field and above-average range."
Sickler's offensive output has been key for
Stanford this season, as she has come up with big
hits in important situations. She scored the first
run in a 3-0 victory over Arizona State a week
ago, giving the Cardinal their 13th conference vic
tory and a share of the conference title. She hit a
home run to tie the score against UCLA earlier
this month en route to a Cardinal win and had
two RBI in a close victory over Oregon State
