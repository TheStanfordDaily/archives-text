# Senior prepares for last hurrah
## Sickler aids evolution of program 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
A lot has changed for the No. 4 Stanford soft
ball team in the past four years. The roster bal
looned from 13 to 20 players, the team reached
the College World Series for the second time in
2(X)4 and the Cardinal claimed their first Pacific
-10 Conference title last week.
"Ihis team has really come a long way in the
four years that the seniors have been involved in
the program," head coach John Rittman said.
"What is unique about this senior class is that
they have been asked to play different positions
and different roles in their four years. They have
done a good job of accepting their roles and they
have contributed a lot to the team's success."
Senior outfielder Meghan Sickler has wit
nessed this evolution since she first arrived on
campus.
"It's been awesome," she said. "I came here
and we were pretty good, and we just got better
and better. The program was already building
when I came and it has become really outstand
ing, bringing in the number-one recruits each
year. Our freshman classes just keep getting bet
ter and better."
Sickler — one of six seniors on a team that
balances youth with experience — has become a
mainstay in the outfield. After playing in every
game as a junior, she has started all but three con
ference games in her senior campaign, the most
successful one of her career.
She has been a dependable presence in the
outfield and a steady contributor to the
Cardinal's offense
"She will do anything we ask of her," Rittman
said. "She has played second base and in the out
field and has been in different places in the hitting
lineup. In the last two years, she has become a very
consistent offensive threat. She has a fantastic arm
out there in right field and above-average range."
Sickler's offensive output has been key for
Stanford this season, as she has come up with big
hits in important situations. She scored the first
run in a 3-0 victory over Arizona State a week
ago, giving the Cardinal their 13th conference vic
tory and a share of the conference title. She hit a
home run to tie the score against UCLA earlier
this month en route to a Cardinal win and had
two RBI in a close victory over Oregon State
Senior key in clutch

early in the season.
She has been dependable in the
batter's box all season; many of her
33 hits have come in these tight
spots. But then, Sickler is used to
coming through for the team in
stressful situations.
Her timely hitting kept the
Cardinal alive in last year's Women's
College World Series, bringing in the
winning run in consecutive games to
with a

sacrifice double to bring
home junior pinch runner
Shoney Hixson, giving
Stanford the victory in the

single-elimination game. The win
earned the Cardinal a matchup with
hometown favorite Oklahoma that
evening with a spot in the semifinals
on the line.
Stanford trailed by one run in the
sixth inning when a tornado warning
postponed the end of that game.
After a homer by junior shortstop
Lauren Lappin knotted the score
early the next morning, Sickler came
up with the first triple of her career,
plating graduated senior Jacki
Hansen and giving Stanford its sec
ond close victory in as many days.
She hit .500 in those two games with
two RBI. Her batting average for the
postseason was .357, well above her
season average.
The Cardinal will be looking for
her to step up again as they begin
postseason play today. In her final
campaign with Stanford softball,
Sickler is having a banner season,
with a .303 batting average and four
home runs, more than she had in the
past three years combined. In con

ference, she has a perfect fielding
percentage.
"I think all of our kids have the
opportunity to produce in clutch sit
uations," Rittman said. "Last year a
lot of it was and our
team is very prepared because we
are obvk>usty going to be facing
good teams."
When Sickler first picked up a
bat, she never dreamed of taking the
field in the Women's College World
Series in a Stanford uniform.
"I liked the sport a lot and all of
my friends were playing," she said. "I
was invited to join a club team and 1
just stuck with it. In my junior year
and the beginning of senior year 1
was recruited by Stanford from that
club team."
After this season, Sickler — a
two-time second team Pac-10 All-
Academic team member and NFCA
AU-American Scholar-Athlete as a
freshman — will graduate with a
degree in economics and is headed
for graduate school. Sickler said that
the experiences she has had with the
softball team will stay with her long
after she has left the Farm.
"I'll remember the school and the
professors and the things I learned in
class," she said. "But mostly 1 will
remember the friendships and expe
riences I have had with the softball
team."
Sickler's presence and leadership
will be missed when she departs from
what has become a close-knit team.
"Meghan is well-liked among her
teammates and the coaches love
working with her," Rittman said.
"She is the type of kid who goes
about her business every day. She
doesn't say much on the field, but
she leads by example."

"I liked the sport a lot and all of
my friends were playing," she said. "I
was invited to join a club team and 1
just stuck with it. In my junior year
and the beginning of senior year 1
was recruited by Stanford from that
club team."
After this season, Sickler — a
two-time second team Pac-10 All-
Academic team member and NFCA
AU-American Scholar-Athlete as a
freshman — will graduate with a
degree in economics and is headed
for graduate school. Sickler said that
the experiences she has had with the
softball team will stay with her long
after she has left the Farm.
"I'll remember the school and the
professors and the things I learned in
class," she said. "But mostly 1 will
remember the friendships and expe
riences I have had with the softball
team."
Sickler's presence and leadership
will be missed when she departs from
what has become a close-knit team.
"Meghan is well-liked among her
teammates and the coaches love
working with her," Rittman said.
"She is the type of kid who goes
about her business every day. She
doesn't say much on the field, but
she leads by example."
