## Editorial Stanford's land-use deal mostly beneficial 
### 
Palo Alto and Stanford recently an
nounced that they had reached an agree
ment that would allow the University to
develop 300,(MX) square feet of office
space in the Stanford Research Park
("Stanford, Palo Alto reach land-use
deal," May 11). In exchange, Stanford will
construct 250 units of housing on Califor
nia Avenue — at least 50 of which will he
below market rate — and will develop
playing fields at the intersection of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road.
ITie deal is the culmination of five
years of negotiations, and we are encour
aged by the cooperation and compromise
shown by both sides of what is often a
deeply contentious relationship. We were
a bit surprised that it took so long for the
city and the University to reach an agree
ment, but it is a pleasant change to see
them working together to address each
other's needs and concerns.
In the past,disputes — and the accom
panying rhetoric — over University de
velopment have obscured both the bene
fits to Palo Alto residents of having a pres
tigious research university in the vicinity
and the obligations that Stanford has to
the larger community. At the same time,
the back-and-forth between Stanford and
its neighbors has been a useful restraint in
keeping campus development at a rea
sonable pace and scale. For example,
these disputes shaped the current Gener
al Use Plan, or GUP a hefty document
that governs all Stanford development.
Among other things, the GUP requires
Stanford to build accompanying housing

units when creating new research or
teaching facilities.
ITie new deal is a promising one and
appears to have big benefits for both
sides. We hope that Stanford, Palo Alto
and other neighboring cities will follow
this collaborative model in the future.
Not that everything was handled per
fectly. Some Stanford residents complain
that — because they live on unincorpo
rated Santa Clara County land — they
were not notified about the deal, which
could be detrimental to their property
values. Homeowners in Palo Alto say that
the information they did receive was not
clear about the project's impact. And Los
Altos officials claim that they were not
consulted at all — this last complaint
caused the final vote on the deal to be de
layed until this Monday, while officials
meet to discuss potential repercussions
and hurt feelings.
While some of the complaints state
ments about increased traffic — and resi
dents' almost comical foreboding about
the installation of new traffic signals —
smacks of the usual "not in my backyard"
attitude, they represent the real concerns
of people who must make their home in
the area, and the volume of after-the-fact
complaints implies that the plan and its ef
fects were not communicated as widely or
as clearly as they should have been. Hope
fully, Los Altos' concerns can be met with
minimal negotiating. And in future nego
tiations, Stanford and Palo Alto would do
well to remember that their actions do not
take place in a vacuum.
