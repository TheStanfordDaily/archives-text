Senior Gift is a gesture of 'thanks'
As three of this year's seven Senior Gift
co-chairs, we'd like to say thanks for the edi
torial, "Seniors should give to Stanford"
(May IS). The editorial board's assertion
that "the point of the Senior Gift campaign is
to encourage participation among all outgo
ing seniors" was right on target.
Ilowever, there are a few points that we'd
like to add.
For one. we're confident that the class of
2(M)5 will be the first since 2(KK) to reach a 50
percent giving rate in the campaign. Why?
Because our class is the hottest thing to hit
this campus in years.
Also, we were disappointed by the edito
rial board's comparison of the Senior Gift
campaign "to a pyramid scheme," which
seems to suggest that there's a profit motive
built-in. We assure you that none of the co
chairs or participation committee members
profit personally — every cent we raise goes
to The Stanford Fund.
Without The Stanford Fund — which
supports undergraduate financial aid, the
Overseas Studies Program,the six communi
ty centers and Freshman/Sophomore Semi
nars, to name a few — we would not have en
joyed the experiences and opportunities that
have shaped our time at Stanford.
In less than a month, our class will gradu
ate. We realize that we have benefited enor
mously from alumni generosity. We hope our
classmates will join us in a gesture of thanks
to the University and to all those on whose
shoulders we have stood.

Film studies major will not follow film
school model
With regard to The Daily's editorial. "Film
studies major should incorporate produc
tion" (May 17), we would like to clarify sev
eral points.The new major does not intend to
follow a film school curricular model, as we
believe a liberal arts major that includes a
production component builds on Stanford's
strengths in the arts and humanities. As a
program in the Department of Art and Art
History, the B.A. in film and media studies
will provide students with a broad back
ground in cinema history, an understanding
of film criticism and aesthetics, training in
the fundamentals of film and video produc
tion and a grounding in film and media theo
ry. As students pursue their chosen concen-

tration, they will explore the eonnections be
tween moving image media and other disci
plines in the arts and will examine film and
media in the context of cultural, social and
political history.
We are working with alumni and others
as we develop our internship program.
Guest lectures and short workshops led by
visiting specialists in many aspects of film
making will expand on the strengths of res
ident faculty. We anticipate a significant in
crease in the number and variety of screen
ings available to all members of the campus
community and we are delighted that Stan
ford has a strong Film Society to provide
additional opportunities for student film
making. The Stanford Film Society and
Flicks will be valuable partners in many of
our activities, including bringing filmmak
ers to campus to screen and discuss their
work. Our first jointly-sponsored event will
be the upcoming screening of "Sideways"
with director Alexander Payne (Class of
1983), on June 1.

Newsweek retraction is a blow for inde
pendent media
Another nail has been driven into the coffin
of independent media with Newsweek's
buckling to pressure from the White House
to retract its story on the desecration of the
Koran.
vScott McClellan, the White House press
secretary castigated Newsweek stating that
"the report had real consequences. People
have lost their lives. Our image abroad has
been damaged." It is a pity that McClellan
did not warn his boss of the consequences of
waging a disastrous war based on false infor
mation. Mr. McClellan then said
Newsweek's retraction was a "good first
step." Perhaps he could offer similar advice
to President George W. Bush — "Mr. Presi
dent, as a first step to repairing our tarnished
image, please go before the American peo
ple and apologize for the appalling abuse of
prisoners, the unwarranted attack on Iraq
and the death of American servicemen and
Iraqi civilians. Please offer the Iraqis repara
tions for stealing their oil and destroying
their cities."
