## Putting Honor to the Test: a second look at the Honor Code 
### 
In describing the pro
tagonist's neglected wife as
she deals with her hus
band's infidelity in"The Fi
nancier," Theodore Dreis
er wrote, "Hers was not a
soul that ever loved pas
sionately. hence, she could
not suffer passionately."
That novel cannot be
counted among Dreiser's
strongest — nothing at anv

rate could stand beside his magisterial
"American Tragedy" — but that almost
trochaic line sums up the repressed figure of
Mrs. Cowperwood and states a truism about
human emotion.
To the list of human traits that are felt
more than explained one can add — in addi
tion to love — grace, nobility and honor. As
to the Honor Code of this university, stu
dents will feel the galvanizing effects of
"honor" only if its absence or violation is felt
with the same strength. We must know the
lack of honor passionately if we are to culti
vate honor with equivalent passion.
As 1 wrote last week ("Proctor or Clam
bic: Taking the measure of the Honor
Code," May 13), the University's Honor
Code charts a delicate course between lull
policing and no policing. All the while, il
trains its eyes on the end goal of reduced
cheating. Students have the freedom of
take-home exams and the freedom from
faculty oversight, but we are enjoined to be
our own watchdogs and report the devian
cies of our peers.
It is well-attested that Stanford's Honor
Code promotes student responsibility; it
seems also to reduce cheating, though the
studies are necessarily sketchy. The Judicial
Affairs Office, as far as I can tell, approaches
its task with transparency and mental rigor.
A quarter's suspension is the frequent

though not uniform — punishment for vio
lations. As there is no financial or transcript
consequence, such a punishment appears to
be the equivalent of temporary exile. A stu
dent behaves dishonorably and is marginal
ized and thus made to feel the reproach of
the community. Finally, the student is wel
comed back. He or she is expected to have
learned a lesson and found an abler ethical
compass.
The problem with the Honor Code, then,
is one of details. It operates in at least two
problematic ways. First.it serves the function
of helping realize the agreed-upon goals of
reducing plagiarism and cheating. These are
admirable goals,and the 1 lonor Code indeed
helps attain them.
But the goal of reduced cheating did not
predate the goal of cultivating honor. The
latter should not be the handmaid of the for
mer. I am not convinced that the purity of the
Honor Code is undermined through its serv
ice to academic ends,but 1 fear that it may be.
The reason for such fear comes from my
second issue with the Honor Code: It is de
ployed along material, not spiritual, lines.
Consider a student suspended fora quarter.
This student will not, to be sure, lose money
or suffer a reduction in grade point average.
Perhaps, in that 10-week respite, the student
will indeed internalize his or her abrogation
of honor.
But how passionately is that violation re
ally felt? After all, to be suspended fora
quarter is to lose housing and to interrupt the
flow of the year. 1 am not in a position to
make a certain claim, but I suspect that a
quarter's suspension is as painful for its ma
terial losses — absence of friends, unexpect
ed lifestyle rupture — as it is for the essen
tially spiritual challenge of reflection and
self-interrogation.
Is it scarier to know you might be caught
and prosecuted or to know you can get away

with anything? I submit that the latter is, or
ought to be, the more heart-quickening of the
two.
Honor is, if not totally then at least, large
ly about respect for other people. Ultimately,
the practice of honor must grow out of a pas
sionate concern for the well-being of our fel
low travelers and the fairness of the system
within which we study and live.
It may be that many violations of the
Honor Code are acts of desperation, not dis
respect. Still, somewhere along the line we
are compelled — or the University compels
us — to let the goal of higher grades and
completed projects supersede our concern
for other students. A detail — but a funda
mental detail.
Stanford's Honor Code seems to operate
under the assumption that students can be
coaxed into being honorable. One can accept
the foregoing statement insofar as this is an
educational institution and honor must in
some way be learned. To amend my argu
ment from last week, then, it is not coaxing
that is the problem: it is that this coaxing
deals too much with the branches at the ex
pense of the root.
A perfect Honor Code may be beyond
our reach, but it should at least be strived for.
The difference between material fear and
spiritual fear is not, 1 think, an artificial one.
Material fear — the fear of the loss of com
forts or companionship — can get us part
way to honor, perhaps. But the only way
honor can be felt and practiced is to face the
spiritual fear of where the limit to our behav
ior lies. Without the fear of having to check
oneself — indeed, the fear of being honor
able — then "honor" itself is an ultimately
hollow claim.
