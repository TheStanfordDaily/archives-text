# Counting sheep
## Crossing the street has never felt this good 
### 
Sometime between "Be
cause of Winn-Dixie" and
an awkward monologue
from"In Good Company"
—or maybe it was over
"lunch" — I came to an in
triguing revelation: This is
how it feels to fly to college.
I'm also discovering that
like push-ups, writing
columns with vour elbows

drawn into your side is much harder — hut
that's economy class for you.
People always ask me it going to college
across the street from my high school bothers
me. Sitting here on my JFK-bound United
Airlines flight, witli unbearably dry eyes that
I was almost forced to gouge-out during the
aforementioned movies. 1 have to admit that
the answer to this question is a decided "no."
As a disclaimer, though. 1 must also admit
that going to Stanford was the end-all, over
riding aspiration of my entire life. I 'd have to
say that this last tidbit of information carries
much more weight in my preceding answer
than the pain in the small of my back, the suf
focating narrowness of my seat, the discon
certing turbulence, or even airplane food.
Plus, 1 just figured out how to turn down the

fan blowing on my face, sapping all the mois
ture from my eyeballs.
In all seriousness, though, after spending
nearly three quarters on the Farm, 1 can say
without reservation that I am thoroughly
comfortable seeing Paly High's campanile
across El Camino.a perpetual reminder that
I m not having the "quintessential college ex
perience"— I'm having something far bet
ter: the Stanford experience. This has all be
come exceedingly clear to me, as for the first
time since August (when most of my old
friends took off for the East Coast) I am leav
ing Palo Alto behind. I'm just glad Stanford
will be here for me when I get back on Sun
day from my big brother's NYC graduation.
A couple of months ago, Paly's "Verde
Magazine" interviewed me for an article enti
tled "The Other Side of El Camino," depicting
the life of a graduate who made that long trek
across the street. Here's what I told them:
"Honestly, [staying close to home is] a non
issue. It's what you make of it. Right now I
could just as well be on the East Coast.That is,
I don't really go home or visit friends in PA.
It's great to know that they're there, but be
yond that I'm just happy to be at Stanford...
"It's important to note that physical
mileage is not the onlv sort of distance. The

truth is that anywhere you go to college
you're going to get up-rooted and taken out
of your comfort zone. The vast majority of
my friends, and practically all of my close
friends, aren't here at Stanford with me, so I
have all the same opportunities to meet new
people and forge new friendships as my
peers who moved thousands of miles away."
These comments, however, were made
only part way through fall quarter. What's
changed since then is that now I have met
those "new people" and I have forged those
"new friendships" — the best friends I've
ever had. But I'm not going to lie (the arche
typical Stanford qualifying statement) as we
make our descent into JFK. A part of me
can't help but wish I was touching down for
my own far-from-home quintessential col
lege experience, with its brick buildings and
changing seasons. But ultimately, wherever
this ideal college experience is happening
along the Eastern Seaboard, if at all, it isn't
Stanford —and that's the one I've always
wanted — and still do. Plus, I like sandstone
and eternal summer better anvway.
