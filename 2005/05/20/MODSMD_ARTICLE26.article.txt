## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Makin' it better: Stanford football 
### 
It may seem like nothing. It may seem com
pletely contrived. It may seem wholly incon
sequential. However, the contest to deter
mine the face of the student football fan group is
the first great step to increase student participa
tion at football games, and with proper handling
of this and other sensitive issues regarding foot
ball, Stanford could have a program — and fan
support — that we can all be proud of.
As a senior, a class president, a football fan
and having served on the Big Game and Home
coming advisory panels, I have seen the current
state of affairs besieging the football team.
There are a multitude of problems.
First, few students show up for games. Aside
from nationally televised games (vs. USC), the

student-to-other ratio in the
stands is woefully small. With
a total undergraduate enroll
ment that can be adequately
served by one Jamba Juice lo
cation, it will be difficult to
ever rival the student partici
pation at state schools, but it is
possible to do so on a pound
for-pound basis.
Second, the stadium is a

fan-unfriendly venue. This problem, often cited
as a deal-breaker for students considering at
tending games, should be fixed in upcoming
years. Plans are in the works to sink the stadium,
adding seats where the track currently sits idle
and lopping off the uppermost sections, all in an
effort to reduce the space between the field and
the fans. This overhaul is long overdue.
Third, there is a frightening lack of tailgating.
This is the biggest problem here. The stadium
will always "seem empty." The student popula
tion will not increase. However, the lack of a tail
gating culture (save for the few fraternities that
do tailgate, only to get stung with MIPs before
the games) will doom the Cardinal fanbase in
upcoming years.
As a freshman, I dutifully followed my R A to
the first home game, showing off my laminated
nametag to watch Stanford pound Arizona
State for free; the proverbial first cigarette in an
attempt to get me addicted to Stanford football.
However, the misapplied enthusiasm, the dearth
of energy, but most of all, the complete lack of
any sort of culture associated with Stanford stu
dents and the football team ensured that 1 would
not be attending any more games that year.
It is this student-as-fan culture that is missing
from Stanford football. Look at any other na
tional program: Notre Dame, Boston College,
Cal, etc., and you will see a sea of color. At Notre
Dame, every student shows up in the official lep
rechaun green shirt. At Boston College, yellow
"Superfan" shirts dominate the student section.
Even at Cal, the yellow and blue striped Rugby
shirts would make Waldo jealous. And yet at
Stanford, the enthusiasm of freshman dorm ri
valry has been allowed to insidiously seep past
Escondido Road, prompting a myriad of T-shirt
designs, colors and styles at Big Game, resulting
in a student section that would drive the color
blind insane.
The answer is clear: A student-as-fan culture
must be created for football, in the same mold as
the 6th Man Club is for basketball.
However, the way this club is created is cru
cial, and it may take patience, persistence and a
large amount of setup cost. There are particular
steps to address and pitfalls to avoid.
First, there must be tailgating. Football games
should not be considered a study break for the
burned out student.They should be marketed as
all-day affairs and treated as such. Therefore,
don't just hand the students a hot dog and a soda
on their way into games — teach the student
how to fish, as the saying goes. Supply dorms,
clubs and draw groups with tailgating equip
ment. Have charcoal, lighter fluid, burger pat
ties, hot dog franks and soda behind the stadium,
but make the students cook it themselves on
grills paid for by Stanford. Create the culture by
planting the seeds.
Second, ease up on the alcohol citations. I re
alize that we are all subject to federal law, but I
cannot understand how a 19-year-old drinking a
beer is cause for concern, considering he is about
to spend three hours in a "dry" stadium. Just as
San Francisco cops look the other way as Bay to
Breakers "racers" parade keg after keg through
the city, Stanford cops can let a couple juniors
split a Bud Light.
Finally, leave dorm pride at Escondido Road.
You never hear "Branner Sucks!" at basketball
games and for good reason: Oregon State could
n't care less. Therefore, the dorm shirts need to
go — and a general Stanford fan shirt needs to
surface.This was my major cause during the Big
Game meetings, and I was happy to produce a
simple T-shirt for the game. It didn't make some
not-really-clever pun. It didn't have fancy writ
ing. It didn't reference genitalia.
You have probably seen it. It was just a Car
dinal T-shirt with a giant, white "S" on the front
and "BEAT CAL" on the back.
It was simple, to the point and cheap to make.
So Coach Harris, as you pore over T-shirt
submissions in the contest to determine the
artist for the football fan club's shirt, may I offer
one more design to the mix? My only stipula
tions are that it is available for five dollars or less
in the bookstore (free with student tickets) and
that a request is made to residences to cease
making dorm shirts.
My design is the same as it has always been:
just a Cardinal T-shirt with a giant, white "S" on
the front and "BEAT CAL" on the back.
Go Stanford.

next year. E-mail him at porters@stanford.edu.
