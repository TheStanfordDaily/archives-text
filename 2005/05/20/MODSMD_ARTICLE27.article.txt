# Sextet runs and draws together

### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For six sophomores on the men's track
and field team, the future is full of possibili
ties. Not only did they receive number one
in the undergraduate housing Draw, but
have also proven that they will be forces to
reckon with on the track.
Five of the sophomores — Kevin Bick
ham, Russell Brown, Mike Garcia, Lauren
Jespersen and Forrest Tahdooahnippah —
redshirted their freshmen outdoor track
seasons and are eligible fora fifth year. The
sixth member of the luckiest draw group on
campus, Joaquin Chapa, ran outdoor track
last year.
Bickham, Brown, Chapa, Jespersen and
Tahdooahnippah live together in Suites,
which means that they see a lot of each
other.
"That's why we need our own rooms no
matter what," Tahdooahnippah said.
Tahdooahnippah, a distance runner from
St. Paul, Minn., who finished fourth last year
in the 10,000-meter run at the U.S. Junior
Nationals, said that there is some tension
caused by living with his teammates. But
there was a consensus that the tension — es
pecially between Chapa, Brown and Jes
persen, who all run the 800-meter — is ben
eficial.
"It's a lot of macho chest pounding,"Tah
dooahnippah said. "Sometimes people call
it a hissy match, where Joaquin goes out
there and runs 4:04, [then] the next weekend
Russell's got to go out there and run 4:03.
And then Lauren goes out there on the last
weekend — he saves it to the end — and
runs 4:02, and then no one else has the
chance to run it. But it's good because the
tension keeps up the competitive spirit, and
that allows them to take it to the next level."
Chapa, who hails from Portland, Ore.,
finished seventh in the 800-meter run last
year at the Pacific-10 Conference outdoor

track and field meet. Chapa was also a final
ist at the NCAA West Regional Champi
onships and ran a personal-best 800 time of
1:49.83 at the 2004 Payton Jordan U.S.
Open.
Jespersen, a middle-distance runner
from Klamath Falls, Ore., finished fifth in
the 800 at last year's Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Indoor Championships.
"My biggest accomplishment has been
running a four-minute mile and qualifying
for Indoor Nationals as an individual," Jes

persen said.
Brown, also a middle-distance runner,
from Hanover. N.H.,competed in the 1,500-
meter run on the U.S. team at the IAAF
World Junior Championships last year.
Bickham, a middle-distance runner from
Oceanside, Calif., has suffered injuries since
coming to the Farm, but has the potential to
be a huge contributor for the Cardinal.
Meanwhile, Mike Garcia, who lives in
Sigma Nu, finished fifth in the 800 at the U.S.
Junior National Championships and ran a

personal best of 1:50.35 in the 800 at last
year's Payton Jordan U.S. Open. The mid
dle-distance runner from Santa Fe, N.M.,
will join his draw group next year when they
move into Jerry, formerly known as Lambda
Nu.
The draw group formed in part due to the
fact that Cardinal runners traditionally live
together.
"We never really sat down and made a

all run for the track and field team and will live together in Jerry next year.
