## Rais wins Omnium 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford cycling team gave longtime
and outgoing head coach Art Walker a few
more lasting memories at the 2005 Road Na
tionals in Lawrence, Kan., last weekend. Nine
Stanford riders competed against more than
500 of the nation's best and returned to the
Farm with a third-place team finish and an in
dividual national champion.
Colorado won the team title with 446 points
and California took second with 410 points.
Stanford finished with 391 points.
"It really was an awesome team perform
ance," said doctoral student David Pierce. "We
really preformed well in the mass start events
and it was great for team morale."
Master's student Amber Rais, who won the
National Omnium title, agreed.
"The team's performance this year has
been extraordinary on the whole," said Rais,
who also won the Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference Women's A Omnium this year.
"Everyone on this team contributed to making
this season one of the best in recent history for
Stanford. Those of us at Nationals knew that
we had a responsibility to maintain the high
standard our team had set from the beginning
of the season."
All of Stanford's riders in Lawrence did.
In addition to Rais, Stanford's Sheela
Singla placed 45th and Ashley Fouts bounced
back from a crash to race in the team time
trial for the women. The men were led by
Pierce, who placed seventh in the men's Na
tional Omnium. Scott Giles and senior Chris
Montague-Breakwell, finished 20th and 34th,
respectively.
Rais said her success this season stemmed
from a decision she made at the end of last year
to dedicate herself more fully to the sport.
"My performance last year at Nationals left
a lot of room for improvement, and after being
inspired by the intense competition there, I de
cided to focus more seriously for this season,"
Rais said. "This year has been my only full sea
son of collegiate racing, and I won't be racing
collegiate next year. I couldn't have asked for
a better way to end the season."
Pouring rain created slick conditions for
Friday's women's criterium. but Rais avoided
several crashes during the 3-lap ride through
downtown Lawrence and came-from-behind
to take home first-place honors.
"In the final sprint, Rebecca Larson from
Florida was the only rider ahead of me, and I
focused everything on sprinting past her for
the line," Rais said.'i couldn't believe that I'd
won, and I couldn't stop smiling."
Rais placed fourth in Saturday's road race
to edge out Indiana's Jessica Lindemann for
