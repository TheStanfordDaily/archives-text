# Warburg nears end of stellar career
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
One week before he played in the ITA Re
gional during the fall of his junior year, Sam
Warburg was really sick. Not to mention fa
tigued â€” the week before that, the Sacramento
native had played a tournament in Tennessee.
But Warburg traveled to the ITA Regionals in
Eugene, Ore., and proceeded to play five
matches within the span of 24 hours.
Warburg played two singles matches and a
doubles match on one day and another singles
match on the next day. During the second sin
gles match of the second day, Warburg began to
feel dizzy, and Washington's former assistant
coach caught the senior as he collapsed. War
burg had a virus that attacked the lining of his
heart, and he remained hospitalized in Oregon
fora couple days before returning to Stanford.
The doctors were not sure if Warburg would
ever be able to play again.
"My body was struggling a little bit," War
burg said. "I guess it said, 'Hey, slow down. You
need to be more careful about what's going
on.'"
Warburg was not allowed to do any physical
activity for the rest of the quarter, much less
play tennis competitively.
"It was weird not being able to do anything,"
Warburg said. "Going from working out every
day to doing nothing, I was so tired all the time."
The time off was a huge change for Warburg,
who has been actively involved in sports since a
young age. He began playing tennis with his par
ents around the age of six but played numerous
sports through elementary school. Warburg fi
nally settled on tennis around the age of 11 be
cause he preferred the individual aspect of ten
nis.
Warburg occasionally played tennis matches
for his high school team but focused more of his
attention on tournaments that were held out
side of school. Unlike football and basketball,
much of the recruiting for college tennis takes
place at these tournaments. The dedication and
effort that Warburg devoted paid off, and when
the time came to decide on a college, he was
considering Duke, UCLA, Harvard and North
western, in addition to Stanford.
After being accepted by the Cardinal, the de
cision was easy for Warburg.
"The opportunity to get a degree from a
school like this was the number one drawing
factor," he said. "I just wanted to be able to play
tennis for [former] Coach [Dick] Gould. [They
were] just two things I couldn't pass up. Grow
ing up in Northern California and following col
lege sports a little bit, this is the place I've al
ways wanted to go."
In addition to his Pacific-10 Conference ti-
