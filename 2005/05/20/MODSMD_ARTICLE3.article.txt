# High ceiling hurler:
## Reynolds' talent shows on mound 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore pitcher Greg Reynolds has heard a
lot about his potential over the last few years.
Scouts have been salivating over the 6-foot-7,230-
pound righthander since his prep school days at
nearby Terra Nova High in Pacifica. His high ceil
ing led the Philadelphia Phillies to take a flyer on
him in the 41st round of the 2003 first-year draft,
though players who have committed to Stanford
rarely take the chance to go pro.
Reynolds declined the Phillies' offer in order to
come to the Farm, where Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess recognized Reynolds' promise
early on, grooming him to be a starting pitcher at
the end of his freshman season.
Talent is one thing that the big righty with a low
90's fastball has never lacked.
For Reynolds, it has simply been a matter of put
ting it all together. After one and a half streaky sea
sons at Stanford, he is starting to do just that. He
had his most commanding outing of the year on
TUesday, throwing four scoreless innings and strik
ing out five in a start against St. Mary's to pick up
his first win of the season.
Reynolds seemed poised fora big year when he
opened the season as the team's Sunday afternoon
starter, but he struggled in that role, allowing a
combined seven earned runs over 5 1/3 innings in
his first two starts. He was pulled from the rotation,
a move that triggered a revolving door of Sunday
starters. The spot would eventually be filled by
sophomore Matt Leva.
Righty recovered
from tendonitis

Marquess was banking on the potential he had seen in
Reynolds when he handed him the ball on the first
Sunday of the season. Last season, in his freshman year,
Reynolds had recovered from elbow tendonitis to finish
4-1 in five late-year starts, despite a 6.(K) ERA. He did not
fully recover from the tendonitis until his stint in the Cape
Cod League last summer. He strengthened his arm with a
regiment of long-toss and weight-lifting and posted a 2.27
ERA, striking out 31 batters in 39 2/3 innings and holding
opponents to a meager . 187 batting average.
But, for whatever reason, that performance did not
translate onto the field at the beginning of this season.
"It really wasn't there for me," Reynolds said.
He had a few uneven outings in relief, often showing
Hashes of the stuff that has tantalized scouts but failing to
perform well on a consistent basis. In one game against
Oregon State in early April. Reynolds pitched 2 2/3 innings
in relief and struck out four batters, but also allowed four
runs on five hits. He was striking out hitters at a ratio of one
per inning, good for third on the team, but he struggled to
find consistency. Sometimes he had trouble finding the
plate, and sometimes he was simply getting hit.
"I think consistency has been my problem all year,"
Reynolds said. "There were some things I was doing [early
on] that would cut my outings a little short."
In a contest against Arizona State a week later, which
may have been the low point of his season, Reynolds came
on in relief of Leva and struggled to find the plate, walking
three batters and allowing five runs to take the loss.
Ihat's when he discovered one element that had been
missing.
"A lot of times. I would come out of the bullpen and try
to concentrate more on two or three pitches, and I didn't
realize how effective the changeup was earlier in the sea
son," he said.
Since the Arizona State game, he has made six appear
ances, posting a 2.37 ERA in 15 2/3 innings to lower his
season ERA to 5.73. He has 15 strikeouts over that span, but
more importantly he has only walked two batters, a sign that
his command is improving. Reynolds has also worked his
way back into the rotation, starting the Cardinal's last two
TUesday games.
Reynolds knows that he has a lot of potential, but he is
also very aware that in this sport, nothing comes easy.
"It's something that I don't really pay attention to. but
I know in the back of my mind that 1 can be as good as I
want to be as long as 1 work hard enough," he said.
"Obviously I think I can live up to the things that people
are saying. It's just a matter of time before I start figuring
everything out."
Reynolds also knows that the dream of playing profes
sional baseball is not something you can depend too heavi
ly upon. That's why he turned down the Phillies for the
Farm.
"It's been a lifelong dream of mine to play professional
baseball, and that was right in front of me my senior year,"
he said."But after talking it over with my parents, and mak
ing sure that I had something to fall back on, [I realized that]
an education at Stanford would take me a long way."
