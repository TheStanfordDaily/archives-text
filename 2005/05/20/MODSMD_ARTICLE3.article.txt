# High ceiling hurler:
## Reynolds' talent shows on mound 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore pitcher Greg Reynolds has heard a
lot about his potential over the last few years.
Scouts have been salivating over the 6-foot-7,230-
pound righthander since his prep school days at
nearby Terra Nova High in Pacifica. His high ceil
ing led the Philadelphia Phillies to take a flyer on
him in the 41st round of the 2003 first-year draft,
though players who have committed to Stanford
rarely take the chance to go pro.
Reynolds declined the Phillies' offer in order to
come to the Farm, where Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess recognized Reynolds' promise
early on, grooming him to be a starting pitcher at
the end of his freshman season.
Talent is one thing that the big righty with a low
90's fastball has never lacked.
For Reynolds, it has simply been a matter of put
ting it all together. After one and a half streaky sea
sons at Stanford, he is starting to do just that. He
had his most commanding outing of the year on
TUesday, throwing four scoreless innings and strik
ing out five in a start against St. Mary's to pick up
his first win of the season.
Reynolds seemed poised fora big year when he
opened the season as the team's Sunday afternoon
starter, but he struggled in that role, allowing a
combined seven earned runs over 5 1/3 innings in
his first two starts. He was pulled from the rotation,
a move that triggered a revolving door of Sunday
starters. The spot would eventually be filled by
sophomore Matt Leva.
