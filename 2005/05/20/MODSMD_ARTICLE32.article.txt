ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (As
sociated Press) â€” One of Orlando
Romero's calves has a leg up on the
other 25 calves born within the last
two weeks on his ranch east of Tu
cumcari. The calf was born with an
extra leg, with two hooves, growing
from its back.
Ranchers in the area aren't quite
sure what to make of the little Lim
ousin heifer. That is, if they can
catch her.
"She moves like a damn deer. I
had a heck of a time trying to catch
her," said Jess Weaks, the ranch
caretaker. "She's pretty ornery,
that's for sure."
The week-old calf's extra leg
does not touch the ground. It is at
tached to the calf's back between the
shoulder blades, and hangs to its
right side.
The branch-like growth is the
only major difference between the
copper-colored calf and the rest of
the herd, said Shane Jennings, a

neighbor who first spotted the
heifer.
"It's just cosmetic. She's out
there in the pasture right now, like
any other cow. The little booger's
doing good. It's in real good health,"
Jennings said.
Jennings was in the field checking
on yearlings last week when he saw
that one cow was close to giving
birth. He left to tend to other work,
and when he returned he saw the
cow with her new calf.
But he was startled by what he
saw when he approached the hours
old calf.
"I thought, 'What in the world is
that?' and as I got a closer look and
saw the extra leg I said Oh boy,
what am I gonna come up with
next?"'Jennings said.
Jennings said he's seen deformi
ties in calves before and that Tucum
cari's ranch supply store used to
have a stuffed two-headed, stillborn
calf.
