# Brief interviews with Tim Lipus, Asshole
## 
### TIM LIPUS ASSHOLE 
Friday night, Tim Lipus, Asshole, went to a party for an
other round of interviews. The occasion was Durandom
Hookup, so you can probably guess where this is going...
TlyV; Hi, I have some questions for you for the newspaper.
Blonde Girl in Green Shirt: Okay.
TL,A: How many minutes do you think it will be be
fore you hook up with this guy you're with?
BGGS: Been there, done that. It's in the past, so like,
negative minutes.
TL,A: You just hooked up with him five minutes ago?
BGGS: No, I mean like two years ago.
TL,A: Oh, that's awesome. So I guess it's going to be
really awkward if I hook up with you tonight. Is that
going to cause problems?
Male Companion of BGGS: She's one of my best
friends, I wouldn't mind at all.
TL,A: [To BGGS] You hear that, baby? You and me.
BGGS: I feel like he just has overstepped some lines as
a "best friend."
TL,A: Oh I'll overstep some lines — or maybe I al
ready have?
BGGS: What are you recording this for?
TL,A: Oh, it's just going to be printed for thousands of
people to see.
BGGS: That's fine.
TL,A: What's your full name and phone number? For
journalistic purposes.
BGGS: [Gives name, which Tim Lipus, Asshole, later
found out was not her real name but rather the name of
one of her friends]
TL,A: And what's your phone number?
BGGS: Um, I forgot my phone number.
TL,A: I forgot my phone number, too. Can I have
yours?[Awkward forced laughter]
After striking out once, Tim Lipus, Asshole, was
stopped by three Drunk Durand Girls.
DDGI: Hey Tim Lipus, Asshole, interview us.
Okay. Will you hook up with me tonight?
DDG 2: You've already done that. That's like what
you ask girls every single week.
Tlv\: In my defense, this is Durandom Hookup, so it
makes sense that my questions should relate to hooking up.
DDG 3: Fine, but at least be slightly original.
DDG 2: Yeah, ask us if all three of as will hook up with you.

TL,A: Okay. Will you?
DDGI: No.
DDG 2: No.
DDG 3: No.
Fresh off Strike Two (or Two, Three and Four, if you 're
really counting), Tim Lipus, Asshole, wandered around
until he ran into a Considerably Tipsy Asian Girl:
TL,A: Hey, how's it going?
CTAG: I'm really drunk.
TL,A: Here, let me help you. [Takes beer]
CTAG: Thanks.
TL,A: Have some more. [Pretends to pour beer on her]
CTAG: Hey.
TL,A: Uh-oh, I'm going to — [actually pours beer on
her]. Oh fuck. I did not mean to do that.
CTAG: My shirt!
TL,A: Wow, I am an asshole.
After pondering his lack of success at Durandom
Hookup, Tim Lipus, Asshole, decided that he needed a
new pick-up line. A few nights later, he went out to give
it a shot.
TL,A: 1 notice you're not wearing any clothes.
Girl Who Was, In Fact, Wearing Clothes: [Confused
and slightly annoyed glare]
TL,A: Oh, I'm sorry, my watch is an hour fast!
GWWIFWC: [Annoyed glare]
TL, A: Get it? Get it? Do you get it?
GWWIFWC: Good one.
TL,A: I 'm implying that in an hour ...
GWWIFWC: Right, 1 get it.
Friend of TL,A (Trying to help): Tim is single.
GWWIFWC: I'm shocked.
After that practice round, Tim Lipus attempted to
continue being an Asshole, but just wound up confused.
TL,A: I notice you're not wearing any clothes.
Another Girl Who Was, In Fact, Wearing Clothes: I'm
not! Do you want to take a picture? You can post it on
the Internet and make some money.
TL,A: Uhh ... that's not really how it goes.
AGWWIFWC: Oh, do I need to take off more clothes?
TL*A: Yeah, I think so.
AGWWIFWC: [Starts to unbutton pants in public lo
cation] Ok, now do you want to take a picture?
TL*A: Um, I don't really have a camera.
AGWWIFWC: Go ahead, take it. [Long pause]
TL: My watch is an hour fast?
