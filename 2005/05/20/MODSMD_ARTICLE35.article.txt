# Are you (too) cool?
## Stanford students get caught on film! 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION MALTIN-WANNABES 
Want to support Stanford artists but just can't get
over your dual phobias of Shakespeare and a cappella?

Well, the Stanford Film Society has just the thing for you:
"Too Cool For School: The 2(X)5 Stanford Student Film Festi
val," a three-day extravaganza of filmed dramas, comedies, car
toons and the truly bizarre and artsy. You may (or may not) have
missed last night's opening festivities — which included a mysteri
ous anthropomorphic snowflake, a chick chasing a blue rubber
ball, and some truly awful fake facial hair, among other things -
but you can still support your fellow students (and Final Cut Pro)

at 7:30 p.m. tonight and tomorrow at Cubberley Auditorium.
Intermission, in all its glory, has taken the liberty to
let you know what's in store for you at the SFS Fest

through capsule reviews of all the films (that had ac-

tually been edited by Monday). In any case, go
to the show or Lindsay Mecca will hunt

you down and roast you on a spit.
We're not kidding.
