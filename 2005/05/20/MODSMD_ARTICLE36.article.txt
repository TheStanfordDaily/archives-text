"A Monstrous Affair"
Dir.: Mark Lieber
Starring: Some Pretty Wicked Awe
some Animation
Runtime: 1 min.

This adorable animated short is

about underwear, infidelity and mon
sters. Awesome. Enough said.

"Ignite Innovations: Bright Light for
Rural India"

Dirs.: Scott Cannon. Ginger Turner
Runtime: 15 min.

Have you ever seen a flyer around

campus fora course in social entrepreneurship,
or received emails for the BASES e-challenge.

and thought, "WIT, mate?" Ponder no more. "Ig-

nite Innovations," a documentary about Stanford
B-school and engineering students on their quest to
bring a marketable replacement for dirty kerosene
to rural India, will shed some light on exactly what
it means to be a social entrepreneur.

"Girl and a Gun"

Dirs.: Anthony Ha and Chris Lee
Starring: Max Doty, Ben Dudek. Melissa

Fusco, and Jenny Xiang
Runtime: 8 min.

An assassin, her gun and two goons
are on the loose on the streets of San Fran-

Cisco, looking for their French-speaking
mark. (Why is it always the French?) Bad

guys bantering and obsessing over intra
goon drama seems much more salient

than actually doing the dirty deed. As a
bonus, there's one of those keep-

doing-it-till-it's-unfunny-and-then
funny-again moments that "Family

Guy" loves ever so much.
"The Motel Office"
Dir.: Matt Dyer
Runtime: 9 min.
Starring Matt Turnbull as the gay son of a less
than understanding father, "The Motel Office" is
pure drama. Spending a final, silent evening with his
father in a Palo Alto motel room after what seems like
it must have been a loooonnng roadtrip, Turnbull's
character prepares for his first year of college by
spending the night with the boy behind the lobby
desk. Cue tension.
"Restless Carouse"
Dir.: Andrew Keaveney
Starring: Andrew Keaveney
Runtime: 6 min.
Personifying restlessness, Keaverney plays the
aforementioned carouse, though he's not much of a
carouse at all, if carouse means "to drink and become
noisy" as Microsoft Word says it does. I'll just go ahead
and the wordless Keaverney is in fact intoxicated on
restlessness. He busies himself taking a constitutional,
attempting to climb a tree and inspect the Caltrain sta
tion. An unsettling piano score backs the supremely ef
fective imagery.
"Sunny Day"
Dirs.: Emmett Hopkins, Soo-Rae Hong
Runtime: 1.5 minute
It's hard to pack a lot of humor into 90 seconds, but
Hong / Hopkins' highly entertaining "Sunny Day" suc
ceeds. A jerky Play-Doh-mation set to MIDI ragtime
and starring a bunny, a snake, a caveman and a boulder,
"Sunny Day" has a crowd-pleasing ending that leaves
everyone but the reptile happy.
