"Four Walls"
Dir.: Anna Puigdollers
Starring: Florencia Lagos
Runtime: 7.5 min.
This beautiful, artistic film follows our lovely, silent
heroine on what seems to be a terrible, horrible, no
good, very bad day. This poor girl is, after a colorful
opening sequence, stuck in her cramped, cluttered
apartment and in black and white. The phone frightens
her. Will she be able to emancipate herself from her
self-imposed imprisonment? "Four Walls" features el
egant images of light and shadows that call to mind the
best of film noir.
"Cubed"
Dir.: Steven Lehrburger
Starring: Sean Kendall and Lance Krieger
Runtime: 7 min.
Your average female Grove Mayfield resident gets
all haughty and dumps her benevolent boyfriend
(Kendall) in exchange fora malicious asshole
(Krieger). [Editor's note: Why must Stanford girls be
like that?] Deciding to do something constructive to
get over his pain, Kendall turns to a Rubik's Cube for
guidance. An arty final shot ensues.

"The Fruit Thief'
Dirs.: Hermione Giffard and James Pierson
Starring: Whitney Gaynor and Chris Ryan
Runtime: 15 min.
An intense relationship blossoms only to wilt in
"The Fruit Thief," a film depicting the intense feelings
only artists seem to have for one another. A poet who
insists upon reciting her emotions through soliloquy is

taken in by a crunchy photographer
who has a thing for Rodin and is all

about imitating Gregory Peck at
Rome's fabled Mouth of Truth. It seems
too good to be true. Is it? Hell yeah, it is!

"Pitch Blending"
Dir.: Natasha Chen
Runtime: 15 min.

"Pitch Blending," about a fictional cam
pus a cappella group called Melodia, is the

year's requisite mockumentary. While listen
ing to tryouts and deciding on new members,
the group's director (a stressed-out Fahad Al-
Saud) also copes with relationship woes.

"Wet Dream"
Dir.: Elizabeth Ozar
Runtime: 1.5 min.

There's no nudity in Ozar's "Wet Dream", but the
short doesn't leave much to imagination. Combine a
minute of close-ups on sweaty bodies and panting lips
with a metaphoric — but hardly ambiguous — parting
shot, and you've got a minute-and-a-half of pleasure.

"Flatfish"
Dir.: Steven Tagle
Runtime: 7.5 min

Tagle directs a coming-of-age story about
two friends who express themselves through
sock puppets. Sean Howell and Nick Farrell
play the friends; two ugly dress socks play the ,

puppets.
