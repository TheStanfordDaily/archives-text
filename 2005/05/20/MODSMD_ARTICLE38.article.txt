## The 						Best Restaurants You Haven't Heard of... 
### ANN CHIN INTERMISSION FOOD EXPLORER 
Applewood Pizza:
Menlo Park's Applewood Pizza on El
Camino seems to be loved by every
one except Stanford students. The
casual atmosphere and well-stocked
bar (lots of German beers) make it a
popular place for anything from dates
to business meetings. If you like thick
crust that's crispy on the outside and
soft on the inside (and think Pizza
Chicago is overrated), Applewood
offers some creative, decently priced
alternatives. I suggest the Milano
with spinach and portobello mush
rooms. (The Scandinavian with
smoked salmon and dill sounds
more interesting than it tastes.)
1001 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, CA

Mediterranean Wraps:
Though the prices at Mediterranean
Wraps on California Ave are a bit
high for the informal atmosphere
and cramped seating, the food is
pretty good. You yell your order over
the counter and sort of watch them
make it. If you don't have a lot of
time and want something other than
fast food, these chicken, lamb or
beef wraps will fill you up for about
$6-7. There are also combo plates
with the usual hummus, falafel,
tabouleh and baba ghannoush, but
you can order those items on the
side, too.

Palo Alto, CA 94306

El Grullense:
For Mexican food that's more au
thentic than Celia's or Compadres
(which don't even qualify as Tex
Mex), head to El Grullense on El
Camino — ironically located next to
Taco Bell. Adventurous eaters will
love the authentic menu items like
tacos with brain, tripe or tongue. On
Saturday or Sunday, there is
menudo, a traditional Mexican beef
stew eaten for brunch on weekends.
It's absolutely worth a try. And if
you're not won over by the food, you
can always retreat to that Taco Bell
next door
1527 Alum Rock Ave., San Jose

Shanghai Taste Delight:
This is seriously the best, most au
thentic Chinese restaurant around
Stanford. It's a cozy family-run place,
but rfs hard to find because it's in a
tiny shopping center on El Camino
right before the Castro St. intersec
tion in Mountain View. The menu is
loaded with reasonably priced home
style foods that you'll never find at
Ming's or Windy's, and the owners
will gladly make suggestions if you're
not familiar with the menu items. I
highly recommend their deliciously
juicy Shanghai steam dumplings
(also known as soup dumplings), the
wide variety of hot pot soups and the
sauteed rice cakes.

Sushi Tomi:
This is the freshest and best-priced
sushi place in the area. If you want
better food than Miyake but can't af
ford Fuki-Sushi, check out Sushi
Tomi in downtown Mountain View a
few blocks off Castro Street. If you've
tried sushi before and decided you
didn't like it, this place might change
your mind. The chirashi bowls are
delicious and cost-effective for real
sashimi lovers, and there's a large
selection of fresh individual sushi
and combination dinners.
