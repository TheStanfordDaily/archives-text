# Stanford Shakespeare: The play's the thing
## 
### MERRITT BAER INTERMISSION THEATRE CRITIC 
It's common knowledge that the Shake
speare Society does Shakespeare, and they
do it well. Their productions usually in
v volvegender-bending, intense sexuality,
ft and unique locations, all of whichlur
ther their excellent productions.

However, all theatre companieshave
their limits, and unfortunately,
"Hamlet," the epicShakespearean
tragedy is just beyond that point.
Let's start with the location — the

Cantor Arts Center. Agorgeous two
tiered set, a voluptuous stairwell and
vast amounts ofspace, all under a
moon-lit sky. All in all, everything was
beautiful. The minimalist use of other

set pieces (a single redcarpet and a
wooden bench) contrasts nicely with
the grandioselandscape. However,
the immense spaciousness creates the

challenge ofmaking the production still
feel intimate.
Jonathan Palley and Amy Leblang's

lighting is attractive andwell-conceived, taking its
cue from the lush architecture andhighlighting its
nuanced faAade. Regrettably, the costumes

were notso well-conceived, and seemed cartoon
ish at best. While some of thedesigns drew on the
style of Mad Max — edgy and dark — others
seemedoverly finished. All the costumes (less
one jacket worn by the ghostand Hamlet) were
black and white; this is probably what I found
moststrange. In a play in which ambiguity plays
such a central role, theopposing black and white
seemed out of place. It is, however, obviousthat a
lot of time went into the costumes, as each one
waswell-tailored and beautiful.
Leading the team of players was Christo
pher Denton, whoseliamlet is both fiery and
intense. Dentin shines in this an incrediblydiffi
cult role, toeing the line between confusion, re
sentment.despair, and passion. Yana Kesala (a
ravishing Ophelia) nailed hermost dramatic
moments-painting a wild portrait of despon
dency andinsanity. Her "crazy" scene was easi
ly one of the highlights of theplay, and scored
incredibly well with an audience who sat in the
rainto enjoy such a delicious performance. Ma
lika Williams also foundintensity in Gertrude's
multifaceted role, tortured with lust andbetray
al.Other highlights included Fabrice Palumbo-
Liu's hysterical Polonius.Amanda Felson's fe
male Rosencrantz, and Gabriel Bombara's
hauntingghost. In such a deep and epic play as
Hamlet, it's easy to get lostin the convoluted di

alogue or soliloquies. And yet, in the hands
ofthese able players, Shakespeare's iambic
pentameter seemed as naturalas Stanford
slang.
But beautiful performances aside, the pro
duction lacked thedriving visual force normally
associated with productions by Stanford-
Shakes. I found myself wondering throughout
the play what hadhappened to the flair I re
membered form productions of "Romeo and-
Juliet," "Othello" and "Is This Seat Taken?"
Aside from an Oedipalkiss and gender-re
versed Rosencrantz, there's little trace ofdirec
tor Ed Sylvanus Iskandar's customary shock
value.With the wide-open space of Cantor
Arts, it feels like the stage ismassively under
used — the intimacy of Shakespeare's metre is
drownedat times by a lack of focus and an abun
dance of space
But as Hamlet proclaims, "the play's the
thing," and it sureis a glorious play. Full of wit,
beauty, betrayal, woe, and majesty,"Hamlet" is
as exquisite as ever. The role of Hamlet is de
lined byambiguity — a rainbow of grays, each
hue more intense than the last.While the pro
duction itself does have intense moments, it too
is arainbow of grays.Hamlet, produced by The
Stanford Shakespeare Society, plays at the
Cantor Arts Center May 18 to 21 at 8:30 p.m.
