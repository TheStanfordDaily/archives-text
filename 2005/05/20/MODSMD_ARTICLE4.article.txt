# Softball hits Regionals
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
After capturing a share of the Pacific-10 Conference title last Saturday, the No. 4
Stanford softball team gathered Sunday evening to hear the announcement of the
2005 NCAA Tournament Regional sites and seeds.
Though Stanford made a bid to host one of the 16 Regionals and head

coach John Rittman said his team deserved to host, the selection committee
passed on Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium in favor of University Field in
Colombia, Mo. Should the Cardinal be fazed tonight by the 1,000-mile trip?
Not at all. Though the sixth-seeded Cardinal played well at home (22-7),

they also fared well on the road (12-6). Stanford will take on the Robert Morris
Colonials, who are making their first ever NCAA appearance after winning the
Northeast Conference.
As long as the Cardinal stick to their mantra of not looking past the next

game, their confidence level heading into today's 6 p.m. start should be high.
Stanford is making its eighth consecutive NCAA postseason appearance.
The squad has six seniors and eight other returning players from last
year's Women's College World Series team.

"Being at the World Series helped having experience," senior first
baseman Elizabeth Bendig said. "Having a lot of returners is helpful.
We have six freshman; we're a young team. The veterans can help

get them though it."
Stanford is, however, the only squad in its bracket to have
' to travel so far. In addition to the Colonials, No. 16 Missouri (42-
\ 13) and No. 22 Southern Illinois (46-12) play in the Regional.

But the Cardinal are coming from one of the best confer
ences in the nation. With all eight teams from the Pac-10
(four of which tied for first place) making it to the postsea
l son, Stanford was tested on a regular basis throughout the

conference season.

"1 think the experience factor is
huge," Rittman said. "Our freshman
have all played Pac-10 softball fora
year, so they've seen the best soft-

ball has to offer."
The Colonials may look like a threat on paper,
with a .300 team batting average against Stanford's
.2% mark, but that stat is bolstered by the team's
heavy hitter, Keri Meyer, who leads the squad with
a .425 average. Meyer — named the NEC's Player
of the Year — is accompanied by Jill Spargo and
Kali Byers, who both boast hot bats. Byers is a
threat with runners on base, with 51 RBI on the sea
son.
Though the Cardinal have never seen Robert
Morris in action, the team is approaching today's
game like any other.
"Pretty much at this point in the season we're
going to treat any team like it's the best," freshman
pitcher Becky McCullough said.
Rittman agreed.
"The biggest thing we can't do is play name
game in the postseason. You've got to respect your
opponent because they're there and because they're
a good team, and everybody's capable of beating
anyone on any given day. You don't get many
chances in the postseason — you've got to come to
play everyday."
NEC Pitcher of the Year Danielle Cohen will
likely get the start tonight. Cohen (14-5,1.37 ERA)
will face some of the best players in the West in
Stanford freshman Michelle Smith, juniors Catalina
Morris and Lauren Lappin and senior Leah Nelson.
The Cardinal offense lagged behind Arizona in
its final weekend of regular season play but
Stanford is hoping to get hot once again in time for
the playoffs.
"Last weekend, [Arizona's Alicia) Hollowell was
the best I've ever seen her throw," Bendig said. "But
we're not going to let it phase us for the weekend."
Smith and Morris earned All Pac-1() First-Team
honors while Lappin was named the conference's
Defensive Player of the Year. Morris, who leads the
team with a .362 average and 18 multi-hit games,
was also selected for the First-Team All-Pacific
Region.
It's yet unknown whether senior Laura Severson
or McCullough will take the circle tonight though
McCullough. a righty, will probably start.
"I can't predict," Bendig said. "Either way we're
good to go."
A consistent McCullough saw more time this
year (18-6), but Severson (15-6) has the postseason
experience. Severson also held opponents to a .212
average. As a unit, the Cardinal staff accumulated a
1.84 ERA.
"I'm prepared for it," McCullough said. "We'll
see what happens."
Stanford also has another chance at hosting with
the Super Regional. The NCAA Tournament is try
ing out the Regional / Super Regional format for
the first time this year. Instead of eight Regionals
with eight teams a piece, there are 16 sites this year
with four squads at each.
"We're kind of going into unchartered waters, so
to speak " Rittman said. "It's good for the sport. As
far as hosting a regional, from a logistical stand
point, it's easier."
Following this weekend's Regionals are four
Super Regionals, which will be best-of-three series,
to be followed by the eight-team, double-elimina
tion WCWS in June.
"I don't think anyone has any real strong opinion
on it," McCullough said. "It's a new way at going at
it, though it does put it during finals week. [There isl
an advantage to the team with more than one [star]
pitcher, which is what we have."
Last season the No. 1 seeded Cardinal hosted the
first Regional. That squad advanced to the WCWS,
where it fell to defending champion UCLA 3-1.
Stanford will aim for its third World Series appear
ance in five years over the next two weeks.
