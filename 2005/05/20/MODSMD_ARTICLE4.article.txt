### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
After capturing a share of the Pacific-10 Conference title last Saturday, the No. 4
Stanford softball team gathered Sunday evening to hear the announcement of the
2005 NCAA Tournament Regional sites and seeds.
Though Stanford made a bid to host one of the 16 Regionals and head

coach John Rittman said his team deserved to host, the selection committee

But the Cardinal are coming from one of the best confer
