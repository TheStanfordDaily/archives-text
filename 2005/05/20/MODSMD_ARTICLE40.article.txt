## tunes WEEZER PLAYS 'MAKE BELIEVE' 
### RACHEL LIN INTERMISSION MUSIC CRITIC 
When Weezer released
self-titled "Blue" album in
the record's collection ol cjuu k\, in
fectious teenage sing-alongs ('•Un
done: The Sweater Song." "Say It i
Ain't So") paired with a deluge of
clever Spike Jonze-directed videos
propelled both the album and the
band to instant epic status within
the then-dominant alt-rock scene
The problem, of course, with
releasing a masterpiece as your
debut is that anything recorded
thereafter will inevitably be mea
sured by this "gold standard." — or.
in Weezer's case, the "Blue" stan
dard. Weezer has suffered this curse
over the years — the band's darker

sophomore effort "Pinkerton," though brilliant, received lackluster commercial re
sponse, and follow-ups "The Green Album" and "Maladroit" were still far from reach
ing the addictive virtuosity of "Blue'' in the opinion of most fans. That being said.
"Make Believe." the fifth studio release from this group of still awkward, yet endear
ing. geek rockers proves a refreshing outing that, though not "Blue," definitely im
proves on what the band has recently recorded and gives fans much to be excited about.
At this point, you've probably heard the first single "Beverley Hills." which is a
solid track with a catchy, if standard, hook and more of the amusing, self-effacing
lyrics that frontman Rivers Cuomo has become famous for. Yet the appeal of
"Make Believe" comes when the band moves away from its conventional formula
— "This is Such a Pity." for instance, is infectious with an '80s new wave vibe that
is completely new for Weezer. "Hold Me" and "Peace" follow "Pity" as stand-out
anthems that improve with repeated listening; they would definitely be my first
downloads if I had to pick the album apart.Lyrically, much of the album follows
Cuomo's common theme of confused alienation.

In an interesting twist, "Make Believe" also finds the notoriously erratic singer
apologizing for past behavior. As he sings "I jpy not he a pertect sool/But I can learn
i self-control" on "Pardon Me," one has toJpwier how the 34-ywir old Cuomo has
IjLcome to deal with the reclusive eccentricities thafhave nearly driven Weezer apart on
Ik number of occasions. The closing tracy&Hffit You Every Day." comes as close as
the band has ever come to writing a song that rfvak agony that is "Blue"
in Dreamsjius Cuomo heartjreakingly sings of bewg "oh. so alone in love."

\ "'•After Weezei's perfor
mance three wedks aggfcit the
Coachtll i Music Festival in
Indio. it's dear they are still a
band worth caring about
the\ have a core group of ded
icatel fans who absolutely
adore every bi/arre facet of
Cuomo's insecure persona.
Also, the jhand is extraorcß
harily adept at blending fair
favorites ("Tired of Sex." "In
the Garage") with new mater
ial —as they left the stage
after an hour-long set at
Coachella. the crowd of some
40,000 continued to chant
'Weezer' for several minutes
and then booed as stage hands
began removing the set to pre
pare for the next band.
Though "Make Believe"
may be doomed to live in the
shadow of "Blue." it is
nonetheless a worthy record
from a band that still knows
how to craft quality songs that
are simultaneously pure fun
and emotionally introspective.






Hmm, bad yearbook photos or "Twilight Zone" tryouts? Nobody I
may ever know.
