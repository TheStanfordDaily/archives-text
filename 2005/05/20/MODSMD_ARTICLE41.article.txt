# Electronica: It's a bull market, for sure

### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION RESIDENT DJ 
"DJs are always grouped together—
so a lot of us are tainted by the few that
play that crappy trance music," DJ ex
traordinaire Sasha recently explained in
an article on AijanWrites.com.
Ah, and how unfortunate (but true)
it is that the progressive hoase and
trance music scenes have been defined
by those bad apples in so many cases.
However, I'd tend to think that it's hard
to say they are as few and as far be
tween as Sasha might want us to think.
Around 2000, once trance had
worked itself into an all-too-pre
dictable-pop hangover, those in the
progressive movement had the bright
idea of merging house and trance, re
sulting in the progressive house and
progressive trance genres. The only
problem was that it then became rela
tively hard to tell the two apart at

times. (And the musical genealogy has
only continued to become increasingly
confusing ever since.)
Basically, though, fora long time it
seemed as if those who preferred the
darker side of the spectrum were
blessed by a period of beat-driven nir
vana. Alternatively, those who opted
for more melodic trance were getting
the short end of stick, faced with either
having to listen to run-of-the-mill
mixes from the likes of DJ Doughboy
(the name says it all) or having to reach
back into that pre-2()00 section of the
used-record bin. Even Kinetic
Record's famed "Tranceport" series
pulled a semi-180 on fans, changing its
name to "Transport" and embracing
less melodic artists such as Quiwer
and Trendroid.
But thankfully, the pendulum
swings both ways. And in the last year
or two, the prospects have gotten a lot
better for those who aren't necessarily

"slaves to the dark beat." In particular,
I'd like to take note of three amazing
albums that have come out in the last
year or so. You've probably already
heard of them, but that doesn't mean
they're necessarily in your album col
lection yet... and if they're not, they
definitely should be.
James Holden — Balance 005
Holy crap. This kid was only 19
when he started DJ ing, but he has been
phenomenonal ever since his start.
And sure, he might not lipsync corny
trance vocals or exude lavish amounts
of on-stage energy at live shows (in
sharp contrast to DFuse, who not only
feels free to pump up the crowd but
also dons a stylish Stetson-esque hat).
Instead, Holden's approach to stage
presence is to do his best to mimick
what an unemployed, socially awk
ward plumber might do while behind

the decks (read: not much). I guess you
could say he's all about the music, but
that's perfectly fine when buying an
album (remember, you can't see all
those goofy antics of those like D:Fuse
when they're spinning around your
CD player).
Paul Oakenfoid — Creamfields
Face it, you thought Oakenfold's
"Tranceport" was mind-blowing back
in the day (1998, to be specific). That's
because it was — and still is, despite
the signature trance sound that comes
off as being a bit dated in today's elec
tronic music arena. And while you
might have been waiting all these
years, wading through the various
"Perfecto Presents" releases for that
next big thing from him. suddenly ole
Oakie took you by surprise and finally
delivered. "Creamfields" is by all au
thoritative accounts the real "Trance

port 2" (no offense to Dave Ralph in
tended), playing up all the aspects of
trance that make it so classic while
downplaying those that borderline on
cheesiness. If Clinton were looking for
a "trance bridge to the twenty-first cen
tury," he'd be hard-pressed to do much
better than this release.
Sasha — Involver
Simply put, this album is amazing.
Purists in the electronic community
were a bit peeved by Sasha's contro
versial decision to go with digital rather
than vinyl mixing (goodbye turnta
bles!), but the results speak for them
selves. When someone can wholly
reengineer tracks so that everything
blends together as beautifully and
seamlessly as "Involver" does, it's hard
to take issue with the methodology. If
there's any downside to this release,
it's that it's not a double CD.
