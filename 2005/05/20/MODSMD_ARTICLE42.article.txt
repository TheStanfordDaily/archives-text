### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
1 lave you ever wanted
to be a model? How about a
TV star? Do you want to lose
weight and get fit? "Yes,
Roxy!" you beg eagerly.
"Yes! Tell me how!" To which
Roxy says: it's what she's been
telling you all along. You need
to have more sex. Seriously.
Kerry McCloskey's new book
"The Ultimate Sex Diet," ex
plains the whole scoop.
McCloskey introduces
her book by talking about her
"secret." "My secret," she ex
plains, "has made my life so
much richer, so much more fun
and exciting, that I can-

not keep it bottled
up inside me any

longer." What
is this amazing

secret? She
lost 23 pounds screwing her brains out. And that's
not all sex can do for you. Read on.

McCloskey's website (lovediet.com) lists
the top ten secret benefits of sex. Among
those are that sex boosts the immune

system, improves your memory
and enhances your sense of
smell. Hang on — what?

Sex improves your
sense of smell?

No wonder
it's so

popular. And all this time Roxy
thought it was about the or
gasm.But wait — there's more.
According to McCloskey, "There
is scientific evidence that sex is
actually a "beauty treatment."
Tests have found that when
women make love, they produce
more estrogen, which makes
their hair shiny and smooth. Also,
the sweat produced cleanses
pores and makes the skin glow,
reducing the chances of dermati
tis and rashes." Delicious. Try
this line the next time you go frat
ting; "Hey baby, I know a great
way to clear up that dermatitis..."
"The Ultimate Sex Diet" has
chapters like "Sexercise: Fore-

play and Floor Play," "More Passion Burns More Calories" and my personal
favorite — "Don't Crave Sweets. Crave Your Sweetie!" The book also of-

fers novel positions and techniques to maximize calorie-burning. After
some deep reflection. Roxv came up with a few ideas herself.
Novice: "Jumping jack-off' Fantastic for prolonging plea-

sure AND increasing fitness! The idea is simple: Men. whenever
you feel close to climaxing, pull out. stand up, and do ten jump-

ing jacks. You'll drive your partner wild with anticipation. I n -
termediate: "Drop and give me head'This is great for upper
bodv strength. Your man lies on his back on the floor. You

keep your face between his legs, but no wimpy head-bobbing.
To get a full workout, you do push-ups to move your body up

and down. With such intense exercise, you'll BOTH be
sweatinu and moaning.

Expert: "The caveman"
After you've made your conquest at that keg
ger. sling him/her over your shoulder like a sack of
potatoes. Then accomplish your weight-training
exercise by carrying them the whole way back to
your room. Fora romantic touch, you can also
carry your new slampiece in your arms honey
moon-stvle. Bonus fitness points if the party's on
the row and you live in FroSoCo. And. if you're re
ally hardcore, you can do lunges all the way home.
Maybe Roxy should write her own book. For
now though, she'll stick with "The Ultimate Sex
Diet." The book claims il will change your life for
ever. It didn't change Roxv's life, because Roxv's
already a sex goddess. But you aren't. So what are
you waiting for? Your olfactory organs will thank
you.




If you wanted to gain 23 pounds while enjoying the
benefits of sex, try incorporating one of these in your
bed room adventures. Remember, we didn't say how.
