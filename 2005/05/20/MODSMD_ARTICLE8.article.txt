## Prof. heads to Chile to fight cancer 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During one of the first ever humanitarian missions to
treat skin cancer. Dermatology Prof. Hayes Gladstone
traveled to Chile last month and provided free care to
more 20 patients.
Since the early 19905, the hole in the ozone layer has
been centered over southern Chile. Combined with the
migration of fair-skinned Europeans to the country over
the last 200 years, rural poverty and limited access to
medical care, this problem has resulted in many severe
cases of skin cancer, Gladstone said.
"One in three people in Chile are expected to devel
op skin cancer, compared to one in five in the United
States," he said in an interview with The Daily.
The issue came to Gladstone's attention last year
when he gave a lecture on epidermolysis bullosa, a con
dition that causes blister formation, in Palo Alto. Francis
Palisson. a pediatric dermatologist from Chile and the
nation's leading expert on the disease, spoke to Glad
stone following the talk
Palisson told him that he wanted to bring Mohs Mi
crographic surgery, a highly effective skin cancer treat
ment. to Chile. Shortly thereafter, Gladstone assembled
a team of eight surgeons from various university medical
centers and two registered nurses, including Stanford's
Judy Elkayam.
In the course of one week, the team was able to treat
20 Chileans ranging from nine to SO years old.
"It was really great for all the country," Palisson said
in an interview with The Daily. "They make surgery very,
very good for the poorest of people."
if it hadn't been for the team's intervention, many of
these people may have died, Gladstone told the Stanford
News Service. The only treatment offered by Chilean
physicians would have involved extensive and disfigur
ing surgeries.
Many of the Chileans they met called the doctors on
the team "gifts from God," Elkayam said in an interview
with The Daily.
There is a two-tiered health system in Chile: there are
private hospitals for the wealthy, but most people must
seek care at poorly-funded public hospitals. Because the
public facilities lacked the proper equipment, the team
performed their surgeries at the private Clinica Alem
ana.
Mohs Micrographic treatment,
now recognized as the most effective
skin cancer treatment in the world, is
a fairly new development. The tech
nique offers surgeons microscopic
control, allowing them to remove
multiple thin, horizontal layers of
cells and view the entire border of the
cancer. It has a 99 percent cure rate
for primary lesions, compared to tra
ditional surgeries' 9() percent cure
rate. It also leaves the smallest possi
ble scar, which is especially desirable

for patients suffering from facial skin
cancer.
The lack of skin cancer awareness
among Chileans is another major
problem, Gladstone said.
"Only a small part of the popula
tion is educated about the problems
of skin cancer," he said.
Chilean newspapers regularly re
port on the hole in the ozone layer,
and a few include information on ul
traviolet radiation levels. Even so.
most people still do not wear sun
block, he added.
While Santiago does not receive as
much unfiltered solar radiation as
cities further south like Punta Arenas,
its residents are still at great risk be
cause the warmer temperatures cause

them to wear less clothing and expose
their skin more often, according to
the Web site of the Ozone Hole, a
nonprofit environmental group.
To address this problem, the med
ical team also taught courses on the
Mohs procedure and facial reconstruc
tion to Chilean doctors and nurses.
Gladstone said he hopes to return
to Chile next year and perform at
least 1(X) surgeries. He is also trying to
set up a fellowship at Stanford and
other leading academic derma
surgery institutions for Chilean doc
tors to learn the most advanced treat
ments and procedures.
"The long term solution is for
them to do it and not us," Gladstone
said.
