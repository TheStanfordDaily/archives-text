# Google reveals a few secrets

### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Google opened its sprawling Mountain View cam
pus to journalists for the first time yesterday to sketch
its vision for the future of Web searching and to an
nounce the release of several new products, including
a personalized homepage option similar to that of
fered hv Yahoo! and a searchable satellite mapping of
the earth.
"Some of our users want the clean, classic home
page," said Marissa Mayer, director of consumer Web
products at Google and a Stanford graduate. "But
some of our users want more."
That "more" is a customizable homepage — now
available at labs.google.com — that integrates
Google's Web-based products, including its popular
Gmail service and GoogleMaps-powered driving di
rections, into one personalized Web site. The launch is
the first in a new a line of "fusion" products meant to
unify what some have called a haphazard hodgepodge
of tools.
True to the Google style, the interface of the new
options is uncluttered and simple. Users will be able to
customize their Google homepage to feature news
headlines, stock quotes. Gmail snippets, movie times
and weather reports. There is even a word or quote of
the day feature.
The Google homepage feature allows users to

click-and-drag frames for instant customization, set
ting it apart from similar tools offered by other compa
nies including Microsoft and America Online.
Google representatives also announced the im
pending release of Google Earth, a searchable satellite
imaging of the world, with high-resolution images of
parts of the world previously neglected by satellite im
aging programs, including Santiago. Chile, and South
Africa. The new product will also allow users to navi
gate terrain features so that mountains really tower
and valleys actually sink. Google Earth will also be
able to take users on virtual road trips.
"You can do an awful lot of things you can't do in
maps," said Sergey Brin, Google co-founder who
earned his doctorate in computer science at Stanford.
While executives remained mum on other products
in the development pipeline, including a much-ru
mored Google web browser, researchers offered the
group a glimpse at other technologies in the pipeline.
Machine translations, for instance, have come a
long way at Google.
"Historically, the approach to building machine
translation systems is to have expert machine linguists
write down dictionaries and rules on how to translate,
say, from Chinese to English," said researcher Franz
Och. 'Tryiag to write down all the rules on how to
