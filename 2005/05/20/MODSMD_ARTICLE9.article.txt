# Google reveals a few secrets

### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Google opened its sprawling Mountain View cam
pus to journalists for the first time yesterday to sketch
its vision for the future of Web searching and to an
nounce the release of several new products, including
a personalized homepage option similar to that of
fered hv Yahoo! and a searchable satellite mapping of
the earth.
"Some of our users want the clean, classic home
page," said Marissa Mayer, director of consumer Web
products at Google and a Stanford graduate. "But
some of our users want more."
That "more" is a customizable homepage — now
available at labs.google.com — that integrates
Google's Web-based products, including its popular
Gmail service and GoogleMaps-powered driving di
rections, into one personalized Web site. The launch is
the first in a new a line of "fusion" products meant to
unify what some have called a haphazard hodgepodge
of tools.
True to the Google style, the interface of the new
options is uncluttered and simple. Users will be able to
customize their Google homepage to feature news
headlines, stock quotes. Gmail snippets, movie times
and weather reports. There is even a word or quote of
the day feature.
The Google homepage feature allows users to

click-and-drag frames for instant customization, set
ting it apart from similar tools offered by other compa
nies including Microsoft and America Online.
Google representatives also announced the im
pending release of Google Earth, a searchable satellite
imaging of the world, with high-resolution images of
parts of the world previously neglected by satellite im
aging programs, including Santiago. Chile, and South
Africa. The new product will also allow users to navi
gate terrain features so that mountains really tower
and valleys actually sink. Google Earth will also be
able to take users on virtual road trips.
"You can do an awful lot of things you can't do in
maps," said Sergey Brin, Google co-founder who
earned his doctorate in computer science at Stanford.
While executives remained mum on other products
in the development pipeline, including a much-ru
mored Google web browser, researchers offered the
group a glimpse at other technologies in the pipeline.
Machine translations, for instance, have come a
long way at Google.
"Historically, the approach to building machine
translation systems is to have expert machine linguists
write down dictionaries and rules on how to translate,
say, from Chinese to English," said researcher Franz
Och. 'Tryiag to write down all the rules on how to

translate from Chinese to English is
very hard."
Instead, Google is fine-tuning a
translation program that can auto
matically translate back and forth
between documents in different
languages a sort of virtual Roset
ta Stone.
Current machine translations
are inconsistent at best, Och said.
One current translation program
translated "The White House con
firmed the existence of a new bin
Laden tape" in Arabic to "Alpine
white new presence tape registered
for coffee confirms Laden," in Eng
lish.
Another Google researcher,
Marius Pasca.said he wants the Web
to be searchable by different cate
gories of facts, like dates or loca
tions. A search for " Marilyn Mon
roe" by date, for instance, would re
sult in a timeline of her life.
"The basic tenet of the research
lab is to use the huge amount of data
and computational resources to
solve interesting problems," said
Alan Eustace, vice president of en
gineering and research. "We have
essentially unlimited computational
power. That allows us to solve some
very interesting problems."
Computer science co-terminal
student lan Spiro, who worked at
Google last summer, said he be
lieves the company is headed in the
right direction.
"Google is driven by a genuine
desire for quality — using the
power of technology responsibly to
bring actual utility to the world," he
said. "This is a company with a rare
sense of morality that I'm not sure
can survive in the long run, but I ab
solutely hope does."
