## Women capture 14th NCAA title 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a 4-0 shutout of No. 11 Texas (25-6),
the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (27-0)
clinched its record-setting Nth NCAA
Championship title to cap another flawless
season.
No. 25 senior Erin Burdette (22-8) sealed the
deal by defeating the Longhorns' No. 84 Kendra
Strohm (21-19), 6-4, 6-1, at Dan Magill Tennis
Complex in Athens, Ga.
In the 23-year history of the NCAA
Championships, Stanford ranks first with 14
titles, Florida ranks second with 4 and Georgia
has won two. Southern California claimed a title

in 1983, while the Longhorns came out on top in
1995.
Legacy aside, this year's squad showed that
the true essence of being the most successful
team in women's collegiate tennis stems from
the heart and determination of its players.
For Burdette, leading the team to another
NCAA victory meant battling a debilitating
shoulder injury to clinch Stanford's final match
fora third time in her career.
After a week of either coming up just short
in singles play, or not finishing her match at all,
Burdette's pivotal straight-set victory was that
much more satisfying.
"No matter how many championships you
win, it's always great to come out on top,"

Burdette said in a press release. "I would have
to say that the excitement I feel after the last
point is one of my best memories in collegiate
tennis."
On court three, Burdette was leading 5-0,
40-love in the second set. Meanwhile, at No. 2
singles, No. 20 Alice Barnes was fighting out a
5-3 lead. No. 84 freshman Whitney Deason
was on the verge of victory on court five, lead
ing 5-1.
Neither head coach Lele Forood nor assis
tant coach Frankie Brennan saw the final point,
but both attested to the poignancy of Burdette's
resounding finish.
