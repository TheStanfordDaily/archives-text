## Women capture 14th NCAA title 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a 4-0 shutout of No. 11 Texas (25-6),
the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (27-0)
clinched its record-setting Nth NCAA
Championship title to cap another flawless
season.
No. 25 senior Erin Burdette (22-8) sealed the
deal by defeating the Longhorns' No. 84 Kendra
Strohm (21-19), 6-4, 6-1, at Dan Magill Tennis
Complex in Athens, Ga.
In the 23-year history of the NCAA
Championships, Stanford ranks first with 14
titles, Florida ranks second with 4 and Georgia
has won two. Southern California claimed a title

in 1983, while the Longhorns came out on top in
1995.
Legacy aside, this year's squad showed that
the true essence of being the most successful
team in women's collegiate tennis stems from
the heart and determination of its players.
For Burdette, leading the team to another
NCAA victory meant battling a debilitating
shoulder injury to clinch Stanford's final match
fora third time in her career.
After a week of either coming up just short
in singles play, or not finishing her match at all,
Burdette's pivotal straight-set victory was that
much more satisfying.
"No matter how many championships you
win, it's always great to come out on top,"

Burdette said in a press release. "I would have
to say that the excitement I feel after the last
point is one of my best memories in collegiate
tennis."
On court three, Burdette was leading 5-0,
40-love in the second set. Meanwhile, at No. 2
singles, No. 20 Alice Barnes was fighting out a
5-3 lead. No. 84 freshman Whitney Deason
was on the verge of victory on court five, lead
ing 5-1.
Neither head coach Lele Forood nor assis
tant coach Frankie Brennan saw the final point,
but both attested to the poignancy of Burdette's
resounding finish.

The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team capped off another perfect season with a 4-0 sweep of Texas in yesterday's NCAA final in Athens, Ga.
Perfect
ending
"I've seen it on Erin's face all week, a
feeling that she was just not quite getting
over the hump, but improving a little bit
each day," Brennan said. "She's had so
many injuries in the last two years, and 1
don't think she's quite gotten to do what
she wanted on an individual level. But for
her to finish the way she did. to go out a win
ner, was icing on the cake."
For No. 36 Deason (30-3), rounding out
her first year on the Farm with a team title
meant pushing through a nagging back in
jury to clinch a huge win in the semifinals
against Clemson.
Deason downed the Tigers' Daniela Al
varez (15-15) in straight sets and sent Stan
ford to the final, 6-4,6-2.
"The girl I played was pretty tough and
didn't make a lot of errors," Deason said. "I
wasn't playing my best but I fought through
it and it was good for me to get through
that."
"Whitney was coming off a [stress frac
ture] that could have been career-ending if
it had gotten any worse," Brennan added.
"But she comes to us and says/Hopefully I
can play both doubles and singles all four
days.' From my perspective, this is what our
team is about, and the girls amaze me every
day with the way they come out and fight."
In doubles, Deason teamed up with
sophomore Theresa Logar to do some
major damage. The newly formed No. 3
doubles duo won all four of its completed
NCAA matches.
With an ace from Logar, the Cardinal
tandem (4-0) sealed an 8-5 victory over
Texas' Kelly Baritot and Courtney Zauft
(23-12) to take a 1-0 lead over the Long
horns.
Boasting its most reliable No. 3 doubles
team in recent years, Stanford was able to
add a new level of confidence to its already
sound squad. And what the last-minute
pairing of Logar and Deason may have
lacked in shared experience was made up

for by a formidable array of groundstrokes.
"We had been playing really great dou
bles the whole week, so the doubles was
huge for us." Brennan said. "There was a lot
of pressure on us to beat someone like
Texas, an 11th tournament seed, and I think
it relaxed us to know that the doubles teams
could rely on each other; if one team lost
the other two could step up and secure the
doubles point. We haven't had this in past
years."
For Barnes (26-7), a junior, owning her
second team title meant dominating both
singles and doubles to be named Most Out
standing Player of the Tournament.
In an unsettling quarterfinal match
against Georgia. Barnes gained momentum
against Natalie Frazier by winning a first
set tiebreak.7-6 (4).
Due to inclement weather, the match
was moved indoors, to a faster surface that

was more suited to the Bulldog's game.
Still, Barnes went on to claim the match for
Stanford with a straight-set victory, 7-6 (4),
6-4.
At No. 2 doubles. Barnes teamed up with
Burdette to defeat Evgenia Subbotina and
Kelley Hyndman.B-4.
Reflecting on her experience with the
outgoing senior. Barnes said she was proud
that Burdette put in so much work to regain
her health and put in a good run at NCAAs.
"1 think we'd both say that our doubles
season didn't turn out quite like what we'd
expected." Barnes said. "I thought we'd
sweep, but I do think we came back well
from all the setbacks of Erin's injury. 1 like
to say that it's a credit to Erin because she's
been working so hard to get back on the
court."
1 n Sunday's final,the No. 8 pair was lead
ins Texas' Petra Dizdar and Mia Marovic

(21-10), 7-2, when Logar launched her
game-winning ace.
Barnes and Burdette finished their sea
son with a solid 24-6 doubles record.
No. 7 Amber Liu. a junior, defeated Diz
dar in the top singles slot, 6-3, 6-3, to help
Stanford to the shutout.
No. 32 Logar defeated Katie Ruckert at
No. 4 singles, 6-1,6-4.
As a top seed, Stanford's decisive victo
ry against Texas may not have been the sea
son-ending matchup that people had hoped
for. The Longhorns had edged Stanford's
main rival. No. 2 Florida (21-3), with a 4-3
heartbreaker in the semifinals.
Just the same, the 2005 squad proved its
mettle once and for all with its overwhelm
ing dominance over Texas.
"No matter who showed up in the final,
I felt like our team was going to get it done,"
Forood said.
