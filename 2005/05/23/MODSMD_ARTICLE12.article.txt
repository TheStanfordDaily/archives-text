## Why you should be an unpaid intern 
### 
Until this month, I had a lot of ex
pectations for this summer. I'd hoped
to continue my research, get a paid
internship and tutor on the side. Ac
cording to these calculations, I would
have been able to afford another
quarter's tuition, an extended vaca
tion on the coast of Italy or a second
hand motorcycle I'd be too scared to
ride.
But though I've applied for every
thing from writing environmental
pamphlets to developing drugs for
male incontinence, I still have only
half a iob on the table. With onlv two

111411 CI JV/U Wll 111V 1(1
weeks left of
spring quarter, it
is clear that in
stead of becom
ing a thou
sandaire, I'll be
eating two meals
a day and getting
to campus by
bumming rides.
So as long as I
won't be making
any money, I
might as well go

for the next best thing: experience,
acquired through unpaid internships.
For once I'll believe the career coun
selors and trust that there's virtue in
delayed gratification. Learn when
you're young! Make money when
you're arthritic! I'm sure someday it
will all make sense.
But I want to be a rock star, and
the closest experience I can find falls
under "entertainment." If there's any
truth to legend, I'll be making coffee,
answering phones and kissing old-ar
rogant-man ass. Supposedly such
menial tasks teach universally appli
cable skills learning to work as a
team, for instance, or managing your
time.
"Team." "Time." These concepts
are irrelevant to my rock-star plans.
If such banalities exist, my handlers
will take care of them. Like every
other rock god, I will undoubtedly be
notorious for no-showing and an in
ability to interact in socially con
structive ways. These qualities will
only add to my quirky rebel charm.
I've learned from my over-opti
mism, though.There's a small chance
I may not make it as a rock star, so
I've resigned myself to building a
back-up. Still, it's a hassle to live
without money. New concerns arise
whether you can find a friend to burn
you a certain CD, which brownie mix
is the cheapest per ounce or which
snack offers the most calories for the
price.
All these things require research,
and research requires time. Manag
ing money is a necessary and nontriv
ial task. And if I spend my free time
gaining "work experience," where
will I find the time to handle all this?
Clearly, I need my own intern.
And what better place to advertise
than here, for free, in The Stanford
Daily?
Responsibilities of the Grace Liu
Personal Peon Internship would in
clude those mentioned above, as well
as reminding me what day of the
week it is and singing harmony to old
showtunes and obscure Calvinist
hymns.
I can't afford to pay anything, and
my academic credit has yet to be rec
ognized by an actual institution.
Nonetheless, I can promise you'll
gain valuable, universally applicable
joo skills, like dealing with horribly
difficult people and interpreting the
increasingly popular American di
alect: mumbling.
Furthermore, it's inevitable that
at some juncture you'll experience
an existential crisis in which you'll
wonder â€” is what I'm doing in life
really worthwhile? Is doing anything
in life really worthwhile at all? Re
gardless of your chosen path, you'll
have loads of these doubting mo
ments. Why not learn to deal with
them in a safe, somewhat friendly en
vironment where your panicked de
cisions can produce no real negative
repercussions?
I'm understanding. I expect these
things. On those days when you tune
into reality and feel undervalued and
underpaid. I even welcome you to
steal my "office supplies." You have a
choice of thumbtacks, Chococat
binder paper and Cheerios.
In addition, I will provide a glow
ing letter of reference. It is sure to be
every bit as earnest and persuasive as
this column.

To apply for the Grace Liu Personal
Peon Internship, please send a witty
yet-sycophantic cover letter and visu
ally pleasing resume to igliu@stan
