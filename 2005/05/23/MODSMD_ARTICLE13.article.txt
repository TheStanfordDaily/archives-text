# Local offers healthy, often organic dining
## Cantor's Cool Cafe owner stresses sustainability 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
Jesse Cool is what some people might call
incongruous.
Though Cool is the owner and founder of
CoolEatz, an organic catering business with
three umbrella restaurants including the
Cool Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center, she
also admits to having recently stopped in at
In-N-Out for french fries and a Coke.
Cool chocks up this indulgence to her 85-15
rule: Eighty-five percent of the time you're al
ways conscious of the food you eat and its im
pact on you and the planet." This leaves 15
percent of the time for In-N-Out treats and
the like.
Cool allows this philosophy of leaving
room for mistakes to transcend into the way
she runs her business. Dedicated to organic
products and sustainability, Cool says she
starts each week with goals to improve her
restaurant's commitment to the environment
and the community.
"On a daily basis, all of us [on the staff] ex
amine what it means to have a responsibility
to, and a consciousness of, food, both locally

and globally," she said. "And we always for
give ourselves for what we haven't done as
well as we could, but every day we wake up
and know that tomorrow's a brand new day."
Though a religion major in college. Cool
eventuaiiy made the transition back to the
food industry, which had always been an inte
gral part of her life.
"My mother taught me to nurture, my fa
ther taught me the connection to food," Cool
explained.
Cool's father's grocery store in what she
describes as a small, poor town in Pennsylva
nia "fed the community in many ways,"
through selling organic vegetables and giving
back to the community.
There, Cool learned how to "run a food or
ganization with integrity" and maintain a
strong "connection to organic [food through]
being aware of every aspect of what food is
about."
Cool headed to the South Bay in California
where she started working as a waitress at
Good Earth in Palo Alto, a natural foods store
and soon after founded one of the first organ
ic restaurants with her former husband Bob
Cool and friend Steve Silva.
"I started in the restaurant business having
no idea what 1 was doing except that I loved to
cook," Cool said. "I knew nothing about busi
nessâ€” I'm just learning now after 30 years.
The other part, the community and the organ
ic, that was easy."
Her business and subsequent restaurants
are based on "caring and sustainability." This

includes "caring on all levels" and "taking care
of where the food comes from" through pay
ing attention to environmental and social con
cerns.
"My dad knew where the meat was slaugh
tered and where the food was grown," Cool
said. "Where the food comes from para
mounts in how it tastes. That naturally hap
pens when the ingredient is wonderful."
Sometimes the ingredients that produce
the best taste are not the imported ones, or the
most expensive, but others found closer to
home. Cool said.
"I realized very quickly that gourmet did
not mean bottled jars brought from Europe
but what was grown in my community," she
said.
Cool and her management staff buy their
foods from door-to-door vendors, coopera
tives, farmers' markets and Webb Ranch, one
of the last existing working farms in the area.
"Farmers are my heroes," Cool said. "They
are my teachers and my mentors because they
are the ones who really teach us what to do
with the food."
A commitment to the local markets some
times causes Cool to choose non-organic food
from a local seller over organic food from a
non-local producer.
"[Our food] may not be 100 percent organ
ic because sometimes the better choice of the
product is not necessarily the organic one,"
she said.
"Organic is a huge part of what I do, but it's
not all of it. When you're growing organic

you're taking care of the land, and not putting
anything onto the food that's harmful. For 20
years it was just about organic. Then about 10
years ago when the industry grew which is a
good thing it became more of an issue of sus
tainability."
Simultaneously while working with the
local community, Cool stays connected to the
national and international communities.
"I stand up for my local farmers, but I am
also working with some big companies like
General Mills and Coca Cola that are really
looking at their role in the big world with sus
tainability," she said. "These are not bad peo
ple these are good people, really asking ques
tions about sustainability."
For her fresh fish supply, Cool said she is
currently partnering up with a chef from Ice
land, which she considers to be one of the most
sustainable countries in the world. Other proj
ects that Cool is working on include "looking
at energy sources to see how not to drain our
energy" and improving her restaurants' waste
management.
Although Cool is strongly committed to
her goals, she said she recognizes that some
times compromises have to be made, such as
her previous commitment solely to the organ
ic products.
"I'm very opinionated, but I'm also a cross
over person I'm open to listening to all sides,"
she said. "Liberals can be just as fascist as fas
cists. We all have to listen to each other, and
take care of the planet and the people living
on it."
