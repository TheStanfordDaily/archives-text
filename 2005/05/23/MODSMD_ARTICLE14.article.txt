# Flicks to support Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
## 'Kicking and Screaming' proceeds go to charity 
### ZEWDE YERASWORK 
Proceeds from last night's charitable
screening of "Kicking and Screaming,"
will go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation. This is the third charity
fundraiser Flicks has held this year.
The Flicks staff obtains the films di
rectly from the production studios for
free.
In this way, one of Flicks' executives
Matt Fischer-Colbrie said, "The founda
tions get a donation from the studio and a
donation from Flicks."
The partnership with charity organi
zations began this fall with the showing
of "Meet the Fockers," which benefited
the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Flicks

leaders asked the movie's director Jay
Roach, Class of 1979, to speak at the
event.
During winter quarter, Flicks collabo
rated with Students Taking Action Now:
Darfur fora special screening of "Hotel
Rwanda," and 50 percent, or about
$1,700, was donated to the Genocide In
tervention Fund, a non-profit organiza
tion that works to raise awareness about
mass killings in African countries and do
nates to efforts to stop them.
Fischer-Colbrie said his goal is to both
"reinvent Flicks" and draw more sizable
crowds each week. He said that the new
charity-event aspect may encourage peo
ple to make time in their busy schedules
to take a movie break and "donate while

they are having a good time."
While organizers expected coopera
tion with the movie studios to present the
biggest challenge, Fischer-Colbrie said
that executives at Universal — the pro
duction company for both "Meet the
Fockers" and "Kicking and Screaming"
— immediately found the cause worth
while.
However, he said that sometimes a stu
dio might say a movie isn't "right for char
ity," and that they may not want "a gory
horror picture to be presented to an audi
ence as charity. They have an image to
present."
Organizers predicted yesterday's
screening to be their most successful
fundraiser yet, particularly because

"Kicking and Screaming" was release
only a week before, whereas the previous
movies shown for charity had been in the
aters for several.
Flicks executive Daisy Chang said
there will definitely be more events of
this kind in the future, and that she has
was personally inspired by the help of
fered by the major studios.
"You are told Hollywood is callous and
that they won't care," she said. "It's just
the opposite."
She added that she was particularly im
pressed with the dedication of Stanford
alumni working at the studios they con
tacted.
"It was beyond my expectations,"
Chang said.
