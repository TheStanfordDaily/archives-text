## Editorial Exotic Erotic well-planned, but room for improvement 
### 
Smiles abounded on Saturday night as
young, nubile flesh was exposed in ways
that would have made even Paris Hilton
blush. But the real heroes of the night were
not the hot naked people — they were the
680 staff, Office of Student Activities, or
OS A, and Stanford Police who spent 5
months making a workable security plan.
At the peak of Exotic Erotic, about
1,200 Stanford students were crammed
within the confines of 680 Lomita and its
backyard. A small cadre of Stanford Police,
Stanford Event Police and residential staff
ensured the event did not end early as it did
last year. Given the high demand for the
event on campus, this was no small feat. Of
course, this was little consolation to the
leagues of students turned away at the bot
tom of the hill leading to 680.
For the last three years there have been
problems surrounding crowd control at Ex
otic Erotic. This year, organizers took this
concern to heart and re-organized security
to allow for quick entry and exit and pre
vented the crowd from becoming unruly.
We were particularly impressed by the
holding areas set up leading up to the lines
in to f>Bo — reminiscent of Disney World's
Space Mountain — which stopped the
crowd at the door from becoming large
enough to overcome security. Unfortunate
ly, one officer was assaulted by students try
ing to rush into the party. While the officer
was unharmed, the system could clearly still
use some tweaking.
The Stanford Police did a terrific job at
the event.The Stanford Police and the non
deputized event police created a true sense
of security by acting professionally and dili

gently.
Even though Exotic Erotic occurred
with relatively few problems, too many stu
dents walked away having never been able
to enter the party. Unfortunately as the
party has increased with popularity, the ex
isting location is no longer large enough to
handle the Stanford student demands.
Had everyone had an opportunity to at
tend the event, its attendance may have ri
valed Full Moon on the Quad. Next year,
the 680 staff, OS A and large student groups
should consider reorganizing Exotic Erotic
to reduce the need to limit attendance. Be
cause of security concerns, it will probably
always need to be a closed-off space. How
ever, collaborating with other houses, or
creating a larger area by using the space in
front of the house, would allow more stu
dents to enjoy the event.
Another solution considered this year,
and one that needs more thorough consid
eration is wrist-banding ahead of time.
Given that there is a fire-safety limit to the
number of attendees, that number of wrist
bands could be handed out prior to the
event's start, so that no one goes to the
event without being able to enter. And
knowing that everyone who shows up with
a wristband will get in should hopefully re
duce or even eliminate the hordes of stu
dents pushing and shoving to get to the
head of the line.
This year's event was better run than in
any number of past years, and the 680 staff
should be ecstatic with their effort. But as
long as the event is limiting the number of
students able to be involved, it can still be
re-thought and improved.
