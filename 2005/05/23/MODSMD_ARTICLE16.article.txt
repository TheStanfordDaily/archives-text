## Stan-jiggle, Ford-jiggle 
### 
One of the things I like about the Stan-1
ford summer is that when the sun comes
out, the clothes tend to stay home.The ex
cess of throbbing flesh makes a stroll
through campus considerably more enter
taining — nothing quite like a little wobble
to put a spring in one's step.
Given that such delights exist, I have
been poised, waiting for the rains to cease
and the sun to shine, ready to cast my eye
over the display and write about it (I've
been sitting on this title for months).

Unfortunately, the weather gods have been cruel this year
and those oh-so-tasteful (very) little hot pants have been in
abeyance this spring. However, fear not, another opportuni
ty for such sights came up over the weekend.
Saturday's Exotic Erotic is — according to some guy in a
posing pouch, or g-string — the apocryphal "3rd / sth / 7th
best college party in the USA." Thus, the glitterati were out
in full force, all decked out in, well, practically nothing (an
amazingly levelling outfit in which almost everyone looks
dreadful).
The event was the first chance I've had to check out an un
dergraduate party — for research purposes only of course (the
sacrifices I make for you,dear reader,are truly burdensome). It
was illuminating and (unsurprisingly) a little depressing.
Indications that perhaps we might seem a little out of
place started with the picking up of wristbands. A quick flash
of my ID was met with a look of horror and an expression of
surprise that people actually live to the age of 25.
Then came the recognition, with the acknowledgement of
one's elders coming in three different flavors: overt, covert
and oh-my-god-it's-a-grad-student-I-have-to-run-away.
'ITie first of these manifested itself with the disconcerting
experience of having men wearing a little less than under
wear come up to you with greetings of:"Hey! You're my TA!
I can't believe you're here! That's so sketchy!"

Actually, since this is Stanford, a few people also tacked
on a complaint about the unreasonable difficulty of the
midterm, though I suppose I should be grateful that at least
there were no re-grade requests.
Most of the children, though, were more circumspect in
their dealings. Instead of yelling out, they pointed, whispered
and smirked. Which, obviously, is much less embarrassing.
The smirking did seem a little harsh, though.
Lastly, in one's meanderings through campus life one gets
to know undergrads outside of a classroom and, despite my
best efforts, that's happened to me. So, on Saturday night I
did find myself occasionally saying hello to the odd junior ac
quaintance — all of whom ran away as fast as possible.
The net result of this selection of interactions is to cluster
the elderly together and keep them isolated. Well,isolated isn't
entirely accurate. It is, after all, pretty hard to stay in such a
state in a room full of humping, sweaty bodies — there's noth
ing quite like the clammy feel of another man's naked back
pressed up against yours as he readjusts his mounting position.
Still, even with the mounds of quivering flesh and associ
ated quivering excitement, there is a sense of distance.
Rather than fully immersing oneself in the ongoing faux
orgy, one, instead, steps back and watches the kids at play.
There's a difference between a party and a spectacle.The
same event can be either, depending on who you are and,
more importantly, whom you know. Given that, it seems a lit
tle unlikely that (at Stanford at least) you could actually
party like an undergrad.
On the other hand, I quite like spectacles; it's a lot less ef
fort for one thing and, for another, there were moments in
which the "sophistication" of the affair was a bit much. Fur
ther, anything that gets me away from the hoards of salivat
ing EE grads on a Saturday night is definitely a step forward.
