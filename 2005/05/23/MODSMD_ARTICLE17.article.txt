Measure A is good for education
It has been wonderful to be part of a community that
cares deeply about quality education. I spent eight years
on Palo Alto's school board. We debated issues, some
times heatedly, but our focus was always on what were
the most effective ways to provide our kids the best pos
sible education. Our kids need our support today.There's
no debating that Measure A is what's best for our kids'
education.
We know that the key to educational success is the
classroom teacher. Despite enrollment growth and cuts in
state funding, our school board has managed to maintain
reduced class size so that students can get the attention
they need to learn and thrive. In the last two years, admin
istrators have been reduced by 13 percent. It is no longer
possible to keep the cuts away from the classroom and the
kids.
Today, the quality of our student's education is at risk.
The district will loose $5.5 million dollars when our local
parcel tax expires. Clearly, the state won't fill the gap. Mea
sure A is part of a measured financial plan. Without its pas
sage, the district will spin into financial crisis.
Measure A will cost less than $ 1.35 a day. Please join me
in Voting YES on Measure A.Together we can take a stand
for our kids, for high quality education, for the kind of
community that we believe in.
