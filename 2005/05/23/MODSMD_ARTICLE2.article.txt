# Muslims hold culture fest
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Who wants to settle for dining hall food
when you could have fatayer? The Lebanese
pastry, prepared with spinach stuffing, was one
of the foods served Saturday at the first annual
Spring Culture Fest, sponsored jointly by the
Muslim Student Awareness network, or
MSAN, and the Islamic Society of Stanford
University, or ISSU.
Hosted at Manzanita Dining, the Spring
Culture Fest showcased the food, art and music
from 12 Muslim countries, including TUnisia.
Lebanon. Libya. Afghanistan and TUrkey.
There was also a live band playing a fusion of
Middle Eastern music and presentations on
various Islamic issues.

But MSAN President Rania Eltom. a sen
ior, said the festival was intended to spotlight
the culture rather than current events.
"The idea of the festival was to let people
participate in the culture instead of being inun
dated with issues," she added.
ISSU Vice President Lydia Daboussi.also a
senior, agreed.
"We wanted to show people the humanity
that exists in Muslim nations." she said. "We
really want to build bridges. It can be difficult
to learn about other cultures, so we wanted to
create a forum where people could get a
glimpse into the Muslim world and appreciate
the beauty"
"I have been to other events, which I felt

were more informative in terms of
Islam and its practices," Duygu
Kuzum, a first-year electrical engi
neering graduate student, said. "But I
like the food very much. I'm from
Turkey, and they featured food very
similar to Turkish food."
Freshman Ardalan Tajalli manned
the Lebanese cuisine booth, which
offered the fatayer and several differ
ent kinds of bread.
"It's so wonderful that they're hav
ing this,"Tajalli said. "It's such a great
way to experience the culture."
Freshman Caroline Ghosn
Bichara, who was sitting next to him,
agreed.
"I'm not a member of MSAN or
ISSU, but I am Lebanese," she said.
"This is amazing for me — it's so
much better than Stern."
ISSU president Ibrahim Almojel. a
third-year doctoral student in manage
ment science and engineering, said that
the goal of the event was to give Islam
a more familiar face.
"People identify Islam as a kind of
faceless ideology." he said. "We want
to show the diverse faces of Islam,
what it really is. Next time you think of
Islam, think of the countries we fea
ture here, the people sitting together
here, the people in your classes."
Almojel said he hoped the festival
would become a larger event in years
to come.
"We want it to expand and have
more of a program," he said. "I'd like
to maybe showcase other religions of
these cultures as well, and show how
Islam is manifested in relation to
other religions. For example, there are
Egyptian Christians as well as
Egyptian Muslims. In the end, they're
part of the same culture."
Eltom said that she felt the experi
ence was educational.
