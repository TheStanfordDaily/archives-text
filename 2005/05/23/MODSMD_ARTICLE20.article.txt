# A 						break from the bubble
## Toxic and idiotic 
### 
Maybe the party gods wanted
revenge for last week's column on
the excesses of alcohol. Maybe,
astrologically speaking, Saturday
wasn't my day. Whatever the rea
son. the party of the year turned
out to be my nightmare of the
year.
To recount the highlights of the
evening: My bare foot was stepped
on — twice —by someone wear-

ing high heels, which made my toe bleed; I got burned
on the arm with a cigarette; 1 was groped and sexual
ly harassed;and 1 ended up with puke on my hands —
all before 11 p.m.
I spent the subsequent three hours looking after
people as they vomited from the excesses of the
evening. There was nothing remotely exotic or erotic
about my night, though 1 did enjoy the thrills of liter
ally throwing my body against the door to keep
drunken partygoers out of the room while simultane
ously caring for sick people.
Perhaps the cherry on the proverbial sundae came
when I was waiting in line to get into the bathroom to
wash the puke off my hands. The girl in front of me
turned, surveyed me up and down and astutely ob
served: "You're a guy!"
"Yes," I responded.
Girl: "You should go out and pee in the bushes!
That's what guys do." Such wisdom.
Me: "Well, you see, someone puked on my hands
and I want to wash them."
Girl: "Oh yeah, that sucks." Then she turned back
around.
Where was the Stanford fake friendliness when I
needed it most?! Due to the length of the line, I never
ended up washing my hands.

In response to last week's column on college stu
dents' reliance on alcohol, a friend of mine argued
that I had over generalized the college experience.
He noted that he drinks moderately, has responsible
fun and no one gets hurt (or sick). And, he added,
there are many people like him.
I'm sure there are. But during the brief time I was
able to enjoy Exotic Erotic before I was on cleanup
duty, I wasn't seeing a whole lot of "responsible
drinking." What I was seeing was a whole lot of biki
nis and boxer briefs (for the prude) and pasties, fig
leaves and bare asses (for the not-so-prude).
And as terrible as my night turned out, I'm guess
ing my experience was not unique. Yes, I'm sure many
of you reading this column had an amazing time and
can't wait to count down the days to Exotic Erotic
2(X)6. But it's probably safe to assume an equal num
ber of you had nights similar to mine.
Ultimately, even if most people do drink responsi
bly, those who do not are more noticeable, and ulti
mately affect your evening to a much greater extent.
It just takes one bad apple ... or, in this case, a bad
appletini.
One good thing did come out of my night. When I
decided to be an R A for next year, I debated between
RAing in a dorm with freshman or in a row house. I
ended up wanting freshmen, and 1 kind of regretted
not getting to help throw parties in a fun upperclass
man house. But surveying the hallways of 680 at the
end of the night, my regret immediately morphed
into satisfaction. Suddenly running "Faces of Tran
cos" has never sounded so good.
