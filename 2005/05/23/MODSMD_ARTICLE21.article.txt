## Rename Hoover Tower 
### RONALD HINTON 
President Herbert Hoover is one of the most tragic fig
ures in American history. Before becoming president, he
was the great humanitarian, the most popular public fig
ure in America. ITien came the Great Depression, for
which he received the brunt of the blame. He was accused
of ordering the shooting of the Bonus Army and the burn
ing of their tents in Washington, DC. As Paul Dickson and
Thomas Allen have shown in their recent book, "The
Bonus Army: an American Epic," Hoover was tricked.
Those responsible were General Douglas Mac Arthur and
George Patton. Hoover became deeply embittered. His
old expansiveness disappeared. He withdrew into his shell
and conversation with him became difficult.
This affected Stanford University, of which he had
been a great benefactor. When he became president, Stan
ford had given him a great sendoff. When he returned to
Stanford after his presidency, the general hatred pursued
him. He was the butt of crude jokes. The Hoover Tower
was called Hoover's last erection. Instead of passing his
last years at his beloved Stanford, he withdrew to his fam
ily hometown of West Branch, lowa. I was appointed to
the Stanford faculty in 1941, and I believe I am the last
member of the Stanford community to have known him
personally. His bitterness was evident.
Hoover was a Quaker and a pacifist. He founded the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace to col

lect documents relative to this, particularly those concern
ing World War 1, and to study ways to promote peace.
There was nothing partisan in this. He supported
Woodrow Wilson's campaign to get the United States to
enter the League of Nations, and. when those efforts trag
ically failed, he wrote "The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson."
I was witness to the creation of the Hoover Library. I first
visited it in when it was just a collection of boxes in
the basement of what is now Green Library. 1 remember
the dedication of the 1 loovcr Tower in 1941, and I was on
the first committee which established the division of col
lection responsibilities between Hoover and the main li
brary. The division we established worked splendidly until
recently, when regrettably the Hoover Library was re
quired to give up collecting books and journals.
In all of this scholarly work Hoover's right-hand man
had been Harold Fisher, a nice and kindly historian, with
whom I had excellent relations. He served Hoover loyally
for years, but in his bitterness the former president lost his
affection for Fisher. It was tragic to watch Fisher trying to
re-establish the old cordial relations with Hoover.
Meanwhile Hoover's general attitude had changed. In
stead of striving to promote peace, he became obsessed
with the idea of fighting godless Communism.This affect
ed the public perception of the Hoover Institution. At first
it had been welcomed as a scholarly institution. It was
viewed as a bastion of reaction with which the faculty gen
erally wanted no relations. I gave a seminar which was

cosponsored by the Hoover Institution, and I hoped that
the Hoover Institution would become the focal point for
international studies at Stanford. Fisher told me that the
faculty would not agree to this. Sure enough, the Hoover
Institution was ordered to stay out of teaching.
General hostility to the Hoover Institution led to vi
olence.There were frequent demonstrations outside the
tower. The police were called in, and we were not al
lowed to enter the building. Calm has prevailed recent
ly, but the old attitude is still there under the surface.
Last year I received a nasty letter accusing me of selling
out to Hoover. Nothing could be further from the truth.
1 am simply remaining faithful to the original concept of
the Hoover Institution. If, as is quite possible, the Re
publican administration loses public support and unrest
becomes general, anti-Hoover demonstrations may
break out again.
There is one solution: the Hoover Tower should be re
named the Hoover Peace Tower. It is unlikely that politi
cal activists would attack a building with that name. The
Hoover Peace Tower would be on the West Coast the
counterpart of the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast. It
would cost nothing to change the name of the tower to
Hoover Peace Tower. There is no cheaper form of insur
ance, and no better expression of idealism.
