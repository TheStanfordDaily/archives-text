Web sites can be designed to
influence viewers in different ways.
To promote awareness of the theo
retical underpinnings of Web
design, the Stanford Design Guild is
holding a contest for community
designers.
"Although Web design tends to
be associated only with coding, it
actually involves very different
kinds of labor — layout, navigation,
content," said sophomore Michael
Huang, co-founder of the student
organization.
Each Web site submitted to the
contest, dubbed the Stanford
Webbies, will be judged in these
three categories by both design
professionals and entrants them
selves.
"Through making the entrants
interact and discuss the Web
designing process, we also hope to
bring together a group of designers
to facilitate collaboration and
resource help," said senior Derek
Gaw, the group's other co-founder.
"Stanford Webbies is not really just
about ranking the Web sites and giv
ing out prizes, but promoting the
design itself."
Last winter, the guild ran a paper
airplane contest, and while only

eight student entered, the products
were high in quality and originality,
Huang said. Sophomores Alexander
Auchte and Sylvia Yun — team
Funky Flyers — won both for dis
tance and accuracy.
"Design encompasses every
aspect of our lives," Gaw said. "We
are willing to help if students want
to explore designing."
Gaw and Huang taught a student
initiated course on design last quar
ter, and so far 30 students have sub
scribed to their guild's mailing list to
conduct an ongoing discussion on
design-related issues.
"Our long term goal is to estab
lish an organization in which our
members can offer design consult
ing services to students," Huang
said. "We want to invite distin
guished professionals to campus
and organize various workshops
where students can get the skills
they need."
Huang was inspired to start the
Webbies after coming across anoth
er Web site contest called the
Webbie Awards in which Computer
Science Prof. B.J. Fogg served as a
judge.
Participation in the Webbies is
not restricted to students. They will
be judged based on each entrant's
relative design experience.
