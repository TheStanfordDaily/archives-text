# Fallen tree shuts SLAC
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
A tree fell and cut through the main power lines
feeding the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
last Wednesday, causing a power outage that
stopped operations until today. Inclement weather
caused the l(K)-foot pine to fall across the three
main power lines, which run down a hill, said SLAC
Communications Director Neil Calder.
No one was injured, but all staff members were
asked to leave until further notice, he added.
"Our first concern was for the safety of the
staff," Calder said. "It's dangerous business for
them to be in the center with no power."
By Thursday the debris were cleared, and the
electricity came back on late Friday. Calder said
SLAC would have to wait to assess the impact of
the power outage on normal operations.
"As far as we see there's been no damage other
than the loss of power," he said. "We don't know
yet."
The accident occurred "independent of SLAC,'
Calder said. An easement located under the power
line is cleared of all trees and other potential obsta
cles, but the pine that fell was located outside of this
area.
"It's a pretty good bet that we'll be looking in
the area to make sure nothing else like this can hap
pen," he said. "But in terms of our safety record,
everyone understands that something completely
out of the center's control came down."
The SLAC staff is expected to return today. The
last accident at SLAC occurred in October, when a
bolt of electricity struck a worker.
