Today's column will investigate some of the
best sports quotes over the past 30 years.
1. Derek Bell — Operation Shutdown
"Nobody told me I was in competition. If there
is competition, somebody better let me know. If

there is competition, they bet
ter eliminate me out of the race
and go ahead and do what

ain't never hit in spring train
ing, and I never will. If it ain't
settled with me out there, then
they can trade me. I ain't going
out there to hurt myself in
spring training battling fora

Bell hit .173, he was notified that there would be
competition for his outfield job. Derek Bell failed

1975 against the Astros. Torre, hitting in the third
spot behind Felix Millian. would follow Millian's
4-for-4 game by subsequently grounding into four
double plays. The Mets lost 6-2.
3. Rick Pitino can't cut it in the NBA.
"Larry Bird is not walking through that door,

door and Robert Parish is not walking through
that door. And if you expect them to walk through
