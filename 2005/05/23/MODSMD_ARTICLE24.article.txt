## Fade into Bolivian Torre, Tyson go on the record 
### 
Today's column will investigate some of the
best sports quotes over the past 30 years.
1. Derek Bell — Operation Shutdown
"Nobody told me I was in competition. If there
is competition, somebody better let me know. If

there is competition, they bet
ter eliminate me out of the race
and go ahead and do what
they're going to do with me. I
ain't never hit in spring train
ing, and I never will. If it ain't
settled with me out there, then
they can trade me. I ain't going
out there to hurt myself in
spring training battling fora
job. If it is [a competition], then

I'm going into 'Operation Shutdown.' Tell them
exactly what I said. I haven't competed fora job
since 1991."
Following an excellent 2(X)1 season, in which
Bell hit .173, he was notified that there would be
competition for his outfield job. Derek Bell failed
to make the Pirates in 2(X)1 and has since retired.
2. Joe Torre — Let's turn two
"What's everyone blaming me for? Blame
Felix. I wouldn't have hit into the double-plays if
he hadn't hit singles."
Before former Giants catcher Double-Play AJ
Pierzynski (trivia: AJ holds the NL record for
most double plays grounded into by a left-handed
hitter, with a staggering 27 in 2004), there was the
Mets' Joe Torre, who tied a Major League record
by grounding into four double plays on July 21,
1975 against the Astros. Torre, hitting in the third
spot behind Felix Millian. would follow Millian's
4-for-4 game by subsequently grounding into four
double plays. The Mets lost 6-2.
3. Rick Pitino can't cut it in the NBA.
"Larry Bird is not walking through that door,
fans. Kevin McHale is not walking through that
door and Robert Parish is not walking through
that door. And if you expect them to walk through


Neil Davis
that door, they're going to get grav and
old."
After leading Kentucky to the I*W5
NCAA Title, Pitino accepted a head
coaching position with the woeful
Boston Celtics. Unhappy with crowd
support and media criticism of his
coaching, Pitino advised the Celtics
Nation that in lieu of Larry Legend.
Antoine Walker would lead the team
to greatness. After driving the franchise

into the ground, he resigned his posi
tion during the middle of the 2(K)1 sea
son.
4. Jim Mora — Playoffs?
"Playoffs? Don't talk about play
offs. Are you kidding me? Playoffs?!?!
I'm just hoping we can win a game, an
other game."
Alter a 40-21 loss to San Francisco
on Nov. 25.2001, the Colts stood at 4-6.
Ihe Colts would finish the season 6-10
and fail to make the playoffs. Tony
Dungy replaced Mora as the head
coach of the Colts the following year.
5. Allen Iverson —2002 news confer

ence following a missal practice.
"We're talking about practice.
We're talking about practice. We're not
talking about the game. We're talking
about practice." ITiis quotation was
soon followed by Iverson asking the
media in all seriousness: "How in the
hell can I make my teammates better
by practicing?"
Iverson has yet to win an N BATitle.
6. Mike Tyson — Anything. Ever.
Jim Gray: Mike were you really sick
this week? What was the problem?
I'yson: I broke my back.
Gray: What do you mean by that?
You broke your | interrupted j

Tyson: My back is broken.
Gray: What part? A vertebrae ...
or, uh, what portion?
Tyson: Well, spinal.
Alter sending Clifford Etienne,
a.k.a. The Black Rhino, down for the
count just 49 seconds into the bout,
Tyson was asked how he was feeling.
Luckily, unlike the crappy fight that
had just ensued.Tvson made the best of
the situation and dropped this gem of a
quotation.
7. Tirade of former Cubs Manager, Lee
Elia — April 29,1983
"They're really, really behind you
around here ... rnv f—in' ass. What

the f— am I supposed to do, go out
there and let my f —in' players get de
stroyed even,' day and he quiet about
it? For the f —in' nickel-dime people
who turn up? The mother!—ers don't
even work. That's why they're out at
the f—in' game. They oughta go out
and get a f —in' job and find out what
it's like to go out and earn a f—in' liv
ing. Eighty-five percent of the f—in'
world is working.The other 15 percent
come out here."
Following a 5-14 start to the season,
and a one-run home loss to the
Dodgers, Elia critiqued the "support"
that Cubs fans have been offering the
team. 1 counted 35 f-bombs in the press

conference.
8. Fat-ass, mullet-sporter, baseball player
and a man who possesses one testiele,
John Kruk
"I'm not an athlete. I'm a profes
sional baseball player."
