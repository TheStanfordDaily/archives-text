### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford Softball team is com
ing home. Senior Leah Nelson's three-run
home run lifted the Cardinal to a 3-2 win yes
terday over the No. 16 Missouri Tigers (44-
15) in NCAA Regional action, moving Stan
ford on to next weekend's Super Regionals
at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium.
Sixth-seeded Stanford looked like the fa

vorite heading into the weekend's matchups
against Robert Morris and No. 22 Southern
Illinois, and the Cardinal filled the role ac
cordingly in the first and second round
games Friday and Saturday.
By playing small ball, Stanford scored
nine runs against Robert Morris on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Colonials, who were making
their first appearance in the NCAA Tourna-

to play No. 11 Tennessee in the Super Regionals.
ment, failed to capitalize on the few
scoring opportunities they had.
Robert Morris got back-to-back
hits in the first from the hot bat of
Jill Spargo and Crystal Herman and
a hit batsmen put three Colonials on
with one out. However. Stanford's
freshman ace Becky McCullough
got out of the bases-loaded jam and
did not allow another hit in her three
additional innings of work.
With a five-run lead in the fourth
inning, junior Laura Severson came
in to relieve McCullough and kept
the shutout going with two scoreless
innings of work.
Stanford went to work early
against the Colonials, getting consec
utive hits from the top of the order.
Junior centerfielder Catalina Morris
got an infield single, junior shortstop
Lauren Lappin followed with a bunt
and freshman third baseman
Michelle Smith brought them in with
a two-run single up the middle.
The small ball continued in the
second when the top of the order
came to bat again. With senior
Katherine Hoffman at second after a
single and a steal. Morris' second hit

put runners at the corners. A wild
pitch by the Colonials' Danielle
Cohen, whose 1.37 ERA has carried
Robert Morris this season, brought
in another run to make the score 3-0.
With the help of a couple bloop
singles, walks and errors, Stanford
took a 7-0 lead in the fifth. Senior
first baseman Elizabeth Bendig fi
nally found the long ball in the sixth.
Bendig's first home run of the sea
son, a two-run shot to leftfield,
ended the game bv the mercy rule.
Stanford handed Cohen her first
loss in 14 decisions.
Against Southern Illinois on Sat
urday, the Cardinal almost saw a re
peat of Friday night's game. Stanford
once again dominated its opponent,
9-1, though this time the runs came
from long drives and home runs.
Senior catcher Leah Nelson had
an impressive day at the plate, going
3-for-4 and hitting two home runs.
Her four RBI helped Stanford take
the lead and then extend it after the
game was tied at one in the third.
Nelson's double to centerfield
brought in a Stanford run, and by
the end of the third the Cardinal of
fense had notched two more runs.
Two innings later. Nelson hit her
first home run of the afternoon â€” a
shot to right with Smith aboard.
In the seventh inning. Nelson
found herself at the plate again

against Erica Peterson, and again
put the ball over the rightfield fence.
Nelson's shot followed Smith's 19th
home run of the season and gave the
Cardinal back-to-back dingers and
the finishing touch on their second
day of regional play.
McCullough tossed all seven in
nings, scattering five hits. Salati Amy
Harre gave up three runs in two and
2 / 3 innings of work and took the
loss.
Nelson played another key role
in the Regional's final game against
Missouri.Though she was only 1 -for
3, Nelson's hit couldn't have been
timelier.
McCullough went the distance
yet again though the Tigers initially
looked like they would have her
number. After Bruck walked. Mis
souri's Micaela Minner hit a home
run to center for an early 2-0 lead.
Minner's 16th home run this year set
a new Missouri single-season
record.
Stanford held Missouri scoreless
from that point on and Nelson's
three-run shot in the third proved to
be the difference.
Stanford next takes on No. 11
Tennessee at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium in a best-of-three
game series fora spot in the
Women's College World Series
starting on Friday.
