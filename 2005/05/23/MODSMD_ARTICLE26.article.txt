Avery Aquatic Center's Belardi Fool
has welcomed its share of Olympians
through the years. But rarely so many as
there were this weekend, as Stanford host
ed the inaugural Stanford Invitational
Grand Prix Swim Meet, a long-course me
ters tuneup for the upcoming internation
al season.
The meet was headlined by Athens
medalists Michael Phelps, Natalie Cough
lin and Klete Keller. Phelps brought home

eight Olympic medals (six gold), Coughlin
won live (two gold) and Keller added two
(one gold) to bring his career haul to four.
l"he big stars were also joined by Stan
ford's own 2004 Olympians — freshman
Caroline Bruce, juniors Kristen Caverly
and Dana Kirk and silver medalist Tara
Kirk, Class of 2004.
Phelps was the darling of the meet, in
citing screams from the crowds of fans,
young and old. who filled the temporary
bleachers beside the pool. As was expect
ed. he won every event he entered, going
home with six new iPods, the prize given to
each race winner. Some fans went home
with something special, too. as the top
three finishers in each race were given T
shirts and souvenir swim caps to throw into
the crowd. When it was Phelps' turn, chil

dren crowded forward and adult fans were
on their feet, ready to dive fora Phelps
thrown shirt.
Phelps won the 100-meter freestyle and
200-meter butterfly — an event in which
he holds the world record — on Friday, the
400-meter free and 200-meter backstroke
Saturday. He also won two events on Sun
day, the 100-meter backstroke and the 400-
meter individual medley — another event
in which he is the record-holder. In his first
four wins, he set three pool records, all by
more than a second.

in the 100-meter backstroke in Athens, did
not swim in her signature event, but did
compete in the 200-meter individual med-
