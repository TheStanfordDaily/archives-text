# Wildcats take series from the Card
## Arizona takes two of three in the final home series of the season 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
When facing No. 8 Arizona (36-17.16-5
Pacific-10). it can often feel like a game of
catch up. This weekend, in a key Pacific-10
Conference series, the Cardinal (31-21.11-

10) were successful in staying ahead of the
blistering Arizona bats once, but in two
other contests couldn't quite hang with the
offensive explosion.
Arizona, which came into the weekend
leading the Pac-10 in nearly every offen
sive category, once again put on a show,
scoring 25 runs in three games at Sunken
Diamond — including 11 runs in an 11-8
victory over the Cardinal in Sunday's rub
ber match.
In a game that featured a combined 32
hits and 43 baserunners, Stanford seemed
to be chasing Arizona all afternoon long,
but could never quite take the lead.

The big blow for the Cardinal came in
the top of the fourth inning when the Wild
cats tacked on six runs to break a 2-2 tie.
With junior reliever Blake Holler on the
mound, Arizona started the inning off with
a hit by pitch and a double before second
baseman Brad Boyer smacked a two-run
double into rightfield.T\vo batters later and
with two outs, an uncharacteristic throwing
error by junior second baseman Jed
Lowrie allowed the inning to continue. Ari
zona would score three more runs before
freshman pitcher Erik Davis was able to re-
tire the designated hitter Derek De
cater. who led off the frame, to end
the inning.
But the C ardinal did not go down
quietly. Trailing 9-2 in the bottom of
the fifth, Stanford picked up four
runs, highlighted by a solo home run
from sophomore third baseman
Adam Sorgi, and added two more in
the sixth to cut the lead to one.They
had the tying run on base after
Lowrie drove in a run on an error by
Wildcats third baseman Bryan
Kervin, hut were unable to score him
from first.
Arizona answered right back in the
top of the seventh scoring two runs, in
cluding one on an RBI triple by left
fielder Trevor Crowe. The triple was
Crowe's 13th of the season, which sets
a new Pac-10 record. Ihe hit was also
Crowe's l()Oth of the year.
The three-run deficit was simply
too much for the Cardinal to over
come in the final three frames, as Ari
zona closer Mark Melancon came in
and got the final five outs of the
game.
Melancon, who pitched in all
three games of a weekend series for
the first time this year, played a piv
otal role in Saturday's contest as well,
but that outing wasn't nearly as suc
cessful.
With two outs and sophomore cen
terfielder Jim Rapoport on second
base, junior shortstop Chris Minaker
laced a pitch from Melancon into left
field to drive in the winning run and
give Stanford a thrilling 5-4 victory.
With none out in the bottom of
the ninth Rapoport singled and then
stole second.The bottom of the Stan
ford lineup made two quick outs be
fore Melancon intentionally walked
Sorgi. Minaker then grounded a 2-2
pitch through the left side for the
winning hit.
While Minaker's hit ended the
game, it would not have been possi
ble without some cluteh pitching
from sophomore reliever Cireg
Reynolds.
With no outs and two runners on
base in the top of the ninth. Reynolds
entered the game in relief of junior
closer Matt Manship. After a sacrifice
bunt and a hit batsman Reynolds
faced a one-out, bases loaded jam,
with the heart of the Wildcat lineup
coming to the plate. Jordan Brown
worked the count lull against Reny
olds, but the Stanford righthander
dropped in a curveball for strike
three. He got the next hitter Nick
Hundley to pop out to escape thy in
ning
"That's the spot that every pitcher
dreams about being in," Reynolds
said in a press release."You just have
to throw strikes and trust all your
pitches."

In Friday night's contest Arizona
gave* the large Stanford crowd a dou
ble dose of fireworks — putting up
nine runs in an offensive explosion to
go along with the fireworks that illu
minated the night sky above Sunken
Diamond after the game.
Junior starter Jeff Ciilmore. who
had pitched sensationally since mov
ing into the Friday night starting spot,
had one of the worst outings of his ca
reer, giving up a career high 13 hits
and nine runs, eight of which where
earned, in 7 1 / 3 innings.
The big inning for the Wildcats
came in the third when they pushed
across six runs off of Gilmore. Ari
zona sent 11 hitters to the plate and
the inning only ended when Decater
lined into a double-play.
Stanford scored two runs in the
bottom half of the frame on a two
RBI single tocenterfield by Minaker,

hut the Cardinal could only add two
more runs in the final six innings and
the Wildcats went on to win
The Cardinal close out the regular
season next weekend at No. 21 USC,
which dropped its series this week
end against Oregon State 2-1. With
the two losses this weekend Stanford
fell into a three-way tie for fifth place
in the Pac-10 with Cal and Washing
ton.
While it is unlikely that Stanford
will host a regional, Stanford must
wait until next Monday to find out its
postseason fate.
"We're capable of playing well in
the postseason and beating anyone
on a given day, but we're also capable
of getting beat by anyone," said head
coach Mark Marquess in a postgame
interview. "We know what it takes to
play against good teams, because we
have done that this year."

Arizona answered right back in the
top of the seventh scoring two runs, in
cluding one on an RBI triple by left
fielder Trevor Crowe. The triple was
Crowe's 13th of the season, which sets
a new Pac-10 record. Ihe hit was also
Crowe's l()Oth of the year.
The three-run deficit was simply
too much for the Cardinal to over
come in the final three frames, as Ari
zona closer Mark Melancon came in
and got the final five outs of the
game.
Melancon, who pitched in all
three games of a weekend series for
the first time this year, played a piv
otal role in Saturday's contest as well,
but that outing wasn't nearly as suc
cessful.
With two outs and sophomore cen
terfielder Jim Rapoport on second
base, junior shortstop Chris Minaker
laced a pitch from Melancon into left
field to drive in the winning run and
give Stanford a thrilling 5-4 victory.
With none out in the bottom of
the ninth Rapoport singled and then
stole second.The bottom of the Stan
ford lineup made two quick outs be
fore Melancon intentionally walked
Sorgi. Minaker then grounded a 2-2
pitch through the left side for the
winning hit.
While Minaker's hit ended the
game, it would not have been possi
ble without some cluteh pitching
from sophomore reliever Cireg
Reynolds.
With no outs and two runners on
base in the top of the ninth. Reynolds
entered the game in relief of junior
closer Matt Manship. After a sacrifice
bunt and a hit batsman Reynolds
faced a one-out, bases loaded jam,
with the heart of the Wildcat lineup
coming to the plate. Jordan Brown
worked the count lull against Reny
olds, but the Stanford righthander
dropped in a curveball for strike
three. He got the next hitter Nick
Hundley to pop out to escape thy in
ning
"That's the spot that every pitcher
dreams about being in," Reynolds
said in a press release."You just have
to throw strikes and trust all your
pitches."

In Friday night's contest Arizona
gave* the large Stanford crowd a dou
ble dose of fireworks — putting up
nine runs in an offensive explosion to
go along with the fireworks that illu
minated the night sky above Sunken
Diamond after the game.
Junior starter Jeff Ciilmore. who
had pitched sensationally since mov
ing into the Friday night starting spot,
had one of the worst outings of his ca
reer, giving up a career high 13 hits
and nine runs, eight of which where
earned, in 7 1 / 3 innings.
The big inning for the Wildcats
came in the third when they pushed
across six runs off of Gilmore. Ari
zona sent 11 hitters to the plate and
the inning only ended when Decater
lined into a double-play.
Stanford scored two runs in the
bottom half of the frame on a two
RBI single tocenterfield by Minaker,

hut the Cardinal could only add two
more runs in the final six innings and
the Wildcats went on to win
The Cardinal close out the regular
season next weekend at No. 21 USC,
which dropped its series this week
end against Oregon State 2-1. With
the two losses this weekend Stanford
fell into a three-way tie for fifth place
in the Pac-10 with Cal and Washing
ton.
While it is unlikely that Stanford
will host a regional, Stanford must
wait until next Monday to find out its
postseason fate.
"We're capable of playing well in
the postseason and beating anyone
on a given day, but we're also capable
of getting beat by anyone," said head
coach Mark Marquess in a postgame
interview. "We know what it takes to
play against good teams, because we
have done that this year."
