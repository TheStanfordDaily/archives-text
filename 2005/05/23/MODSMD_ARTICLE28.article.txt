## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
After months of hard work, count
less Stanford seniors have put the fin
ishing touches on their honors theses.
Twelve of these students presented
their findings on Friday at the Haas
Center for Public Service through the
Public Service Scholars Program.
The program, which provides
added academic support to accepted
students throughout the thesis-writing
process, is intended to encourage re
search related to public service efforts.
The topics presented at the event
ranged from mammogram usage
among Asian-American women to the
cultural impact of timber commercial
ization in Ecuador.
Senior Nithya Vaduganathan
spoke on the economics of elementary
education in India.
"I'm looking at what drives the
demand for primary education." said
Vaduganathan. an economics major.
She investigated whether or not
school administrators in Karnataka,
India, perceive the education system
as beneficial or costly. The presenta
tion was the culmination of not only
her thesis, but also a summer re
search project funded by the Under
graduate Research Office.
Several of the presenters said they
were happy to have the chance to
share their knowledge after laboring
away on their papers for so long.
"1 think it's a great opportunity to

demonstrate all our work and to
demonstrate to people of all back
grounds what I've been doing," said
senior Sirisha Narayana, a biology
major who discussed the application
of lipid microarrays in fighting multi
ple sclerosis. "It's really satisfying — it
makes me feel as if what I'm doing can
be relatively important in some shape
or form."
Vaduganathan echoed these senti
ments.
"I think it's just nice, because
you've spent so much time on this, to
share what you've learned and get
feedback from people," she said. "Ed
ucation in India is a topic I'm passion
ate about, so just to let other people
know what I've been doing for the past
quarter is itself a kind of fruit of my
labors."
The students added that knowl
edge of their respective topics is not all
they have gained from the experience.
"The process of doing research is
really valuable," Vaduganathan said.
"It's how to take a big problem and
just break it down. It's very much an in
dividual process, but writing a thesis at
a place like Stanford gave me an op
portunity to work with a breadth of
professors."
She added that her presentation al
lowed her work to be more accessible
than it is in paper form.
"The thesis is just a book or a big
stack of papers," Vaduganathan said.
"It's nice to have another way of dis
seminating my information."
