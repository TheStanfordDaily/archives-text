# Community develops More Brazilians settle in Bay Area
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Bay Area, home to 25,000 to 30,000 Brazilian
immigrants, is witnessing the rise of a distinct communi
ty, complete with cultural venues and markers, including
restaurants and public celebrations.
Denise Banks, who hails from Rio de Janeiro, works at
Stanford's Faculty Club and said it has been easier to
meet other Brazilians in the Bay Area than in other areas
of the country where she has lived, including New York
and Washington D.C. She moved here in February.
"I've certainly had the chance to meet many more
Brazilians here than in any other place I lived before,"
she wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I can find Brazilians
at the mall, the gym, at Stanford, but I don't know yet
about it being a strong community."
But already this growing community has manifested
itself in the appearance of Brazilian restaurants, grocery
stories, the popularity of capoeira — a Brazilian martial
art — samba schools and cultural festivals, such as San
Francisco's Carnaval, scheduled for
May 29. There are also several local
newspapers and magazines for
Brazilian residents written in
Portuguese.
Sophomore Alexis Dixon will be
participating in the Carnaval this
year as a model fora Jamaican cos
tume company.
"I'm really excited because I've
never participated in a Carnaval,"
she said. "Any Caribbean country
with a strong African influence has a
Carnaval, so the costumes [in
Jamaica and Brazil] are very similar.
1 usually go to Carnaval when I'm in
New York."
Stanford even boasts its own
Brazilian Students' Association and
capoeira club. The undergraduate
Brazilian community is very close
knit. said Jose Benchimol, a fresh
man from Manaus, Brazil. There are
fewer than a dozen undergraduates
from the country, he said, but there
are many more Brazilian graduate
students.
He added that most of the
Brazilians in the Bay Area come
from the southern part of the
nation.
A Web site similar to

Thefacebook.com called Orkut.com
is a common way for Brazilians in
the Bay Area to network,
Benchimol said.
Banks said she has met many
Brazilians from the Northeast
region of Brazil, working in all vari
ety of fields; some are students, oth
ers manage offices and some clean
houses. The community is not very
organized. Banks said, but she hopes
to explore more of what it has to
offer in the future.
Benchimol said he does not
know why there has been a surge in
Brazilian immigration in past years,
but cited a soap opera currently run
ning in Brazil called "America,"
which illustrates the plight of
Brazilian immigrants who have
arrived in the United States.
Ronaldo Estefam de Sa, known as
Mestre Beicola to his students, has
taught the capoeira class at Stanford
for many years and said he has seen
gradual changes in the Brazilian com
munity. Also an immigrant, he said the
Bay Area's Brazilian community is
incredibly diverse, including students,
both long- and short-term workers
and many pizza or newspaper deliv
ery people, who come fora short
amount of time before returning
home.
Beicola currently instructs about
200 students in the Bay Area in both
capoeira and samba. He estimates
that there are about 25 other teachers

in the region. Several of his students
now work with him at his Silicon
Valley-based school, Capoeira
Narahari. He also has studios in Rio
de Janeiro, his hometown, where he is
opening a new cultural center called
Centro Cultural Artistico e
Educacional Brazivedas.
Construction on the center will
be completed this July, when sev
eral of Beicola's capoeira students
at Stanford head to Rio to tutor
English and take lessons in
capoeira and Portuguese. The
grand opening is slated for
February of next year.
Inspiration for the center grew
out of convenience — Beicola takes
two groups of students on exchange
to Rio every year.
"I realized that America has a lot
to offer Brazil, and at the same time
I realized that Brazil has a lot to
offer here," he said.
About seven of Beicola's current
students at Stanford are making
plans to go to Rio this summer, said
Lenny Pekelis, a freshman. Pekelis
will be in Rio for two weeks this sum
mer to work at Brazivedas and hopes
to get a Undergraduate Research
Opportunities grant to return next
year.
Banks said she misses the atmos
phere in Rio, where the air is lighter
and happier and people are really
warm. But the Bay Area has a simi
lar feel, she added.
