# Palo Alto 'anarchy' rally turns violent
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Police flashers lit up the streets
of downtown Palo Alto Friday
night as officers attempted to con
tain what participants called an
"anarchist" rally. Nearly 200 pro
testers — many clad in black hoods,
masks and bandanas — turned hos
tile during the "Reclaim the
Streets" party beginning at Lytton

Plaza, said a Palo Alto Police
Department report. No injuries
were reported, but the crowd
jumped on cars, turned over trash
cans and damaged several
University Ave. businesses.
One protester, William
O'Connor, a 19 year old from
Berkeley, was charged with smash
ing the window of American
Express with a large flagpole, stated
the report. Another suspect, a juve
nile, was cited with vandalism
charges and released to his parents.
Police could not be reached for
comment.
"This happens every year, hut
it's never been this big," said Keith
Dunckel, a sophomore from Palo
Alto High School who observed the
rally. "This year it's a big radical
movement."
The "Reclaim the Streets" party,
which began at 8:30 p.m., was ini
tially under control. Police had
been tipped off about the event

beforehand and directed traffic
while monitoring the crowd.
"It was just music and fun at the
beginning," said Stanford senior
Abbv Hall, who was in attendance.
"The cops were really cool at first.
They were just directing traffic —
they weren't really doing anything.
There was a speaker and an amp
and the music was great. Then the
crowd started to move and every
thing changed."
The protesters moved into the
streets and began chanting "Bombs
are dropping while you're shop
ping" and "Whose streets? Our
streets," said a post on the Web site
of The Paly Voice. Palo Alto High
School's student newspaper. At
first, passersby appeared more curi
ous than agitated.
By 9:30 p.m.. more than 30 police

officers had herded the crowd on to
Hamilton St.and closed off sections
of downtown streets — including
University Ave. —in an effort to
control the mass of high school and
college students. Armed with police
dogs and stun-guns, they eventually
pushed the crowd to Hamilton anil
Webster Streets, where the rally dis
persed.
Traffic was temporarily disrupt
ed and officers yelled at drivers
attempting to bypass the police offi
cers blocking streets.
For the more part, business on
University Ave. went undisturbed.
Some of the demonstrators
attempted to run through the
Borders Bookstore, but were
unable to do so when the store's
employees lowered the metal
gate.

Pam Parsons, manager of the
Borders, said the store was only
closed for 10 minutes before the
protesters moved on.
"It was an unremarkable event
for us," said Parsons, who was not
present during the protest. "The
customers were not disrupted."
Organized by the group
Anarchist Action, word of the
demonstration passed through e
mails, Stanford lists and fliers post
ed at local high schools.
"I would say it was about one
third Stanford students, one third
Berkeley students and one third
local high school students," said
Mike Thielvoldt, a Stanford junior
who observed the event."It was a
pretty big group covering a lot of
ground."
