# Summers criticizes the national deficit
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
In Encina Hall's ornate wood
lined Bechtel Conference Center last
Friday, Lawrence Summers, presi
dent of Harvard University and for
mer Secretary of the U.S. Treasury
Department, addressed a crowd of
some of the world's most influential
economists on the looming danger
posed by the nation's trade deficit.
Summers stuck to economics and

avoided discussing his controversial
comments earlier this year about the
under-representation of women in
the sciences. A vague joke was his
only reference to the lingering
imbroglio.
"When 1 returned to Harvard
[from the Treasury], people some
times asked me what the difference
was between being in Washington
and being at the university, and fora
month or two 1 was naive enough to
say. Well, Washington is very much
preoccupied with things that are
political,'" he said, eliciting laughs
from the audience.
Joined by famed economists
Kenneth Arrow and Milton
Friedman, Summers described what
he called "the most pressing short
term economic challenge facing the
United States: the set of issues sur
rounding the current large interna
tional imbalances."
The current accounts deficit —
essentially a measure of how much
money is (lowing out of the U.S.
economy to foreigners, either
through the trade of goods and serv
ices or interest payments — is now at
6 percent of the gross national prod
uct.'litis is more than twice the num
ber most economists consider

healthy and sustainable.
Furthermore, U.S. imports are
increasing faster than exports, widen
ing the trade deficit despite the
recent decline in the value of the dol
lar, which should make U.S. exports
cheaper to the rest of the world and
reduce the deficit.
"I'm aware of no serious model,
no serious student of the situation,
who believes that at current U.S.
exchange rates the current account
deficit is likely to do anything more
than remain steady," Summers said.
"And the balance of what seems to
be the most educated opinion is
that at current exchange rates and
desirable growth rates the U.S. cur
rent account deficit is likely to
increase."
Summers dismissed counter
arguments that counsel complacen
cy, including the idea that "we'll rip
the foreigners off' by allowing the
U.S. debt held by other countries,
denominated in dollars, to drop in
real value along with the value of
the currency.

Summers argued fora substantial
decrease in the federal budget deficit
as a tool for fighting the problem.
"As long as the United States
national savings rate is one percent,
there is no healthy path," he said.
"What we know is that the most
potent and reliable way to increase
national savings is to improve the fis
cal position."
Summers also argued for concrete
steps to increase demand in the rest
of the world. Currently, a 1 percent
rise in U.S. gross domestic product
increases U.S. imports by 2 percent,
while an equivalent rise in global
GDP increases U.S. exports by only 1
percent. Foreigners aren't as hungry
for American products as Americans
are for foreign ones.
In the question-and-answer peri
od, Friedman and Summers engaged
in a crowd-pleasing tete-a-tete, with
Summers paraphrasing a speech by a
"really smart economist" to answer
Friedman's question.
'ITiat "really smart economist," of
course, was Friedman.
