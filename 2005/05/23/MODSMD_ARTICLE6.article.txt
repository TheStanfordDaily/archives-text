into the San Jose Main Jail, Lee
said.
Exotic Erotic has historically
posed a challenge for police per
sonnel. Lee said.
"Traditionally they've had
problems of overcrowding, alco

hoi abuse, intoxication, fights
and assault," he added. "We get a
lot of people from the off-cam
pus area who just come to be
there and see what's happening.
And problems can arise that way
too."
He said that this year was bet
ter compared to years past.
"[Security] had better control
of the entrance and access to the
party, but people were still trying
to circumvent it by climbing the

fences in back," he said.
Sophomore Jackie Hwang said
although security was tight at the
entrance, it didn't interfere with
her experience.
"During the night I didn't
notice the security," she said.
"They did a good job of keeping a
low profile."
Despite the four arrests and
partiers jumping the fence, the
event was not shut down until the
scheduled ending time of 1 a.m.
