# Radiology marks centennial

One hundred years ago, the average American
life expectancy was 47, and 90 percent of doctors
had no college education. Today, doctors can use
3-dimensional visualization techniques and com
puter-aided detection to seek out polyps before
they become malignant tumors.
Such stark contrasts were the focus of a speech
delivered bv Gary Glazer, chairman of radiology

at the Stanford Medical Center, during the
department's exhibition symposium on Saturday.
The event, entitled "One Hundred Years of
Making Radiology History." was co-hosted by the
Departments of Radiology and Radiation
Oncology to celebrate a century of Stanford's
contribution to these fields.
"The World of Stanford Radiology," explains
that Stanford radiology technically began in 18%


Philip A. Pizzo
when the Cooper-Lane Medical
School, renamed the Stanford
School of Medicine, bought its
first X-ray machine. The
Department of Radiology was
founded eight years later.
It rose to new heights in IIMXl l MX
with the arrival of Department
Chairman Henry S. Kaplan, who
placed more emphasis on research
introduced the use of animals to
examine the causes and develop
ment of cancer. He also cooperat
ed with Stanford physicists to
open the medical linear accelera
tor. now the main source of radia
tion treatment for various types of
cancer.
Kaplan also lobbied to move
the school from San Francisco to
its current location in Palo Alto,
where it could be more closely
integrated with the other science
departments on campus.
Saturday's event detailed this
history, looking back on past suc
cesses as the foundation for future
achievements.
"We can certainly look back to
where we've been and look for
ward with excitement to the years
ahead." said Philip Pi/.zo, dean of
the School of Medicine, in his
opening comments.
Hie day began with tours of
the Richard M. Lucas Center for
Magnetic Resonance
Spectroscopy and Imaging, as well
as an exhibition complete with
posters describing some of the
major achievements of Stanford
radiology.
The symposium kicked off in
the early afternoon, examining
the current role of radiation in the
medical world, cutting-edge
research and whether or not soci

ety can afford personalized med
ical care.
One of the premier speakers,
Saul Rosenberg, medical profes
sor emeritus, discussed his work
on a cure for Hodgkin's disease.
When he began his research, there
was a 60 percent survival rate for
the disease. Since then, it has risen
to 90 percent.
Richard Hoppe, chair of the
Radiation Oncology
Department, talked about
advances in the field. One was
intensity modulated radiothera
py. a technique in which the
machine can send different levels
of radiation to highly specific
parts of the body. If there were a
tumor in the neck, for example,
the machine could send high lev
els of radiation to the tumor and
low levels to the spinal cord and
brain stem.
Hoppe and his colleague
Amato Garcia, director of the
division of cancer and radiation
biology, also spoke on a relatively
new method called respiratory
gating. For tumors located in mov
ing parts of the body, such as the
lungs, the machine can now turn
itself on and off, emitting radia
tion only when the tumor is locat
ed in its target zone and sparing
normal tissue.
Garcia very concisely summa
rized the goals of radiotherapy.
"Identify the target. Hit the
target. Avoid normal tissue com
plications." he said.
In an e-mail to The Daily,
Glazer said that Stanford radiolo
gy is unique in that its physicians
have connections to government
and industry leaders that believe
in them.
"We can build partnerships
forged by accomplishment and
trust to tackle and hopefully con
quer some of the most difficult
problems in medicine today." he
wrote.
