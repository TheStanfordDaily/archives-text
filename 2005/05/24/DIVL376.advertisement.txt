amusing, forlorn, stunning, and surreal. Of his approach to photography as a
young artist, Roma says, "Emily Dickinson and Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed
to write about what was going on in their lives, and I wanted to do something
similar in photography. I never questioned that what I wanted to photograph
was the actual stuff that made up my life, what shaped me."
