# New deal arranged with ABM
## Company chosen to contract Univ. maintenance 
### SARA INÉS CALDERÓN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford administrators have issued a letter of
intent to sign a new contract with American Building
Maintenance, or ABM. Under this contract, ABM will
provide janitorial services at Stanford for the next five
years. The company has been working for the
University for the past 10 years, and the fact that
ABM was re-contracted is significant because no
workers currently employed will lose their jobs.
ABM beat out at least a dozen similar companies
for the contract in a bidding process that began in
September.
About 100 workers will be employed under this
contract, said Alan Cummings, associate director of
University Facilities Operations. The agreement, cur
rently under negotiation, is a new contract, not simply
an extension of the old one, and will include a 3 to 5
percent increase in the workforce, he said.
"There will be an increase in the number of work
ers," Cummings said, "certainly not less workers."
ABM janitors work in 300 academic buildings on
campus and most work at night. There are also some
employees who perform maintenance operations dur
ing the day in high-traffic buildings such as
Wallenberg Hall and Green Library.
The contracted employees will not work in campus
residences or the School of Medicine buildings.

Doroteo Garcia is a union steward at the
Service Employees International Union Local
1877, which represents ABM workers on campus.
He said the workers will be pleased that the con
tract has been awarded to ABM because it will
secure some of the special programs the company
offers, including the company-paid English tutor
ing program for employees.
"We're happy that ABM will continue because it

ensures job security for our coworkers," Garcia said.
"We're also happy because we have had a good rela
tionship with ABM."
Junior Joseles de la Cruz, a coordinator for the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition, or SLAC, said the
decision would not affect its work.
"We don't care what company it is as long as they
