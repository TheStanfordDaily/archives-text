## Roosevelt Review soon to be released 
### DANIELLE LOSTAUNAU 
The Roosevelt Institution, the student-run
think tank, will release its first compilation of
policy papers this summer, said Executive
Director Quinn Wilhelmi, a sophomore.
The publication, entitled the "Roosevelt
Review: Roosevelt's National Research
Journal," will be issued annually, he added.
I"he journal will be distributed to every U.S.
Congress member by mail, and Roosevelt
Institution President Kai Stinchcombe, a politi
cal science graduate student, said that the think
tank's leaders hope to hand-deliver copies to as
many state representative offices as possible.
Stinchcombe said that the Institution's goal
is to make sure that the Roosevelt Review finds
its way into the hands of policymakers, business
leaders, activists and students interested in pub
lic service.
Wilhelmi added that the journal is also
intended to advance the Institution's broader

mission.
"What we are trying to do is take the stu
dent's work one step further," he said.
Stinchcombe echoed this enthusiasm.
"We are putting together a great collection
of essays, dissertations and research papers," he
said. "We're making sure that the distribution
will happen and that people who are actually
able to make a change in our political system
receive our work."
He also stressed the quality of the work
scheduled to appear in the Roosevelt Review,
adding that the students' ideas are as legitimate
so those of "grown-ups."
"We want policymakers to learn about what
we are doing," Stinchcombe said. "We have the
intellectual capital to run the show. We students
have worked really hard on these research
papers and we know exactly what we are talking
about."
He added that members of Congress are well
aware of the high quality of student research

papers. Fresh ideas and perspectives are always
in demand, he said.
"What most students don't know is that
politicians are actually looking for their ideas
and they want to hear from them," Stinchcombe
said.
The students involved in the project also said
they believe that even high-profile politicians
will support the venture.
"I think that the best motivation to submit
your work to the Roosevelt Review is to know
that members of Congress will actually read and
use your work," said Margot Ismam, a fresh
man.
Stinchcombe and Wilhelmi have extended
the student submissions deadline, which was ini
tially set for May 22. They have not yet decided
on another date.
Publishing the journal will cost the
Institution between $10,()(M) and $20,(KM), the
bulk of which leaders hope to pay with dona
tions the group has received.
