# Medicinal marijuana may be legalized in CA

### VANESSA STUMPF THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS,CaIif. — A highly anticipated
Supreme Court decision on the future of medici
nal marijuana, expected any day, could provide
definitive guidance on an issue that has been any
thing hut straightforward.
I"he decision in Ashcroft v. Raich could aid
California, embroiled in conflicting opinion over
whether federal or state law should dictate the
use of medicinal marijuana.
At the center of the California's controversy is
state Attorney General Bill Lockyer. Advocacy
groups for medicinal marijuana like Oakland's
Americans for Safe Access allege that Lockyer
has failed to protect citizens' rights under the
Compassionate Use Act. That initiative, passed in
19%, allowed Californians to obtain and use
medicinal marijuana with the recommendation of
a physician for ailments like cancer, AIDS,
anorexia, glaucoma and arthritis.
"We would like to see a legal opinion [from
Lockyerj issued clarifying law enforcement's obli
gation to follow state over federal law," said Steph
Sherer, Executive Director of ASA. "Elected offi
cials [in California] have written Lockyer and
asked him to clarify the issue of state's obligation to
follow state law and he has refused to do so."

While some pro-medicinal marijuana advo
cates would like to see individual county law
enforcement following state law under Lockyer's
orders, his office says it is out of their hands.
"Where we really need to go is to change fed
eral law, that's where the problem is," said Teresa
Schilling, spokesperson for Lockyer. "The con
flict is with [former U.S. Attorney General] John
Ashcroft, not Bill Lockyer."
Ashcroft's opposition to California's law,
along with Drug Enforcement Administration
Administrator Karen Tandy, brought a lawsuit
from Angel McClary Raich of Oakland in 2002,
charging that Ashcroft and the federal govern
ment had "unconstitutionally exceeded their
authority" by seizing her privately grown medici
nal marijuana and then allegedly arresting, pros
ecuting, and harassing California medicinal mari
juana patients and caregivers.
Sherer called those actions scare tactics
against people trying to utilize medicinal mari
juana, and argued that even in the aftermath of a
possible Supreme Court ruling in favor of Raich,
a culture of resistance from law enforcement
against medicinal marijuana could remain.
According to Schilling, Lockyer wants to
uphold California's law to its fullest potential, but
also wants to give local county law enforcement
the discretion to enforce this law as they wish.

Conflicting legal opinions coming from different
levels of government have made this difficult.
"As long as [medicinal marijuana] is fully ille
gal at a federal level it will be difficult for local
law enforcement and puts pressure on them to
interpret the law," said Schilling.
Schilling suggested that especially until there
is a clarification of law. there should be a
statewide identification system that will prove to
law enforcement throughout the state when a cit
izen is a legitimate user of medicinal marijuana.
This could help decrease complaints from
patients who feel they are unjustly treated when
they leave their home counties and show unfa
miliar identification.
Davis Police Department spokesperson Lt.
Colleen Turav says if there is any doubt of the
legitimacy of using marijuana for medicinal pur
poses, cases are deferred to the Volo District
Attorney's office.
"If the use seems reasonable we won't do any
thing," said Turay. "If there is no suspicion that
this isn't somebody selling or using it inappropri
ately and there's a medical card, we won't have
any problems if it's within the home."
Tliray noted that if someone is found with
marijuana for any usage in a vehicle, police will
make an arrest and seize the drugs as a case of
driving under the influence.
