## Interest in spirituality spreads across univ. campuses

(U-WIRE) ATHENS, Ohion —
On college campuses across the coun
try, students are becoming increasing
ly engaged in religion and spirituality,
according to a report released by the
Higher Education Research Institute
at the University of California at Los
Angeles last month.
Three-fourths of students sur
veyed are "searching for
meaning/purpose in life," eight in 10
attended a religious service during
the past year, more than two-thirds
pray and four in 10 consider it "very
important" that they adhere to reli
gious teachings in everyday life.
Ohio University keeps similar
statistics for its student body. In
2004-2005, 62 percent of first-year
students said that spiritual develop
ment was an important part of
adjusting to college and 81 percent
said that it was also important to
develop personal values and beliefs,
according to a report on the Office
of Institutional Research Web site
(www.ohiou.edu/instres/involve/ind
ex.html).
UCLA's national study, "The
Spiritual Life of College Students: A
National Study of College Students'
Search for Meaning and Purpose,"
was designed to "enhance under
standing of how college students con
ceive spirituality, the role it plays in
their lives and how colleges and uni
versities can play a more effective role
in facilitating students' spiritual devel
opment," according to the report.
Funded by the John Templeton
Foundation, a nonprofit organiza
tion that "encourages the moral and
spiritual dimensions of life," the
study encompassed more than
112,000 students attending 236 col
leges and universities.
The fall 2004 College Students'

Beliefs and Values Survey, from
which the findings were drawn, was
administered to first-year students in
addition to a traditional freshman
survey conducted by another UCLA
research program. A follow-up sur
vey will be administered in 2(X)7 to
track how attitudes about spirituality
and religion have changed.
Responses were examined
according to 12 predetermined
scales — three measures of spiritu
ality, five of religiousness and four
other dimensions expected to be
related to each. Those scales were
then used to map trends within var
ious demographics such as religious
denomination and political affilia
tion, as well as those related to over
all physical and mental well-being.
Though many consider measures
of spirituality and religion to be
closely related, the two have dis
cernable differences.
Alexander Keefe, a professor in
the Department of Classics and
World Religions, said that religion
commonly refers to adhering to
some traditional set of beliefs.
Spirituality, on the other hand, does
n't necessarily require religious
affiliation, but rather a belief in
something bigger than yourself.
In a previous interview, Lynn
Miller, pastor of Christ Lutheran
Church also touched upon the dis
tinction.
"Religion for many people rep
resents only the hierarchical institu
tion. Spirituality emphasizes for
many people more the personal
seeking," she said.
According to the project's Web
site (www.spirituality.ucla.edu), spiri
tuality also reflects our "values and
ideals, sense of who we are and where
we came from, and beliefs about why
we are here." That notion "captures
those aspects of our experience that
are not easy to define or talk about,
such as inspiration, creativity, the mys
terious, the sacred and the mystical."
Despite these differences, spiri
tuality and religion are still closely
related. According to the report,
students who are strongly religious
also tend to be highly spiritual on all
measurements.
