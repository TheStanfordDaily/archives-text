## How it all changed 
### DANIEL BERDICHEVSKY 
At dinner tonight, a high school sen
ior I was dining with was aghast at the
idea of someone going to Europe on her
own. "It would be like driving without a
cell phone," she said to me, between
bites of a BLT sandwich. "So danger
ous"
Having both gone to Europe on my
own and driven for years without a cell
phone, I felt lucky to have lived this
long. And I didn't have the heart to tell
her that 1 got my first ticket (for an ille
gal left turn) driving out of the cell
phone shop parking lot.
Yes — I was playing with the buttons.
Only one person I knew had a cell
phone in high school. His parents used it
to track him down at night, thereby in
terrupting our breakfasts at Denny's
and our various exploits with the school
keys. They made up for it by taking us
out to sushi.
Now I carry my cell phone every
where (though I've resisted PDAs and
iPods, both of which are bound to even
tually become part of our cell phones
anyway). When I graduate from the
Kennedy School of Government in two
weeks, I'll be traveling with it to Boston
on a flight I booked at the American
Airlines Web site, aa.com, staying with it
at a hotel 1 booked on Priceline.com and
will be carrying a laptop with a Verizon
wireless card.
Nowadays, this sounds passe. But
then I look back again and remember
that I didn't even have an e-mail address
until 1 got to college.
The first day of Orientation, I shot off
a message to a friend at UC-San Diego.
We had been told that starting college
meant losing touch with almost every
one in your past life. That wouldn't hap
pen to us, my friends and I figured: This
new e-mail thing would keep us con
nected.
It mostly did. I think we remained
more closely-knit than if we had gone
our separate ways just a couple years
earlier. I can only imagine how much
more true that might have been if we'd
had Live Journals, free nights and week
ends for the cell phone and the Theface
book.com.
I only discovered the World Wide
Web at the start of my sophomore year.
It was a barren place. No Napster, just a
few pioneering class Web sites. Ama
zon.com was two months old — and had
been around several weeks longer than
Internet Explorer. The term "cable
modem" made us think of modems with
cables sticking out of them, and DSL
sounded like some kind of foreign ship
ping company. Hotmail was what hap
pened when you sent a letter to Arizona.
But it wasn't just the Internet that
was different then. Californians had
only recently discovered the appeal of
blending fruits, yogurt and ice to make
smoothies (to the delight of a fledgling
company called Juice Club.) The SAT
still had analogies. Bookstores were
places where people bought books and
an animated movie signified something
hand-drawn — not Shrek but Beauty
and the Beast. Airlines served meals and
your parents could walk you to your de
parture gate. Buffy hadn't slain any
vampires yet — at least not on TV.
Back then, there were no TVs in
Tresidder, let alone flat screens. You had
to file paper forms to get pretty much
anything done, from transcript requests
to selecting your classes. The parking lot
didn't take credit cards. And people who
regularly snacked on FroYo from the
now defunct CoPo were busy founding
companies with equally Stanford-esque
names — like Yahoo!.
By now I probably sound primeval,
but I graduated from Stanford not that
long ago — in 2002 (true, I took two
years off along the way). Some of you
were around then; you probably remem
ber how poorly cell phones worked on
campus even at the start of the 21st cen
tury. None of this was very long ago.
Still, there are times when I look
back at my original Stanford days (be
cause there are bound to be more) and
miss that palpable sense of opportunity
in the air, that feeling that tomorrow
hadn't been shaped yet — and that we
would be the ones to shape it. Every few
weeks it seemed another friend had left
Stanford to join a start-up or had come
back post-IPO to recruit the rest of us.
But then I remember that in one
sense or another. Stanford's probably al
ways been that way — and still is. Our
"wind of freedom" continues to blow to
wards the future (though not always to
ward Washington) and from our place on
the Farm (or the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter) we get to help make the weather.

This fall, Daniel Rerdichevsky will be
traveling overland (on his own, hut with a
cell phone) from Malaysia to Madrid. For
details, e-mail him at dan@demidec.com.
