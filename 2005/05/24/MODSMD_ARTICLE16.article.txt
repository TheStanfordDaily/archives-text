# Google hits the business world: Variety of services keep Google a friend of Wall Street
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
That many of Google's services are
free — including the search engine,
Google Maps and Gmail — may have
some Internet users wondering how the
Mountain View, Calif.-based company is
as profitable as it is. At market closing
time on yesterday, the company's stocks
were $255 a share, nearly three times as
much as they were when the company
went public last August. The answer is
simple: advertising.
A search for "Los Angeles bars" will
not only yield 4,760,000 Web sites in
about 0.67 seconds, but will also pro
duce four "sponsored links" on the
right-hand side of the Web page. It is
through this kind of targeted advertis
ing that companies profit — each time
an Internet user clicks on any of the ad
vertisements sponsored by Google, the
company makes money. And that is how

Google's search engine has proved to be
a successful money-making tool: com
panies pay Google to match their adver
tisements to specific Web pages.
Through its AdSense program, Google
displays ads on a Web site by matching
key words with services or products of
fered by Web merchants.
Vice President of Product Manage
ment Jonathan Rosenberg, who spoke
at a press event at the company's
"Googleplex" on May 24, said he re
members speaking to Google Co-
Founder Larry Page during Google's
early days about the future of the com
pany. Page predicted that Internet
searching would be the most profitable
service on the Web.
But Google has extended into the
business world far beyond the advertis
ing realm. Over the last few months,
Google has introduced a variety of
products that depend on its powerful
search engine. From the recently ac

quired Urchin.com, a Web site analysis
service, to Google Enterprise, which
will allow employees to search their
company's intranet, Google's aim is to
change the way people do business.
One of Google's latest additions to
its advertising model is using AdSense
for RSS feeds. Web users who want to
track the latest news stories or blog
posts can sign up to receive RSS —
which stands for really simple syndica
tion — feeds. These updating headlines
appear on their My Yahoo! Web site or
on a news reader, a Web site that aggre
gates and displays many feeds on one
single page. In the same way that Ad-
Sense finds and displays relevant ads by
matching up terms in the Web site con
tent or Google-sponsored Internet
searches, AdSense for RSS feeds will
link relevant ads to content in the feeds.
"This will allow for real time match
ing to our large base of advertisers," ex
plained Susan Wojcicki, director of

product management.
One of the ways that Google's adver
tising strategy has changed the way that
people shop is that AdSense is always
wooding. There are no prime-time TV
spots, no one-day newspaper ads — the
engine is chugging away 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, accessing pages
around the globe. With AdSense for
RSS feeds, the immediacy factor is even
stronger: Users accessing the latest in
formation are linked to the newest ads.
"With Google AdSense, there's no
reason to shut the campaign off," said
Tim Armstrong, vice president of ad
sales. Armstrong pointed to the success
of the General Motors campaign. At the
same time that Oprah announced the
winners of the GM car giveaway on her
show, all of the GM ads managed by
Google were set to advertise for that
specific car model.

So far, AdSense has proven to
be a good business model for Web
site owners. Matt Haughey, the
owner PVRBlog.com, which cov
ers TiVo and related devices, sub
scribes to AdSense and said he
found that it was a great way for
him to fund his Web site, according
to a New York Times article pub
lished on June 13,2004.
Googling at the workplace
The Google search engine
works much like the index of a
book It identifies where words ap
pear on millions of Web pages and
allows users to access the index
when searching fora term. Al
though Google has now indexed
eight billion Web pages, "a large
fraction of the world's information
is inside corporate firewalls," said
General Manager of Google En
terprise Dave Girouard at the
press event. "Search problems in
the workplace affect use minute by
minute, day by day."
While searching the Web is now
lightning fast, Girouard explained,
people often complained that
searching through their company's
intranet "proved to be a night
mare."
The end result? Google Desk
top Search for Enterprise, which
works much like a home user's
Google Desktop. The Google
search engine crawls through a
company's data center, indexing
all of the information — files, fold
ers, pictures, e-mails and more.
"Big companies have all kinds
of information storage and re
trieval problems, especially on the
level of individual PCs," explained
Eric Peterson, site operations and
technology analyst at Jupiter Re
search in a post on the Tech New
s Web site. "Desktop search
is an excellent solution for that
problem."
Google's recent acquisition of
Urchin Software Corp. will also
help companies determine the ef
fectiveness of their Web sites.
Urchin tracks Web usage, click
rate on different items on Web
pages, paths consumers take
through Web sites. Marketers and
Web site owners can use the col
lected information to maximize

user performance. Companies pay
$199 per month to track up to 50
Web sites (with a limit of one mil
lion page views per site) and can
use a variety of tools to analyze
their results.
"Marketers can set goals for
what they want their Web site to
achieve," explained Brett Crosby,
who used to work at Urchin and is
now employed at Google. "They
can then use Urchin to maximize
those goals."
A one-hit wonder?
When Michael Ballmer, chief
executive officer of Microsoft
Corp., spoke at the Stanford Busi
ness School on May 12, he said that
while Google may be "the hottest
company right now — the one no
body thinks can do any wrong —
[but it] may just be a one hit won
der."
Yet given Google's constant di
versification, it may just be going
for the platinum album.
Google operates on a 70:20:10
principle, spending 70 percent of
its time on internet search-related
services, 20 percent on adjacent
business and ten percent on other
activities, including services such
as Google Ride Finder, which
tracks taxis in major cities. Many
of the advertising products are
centered around its search func
tions, but the adjacent businesses
may prove to be just as successful.
So far, Google appears to be
stepping in the direction of the
business realm, pushing more
products to help businesses organ
ize, access and distribute their in
formation. Google has dabbled in
social networking services such as
Orkut.com (a Friendster-like site)
and recently purchased Dodge
ball.com, which is like Friendster
on-the-go (users use their cell
phones not their computers) but
has no plans to monetize these
services until their user base
reaches a critical mass, according
to Armstrong.
For now, Google executives
said that they would focus on con
tinuing on in their core mission,
"organizing all of the world's in
formation and making it universal
ly accessible," according to Google
Chief Executive Officer Eric
Schmidt.
And there are many miles to go.
Schmidt joked that the task would
take 300 years. "And we've got 294
years to go."

A search for "Los Angeles bars" will
not only yield 4,760,000 Web sites in
about 0.67 seconds, but will also pro
duce four "sponsored links" on the
right-hand side of the Web page. It is
through this kind of targeted advertis
ing that companies profit — each time
an Internet user clicks on any of the ad
vertisements sponsored by Google, the
company makes money. And that is how

Google's search engine has proved to be
a successful money-making tool: com
panies pay Google to match their adver
tisements to specific Web pages.
Through its AdSense program, Google
displays ads on a Web site by matching
key words with services or products of
fered by Web merchants.
Vice President of Product Manage
ment Jonathan Rosenberg, who spoke
at a press event at the company's
"Googleplex" on May 24, said he re
members speaking to Google Co-
Founder Larry Page during Google's
early days about the future of the com
pany. Page predicted that Internet
searching would be the most profitable
service on the Web.
But Google has extended into the
business world far beyond the advertis
ing realm. Over the last few months,
Google has introduced a variety of
products that depend on its powerful
search engine. From the recently ac

quired Urchin.com, a Web site analysis
service, to Google Enterprise, which
will allow employees to search their
company's intranet, Google's aim is to
change the way people do business.
One of Google's latest additions to
its advertising model is using AdSense
for RSS feeds. Web users who want to
track the latest news stories or blog
posts can sign up to receive RSS —
which stands for really simple syndica
tion — feeds. These updating headlines
appear on their My Yahoo! Web site or
on a news reader, a Web site that aggre
gates and displays many feeds on one
single page. In the same way that Ad-
Sense finds and displays relevant ads by
matching up terms in the Web site con
tent or Google-sponsored Internet
searches, AdSense for RSS feeds will
link relevant ads to content in the feeds.
"This will allow for real time match
ing to our large base of advertisers," ex
plained Susan Wojcicki, director of

product management.
One of the ways that Google's adver
tising strategy has changed the way that
people shop is that AdSense is always
wooding. There are no prime-time TV
spots, no one-day newspaper ads — the
engine is chugging away 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, accessing pages
around the globe. With AdSense for
RSS feeds, the immediacy factor is even
stronger: Users accessing the latest in
formation are linked to the newest ads.
"With Google AdSense, there's no
reason to shut the campaign off," said
Tim Armstrong, vice president of ad
sales. Armstrong pointed to the success
of the General Motors campaign. At the
same time that Oprah announced the
winners of the GM car giveaway on her
show, all of the GM ads managed by
Google were set to advertise for that
specific car model.

So far, AdSense has proven to
be a good business model for Web
site owners. Matt Haughey, the
owner PVRBlog.com, which cov
ers TiVo and related devices, sub
scribes to AdSense and said he
found that it was a great way for
him to fund his Web site, according
to a New York Times article pub
lished on June 13,2004.
Googling at the workplace
The Google search engine
works much like the index of a
book It identifies where words ap
pear on millions of Web pages and
allows users to access the index
when searching fora term. Al
though Google has now indexed
eight billion Web pages, "a large
fraction of the world's information
is inside corporate firewalls," said
General Manager of Google En
terprise Dave Girouard at the
press event. "Search problems in
the workplace affect use minute by
minute, day by day."
While searching the Web is now
lightning fast, Girouard explained,
people often complained that
searching through their company's
intranet "proved to be a night
mare."
The end result? Google Desk
top Search for Enterprise, which
works much like a home user's
Google Desktop. The Google
search engine crawls through a
company's data center, indexing
all of the information — files, fold
ers, pictures, e-mails and more.
"Big companies have all kinds
of information storage and re
trieval problems, especially on the
level of individual PCs," explained
Eric Peterson, site operations and
technology analyst at Jupiter Re
search in a post on the Tech New
s Web site. "Desktop search
is an excellent solution for that
problem."
Google's recent acquisition of
Urchin Software Corp. will also
help companies determine the ef
fectiveness of their Web sites.
Urchin tracks Web usage, click
rate on different items on Web
pages, paths consumers take
through Web sites. Marketers and
Web site owners can use the col
lected information to maximize

user performance. Companies pay
$199 per month to track up to 50
Web sites (with a limit of one mil
lion page views per site) and can
use a variety of tools to analyze
their results.
"Marketers can set goals for
what they want their Web site to
achieve," explained Brett Crosby,
who used to work at Urchin and is
now employed at Google. "They
can then use Urchin to maximize
those goals."
A one-hit wonder?
When Michael Ballmer, chief
executive officer of Microsoft
Corp., spoke at the Stanford Busi
ness School on May 12, he said that
while Google may be "the hottest
company right now — the one no
body thinks can do any wrong —
[but it] may just be a one hit won
der."
Yet given Google's constant di
versification, it may just be going
for the platinum album.
Google operates on a 70:20:10
principle, spending 70 percent of
its time on internet search-related
services, 20 percent on adjacent
business and ten percent on other
activities, including services such
as Google Ride Finder, which
tracks taxis in major cities. Many
of the advertising products are
centered around its search func
tions, but the adjacent businesses
may prove to be just as successful.
So far, Google appears to be
stepping in the direction of the
business realm, pushing more
products to help businesses organ
ize, access and distribute their in
formation. Google has dabbled in
social networking services such as
Orkut.com (a Friendster-like site)
and recently purchased Dodge
ball.com, which is like Friendster
on-the-go (users use their cell
phones not their computers) but
has no plans to monetize these
services until their user base
reaches a critical mass, according
to Armstrong.
For now, Google executives
said that they would focus on con
tinuing on in their core mission,
"organizing all of the world's in
formation and making it universal
ly accessible," according to Google
Chief Executive Officer Eric
Schmidt.
And there are many miles to go.
Schmidt joked that the task would
take 300 years. "And we've got 294
years to go."
That many of Google's services are
free — including the search engine,
Google Maps and Gmail — may have
some Internet users wondering how the
Mountain View, Calif.-based company is
as profitable as it is. At market closing
time on yesterday, the company's stocks
were $255 a share, nearly three times as
much as they were when the company
went public last August. The answer is
simple: advertising.
