# Google hits the business world: Variety of services keep Google a friend of Wall Street
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
That many of Google's services are
free — including the search engine,
Google Maps and Gmail — may have
some Internet users wondering how the
Mountain View, Calif.-based company is
as profitable as it is. At market closing
time on yesterday, the company's stocks
were $255 a share, nearly three times as
much as they were when the company
went public last August. The answer is
simple: advertising.
A search for "Los Angeles bars" will
not only yield 4,760,000 Web sites in
about 0.67 seconds, but will also pro
duce four "sponsored links" on the
right-hand side of the Web page. It is
through this kind of targeted advertis
ing that companies profit — each time
an Internet user clicks on any of the ad
vertisements sponsored by Google, the
company makes money. And that is how

Google's search engine has proved to be
a successful money-making tool: com
panies pay Google to match their adver
tisements to specific Web pages.
Through its AdSense program, Google
displays ads on a Web site by matching
key words with services or products of
fered by Web merchants.
Vice President of Product Manage
ment Jonathan Rosenberg, who spoke
at a press event at the company's
"Googleplex" on May 24, said he re
members speaking to Google Co-
Founder Larry Page during Google's
early days about the future of the com
pany. Page predicted that Internet
searching would be the most profitable
service on the Web.
But Google has extended into the
business world far beyond the advertis
ing realm. Over the last few months,
Google has introduced a variety of
products that depend on its powerful
search engine. From the recently ac

quired Urchin.com, a Web site analysis
service, to Google Enterprise, which
will allow employees to search their
company's intranet, Google's aim is to
change the way people do business.
One of Google's latest additions to
its advertising model is using AdSense
for RSS feeds. Web users who want to
track the latest news stories or blog
posts can sign up to receive RSS —
which stands for really simple syndica
tion — feeds. These updating headlines
appear on their My Yahoo! Web site or
on a news reader, a Web site that aggre
gates and displays many feeds on one
single page. In the same way that Ad-
Sense finds and displays relevant ads by
matching up terms in the Web site con
tent or Google-sponsored Internet
searches, AdSense for RSS feeds will
link relevant ads to content in the feeds.
"This will allow for real time match
ing to our large base of advertisers," ex
plained Susan Wojcicki, director of

product management.
One of the ways that Google's adver
tising strategy has changed the way that
people shop is that AdSense is always
wooding. There are no prime-time TV
spots, no one-day newspaper ads — the
engine is chugging away 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, accessing pages
around the globe. With AdSense for
RSS feeds, the immediacy factor is even
stronger: Users accessing the latest in
formation are linked to the newest ads.
"With Google AdSense, there's no
reason to shut the campaign off," said
Tim Armstrong, vice president of ad
sales. Armstrong pointed to the success
of the General Motors campaign. At the
same time that Oprah announced the
winners of the GM car giveaway on her
show, all of the GM ads managed by
Google were set to advertise for that
specific car model.
