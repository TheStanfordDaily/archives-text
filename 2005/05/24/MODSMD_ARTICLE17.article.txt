# Hate your smelly cat? Trade it in on the Web

In a little more than a week, students
who spend their afternoons on the basket
ball courts outside Stern Hall may have to
relocate as summer storage containers
take over that space. Many students store
their dorm necessities in these units over
the summer, but for graduating seniors or
students stuck with items they no longer
want, the next best option is to put their
goods up for sale. While Web sites such as
eßay are popular nationwide, some stu
dents might want to look closer to home.
Regional-based Web sites are useful for
people looking to buy and sell thousands
of items physically located within a certain
geographical area. A region can vary in
scope from exclusively Stanford to the
greater Bay Area, depending on the Web
site. Several new Web sites have popped up
in the last few years — each has its bene
fits and quirks.
Meepster
Meepster.stanford.edu is a Web site
that serves the Bay Area community. It
was founded by two Stanford graduates,
Akash Jain, Class of 2003, and Sachin
Agarwal, Class of 2002, who were frus
trated by their online shopping experi
ences. Agarwal and Jain found that cur
rent Web sites were missing key elements.
For example, since postings on
Craigslist.com are anonymous, one per
son's postings can be scattered through
out the Web site, causing users to buy sev
eral items from the same user without
even knowing it. Agarwal once drove
from San Francisco to Marin County
twice in one week to purchase two items
from the same user — having all of the
user's postings on one page would have
alleviated that problem.

The Web site's key features, founders
say, are that users can limit their search by
zip code within the Bay Area and that
searches are free. It also offers a feedback
system for reputation checks of sellers,
much like Amazon.corn's rating system,
and each item for sale features a question
and-answer section where shoppers can
ask for details or address concerns.
Yet because Meepster was launched
only recently, its size keeps it from serving
the needs of the average buyer. With only

-11 categories, some only with one item, it's
better to shop with an open mind than to
shop with a purpose on this Web site.

Live Deal
Founded in 2003 by Graduate School of

Business alumnus Rajesh Navar, class of
2003, Live Deal.com also caters to Bay
Area residents. The Web site claims that
more than one million items are currently
for sale in hundreds of categories to match
the interests of any potential buyer.
In an interview with Actionßytes.com,
Navar, the current chief executive officer
of Live Deal.com, explained that the dif
ference between a service like eßay and
Live Deal was that his company does a
good job catering to the local market.
"What is common between eßay and
Live Deal is that both are building person
to-person marketplaces," he said in the in
terview. "EBay has done very well on a na
tional scale for shippable items. Live Deal
connects buyers and sellers locally and
sellers who are selling heavy, hard-to-ship
items such as autos, furniture, pets and real
estate. All of these categories are doing
very well on Live Deal."
Live Deal.com features services such as
MyLiveDeal, which tracks an individual
user's postings and purchases and a feed
back system that allows buyers to check
the record of the product's seller.
Live Deal Lounge gives users the opportu
nity to read tips posted by other users on
using the Web site. Live Deal is completely
free for sellers and buyers but registration
is required.
Random postings: "Proud to be an Ameri
can" flag, vintage milk can, McDonald's
"wedge trays"from the 19705.

Swap-Swap
For even easier transactions, students
can check out Swap-Swap.com, currently a
service exclusive to Stanford users. Devel-

oped by Stanford junior Kevin Sys
trom, Swap-Swap launched about
a month ago and currently has
about 600 registered users.
"The idea was to do something
like Craigslist," said Systrom. "A
lot of people don't know how to
use su.market and so 1 thought,
'Why not make something that is
really easy to access and use?' "
Systrom's original plan was for
it to be Stanford-only — and he
dubbed the site Treelist.com —
but after seeing it develop, Sys
trom said he has plans to expand it
to other schools in the future.
"What I'd like to see happen is
first for it to gain traction at Stan
ford," he said. "Then you and all of
your friends will talk to people at
Berkeley or at Foothill College
and it will jump from one campus
to another."
Using the site is free, something
Systrom is committed to maintain
ing.
"I met with Craig [Newmark] of
Craigslist about two weeks ago,
and Craig's mantra was that there
are just some things that should be
free —we have better things to
spend our money on," he said.
To access the Web site, students
and faculty must sign in with a
Stanford e-mail, so users can be as
sured that any purchases they
make are within the Stanford com
munity.
Users can search these listings
in many different ways using
unique features like Swap.search.
where immediate results pop up as
you type and match up sellers and
buyers of the searched item.
Swap.Market lists everything post
ed chronologically, displaying the
average of 20-30 items posted each
day. The list goes back as far as
three weeks, so shoppers can check
out a wide variety of items. Swap
swap connects to su.market, so
users have access to both sets of
postings.
Random postings: fishing pole, deep
fryer, " The Mars Volta" tickets.
