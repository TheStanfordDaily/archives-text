## Editorial Newsweek mistake detracts from larger problem 
### 
In its May y issue, Newsweek magazine
printed an article alleging that interroga
tors at the U.S. detention center at the
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base had dese
crated the Quran, the Islamic holy book.
Since then, the magazine has retracted
and apologized for the article. However,
this isolated incident should not distract
the public from the Bush administration's
own contributions to anti-American sen
timent abroad.
Newsweek's report, which stated that
interrogators had defiled Qurans in at
tempts to get prisoners to talk, was based
on intelligence given by a government
agent who later admitted that he could
not be sure what he said was actually true.
Damaging the Quran is an offense pun
ishable by death in Afghanistan and is
taken very seriously by Muslims. As such,
Newsweek attempted to verify the seri
ous allegations by speaking with two dif
ferent Pentagon officials, neither of whom
objected to the report in question.
Soon after it became clear that the re
port was potentially untrue, the Bush ad
ministration jumped on the story and
quickly blamed the Newsweek article for
the violent anti-American protests in the
Middle East two weeks ago. These
protests left 15 people dead and more
than 1 (K) people wounded. According to
White House spokesman Scott McClel
lan, "The report has had serious conse
quences. People have lost their lives. The
image of the United States abroad has
been damaged."

In using Newsweek as a scapegoat, the
White House is deflecting the blame for
the rampant anti-American sentiment
that permeates countries across the Mid
dle East. Even before the Newsweek arti
cle, the United States was hardly beloved
by everyone in Afghanistan and Iraq, yet
the White House is trying to convince the
American public that the magazine's mis
take has seriously affected our relation
ship with people of the Islamic faith.
While the questionable report is regret
table, it is undoubtedly not the sole cause
of the United States' negative image in
the Middle East. Incidents such as abuse
of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison abuse
scandal have been far more damaging
than the Newsweek article.
The Bush administration's unapolo
getic chastising of Newsweek is an unfair
attack on the media, and while news
sources should always thoroughly check
their facts, this incident should not prompt
them to overly censor themselves when
breaking potentially controversial stories.
In addition, the allegations discussed
in the Newsweek article should be inves
tigated further. Any form of mistreatment
of prisoners or sacred material such as the
Quran, which American officers are told
to treat as a piece of "delicate art," needs
to be open to the public, and the media
has a responsibility to report these crimes
and infractions to the American people,
regardless of the administration's desire
to keep all damaging information as pri
vate as possible.
