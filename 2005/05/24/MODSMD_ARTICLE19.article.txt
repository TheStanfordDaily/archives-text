# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## Things we don't know 
### 
One of the best things
about the differences be
tween men and women is
that they are complemen
tary. The strengths of one
gender shore up the weak
nesses of the other. I am
fairly convinced that
women are smarter than
men, mostly because they
have turned the restroom

into a fully operational command center, as
we have turned ours into a festival of offen
sive smells.That said, I have discovered each
gender has one area in which they have cor
nered the knowledge market, despite the
fact that members of the other sex think they
know something about it. In the interests of
equity I will address them both, and in the in
terests of chivalry I will speak of the ladies
first.
Women know pain. ITiey know it inti
mately. It's like a close friend of theirs.
What's most impressive about them is that
they handle it with such dignity and grace. 1
could just mention child-birth and stop
right there, because the thought alone
scares me to death. But that's ground well
covered by people funnier than 1 am. More
than that, there are daily pains: walking
around in high-heeled shoes, wearing jeans
tight enough to reveal the shape of your un
derwear and, of course, tolerating the boor
ish, slobbering and hairy simpletons who
ended up one chromosome short of the sis
terhood.
From the looks of things, guys should be
good at pain, but we're not. We cry and whine
and carry on over our little cuts and scrapes,
not to mention how we act when we're sick.
A headache immobilizes us, a little nausea
puts us squarely on our backs. And a cramp?
Well, that's a pretty good reason to cry. You
can always tell when a man's in pain because
even if you can't hear it, it's written all over
his face. In all, men handle pain with all the
grace of modesty in the WWE. For all our
machismo, we're really just not that tough.

Okay, now as hard as it is to believe, there
is one thing that men actually know more
about than women (as a caveat, ladies, there
is only one). It's not cars, sports or stocks. It's
"being horny." *Gasp* OK, now that you've
caught your breath, hear me out. I know that
it's possible for women to feel this particular
emotion, but your version compared to ours
is like comparing Stanford to the University
of Phoenix. For us, it's life-altering, like a
miniature, temporary lobotomy. Every guy
you know has done something stupid be
cause of it. Every one. For women, it's just a
word — a cute little phrase to toss around
and maybe get some shock value out of (e.g.
"I'm horny too, hee hee!")
I know it's hard to understand, so as a
public service, let me provide a method of
demonstrating this to you ladies. Make a
short recording of the person with the deep
est voice you know saying the words
"WANT THAT!" Place this recording on
your iPod,, put the headphones in your ears
and turn the volume up as loud as it will go.
Now every time you try to think rationally
while there is a boy around, play the record
ing. Notice I did not say any time there is a
cute boy or a nice boy or even a rich boy (for
you loyal fans). That's the difference be
tween your "horny" and ours. Ours is indis
criminant and likes to shout — even when
we're sober.
What's the point of telling you all this?
Well, in this era of misunderstanding, we
should do all we can to understand one an
other. So guys, stop complaining to your fe
male friends about how much something
hurts. Chances are, they've had it much,
much worse. And ladies, when you're in the
command center trying to figure out how to
get a guy to think about something besides
sex — try putting a really loud recording on
his iPod.

Cilcnn Truitt has a few recordings of himself on
his iPod and also has a pretty deep voice. For
