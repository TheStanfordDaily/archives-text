# Leavitt discusses healthcare funding
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
In light of intense debates over stem cell
research and health care costs instate legis
latures and U.S. Congress, Mike Leavitt
touched on topics ranging from the use of
information technology in medicine to the
problem posed by American workers with
out health insurance at a talk at the School
of Medicine yesterday.
In his first official visit to the Bay Area as
the secretary of Health and Human
Services, Leavitt. who previously served as
administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, acknowledged that the

American health care system is seriously
impaired. He said its performance is not
proportional to the amount of resources it
uses and noted that in a matter of decades,
the proportion of gross domestic products
spent on healthcare has jumped from 5.1
percent to 15.3 percent. This figure may
even reach 19 percent in the foreseeable
future, he added.
"Our healthcare system is saturated in
inefficiency," Leavitt said.
He added that information technology
could be the answer to this crisis, deeming it
"the new frontier of human productivity."
He said he envisions a system in which
patients have ownership over their medical

records, digital laboratory results are trans
mitted directly to doctors and prescriptions
are filled electronically.
Leavitt urged patients, healthcare
providers and researchers to collaborate in
an effort to form a comprehensive network
that would greatly facilitate the delivery of
quality healthcare. He said this could result
in a system not only "devoted to treatment"
but also "devoted to [the] wellness" of
Americans.
"Now that we've gotten machines to
work together, can we get humans to work
together?" Leavitt asked. "Organic collabo-

ration is messy and expensive, but it's
also absolutely indispensable."
Leavitt illustrated the extent to
which healthcare costs have risen in
recent years with Medicaid, the gov
ernment health insurance program
for low-income citizens. He said that
the enormous costs of providing
health services have destabilized
Medicaid's finances.
Medicaid expenditures now
account for some .?2 percent of state
budgets, more than the amount states
spend on education, l.eavitt said. Ihe
price tag of healthcare has caused
particular hardships lor workers fac
ing employment benefit reductions,
and diminished states' abilities to pro
vide children with quality education.
He partially blamed the current
system of medical liability for
prompting doctors to perform super
fluous treatments, thereby driving up
healthcare costs.
"At the root of it, [the medical lia
bility system] is a mistake." Leavitt
said. "The president will continue to
push lor medical liability reform until
things get better."
While moderating a question
and-answer session following the
speech. School of Medicine Dean
Philip Pi/y.o suggested that he and
many scientists find the anti-science
sentiment emerging in Washington
D.C. and across the United States
worrisome.
In refuting the notion that politi
cians intentionally derail scientific
results on political and ideological
grounds, Leavitt responded that poli
cymakers — such as those at the
Environmental Protection Agency
frequently get involved in ostensi
ble scientific processes because even
scientists disagree among themselves
about which assumptions and meth
ods of analysis should be employed
in a given study.
Ixavitt said the media often mis
represents such action.
"Within 36 hours of [a politician's
decision regarding a scientific study).

somebody from a newspaper, usually
The New York Times, will hear about
it and say that policymakers are over
ruling the scientists," Leavitt said.
Henry Lowe, professor and senior
associate dean for information and
technology at the School of
Medicine, said in an interview with
ITie Daily that Leavitt articulated
some thoughtful approaches to com
plicated health care issues.
"I think it is good that he views
information technology as an impor
tant part of the solutions to the prob
lems," Lowe said. "The long history
of information technology develop
ment here at Stanford will certainly
help us pursue the type of training
and research necessary."
In a private session with faculty
from the School of Medicine that
preceded his speech, Leavitt dis
cussed contentious issues such as
stem cell research. His viewpoints,
consistent with those of the Bush
administration, provoked substantial
debate.
Cancer biology Prof. Irv
Weissman, director of the Stem Cell
Institute at Stanford, told The Daily
that he disagreed with the position
taken by Leavitt and the Bush
administration on stem cell research.
"Stem cell research needs to be
regulated by society, but we have to
do it," Weissman said. "The Bush
administration, however, wants to
ban and even criminalize some forms
of stem cell research."
He added that Leavitt must
decide whether he wants to be an
advocate for patients or an advocate
for ideology and a president who
bases many of his decisions on ideo
logical beliefs.
Pizzo also said that controversial
issues can only be effectively
explored if individuals with opposing
viewpoints are willing to listen to one
another.
"When an intransient religious
belief or ideology draws a line in the
sand and makes a discussion impossi
ble, the consequent divide is
unbridgeable" Pizzo said. "Sadly this
is happening around a number of
enormously important issues, includ
ing stem cell research and reproduc
tive health."
