# Holt's harangue
## Dr. Googlelove (or how I stopped worrying and learned to love the search engine) 
### 
So Google, that happy
little search engine and
provider of the thoroughly
awesome e-mail service
"Gmail" has unfurled its
next plan.
Google is letting you
customize your own Web
browser. Now, you can get
the weather, news and goat
porn that much faster.

Google is also making plans for Google
Earth, which sounds like a bad James Bond
movie villain's plan for world domination. I
can picture the former Stanford computer
science majors-turned-CEOs cackling as
they sip on Google Water:
"We will Googilize the entire world!"one
laughs.
"Ilirn on the Lazoogle Ray, fire the Nu
cloogle Missiles!" We'll be rendered helpless,
admiring the cute puns on the word Google
in all the instruments of destruction. Aww,
look at the B-2 Stealth Bomboogle.
Google also hopes to make maps of the
entire world, which reminds me of
maps.com, except hopefully it, too, won't list
my home address as the second left off the
Atlantic Ocean.
I have no idea why they would possibly
want to map the entire world, only that the
people must be really, really bored over
there. I mean, they've dominated the search
engine thing, the e-mail thing was a cinch and

now they have some kind of Internet fruit
stand in "Froogle." Maybe they are after
world domination. What better way to unite
the world than get precise satellite mappings
of every location on the entire planet?
Maybe they are figuring out how to level
AOL headquarters, or analyzing the best
way to divide their newly conquered empire.
"Let's see here, I call Asia and Africa,
which will now be known as 'Frankoogle
Land.' You can have Australia."
What really scares me, though, are the ma
chine translations, which I neither look for
ward to nor understand. Google hopes to be
able to translate languages instantaneously,
but I do not trust this digital babelfish. With
machines that have the ability to understand
every single word I've ever written, the next
time I make fun of Sting I can look forward to
hate mail from Iceland. Thanks, Google.
Plus, isn't the term "machine translations"
just a bit creepy? Sounds like they're talking
to machines, doesn't it? Although they will
be terribly efficient, I bet Google's killer ro
bots will be pretty cute and possibly come in
different flavors.
Says Alan Eustace, vice president of engi
neering and research (and soon to be ruler of
Northern Europe): "We have essentially un
limited computational power. That allows us
to solve some very interesting problems."
See? They are clearly drunk with compu
tational power. There is no telling what their
dorkdom could conquer next. Getting pirat-

Ed copies of Episode III? No problem. Hack
ing into every Babylon 5 Web site? A cinch.
Putting a Trojan horse in Dean Wormer's of
fice? Easy.
Stanford grads seem to be lining up to
work at Google before the Commencement
speaker is even finished with his address.The
funny thing is that these grads are majoring
in everything from computer science to
American Studies. I mean, I've heard of
being non-discriminatory of race, creed and
sexual orientation. But "field of study" defi
nitely makes Google pretty unique. I guess
the thinking is that the technical people will
do their thing, and the fuzzy people will do
the campaigning, PR work or be test subjects
for the robots.
Yet, everyone who works there seems to
like it.The entire work ethic of the place kind
of frightens me. I've got a lot of friends there
who "enjoy" work, like "making their own
hours" and think "the food is really good." I
smell something afoogle. I mean "afoot."
Damn it, now they got me doing it too.
In time, Google, you will come to fear me.
You cannot lure me with your promise of
well-paid internships, relaxed work environ
ment or rewards for creativity. As evidenced
by my employment with The Daily, I thrive
on none of these things.

Chris always believed that Google was the lit
tle start-up that could... enslave mankind.
