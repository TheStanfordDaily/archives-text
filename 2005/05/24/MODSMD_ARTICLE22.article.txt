## Police practice criminal hypocrisy 
### SEAN YOUNG 
After working late one night, I returned
home to find a letter alerting me of a warrant
for my arrest. As a doctoral student in psy
chology at Stanford, I spend most of my time
researching ways to promote health and pre
vent illness. When I'm feeling especially
seditious, I may play Pac Man or other old
school video games.
Naturally then, 1 was surprised to receive
a notice saying I had been charged with a
crime and that the police were "commanded
to arrest the above named defendant [me]
and bring said defendant forthwith." When I
contacted the police to find out what I
should do, I was instructed to go to the sta
tion to "turn myself in, get fingerprinted and
be assigned a court date for trial." My crime:
biking without a bike-light and a no-show at
the police station to prove that I had since
bought a light to remedy the problem. Inter
estingly, I had never received the notice re
quiring action on my part. Yet after re
searching my options, I discovered I could
spend up to six months in jail for my offense.
Given that many of us may have had an
experience like this, let me put this obvious
mismanagement of police power into per
spective with another example that hopeful
ly few of us have experienced. Last Hal
loween, my brother and 1 were walking
down a well-lit street hoping to observe the
traditional Halloween spectacle in the Cas
tro district of San Francisco. Suddenly, some
thug sucker-punched my brother in the face,
breaking his nose and knocking out his two
front teeth. When I ran to help him, some
thing slammed against the side of my face
and I saw blood fly from my mouth. Anoth
er thug had attacked me.
Dripping with blood, we rushed up the
street for help and were relieved to find some
nearby policemen; they were indifferent. We
sat on the sidewalk for several minutes, until
another bleeding person and two girls came

over. This young man yelled to the police
men, who were still standing there apatheti
cally, that a gang just a down the street was
attacking people for no reason and laughing
about it.The police however, did not move or
react. Bleeding and shocked, the three of us
were horrified at their inaction.
Tragically, later that night the group of at
tackers hit another man in the trachea, and
attempted to attack a woman next to him.
Despite inaction by the police, a courageous
bystander ultimately intervened and ran
after the assaulter, tackling and pinning him
to the ground. Only after he had been tack
led and subdued did the police attempt to
catch this assailant. Amazingly however,
they did not bother to take any of the other
gang members into custody, irresponsibly,
they released a second member who was
caught because they were too busy to deal
with him. All told, this group attacked at
least nine people that night. Nevertheless,
only seven were willing to testify in front of
the defendant, either for fear of reprisal, or
due to a lack of police response.The newspa
per headline the next day neglected to men
tion these events, describing a peaceful
evening in the Castro.
My brother was unable to testify against
this individual because, at the time of the
preliminary hearing, he was undergoing re
constructive surgery resulting from the as
sault. Two plates in my face later, teeth wired
together after surgery for my broken jaw, I
gathered the strength and courage to show
up to testify only to discover that the defen
dant, who confused us all by giving a fake
name to the police, may get off with a misde
meanor charge, serving at most six months in
prison (less with parole) — for randomly at
tacking at least seven people. This is the
equivalent charge and sentence assigned to
me for not proving that I possess a bike
light. Didn't the legal books state that 1, too,
could spend up to 6 months in jail?
As for my bike light charge, I was fortu

nate enough to speak to a lawyer, who told
me to not go to the police station because
then I would be charged with the crime. In
stead I was instructed to go directly to the
court to deal with the issue, saving me from
a "criminal record."
Meanwhile, with the exception of the de
fendant, who was tackled and apprehended,
the remaining gang members have gone
free.
Ultimately, though the warrant I received
for the bike light was only a bench warrant,
it signals a serious flaw in our criminal sys
tem. How could I receive the same charge
and sentence for not having a bike-light that
is demanded for perpetrators who randomly
assault people? Second, why are police wast
ing valuable manpower tracking down a
graduate student to give him a warrant
rather than locating individuals out there
who have committed more serious crimes?
When I went to the court to defend my bike
light charge case, a policeman told me that if
you commit robbery or assault and are not
caught for 20 years, then you are probably
off the hook — erased from the system. Ve
hicle violations however, will stay with you
for life and only increase in severity with
time. Clearly there is something wrong with
this picture.
What we can do to change this vicious
cycle?
I am creating an advocacy group to bring
information and support to victims of ran
dom violent crime and to raise public aware
ness of random violent crime. As far as I
know, there is no group or support system
for people who are randomly attacked. If
you have been a victim of random crime you
can greatly help your community and bring
change. Please share your knowledge and
experience with other victims to increase
awareness and prevent further victimiza
tion.

As for my bike light charge, I was fortu

nate enough to speak to a lawyer, who told
me to not go to the police station because
then I would be charged with the crime. In
stead I was instructed to go directly to the
court to deal with the issue, saving me from
a "criminal record."
Meanwhile, with the exception of the de
fendant, who was tackled and apprehended,
the remaining gang members have gone
free.
Ultimately, though the warrant I received
for the bike light was only a bench warrant,
it signals a serious flaw in our criminal sys
tem. How could I receive the same charge
and sentence for not having a bike-light that
is demanded for perpetrators who randomly
assault people? Second, why are police wast
ing valuable manpower tracking down a
graduate student to give him a warrant
rather than locating individuals out there
who have committed more serious crimes?
When I went to the court to defend my bike
light charge case, a policeman told me that if
you commit robbery or assault and are not
caught for 20 years, then you are probably
off the hook — erased from the system. Ve
hicle violations however, will stay with you
for life and only increase in severity with
time. Clearly there is something wrong with
this picture.
What we can do to change this vicious
cycle?
I am creating an advocacy group to bring
information and support to victims of ran
dom violent crime and to raise public aware
ness of random violent crime. As far as I
know, there is no group or support system
for people who are randomly attacked. If
you have been a victim of random crime you
can greatly help your community and bring
change. Please share your knowledge and
experience with other victims to increase
awareness and prevent further victimiza
tion.
