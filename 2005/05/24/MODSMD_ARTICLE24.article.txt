## Soto Tape Chronicles Bicker chefs take on NBA 
### 
Adrian Dawson is a chef at Ricker din
ing. We met one day in February at
lunch when I was loudly professing my
love for the women's basketball team. Adrian
chimed in, and I soon learned that along with
her friendly smile and talkative nature, Adri
an is a huge basketball fan. As the magical
women's basketball season progressed, we
kept each other up to date on game reports
and shared our most recent analysis.
Adrian knows a lot about hoops. Though I
repeatedly demeaned Michigan State's No. 1
seed, she insisted that the Spartans had the tal
ent and desire to make it to the finals. Shows
you how much 1 know.
Adrian became a Stanford fan by selling

football programs at Stan
ford Stadium in high school.
Later, as a part-time cook at
the Sports Cafe (before it
was Jimmy V's), she met
many athletes and coaches.
She especially enjoyed talk
ing to Tyrone Willingham,
Robert Weir ("God, he's a
good coach!"), Tara Van-
Derveer and Mike Mont-

gomery. Adrian would chat sports with them,
but she also found it interesting to note what
they liked to eat.
"You'd think that as coaches, training all
these athletes, that they'd eat healthy foods,
but in fact about half eat healthy and half
don't!"
Monty? He always ordered a smoothie.
This quarter, in between teaching me the
finer points of grilling with mesquite charcoal,
Adrian gave me her thoughts on the ongoing
NBA season. She likes teams that play togeth
er and share the ball. She hates the fighting
that has tarnished the league's image. And she
loves watching Steve Nash.
Adrian played recreational league hoops
growing up and was a dynamic point guard
who averaged 20-plus points per game. As a
result, she feels a personal connection with
point guards. You need someone to put up
points, give out assists and move the ball
around, she insists.
"Can you think of any team that has won
without a good point guard?"
