## Soto Tape Chronicles Bicker chefs take on NBA 
### 
Adrian Dawson is a chef at Ricker din
ing. We met one day in February at
lunch when I was loudly professing my
love for the women's basketball team. Adrian
chimed in, and I soon learned that along with
her friendly smile and talkative nature, Adri
an is a huge basketball fan. As the magical
women's basketball season progressed, we
kept each other up to date on game reports
and shared our most recent analysis.
Adrian knows a lot about hoops. Though I
repeatedly demeaned Michigan State's No. 1
seed, she insisted that the Spartans had the tal
ent and desire to make it to the finals. Shows
you how much 1 know.
Adrian became a Stanford fan by selling

football programs at Stan
ford Stadium in high school.
Later, as a part-time cook at
the Sports Cafe (before it
was Jimmy V's), she met
many athletes and coaches.
She especially enjoyed talk
ing to Tyrone Willingham,
Robert Weir ("God, he's a
good coach!"), Tara Van-
Derveer and Mike Mont-

gomery. Adrian would chat sports with them,
but she also found it interesting to note what
they liked to eat.
"You'd think that as coaches, training all
these athletes, that they'd eat healthy foods,
but in fact about half eat healthy and half
don't!"
Monty? He always ordered a smoothie.
This quarter, in between teaching me the
finer points of grilling with mesquite charcoal,
Adrian gave me her thoughts on the ongoing
NBA season. She likes teams that play togeth
er and share the ball. She hates the fighting
that has tarnished the league's image. And she
loves watching Steve Nash.
Adrian played recreational league hoops
growing up and was a dynamic point guard
who averaged 20-plus points per game. As a
result, she feels a personal connection with
point guards. You need someone to put up
points, give out assists and move the ball
around, she insists.
"Can you think of any team that has won
without a good point guard?"

If there's one player that Adrian
likes more than Nash, however, it's
Tim Duncan.This puts her in a bind
because the Suns and Spurs are fac
ing each other in the Western Con
ference Finals. With this in mind,
and knowing how good she is at an
alyzing basketball, I sat down with
Adrian on Sunday to discuss the
NBA playoffs.
The Suns are an exciting team
that can score points at will. They
have great individual talent in
Nash. Amare Stoudemire and
Shawn Marion, but Adrian notes
that they don't have a very deep
bench. If anything were to happen
to one of their stars, the Suns
wouldn't have too many replace
ment options.
The Spurs, on the other hand,
have a deep bench and play togeth
er. Any number of role players and
supporting cast members can step
up in big games to carry the team
when Duncan can't do it alone.That
said, if Duncan doesn't play his
best, it will be very difficult for the
Spurs to handle the Suns' offense.
"It's going to come down to
Nash against Duncan." Adrian pre
dicts. "If Duncan stays healthy, the
Spurs will win. But the series will go
seven games, and the Spurs will win
the last game by just a few points. It
will be close."
And in the East? "Whoo. boy!
Miami has the best center in the

game and Dwyane Wade. They can
put points on the board. But De
troit, man, they're the champions!"
The Pistons don't have the stars
or the offensive stats of the other
three remaining playoff teams, but
they can play defense and. because
of their championship run last year,
they know what it takes to win in
May and June.
The Heat, on the other hand, are
balanced and can score easily. Wade
is for real and if Shaq can stay
healthy, then Miami will overwhelm
the defending champs.That's a pret
ty big "if" given that the Diesel is
suffering from a strained thigh, but
the Heat's two successive sweeps
mean that they're more rested than
the battle-scarred Pistons.
Adrian is pretty clear on the Pis
tons vs. Shaq matchup.
"The Pistons handled Shaq last
year, but that doesn't mean much
because the Lakers had problems.
Basketball is like a family â€” you
don't know there are arguments be
hind closed doors, but it shows on
the court. If Shaq plays it won't be a
sweep, but the Heat will win."
1 respect Adrian's opinions, but I
have to think that the Suns will out
run the Spurs and the Pistons will
grind Shaq and Wade to a halt.Then
again, she was right about the
women's Final Four and she was
right about the mesquite grill. All
we know for sure is that each team
has a legitimate chance to win the
title and that we're in for some ex
citing playoff basketball.
