# Stanford hires new swim coach
## Alumna takes over 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
One month after announcing
the retirement of 17-year veteran
head coach Richard Quick, the
Athletic Department has hired
Lea Loveless Maurer to lead the
women's swimming and diving
team, which finished fifth at this
year's NCAA Championships.
Maurer, an NCAA Champion and
Olympic medalist, will take the
reins from Quick in September,
when he moves to Texas to be clos
er to his family.
"It is very exciting to replace
Richard Quick," Maurer said. "It is
obviously daunting — he is one of
the most accomplished coaches in
America. I don't think his accom
plishments have been matched by
anyone. He was a mentor to me as a
coach, a mentor as a friend and now
as a peer. I have turned to him many
times for advice and support."
Maurer graduated from Stan
ford in 1994 with 10 NCAA titles,
including four individual back
stroke wins. She was a 15-time Pa
cific-l() Conference champion, 21-
time All-American and two of her
relay times still stand as. school
records. She has two Olympic
medals — a silver fora relay and a
bronze for the backstroke from the
1992 Games in Barcelona — and
held the American record in the
KX)-meter backstroke for 10 years.
She worked for two years after
graduation as an assistant coach at
Northwestern before taking the
head coach position at Lake Forest
High School in Illinois, where she
led the boys' and girls' teams to na
tional titles in 2003. She was Illinois
State Coach of the Year eight times
in her 10 years at Lake Forest, five
times for coaching girls and three
for boys.
"It was a very hard decision ac
tually," Maurer said of leaving
Lake Forest. "It sounds ironic.
Leaving a high school job for Stan
ford sounds like a no-brainer. It
was a family choice. This is an op
portunity of a lifetime to work with
these athletes and be able to bring
them into the hunt fora national
championship, which I think they
are very capable of."
Maurer will be coming to Stan
ford with her husband Erik Maur
er, a Stanford alumnus and the

1992 NCAA 50-meter freestyle
champion, and their two young
sons. Though it will be hard for
Maurer to leave Illinois, she said
she is looking forward to the op
portunity to work with such a tal
ented squad.
"I am very excited to come
back,"she said.'T loved Stanford as
a student-athlete and I am really
inspired to be working with the stu
dent-athletes who are on the team
now. They are a very gifted and tal
ented team and very well-bal
anced. I am also very excited about
working with my peers on the
coaching staff."
When Maurer takes over the
team in September, she will bring a
coaching style that is based on
Quick's, but also very much her
own.
"I am excited because I am
someone who really believes in
what [Coach Quick] does and I am
going to continue that and also go
in a different direction," she said.
"I am not going»to try to replicate
Richard, but I understand what he
does and have adapted that in my
own way. But, there are philo
sophical things that I share with
him, in terms of pushing kids
through barriers."
Maurer said that much of her
own coaching style comes from
memories of being an athlete
under Quick's tutelage.
"I remember doing sets that
seemed impossible and coming out
on the other side of T can't do it' to
T just did this,'" she said. "It's em
powering and inspiring, and a big
part of who I am. There were plen
ty of workouts when I thought
'This guy is out of his mind,' but it's
about not closing your mind to
what you can do."
Maurer said she will bring her
own perspective on the sport which
she believes helps her relate to ath
letes. "1 am not Richard Quick,"
she said. "I am coming in with my
own experiences, as a woman who
has gone through the sport.
"Not every good swimmer
makes a good coach, but I think
that I do because I was always a
thoughtful and reflective athlete,
cognizant of the mental and physi
cal changes I was making and what
was helping me," she said. "And I
think that I can articulate that as a
coach."
