# Golf reaches NCAAs

### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Gatorade showers aren't just for football
sidelines anymore. The traditional victor's
honor was bestowed upon Stanford fresh
man Rob Grube Saturday as his final-round
65 at the NCAA West Regional single
handedly hoisted the Cardinal into their
first NCAA Championship appearance
since 2001. Stanford tied for eighth place in
a 27-team field.
Grube's five-under-par performance
propelled him to a three-shot victory — the
first of his collegiate career — with a six
under-par total of 204 for three rounds. The
victory comes on the heels of a runner-up
finish in April's U.S. Intercollegiate at the
Stanford Golf Course.
"I knew that I had putted well for the
first time all year [during the first two
rounds], but unfortunately my ball striking
the first two days wasn't as solid as it had
been in the past," Grube said. "1 knew if 1
could somehow start hitting the ball well
that I would shoot a good number. All day, 1
kept telling myself to stay focused on the
task at hand and that every shot mattered. It
ended up that we got in by one so every shot
really did matter."
The Pacific-10 Conference Freshman of
the Year has been the Cardinal's most con
sistent performer throughout the season,
and Saturday's final round epitomized what
the rookie has meant to coach Conrad Ray's
team. With Stanford just two shots outside
the lOth-place cut line for the NCAA
Championship after Friday, Grube loaded
four teammates on his less-than-ample
shoulders fora postseason charge.
Through 17 holes, Grube stood at eight
under par, amassing six birdies and an eagle
without a single bogey. His sterling iron play
made even the Stanford Golf Course's most
brutal pin placements ripe for the taking
and the putter that carried him the entire
week made the cup look like an Easter bas
ket.
Then, the unthinkable. With Grube
needing just a par at the 18th hole to secure
an eight-under-par 62 and a new course
record, a soaring push-slice off the final tee
found a stand of grass that had more busi
ness being baled than played from.
After an unsuccessful attempt to chop
his ball free and a three-foot putt that lipped
out on the 18th green, Grube tapped in a
triple-bogey, backing into individual medal
ist honors.

Nonetheless, the freshman's round was
good enough to punch Stanford's ticket for
a run at the national championship at the
Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills,
Md. Along with Grube, the rest of the Stan
ford team will be getting their first taste of
NCAA Championship play, including the
Cardinal's two seniors, Pat Phillips and
Kevin Blue.
"The NCAA Regionals could have
marked the last collegiate tournament for
me and Kevin, but neither one of us let those
thoughts bother us," Phillips said. "If any
thing, it provided even more motivation to
stay in the present and focus on having fun
and playing to the best of our abilities. I
watched the 2000-2001 Stanford golf team
compete at [the national championship],
and it was an experience that 1 would not
want to miss. The chance to compete on the
national level for an NCAA title is some
thing we look forward to."
Both Blue and Phillips proved essential
as the Cardinal battled a Stanford layout
that had Ryan Moore of UNLV and
Spencer Levin of New Mexico, the No. 1 and
No. 3 players in the country, respectively,
frustrated all week.
Though the two finished at 12 over par
and tied for just 72nd place overall. Blue
contributed a one-over-par 71 in Stanford's
final round while Phillips notched rounds of
72 and 73 on Friday and Saturday.
"I'm excited to finally make it [to the
NCAA Championship], especially this year
since we are going to play a great course,"
Blue said. "It's nice for us to have a chance
to really make a statement in the last tour
nament of our careers. I'm definitely going
to enjoy every minute of the finals knowing
it will be my last tournament. It's much bet
ter to be playing rather than watching the
highlights on the Golf Channel."
Sophomore Zack Miller (73-74-74) fin
ished in a tie for 66th place, while fellow
sophomore Matt Savage (71-84-76) round
ed out the scoring for Stanford at 118 th.
In a departure from the past, the Cardi
nal must get down to business in late May in
preparation for the June 1 trip to Maryland.
"People think we are lucky to be [at the
NCAA Championship]," Miller said. "We
just have to look at it like it is just another
tournament. We have a chance to be a giant
killer, and there's not a better feeling in the
world to be an underdog and come out on
top."
Sounds like there might just be some
Gatorade left.
