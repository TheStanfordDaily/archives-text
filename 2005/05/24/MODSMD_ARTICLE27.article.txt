# Cardinal women take 19th at Sunriver
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Things one needed at the women's NCAA
Golf Championship in Sunriver, Ore.: golf clubs,
mental toughness ... long underwear.Though the
Bay Area has been easing into summer weather
for more than a month, the forecast at last week's
NCAA Championship called for the nation's best
golf in some of the worst conditions. During a
week that saw everything from hail to horizontal
rain and 40-degree temperatures, the No. 24 Stan
ford women's golf team finished in 19th place to
wrap up its season.
No. 1 Duke atoned for last year's shocking
third-place finish by claiming the third national
title in school history, clearing No. 2 UCLA by five
strokes. The Blue Devils' Anna Grzebien claimed
top individual honors with a four-round total of
286 (two over par) fora one-shot victory.
Against a 24-team field packed with the na
tion's top players, the Cardinal were confident but
realized the need for the year's biggest perform
ance on the year's biggest stage. In her final colle
giate tournament, senior Wendra Liang answered
the call for Stanford in Tuesday's opening round.
"I knew it was my last tournament and maybe
the highest stage I'll ever play in again," Liang said.
"It took some effort for me to stay focused on the
task at hand and not get emotional or think about
the significance of the round until it was over."
If focus was difficult, it didn't show during
those first 18 holes, as Liang fired an even-par 71
on the tournament's second-toughest day for scor
ing and grabbed a share of fourth place in the early
going.
After Liang's opening fireworks, however,
there was little to cheer about in the Stanford
camp for the rest of the week. While other West
Coast teams like UCLA and Pepperdine braved
the chilly conditions and par-71 6,312-yard Mead
ows Course, the Cardinal struggled to put solid
team scores together.
Liang's performance was a microcosm of Stan
ford's experience. After her opening round, which
included four birdies. Liang failed to record an
other birdie for the rest of the tournament, while
carding three double-bogeys in the process.
Two weeks ago, the mood was one of boundless
excitement after the Cardinal advanced to their
17th consecutive NCAA Championship in the
face of doubting experts. After Friday's closing
round, however, there was little left but disap
pointment at the end of a season and a sub-par
performance.
"I don't think that the top teams are any more
talented than we are, and I know that we all have
the ability to play as well as any of the top teams,"
junior Stephanie Lue said."We just need to find it.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't
think we needed to play perfectly — we just
played very poorly."
Despite a sour final note to end their season,
the Cardinal's future couldn't be sweeter. Liang
noted.
"I'm very jealous that I won't be around next
year," Liang said. "With everyone having im
proved so much from last year, with a strong work
ethic already grooved.and we have some really

solid recruits coming in — it will be an exciting
year to be on the team."
Aside from its Liang, Stanford will return every
member of this year's team, including, junior Kelly
Husted and sophomore Jenni Tangtiphaiboon
tana, who each earned All Pacific-10 Conference
Honorable Mention this year.
Add to the mix a pair of talented incoming
freshmen, Mari Chun (Honolulu, Hi.) and Ki-Shui
Liao (Alameda, Calif.), whom coach Caroline
O'Connor has described as one of the best recruit
ing classes in school history, and the Cardinal's
streak of NCAA Championship appearances
looks safe well into the future.
As for Liang, the Farm won't be rid of her so
easily after all. She will return next fall to work on

her co-terminal degree while helping the team
where she can. Nonetheless, she acknowledged
that this week marks not only the end of a season
but the end of a career.
"More than anything, I'll miss the time on the
road with my team, and the feeling of shared pur
pose that underlies everything," Liang said. "They
are some of my best friends in the world, and only
your teammates truly understand the challenges
and triumphs you face. It's such a rush to compete,
even in our little practice contests, but especially
when I'm out there, representing Stanford, know
ing I have to hold it together, playing against girls
who could be the next best player in the world, the
adrenaline, focus and sense of accomplishment is
hard to experience elsewhere."
