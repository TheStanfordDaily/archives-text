On Sunday, the Cardinal surged past an on
slaught of injuries to claim their 14th NCAA
Championship title from Texas in a 4-0
shutout.
On Monday, however, the reality of over
worked limbs and joints forced No. 25 senior
Erin Burdette to withdraw even before play
ing her first-round opponent, Florida's No. 13
Zerene Reyes (25-4).
Two-time defending NCAA Singles Cham
pion Amber Liu (18-3) was stifled by a shoul
der injury as she took on North Carolina's
Aniela Mojzis (28-16). The junior was all
moxie and grit as she overcame a 6-2 deficit in
a first-set tiebreaker to go up 1-0 against No.
41 Mojzis, but the injury took its toll in the sec
ond set, allowing Mojzis to break back with a
6-0 win.

Longhorns' No. 54 Petra Dizdar in Sunday's
NCAA Final, 6-3,6-3.
No. 36 Whitney Dcason, a freshman, lost a
three-hour test of endurance against fifth

6-4. No. 5 Magley (21-8) overcame a 4-0
deficit in the third set. breaking Deason's
serve and winning the next six games for the
match.

"I have no explanation for how I came
back because it was sloppy tennis," Magley
said in a press release. "Deason's a great play
er. I just was able to draw from my faith. She
made more errors toward the end and I made
my serve a lot more. Getting my first serve in
and getting the ball out of the middle really
helped."
Stanford freshman Lejla Hodzic, who is
ranked No. 49, waged a respectable battle
against Vanderbilt's No. 17 Audra Falk, losing
6-1,6-4.
On the bright side of things. No. 32 Logar

Babos, a freshman, was seeded eighth in
the tournament.
Meanwhile. No. 20 Barnes recouped a first
set loss to pull out a three-set win against Til

Reyes, whom she defeated twice as a fresh
man, including a matchup in the 2003 NCAA
