# Pharmaceutical ethics addressed
## Former Merck chief executive officer discusses drug prices, distribution 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
P. Roy Vagelos. the retired chief executive
officer and chairman of Merck and Co., dis
cussed the ups and downs experienced by the
pharmaceutical industry and ethical issues relat
ed to drug prices and distribution yesterday at
the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine.
In his introductory remarks, Arthur
Kornberg, biochemistry professor emeritus,
described Merck as the "world's most presti
gious and successful pharmaceutical company."
Today, it boasts 70.000 employees in 31 factories
and 120 countries.

Vagelos, who arrived at Merck in the mid
-19705, said he helped the industry' catapult out of
a rut, revamping traditional research strategies
with more effective biochemical methods.
"They wanted a big change at Merck, and I
undertook to bring that change about," Vagelos
said.
Under his direction, the company's
researchers tackled the so-called "cholesterol
hypothesis," and the results were stunning.
During the five-year development of
Lovastatin, a drug that decreases blood choles
terol, there was a 30 percent decrease in the
number of strokes occurring in the United
States. There was also significant reductions in
the number of heart attacks, coronary heart dis
eases and other conditions prompted by high
blood cholesterol.
Largely due to these successes, the public was
very enthusiastic about the growing pharmaceu
tical industry in the late 1980s and early 19905.
Now, however, the industry has lost support and
"dropped into the lowest of industries, including
cigarette manufacturing," Vagelos
said.
'ITie cause of this disapproval is
two-pronged he said, explaining that
both high drug prices and the indus
try's unwillingness to provide afford
able drugs to patients in developing
countries have contributed to the
problem.
Pharmaceutical prices are based
on "saving lives, keeping people out
of hospitals, in work and leading nor
mal lives" Vagelos said.
While a year's worth of
Lovastatin costs less that $1,000,
powerful AIDS medications can cost
more than $12,000 per year. Vagelos
argued that these prices are reason
able because the drugs save lives.
"Are these good values?" Vagelos
asked the audience. "I'll say. You go
from being dead to being alive."
The problem has been exacerbat
ed by countries like Canada that
offer lower-priced drugs, he said.
Americans foot most of the bill for
the development of drug products
that are then distributed worldwide,
he added.
Vagelos then pointed out that
Merck has taken action to respond
to developing countries' demands
for drugs at subsidized prices. One
such drug was Ivermectin.
In the mid-iySOs. Ivermectin was
the most effective drug available for
killing parasites in animals such as
cattle, pigs and horses. The drug has
most recently been added to dog
food to kill parasites and round
worms. It is completely safe, Vagelos
said, because it can travel through
the bloodstream without negatively
affecting neurological processes.
Ivermectin can also be adminis
tered to humans. Merck researchers
have discovered that one tablet a
year can prevent river blindness, a
common disease in sub-Saharan
Africa caused by parasitic microfilar
ia that destroy eyesight. Merck exec
utives also worked with the U.S. gov
ernment and the World Health
Organization to provide free doses

of Ivermectin to patients in this
region.
"One tablet per year virtually
eliminates the problem," Vagelos
said. "We virtually eradicated the
disease. That wouid be a first — a
company that developed the drug
and then made it available to oth
ers."
He added that Merck leaders
pledged to provide the treatment to
everyone in the world who needed it
and that 29 million free doses have
been administered thus far.
But Merck does not have a per
fect record when it comes to supply
ing drugs to developing countries.
Along with other pharmaceutical
companies. Merck refused to reduce
the price tag on AIDS drugs or to
offer royalty-free drug licenses,
Vagelos said. This has damaged the
industry in the eyes of the public he
said, even now when many compa
nies are implementing programs to
provide AIDS medicine where it is
needed.
"We have an enormous black
eye," Vagelos said, referring to the
pharmaceutical field as a whole.
"This is something the industry
could have done years earlier but
didn't. It'll be a while before we can
catch up to where we were."
Vagelos predicted that in the
future, drugs will be able to specifi
cally target populations where they
will be most effective. The develop
ments in the next 50 years will be
more exciting than those in the past
50, he added.
Pfizer, Inc. is currently the world's
largest pharmaceutical company
with annual profits of around $53 bil
lion. Vagelos said. But not all phar
maceutical companies are experienc
ing such promising growth.
Vagelos said today's industry is in
a "plateau period," and that he looks
forward to new discoveries to treat
cancer and AIDS.
"I think, all in all, that the indus
try, pharmaceutical and biotech, is
changing, has changed and will con
tinue to do so as we respond to
developments in science," he said.
"Someday we'll look back on this
time and think about how slow it was
and how happy we are where we are
then."

Pfizer, Inc. is currently the world's
largest pharmaceutical company
with annual profits of around $53 bil

and how happy we are where we are
then."
