# Senate discusses ITSS changes
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
Members of the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate gathered last night for their penultimate
meeting of the academic year to hear a presen
tation given by Information Technology Systems
and Services staff on the changes in telecommu
nications fees for next year. Additionally, the
Senate passed 60 appropriations bills, more than
half of which will affect student group funding
for the 2005-2006 fiscal year.
Ethan Rikleen, residential computing and
network systems administrator, described the
proposal to place a telecommunications fee on
student's quarterly bill that would cover in
room network connection and phone charges,
instead of charging students through a separate
monthly bill. 'ITiis policy change would go into
in September.
The change would be implemented to

reduce overhead costs by billing network con
nections and phone activations, and to enhance
safety on campus by ensuring there is a phone
present to call 911. Students will be charged
$14.33 for networking and $1.67 for phone
service per month.
The Senate also considered regular discre
tionary funding bills for the remainder of this
academic year. One student community group
called Step Out. which teaches children from
East Palo Alto and other areas dance and cre
ative movement, protested the amount allocat
ed to their group by the appropriations com
mittee.
Junior Desiree Conrad, financial officer of
Step Out, said that the Senate did not distrib
ute $830 to them for costumes for the chil
dren's dance recital, which it had in previous
years. Appropriations Chair Faris Mohiuddin.a
sophomore, explained the commit
tee's logic.
"We'd love to fund the costumes
in principle, but [the Senate] is in a
financial crunch," Mohiuddin said.
"If the T-shirts are not essential for
all activities to take place, such as
the dance, the Senate does not
cover the costs."
Several other senators felt, how
ever. that because community serv
ice groups are generally underfund
ed and the costumes were for chil
dren. not Stanford students, the
Senate should provide more fund
ing to the group now.
Ultimately, in an 8-5 vote, the
Senate overiurned the appropria

tions committee's decision and
amended the funding bill to allocate
the $S3() to Step Out. Senator Kai
Lukoff, a freshman, suggested that
the amount be lowered to $770,
arguing that since 10 Stanford stu
dent volunteers would also be
receiving costumes, they should
have to pay for their own. The
amendment did not pass.
Student organizations that
require money at the beginning of
fall quarter, such as groups that hold
activities during New Student
Orientation, requested early fund
ing from the Senate at last night's
meeting. All of these bills passed,
which totaled $31,398 in funding for
next year.
The total amount appropriated
to student groups in the 2(K)4-2(H)5
fiscal year was $401,883, over 70
percent of which went toward pro
cramming activities.
