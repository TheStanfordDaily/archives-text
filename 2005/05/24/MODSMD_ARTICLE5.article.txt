Three Iraqi students traded ideas about education
and politics with Hoover Institution Fellows
Williamson Evers and Larry Diamond last night at a
panel organized by the student group Stanford-Iraq
Student Exchange, or SISE.
Six days into their stay in the United States, Iraqi
university students Shava Ibrahim, Sasan Hasan and
Shayan Shahir often found themselves in agreement
with the American researchers, but the hour-and-a
half discussion at the Bechtel International Center
revealed some differences in their outlooks as well.
Optimistic about Iraq's future, Hasan, a civil engi
neering major from Salahaddin University in Irbil,
Iraq, bitterly criticized Saddam Hussein and said he
looked forward to a new Iraqi leader who would dis-
Iraqi students compare education systems

tribute resources effectively and
facilitate economic development.
Evers former senior educa
tion advisor to U.S. Ambassador
Paul Bremer, who was the head of
the ( oalition Provisional Authority
in Iraq addressed Hasan's
assumption that Iraq would entrust
power to a single political leader.
Evers argued that though the
process could be slow and frustrat
ing. Iraq would be better off build
ing a democratic government with
divided powers.
Shahir, a business management
major at Salahaddin, said the most
important issue in Iraq today is secu
rity.
Diamond, who served as senior
advisor to the ( oalition Provisional
Authority in Iraq, agreed.
I think we've failed you to some
extent, frankly," Diamond said,
addressing the Iraqi students."We've
never had enough troops, and we
don't have enough troops now."
Evers disagreed, asserting that
deploying more troops would be
intrusive. He said such a decision
would create more targets for terror
ists and impede the transition to
Iraqi self-rule.
At one point, as an aside, Evers
assured the Iraqi students that such
differences til opinion were a natural
and even desirable part of academic
discussion m the United States.
I Ins impressed Hasan, who said
that when lie returns to Iraq
where the educational system is less
interactive and more didactic — he
plans to tell people about the unique
experience ol silling side-by-side
with professors and exchanging
views.
"I hope that I can participate in
helping build a university such as we
are finding here, to build it back in
Iraq," he said.
Hie Iraqi students said that they
have already seen improvement in
their schools since the Baath Party's
downfall Until 2(H)3, Ibrahim said,
there were no foreign magazines and
lew new educational resources of

any kind.
The overthrow of Hussein, she
said,"opened the way for us to know
what is going on in the world and to
develop our minds."
Hasan illustrated one side effect
of Baathist policies when he said he
didn't know the location of his friend
Nasser's hometown in relation to
Baghdad. Evers said, and the stu
dents confirmed, that there were no
maps in their schools.
Hasan's friend was one of two
Iraqi students who had planned to

join the exchange program but were
denied visas at the last minute.
Senior J.P. Schnapper-Casteras,
director of SISE, told the students
on the panel that "the biggest victo
ry, in many ways, was just to get you
here."
All of the students who made it to
the United States hail from
Kurdistan, a region in Northeastern
Iraq that has been spared much of
the violence and unrest of the coun
try's southern Shiite strongholds.
Schnapper-Casteras said his group

had hoped to bring from all over
Iraq to campus, hut found that those
in the more unsettled regions could
not obtain the necessary documenta
tion.
Despite the troubles that contin
ue to plague Iraq — a wave of
bombings yesterday claimed more
than 50 lives — all three students
said they believe their country has a
much brighter future now that
Hussein is gone.
"Now it's going to get better and
better, 1 guess," Hasan said.
