# A 						closer look at Archimedes
## X-rays unveil ancient text 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
The intellect of ancient mathematical genius
Archimedes just became a whole lot more accessible.
Earlier this month, Stanford borrowed pieces of a
1,000-year-old manuscript from the Walters Art
Museum in Baltimore, where the entire document is
located. The segments contain passages from
Archimedes' work, which were inscribed on goat skin
during the 10th-century A.D.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, or
SLAC, examined the manuscript using X-rays pro
duced by the synchrotron storage ring at SLAC's
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, or
SSRL.
"The original text was erased with a weak acid,
scraped off with a pumice stone and the parchment
used again to make a prayer book," said SSRL
Director Keith Hodgson.
SSRL's X-ray equipment detect
ed trace amounts of iron in the ink
on the manuscript, Hodgson
explained.This caused the images to
undergo a process called fluores
cence, and a detector recorded sig
nals to create a composite image of
the pages and original writing.
SLAC physicist Uwe Bergmann.the
lead scientist on the project, said he
first learned of the manuscript when
he read about it in a magazine at a
conference in Germany.
"When I read about the fact that
there was iron in the ink. I realized
it was something we could pursue,"

Bergmann said. "1 thought that if
there was a little bit of iron left in
the ink. we might be able to look at
the script."
Although scholars have not yet
finished reading and translating the
text, he said the scanning portion of
the project has been successful.
"We are now able to read things
that we haven't been able to read
before," Bergmann said. "1 don't
think we'll be able to discover
everything, but I do think we will be
able to add something significant."
Classics Prof. Reviel Netz, who is
analyzing the revealed passages,
said he has already deciphered new
information from the manuscript.
"We made many important new
readings, the two most important
being quite earth-shaking," Netz
said. "First, a discovery of
Archimedes using infinity — it was
assumed no Greek author did.

Secondly, a discovery of
Archimedes studying combina
torics, which makes him the first
author in this genre." Combinatorics
is a branch of discrete mathematics.
Archimedes was born in 287 B.C.
in Sicily and made many contribu
tions to modern math and science
during his lifetime. Only about 10 of
his works survived, and little more
than legend is known about his life,
Netz said.
"Archimedes was undoubtedly
the most influential figure in the his
tory of exact sciences," Netz said.
"His works provide the groundwork
for two major developments — cal
culus and the application of mathe
matical methods to the study of
physics. Ilie combination of these
two developments constitutes the
essence of science as we know it."
Bergmann said that the project's
researchers are thrilled with the

accomplishment, especially since
Archimedes laid much of the
groundwork for the physical sci
ences.
"To use such an advanced tech
nology to contribute to our under
standing of Archimedes has been
very satisfying," he said.
Because SSRL is funded by the
U.S. Department of Energy, the use
of the X-rays was free, Hodgson
said, adding that there are only a
few synchrotron laboratories in the
world that possess the equipment
for such scanning.
"The important point is the peo
ple-those who know and understand
the historical object, those who have
important elements of the instru
mentation, and the x-ray physicist
who had the clever idea and con
nected all this and the team that
developed the instrumentation
together," Hodgson said.
