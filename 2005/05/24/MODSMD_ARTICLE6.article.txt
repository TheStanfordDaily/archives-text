# A
						closer look at Archimedes
## X-rays unveil ancient text 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
The intellect of ancient mathematical genius
Archimedes just became a whole lot more accessible.
Earlier this month, Stanford borrowed pieces of a
1,000-year-old manuscript from the Walters Art
Museum in Baltimore, where the entire document is
located. The segments contain passages from
Archimedes' work, which were inscribed on goat skin
during the 10th-century A.D.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, or
SLAC, examined the manuscript using X-rays pro
duced by the synchrotron storage ring at SLAC's
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, or
SSRL.
"The original text was erased with a weak acid,
scraped off with a pumice stone and the parchment
used again to make a prayer book," said SSRL
