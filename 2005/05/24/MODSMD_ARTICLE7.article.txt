To generate buzz before its scheduled
opening on June 8. the Seven Fifty Pub
and Eatery in the Graduate Community
Center served customers at a mini open
ing last night.
"Tonight is a preview of what it will be
like when it opens up," said GSC
Programming Coordinator Donna
Winston, a first-year doctoral student at
the School of Education. "Students will
really have a chance to check out the pub
in a couple weeks."
Winston said the Graduate Student

Council, which sponsored the event,
plans to celebrate the pubs grand open
ing with a party that will include food,
raffles games, prizes and a disc jockey.
"We really want people to get excited
about the pub," she said.
Mingling graduate students sipped
beer and wine last night and said they
were enthusiastically awaiting the pub's
opening.
"It's something that people have been
looking forward to," said engineering stu
dent Vijay Somandepalli, co-chair of the
Graduate Student Programming Board, a
group that organizes social events for
graduate students. "It should be fun."

"I'm extremely excited," said second
year engineering graduate student Andy
Sadhwani. "I live right across the street.
Now whenever I come home I have a
place to relax."
Both organizers and patrons at last
night's event said they hoped the pub
would serve as a hub to bring together
the large and diverse graduate student
community.
"It's a good way to meet new grad stu
dents," said law student Henry Huang.
He added that although law students
tend to socialize amongst themselves

near the Law School, the pub's loca
tion near many of their residences
could encourage them to interact
more often with other graduate stu
dents.
Somandepalli agreed, citing the
good turnout of law students at
other parties and events at the GCC
over the past few months.
"We've been totally lacking a gath
ering place for grad students," he said.
"1 think this place us going to be the
best thing for something like that."
Pub vendor and restaurateur
Maurice Carrubba, affiliated with
Palo Alto's Cafe Riace and Ciao!, a
cafe in Stanford's Terman
Engineering Center, said he hoped

the pub will cater to the tastes of
both graduate students and under
graduates.
"We want to make this a hot spot
on campus" he said. "There are a
lot of undergrads over 21."
Carrubba said the pub's menu
will offer "anything from antipasto
to burritos." It will also offer an
international beer and wine list,
breakfast, lunch and dinner items as
well as "the cheapest cappuccino on
campus." he added.
Hie pub was originally slated to
open in January, but construction
work was delayed when the kitchen
was redesigned. Carrubba said.
With the Seven Fifty open just in
time for the summer months, he
said that reaching out to students
staying on campus is "going to be
key."
The name Seven Fifty came from
