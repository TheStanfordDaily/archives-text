Join us for the second annual
Haas Center Lecture on Public Service and the University
"Wearing Many Hats: My Response to Homclessness
as a Member of the Stanford Faculty and the Palo Alto Community"
Donald A. Barr
Associate Professor of Sociology
Barr will discuss his involvement in providing services to the
homeless population surrounding Stanford, and how he brought
to that endeavor his skills as a social scientist and his sense of moral
responsibility as a community resident. In addition, Barr will address
the issue of bridging the gap between his role as a faculty member and
as a community member, and ask: Given its tremendous resources,
what is the role of the university in seeking solutions to major social
problems that confront the surrounding community?
