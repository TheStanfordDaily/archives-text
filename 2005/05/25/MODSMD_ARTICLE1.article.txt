# Students' files hacked at career center
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Career Development Center, or CDC, notified stu
dents yesterday that its computer system was "improperly
accessed from outside of the Stanford network" on May 11.
Information available on the Web site was limited to files
that generally include names, resumes, letters of recommen
dation and Social Security numbers.
It is still unknown who hacked into the site, which
included information from 19% to the present.
No student financial, credit card, driver's license or gov
ernment identification information was available at the
time of the intrusion. However, recruiter files contained
credit card numbers.
"It's so surprising," said senior Chris Herrera, who has
an account with the CDC. "I wouldn't expect that to hap
pen — for the Web site to be so vulnerable."
Approximately 9,600 students and 300 recruiters who
used the Web site at some point during the last nine years
have been notified of the problem.
The CDC sent out letters on Monday to students whose
information was accessed, and recruiter notification letters
were also mailed this week. The letters state that "Stanford
has no knowledge that your records were actually acquired
during the intrusion," adding that the notifications have
been sent out only as "an abundance of caution."

CDC, said he was unaware of the hack
until contacted by The Daily and that
he could have appreciated more effort
on the part of the CDC to get the word
out.
"They should have sent an e-mail
instead of just a letter," he said. "Some
people don't check their mailboxes
regularly and identity theft is such a
big problem these days — it can come
back to haunt you."
In response to the intrusion,
Stanford temporarily disabled the
CDC's system and reported the inci
dent to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. The San Jose field office
is looking into the incident.
