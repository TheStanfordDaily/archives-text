# But that's not the point...
## The 						wedding party 
### 
This past weekend, I went to my first
bridal shower. Yes, the first inkling of what
the real world experience holds. She'll be
the first of my friends to get married. This
experience was surreal. 1 walked into the
house in Palo Alto and found myself in the
middle of Stepford — you know, from the
movie "Stepford Wives." Someone was
even wearing a sundress and apron.
I don't wish to offend any of these nice
people, because I just met most of them on
Sunday, and they're all really cool girls who

were very welcoming to a
total stranger. So I ask
ahead of time that they
forgive me for my judg
ment of this bizarre ritual.
The truth is that going
to a bridal shower is like
stepping into an alternate
universe. People wear sun
dresses (although this may
have been done ironical-

ly), and when they do champagne toasts,
they only drink one glass. There were cute
little hors d'oeuvres. We were all very po
lite. If I didn't know better, I wouldn't have
thought we were still in college. I didn't
hear a single swear word the entire time.
One of my friends said that she felt very
"adult." When we college students say
something is "adult," we either mean that
it's cosmopolitan (i.e. drinking a dirty mar
tini in black stilettos) or suburban (i.e. talk
ing about what we think of our kid's soccer
coach). This was definitely the latter — and
in this environment I felt like a total impos
tor — I felt like a kindergartener playing
"house."
Meanwhile, like kids at a birthday party,
we played games. We made wedding dress
es out of toilet paper (this is a shower stan
dard) and answered trivia questions about
the wedding couple's relationship. We won
prizes.This is what happens at all showers. It
made me feel like I'm back in grade school.
Perhaps the weirdest part for me is that
sex, when mentioned at all, is only spoken
of in relation to the honeymoon. Among my
friends, it's a pretty common practice to get
into a discussion of the techniques and
philosophies surrounding sexual acts, but
suddenly in the middle of this cutesy deco
rated living room, I found myself giggling at
everything sexual like I was 13 again.
It's not that the subject didn't come up,
but when it did, it seemed unnatural — and
I suspect that it's because in our culture,
weddings force people to become tradition
al. Wedding talk is unlike any other talk —
we giggle. We make jokes about the honey
moon. We "ooh" and "ahh" over dish towels
and vases. We make sexual innuendos out of
everything. But we don't actually talk about
it, because that would ruin the whole
mythology surrounding the event. And we
don't let men into the room because that
ruins the whole myth surrounding what
women do and talk about. It's positively ar
chaic and completely foreign to me — but I
found myself participating in the ritual any
way, like Pavlov's dog, culturally condi
tioned to respond to wedding bells.
I think that one reason why I was so
completely out of my element at the wed
ding shower relates to the fact that in my
family, weddings aren't really on the radar.
My parents got married in a courthouse and
my aunt got married in her parents' back
yard. I was only six when I went to the only
fancy wedding I've been to, so I don't re
member it at all. It's a shock to find wed
dings staring me in the face, all of a sudden
a part of my life and the lives of my contem
poraries.
Supposedly, an absurd percentage of
Stanford students marry other Stanford
students, although not necessarily people
they met during their time here. I can deal
with that statistic — what I'm really not
ready to come to terms with is the idea that
people I know are going to start getting
married, like, well — NOW. 1 thought we
were supposed to be finding jobs and crap
py apartments and shacking up with signif
icant others and struggling to cover the cost
of our bar tab — not planning seating
arrangements and place settings. That's for
another generation, and I'm not ready to
join that world.
I hope that when I have a bridal shower (if
I have one, which I doubt will happen), it can
represent me more and represent marriage
with a capital "M" less. It's just not my style. I
hope that my shower will be vulgar and care
less of matrimonial traditions, because that's
what I am, and I plan on staying that way
even when I have a ring on that finger.
I don't want to be a spoilsport. I think it's
fantastic to get married and have a tradi
tional shower and all that jazz — if you re
ally want it that way. It's your life, after all.
My friend from this past Sunday is definite
ly getting married for all the right reasons,
and I couldn't be happier for her. And I
have to admit that I had fun playing Pin
the-Lips on the Heartthrob.
