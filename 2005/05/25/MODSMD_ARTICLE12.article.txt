# Heading home

With the end of the year fast approach
ing, many students are dreading the stress
and confusion of moving out of their
rooms and taking care of their possessions
for the summer. Below are 8 helpful hints
and reminders for avoiding moving out
melodrama.
Shipping: USPS vs. FedEx vs. UPS

United
States Postal
Service, or
USPS, might
be the sim
plest way to
ship boxes
since the post

office is right on campus. Long lines can be
an issue as move-out day approaches, so
ship early if you can. Prices fora 10-pound
box shipped range from $4.84 to $37.50 de
pending on the size of the box and how fast
you want it to arrive at its destination. Use
the postage calculator at
http://www.usps.com/tools/calcu
latepostage/welcome.htm.
A 10-pound box shipped via UPS can
also range from $13 (for seven-day deliv
ery) to $104 (for next morning delivery).
UPS will pick up boxes from your dorm
(fora fee) if you call them ahead of time.
UPS has drop boxes located on the corner
of Serra St.and Palm Drive and also at 251
Campus drive — self-service locations
that accept U.S. air and international docu
ments and small packages.
"1 sent a bike home with UPS once — I
even bought insurance," said junior John
Duchi. "Then they broke the box, lost some
stuff and wouldn't pay for it. UPS does
pretty well with other things, though, espe
cially if you're shipping it on the ground
then it's usually pretty cheap and reliable."
A 10-pound box shipped via FedEx
costs between $8.38 (for one to five day de
livery) and $52 for overnight delivery. Like
UPS. FedEx will pick up boxes if you call
them. However, it's cheaper to drop them
off at the nearest FedEx store. The closest
FedEx drop off point to Stanford is at
Kinko's on California Avenue in Palo Alto.

Stanford offers summer

storage for personal proper-

o i i i
ty, including bikes, fora fee.

You can order online, but be

sure to make arrangements

ahead of time, as there is no same-day serv
ice available. Prices are by quarter and range
from $11 to $29 depending on the size of the
box. Check http://www.stanford.edu/
dept/hds/shs/summerstorage or contact
your housing director for more information.
No student property may be left in house
property storage areas over the summer.
"The best would be to store your stuff in
a friend's garage," Duchi said. "But since
some of us more unfortunate souls from a
long way away do not have friends with
garages nearby, storing in something like
the Shurgard is usually a good way to keep
all my junk together."
There are also several off-campus stor
age options to consider. Public Storage
provides all the large boxes that appear
around campus. As they can be relatively
expensive, it can be a good idea to share
one box with friends and split the cost.
They are kept in a protected and tempera

ture controlled facility over the summer
and are delivered directly to your resi
dence next year. Call (877 ) 844-6891 for
more information.

If you want your mail to be forwarded
to your summer address, you have two op
tions: go to the Post Office and ask for the
USPS form 3575 to fill out. The other op
tion is to go to
https://moversguide.usps.com/7refer
ral=USPS and fill out the easy form online.
You can specify the start and end date for
your change of address. Or you could pa
tiently wait until September to see what
you received over the summer. Whatever
floats your boat.

All furniture must be

placed in its original form — de-

bunking beds, un-stacking

dressers, etc. — and put in the same

configuration you found it in the be
ginning of the year. If you can't re-

member what it looked like when you first
moved in, here's a tip: Put a bed, desk, dress
er and wardrobe on each side of the room.
If you still have questions, ask your housing
supervisor for specifics. Wipe down any sur
faces as well to remove sticky substances —
and fines. You will be billed for any needed
cleaning, for movement and reassembly of
furniture and for the removal and disposal
of any items you abandon. You and any re
maining or departing roommates will share
the cost for clean-up needed in the common
areas. If substantial cleaning is required.you
will be charged $50 ($1(X) for Mirrielees). If
extensive cleaning is required, the fees will
increase to $200.
"Be sure to caulk all the holes your
roommate(s) have made in the wall. And
make sure you filled out your room condi
tion forms honestly," cautioned sopho
more Kellie Brownell.
Anyone staying past the move-out date
will be billed $175 for every day or fraction
of a day that he or she stays past the exit
time. If you need to stay longer, remember
to file a request with your housing supervi
sor immediately.

Stanford offers summer bike storage to
students for $28 per quarter or $17 per
month. All bikes will be stored in the base
ments of Stern Twain East, and you can
pick up your bike in September by ap
pointment. You can also store your bike in
a storage crate rented for the summer.
Schedule your bike storage online at
http://www.stanford.edu/

dept/hds/shs/summerstorage.
"If you don't get your bike in storage,
the police will come and put a notice on it,"
Brownell said. "If you're gone on a trip,
that can happen to you, too, so be careful.
They pretty much put those notices on
every bike they see because they assume
they've been left for the summer." *

There are
a number of
options out
there for re
selling text
books or
other books.
You can sell
them back

to the Stanford Bookstore, on eßay.com,
Amazon.com,Textopedia.com (sells direct
ly to Stanford students) or at used book
stores, to friends or to other used textbook
Web sites. The Bookstore offers students
half the price of the original book price.
"I think Textopedia is pretty much the
best option for students looking to get the
most cash for their books," said freshman
Blake Masters. "By eliminating the mid
dleman, Textopedia allows the seller to
walk away with considerably more, while
still giving the buyer a better deal than
would the bookstore."

Return your key di-

rectly to your resident as-

sistant or to your residence

office.There will usually be a slot outside the of
fice especially for this purpose. When a key is
lost, the door is re-keyed regardless of the cir
cumstances of the loss. Currently, re-keying
costs around $70 — it may vary depending on
the residence. Stanford housing asks that that
students report lost keys immediately because
of the safety risk that a lost key represents, ac
cording to the Housing and Dining Web site. If
a key is returned after the deadline, the door
will still be rekeyed. You do keep your post-of
fice key, but remember to renew your RO. Box
on Axess.

There are many people who could use
that extra sweater you don't need or that t
shirt you've never worn. Keep your eye out
for collection boxes from community serv
ice groups in dorms and dining halls. Or you
can call one of these collection agencies in
Palo Alto accepting clothing: Bread of Life
