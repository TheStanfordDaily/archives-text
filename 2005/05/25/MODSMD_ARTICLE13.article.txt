# The
						Sims 2 movie contest looks at college life
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
The Sims 2 — a popular computer game where
players control every aspect of their computer
characters' lives, from their jobs to their relation
ships — is partnering with the University of South
ern California film school to sponsor a movie-mak
ing contest directed specifically toward students.
The contest calls for people to create a movie
based on the theme of "A Day in the Life of a Stu
dent" using The Sims 2 movie-making technology.
Anyone over the age of 13 is eligible to participate.
"The great thing about The Sims 2
moviemaking technology is that it's very user
friendly," said Desiree Baldwin, the public rela
tions coordinator for Electronic Arts, the com
pany who manufactures The Sims 2. "You don't
need any prior experience with movie making or
any technology know-how. It does take a little bit
of training, but it's very easy to use and you can
log onto The Sims 2 Web site for help."
The Sims 2 includes a camera feature embed
ded in the game that players can use to make
and edit movies.
"You just press the filming button that lets
you capture game play footage and save it as a
movie file," said Julie Kanarowski, product man
ager for The Sims 2. "Since the game has a three
dimensional environment, you can put the cam
era at any position and you have complete con
trol of the camera. The movie footage is then
saved into a folder on your computer and you
can edit the footage to create a movie."
The entries will be judged by a panel from the
USC film school based on the plot, character de
velopment, level of originality and use of music.
The contest will also award a couple of genre
awards including best comedy, best drama and
best documentary.
According to Kanarowski, the idea for the
theme of "A Day in the Life of a Student" came
from a Sims 2 expansion pack called "The Sims
2: University," which offers new content for the
game, such as professors, fraternity houses, li
braries, a student union and dorm rooms, which
lends itself well for this kind of story line.
"The concept of the day in the life of student
ruminates most with college students, but it is not
exclusively targeted toward college students," Ka
narowski said. "A lot of older people have gone to
college, and younger people may have an idea of
what the life of a student is life from pop culture."
The Sims 2 sponsored two previous movie
making contests, with participants submitting
movies from all over the world.
"By partnering with the USC film school, we
hope to open up the field for better movies,"
Baldwin said. "Hopefully university students
that already have an idea about movie making
will combine that knowledge with The Sims 2
software to improve quality of movies and raise
the bar for the contest."
The winner of the contest will be able to
choose either a prize of $5,000 or a one-month
internship working along side The Sims 2 devel
opment team in Redwood City. The second
place winner will receive a computer and third
place winner will receive a video card.
"It's nearly impossible to get an internship
here, so the stakes are really high," Baldwin said.
At Stanford, students said they are excited about
the contest, but recognize that making a good
movie takes time — even with advanced software.
"I took a class last quarter on computer game
culture, business, and design and in the class we
talked about how performance has always been
a part of gaming," said sophomore Jeremy Hoff
man. "Newer technology, such as The Sims,
makes this easier and more fun."
Hoffman, however.said that college life does not
leave him with much time to enter such contests.
"I see people spend hours and hours develop
ing their online personas in games like that," he
said. "But personally, I pretty much stopped
playing time-intensive online games since com
ing to college. There's so much going on at Stan
ford that I don't feel the need for it."
All contest entries must be submitted by
11:59 on May 30.
