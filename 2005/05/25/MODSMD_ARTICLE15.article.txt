# Deceased family members turned into priceless jewels

### DESDEMONA BANDINI DAILY TITAN 
(U-WIRF) FULLERTON. Calif-
Chicago pilot Rusty Vandenßiesen used to
visit his grandmother in Germany and stare
at the religious icons on her walls, pondering
his mortality. He didn't like thinking about
what might happen to him after he died. He
didn't want to be stuck in an urn on top of a
fireplace or have his tombstone left unat
tended.
One day, Vandenßiesen realized that cre
mation creates carbon and carbon creates
diamonds, and that epiphany gave birth to
his company. Life Gem, which takes the car
bon from a deceased loved one or pet and
creates a timeless heirloom and memorial: A
yellow diamond.
"Having a physical memorial offers

grieving individuals a way of symbolizing
the relationship that existed between them
and the deceased," said Tony Bell, a
California State University at Fullerton
sociology professor who teaches a class on
death and dying.
"The death of a beloved spouse, in com
parison to other life events, has been rated as
producing the highest level of stress and lit
erature suggests this grief is likely to last for
years."
Statistics from the Cremation Association
of North America show that out of the 2 mil
lion deaths in 1970, there were 90,000 crema
tions performed. In 2(X)3, there were 2.5 mil
lion deaths and more than 700,(XX) crema
tions performed.
"If you take a moment and look at the
options out there, you may at first think it is
creepy, but it is actually the least creepy

option of all," said Mike Herro, Life Gem's
chief financial officer.
Creating a Life Gem is a four-part
process. Herro said that Life Gem requires
one standard measuring cup of ashes from
the deceased and that one cup can create 10-
12 diamonds.
'Hie first step is choosing the diamond's
size and cut. Round is the most popular cut,
but princess and radiant are also available.
Next, the carbon is subjected to extremely
high heat for purification purposes and the
carbon turns into graphite. Then, the
graphite is put into a unique diamond press
while heat and pressure are applied. Finally,
the diamonds are cut according to specifica
tions, graded and then certified for authen
ticity.
Depending on the size and cut selected,
the process takes four-six months and cost

ranges from $2,500 to $14,000. In the end, the
result is a yellow diamond monument of a
loved one. The largest Life Gem made to
date is 1.55 carats.
Oscar Aurelio, a CSUF biology professor,
said the trick is all in how the body is cremat
ed and the impurities are disposed. Aurelio is
not sure how the company does that.
"On the Life Gem site you can see that
the diamonds are yellowed — low quality —
and one would be paying for the 'unique
ness' and labor of making the diamonds,"
Aurelio said. "Of course, there is no way a
customer would know that the diamond they
receive was actually made from their loved
one or was a castoff from a jeweler down the
street."
Aurelio had no prior knowledge of the
new Life Gem process and had his doubts.
"It is possible to synthetically make dia

monds, I just don't know if it is possible to
make one from a 'loved one' or pet," Aurelio
said.
Kelly Bovard, a United States Geological
Survey scientist and CSUF professor, said
that in theory it would be possible to take
carbon atoms from the deceased and turn it
into a diamond.
"I have definitely heard of making dia
monds in laboratories. I know that is done
and 1 know small diamonds can be made, but
I am not sure about larger diamonds. As for
using the tissue of dead loved ones? No, I
have never heard of this," Bovard said.

"Joey" recently announced on "The Carson
Daly Show" that she planned to turn her
deceased dog into a Life Gem, leaving Daly
to question if the dog would be used to cre
ate earrings or a necklace.
