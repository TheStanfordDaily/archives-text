## Editorial At Stanford, advising is a two-way process 
### 
Advise: to offer advice to; counsel.
For most freshmen and undeclared
upperclassmen, this bare-bones defini
tion does not even begin to cover the
laundry list of qualities that make up a
desired advisor. Unfortunately, as many
of them soon realize, this is the most like
ly end-result of going through the Stan
ford advising system.
Broader reform would be nice, but stu
dents have demanded sweeping changes for
lime immemorial. While we wait for Stan
ford to try to perfect its advising system, stu
dents should step up and take the initiative
to get the advising they want and deserve.
Realistically, at a university of Stan
ford's size, it is not always possible to get
the close-knit perks afforded by smaller
institutions. Iliere are many dedicated
faculty here who encourage students to
attend office hours and linger after lec
ture to talk to students. But for every story
like that, there are those about freshmen
matched with advisors who do not have
time to meet one-on-one once the school
year kicks in. And there are upperclass
men who have similar problems: Some of
the best advisors are so busy that they are
only available once a week for two hours
for all of their students.
In some departments, students are
given a list of advisors to choose from and
are discouraged, by a tedious petition
process, from choosing advisors outside
the department.This limits options partic
ularly for interdisciplinary majors, who
are expected to pursue a varied course of

study and may be more suited to be ad
vised by a more multidisciplinary profes
sor from places like the Haas Center, law
school or other graduate school.
This is not to say that Stanford is de
void of the right mentors for every stu
dent, as there are countless professors
with distinctive talents in almost every
imaginable field. However, it is useless to
tell people that you attend the university
where Nobel Prize winning professors
teach unless you actually work up the
nerve to make contact with them yourself.
So here is what we think is the bottom
line: Stop complaining and go talk to pro
fessors. That's the reality here. No one
should hold your hand to Sweet Hall or to
your department's headquarters.
Also, you should know that there is a
difference between an "advisor" who is
officially supposed to help you complete
requirements to graduate with your
major and a "mentor" with whom you can
really develop a rapport and can inspire
you with his / her work. You may have one
advisor on paper but that isn't to say that
you shouldn't reach out to a number of
different faculty for mentorship.
This is the time of year when most stu
dents set out with an idealistic wish list of
advisor qualities, only to be crushed when
they realize that they're only getting the
minimum counseling they need. It may be
time to be more realistic about advising and
start thinking seriously about finding some
mentors who will impact your life beyond
the standard dictionary definition.
