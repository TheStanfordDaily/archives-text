# Techie repairs the world
## The answers are in outer space
### 
1 was quite stumped re
garding the topic of this,
my last, substantive col
umn. I thought about writ
ing about a whole host of
boring things like fili
busters and Israel, but
none of these had the req
uisite sexiness. 1 finally
went outside, sat and
stared up at the daytime

sky.
Looking at the sky, 1 remembered that
my problems weren't so big. I'm just one
man on one tiny planet that orbits among
one of the 10,(MM),()(H),(M)(),()(M),0<M),(MK),(XX)
or so stars in the universe. Somewhere out
there. I'm sure there are alien intelligences
that could blast my mind with their complex
ruminations.
And I knew then that it is man's destiny
to see these alien beings somewhere. Many
people regard space travel as a boondoggle.
Many of these same people regard Social
Security and Medicaid / Medicare as the
best things in the world. Newsflash, guys, we
spend hundreds of billions of dollars on this
stuff without accomplishing things nearly as
cool as the $10 billion per year we spend on
space travel does.
Furthermore, space travel holds the solu
tion to every one of the world's problems.
Not enough space? Don't worry, there's
plenty more real estate in the solar system.
Not enough fuel? Well, the gas giants are
made of materials ripe for fusion.
But alt this pales next to the coolness fac
tor. Space is just cool. Everyone wants to see
moon colonies. Everyone wants to see man

become free of the doomsday bomb. And
everyone wants to speak to aliens.
TTiese aliens aren't going to be cute an
thropomorphic earth-like creatures.They're
gonna be weird guys, with minds that work
in totally different ways. Who knows what
kind of philosophies and art forms an alien
culture could develop. It's entirely likely
that some alien has come up with the mean
ing of life as we speak.
Right now. President George W. Bush is
the only one interested in space travel, al
beit at a glacial pace. The Democrats have
attacked it, seemingly because it's Bush
backed, rather than for any real reasons of
ideology.
Now, I realize that there are technical
problems here, but, quite frankly, 1 don't
care. Launch costs, radiation, the problem
of closed environments, etc. â€” they are all
solvable. There is no scientific reason why
mankind can't make at least the four light
year trip to the nearest star. We could cer
tainly get to and establish permanent
bases on mars and the moon using the
technology we have right now. And it
wouldn't cost more than $20 billion more
dollars per year, which is much less than
we spend on useless military innovations
like missile defense and the Joint Strike
Fighter.
The sooner we open up new frontiers, the
sooner we gain access to advanced alien
knowledge and. frankly, we could use it.
