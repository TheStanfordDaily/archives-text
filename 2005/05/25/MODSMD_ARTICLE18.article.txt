Runyan dismisses bad ideas without
good reasons
I am writing in response to Andrea Run
yan's column,"Deep ecology: no more 'Peo
ple,' " (May 19). While I have no problem
with the social and political sentiment be
hind the article, I am concerned about Run
yan's overly dismissive treatment of other
people's views.
First, Runyan misrepresents Christopher
Lasch's view of our narcissistic culture as one
that is merely "selfish." In Lasch's view, the
narcissism of our culture is not found in its
lack of consideration for other cultures,
human or non-human, but in its obsession
with the concepts of "self" and "self-discov
ery." In addition, Lasch worries that love and
worship, which require acts of subordinating
oneself to others, have been re-imagined by
contemporary civilization as mere psycho
logical needs that need to be fulfilled.
Runyan's casual reference to the "need to
worship something" is a perfect example of
this. This is calling the "need" more impor
tant that the "something" that is being wor
shipped, which is to again place a narcissistic

focus on the self. I am not accusing Runyan
of narcissism; I am only pointing out that the
narcissism of our culture is much deeper and
more complex than Runyan grants, and that
common historical roots with one's oppo
nents should not he ignored.
My second concern is with this:"I person
ally don't believe in 'God,' but I certainly be
lieve in the earth (1 can see it, feel it, no one
asks me whether 1 believe in it, etc.) ..." I
should say I can't imagine that Runyan is any
less religious than 1 am. But the grounds for
my feeling, and 1 should hope for hers as well,
are, to reuse my own words, are much more
than the fact that God cannot be seen and felt
and that people ask me if 1 believe in it. I only
raise this point out of the nightmarish thought
of someone writing 'i personally don't be
lieve in 'evolution,' but I believe in the Bible.
I can see it, I can feel it, and no one asks me if
I believe in it." When Runyan or anyone else
writes about dismissing bad ideas without
good reasons, she encourages others to dis
miss good ideas with bad reasons.
