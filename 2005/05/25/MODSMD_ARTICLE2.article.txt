# Bytes Cafe closes its doors
## Vendor of the Packard eatery terminated contract early 
### JENNY ALIEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If you hear an electrical engineering major's stomach
grumbling in early June, you'll know why â€”as of May 31,
Bytes Cafe, located on the first floor of the David Packard
Electrical Engineering Building, will be closed until a new ven
dor is contracted. The current contract was slated to end on
June 30, but the vendor requested an earlier termination date.
"Electrical engineering and computer science students
seem quite annoyed by the news," said Adam Beberg, first
year computer science graduate student. "Much inconven
ience and hunger will result."
The process for selecting a new vendor will start in June
with a new vendor contract being signed before the end of the
month, said Packard Facilities Manager John Mendoza in an
e-mail sent to electrical engineering students on Tuesday
morning. Bytes Cafe will likely not re-open until late July or
early August.
"If no other vendors take over, it's unfortunate for the res
idents of Packard," said electrical engineering doctoral student
Robert Schaffer.
Bytes Cafe opened in the Science and Engineering
Quadrangle in 2(MX). Seating 55 patrons, the cafe drew many
students, faculty and staff for its popular rosemary chicken
sandwiches and hand-roasted coffee.
