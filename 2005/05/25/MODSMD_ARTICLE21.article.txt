## The next Manhattan Projects
### 
In 1942, the United
States faced a daunting re
ality. Within the walls of
the Pentagon, officials be
lieved that the Germans
and their Axis partners
were close to developing a
weapon more powerful
than any that had ever be
fore been unleashed on
civilization: the atom
bomb.

In the face of this existential threat, the
Pentagon made the only choice it could: It
decided to win the race. Pentagon officials
took all the resources and American ingenu
ity they could muster and put them to work
to beat the Germans. And we won.
The time has come for the government of
this once-and-future-great nation to take
upon itself not one, but three, more endeav
ors on the scale of the Manhattan Project, if
not larger. To ensure the prosperity of the
United States, for generations to come, we
need to make serious, large-scale improve
ments in energy, education and healthcare.
The solution to high gas prices is not, Mr.
President, to pump more. Many experts pre
dict that in the next few years, we will hit
global peak production capacity. And with
developing countries, especially China,
sucking up more and more oil by the day, we
need a Plan B.

Plan B comes in the form of domestic
sources of renewable energy. It comes in the
form of hybrid and hydrogen-fueled cars
and improved public transportation. It
comes in the form of safer nuclear power
and efforts to reduce consumption. Not rely
ing on the Saudi cartel for fossil fuels will
give us much more leverage in foreign poli
cy, help the environment and create a lot of
jobs in the process.
But we won't have enough scientists and
engineers to undertake this task if we con
tinue to let our education system languish
the way it has. It is in the educational arena
that we are in grave danger of losing the
edge that has made our economy the best in
the world.
China and India each graduate three
times as many engineers as we do. With the
information revolution's expansion to even
the most remote of global locales, you'd bet
ter believe that more than manufacturing
and call center jobs will find their ways else
where. Not only will workers in developing
countries be cheaper than workers in Amer
ica, they'll also be smarter and more produc
tive.
And they'll lead healthier lives. The
healthcare system in the United States is in
shambles. Even at Stanford, the cost of Car
dinal Care has gone up from $368 during the
2(X)2-2(K)3 academic year to $597 next year.
That's a 62 percent increase. In three years.

Healthcare costs will continue to rise,
and more people will he uninsured for one
simple reason: The demand for healthcare
is extremely inelastic. If there were a drug
or a surgical procedure out there that
would save your life, you'd spend all the
money you have to get it. Because what's
all the money in the world to you if you're
dead?
All three of these initiatives require two
things: government leadership and govern
ment spending. The private sector has facili
tated the creation of our oil economy, only
provides elementary and secondary educa
tion for the wealthy, and has utterly exploit
ed our demand for healthcare. We, as a soci
ety. as a community, have to be prepared to
spend what it takes to meet these most dire
of threats.
These are the great existential challenges
facing the United States in our time. More so
than terrorism and Social Security (the two
issues that the Bush administration has cho
sen to focus on), these three issues present
the greatest threat to our future.
But they also present three great oppor
tunities. Once we recognize that these are
the issues that we must deal with on a na
tional scale, we have the ability to rise to
meet these challenges.
We just need to show the willpower.
