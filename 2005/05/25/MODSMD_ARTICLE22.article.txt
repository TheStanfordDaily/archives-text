## Editorial on Newsweek 'outrageous' 
### NATHAN MINTZ 
I just found out today that one of my
closest childhood friends, who graduated
from West Point in 2003, is going to be de
ployed to Iraq in October. I also have a
cousin stationed in Baghdad who is a U.S.
Army infantryman. With these brave men
being the subject of my thoughts and my
prayers, I found The Daily's editorial
"Newsweek mistake distracts from larger
problem" (May 24) outrageous. To imply
that it is OK for the media to spread unver
ified information that may incite violence
and put American lives at risk is to condone
reckless behavior.
It is blatantly clear that the Newsweek re
port was used by Muslim fundamentalists to
incite violence. The Newsweek report made
little or no waves until it was picked up by
Cricket Star Imran Khan who used it in a
fiery speech on Pakistani TV to condemn
the United States. As a result. 17 people are

dead.Their blood is on that reporter's hands.
The editorial board's attempt to put up a
straw man and knock him down in order to
distract from Newsweek's lack of journalis
tic integrity shows the fact that, like the staff
at Newsweek has made it blatantly clear, it
cares more about undermining the Bush ad
ministration and gloating their own egos
with a litany of "see-I-told-you-so's" every
time something goes wrong in the war on
terror than about the safety of American
forces deployed in the region and the lives of
those in the Muslim world who are put at
risk by ignited passions.
The Daily's editorial board needs to pro
mote higher standards of accuracy no mat
ter who is reporting or who stands to lose.
While potential abuses of prisoners are a
huge concern that should be addressed pru
dently and forcefully, condoning the release
of unsubstantiated reports that could en
danger lives without applying sufficient
journalistic rigor is both reckless and a clear

sign of malicious intent.
I have already cancelled my subscription
to Newsweek (after 10 years of loyal read
ership) in reaction to this. In similar re
course to The Daily for what I have seen as
a persistent lack of editorial and journalistic
rigor, I am making it known that any future
contributions I make to Stanford as an
alumnus will be made with the stipulation
that none of the funds go to The Daily and I
will encourage all others alumni and out
side organizations to do the same. 1 will also
encourage all of my friends who remain at
Stanford to request a special-fees refund
from the Daily. 1 will continue this until The
Daily re-establishes the standards of jour
nalistic rigor that 1 feel it must possess in
order to be worthy of using Stanford's
name.
