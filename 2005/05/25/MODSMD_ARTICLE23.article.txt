## Right in the Babymaker A few departing sports wishes
### 
This will be my last sports column as a
Stanford student. With any luck, in a cou
ple of months I'll be writing in Boston.
I'm also really bad at sentimental things, to the
point where in the midst of really sappy mo
ments 1 can't stop myself from trying to pick
out the funniest possible moment to say, "The
doctors say I have a month to live." Still, I have
given sports so much, and I only want a few
things in return.
I want to win an intramural softball champi
onship with guys with whom 1 have spent the
last two or three years of my life and whom I re
spect more than most major political and reli
gious figures. Then I want to challenge the
women's varsity softball team to a game of IM

softhall,and, in all likelihood,
lose spectacularly. I also want
to have a ridiculously
overblown championship
team dinner where I will get
inappropriately drunk at 7
p.m.
I want to shave my head in
celebration of the women's
tennis team's third national
championship in four years. 1

also want to avoid the look of horror on my
mother's face when she sees that I will look like
Derek Vinyard from "American History X" in
my Commencement photos.
1 want to drink Pabst Blue Ribbon at the
Cubby Bear in Chicago this June. I want to mill
around with a buzz on in the middle of Wave
land Avenue. I want to see a real live cornfield
in a context other than out the window of a
plane.
I want to move all my stuff into a tiny, cold
apartment in a city where I will know, at most,
maybe five people, and put a Giants flag up on
the wall. I want to see Fenway for the first time,
and watch the World Champion Boston Red
Sox â€” a phrase my granddad never heard in
his 77-year lifespan. I want a job doing some
thing profoundly unproductive that allows me
to wear a baseball cap and Rainbow sandals
while on the job.
I want to finagle a weekend trip to Vegas so
I can play poker at the Bellagio. While there, I
also want to have a meaningless garbage-time
field goal win me just enough money to make
the trip "free."
I want to watch my friends play minor
league baseball for teams like the Burlington
(1A) Bees, the Montgomery (AL) Biscuits and
the Salem-Keizer (OR) Volcanoes. I want to
drive aimlessly around Middle America hitting
golf balls with an aluminum baseball bat until
the police chase me off whatever public facility
I am trespassing on. I want to eat a hoagie while
watching a Phillies game, a grinder with the
Yankees and a po'boy with the Astros.
I want to be paid to attend a sporting event.
I want to ask an editor if he will allow me to
wear a sombrero in my first photo mug. I want
to see myself on the front page of a sports sec
tion. most likely just below a girls' high school
water polo recap. 1 want to receive poorly writ
ten e-mails disparaging my parentage because
of something I wrote about Duke.
1 want to catch a foul ball in a big league
ballpark, and then manage not to look like
every other douche who awkwardly high-fives
everyone around him. I will sit back down and
take a big swill of my $7 beer, and 1 will grit my
teeth and pretend that my hand is not broken.
I want Stanford to win the College World
Series again. 1 want to see the 49ers make the
playoffs again. 1 want Stanford to beat Cal in
football again. I want to see the Giants win a
World Series with my dad.
I want to move back to California and get a
real job. 1 want to organize a corporate softball
program that holds practices on weekday after
noons. I want to beat the local church team 29-
0 and secretly feel good when they start arguing
with one another on the field. 4
1 want to own season tickets with any MLB
team (except the Yankees or Dodgers). 1 want
to go directly from work to catch a 7:05 start
just as the lights turn on and eat a healthy din
ner of four Polish sausages and a soggy paper
cupful of Dr. Pepper.
I want to own a Santurce Cangrejeros jer
sey. I want to buy a 52-inch plasma-screen TV
just so 1 can play RBI Baseball and Tecmo
Super Bowl on it in the middle of my otherwise
unfurnished living room. I want an ugly-ass
1984 brown-and-gold Padres hat and a mus
tard-yellow 1972 A's jersey. I couldn't care less
what kind of car I drive, so long as it has enough
room fora bat bag and a detergent bucket full
of baseballs.
I want to get married in a little church on the
beach, and then immediately strip off my tuxe
do and go surfing with my wife.
1 want to take my son or daughter to an af
ternoon A's game, sit in the upper deck and
slather up a hot dog with spicy mustard before
explaining all about hating the Yankees, why
soccer is for Communists and the superiority of
Gatorade Frost to Gatorade Fierce. I want to
teach my kid to read by dictating the 1993 Gi
ants' lineup (Wi11... C 1... Clark ... Rrrrob
by ... Th ... Thompson).
I want to coach a Little League team. I want
to restrain myself from bursting a blood vessel
when a squeeze is improperly executed. I want
to purchase valuc-paks of Shark Bites and
Capri Suns and hand out packs of Topps base
ball cards to Players of the Game. 1 want to eat
every flavor of Big League Chew.
1 want to laugh at people who don't like
sports.
