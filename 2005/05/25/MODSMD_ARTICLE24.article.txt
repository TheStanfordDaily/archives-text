## Corkery and Warburg seek Card's 15th doubles title at NCAA Individual Tournament 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Can they do it? Can senior Sam War
burg and junior KC Corkery defend their
NCAA doubles title? These have been the
questions on many people's minds as the
two head to College Station, Texas, to begin
the NCAA Individual Tournament today.
There's a chance that, between the two of
them, one will bring home a singles title, as
well.
Since the No. 22 Cardinal (14-11,4-3 Pa
cific-10 Conference) fell on May 15 to Pep
perdine in the second round of NCAA
Tournament play, the pair has had some
time to recover and prepare for the Indi
vidual Tournament. They've both had
more time off than their potential oppo
nents from Baylor and UCLA, who com
peted in the finals of the NCAA team tour
nament yesterday.
The doubles bracket consists of 32
teams, and Corkery and Warburg are the
second seed just behind No. 7 Georgia's
John Isner and Antonio Ruiz. Isner is half
of the doubles pair that Corkery and War
burg faced in the finals of last year's NCAA
Championship when they defeated the
Bulldogs in a three-set victory. Corkery and
Warburg are Stanford's 14th duo in history
to capture the NCAA doubles crown; the
14 doubles titles rank third behind South
ern California (20) and Harvard (17).
Behind Corkery and Warburg are Bay
lor's Benedikt Dorsch and Matija Zgaga,
to whom the Stanford tandem dealt a loss
at the end of March. While the All-Ameri
cans won their doubles match against the
Bears, Stanford still lost the doubles point
and all of the singles matches to complete
Baylor's clean 7-0 sweep of Stanford.
Other top-ranked pairs that the Ail-
American duo has faced this season in
clude Pepperdine's No. 7 Scott Doerner
and Pedro Rico. Doerner and Rico hand
ed Corkery and Warburg a 9-8 loss in
April, but the duo did not have the oppor
tunity to avenge their loss to the Waves, as
the doubles lineup was different when
Stanford faced Pepperdine in the NCAA
Tournament. California's No. 15 Patrick
Briaud and Conor Niland will also be
making an appearance in the Individual
Tournament. The Stanford pair has been
victorious in both dual matches this sea
son against them, earning 8-4 and 8-6
wins.
The singles draw is twice as large as the
doubles draw and includes 64 players. Four
singles players are automatically entered
from each region into the singles draw, and
at-large berths are also granted.
Warburg is the second seed behind
Dorsch, and Corkery is seeded in the 9-16
grouping. The NCAA Singles Tournament
in 2(K)4 proved to be a memorable one as
five of the top eight seeds made first-round
exits. Contributing to the unexpectedness

was Corkery who dealt Kentucky's Jesse
Witten, the sixth seed, a straight set defeat.
However, in the quarterfinals, both War
burg and Corkery made exits in straight
sets.
The Pacific-10 Conference is doing its
part to represent the West, as six of the
schools in the Pac-lOare represented in the
singles draw. Also looking to make a dent
in the singles bracket are players from Bay

lor, the defending NCAA Champions. In
addition to top seed Dorsch, defending
NCAA singles champion Benjamin Beck
er and Lars Poerschke will be competing
for the Bears.
Stanford head coach John Whitlinger
said he is aware of the tough competition

that lies ahead but is optimistic.
"I'm really looking forward to
NCAAs." Whitlinger said. "I would like to
have Sam and KC get to the finals [of sin
gles] and have the best man win at that
time and then [have them] win the doubles.
That's my dream."
