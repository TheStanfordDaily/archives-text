Two of the three, sophomores Theresa Logar and

will face former Stanford teammate No. 14 Story
Tweedie-Yates in the Round of 16.
"My goal this year was to make All-American and
1 knew it would be tough when I saw Suzi Babos in my
draw in the second round," Logar said in a press re

style to give her problems. 1 was able to take a lot off
the ball and force her into mistakes and to just play
scrappy tennis."
Babos said the conditions in Athens favored her
opponent.
"I played awful and she played better," Babos said
in a press release. "Basically, I beat myself. I couldn't
do the things 1 wanted to do because the ball was ba
sically floating around. The wind was definitely with
her."
Tweedie-Yates, who transferred toTexas Christian
University after the 2(X)3-2(H)4 season, defeated
Logar at the ITA / Riviera All-American Main Draw
in October, 6-3,6-2.
