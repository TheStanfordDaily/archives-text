## Stress damages physical health 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"We're all running around without a clue as to
what we're running around for," said Fred Luskin,
director of the Stanford Forgiveness Project and lec
turer at the School of Education, at a workshop held
yesterday afternoon.
Luskin, who focused on reducing day-to-day stress,
said the most basic way to relieve stress is to "com
plain less and appreciate more."
While many stress gurus advocate deep breathing,
yoga or meditation. Luskin said that these techniques
only help alleviate physical stress and miss deeper
issues that can lead to anxiety.
In order to delve into these deeper issues, individ
uals must ask themselves if they are living for any spe
cific purpose, Luskin said.
"Do you keep to that purpose so that when there
are natural setbacks you have some goal in mind?" he
asked the audience.
Second, Luskin said, "We com
plain too much about everything. If
we could just shut up, our stress
would plummet."
He added that people often feel
that they must choose between
building wealth and achieving hap
piness, a dilemma that can cause
confusion and strain.
"We are condemned by an
obsessed consumer culture to
believe that our well-being depends
on gaining or accumulating more,"
Luskin said.
But after our material needs our
satisfied, he said, the things that ulti
mately make us happy are friends
and family, meaningful work and a
purpose greater than ourselves.
"If you remember the service
you do in your daily life, then you
have a different take on it, instead
of always just trying to make it easy
on yourself," he added, referencing
the Thomas Jefferson quote, "If
there is real justice in the world, we
will suffer the most."
Americans have much to be
thankful for but do not act like it,
Luskin said.
He joked briefly about wealthy
people who host his talks at enor
mous beach homes and throw lavish
banquets. At one such event, Luskin
said he overheard several attendees
gathered around the food complain
ing about everything that went
wrong during their summer vaca
tions.

"We live in such a perverted area
that every other person you know is
re-modeling their kitchen for
$50,(XX) dollars," he said.
Luskin said he first began work
ing on issues related to stress at the
School of Medicine, where he was
researching ways to decrease risks
of heart disease, which has always
been linked to high stress levels.
When an individual experiences
stress, his or her body produces
higher levels of the hormone Corti
sol, which in turn leads to arterial
blockage and higher rates of heart
disease, Luskin explains on his Web
site.
While Luskin told patients that
their heart ailments could be attrib
uted to stress, many said they didn't
have time to address the problem.
"We are addicted to what we do
out of habit," Luskin said. "We do
not want to make changes, even if
our habits are killing us."
Luskin and his colleagues pro
vided one week of "forgiveness
training" — a workshop that
taught students how to manage
their emotions like anger and be
more forgiving —to 17 Catholic
and Protestant men and women
from Northern Ireland who had
immediate family members mur
dered as a result of sectarian vio
lence. After the seminar, attendees
reported a 20 percent reduction in
symptoms of depression and a 35
percent decline in symptoms relat
ed to stress, such as dizziness and
headaches.
In addition to his work at the
Forgiveness Project, he currently
works as a senior fellow at the
Stanford Center on Conflict and
Negotiation.
