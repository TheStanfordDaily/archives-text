# 'Human flesh alternative' sells on the Web
## New company sells flesh-flavored tofu 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Who knew there was a market for
food that tastes like human flesh?
Apparently, Mark Nuckols â€” founder
of Hufu, a company that sells tofu that
is textured and flavored like human
flesh.

A student at Dartmouth's Tuck
Business School, Nuckols said that the
idea for Hufu, dubbed "the healthy
human flesh alternative." sprang from
his interest in anthropology and canni
balism in particular.
"It just happens that I've always had
an interest in cultural anthropology,
especially studies of incidents of canni
balism," he said. "The practice has
struck me as vivid and freighted with
meaning. The theme runs deeper than
one might think."
He recently launched the Web site

Eathufu.com, where visitors can order
the product and Hufu merchandise and
find Hufu recipes. They can also read
short histories of famous cannibals.
Nuckol's staff calls the tone of the
Web site "mock-serious" and said that
he hoped that the food would appeal to
both cannibals who. are tired of the
logistical and legal obstacles to the
practice, as well as people who are sim
ply curious.
"We think [the theme of cannibal
ism] is practically iconic," Nuckols said,
it's a powerful theme, one of Freud's

three foundational taboos of Western
civilization."
Nuckols said he plans to turn the
taboo into a marketing tool. His com
pany's focus on cannibalism has
already generated considerable buzz at
Dartmouth, where Hufu has appeared
three times in the campus newspaper.
"On one level one of our objectives
for the Web site is cultural jujitsu he
said. "It's designed to provoke people
and get a reaction from them."
