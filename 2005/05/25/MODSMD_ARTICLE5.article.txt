# 'Human flesh alternative' sells on the Web
## New company sells flesh-flavored tofu 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Who knew there was a market for
food that tastes like human flesh?
Apparently, Mark Nuckols â€” founder
of Hufu, a company that sells tofu that
is textured and flavored like human
flesh.

A student at Dartmouth's Tuck
Business School, Nuckols said that the
idea for Hufu, dubbed "the healthy
human flesh alternative." sprang from
his interest in anthropology and canni
balism in particular.
"It just happens that I've always had
an interest in cultural anthropology,
especially studies of incidents of canni
balism," he said. "The practice has
struck me as vivid and freighted with
meaning. The theme runs deeper than
one might think."
He recently launched the Web site

Eathufu.com, where visitors can order
the product and Hufu merchandise and
find Hufu recipes. They can also read
short histories of famous cannibals.
Nuckol's staff calls the tone of the
Web site "mock-serious" and said that
he hoped that the food would appeal to
both cannibals who. are tired of the
logistical and legal obstacles to the
practice, as well as people who are sim
ply curious.
"We think [the theme of cannibal
ism] is practically iconic," Nuckols said,
it's a powerful theme, one of Freud's

three foundational taboos of Western
civilization."
Nuckols said he plans to turn the
taboo into a marketing tool. His com
pany's focus on cannibalism has
already generated considerable buzz at
Dartmouth, where Hufu has appeared
three times in the campus newspaper.
"On one level one of our objectives
for the Web site is cultural jujitsu he
said. "It's designed to provoke people
and get a reaction from them."
Nuckols admitted that some
people might find his theme offen
sive. However, he said that he was
willing to risk upsetting some peo
ple to expand awareness of his com
pany and "make Hufu a household
word."
"If the cost of engaging six or
seven people is to offend two or
three, then I think that is a fair
tradeoff," he said.
Hufu is manufactured by a
Dutch tofu processor, and for this
reason the product should appeal to
those who already enjoy cooking
with tofu, Nuckols said.
"The first people to pick up my

product have been the tofu enthusi
asts," he said.
Nuckols said his market has been
largely vegetarian, but believes that
others would enjoy Hufu as well. So
far Nuckols has not asked any gen
uine cannibals to test his product.
"I bet you a real Fijian head
hunter would enjoy Hufu," he said.
"In our taste tests here, people real
ly loved it."
Developing Hufu was a chal
lenge for Nuckols, who said he has
never tasted human flesh himself.
Instead, the flavor is based largely
on accounts of cannibalism from
anthropology books. Even so, he
said that he would be willing to try
it if presented with the opportunity.
"Were I invited to a cannibal
feast I would certainly take the
opportunity to sample the main
course," he said.
