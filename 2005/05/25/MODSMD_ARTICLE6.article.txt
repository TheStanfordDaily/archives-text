"When is a person dead?" Duke
Religion Prof. Ebrahim Moosa
asked the audience at his talk yes
terday on globalization and modern
Muslim ethics.
Muslim scholars confront chal
lenging questions about the role of
technology in life or death situa
tions, Moosa said. These issues
include organ transplantations and
life support, which have both
sparked debate in the Middle East.
"Biotechnology subverts our
intelligent notions of life and deaths
because of the availability of
machines to keep the body nour
ished intravenously and provide it
with some of the external signs of
life," Moosa said.
But this issue transcends science
in many ways, creating paradoxes in

the Muslim conceptions of life. In
particular, it raises questions
regarding the difference between a
human being and a corpse, Moosa
said.
"We can point to a human body
that shows some of the external
signs of life, especially breathing,
and yet we are unsure if this is a liv
ing body," he added. "We might be
able to say that a brain-dead body
on a respirator is a primitive ver
sion of a cyborg. This forces us to
ask the question â€” what is a per
son?' "
Moosa contrasted how scholars
in Egypt and scholars in India view
organ transplantation and the dif
ferences in their rationale on the
allowance of the procedure.
Those in Egypt work on the
principle that the preservation of
life takes precedence over other
