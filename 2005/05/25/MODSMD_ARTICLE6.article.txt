# Duke prof. explores Muslim bioethics

### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
"When is a person dead?" Duke
Religion Prof. Ebrahim Moosa
asked the audience at his talk yes
terday on globalization and modern
Muslim ethics.
Muslim scholars confront chal
lenging questions about the role of
technology in life or death situa
tions, Moosa said. These issues
include organ transplantations and
life support, which have both
sparked debate in the Middle East.
"Biotechnology subverts our
intelligent notions of life and deaths
because of the availability of
machines to keep the body nour
ished intravenously and provide it
with some of the external signs of
life," Moosa said.
But this issue transcends science
in many ways, creating paradoxes in

the Muslim conceptions of life. In
particular, it raises questions
regarding the difference between a
human being and a corpse, Moosa
said.
"We can point to a human body
that shows some of the external
signs of life, especially breathing,
and yet we are unsure if this is a liv
ing body," he added. "We might be
able to say that a brain-dead body
on a respirator is a primitive ver
sion of a cyborg. This forces us to
ask the question — what is a per
son?' "
Moosa contrasted how scholars
in Egypt and scholars in India view
organ transplantation and the dif
ferences in their rationale on the
allowance of the procedure.
Those in Egypt work on the
principle that the preservation of
life takes precedence over other

Dr. Fred Luskin expresses the need to de stress during his talk "Stress Free for Good "
taboos, and that since there is no binding prece
dence on the permissibility of organ transplanta
tion, it should be allowed.
"What is the relationship between science and
the humanities?" Moosa asked. "Some believe
there is a seamless continuity between factual sci
ence and ethics. God's works, namely science and
nature, and God's word are the same."
But even academics at high-profile Indian uni
versities oppose organ transplantation on the
grounds that the human body and its dignity are
absolute, and that necessity is not a valid reason to
violate anything that is absolute.
"In their world they see that science is different
from God's words, revelation and the law," Moosa
said. "They are not easily translatable. For them, ethics
cannot be subject to the reductionism of science."
He broadened the scope of this argument,
asserting that religious beliefs not only influence
medicine, but also healthcare practices, arts and
warfare.
Moosa concluded his discussion with the follow
ing analogy.
"We all like to relish our mortality, for in the
symphony of life the instrument only in part deter
mines the character of the symphony," he said. "We
still need to consider the vital role of the com
posers, the musicians and the audience."
