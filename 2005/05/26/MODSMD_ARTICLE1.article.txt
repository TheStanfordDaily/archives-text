# Bridging undergrade grads
## GSC confirms nominations 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
Improving cooperation between Stanford's
graduate and undergraduate communities has
been emphasized by both ASSU Executives
Melanie Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo and
GSC Chair Jenny Allen and Deputy Chair Tom
Lee since they began their respective terms.
With this goal in mind, the GSC passed bills
last night approving new appointees to the ASSU
Constitutional Council, Board of Trustees
Committees and the ASSU Executive Cabinet.
"From the moment they [Kannokada and
Okonkwo] took office they've been very proac
tive in working with us," said Lee, a GSC repre
sentative from the School of Engineering. "We
think it's great and we really want to continue to
work with them more and more."
Law student John Elias was appointed to
manage student space and housing issues on the
ASSU Executive Cabinet.
"This is the first time in my memory that a
grad student has served on the Executive
Cabinet," Lee said. "Melanie and Aneto worked
very hard to ensure that graduate students were
included."
Okonkwo, a junior in computer science and
management science and engineering, told the
GSC members in attendance that next year's
cabinet will be different because it will reflect
cooperation with the GSC.
"We totally revamped the cabinet process," he
said. "We tried to model the cabinet after how
the GSC does advocacy."
The GSC approved the cabinet
appointees by consensus, and Lee
said he was pleased with the
results.
"I'm glad to see they focused on
advocacy," he added. "We're look
ing forward to working with them
to advance graduate student inter
ests."
The Council also approved the
Nominations Commission's
appointees to the Board of
Trustees Committees with a unani
mous 10-0-0 vote.
Comprised of five undergradu
ates and five graduate students, the
Nominations Commission generat
ed a surprisingly high amount of
graduate student interest, Lee said.
"The graduate student turnout
for the Board of Trustees was phe
nomenal this year and we're very
glad that all the grad student spots
on the board of trustees are filled,"
he said. "This year's nominees pre
dominately come from profession
al schools, so in future years we
hope to get more of a mix with the
professional and graduate
schools."
Finally, the GSC approved the
nomination of Bob Sensenbrenner,
a junior political science major, to
the ASSU Constitutional Council.
Former ASSU chair Chris Lin, a
senior, introduced Sensenbrenner
to the Council, and hailed his expe
rience with constitutional reform
and student groups.
"Bob has been very active in
ASSU constitutional things," Lin
said.
Sensenbrenner replaces Daily
staff member and current GSC Co
chair Jenny Allen, shifting the ratio
of graduate to undergraduate stu
dents on the Constitutional
Council to three to two in favor of
the undergrads.
Regardless, Lee supported
Sensenbrenner's nomination.
"I'm really glad we were able to
get that seat filled quickly," he said.
"While we don't use the
Constitutional Council often it can
really mess things up if something
comes up and the council isn't
available. Bob is an incredible can
didate and we're glad to have
him."
