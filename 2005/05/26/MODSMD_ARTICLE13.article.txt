### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN STAR REPORTER 
The tables turned on what was supposed to
be a landslide editor-in-chief election when Jules
R. Penguin was caught necking with a prostitute
in Daily Business Manager Eric Eldon's office.
Camille J. Ricketts, previously not considered a
viable contender, came through in the final
hours last night as a result of the scandal.
Managing Editor of Sports Scott S. Allen,
who allegedly is having an affair with Ricketts,
sent the prostitute to swing the election. In his
platform, Penguin expressed plans to do away
with Allen's beloved Cardinal Today editions.
"I always knew that Jules was a sucker for
two dollar penguin hookers," Allen said.
Editor in Chief Cynthia H. Cho said that she
was disappointed with the outcome and, fora
brief moment, re-considered her decision to
leave the Bay Area after graduation in fear of
what would happen to The Daily with Ricketts
in charge.
"I've been training Jules all volume long. He
hasn't even had time to shower because he's
been working so hard," Cho said.
News Editor Temp. Morgan L. Springer
voted for Ricketts because he has faith in her
credentials rather than disbelief over the actions
of her competition.
"After her first two mental breakdowns I
wasn't sure, but after the third I knew that she
was editor-in-chief material," Springer said.
News Editor Megan E. Watkins respects
Penguin's sexual liberation and debauchery, but
stands by her vote for Ricketts.
"Camille is the coolest. It would be a great
honor to be her protege. Really I just like having
an excuse to have her on my speed dial,"
Watkins said.
Penguin's actions do not constitute a viola
tion of Daily policy, but staffers were jealous
that they weren't the ones to think of hooking
up in Eldon's office.
After a few glasses of champagne at Ricketts'
victory celebration, Cho conceded that Ricketts
would, indeed, be a great leader.
"I just hope she'll continue to decorate the
office."
In the heat of the moment Senior Staff
Writer Sara Ines Calderon, who is always in the
heat of the moment, shouted. "That's why I
chose you!"
