# An ounce of prevention
## The
						brave new world of dentistry 
### 
When I had my lower wisdom teeth re
moved a couple of years ago, my oral surgeon
tried to keep me entertained during the proce
dure by asking me if I had ever gone camping.
In my altered state, I apparently found this ab
solutely hilarious because I grinned and gig
gled — after a dose of laughing gas, of course.
That's an impressive response considering the
doctor was, at that point, using all of his 200
pounds to pry broken shards of tooth from my
jaw.
But while the actual procedure was painless,
even enjoyable, the aftermath was anything but
pleasant. My face swelled up like a baboon's
bottom and my cheeks were bruised. I spit up
mouthful after mouthful of

blood for nearly a week be
fore I went back to the sur
geon to be informed that I
was developing "liver
clots." These look and feel
like small lumps of flesh,
and they bleed profusely at
the slightest touch.
Cementing his place as
the world's most happy
go-lucky oral surgeon, my

doctor declared that the liver clots simply
meant that I was young and healthy. Oh, so spit
ting up a pint of blood daily is healthy? How
very reassuring. Now shield yourself as I chew
with reckless abandon.
Adding to the pain, I was unable to eat solid
food. It is amazing that I survived. But some
how, by eating nothing but applesauce and soup
for two weeks, I did.
It's been a few years since the ordeal now,
and every time I go to my regular dentist, he re
minds me that I still need to get my upper wis
dom teeth removed. He's tried suggesting,
scolding, pleading and even showing affected
disappointment, but to no avail. I've long un
derstood that I need the procedure, but I've
filed it away into a folder labeled "Things I
Need To Do But Likely Never Will," alongside
"a work ethic" and "rock-hard abs."
Recently, however, the poke of my crooked
ly incoming wisdom teeth and common sense
(i.e. my parents) have driven me to bite the bul
let and concede to having my remaining wis
dom teeth removed. I called up the amiable re
ceptionist, who asked me when I'd like to have
my appointment. I suggested March 2015. She
suggested two weeks. I accepted.
With my surgical procedure impending, I de
cided to learn a little more about my options. In
doing so, I became keenly aware of a fast-grow
ing trend in the world of dentistry — sedation
dentistry. I began to pay closer attention to the
recent barrage of radio commercials advertis
ing sedation dentistry, which uses general anes
thesia for cleaning and other standard dental
procedures. The practices behind the ads claim
to specialize in anxious patients, especially
those who may not have received dental care
for many years on account of their fear.
"You just fall asleep, and when you wake up,
you're all done," is the testimonial given by a pa
tient in one ad.
When I had my first two wisdom teeth ex
tracted, I was given the option of local anesthe-
