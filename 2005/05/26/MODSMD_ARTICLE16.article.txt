# Jet-setting this summer? Think health first
## Learn about health risks and prevention before you take off 
### JESSICA YU STAFF WRITER 
Traveling overseas — whether
for leisure, research or business —
calls for numerous health precau
tions. Knowing the types of health
risks you'll be facing before you
hop on the plane, train or ship is
the first step in making sure your
travel experience is as seamless as
possible. There are a few other
steps to get set before you jet, so
plan ahead.
The first thing the Stanford's
Overseas Studies Program Web
site recommends is making an ap
pointment with the Travel Clinic at
Vaden Health Center. The Ttavel
Clinic, which is made available for
the use of all members of the Stan
ford community, offers immuniza
tions and vaccinations required
for extended overseas travel.
According to Nancy Masuna
ga, nurse coordinator at Vaden,
there are several different immu
nizations recommended before a
person travels overseas.
"Typical immunizations in
clude Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B
— particularly for health care
workers or travelers who will be in
contact with the local population,"
said Masunaga. "Routine immu
nizations such as tetanus / diph
theria and measles should be up to
date."
Less typical vaccines include
those for typhoid, polio, rabies,
Japanese encephalitis, yellow
fever, meningitis and influenza
vaccinations. Vaccination require
ments also vary from region to re
gion. For example, according to
the OSP Web site. Meningitis C is
more widespread in British uni
versities than in American univer
sities. It is therefore recommended
that students traveling to Oxford
get the meningococcal vaccine.
"Some countries require evi
dence of yellow fever vaccination
prior to entry," added Masunaga.
"And although there isn't a vac
cine, medication to help prevent
malaria is recommended for cer
tain regions of the world."
No other required vaccinations
exist for travel to Stanford's other
campuses, which include Aus
tralia, Beijing, Santiago, Kyoto,
Florence, Berlin, Moscow and
Paris.

Senior Laurel Anderson trav

eled to Australia fall quarter of her
junior year. She said that health
precautions were not an issue
prior to her departure.
"I don't remember having to
take a physical exam or getting
any special vaccinations," she said.
Students on campus do have
the freedom to participate in pro
grams offered by other universi-

ties, though, and many students go
to third-world and politically rav
aged countries for charity or mis
sionary work.
For students going to countries
that have higher risks of certain
diseases, the Centers for Disease
Control Web site provides de
tailed information on the health
risks in every country

(http://www.cdc.gov). The Web
site also provides information on
the recommended vaccinations
travelers should get before leaving
the country.
If illness does become an issue
overseas, though, you may still be
covered. Many health insurance
carriers cover emergencies
abroad, so it is best to carry an in

surance card at all times. Masuna
ga recommends that travelers val
idate overseas emergency cover
age with their health insurance
carriers before leaving fora trip.
Students heading overseas
through OSP are required to pres
ent proof that their health insur
ance is valid abroad (for those not
enrolled in Cardinal Care).
"Medical care can be substan
dard in many developing coun
tries," she said, "so adequate evac
uation coverage should be consid
ered."
For those planning to stay
abroad for an extended period of
time, typically two or more weeks,
it is advisable to register at the
local United States embassy or
consulate. If emergency medical
treatment is needed, these institu
tions can provide a list of local
physicians and medical centers.
More importantly, registering in
these areas will help facilitate
communication to and from home
in case of an emergency — an im
portant note for those traveling to
areas experiencing civil unrest or
prone to natural disasters.
It is also wise to fill prescrip
tions before you travel, given that
medication can be different or un
available in another country, ac
cording to WebMD.com, an online
health resource.
Yet vaccinations and political
tension are not the only safety is
sues to consider before taking off
There are plenty of ways the smart
traveler can avoid an unwelcome
ailment by exercising caution in
everyday living.
While overseas, students often
complain of colds, headaches and
sore throats. According to the OSP
Web site, health is primarily a mat
ter of adequate rest.
Written on the program's Web
site is the following disclaimer:
"Some students do not get enough
rest overseas because there is so
much to do and see, and as they get
run-down, their resistance is low
ered and they are more vulnerable
to stress."
Anderson recalls this notion of
running around in her trip to Aus
tralia. "TTiere wasn't much to
take care of [health-wise] before
my trip," she said, "but my biggest
worry out there was that I would
