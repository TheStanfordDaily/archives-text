# Van brings medical and counseling resources to homeless and uninsured teens
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
In the course of just one month, Seth Ammer
man can be found anywhere from the San Jose

Emergency Housing Consortium to the Boys
and Girls Club of the Tenderloin district in
San Francisco. He travels widely as part of

the Lucille Packard Children Hospital's
Adolescent Outreach Program. Dri
ving to shelters, agencies and continua
tion schools in the Teen Health Van
with three other staff members, Am
merman is able to provide homeless
and uninsured adolescents with free
medical evaluations, medications and
arrangements for future treatments.

"Mobile medical care really helps by
going to the kids where they are," Ammerman
said. "It really enables kids to get the health care
they need, and eliminates a lot of barriers."

Ammerman, an associate clinical professor in the Department
of Pediatrics and a staff member at the children's hospital, spear
headed the idea for the van after the hospital received a $S.(XK) do
nation from Blue Shield, a medical health insurance provider.
Ammerman was also aware that there was a strong local need
for adolescent health care.
"In 1995, the United Way in Santa Clara county did a commu
nity needs assessment and it showed that adolescents were the
most underserved population in terms of health care," he said. "I
was able to persuade the hospital to expand the mobile program
to include a teen component."
When the program began in 1996, the van made trips once a
week to Santa Clara County, targeting uninsured and homeless
youth.
"Before the program started, I did a lot of networking with
agencies to see who was already serving these groups and talked
with youths themselves," Ammerman said. "One of the things that
everyone mentioned was that it was important to offer compre
hensive services and as many services as we could at the same time,
so that the youth wouldn't have to go to many different places to
get the treatments they needed."
The van, which carries most of the commonly needed medica
tions on board,is staffed by a nurse, a social worker and a dietician,
in addition to Ammerman.
Ammerman said that the van deliberately staffs a female prac
titioner as well as a male, due to the fact that some youths have had
traumatic experiences with members of a particular sex. Offering

the choice of a male or female
physician, he added, is very important in
terms of building trust with the practition-

ers.
Ammerman also stressed the importance of

having a social worker because many of his patients struggle with
psychological issues. Additionally, having a nutritionist on board
has proved to be useful because the teen years are an important
period for growth and development and eating well is particularly
important at this time.
In the van, Ammerman says he treats "typical teen problems
like acne, headaches, menstrual cramps and birth control" in addi
tion to more serious issues such as "depression, anxiety and other
mental health disorders."
He added that the program offers a lot of health education, in
cluding prevention and risk-behavior reduction. The van's staff
also tries to help their patients by finding appropriate agencies,
schools or jobs for them.
The van, which Ammerman describes as "a mobile home with
clinical exam rooms," currently goes out two days a week to six dif
ferent sites a month, and now reaches San Mateo County and San
Francisco, in addition to Santa Clara County.
"Consistency is very important," Ammerman said. "We go to
the same sites on the same days of the week on a consistent sched
ule so that the kids know that we're going to be there, and the
agencies know that we're going to be there.
"Once a kid is in our program, they can come to any site and we
arrange for transportation," he added. '"Hie majority of the kids
we see do quite well and that's really what keeps us going."

One female teenager, Ammer
man cited as an example, came by to
check out the service and left with a
positive pregnancy test.
"She decided to continue the
pregnancy, got prenatal care and
stopped smoking," Ammcrman s;iid.
"Ihis was a very good outcome."
Ammerman also mentioned an
other female teen who was de
pressed and engaging in risky sexual
behavior. She was also suffering
from substance abuse, asthma,
headaches, menstrual cycle prob
lems and malnourishment.
"We were able.over time, to get to
know her and get her back in
school," Ammerman said. "She grad
uated,got a job and recently was em
ployee of the month. She stopped all
her substance abuse except tobacco,
and became much more responsible
about her sexual behavior."
For Ammerman. that case symbol
izes both the many challenges and re
wards that the program presents.
"Working with the kids is of
course challenging because, besides

all of the normal adolescent issues,
being homeless or being in poverty
adds on another whole set," he said.
Ammerman also acknowledged
the difficulty for homeless and unin
sured adolescents to overcome these
problems themselves.
"It takes time to get motivated to
change your behavior and it takes
time to do it,"he said. "We're very
patient, and we know that."
'Chough all patients come to the
van voluntarily, the program has at
tempted to attract more adolescents
by offering two free movie tickets for
first-time visitors who get compre
hensive evaluations. Ammerman
noted that this is usually substantial
motivation for kids who most likely
can't afford to go to the movies, and
that the offer usually ends up attract
ing a fair number of follow-up pa
tients.
"Once they go through the whole
[evaluation], they usually come
back, even if they did only come for
the movie tickets," he said.
The health van now has a follow
up rate of over 6K percent.
Ammerman hopes to expand the
number of days each week that the
van runs and perhaps someday, to
make it a full-time operation.
" The need is certainly there to be

full-time if we had the funding," he
said. "Unfortunately, the number of
uninsured and homeless is increas
ing, and the problem's not going
away.
"Funding is a big challenge be
cause all of our services, of course,
are free," he added. "We are almost
exclusively funded from grants from
foundations and philanthropic indi
viduals."
The van welcomes volunteers
through the Lucille Packard Chil
dren's Hospital volunteer program.
Though Ammerman said that stu
dents would not directly help with
the medical examinations, they
would form relationships with the
patients and help make a difference.
Currently, no Stanford students are
involved with the program.
"I feel very strongly that it's im
portant to serve and help kids in our
community who are underserved or
un-served," he said. "We are target
ing kids who wouldn't have health
care on a regular basis."
He added: "1 really feel strongly
that it's important not only to do all
the high-tech care that the hospital
does but that we also do the out
reach into the community |for
members] who are lacking even
basic services."
