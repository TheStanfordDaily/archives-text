# Van brings medical and counseling resources to homeless and uninsured teens
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
In the course of just one month, Seth Ammer
man can be found anywhere from the San Jose

Emergency Housing Consortium to the Boys
and Girls Club of the Tenderloin district in
San Francisco. He travels widely as part of

the Lucille Packard Children Hospital's
Adolescent Outreach Program. Dri
ving to shelters, agencies and continua
tion schools in the Teen Health Van
with three other staff members, Am
merman is able to provide homeless
and uninsured adolescents with free
medical evaluations, medications and
arrangements for future treatments.

"Mobile medical care really helps by
going to the kids where they are," Ammerman
said. "It really enables kids to get the health care
they need, and eliminates a lot of barriers."

Ammerman, an associate clinical professor in the Department
of Pediatrics and a staff member at the children's hospital, spear
headed the idea for the van after the hospital received a $S.(XK) do
nation from Blue Shield, a medical health insurance provider.
Ammerman was also aware that there was a strong local need
for adolescent health care.
"In 1995, the United Way in Santa Clara county did a commu
nity needs assessment and it showed that adolescents were the
most underserved population in terms of health care," he said. "I
was able to persuade the hospital to expand the mobile program
to include a teen component."
When the program began in 1996, the van made trips once a
week to Santa Clara County, targeting uninsured and homeless
youth.
"Before the program started, I did a lot of networking with
agencies to see who was already serving these groups and talked
with youths themselves," Ammerman said. "One of the things that
everyone mentioned was that it was important to offer compre
hensive services and as many services as we could at the same time,
so that the youth wouldn't have to go to many different places to
get the treatments they needed."
The van, which carries most of the commonly needed medica
tions on board,is staffed by a nurse, a social worker and a dietician,
in addition to Ammerman.
Ammerman said that the van deliberately staffs a female prac
titioner as well as a male, due to the fact that some youths have had
traumatic experiences with members of a particular sex. Offering

the choice of a male or female
physician, he added, is very important in
terms of building trust with the practition-

ers.
Ammerman also stressed the importance of

having a social worker because many of his patients struggle with
psychological issues. Additionally, having a nutritionist on board
has proved to be useful because the teen years are an important
period for growth and development and eating well is particularly
important at this time.
In the van, Ammerman says he treats "typical teen problems
like acne, headaches, menstrual cramps and birth control" in addi
tion to more serious issues such as "depression, anxiety and other
mental health disorders."
He added that the program offers a lot of health education, in
cluding prevention and risk-behavior reduction. The van's staff
also tries to help their patients by finding appropriate agencies,
schools or jobs for them.
The van, which Ammerman describes as "a mobile home with
clinical exam rooms," currently goes out two days a week to six dif
ferent sites a month, and now reaches San Mateo County and San
Francisco, in addition to Santa Clara County.
"Consistency is very important," Ammerman said. "We go to
the same sites on the same days of the week on a consistent sched
ule so that the kids know that we're going to be there, and the
agencies know that we're going to be there.
"Once a kid is in our program, they can come to any site and we
arrange for transportation," he added. '"Hie majority of the kids
we see do quite well and that's really what keeps us going."
