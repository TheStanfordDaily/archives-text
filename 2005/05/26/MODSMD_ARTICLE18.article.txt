# Oil may soon be too expensive to use before sources dry up
## Studies emphasize limited nature of oil supplies 
### DANIEL McMENAMIN THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. — Addictions can
be hard to break. The United States' addic
tion to fossil fuels has enabled it to reach
heights never seen by any civilization in his
tory.
However, many people who have studied
the theory of peak oil — also known as
Hubbert's Peak, and is the idea that the
world's oil production will soon peak and
then start to decline — believe that this
addiction is not sustainable in the long term.
They argue that in the near future, fossil
fuels could be too expensive to use and
eventually lost forever.
Most people found this idea hard to
believe when it was proposed by a Shell Oil
geologist over five decades ago. But today's
rising gas prices and sinking U.S. economy
are making more and more people take
heed of the theory, including politicians and
CEOs of oil companies.
Along with the fact that several oil com
panies have merged in the past decade, exec
utives of these companies are now beginning
to acknowledge an oncoming crisis.
David J. O'Reilly, the chairman and CEO
of Chevron Corporation told a Houston
energy conference in February that "the
time when we could count on cheap oil and
even cheaper natural gas is clearly ending."
The government is also becoming aware
of this issue. In March, the U.S. House of
Representatives listened to a presentation
from U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.),
who spoke about the issue of peak oil, its

long-term effects on American life, and pos
sible alternative energy sources.
So where did this idea come from, and
why has it taken so long for people to start
addressing it?
In 1949, a scientist named Marion King
Hubbert publicly predicted that the fossil
fuel era would be relatively short - that the
production of oil within the United States
would peak in 1970.
This theory was rejected by the majority
of his colleagues and largely ignored by the
public at the time. However, global oil dis
covery peaked in 1962, and surely enough
U.S. production of oil began to decline in
the early '70s, proving that Hubbert was
indeed correct.
What will happen when oil production
peaks is usually depicted by a bell curve.
After production goes past the peak of
the bell curve, supply can no longer meet
demand. As the supply of oil dwindles, it
becomes more rare and expensive, and this
results in sharp rises in prices, which contin
ue to increase until the supply is all used up.
When the peak will occur is not quite
clear at this point, and this is something
many people studying the issue disagree on.
"If we want to be pessimistic and make
assumptions that no new discoveries are
made, then the peak could be years from
now," said Hossein Farzai, a UCD professor
who studies the economics of natural
resources. "But if we're optimistic and
depend on technological advancements in
the future, then investment in discoveries
could delay the peak until decades from
now."

While people in the field of economics
may be more likely to be more optimistic
about technology coming to our rescue,
geologists like Eldridge Moores tend to
emphasize the finite nature of fossil fuels.
"This is a topic that the general public is
not aware of," said Moores. a professor
emeritus in geology at UCD. "Economists
tend to argue that we'll always find more
[oil], but some day you're going to reach the
end of that."
Some of the most pessimistic analysts
studying the issue predict that, based on
current rates of consumption, the peak will
come in the near future. For example, the
Association for the Study of Peak Oil and
Gas estimates that it will occur in 2008.
The government has even made its own
prediction. The U.S. Geological Survey,
which published a report in 2000 on the
future of oil, predicted the peak to be
reached at least a few decades down the
road.
However, in a 1968 report the USGS pre
dicted U.S. domestic production would grow
long into the future. But within a decade,
the study was completely discredited as
Hubbert's prediction hit its mark.
No one knows for sure though about
when the peak will hit, since it depends
largely on oil-rich countries like Saudi
Arabia, which is part of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. These
countries keep much of the information
about their crude oil reserves secret, so it is
hard fora consensus to be reached on when
the event will occur.
Regardless of the exact date, it is clear

that peak oil is not a matter of if it will
occur; it is a matter of when, and signs are
starting to show. According to the U.S.
Department of Energy, the cost of a barrel
of crude oil is currently just under $47. This
is over 60 percent higher than the $29 price
of May 2003, and almost triple the $17 price
of May 1999.
The mainstream media, though, have
been negligent in covering the impending
oil crisis, and have only really started to talk
about the issue of peak oil as the prices have
increased, according to John Theobald, a
UCD communications professor.
"Fear doesn't play well in the long term.
Often (the media] will talk about things like
crime where there'll be a remedy at the
end," he said. "That doesn't appear to be the
case here."
ITieobald teaches a class on underreport
ed issues in the media, and has studied peak
oil in depth. He is the thesis adviser for Liz
Warren, who is writing her senior thesis on
underreported issues and offered more rea
sons for why the media are only now waking
up to the peak oil problem.
"There's a tendency [in the media] to
focus on events, like tsunamis, rather than
incrementally growing problems," Warren
said. "It's also hard to get the general pub
lic's attention about it... because it's not fun
to hear about. But people will start to feel
cheated when they can't have their way of
life, and I think that's the scariest thing
about peak oil."
Even people like Kurt Vonnegut, one of
the most famous authors living today, are
addressing the peak oil issue.
