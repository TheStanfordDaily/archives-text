## Editorial Morality and mortality in stem cell research 
### 
Fiarly last week, South Korean re
searchers created the world's first embryon
ic stem cells using cloned human embryos
that were genetic copies of sick patients —
a major step in the quest to harvest patients'
own genetically matched tissues to treat dis
eases. In the aftermath of this discovery, the
U.S. House of Representatives ignored
President George W Bush's four-year old
ban on federal funding for stem cell re
search by passing the Castle-DeGette bill.
This bill allows couples who have donated
embryos to fertility clinics to decide if they
want the embryos used for scientific re
search or to be discarded. While the presi
dent is expected to veto this bill, the House
also passed the Republican-supported
House Res< >luti< >n 5% encouraging alterna
tive research usingstem cells from umbilical
chord blood, which the president supports
Despite support for stem cells research.
Hush clings to his belief that the research de
stroys emerging life because embryos are
destroyed in the process. Is Bush's stance
preventing the possibilities of science and
disease curing? We think so.
By limiting federal funding for stem cell
research, the U.S.government is preventing
researchers from making the kinds of ad
vances that South Korea and Britain are
making. Researchers are becoming more
efficient with testing and making significant
strides toward finding cures for Parkinson's
disease, juvenile diabetes and Alzheimer's
disease. For America to stand back and pre
vent sound scientific research from pro
ceeding is unconscionable.
While 60 percent of Americans support
stem cell research, approximately HI per
cent are against human cloning according
to Gallup polls — the American people
can distinguish between stem cell research
and cloning, so why can't our president?
ITiis research could lead tocures for serious
diseases, and the Castle-DeGette promotes

that possibility. Stem cell research is not re
productive cloning, nor does not it neces
sarily promote reproductive cloning. In
stead, it may save millions of lives, and
make life easier for millions more.
Threatening his first veto in this admin
istration, Bush has been making emotional
appeals via the media to drive home his
stance. Meanwhile, Democrats and moder
ate Republicans are fighting back using
emotional appeals with victims of diseases
that can be cured usingstem cells. Although
both bills passed in the House, they fell
short of the two-thirds needed to block a
veto. This vote shows, however, the kind of
political backlash that Bush may face
should he uphold his previous ban on fed
eral funding.
If lives can be saved through stem cell
research, the possibilities and alternative
sources for stem cells, like umbilical chord
blood,should be explored fervently. It is es
timated that there are more than 4(K),(XX)
embryos in fertility clinics nationwide,
many of which will spoil and be discarded if
they go unused.
It should be a woman's choice how she
wants her unwanted embryos to be used. If
she wants those embryos to be harvested
for stem cells that could save her father's
degenerating memory from Alzheimer's,
that should be her choice. The Castle-
DeGette bill would give Americans this
choice.
Despite Bush's stance, stem cell re
search is being conducted worldwide with
increasing progress. The United States
should want to be a part of scientific histo
ry and, more importantly, the United States
should want to improve the lives of its citi
zens Bush's supporters claim that he is tak
ing a strong moral stance. But to ignore the
potential benefit and the will of so many
American citizens is, in fact, both short
sighted and deeply immoral.
