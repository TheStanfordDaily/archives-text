# Class promotes community involvement
## Students help build Guatemalan shelter 
### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford students is
working to create a center for homeless
women and children in Guatemala. The
facility, which will house and provide
counseling, medical, educational and
communal dining services, is part of a
larger crisis relief project connected
with a civil and environmental engi
neering course on campus.
Architect Margaret Jann leads the

eight-member class, "Architecture Studio
Practicum on Sustainable Development,
Equity, Ethics and Community Service."
Although offered by the Civil and
Environmental Engineering Department,
the class includes students with back
grounds in urban design and product
design.
For the past two years, the class has
been working to complete the
Guatemala project, which will provide


JEREMY GORDON/The Stanford Daily
two houses for orphaned children
who will live with surrogate moth
ers.
The idea for the Guatemala proj
ect started when Luis Trujillo, Class
of 2003, went to Guatemala to work
with the Center for the Restoration
of the Multitudes. The organization
expressed the need fora community
center, and last year's class adopted
the project after visiting the country.
Ayaz, who is currently enrolled

in the class, said the goal is "not only
to design an inexpensive and effi
cient shelter for the impoverished,
but to increase the comfort and
quality of life for these victims
through distinctively good designs."
Because the class is based on
humanitarian goals, the students
spoke to the organization's leaders
to learn more about the communi
ty's wants and needs.
"We want the client to be happy,
rather than imposing architecture
on them," Ayaz said. "The rationale
behind our work is making some
thing that is realistic but not just
prefabricated housing. We want to
go beyond that."

Some students in the class are
also working to create an ocean
side church in France and housing
units for the regions affected by the
tsunamis in South Asia. Because it
is difficult to complete a project of
this scale in a 10-week quarter, the
work is usually carried over and
built on by the following year's
class. In fact, Jann said many of the
projects can take five to 10 years to
complete.
She also stressed that the class is
significant for students' develop
ment of architecture skill as well as
cultural awareness and sensitivity.
"I think this class is very impor
tant because the students are work

ing on live projects that they would
not typically get to work on for
years until they have been licensed
as architects," Jann said. "So by get
ting to work on real projects for real
clients they get hands-on experi
ence, the chance to work with clients
and exposure to other cultures and
countries with different design
methods and ethos."
Senior Michelle Chang, who has
taken the class for the last two years,
said she feels her experience has
been extremely rewarding.
"We are like a think tank; we
come up with solutions and ideas,"
Chang said. "This has been one of
my favorite classes at Stanford

because you get to interact with
clients and do something you know
will help someone."
On June 1, the students will pres
ent the final project to the public,
with special invites extended to pro
fessional architects and designers.
The presentations will be held from
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Encina Hall West
Room 106. The students hope that
the professionals will help them
advance the project.
"We are trying get feedback
about our ideas and concepts,"
sophomore Engin Ayaz said. "We
want to gather recognition on cam
pus and at the local level to help get
funding in the future."
