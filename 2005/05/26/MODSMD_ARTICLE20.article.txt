# Let it be
## You knew it was coming: No more civilization 
### 
IT necessity is the mother of invention,
then why do civilized cultures call their in
ventions great accomplishments? They
could also be seen as coping mechanisms —
ways that civilizations deal with the crises
their way of life engendered: overpopula
tion, starvation when crops failed, resource
depletion, infectious disease and war.
If civilized people were inventive, it was
because, in their dire crises, they had to be,
and if non-civilized people didn't use certain

civilized techniques or products, it might have been because
they were doing fine without them.
I first thought of this idea when I learned that agriculture
might have been more of a last resort than a brilliant discovery.
Anthropologist Mark Nathan Cohen wrote in the August/Sep
tember 2(M)4 Free Inquiry,"What was once considered the 'in
vention' of farming (occurring in various regions beginning 10
to 12 thousand years ago) is now more often interpreted as a
result of increased demand for resources.This increase results
from either denser human populations, social structures that
imposed demands for extra output or climate changes that
may have reduced the supply of preferred resources. This new
technology was presumably forced, not invented."
He continues, "First, most of the techniques that, in combi
nation. make up farming' ... were and are in fact used indi
vidually by various foraging cultures that did not practice agri
culture. Second, agriculture actually seems to have been hard
er work than hunting or even gathering small resources."
Indeed, as Richard Manning writes in "Against the Grain."
"Gamboling about plain and forest, hunting and living off the
land is fun. Farming is not... "The fundamental question was
properly phrased by Colin Ibdge of the London School of Eco
nomics: "The real problem, then, is not to explain why some
people were slow to adopt agriculture but why anybody took it
up at all. when it is so obviously beastly."
Most people I've talked with assume that life was hard and
grueling before agriculture, that people regularly went hungry
and that the lifespan was short because of under-nutrition. But
the case seems to be the opposite. In fact, the average life span
actually decreased upon the start of intensive agriculture, due
to poorer quality of nutrition and frequent crop failures.
Agriculture caused a number of new problems, including pop
ulation growth (because infants could be weaned earlier and
overall fertility was greater), which caused a positive feedback
cycle and the need for more intensive agriculture to feed more
mouths.
Another significant problem caused by agriculture and liv
ing in cities was increased infectious disease. Many diseases
date their first significant interaction with people to the era
when people began living in close proximity in cities, using ir
rigation, and keeping livestock. Mark Nathan Cohen writes,
"Almost all studies that attempt to reconstuct the histoiy of in
fectious diseases, indicate that the burden of infection has
tended to increase, rather than decrease, as human beings
adopted civilized life styles." Major dental disease also dates to
the beginning of agriculture, as I learned when I researched
skeletons at the National Museum of Natural History. The
teeth of pre-agriculture Native Americans were worn down by
their gritty diets but otherwise were healthy. In con trast," post
contact" Native Americans had horrible cavities, gaping ab
scesses, and widespread tooth loss, due to their starchy diets.

Medicine and dentistry are great aspects of civilization, but for
the most part, they deal with problems civilization caused in
the first place.
It's not too hard to apply this paradigm to most of our great
"inventions" and "accomplishments":
* Literature and art: I like both, and they're among the
greatest achievements of civilization, they also can be seen as
methods of coping with the loneliness anil anomie of civilized
life. It's nice that many people chose to salve their emotional
pain through art, but it would be nicer if they didn't have so
much emotional pain in the first place. Besides, many uncivi
lized groups had rich oral histories,stories and art forms (which
are noticeably more nature-centered and upbeat than most
modern literature and art).
* Science and technology: Despite (justified) claims about
"understanding the universe" and "discovering things no one
knows," a big motivation in these subjects is coping more effec
tively with the problems and challenges of civilization, like
shortages of food and natural resources. Besides, can we really
say that we understand the world better than non-civilized
people? We might have memorized Newton's Laws and the
Krebs Cycle from textbooks, but can we find wild plants that
are safe to eat, see the Milky Way with our bare eyes or identi
fy animal tracks? We might think non-civilized people were
uneducated, but one could easily make a case that they "under
stood the world" better than most of us at this elite university.
* Morals and ethics are great "achievements" of civilization,
but they're also inventions to get people to be nice to strangers.
In smaller, non-civilized communities, being nice to others is
natural, because there's an obvious potential for both retalia
tion and favors in return.
* Psychiatry and psychology could be seen as attempts to
help people deal with the mental stress of living in a social en
vironment they didn't evolve to live in.
* Biotechnology, energy technology, genetically-modified
plants and many recent inventions are attempts to deal with
shortages in food and natural resources.
* We're inventing new cancer treatments to deal with can
cers, many of which are caused by tobacco, alcohol and envi
ronmental pollution.
* Would we have gone to the moon without the Cold War?
Would people be so interested in space colonization (see
Rahul's column "The answers are in outer space," May 25) if
we weren't using up the resources on earth?
* Some of the greatest incentives for invention are warfare
and international conflict. Given no warfare and more inven
tions, I'd take no warfare.
I don't mean to degrade the wonderful aspects of civiliza
tion, and it's pointless to say 1(),(KK) years too late that civiliza
tion was a bad idea. But 1 do think we could be humble about
civilization, because while those of us reading this paper ar
guably have a richer life than most pre-civilized people, it's not
hard to argue that even with all of civilization's inventions, the
median pre-civilized person living in equilibrium with the en
vironment had a happier and more fulfilled life than the medi
an person today.

IT necessity is the mother of invention,
then why do civilized cultures call their in
ventions great accomplishments? They
could also be seen as coping mechanisms —
ways that civilizations deal with the crises
their way of life engendered: overpopula
tion, starvation when crops failed, resource
depletion, infectious disease and war.
If civilized people were inventive, it was
because, in their dire crises, they had to be,
and if non-civilized people didn't use certain

civilized techniques or products, it might have been because
they were doing fine without them.
I first thought of this idea when I learned that agriculture
might have been more of a last resort than a brilliant discovery.
Anthropologist Mark Nathan Cohen wrote in the August/Sep
tember 2(M)4 Free Inquiry,"What was once considered the 'in
vention' of farming (occurring in various regions beginning 10
to 12 thousand years ago) is now more often interpreted as a
result of increased demand for resources.This increase results
from either denser human populations, social structures that
imposed demands for extra output or climate changes that
may have reduced the supply of preferred resources. This new
technology was presumably forced, not invented."
He continues, "First, most of the techniques that, in combi
nation. make up farming' ... were and are in fact used indi
vidually by various foraging cultures that did not practice agri
culture. Second, agriculture actually seems to have been hard
er work than hunting or even gathering small resources."
Indeed, as Richard Manning writes in "Against the Grain."
"Gamboling about plain and forest, hunting and living off the
land is fun. Farming is not... "The fundamental question was
properly phrased by Colin Ibdge of the London School of Eco
nomics: "The real problem, then, is not to explain why some
people were slow to adopt agriculture but why anybody took it
up at all. when it is so obviously beastly."
Most people I've talked with assume that life was hard and
grueling before agriculture, that people regularly went hungry
and that the lifespan was short because of under-nutrition. But
the case seems to be the opposite. In fact, the average life span
actually decreased upon the start of intensive agriculture, due
to poorer quality of nutrition and frequent crop failures.
Agriculture caused a number of new problems, including pop
ulation growth (because infants could be weaned earlier and
overall fertility was greater), which caused a positive feedback
cycle and the need for more intensive agriculture to feed more
mouths.
Another significant problem caused by agriculture and liv
ing in cities was increased infectious disease. Many diseases
date their first significant interaction with people to the era
when people began living in close proximity in cities, using ir
rigation, and keeping livestock. Mark Nathan Cohen writes,
"Almost all studies that attempt to reconstuct the histoiy of in
fectious diseases, indicate that the burden of infection has
tended to increase, rather than decrease, as human beings
adopted civilized life styles." Major dental disease also dates to
the beginning of agriculture, as I learned when I researched
skeletons at the National Museum of Natural History. The
teeth of pre-agriculture Native Americans were worn down by
their gritty diets but otherwise were healthy. In con trast," post
contact" Native Americans had horrible cavities, gaping ab
scesses, and widespread tooth loss, due to their starchy diets.

Medicine and dentistry are great aspects of civilization, but for
the most part, they deal with problems civilization caused in
the first place.
It's not too hard to apply this paradigm to most of our great
"inventions" and "accomplishments":
* Literature and art: I like both, and they're among the
greatest achievements of civilization, they also can be seen as
methods of coping with the loneliness anil anomie of civilized
life. It's nice that many people chose to salve their emotional
pain through art, but it would be nicer if they didn't have so
much emotional pain in the first place. Besides, many uncivi
lized groups had rich oral histories,stories and art forms (which
are noticeably more nature-centered and upbeat than most
modern literature and art).
* Science and technology: Despite (justified) claims about
"understanding the universe" and "discovering things no one
knows," a big motivation in these subjects is coping more effec
tively with the problems and challenges of civilization, like
shortages of food and natural resources. Besides, can we really
say that we understand the world better than non-civilized
people? We might have memorized Newton's Laws and the
Krebs Cycle from textbooks, but can we find wild plants that
are safe to eat, see the Milky Way with our bare eyes or identi
fy animal tracks? We might think non-civilized people were
uneducated, but one could easily make a case that they "under
stood the world" better than most of us at this elite university.
* Morals and ethics are great "achievements" of civilization,
but they're also inventions to get people to be nice to strangers.
In smaller, non-civilized communities, being nice to others is
natural, because there's an obvious potential for both retalia
tion and favors in return.
* Psychiatry and psychology could be seen as attempts to
help people deal with the mental stress of living in a social en
vironment they didn't evolve to live in.
* Biotechnology, energy technology, genetically-modified
plants and many recent inventions are attempts to deal with
shortages in food and natural resources.
* We're inventing new cancer treatments to deal with can
cers, many of which are caused by tobacco, alcohol and envi
ronmental pollution.
* Would we have gone to the moon without the Cold War?
Would people be so interested in space colonization (see
Rahul's column "The answers are in outer space," May 25) if
we weren't using up the resources on earth?
* Some of the greatest incentives for invention are warfare
and international conflict. Given no warfare and more inven
tions, I'd take no warfare.
I don't mean to degrade the wonderful aspects of civiliza
tion, and it's pointless to say 1(),(KK) years too late that civiliza
tion was a bad idea. But 1 do think we could be humble about
civilization, because while those of us reading this paper ar
guably have a richer life than most pre-civilized people, it's not
hard to argue that even with all of civilization's inventions, the
median pre-civilized person living in equilibrium with the en
vironment had a happier and more fulfilled life than the medi
an person today.
