# Writing in the Margins
## Seth reaches the end of the book 
### 
Well, there should be a book re
view here, in this space. It would
have been an extraordinary event.
The first, and only, book review in a
column about books. It's a novel
idea, maybe even revolutionary.
But there will be no book review
today. 1 wrote one, and if you really
want to read it, you can send me an
e-mail and 1 would gladly send you
the review. But this column will not

be about Eric Jackon's "The Pay Pal Wars."
I cannot read. I sat down to read Jackson's book,
with my Pentel RSVP uncapped and moving be
tween my fingers, ready to strike at any moment. I
went line by line, moving my eyes through the intro
duction and past the acknowledgements, into the
book proper. By the time 1 made it to page one, I
had already made my mark on this poor tome. But
all my comments were annoying. Overly critical,
they read like notes that a snappy editor might lay
down on a lazy writer with a lot of potential. I'm not
an editor though. I'm just a reader.
Back in the day,probably before I enrolled in Eng
lish 94a and Stanford University, I could read. Read
ing "The Great Gatsby" at one in the morning on a
chilly patio in preparation fora quiz, I decided that I
did not like Fitzgerald's book, but I also did not linger
too long on what bothered me about it. Maybe it's be
cause my copy was one of those acid-worn school
books, shared by other people whose names and
teachers are listed neatly on the inside cover.
1 almost never used pen or pencil. I didn't mark. It
was a general rule. Back in the day, I would take my
special blue pen to my essays before they were due.
But by senior year, all my essays were in-class disas

ters, unedited rough drafts intended to prepare me
for the AP English Literature exam. They came back
with a score and that was the end of that. No ponder
ing. No fiddling. No editing. I sent my college essays
off, and judged their quality by the size of envelope
that returned.
Real readers write in their books. Seeing my hall
mates write in their books made me want to write in
my books. What do I write ? The quality of my margin
alia bothered me. Was it up to par? What should I be
looking for? Should I underline or star, and should I
ask questions or make statements? I never really
asked questions in high school. School was just
school. I liked English and I could get by, but I never
thought long and hard about what I read.
I yell at Plato and praise Virginia Woolf between
every line. My marginalia cries out for approval and
praise. I either write a lot in little letters, or very little
with big letters. My running commentary does not
help me understand the works, or much of anything,
but it makes me feel smart and accomplished. I'm
using my pen. I'm moving my pen. Is it moving
enough? Sitting in section, I stare at the pages where
I haven't written anything and wonder if someone
will think I haven't read. I have. But surely I'm not
smart enough to remember anything without lots of
notes.
I wonder what the smart people's books look like.
I've seen them, from time to time. I don't know what
they look like, though.There are lots of lines, and cir
cles, and question marks,and intellectual engagement
runs rampant.
"Wake Up," I wrote.
