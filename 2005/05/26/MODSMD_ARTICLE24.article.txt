Newsweek editorial 'takes the cake'
The Daily editorial board has had some doozies
in the past year or two, hut the editorial "Newsweek
mistake distracts from larger problem" (May 24) ab
solutely takes the cake.
To say that the larger lesson learned from the
Newsweek fiasco is that President George W. Bush
is to blame for the anti-American sentiment in that
"this isolated incident should not distract the pub
lic from the Bush administration's own contribu
tions to anti-American sentiment abroad" is ludi
crous. Absent the baseless Newsweek article, there
would not have been the riots that resulted in 15
deaths. Period.
The lesson to be learned from the Newsweek fi
asco is that the media needs to go back to the days
when editors with integrity refused to publish con
troversial stories unless facts were corroborated
from two sources. Ben Bradlee's treatment of
Woodward and Bernstein's coverage of Watergate
in the Washington Post is probably the most well

known example. That Pentagon officials refused to
object to the Newsweek report is a far cry from cor
roboration. I doubt Bradlee would have run the
story.
Moreover, this is not an isolated incident. It is
part of larger pattern of lower standards for publi
cation with regard to fact-finding and corrobora
tion. It is part of a larger pattern of a liberal media
industry that, by and large, cuts corners in its efforts
to impugn the Bush administration at every turn —
The Daily's editorial being no exception — while
being ever-increasingly reluctant to highlight its
successes.
If The Daily's editorial board is comprised of
people aspiring to be journalists and. eventually, ed
itors who will be called upon to make judgments on
whether to publish stories like this, then Tuesday's
editorial does not give me confidence that media in
tegrity will be restored any time soon.
