# NCAA enforces random drug tests
## 
### E. JORGENSEN THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. â€”
Ephedrine. Androstenedione.
Stanozolol. Marijuana. Cocaine.
All of these drugs are found on
the NCAA's list of banned sub
stances, but chances are most stu
dent-athletes at UC-Davis will never
be tested even once.
UC Davis athletes are subject to
random testing at least once a year
by the National Center for Drug Free
Sport, Inc., an independent contrac
tor that also handles testing for
minor league baseball.
Currently, 15 football players
are tested in addition to eight play
ers randomly selected from one
other UCD intercollegiate sport.
But because only one team other
than football is tested, the athletes
that comprise UCD's 24 other pro
grams have a slim chance of being
tested.
The different substances banned
by the NCAA are classified into two
main groups: Performance-enhanc
ing drugs and street drugs.
Performance-enhancing drugs
include illegal substances such as
anabolic steroids, human growth hor
mones and a host of stimulants and
diuretics. Street drugs include alco
hol, marijuana and heroin.
The first time a player tests posi
tive fora banned substance, he or she
loses a year of eligibility. If a second
positive test occurs, that player is per
manently kicked out of NCAA ath
letics
UCD women's track and field
coach Deanne Vochatzer has never
had a player test positive for banned
substances during her time at UCD.
She said it is her responsibility to

make sure her players know what is
acceptable to use and what isn't, but
she said she fears that student-ath
letes won't always know what they're
putting in their bodies.
"Supplements are my biggest
worry," Vochatzer said. "They are not
regulated by the Food and Drug
Administration, so God knows
what's in it."
Case in point: Andy McClure.
McClure, who graduated last year,
played on the football team during
his five years at UCD. At one point,
he was randomly selected to be drug
tested.
"I tested positive for nandrolone,
a metabolite that your body pro
duces at naturally occurring levels
lower than what I tested positive
for," McClure said. "All I was taking
was a protein powder, and there are a
lot more exotic things you can take,
like creatine, which I didn't even
take."
McClure's situation is exactly
what Vochatzer fears for her players.
"Who are they going to blame it
on?" Vochatzer said. "It's an embar
rassment to the team, the university
and the program."
Ryan Frank, a fifth-year track and
field athlete who participated in the
shot put, discus and hammer throw,
does not think steroid use should be
a concern at UCD
"It's not so much of a problem
here at Davis," Frank said, "but there
are always people you wonder about.
"I've seen people do it in pill form
[in high school]," Frank said. "The
people who were doing it were foot
ball players, wrestlers and two guys
on the baseball team. People are
smarter about it in college because of
the public repercussions High school
is a free-for-all."
