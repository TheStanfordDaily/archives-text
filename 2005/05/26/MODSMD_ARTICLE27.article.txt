Human papillomavirus, the number one STD
on campus and in the United States, is on the
rise at Vassar College. The Health Service's
records indicate that the percentage of abnor
mal Pap smears, most of which are indicative of
HPV, has increased since the 2001-2002 school
year.
According to an American College Health
Association pamphlet, "HPV has become an
epidemic among college-age individuals."

However, many students on campus do not
know about HPV and its prevalence,said intern
for the Women's Center Diana Schaffner '07.
"From my experience from talking to stu
dents on campus and even my friends at home,
it seems like many people our age are aware of
chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and AIDS, and
their symptoms and whether they're treatable,"
she said. "But it seems like quite a few people
are unsure of exactly what HPV is, what the
symptoms are, and how you would go about
treating it. Specifically, what I've found in stu
dents on campus is a lack of understanding the
long-term consequences of HPV."

HPV includes a family of over 100 viruses
that cause infections on the skin.
Approximately one-third of these viruses can
cause genital warts, which are single or multiple
humps that appear in the genital area, and are
sometimes cauliflower-shaped; these also cause
cell changes called intraepithelial legions in the
cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, and anus. In a small
percentage of cases, these cell changes, especial
ly those in the cervix, can be precancerous and
may lead to cancer in a few years if not detect
ed and treated. Most cervical cancer is caused
by HPV, but most people with HPV do not get
cervical cancer.
