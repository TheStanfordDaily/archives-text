## The
						Double Clutch I love the 80s, or at least, the NES

As summer rolls around, along with the
prospect of not bringing work home with me
for once, I've started looking for some low
rent entertainment to fill my time. 1 figured it was
time for some hardcore nostalgia, which is why I'm
busting out tny 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment Sys
tem.
Running on the same processor that powered the
Apple II and the Commodore 64, the NES really
packed a wallop, bringing the home gaming industry
back from the dead in the mid 80s and crushing its
only competitor, the Sega Master System.
And the Nintendo had some great sports games.
Major League Baseball from UN has possibly
the worst computet intelligence in the history of
naming. It did not take mv best friend and me lone to

learn that if you didn't pick up the
ball in the field, the computer
baserunners would keep running.
We threw no hitters by standing
the shortstop next to the ball until
the runner passed second base. If
the bases were loaded, the system
would slow down and flicker due
to all the moving pieces on the
screen.
It was impossible to steal or
bunt against the computer, but

that wasn't a problem because every third player
had enough power fora 60-homer season.
I"he venerable Tecmo Bowl, actually using real
players? names and skills, was a true classic of its era.
Two words: Chicago Bears. The Walter Payton
run off-tackle was guaranteed yardage — you could
drag players down the field by frantically pressing
the A and B buttons The passing game was a differ
ent story — unless the receiver was wide open, the
ball would be intercepted. It actually took quick
hand-eye coordination to get the ball downfield.
Touchdowns and other events were enhanced
with crappy sampled drums through the famously
underutilized delta-modulation channel, which was
also once used to play a clip of the Three Stooges
Hie unstoppable play, as noted by sports-cum
zeitgeist-cum-narcissism writer Bill Simmons, was
the bootleg pass to the tight end. (Note: this play is
also unstoppable in high school football if you have
a good running game and basically won Michigan
the national championship in 1997.)
Mike Tyson's Punch Out was a unique game in
many ways. It taught a whole generation of kids that
it doesn't matter who was the biggest or the strongest
that a midget Rocky Marciano-wannabe, Italian
turned-Scot named Little Mac could defeat Mike
Tyson simply by paying attention to his blinking pat
terns. And he could dodge the dynamite punch by
waiting for Iron Mike's body to flash.
The game took advantage of one-of-a-kind car
tridge technology to render detailed facial expres
sions. It didn't seem to bother Nintendo or the game
playing public that the programmers had used this
power to render a series of racist caricatures, includ
ing a blinking Japanese, a weak Frenchman, a flam
boyant Spaniard, a drunk Russian, an Indian mystic
and what appeared to be an overweight albino
