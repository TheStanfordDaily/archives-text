# NBA age limit could hurt Card
## 
### 
Amidst the excitcment of the NBA playoffs lies
a development critical to the future success of
the league.
A new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
is being negotiated between the league and the play
ers union. While whispers of a lockout will dominate
any discussion of the CBA, there is one issue that is far
more important to the dedicated fans of Stanford bas
ketball — an age limit.
NBA commissioner David Stern is pushing an
agreement with the union that would prohibit ath
letes under the age of 20 from declaring for the NBA
draft. Due to its controversial nature, the age limit is
considered unlikely to pass in the new CBA.
It has been decried as being racially motivated and
anti-American. Even Dick Vitale,the cheerleader of

college basketball and Duke Uni
versity, has publicly opposed it.
However, let's assume Stern gets
his way, as he usually does, and a
limit does go into effect.
NBA officials envision a sce
nario where high school players
can either enter college or the
NBAs developmental league, the
NBDLThe future of the NBDL,
however, does not Itxik promising.

especially given the NBAs historical inability to cre
ate a successful minor league system. Thus, it seems
likely that most players who would ordinarily enter
the draft will stay in college under an age limit.This is
bad news for Cardinal fans.
Almost every other elite team in college basket
ball has suffered from losing players to the NBA. Just
imagine what some teams would look like had they
not faced early departures. You have to think Duke,
which garnered a No. 1 seed in the tournament last
year, would have gotten past the Sweet 16 if it had not
lost elite point guard recruit Shuan Livingston and
emerging star Luol Deng to the NBA.
However, let's bring the discussion closer to the
Pacific-10 Conference. Arizona would have been in
the Final Four if highly touted power forward Ndudi
Ebi was roaming the boards for the Wildcats instead
of the bench for the Minnesota Timberwolves. USC
lost highly ranked center Robert Swift to the draft last
year. Washington is set to lose highly touted recruit
Martell Webster to the NBA this season.
The programs capable of attracting players that
would ordinarily head to the NBA out of high school


Roghav THapar
— Arizona, UCLA, Washington and
USC — should benefit most from an
age limit. Not only will an age limit
help them retain their current players,
it will increase the number of players
they can recruit as well.
Arizona is already one of college
basketball's premier programs and
should only improve if protected from
early departures. The rising programs
at UCLA and Washington are headed
by two excellent recruiters, Lorenzo
Romar and Ben Howland, respective
ly. With an age limit they would have
more available talent to bolster their
teams.
Even without a stable program,
USC has been able to attract top tal
ent on the basis of its location, rising
academic profile, sports culture and
beautiful women. Enter Tim Floyd, an
excellent coach as long as you keep
him miles away from an NBA arena.
Oregon and Cal, if they ever be
come steady programs again, could
also reap the benefits of an age limit.
However, Ernie Kent and Ben Braun
have had flashes of success but proba
bly not enough to win recruits over
programs like Duke, Kansas, Ken
tucky and North Carolina.
On the other hand, an age limit
would do little to curb the flow of early
defections Stanford has faced in the
past few years. All of Stanford's early
entrants into the draft declared after
their junior year, and would have been
eligible even under an age limit
regime. Potential recruits who decide
to jump straight to the N BA don't gen
erally have the grades to come to the
Farm.
I will admit one small, potential
benefit to the Cardinal. An age limit
would allow other elite programs such
as Duke and North Carolina to fill
their scholarships with players ordi
narily headed to the NBA.This would
leave Stanford with less competition
for the few elite players with the GPA
and SAT scores needed to call Maples
Pavilion home. However, all schools,
not just Stanford, should benefit from
this trickle-down effect.
1 know this column has been scary,
but don't jump off of Hoover tower
yet. Stanford is still a premier pro
gram with an excellent recruiter at the
helm, one of the best home courts in
college basketball and,oh yeah,a pret
ty decent academic reputation. A solid
class of freshmen is coming in the fall
and the Lopez twins will grace Maples
in 2006.
Stanford will always be in con
tention for the Pac-10 title for at least
the next half decade. Winning it.on the
