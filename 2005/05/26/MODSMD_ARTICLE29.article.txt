# NBA age limit could hurt Card
## 
### 
Amidst the excitcment of the NBA playoffs lies
a development critical to the future success of
the league.
A new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
is being negotiated between the league and the play
ers union. While whispers of a lockout will dominate
any discussion of the CBA, there is one issue that is far
more important to the dedicated fans of Stanford bas
ketball â€” an age limit.
NBA commissioner David Stern is pushing an
agreement with the union that would prohibit ath
letes under the age of 20 from declaring for the NBA
draft. Due to its controversial nature, the age limit is
considered unlikely to pass in the new CBA.
It has been decried as being racially motivated and
anti-American. Even Dick Vitale,the cheerleader of

college basketball and Duke Uni
versity, has publicly opposed it.
However, let's assume Stern gets
his way, as he usually does, and a
limit does go into effect.

can either enter college or the

especially given the NBAs historical inability to cre
ate a successful minor league system. Thus, it seems
likely that most players who would ordinarily enter
the draft will stay in college under an age limit.This is
bad news for Cardinal fans.
Almost every other elite team in college basket
ball has suffered from losing players to the NBA. Just
imagine what some teams would look like had they
not faced early departures. You have to think Duke,
which garnered a No. 1 seed in the tournament last
year, would have gotten past the Sweet 16 if it had not
lost elite point guard recruit Shuan Livingston and
emerging star Luol Deng to the NBA.
However, let's bring the discussion closer to the
Pacific-10 Conference. Arizona would have been in
the Final Four if highly touted power forward Ndudi
Ebi was roaming the boards for the Wildcats instead
of the bench for the Minnesota Timberwolves. USC
lost highly ranked center Robert Swift to the draft last
year. Washington is set to lose highly touted recruit
Martell Webster to the NBA this season.
