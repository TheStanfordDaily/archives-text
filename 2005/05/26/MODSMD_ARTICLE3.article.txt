told the audience that the new tele
vision would far surpass any exist
ing cable, satellite or video-on
demand system currently available.
"IPTV is way better than TV,"
Lichtman said.
He added that IPTV technology
is only a few years away from being
sold in stores.
Industry analysts, however,
warned that such a system would
take at least half a decade to deploy.
Other corporations pitched their
products as well. TheFacebook.com
President Sean Parker discussed
the importance of community
based content, while Netflix
founder Reed Hastings made an
urgent plea to corporations to pro
vide the consumer with the free
dom of choice when it comes to
content.
"There is an epic struggle
between the forces of control and the
forces of freedom," Hastings said.
"The Web is the bastion of freedom."
Hastings' wariness of technolo
gies that would limit audio and
video content to a specific provider
was a common concern of confer
ence attendees.
Yahoo! Chief Operating Officer
Dan Rosensweig expressed frustra
tion at the inability of the technolo
gy sector to allow the free flow of
information. Specifically, he said the
millions of people who use camera
phones have no easy way to get
their photos off of their cameras.
"Sixty-eight billion photos are
hidden by the anti-forces of free
dom," he said, in reference to
Hastings' earlier comments.

sexy topics."
