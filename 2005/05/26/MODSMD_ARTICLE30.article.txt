# Card duos advance
## 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two-time defending NCAA Singles
Champion Amber Liu stunned the collegiate
tennis circuit on Monday with her first-round
deferral to unseeded contender Aniela Mojzis
of North Carolina
After Mojzis and Liu each claimed a set, it
became clear from the Tar Heels' 6-0 shutout in
the second set that an ailing Liu would be un
able to continue serving in the third.
Few players are more decorated with
NCAA honors than liu, a junior, and the sud
den shoulder injury brought to mind the old
adage: quit while you're ahead.
But Liu would have none of it, and a day
later she was fast-tracking her recovery on the
courts at Dan Magill Tennis Complex, blasting
groundstrokes and volleys with Anne Yelsey in
the NCAA Doubles tournament.
After downing Vanderbilt in the first round,
the Stanford duo sent Florida's Whitney Benik
and Lola Frangulyan packing in the second
round with a 6-1,7-5 defeat.
Liu and Yelsey had made even quicker
work of the Commodores' Audra Falk and
Amanda Taylor, handing them a 6-2,6-2 loss.
Liu reminds us, even when you're ahead,
even when you're wondering if the next serve
might be your last, those accustomed to win
ning will cling fervently to that other adage:
Quitters never win.
So why quit?
"This Is the last event for me [this season],so
I might as well play it out," Liu said.
Yelsey and Liu (21-4) moved up to the No.
1 doubles slot in April and proceeded to win six
of their next seven completed matches.
"We're really happy with how we've
played," Liu said. "We got put in the No. 1 spot
pretty randomly, [but] I think we mesh really
well together and we're just excited to keep
going."
Their year-long successes gave No. 36 Liu
and Yelsey an extra edge against Benik and
Frangulyan, whose own No. 10 national rank
ing defies their freshman status.
The Gators' duo was seeded among the top
eight in the NCAA competition.
"The Florida team picked it up in the sec
ond set, but we had a good comeback at 5-3 to

win it," Yelsey said.
Yelsey, a sophomore. Is concerned about
her partner's health but is confident that they
can finish out an already impressive season.
"[Her shoulder] definitely hurts; Amber got
to the point where she was serving underhand
in her last singles match," Yelsey said. "But in
doubles, you serve every four games, so we're
just doing our best to make our service games
very quick."
Liu maintains that her shoulder has not af
fected her intimidating set of groundstrokes.
Paired with Yelsey's razor-sharp net skills, both
players are primed to take on UCLA's Daniela
Bercek and Riza Zalameda in today's quarter
final.
Despite their No. 4 ranking and 34-7
record, the Bruins' pairing is no stranger to
Cardinal challenges. Last month, Liu and
Yelsey downed them in a hard-fought
tiebreak,9-8(5).
Stanford is the only school to have two
teams in the NCAA Doubles quarterfinal. It
took senior Erin Burdette and junior Alice
Barnes three hours to upset Georgia's top
seeded Caroline Basu and Shadisha Robinson,
6-3,5-7,64.
"Everybody was holding serve and nobody
was really breaking," Barnes said. "But we
served really well and that took just a bit of
pressure off our returning game."
Despite each team anxiously defending its
ground, the Stanford duo saved three break
points while serving out a 2-1 deficit in the third
set. Immediately, Barnes and Burdette would
step up their receiving game to salvage anoth
er 40-0 game.
"After we won those two pivotal games, I
was able to serve out the match," Burdette said.
Burdette opted out of the singles tourna
ment after an ongoing bout of injuries, but says
she is playing better and more confident than
ever after winning the team title.
"I'm really excited but relaxed, and I feel
like I'm striking the ball pretty well," she said.
"It's especially great after winning the team
tournament. That was my main focus coming
in, and I didn't even know if I was going to be
able to play."
The No. 8 Stanford tandem faces Virginia
Commonwealth's Olga Borisova and Marian
na Yuferova (20-7) today.

In singles, Stanford's two remaining con
testants, Yelsey and sophomore Theresa
Logar, both ended their run yesterday in the
Round of 16.
For Logar, it was a case of deja vu as she at
tempted to avenge an earlier loss agaiast Texas
Christian's Story T\veedie-Yates.
No. 14 T\veedie-Yates made the Horned
Frogs' best showing in NCAA history as she
rolled over Logar in straight sets, 6-1,6-3. The
result was nearly identical to her Round of 16
victory against Logar in ITA All-American last
October.
No. 32 Logar ends her individual run with a
33-5 record.
Yelsey forced a tie-break in the second set

but ultimately came up short against Baylor's
Zuzana Zemenova, 6-4,6-7(3), 7-5.
Yelsey counted on her first serve to notch
her some quick points. But with the match tied
at 4-all in the third set, Yelsey's service game
began slipping and so did her confidence.
"I had a few break points and I didn't take
advantage of them," Yelsey said. "Zemenova's
a grinder and she has really heavy ground
strokes and a very solid game overall. I can't
say I'm not disappointed about singles because
it's been a great tournament for me."
No. 61 Yelsey ends her season at 30-7.
Stanford continues in doubles action today

tennis circuit on Monday with her first-round
deferral to unseeded contender Aniela Mojzis
of North Carolina
After Mojzis and Liu each claimed a set, it
became clear from the Tar Heels' 6-0 shutout in
the second set that an ailing Liu would be un
able to continue serving in the third.
Few players are more decorated with
NCAA honors than liu, a junior, and the sud
den shoulder injury brought to mind the old
adage: quit while you're ahead.
But Liu would have none of it, and a day
later she was fast-tracking her recovery on the
courts at Dan Magill Tennis Complex, blasting
groundstrokes and volleys with Anne Yelsey in
the NCAA Doubles tournament.
After downing Vanderbilt in the first round,
the Stanford duo sent Florida's Whitney Benik
and Lola Frangulyan packing in the second
round with a 6-1,7-5 defeat.
Liu and Yelsey had made even quicker
work of the Commodores' Audra Falk and
Amanda Taylor, handing them a 6-2,6-2 loss.
Liu reminds us, even when you're ahead,
even when you're wondering if the next serve
might be your last, those accustomed to win
ning will cling fervently to that other adage:
Quitters never win.
So why quit?
"This Is the last event for me [this season],so
I might as well play it out," Liu said.
Yelsey and Liu (21-4) moved up to the No.
1 doubles slot in April and proceeded to win six
of their next seven completed matches.
"We're really happy with how we've
played," Liu said. "We got put in the No. 1 spot
pretty randomly, [but] I think we mesh really
well together and we're just excited to keep
going."
Their year-long successes gave No. 36 Liu
and Yelsey an extra edge against Benik and
Frangulyan, whose own No. 10 national rank
ing defies their freshman status.
The Gators' duo was seeded among the top
eight in the NCAA competition.
"The Florida team picked it up in the sec
ond set, but we had a good comeback at 5-3 to

win it," Yelsey said.
Yelsey, a sophomore. Is concerned about
her partner's health but is confident that they
can finish out an already impressive season.
"[Her shoulder] definitely hurts; Amber got
to the point where she was serving underhand
in her last singles match," Yelsey said. "But in
doubles, you serve every four games, so we're
just doing our best to make our service games
very quick."
Liu maintains that her shoulder has not af
fected her intimidating set of groundstrokes.
Paired with Yelsey's razor-sharp net skills, both
players are primed to take on UCLA's Daniela
Bercek and Riza Zalameda in today's quarter
final.
Despite their No. 4 ranking and 34-7
record, the Bruins' pairing is no stranger to
Cardinal challenges. Last month, Liu and
Yelsey downed them in a hard-fought
tiebreak,9-8(5).
Stanford is the only school to have two
teams in the NCAA Doubles quarterfinal. It
took senior Erin Burdette and junior Alice
Barnes three hours to upset Georgia's top
seeded Caroline Basu and Shadisha Robinson,
6-3,5-7,64.
"Everybody was holding serve and nobody
was really breaking," Barnes said. "But we
served really well and that took just a bit of
pressure off our returning game."
Despite each team anxiously defending its
ground, the Stanford duo saved three break
points while serving out a 2-1 deficit in the third
set. Immediately, Barnes and Burdette would
step up their receiving game to salvage anoth
er 40-0 game.
"After we won those two pivotal games, I
was able to serve out the match," Burdette said.
Burdette opted out of the singles tourna
ment after an ongoing bout of injuries, but says
she is playing better and more confident than
ever after winning the team title.
"I'm really excited but relaxed, and I feel
like I'm striking the ball pretty well," she said.
"It's especially great after winning the team
tournament. That was my main focus coming
in, and I didn't even know if I was going to be
able to play."
The No. 8 Stanford tandem faces Virginia
Commonwealth's Olga Borisova and Marian
na Yuferova (20-7) today.

In singles, Stanford's two remaining con
testants, Yelsey and sophomore Theresa
Logar, both ended their run yesterday in the
Round of 16.
For Logar, it was a case of deja vu as she at
tempted to avenge an earlier loss agaiast Texas
Christian's Story T\veedie-Yates.
No. 14 T\veedie-Yates made the Horned
Frogs' best showing in NCAA history as she
rolled over Logar in straight sets, 6-1,6-3. The
result was nearly identical to her Round of 16
victory against Logar in ITA All-American last
October.
No. 32 Logar ends her individual run with a
33-5 record.
Yelsey forced a tie-break in the second set

but ultimately came up short against Baylor's
Zuzana Zemenova, 6-4,6-7(3), 7-5.
Yelsey counted on her first serve to notch
her some quick points. But with the match tied
at 4-all in the third set, Yelsey's service game
began slipping and so did her confidence.
"I had a few break points and I didn't take
advantage of them," Yelsey said. "Zemenova's
a grinder and she has really heavy ground
strokes and a very solid game overall. I can't
say I'm not disappointed about singles because
it's been a great tournament for me."
No. 61 Yelsey ends her season at 30-7.
Stanford continues in doubles action today
after the conclusion of singles play, which be
gins 8 a.m. PST.
