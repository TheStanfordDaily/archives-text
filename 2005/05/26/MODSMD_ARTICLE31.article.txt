# East Coast teams await
## Stanford off to Nationals 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
It has been a light week of practice for
the members of the No. 8 women's first var
sity boat — a rarity given that they have had
months of tough practice, training and con
ditioning. But this week is just the calm be
fore the storm.
Competing this weekend at Lake
Natoma in Rancho Cordova, Calif., the Car
dinal women will run the final three races of
their season at the NCAA Championships.
With their sights set on the Sunday Grand
Final, they enter the regatta looking to bring
home a medal in the first varsity eight divi
sion. But the Stanford women also know
that in order to have that opportunity, they
will need to post strong performances in
their first two events of the weekend.
By taking silver at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships two weeks ago, the
members of the women's first varsity boat
earned an at-large bid to NCAAs.They will
be facing off against 15 other crews in their
effort to proclaim themselves the fastest
first varsity eight in the nation.
The nine women in the Stanford boat
will be the only ones representing their team
at the NCAA Championships, but they
know that their at-large invitation to the
competition came as the result of the whole
squad's tireless efforts this season.
"The entire team worked very hard to
get back to NCAAs, and [the first varsity
eight] represents the team's hard work,"
head coach Aimee Baker said.
The field featured in this weekend's re
gatta will provide the Cardinal with their
toughest challenges of the year. Perhaps
most impressive are the undefeated Golden
Bears, who took the Pac-10 team title in

commanding fashion, and No. 2 Yale, who
knocked off previously top-ranked Prince
ton at the Eastern Sprints. The Cardinal
know that they will have to be on top of their
race strategy to have a chance at advancing
to the regattas Grand Final.
"We have a huge amount of respect for
all the other boats," Baker said. "Often it
comes down to 10 boats that time-wise
could make a six-boat final."
The unsurprisingly large East Coast
presence at Lake Natoma greatly increases
the quality of the challenge the Cardinal will
face. At Pac-lOs the Cardinal were able to
take a moderately relaxed approach in their
semifinal race, knowing that a solid showing
would give them the second-place finish
needed to reach the Grand Final. But
against this weekend's much stronger com
petition, the Stanford women's margin for
error will be slim in all three of their races.
"In the previous events, we were able to
go into our heats with good confidence
about qualifying without burning ourselves
out before the Grand Final," junior Margit
Zwemer said. "This weekend, there are so

many strong teams in each heat that we just
have to take each heat as it comes and make
it our best race yet this season."
While maintaining a healthy respect for
the challenge posed by their competition,
the Cardinal enter the weekend confident in
their ability to stand up to the challenge.
And given the way they have been rowing
together recently, this attitude comes as no
surprise.
"The practices the last two weeks have
been powerful and fast," senior coxswain
Kelly Garneski said. "I'm looking forward
to racing the best in the country and know
we are ready to take them on."
All 16 squads in the NCAA field have
proven themselves capable of pulling off
dominant performances this season, so the
Cardinal know that they will need to take
their intensity one notch higher to pull away
from the field.
"1 see it as five seconds separating 16
boats," Baker said. "We have to race more
aggressively than we have to make it
through Friday and Saturday to the Grand
Final on Sunday."

The Pac-10 Grand Final clearly demon
strated the women's ability to elevate their
performance in the clutch. Facing a late
surge from the Southern California boat in
the final 500 meters of the race, the Cardinal
maintained their composure to hold off the
move and beat the Women of TVoy to the fin
ish line by .20 seconds.
Finding the extra gear needed to hang
with the field at an NCAA championship
will require the Cardinal to draw upon their
physical preparation and mental toughness
— and that gear is one Baker is fully confi
dent her team possesses.
And with all the components of their race
honed to perfection, all that remains for the
Cardinal is to translate their potential into
results — and in that respect, the Stanford
women find themselves in the same boat as
every one of the crews they will take on this
weekend.
"We've put in a lot of work this year, and
it's finally the time to see how fast we can
make our boat go," senior Missy Fiesler said.
"Everyone has eight oars, one boat and one
chance at the win — we just have to do it."
