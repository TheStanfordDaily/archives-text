Frosh names football fan section
It's safe to say that freshman Alexa Stottlemyer did
not receive any useful advice from her parents when she
decided to enter the Stanford Athletic Department's stu-

dent-wide contest to name the new
football student group.

—— c» r
Stottlemyer's proposed *
name, "The Red Zone," and T- '
shirt design — which features
the slogan "Are you in it?" on the

back — were chosen for the group 1
that will start in the fall.
"I would never have thought that a
girl whose parents both graduated from
Berkeley and whose dad holds Cal foot-

ball season tickets would have been given a part in put
ting a name on the Stanford student section," Stottlemy
er said.

Students were allowed to submit up to three names
and designs. Football head coach Walt Harris judged the
entries.
Stottlemyer said she is hopeful that the T-shirts and
student group will generate more excitement for Cardi
nal football.

"There's really nothing like college football in the
fall and it would be amazing if more students were en
couraged to come out to support the team," she said.

Membership in The Red Zone, at-

tained by purchasing either foot
i ball season tickets or a 2005-2006
[ All AXE-cess Pass, will include a
112 T-shirt and free food at pre-game
tailgating events.The Athletic De-

o o *
partment is still considering the possi
bility of designating a specific section
in Stanford Stadium for Red Zone
members.
Stottlemyer received a free All AXE-

cess pass and will be recognized on the video board dur
ing a home game this season.
