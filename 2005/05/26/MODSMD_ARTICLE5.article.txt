# Ethicists tackle egg donation

### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Biomedical ethicists at the School of
Medicine are calling for more protections
for women who volunteer to donate
embryos.
Mildred Cho, associate professor of
pediatrics, and David Magnus, associate
professor of pediatrics and director of
Stanford's Center for Biomedical Ethics,
published a paper urging the creation of a
new category for research subjects that
would include women donating embryos.
This change would help ensure that they
are well informed of the risks associated

with donation.
Before Proposition 71 was passed, there
was minimal effort put into generating new
stem cells for research. However,
researchers at universities and medical cen
ters across the country have greater means
for conducting stem cell research.
Accordingly, using donated embryos and
the treatment of voluntary donors have
become more critical issues.
Cho and Magnus reported that women
donating embryos for stem cell research
fall into a different category than other tis
sue donors.
"While people donate tissue all
the time, it is mostly in the form of
blood or sperm," Cho said.
If tissue is removed from the
body it is usually done for clinical
reasons. The procedure necessary
to extract a woman's egg, however,
is performed solely for research
purposes, Cho added.
Both Cho and Magnus noted
that women donating embryos face
more serious medical risks than
other tissue donors, and 1 percent
of women donors are hospitalized
during the process.
"Serious risks are rare, but they
are not zero," Magnus said.
Protections for egg donors will
depend on where the research is
conducted. The National Academy

of Science has ethical guidelines for
scientists to follow if they plan on
publishing their research.
"The danger is that the
researchers view the women as a
tissue donor, but small and signifi
cant risks would get shortchanged
and that's a problem," Magnus said.
The most important protection
for these women would likely be to
simply inform them of the risks
involved in egg donation.
"Before exposing anybody to
that level of risk, it is necessary to
see that the outcome is worth it,"
Magnus said.
Cho added that researchers
must have realistic expectations.
"Because there is such a huge
consensus among the international
community about being able to do
research, scientists shouldn't
encourage people to participate
because of some kind of miscon
ception that research would have
immediate results," she said.
