# Ethicists tackle egg donation

### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Biomedical ethicists at the School of
Medicine are calling for more protections
for women who volunteer to donate
embryos.
Mildred Cho, associate professor of
pediatrics, and David Magnus, associate
professor of pediatrics and director of
Stanford's Center for Biomedical Ethics,
published a paper urging the creation of a
new category for research subjects that
would include women donating embryos.
This change would help ensure that they
are well informed of the risks associated

with donation.
Before Proposition 71 was passed, there
was minimal effort put into generating new
stem cells for research. However,
researchers at universities and medical cen
ters across the country have greater means
for conducting stem cell research.
Accordingly, using donated embryos and
the treatment of voluntary donors have
become more critical issues.
Cho and Magnus reported that women
donating embryos for stem cell research
fall into a different category than other tis
sue donors.
