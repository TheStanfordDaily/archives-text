# Some take time off to enhance applications
## More delay college entrance 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More and more seniors are planning to
take a year off after graduation. But not just
seniors in college — hut also seniors in high
school who work, retake standardized tests or
travel prior to starting their post-secondary
education.
"There are students every year who apply
to us for the first time after taking time off
since high school, and there are also students

who decide to defer their offer of admission
fora year," said Anna Marie Porras, director of
admissions at Stanford.
Porras said she believes that taking time off
is ideal when it is the best option fora student,
not when it is the only option fora student or
when it is imagined to provide a strategic
advantage.
"Taking time off before going to college is
absolutely the appropriate decision for some
students. Doing so can promote
growth and maturity, a refreshed per
spective and the discovery of a new
passion or interest to pursue during
college," she said. "However, I would
never encourage a student to take
time off just so they have a year-long
experience to write about in their col
lege application."
Some admissions officers inter
viewed by the Boston Globe said that
taking a year off to improve chances
of admission to an Ivy League is a bad
idea; it would be better to go some
where else freshman year, earn good
grades and apply to transfer.
Porras said that Stanford encour
ages students who are not admitted to
Stanford to attend college elsewhere
fora year or two and then re-apply.
"We do not recommend turning
down the other impressive offers of
admission they receive to take time
off just to reapply for freshman admis
sion," she said.
The Center for Interim Programs,
an organization that provides person
ally-tailored recommendations for
how students should spend their time
off, is the first of its kind.
In a Boston Globe article. Holly
Bull, president of the Center for

Interim Programs, said she believes
that time off can make a student a bet
ter college applicant, noting that most
often affluent families select the inter
im year option.
"It puts you into a whole different
basket as far as the colleges are con
cerned," said Bull in the article.
"When you think about what colleges
are looking at, it's the same old, same
old — head of the yearbook, blah,
blah, blah."
In addition. Bob Gilpin, president
of Time-Out Associates, which pro
vides an interim program-search serv
ice similar to that of the Center for
Interim Programs, told the Boston
Globe that he received "twice the
number of inquiries this spring than
he has at the same time in any of the
last three or four years."
