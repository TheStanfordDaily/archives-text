# Survey shows pain affects all
## Researchers advise increased focus on pain management 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than half of all American
adults ages 18 to 65 live with chron
ic or recurrent bodily pains, accord
ing to a survey conducted in April
by the Stanford University Medical
Center, ABC News and USA Today.
With 60 percent of these rating their
last experience with pain as "moder
ate or worse," scientists are begin
ning to realize how much of a role
pain plays in the lives of Americans
today.
"Pain is not only a sign of other
illnesses; it is also much like a dis
ease of its own," said Dr. Raymond
Gaeta, associate professor of anes
thesia and director of pain-manage

ment services at the Stanford
Hospital. "Despite the übiquitous
nature of pain, it has only recently
come into its own."
The survey was conducted by
telephone to 1,204 individuals from
April 13 to 19. The interviewers
questioned participants about
where pain was most common in
their body, what methods they have
taken to alleviate the pain and effec
tiveness of these remedies.
Back pain was cited by a quarter
of the respondents as their most
common pain location, followed by
knees (12 percent) and head/
migraines (9 percent). Of these, 20
percent called their pain "severe,"
and 40 percent said their pain
occurred "often."
Pain is not just a crippling state
physically — it can also affect a
patient's mental and emotional
well-being. The psychological
effects of pain amplify trauma and
contribute to depression, anxiety,
sleeplessness and suicide. Four in 10
of those surveyed said pain inter

fered with their mood, activities,
sleep, ability to do work or enjoy
ment of life, with two-thirds report
ing interference with at least one of
these.
The medical society is struggling
with this onslaught of pain-ridden
adults. The American Board of Pain
Medicine has taken the lead in edu
cating and credentialing pain-medi
cine specialists, but so far has certi
fied only 1,700 — one pain specialist
for every 23,500 people who need
care.
However, according to Gaeta,
U.S. Congress has declared this
decade as the decade of pain
research.
Methods respondents used to
treat their pain ranged widely, from
mainstream means like prescription
drugs to more non-traditional tech
niques like acupuncture. Over-the
counter drugs and home remedies
are the most popular, but the most
effective way respondents cited was
