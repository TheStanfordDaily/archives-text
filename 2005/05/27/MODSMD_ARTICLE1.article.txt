# Card host Super Regional
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
They flew through the first round, but this weekend the
stakes are higher and the opponents stronger.
After three wins on the road in Regional competition,
the No. 4 Stanford softball team (43-14) returns home this
weekend for a best-of-three battle with No. 11 Tennessee
(59-13) for a trip to Oklahoma City and a spot in the
Women's College World Series.
Stanford was one of five teams from the Pacific-10
Conference to advance to the Super Regionals.The Pac-10,
which consists of eight softball teams, was the nation's only
conference to see all its members selected to the 64-team
bracket. Co-Pac-10 champs Stanford, No. 2 California and
No. 3 Arizona advanced and will be joined by No. 12
UCLA and No. 21 Washington in the field of 16 remaining
teams. Fourth co-champ No. 6 Oregon State failed to
advance despite being seeded eighth at the beginning of
the tournament. Arizona State and Oregon also did not
make it out of the first round.

Stanford head coach John
Rittman said that this year's
Stanford team is one of the best
he has seen, comparing it to the
two teams he took to the
Women's College World Series in
2001 and 2004.
"We have a lot of options with
this team, a lot of depth," Rittman
said. "Different people have
stepped up big in different times
of the year. I think that this is the
best offensive team we have had
top to bottom in the lineup."
Tennessee advanced to the
Super Regional with three
shutout victories over Miami
University, Virginia Tech and
College of Charleston. Ace pitch
er Monica Abbott (45-7) gave up
three hits while striking out 19 in
the first two games, then threw a
10-strikeout no-hitter against
Charleston.
Abbott is a smothering pitch
er who boasts an incredible 0.51
ERA, holding opposing batters to

a .121 average, with 553 strikeouts — an average of more
than 10 per game — and has given up only 14 homers in 52
games.
"With Monica, we need to lay off of pitches out of the
zone," Rittman said. "We need to get pitches in the zone to
hit and put the ball in play and then when we have runners
in scoring position to get the timely hit, the clutch hit."
Abbott could potentially give the Cardinal trouble in
the batter's box, but Stanford's conference experience
gives the team confidence heading into this weekend.
"We know they have a left-handed pitcher who throws
hard and is pretty dominant," senior catcher Leah Nelson
said. "But we're prepared. We see a lot of different pitchers
in the Pac-10,so 1 think that has prepared us."
In the batter's box, Kristi Durant leads the Lady Vols
with 75 RBI and is hitting at a .405 clip.Tennessee does not
have a single dominant power hitter like Stanford's fresh
man phenom Michelle Smith, but depends on contribu
tions from the entire team, with six players posting at least
40 RBI on the season.
"They swing the bat very well," Rittman said. "Their
numbers are very good offensively, so we are going to have
to play defense, make pitches. It's going to be a good cou
ple of games."
The Cardinal advanced to the Super Regional with a
perfect record in the Missouri Regional a week ago. They
took the opener Friday against Robert Morris in a 9-0 rout
cut short by the mercy rule, then beat No. 20 Southern
Illinois on Saturday, 9-1. A much tougher 3-2 victory over
No. 16 Missouri clinched Stanford's spot in this weekend's
Super Regional.
Nelson led the charge at the plate, swinging a hot bat in
the clutch. After hitting only seven homefs all season, she
hammered three out of the park last weekend, posting four
RBI against Southern Illinois and bringing in all three of
Stanford's runs with a fourth-inning blast against Missouri.
"Obviously to come away 3-0 was very good," Rittman
said. "We didn't need to play the 'if game and I thought
our team played very poised. We made some mistakes but
we bounced back from the adversity and stayed together
as a team. We got some big, huge clutch hits during the
weekend."
Freshman hurler Becky McCullough (21-6), who has
emerged as Stanford's ace in her rookie season, started all
three games and pitched two complete, giving up three
runs on 11 hits with 13 strikeouts in 18 innings of work.

Sophomore Jackie Rinehort carries a .331 batting average into today's first game of a tfiree-game set with
Tennessee with a birth in the Women's College World Series at stake.
Junior Laura Severson (15-6)
pitched two shutout innings against
Robert Morris in relief.
"Becky pitched extremely well,"
Rittman said. "And Laura came in
against Robert Morris for a few
innings and gave us real solid innings
there."
"It's fun, very exciting to get it
going," McCullough said. "And three
wins — you can't really go wrong
with that."
Tennessee and Stanford have
only met three times, once for a dou
bleheader in 1997 and once in 2(XX).
ITie Cardinal won all three games
and have outscored the Lady Vols
21-1 all-time.
The Super Regional format,
which has been used for several
years in baseball playoffs, was intro
duced to softball this year.
"I don't know if there is that big
of a difference in the competition or
the teams that are going to end up in
the World Series," Nelson said.
"Right now, it just feels like there are
more games. It's nice, more celebra
tion when you win. I like that."
McCullough said she does not
see much difference between the
round-robin format of the Regional
and the Super Regional series.
"Last weekend we took the
games one game at a time and
looked at each opponent." she said.
'This is going to be the same thing.
We've just got to win each game.
We're not going to really worry
about their game and just try to stick
to our game plan."
The Cardinal and the Lady Vols
face off today at 6 p.m. and Saturday
at 1 p.m. at Hoyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium. In the event of a
split, the "if' game will be added to
make Saturday a doubleheader.
Ihough Stanford has split some dou
ble-headers this season, it has not lost
the second game, which would
decide the series winner if played.
"We've tried to do our research
on them and we're just going to see
what happens when we get out
there," Nelson said. "1 think we're
playing great right now. We're peak
ing at just the right time."

"With Monica, we need to lay off of pitches out of the
zone," Rittman said. "We need to get pitches in the zone to
hit and put the ball in play and then when we have runners
in scoring position to get the timely hit, the clutch hit."
Abbott could potentially give the Cardinal trouble in
the batter's box, but Stanford's conference experience
gives the team confidence heading into this weekend.
"We know they have a left-handed pitcher who throws
hard and is pretty dominant," senior catcher Leah Nelson
said. "But we're prepared. We see a lot of different pitchers
in the Pac-10,so 1 think that has prepared us."
In the batter's box, Kristi Durant leads the Lady Vols
with 75 RBI and is hitting at a .405 clip.Tennessee does not
have a single dominant power hitter like Stanford's fresh
man phenom Michelle Smith, but depends on contribu
tions from the entire team, with six players posting at least
40 RBI on the season.
"They swing the bat very well," Rittman said. "Their
numbers are very good offensively, so we are going to have
to play defense, make pitches. It's going to be a good cou
ple of games."
The Cardinal advanced to the Super Regional with a
perfect record in the Missouri Regional a week ago. They
took the opener Friday against Robert Morris in a 9-0 rout
cut short by the mercy rule, then beat No. 20 Southern
Illinois on Saturday, 9-1. A much tougher 3-2 victory over
No. 16 Missouri clinched Stanford's spot in this weekend's
Super Regional.
Nelson led the charge at the plate, swinging a hot bat in
the clutch. After hitting only seven homefs all season, she
hammered three out of the park last weekend, posting four
RBI against Southern Illinois and bringing in all three of
Stanford's runs with a fourth-inning blast against Missouri.
"Obviously to come away 3-0 was very good," Rittman
said. "We didn't need to play the 'if game and I thought
our team played very poised. We made some mistakes but
we bounced back from the adversity and stayed together
as a team. We got some big, huge clutch hits during the
weekend."
Freshman hurler Becky McCullough (21-6), who has
emerged as Stanford's ace in her rookie season, started all
three games and pitched two complete, giving up three
runs on 11 hits with 13 strikeouts in 18 innings of work.

Sophomore Jackie Rinehort carries a .331 batting average into today's first game of a tfiree-game set with
Tennessee with a birth in the Women's College World Series at stake.
Junior Laura Severson (15-6)
pitched two shutout innings against
Robert Morris in relief.
"Becky pitched extremely well,"
Rittman said. "And Laura came in
against Robert Morris for a few
innings and gave us real solid innings
there."
"It's fun, very exciting to get it
going," McCullough said. "And three
wins — you can't really go wrong
with that."
Tennessee and Stanford have
only met three times, once for a dou
bleheader in 1997 and once in 2(XX).
ITie Cardinal won all three games
and have outscored the Lady Vols
21-1 all-time.
The Super Regional format,
which has been used for several
years in baseball playoffs, was intro
duced to softball this year.
"I don't know if there is that big
of a difference in the competition or
the teams that are going to end up in
the World Series," Nelson said.
"Right now, it just feels like there are
more games. It's nice, more celebra
tion when you win. I like that."
McCullough said she does not
see much difference between the
round-robin format of the Regional
and the Super Regional series.
"Last weekend we took the
games one game at a time and
looked at each opponent." she said.
'This is going to be the same thing.
We've just got to win each game.
We're not going to really worry
about their game and just try to stick
to our game plan."
The Cardinal and the Lady Vols
face off today at 6 p.m. and Saturday
at 1 p.m. at Hoyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium. In the event of a
split, the "if' game will be added to
make Saturday a doubleheader.
Ihough Stanford has split some dou
ble-headers this season, it has not lost
the second game, which would
decide the series winner if played.
"We've tried to do our research
on them and we're just going to see
what happens when we get out
there," Nelson said. "1 think we're
playing great right now. We're peak
ing at just the right time."

Freshman Tricia Aggabao (left) and a cast of other Cardinal freshmen have helped make the transition to tfie col
lege game easier for fellow rookie Erin Howe (right) this season. Howe enters today's game with 21 RBI.
They flew through the first round, but this weekend the
stakes are higher and the opponents stronger.
After three wins on the road in Regional competition,
the No. 4 Stanford softball team (43-14) returns home this
weekend for a best-of-three battle with No. 11 Tennessee
(59-13) for a trip to Oklahoma City and a spot in the
Women's College World Series.
Stanford was one of five teams from the Pacific-10
Conference to advance to the Super Regionals.The Pac-10,
which consists of eight softball teams, was the nation's only
conference to see all its members selected to the 64-team
bracket. Co-Pac-10 champs Stanford, No. 2 California and
No. 3 Arizona advanced and will be joined by No. 12
UCLA and No. 21 Washington in the field of 16 remaining
teams. Fourth co-champ No. 6 Oregon State failed to
advance despite being seeded eighth at the beginning of
the tournament. Arizona State and Oregon also did not
make it out of the first round.

STANFORD
Today, 6 p.m.
Smith Stadium

Stanford head coach John
Rittman said that this year's
Stanford team is one of the best
he has seen, comparing it to the
two teams he took to the
Women's College World Series in
2001 and 2004.
"We have a lot of options with
this team, a lot of depth," Rittman
said. "Different people have
stepped up big in different times
of the year. I think that this is the
best offensive team we have had
top to bottom in the lineup."
Tennessee advanced to the
Super Regional with three
shutout victories over Miami
University, Virginia Tech and
College of Charleston. Ace pitch
er Monica Abbott (45-7) gave up
three hits while striking out 19 in
the first two games, then threw a
10-strikeout no-hitter against
Charleston.
Abbott is a smothering pitch
er who boasts an incredible 0.51
ERA, holding opposing batters to

a .121 average, with 553 strikeouts — an average of more
than 10 per game — and has given up only 14 homers in 52
games.
"With Monica, we need to lay off of pitches out of the
zone," Rittman said. "We need to get pitches in the zone to
