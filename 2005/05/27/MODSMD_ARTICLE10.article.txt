# Universities urged to divest from companies linked to Sudanese government
## 
### JESSICA HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
John Pendergast, special advisor to the presi
dent of the International Crisis Group, and
Samantha Power, a Pulitzer-prize winning au
thor and public policy lecturer at Harvard, re
cently sent a letter to presidents of more than 100
American universities urging them to divest
from companies operating in Sudan.
The letter lobbies for divestment from oil
companies PetroChina, Sinopec and ABB, Ltd.,
and weapons company Taftnet, four companies
that conduct business in Sudan.
"The divestment of any such stock would
send a strong signal to the Sudanese regime and
those who support it about the unacceptability of
the government's actions in Darfur," John Pen
dergast and Powers wrote.
But according to University President John
Hennessy, Stanford has not yet received the letter.
The student group Students Taking Action
Now: Darfur, or STAND, has been working to
encourage divestment, and members said they
hope that Pendergast and Power's support will
add weight to their campaign by linking it to the
national divestment effort.
"Pendergast's advocacy of divestment is espe
cially important because it proves that this is a
cause that goes beyond the Stanford communi
ty," said junior Ben Elberger, a leader of STAND.
The group has recently gained ground with
the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibili
ty's recommendation that the Board of Trustees
consider divestment.
"I don't think we will have a posi
tion until we consider the recommen
dation from APIR and the review by
the trustee committee," Hennessy
said in an interview with The Daily.
"This could happen at the next
trustee meeting in June."
Harvard recently announced its
plan to divest from PetroChina, Ltd.,
and Pendergast stressed the impor
tance that Stanford follow this lead.
"Having Stanford divest would
help start a domino effect that has the
potential to sweep through the in
vestment community," he said. "The
combination of Stanford -and Har
vard would provide a West Coast-
East Coast one-two punch that
would start to generate real pressure
on other universities to follow suit."
