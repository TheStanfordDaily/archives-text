# Give it the Axe: Stadium to be replaced
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Stadium, a time-honored part of the
University's landscape, may soon have a date
with a wrecking ball, as it is scheduled to be retro
fitted or even replaced with a state-of-the-art
arena.
In an official statement, Alan Acosta, associate
vice president for public affairs, called it a "long
needed renovation that will not only benefit Stan
ford Athletics, but the University at-large and the
countless community residents who attend Stan
ford sporting events."

The need for these changes has been clear for
nianv years, Acosta wrote. But planrfor the proj
ect are only beginning to be formalized.
Citing sources close to the athletic department,
an article in yesterday's San Francisco Chronicle
said the stadium would be demolished soon after
the Cardinal plays Notre Dame on Nov. 26.
ITie article stated that the building project
comes as a result of Stanford Stadium's outdated
bathrooms, its obsolete running track and a drop
in attendance, which has made it difficult to fill the
85.500 seats. The new arena would only seat
55,000.The Chronicle reported.
However, the University has not announced a

timeframe for the project, and Acosta said that
the project is still in its "earliest stages."The Stan
ford Board of Trustees and Santa Clara County
must approve the plans before further steps are
taken.
The original Stadium was constructed in 1921,
born out of a competition with UC Berkeley to see
which university could build a stadium first. Al
though Stanford won the contest and scored the
christening touchdown on its home field, the
Bears won the inaugural Big Game that year.The
stadium has since hosted the World Cup and
Olympic soccer matches, as well as Super Bowl
XIX in 1985.
