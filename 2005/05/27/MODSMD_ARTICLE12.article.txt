### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Soon Ok Lee, a survivor of the North Ko
rean prison system, recounted stories of the
torture and executions that are standard
under the rule of Kim Jong-ll in a talk last
night.
Lee, who has testified before the United
Nations, U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Rep
resentatives, has been involved in a campaign
to raise awareness of human rights transgres
sions in North Korea and lobby governments
to exert greater pressure on the Kim dictator
ship to stop persecuting its citizens.
"There is no country in the world like
North Korea, which treats its people like
slaves," Lee said. "The 2(K),(KK) political pris
oners there must be liberated."
Born to a privileged family in North
Korea. Lee, 58. joined the Communist Party
as a young woman and rose through the ranks
to become the supervisor of a material distri
bution center. She said her nightmare began
when the party needed scapegoats to blame
for the famine and deteriorating economy.
"When the economy worsened and peo
ple were starving, the party wanted me to take
responsibility." she said. "the party said I did
n't fulfill my duties, and 1 was dragged to the
prison without knowing what 1 did wrong."
For 14 months, beginning in 1983. Lee was
tortured. She was forced to remain outdoors
in freezing temperatures and was hit in the
chest until her ribs broke — acts intended to
coerce her into admitting her alleged crimes.
When she could no longer stand the treat
ment. she pleaded guilty and was sentenced
to death.
Although this sentence was eventually
withdrawn. Lee spent the next seven years in
a prison with 6,(HX) other political prisoners.
The conditions she experienced were beyond

description, she said.
"People were literally putin bird cages,"
Lee said. "Children were separated from
their parents. Women prisoners who were
pregnant must abort their pregnancy. But
some babies did not die and were born. The
guards would step on the heads of those ba
bies with their boot. Because their mothers
were criminals, the babies were subject to the
same association."
Lee's speech started with a 10-minute clip
filmed by a documentary filmmaker who
snuck into North Korea with a small video
camera and recorded incidents of public exe
cutions. In one trial scene, nine North Kore
ans — labeled as "beast-like criminals." "trai
tors" and "atrocities in human skin" by court
officials — were prosecuted for attempting to
cross the border into China. Seven of them
were sentenced to "life at hard work" and the
other two were immediately put to death.

After the sentencing, their mouths were
stuffed with stones so that they could not
shout condemnations against the regime be
fore their deaths.
Lee said that most countries have been
concerned primarily with North Korea's pos
session of nuclear weapons, but have done lit
tle to improve human rights. In particular,she
blamed China for backing North Korea and
helping to prolong Kim's regime.
"The North Korean regime will not sur
vive without the Chinese support," Lee said.
"But China overlooks the human rights issues
in North Korea.They arrest all North Korean
refugees and return them to North Korea."
Lee urged students and the public to exert
pressure on the Chinese government to deny
support to North Korea through petitions
and demonstrations. If China ignores calls for
terminating its alliance with North Korea, the
international community should disqualify
China as the host of the 2008 Olympics, she
said.
"Human rights issues in North Korea are
not to be resolved by North Koreans alone,"
she added."Kim Jong-II will not cooperate if
there isn't a worldwide network of govern
ments and NGOs working to improve human
rights there."
Sophomore Soomin Kim, an organizer of
NK Focus — a campus human rights group
devoted to North Korean issues that spon
sored the speech — said that Lee delivered a
very powerful appeal for students to pay at
tention to human rights violations perpetrat
ed in North Korea.
"She not only informed us of the crimes
perpetrated by the North Korean regimes,
but also told us what we can do as students to
join the movement," she said.
"I hope people will become more interest-
