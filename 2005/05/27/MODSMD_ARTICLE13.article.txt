University Provost John Etchemendy
unveiled the budget for the 2005-2006 ac
ademic year at yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting. In what he said will be an "excel
lent budget year," Etchemendy forecasted
a 7.6 percent increase in the University's
total revenue and a surplus of $49.2 mil
lion in the consolidated budget, which en
compasses all University operations.

Significant increases in investment,
health care revenues and sponsored re
search income will primarily contribute to
the increase in the University's total rev
enue. The 4.5 percent tuition hike planned
for next year will amount to an additional
$16.8 million of income, Etchemendy said.
Of the $2.82 billion in consolidated
budget expenses, 61 percent will be allo
cated for academic purposes, while 21, 10
and 6 percent will go toward administra
tive offices, the Stanford Linear Accelcra

tor Center, or SLAC, and auxiliary costs,
respectively. The School of Medicine,
guaranteed more than $800 million, will
once again take the largest portion —
nearly half — of the funds committed to
academic units.
SLAC will receive the largest increase
in funding next year. The University has
committed to a 21 percent increase to
SLAC's current $263 million budget. The
money will partially fund the con
struction of the $400 million Linac
Coherent Light Source laser, which
will be the first and only X-ray elec
tron laser of its kind in the world
for at least 10 years. Etchemendy
hailed the project as a "fantastic
thing for not just SLAC, but Stan
ford and the entire research com
munity."
Hie coming year's consolidated
budget will be nearly double that of

the 1995-19% fiscal year's total of
$1.5 billion, which Etchemendy at
tributed to the University's "enor
mous growth" over the past decade.
A surplus of more than $130 mil
lion in general funds (income from
tuition, the endowment an indirect
cost recoveries) is expected. Much
of these will be allocated to infra
structure support services as well as
salaries and benefits for employ
ees. Etchemendy also highlighted
the Bioengineering Department,
School of Humanities and Sciences
and Law School clinics as "academ
ic priorities" which are slated to re
ceive major shares of the general
funds.
