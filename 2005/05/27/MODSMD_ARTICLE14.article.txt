# Stem cell research center lures top researchers
## Scientists come to Stanford 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Two leading stem cell scientists are head
ing to The Farm to continue their work,
thanks in part to the $3 billion instate fund
ing for stem cell research.
In April, Stanford formed the Program in
Regenerative Medicine to focus on interdis
cipiinary stem cell and regenerative medicine
projects — attracting scientists like Michael
Clarke from the University of Michigan
Medical School and Stefan Heller of Har
vard Medical School.
"There are several reasons I'm coming to
Stanford, but a big one is the new stem cell in
stitute," Clarke said in an interview with The
Daily. "It's going to be one of the best, if not
the best in the world. I think [my future] col
leagues at Stanford are phenomenal."
Along with Clarke and Heller, Dean of
Stanford's School of Medicine Philip Pizzo
said he expects more additions.
"Presently we anticipate recruiting a lim
ited number of additional investigators, fo
cusing on the excellence of the candidates
and the new areas of research that she or he
can bring to Stanford," he said "In the imme
diate future I would envision the recruitment
of six to ten additional stem cell investiga
tors."
In his research,Clarke has found that only
a subset of cancer cells is responsible for the
spread of tumors. Heller is working with
pluripotent stem cells, which some day may
be able to be transplanted to treat deafness.
Clarke is the first scientist to isolate stem
cells from breast tumors. Because these are
the cells that divide, zoning in on them might
be the answer to curing cancer, or at least
making therapies more effective.
"My lab has found that in human tumors
there's a stem cell population — we're the
first lab to devscribe adult stem cells that make
more cells," he said.
Both Clarke and Heller are known for
being the first to isolate specific
types of stem cells. Like Clarke, Heller's work
has been concerned mainly with stem cells
from adult and animal tissues. Heller has
worked with the embryonic stem cells from
mice to create inner ear hair cells from mouse
embryonic stem cells. As SO percent of deaf
ness is due to damage or destruction of inner

ear hair cells. Heller's work has been a
ground-breaking discovery.
California voters have supported stem
cell research, allocating nearly $3 billion in
state funds last November, drawing top scien
tists to the Golden State. However, the White
House has been reluctant to do the same.
On Tuesday, the US. House of Represen
tatives approved stem-cell funding, despite a
threat from President George W. Bush to
veto legislation expanding research.The 238-
194 vote in the House was a rare defeat for
the president, raising the possibility of ex
panded stem cell research passing through
the Senate as well.
If the federal funding proposition does go
through. Pizzo said that he will embrace fed
eral funding for stem cell research and does
not believe it could detract from the influx of
researchers coming to Stanford.
"I do not view this as competitive with our
California initiatives but rather additive and
synergistic," Pizzo said 'The ultimate goal
must be to do all we can to foster research
that enhances our fundamental knowledge
of stem cell biology and that ultimately leads
to new treatments or preventive strategies
for diseases impacting adults and children."
