## 
### DAVID KUO STAFF WRITER 
This year's top three winners of the
business Association of Stanford Engi
neering Students, or BASES, E-Challenge
are vying fot something more than just the
cash prizes -fthey will represent Stanford at
the Draper fisher Juvetson Venture Chal
lenge in earfv June.
Out of 75 submitted business plans, the
Adaptive Hearing Solutions proposal —
developed by electrical engineering gradu
ate student Paul Cuff and business students
Rory McDonald and Will Anderson —
took top prize and is automatically in con
tention for the DFJ Venture Challenge.'l"he
E-Challenge boasts an impressive award of
$250,000 in venture funding. 'Die next two
business plans, Noburol and Smart Works/
Consumer Micro-Robots, will have wild
card status in the DFJ Venture Challenge.
The Adaptive Hearing Solutions busi
ness plan outlines the developing of a filter
that would reduce noise and enhance the
speech quality of hearing aids.The Noburol
proposal details outpatient procedure for
patients who have suffered head trauma.
Lastly, the Smart Works / Consumer Micro-
Robots pitch calls for an inexpensive robot
that would help clean homes.
Junior Elvina Mintarno, an organizer
and member of BASES, said she was
pleased with the impact BASES has on the
Stanford campus.
"BASES has done a really good job pro
moting entrepreneurship in the student
body," she said. "Many students see them
selves working for big companies. We're
opening the door for people who want to
do their own work after they earn a de
gree."
Ilie E-Challenge is designed to encour
age students to look beyond the competi
tion and to think long-term about their
business plans.
"In the past, many projects stopped
after the E-Challenge," Mintarno said,
adding that the goal is to have students
think seriously about starting a company.
Mintarn<fsaid she felt larger off-campus
competitions would raise interest in entre
preneufshiphere at Stanford."
Ilie DFJ Challenge will bring together
winners from 10 other California Universi
ties— including California Institute of
Technology and UC Berkeley — and will

be judged by venture capitalists.
Joshua Raffaelli. an analyst with DFJ, a
venture capital firm, explained that the
goal of the competition is to expand the
participants' business perspective.
"Ihis competition aims to encourage
students with great ideas to enter their
school's business plan competition by pro
viding the means, venture funding, for stu
dents to follow through witfi starting a busi
ness," Raffaelli said. "This is a fantastic cat
alyst for future entrepreneurs."
What differentiates this business plan
competition from similar contests is the
large grant prize. Usually, the sponsoring
institution offers a cash prize award but the
DFJ Venture Challenge will offer its prize
in funding, meaning the winners will be ex
pected to use the money to realize their
ideas.
"Traditional business plan prizes can
have conflicting short-term incentives
where the prize money itself is the goal in
stead of the goal of starting a business," he
said. "The DFJ Venture Challenge takes a
longer-term funding approach. While this
award may not be appealing to those stu
dents going only after prize money, not sur
prisingly, there is strong desire for venture
funding from those students and faculty
who wish to pursue their business ideas be
yond their school's competition."
Tina Seelig, the executive director for
the Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram, said she feels that the DFJ Venture
Challenge and the University support will
serve budding entrepreneurs well because
they will meet important people already
working in the field.
"It's fabulous that DFJ has decided to
host this very special business plan compe
tition, which allows the winners of all the
business plan competitions in California to
learn from each other and to compete,"
Seelig said.
She added that the environment that the
competition creates is good for emerging
entrepreneurs.
"TTiis is a fabulous learning opportunity
for all the students because they get to ex
periment in a very low-risk environment
and they get the best mentors possible —
successful entrepreneurs, faculty members
with experience building ventures and ven
ture capitals," she said. "Ilie students are
learning the ropes in a very supportive en
vironment."
