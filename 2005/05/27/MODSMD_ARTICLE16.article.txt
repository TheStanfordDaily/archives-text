## Canuck Card to celebrate Queen Victoria 
### MIMA MOHAMMED CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alex Trebek is one. So are Jim Carrey,.Celine Dion
and Lome Michaels.These famous Canadians celebrat
ed Queen Victoria's birthday this past Tuesday along
with the rest of the nation. This Saturday, Stanford's
Canada Club will honor the date with an eight-hour
Canoe Party at Lyman Atrium.
"Despite the fact that Canadians look just like
Americans and speak almost exactly the same, most
Canadians feel a strong affinity to their home and na
tive land and are always glad to meet other Canadians,"
said Mike Dolphin, a graduate student in aeronautics
and astronautics and prime minister of the Canadian
Club. The group regularly organizes events to promote
Canadian culture and provides a meeting place for
Canadians on campus.
The club's Canoe Party this Saturday will be in
honor of the May 24 holiday declared a national day of
celebration by the Legislature of the
Province of Canada in 1K45. The
event will run from 4 p.m. to mid
night at Lyman Atrium and is free for
all students. It will feature, appropri
ately enough, a canoe filled with bev
erages, as well as a barbecue, games
of street hockey and traditional
Canadian songs.
After Confederation, the Queen's
birthday is celebrated every year on
May 24 unless that date is a Sunday.
After the death of Queen Victoria in
1901, an act was passed by the Cana
dian parliament establishing a legal
holiday on May 24 — or the day after
if May 24 fell on a Sunday — under
the name Victoria Day.
"The weekend also serves as a
good play on words," said Dolphin.

"In many parts of Canada, especially
in the east, beer comes in either a
case of 12 or a 'two-four,' 24. Thus,
many people call Victoria Day 'May
Two-Four,' symbolizing both the sig
nificant date and the reference to
beer."
In Canada, the May 24 weekend
normally symbolizes the coming of
summer. It often falls on the first
weekend of the year with good
weather, and Canadians take it upon
themselves to get outside for the fes
tivities. In Vancouver, the date marks
the official opening of recreational
beaches.
"Beyond a reason to party and
celebrate the coming of summer —
remember that in Canada, the days
are a lot longer in summer than they
are here, so summer is a really big
deal — Victoria Day holds little his
torical significance for most Canadi
ans," Dolphin said. "Most people do
not sing 'God Save the Queen' or
anything like that."
