Stanford's Creative Writing Program has an
nounced its 2(X)5 Stegner Fellows for fiction and
poetry. Each year, the highly competitive fellow
ship provides five poets and five fiction writers
with a stipend to spend two years at Stanford,
polishing their writing in intensive workshops,
instructing English Department classes and
working one-on-one with undergraduate stu
dents.
Ihis year, the program had roughly 1,4(K) ap
plicants from 21 countries.
"Stegner Fellows are excellent teachers, and
there is something wonderful for the students in
having young, working writers in the classroom,"
said Eavan Boland, director of the Creative
Writing Program. "It brings literature alive in a
very special) *"
While the majority of Stegner fellows have
graduated from Master of Fine Arts programs,
they have diverse backgrounds.
Admission is based purely on manuscript
submissions — roughlv y,(XX) words for fiction

writers and between 15 and 30 poems for poets
This year's entries include narrative poems,
short stories and novels.
Most poetry applicants have spent several
years polishing their work, even if they have not
participated in higher degree programs.
"They're generally not directly from under
grad degrees, though we've taken a few," said
English Prof. Kenneth Fields. "Even for those,
most of us think they'd be better off if they'd
waited."
During their time at Stanford, the fellows are
given the resources needed to concentrate fully
on writing.
"There are no real requirements that come
with the fellowship," said former Stegner Fellow
Stephen Elliott,currently a fiction writing lectur
er. "But the presumption is that they will write
full-time."
"There's no downside to it,"he added. "It's
not the kind of thing to turn down."
After two years at Stanford, many fellows go
on to teach elsewhere. Fields, who has taught the
Stegner poetry workshops for almost
40 years, explained that while it is dif
ficult to make money as a fiction
writer, even fewer poets manage to be
self-sufficient outside of academia.
"It's not as though it's easy to pub
lish a novel." Fields said. "Many of the
poets go on to teach, since there's less
money in poetry."
Boland said the Creative Writing
Program is very proud of the Stegner
fellows' achievements, both past and
present.
"But we are equally proud when
they are working slowly, reflectively
with perhaps a book that will only
show up five or ten years later," she
said.
ITie Stegner Fellowship, Boland
added, is an attempt to give writers a
leg up in a difficult profession.
" ITie writing life is never pre
dictable," she said. "We just want to
take some of the uncertainty away and
put the odds a little more in their
favor."
