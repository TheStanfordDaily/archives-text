## Season finales: A game of Survivor 
### 
It's that time of year again when our beloved
television shows wrap up the year with fast-paced,
action-filled season finales — and we all know
what that means: a whole lot of people are about
to die.
Ending the season with a bang — sometimes
literally — has now become an age-old formula
for television producers, and with good reason.
How do television producers and writers gen
erate hype and excitement for the coming season?
Promise something "unexpected" and "unbeliev
able." What do they do that viewers would never
expect or believe? Kill someone. Or abduct a
baby.

Some may be fatally wound
ed or in comas or. worse yet,
pregnant, but you can pretty
much rest assured that someone
on your favorite TV show is
about to be killed, eaten,
drowned or some combination
of the above.
I used to think this formula
applied only to the heavy dra
mas or action / adventures, but

even the teen soap operas are beginning to suc
cumb to the norm.
Someone was killed on "The 0.C.," although
this doesn't surprise me much.Trey had to leave the
show one way or another. I personally thought
Marissa would be the one to get shot just because
she really got abused this season (alcoholism, at
tempted rape, bruises, head wound from club
shooting, etc.) and so one more bullet probably
wouldn't have made a big difference.
As for "One Tree Hill," no one actually died,
but writers made up for it with child abductions,
Dan trying to deport Karen's boyfriend to Aus
tralia, Karen throwing a chair through Dan's of
fice window, Peyton finding out the woman hitting
on her is actually her mom and Haley filing for di
vorce from Nathan.
On a side note, I can handle the stealing of the
babies and the deportations and even the slutty
stalker woman turning out to be Peyton's mom —
but the divorce? I can't believe Haley and Nathan
are quitting after barely a year of marriage. Just
because she's trying to pursue some kind of
singing career and they're still in high school does
n't mean anything. You could have at least made it
through sophomore year. guys.
What surprised me the most, though, was that
even "Gilmore Girls" got intense. While other
shows deal with abductions, rapes, high school
pregnancy scares and fatal car accidents, the
biggest drama on "Gilmore Girls" is whether or
not Rory got into Yale or whether Logan will get
along with Rory's mom. In a rare move for the
WB, there are no sudden illegitimate children. But
this season the network stepped it up a notch and
ended with Rory not going back to Yale and mov
ing in with her grandparents.That's about as close
to killing someone as it gets on "Gilmore Girls."
Now, I haven't seen a lot of season finales yet (1
plan to catch up this weekend), but if even WB
shows are resorting to killing off people for sea
son finales, I can only imagine what the real drama
/ action show finales will be like.
I haven't seen the "Lost" season finale yet. but
with the commercials showing the castaways
going out on a raft in an attempt to escape the is
land, someone is bound to get eaten. Probably by
the monster, but I wouldn't put it past John Locke
to eat that little kid with the dog. They're just ask
ing for it. I hope nothing happens to Clare's baby,
though. I can't handle more than one baby abduc
tion this season.
As for "Alias" —I don't know. I stopped
watching it after that clone killed Marcy.That was
so unrealistic.
Perhaps even the reality shows will jump on
the bandwagon and. say. kill the winner of the con
test. I would certainly watch American Idol more
often if each week the contestants faced not elim
ination but death. It would be a nice throwback to
gladiatorial fights. Very retro, don't you think'.'
But until television reaches that point, let's
enjoy the huge cliffhangers and mourn the losses
of those expendable characters. Hopelully, our
beloved characters will be able to make it through
another season alive.

If you wish the makers of "The O.C. "had killed off
that stupid Marissa along with Trey, e-mail Shivani
