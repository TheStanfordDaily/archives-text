# Stanford's Romanczuk, Gilmore took different routes to starring roles
## Card's two aces from different decks 
### SEAN HOWELL JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
At the start of their first practice as Stanford
baseball players, juniors Jeff Gilmore and Mark
Romanczuk picked up their gloves and a ball and
began to play catch together. Romanczuk was a
highly regarded lefthanded recruit from Delaware
who had been selected in the fifth round of the
MLB draft. Gilmore, a native of Huntington
Beach, Calif., was a righthander overshadowed by

the high expectations swirling around his other
classmates.
Three years later, Gilmore and Romanczuk
have ascended to the top two spots in the Cardinal
rotation. Their paths to success look nothing alike
— a power pitcher, Romanczuk rode the bullet
train to a starting role, while the craftier Gilmore
arrived more quietly. But somehow they both
landed in the same place, with complementing
reputations for reliability and leadership.
Today, when the Cardinal warm up at practice.

Gilmore and Romanczuk still play catch together.

Romanczuk started his Cardinal career with a
bang. He went 12-2 with a 4.01 earned-run aver
age in his rookie season. The performance earned
him one of four National Freshman of the Year
honors.
He started the season in relief, posting three
wins and two saves, and was moved into the start-

ing rotation early in the year. The
first Pacific-10 Conference start of
his career was a sign of things to
come: Romanczuk took the ball
against Arizona State and spun a
complete game, allowing only two
earned runs and picking up a win in
a crucial rubber game.
When Romanczuk won the first
12 decisions of his career, it was
hard to tell that he wasn't a veteran.
"In terms of poise, Mark is
advanced for his age and as good as
anybody we've had at this stage in
his career," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said at the time.
Romanczuk's dream season
ended on a sour note, when he
started and lost the final game of
the College World Series to Rice. It
was the shortest outing of his
career, a one-inning stint in which
he allowed four runs. The start left
a bad taste in Romanczuk's mouth,
but he didn't have time to think
about it. Within days after the sea
son ended, Romanczuk was on a
plane to play for Team USA. He
had a stellar summer, allowing only
three earned runs in 36 innings for
the 27-2 Americans.
❖ ❖
Gilmore watched his southpaw
teammate's startling breakout
year — and just about every other
play of the 2(X)3 season — from
the dugout. Gilmore made only
three appearances in his freshman
year for a grand total of 2 1/3
innings. He went to Alaska to play
summer baseball with the frustra
tion of an uneventful year on his
shoulders.
Alaska, as it turned out, was the
place where Gilmore began to
transform as a pitcher. In May
2(X)3, Gilmore met former Cardinal
and current New York Yankees
pitcher Mike Mussina, who impart
ed some wisdom on how to throw
his signature knuckle curveball.
Gilmore consumed the advice and
began to toss the pitch during his
summer outings.
"It brought out a new part of me
and that's a strikeout pitch,"
Gilmore said. "On a two-strike
count from sophomore year on, I
had an option. Before I had to fool
the hitter, I had to trick them."
By the end of the summer,
Gilmore had a 1.41 ERA in 32
innings of work for the Mat-Su
Miners. Romanczuk, who was jet
setting with Team USA at the time,
was the least surprised person in
the world.
"Mark called me one day,"
Gilmore remembered. "And he
said i looked at your numbers,
you're throwing great in Alaska. I
knew you could do it, keep it up.
When you come back, you're going
to be one of our guys.' "
Gilmore added: "We're very dif
ferent pitchers but we can learn
from each other because of that."
Gilmore said the ensuing fall
was his most nerve-wracking time
as a member of the Stanford team.
"I honestly believed that I had
what it takes," Gilmore said. "But I
had a narrow window of opportu
nity to shine and prove myself in
the fall."
The coaching staff liked what
they saw in fall workouts and
Gilmore was immediately called
upon out of the bullpen in his soph
omore season. By the start of
February he had his first collegiate
start and his first collegiate win. The
righty never slowed, collecting a 10-
2 record with a 4.43 ERA.
The team's Most Improved
Player Award was a no-brainer.
❖ ♦
Romanczuk. meanwhile, carried
his stellar summer form back to the
Farm, where he blossomed into the
team's ace in 2004, going 11-3 with
a 4.31 ERA. His numbers were
nearly identical to the ones he post
ed in 2(X)3, but last year,
Romanczuk said, he learned how
to pitch.Though his freshman num
bers wouldn't indicate it, he says
that he was more of "thrower" than
a pitcher back then.
"I've learned more of the finer
points of pitching," he said. "For
example, how to change speeds on
hitters, how to pitch down in the
zone. That's been one of the keys
for me."
He is still a power pitcher, with a
low-90s heater and a devastating
slider that has helped him tally 249
Ks in his Cardinal career. But
Romanczuk has also developed a
changeup this year that he uses to
gets easy outs to keep his pitch
count down.
An economics major,
Romanczuk is more analytical than
most pitchers you'll meet. Before
most of his starts last year, he
would pore over everything he
knew about each hitter on the
opposing team and try to pitch to
their strengths and weaknesses.
But early this year, his dissec
tion of opposing lineups got him
into trouble at times. He was
reluctant to break from his game
plan when things were not going
his way.
Recently, his motto has been to
simplify. Romanczuk lost his Friday
night starting spot after allowing
nine runs in seven innings in a start
against Arizona State on April 15.
Since that start, Romanczuk says.

he has thought about what he
needs to do to get hitters out, not
what he could do to make them get
themselves out.
"In my last couple starts, I
haven't focused so much on hitters'
weaknesses as I have on my
strengths," he said. "I just learned,
'Hey, if I put my best foot forward,
I'm going to get guys out, no matter
what their strengths or weaknesses
are.' That's given me a lot more
confidence in my stuff. I'm trying to
go with the flow and make adjust
ments whenever I need to."
Romanczuk works with pitch
ing coach Tom Kunis during his
mid-week bullpen session, and
they come up with a loose game
plan for Romanczuk to follow in
his weekend start. In some ways, he
is going back to what made him
successful during his freshman
year, worrying less about the intri
cacies of pitching and letting his
competitiveness guide him. Since
the Arizona State game, he has
allowed two runs or less in four of
his five starts and tossed his third
complete game this season.
While Romanczuk has contin
ued to refine his raw talent,
Gilmore continued to uncover
pieces of his. After a phenomenal
sophomore season, he went back
to Alaska. This time, after learning
that his pitching coach would be
Jack Krawczyk, who holds NCAA
single-season and career saves
records, Gilmore asked Krawczyk
to show him his circle change-up.
The grip required for the
change-up is, in Gilmore's words,
awkward, and difficult to master
— Gilmore only got the pitch
working at the end of fall prac
tices this year. Now, the change,
which is more deceptive and more
versatile than the one Gilmore
used previously, is the most effec
tive pitch in his arsenal.
Armed with the enhanced pitch
options, Gilmore settled into his
Saturday starting role like he'd
never known the bench, and is cur
rently 9-2 (the best record on the
staff), with a 3.61 ERA (the best
among Stanford starters) and two
complete games.
Gilmore moved into the Friday
starting role for four weeks, though
the junior downplays the shift.
"You can't think about what
pitcher you're facing," Gilmore
said. "You'll just psych yourself out
that way. I have to think that I'm
facing USC's lineup, and our hitters
are facing USC's pitchers, and
they're going to do their best. And
if I can keep it close, I'll take my
chances with that."
This weekend, Romanczuk will
reclaim his familiar role as the
team's Friday night starter. But for
all intents and purposes, the team
has two aces.
"The staff has the confidence that
both of those guys can get the job
done any day," sophomore reliever
Blake Holler said. "Gilly's gonna get
guys to get themselves out, while
Mark's a bulldog and he'll go after
[hitters] and make them beat him.
We feel so comfortable with them
out there, knowing that they're going
to give as quality starts,"
Despite the obvious differences
in pitching style, Romanczuk and
Gilmore are very similar in their
approach to the game — both are
cerebral pitchers with unique tal
ents for seeing things on the field
that others might overlook. But
because their experiences have dif
fered so greatly, they bring very dis
tinct leadership dynamics to the
Cardinal pitching staff.
"I guess if anyone's more of the
vocal leader, it's probably me,"
Romanczuk said. "Gilly's more of
the quiet, reserved guy who leads
by example. The great thing is that
we kind of complement each other
in that way."
Gilmore added that their con
trasting experiences and
strengths appeal to different
members of the staff, allowing the
pair to support the pitching corps
more successfully than either
could on his own.
"Mark has an understanding of
people, namely our coaches, better
than anyone on the team and that's
the area in which he excels,"
Gilmore said. "He can talk to the
guys about those things. For me,
I'm more of a mentor to the guys
who aren't pitching. I can relate to
that because I've been there and I
know what it takes."
Romanczuk and Gilmore have
come a long way during their three
years at Stanford, both together
and apart. The pair will likely split
up after this season — Romanczuk
is virtually guaranteed to be draft
ed in the first few rounds, and
Gilmore is a good bet to leave as
well. They will leave big shoes to fill
in the Cardinal rotation, both in
terms of their pitching ability and
their leadership styles.
Before they go, Romanczuk and
Gilmore will have one last crack at
the College World Series, assuming
the Cardinal make the playoffs. In
the postseason, it can never hurt to
have two aces in your deck.

ferent styles.

rently 9-2 (the best record on the
staff), with a 3.61 ERA (the best
among Stanford starters) and two
complete games.
Gilmore moved into the Friday
starting role for four weeks, though
the junior downplays the shift.
"You can't think about what
pitcher you're facing," Gilmore
said. "You'll just psych yourself out
that way. I have to think that I'm
facing USC's lineup, and our hitters
are facing USC's pitchers, and
they're going to do their best. And
if I can keep it close, I'll take my
chances with that."
This weekend, Romanczuk will
reclaim his familiar role as the
team's Friday night starter. But for
all intents and purposes, the team
has two aces.
"The staff has the confidence that
both of those guys can get the job
done any day," sophomore reliever
Blake Holler said. "Gilly's gonna get
guys to get themselves out, while
Mark's a bulldog and he'll go after
[hitters] and make them beat him.
We feel so comfortable with them
out there, knowing that they're going
to give as quality starts,"
Despite the obvious differences
in pitching style, Romanczuk and
Gilmore are very similar in their
approach to the game — both are
cerebral pitchers with unique tal
ents for seeing things on the field
that others might overlook. But
because their experiences have dif
fered so greatly, they bring very dis
tinct leadership dynamics to the
Cardinal pitching staff.
"I guess if anyone's more of the
vocal leader, it's probably me,"
Romanczuk said. "Gilly's more of
the quiet, reserved guy who leads
by example. The great thing is that
we kind of complement each other
in that way."
Gilmore added that their con
trasting experiences and
strengths appeal to different
members of the staff, allowing the
pair to support the pitching corps
more successfully than either
could on his own.
"Mark has an understanding of
people, namely our coaches, better
than anyone on the team and that's
the area in which he excels,"
Gilmore said. "He can talk to the
guys about those things. For me,
I'm more of a mentor to the guys
who aren't pitching. I can relate to
that because I've been there and I
know what it takes."
Romanczuk and Gilmore have
come a long way during their three
years at Stanford, both together
and apart. The pair will likely split
up after this season — Romanczuk
is virtually guaranteed to be draft
ed in the first few rounds, and
Gilmore is a good bet to leave as
well. They will leave big shoes to fill
in the Cardinal rotation, both in
terms of their pitching ability and
their leadership styles.
Before they go, Romanczuk and
Gilmore will have one last crack at
the College World Series, assuming
the Cardinal make the playoffs. In
the postseason, it can never hurt to
have two aces in your deck.
Especially when they have such dif
ferent styles.
At the start of their first practice as Stanford
baseball players, juniors Jeff Gilmore and Mark
Romanczuk picked up their gloves and a ball and
began to play catch together. Romanczuk was a
highly regarded lefthanded recruit from Delaware
who had been selected in the fifth round of the
MLB draft. Gilmore, a native of Huntington
Beach, Calif., was a righthander overshadowed by

the high expectations swirling around his other
classmates.
Three years later, Gilmore and Romanczuk
have ascended to the top two spots in the Cardinal
rotation. Their paths to success look nothing alike
— a power pitcher, Romanczuk rode the bullet
train to a starting role, while the craftier Gilmore
arrived more quietly. But somehow they both
landed in the same place, with complementing
reputations for reliability and leadership.
Today, when the Cardinal warm up at practice.

Gilmore and Romanczuk still play catch together.

Romanczuk started his Cardinal career with a
bang. He went 12-2 with a 4.01 earned-run aver

him one of four National Freshman of the Year
honors.

ing rotation early in the year. The
first Pacific-10 Conference start of
his career was a sign of things to
come: Romanczuk took the ball
against Arizona State and spun a
complete game, allowing only two
earned runs and picking up a win in
a crucial rubber game.
When Romanczuk won the first
12 decisions of his career, it was
hard to tell that he wasn't a veteran.
"In terms of poise, Mark is
advanced for his age and as good as
anybody we've had at this stage in
his career," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said at the time.
Romanczuk's dream season
ended on a sour note, when he
started and lost the final game of
the College World Series to Rice. It
was the shortest outing of his
career, a one-inning stint in which
he allowed four runs. The start left
a bad taste in Romanczuk's mouth,
but he didn't have time to think
about it. Within days after the sea
son ended, Romanczuk was on a
plane to play for Team USA. He
had a stellar summer, allowing only
three earned runs in 36 innings for
the 27-2 Americans.
❖ ❖
Gilmore watched his southpaw
teammate's startling breakout
year — and just about every other
play of the 2(X)3 season — from
the dugout. Gilmore made only
three appearances in his freshman
year for a grand total of 2 1/3
innings. He went to Alaska to play
summer baseball with the frustra
tion of an uneventful year on his
shoulders.
Alaska, as it turned out, was the
place where Gilmore began to
transform as a pitcher. In May
2(X)3, Gilmore met former Cardinal
and current New York Yankees
pitcher Mike Mussina, who impart
ed some wisdom on how to throw
his signature knuckle curveball.
Gilmore consumed the advice and
began to toss the pitch during his
summer outings.
"It brought out a new part of me
and that's a strikeout pitch,"
Gilmore said. "On a two-strike
count from sophomore year on, I
had an option. Before I had to fool
the hitter, I had to trick them."
By the end of the summer,
Gilmore had a 1.41 ERA in 32
innings of work for the Mat-Su
Miners. Romanczuk, who was jet
setting with Team USA at the time,
was the least surprised person in
the world.
"Mark called me one day,"
Gilmore remembered. "And he
said i looked at your numbers,
you're throwing great in Alaska. I
knew you could do it, keep it up.
When you come back, you're going
to be one of our guys.' "
Gilmore added: "We're very dif
ferent pitchers but we can learn
from each other because of that."
Gilmore said the ensuing fall
was his most nerve-wracking time
as a member of the Stanford team.
"I honestly believed that I had
what it takes," Gilmore said. "But I
had a narrow window of opportu
nity to shine and prove myself in
the fall."
The coaching staff liked what
they saw in fall workouts and
Gilmore was immediately called
upon out of the bullpen in his soph
omore season. By the start of
February he had his first collegiate
start and his first collegiate win. The
righty never slowed, collecting a 10-
2 record with a 4.43 ERA.
The team's Most Improved
Player Award was a no-brainer.
❖ ♦
Romanczuk. meanwhile, carried
his stellar summer form back to the
Farm, where he blossomed into the
team's ace in 2004, going 11-3 with
a 4.31 ERA. His numbers were
nearly identical to the ones he post
ed in 2(X)3, but last year,
Romanczuk said, he learned how
to pitch.Though his freshman num
bers wouldn't indicate it, he says
that he was more of "thrower" than
a pitcher back then.
"I've learned more of the finer
points of pitching," he said. "For
example, how to change speeds on
hitters, how to pitch down in the
zone. That's been one of the keys
for me."
He is still a power pitcher, with a
low-90s heater and a devastating
slider that has helped him tally 249
Ks in his Cardinal career. But
Romanczuk has also developed a
changeup this year that he uses to
gets easy outs to keep his pitch
count down.
An economics major,
Romanczuk is more analytical than
most pitchers you'll meet. Before
most of his starts last year, he
would pore over everything he
knew about each hitter on the
opposing team and try to pitch to
their strengths and weaknesses.
But early this year, his dissec
tion of opposing lineups got him
into trouble at times. He was
reluctant to break from his game
plan when things were not going
his way.
Recently, his motto has been to
simplify. Romanczuk lost his Friday
night starting spot after allowing
nine runs in seven innings in a start
against Arizona State on April 15.
Since that start, Romanczuk says.

he has thought about what he
needs to do to get hitters out, not
what he could do to make them get
themselves out.
"In my last couple starts, I
haven't focused so much on hitters'
weaknesses as I have on my
strengths," he said. "I just learned,
'Hey, if I put my best foot forward,
I'm going to get guys out, no matter
what their strengths or weaknesses
are.' That's given me a lot more
confidence in my stuff. I'm trying to
go with the flow and make adjust
ments whenever I need to."
Romanczuk works with pitch
ing coach Tom Kunis during his
mid-week bullpen session, and
they come up with a loose game
plan for Romanczuk to follow in
his weekend start. In some ways, he
is going back to what made him
successful during his freshman
year, worrying less about the intri
cacies of pitching and letting his
competitiveness guide him. Since
the Arizona State game, he has
allowed two runs or less in four of
his five starts and tossed his third
complete game this season.
While Romanczuk has contin
ued to refine his raw talent,
Gilmore continued to uncover
pieces of his. After a phenomenal
sophomore season, he went back
to Alaska. This time, after learning
that his pitching coach would be
Jack Krawczyk, who holds NCAA
single-season and career saves
records, Gilmore asked Krawczyk
to show him his circle change-up.
The grip required for the
change-up is, in Gilmore's words,
awkward, and difficult to master
— Gilmore only got the pitch
working at the end of fall prac
tices this year. Now, the change,
which is more deceptive and more
versatile than the one Gilmore
used previously, is the most effec
tive pitch in his arsenal.
Armed with the enhanced pitch
options, Gilmore settled into his
Saturday starting role like he'd
never known the bench, and is cur
rently 9-2 (the best record on the
staff), with a 3.61 ERA (the best
among Stanford starters) and two

zone. That's been one of the keys
for me."
He is still a power pitcher, with a
low-90s heater and a devastating
slider that has helped him tally 249
Ks in his Cardinal career. But
Romanczuk has also developed a
changeup this year that he uses to
gets easy outs to keep his pitch
count down.
An economics major,
Romanczuk is more analytical than
most pitchers you'll meet. Before
most of his starts last year, he
would pore over everything he
knew about each hitter on the
opposing team and try to pitch to
their strengths and weaknesses.
But early this year, his dissec
tion of opposing lineups got him
into trouble at times. He was
reluctant to break from his game
plan when things were not going
his way.
Recently, his motto has been to
simplify. Romanczuk lost his Friday
night starting spot after allowing
nine runs in seven innings in a start
against Arizona State on April 15.
Since that start, Romanczuk says.

he has thought about what he
needs to do to get hitters out, not
what he could do to make them get
themselves out.
"In my last couple starts, I
haven't focused so much on hitters'
weaknesses as I have on my
strengths," he said. "I just learned,
'Hey, if I put my best foot forward,
I'm going to get guys out, no matter
what their strengths or weaknesses
are.' That's given me a lot more
confidence in my stuff. I'm trying to
go with the flow and make adjust
ments whenever I need to."
Romanczuk works with pitch
ing coach Tom Kunis during his
mid-week bullpen session, and
they come up with a loose game
plan for Romanczuk to follow in
his weekend start. In some ways, he
is going back to what made him
successful during his freshman
year, worrying less about the intri
cacies of pitching and letting his
competitiveness guide him. Since
the Arizona State game, he has
allowed two runs or less in four of
his five starts and tossed his third
complete game this season.
While Romanczuk has contin
ued to refine his raw talent,
Gilmore continued to uncover
pieces of his. After a phenomenal
sophomore season, he went back
to Alaska. This time, after learning
that his pitching coach would be
Jack Krawczyk, who holds NCAA
single-season and career saves
records, Gilmore asked Krawczyk
to show him his circle change-up.
The grip required for the
change-up is, in Gilmore's words,
awkward, and difficult to master
— Gilmore only got the pitch
working at the end of fall prac
tices this year. Now, the change,
which is more deceptive and more
versatile than the one Gilmore
used previously, is the most effec
tive pitch in his arsenal.
Armed with the enhanced pitch
options, Gilmore settled into his
Saturday starting role like he'd
never known the bench, and is cur
rently 9-2 (the best record on the
staff), with a 3.61 ERA (the best
among Stanford starters) and two
complete games.
Gilmore moved into the Friday
starting role for four weeks, though
the junior downplays the shift.
"You can't think about what
pitcher you're facing," Gilmore
said. "You'll just psych yourself out
that way. I have to think that I'm
facing USC's lineup, and our hitters
are facing USC's pitchers, and
they're going to do their best. And
if I can keep it close, I'll take my
chances with that."
This weekend, Romanczuk will
reclaim his familiar role as the
team's Friday night starter. But for
all intents and purposes, the team
has two aces.
"The staff has the confidence that
both of those guys can get the job
done any day," sophomore reliever
Blake Holler said. "Gilly's gonna get
guys to get themselves out, while
Mark's a bulldog and he'll go after
[hitters] and make them beat him.
We feel so comfortable with them
out there, knowing that they're going
to give as quality starts,"
Despite the obvious differences
in pitching style, Romanczuk and
Gilmore are very similar in their
approach to the game — both are
cerebral pitchers with unique tal
ents for seeing things on the field
that others might overlook. But
because their experiences have dif
fered so greatly, they bring very dis
tinct leadership dynamics to the
Cardinal pitching staff.
"I guess if anyone's more of the
vocal leader, it's probably me,"
Romanczuk said. "Gilly's more of
the quiet, reserved guy who leads
by example. The great thing is that
we kind of complement each other
in that way."
Gilmore added that their con
trasting experiences and
strengths appeal to different
members of the staff, allowing the
pair to support the pitching corps
more successfully than either
could on his own.
"Mark has an understanding of
people, namely our coaches, better
than anyone on the team and that's
the area in which he excels,"
Gilmore said. "He can talk to the
guys about those things. For me,
I'm more of a mentor to the guys
who aren't pitching. I can relate to
that because I've been there and I
know what it takes."
Romanczuk and Gilmore have
come a long way during their three
years at Stanford, both together
and apart. The pair will likely split
up after this season — Romanczuk
is virtually guaranteed to be draft
ed in the first few rounds, and
Gilmore is a good bet to leave as
well. They will leave big shoes to fill
in the Cardinal rotation, both in
terms of their pitching ability and
their leadership styles.
Before they go, Romanczuk and
Gilmore will have one last crack at
the College World Series, assuming
the Cardinal make the playoffs. In
the postseason, it can never hurt to
have two aces in your deck.
Especially when they have such dif
ferent styles.
