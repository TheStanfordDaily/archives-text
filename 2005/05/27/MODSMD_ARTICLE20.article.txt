# Rocking out, Stanford style
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Senior Mikey Lee came up with the name
for his rock band in what he referred to as a
"very Stanford way" — from his reading as
signment for "Introduction to Perception."
"The cells in the middle of the eye are
called midget cells, and they are arranged in a
mosaic," said Lee. "The textbook referred to
this as a midget cell mosaic. I thought that
would be a great band name. We decided to
take out the 'cell' and we ended up with our
name."
Lee, the lead singer and guitarist for
Midget Mosaic, is one of several aspiring rock
stars on campus. Lee and his band mates
formed Midget Mosaic right before the begin
ning of their sophomore year.
"Andy Szybalski. the band's keyboard
player, and I roomed together during Sopho
more College," explained Lee. "We played to
gether at the CoHo a few times, but we want
ed to sound more rock-ish."
Lee and Szybalski met fellow band mem
ber Kennv McCaffrey, the bassist, after a cam

pus frat party.
"We heard a group of random people
drunkenlv singing Disney songs, so we decid
ed to join in." Lee said." We then began to sing
the Cake version of i Will Survive.' and Kenny
sang the bass line. We needed a bassist so we
got Kenny on board."
Lee met his fourth band member. Chris
Bravman. at Sigma Nu rush. The fifth band
member. Alex Van Derbroeke. was someone
Szybalski knew from high school.
Half of the band's songs are covers of older
songs and half are originals.
"We mostly play at Stanford — at campus
parties,at Battle of the Bands, at the Art Affair
and at other various venues," Lee said. "We
have played off campus a few times, mostly at
friends' houses, house parties and bars."
According to Lee. one of the hardest things
about having a bandon campus is finding ven
ues and times that work for everyone.
"Most of the time, all of our weekdays are
full so we can't get together until the week
end." Lee said."But on the weekends, there is
usually either an overflow of bands or a short
age of venues."

According to junior David Baron, the lead
singer and pianist for The Spin's Band, bands
have increased in number and popularity
since he came to Stanford.
"When we started, the music scene wasn't
really happening on campus," said Baron.
"There were just a few bands who completely
dominated the scene, but now everything has
changed. A lot of great bands, such as T\vo
Mikes From Jersey, Red Line and Dopamine,
have sprung up over the past three years."
Lee said that while there are a lot of bands
on campus, he finds that there is not a lot of va
riety in genre.
"You get a lot of John Mayer / Jason Mraz
types on campus that annoy the hell out of
me," he said."lt's nice to have a little sad,emo,
crying-in-the-corner music some times, but
you also need some metal and rock."
Baron, along with junior Ben Grant, the
drummer, and junior Gabe DaviSs the bassist,
started The Spin's Band in the very beginning
of their freshman year.
"Gabe and I first met because we lived in
the same freshman dorm," Baron said. "We
played a few shows together, but it was a bit
odd because it was just piano and bass."
The two met Grant through a jazz combo.
"From the first note of the first show that
we all played together, we knew that we had
something good," Baron said.
Baron said that he and his bandmates had
a lot of difficulty thinking of the band name.
"Our name has changed a lot over the past
three years," he said. "We finally decided on
The Spins, but that was already taken by a
band in Europe. To avoid copyright issues, we
added the word 'band' onto the end."
The Spin's Band began by playing in vari
ous venues on campus, such as fraternity par
ties and the CoHo. The band members won
the Battle of the Bands in 2003 and 2004.
"It was really exciting to be named the best
band on campus in our freshman year," Baron
said. "This year they asked us not to compete,
so we kind of hosted the event."
The band is now stepping out of the Stan
ford scene and into other venues.
"We started opening for a lot of different
groups, and just this year, we began headlining
in various clubs in San Francisco," Baron said.
"This summer we plan to live in San Francisco
to further enter the music scene."

They have also made the transformation
from a band that plays primarily covers to
playing mostly their own music.
"We have a little under 15 original songs,"
Baron said. "I write all of the songs, but Ben
and Grant turn it into their own style. The
songs are good because of the guys in the
band."
The band members, however,say that hav
ing a band while in college can be very time
consuming.
"We practice four days a week," Baron
said. "My whole life is this band."
Baron said that sometimes the band has up
to three gigs a week, whereas other times they
go for weeks without any gigs.
"Rehearsing is the main obstacle of keep
ing a band on campus," Grant said. "The two
challenges of practicing are negotiating every
band member's busy schedule, then finding a
place that's available at a time you can all
meet. It's really challenging, especially at the
busy times of the quarter."
Grant also said that Stanford's bureaucra
cy can create problems for keeping a band to
gether.
"We've found Stanford both a supportive
and a frustrating place to have a rock band,"
he said. "Our friends have been great and
have loyally come to most of our shows, but
there's little help from the bureaucracy with
the basic logistical needs of a small rock
group."
Both Lee and Baron agree that the sup
port of friends and fans has been crucial to
their bands' successes. Support from big shots
in the music industry, however, doesn't hurt.
"Lee Abrams. the chief programming offi
cer of XM radio, is a big supporter of The
Spin's Band," Baron said."He's a huge indus
try guy, so it's exciting that he liked the band."
Midget Mosaic has the support of singer /
songwriter Ben Kweller, Lee said.
"We did a cover of one of his songs and we
had a chance to meet him and play it for him,"
said Lee. "He loved the band and he referred
to us as 'the best band in the land."'
Both bands plan to stay together after
graduation.
"Our years at Stanford have provided us
with the time to build our sound, and by the
end of next year, when we graduate, we'll feel
ready to take it anywhere," Grant said.
