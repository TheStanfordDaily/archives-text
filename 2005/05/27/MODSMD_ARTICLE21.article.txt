# Foothills restored to former glory
## 
### KRISTIN COHOON 
Two hundred years ago, before the high-tech giants es
tablished themselves in Silicon Valley and the University
was just starting out, the Stanford property was an area of
foothills, grasslands, oak savanna and seasonal wetlands. In
the second half of the 19th century, the rise of cattle and
horse ranching and residential development caused the en
vironment to undergo drastic changes, according to the
Center for Conservation Biology. Water was collected into
lakes and reservoirs, and areas remained either submerged
or dry year-round rather than undergoing constant shifts in
saturation.
In 2001, restoration ecologist Sean Anderson was re
cruited to organize the Stanford Foothills Restoration
team,created due to pressure by the Stanford community to
restore the land that once teemed with biodiversity. People
didn't think the University took environmental issues, ex
plained Anderson, so the University action.
"Few people believed the administration, so they decid
ed to put up some major money to show that they were in
deed serious about preserving the foothills and doing what
they could to restore some of the ecological functioning that
had been lost," said Anderson. »
The salamanders, frogs and other amphibians that thrived
in the safety of the wetlands were exposed to new resident
species, making many plants and animals that used to be
common rare or endangered.
Most of the plant species found in the foothills today,
where many people hike the popular Dish trail.are invasive,
non-native species introduced by the Europeans. Deer,elk,
bobcats and grizzly bears are of the past. The sporadic
mountain lion sightings are regarded as an unwelcome nov
elty.
The team has taken a novel approach to the restoration.
Rather than treating the entire 50 acres of the Dish area at
once, they take smaller areas of land and test several inter
ventions. Observing the effects of these test options enables
the researchers to try a few variants of the most successful
approach, and so forth.
"It takes much longer, but produces a much more biolog

ically successful restoration and
yields essential data to know why some
thing worked or didn't work," said Andersort of this ap-.
proach, which he called "phased, experimental restoration* 1
Those who spend time on the recreation paths in the
foothills near the Dish may have noticed blue tarps along
the pathways last winter. The tarps were part of drainage
and "yellow sea" restoration, the latter of which refers to the
reduction of the yellow mustard plants in favor of reviving
native grasses. Despite setbacks from vandalism and logis
tic problems, tarping has now been shown to be an effective
strategy for suppressing non-native species.
"We found that even sub-optimal tarping benefits any
remnant native bunch grasses," Anderson said. "In areas
where we used no tarps the few native plant survivors are
small and sparse. In areas where we tarped thinly, the na
tives are large, robust, and excluding the [non-native
species]."
The wetlands restoration went into effect in August 2003.
The plan proceeded in several stages. First, more than 12,000
native plants were removed from the test plots so that the non
native vegetation — mostly weeds — could be razed, leaving
the area open for new growth. Then the topography was
shaped so that creeks were wider and shallower. Half-buried
logs and other structural additions create places for small ani
mals to live. Finally the area was planted with native grass
seeds and the 12,(XX) plants were replaced.
Anderson considers the wetlands component of the
restoration particularly successful.
"We have abundant amphibian, insect, spider, crus
tacean and plant species," he said. "Bobcats and coyotes fre
quent the areas. We have a previously unobserved species of
clam shrimp in some of the ponds."
The wetlands restoration effort at Stanford is one of the
few in the area. In California,and in the Bay Area specifical
ly, the amount of habitat lost is staggering. Wetlands have
undergone a 95 percent decrease in area since the early 19th
century, followed by decrease of 71 percent of oak wood
lands and almost as much grassland in the Bay Area alone.
The natural areas that still exist are often in an unhealthy
state.
"It is imperative that we figure out how to recover these
communities that are going away at a rapid rate," Anderson

said-
Hw task is not straightforward.
There is a scarcity of documented research on
ecological restorations, and long-term monitoring is
Very rare.This may be due at least in part to the abundance
of private contractors who are involved in restorations. An
derson said he believes that they don't have the money or
time to devote to scientific comparisons, and failures often
go unreported, making it more likely that those efforts will
be repeated in vain by other groups
Anderson said he hopes the project will act as a model
for other areas.
"Tune is running out to recover many of these ailing sys
tems" Anderson said. "The foothills are my outdoor labora
tory. And as all of our efforts here are voluntary, we have the
luxury of taking our time and learning from our successes
and failures alike. After all, Einstein said that if we knew
what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research."
The future of Stanford's restoration programs is as yet
unknown. The University is not funding any more of the
Committee's plans, although Anderson praises the abun
dant funding that was provided for the completed proj
ects. Anderson is leaving to further his ecological restora
tion efforts at Cal State Channel Islands, where he will be
a professor in the Environmental Science and Resource
Management program. He plans to return to Stanford pe
riodically to see how the renovated areas are functioning.
However, support for the foothill restoration remains Bi
ology Profs. Paul Ehrlich, Anderson's post-doctorate advisor,
and Hal Mooney, as well as campus biologist Alan Launer
were instrumental in urging Stanford to focus on land conser
vation. Undergraduates facility Operations staff, full-time
technicians and professors and students from various other
departments have devoted time and effort to the project.
Anderson said he believes working on this project will
prove to be valuable to those who are interested in environ
mental management.
"It seems that so often here at Stanford students are
told they are great and what they are doing is just fabu
lous," Anderson said. "Working on this project in the 'real'
world has really helped to open their eyes to the impor
tance of risking failure and learning from what doesn't
work the first time."

deed serious about preserving the foothills and doing what
they could to restore some of the ecological functioning that
had been lost," said Anderson. »
The salamanders, frogs and other amphibians that thrived
in the safety of the wetlands were exposed to new resident
species, making many plants and animals that used to be
common rare or endangered.
Most of the plant species found in the foothills today,
where many people hike the popular Dish trail.are invasive,
non-native species introduced by the Europeans. Deer,elk,
bobcats and grizzly bears are of the past. The sporadic
mountain lion sightings are regarded as an unwelcome nov
elty.
The team has taken a novel approach to the restoration.
Rather than treating the entire 50 acres of the Dish area at
once, they take smaller areas of land and test several inter
ventions. Observing the effects of these test options enables
the researchers to try a few variants of the most successful
approach, and so forth.
"It takes much longer, but produces a much more biolog

ically successful restoration and
yields essential data to know why some
thing worked or didn't work," said Andersort of this ap-.
proach, which he called "phased, experimental restoration* 1
Those who spend time on the recreation paths in the
foothills near the Dish may have noticed blue tarps along
the pathways last winter. The tarps were part of drainage
and "yellow sea" restoration, the latter of which refers to the
reduction of the yellow mustard plants in favor of reviving
native grasses. Despite setbacks from vandalism and logis
tic problems, tarping has now been shown to be an effective
strategy for suppressing non-native species.
"We found that even sub-optimal tarping benefits any
remnant native bunch grasses," Anderson said. "In areas
where we used no tarps the few native plant survivors are
small and sparse. In areas where we tarped thinly, the na
tives are large, robust, and excluding the [non-native
species]."
The wetlands restoration went into effect in August 2003.
The plan proceeded in several stages. First, more than 12,000
native plants were removed from the test plots so that the non
native vegetation — mostly weeds — could be razed, leaving
the area open for new growth. Then the topography was
shaped so that creeks were wider and shallower. Half-buried
logs and other structural additions create places for small ani
mals to live. Finally the area was planted with native grass
seeds and the 12,(XX) plants were replaced.
Anderson considers the wetlands component of the
restoration particularly successful.
"We have abundant amphibian, insect, spider, crus
tacean and plant species," he said. "Bobcats and coyotes fre
quent the areas. We have a previously unobserved species of
clam shrimp in some of the ponds."
The wetlands restoration effort at Stanford is one of the
few in the area. In California,and in the Bay Area specifical
ly, the amount of habitat lost is staggering. Wetlands have
undergone a 95 percent decrease in area since the early 19th
century, followed by decrease of 71 percent of oak wood
lands and almost as much grassland in the Bay Area alone.
The natural areas that still exist are often in an unhealthy
state.
"It is imperative that we figure out how to recover these
communities that are going away at a rapid rate," Anderson

said-
Hw task is not straightforward.
There is a scarcity of documented research on
ecological restorations, and long-term monitoring is
Very rare.This may be due at least in part to the abundance
of private contractors who are involved in restorations. An
derson said he believes that they don't have the money or
time to devote to scientific comparisons, and failures often
go unreported, making it more likely that those efforts will
be repeated in vain by other groups
Anderson said he hopes the project will act as a model
for other areas.
"Tune is running out to recover many of these ailing sys
tems" Anderson said. "The foothills are my outdoor labora
tory. And as all of our efforts here are voluntary, we have the
luxury of taking our time and learning from our successes
and failures alike. After all, Einstein said that if we knew
what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research."
The future of Stanford's restoration programs is as yet
unknown. The University is not funding any more of the
Committee's plans, although Anderson praises the abun
dant funding that was provided for the completed proj
ects. Anderson is leaving to further his ecological restora
tion efforts at Cal State Channel Islands, where he will be
a professor in the Environmental Science and Resource
Management program. He plans to return to Stanford pe
riodically to see how the renovated areas are functioning.
However, support for the foothill restoration remains Bi
ology Profs. Paul Ehrlich, Anderson's post-doctorate advisor,
and Hal Mooney, as well as campus biologist Alan Launer
were instrumental in urging Stanford to focus on land conser
vation. Undergraduates facility Operations staff, full-time
technicians and professors and students from various other
departments have devoted time and effort to the project.
Anderson said he believes working on this project will
prove to be valuable to those who are interested in environ
mental management.
"It seems that so often here at Stanford students are
told they are great and what they are doing is just fabu
lous," Anderson said. "Working on this project in the 'real'
world has really helped to open their eyes to the impor
tance of risking failure and learning from what doesn't
work the first time."
