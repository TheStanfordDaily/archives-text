## Editorial Univ. should provide statistics, studies to review alcohol policy 
### 
ITie Daily recently published an un
usually flattering piece about the Univer
sity's prohibition of alcohol in freshmen
common spaces("New alcohol policy
proves successful," May 16). While a stu
dent newspaper reacting so positively to
the administration is rare, facts support
ing the article's headline were even hard
er to find.
For too long, alcohol policy debates
have been buttressed in anecdotes and
unscientific qualitative measurements.
Frankly, it does not matter what one resi
dent assistant's experiences over the
course of one year; without systemic stud
ies of alcohol consumption, overcon
sumption and culture, no one knows
which policies make students lives safer.
Currently, the University and the De
partment of Public Safety collect alcohol
related statistics including; minors in pos
session, driving under the influence, alco
hol-related misconduct and trips to the
emergency room, all in terms of class year.
Aside from the Stanford Police's annual
publication of the safety statistics, these
statistics are not widely publicized and
there is no part of the University adminis
tration that disseminates and publicizes a
compilation of these statistics.
Stanford needs to stop downplaying
less pleasant facts. For future alcohol poli
cies to be successful, the student body has
to understand and support them, and that
will only happen through frank discussion
that includes alcohol related statistics. A

StanÂ£ord committee, such as the Alcohol
Advisory Board should publish a yearly
report detailing all available statistics, and
the comparison to prior years would assist
in building such a discussion.
So far, there have been some efforts to
reach a similar goal/Phis year, the Alcohol
Advisory Board did a series of focus
group interviews among frosh to receive
feedback on alcohol policies. Efforts such
as focus groups are superior in receiving
usable data with tangible solutions. But to
be able to increase dialogue with the stu
dent body, the results of the focus groups
needs to be distributed widely. Also, this
process needs to be repeated every year in
order to compare and assess the policies.
Discussions about the alcohol policy
tend to create negative responses among
students, as they always believe the Uni
versity is out to get them. Generally this is
not the case. But when discussing these
sensitive topics, it is particularly impor
tant to be as truthful about the statistics as
possible.
In retrospect, it seems that The Daily
article was a bit presumptuous. As it
stands, the data is not compiled in a way to
comprehensively assess the policy's suc
cess. However, through further broaden
ing the efforts by the Alcohol Advisory
Board, a measurement can be developed.
We hope that Stanford's alcohol policy
has succeeded in making the University a
safer campus; we'd just like to see some
numbers to back it up.
