## Culture of 'life' 
### 
Every Friday for the
past couple of months, I
have tackled controversial
issues such as gay mar
riage, reproductive dis
crimination, the draft, poli
tics in the classroom, the
filibuster, the pope and
even nothing (these tend
to be my more forgettable
pieces). 'Itius, for the last

column of my freshman year. I thought I'd
dirty my hands in the definitive controversial
issue of the day: life.
At this point, it strikes me as undeniable
that embryonic stem cell research holds pos
sibilities for saving human lives. If an avenue
exists that could lead to treatments and cures
for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, can
cer and even quadriplegia, why has that av
enue not been traveled down? Ironically, we
have the "Culture of Life" to thank. George
W. Bush, in his lame-duck days of pre-9/11
presidency, drew an ethical and moral line
between adult stem cells and the more mal
leable embryonic ones in hopes of prevent
ing "a culture that devalues life." Out of the
goodness of his heart, however, he permitted
the continued research on the existing 60
stem cell lines — apparently these embryos,
unlike all others, were not living humans.
Fortunately, the president, in defense of his
restrictive policy, was able to fall back on this
concession in succeeding years — unfortu
nately, all these lines have been contaminat
ed to such a degree that renders them use
less.
The question of when life begins is so
complex, and a dead horse beaten so badly,
that addressing it here would be senseless.
Instead, let me just state that the embryos
that would be used in stem cell research
would be voluntarily donated by couples
who have undergone in-vitro fertilization.
Furthermore, if not implanted, these surplus

embryos would otherwise be discarded, re
gardless of whether or not they are consid
ered human life. And if they are to be tossed
away, shouldn't at least some (life-saving)
good come out of them?
At a press conference on Tuesday, Bush,
surrounded by children born from such "sur
plus embryos," refuted this assertion, arguing
that each of these bundles of undifferentiat
ed cells has the potential for human life. No
body would argue that the potential is not
there, simply that the potential for develop
ing treatments that would save millions more
must also be considered. And while it is won
derful that many infertile couples have opted
to use such surplus embryos, the truth is that
the vast majority are being thrown out. And
if these embryos are indeed human lives that
must be saved, why don't I see droves of pro
life activists lining up outside fertility clinics
waiting to get implanted?
And then there is the question of capital
punishment. As a rule of thumb, the majority
of those who subscribe to the "culture of life"
— who would classify themselves as pro-life
— are ironically pro-death (penalty).
Recently an Indiana man on death row re
quested reprieve so that his liver might be
donated to his ailing sister. The issue was re
solved on Wednesday: not only was his plea
for a postponed execution denied, his liver
died with him. Was he really such a threat to
society behind bars that he could not be kept
alive a moment longer with the chance of<
saving another life?
And what about all the innocent individ
uals mistakenly executed? It is understood
that many dozens of Americans have been
wrongfully put to death, whether due to neg
ligence or simple human error. Regardless,
however, it would seem that if the "culture of
life" had any integrity, it would abhor the
death penalty if only one man had ever been

erroneously executed.
As the American death toll in
Iraq climbs, one cannot but ask how
those who classify themselves as
pro-life are so often also pro-war.
Most estimates put the civilian Iraqi
body count at well over 10,(XX) —
yet the "culture of life," in all its ide
alistic patriotism, marches on unde
terred.
And this brings me back to em
bryonic stem cell research — hope
fully not too much of a stretch. Many
conservatives have argued that the
government should not be allowed
to use tax dollars to fund such con
troversial research — research that
inherently undermines their deepest
convictions and religious tenets.
Well then in response I will say, with
out reservation, do not use my tax
dollars to fund a war that inherently
undermines my deepest convictions
and religious tenets. And for that
matter, find some alternative fund
ing for lethal injections, the electric
chair, and firing squads. And please,
don't presume to live in a "culture of
life" if you support the condemna
tion qf countless individuals in the
courts, on the battlefield, or in hospi
tal beds.

One day, Kalani will heat the dead
horse of when life begins. E-mail him
