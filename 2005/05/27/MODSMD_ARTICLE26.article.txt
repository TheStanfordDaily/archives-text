Editorial 'obscures' stem cell research
To paraphrase the late Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan. The Daily's editorial
hoard is entitled to its own opinion, but its
their own facts. Hence, I'll refrain from argu
ing against the crass utilitarianism in the edi
torial Morality and mortality in stem cell re
search" (May 26) but instead focus on its
glaring factual errors.
There is no "four-year old ban on feder
al funding for stem cell research." Presi
dent George W. Bush was, in fact, the first
president to ever authorize federal fund
ing for embryonic stem cell research. He
did, however, put restrictions on the de

struction of new embryos to create new
stem-cell lines.
Secondly, by writing as though there were
a blanket ban on stem-cell research, the edi
torial obscures the research that is currently
being undertaking using adult stem cells and
umbilical cord stem cells. While the editorial
mentions the latter source of stem cells far
ther down the page, writing as though there
were a ban on funding for all stem cell re
search ignores the fact that the only restric
tions on such funding are for research that
destroys human embryos.
