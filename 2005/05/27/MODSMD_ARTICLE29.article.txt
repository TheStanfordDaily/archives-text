## High notes, footnotes and end Notes: Some final thoughts and clarifications 
### 
Someone once said that
to write is to place a stick in
the mud. Qualifications
and questions may compel
you to shift the stick, and
dissents and rejoinders
may force you to remove it
and start anew.The point is
that unless a position is
first staked, it cannot be
added to or improved
upon.

Such questions and rejoinders have great
ly shaped what I write, but some loose ends
remain from the past 12 weeks. Herewith,
then, some final thoughts and clarifications.
In"The sun never sets on Stanford" (Feb.
18), I may have misattributed the British ori
gin of that phrase, which was the title of an
Overseas Studies Program, or OSP, poster
used from the mid-1990s to 2(K)3.
The results of my own online trawl point
ed to a Scot named Christopher North who,
in 1829, wrote of "His Majesty's dominions,
on which the sun never sets." But in his book
"Outposts," the British journalist Simon
Winchester traces the origin of the phrase to
Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller who
is said to have written, in German,"[T]he sun
never sets on my dominions."
So the case remains open. Still, the sur
rounding confusion only demonstrates the

subconscious way in which empire diffuses
itself into all corners of modern life. We must
consider the consequences, to borrow
Kipling's cautionary words, "Lest we forget
— lest we forget!"
A slight confusion might have arisen from
"Pope John Paul II and the ethics of respon
sibility" (April 8). In that column, I asked,
"Was the now-late Karol Wojytla a Catholic,
in the universal sense of the word?" and ar
rived at the conclusion that "he has been
both too Catholic and not Catholic enough."
Both the "Catholic" in my question and the
second "Catholic" in my conclusion should
have been spelled "catholic," to express the
universal, non-religious meaning of the
word.
I wrote several pieces about the OSP,
and my search for a provocative stance
often brought out flaws in my arguments. In
" 'Stanford-in' OSP programs need re
thinking" (Jan. 5), for example, I said that
the isolated nature of the abroad centers
makes for an "unchallenging" experience.
Sarah Barthelow, responding in a letter,
questioned my term by noting the rigorous
tutorial on African healthcare she had
taken while studying in Oxford ("It's up to
students to make the most of their time
abroad," Jan. 6).
Her letter illuminated an important dis
tinction that I failed to make. What I found

"unchallenging" in my quarter abroad was
not the academics. Rather, I was referring to
the ways in which students seemed to be con
strained from testing themselves in linguistic
and social terms.
In "Stop OSP hand-holding" (Feb. 11), 1
cited aspects of "Stanford-in" programming
as evidence that cultural exposure in our
centers abroad hews to "upper-middle-class
ideals" at the expense of a broader presenta
tion of the host society.
While I believe these are essential ques
tions for consideration, I erred by summing
up this cultural programming as "paternal
ism." I have serious concerns with the ways
in which OSP students gain cultural expo
sure, but I needlessly used a pejorative word
where a descriptive one would have sufficed.
Aspects of the dialogue over studying
abroad have been far from perfect, but 1
think that some common ground remains. In
spite of the limitations of the 10-week OSP
quarters — as discussed by Geophysics Prof.
Amos Nur, director of the OSP ("An open
letter to Chris Vaughan," March 9) — one
still hopes that the program can find new
ways to facilitate its stated goals of language
acquisition and cultural understanding on
the part of its students.
In the end, one can have a terrific quarter


Christopher R.
Vaughan
abroad and evaluate it well — as. in
deed. I did — and still wish that it
could have been better.
For common ground, for liber
alism, for diversity, there exists
perhaps no more useful contribu
tion than to hoist the pen. to
mount the soapbox, to take the
cause into the public square. In
this important endeavor, we might
turn for guidance and for closure

to Hannah Arendt, who said, near
the end of her life:
"Each time you write something
and you send it out into the world
and it becomes public, obviously
everybody is free to do with it what
he pleases, and this is as it should be.
You should not try to hold your hand
now on whatever may happen to
what you have been thinking for
yourself. You should rather try to
learn from what other people do
with it."
