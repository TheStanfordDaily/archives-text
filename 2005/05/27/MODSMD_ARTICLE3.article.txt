# Howe hangs up tap shoes for cleats
## Freshman brings consistency to Card 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford softball first baseman
Erin Howe has light feet. They're
fast, too. And those descriptions
have nothing to do with her per
formance on the field.
Howe, who is nearing the end of
her first season at Stanford, began
playing T-ball with the boys when
she was five. But even before then,
she had already laced up a special
pair of shoes: tap dance shoes.

"I was a dancer
for 13 years until I
gave it up for soft
ball during my jun
ior year of high
school," Howe said.
Even now, the
Missouri City, Texas
native finds time to
squeeze in a few
one-two steps.
"Sometimes you
can catch me doing
tap dances with my
softball cleats in the
dugout," Howe said
before joking, "My
ultimate goal in life,
besides being presi
dent, is to be a
Broadway dancer."

Howe may love the dance spot
light but Stanford head coach John
Rittman describes Howe as a quiet
competitor. She has batted consis
tently throughout the year, coming
through in clutch situations. She
enters this weekend's Super
Regionals hitting .278 with 21 RBI.
"Erin's made her adjustments
well at the plate and that's been the
biggest reason for her consistency
with her average this year, and she's
going to get better," Rittman said.
And while freshman pitcher
Becky McCullough says her team
mate is loud, social and fun on the
field, she also said Howe maintains
her composure.
"Erin puts a lot of hard work into
the game and has an awesome work

ethic," McCullough said. "Where her
relaxed personality comes into play
it is in having a positive mental
approach to her work. She doesn't
get flustered when she makes a
mistake, but stays relaxed and posi
tive with herself and just continues
to put the work in to make adjust
ments."
While Howe hasn't taken center
stage this season for the Cardinal,
she has been a valuable contributor
throughout her rookie season.
Though she was a catcher through-

out high school,
Howe was moved
to first base and
designated player
/ hitter for most of
the season.
"She really
stepped up for us
this year," Rittman
said. "We asked
her to play a new
position, first base.
She came in and
made the adjust
ment really well."
The fact that she
was making the
adjustment with so
many of her Class
of 2008 teammates
around her made

the transition easier; when
McCullough is on the mound, fresh
men make up two thirds of the
Cardinal infield. Closest to Howe on
gameday is second baseman Tricia
Aggabao.
"Tricia is great to have on your
side of the infield," Howe said. "She
has soft hands and quick feet and
has made some amazing plays this
entire season. I am definitely look
ing forward to my next three years
not only because I get to have her
as a teammate but as a great friend
as well."
McCullough echoed the same
thoughts about getting to play with
five of her classmates.
"It's awesome having such a tight
group of people out there working
together, but it's also nice knowing
we'll have this lor four years," she
said.
The limelight will be on Howe
and her fellow freshmen this week
end and beyond.
"She's doing extremely well for
us, and we're looking for a very
bright future from Erin," Rittman
said.
The past, on the other hand, has
already held plenty of exciting

moments for Howe. In 2004, she
was part of the Elkins High School
team that won the Texas 5-A State
championship. After losing the pre
vious two years, Elkins went on a
perfect 39-0 record to take the title
last year.
"A lot of teams freak out when
something like that is on the line, but
as a team leader in high school her
team never choked," McCullough
said. "And now she still plays with
the poise of a mature player."
That maturity will surely help
Howe this weekend against
Tennessee in the Super Regionals.
Howe said that she thinks her title
run in high school has prepared her
for a run at the Women's College
World Series.

"I believe my postseason experi
ence helps me to an extent," Howe
said. "College ball is a level above
anything else I've ever played, but
I'm sure it helps."
And while Howe's ultimate goal
may be to make it onto Broadway
once her softball career comes to a
close, her goal this weekend is to
make it far enough into the postsea
son to be able to face the team she'd
want to play with if she wasn't with
Stanford.
"I would love to play Texas
A&M," Howe said. "One of my best
friends who I've played with since I
was 10 years old is their third base
man. I hope they do really well this
weekend so we can see them at the
World Series"
