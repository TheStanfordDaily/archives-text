# Howe hangs up tap shoes for cleats
## Freshman brings consistency to Card 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford softball first baseman
Erin Howe has light feet. They're
fast, too. And those descriptions
have nothing to do with her per
formance on the field.
Howe, who is nearing the end of
her first season at Stanford, began
playing T-ball with the boys when
she was five. But even before then,
she had already laced up a special
pair of shoes: tap dance shoes.

"I was a dancer
for 13 years until I
gave it up for soft
ball during my jun
ior year of high
school," Howe said.
Even now, the
Missouri City, Texas
native finds time to
squeeze in a few
one-two steps.
"Sometimes you
can catch me doing
tap dances with my
softball cleats in the
dugout," Howe said
before joking, "My
ultimate goal in life,
besides being presi
dent, is to be a
Broadway dancer."

Howe may love the dance spot
light but Stanford head coach John
Rittman describes Howe as a quiet
competitor. She has batted consis
tently throughout the year, coming
through in clutch situations. She
enters this weekend's Super
Regionals hitting .278 with 21 RBI.
"Erin's made her adjustments
well at the plate and that's been the
biggest reason for her consistency
with her average this year, and she's
going to get better," Rittman said.
And while freshman pitcher
Becky McCullough says her team
mate is loud, social and fun on the
field, she also said Howe maintains
her composure.
"Erin puts a lot of hard work into
the game and has an awesome work

ethic," McCullough said. "Where her
relaxed personality comes into play
it is in having a positive mental
approach to her work. She doesn't
get flustered when she makes a
mistake, but stays relaxed and posi
tive with herself and just continues
to put the work in to make adjust
ments."
While Howe hasn't taken center
stage this season for the Cardinal,
she has been a valuable contributor
throughout her rookie season.
Though she was a catcher through-

out high school,
Howe was moved
to first base and
designated player
/ hitter for most of
the season.
"She really
stepped up for us
this year," Rittman
said. "We asked
her to play a new
position, first base.
She came in and
made the adjust
ment really well."
The fact that she
was making the
adjustment with so
many of her Class
of 2008 teammates
around her made

the transition easier; when
McCullough is on the mound, fresh
men make up two thirds of the
Cardinal infield. Closest to Howe on
gameday is second baseman Tricia
Aggabao.
"Tricia is great to have on your
side of the infield," Howe said. "She
has soft hands and quick feet and
has made some amazing plays this
entire season. I am definitely look
ing forward to my next three years
not only because I get to have her
as a teammate but as a great friend
as well."
McCullough echoed the same
thoughts about getting to play with
five of her classmates.
