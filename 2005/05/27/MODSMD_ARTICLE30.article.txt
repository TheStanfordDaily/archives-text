## Branner: If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It 
### CAROLINE CICCONE BRITT SANDLER 
As happens so often on this campus, op
position that arose against Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John Brav
man's recently introduced housing propos
al (particularly against the changes to Uja
maa), soon disappeared. Bravman's pro
posal seeks to convert Branner,Toyon, La
gunita and Roble to upper-class housing,
concentrate freshman dorms in Wilbur and
Stern Halls, and alter the way in which the
housing Draw occurs. Some are laudable
goals, but there are some serious flaws as
well. Formal changes have not yet oc
curred, so it is not too late to preserve the
institutions that make the undergraduate
experience at Stanford so unique and ful
filling. This is a debate that is no longer in
the news, but by no means over.
The complete overhaul of undergraduate
housing is just another administration pro
posal guaranteed to suck the life out of Stan
ford. Already we're a shell of our former self
as the irreverent and innovative west coast
"Ivy."
Getting rid of Branner. while preserving

Bravman's precious Freshman Sophomore
College, or FroSoCo, is not merely a bad
idea, it's myopic and selfish. Let's not forget
that Bravman is the RF of FroSoCo. Has
FroSoCo been a successful program? For
some, yes. But students who lived elsewhere
freshman year aren't exactly clamoring to
draw in.
Students have shown that it's not spacious
dorms and two-room doubles that they pre
fer; it's character and community. Students
with the best draw numbers willingly move
into tiny rooms in Row houses: those who
score a large room will even divide it among
three or four other students.
Branner isn't going to turn into some 'pre
mier' upper class dorm: this is a beautiful
building that has housed generations of en
thusiastic young frosh and given many of
them the best years of their lives. It's — wait
for it — tradition.
So why change a good thing?
We fully support increasing the number
of all-frosh houses and strengthening their
programs. But if this the primary motive of
Bravman's proposal, why on earth would he
want to get rid of Branner? Now. we may be
biased, but with three combined years of life

in Branner, we think it's one of the best
places on the planet to spend your freshman
year of college. Branner boasts a big commu
nity, a lot of support, programs, activities and
a huge pool of friends in which to find your
niche. As a place to live. Branner is just as
safe and comfortable as any campus dorm.
Myths of extreme levels of partying and alco
hol consumption are just that: myths.
As the Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education. Bravman isn't exactly doing a
good job keeping his finger on the pulse of
undergraduate culture at Stanford. If his
plan is implemented, we'll have the quality
of life of Caltech in no time. Nobody wants
that.
Where are the numbers? We've read
Bravman's proposal and the responses —
nowhere does he provide the data on why
the proposed changes are necessary. Which
begs the question: Bravman, why do you re
ally think Branner sucks?
