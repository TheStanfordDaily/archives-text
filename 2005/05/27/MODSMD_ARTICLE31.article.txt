## Jeff Dorman Sucks! The 						end of an era: Spencer says goodbye 
### 
This will be my last regular column in
The Daily. As per my calculations, this
is currently the longest-running col
umn in The Daily, and yes, I have that on my
resume. But this is it. I will have one more
column in the Commencement issue, but in
terms of my weekly spot, this is it.
For those of you keeping score at home, I
have written more than 75 columns in these
past three years, and while that number may
represent the workload of just a few months

for any professional writer,
I never hired an agent, and
thus retained my amateur
eligibility.
You see, it is lame jokes
like these that my public
craves, and for the last
three years, I have deliv
ered each week. But what
my readership rarely re
ceives are updates; what

happened to this person, that event, that
field hoekey team?
So in my last column, I'll devote my space
to my regular readership, the people who
read this column on a weekly basis, which I
hope is more than just my parents.
So here it is, a behind-the-column depic
tion of three years in the life of a Daily sports
columnist.
I had written a few columns prior to this
one in my sophomore year, hut clearly, my
popularity as a columnist achieved its first
major spike after "Spencer and Field Hock
ey's Infidelity." Basically, what happened
was that the field hockey team scolded me
privately for being a sub-par beat writer and
I belittled them publicly in response. It was
juvenile, crude and, if 1 may say so myself, hi
larious. This, as you might expect, created
some tension between myself and the team
— but when an entire D 1 Varsity team
chants "Spencer Porter Sucks!" at an on
campus event, you know you've made it as a
collegiate sports columnist.
I have since made my peace with the
team. I know some of them still wish to clob
ber me, but when 1 pass by those girls on
campus, 1 just hold my hand to my ear and
pretend that I'm on the phone.
The next columns that gained some sig
nificant popularity were my series of "Hot
Stuff columns, which detailed how I was ut
terly inept at dealing with the opposite sex.
"Hot Stuff" was my girlfriend at the time
("Cayenne" and "Sloan." my current gf,
would make appearances in future columns
as my special someone). 1 am happy to re
port that "Hot Stuff" not only provided
more conversation material than she is prob
ably comfortable with, but we are friends to
this day.
But I can't go a word further without
mentioning water polo. Inspired by Mike Al
banese, some of my friends and I challenged
the polo team to a staring / beauty contest in
"Spencer takes on water polo team in beau
ty contest." Back in the day, the polo team
would "post-up" at the Clock Tower, looking
sun-goldencd and chlorinated. But when my
crew showed up. the team backed down to
our alpha-male status. Thankfully, the polo
team was the biggest fan of this piece, with
their coach even sending it to recruits. I have
picked on the polo guys often in my last
three years and their response has always
been very gracious.
And. of course, how could I forget my
countdown of the Top 10 Armenian athletes
of all time? Featuring Cher at No. 8, this col
umn somehow found its way into the hearts
of half the Armenians in the state, and they
all e-mailed me. In related news, I now have
17 great recipes for Shish-Kebab.
I had other columns in there that 1 don't
want to forget, like "Cheater's Zone," my re
flection on being the inspiration for being an
entire character in "Gaieties," and "Heart is
Necessary, Clothing is Optional." I had my
successes: "It's Chill for Soccer at KA Kick
ball Classic." My failures:"Spencer's a Much
Bigger Idiot Than You." And my poignant
moments: "Spencer Misses You — and the
Arizona game."
As far as I can tell. I leave campus having
offended five sports teams (lightweight
crew, field hockey, archery, water polo and
football), many student groups (Yell Lead
ers, the Band, Axe Committee, etc.), and a
few countries (Germany, England, etc.).
But really, I'd like to thank the all people
that made this column possible, all the char
acters, editors and fans. They include: Steve
"Whose Rick" Myrick. Kerin Lanyi, Nicole
Miller, Scott Allen, Jess Peters, Aaron
Levine, Matt Long, Ross Porter, Chase
Porter, my parents. Grandma, Mike
Boutross, Mike Sgroi, Mike Albanese, Jan
Piotrowski, Vamsi Adusumilli, Renee Hud
son. Ryan Spies, Preston McCaskill, Jon
Heller, Ben Huston, Julie Ruvolo, Bill Sim
mons, the water polo team, Alfonso Pulido,
Chris Hernandez and Tony Kornheiser.
Thank you to everyone who has enjoyed
this column and told me about it. And thank
you to everyone who hated this column, but
never told me about it.
Thank you all.

Spencer Porter is a senior and this editor Li
going to miss writing headlines for his
