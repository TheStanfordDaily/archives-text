### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the excitement of Pacific-10 Con
ference team competition over for the Car
dinal track and field teams, the mood at the
track has become a bit more serious. Quali
fying for the NCAA Outdoor Champi
onships remains the one thing on the minds
of Stanford's top athletes this weekend.
Forty-six Cardinal will attempt to qualify for
the National meet at this Friday and Satur
day's NCAA West Regionals in Eugene,
Ore.
For junior 10,000-meter runner Alicia
Craig, things are looking up. Coming off a
victory in the 10,000-meter run this past
weekend at the Pac-10 Championships,
Craig has some time to rest before the
NCAA Championship meet to be held June
8 to 1 l.The 10k is her signature event and is
one in which runners do not need a top-five
finish at the Regional meet to qualify for
NCAAs. Instead, runners can qualify auto
matically at any time throughout the season.
Craig's first 1 Ok of the 2005 outdoor sea
son, which she won in 34:02.79, at Pac-lOs re
sulted in her third straight championship
title and an automatic berth to NCAAs.
Craig currently holds the NCAA, Pac-10
and Stanford all-time record in the 10k with
a time of 32:19.97, which she set at the Car
dinal Invitational last year.
Craig attributes her success and motiva
tion to her love of running and to the strong
team atmosphere she has experienced for
four years on the Farm.
"The girls that I train with have become
my best friends," Craig said.
Craig, who redshirted her freshman in
door and outdoor track seasons but ran four
years of cross-country, follows in the foot
steps of running sensation Lauren Flesh
man, Class of 2003.
"My sophomore year was just a great
year because it seemed like every race I ran
I had Sara Bei and Lauren Fleshman and we
just kind of dominated every race we ran in,"
Craig said. "It's nice to share that experience
with your teammates."
Craig has been winning successive cham
pionship meets and setting collegiate
records for four years, including two NCAA
titles in the 10k â€” and that's just in outdoor
track. Rather than let the success go to her
head, though, the humble Craig said she
thrives off of her team and her faith in God.
"I guess I haven't really felt set apart,"
Craig said. "Every day, I'm amongst people
that are working very hard. Hie only differ
ence is the outcome of the races. In terms of
feeling pressure, pressure is kind of what you
make of it. I don't race just to win the race, I
just want to race to my potential. I'm only
racing to glorify the Lord."
A head injury has plagued Craig for the
past several months, but she has not let it
slow her down. Craig looks to win her third
national outdoor championship in June.
"My goal for this season is just to go to

NCAAs and have a great race," Craig said.
"It will be my last official race in a Stanford
uniform and so it will he nice finishing up
knowing I have been part of something
amazing for the past four years."
There are a score of other Cardinal run
ners who share the same goal for the end of
the outdoor track season. At Regionals this
weekend, the top five athletes in each event
will qualify for NCAAs. The next three top
finishers will enter a descending order list, of
which the best three overall times will qual
ify.
For the men. junior discus thrower
Michael Robertson has a good chance of
earning a berth to NCAAs. Seniors Don
Sage, Chris Emme and lan Dobson will com
pete in the 5,000-meter run and a strong core
group of middle-distance runners will com
pete in the 800- and 1,500-meter runs.
Junior Solomon Welch has a solid chance
of qualifying in the triple jump and senior
Nick Sebes will attempt to qualify in the 400-
meter dash. Sebes is currently ranked eighth
in the West Region.
"We are not really trying to score huge
points in the meet," men's head coach
Robert Weir said. "We want to get as many
people from our programs qualified for Na
tionals. Most of the team [members] are
solid competitors and have a very good
chance of qualifying."
Women's head coach Edrick Floreal ex
pressed a similar sentiment.
"It is not as important to win the compe
tition as it is to get in the top five," Floreal
said."Winning it [the race] and overexerting
yourself is sometimes no good. The girls just
need to understand that the focus of this
meet is to go to the NCAAs,not to break any
school records."
Along with Craig and Bei, a stacked
group of Cardinal women's distance run
ners, from freshmen to senior veteran com
petitors will attempt to qualify.
The women also have sprint competitors
in the 100-, 2(H)- and 400-meter dash events.
Senior Undine Becker will compete in the
400-meter hurdles. Freshman star Erica
McLain is currently ranked first in the triple
jump and second in the long jump.
Members of the 4x 100-meter relay,
ranked fourth, and the 4x400-meter relay,
ranked third, will also compete.
'Hic Cardinal have been working toward
this weekend all season long. Weir said.
"Right now they are all in a kind of main
tenance phase to hold their peak until the
end of the year," Weir said. "We do some
sharpening up, but for the most part the ath
letes have been preparing all year for this
opportunity. 'ITiey're basically fit and ready
to go."
On Monday at Cobb Track and Angell
Field. Olympians, post-collegiate and colle
giate runners will compete together in the
Payton Jordan U.S. Open.
Last year the meet was renamed in honor
of famous track and field coach Payton Jor
dan, who coached at the Farm for 23 vears.
