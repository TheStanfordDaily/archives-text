# Hello Sports Dept., (later, Intermission)
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN INTERMISSION GUEST EDITOR 
Throughout the year, I've come to ad
mire the hard work that Betsy, Brendan,
Caley, Sam, Tarn and Victor have putin
to Intermission. Despite some of their
obvious faults — Betsy likes the Yan
kees and Brendan doesn't eat meat on

his pizza — I can't imagine a better
group of people to spend late nights with
in the bowels of the Storke Publications
Building.
I'd say there's a love-respect relation
ship between our two staffs.
We don't really have all that much in
common. We interview Rob Little and
Candice Wiggins, they interview Tim
Lipus, Asshole and (allegedly) "Hitchik
er's Guide" producer Robbie Stamp.
We do Google image searches for
"Robert Morris logo," they do Google
image searches for "Spongeßob
Square Pants."
One early Friday morning in The Daily
office, with Cardinal Today unfinished
and an Intermission staffer working

slowly at each of the five layout comput
ers, a thought crossed my mind: Thanks
for jacking all of the computers,
douchebags.
Then, I had another thought: Let's be
friends, combine forces and put out a
Sports Intermission. (Douchebags.)
Not surprisingly, the idea was well re
ceived. I'm convinced that without Tam

to keep it in check,
the Intermission
staff would put to
gether a Stanford
Review-themed
issue if Benjamin
Guthrie and Co.
would provide the
content. Look for
that in September.
There are many
perks to being a part
of Intermission. In
addition to the
countless press kits
and five free copies
of the Sims — none
of which will be re
viewed — the staff
received two official
NCAA Final Four

basketballs in the mail. Hot. In the Sports
Department, we're lucky to get the San
Jose State football media guide —by
February.
Intermission also knows no bounds. In
good conscience, the Sports Department
can't run headlines like "Cardinal Pound
Beavers," "Fencing Foiled Again," "All
Your Base Are Belong to Lowrie" and
"Who Gives a Shit?" in Cardinal Today,
but everything's fair game on the pages
Roxy Sass calls home.
So what do you get when you combine
the creative minds of the Intermission
staff with a group of sports nuts? The first
ever Sports Intermission. Oh yeah, and
Rice Krispies treat golf with Jules R.
Penguin's old clubs.


No, they're riot 80 years old and on a cruise ship. Weird, huh?
