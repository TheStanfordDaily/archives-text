# Madagascar: Unleaded at best

### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSION JUNGLE LION HUNTAH 
You've got to hand it to those poor computer ani
mation studios at companies not named Pixar; if
Apple is the small upstart in the battle for personal
computers, Steve Jobs's other "little company that
could" has easily become the Microsoft of computer
animated films. Anyone else who tries to make com
peting product is in for one heck of an uphill battle.
Not that the competition always puts its best foot
forward. I have to confess I have yet to be interested
in a CGI film from Fox ("Robots" just looked obnox
ious), and it's more than a little suspect that Dream
works released "Antz" and "Shark Tale" in such
close proximity to the similarly-themed "A Bug's
Life" and "Finding Nemo." The one sure hit that
Pixar hasn't been responsible for has been the Shrek
series, which seems to have become the Dreamworks
model for animated storytelling. This strategy has
both its advantages and flaws.
"Madagascar" is about a group of zoo animals that
escape from the confines of their simulated habitat in
the name of wanderlust and adventure. But these
aren't your ordinary zoo animals, they're New York
zoo animals, complete with their rah-rah New Yorker
attitudes (I think at one point an animated hippo actu
ally declares something like, "We're New Yorkers,
right? We're tough!"). The story focuses on four main
characters: Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty
the zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the giraffe (David
Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) the
aforementioned hippo heroine. Rounding out the es
capees are a well-trained squad of penguins and a pair
of monkeys — one much more sophisticated than the
other, but neither above throwing feces when the urge
arises.
Hie animals are .ill recaptured and shipped over-

seas, but events
(and screenwrit
ers) being what
they are, the ani
mals come to find
themselves ma
rooned in Mada
gascar where they
befriend a strange
colony of lemurs.
In the process, the
central friendship
between Alex and
Marty is tested as
Marty rediscovers

his predatory in
stincts in the wild
and must resist the
age-old temptation
to eat his friends.
Like most animat
ed fare, the film
mines lots of jokes
from the simple

fact of anthropomorphizing its main characters —
Look, a giraffe complaining about HMOs! A lion
grousing about the Knicks! — but there's a certain
carefree edge to the humor that gives the film a re
freshing sense of grown-up realism. It's oddly com
forting to see a cartoon version of Times Square that
includes all the crass advertisements, and despite a
slapstick sense of physics and cute character designs
the film manages to play its un-Disney-like qualities
as a strength.
The one habit I do wish Dreamworks would
kick is its penchant for pop culture references, first
demonstrated (and beaten to death) in "Shrek";
these people literally live and die by the homage.
"Saturday Night Fever," "Planet of the Apes,"
"National Geographic" and others all get their
earnest send-ups in "Madagascar," and there's
even a direct reference to "American Beauty"
complete with Thomas Newman score that I found
both bold and ridiculous. It's not the idea that these
references are corny or quickly dated that bothers
me — it's the implied admission by the filmmakers
that the cinematic world they've created is insuffi
cient alone to entertain an audience. Cultural con
text be damned — when did straight parody be
come homage, and when did homage become a
substitute for originality?
As movies go, though, I actually found myself
pleasantly entertained by "Madagascar." It certainly

doesn't leave
you with much
to think about or
engender any
long-term feel
ings, but there's
a surprising craft
to its construc
tion that makes
you think that
indue time
Pixar might not
have that mo
nopoly sealed
up after all.
