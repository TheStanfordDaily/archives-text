### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION SENATOR 
Sports movies that are probably elaborate
metaphors for Neo Marxism

"The Mighty Ducks" (1992):
In fulfilling his community service, hot
shot lawyer Gordon Bombay teaches a
ragtag group of Minnesotans to "fly" on
the ice and to play as a team. Yet in reali
ty, I am convinced all this unity and cohe
sion crap is nothing more than Commie
infused rouse to fight for the proletariat. If
watching "Red Dawn" taught me any
thing, its that they can be anywhere. And
lefs face it: Commies love hockey. The
Mighty Ducks love hockey. If you know
anything about syllogisms, then I think
you know where I'm going with this...
"White Men Can't Jump"
(1992):
Racial lines and foul lines alike are
crossed when Wesley Snipes and
Woody Harrelson team up to hustle
money in some of Los Angeles' rough
est basketball courts. Yet when the two
attempt to scam money off a horde of
gangsters, sinking free throws becomes
the least of their problems. So what do
we have here? Different races of people
banding together to revolt against the
exploitation of coercive and manipula
tive enforcers? Sound familiar? Exactly.

Sports movies that are chick flicks in disguise

"Jerry Maguire" (1996):
You had me at — oh crap, what the
hell happened to the sports money and
glory movie? Ostensibly it's tale of an
agent's (Tom Cruise) attempts to suc
ceed independently from his firm after a
moral epiphany rocks his very exis
tence. Somehow he starts hooking up
with a needy single mom, Renee Zell
weger — and this gives rise to cliched
romantic lines that have haunted us
ever since. Though framed in the cut
throat world of wooing athletes and
making bank, this movie is functionally
so sweet that it'll give you diabetes be
fore the closing credits.
"Bend it Like Beckham" (2002):
You thought it was an instructional
soccer video, you thought it might be a
porno — maybe a little bit of both. Well
you were wrong, dumbass. Sure it's a
movie about a girl tossing aside cultural
and personal shackles to pursue her
dreams of soccer glory. Yet with a wed
ding looming in the background, a love
triangle in the making and familial ties
put to the test-this movie is tantamount
to one big love fest. Then again, there's
that pseudo-lesbian subplot... see,
every cloud has its silver lining.

Sports movies in which losing isn't the
worst thing that could happen

The Fan" (1996):
Holy crap, this one did
suck. Robert DeNiro plays a
crazed knife-salesman /
baseball fan whose adora
tion and murderously loyal
support of the Giants new
big shot, played by Wesley
Snipes, turns dangerously
sour. Though "The Fan"
seeks to personify the spirit
of the disenfranchised fan
— sick of athletes who fail to
respect or appreciate their
patrons, the characters are
too over the top to be believ
able, let alone likeable.

"Black Sunday" (1977):
So get this: An Israeli anti
terrorist must stop a disgrun
tled Vietnam vet from attempt
ing to use a Goodyear blimp to
shoot darts at thousands of
spectators at the Super Bowl. I
know —what the fuck? Yet
under the expert direction of
John Frankenhiemer and in
the wake of the kidnappings of
the 1972 Munich Olympic
games, this movie manages to
evoke legitimate tension even
now... to some extent. Now
it's easy to dismiss the plot as
propaganda run amuck, but I
think there's some football
somewhere in there, too.

"Sudden Death" (1995):
Take Jean Claude Van Damme, "Icy" the Pittsburgh Penguins' ginormous mascot, a
butcher knife, a deep fryer and an industrial strength dishwasher and you've got yourself one
hell of a movie. Van Damme must stealthily disarm a series of bombs planted throughout the
Pittsburgh Civic Arena before time runs out in game seven of the Stanley Cup playoffs and
20,000 are killed. You'll get to see Van Damme kick in bad guys in the groin, set them on fire
using aerosol cans and, yes, strangle a massive penguin in a dishwasher. Who said there's
no more magic in the movies?

Transsexual Sport Romps

"Ladybugs" (1992):
It's a classic story: Boy meets
girl, boy dresses up like girl to
compete on the girls soccer team
and then awkwardness, hilarity
and, ultimately, romance ensues!
At one point, the late Rodney
Dangerfield exclaims, "She's just
mad 'cuz I dressed her son up as
a girl and asked her to play with
me." Such quotes have only
gained greater resonance in the
times we live in — Michael Jack
son, anyone?
"Juwanna Mann" (2002):
Juwanna waste 90 minutes of
your life? Cool — me too! When
Jamal Jeffries' bad boy antics get
him booted from the NBA, he re
sponds rationally by dressing up
as a woman . .. and joining the
WNBA. Over the course of the
movie, Juwanna encounters a
few "complications" during the
post game-shower, initially strug
gles but later enjoys wearing
women's underwear and com
petes with Ginuwine to win the af
fections of a hottie teammate. If
it's 4 a.m. and you somehow
stumble across this, I'd recom
mend viewing "Juwanna Mann,"
not as a comedy but as a caution
ary tale for Ron Artest.

Sports movies with ass-bad sequels

"Slap Shot" (1975):
Widely considered the
Holy Grail of Hockey
films (with "D 3: The
Mighty Ducks" at a dis
tant 22nd), "Slap Shot"
chronicles Paul New
man's attempts to keep
his small-town hockey
team afloat. The solution
to all his problems? Vio
lence, of course!
"The Sandlot"
(1993):
Another elementary
school classic: During a
magical summer in a
new town, Scotty Smalls
learns about baseball,
best friends, accepting
his stepfather and the
legend of the Great
Bambino. Perhaps most
memorably, this brood of
friends must battle the
ball-eating Beast behind
the sandlot in order to re
claim a priceless Yan
kee's baseball. I think in
the end, the Best turns
out to be Star Jones. I
forget — but that just
seems right to me.
