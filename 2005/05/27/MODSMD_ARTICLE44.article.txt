## IM athletes: Gods among ants 
### DAN MCCARTHY INTERMISSION SPORTS EDITOR 
Granted, I am probably not the most unbi
ased person to write this feature — given the op
portunity. I would play Chicago-style softball six
hours a day, every day, and then spend my
evenings playing dodgeball in Ford Center until
my elbow swelled up like a ripe grapefruit. In
tramural sports, at any time, make up at least 85
percent of my consciousness. I also have a
propensity to prioritize IM sports over every
thing else, to the point of chewing out my team
mates for attending Mother's Day functions
rather than softball games. That said, my three
years at Stanford have been irrevocably colored
by the IM experience, so it might be in my best
interest to summarize it before I graduate.
When I arrived at Stanford, I could not wait
for IM sports to start. See, I assumed that there
would be a lot of ex-varsity athletes here since it
is a requirement for admission that every enter
ing student either A) play a sport, B) play an in
strument or C) accrue more community service
hours than Jimmy Carter. Since I have the nat
ural musical talent of a gorilla (a regular gorilla,
too, not that elitist bitch Koko) and I hate home
less people, I played sports in high school with
some success. I expected to find a lot of other
people here like me — guys who might have
been D-I athletes somewhere else but chose
Stanford over playing football at LSU-Shreve
port, who would be more than willing to give up
their Saturday afternoons to play a pickup game.
Apparently, 1 was wrong. With a few excep
tions, IM sports here, despite being fairly well
run, are not incredibly popular. What was once
one of the most popular sports, inner-tube water
polo, was cancelled this year due to lack of inter
est. Granted, we're no Notre Dame, but there

are some bright spots.
Basketball is probably the most popular IM
sport, but football has the best culture surround
ing it. Despite having only limited experience
with IM basketball (one winless season), I can't
imagine it comparing to IM football as a melting
pot for Stanford's wannabe athletic community.
On blustery Saturday mornings in fall, the Sand
Hill fields are full of That Guys — grad school
teams with scripted plays ("Computer blue!"),
disorganized man-children culled from Branner
(the China of IM competition, which draws suc
cess from its sheer numerical mass) and frat guys
still coming down from the shakes. Of course,
putting these together inevitably results in one or
two shoving matches per week along the line of
scrimmage.
Basketball also presents a less problematic sit
uation for referees, since on the court players are
typically used to calling their own fouls. On the
football field, though, things can get a little con
fusuig. I first fount! this out when 1 won a
pregame coin toss last October. I attempted to
defer, and the ref told me. "You know if you kick
off in the first half, you have to kick to them in the
second half, too, right?"
1 won't say anything further about IM offi
cials. since I'm still at least partially at their mercy
in the quest for a Softball championship later this
month. But 1 will say this: If you have even a lim
ited knowledge of sports and you're considering
either finding a job here or working in Sri Lanka
for the Peace Corps, stay here and ref IM games,
where your services are really needed.
You probably haven't heard of IM softball.
Given my team's prodigious ability to win by for
feit. many of you who haven't heard of it were
probably signed up to play us on Sundays at 4
p.m. What never ceases to amaze new arrivals to
Stanford, though, is the fact that softball here is

played with the 16-inch-circumference Chica

go-style ball, ostensibly to prevent in

jury to semi-coordinated fresh

man girls and engineering

grad students. The grad

students always seem

the most con
cerned, showing

up half an hour
before the

game and then
dramatically
removing
their Killer
Loop flip
down sun
glasses in
wonder when

they see that
we play with a

softball the size
and weight of a
cantaloupe.

But clearly, there is
one IM sport that reigns

above the rest, and that is

dodgeball. IM dodgeball is so

fundamentally the essence of athletic

competition that God himself must have spoken
into 1M Commissioner Jay Jackson's ear and
thus designated for us the land of milk and honey
that is the Ford Center on a Saturday night. 1
can't describe the playoff tournament from last
year adequately, so for more information you
should look for ESPN Classic's forthcoming
"CenUiry's Greatest Games" feature on our
team's championship run.
And the fruits of the winners' labors is, of
course, the 'iM Champions" T-shirt. My "IM
Champions: Dodgeball" shirt is, by far, my most

treasured possession earned during my

Stanford career. Wearing this

around campus must

make the real athletes

look down on me

with the same

sort of disgust

that the
maitre d'

at Spago
might
exhibit

upon
enter
ing an
Arby's,
but I

still put
it on with

pride.
TTien 1 re

in em be r
that my girl

friend is a mem

ber of a three-time

national collegiate

champion tennis team and

that I hang out with Olympic

athletes on a daily basis. Still, the shirt is the ul
timate achievement of my IM career, the lone
jewel in the crown that is my Stanford education.
So the IM program could use some help, and
you're probably the one to provide it. Make a
headband out of a sock, pop some ampheta
mines and head out to the IM fields this week
end. Or, you know, don't, and pretend your col
lege experience is about "academics." Nerd.
