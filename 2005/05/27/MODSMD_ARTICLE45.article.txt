### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION IMPROV ENTHUSIAST 
With more improv than you can shake a space-object stick
at, this weekend promises a veritable cornucopia of improvi
sationai theatre happenings on campus with the long-await
ed return to Stanford of the California Theatre Sports
(CATS) Tournament.
To honor beloved retiring Stanford Improvisers coach
Patricia Ryan who founded the Simps in 1991, Ventura re
laxed its decade-long stranglehold on the improvpalooza,
allowing the tournament to return to its roots here at Stan
ford. The bonanza kicked off last night with the Episode I
of the Simps' end of quarter show. Today the fun contin
ues with another Simps vs. Simps show at 8:00 p.m. fol
lowed by "freeplay" (an unscored improv free-for-all) in
volving the hometown Simps along with the visiting
teams.
Starting tomorrow, the communal spirit will give way to
ruthless competition. (Shit, who am I kidding? As improv con

noisseur junior Jenny Cohen says, improv "is liberation from
the need to compete, drive and dominate." But who asked

her?) The tournament will adhere to the
rules of Theatre Sports, an improv genre
in which two teams alternate creating im
provised scenes using specific parame
ters which arc then scored by judges.
Asked to comment on why students
should attend, Simp junior Joshua
Meisel said in an e-mail, "Joanna Fiduc
cia is the hottest improviser ever! Come
see her makeout with everyone on stage
. . . and in the audience . . . naked!!!'*
When asked to respond, current Simp
and CATS co-producer Jenn Chou, a
third-year law student, believes con
firmed that "Fiducc is hot whether
clothed or naked," but denied that
"make out" is one word. Microsoft
Word backed her up.

All matches are at Pigott Theatre next to MemAud. Tickets can
he bought this afternoon at White Plaza or at the door.


If the Stanford Simps were any more badass they would kick puppies. Fortunately, they don't. But that does not
mean they're not already badass enough.
