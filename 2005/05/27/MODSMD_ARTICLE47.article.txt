Ah. Thcfacebook.com. Aside
from the endless debate on
whether die group "Perfect 10"
has hotter girls than "Hottest
Stanford Girls (and yes, there ac
tually are some)" it really does
provide the easiest way to do any
sort of "journalistic" research.
So while we all marvel at groups
such as "Do Your Part" — and
its arclmemesis, "Do Your Part
is Not Smart"-— I give you the
weirdest music choices from
Stanford student-athletes, as sel f
reported on Thefacebook.com.
Donald Sage (Track and
Field). "Creed, Maroon 5. basi
cally anything middle-aged guys
listen to when they wanna

Rock!!" —- Somewhere, God just read this
sentence and killed 10 kitk ns.
Tony Azevedo (Water Polo): He
doesn't have a profile, but a teammate
confirms that he listens to "Karma
Chameleon" by Culture Club to celebrate
after victories. I'd make a joke here, but
it's really not necessary.
Andrew Kartunen (Soccer): "U2. Cold
play, Millencolin, The Postal Service, Ra
diohcad, Something Corporate, Luciano
Pavarotti. Andrea Bocelli." — Pavarotti?
(Reporter raising eyebrow.) Don't read
past U2, he just listens to "Sunday, Bloody
Sunday" on an eternal repeat.
Evan Moore (Football): "I believe just
a good dose of This Years Love that is Ac
cidentally in Love" I have no idea what
this means, but 1 don't like it.
Amanda Trotter (Cross Country —
Track and Field): "Anything."
Katy Trotter (Amanda's twin)'. "Al
most anything."

Fred Washington (Basketball/Host oj
MTV's "Pimp My Ride "Anything
good."
Phi! Kim (Ex-Track and Field): "Em
inem. Cam'ron, Young Buck. Rent."
Hmm. which one of these doesn't go with
the others? Phil also claims he is taking a
class entitled "FEMST 1: Tip Drills" and
"ATHLETIC 202: Spooning: Advanced,"
so he has a wide assortment of psycholog
ical problems. I'm sure.
Steve Gerberman (Fencing): "Rap.
Country, Classic Roc — a variety." Com
pletely false. I know for a fact that this guy
listens to nothing but Kelly Clarkson.
Matt Lottkh (Ex-Basketball): "Hip
Hop. R&B" However, his favorite book is
the Bible, so I'm just going to go ahead
and assume he only listens to Creed.
Jeremy Barton (Crew): "country coun
try country." Lame lame lame.
Spencer Porter (Soccer): "Fiona
Apple" — What a fruit.
