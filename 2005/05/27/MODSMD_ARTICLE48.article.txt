### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, ATHLETIC SUPPORTER 
Roxy might not be the biggest sports fan,
but she's definitely a big fan of athletes.
Sure, she might not always understand what
they're doing on the field, but she certainly
knows it pays off when the night goes into
"extra innings." And sorry, boys, playing
Ilalo 2 doesn't count as a sport.
Athletes are great sexual partners for a
number of pleasurable reasons . . . and
they're just hot, too. Forget diamonds, ath
letes should be a girl's best friend. Follow
Roxy's advice, and the Arrillaga Sports Cen
ter will soon be like a second home — or a
second bedroom, at the very least. So sit
back and let Roxy take you on a sexual jour
ney through campus, starting at the football
field.
Football players have a reputation for
good reason: they're big, they're strong and
they can even make sex in Crothers Memor
ial exciting. It's the same for basketball and
baseball, but they don't pay Roxy to write
articles about stuff you can figure out on
your own — Roxy's here to impart wisdom

about the sports you don't know a lot about.
And with that, let's move on to the Avery
Aquatic Center.
In the battle for A AC supremacy, swim
ming and waterpolo stage one hell of a fight,
but the guys with the little numbered caps ul
timately come out on top. Waterpolo was
even voted the hottest team in all sports by
"Sports Illustrated for Women" a couple
years ago.
Roxy recently had the pleasure of "swim
ming" with one of these amphibious men and
was rewarded with an experience she'll never
forget. Roxy's only advice is that you keep
these boys in their native aquatic habitat.
Sure they're okay on dry land, but something
about wet environments... well, they just get
Roxy really wet. Still not a fan of the pool?
1 lead on over to the track.
If there's one thing Roxy desires, it's di
versity, so trying out the cross-country team
just had to be done. Give these boys a chance,
ladies. Besides, they've got an advantage no
other athletes can hope to match: endurance.
The only man who ever went eight times in
one night with Roxy was a runner. Yep, eight
times. Whew, Roxy's getting sore just think

ing about that night... Maybe it's time for
some tennis.
Tennis players make great lovers because
they're used to "giving" and "taking." First
it's your turn, then it's theirs, then it's yours
again! These boys make their living by
putting their balls in just the right spot, so it's
not a surprise they're good at putting other
things in just the right spot too. The back
and-forth of tennis too monotonous for you?
Try the high-flying gymnastics team.
Have you ever see one of these boys do an
unassisted keg-stand at a party? That alone
should tell you all the crazy things they can do
in the bedroom. Try this for an analogy —
gymnast: flexibility : : cross-country runner :
stamina. Think about it. You could have sex with
a gymnast in the back seat of a Mini Cooper and
still have the time of your life.
Hopefully Roxy didn't forget anyone special,
but it gets hard to remember all your lovers
when you've had the career that Roxy's had.
see, football, baseball, basketball, water
polo, cross-country, tennis, gymnastics. Wait, I
forgot the golf team!
Just kidding. Roxy would never have sex with
the golf team. A girl's got to have standards.
