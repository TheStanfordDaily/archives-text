### BRENDAN MARTEN, TAM VO SAM TANZER INTERMISSION EDITORS 
In the past. Intermission has always been
a bit "off" in terms of its coverage relative to
other sections. While News, Opinions and
Sports covered campus developments perti
nent to the everyday lives of students, Inter
mission saw things differently.
Why not theme a week's issue around an
insurgency growing within The Daily's ranks
rather than latest box office flop?
Why not send home an issue on sex to
every single parent of students in the Senior

Class?
Sure, we might have taken the hard road,
but it was also the one that was more strange
/ amusing / bizarre. And after all, you can al
ways open up "Entertainment Weekly" for
the 411 on the latest Link in Park release, err,
remix. But who's going to tell you about all
the stupid shit some drunk guy said while
being harassed by Tim Lipus at EBF?
Exactly.
Maintaining the momentum left over
from last volume's Communist revolution,
we did the unthinkable and seceded from
The Daily. Oscar statuettes invaded campus.
Pirates overthrew Communism and every

one got treasure-hunt booty. We got biblical
on your ass — as well as that of George
Burns. We analyzed the financial markets of
Stanford and gave you the dish on the world's
continental cuisine. We steered your mis
guided bodies towards fashionable futures.
We covered sex at Stanford, guided you
through 18 holes and told you that yes,
"Episode III" really did suck just like every
one expected it to (but not as badly as the
previous two).
While we didn't go mainstream, we didn't
get all obscure either. Instead, we found a
middle ground by talking a lot about a subject
on which we're very well informed: ourselves.

(We also covered people other than ourselves
from time to time. Grudgingly.)
And yes, we admit this volume had its mis
takes. Certain misspellings were made. Cer
tain layout issues remained unresolved — at
the time of publication. Editors randomly de
cided to go MIA for weeks at a time. Some
staffers even died (sort of).
But that's all in the past. What's done is
done. And just as the sun is about to set on
this volume of Intermission, we hope you'll
keep one thing with you, always: a good sense
of humor. Because if nothing else, you're re
ally going to need it the next time you run into
an Intermission Asshole at a Stanford party.
