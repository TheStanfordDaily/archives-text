# Baseball set to make case for NCAAs
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
It has been a very long time since the last
weekend of the regular season meant so much for
the Stanford baseball team. Coming into this
weekend's three-game series against the No. 24
USC Trojans (35-18,13-8 Pacific-10 Conference)
the (Cardinal (31-21,11-10) are tied for fifth place
in the Pac-1() and are fighting for their postseason
lives.
While last Saturday's dramatic 5-4 victory
over No. 8 Arizona may have been the game that
assures Stanford a playoff bid. the Cardinal don't
want to leave anything to chance.
"We're on the bubble of making the playoffs
and we basically need to win two games to guar
antee a spot," junior catcher John Hester said.
"We just have to play hard every game."

Winning two games certainly won't be easy
for the Cardinal, who travel to Los Angeles to
face a IJSC team that has won eight of its last
11 contests, including its two most recent wins
over No. 3 Oregon State and No. 11 Long
Beach State.
Key to the Trojans' success this season has
been their star pitcher, sophomore lan Kennedy.
Kennedy, who boasts a 10-2 record, a Pac-10 best
135 strikeouts and a 2.55 ERA, has been at the
top of the USC rotation all season long and leads
the Trojans in nearly every significant pitching
category.
For the Cardinal hitters, who have been incon
sistent at best throughout the regular season, get
ting the series going with a strong showing
against Kennedy is of the utmost importance.
"If we beat Kennedy on Friday I think we're in
good shape," sophomore third baseman Adam

Sorgi said. "1 think that if
we hit well on Friday it all
falls in place for us. Setting
the tone for the weekend
against a good pitcher is
going to be key for us. If
everybody can get a couple
hits off of Kennedy I think
it paces us for the weekend
to know that if we can beat
USC with Kennedy on the
hill we can beat USC with
anyone on the hill."
In a three-game set
with the Trojans earlier
this season, the Cardinal
fared well against
Kennedy, knocking him
around for three runs in 4
1/ 3 innings of work.
Kennedy also walked five
batters and earned a no
decision.
A trio of Stanford
players also has experi
ence playing on the same
side as Kennedy. Kennedy
played for the U.S.

National Team last summer along with Stanford
junior second baseman Jed Lowrie, junior first
baseman John Mayberry Jr. and junior pitcher
Mark Romanczuk.
Romanczuk will get the starting nod tonight.
He lost the Friday night starter's role five weeks
ago. but has pitched well enough in his most
recent outings to regain the spot.
He will be battling a USC squad that also
presents a challenge on the offensive side. Junior
catcher Jeff Clement has been one of the most
efficient hitters in the country this season, batting
.351, while hitting 11 home runs and tallying 44
RBI.
Clement was recently named to the All-
America first team and is also a finalist for the
Golden Spikes Award, given out each year to the
top amateur baseball player.
While USC ranks in the bottom half of the
conference in runs, batting average and hits, the
Trojans' recent hot streak concerns the Cardinal.
"They're playing very well and we're still up
and down right now," Hester said. "We're just
going to have to see who shows up for us."
"If we play well and play within ourselves,
we're very capable of beating a good USC team,"
Sorgi said. "We've been battling ourselves a lot
this season. We know the season is on the line and
we're going to play our hearts out."
The Cardinal didn't let late season fatigue
quiet their bats last weekend, as the offense
racked up 14 hits in an 11-8 loss to Arizona in the
series finale.
"At this point you get taken over by adrena
line by trying to get into the playoffs," Sorgi said.
"You need to be 100 percent to beat good teams,
and they're going to be fired up too. I think we're
going to get our second wind and hopefully we
can make the playoffs and make a run from
there."
The postseason matchups will be announced
on Monday at 8:30 a.m. on ESPN2 and for the
first time since 1995 the Cardinal will likely not
be hosting a Regional.
"We're going to take whatever happens."
Hester said. "This year hasn't been the greatest
year, so whatever happens after this weekend
we'll just take it and make the best of it."
