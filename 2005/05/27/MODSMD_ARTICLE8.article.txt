## Study claims Web a danger to patients with eating disorders 
### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly four out of 10 teenagers
with eating disorders visit Web sites
that encourage their unhealthy
habits, states a study recently issued
by the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital. The Web sites provide tips
on how to lose weight more easily
and express pride in what they call a
"lifestyle choice."
The goal of the report — co-au
thored by Rebecka Peebles of the
division of adolescent medicine at
both} the $qhool of Medicine and Lu
cile. Packard Children's Hospital
and medical student Jenny Wilson
— was to look at the impact such
Web sites have on both adolescents
with eating disorders and their par
ents.
Last fall, the research team sent
out questionnaires to all 678 pa
tients treated for eating disorders at
the Stanford Hospital since 1997,
ranging in age from 10 to 22. For pa
tients under age 18, a consent form
was sent in a separate envelope for

parents to fill out as well.
The survey found that 39 percent
of the. subjects had visited Web sites
that encouraged eating disorders.
Moreover, the study found that
these patients tended to spend less
time on schoolwork and more time
in the hospital than those who did
not visit the Web sites. However,
Web site usage did not increase the
likelihood of major health issues, in
cluding osteoporosis, the length of a
disorder or reproductive capacity.
Peebles said that, surprisingly, the
majority of the people who use these
sites also frequent Web sites that
promote recovery from eating disor
ders. But the users who visited both
types of sites spent the least time on
schoolwork and were most likely to
be hospitalized than those who only
visited one type of Web site.
The researchers were also
shocked to find that two-thirds of re
spondents had learned new purging
and weight-loss tips from Web sites
that promoted eating disorders, and
