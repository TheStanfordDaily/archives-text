# Panel recommends divestment
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University's Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility, or APIR. recom
mended on Tuesday to divest from four com
panies because of their alleged links to the
Sudanese government.
The next University body to vote on di
vestment will be the Board of Trustees Sub
committee on Investment Responsibility,
which will issue its own recommendation to
be presented to the Board ofTrustees in early
June. The Board will make the final decision
on the matter.
The panel also approved administrative
changes, including the creation of a Web site
that would allow community members to ex
press reservations about investment deci
sions.
The recommendation was a victory for
student organizations, such as the Stanford
Coalition for Investment Disclosure, or
SClD,and Students Taking Action Now: Dar
fur, or STAND, which have been vocal in
their disapproval of Stanford's investments.
The recommendation pertained specifi
cally to the oil companies PetroChina, ABB
Ltd. and Sinopec.as well as weapons supplier
Tatneft. STAND leaders claim that the Uni
versity currently has about $1 million invest
ed in PetroChina.
The controversy over investments in com
panies tied to the Sudanese government has
not been limited to Stanford.
Last month. Harvard decided to divest
about $4.4 million in shares of PetroChina,
and earlier this month the Illinois General
Assembly passed a bill to suspend state in
vestment in companies doing business with
the Republic of Sudan.
Co-terminal student and APIR member
Anna Mumford. who is also a member of
SCID, said that there was "lots of verv heated

discussion over Darfur" at Tuesday's meet
ing. She said that it took a long time to bring
the issue of divestment to a vote even though
the recommendations went on to pass by sub
stantial margins.
" llie people running the meeting were in
the minority,so they tended not to let the ma
jority voices speak or take a vote," Mumford
said.
Graduate School of Business Prof. George
Parker, the chair of the panel, is in New York
and could not be reached for comment. Park
er will present the results ofTuesday's vote to
the Subcommittee on Investment Responsi
bility.
The panel cast three separate votes relat
ed to divestment, Mumford said, all of which
passed. The first vote was in favor of "disin
vestment ," which means that Stanford would
not buy new shares of the companies, but
would hold on to the ones it already has. The
second vote was to divest from all four com
panies.
The third vote, to divest specifically from
PetroChina, was taken because some panel
members felt that a stronger case could be
made against the company, Mumford said.
Stanford does not disclose its investment
decisions, but Parker said in The Stanford Re
port April 27 that it is helpful to "presume
that the University has owned, does own or
might own all of the stocks that are publicly
traded."
On April 26, STAND presented a report
to the advisory panel urging Stanford to di
vest from the four companies, which all do
business in Sudan.
"We thought we had a pretty strong case,"
said junior lien Elberger, one of the leaders
of STAND. "We had met with many of the
members individually before the meeting,
and some of them had concerns about
