# Panel recommends divestment
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University's Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility, or APIR. recom
mended on Tuesday to divest from four com
panies because of their alleged links to the
Sudanese government.
The next University body to vote on di
vestment will be the Board of Trustees Sub
committee on Investment Responsibility,
which will issue its own recommendation to
be presented to the Board ofTrustees in early
June. The Board will make the final decision
on the matter.
The panel also approved administrative
changes, including the creation of a Web site
that would allow community members to ex
press reservations about investment deci
sions.
The recommendation was a victory for
student organizations, such as the Stanford
Coalition for Investment Disclosure, or
SClD,and Students Taking Action Now: Dar
fur, or STAND, which have been vocal in
their disapproval of Stanford's investments.
The recommendation pertained specifi
cally to the oil companies PetroChina, ABB
Ltd. and Sinopec.as well as weapons supplier
Tatneft. STAND leaders claim that the Uni
versity currently has about $1 million invest
ed in PetroChina.
The controversy over investments in com
panies tied to the Sudanese government has
not been limited to Stanford.
Last month. Harvard decided to divest
about $4.4 million in shares of PetroChina,
and earlier this month the Illinois General
Assembly passed a bill to suspend state in
vestment in companies doing business with
the Republic of Sudan.
Co-terminal student and APIR member
Anna Mumford. who is also a member of
SCID, said that there was "lots of verv heated

discussion over Darfur" at Tuesday's meet
ing. She said that it took a long time to bring
the issue of divestment to a vote even though
the recommendations went on to pass by sub
stantial margins.
" llie people running the meeting were in
the minority,so they tended not to let the ma
jority voices speak or take a vote," Mumford
said.
Graduate School of Business Prof. George
Parker, the chair of the panel, is in New York
and could not be reached for comment. Park
er will present the results ofTuesday's vote to
the Subcommittee on Investment Responsi
bility.
The panel cast three separate votes relat
ed to divestment, Mumford said, all of which
passed. The first vote was in favor of "disin
vestment ," which means that Stanford would
not buy new shares of the companies, but
would hold on to the ones it already has. The
second vote was to divest from all four com
panies.
The third vote, to divest specifically from
PetroChina, was taken because some panel
members felt that a stronger case could be
made against the company, Mumford said.
Stanford does not disclose its investment
decisions, but Parker said in The Stanford Re
port April 27 that it is helpful to "presume
that the University has owned, does own or
might own all of the stocks that are publicly
traded."
On April 26, STAND presented a report
to the advisory panel urging Stanford to di
vest from the four companies, which all do
business in Sudan.
"We thought we had a pretty strong case,"
said junior lien Elberger, one of the leaders
of STAND. "We had met with many of the
members individually before the meeting,
and some of them had concerns about
whether divestment was the correct
course of action, but in general it was
a pretty positive reception."
Sophomore Nikki Serapio, an
other leader of STAND, said the
group would welcome the opportu
nity to meet with individual mem
bers of the Board of Trustees before
the Board's next meeting.
Mumford said that — in the
course of debate at Tuesday's meet
ing— the opponents of thedivest
me'nt recommendation had several
different arguments.
First, they said that Stanford
should confront the companies di
rectly with its concerns instead of di
vesting.The panel voted unanimous
ly to pursue this option as well.
The panel also passed several
changes that do not require the ap
proval of the Board of Trustees,
Mumford said.
One of these changes is the cre
ation of a Web site that would allow
community members to access
forms to request reviews of specific
companies that Stanford may be in
vested in.
The Web site will also contain in

formation about how Stanford votes
on non-binding shareholder refer
endums for the individual compa
nies.
"Putting this information out
there will mean that students and
community members can be much
more involved in the process," said
senior Rafi Ginsburg, a member of
SCID. "Right now, if a student wants
to bring a complaint it takes a pretty
extraordinary effort on their part."
The panel also requested money
from the Office of the President to
hire student researchers to gather in
formation about specific companies.
Mumford said she believed that
the involwmertt of certain faculty
members who came out in favor of
divestment had been influential in
the decision.
She singled out English Prof.
Elizabeth Tallent, who attended the
STAND presentation on April 26,
and the 21 faculty members and
graduate students who signed an
open letter to the advisory panel that
was printed in ITie Daily on April 27.
"The people in power are used to
students doing crazy things as long
as it doesn't disrupt things too
much," Mumford said. "But when
they saw faculty members getting in
volved I think they realized that this
was something they needed to take
seriously."
