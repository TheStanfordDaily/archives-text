STAFF WRITER
Success for the Stanford graduate can he defined in
many ways. Entering a prestigious graduate school, landing
a job at a hot firm.saving lives at an accomplished NGO —
many take these paths oft-traveled.
Others, such as Brad Wolfe. Class of 2(X)2. take an un
conventional route the moment they step out the Farm's
cozy boundaries. Wolle — who started playing guitar in
high school and performed at the CoHo while majoring in
American Studies and co-terming in the Organizational
Behavior program — will be debuting his lirst album,
"Brad Wolfe and the Moon"on June 10.
But don't confuse Wolfe with your average aspiring
rock star. I lis inspiration for several songs on his album is a
close friend. Sara Laßoskey. for whom he named the song
"Sara's Got a Sunbeam."
Laßoskey died at age 22 from Ewing's sarcoma, a rare
form of bone cancer. Wolfe came up with "Sara's Got a Sun
beam" when Laßoskey was first diagnosed with cancer. I le
played it for her during her stay at Stanford 1 lospital.
"That was one of the few things that seemed to have any
impact" in making her feel better, he said.
Unfortunately. Laßoskey lost her battle with Ewing's
sarcoma after radiation, surgery and chemotherapy proved
unsuccessful. Her memory continues to be inspiration for
both Wolfe's lyrics and his music.
"When someone who is close to you passes away, it
makes you realize what's more important to you in life." he
said, "l or me. that's music. I felt like I owed it to Sara and
myself to see what I could do. and to share my music with
more people. You need an inspiration, and I have a really
good one. [Music] is the best way I know how to make a
difference. 1 "
In addition to inspiring Wolfe to pursue music profes
sionally. Laßoskey's battle also motivated her group of
friends to create the Sunbeam Foundation, dedicated to
funding research for childhood bone cancer.Ten percent of
the Sunbeam foundation's initial charitable donations will
come directly from Wolfe's music profits. Furthermore, his

CD release party on June 10 will mark the first event to
benefit the Sunbeam Foundation.
For the party, Wolfe's band. Brad Wolfe and the Moon,
after which the CD is self-titled, will perform at the Great
American Music Flail in San Francisco. The venue, which
will be the place of his biggest concert to date, seats 650
people, and Wolfe said that he hopes to sell it out.
Wolfe said he and Laßoskey's other friends decided to
create the organization after realizing that there was no or
ganization solely devoted to researching childhood and
adolescent bone cancer.
"There hasn't been any new development in Ewing's
sarcoma in the past 20 years, which is pretty shocking con
sidering how far medicine has come," Wolfe said.
The foundation is already working with Stanford, which
just hired a Harvard professor who developed the "mouse
model" for Ewing's sarcoma. It has also found one person
interested in pledging $3(),(KK) for the cause.
Wolfe said that although the Sunbeam Foundation plans
to focus solely on funding research, "research is not just a
vacuum. It has implications that are far more reaching."
He also said that in the future the group hopes to organ
ize large national events, such as Relay for Life, along with
more local events.
Long-term goals include founding a bone cancer center
and ultimately finding a cure for the cancer that took his
close friend away. Wolfe's success has been hard-earned.
He has spent the past years at clubs in San Francisco, such
as Red Devil Lounge, Sweetwater Saloon and Pure 23.
He also has established a "home base" at the club
Tongue and Groove,playing at least once a month,after his
first performance opening up fora fellow Stanford gradu
ate attracted a large crowd of friends.
Wolfe's career is managed by 22-year-old Michael Cole
man. the younger brother of an ex-girlfriend, who has
worked as an assistant with Aerosmith in Boston and has
video-edited with Green Day. Coleman helps Wolfe book
shows, network with other bands, manage the press, main
tain his Web site and create merchandise.
Wolfe also receives support from his band members,
who make up the six-piece band and play instruments
ranging from the electric guitar to the mandola.
Wolfe says that among them, there's always "a lot of
jamming" and a "really positive, upbeat attitude."
As a possible future business school applicant, he also
gets a chance to play with the "huge business component"
of his career.
"Going to Stanford is serving me very well," he said.
After his debut show in San Francisco, Wolfe will perform
throughout California,making significant stops in Santa Bar
bara and Los Angeles, and will aim fora record deal.
In the meantime, Wolfe said he will continue working
on his lyrics, which allow him to immortalize his memories
of Sara and allow him to express his life philosophies in
general.
"My message overall is just about living in the moment
and appreciating life for what it is," he said.
Wolfe, whose music career will most likely be deter
mined by this debut album and summer tour, is studying
for the LSATs and GM ATs in the meantime.
"Music is a tough road to keep going on when you're
not making enough money." he said.
But there are perks to being a rock star. For starters,
there are the fans.
"High school fans are the best," he said. Wolfe admitted
to staying up to an hour and a half after shows to sign auto
graphs, to which he said,"l'm a little bashful about."
But Wolfe said he refuses to simply write off his fans as
adoring strangers. \
"My music is a reflection of myself so if people are con
nected to it, then I feel like 1 already know them," he said.
"Sometimes there is a disconnect between the music and
the artist, but not for me."
