Want to write open
source this summer?
Want to make money?
Want to do both?
The open source model of software development is one of the most effective
innovations of all time. Who doesn't love the idea of great programmers working on
their own time to crank out elegant code that benefits us all?
"Summer of Code," Google's latest open source initiative, is expressly designed
to get the brightest minds on campus contributing code to open source initiatives
and inventing new open source programs. After all, while altruistic motives are
praiseworthy and the rewards of peer recognition sweet, the idea of a financial prize
for stellar work predates the Nobel Commission - and who really needs money more
than broke college students?
So here's the skinny: we'll give $4,500 to applicants who successfully work with
a sponsoring organization or advisor to create innovative or useful open source
software. We'll also get you a t-shirt to go along with the cash.
Visit code.google.com/summerofcode.html to learn more and submit your idea fora
project. The deadline for applications is June 14, 2005.
