## Felt's grandson, a Stanford alumnus, fields questions from the press Watergate informant identified 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Nick Jones, Class of 2003, has discovered
a new reason to admire his grandfather,
Mark Felt — recently identified as Deep
Throat, The Washington Post's famous
informant responsible for blowing the lid off
the Watergate scandal, which caused

President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974.
Deep Throat, considered by many to be
the most important anonymous source ever
quoted, has long been one of journalism's
greatest mysteries, according to Vanity Fair
magazine, which broke the story. Felt, now
91 -years-old, kept his role in the scandal
under raps for more than 30 years until yes
terday, when writer John D. O'Connor

announced his identity to the public.
The revelation doesn't come as a com
plete surprise since Felt — who was the
number two official at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation during the Nixon administra
tion — would have had access to the infor
mation that was revealed to reporters Bob
Wtxxiward and Carl Bernstein.
In an interview with The Daily,
Jones said that not even Felt's imme
diate family knew of his role in tear
ing down the Nixon administration
until a few years ago. The family has
still not released an official response
about when, exactly, they learned
Felt's secret, he added.
In 1972, five men affiliated with
the Republican National Party —
some of whom were later found to be
directly involved with the Committee
to Re-elect the President — broke
into the National Democratic
Committee's headquarters, located in
a Washington, D.C. office-hotel build
ing called Watergate. Nixon denied
accusations that his administration
hired the men to help swing the polls
in his favor. He was re-elected fora
second term and the scandal faded for
a short while.
During the summer and fall of
1973, however. Woodward and
Bernstein wrote a number of articles
that contained incriminating informa
tion regarding Nixon's connection to

the burglary. The seemingly outra
geous facts were confirmed and some
were even volunteered by a public
official who insisted his identity be
protected, according to the Vanity
Fair article.
Felt was giving reporters "informa
tion on deep background," CNN
reported yesterday."The Deep
Throat nickname, coined by a Post
editor, was a play on the phrase and a
popular porn movie by the same
name."
Only Woodward, Bernstein and
Benjamin C Bradlee, the executive edi
tor of The Post at the time, knew the
face behind the Deep Throat alias,
Jones said his grandfather chose not
to disclose his identity to anyone else
until recently because "he was con
cerned about being an honorable guy."
"He knew he had done the right
thing in unveiling the Watergate scan
dal, but when you work for the FBI.,
everything is confidential," Jones said.
"Taking information to the press is
breaking the FBl's number one rule,
and he wanted to protect the organi
zation."
Felt also feared for his personal
safety and that of The Post reporters,
O'Connor wrote in his article. Jones
confirmed this fact.
The long-awaited truth about

Deep Throat has proved to be elec
trifying. Jones said that reporters
have been calling his family all day,
proposing to pay them for extra pic
tures and interviews. Although
Vanity Fair reported that Jones'
mother, Joan Felt, at one point
thought profits from publicity could
help pay her children's tuitions, the
family has decided not to accept any
money, Jones said.
"We're mainly just in it to honor
my grandfather," Jones said. "There
have been offers of money, but that's
not what this is about."
In a family statement which he read
to the press, Jones said, "I guess people
used to think Deep Throat was a crim
inal, but now they think he's a hero."
After years of stress and silence,
the attention does not seem to be
bothering Felt, who now resides in
Santa Rosa. Indeed, The New York
Times reported yesterday that when
he greeted media representatives, he
said, "Hey, look at that. We appreciate
you coming out like this,"
Although Felt is finally enjoying
honor and respect, Jones told the
press that his grandfather hopes other
FBI employees who risk their lives to
benefit the country receive more rev
erence.
