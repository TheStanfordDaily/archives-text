# Students question ROTC policy
## 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A recent article in The Stanford Review
advocating the reinstatement of the Reserve
Office Training Corps, or ROTC, on
Stanford's campus has created a stir and has
led some students to question the
University's current policy toward the pro
gram.
Whether or not ROTC should exist at
Stanford has been a point of debate since
1969, when the Faculty Senate stripped
ROTC instructors of their titles as faculty
members and refused to offer students cred
it for the program's courses.
As a result, students who currently partic
ipate in the ROTC must travel to nearby
campuses to take their classes. The Navy and
Marines have to go to Berkeley, while Army
students go to Santa Clara University and
Air Force students go to San Jose State.
Though the decision took place amidst
strong anti-war sentiment, the University
cited ROTC's weak academics as its reasons
for not recognizing courses in military sci
ence.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein, who
helped lead the movement against the
ROTC, said that those who claim that anti
war sentiment played a large role in the
removal of the ROTC from campus are
"not wrong — that was an important moti
vating factor — but then people began
looking closely at ROTC and saw that it
was a cluster of anomalies."

For one thing, the program provided its
own teachers, and many of the instructors
were not trained to meet Stanford's stan
dards.
"If one actually read the books that were
being used, they were at the level of high
school sophomores," Bernstein said, adding
that he himself was enrolled in the ROTC
when he was in college and that his classes
had "the intellectual depth of a high school
freshman course."
He said the simplicity of the course was
"not atypical of the time."
"I don't think it was atypical of the teach
ing here [at Stanford]," he said.
Bernstein and other critics also found that
the ROTC courses were closed to the public
so that no one could audit them like almost
any other classes at Stanford.
Countering these arguments, freshman
Jake Suyderhoud, the author of The
Review article, pointed out that Stanford
students have the opportunity to take many
classes for credit that are not taught by doc
torate-holders and are not exactly academ
ically rigorous, such as posture, yoga or hip
hop dance.
Sarah Bradford, a freshman involved in
Air Force ROTC at San Jose State, said that
she initially became involved in the program
because she had applied fora scholarship,
but also finds it to be "a character builder."
John Patrick Bennett, a sophomore living
in Theta Delta Chi, is an ex-Air Force ROTC
member.
"I've always wanted to be involved with a

military career in some capacity," he said. "1
feel more people need to be involved and
serve their country in ways that most people
are not willing to do."
Bradford said her commute to San Jose is
"not horribly inconvenient."
"I get rides with other cadets, but I cannot
get as involved as 1 want to because 1 can
only get involved when other people want
to," she said.
The reason Bennett had to drop out of the
Air Force ROTC last year was because the
three trips a week to San Jose State did not
fit into his schedule.
"I think it would be a positive if they
allowed ROTC to return to campus," he said.
"1 think there are lots of people like myself
that would be involved if it were located on
campus. It is a disservice to the country and
to the military service as a whole not to allow
that."
Bernstein said he is disappointed that
ROTC has to be such a nuisance for students.
"I, as an adviser of students, do feel
aggrieved that it is such an inconvenience for
these students to do ROTC," he said.
Yet, he suggested that the Army and other
ROTC organizations could easily rent rooms
at Palo Alto High School to teach their
courses and rent out the school's fields to
march.
"They do not make it easy, either,"
Bernstein said.
Currently, there is no significant student
movement to reinstate the ROTC on
campus. Only a few dozen students
are involved with the ROTC, but
Suyderhoud suggested that the num
bers would probably increase if there
was no commute involved.
However, if a movement were to
gain momentum, it would likely
encounter significant opposition.
Several years ago, every academic
department met to review ROTC
courses and see if they met
Stanford's requirements. With only a
few exceptions, the answer was no.
Aside from academic reasons, the
University sticks to its decision
because of the military's "don't ask,
don't tell" policy regarding homosex
uality, which is seen as directly con
tradicting to Stanford's nondiscrimi
nation policy.
Though Bernstein still opposes
the ROTC, he said that he does not
hold an anti-military position.
"I willingly teach people in the
graduate program from the United
States military who then go back to
West Point to teach," he said. "I don't
view what they do in any way as
immoral, but I would not want the
West Point curriculum to be the
Stanford curriculum."
