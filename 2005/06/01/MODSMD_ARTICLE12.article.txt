# Hoover Fellow to advise Defense Dept.
## Anderson to share his expertise on military pay 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Hoover Institution Fellow Martin
Anderson has been appointed to the recent
ly established Defense Advisory Committee
on Military Compensation, which will advise
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on
approaches to cost-effective military pay
and benefits and to strategies in attracting
new recruits.
Anderson has worked at the Hoover
Institution since 1971 and has worked on the
campaigns of Presidents Richard Nixon and
Ronald Regan, former California Gov. Pete
Wilson, U.S. Senator Bob Dole and
President George W. Bush. He has also

served on a number of governmental adviso
ry bodies, including the Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board and the Economic Policy
Advisory Board, both under Reagan.
The formation of the Defense Advisory
Committee comes at a time of crisis for mil
itary recruiters. The Army and Marine Corps
have been falling short of their monthly
recruitment quotas, according to an editorial
in The New York Times last Sunday entitled
"The Death Spiral of the Volunteer Army."
"The recruitment chain that has given the
United States highly qualified, highly skilled
and highly motivated ground forces for the
three decades since the government aban
doned the draft has started to break down,"
the editorial stated.
The seven members of the committee
were chosen for "their preeminence in the
fields of military compensation," reported a
Hoover Institution press release. Anderson
is the editor of "Registration and the Draft,"

a 1982 compilation that deals with the chal
lenges and advantages of an all-volunteer
military.
The committee also includes retired mili
tary officers, professors of economics and
government and a management-compensa
tion consultant.
The group met for the first time on May
11 and discussed, among other things, the
appropriate way to balance cash compensa
tion with more indirect forms, such as col
lege tuition credits. They will meet again on
June 7 in Virginia.
Anderson graduated from Dartmouth
College in 1957. He earned a doctorate in
industrial management from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1962 and worked as a finance professor at
Columbia's Graduate School of Business in
the 19605.
Anderson could not be reached for com
ment by press time.
