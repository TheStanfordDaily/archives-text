Normally. I'm a procrastinator. but with the
postgraduate future looming large, I've
launched a pre-emptive strike. Over lunch with
my friend Puck, 1 threatened to disown her if
she gets married before the age of 30. "Don't

even get engaged," I snarled.
"No serious dating till 25." 1
brandished plastic utensils
and used the word "ex-com
municate" at least six times.
She didn't seem to care.
Fortunately, Puck's mom
seems to be on my side. Mrs.
Chen is giving the smack
down to anyone who's not
Chinese or sports a "pineap-

pic head" of spiked hair. Most importantly, it's
a no-go for guys under 5" 10". Puck's crush
comes in at around 5'6". When Mrs. Chen
called in the middle of lunch. I tried to call at
tention to this problem.
"A tall guy with no teeth or a shorty?"!!'
said. "Ask your mom."U
"My mom says that's ridiculous." Puck an
swered. "She says: EW ho has no teeth?"
The parental prejudice certainly poses
some difficulty for Puck, hut 1 don't have any
illusions about the end result. Puck's mom will
change her mind eventually, or. as Puck re
minds me, she might just meet a tall Chinese
guy and take him fora haircut.
I can't blame her for her self-assurance.
We've been friends since kindergarten, when
we once shared fruit snacks and crushes on the
same whiny boys. Puck used to be shy and in
secure — now she's confident, poised and
happily settled on a career in nursing. She has
also prepared names for four kids.
But while the past can claim great progress,
what we face is the future — and 1 can only
think of decline. Soon Puck will be responsi
ble, busy, slightly prudish. She won't have time
to meet up, except when she's dragging her
kids from piano to hockey, reminding them
and me to watch our language.
Preschool,grade school, high school,college.
Graduation marks the end of all natural pro-
