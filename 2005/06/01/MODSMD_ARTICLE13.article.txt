## Water in the Milk Bottle Toothless men and other landmarks to come 
### 
Normally. I'm a procrastinator. but with the
postgraduate future looming large, I've
launched a pre-emptive strike. Over lunch with
my friend Puck, 1 threatened to disown her if
she gets married before the age of 30. "Don't

even get engaged," I snarled.
"No serious dating till 25." 1
brandished plastic utensils
and used the word "ex-com
municate" at least six times.
She didn't seem to care.
Fortunately, Puck's mom
seems to be on my side. Mrs.
Chen is giving the smack
down to anyone who's not
Chinese or sports a "pineap-

pic head" of spiked hair. Most importantly, it's
a no-go for guys under 5" 10". Puck's crush
comes in at around 5'6". When Mrs. Chen
called in the middle of lunch. I tried to call at
tention to this problem.
"A tall guy with no teeth or a shorty?"!!'
said. "Ask your mom."U
"My mom says that's ridiculous." Puck an
swered. "She says: EW ho has no teeth?"
The parental prejudice certainly poses
some difficulty for Puck, hut 1 don't have any
illusions about the end result. Puck's mom will
change her mind eventually, or. as Puck re
minds me, she might just meet a tall Chinese
guy and take him fora haircut.
I can't blame her for her self-assurance.
We've been friends since kindergarten, when
we once shared fruit snacks and crushes on the
same whiny boys. Puck used to be shy and in
secure — now she's confident, poised and
happily settled on a career in nursing. She has
also prepared names for four kids.
But while the past can claim great progress,
what we face is the future — and 1 can only
think of decline. Soon Puck will be responsi
ble, busy, slightly prudish. She won't have time
to meet up, except when she's dragging her
kids from piano to hockey, reminding them
and me to watch our language.
Preschool,grade school, high school,college.
Graduation marks the end of all natural pro-


Grace Liu
gression. There are other landmarks
to come — first job, first house, first
marriage, first brat. But these things
could happen in any order, at any
time or not at all. No one knows —
and that's the menace. Graduation is
the gateway to the free-for-all of
adult experience. And 1 just can't
imagine what that will be like.
Walking through the mall after
lunch, 1 realized the narrow limits of
my clairvoyance. When the "1- this"
t-shirts are no longer amusing and
the slim-fit flares refuse to flatter
postpartum thighs, I can't even
imagine what we'll wear.
Nonetheless, we have plans, and
if our lives go accordingly, Puck will
be schooling her teens while I'm still
a hostelling vagrant, still pretending I
have rock-star potential and I'm just
about to write that novel. But what
will I do when the numbers cease to
flatter this lifestyle? Will I be forced
to renege on what I thought was an
eternal promise —to kick Puck if
she ever shops at Ann Taylor Loft?
But if change is unpredictable,
maybe it will turn out well. Maybe
fashions for the 40-ish will morph
into the grail of hipness. Maybe the
new generation of soccer moms will
keep their single friends. Maybe, for
old times' sake, Puck will refrain
from strangling me when I show up
at her baby shower and say for the
five-hundredth time that kids are
sticky and creepy. Or maybe I will
learn to hold my tongue. Maybe, I'll
even change my mind.
Meanwhile, I'll just keep calling
Puck and enjoying our friendly, for
ward-looking conversation. I've al
ready got the next one ready: "What
about a tall albino?" I expect to get
the blanket answer her mom has
been resorting to.
"My mom says: That is a hypo
thetical. I will not try to answer any
hypotheticals."

I might never come back to Stanford.
I might never go back to school. This
might be the last column I ever write,
and in 10 years, scientists might find a
way for me to thrive entirely on cake.
If you would like to address any of
these hypothetical, e-mail me at
igliu@stanford.edu. Thank you for
reading. Have a wonderful life.
