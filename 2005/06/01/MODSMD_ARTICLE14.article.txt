# 'Saving Face' portrays unconventional love story
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Movie producers and screenwriters are often hesitant to
deviate from the typical Hollywood love story: boy meets
girl, boy and girl overcome challenges, boy and girl live hap
pily ever after. And in true Tinseltown fashion — at least
historically — either the boy or girl is a well-known star and
is typically white.
But Alice Wu, Class of 1990, is daring to go beyond the
conventional. The film she wrote and directed, "Saving
Face," which made its debut in Los Angeles and New York
City on May 27, is a love story, but the similarities between
the typical romantic comedy and her film end there.
Wu, who grew up in San Jose to Taiwanese-born parents,
refused to have the movie's main characters played by white
Hollywood stars. The protagonist of the movie, played by
Asian-American Michelle Krusiec, is a young woman strug
gling to hide her love for another woman. The protagonist's
mother, played by Joan Chen, becomes pregnant and moves
in with her daughter, hiding a secret of her own. Both
women, in a traditional Chinese society, must fight to "save
face," or maintain the respect of those around them.
Living an unconventional life herself, Wu majored in
computer science at Stanford and also received a master's
degree in the same field in 1992.
"I secretly wanted to major in modern thought and liter
ature, but 1 did love computer science, and I wanted to be
able to pay the bills and take care of my parents," Wu said in
an interview with The Daily."! didn't think it would be pos
sible for me to become a writer. I remember my mom say
ing,"lf you prove a theorem enough.no one will question it.
but if you write a book, people can choose not to buy it."
After receiving her master's degree from Stanford, Wu
went on to work for Microsoft for five years as a program
manager at Cinemania and Music Central, and during that
time began to think of the idea for her story. She left Mi
crosoft in 1997 and enrolled in a screen-writing class at the
University of Seattle, where she wrote the first draft of "Sav
ing Face." She entered the script in a contest sponsored by
the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment, a film net
working group, and won. Wu then decided to take her
screenplay to the next level and met with a variety of pro
ducers. The challenge, she said, was finding someone who
shared her vision.
"1 felt very strongly about this story, so when I met with
someone who disagreed with me. it was easy to know that
this person and 1 were not trying to make the same story,"
she said."l feel very fortunate. Back then. 1 thought,"Hiis is
a Chinese-lesbian story — what are chances that it is ever
going to get made?"
Wu did find someone who would take a chance on her
story — and who convinced others to do the same — Teddy
Zee, then-president of Overbrook Entertainment, Will
Smith's production company. With additional financing
from Sony Classics Pictures,"Saving Face," was finally given
the green light for production.

Although Wu's film is a work of fiction, her characters
draw closely from her personal life.The main character, who
struggles with coming out. reminds Wu of herself. Wu came
out her senior year at Stanford, after taking History Prof.
Estelle Freedman's introductory feminist studies course.
"Estelle asked the class to write a coming out letter to
your parents," Wu said. "She wanted to give us the feeling of
what it would be like to come out. Most of the class was
straight — 1 certainly thought I was."
Wu went home that day and tried to avoid doing the as
signment until the last minute. She finally decided that if she
would even ever think of saying such a thing to her mother,
it would have to be in Mandarin. Given that she couldn't
read or write Mandarin fluently, Wu decided to create a
tape-recorded version of coming out to her mother, in Chi
nese, for her assignment.
"1 was living in this two-room double at the time and my
roommate also spoke Mandarin," Wu said. "1 didn't want
her to know what I was doing, so I blasted Cat Stevens'
music,in my room and then tape-recorded this thing in my
closet)After finishing this assignment, 1 wrote a long expla

nation to Estelle about why I decided to do the assignment
this way. At the end of four pages, I realized I was writing
that much because I was gay. There, I said it, I thought."
At the time, Wu struggled with exploring her sexuality
and being a part of the Asian-American community.
"1 was somewhat active in a3c [Asian American Associ
ation community] at the time and I thought I had a choice
between being Asian or being gay," she said. "I thought that
if I remained in the Asian-American community, I would be
the target of homophobia. And to some degree, 1 think that
choosing between different worlds is explored in my film.
The main character lives in thousands of worlds in a very
small geographic space."
Even though the story appears to be very specific to the
Asian-American or homosexual experiences, Wu said that
she hoped the story would be more universal.
"After my film debuted in film festivals, people would
come up afterwards and say,"lt's just like my Jewish family
or my Swedish family," she said. "If you strip away the cul-
