# Man's inheritance
## 
### 
When the dust has settled on the present world situation a very
interesting picture will present itself to the perceptive viewer. It will be
a picture which, in many respects, runs contrary to the general
understanding and apprehensions of many today. It is true that there
are many dangerous tensions and divisions which need insight and
care to resolve; there are also many problems which defy men's wis
dom to overcome, and which need an entirely new approach, so far
lacking. Equally, however, there are many signs of progress and new
realization on the part of men, many instances of a new and mature
wisdom in tackling the difficulties and uncertainties which surround
them. The panorama of life is not flat and one dimensional but is a
changing arena of stratified events, moving simultaneously and in
many directions. Thus, it is necessary to observe the main, and gen
eral, trends to understand the true happenings of the time. When one
can do so a different picture emerges of the present world scene and
its probable outcome.
Far from fulfilling the fears of so many today the future, We
believe, offers men the greatest possibility of progress and growth of
consciousness that, as a race, they have ever enjoyed. Nothing like the
coming opportunity has ever been presented to men. Never have so
many been ready to respond to that felicitous time. Never have We,

your Elder Brothers, been so sure of the outcome, and so firm in Our
resolve to work with men and to aid them in every way We can.
Vie approach Our task, not lightly but light of heart and eager of
mind, as We enter your lives to teach and to tend.
We invite you to listen to what We have to say and to work with
Us on your behalf. In this way, you will make fewer mistakes and avoid
blind alleys. Thus will the work of change and reconstruction be
unhindered and sure, and thus can all men take their places at Our
side and learn the arts of peace and love.
We are entering your lives not solely for men's guidance but also
as a step in Our own evolution; nevertheless, Our main effort will be
spent in helping men overcome the difficulties and mistakes of the
past, and to make best use of the opportunities presented to them as
the new era unfolds. We have every confidence that men, in their turn,
will show themselves to be apt and responsive pupils; that the light of
knowledge and wisdom that We bring will find resonance in their
hearts and minds; that when Justice has brought blessed Peace, men
will awaken to the ancient truths again and see that all men are One,
now and for ever; and, following that banner, will transform, gladly
and quickly, the fabric of life on Earth into the shining vision which
We know to be man's inheritance
