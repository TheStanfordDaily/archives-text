## Stellar Suggestions The final cornucopia
### 
The last week of spring quarter
is always the period of "almost
done." We are "almost done" with
classes. "Almost done" with the
honors thesis. "Almost done" with
heavy drinking and partying — or
at least until the finals are over.
Definitely "almost done" making
plans for the summer or the year
ahead.
As a proud member of the Class
of 2005, I am "almost done" with
Stanford. After this column, I will
be (not almost) done writing for
the health section of The Daily. For

better or for
worse, there will
be no more
quirky enter
taining pieces
about body hair
or snacks. And
this week, in
stead the usual
"easy reading"
Thursday col
umn, I am going
to do something
different.

My last column is about serious,
often unrelated, provocative things
that have been on my mind during
this "almost done" time. They may
or may not be directly relevant to
our health, but one day they could
certainly affect our well-being.
Every one of these topics deserves
a column of its own, but at this
point I am not ambitious or ener
getic enough to write them. Enjoy
my final cornucopia of unan
swered questions — especially
you, the Class of 2(X)5.
The most recent issue of the
Time magazine has dubbed our
year "The Class of 9 /11." Many of
my fellow seniors remember the
lengthy, slightly comforting, yet
also unnerving, e-mail that Univer
sity President John Hennessy sent
to the incoming freshman class
right before Orientation week.
Coming to Stanford four years ago,
we knew that we were the first gen
eration of college freshmen for
whom the world would never be
the same. There is no doubt that,
among other things, Sept. 11 has ir
revocably changed our college ex
perience. How will it continue to
impact our lives post-Stanford?
The biggest controversy of
2005: the Terry Schiavo case. Look
ing at that disgraceful and tragic
power struggle, it is tempting to get
caught in the rhetoric of ethics and
politics. Why aren't we addressing
the ultimate cause of Terry's death:
her eating disorder? It has been es
tablished that it was her desire to
conform to social norms of beauty
that led her to develop bulimia,
which in turn contributed to her
collapse several years ago. Is it just
me or should we be thinking more
about how to prevent this from
happening to other women in the
future?
Thanks to the Governator's ini
tiative, the promise of stem cell re
search has been recognized by the
state of California. As a self-pro
claimed pseudo-Marxist, I strongly
believe that the only reason why
Arnie has forsaken the right-wing
ideology to help science is money.
Over the next several years, stem
cell research is likely to become a
multibillion-dollar industry, and
without appropriate legislation,
the United States is not likely to
get a slice of that pic. The problem
with that reasoning is that market
mechanisms per se are not capable
of regulating potential abuse of
technology. Stem cell research
presents tremendous curative po
tential, but it could also have ab
horrent consequences.
Unfortunately, it is never im
possible to find demand for things
that we as a society consider unac
ceptable: commercial abortions of
female fetuses in India and China
are a good example. How should
stem cell research be regulated?
Why don't we ask that kid who al
ways ruined the curve in the Bio
Core...
Gay marriage, the re-election,
human rights, the new alcohol pol
icy, the FDA and emergency con
traception, disaster relief, the de
mise of Medicare — the list of im
portant social and health issues is
infinite, so pick your causes wisely.
So as my last farewell: Happy sum
mer and congratulations on anoth
er good year.
