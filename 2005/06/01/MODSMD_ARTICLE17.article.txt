# Another hit to the head?
## New concussion diagnostic tool puts players back on field faster 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
To power through a night of studying a couple of winters ago,
senior Marie Kobler braved the dark and walked down the steep
stairs of the Stanford house in Oxford to the to get a snack from
the kitchen. Sporting socks that made treading on the slippery
stairs difficult, Kobler slipped on the stairs and tumbled down, fi
nally hitting her head on one of the last steps. Kobler lost con
sciousness briefly — she can't remember exactly for how long —
before waking up with a dull headache. She finally mustered her

way into the kitchen and found help from her classmates, who
helped her determine the severity of her concussion.

Kobler's story is not unique. Every year, two million
people sustain head injuries, according to the National

Health Institute, or NIH. Most injuries are benign
enough that people require nothing more than care
ful observation over a few davs. but for those who

are not as fortunate — half a million people every
year — hospitalization is necessary.

A new diagnostic tool developed by Assistant
Prof. Michelle LaPlaca from Georgia Tech and
Prof. David Wright, assistant director of the
Emory University's Emergency Medicine Re
search Center may take the guessing out of the di
agnosing game, providing a way to diagnose pa-

Tientsin a quick and efficient manner.
According to the NIH Medline online library,
mild injuries usually require no specific treatment, but

the person should be kept awake at least 24 hours in

order to look out for serious symptoms. Such symptoms
may include vomiting, loss of consciousness, abnormal be-

havior, a stiff neck, severe headache or unusual drowsiness.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) can be used to
treat a mild headache, but aspirin use is discouraged because it
can increase the risk of internal bleeding.

Milder symptoms common in people who have a concussion
include difficulty concentrating; mild headaches; constant fa
tigue; sad, listless, anxious or irritated behavior, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the symptoms
may persist even after the day of the injury for some people, said
Jin Hahn, associate professor neurology and neurological sci
ences and of pediatrics at Stanford's School of Medicine.
"Some patients develop post-concussive syndrome," Hahn
said. "They develop mild neurological symptoms such as
headaches, decreased ability to concentrate or pay attention,
dizziness — they may have a constellation of these symptoms
where they are not able to function as well as they did before."
Post-concussive syndrome, however, is not a common in the
general population, explained Hahn.
"Many of the people who develop post-concussive syn
drome may have an underlying migraine disorder — it maybe
something in the injury triggers their migraine," he said.Treat
ment for post-concussive syndrome can include stronger
headache medication, as well as antibiotics if there is the possi
bility of a bacterial infection.
Injuries in the field: High-risk athletics
Athletes in certain contact sports are more likely to suffer
from brain injuries. According to the American Association of
Neurological Surgeons, 10 percent of college football players
sustain concussions every year. Other-high risk sports include
boxing, ice hockey, wrestling, gymnastics, lacrosse, soccer and
basketball. Co-terminal student Matt Janusz, who used to play
for the men's soccer team, once got a concussion during a soc
cer game.
"Someone took a shot at the ball, it defected from another
player's foot and hit me square in the face," explained Janusz. He
was taken to the emergency room fora series of tests and told not
to sleep fora couple of days. "They just told me not to play until I
felt completely fine and it turned out to be a very mild injury."
There is disagreement among athletic trainers, neurologists and
physicians about when players should be put back in the game after
a concussion. The American Academy of Neurology has developed

guide
lines that

place injuries on a three-level scale.
"When should players be put

hack in the field?" Paul Fisher, associ
ate professor of neurology and neuro-

logical sciences and of pediatrics at Stanford's School
of Medicine, asked rhetorically. "When they look nor-

' J ' J
mal to a trainer? To a physician? These are hard an
swers. The general rule of thumb is that the more severe the
injury, the longer they should be kept out of the game. But
there's not even firm criteria to determine how to grade an
injury — the field [of neurology] is nebulous and murky re
garding diagnosis."
TVainers and doctors usually run through a checklist to de
termine the extent of the injury, but trainers are still inconsis
tent when it comes to putting players back in the game after a
concussion, explained Fisher.
Some neurologists believe that players who have suffered
from several concussions should end their sports careers com
pletely, subscribing to the theory that several concussions can
lead to permanent brain injury, Fisher said.
"But there's no evidence that mild brain injuries are really
cumulative," he said. "People theorize that over time, you can
develop permanent cumulative brain injury, but you'll find dif
ferent opinions."
Fisher points to the example of Jamie Carey, who started out
at Stanford in 1999 as a star basketball player in her freshman
year. In November of 2(XX), Carey suffered a series of concus
sions in a short period of time, and she suffered from post-con
cussive symptoms that took her out of the game for twt> years.
Stanford's doctors could not clear her to play again, b*t they
referred her to doctors in Austin, Texas. Carey was finally
cleared to play and started as a point guard at the University of
Texas in 2(X)2.
"If it had been my daughter, I would have allowed her to play
again," said Fisher. "Unless the injuries are extreme, there's no
reason why some doctors should refuse players to play a game
they are passionate about."

New tool aids injury diagnosis
Diagnosing the grade of head injuries can be difficult — and
matters are only complicated when a trainer needs to make a
quick decision about a player's health in the middle of a game.
Wright and La Placa's, professor at Emory and assistant profes
sor at Georgia Tech respectively,diagnostic tool may allow in
jured athletes to 0
Their sensitive screening tool, termed the Display Enhanced
Test for Concussions and Mild TYaumatic Brain Injury System,
or DETECT, guides the patient through neuropsychological
tests that measure brain function. Developed for use in athletic
events, when the diagnosis must be made quickly in order to de
termine whether the player can jump back into the game after
a head injury, DETECT takes only seven minutes to execute.
Patients put on a pair of wraparound goggles that fit over the
face and place large earphones to tune out noise. They are then
given instructions through the headphones and use a hand-held
device to respond. The device tests response time, memory and
concentration.
"It is an immersive environment, such that audio and visual
distractions are eliminated / minimized," wrote LaPlaca in an e
mail. "The novelty of DETECT revolves around the portabili
ty, immersiveness and short length [of the tests]."
The researchers are still validating the device against stan
dardized tests that have been around fora longer period of
time, but are hoping to have the device in the sidelines in the
next couple of years.
