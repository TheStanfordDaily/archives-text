# Wheatgrass: Power food or waste of your money?

### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On campus, it is not unusual to see students
hitting up the vegan food bar at the Market
place at Wilbur, sipping soymilk at Stern or
making the trip to TYader Joe's for banana
chips and dried cranberries Other food venues
on campus also offer a variety of healthy op
tions. Jamba Juice, for example, whose lines at
Stanford often run out the door, offers a vari
ety of "boosts" that can be added to the
smoothies.
On the Jamba Juice menu is also an item
fewer students order, but some health food
mavens swear by: wheatgrass. Sold by the 2-oz.
shot, wheatgrass is marketed on the Jamba
Juice Web site as "liquid sunshine in one little
shot"; the Web site also boasts that it is a detox -
ifier and provides amino acids, enzymes, vita
mins and minerals
But does a shot of what is essentially a rela
tive of lawn grass really deliver what Jamba
Juice and other health food stores promise? Is
it worth your hard earned money?
According to Vivian Crisman, nutritionist
at Vaden Health Center, the health craze sur
rounding wheatgrass is more marketing than
truth.
"Wheatgrass is grass," said Crisman. "Most
often it's marketed as a blended shot [like at
Jamba Juice], boost or juice â€” and then it's
just liquefied chlorophyll."
Chlorophyll is a functional chemical in
plants that helps them turn the sun's rays into
glucose. But what exactly can liquefied chloro
phyll do for the human body? According to
Stanford Jamba Juice employee Angeline Gi
anfermo, a blended shot of wheat grass is a
juice that is "good for the skin and good for the
digestive system."
Living-food&com, a Web site that has infor

mation on all-natural and organic food prod
ucts, advocates wheatgrass as an antibiotic, ap
petite suppressant and energizer. According to
the site, the chlorophyll reacts with toxins in
the body's cells and tissues and brings them
into the bloodstream to be excreted at a later
time. The website also makes the claim that
wheatgrass acts as a deodorizer with the abili
ty to subdue the stench that comes with con
sumption of certain food and beverages or use
of tobacco.
But Crisman said these are merely "crazy
claims that aren't substantiated." The amount
of wheat grass in a shot is unlikely improve
your body's performance drastically, she
added.
"(Wheat grass juice] isn't loaded with pro
teins or vitamins or calcium or fiber," Crisman
said. "[Marketers of wheat grass] make these
bold claims, but they don't show up as facts on
the nutrition label."
Yet the substance still remains popular.
Jamba Juice first began marketing wheatgrass
as a blended shot five years ago, and according
to Gianfermo, there are 20 to 30 requests for
wheatgrass on campus each day.
Sophomore Hamida Hamza once tried a
shot of wheatgrass at Jamba Juice, but couldn't
stand the taste.
"It tasted awful," said Hamza. "And I don't
think it made me feel any better."
Crisman said that she thought the energiz
ing effects of drinking wheatgrass shots are
likely to be psychological.
"Any effect someone feels would proba
bly be the result of the placebo effect, but it's
hard to quantify," she said. "Asking some
one, 'do you feel a boost of energy after
drinking this?' isn't measurable. If you tell
someone that something is going to nappen,
you can't tell whether the effects are real or
perceived."
