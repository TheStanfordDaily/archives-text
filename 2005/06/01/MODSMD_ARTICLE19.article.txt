## Social Innovation The 						end of social innovation 
### 
All things must come to an end. and this
is the end for our social innovation column.
It's been a bumpy ride, but it was worth it in
order to make a simple point: Dedicated
and talented people can create positive so
cial change.
Since we're in college, we're expected to
know something about needless suffering
in the world — and even to care about it.
But there's little expectation to know about
solutions to this suffering. And there's even
less expectation to promote them in the
real world.
Fortunately, not everyone feels this way.
Every other week, we met "social entrepre-

neurs" who were, with
out a doubt, much cool
er than we are. Not only
did they know and care
about social problems,
they had practical ideas
about how to improve
them.
Is local poverty in
tractable? We met El
liott Brown, a Stanford
graduate who realized
that one of the biggest

Adam Stone and
Lija McHugh

problems that the poor face is not finding a
job — but creating a career. Brown started
Springboard Foward in East Palo Alto to
help end poverty through job-coaching and
support for the working poor.
Can technology really help the poor in
Brazil? We interviewed Melanie Edwards, a
Reuters Digital Vision fellow who realized
that Personal Digital Assistants, or PDAs,
could help the "invisible" poor of Brazil.
Her organization, Mobile Media, employs
Brazilian youth with PDAs to register the
uncounted people of Brazil for social serv
ices and benefits.
Is modern healthcare out of reach for
developing countries? We spoke with
David Green, who started Project Impact
to help bring down the prices of key med
ical products. He developed technologies
and production strategies aimed at maxi
mizing distribution — not profits. He does
this all while still making his businesses eco
nomically sustainable.
jftDo-consumers even care übout "fair
trade?" The social entrepreneur Paul Rice
started TransfairUSA to find out. After
working with farmers in Nicaragua for 11
years, he returned to the United States to
help market fair trade products. More con
sumers than ever are buying fair trade
goods that in turn help the farming commu
nities that create those products worldwide.
Is the issue of human rights best left to
the United Nations? Armed with video
cameras and expertise, Gillian Caldwell has
helped local organizations and individuals
to capture human rights abuses on film. As
the executive director of WITNESS, she
works with local communities and NGOs to
film human rights abuses, using the footage
as leverage to create change.
One last one: Is it possible to help start
small businesses in Africa? Stanford gradu
ate and engineer Martin Fischer helped to
do just that. With his organization Appro-
TEC, he created and marketed water
pumps in Kenya that allow people to grow
crops throughout the year. It has helped
tens of thousands of Kenyans increase their
income ten-fold.
So when we say these people are cooler
than we are, we mean it. Collectively, these
entrepreneurs and their organizations have
improved the lives of thousands of people
who otherwise would have gone without
basic life necessities.
Why don't we hear more about the solu
tions to the problems? In part, because
there are no perfect solutions. No one
thinks they have "solved" poverty or
human rights abuses or unfair trade. No one
thinks that their solutions didn't also cause
some problems elsewhere.
But that didn't stop them, and it should
n't stop us. There are no perfect circles or
perfect term papers or perfect business
plans — but this doesn't stop us from de
signing, writing or creating. Everything has
a cost, and everything has a flaw. The ques
tion is, on balance, are we doing the best we
can?
Before we go, we would like to thank
some people who helped us put together
this whole thing. Thanks to all the students
in FUSION (in particular to Tony Wang)
and to all the people and organizations we
interviewed, bothered, etc. We appreciate
it.
Finally, thanks to all the people who e
mailed us and approached us to tell us how
meaningful this column has been to them.
This support and interest in our column and
interviews has made us feel that the entire
effort has been worth it.
Is this the end of social innovation?
Graduation marks the end of our time with
this column, but not social innovation.
Rather, graduation marks the beginning —
when students stop being students and,
with luck, become advocates for positive
social change.

Adam Stone (Class of 2003) and L.ija
McHugh (Class of 2005) are finally graduat
ing and will hopefully go do good things in
the world. If you consider yourself to be social
and innovative and are thus interested in writ
ing this column next year, e-mail them at as
tone@stanford.edu and
lmchugh@stanford. edu.
