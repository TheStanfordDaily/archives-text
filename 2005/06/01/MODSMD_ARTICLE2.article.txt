# Grad students to move to Mirrielees

Due to a housing crunch, graduate students will move into
Mirrielees in the fall. The decision to open the dorm to gradu
ate students was made at the start of this quarter in response
the high number of undergraduate vacancies expected in the
fall, said Todd Benson, director of housing assignment services.
"We have graduate students who apply for housing for the
fall, but they are unable to get it,"he said. "Currently, we have
about 300 unassigned grad students waiting for housing next
fall. If there are vacancies in housing on campus, then we'd
like to give spaces to the students who need them."
Benson added that graduate students will be placed in one
wing on one floor of Mirrielees, which would not constitute "a
significant number of spaces." Two people will inhabit each of
these apartments and the board fee will be equivalent to the
rent fora two-bedroom apartment in Escondido Village.
Graduate students will only be allowed to live in
Mirrielees during the fall and are expected to move at the end
of the quarter.
"There will be on-campus housing guaranteed for them
after the autumn quarter," Benson said. "If the students
would like to stay on campus, then we will assign them else
where, and there will be spots open in other grad residences."
Some undergraduates, however, were dismayed at the idea
of graduate students inhabiting the extra spaces.
"I did not get a low draw number, and my draw group was
considering Mirrielees as one of our top choices," said sopho
more Kopal Kulkarni. "But once we heard that graduate stu
dents would be living in Mirrielees, and it would be harder for
undergraduates to get into Mirrielees, we felt a bit discour
aged about drawing in there."
Benson denied that the change impacted the housing lot-
