# Podcasting: Journalism for the masses?
## 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
Mehdi Yahyanejad. a post-doctoral fel
low specializing in bioinformatics at Stan
ford. typically spends Thursday evenings
with a microphone and a laptop computer.
He and Ahmad Anvari, an engineer in Sili
con Valley, record a weekly Farsi language
news program on American culture, politics
and technology called "Haftegi" (which
means "weekly" in Farsi) from their living
rooms.
Thanks to podcasting, a way to publish
sound files to the Internet, anyone with a
computer can become an audio news com
mentator from his or her own home. The
technology allows listeners in Iran — and
anywhere else in the world — to download
Yahyanegad and Anvari's show directly to
their iPods (or any other MP3 player) and
tune in.
Podcasting differs from broadcasting or
webcasting because listeners subscribe to
podcast feeds using aggregator software
such as iPodder or RSSRadio.This software
works much like TiVo does for recording
TV shows: Users program the software to
automatically record certain podcasts onto
their computers, and when they plug in
their iPods or MP3 players, the podcasts
sync with the computer.
While the number of households that lis
ten to podcasts is about 300,()()(), according
to Forrester Research, a marketing re
search company, that number is expected to
grow to 12.3 million by 2010. With this sort
of scale, major radio networks, who may ex
perience some competition, are taking no
tice.
Last month San Francisco radio station
KYCY-AM. owned by radio industry giant
Infinity Broadcasting Corp.. decided to em
brace the new media form, converting its
syndicated talk show content to an all-pod
cast format. Billed as "KYOURadio," pod
casters are able to submit their programs on
the radio station's Web site for broadcast at
1550 AM or on the Internet.
"The idea came from our executives in
the programming and marketing depart
ments," wrote Karen Mateo, Infinity's vice
president of communications, in an e-mail
to The Daily. "We experiment with differ
ent formats'nil the-lime at our radio stations
and are always looking for ways to inte
grate new technologies into our core busi
ness. We had an opportunity to take an un
derperforming station in the San Francisco
market and experiment with a new idea to
radio. 'Podcasting' is an interesting and
compelling radio format, and we are
thrilled with the early response and quality,
including audio and content, of the pod
casts."
However, it still remains to be seen
whether KYCY's ratings will improve over
the long term with the podcasting experi

ment. There are enough people interested
in blasting their voices over the Web or on
air — the challenge is finding quality con
tent among the large quantity of podcasting
shows submitted.
"Quality content [in podcasting] is pret
ty hard to find," said Shannon Snow, a grad
uate student in communications, who is fin
ishing a masters project on podcasting.
"People are really confined by the technol
ogy. People really want to do ambitious
things but are limited by the tools. A lot of
people are hacking it together."
But. for others, part of the appeal of pod
casting is its raw, unfiltered content and its
potential to become an alternative media
source.
"What makes podcasting [unique] is the
informal discussion." Yahyanejad said. "It's
not very produced. The problem with
[KYCY's] work is that they are selecting

what podcasts go through [on the air]."
Listeners who download podcasts di
rectly from the Internet have the ability to
pick and choose among special interest pro
grams, from shows devoted to discussing
Marilyn Monroe to Macintosh computers
to wine making. KYCY's producers will se
lect the programs they will feature on the
show, removing this aspect of choice.
Yahyanegad and Anvari have shown
that there is something for everyone. Their
show is the second podcast in Farsi in the
world and have a special niche among
Farsi-speakers.They said that they strive to
give Iranians a "more accurate representa
tion of what typical life is like in America
and how things work here" through com
mentary and interviews.
"Iranians in Iran are getting information
on the U.S. from the Iranian government or
from Iranian opposition groups or U.S.gov

ernment radio — Voice of America," said
Yahyanegad. "It's obvious that all of these
sources are not unbiased. The picture they
get out of it is distorted." As "citizen jour
nalists." Yahyanegad and Anvari maintain
that their podcast offers some middle
ground.
"There are a lot of people unhappy with
big media," said Yahyanegad. "What they
are interested in is not covered, so citizen
journalism can help."
"When [people] listen to podcasts, they
want to listen to something interesting that
they can't hear in big media," he added.
Snow is more reluctant to call podcast
ing "citizen journalism."
"The efforts are not quite there yet," she
said. "It has the potential but I still don't
think it has successfully become citizen
journalism. But everything changes so fast,
so it has the potential of becoming that."
