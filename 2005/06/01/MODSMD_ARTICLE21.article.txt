# Racing against the clock
## without a driver 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Drivers not required."
That's the motto adopted by the Stanford
Racing team and printed on the side of
"Stanley," the Volkswagen S.U.V. Touareg
that's been modified to drive without human
guidance. Fiut there's much more to Stanley
than its motto, which is a twist on the "Dri
vers wanted" slogan of Volkswagen. The
drive-by-wire vehicle boasts seven comput
ers in its trunk and a host of other safety and
perceptual features that its design team

hopes will propel its success in a 175-mile
race called the DARPA Grand Challenge.
The second-annual race, hosted by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or DARPA, is designed to develop
autonomous robot vehicle technologies for
military purposes and is offering a $2 million
prize to the first car to make it across a
course in the Mojave Desert in less than 10
hours. In the 2(M)4 race, the frontrunner, an
entry from Carnegie Mellon University,
went eight miles before crashing. However,
this year more and better-prepared teams
seem to be interested in the Challenge.

The Stanford Racing Team first started
developing Stanley in June 2004. under the
leadership of Sebastian Thrun, associate pro
fessor of computer science and head of the
Stanford's Artificial Intelligence Labs.
In early April of this year, Stanley's cre
ators were notified that they were one of 118
out of the 195 entries to receive a site visit.
Today, they will find out if they are one of the
40 teams to pass the second-to-last stage of
screening. Race day. October 8, will see just
20 cars competing.
To date, Stanley has logged 200 miles of
autonomous driving time, some of it on the
Mojave Desert route from the 2004 DARPA
Challenge. This year's path won't be an
nounced until two hours before the race,
though DARPA organizers have said that it
is in Southern California.
Stanley is a standard gray Touareg, donat
ed by Volkswagen and customized for drive
by-wire navigation and steering by Volkswa
gen of America's Electronics Research Lab
oratory in Palo Alto, one of the Stanford
Racing team's major collaborators. Its major
physical additions are oversized wheels, rein
forced bumpers and a protective plate on the
underside of Stanley's body Unlike some of
the golf carts, utility vehicles and other ma
chines that are among Stanley's competitors,
it is completely legal for driving on streets.
"That was an important design constraint
to facilitate the testing of the robot," said Ve
hicle Lead Cedric Dupont of Volkswagen in
a press release.
Members of the Stanford Racing team
have equipped Stanley with a GPS system
and sensors that can pinpoint its location
within two miles. Lasers give the car a vision
span of four car lengths ahead, while radar
allows it to search for further obstacles as it
reaches race speeds of up to 35 mph
Additionally, stereo-vision cameras take
pictures of the course that are used to deter
mine the optimal driving course by the seven
Pentium M laptops in the trunk, which have
their own shocks and back-up networks. The
computers are also hooked up to an elec
tronic break, throttle and steering system.
And the whole car, electronics and all. is
powered by a turbo diesel engine that will

run on a single tank of gas.
The most important component of Stan
ley's design is the sophisticated software,
which essentially drives the car. A computer
algorithm analyzes input from the sensors to
evaluate alternative paths for the car as
often as 10 times a second.
The first prototype of the car emerged from
a computer science class offered in fall quarter
of this year tided "DARPA Grand Challenge."
Most of the 40 some students involved in the
Stanford Racing team, who range from under
graduates to doctoral candidates, got involved
with the team through that course.
According to David Stavens, a doctoral
candidate in computer science, Stanley also
benefited from projects completed in the
winter quarter computer science class "In
troduction to Computer Vision."
Aside from encompassing students from
all over the School of Engineering, the Stan
ford Racing Team includes eight Stanford
professors, a post-doctoral researcher and 17
external members from all over the Bay
Area. The team is supported not only by
Volkswagen, but also by Mohr Davidow
Ventures (a local venture capital firm) and
Android, as well as by secondary contribu
tors Intel, Honeywell andTYZX.
While a strong performance in the Grand
Challenge is the Stanford Racing Team's first
goal, the hope is that the expertise developed
in building Stanley can be used in improving
the systems of commercial vehicles.
"After the contest, we are interested in
adapting Stanley's technology into safety
systems for commercial passenger cars,"
Stavens said.
Many new cars already feature automat
ed features such as anti-lock brakes, adap
tive cruise control and electronic parking
aids. The knowledge needed to create obsta
cle-avoidance and lane-keeping technolo
gies could come from the team's experience
building Stanley. The car itself would have
an extra set of reflexes.
"'lTie result," Stavens explained, "would
be a vehicle that watches what a human does,
reacting periodically and harmoniously with
the driver to address specific perceived safe
ty concerns."
