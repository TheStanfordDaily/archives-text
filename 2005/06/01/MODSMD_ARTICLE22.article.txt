## Gore to speak at fall GSB conference 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
This November, the Graduate
School of Business will be hosting
the 2005 Net Impact Conference,
the largest annual gathering in the
world for business students and
young professionals. The event will
focus on corporate social responsi
bility, social entrepreneurship,
community development and envi
ronmental management.
Net Impact, a career network
that offers membership fora
small annual fee to business
school students and professionals,
teaches members to drive social
change through business. The
Business School was selected
from among Net Impact's 103
chapters to host the conference,
which will take place from Nov. 10
to 13.
"The GSB is very pleased to be
the host site for this important
conference," said Robert Joss,

dean of the Business School. "As
a leading school of management,
we know effective social innova
tion requires good management,
and good management requires
social awareness and accountabil
ity. This conference presents a
great opportunity to showcase
Stanford's leadership in promot
ing work at this intersection of
management education and social
innovation."
First-year business student
Patrick Crosetto, an event organ
izer, said that about 1,350 people
are expected to attend.
The conference will feature
three keynote speakers, including
former U.S. Vice President A1
Gore. There will also be five
smaller lectures and 70 breakout
session panels which will address
the event's prominent themes â€”
business and the environment,
business in the nonprofit sector,
corporate social responsibility,
international development, lead
ership development, social entre
preneurship and socially respon
sible investing.
None of the speakers are being
paid for their appearances, organ
izers said.
"There is no financial incen
tive for speaking at the confer
ence," said Lisa Macholan, a rep
resentative from Net Impact who
is working with the GSB to plan
the conference. "Their incentive
is to address young business lead
ers that are looking to be cata
lysts of change in this growing
area. They want to encourage
people to go off and make
change."
Macholan said the conference
will also focus on exploring the
ways in which different organiza
tions can collaborate to make
socially and environmentally
sound decisions.
"This conference is about
being able to bring together the
various sectors of society, includ
ing the government, non profit
business and corporations," she
said. "The conference will
address the questions of how we
can work together to make sure
that we are making a positive
change in society."
Kirsten Olsen, a first year-stu
dent at the Business School and a
former Net Impact employee, is
in charge of the conference cur
riculum.
"The main mission of this con
ference is to equip the attendees
with the knowledge and tools to
go forth and practice responsible
business," she said. "This idea of
corporate social responsibility
that is at the heart of Net Impact
is something that a lot of business
schools are trying to address in
their curriculum. It's about hav
ing businesses look beyond the
bottom line and incorporate
things other than just profit into
decisions."
Christian Edvardsen, a first
year Business School student who
is helping to plan the event, said
that the event is aimed primarily
at Net Impact members, Stanford
business students and profession
als, but everyone is welcome to
attend. Those who come to the
conference must register and pay
a fee, which is significantly lower
for Net Impact members.
