Kyeongjae Cho's latest research
in nanotechnology may help
other researchers explore this
burgeoning field better than ever
before.
For many years, understanding
what occurs on the atomic and
molecular level has proved tedious
because scientists must build the
technology before they know how
it will behave. This rudimentary
trial-and-error method has proven
to be the major stumbling block
for advances in nanotechnology.
Cho's new software — eight years
in the making — attempts to over
come this obstacle.
"The software has two main
components — one for structure
prediction and the other for prop
erty prediction," Cho wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily "Since the

material property is strongly cor
related to the structure at nano
scale, it is crucial to predict realis
tic atomic structures."
In this way, the software can
predict the properties of a nan
otechnology product before it is
actually manufactured.
David Orenstein, public rela
tions manager for the School of
Engineering, said the software
could have considerable impact
on the field.
"Dr. Cho says his software
really is unique in that it gives
other engineers a tool to accu
rately simulate the relationship
between structure and property
in whole nanocomponents, such
as tubes, wires and particles,"
Orenstein said. "This software
could prove very useful in the
nanotechnology world because it
will give engineers very precise
guidance on the structure a
nanocomponent should have if it
is to have a certain desirable
property."
The ultimate aim, Orenstein
said, is to improve the system of cre
ating and testing nanotechnology.
"This 'rational' approach
should allow engineers to design
components and products more

quickly than if they use cruder
methods like trial and error to
make the right component for the
job," he said.
Freshman Mike Belyaev said
he was very optimistic about the
software and compared it to pro
grams he uses for his engineering
classes.
"Currently, as a freshman engi
neering student at Stanford, I use
Matlab to simulate engineering
scenarios such as the distribution
of heat on a plate," he said. "I could
not imagine doing these problems
without the software because the
calculations would be too difficult
to do by hand. If Cho's software is
indeed the first of its kind with
power to predict nanoproperties,
then it would indeed be as indis
pensable for nanotechnologists as
Matlab is for me."
Most nanotechnologies are still
in the earliest stage of develop
ment, and the next logical step is
the transition from academia to
industry and eventually to the
consumer market. Cho's software
might help speed along this
process. Discoveries at Stanford in
particular, Orenstein said, can

have a tremendous impact given
the caliber of research and
Stanford's prime location.
"Stanford Engineering has a
great tradition of commercializ
ing discoveries by starting up
companies," he said. "Hundreds

of companies have spun off from
research at the school and its
location in Silicon Valley gives
researchers here access to bil
lions of dollars of venture capi
tal. What this all means is that
when a technology here has
commercial potential, we can
transfer it from academia to
industry as fast and as success
fully as possible."
Already, potential applications
for nanotechnology are emerging

— from controlling automobile
emissions to creating more power
ful computer chips and even mak
ing strides toward a hydrogen-pow
ered society.
"An earlier version of the soft
ware has been used by the Toshiba
Corporation to study their transis
tor material development," Cho
said. "Intel has been working with
our group to study metal intercon
nect properties in designing the
next generation of chips."
