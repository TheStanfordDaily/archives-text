That you are reading this newspaper
now is somewhat of a miracle.
Last night, our Internet connection
went down — which meant that anyone
submitting an article had to bring it into
the office on a floppy disk. Remember
what those are? We used them before the
days of e-mail.
It also meant that we could not
Google facts or Facebook sources; sever
al times during the night, we sent an edi
tor to the Women's Community Center,
located around the corner from our of
fice, to use a computer there.
And it meant that we could not send
the paper electronically to our printer.
So we had to arrange for our business
manager to drive to Redwood City in the
middle of the night to deliver the paper,
on two CDs, to our printer. No one at The
Daily has had to do that since the mid
-19905.
"Oh my goodness, we're stuck in the
Stone Age," I said several times.
As if putting together the second
largest issue of the volume (a whopping
32 pages) wasn't enough work, there
were a few late-breaking news events we
had to cover. Without the Internet, we re
lied on good old-fashioned reporting tac
tics to hunt down sources. We used a
phone book. We called friends and
friends of friends. We went to people's
residences.
We had the time of our lives.
Had things in the office gone the way
they should have, you would be reading
an entirely different editorial right now.
For two weeks, I had been thinking about
what I wanted to write in this space. I read
those written by my predecessors, whom I
had admired over the last three-and-a
half years. I wrote one yesterday after
noon, but I scrapped it. I wanted to share
with you the adventure that we had last
night because that's exactly why I fell in
love with The Daily in October 2001.
When I came into The Daily as a fresh
man to copyedit my first news story ("At
tacks raise turnout at religious services,"
Oct. 12, 2001), I was scared. I don't re
member much of that editing session but
I remember being relieved when my edi
tor and I were done. I also remember
being in awe of the people 1 saw liUhyrt
fice — 1 could not believe that a group of
students worked into the early hours of
the morning to publish a newspaper
every day. I liked the pulse and the pace
of the newsroom. I liked the excitement
and the sense of urgency in the air. I knew
then that I would never leave The Daily
until the day I graduated from Stanford.
Since January 31,2005, when I took over
as editor in chief, I have spent more time at
The Daily than in my dorm room. You can
tell because my office is more decorated
than my room in Castano. From Sunday to
Thursday, between the hours of 3 p.m. and
3 a.m., I was at the Storke Publications
Building. That means that I never got to
watch "Desperate Housewives" with my

drawmates. I never made it to a single Se
nior Pub Nite. I missed birthday dinners
and coffee breaks. But looking back at the
71 nights I've spent at The Daily as editor in
chief, I don't have any regrets.
Sure, there are things I wish 1 could
have done better. Every weekday morning
for the past four months, I have dreaded
reading The Daily. Yes, dreaded. Perhaps
even hated. Why? Because 1 knew that I
would find a mistake that 1 hadn't seen the
previous night. A name misspelled, a
comma misplaced, a jump that doesn't
exist. There were bigger mistakes, too, of
course — when reporters got facts entirely
wrong. That's when the angry e-mails and
phone calls would come flooding in. And
there are stories we missed or didn't cover
as thoroughly as I wish we had.
But I don't regret taking this job. The
main reason is that I've developed friend
ships with my editors, the only ones who
can truly understand and relate to my ex
perience at The Daily. They are the ones
who make fun of me for wearing yoga
pants every day. They understand why I
will not eat pizza, Chinese food or any
thing from the Treehouse for months, if
not years. They are the ones who helped
me get through the volume without having
an emotional, mental or physical break
down. This editorial is dedicated to them.
I must thank two more groups of peo
ple. I will forever be indebted to my fam
ily and friends. My parents listened,
rather than yelltid, when I called them at
4 a.m. (7 a.m. their time) as I was heading
out of the office and they were getting
ready to start their days. And my closest
friends visited me at The Daily because 1
couldn't go to see them. (As I write this
piece, my roommate is sleeping on my of
fice couch.) I will never,ever forget their
support and encouragement.
Lastly, I must thank you, dear Daily
reader.The last time I wrote in this space,
I made a promise to you. I promised that
I would pick up my cell phone and listen
to your comments and thoughts about
The Daily. To those of you who called, e
mailed or stopped by, thank you. Your
contributions — and even harsh criti
cisms— helped make The Daily better.
And now, as my term as editor comes to a
close, 1 have one request: Please don't
stop. Challenge next year's staff to con
tinue to answer your questions and re
spond to your concerns. Hold them ac
countable as you have me.

watch "Desperate Housewives" with my

drawmates. I never made it to a single Se
nior Pub Nite. I missed birthday dinners
and coffee breaks. But looking back at the
71 nights I've spent at The Daily as editor in
chief, I don't have any regrets.
Sure, there are things I wish 1 could
have done better. Every weekday morning
for the past four months, I have dreaded
reading The Daily. Yes, dreaded. Perhaps
even hated. Why? Because 1 knew that I
would find a mistake that 1 hadn't seen the
previous night. A name misspelled, a
comma misplaced, a jump that doesn't
exist. There were bigger mistakes, too, of
course — when reporters got facts entirely
wrong. That's when the angry e-mails and
phone calls would come flooding in. And
there are stories we missed or didn't cover
as thoroughly as I wish we had.
But I don't regret taking this job. The
main reason is that I've developed friend
ships with my editors, the only ones who
can truly understand and relate to my ex
perience at The Daily. They are the ones
who make fun of me for wearing yoga
pants every day. They understand why I
will not eat pizza, Chinese food or any
thing from the Treehouse for months, if
not years. They are the ones who helped
me get through the volume without having
an emotional, mental or physical break
down. This editorial is dedicated to them.
I must thank two more groups of peo
ple. I will forever be indebted to my fam
ily and friends. My parents listened,
rather than yelltid, when I called them at
4 a.m. (7 a.m. their time) as I was heading
out of the office and they were getting
ready to start their days. And my closest
friends visited me at The Daily because 1
couldn't go to see them. (As I write this
piece, my roommate is sleeping on my of
fice couch.) I will never,ever forget their
support and encouragement.
Lastly, I must thank you, dear Daily
reader.The last time I wrote in this space,
I made a promise to you. I promised that
I would pick up my cell phone and listen
to your comments and thoughts about
The Daily. To those of you who called, e
mailed or stopped by, thank you. Your
contributions — and even harsh criti
cisms— helped make The Daily better.
And now, as my term as editor comes to a
close, 1 have one request: Please don't
stop. Challenge next year's staff to con
tinue to answer your questions and re
spond to your concerns. Hold them ac
countable as you have me.
