# Stanford must support divestment
## 
### 
As the conflict in Sudan continues, it is
important for every university to take its
own stand against the atrocity. For Stan
ford. that stand should include more than
just academic research; it ought to include
substantial divestment from corporations
conducting business in Sudan.
Stanford, as one of the top universities
in the world (with the third-largest endow
ment), carries great weight in its political
and financial decisions. A decision by
Stanford to divest from companies doing
business in Sudan would make a strong
political statement against organizations
that assist in upholding the current regime.
Still, in making a political statement, we
must be cognizant of the impacts to the fu
ture of the Stanford endowment. While di
vesting direct ownership in companies will
create a motivation to disassociate from
Sudan, it should not seriously jeopardize
Stanford's future abilities to invest in high
earning instruments, such as hedge and
private equity funds.
The conflict in Sudan has proven in
credibly harmful, with at least 70,000 dead
and approximately two million having
fled their homes. Still, little has been done
to correct these injustices. Many institu
tions, including Harvard, have begun to
divest from companies working in Sudan.
Withdrawing funds from these organiza
tions would make it more difficult for
them to do business and make a symbolic
statement that it is not acceptable to sup
port regimes committing major human
rights abuses. Most of these corporations
are involved in the petroleum industry —
a major source of funds for the Sudanese

government — so divestment should not
affect the delivery of basic supplies and
services.
In addition, Stanford should divest to
show that it holds true to its stated invest
ment principles. Following student
protests of Stanford's investment in South
Africa during the apartheid, the Universi
ty developed a set of investment protocols
including when investments are involved
in causing "substantial social injury." This
is clearly true in the case of companies
supporting the regime in Sudan ; Stan lord
acting upon this principle would illustrate
that it believes ethical investing trumps
returns.
The call for Stanford's divestment has
been led by Students Taking Action Now;
Darfur, or STAND.The group has lobbied
for investment disclosure over the last
year to ensure that Stanford's endowment
is not supporting irresponsible invest
ments. The Stanford Management Com
pany has yet to disclose investments; on
issues where certain investments are
called into question, the management
company must respond decisively and
openly.
Still, STAND'S call for complete di
vestment from PetroChina, ABB Ltd.,
Sinopec andTatneft may not be as easy as
it seems. STAND estimates that Stanford
has $1 million invested directly in
PetroChina. so divesting from that com
pany should not be particularly difficult.
But the situation regarding the other
three corporations is much trickier. Stan-
