# A break from the bubble
## Every new beginning...

Is il possible to he nos
talgic for the present?
Lately, I've been increas
ingly paralyzed by the
knowledge that this year is
almost over. Yes, new pos
sibilities lay ahead. I've got
new people to meet, new
friends to make, new op
portunities to pursue and
new wild times to have.

Yet it has become more and more diffi
cult to think in terms of what lies ahead. 1
can't help but watch each grain of sand drop
from the hourglass, frozen and unable to do
anything but lament the passing of time.
Four weeks. Four days. Four hours!
In just a few days, many of my close
friends will leave, and I'll be lucky to see
them once or twice a year. There's some
thing both profound and tragic in knowing
that the group of people who are the heart
and soul of this place we call Stanford will

soon be scattered across the country and the
planet, never to coexist as a single communi
ty again.
Perhaps it's a testimony to just how much
I love Stanford that 1 have become so over
whelmed with "pre-emptive nostalgia" that
it has crippled my ability to do anything.
Instead of sending off the e-mails that
have cluttered my inbox fora week, I'm
going through photos of this year, remem
bering the many good times. When I should
be working on completing my extra-curricu
lar work. I'm Hipping through the facebooks
of years past and present, wondering,
"Where are these faces now?" and consider
ing an even scarier question: "Where will
these faces be next year?"
My time should be spent writing my final
papers, but instead I'm ordering and re
ordering my "goodbye mix" for my friends
who are graduating next week. I've fine
tuned the CD so much that I could tell you
the order of the tracks, the lengths of each

song and what the artists had for lunch the
day they recorded them. This has got to stop.
During this mourning process, I've begun
to question just what it is I'll miss and what
it is I should take away with me. The friend
ships? Of course. The academics? Obligato
ry. ITie memories? Always.
But a privileged undergraduate educa
tion is more than just the sum of its parts. In
no other time in our lives and in no other
place in our lives will we meet and befriend
so many different people, take advantage of
so many varied opportunities and have so
many new, unique and once-in-a-lifetime ex
periences.
Hopefully another, final year here will
make me believe in my heart what I know in
my head is true: In political cartoonist Garry
Trudeau's commencement address to the
Stanford class of 1989, he closed by observ
ing,"lt comes down to a matter of remaining
