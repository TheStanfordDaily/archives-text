# Techie repairs the world
## The

We've come a long way,
you and I. And at times
iike these, 1 find it best to
remember the places
we've gone. We started off
by establishing my creden
tials. namely that I am in
fact smarter than all of
you.
Then 1 proceeded to
outline my vision of

Utopia. It would have a belief system hand
ed down from above, that would be imposed
on all members of the society. Each commu
nity would determine its own laws, without
any imposition from above. In Mississippi
they could ban abortion, while in the North
they could ban Southerners.
I then went into my plan for incubating
babies and having the government raise
the unwanted hordes by the millions. I
then extolled the virtues of designer drugs
in keeping the population happy and on
the job.
Then we entered into what 1 like to call
my "blue" period, where I railed against
war, economic sanctions, social security
and opponents of illegal immigration.
There were a few bright spots of hilarity
though. For instance, I'm still looking for
ward to the day when robots do all our
work for us and we can buy iPods using the
dividends from our Apple stock. And debt
is always good, it props our economy up

and stops war. Finally I capped things off
with my great road trip to Fry's, where I fi
nally saw everything synthesize into a vi
sion of a newer, better and cleaner Ameri
ca. This America would have unsightly
clumps of people. It would be a pioneer so
ciety. with each family living in beautiful
isolation on a playground of their own
making.
To those of you who followed me on this
journey into a brave new world, you should
thank me.To those of you who only tuned in
occasionally, you should thank me too.
You're all probably a lot more intelligent for
having read this.
I fear that these will be the last thoughts
the pen of Rahul Kanakia will ever give
you. It was good while it lasted, but quite
frankly, I don't get paid for this, which
sucks. I've hail fun showering my wisdom
upon the unwashed masses. But I feel that
there has been something of a transfer
going on here. You ignorant ones have
drained me. I find myself struggling more
and more to come up with original ideas for
columns (this one was originally going to
be about bike accidents). If you want more
advice.call 1-900-KANAKI A ... only 1.99
a minute. Don't cry for me, Stanford, it was
good while it lasted.

Kaliul Kanakia is a freshman. If you want him
