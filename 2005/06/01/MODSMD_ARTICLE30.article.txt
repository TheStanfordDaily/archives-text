Caution over embryonic stem cells is not
against women's rights
The Daily's editorial "Morality and mor
tality in stem cell research" (May 26) de
scribed the results in South Korea as a major
accomplishment, and just a few lines later
spoke of the rights of women. Yet as Dr. Mil
dred Cho pointed out, the women who do
nated eggs in South Korea "were never told
about the risk of infertility or death."
Furthermore, both the researchers there
and The Daily's editorial suggest that an egg
donated today will lead to a research break
through tomorrow — without noting that
while adult stem cells cure diseases and ben
efit the lives of patients everyday, embryon
ic stem cells have done nothing. The editori
al board wrote that "stem cell research is not
reproductive cloning" — but I assure you
that it is not "therapeutic cloning" because
there are no therapies.
The women in South Korea were clearly
deceived about the risks and benefits of giv
ing up their eggs. Women in the United
States are facing this same situation, as the
desire to research on human beginnings
mounts. Where is the outrage against this
mistreatment? Shame on Science magazine
for publishing such ethically tainted work,
and shame on The Daily for suggesting that
caution over oocyte donation is against
women's rights.
