Caution over embryonic stem cells is not
against women's rights
The Daily's editorial "Morality and mor
tality in stem cell research" (May 26) de
scribed the results in South Korea as a major
accomplishment, and just a few lines later
spoke of the rights of women. Yet as Dr. Mil
dred Cho pointed out, the women who do
nated eggs in South Korea "were never told
about the risk of infertility or death."
Furthermore, both the researchers there
and The Daily's editorial suggest that an egg
donated today will lead to a research break
through tomorrow — without noting that
while adult stem cells cure diseases and ben
efit the lives of patients everyday, embryon
ic stem cells have done nothing. The editori
al board wrote that "stem cell research is not
reproductive cloning" — but I assure you
that it is not "therapeutic cloning" because
there are no therapies.
The women in South Korea were clearly
deceived about the risks and benefits of giv
ing up their eggs. Women in the United
States are facing this same situation, as the
desire to research on human beginnings
mounts. Where is the outrage against this
mistreatment? Shame on Science magazine
for publishing such ethically tainted work,
and shame on The Daily for suggesting that
caution over oocyte donation is against
women's rights.

Bytes Cafe director appreciates
'the outpouring of support 7
As a director of Bytes Cafe, I appreciate the
outpouring of support we have received over
the past few days as news of our closing has
spread. It has been a pleasure serving the
Stanford community over the past five years,
and I hope to have a chance to continue pro
viding the same great food, service and at
mosphere again in the near future.
I certainly regret any inconvenience our
premature closing may cause our loyal patrons.
I was surprised as anyone that our parent com
pany, Palani Plantation,made the unilateral de
cision to terminate the contract early for rea
sons that remain unclear. I would have hoped
that we would be able to provide a seamless
transfer to the next contract,but the logistics in
volved in working out an interim arrangement
were difficult to resolve on such short notice.
Going forward, I remain committed to
our customers. With luck, you'll be able once
more to enjoy our house coffees, sandwiches
and maybe even a few new items, longer
hours and jazz.
Again, it's been a pleasure operating the
Cafe.

Sundresses aren't just for Stepford wives
Regarding Emily Wood's column "The Wed
ding Party" (May 25): First off, Wood felt like
she stepped into Stepford? They all seemed

like brainwashed robots subservient to their
husbands? (Which I assume most of them
don't even have.) She cites a sundress and
apron as support of this. What's wrong with
sundresses? Or aprons, for that matter?
Or maybe her "Stepford" assessment is
based on the fact that the champagne toast
doesn't lead to getting smashed, as people
only have the one glass. Gee, I must have
been somehow mistaken in that I thought
the point of a champagne toast was to have a
toast, not to get drunk. Well, if I'm wrong,
maybe these girls just aren't big drinkers.
Or maybe it's based on the fact that peo
ple were polite and didn't swear. Wood says
she just met most of these girls on Sunday —
did she ever consider that perhaps most of
them just don't swear? 1 don't tend to swear
much, nor do my friends, and we try to be po
lite. What's wrong with that? Should I check
to make sure we're not all robots?
1 don't mean to say that her tastes are
wrong. It just means that Wood is not the
only one with valid styles and preferences.
Maybe she didn't mean the "Stepford" com
ment so harshly, but that's how it has come
across to a lot of people. While I don't per
sonally know who was at the shower Wood
went to, I know people who do. And they
have told me of a lot of anger and hurt com
ing from the attendees about this column.
If Wood wants to make a point about the
way our society, approaches marriage I would
have two pieces of advice. First, actually write
about that, instead of mocking some specific
person's bridal shower. Second, don't base
your opinion on one bridal shower; you're at
a great research university — you should at
least have learned that a sample-size of one
isn't a good basis for analysis.

Profs wrote two divestment letters
I want to thank The Daily for its coverage
of the ongoing genocide in Darfur and Stu
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur, or STAND,
divestment campaign. I am just writing to cor
rect the article "Universities urged to divest
from companies linked to Sudanese govern
ment" (May 27). John Prendergast and
Samantha Power have actually sent two letters
to Stanford. The first — also sent to more than
1(X) American universities besides Stanford —
calls on schools to check their investment port
folios and divest from companies that do busi
ness in Sudan. The second was sent only to
Stanford's leaders: this letter calls for divest
ment from Stanford's definite holdings in
PetroChina, and any holdings that it has in
Sinopec, ABB Ltd. and Tatneft. This second
letter specifically supports the divestment
campaign of STAND, and contains the same
recommendation-language as STAND'S di
vestment petition at www.stanforddivest.com.

Fan club name is
'uninspired and born of ignorance'
The May 26 "Sports Briefs" included the an
nouncement of the football fan club's new name
—"'The Red Zone." In choosing this name, Walt
Harris made his first mistake as Stanford's head
coach. "The Red Zone" is both uninspired and
born of ignorance. Does Harris not realize that
red is not our color? A shade's difference might
not be a big deal at a school whose mascot isn't a
color. "The Cardinal Zone" would be both witti
er and, more importantly, accurate.

dred Cho pointed out, the women who do
nated eggs in South Korea "were never told
about the risk of infertility or death."
Furthermore, both the researchers there
and The Daily's editorial suggest that an egg
donated today will lead to a research break
through tomorrow — without noting that
while adult stem cells cure diseases and ben
efit the lives of patients everyday, embryon
ic stem cells have done nothing. The editori
al board wrote that "stem cell research is not
reproductive cloning" — but I assure you
that it is not "therapeutic cloning" because
there are no therapies.
The women in South Korea were clearly
deceived about the risks and benefits of giv
ing up their eggs. Women in the United
States are facing this same situation, as the
desire to research on human beginnings
mounts. Where is the outrage against this
mistreatment? Shame on Science magazine
for publishing such ethically tainted work,
and shame on The Daily for suggesting that
caution over oocyte donation is against
women's rights.

Bytes Cafe director appreciates
'the outpouring of support 7
As a director of Bytes Cafe, I appreciate the
outpouring of support we have received over
the past few days as news of our closing has
spread. It has been a pleasure serving the
Stanford community over the past five years,
and I hope to have a chance to continue pro
viding the same great food, service and at
mosphere again in the near future.
I certainly regret any inconvenience our
premature closing may cause our loyal patrons.
I was surprised as anyone that our parent com
pany, Palani Plantation,made the unilateral de
cision to terminate the contract early for rea
sons that remain unclear. I would have hoped
that we would be able to provide a seamless
transfer to the next contract,but the logistics in
volved in working out an interim arrangement
were difficult to resolve on such short notice.
Going forward, I remain committed to
our customers. With luck, you'll be able once
more to enjoy our house coffees, sandwiches
and maybe even a few new items, longer
hours and jazz.
Again, it's been a pleasure operating the
Cafe.

Sundresses aren't just for Stepford wives
Regarding Emily Wood's column "The Wed
ding Party" (May 25): First off, Wood felt like
she stepped into Stepford? They all seemed

like brainwashed robots subservient to their
husbands? (Which I assume most of them
don't even have.) She cites a sundress and
apron as support of this. What's wrong with
sundresses? Or aprons, for that matter?
Or maybe her "Stepford" assessment is
based on the fact that the champagne toast
doesn't lead to getting smashed, as people
only have the one glass. Gee, I must have
been somehow mistaken in that I thought
the point of a champagne toast was to have a
toast, not to get drunk. Well, if I'm wrong,
maybe these girls just aren't big drinkers.
Or maybe it's based on the fact that peo
ple were polite and didn't swear. Wood says
she just met most of these girls on Sunday —
did she ever consider that perhaps most of
them just don't swear? 1 don't tend to swear
much, nor do my friends, and we try to be po
lite. What's wrong with that? Should I check
to make sure we're not all robots?
1 don't mean to say that her tastes are
wrong. It just means that Wood is not the
only one with valid styles and preferences.
Maybe she didn't mean the "Stepford" com
ment so harshly, but that's how it has come
across to a lot of people. While I don't per
sonally know who was at the shower Wood
went to, I know people who do. And they
have told me of a lot of anger and hurt com
ing from the attendees about this column.
If Wood wants to make a point about the
way our society, approaches marriage I would
have two pieces of advice. First, actually write
about that, instead of mocking some specific
person's bridal shower. Second, don't base
your opinion on one bridal shower; you're at
a great research university — you should at
least have learned that a sample-size of one
isn't a good basis for analysis.

Profs wrote two divestment letters
I want to thank The Daily for its coverage
of the ongoing genocide in Darfur and Stu
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur, or STAND,
divestment campaign. I am just writing to cor
rect the article "Universities urged to divest
from companies linked to Sudanese govern
ment" (May 27). John Prendergast and
Samantha Power have actually sent two letters
to Stanford. The first — also sent to more than
1(X) American universities besides Stanford —
calls on schools to check their investment port
folios and divest from companies that do busi
ness in Sudan. The second was sent only to
Stanford's leaders: this letter calls for divest
ment from Stanford's definite holdings in
PetroChina, and any holdings that it has in
Sinopec, ABB Ltd. and Tatneft. This second
letter specifically supports the divestment
campaign of STAND, and contains the same
recommendation-language as STAND'S di
vestment petition at www.stanforddivest.com.

Fan club name is
'uninspired and born of ignorance'
The May 26 "Sports Briefs" included the an
nouncement of the football fan club's new name
—"'The Red Zone." In choosing this name, Walt
Harris made his first mistake as Stanford's head
coach. "The Red Zone" is both uninspired and
born of ignorance. Does Harris not realize that
red is not our color? A shade's difference might
not be a big deal at a school whose mascot isn't a
color. "The Cardinal Zone" would be both witti
er and, more importantly, accurate.
