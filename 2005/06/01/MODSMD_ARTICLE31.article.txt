## Just one word...plastics 
### 
It's the end of the quar
ter, the end of the academic
year (well, sort of anyway)
and, for several of you, the
end of Stanford.
Given that, a column
full of helpful advice to de
parting seniors seemed in
order. After all, what is ex
perience for, if not to
share?

On the other hand, one
imagines counsel is not in short supply over
commencement weekend — it often appears
that there is nothing that assembled hoards of
parents (and related species) would rather do
than offer words of wisdom for the future.
Unfortunately, the effect of those "words"
is usually dampened by the pervading stench
of cliche. The profundity of stock phrases and
predictable proclamations is doubtful, even
when the speaker is inspired by seeing their
pride and joy on the threshold of a new stage
of life.
It's not hard to predict the sort of thing that
will be floating around the Farm as the yearly
ritual takes place. There'll be a lot of talk of
"duty," interspaced with a little "responsibili
ty" and perhaps a shade of "contributing to
your community."
Then there's the sequence of observations
on the changing world, you know the "uncer
tain times" and the "digital / electronic / vir
tual society." Oh, and don't overlook global
ization, after all the planet is "shrinking" so
fast it'll probably disappear sometime next
year.
And let's not forgot the outpouring of
pride. You are special. As graduates of Stan
ford you are amongst the brightest of your
generation. You will be responsible for shap
ing the world as it rushes headlong into the
new millennium. Such a burden. But as Stan
ford men and women, we know you have

what it takes.
It is easy to start believing the outpouring
of drivel, to pretend that all this talk actually
means something. Luckily, it's also not diffi
cult to get a little perspective.
You're not special. You're just one of mil
lions who will graduate this year and every
year, in America and all over the world. You
have no duties or responsibilities, nothing
weighs on your shoulders.
We may live in a changing world, but it is
no more dynamic than it was last year, the
year before, the year before that and so on.
You're just a cog in the machine. Get used it.
There is one sentiment that flies around at
these times that may be more than just the
usual trite bullshit. It could be that these are
(were) "the best days of your life."
Of course, if that's true, you shouldn't be
celebrating. You should be in mourning. If col
lege years are so darn good, that means every
thing to follow (and there's a lot of it) is just
not that great.
More positively, most people don't notice
the gradual slide into ordinariness. You prob
ably won't realize that your dreams are fiz
zling out; instead you're going to lull yourself
into thinking that each time ambition gets sac
rificed for practicality you're simply reassess
ing your goals.
On reflection, though, self-denial is really
not such a bad thing, so you shouldn't fret
about its encroachment on your psyche. And
when the recognition of the downward spiral
finally hits, well, at least you can tell people
that you went to Stanford.
With which observation we must con
clude: Congratulations on your achievement.
You've really done very well. Oh, and good
luck for the future, you'll need it.

Figured out what the title means? Well done! E

what you've won.
