## Nick Fram's final pearl of wisdom 
### 
"Are you an active par
ticipant in your life?"
;isked the person sitting
next to me as we drove
down Palm Drive the
other day. At first this
seemed like a foolish and
absurd question. I mean,
it's my life. I'm there, I'm
in it, I see what's going on.
But am I involved in it?

Do I dictate what happens or does what
happens dictate me?
One thing's for sure: In high school we all
were active participants in our lives; we
wouldn't now he here if this were not the
case. But the temptation is to look at college
as a destination, a final achievement. Once
we're here, we're golden, right?
This should set off the warning lights.
Unless you plan on not living past gradu
ation, this is not a destination. Indeed, you
have 50,60,70 more years to go. Are you an
active participant in your life? Do you want
to he?
Stanford is a training ground for the rest
of your life â€” intellectually, socially, per
sonally. This is the opportunity for you, me
and the awkward kid behind the tree to
learn, interact, grow up.
So do it. Let's face it, there are a lot of
awkward people here. You don't become
less awkward by hiding. You become less
awkward by getting out there and meeting
people and seeing what there is to see. You

may not succeed on try number one, but
each time it'll get better. And it'll get easier.
Yes, this is your life, but this is not the real
world. This is practice for the real world.
And the real world lasts a lot longer than
four years. If you don't practice for the real
world, then you'll be at quite the disadvan
tage when the real world begins.
And step one is by becoming an active
participant in your life.
Think about what's important to you. Do
you want to make a lot of money? Do you
still want to save the world?
Think about what you like to do. Do you
like to be outside? Do you like to travel?
Think about what you want out of your
life. Do you know where you want to live?
Do you want a family?
The basic point is that anybody can do
anything. Yes, this place gives you the tools
to realize your dreams. But step one is figur
ing out what those dreams are.
This is my final column. Every columnist in
his last piece wants to say the things he hasn't
said and impart that one pearl of wisdom that
he's been holding on to just for this occasion.
So this is my pearl: figure out who you
are. I know that you've been told this all
your life, but at some point you're going to
realize that that's actually good advice.Take
your time so you're sure, but do it.
Don't let college be the best four years of
your life.
