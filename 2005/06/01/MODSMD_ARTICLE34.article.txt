## But that's not the point Facebook Nation 
### 
I started this last column with a huge
writer's block. Procrastination, a debilitat
ing cold and zero motivation in my last
two weeks here at Stanford all conspired
to leave me with a blank screen and a
blinking cursor, hours past the deadline. I
thought about — and wrote most of—a
very cheesy last column about graduating
with no future plans and no job prospects.
I'm sure it would have been a great ego
boost for many of you, because I'm one of
the least future-oriented people I know at
the moment.

At the last minute, I
switched plans. This en
tire quarter I've used my
6(H) words a week (al
though to he honest with
you, I always go over the
limit) to thoroughly ex
pose all my little weak
nesses and quirks, so I
figure there's no point in
stopping now. So here
goes.

One of my favorite things about the
facebook.com is the fact that it has legit
imized stalking. Googling people is still a
little creepy in many respects, but lace
booking is commonly accepted, except in
some resistant corners of the world. I have
been stalking people for years now. and
I'm glad to see it entering the public
sphere.
This is not to say that you should hop in
your car or on your bike and start circling
the block where some guy you've just met
lives — or pester your friends for informa
tion about a total stranger — both of
which are creepy things I have done. I also
check the AIM away messages of people
with whom I am no longer on speaking
terms, or people with whom I have never
been on speaking terms, but want to read
their away messages anyway to gather in
formation about them. (You know you are
crazy when you don't actually put them on
your buddy list, but you learn the key
board shortcut to read profiles.)
Not to digress too far from the point —
although that's really my trademark move
— but what I like about the legitimization
of stalking on the thefacebook.com is that
those of us with obsessive personalities
are being recognized, even forgiven, for
our strange behavior.
I'm not actually crazy, at least not as
crazy as people think I am. I 'm not a stalk
er. and sometimes when 1 hit that Alt-O
command in AIM to check profiles I know
I am doing something sort of creepy and
wrong (that's usually when I vow never to
do it again). Hut at the same time, I think
that some of this behavior is symptomatic
of a deeper personality characteristic, and
that characteristic is something I can't give
up. In fact 1 think it's a good thing, and I'm
willing to be called a stalker for it.
I love people with obsessive personali
ties (within reason, but let's just forget the
outliers fora moment). They're by far the
most fun to hang out with. All of my
friends, in one way or another, have this
particular trait, and I don't think it's a co
incidence. When 1 say obsession, I mean a
kind of intense interest in something —
anything. You can be obsessed with TV —
clearly I am, as I cried four times in the
season finale of "The 0.C." You can be ob
sessed with your school subjects — every
once in a while 1 think 1 freak people out
with my love of John Donne's poetry. And
obviously, you can be obsessed with peo
ple.
Obsession is actually just a magnified
form of passion. And when you get down
to it, intense passion is an amazing thing.
I suspect that part of the reason why the
facebook.com took off so much on col
lege campuses is because it facilitates
obsessions. Colleges, especially places
like Stanford, are supposed to be filled
with passionate, committed and creative
people.
Unfortunately for all of us, passion is
too often stilled in an attempt to be so
phisticated or well liked. It's not exactly
just about trying to fit in — it's under
standable.Too much passion can be fright
ening or threatening (that's why we have
restraining orders). But I think people sell
themselves short when they refuse to get
excited about things — when they refuse
to let themselves go, or even worse, when
they won't even admit to having passions
at all.
All I can say is,in my years here I've re
alized that trying to hide your tendency to
obsess or your passion for facebook stalk
ing is only detrimental to yourself and
everyone around you. My best friendships
are with people who never shy away from
letting their strange obsessions show —
their deep abiding love for Madonna or
Certain Rod Stewart songs, their fascina
tions with authors they have never and
will never meet. I could go on. and I'm
tempted. My greatest obsession has al
ways been with people.

Emily readily admits that this column is
probably the most tangential and random
thing ever. However she happens to also be
obsessed with digressions. If you have a
problem with that, email her at
