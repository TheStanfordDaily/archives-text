In Guam,
nearly all the

birds and a few en
dangered species have been de-

voured by the species of brown
tree snake that arrived from
Australia in the middle of the
last century. This snake is the

reader's introduction to the world
of invasive species explored in a
new book, "Out of Eden: An

112 Odyssey of Ecological Invasion," by
alumnus Alan Burdick, Class of 1988.
Burdick, who designed his own major

j — history and philosophy of science —
once he transferred to Stanford, worked at
The Stanford Daily during his time on the

Farm. He moved on to work as a restaurant re
viewer and finally ended focusing his career ef
forts in science journalism. Burdick is currently
a senior editor at Discover magazine in New
York City.
"Out of Eden," his first book, was released in

May. After the release. Burdick spent about a week in the
Bay Area on a book tour. The question-and-answer por
tions of these talks were most interesting, he said, because
people often are aware of one particular invasive species,
like the kud/.u vine, and are interested in talking about
their ecological implications.
A number of books about ecological diversity and the
transplantation of exotic species such as the brown tree
snake or the troublesome zebra mussel have led to the
popularity of what is known as invasive biology. Burdick
said he was concerned by the tendency to focus only on
the damage invasive species can cause. Instead of auto
matically judging a phenomenon that he calls, "the ho
mogenization of the world." he wanted to explore and
describe the impact of global travel on ecosystems that
are the recipients of new, non-native species.

Uncashed checks,cell phones
and hamsters may not seem eas
ily forgettable. But Imogen
Hinds, associate director for
housing operations, has found
these and more within the walls
of the Row houses after the stu
dents have left.
"The hamster was very cute."
Hinds said. "Students left it in a
hallway of a residence one year
along with many other items, in
cluding trash bags. Fortunately,
a custodial staff member real
ized that the cage was about to
be thrown away and had a ham
ster in it."
Hinds said that the custodians
have also found clothing, toi
letries, retainers, passports,
checkbooks, school supplies,
printers, computer monitors, an
swering machines, photo albums,
and old fraternity yearbooks.
"One year we found bird

seed and bird feathers, hut no
hird." she said.
Many students forget to do a
final sweep of their rooms as
they leave, forgetting important
items that housing operations
must clear out quickly.
"Since we are cleaning the
rooms to ready them for either
summer-session students or con
ferences in a very short time, the
process of removal is sometimes
over a couple of hours." she said.
When housing services find
forgotten items that appear to be
of value, they bag and tag the
item and store it in the lost and
found area for 90 days. If no one
comes to claim it and there is no
identified owner, it is donated to
charity. If the item has significant
personal value and it is clear who
the owner is, such as a passport,
housing services will contact the
person to inform them that it is
being held in lost and found.
"If a student can identify their
property and we have it, we can

"I didn't want to write a doom-and-gloom book,"
said Burdick. "A lot of these invading species cause
problems, but a lot of them don't. Again that kind of rais
es some fundamental questions about how ecosystems
are structured and whether they are as tightly knit as we
thought they were."
Burdick first started working on "Out of Eden" 10
years ago as an offshoot of an article he wrote for the
New York Times Magazine in 1994.T0 research, he visit
ed biologists in Guam, in Hawaii and at the San Francis
co Bay, among other places, and spent months following
them and exploring their research.
"Writing about science is kind of like being a travel
writer," he said. "If you can just kind of bring back some of
the texture of what goes on [in any location] and find out
why people are passionate about living there and studying
the things that they study, then you've done a good job."
That was precisely the focus Burdick took in his book:
He focused on the work of one or two central scientists
in each of the major sections. Conversations with biolo
gists studying the brown tree snake in Guam guide the
first third of the book. In Hawaii, he talked to a soil biol
ogist who studies the impact of environmental changes
on invertebrate species in the soil, and explores species
like fruit flies and carnivorous caterpillar.
The last major area covered in "Out of Eden" is ma
rine biology. In the San Francisco Bay. which is home to
more than 250 non-native species, Burdick followed a
group of marine biologists who study the movement of
marine species in the ballast water of oil tankers and
other large ships.
In the course of his book research, Burdick even
talked with a decontamination specialist in NASA's
spacecraft-assembly facility, where the concern is to pre
vent the transplantation of earth life forms to other plan
ets during space travel.
Burdick's analogy of science writing to travel writing
was built into a book that reviewers and Burdick himself
described as part science book, part travelogue.part per
sonal narrative. Integrated into the exploration of inva
sive species in "Out of Eden" are questions and musings
about what nature is, what natural means and how
mankind's relationship to nature is defined.
"In a lot of ways, it's kind of an extended essay, an ex
tended travel piece," Burdick said. "Traveling and seeing
these amazing places and thinking aloud about the urge to
travel and pondering what the implications of the urge to
travel are. So it gets pretty metaphysical towards the end."

return it," Hinds said. "If we end
up needing to store the property
fora while, the student might need
to pay a storage fee for the item."
Hinds said that some people
have been found rooting
through the trash areas at the
end of the school year to see
what has been left behind, but
the campus police strictly moni
tor these areas and have arrest
ed people for dumpster diving,
Housing operations does all
it can to return property to its
rightful owners.
"Because it is the end of the
school year, we are always con
cerned about getting things back
to students if they have left
something behind," said Rodger
Whitney, executive director of
student housing. "Students can
contact the Housing Service
Center if they feel they have for
gotten an item in their room."
The Housing Service Center
is open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. all sum
