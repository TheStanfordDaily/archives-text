# Cartoons simplify chem

### DAISY CHUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For anyone interested in learning the
basic principles of chemistry, "The Cartoon
Guide to Chemistry" might be the best alter
native to a textbook. Published this year, the
book is a joint project between
Environmental Engineering and Science
Prof. Craig Criddle and San Francisco-based
cartoonist Larry Gonick, author of "Cartoon
History of the Universe."
The illustrated book, which took two
years to complete, is aimed at high school
students and college freshmen who want to
brush up on their chemistry.
"Some of the material is pretty sophisti
cated, but we hope that kids will understand
it like this," Criddle said.
At 242 pages, the book is organized into
12 chapters and is designed to explain chem
istry concepts intuitively, providing illustra
tions to accompany formulas and theories.
Each chapter covers one subject area, such

as "Heat of Reaction" or "Acid Basics."
"A lot of people are visual learners, so the
cartoons really help them understand the
concepts," Criddle said. "We thought that
there must be a better way to teach this, a
better pedagogy for explaining thermody
namics, for example."
He added that he originally planned to
write a textbook for Civil and
Environmental Engineering 177, "Aquatic
Chemistry and Microbiology," when he con
tacted Gonick about a possible collabora
tion in 2003.
"I called him at home and he listened to
my idea fora textbook," Criddle said. "Then
he counter-offered with 'Cartoon Guide,'
which he had been working on already."
The authors stayed in contact throughout
the planning process, exchanging over 1,200
e-mails. They consulted chemistry textbooks
to decide which concepts they wanted to
include and Gonick turned their ideas into
