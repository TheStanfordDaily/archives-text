# Cartoons simplify chem

### DAISY CHUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For anyone interested in learning the
basic principles of chemistry, "The Cartoon
Guide to Chemistry" might be the best alter
native to a textbook. Published this year, the
book is a joint project between
Environmental Engineering and Science
Prof. Craig Criddle and San Francisco-based
cartoonist Larry Gonick, author of "Cartoon
History of the Universe."
The illustrated book, which took two
years to complete, is aimed at high school
students and college freshmen who want to
brush up on their chemistry.
"Some of the material is pretty sophisti
cated, but we hope that kids will understand
it like this," Criddle said.
At 242 pages, the book is organized into
12 chapters and is designed to explain chem
istry concepts intuitively, providing illustra
tions to accompany formulas and theories.
Each chapter covers one subject area, such

as "Heat of Reaction" or "Acid Basics."
"A lot of people are visual learners, so the
cartoons really help them understand the
concepts," Criddle said. "We thought that
there must be a better way to teach this, a
better pedagogy for explaining thermody
namics, for example."
He added that he originally planned to
write a textbook for Civil and
Environmental Engineering 177, "Aquatic
Chemistry and Microbiology," when he con
tacted Gonick about a possible collabora
tion in 2003.
"I called him at home and he listened to
my idea fora textbook," Criddle said. "Then
he counter-offered with 'Cartoon Guide,'
which he had been working on already."
The authors stayed in contact throughout
the planning process, exchanging over 1,200
e-mails. They consulted chemistry textbooks
to decide which concepts they wanted to
include and Gonick turned their ideas into

storyboards.
"It was just a really intense
process," Criddle said. "We
looked at popular textbooks, and
then we just looked at what made
sense."
The book is not yet used in any
chemistry classes at Stanford, but
Criddle has put it on the reading
list for CEE 177.
"A lot of my students are
shaky about chemistry, so this is a
good way for them to review
things they've forgotten, or even
fill in some gaps," he said.
At Stanford, the student
response to the book has ranged
from amusement to disinterest.
"1 would have used it in high
school as an introduction to
chemistry, but for any degree-ifi
able level of chemistry it wouldn't
be that helpful," freshman Donna
Meng said.
"1 haven't taken chemistry
since high school and I don't plan
on taking it if I can avoid it,"
freshman Richard Barton said. "1
might use the book to look
through the pictures."
Sarah Bradford, also a fresh
man, said she plans to take chem
istry before graduating. "It seems
so distracting. I feel like the illus
trations would get in the way of
studying. I wouldn't use it because
you have to look through the pic
tures to get to the material."
