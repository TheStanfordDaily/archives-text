# Study shows wind may meet energy demands
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Wind power is being touted as the
newest alternative energy source. Stanford
researchers report that it may be the key to
keeping up with the world's growing ener
gy demand.
Gathering more than 8,000 wind
records on every continent, graduate stu
dent Cristina Archer and Mark Jacobson,
associate professor in civil and environ
mental engineering, have created a set of
world wind-power resource maps that total
72 terawatts of power — 40 times the
amount of electrical power used by all
countries in the year 2000.
If just 20 percent of this total were
tapped. Archer said, it would satisfy all the
world's energy needs.
One terawatt is enough power to light
up 10 billion 100-watt light bulbs, according
to the Discovery Channel Web site.
"It's the first map of global wind power
potential at 80 meters and the first to quan
tify the wind power available for economi
cally-feasible wind energy," Jacobson said.
"It also locates several new areas of fast
winds."
The sites with the highest wind-power
potential are located along the North Sea
in Europe, around the southern tip of
South America, the island of Tasmania, the
Great Lakes region of North America and
the northeastern and northwestern coasts

of North America, Archer and Jacobson
said.
"Some maps documenting global wind
did exist," said Jacobson. "But they only
document wind power at lower heights and
do not use the variety of data collection
measurements."
Wind generators are currently being
built at record rates. Over the past five
years, wind power systems have sprung up
at an annual rate of 34 percent, making
wind the fastest-growing electrical power
source.
"We are kind of reassured that the
numbers they have come up with are at
least as good as those produced in the
past," said Mike Robinson, deputy direc
tor of the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory's Wind Technology Center in
Colorado, in an interview with the
Discovery Channel. "There's a tremen
dous amount of wind."
But wind power currently accounts
for only little more than 0.5 percent of
the world's electrical power. According
to Archer, the shortfall exists for two
reasons — a dearth of data to help engi
neers properly place generators and the
misconception that wind power is unreli
able.
"I think the problem lies more with oil
and coal companies," freshman Jess
Schaffer said. "What will they have to say
about the possibility of their profit loss if
wind power picks up speed?"
