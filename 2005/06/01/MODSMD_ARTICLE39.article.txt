# Roller hockey gains club sport status

The Stanford Roller Hockey
Club, which has existed unofficially
for the past two or three years, has
recently secured official club status
from Stanford. Roller Hockey
members said they hope that the
possible funding and higher visibili
ty that comes with club status will
help them recruit more players, par
ticularly undergraduates. Graduate
and post-doctoral students make up
a majority of the team.
Last Sunday, the team faced off
against other Bay Area roller hock
ey teams in the First Annual Spring
Southbay Hockey Challenge in
Sunnyvale.
The Stanford club chose to play
a team comprised of local employ
ees from Netscape and America

Online.
Stanford team founder Steven
Tan, a fourth-year graduate student
in biophysics, gave two reasons for
the selection.
"They've had a team for quite
some time that is funded, surpris
ingly, by their workplace, Netscape /
AOL," Tan said. "In fact, the com
pany has gone so far as building
them a hockey rink and equipment
room in the parking lot. Also, we've
known these guys as very competi
tive and sportsmanlike people."
Stanford beat Netscape / AOL
23-4.
The team has improved over the
course of the season, particularly
after being destroyed by UC
Berkeley's varsity A roller hockey
team on March 12. Berkeley's team
has been part of the Western
Collegiate Roller Hockey League
for years.
Tan said he was not surprised by
this loss, adding that "the majority
of our players have only begun to
learn the sport."

Netscape / AOL. the Stanford club
is looking forward to organizing
games with other teams around the
Bay Area.
"There are countless other
roller hockey teams, both inde
pendent and affiliated with compa
nies," Tan said. He added that even
tually, the Stanford Roller Hockey
Club would like to host a large
tournament of its own.
The Stanford Roller Hockey
Club was formed by a number of
Stanford graduate and undergrad

uate students who grew up play
ing roller hockey and missed the
sport when they left home, Tan
said. Along with engineering grad
uate student Lawrence Cheung
and business student Ben Ho, Tan
started playing weekend pick-up
games at Escondido Ealementary
School. They soon discovered that
other Stanford students were
playing roller hockey in the park
ing lots near the Ford Center and
Burnham Pavilion and joined up
with them.
Game announcements spread
through word of mouth. Tan said,
and the group grew quickly.
The ASSU denied funding to
the team because not enough
undergraduate participate.

Accordingly, the club is currently
trying to secure funding from the
Graduate Student Council, Tan
said.
He added that many students
are discouraged from playing roller
hockey at Stanford due to the lack
of club equipment and the cost of
renting indoor rink time. For these
reasons, receiving funding will be
instrumental in allowing for the
club's growth. Tan said.
"Now we can claim to be the
Stanford Roller Hockey Team ver
sus a bunch of roller hockey guys
from Stanford," said club co
founder Lawrence Chih-Hui
Cheung, a fourth-year mechanical
engineering graduate student. "It
looks better on a jersey."
