The Stanford Roller Hockey
Club, which has existed unofficially
for the past two or three years, has
recently secured official club status
from Stanford. Roller Hockey
members said they hope that the
possible funding and higher visibili
ty that comes with club status will
help them recruit more players, par
ticularly undergraduates. Graduate
and post-doctoral students make up
a majority of the team.
Last Sunday, the team faced off
against other Bay Area roller hock
ey teams in the First Annual Spring
Southbay Hockey Challenge in
Sunnyvale.
The Stanford club chose to play
a team comprised of local employ
ees from Netscape and America

Online.
Stanford team founder Steven
Tan, a fourth-year graduate student
in biophysics, gave two reasons for
the selection.
"They've had a team for quite
some time that is funded, surpris
ingly, by their workplace, Netscape /
AOL," Tan said. "In fact, the com
pany has gone so far as building
them a hockey rink and equipment
room in the parking lot. Also, we've
known these guys as very competi
tive and sportsmanlike people."
Stanford beat Netscape / AOL
23-4.
The team has improved over the
course of the season, particularly
after being destroyed by UC
Berkeley's varsity A roller hockey
team on March 12. Berkeley's team
has been part of the Western
Collegiate Roller Hockey League
for years.
Tan said he was not surprised by
this loss, adding that "the majority
of our players have only begun to
learn the sport."
