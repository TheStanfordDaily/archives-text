# Guess? pulls offensive shirts

### ANNE RITCHIE 
Some members of Stanford's Colombian com
munity are taking action against what they deem
an offensive shirt manufactured by Guess? cloth
ing company. The shirt, which reads, "Ski
Colombia: Always Plenty of Fresh Powder." was
taken off the market nationwide. Several
Stanford faculty members had voiced complaints.
The shirt's reference to drug trafficking in
Colombia "trivializes a really serious problem,"
said Ricardo Dolmetsch, associate professor at
the School of Medicine.

"Colombians have made a big effort to fight
the drug war. which has taken the lives of thou
sands of people," he said. "I am personally upset
that a company should use a common stereotype
to try to sell a shirt."
Dolmetsch sent an e-mail expressing his dis
may and requesting the withdrawal of the shirt
from retail locations. Medical Prof. Jose Montoya
and Knight Fellow Diego Romero followed suit.
All three are Colombian nationals.
Although Guess? has taken the shirt off the
market, its image is still accessible online.
"It took a lot of letters for them to
respond," Dolmetsch said. "Initially, they
didn't want to do anything, but they realized
they had a crisis on their hands. I think it
helped that Stanford faculty got involved."
In a similar situation three years ago,
Abercrombie and Fitch caused a public
uproar and ended up withdrawing a line of
Asian-themed T-shirts, including one that
read "T\vo Wongs can make it white."
While Guess? sent apologies to all who
wrote letters, many — including Romero —
are not satisfied.
"They are not real apologies," he said.
"In effect, they say, 'We are sorry because
you are upset.' lliey are not taking the
blame. They don't care about us
Colombians."
Romero said he plans to continue publi
cizing the issue until a public apology is
made.
"Why don't they design another T-shirt
saying something good about the country?"
he said. "It would be the greatest apology
they could ever make."
Dolmetsch said he feels the same way.
'There are plenty of shirts you can make
that are flattering, as opposed to denigrat
ing," he said. "But I wouldn't expect that of
a clothing company."
Critics of the Guess? shirt argue that it
reinforces the unfair stereotype that
Colombia is full of drug-runners
"There is a historical weight on us, on our
predication as the country from which drugs
are imported to the United States,"
Montoya said. The majority of Colombians
are not involved in drug production or sale,
he added.
"We have always been stigmatized as a
country and as a people," he said. "Many
Colombians have been trying very hard to
work to undo all this. It's offensive when a
company sells a commercial product at our

expense."
Freshman Laura Mesa said that it's diffi
cult to travel with her Colombian passport
due to the country's negative reputation.
"It takes a long time to get through cus
toms," she said. "Pretty much everywhere,
people are wary of Colombian travelers.
The officials tend to check my baggage very,
very well."
Romero likened use of a commercial
product to make light of Colombia's drug
war to the burning of an American flag.
"Nothing could feel worse," he said. "It's
something that we all have in our minds and
hearts. To have a company like Guess?
come up with this T-shirt is demoralizing, to
say the least."
Romero is asking all members of the
Colombian community at Stanford to stop
buying Guess? products and would like to
expand the boycott to the campus at large.
"It could be great if everyone who's con
cerned with what's happening in the world
could stop buying Guess?" he said.
