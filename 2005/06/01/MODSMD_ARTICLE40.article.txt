# Elephants detect vibrations

### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, a research associate at
the Medical School's Department of Otolaryngology,
has concluded after conducting research for 10 years
that elephants are able to use ground vibrations to
send a variety of messages, including warnings and
mating calls.
Her findings drew international attention after
tsunamis hit Southern Asia last December because
elephants fled to higher ground before the wave hit,
saving the lives of the tourists riding on their backs.
O'Connell-Rodwell's work suggests that these ele
phants were responding to the low-frequency waves
created by the tsunamis.
"We think that elephants are detecting the vibra
tions [either through] sensors in the bottom of their
feet and in their trunk or via bone conduction from
their toes to their middle ear," O'Connell-Rodwell
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Although scientists have known since the 1980s
that elephants are able to send airborne messages, no
one had connected these messages with ground vibra
tions.
"A lot of research has been done showing that
small animals use seismic signals to find mates, locate
prey and establish territories, but there have only been

a few studies focusing on the ability of large mammals
to communicate through the ground," O'Connell-
Rodwell wrote.
Her most recent research builds on a study she con
ducted in 2002 when her team observed how ele
phants at the Etosha National Park in Namibia react
ed to a recorded distress message that they translated
into ground vibrations.
"The results of our 2002 study showed us that ele
phants do indeed detect warning calls played through
the ground," she said. "We expected them to clump up
into tight groups and leave the area, and that's in fact
what they did."
In order to verify these findings, O'Connell-
Rodwell returned to Etosha last July with her husband
Tim Rodwell, an alumnus of Stanford's School of
Medicine, and other experts including Jason Wood, a
Stanford geoscientist, and Colleen Kinzley, a curator
at the Oakland Zoo.
Using speakers, video cameras, amplifiers and more
than 22 censors called geophones, the team produced
multiple messages around the Mushara water hole. It
was the biggest study of large mammal seismic com
munication ever performed in the wild.
While the data has not yet been analyzed in full, ini
tial findings suggest that the elephants responded as
