# Senate echoes recommendation to divest
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate convened
for its final meeting of the academic year on
Sunday. Members discussed three important
advocacy bills — one regarding a new Overseas
Seminar in Israel, another on door-to-door distri
bution of student publications and a third on the
University's divestment from oil companies that
operate in Sudan.
Responding to student interest, Jack Rakove,
professor of history and political science, and
Amos Nur, director of the Stanford Overseas
Studies Programs, have developed a curriculum
fora new three-week Overseas Seminar in Israel
called "Ttoo Peoples in One Land: The Israeli-
Palestinian Conflict in Historical and Normative
Perspective."
However, because the State Department has
placed a travel warning on Israel, University policy
prohibits OSP from funding undergraduate trips to
the country. But current trends suggest that the
warning may be lifted in the near future.
The bill proposed that the Senate encourage
preparations for the program, which would take
place at Western Galilee College in the city of
Akko, so that the center could be launched as early
as September 2006 if Israel is removed from the
State Department's warning list.
Badawi Qawasmi, a graduate student in civil
engineering and member of the Organization of

Arab Students at Stanford, spoke against this bill at
the meeting. He argued that because the course
would be taught at an Israeli university, the teach
ing would likely be one-sided.
In response, sophomore Lyuba Wolf, a member
of the Stanford Israel Alliance, said that the student
body of the host university in Israel was 50 percent
Arab, and therefore those in the program would be
exposed to a range of perspectives.
Former Elections C ommissioner Troy Steinmetz,
a sophomore, said it is the University's job to deter
mine if the course material is fair and balanced, not
the Senate's I le added that the Senate should be tak
ing a stance on whether the administration should
continue planning the trip even though Israel is cur
rently on the travel advisory list.
Ultimately, the bill was tabled to give senators
the opportunity to further research the matter.
In this year's spring ASSU elections, 52 percent
of undergraduates voted in support of an opt-out
policy on door-to-door distribution, which allows
distribution in dormitories unless residents vote to
disallow it. The issue was couched as a referendum
on the ballot and was included for purely advisory
purposes.
This vote prompted a bill that would encourage
Residential Education and resident fellows to
adopt an opt-out policy when it comes to student
publications.
Representatives from The Stanford Progressive
and The Stanford Review argued in favor of the
bill's passage,stating that the current policy hinders

their right to free speech. Senator Kai Lukoff, a
freshman, said that if the policy were to be
changed, publications must not disregard signs pro
hibiting door-to-door distribution at some resi
dences.
The bill was passed in a 9-2 vote, with three sen
ators abstaining.
The meeting's final bill dealt with the
University's divestment from oil companies that do
business in Sudan.
The Sudanese government, charged with fund
ing groups committing genocide in the Darfur
region, receives much of its revenue from selling
oil rights to companies such as PetroChina, ABB
Ltd., Sinopec and Tatneft. Stanford is invested in
these petroleum firms, which advocates of divest
ment say indirectly facilitate the genocide in
Darfur.
The Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility recently recommended that the
University divest from these companies. The
Senate bill proposed that the student government
second this recommendation.
Former Undergraduate Senate Chair Chris Lin.
a senior, and Senator Omar Shakir, a sophomore,
expressed concern that if the bill were to be
approved, the Senate could become swamped with
even more divestment requests. They suggested
that the Senate create set criteria for when divest
ment should be advocated.
The bill passed in an 11-0 vote, with three sena
tors abstaining.
