# Plans for luxury hotel progress
## Menlo Park Council reviews Stanford's preliminary designs for Sand Hill Road resort 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's plans fora 165,000 square-foot luxury
hotel on University-owned land on Sand Hill Road
have gone to the Menlo Park City Council for initial
approval. The hotel complex, located near the 280 free
way, will also include 100,000 square feet of office
space.
The building will also include a restaurant, spa, fit
ness center and five extended-stay villas, in addition to
120 guest rooms, said Menlo Park Development
Services Manager Justin Murphy in a city council staff
report. The office space would be used primarily by
"the venture capital community, attorneys, accountants
— very similar to the business community on Sand Hill
already," said Bill Phillips, a spokesman for the
Stanford Management Company, in an interview with
The Daily.
Stanford officials first pitched the idea for the hotel
to the Menlo Park City Council during a study session
on May 24.
"All that's happened so far is the study session,
which precedes a formal application," said David
Boesch, the Menlo Park city manager. "It's a concept
plan that gives the city council a chance to ask initial
questions."
He added that the city expects Stanford to file a for
mal application within the next couple weeks.
"Upon receiving [the application], the Council will
make an initial review of the scope of the work and ini
tiate an environmental review," Boesch said. "It'll take
about a year for all the environmental review to be
compiled and the changes made."
The plan seemed to be "favorably received by the
council,"he said.
The 21-acre plot adjacent to Sand Hill Road and

Interstate 280, where the hotel will he built, was previ
ously marked as the site of a 350-room Westin in the
late 1980s, hut that project never came to fruition.
The current hotel complex would require several
concessions from current Menlo Park regulations. For
instance, the maximum legal building height is current
ly 30 feet and the new hotel would stand 35 feet tall.
Murphy wrote in a report. The city would also have to
rezone the land for hotel use.
The design of the hotel, should it be built, will pay
homage to Sunset Magazine and the beauty of the
American west.
"It'll be a modernist approach to the classic ranch
style — lots of windows, high ceilings, large eaves and
overhangs," Phillips told The Daily about the hotel's
design. "It won't be mission style. It'll look like a lot of
other houses in the area."
Stanford officials are busy verbally sketching a
design "inspired by the rich heritage of the relaxed
California Adobe vernacular and have a low-rise
design that will blend into the surrounding landscape
and development," according to the article in The
Almanac on May 25.
Palo Alto architect John C. Hill of Hill Glazier
Architects would design the hotel.
The many buildings comprising the hotel would be
integrated into a village of smaller structures inter
spersed with "intimate courtyards," The Almanac, a
Menlo Park-based weekly newspaper, reported. The
structures will be arranged to provide guests with an
optimum view of the foothills.
Stanford owns the land parcel but will not be build
ing the hotel on its own. The University has teamed up
with Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, a company known
for its Mansion on TUrtle Creek hotel in Dallas and
The Carlyle hotel in New York City, which will operate
and manage the hotel.
The Menlo City Council will make the hotel pro
posal a top priority because of its central location and
because of the revenue it will generate for the city in
sales taxes.
In an article in The Almanac, Menlo Park Mayor
Mickie Winkler agreed that the hotel could be an
excellent money-maker for the city, adding that it
might reduce traffic because guests wouldn't have to
travel through the downtown area to get to their hotel.
