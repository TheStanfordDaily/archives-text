# Advice on Individual Retirement Accounts
## SSE holds office hours 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Student
Enterprises Capital Group, a stu
dent-run financial organization that
offers banking services to student
groups, held a drop-in information
session last Friday to educate the
student body about retirement sav
ings accounts with particular
emphasis on Roth IRAs, or
Individual Retirement Accounts.
IRAs allow people to capitalize
on tax advantages to save for retire
ment. Roth IRAs are different
from traditional IRAs because they
allow the account owner to invest
the funds in both stocks and mutu
al funds. Many people prefer Roth
IRAs because withdrawals and
deposits can be made tax-free.
There are also fewer limitations on
withdrawals from Roth IRAs than
from traditional retirement
accounts.
The event was part of the
Capital Group's educational initia
tive on retirement. While profes
sionals and faculty members usual
ly speak at the group's workshops,
the Roth IRA information session
was led entirely by students.
"The SSE Capital Group trains
us to offer informal educational
advice — we're not acting as invest

ment advisors," said junior Max
Mednik, fund manager for the
Capital Group. "We want people to
know we can help them in an infor
mal setting. It's just like office hours
for teachers."
While the organizers, which
included freshman Capital Group
members Own Li and Divya
Nettimi, were available to answer
questions on all aspects of invest
ment, many students who attended
came with questions on Roth IRAs.
Because those in lower income
brackets can contribute more to a
Roth IRA fund, Mednik said that
the account is a good choice for stu
dents.
"Our purpose is to get a lot of
information that is useful to stu
dents out to them since a lot of the
information is hard to access,"
Nettimi said.
"We want to make the office
hours as applicable to everyone as
we can," Mednik said. "The title
Roth IRA day is to attract more
people — people have heard about
it. We also want people to learn
about investing in general through
an interest in the Roth IRA."
Mednik offered general advice
to most of the students who visited.
"Be regular about investing," he
said. "Set goals, like depositing $100
a month. And learn as much as you
can. There's no bad investing or
wrong investing. The most impor
tant thing is to start out."
The five students who took
advantage of the office hours
ranged from juniors to a fifth year
graduate student. In general, they
said that the information session
gave them a foundation of invest
ment knowledge.

"I was expecting personal
investment advice and the event
met my expectations, although from
the advertising poster, I expected at
least one professional banker [to be
present]," junior Charles Hallford
said.
Overall, SSE Capital Group
members said they were pleased
with the small but enthusiastic
turnout.
"These office hours can be pret
ty sporadic," he said. "Sometimes
we get a lot of people and some
times a few. But honestly as long as
we can help one person — it's
worth it and we're happy."
