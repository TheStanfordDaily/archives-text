# Card can't solve Vols' Abbott, lose series 2-0

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Lauren Lappin's disappointment at
Stanford's (43-16) elimination from this
year's NCAA softball tournament was evi
dent during the post-game press confer
ence. With her voice breaking at times, the
Stanford junior shortstop tried to explain
what happened in the No. 5 Cardinal's 6-0
loss to No. 11 Tennessee (64-13).
"It was definitely frustrating today
because we could not catch a break,"
Lappin said, struggling to hold back tears.
"We were hitting the ball well but to play
ers. As my Dad would say, the softball gods
were not on our side this weekend."
Almost anyone present at Boyd and Jill
Smith Family Stadium during the third
inning of Saturday's game would agree.
The Cardinal's potent lineup, a force
throughout the season, was shutout for
seven innings by the Lady Vols' Monica
Abbott (47-7).
The typically dominant pitching tan
dem of freshman Becky McCullough and
junior Laura Severson was touched for
nine hits, five which came in the third. But
the Cardinal duo only gave up three
earned runs during the entire game, and
Stanford's loss came down to errors and
missed opportunities.
"I respect and care for Stanford's stu
dent-athletes, and it seems like a lot of
things went our way today," said Tennessee
head coach Ralph Weekly. "Monica
pitched outs, and we got the key hits."
The Lady Vols had reached base once
prior to the third inning, on a hit and then
on an error by freshman first baseman
Erin Howe, but they failed to score.
Sarah Fekete led off the five-run rally
in the third. Two singles later, Tennessee
scored the first run of the game with a
bouncer to centerfield. That prompted
Stanford head coach John Rittman to pull
McCullough, and Severson pitched the
rest of the game in relief.
According to Rittman, McCullough was
taken out early in consideration of the
possibility of a double-header (the Super
Regional was a best-of-three series. If
Stanford came back to win, the deciding
game would have taken place later that
afternoon).
Tennessee's next hitter, Katherine
Card, hit the ball through Severson's legs
to load the bases and from then on, things

began to unravel for the Cardinal.
Freshman second baseman Tricia
Aggabao couldn't snag a line drive but
picked it up and fired to Lappin who was
covering second for what was an apparent
force out. But the runner was ruled safe,
and Lappin was given an error for step
ping off the bag.
"This game was not indicative of our
defense," Rittman said. "I believe we were
one of the best defensive teams in the Pac
-10. A couple of things factored into this
today. You can't give a good team outs."
Severson struck out the next batter, but
Kenora Posey reached first when Howe
was unable to handle Aggabao's throw.
Tennessee extended the 3-0 lead with a
two-run single to center.
"We had got runners on before and did
n't hit them in," said Lindsay Schutzler,
who went 2-for-4. "When the inning came
around we did get the hits and breaks we
needed. Everyone came through ... the
pinch hitters were getting hits."
Tennessee tacked on an insurance run
in the sixth inning.
Following a hit batsmen in the first, and
a hit by Howe in the second, Abbott shut
down the Cardinal offense for the rest of
the game. Howe tallied the Cardinal's only
hit of the day as Tennessee completed a
two-game sweep to move on to the
College Softball World Series in
Oklahoma next week.
Tennessee won Friday night's game 2-0.
McCullough took the complete game loss,
allowing one earned run on four hits.
Sophomore leftfielder Jackie Rinehart was
the the only member of the Stanford team
to find success against Abbott, going 2-for
3.
"We had nothing to lose facing
Abbott," Lappin said, adding that the left
hander has a lot of pitches that work for
her. "The pressure is on her [Abbott] to be
great. She just beat a great team two days
in a row."
The Lady Vols can hope to continue to
ride on Abbott's success in the circle. They
will make their first appearance at the
World Series, where they hope to build on
a Division I single-season record 48
shutouts.
Stanford, on the other hand, packs up
its season one step short of its goal of
reaching the World Series for the second

Junior pitcher Laura Severson throws to first in Saturday's 6-0 loss to Tennessee. Stanford struggled to generate much offense in the series.
consecutive year. The Cardinal,
however, did set some records of
their own. Freshman Michelle
Smith shattered the Stanford sin
gle-season home run record and
the Cardinal clinched a share of
their first Pacific-10 Conference
title in school history.
And though Stanford is out of
the tournament earlier than
expected, the squad looks pre
pared for next season.
"Our pitching was uncertain
going into the year," Rittman said.
"Laura stepped up early and was a
true leader for our pitching staff.

All year we were looking to see
who would step up. Becky blos
somed to be our go-to pitcher. She
has great poise on the mound and
holds her emotions well. Becky
has a great future for us."
Though the freshman came in
handy this season for Rittman's
team, six seniors made significant
contributions and will be sorely
missed. Leah Nelson, Elizabeth
Bendig, Megan Sickler, Katherine
Hoffman, Michelle Thiry and
Heather Shook all played their
final game on the Farm on
Saturday in front of a packed
house.
"I didn't know this was going to
be my last game," Nelson said. "I
did enjoy my time here at
Stanford and 1 had a great time
here."
