# Baseball falls to USC

### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford (32-23, 12-12 Pacific-10 Conference)
and No. 21 Southern California (37-19, 15-9) met
over the weekend for their final series of the season
— and their last chance to make a statement before
the NCAA Tournament's field of 64 was announced
Monday morning.
The Trojans' steady pitching and effective offense
carried them to two close wins — 5-2 on Friday and
4-2 on Sunday — and USC was rewarded by being
named a No. 2 seed in the Long Beach Regional.
The Cardinal, who mustered a 14-3 victory in Los
Angeles on Saturday, ended the season in disap
pointing fashion, losing three of their final four Pac
-10 series. Stanford lost its bid to host a regional and
will head to the Baylor Regional.
The Cardinal tied Washington for sixth place in
the Pac-10 despite winning the league crown for the
past two years. USC secured itself a third-place tie in
the Pac-10 with Arizona State.
Going into the eighth inning of Sunday's rubber
game, the Cardinal had a legitimate chance to snag a
victory and a more positive regular season finale.
Sophomore reliever Blake Holler was moved to the
starting spot for the contest but was lifted in favor of
freshman Nolan Gallagher after allowing two early
runs. Gallagher held the Trojans' bats quiet, while
his teammates put up two runs — including a solo
shot by sophomore designated hitler Ryan Seawell
— to knot the game.
But the bottom of the eighth inning held a famil
iar demon for Cardinal pitchers — the sacrifice
bunt. Gallagher allowed a single to lead off the
inning and the runner was promptly advanced to
second by a sacrifice bunt. Gallagher gave up anoth
er base knock and hit a batter to load the bases
before junior closer Matt Manship was waved out of
the bullpen. Ibe first batter he faced, pinch-hitter
Dale Legaspi, dropped a bunt back to the mound
and scored the go-ahead run from third. USC tacked
on an insurance run on a throwing error by sopho
more third baseman Adam Sorgi.
Gallagher took his fifth loss of the year, while
USC starter Jack Spradlin — who was originally
slated to pitch Saturday — pitched well but received
a no decision.
The Trojan batters also came through for their
pitching staff on Friday night. They put up one run in
the fifth, then mounted a live-hit, three-run sixth
inning against Cardinal starter junior Mark
Romanczuk, who returned to the Friday starting
spot for the first time since April 15. Romanczuk
took the loss after six innings on the mound, drop
ping his season record to 5-6.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, struggled
against USC's sophomore ace, lan Kennedy, who is
widely regarded as one of the top pitchers in the
conference. Stanford's offense was able to force
Kennedy into an early exit in their last meeting, but
on Friday the righthander tossed eight complete
innings, allowing only one earned run.
Most of the Cardinal's offense last weekend
came in Saturday's blowout, as the team scored 14
runs without a single home run. The top two spot in
the order, Sorgi and junior Chris Minaker, had three
hits apiece, as did junior designated hitter Ben
Summerhays. The trio combined for seven runs
scored. Four Stanford players had multiple RBI
games, with Minaker and junior John Hester each
picking up four. The effort was highlighted by a five
run, four-hit ninth inning, which buried any chance

USC had fora comeback.
Junior starter Jeff Gilmore threw his third com
plete game of the season to gain the win and push
his record to 10-2, matching his record last season.
The righthander managed only one strikeout, but
also walked just one batter, and used his defense to
put the Trojans away.
The Cardinal will be back in action this weekend
in Waco, Texas, when they face Texas Christian (40-
18) in the Baylor Regional.

Junior shortstop Chris Minaker and the Cardinal lost two of three games at USC in their final regular-season series of the
year. While Stanford will not host a regional at Sunken Diamond, it earned an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament.
