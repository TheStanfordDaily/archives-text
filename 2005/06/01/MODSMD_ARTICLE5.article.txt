# Alcohol allowed on the Row during NSO week
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Small groups of students on the Row will
be able to drink beer, wine and malt liquor this
fall during New Student Orientation, or NSO,
University officials announced last week.
Hard alcohol will still be off-limits in
common areas — even on the Row — under
the new policy, and the changes will be on a
one-year trial basis. Whether the changes
become permanent depends on the behavior
of students this fall.
"The responsibility is now placed on stu

dents" said Ralph Castro, an alcohol and
drug educator at Vaden Health Center.
"Students are the caretakers of this privilege.
If there are violations this year, it will be
revoked."
Previously, alcohol policy banned con
sumption of alcohol in common spaces in
University housing during NSO. Students
living on the Row last September could not
check into their residences unless they
signed a document agreeing that they would
not host any "formal or informal house gath-
ering where alcohol is served" and
that they would not serve or provide
alcohol to new students.
Senior Andrew Waxman, a resi
dent assistant in Haus Mitteleuropa,
said the loosening of the policy came
after resident assistants on the Row
expressed reservations about the
effect the ban was having on RA-res
ident relationships.
"The interpretation of the Row
staff was that we should avoid having
alcohol in any open spaces in resi
dences," Waxman said. "It was chal
lenging during that period for Row
RAs to try to maintain dry hallways."
He added that the policy resulted
in frustration among residents and
an awkward beginning to the year.
Waxman led the drive to change
the policy, meeting with the

University's Alcohol Advisory Board
in January and consulting with Castro
and others to submit a revised trial
policy to Greg Boardman, interim
dean of student affairs.
"This was a wonderful example of
how students brought an issue to the
Alcohol Advisory Board, had
exhaustive discussions and came to a
consensus," Castro said.
The new policy, however, still
places limits on drinking during
NSO. For example, the old policy
remains in effect for all upperclass
residences not on the Row.
Castro said the changes apply
only to the Row because upperclass
men have traditionally been allowed
to move in six to seven nights before
classes start, much earlier than other
dorms on campus. Subjecting Row
residents, many of whom are over
the legal drinking age, to a complete
ly dry week when the social life of
residences begins to gear up was
unreasonable, he added.
Under the new rules, administra

tors expect drinking to occur on a
small scale on the Row during NSO,
Castro added.
"It's not a party. It's not an event.
It's a social gathering," he said. "We
don't want to hear 'Oh cool, we can
have a rager in Bob.' No, you can't.
This is meant to be a chance for stu
dents to catch up, talk about their
trip to Chile over the summer and
enjoy a few drinks."
In a written statement to The
Daily, Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo stressed
the importance of student behavior
under the new guidelines.
"We take this step cautiously to
insure that students appreciate the
responsibility that comes with such a
privilege," she said. "We still expect
that any service of alcohol will be
done lawfully and responsibly, with
students themselves prepared to
take action to prevent any possible
abuses or threats to student or com
munity safety."
