## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It had been a season of narrowly missed opportunities for
the No. 22 Stanford men's tennis team and the NCAA
Individual Tournament proved to be no different. In the team
competition, the Cardinal (14-11, 4-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
lost to Pepperdine in a tight match on May 15, and this past
Sunday in College Station, Texas, Stanford's only doubles duo
to enter the NCAA tournament fell in the semifinals in a close
two-setter.
No. 2 seeded senior Sam Warburg and junior KC Corkery
advanced to the semifinals of the doubles bracket before
falling to Louisiana State's Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski,
7-6.6-4. The Tigers were then defeated 7-6, 7-5 in the champi
onship match on Monday by Georgia's John Isner and Antonio
Ruiz.
Corkery and Warburg together had never faced Growcott
and Skupski team before and therefore were not as familiar
with the Tigers as they had been with previous opponents in
the tournament. The duo from LSU served first in the match
but quickly got down 15-40 in the first game. On break point,
Corkery ripped a forehand, but his opponent at the net hit a
reflex volley fora winner, eluding the Cardinal of their oppor
tunity to break and start the match on a strong note.
"If we had broken serve there, it may have been a whole
different match," head coach John Whitlinger said. "It would
have given us confidence. We had some [other] chances but
didn't have a lot of break points. Both of the LSU guys came
up with big serves when they needed to. with aces or unre
turnables."
Following the match. LSU head coach Jefl Brown told
Whitlinger that Sunday's match was the best his team's duo
had played all year. Both teams played a strong match in terms
of service games, and both pairs held serve throughout the
match except for one game in the second set where Corkery's
serve was broken, ultimately leading to Stanford s defeat.
Prior to facing LSU. Stanford's pair faced Washington's No.
18 Daniel Chu and Alex Slovic in the Round of 16 on Friday.
The 2(M)4 NCAA doubles champions had met the Huskies
twice previously this season, losing to the pair in Seattle but
defeating them 8-6 in the finals of the Pac-10 Individual
Tournament.
Corkery and Warburg handed Washington a 6-3,6-4 defeat
to advance to the quarterfinals where they would face another
Pac-10 foe. Arizona's No. 20 Roger Matalonga and Colin
O'Grady.
"[Arizona's] a team that is dangerous," Whitlinger said "but
we knew them and it was nice to play another Pac-10 team. Its
nice when you play a team that you know a little bit, when you
know where to serve and what their tendencies might be.
Corkery and Warburg had defeated the Wildcats 8-5 on two
previous occasions, and Stanford appeared to be headed toward
another victory. The Cardinal won the first set 6-3 and led 5-2 in
the second. When it looked as if Stanford was on its way to the
