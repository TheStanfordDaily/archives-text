# Corkery / Warburg can't defend title Stanford duo falls in semis
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It had been a season of narrowly missed opportunities for
the No. 22 Stanford men's tennis team and the NCAA
Individual Tournament proved to be no different. In the team
competition, the Cardinal (14-11, 4-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
lost to Pepperdine in a tight match on May 15, and this past
Sunday in College Station, Texas, Stanford's only doubles duo
to enter the NCAA tournament fell in the semifinals in a close
two-setter.
No. 2 seeded senior Sam Warburg and junior KC Corkery
advanced to the semifinals of the doubles bracket before
falling to Louisiana State's Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski,
7-6.6-4. The Tigers were then defeated 7-6, 7-5 in the champi
onship match on Monday by Georgia's John Isner and Antonio
Ruiz.
Corkery and Warburg together had never faced Growcott
and Skupski team before and therefore were not as familiar
with the Tigers as they had been with previous opponents in
the tournament. The duo from LSU served first in the match
but quickly got down 15-40 in the first game. On break point,
Corkery ripped a forehand, but his opponent at the net hit a
reflex volley fora winner, eluding the Cardinal of their oppor
tunity to break and start the match on a strong note.
"If we had broken serve there, it may have been a whole
different match," head coach John Whitlinger said. "It would
have given us confidence. We had some [other] chances but
didn't have a lot of break points. Both of the LSU guys came
up with big serves when they needed to. with aces or unre
turnables."
Following the match. LSU head coach Jefl Brown told
Whitlinger that Sunday's match was the best his team's duo
had played all year. Both teams played a strong match in terms
of service games, and both pairs held serve throughout the
match except for one game in the second set where Corkery's
serve was broken, ultimately leading to Stanford s defeat.

was down 5-6 in the second and
looking to break Arizona's serve to
stay in the set. Corkery and
Warburg broke serve and narrowly
captured the tiebreaker, 7-5.
"All of a sudden, (Arizona] got
hot, and we got a little cold,"
Whitlinger said. "They won four

straight games, and we had to break
serve to get a tiebreaker. Luckily, we
did break, but you never know what
[could have] happened if they had
won that second set. KC and Sam
pulled it together in time and did a
good job of breaking at 6-5 and
played a good tiebreaker. It was a
pretty routine match that almost got
away from us."
While they fell short of their goal
of repeating as NCAA champions,
Corkery and Warburg had another
strong season. The duo finished 38-
7 and won title at the Wilson / ITA
Regional Championship and the
Pacific Coast Doubles

Championship, as well as the Pac-10
doubles championship. They were
also named the Pac-10 Doubles
leam of the Year.
"Going to [College Station], I
told [KC and Sam] that they had
bulls-eyes on their hacks, and every
body was going to be giving them
their best shot." Whitlinger said.
"We're all disappointed, but I'm
very proud of them. It's not easy to
defend the title. I know they would
have loved to [win] back-to-back
[titles], but that doesn't happen
often. They should be very proud of
what they've accomplished in the
last couple years."
