### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
For the first time in 10 years. Sunken Diamond
will not be a regional site in the NCAA playoffs.
But the Cardinal (32-23) secured a postseason bid
lor the 12th consecutive year as a No. 3 seed in the
region hosted by Baylor, the fourth-ranked team in
the nation. Stanford will travel to Waco, Texas, this
weekend for the three-day tournament and will
begin play on Friday at noon PST against No. 2 seed
Texas Christian University. Baylor, meanwhile, will
match up against No. 4 seed Texas-San Antonio.
Stanford has not played against any of the three
teams since it began keeping track of its game-by
game results in 1959.
The Cardinal received at-large bids in each of
the last two years, clinching their postseason spot by
winning the Pacific-10 Conference. But this year,
Stanford slipped to a sixth-place tie in the Pac-10
with a record of 12-12. TTie Cardinal dropped two
out of three to Southern California in their final
series of the year. They will enter the regional on a
skid, having lost eight of their last 13 games.
The TCU Horned Frogs (40-18, 20-10
Conference USA), making the first postseason
appearance in the school's history, will present a
formidable challenge to head coach Mark
Marquess' squad.TCU tied for the C-USA champi
onship in the end-of-the year tournament when its
game with llilane. the top national seed, was rained
out.TUlane is the only team that managed to beat
the Horned Frogs in a best-of-three conference
series this year.
TCU's bread-and-butter is its powerful offense.
The team hit .310 this year, belted 70 homers and
scored 417 runs. Stanford, by comparison, hit .288,
with only 47 homers and 357 runs.
The Horned Frogs boast one of the best pitchers
in the Regional, junior Lance Broadway, who is 14-
1 on the year with a 1.67 ERA. He will match up
against one of Stanford's co-aces on Friday, either
junior Mark Romanczuk (5-6, 4.33) or junior Jeff
Gilmore (10-2,3.56).
Baylor (39-21, 19-8 Big 12) made the tourna
ment as the fourth national seed despite a record
that looks like it would put them somewhere near
the middle of the pack. Head coach Steve Smith
tried to explain his team's high selection.
"Certainly [our schedule] translated into a high
RPI and that, in combination with our record and
