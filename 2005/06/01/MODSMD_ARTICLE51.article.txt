## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
For the first time in 10 years. Sunken Diamond
will not be a regional site in the NCAA playoffs.
But the Cardinal (32-23) secured a postseason bid
lor the 12th consecutive year as a No. 3 seed in the
region hosted by Baylor, the fourth-ranked team in
the nation. Stanford will travel to Waco, Texas, this
weekend for the three-day tournament and will
begin play on Friday at noon PST against No. 2 seed
Texas Christian University. Baylor, meanwhile, will
match up against No. 4 seed Texas-San Antonio.
Stanford has not played against any of the three
teams since it began keeping track of its game-by
game results in 1959.
The Cardinal received at-large bids in each of
the last two years, clinching their postseason spot by
winning the Pacific-10 Conference. But this year,
Stanford slipped to a sixth-place tie in the Pac-10
with a record of 12-12. TTie Cardinal dropped two
out of three to Southern California in their final
series of the year. They will enter the regional on a
skid, having lost eight of their last 13 games.
The TCU Horned Frogs (40-18, 20-10
Conference USA), making the first postseason
appearance in the school's history, will present a
formidable challenge to head coach Mark
Marquess' squad.TCU tied for the C-USA champi
onship in the end-of-the year tournament when its
game with llilane. the top national seed, was rained
out.TUlane is the only team that managed to beat
the Horned Frogs in a best-of-three conference
series this year.
TCU's bread-and-butter is its powerful offense.
The team hit .310 this year, belted 70 homers and
scored 417 runs. Stanford, by comparison, hit .288,
with only 47 homers and 357 runs.
The Horned Frogs boast one of the best pitchers
in the Regional, junior Lance Broadway, who is 14-
1 on the year with a 1.67 ERA. He will match up
against one of Stanford's co-aces on Friday, either
junior Mark Romanczuk (5-6, 4.33) or junior Jeff
Gilmore (10-2,3.56).
Baylor (39-21, 19-8 Big 12) made the tourna
ment as the fourth national seed despite a record
that looks like it would put them somewhere near
the middle of the pack. Head coach Steve Smith
tried to explain his team's high selection.
"Certainly [our schedule] translated into a high
RPI and that, in combination with our record and
our finish in the conference, those
are the two things that have vaulted
us into that high of a national
seed," he said.
Baylor has the best all-around
pitching staff of any team in the
regional, something that is crucial
in regional play because a team
could play up to five games in one
weekend. The Bears' staff has a
3.33 ERA. and the team has a sta
ble of six pitchers with more than
50 innings pitched and ERAs of
4.03 or below. Baylor's ace, Mark
McCormick, has posted a 3.08
ERA this year to go with a 7-3
record.
Smith called Texas-San
Antonio's late-season surge "one
of the best stories in college base
ball this year." The Roadrunners
(27-32, 14-13 Southland
Conference) lost their first 11
games of the year but started to
turn their season around with a 9-
4 upset of Notre Dame on March
9. The Roadrunners went on to win
their Conference tournament and
receive the SLC's automatic bid.
making the postseason for the first
time since 1994.
The winners of the first round
games will face each other on
Saturday in Game 3. Saturday's
contests will also pit the losers of
the two games against each other in
an elimination match in Game 4.
The winner of Game 4 and the
loser of Game 3 will play on
Sunday to determine which teams
goes to the Championship game.
That will be held on Sunday after
noon, with another game on
Monday, if necessary.

Gallagher,.to advance past this weekend's Baylor Regional in Waco, Texas.
