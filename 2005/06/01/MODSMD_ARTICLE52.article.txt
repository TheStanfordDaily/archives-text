### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Without a doubt, Saturday's NCAA Doubles Final
was a Stanford aflair.
The No. 1 Cardinal finished out a perfect 27-0 sea
son and went on to send all seven of its starting play
ers, including two tough doubles teams, to the NCAA
Individual Tournament.
In the final match the season, junior Alice Barnes
and senior Erin Burdette closed out a 6-3, 6-4 victory
over No. 36 junior Amber Liu and sophomore Anne
Yelsey at Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga. It
marked only the third time in NCAA Championship
history that all four doubles finalists hailed from the
same school.
Stanford is no stranger to making headlines in the
recent history of women's tennis. Proud owners of 14
NCAA titles and an 18-year dynasty of Pacific-10

served out a perfect four points at 5-4 to clinch the
match in straight sets.
Having already served out three-set decisions

"Alice and I were both a little nervous fora second,
but we managed to come back and win," Burdette said.
"Alice was finishing off the points really well at the net,
and I was used to the position fof serving for the
match] from earlier in the week."
Ever the modest teammate, Barnes, a junior, main
tains that her valiant partner did most of the work in
attaining the win.
"I didn't hit anything at love-30, and to me, Erin just
played perfect after that," Barnes said. "The prospect
of going to 5-all in that set me had me very nervous. It's
that point when you have the match within you grasp
that you start to get nervous. But Erin, she just won the
whole thing."
In addition to the playful debate over how exact
ly the Stanford duo rose to victory, Barnes' self
effacing testimonies give way to the emotional ten
sions stemming from playing two very close team
mates.
"In terms of score, it wasn't the closest match, but it
