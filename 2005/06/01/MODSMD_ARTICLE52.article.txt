# Barnes and Burdette win doubles title
## 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Without a doubt, Saturday's NCAA Doubles Final
was a Stanford aflair.
The No. 1 Cardinal finished out a perfect 27-0 sea
son and went on to send all seven of its starting play
ers, including two tough doubles teams, to the NCAA
Individual Tournament.
In the final match the season, junior Alice Barnes
and senior Erin Burdette closed out a 6-3, 6-4 victory
over No. 36 junior Amber Liu and sophomore Anne
Yelsey at Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga. It
marked only the third time in NCAA Championship
history that all four doubles finalists hailed from the
same school.
Stanford is no stranger to making headlines in the
recent history of women's tennis. Proud owners of 14
NCAA titles and an 18-year dynasty of Pacific-10
Conference honors, the otherwise rare national show
down of Stanford's top two doubles duos seemed only
to continue a long-standing Cardinal trend.
But for Burdette, a senior who endured a roller
coaster year of injuries, her final collegiate triumph
rang truer to her than any praises past records could
ever sing.
Recouping a 3()-love deficit, the Atlanta, Ga., native
served out a perfect four points at 5-4 to clinch the
match in straight sets.
Having already served out three-set decisions
against the tournament's top seed in the second
round, and against a persistent Texas Christian duo in
the semifinal. Burdette played through a nerve-wrack
ing scenario with unprecedented confidence.
"Alice and I were both a little nervous fora second,
but we managed to come back and win," Burdette said.
"Alice was finishing off the points really well at the net,
and I was used to the position fof serving for the
match] from earlier in the week."
Ever the modest teammate, Barnes, a junior, main
tains that her valiant partner did most of the work in
attaining the win.
"I didn't hit anything at love-30, and to me, Erin just
played perfect after that," Barnes said. "The prospect
of going to 5-all in that set me had me very nervous. It's
that point when you have the match within you grasp
that you start to get nervous. But Erin, she just won the
whole thing."
In addition to the playful debate over how exact
ly the Stanford duo rose to victory, Barnes' self
effacing testimonies give way to the emotional ten
sions stemming from playing two very close team
mates.
"In terms of score, it wasn't the closest match, but it
was very emotionally and mentally
draining," Barnes said. "It was Erin's
last collegiate match, and we tried to
forget that it was our teammates on
the other side of the net. Honestly, it
was difficult after spending so much
time with them all week."
After two action-packed weeks
of hard-fought wins, two weeks of
playing to crowd loyalties and deep
seated rivalries, the all-Stanford
doubles final brought a lull to some
of the tournament's energy.
"You don't want to rub the win
in," Barnes said. "We perhaps
weren't as loud as we would have
been playing another school."
Liu and Yelsey cruised to the
final with four straight-set sweeps.
The pairing took care of
Northwestern's Audra Cohen and
Cristelle Cirier in a neat, no-frills
manner, tallying a 6-2,6-2 win.
The Wildcats' duo was seeded
second in at NCAAs, and finished
the season at a solid 38-9.
In the quarterfinals, Liu and
Yelsey rolled over UCLA's fourth
seeded tandem of Daniela Bercek
and Riza Zalameda (34-8), 6-3, 6-0.
The Bruins' defeat marked their sec
ond trouncing of the year by the
Stanford pair, the first of which
came in April.
Liu and Yelsey finish the year
with a 22-5 record.

While Liu and Yelsey's solid
results made their doubles run
appear effortless, Barnes and
Burdette slogged through a compe
tition with the odds stacked square
ly against them.
After a month of not playing
together in April, only the sheer
pluck of the unseeded duo could
propel them through a Round of 16
battle against the top-ranked dou
bles team, Georgia's Shadisha
Robinson and Caroline Basu (32-5).
Stanford crept by, 6-3,5-7,6-4.
Two days later, it would take a 6-
4, 3-6, 6-3 decision to send the
Horned Frogs' No. 29 Ana Cetnik
and Story Tweedie-Yates (26-6)
packing.
After a nail-biting regular sea
son, one more week of demands
wasn't about to stop Barnes and
Burdette from finishing strong.
"We'd been getting better and
better each day," Barnes said. "For
me, it was the thing I'll remember
the most out of the two weeks at
NCAAs. A month or two ago, Erin
couldn't lift her arm past her shoul
der. And now [she got] such a won
derful ending to her collegiate
career."
For Burdette, collegiate endings
give way to professional beginnings,
and claiming the doubles title was a
step in the right direction.
"My plan is to move to south
Florida and start training," Burdette
said. "I'm meeting with a team of
doctors next week to figure out the
best step for my shoulder and
rehab."
