### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Junior Michael Robertson set the tone for the
Cardinal track teams at the NCAA West Regionals in
Eugene, Ore., last weekend, by winning the discus com
petition in the very first event on Friday.
By Saturday evening, the men had seven NCAA

petition. I"he women had 15 automatic qualifiers and
won the regional meet, easily overtaking UCLA's 80
points with 110.5 points.
Four first-place finishes carried the Cardinal through
the two days of intense competition. To qualify for
NCAA Championships, individual athletes must finish
in the top five at Regionals. The next three finishers
enter into a descending order list and are selected
according to season-bests.
Robertson's winning 201' discus throw edged out 30
other competitors and earned him an automatic ride to
the NCAA championships to be held June 8 to 11.

descending order lists for possible NCAA champi
onship selection.
On day two, the men saw four more automatic
NCAA qualifying performances.
Junior Solomon Welch finished fifth in the triple
jump, with a mark of 51'7.25". Sophomore Feranmi
Okanlami was not far behind, with a seventh place fin

freshman Russell Brown took second and fifth, with
respective times of 3:44.69 and 3:45.40. Sage is the for

"It is with great competitiveness that Russell estab
lished himself as one of the best 1,500-meter athletes in
the region," Weir said.
Freshman Wopamo Osaisai showed off the high
expectations he sets for himself with a fourth-place fin
ish in the 100-meter dash, finishing in 10.57. Senior Nick
Sebes won a spot on the provisional list with an eighth
