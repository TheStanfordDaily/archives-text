### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
The members of the Stanford women's first var
sity boat headed to the NCAA Championships at
Rancho Cordova, Calif., looking to close their 2005
season with a flourish. They returned home after
placing 11th in a competitive field of 16 boats. It
wasn't the medal-finish the Cardinal had hoped for,
but it was a solid performance nonetheless.
Still, the members of the women's squad came
home wishing they could have put together a final
effort more reflective of their season as a whole.
The Cardinal entered the weekend knowing
they would have to combine impeccable tech
nique and coordination to hang with a field of
boats representing storied rowing programs. But
while maintaining a sense of respect for the chal
lenge facing them, the women approached their
task confident in their abilities.
"This weekend we faced a new, higher level of
competition than we [ever did] before this sea
son," junior Margit Zwemer said. "We couldn't
take anything for granted in any of our races, and
I don't think we did."
The Cardinal opened the weekend by taking
second place in their Friday morning heat to

advance to the semifinals. Racing one lane from
West Coast rival California, the Cardinal women
got a good jump off the line and ultimately man
aged to hold off the Washington boat's move over
the second 1,00() meters of the race.
In Saturday's competition, the Cardinal held
third place passing the 500-meter mark, but faded
in the second half of the race as powerhouses
Princeton, Yale, Brown and Ohio State pulled
away. With their fifth-place semifinal finish, the
Cardinal were eliminated from contention fora
spot in the Sunday Grand Final and were slated
into the Petite Final instead.
For the first 1,000 meters of their final race of
the year, the Cardinal looked strong and kept
themselves within striking distance of leaders
Brown and Tennessee. But the Stanford women
were unable to counter Michigan's move near the
500-meter mark and were nipped at the finish line
by a surging Southern California boat.
"Generally, we had one of the fastest starts
there and were strong through the first thousand
meters," Zwemer said. "But we began to fall back
from the lead pack after that point."
It was a bittersweet moment for the Cardinal
as they stood on the shore and watched California
walk through Princeton in the Grand Final to take

the NCAA title.
"It was good to see a West Coast school win it
all, and also good to know that we'll have some
one local to push against in our hunt to be on the
medal stand next year," Zwemer said.
As much progress as the women's squad
showed this year, members of the team said they
even higher hopes for their 2006 campaign.
"Although the results of this weekend were a bit
of a disappointment, we all agree we had a great
season and can't wait to do great things next year,"
sophomore Carly York said. "We work so hard dur
ing the year and fought so hard this weekend, 1
know this team is headed for bigger things."
If nothing else, witnessing the Grand Final lit a
fire that the Stanford women hope will take them
to new heights next year. The Cardinal took on
the eventual NCAA champion Golden Bears
once at Rancho Cordova and held their own, fin
ishing just over five seconds off the pace set by
their rivals in the Friday morning heat.
"We've consistently been five or six seconds
behind Cal â€” five or six seconds behind the
national champions," freshman Steph Morrison
said. "We're going to be looking to get rid of those
few extra seconds next year, [and] it's a very real
istic goal."
