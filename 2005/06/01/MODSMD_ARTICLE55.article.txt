# Team makes first appearance on golf's big stage since 2001
## Men's golf heads to NCAAs 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is uncharted territory.
For the past three years, June has
been a time of rest for the Stanford
men's golf team. A time to wonder
what went wrong and how the next
year will tell a different story. June,
the month when the best teams in
the country play for the NCAA
Championship, has been a Cardinal
free zone — until now.
With contributions from all five
starters at the NCAA West
Regional two weeks ago. Stanford
took advantage of its home-course
advantage to advance to its first
NCAA Championship since the
2(XX)-2(H)1 season. Ihe downside?
Coach Conrad Ray's lineup will tee
off in today's opening round with
about as much championship expe
rience as the guy serving drinks at
the 19th hole.
Nonetheless, as this young
Cardinal team sails into unknown
waters, they will benefit, as they
have all year, from the veteran
savvy of senior leaders Pat Phillips
and Kevin Blue. Playing their final
collegiate tournament, the two have
competed in a combined M events
over four years to get to this, their
first shot at a national title.
Maturing under the leadership of
Stanford greats like Phil Rowe and
Jim Seki during their freshman and
sophomore years, Phillips and Blue
have grabbed the reins this season,
helping Ray in his rookie season to
guide Stanford to an unexpected
championship birth. ITiis week's
lineup includes a freshman (Rob
Grube) and two sophomores (Zack
Miller and Matt Savage) in addition
to Blue and Phillips. As Stanford
joins the last 30 teams playing com
petitive golf this year, the mixture of
youth and experience seems to be
the perfect recipe for success.
Stanford's seniors couldn't have
come to the Farm from more dis
parate backgrounds. A Southern
boy, Phillips arrived from Athens,
Ga.,just a few hours' drive from the
sacred golf grounds of the Augusta
National Golf Club. Blue, on the
other had. was a NAFTA import
from Toronto, in Canada's Ontario

province.
Nonetheless, the two have united
for four years in pursuit of a com
mon goal, amassing 14 top-25 finish
es between them. Despite the fact
that neither has claimed an individ
ual tournament title, there is no

doubt about the contribution that
each has made on a weekly basis or
the void they will leave behind
when Saturday's final round signals
an end to a pair of solid careers.

Kevin Blue and fellow senior Pat Phillips hope to lead Stanford to a strong fin
ish at the NCAA Championship, which begins today in Owings Mills, Md.
But don't start the athletic eulo
gies just yet. As you may have
heard, for the first time in a while,
there's still some golf left to play.
The 108 th NCAA
Championship takes place at the

Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings
Mills, Md. The par-70 7,129-yard
beast is no stranger to big events (it
hosted the U.S. Senior Open in
2002) and should provide ample
challenge for the country's best col
lege players.
"We need to have fun and
remain positive," Phillips said.
"Caves Valley is a long, challenging
golf course, so patience is a key. Par
is a great score on any hole."

Despite the pleasant weather
conditions predicted for the dura
tion of the tournament, it will likely
be a week of high scores, where the
team that manages to maintain its
composure on a brutal layout will be
rewarded with a title.
The four-day event will begin
with one round per day today,
tomorrow and Friday, followed by a
narrowing of the 30-team field to
the top 15 before Saturday's final 18

holes.
Amidst the nation's top-ranked
teams, Stanford will once again ben
efit from an atmosphere of low
expectations after unexpectedly
working its way into the year's final
field. At the West Regional, the
Cardinal played a relaxed three
rounds that propelled them all the
way to Maryland. This week, they
will see if the magic can last for just
72 more holes.

"We have all played at a high
level before, plus we've been
preparing for this tournament all
year," Phillips said. "Our goal all
season long has been to qualify for
Nationals and play well at
Nationals."
National championship? Winner
take-all? These are uncharted
waters. Four days will tell whether
Stanford can sail to the ultimate
destination.
