# Team makes first appearance on golf's big stage since 2001
## Men's golf heads to NCAAs 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This is uncharted territory.
For the past three years, June has
been a time of rest for the Stanford
men's golf team. A time to wonder
what went wrong and how the next
year will tell a different story. June,
the month when the best teams in
the country play for the NCAA
Championship, has been a Cardinal
free zone â€” until now.
With contributions from all five
starters at the NCAA West
Regional two weeks ago. Stanford
took advantage of its home-course
advantage to advance to its first
NCAA Championship since the
2(XX)-2(H)1 season. Ihe downside?
Coach Conrad Ray's lineup will tee
off in today's opening round with
about as much championship expe
rience as the guy serving drinks at
the 19th hole.
Nonetheless, as this young
Cardinal team sails into unknown
waters, they will benefit, as they
have all year, from the veteran
savvy of senior leaders Pat Phillips
and Kevin Blue. Playing their final
collegiate tournament, the two have
competed in a combined M events
over four years to get to this, their
first shot at a national title.
Maturing under the leadership of
Stanford greats like Phil Rowe and
Jim Seki during their freshman and
sophomore years, Phillips and Blue
have grabbed the reins this season,
helping Ray in his rookie season to
guide Stanford to an unexpected
championship birth. ITiis week's
lineup includes a freshman (Rob
Grube) and two sophomores (Zack
Miller and Matt Savage) in addition
to Blue and Phillips. As Stanford
joins the last 30 teams playing com
petitive golf this year, the mixture of
youth and experience seems to be
the perfect recipe for success.
Stanford's seniors couldn't have
come to the Farm from more dis
parate backgrounds. A Southern
boy, Phillips arrived from Athens,
Ga.,just a few hours' drive from the
sacred golf grounds of the Augusta
National Golf Club. Blue, on the
other had. was a NAFTA import
from Toronto, in Canada's Ontario

province.
Nonetheless, the two have united
for four years in pursuit of a com
mon goal, amassing 14 top-25 finish
es between them. Despite the fact
that neither has claimed an individ
ual tournament title, there is no

doubt about the contribution that
each has made on a weekly basis or
the void they will leave behind
when Saturday's final round signals
an end to a pair of solid careers.
