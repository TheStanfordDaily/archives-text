# Superfly captures fifth title in Oregon
## 
### NEIL DAVIS STAFF WRITER 
Superfly, the Stanford
women's Ultimate team, cap
tured its fifth title in nine years
and a resting place amongst the
pantheon of sports dynasties at
Stanford.
"With five national champi
onships, we are now recognized
as the premier program in the
nation," Stanford junior captain
MaryLyn Stein said. "We have
the deepest team and every sin
gle player makes a major contri
bution."
While the rest of Stanford
lounged lazily around the Farm
enjoying the spoils of 80-degree
weather and Memorial Day bar
becues, Superfly faced 56-degree
weather, 10-mile-per-hour wind
gusts and the University of
Washington in the Women's
Division Finals at the 2005
College Championships in
Corvallis, Ore.
Upset by Washington 15-9 in
pool play on Friday, Superfly
dropped its number one seed and
advanced to Saturday's single
elimination round lacking a cov
eted first-round bye.
"Washington played a great
game, and we were not able to
elevate our level of play to
match them on Friday," Stein
said. "However, after the game

the team was confident that if we
saw them again in finals and
played to the best of our abili
ties, they would not be able to
stop us."
The teams' confidence
proved prescient, as Superfly,
buoyed by the great defensive
play of Jenny Burney and junior
Crystal Cook, would roll through
Saturday and earn a rematch
with Washington in the final.
"Younger players really
stepped up in our elimination
games and it was obvious that we
had a much deeper team than
our opponents," Superfly captain
senior Lauren Casey said. "They
all relied on three or four main
players, who got more and more
tired, while we kept our rotation
deep to utilize our speed and tal
ent."
Faced with Washington's
early attempt to dictate the pace
through a four person cup zone,
Superfly relied on the leadership
of Casey and Enessa Janes to
break the zone.
Led by Finals MVP Hannah
Griego, who completely denied
UW's top player, Miranda Roth,
Superfly scored early, and never
relinquished its lead. Superfly
defeated UW's 'Element' 15-12
in the final.
"We felt that both our loss
and our win were entirely dictat
ed by our own play," Stein said.
