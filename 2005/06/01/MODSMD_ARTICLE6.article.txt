### SARA INÉS CALDERÓN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore Giancarlo Colombo, a Dallas
native and Adelfa dorm resident, died Monday
in a train accident in Sunnyvale. His death was
preliminarily ruled a suicide by Santa Clara
County coroners yesterday, said Residence
Dean Jamila Rufalo to a crowd of about 100
people last night in the lounge of Eucalipto
dorm.
A spokesperson for the Santa Clara County
Coroner's Office confirmed the ruling, adding,
"There is still an ongoing investigation."
Rufalo said the incident occurred between
5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Monday after Colombo visit
ed family friends in San Jose. He suffered
severe injuries and died later that day.
Reverend Joanne Sanders, Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo, the
West Lagunita resident fellows — Gerry and
Mary Fuller — and Jennifer Gregory from
Counseling and Psychological Services, or
CAPS, were also in attendance.
As soon as Rufalo announced the coroner's

determination, many
of the students in
attendance broke
into tears. She
emphasized that if
students needed
time to mourn, their
studies could be
postponed. Faculty
members have been
informed of the situ
ation.
"I understand
that you have a lot of
questions," Rufalo
told the students. "1

don't have a lot of answers."
Mary Fuller shared her experience with her
brothers' suicide and assured students that
they should not blame themselves.
"There was nothing you could have done,"
she said.
