Construction will commence fora $24 million renovation
project of Old Union at the end of this year. Consequently,
the community centers housed in Old Union — the Asian
American Activities Center, El Centro Chicano and the
Native American Cultural Center — will be relocated tem
porarily to a complex of portable modular units in the park
ing lot at the intersection of Santa Teresa and Lomita.

Old Union's administrative offices — including the
Offices of Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid,
the Registrar, Student Financial Services, the cashier.
Housing Assignment Services and Residential Education —
will be permanently moved.
The renovation team plans to restore Old Union to its
original role as a central hub for students; 31,000 square feet
of new space for meeting rooms, a large "living room" com
mon area and a cafe will be added. The community centers
currently housed in Old Union will return to their original
locations once construction is complete.
Interim Dean of Student Affairs Greg Boardman said
the project is slated to finish up by fall of 2006.
While relocating to the modular units will be a major

The University plans to spend $24 million to restore Old Union into a student center.
change, community center staff
members said they are optimistic
that the project won't affect the
quality of their programming.
"The amount of space we are
going to have in the portables
will be comparable to the space
here," said El Centro Chicano
Assistant Director Chris
Gonzalez Clarke. He added that
student office space will be cut
back the most, but that the two
most used spaces, the computer
cluster and the lounge — which
also serves as meeting space for
multiple student groups — would
not change significantly.
Denni Woodward, the assistant
director of the Native American
Cultural Center, concurred that
the modular units are comparable
in size to the center's current
computer cluster, lounge and
office space.
The relocation is scheduled for
December, Woodward said. It will
affect the center's programming in
several ways — the library must be
rearranged, storage must be

obtained for student groups and
meals prepared in the center's
kitchen will have to be cooked
elsewhere.
Despite these changes,
Woodward said the Dean of
Students Office has been very sup
portive.
"It'll be nice having them closer
to us," said Ben Davidson, director
of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender Community Resource
Center, or LGBT-CRC. The center
is located in the Fire Truck House,
across the street from where the
portable units will be placed.
"We've been thinking about
having a block party with all the
centers," he said.
Directors and staff members at
the Asian American Activities
Center could not be reached for
comment.
The renovation will include
improvements to building systems,
disability access with elevators in
the Clubhouse and the Nitery, seis
mic strengthening and changes to
the interiors of the buildings.
Many student publications, the
ASSU, the Office of Student
Activities and the Office for
Religious Life will permanently
move into Old Union once the
project is complete.
