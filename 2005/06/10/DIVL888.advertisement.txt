... Whatever career you may choose for yourself-—
doctor, lawyer, teacher—let me propose an
avocation to be pursued along with it. Become a
deilicated fighter for civil rights. Make it a central
part of your life. It will make you a better doctor, a
better lawyer, a better teacher. It will enrich your
spirit as nothing else possibly can. It will give you
that rare sense of nobility that can only spring from
love and selflessly helping your fellow man. Make a
career of humanity. Commit yourself to the noble
struggle for human rights. You will make a greater
person of yourself, a greater nation of your country,
and a finer world to live in.
