1 A 2000 High School graduate you wanted to be;
Sin three short years you were free.
A triple major at the U of I
Made seven semesters fly by.
Yet Stanford returned with its elusive charm;
At last, MS&E gave you a ho?rie on the Farm!
With all the diplomas and degree,
What will the future hold for thee?
I
h Congratulations! Love, Mom, Dad, & Kimberly!
