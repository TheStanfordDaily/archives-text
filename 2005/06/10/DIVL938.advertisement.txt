One beautiful morning from the heavens came down
many little angels an J one of them was for me.
/ took care of this little angel as God instructed me to do.
Time passed and when his wings grew my little angel
left happy fora far away place to pursue his studies
with a hig hag full of dreams, hopes, good intentions
and with purpose to follow life's road.
With God as his guide and protector my angel was
given support, decision making, intelligence, valor,
perseverance, blessings, and courage to reach his goals;
such is the God that today we give infinite thanks.
Thank you God for giving me this angel that you
allowed me to care for, to nurture, to clothe and to
assist him in becoming a man. This angel is my son.
My son is Jorge Alejandro Caballero Becerra (Coki).
We are very proud of you, Jorge,
and congratulate you in your degree of Chemistry with a
Biological Science minor.
