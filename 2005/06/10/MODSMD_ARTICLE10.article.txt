# Students launch think tank, catch national eye
## 
### JENNIE KIM PAMELA SUD 
Following Election Day last November, Stan
ford students campaigning for Sen. John Kerry,
Democratic presidential candidate, were pre
sented with the challenging task of promoting
progressive political activism despite their candi
date's defeat.
In an effort to regroup, sophomore Quinn
Wilhelmi and political science graduate student
Kai Stinchcombe began toying with the idea of
pioneering a think tank to facilitate the sharing of
research between students and academia, the
media and the government.
Three months of exchanging e-mails, making
conference calls and holding caffeine-fueled
meetings at the CoHo led to the founding of the
Roosevelt Instilution, the nation's first student
run think tank, which will make its official debut
to the Stanford community at ( ) p.m. in Tresidder's
Oak Lounge.
Titled "A Rendezvous with Destiny," the
event will introduce the Institution's mission,
showcase several student policy presentations
and include a video message from members of
the Institution's sister branch at Yale University.

A jayy. band will perform and refreshments will
be served.
"Progressive students are already generating
smart, bold ideas in their classes everyday," said
Stinchcombe, president of the think tank. "The
Roosevelt Institution fills a huge, but relatively
simple, need by providing an infrastructure to for
ward those ideas to the public, to influence the de
cision makers."
Stinchcombe served as president of the Stan
ford Democrats in the fall.
Wilhelmi also added that "the Roosevelt Insti
tution is about both influencing the current na
tional debate and about training the next genera
tion for leadership."
Named for three famous American progres
sives — Presidents Franklin Delano and
Theodore R(x>sevelt and First Lady Eleanor
Roosevelt — the institution houses 12 issue-fo
cused research centers, with eight to 20 student
fellows working at each.

dezvous with destiny," he said.
Wilhelmi and Stinchcombe said
they believe that his statement applies
to today's generation as well.
The think tank already boasts 200
student members or "fellows."
The directors of each center within
the institution will report to senior
Mattie Hutton, the center develop

Environment and Energy; Progressive
Religious Perspectives; and Science,
Technology, Bioethics and Space an
nounced their respective launches and
completed their inaugural policy pa
pers last week.
Each policy center hopes to recruit
more student fellows and faculty sup
porters at tonight's event.
Hoover Institution fellows at Stan
ford stressed the importance of quality
work in determining the student think
tank's success.
