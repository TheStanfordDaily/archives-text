# Severed glitches still exist
## Univ. officials say alcohol policy has proved successful 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
University officials claim that
the two-year-old alcohol policy
has decreased the number of hos
pitalizations among underclass
men. Since its implementation, the
policy has been largely accepted
by resident assistants and most
freshmen have coped, but some
have defied the new rules and
faced stiff consequences.
The policy, which came into ef
fect during the last academic year,
states that all-freshman resi
dences cannot serve alcohol at
events in their lounges, hallways
or outdoor patios. But some stu
dents and school officials are wor
ried that the change would lead to
heavy drinking behind doors,
where dangerous activities could
not be monitored by R As. Howev
er, Ralph Castro, an alcohol and
drug educator at Vaden Health
Center, said that hasn't happened.
"1 think it's played out rather
well," he said.
In fact, according to Director of
Residential Education Jane Ca
marillo, early statistics point to a
slight decrease in alcohol-related
hospitalizations among freshmen.
"In fall and winter quarters in
particular, I felt that we were see
ing less extreme problems with
the freshman class," she said in an
e-mail to The Daily. "This year, as
last, I have felt that more of our
calls for emergency room visits
have been for upperclassmen
(mostly sophomores), but I can
not yet confirm that with the data.
But I am convinced that the frosh
transports are down compared to
upperclassmen."
Before the policy went into ef
fect, RAs expressed concern that
they would be forced to police
their residents, breaking the trust
that has existed between dorm
staff and students. But Castro

claims this has not been the case.
"RAs have told me they like
the policy," he said. "From a staff
point of view, [the policy] allows
their students to interact without
the social pressures of alcohol."
Senior Laurel Anderson, an RA
in the all-frosh dorm Otero, agreed
that the policy has not strained the
student-staff relationship.
"When we are hired, we're
told that our job is not to be po
licemen," she said. "It has always
been [the Otero staff's] policy
from the very beginning that
even though there's no alcohol in
public places, that people should
keep the doors open so we know
what's going on."
Senior Josh Seifert, an RAin
the all-frosh dorm Larkin, agreed
that the policy was helpful.
"Having a policy is nice be
cause it means there's something
written that I can say: 'Here's why
you can't be doing this, it's not my
fault,'" he said.
According to Anderson, the re
moval of alcohol from public
spaces has been made easier by
the fact that freshmen don't know
what dorm life was like before the
new policy.
"The freshmen don't know
any different, so it hasn't been a
problem, because that's just the
way it is and they don't question
it," she said.
Leigh Biddlecomb, a freshman
in Branner, agreed.
"It's hard to foresee what
would happen if they got rid of the
policy," she said, noting that she
did not know what dorm social life
was like in years past.
Most students have coped
with the policy and say there is
still plenty of drinking in all
frosh dorms.
