# First Stanford student exchange program with Iraq
## Iraqi students visit campus 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Five Iraqi university students will arrive on cam
pus late today to participate in a 10-day event spear
headed by the Stanford-Iraq Student Exchange, or
SISE.This student group, formed with the help of fac
ulty sponsor Coit Blacker, director of the Stanford
Institute for International Studies, was created to de
velop what it calls an exchange between Iraqi and
American college attendees.
SISE selected the Iraqi students — three women
and two men — from an initial pool of 100 applicants.
They hail from different regions of Iraq and repre
sent various ethnic and religious backgrounds. Even
their academic interests are diverse; English, political
science and engineering are among the subjects they
plan to pursue.
Organizers of SISE have planned a number of
events on campus for the students, including meet
ings and presentations with other student organiza
tions and faculty in their respective areas of academ
ic interests. Deputy Director of SISE Nikhil Sachdev,
a sophomore, said SISE hopes that these students will
get a taste of American college life and make lasting
connections with both students and professors.
"In an idealistic sense, we hope to build mutual
trust and understanding between Iraqi and American
students," Sachdev said.
The Iraqi students will speak about their personal
experiences during a welcome dinner on Saturday
night hosted by Stanford's Islamic Society. There will
also be an interfaith dialogue next Wednesday on re
ligious pluralism in America, sponsored by the Office
of Religious Life. The discussion will be moderated
by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann. senior associate
dean for religious life.
"I hope that this will be a free exchange where the

Iraqi students can get a sense of how we do religious
pluralism and the variety of religions we have in
America," Karlin-Neumann said. "On the Stanford
side, 1 hope students will see how religion is experi
enced in Iraq."
All members of the Stanford community will have
the opportunity to interact with the Iraqi students
and SISE leaders at the "Forum on Improving Iraqi-
American Relations," an event scheduled for next
Monday. The event will include a panel discussion
with Political Science Prof. Larry Diamond and
Hoover Institution Fellow Bill Evers.
They will go sightseeing in San Francisco and
Sacramento, where they will meet with state legisla
tors and visit the secretary of state's office to learn
more about democracy and the electoral process,
Sachdev said.
"We hope to allow the Iraqis to experience stu
dent life and American culture," said senior J.P
Schnapper-Casteras, director of SISE. "We hope to
expose them to democratic institutions, civil society,
community service and interfaith dialogue as they
occur in the United States."
Evers said that the visit will be a unique opportu
nity for both the Iraqi students and their Stanford
peers who organized the trip.
"It will be interesting for someone who's been in a
country that's been closed off for the past 30 years to
get a sense of how other people are living," Evers
said. "At the same time, this has been an amazing
challenge for Stanford students who dealt with not
only University administrators, but also American
federal, state and Iraqi bureaucracies. In general, it
should be a valuable experience for everyone in
volved."
