# Casto hopes for San Antonio position
## Stanford alumnus leads mayoral race

SAN ANTONIO — During
the last hour of voting in the may
oral election, Julian Castro paced
outside the Joe Ward Recreation
Center in his home city council dis
trict 7. He greeted people as
though he knew them, "How are
you?" and asked for their support.
He fiddled with his clothing and
kicked around rocks in the park
ing lot in between greeting voters.
The skies had been gray all day,
and as soon as the polls closed, it
began to drizzle. Nervousness
abounded at Castro's campaign
headquarters and at the polls. And
as if nerves weren't frizzled
enough, Texas state representa
tive Joe Moreno, 40. was killed in a
car accident early in the morning
the day before Election Day Rep
resentative Rafael Anchia,36,was
also hospitalized.
But obstacles were not new to
the Julian Castro for Mayor cam
paign, which seemed to have faced
an uphill battle from the start:
under-funded, under-staffed and
under-estimated.
"A year ago, everybody had
written us off, that I wouldn't be
able to raise enough money," he
said election night, after the offi
cial count placed in him a run-off
election. "Tonight we are well
ahead of them," he said, refer
ring to his 41 percent share of
the vote.
"You are going to win," said
Benita Hernandez to Castro as
she entered the polls, slowly, with
her walker. "We know that he can
do the job. Julian — God bless
him," she said after exiting the
poll.
Kevin Lopez, a campaign con
sultant who has worked on 49
campaigns, drinks a Heineken and
smokes a cigar at the crack of
dawn each Election Day, a la

Bobby Kennedy. He crunched
numbers and frowned the night
before the big day.
Ross Rocketto worked 40
hours a week or more for the cam
paign and even sacrificed his
spring break for the effort. Elec
tion Day happened to coincide
with finals week at Trinity Univer
sity in San Antonio and Rocketto
finished two papers early so he
could dedicate time to the cam
paign. He still has a final and a
paper to finish.
"I'm not shaving until Election
Day-it's a superstition," he said
the day before the election.
Hard to miss were the many
friends of Castro's mother Rosie,
who helped in the campaign effort
by making phone calls, cleaning
the office, making sure everyone
was fed and doing all the small
things that oil the wheels of a large
campaign. Anna Riojas and Irma
Mireles have known Castro since
he was in the womb,and were very
politically active decades before
"the boys" were.
And then there are the lawyers.
Half of them worked heavily on
the campaign, several of them are
Castro's friends from Harvard
Law School. TJ Duane and Jay
Hulings took a leave of absence
from their law firms in New York
and Los Angeles, respectively, to
work on the campaign.
"It's not very often your friend
runs for mayor," said Hulings, who
has been in San Antonio since Jan
uary. "He's a smart guy and he has
his heart in the right place."
Jorge Urby helped plan the
parties for the campaign and is on
the verge of graduating from
Texas State University-San Mar
cos, where he is writing a paper
about the Castro campaign for his
Comparative Politics class.
