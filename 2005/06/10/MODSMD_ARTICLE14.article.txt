# Students to create shelter in Guatemala
## 
### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A team of Stanford students is working to cre
ate a center for homeless women and children in
Guatemala.The facility, which will house and pro
vide counseling, medical, educational and com
munal dining services, is part of a larger crisis re
lief project connected with a civil and environ
mental engineering course on campus.
Architect Margaret Jann leads the eight-mem
ber class, "Architecture Studio Practicum on Sus
tainable Development, Equity, Ethics and Com
munity Service." Although offered by the Civil
and Environmental Engineering Department, the
class includes students with backgrounds in urban
design and product design.
For the past two years, the class has been work
ing to complete the Guatemala project, which will
provide two houses for orphaned children who
will live with surrogate mothers.
The idea for the Guatemala project started
when Luis Trujillo, Class of 2003, went to
Guatemala to work with the Center for the
Restoration of the Multitudes. The organization
expressed the need fora community center, and
last year's class adopted the project after visiting
the country.
Ayaz, who is currently enrolled in the class,said
the goal is "not only to design an inexpensive and
efficient shelter for the impoverished, but to in
crease the comfort and quality of life for these vic
tims through distinctively good designs."
Because the class is based on humanitarian
goals, the students spoke to the organization's
leaders to learn more about the community's
wants and needs.
"We want the client to be happy, rather than
imposing architecture on them," Ayaz said. " ITie
rationale behind our work is making something
that is realistic but not just prefabricated housing.
We want to go beyond that."
Some students in the class are also working to

create an ocean-side church in France and housing
units for the regions affected by the tsunamis in
South Asia. Because it is difficult to complete a
project of this scale in a 10-week quarter, the work
is usually carried over and built on by the follow
ing year's class. In fact, Jann said many of the proj
ects can take five to 10 years to complete.
She also stressed that the class is significant for
students' development of architecture skill as well
as cultural awareness and sensitivity.
"I think this class is very important because the
students are working on live projects that they
would not typically get to work on for years until
they have been licensed as architects," Jann said.
"So by getting to work on real projects for real

clients they get hands-on experience, the chance
to work with clients and exposure to other cul
tures and countries with different design methods
and ethos."
Senior Michelle Chang, who has taken the class
for the last two years, said she feels her experience
has been extremely rewarding.
"We are like a think tank; we come up with so
lutions and ideas," Chang said. "This has been one
of my favorite classes at Stanford because you get
to interact with clients and do something you
know will help someone."
