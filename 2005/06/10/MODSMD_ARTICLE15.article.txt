## Water in the Milk Bottle Who is my Jesus? 
### 
I've spent a lot of time puzzling over the
core question of youthful angst — what
should I do with my life? 1 have yet to come
up with an answer, but as the end of my Stan
ford career draws near, it seems it might be
useful to formulate at least a tentative one,
and soon.
I've been faced with many difficult ques
tions before, such as "What is the antideriv
ative of f(x) = In sin (x A x A 2)?" Now, if 1 were
to identify just one invaluable thing that I've
gotten out of my Stanford education, it
would be the ability to address these com
plex issues in a calm and efficient manner.
As long as you haven't signed the honor
code, turn and ask a neighbor.

In the past month, I've
been asking all around. I
started with my friends, who
apparently see my unfortu
nate dilemma as an oppor
tunity to point out my char
acter flaws and offer no so
lutions.
"You are commitment
phobic," they say. "Do
whatever you want."

The lack of sympathy is frustrating, but I
have to forgive them. They may be annoy
ingly model students destined for equally
annoying future success, but they. too. ques
tion their life choices with some frequency.
So I decided to move on to the people
who've really got it made — my professors.
The venerable academics, it appears, have
achieved consensus on advice for young
people in doubt: Stay in school as long as
possible. After all, as my adviser assured me,
"It's a scary world out there. Just stay and get
as many degrees as you can."
The academics love academia. I suppose a
sharper person would have figured that one
out and skipped the office hours.
I'm sure by now that academia isn't for
me. It's all about narrowing down that spe
cialization, that one tiny point of elite
knowledge that three other people in the
world understand. If this is your "passion" or
one or more of these three people is your
"soul mate," then well and good, but that
doesn't quite apply to me.
I'm all about breadth over depth — the
comments on my English papers attest to
that. When I point this out to profs, they nod,
but still suggest the doctorate. In essence, my
professors are telling me exactly what they
would do if they were me — they would be
themselves.
I think what I need is a role model. I need
someone I admire, whose life I want to pat
tern mine after. And if I follow closely
enough in the footsteps of my bold predeces
sor, I will find the same grail, reach the same
higher plane. From within the bubble,
though, it's difficult to find someone I ad
mire in a field I might consider.
Fortunately, there's media. The media
brings me the opinions of thousands of
celebrities and public figures without any
need for me to ask. The life of my famous
role model would be well known and there
fore easy to follow through the guide of bi
ography, common pop-cultural trivia and
Google.
Think WWJD bracelets or the boys of
South Park singing "What would Brian Boi
tano do?" Who is my Jesus, my Brian Boi
tano? For Stanford's many tech-savvy entre
preneurs — who is my Bill Gates?
The obvious choice, of course, is Jon
Stewart. Never mind that I am neither Jew
ish nor a man. nor do I have the particular
configuration of facial features that make
his look of bemusement so invitingly comic.
But Jon Stewart is totally the shit, and I to
tally want to be Jon Stewart. I want to be
brilliantly quick-witted. I want every college
student to watch me deliver fake news and
make bawdy jokes about politicians. I want
to have streaming video on Comedy Ce
ntral.com.
But there are obvious impediments to
these worthy goals. Besides the facial fea
tures, I am not particularly quick-witted, nor
do 1 have the energetic TV personality and
the cojones to broadcast bawdy jokes that
might possibly be heard by my family.
In other words, I am not Jon Stewart. My
choice of role model is still restricted by my
own natural tendencies, and the question of
who I want to imitate reduces to the ques
tion with which I began — what do I want to
do with my life? A sharper person might
have figured that one out much earlier, too.
Meanwhile, as long as I've mistakenly
started down this path. I will continue to
work on my fake news bulletin and twist my
neck while pulling at my tie (Why does he do
that?) and eventually, I hope, I'll figure it out
as 1 go.

If you are some smart-ass math major who
wants to give me some smart-ass answer to the
math question above, write me at igliu@stan
forci.edu. I already have a Stanford math de
gree, and I would like you to know, you are
pretty much unemployable. Ha.
