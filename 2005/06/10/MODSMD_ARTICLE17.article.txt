# New motorcycle club revs its engines

Let's be honest, I'm pretty badass.
Though I don't have any tattoos, rocker boyfriends or
mug shots to date, I bend the rules in my own sort of way. I
skip the occasional I-Hum lecture and bike on the sidewalks.
I've even said the word "sex" on national television. So when
the founder of the Stanford Motorcycle Club picked me up
for our interview on the "Cadillac of Motorcycles," I have to
say 1 wasn't blown away at the proposition.
My dreams of joining Hell's Angels with iny hair blowing
wildly in the wind were further thwarted by an oversized hel
met. But in true journalistic fashion. 1 chivalrously put my
rebel-rousing tendencies aside for one ride and realized that,
sports bike or not. 1 was the closest to a Biker Babe that 1 was
ever going to get.
Unfortunately, my biker image trailed far behind that of

my driver's, Chris Pumo, co-term by day and biker by lunch
breaks. Pumo's leather jacket and ripped jeans proved his
slight edge on the coolness factor. Also, while 1 was only trail
ing along for one Sunday afternoon ride. Pumo can be cred
ited as the founder of the Stanford Motorcycle Club.
Pumo started the organization about a month and a half
ago as a way to organize a forum for all of the area's bikers.
Fed up with having to travel to San Jose fora group ride, he
posted flyers near motorcycle parking spaces and on parked
motorcycles around campus. He received a surge of respons
es, and thanks to the resurrection of an old motorcycle Stan
ford e-mail list and word-of-mouth, the club has grown in size
to about 30 people.
Members range from senior Robby Ratan who bought
his first motorcycle from E-Bay.com three months ago, to 51 -
year-old Craig Haggart.aSLAC staff member, who has been
riding motorcycles for more than 35 years.
Pumo bought his first bike, a 1980 Kawasaki, three years
ago.Though he had to push it home from Escondido Village,
he was soon able to get it up and running. Since then, the
Kawasaki has had two successors. Pumo is now working on
putting together a 1970 Harley Davidson, which he bought
last summer disassembled in cardboard boxes — and with
out a frame.
After reading how-to books and talking to mechanics.
Pumo said he has been able to complete roughly 60 percent
of the job and hopes to finish it entirely by this summer.
"It's like a giant Lego set for adults, only a little more com
plicated," Pumo said.
While Pumo's parents initially disapproved of his first
motorcycle purchase, his dad has since come around, though
Pumo says that his mother is still a little more hesitant.
"I don't know if anyone's mom would love them riding a
motorcycle," he said.
That said, however, members hardly go on their share of
joy rides.
Weekly meetings are Fridays at 11:30 a.m. at the Stanford
Driving Range Parking Lot, where the group meets to ride
up to Alice's, on the corner of Skyline and Highway 84. for
lunch. On the weekends, members will sometimes take a
longer ride, such as the one planned fora Half-Moon Bay
mechanic show next Sunday.
In the future, Pumo hopes to plan an overnight for the
group, and he is thinking about try ing to make the club offi
cially Stanford-affiliated in order to increase publicity. How
ever, the latter is not a huge priority for Pumo.
"I'm not so interested in [making it official]," he said. "I'm

more interested in Stanford riders getting together and being
able to go fora ride at a moment's notice."
For club members such as Haggart, biking gives new
meaning to the word passion.
"Riding a motorcycle on a twisty road is sort of a combi
nation of riding a horse and dancing," Haggart said. "There's
a wonderful fluidity about the skill it takes to do it well, and
the machine both responds to your input and moves in a cer
tain way on its own. Even a 'mild' motorcycle has an incred
ible power-to-weight ratio, so the response can be incredibly
exhilarating."
Ratan, who just bought his bike last year, also expressed
his enthusiasm for the sport.
"In my first month I put over I,(XX) miles on the bike just
cruising around the foothills," he said.
In his second month, he was less lucky.
"1 crashed because I hit some gravel while going around
a blind turn," Ratan said. "Luckily it wasn't too bad, and 1
learned an important lesson about rider attitude: Never ride
in a rush."
Ratan's fall is the only one to date for the club
"I guess accidents happen " Pumo said. "Motorcycling is
not badminton."
He noted that group traveling, in addition to being more
fun, is also safer.
"Safety is a really important thing to me." Pumo said. "1
try to make all club rides, safe rides."
Pumo said that the club keeps the group pace to the slow
est or least experienced member. Other club members
agreed this was a good tactic.
"To me, it's not so much about going fast in an absolute
sense, but going fast in a relative sense," Haggart said. "That
is, anyone can go 135 m.p.h. in a straight line on a modern mo
torcycle; the fun — and, in my opinion, the real skill —
comes from going 30 or 40 in a corner where you would nor
mally do 20 or 25."
Ratan agreed that absolute speed is not his favorite as
pect of riding.
"The thing 1 love most about riding is that you are really
part of the landscape — you feel the air temperature and
smell the trees — as opposed to a car, where you are a pas
sive observer through a window," Ratan said.
Ratan pointed out that there was an ever further perk of
the job: "Chicks dig guys with bikes."

es, and thanks to the resurrection of an old motorcycle Stan
ford e-mail list and word-of-mouth, the club has grown in size
to about 30 people.
Members range from senior Robby Ratan who bought
his first motorcycle from E-Bay.com three months ago, to 51 -
year-old Craig Haggart.aSLAC staff member, who has been
riding motorcycles for more than 35 years.
Pumo bought his first bike, a 1980 Kawasaki, three years
ago.Though he had to push it home from Escondido Village,
he was soon able to get it up and running. Since then, the
Kawasaki has had two successors. Pumo is now working on
putting together a 1970 Harley Davidson, which he bought
last summer disassembled in cardboard boxes — and with
out a frame.
After reading how-to books and talking to mechanics.
Pumo said he has been able to complete roughly 60 percent
of the job and hopes to finish it entirely by this summer.
"It's like a giant Lego set for adults, only a little more com
plicated," Pumo said.
While Pumo's parents initially disapproved of his first
motorcycle purchase, his dad has since come around, though
Pumo says that his mother is still a little more hesitant.
"I don't know if anyone's mom would love them riding a
motorcycle," he said.
That said, however, members hardly go on their share of
joy rides.
Weekly meetings are Fridays at 11:30 a.m. at the Stanford
Driving Range Parking Lot, where the group meets to ride
up to Alice's, on the corner of Skyline and Highway 84. for
lunch. On the weekends, members will sometimes take a
longer ride, such as the one planned fora Half-Moon Bay
mechanic show next Sunday.
In the future, Pumo hopes to plan an overnight for the
group, and he is thinking about try ing to make the club offi
cially Stanford-affiliated in order to increase publicity. How
ever, the latter is not a huge priority for Pumo.
"I'm not so interested in [making it official]," he said. "I'm

more interested in Stanford riders getting together and being
able to go fora ride at a moment's notice."
For club members such as Haggart, biking gives new
meaning to the word passion.
"Riding a motorcycle on a twisty road is sort of a combi
nation of riding a horse and dancing," Haggart said. "There's
a wonderful fluidity about the skill it takes to do it well, and
the machine both responds to your input and moves in a cer
tain way on its own. Even a 'mild' motorcycle has an incred
ible power-to-weight ratio, so the response can be incredibly
exhilarating."
Ratan, who just bought his bike last year, also expressed
his enthusiasm for the sport.
"In my first month I put over I,(XX) miles on the bike just
cruising around the foothills," he said.
In his second month, he was less lucky.
"1 crashed because I hit some gravel while going around
a blind turn," Ratan said. "Luckily it wasn't too bad, and 1
learned an important lesson about rider attitude: Never ride
in a rush."
Ratan's fall is the only one to date for the club
"I guess accidents happen " Pumo said. "Motorcycling is
not badminton."
He noted that group traveling, in addition to being more
fun, is also safer.
"Safety is a really important thing to me." Pumo said. "1
try to make all club rides, safe rides."
Pumo said that the club keeps the group pace to the slow
est or least experienced member. Other club members
agreed this was a good tactic.
"To me, it's not so much about going fast in an absolute
sense, but going fast in a relative sense," Haggart said. "That
is, anyone can go 135 m.p.h. in a straight line on a modern mo
torcycle; the fun — and, in my opinion, the real skill —
comes from going 30 or 40 in a corner where you would nor
mally do 20 or 25."
Ratan agreed that absolute speed is not his favorite as
pect of riding.
"The thing 1 love most about riding is that you are really
part of the landscape — you feel the air temperature and
smell the trees — as opposed to a car, where you are a pas
sive observer through a window," Ratan said.
Ratan pointed out that there was an ever further perk of
the job: "Chicks dig guys with bikes."
