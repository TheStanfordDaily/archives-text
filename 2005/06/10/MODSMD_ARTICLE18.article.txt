## Innovative Musings How it all changed 
### 
At dinner tonight, a high school sen
ior I was dining with was aghast at the
idea of someone going to Europe on her
own. "It would he like driving without a
cell phone," she said to me, between
bitesofa BL'I sandwich."Sodangerous"
Having both gone to Europe on my
own and driven for years without a cell
phone. I felt lueky to have lived this long.
And I didn't have the heart to tell her
that I got my first ticket (for an illegal
left turn) driving out of the cell phone
shop parking lot.
Yes — I was playing with the buttons.
Only one person I knew had a cell
phone in high school. His parents used it
to track him down at night, thereby in
terrupting our breakfasts at Denny's
and our various exploits with the school
keys. I "hey made up for it by taking us
out to sushi.
Now 1 carry my cell phone '-very
where (though I've resisted PDAs and
iPnds, both of which are bound to even
tually become part of our cell phones
anyway) When I graduate from the
Kennedy School of Government in two
weeks, I'll be traveling with it to Boston
on a flight I booked at the American Air
lines Web site,aa.com,staying with it at a
hotel I booked on Priceline.com and will
be carrying a laptop with a Verizon wire
less card.
Nowadays, this sounds passe. But
then I look back again and remember
that I didn't even have an e mail address
until I got to college.
The first day of Orientation. I shot off
a message to a friend at IJC San Diego.
We had been told that starting college
meant losing touch with almost every
one in your past life. That wouldn't hap
pen to us, my friends and I figured: This
new e-mail thing would keep us connect
ed.
It mostly did. I think we remained
more closely-knit than if we had gone
our separate ways just a couple years
earlier. I can only imagine how much
more true that might have been if we'd
had live-Journals, free nights and week
ends for the cell phone and the' I"he face
book.com.
I only discovered the World Wide
Web at the start ol my sophomore year.
It was a barren place. No Napster, just a
few pioneering class Web sites. Ama
zon.com was two months old — and had
been around several weeks longer than
Internet Explorer. The term "cable
modem" made us think of modems with
cables sticking out of them, and DSL
sounded like some kind of foreign ship
ping company. Hotmail was what hap
pened when you sent a letter to Arizona.
But it wasn't just the Internet that
was different then. ('alilornians had only
recently discovered the appeal of blend
ing fruits, yogurt and ice to make
smoothies (to the delight of a fledgling
company called Juice Club.) The SAT
still had analogies. Bookstores were
places where people bought books and
an animated movie signified something
hand drawn — not Shrek but Beauty
and the Beast. Airlines served meals and
your parents could walk you to your de
parture gate. Buffy hadn't slain any vam
pires yet — at least not on TV.
Back then, there were no TVs in
Tresidder, let alone flat screens. You had
to file paper forms to get pretty much
anything done, from transcript requests
to selecting your classes.The parking lot
didn't take credit cards. And people who
regularly snackcd on FroYo from the
now defunct CoPo were busy founding
companies with equally Stanford-esque
names — like Yahoo!.
By now I probably sound primeval,
but I graduated from Stanford not that
long ago —in 2(M)2 (true, I look two
years off along the way). Some of you
were around then; you probably remem
ber how poorly cell phones worked on
campus even at the start of the 21st cen
tury. None of this was very long ago.
Still, there are times when I look back
at my original Stanford days (because
there are bound to be more) and miss
that palpable sense of opportunity in the
air, that feeling that tomorrow hadn't
been shaped yet — and that we would
be the ones to shape it. Every few weeks
it seemed another friend had left Stan
ford to join a start up or had come back
post-IPO to recruit the rest of us.
But then I remember that in one
sense or another, Stanford's probably al
ways been that way — and still is. Our
"wind of freedom" continues to blow to
wards the future (though not always to
ward Washington) and from our place
on the Farm (or the Arrillaga Alumni
Center) we get to help make the weath
er.

This fall, Daniel Berdichevsky will be
traveling overland (on his own, hut with a
cell phone) from Malaysia to Madrid.
