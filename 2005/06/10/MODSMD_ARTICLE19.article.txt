# Apple lets loose new OSX Tiger
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Were it not for the florescent lights inside
and the iMacs in the window display, one
could have mistaken the Apple store in down
town Palo Alto fora dance club on Friday
night. A long line of people trailed out the
door — and around the corner of the block
as two large men dressed in black regulated
entry into the store.
What was the reason for the buzz? The
global release of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, the
newest operating system for Apple comput
ers. To prepare for the release, 105 Apple
stores around the world closed at 5 p.m. (local
times) and reopened at 6 p.m. for the pre
miere. Store staff gave away scratchcards to
customers as they walked in. giving them a
chance to win a new Powerßook G4 comput
er, an iPod or iTUnes songs.
Many loyal Mac users awaited the release
of Apple?s latest operating system.
"It's my tradition to go to the release of
every |Mac OS X| upgrade," explained Palo
Alto resident Tom French. "It's a lot of fun."
Junior Brad Moore, a resident computer
consultant at Cardenal, attended the release
with a few residents from his dorm. He said he
came away from the presentation impressed.
"I think it's a dramatic leap forward." said
Moore."This upgrade puts Mac OS X square
ly forward in front of Microsoft's Windows
operating system."
Although the release enticed hardcore
Mac fans to view the newest upgrade, many
Bay Area residents — including Stanford stu
dents — stopped by the Mac store out of cu
riosity. Senior Michelle Lee, a symbolic sys
tems major, was out to dinner with some

friends when she saw the line.
"I'd never been to an OS X launch, and I'd
always wanted to do that." Lee said. "I had
read the review and was interested in check
ing out the product."
The newest upgrade of the Mac operating
system comes IS months after the last release,
dubbed Panther. Tiger, which costs $124. of
fers 2(H) new innovations. The most notable
features that distinguish Tiger from Panther
are Spotlight, a tool that enables users to
search for files more efficiently, and Dash
board. which runs mini-programs on users'
screens.
"Spotlight is a search mechanism for your
entire system, kind of like Google for your
desktop, but it's literally built right into the
operating system, so whenever your creating
or moving around files, they are automatical
ly indexed on the spot." said junior Tristan
Harris, who worked with Apple on develop
ing Dashboard this summer.
For people who have a hard time organiz
ing files on their computer. Spotlight will
prove to be useful. Harris said.
"1 think Spotlight is what people are going
to be really happy about in the end. as far as
affecting the 'digital lives? of students on
campus," he said. "Apple is trying to get peo
ple away from having to deal with the pletho
ra of files that exist on our system."
Dashboard, "a pretty piece of eye candy,"
as described by Harris, brings up a variety of
useful programs nicknamed "widgets" to the
desktop with the push of the Fl2 key. These
applications include a currency converter,
weather forecast tool, flight tracker and dic
tionary. These all update when connected to
the Internet, and users can download new
Dashboard programs from the Mac Web site

and other sites.
"Instead of forcing people to go through
all this clumsy software, banner ads and poor
ly made Weh sites, ' Harris explained. Dash
board can simplify a computer user's life by
putting it all at one's fingertips.
On Friday, some students came only tosee
the product — not to buy.
"The Apple store doesn't offer the educa
tional discount that the [Stanford] Bookstore
does." explained senior Alex Kehlenbeck. a
math major.
While the newest release has generated a
good amount of hype, some Mac users said
they are a little peeved at having to upgrade
on a yearly basis.
"Do 1 really want to pay $I2M every year
for the next version til Mac OS X?," wrote
John Siracusa in a N0v.2003 article in the soft
ware review Web site Ars Technica. "Worse,
do I really want to deal with the inevitable up
grade hassles and 10.x.0 release bugs every
single year? Is it worth it.or is a major OS up
grade every year simply too much, too
often?"
So is this new upui ade enough for PC users

to switch from a PC to a Mac?
The debate is still up in the air.
Moore, who switched to Macs around the
time of the first release of Mac OS X.said he
enjoys working with Macs.
When asked what he likes about Macs.
Moore said, "The attention to detail, the user
interface, the incredible new search capabili
ties— and that everything just works."
Senior Kevin Christopher, an RCC at
Alondra. still owns a PC "because they are
generally cheaper," but agrees with Moore
that Macs are less prone to problems.
But Christopher said he prefers PCs be
cause they are easier to fix.
"If something goes wrong with a PC. you
can take it apart." he said. "It's like being able
to open up a car and fix the different compo
nents. Macs are designed not to be taken
apart: they have higher quality engineering
because they're supposed to fail less. So it's a
trade-off."
