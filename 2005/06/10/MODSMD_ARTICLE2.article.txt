## Trustees vote to divest Investments pulled from four companies 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
The University Board of Trustees
voted unanimously Tuesday to di
vest from any directly-held invest
ments in petroleum companies
PetroChina, Sinopec. Tatneft and
ABB, Ltd., whose operations sup
port the Sudanese government. The
Khartoum regime has been con
demned worldwide for genocidal
acts in the region of Darfur.
The decision, announced
Wednesday, was made based on the
recommendation of the Board's
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility, or SC'IK. The task of
divestment will now be passed to the
Stanford Management Company,
which will also send letters to the
University's investment managers,
urging them to divest from the four
companies.
Burton McMurtry, chair of the
Board of Trustees, said he expects
these letters to be sent out within the
next 10 days. I le stressed the rarity of
the decision, adding that stringent
standards must be met before divest
ment is considered. Hie situation in

Darfur met these standards.
"This was an odd circumstance,
but it shows that we have a process
that works," McMurtry said. "Over
time we'll likely get more requests
for divestiture than we can approve,
but it will be done on a case-by-case
basis. We need to keep the bar high."
According to the Stanford Uni
versity Statement on Investment
Responsibility, the trustees can take
action if they judge that a company's
policies have led to "substantial so
cial injury."
"Divestment is an act that should
be made rarely and carefully," Uni
versity President John Hennessy
told the Stanford News Service. "In
this case, it was clear that the geno
cide occurring in Darfur. which ap
pears to be at least partly enabled by
these four companies, is in direct op
position to Stanford University prin
ciples."
The issue came to the attention of
the Board when SCIR received a
recommendation for divestment
from the University's Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility,
or API R, a group of faculty, staff and
students that examines issues relat
ed to Stanford's investment portfo
lio.
The recommendation was made
after the panel was approached by
the campus group Students Taking

Action Now: Darfur, or STAND,
which presented research on both
the situation in Darfur and the com
panies in question. The panel voted
in favor of divestment on May 24.
"I'm pleased with the students'
role in this," said APIR member
Debra Meyerson, an associate pro
fessor of education. "I am impressed
and 1 am proud of the students who
started the process that led to the
trustee vote. They acted carefully
and heroically."
APIR Chair George Parker, a
professor at the Graduate School of
Business, agreed with McMurtry
that the decision is exceptional.
"This is exceedingly rare," he
said. "We would not anticipate an
other decision like this fora long
time. It is not done casually, easily or
quickly."
Junior Ben Elberger, who helped
lead the STAND effort, said that he
was thrilled with the outcome of the
Board's vote, adding that the student
group feared the decision would be
delayed until the fall.
It took Stanford students years
to win divestment from companies
that supported apartheid in South
Africa; we're thrilled that this cam
paign only took three months," he
said. "But, really, this was only
