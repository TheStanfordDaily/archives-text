# Bay Area serves as startup breeding ground
## 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If necessity is the mother of invention, then
Stanford students are masters at identifying
needs. The Bay Area is home to many innova
tive new companies founded by Stanford stu
dents and graduates â€” and they're not just
technical start-ups but also social entrepre
neurships.
One such student is senior Jeannette
Mellinger, who has been involved in Ouest
Bridge, a Palo Alto-based social venture,since
its founding in August 2(K)3. Mellinger, a
human biology major, first worked for Ouest
Bridge's parent program, the Ouest Scholars
Program, an academic summer enrichment
program for underprivileged high school stu
dents held at Stanford. But the Quest pro
gram is restricted to 20 students per session, so
when Ouest organizers began looking for
ways to broaden their impact, Mellinger got
involved in exploring and analyzing opportu
nities.
"We have a lot of donors who say about the
programs, 4 Let's make more,' " she explained.
"If the whole point is to help the kids,expand
ing makes sense.but it's hard to scale up."
That's where Ouest Bridge came in. It uses
the pool of highly-qualified applicants to
Ouest to make matches between students and
universities seeking to attract precisely the
kinds of low income and minority students
applying to Ouest
"ITiese are the kids that colleges want, but
they do a really bad job of recruiting them,"
Mellinger said. "One thing we can offer the
colleges is that we have information that they
do not. We have a huge knowledge base on
how to attract these kids."
In a process that stretches from June to
December, Ouest Bridge screens applicants
and recommends particularly strong candi
dates to participating colleges, such as Duke.
Cornell. Rice and Amherst. The organization
supports students by helping them explore
colleges and revise essays. Participating col
leges usually select two to five students to
whom they offer binding admission and full
tuition scholarships. Schools pay to be mem
bers of Ouest Bridge's programs and pay addi
tional fees for each student that they accept.
"It's still so much cheaper than they would
have paid to find these students," Mellinger
said."Schools come on readily.The only limit
ing factor is how much they can offer for stu
dent scholarships."
Mellinger devotes a significant amount of
time to Ouest Bridge, but she balances her in
volvement with her studies by obtaining aca
demic credit for her work.
"The cool thing about this is that academ
ics is not all that's going on in your life,"
Mellinger said. "By allowing it to be part of
my academic life. I've found it is rewarding to
learn as you go."

Mellinger is not alone in seeking to make a
difference in the world through her work.
Corwin Hardham. a doctoral candidate in
mechanical engineering, first met the four
Massachusetts Institute of Technology gradu
ates who started Squid Labs thanks to a
shared love for kite-sailing.The original Squid
Labs partners were teaching a class on kite
building that Hardham attended. The work
shop was right in line with the philosophy of
Squid Labs, which opened in Emeryville last
summer, since many of its projects focus on
enabling people to create their own things.
"One of the main goals is to teach people
how to effectively build their own stuff,"
Hardham said. "That's pretty huge. That's one
of the reasons why I joined. Throughout my
life I've built a lot of my own stuff for kite and
wind-sailing."
One of the early projects by the founders
of Squid Labs was the design and creation of
their own kites for kite-sailing. Since commer
cially produced kites are very expensive, the

team dissected them and built them them
selves. Then they posted directions online in a
project that Hardham describes as "open
source kiting." The company is still working
on kites.designingones that allow them to vir
tually fly themselves and stay steady in the
face of wind.
Squid Labs has also developed a series of
one-page cartoons, called "Howtoons," that
teach kids how to build their own toys,such as
an air marshmallow shooter constructed from
plastic pipes. I"he idea is that kills should be
able to create things on their own, even im
provising on the books' designs.
"With a little bit supervision and a lew
bucks, you can go to the hardware store and
have several days of entertainment," Hard
ham said.
The company is in the process of getting
these cartoons syndicated in newspapers
worldwide. In the meantime, they are devel
oping an online program that allows adults to
exchange how-to's on designing and creating

their own items.
Squid Labs is also venturing into the
healthcare field with a new corrective-vision
eyeglass technology that would allow the indi
vidual production of glasses. Injectable molds
would allow small-scale producers in devel
oping nations to create prescription glasses
without the large amount of equipment nor
mally needed.
" I"he idea is to be able to bring prescrip
tion eyeglasses to one billion people who
need them but don't have any way of getting
them," Hardham said. "The whole group is
very green, as far as we'd like work on green
technologies or things that might bring about
social good, if not environmental good."
While Squid Labs addresses issues beyond
Stanford, other start-ups work closer with is
sues faced by those still living on campus. One
such company is Addage, a Web portal start
up founded by Mikey Lee. a senior in commu
nications.
Addage, which will launch a site called
Stanford Central within the next month,
serves small communities by tying together
listings, event calendars and other communi
cations tools in targeted Web sites. The idea
arose from addressing the needs of college
students, who are often bombarded with in
formation from a variety of mediums.
"The idea of Addage was spurred by a
need for reliable communication within a
very decentralized campus with students who
have short-attention spans, high-demands
and too many things to keep track of." Lee
said.
Lee co-founded the company with Ryan
Brumberg, a first-year law student at Stan
ford. and is also working with a technology
team based in Seattle. Both of the co-founders
have a lot of contacts among Stanford alumni,
trustees, professors and current students,all of
whom have provided input on planning and
direction for the company.
ITiough the founding idea of Addage is
clearly derived from his experiences at Stan
ford. Lee said that much of the business direc
tion and technical design process had also
been formed through his personal experi
ences.
"While I don't have as much of a technical
background, a lot of the social engineering
skills I have are based on my coursework and
classes I've audited." Lee said.
In creating his start-up. Lee shares a line of
thinking with both Mellinger and Hardham.
starting with a desire to improve social condi
tions.
"Since 1 have a great passion for improving
student life and since 1 have a drive to get
things done. I came up with what I figured was
the perfect solution." Lee said.
