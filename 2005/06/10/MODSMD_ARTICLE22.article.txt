## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
"Winning is the only thing that
counts," said former Chief Execu
tive Officer and Chairman of Gen
eral Electric Jack Welch last night.
Then he paused, and fora moment,
a packed Memorial Auditorium sat
silent, enthralled by arguably the
most celebrated American business
legend of all time.
Only moments before. Welch
had the entire auditorium booming
with laughter and applause as he re
ferred to certain Microsoft employ
ees as a "pot of duds."
Both serious and lively, Welch
was characteristically direct and
passionate, analyzing contemporary
business issues, answering ques
tions, discussing his new book."Win
ning." and sharing the management
strategies that turned GE from an
uncoordinated mammoth into an
agile industry leader.
Welch discussed the importance
and effectiveness of "people build
ing" by placing emphasis on human
resources, using a system for identi
fying and rewarding exemplary per
formers and leading by example.
" Ihe day you become a leader,
managing five, 10.15 people,your fu
ture becomes tied to them," Welch
said, touching on the very core of his
management doctrine — the quali
ty of the members determines the
quality of the team.

"What so many businesses don't
recognize is that the chief human re
sources officer is at least equal if not
more important than the chief fi
nancial officer,"he said. "If you're
coaching a baseball or football
team, would you want a bunch of ac
countants hanging around or people
who know how to talk to your play
ers?"
To stimulate performance,
managers should assess their em
ployees' work and constantly
keep in touch with the employees
to encourage improvement,
Welch added.
"You got grades back in school,
so why not now?" he asked. "Not
having differentiation is the cruelest
thing in a company. People need to
know where they stand."
Welch explained his three-tiered
20-70-10 system. "Stars," the top 20
percent performers, are rewarded
with hefty financial bonuses and
recognition, while "Lemons", the
bottom 10 percent, are replaced.The
middle 70 percent, he said, need to
be told what to do to get into the top
20 percent.
"Mission and values — define
them clearly," Welch said.
Welch demonstrated that the
scope of his business doctrine ex
tends from the boardroom to the
cubicle.
