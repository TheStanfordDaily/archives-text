## Stellar Suggestions Everything you always wanted to know about sex but can’t ask 
### 
Like many renowned institutions of
higher learning, Stanford is often accused
of being overly theoretical and intellectual
ly elitist in its course offerings. When it
conies to sex education, however, the Uni
versity is not academic enough.
Stanford has not offered an introducto
ry human sexuality course since the days of
Humßio 10, better known as Hum Sex.
Started by Dr. Herant Katchadourian in
1971, the course has since then become an
academic legend akin to Dr. William De
ment's Sleep and Dreams.

Known for its superb
teaching, casual tone and
colorful PowerPoint
slides of STD symptoms,
Hum Sex fully embraced
the "facts not judgment"
philosophy of sex educa
tion.
It covered a variety of
topics ranging from the
details of reproductive

biology to the social meaning of gender,
sexual identity and behavior. Most impor
tantly, Hum Sex empowered students with
a solid base of knowledge to make their
own choices about sex.
After Katchadourian's retirement,
Hum Sex continued for one more year and
was taught by the visiting British neu
roanatomist Simon LeVay. Unfortunately,
2003 marked the 32nd and final year of
Hum Sex at Stanford.
We desperately need Hum Sex back.
Despite the pervasive "Stanford students
are 100 dorky to care about sex" stereo
type, 1 dare you to find one student on this
campus who doesn't have an ounce of in
terest in the subject. Sex is too fundamen
tal to our nature to be ignored.
"Sexuality is an intrinsically biological
phenomenon that we all have to deal with,"
said senior Monica Sircar, a former teach
ing assistant for Hum Sex. "We also have to
deal with its social, cultural and political
ramifications. There is enough of an incen
tive for everyone to be taking Hum Sex."
The Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter is a great resource for peer counseling
and free condoms, but 1 wouldn't go there
to discuss the findings of the Kinsey report
or the neurobiology of multiple orgasms.
Other sex-related courses such as
Humßio's "Sexuality in Adolescence" or
Sociology's "Sex and Love in Modern Soci
ety" emphasize narrower aspects of sexual
ity and are not meant to be an introduction
to the field.
The sociology class concentrates strictly
on the social aspects of sexuality, such as in
terpersonal relationships, but leaves out
the biological foundations of sex. And al
though the Humßio class does address sex
ual physiology, its focus on a particular age
group imposes certain limitations to stu
dents' perspectives.
The gap in the Stanford curriculum is
hardly due to diminishing student demand.
During the post-HumSex years, enroll
ment in the student-taught SHPRC class
has skyrocketed, reflecting students' keen
interest.
After all, there is a reason why this year
the I-HUM program deviated from its tra
ditional Socrates-Plato-Aristotle approach
fora course titled "Sex: Its Pleasures and
Cultures."
The more likely reason for the absence
of an introductory human sexuality class is
that no one at Stanford seems to be willing
or able to teach it. Katchadourian and
LeVay may have left big shoes to fill, but I
doubt that a university as prestigious as
Stanford would find it impossible to attract
another top-notch sexuality expert.
Almost every secular college in the
country offers survey courses on human
sexuality — but not Stanford.This obvious
academic void hurts both students' college
experience and the academic reputation of
our school.
Students will only benefit if we bring
one of Stanford's most interesting and
valuable classes back to life. With an inter
disciplinary effort on behalf of the Univer
sity, Hum Sex could be resurrected.
And with the "fulfills GER 4C" label at
the bottom of the syllabus, I wouldn't be
surprised to see students camping out in
the Main Quad to secure a spot in "Human
Sexuality 2: The Birds and the Bees Strike
Back."
