Imagine a world without the technology of
corrective lenses or surgery for people with vi
sion problems. It's a thought that many of the
135 million American adults who wear pre
scription lenses, a number compiled by the eye
care advocacy group Vision Council of Ameri
ca, don't want to contemplate.
"It would affect me socially, academically
and mentally," said senior Julie Park. "Every
thing's blurry without my contacts, and if I did
n't have glasses 1 wouldn't be able to drive, I
couldn't go to large lectures and I probably
wouldn't even be able to say hi to my friends."
Today, a person with vision problems has a
range of corrective options — from glasses to
contact lenses to refractive surgery — but the
technology of restoring correct vision contin
ues to evolve.
One of the newest advancements in the
field of eye care is Corneal Refractive Therapy
(CRT) for nearsighted people. This process,
approved by the FDA in 2002, requires users to
wear special "retainer" lenses overnight that
flattens the cornea.
When users take out the lenses in the morn
ing, they may be able to see just as well without
any lenses as they would otherwise see with
normal contacts or glasses.
Although CRT does enhance vision in the
same way as regular contact lenses, it is not a
remedy and users must continually wear the
retainer lenses on a nightly basis.
According to Dr. Steven Binder, an op
tometrist at the Stanford Eye Center, though
CRT lenses can cost a person from $1,500 to
$2,000 for both eyes for the initial fitting, CRT
provides the benefits of unhampered vision
without the need for surgery.
"It's not a permanent fix, but it's an alterna
tive for those who are queasy about surgery or
for those who, for whatever reason, can't have
or don't qualify for surgery," he said.
Another substitute for refractive surgery is
the "continuous wear" contact lenses, which
were approved by the FDA in 2001 and can be
worn for up to 30 days without removal.
The new line of extended wear lenses is
made out of a material that is more oxygen
permeable than the material of their predeces
sors, which greatly reduces the risk of infec
tions. Due to potential health complications,
the FDA has become more cautious in recent
years about certifying contacts for long-term
wear, according to Binder.
"The first generation of disposable contact
lenses was originally approved for 30-day use,
but then there were complaints about infec
tions and so [the FDA] scaled down use to
seven days," he said. "Now there are two
brands on the market that have been approved
for 30-day use."
Despite the recent developments that have
made the experience of wearing contact lenses
more comfortable than in the past, contacts are
not for everyone.
"Some of the potential side effects are red

ness, allergies and dry eyes," Binder said.
"They're not very good in places where the hu
midity is low, such as in the desert or on an air
plane, and you can also get dust and debris
caught under the lens."
Binder said that infections and many other
contact-related problems could be prevented
by good lens care — cleaning and disposing of
lenses at the proper time is important to main
taining healthy eyes.
Those who are tired of dealing with the
daily hassle of contact lenses and glasses can
consider the option of undergoing refractive
surgery,commonly known as laser eye surgery.
Refractive surgery uses a variety of
processes and technologies, but all procedures
use a laser beam to permanently shape the
corneal tissue.
The latest method involves a surgeon or
machine making an incision in the eye to cre
ate a "flap," which is then pulled back so that
the laser can penetrate the cornea. Laser eye
surgery is innovative in that the entire surgical
procedure usually only takes about ten min
utes.
This method in laser eye surgery is called
"wavefront-LASI K," also known as custom
LASIK. Custom LASIK uses an advanced

technology that allows the laser to form a cus
tomized. 3-D image of each individual eye. Be
fore wavefront LASIK technology was devel
oped. refractive surgery made similar correc
tions to all eyes without taking into detailed ac
count the unique aberrations in individual eyes.
According to Dr. Edward Manche, the di
rector of Cornea and Refractive Surgery at the
Stanford Eye Laser Center and an associate
professor of Ophthalmology at the School of
Medicine, when done by a capable expert, re
fractive surgery has a high success rate. Still,he
said, it is difficult to predict the specific out
come of each surgery.
"The problem is that the eye is living tissue,
not like glass or plastic," Manche said."There's
biological variability in response to what the
laser does."
Manche also said that 9() percent of people
who undergo surgery see as well as they could
with contacts or glasses, while the other 10 per
cent demonstrate improved vision, but not to
the lull extent of wearing glasses or contacts.
Still, there are those for whom the hazards
of surgery rule out laser correction as an op
tion for their eyes.
" Ihere seems to be too much that could go
wrong, and I'd rather have decent eyesight

with contacts than take the chance that some
thing could go terribly wrong," said junior
Sarah IYuehe.
Manche said that refractive surgery does
have associated risks, which are both common
to all surgical procedures and specific to eye
surgery.
"Sometimes there are more serious flap
complications, which can be manageable and
correctable." he said."But sometimes there is a
significant degradation of vision or impair
ment of vision that could be permanent."
Even for those who are willing to have re
fractive surgery, and who are ready to pay
$5,000 to $5,500 for the procedure, not just any
one should undergo refractive surgery.
Before receiving the surgery, prospective
patients are screened for possible complicat
ing factors such as extreme nearsightedness or
astigmatism, a condition in which either the
cornea or the lens is curved irregularly. In addi
tion, a person should wait until his or her eye
sight has reached the point where it will not get
much worse, according to Manche.
"You would like to demonstrate refractive
stability," Manche said. "What we like to see is
a year or two of minimal or no change [in eye
sight] but there are some lasers that are ap
proved to treat patients that are 18 years and
older. Most lasers are approved to treat people
who are 21 years or older."
Sophomore Vinay Mascarenhas said he is
waiting for the day that he will qualify for re
fractive surgery.
"1 would totally get it,"he said. "The second
I turn 21 I'm not buying alcohol, I'm getting
laser eye surgery."
Because refractive surgery is such a new
technique, there is as of yet no concrete evi
dence about its long-term efficacy or stability.
"Refractive surgery is only 12 or 15 years
old," Mache said. "Recent research has shown
that it seems to be quite stable over a 12 year
period, which leads us to assume that it will be
stable over time. But the proof is in the pud
ding, as they say."
Finally, for those who would rather eschew
the new technologies that function so directly
with the actual eye, there is always the option
of good old-fashioned glasses.
"I'm too lazy to put in contacts," said soph
omore Cassie Slimmer, who wears only glasses
for help in seeing. "There's no way I'm waking
up even five minutes earlier in the morningjust
to put in contacts."
And glasses are probably also the safest op
tion for the visually-impaired.
"There is a misconception that if you wear
glasses for too long, you'll come to depend on
them." Binder said. "But generally, glasses
don't cause any harm."
Binder said he recommends that those who
want to avoid any physical damage protect
their eyes from the ultraviolet rays of the sun
and eat foods rich in antioxidants, such as car
rots and spinach.
