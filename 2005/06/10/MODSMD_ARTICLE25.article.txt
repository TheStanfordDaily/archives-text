Like eating vegetables, exercising and
brushing one's teeth, we all know that getting
enough sleep is essential. But many people
don't get enough sleep — and not because
they're too busy to hit the sack — because
they literally can't.
Sleep disorders, ranging from Restless
Leg Syndrome, or RLS, to sleep apnea, can
make it difficult for some to get their requi
site eight or so hours of sleep. But new re
search suggests that many disorders can be
treated, or at least managed.
RLS is characterized exactly by its name
— a disease that causes an uncontrollable
urge to move or twitch one's legs. RLS suffer
ers have trouble sitting on airplanes, going to
movies and even sleeping. A new study by re
searchers at Stanford's School of Medicine
shows that treatment of RLS may be easier
than previously thought,
Co-investigator of the study and medical
student Scott Leibowitz said that about 10 to
15 percent of the population nationwide suf
fers from RLS and about half of this group in
herits the disorder. RLS can also be a side ef
fect of pregnancy and diseases such as
Parkinson's or even iron deficiency.
According to Leibowitz, RLS has "literal
ly driven people crazy," referring to one spe
cific instance of suicide.
A previous study conducted at Stanford in
2003 tested the effectiveness of taking the
drug Ropinirole, a drug that counters the ef
fects of a specific brain chemical —
dopamine — that can hinder sleep when it
acts on one part of the brain. The 2003 study
looked at whether taking the drug on a regu
lar basis could treat RLS. The new research,
which is underway, tests whether Ropinirole
proves as effective when used on an as-need
ed-basis.
The 12-week-long study is observing men
and women between the ages of 18 and 70
who experience RLS intermittently, between
two to four times a week. Participants will
come in four times a week to report on the
status of their RLS and how it impacts their
lives and moods.
Local study participant Debby Rice de
cided to participate in the research experi
ment after years dealing with the "uncontrol
lable urge" to move her legs, which she expe
riences as a result of her RLS.
"It is almost as though I try to rein my legs
in. but after a period of time, the urge is too
strong and I must move them," said Rice.
'"The severity of the urge varies, and some
times when 1 am on a plane 1 have almost

continual movement — like I am shaking
water off my leg. Most often, the sensations
occur at night, just before I go to sleep."
Having experienced RLS since age 13,
Rice has tried to remedy its bothersome
symptoms with treatments ranging from hot
baths to vitamins, but none had proved effec
tive.
"It has been a very strange and difficult
malady to describe, because it doesn't really
hurt, but it is very annoying," Rice said. "1
know that when the symptoms start. I'll have
five to six hours of no sleep"
Rice was thrilled about the possibility of
an RLS study at Stanford.
"I saw the ad in The [San Jose) Mercury
(News) and I was thrilled that someone was
delving into this problem." she said. "The
possibility of getting relief — or even finding
information about this condition caused me
to pick up the phone immediately. My hus
band, who has silently suffered with my kick
ing legs, practically dialed the phone for me."
So far. Rice is happy with the study's
Ropinirole treatment and optimistic about
her condition in the future.

"I am thrilled with the preliminary results
and am already getting great relief,"she said.
Psychology Prof, and sleep disorder spe
cialist Dr. William Dement estimates that
about 15 percent of the general population
suffers from RLS, but that since it affects
mostly older people, only roughly 5 percent
of undergraduates are affected by the condi
tion. According to surveys he has distributed
over the years, a "very large percentage" of
Stanford students suffer from a sleep disor
der, depending on how strictly you define
what constitutes an actual sleep disorder.
Dement said the most prevalent disease
among college students was biological clock
dependent alerting, which causes young peo
ple to fall asleep and wake up at later hours
beginning in the early stages of adolescence.
Additionally, he estimated that roughly 9
percent of undergraduates experience sleep
apnea a condition which causes loss of breath
fora period of several seconds during sleep
and that even more students experience its
milder cousin snoring. According to Dement,
half the male undergraduate student body
snores and one fourth of Ihe female under

graduates also suffers from snoring.
Freshman Koji Gardiner has been suffer
ing from sleep apnea since tenth grade, when
he started to experience it once or twice a
month. Though the disease disappeared for
the most part after one year, it has since reap
peared with his arrival at Stanford.
Though Gardiner finds it hard to define
an exact time frame for his sleep apnea at
tacks, he believes they occur for roughly 30
seconds until he is able to wake up and take a
few deep breaths.
"I'm aware that 1 can't breathe and that if
I could only wake up, I could breathe," Gar
diner said.
Gardiner's attacks were more frequent,
however, than he originally realized. While
he thought that he experienced them only
sporadically, his girlfriend told him that they
occurred at least two or three times in the
space of one night.
The disease is intensified by sleeping on
one's back, according to Webmd.com, an on
line health resource, and after doing research
on his condition, Gardner has since switched
to sleeping on his side. Sleep apnea can often
be a cause of exhaustion and tiredness due to
its prevention of deep sleep during the night.
However, Gardner is unsure whether his
fatigue is a result of his sleep apnea.
"I'm really tired all the time, but I don't
know if it's because of that," Gardiner said.
Dement said that chronic sleep loss is the
most prevalent sleep problem among college
students. While he said that sleep specialists
are unable to determine whether it's a behav
ioral or educational issue, he feels that it is an
issue that is significantly lacking awareness
and attention on campus.
"The last big challenge in the [sleep] field
is to get into the mainstream education," De
ment said.
Clete Kushida, a sleep disorder specialist
at the Stanford Medical Center, agrees that
chronic sleep loss is a significant issue on col
lege campuses.
"Even though college-age students are
very efficient sleepers, meaning that they are
able to sleep over 90 percent of the time that
they are in bed, they are often chronically
sleep deprived and carry a large sleep debt,"
he said.
Dement feels similarly.
"Easily one half of the student body
would benefit greatly from taking sleep as se
riously as [they take healthy] eating and fit
ness," said Dement. "Sleep deprivation can
get you into horrible tragedy."

"It is almost as though I try to rein my legs
in. but after a period of time, the urge is too
strong and I must move them," said Rice.
'"The severity of the urge varies, and some
times when 1 am on a plane 1 have almost

continual movement — like I am shaking
water off my leg. Most often, the sensations
occur at night, just before I go to sleep."
Having experienced RLS since age 13,
Rice has tried to remedy its bothersome
symptoms with treatments ranging from hot
baths to vitamins, but none had proved effec
tive.
"It has been a very strange and difficult
malady to describe, because it doesn't really
hurt, but it is very annoying," Rice said. "1
know that when the symptoms start. I'll have
five to six hours of no sleep"
Rice was thrilled about the possibility of
an RLS study at Stanford.
"I saw the ad in The [San Jose) Mercury
(News) and I was thrilled that someone was
delving into this problem." she said. "The
possibility of getting relief — or even finding
information about this condition caused me
to pick up the phone immediately. My hus
band, who has silently suffered with my kick
ing legs, practically dialed the phone for me."
So far. Rice is happy with the study's
Ropinirole treatment and optimistic about
her condition in the future.

"I am thrilled with the preliminary results
and am already getting great relief,"she said.
Psychology Prof, and sleep disorder spe
cialist Dr. William Dement estimates that
about 15 percent of the general population
suffers from RLS, but that since it affects
mostly older people, only roughly 5 percent
of undergraduates are affected by the condi
tion. According to surveys he has distributed
over the years, a "very large percentage" of
Stanford students suffer from a sleep disor
der, depending on how strictly you define
what constitutes an actual sleep disorder.
Dement said the most prevalent disease
among college students was biological clock
dependent alerting, which causes young peo
ple to fall asleep and wake up at later hours
beginning in the early stages of adolescence.
Additionally, he estimated that roughly 9
percent of undergraduates experience sleep
apnea a condition which causes loss of breath
fora period of several seconds during sleep
and that even more students experience its
milder cousin snoring. According to Dement,
half the male undergraduate student body
snores and one fourth of Ihe female under

graduates also suffers from snoring.
Freshman Koji Gardiner has been suffer
ing from sleep apnea since tenth grade, when
he started to experience it once or twice a
month. Though the disease disappeared for
the most part after one year, it has since reap
peared with his arrival at Stanford.
Though Gardiner finds it hard to define
an exact time frame for his sleep apnea at
tacks, he believes they occur for roughly 30
seconds until he is able to wake up and take a
few deep breaths.
"I'm aware that 1 can't breathe and that if
I could only wake up, I could breathe," Gar
diner said.
Gardiner's attacks were more frequent,
however, than he originally realized. While
he thought that he experienced them only
sporadically, his girlfriend told him that they
occurred at least two or three times in the
space of one night.
The disease is intensified by sleeping on
one's back, according to Webmd.com, an on
line health resource, and after doing research
on his condition, Gardner has since switched
to sleeping on his side. Sleep apnea can often
be a cause of exhaustion and tiredness due to
its prevention of deep sleep during the night.
However, Gardner is unsure whether his
fatigue is a result of his sleep apnea.
"I'm really tired all the time, but I don't
know if it's because of that," Gardiner said.
Dement said that chronic sleep loss is the
most prevalent sleep problem among college
students. While he said that sleep specialists
are unable to determine whether it's a behav
ioral or educational issue, he feels that it is an
issue that is significantly lacking awareness
and attention on campus.
"The last big challenge in the [sleep] field
is to get into the mainstream education," De
ment said.
Clete Kushida, a sleep disorder specialist
at the Stanford Medical Center, agrees that
chronic sleep loss is a significant issue on col
lege campuses.
"Even though college-age students are
very efficient sleepers, meaning that they are
able to sleep over 90 percent of the time that
they are in bed, they are often chronically
sleep deprived and carry a large sleep debt,"
he said.
Dement feels similarly.
"Easily one half of the student body
would benefit greatly from taking sleep as se
riously as [they take healthy] eating and fit
ness," said Dement. "Sleep deprivation can
get you into horrible tragedy."

The School of Medicine is testing the efficacy of Ropinirole when used as-needed rather than
regularly. Ropinirole is thought to treat a sleep disorder called Restless Leg Syndrome.

STAFF WRITER
Like eating vegetables, exercising and
brushing one's teeth, we all know that getting
enough sleep is essential. But many people
don't get enough sleep — and not because
they're too busy to hit the sack — because
they literally can't.
Sleep disorders, ranging from Restless
Leg Syndrome, or RLS, to sleep apnea, can
make it difficult for some to get their requi
site eight or so hours of sleep. But new re
search suggests that many disorders can be
treated, or at least managed.
RLS is characterized exactly by its name
— a disease that causes an uncontrollable
urge to move or twitch one's legs. RLS suffer
ers have trouble sitting on airplanes, going to
movies and even sleeping. A new study by re
searchers at Stanford's School of Medicine
shows that treatment of RLS may be easier
than previously thought,
Co-investigator of the study and medical
student Scott Leibowitz said that about 10 to
15 percent of the population nationwide suf
fers from RLS and about half of this group in
herits the disorder. RLS can also be a side ef
fect of pregnancy and diseases such as
Parkinson's or even iron deficiency.
According to Leibowitz, RLS has "literal
ly driven people crazy," referring to one spe
cific instance of suicide.
A previous study conducted at Stanford in
2003 tested the effectiveness of taking the
drug Ropinirole, a drug that counters the ef
fects of a specific brain chemical —
dopamine — that can hinder sleep when it
acts on one part of the brain. The 2003 study
looked at whether taking the drug on a regu
lar basis could treat RLS. The new research,
which is underway, tests whether Ropinirole
proves as effective when used on an as-need
ed-basis.
The 12-week-long study is observing men
and women between the ages of 18 and 70
who experience RLS intermittently, between
two to four times a week. Participants will
come in four times a week to report on the
status of their RLS and how it impacts their
lives and moods.
Local study participant Debby Rice de
cided to participate in the research experi
ment after years dealing with the "uncontrol
lable urge" to move her legs, which she expe
riences as a result of her RLS.
"It is almost as though I try to rein my legs
in. but after a period of time, the urge is too
strong and I must move them," said Rice.
