ers said the conference, as well as the
International Initiative at large,
hoped to foster and cultivate on cam
pus.
"To get interaction between a di
verse set of professors from different
fields and policy makers who deal
with issues that faculty members are
analyzing is a real opportunity for cre
ative thinking." Sagan said.
Officials at SIIS called the confer
