When it comes to public affairs, Stanford is
not that different from the White House. Just ask
former White House communications director
David Demarest, the University's new vice pres
ident for public affairs. He replaced Gordon
Earle on March 1.
"I intend to understand and huild communi
cation links about the various organizational
groups on campus," said Demarest, who will di
rect community initiatives and oversee govern
ment relations and special events, including Stan
lord Lively Arts.
One of his major goals is to simplify the com
plex aspects of the University so that it is more ac
cessible to students, faculty and members of local
communities. He predicts upcoming years to be
action-packed.

"The University is looking aggressively at the
future in terms of global issues, international ini
tiatives and the Bio-X initiative," Demarest said,
adding that while he brings tactical experience the
p< isition, he is working on gaining the necessary in
stitutional knowledge.
"Stanford is a very complex, fascinating and
vigorous institution," said Demarest. "A lot of
what I've been doing so far is listening."
Demarest, who served for four years as an as
sistant to President George H.W. Bush, was in
volved in speech writing, media relations and in
tergovernmental affairs.
When he left the White House, he became ex
ecutive vice president and director of corporate
communications at BankAmerica. He later filled
a similar position at Visa International. Last year,
he founded Aspen Line Reputation Strategies, a
reputation management and communications
consulting firm.

"The transition from the private sector to aca
demia has not been jarring,"he said."The field of
communications and public affairs is largely
about understanding the world around you; a lot
of the skills 1 acquired at organizations I have
worked with in the past are transferable to my
position at Stanford."
When asked whether or not he has encoun
tered any negative perceptions of Stanford, he
said he hasn't since his arrival on campus.
"I'm just beginning to grasp Stanford's poten
tial for good,and lam still in awe," Demarest said.
"It's a little humbling."
His predecessor, Earle, assumed the role of
executive director public affairs and is current
ly working in New York to raise Stanford's pro
file on a nationwide scale, particularly on the
East Coast.
