# Tuition to be waived for low-income families
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIORS STAFF WRITER 
Of the students Stanford admits each year from
Logan I ligh School in Union (ity.some end upon
the Farm while others choose less-expensive Uni
versity of California schools. But Sharon Hope,
program manager for the public high school's col
lege and career center, says that many talented
students from low-income families don't even
consider Stanford because of its $40.(100-a-year
price tag.
University President John llennessy recently
announced a financial aid policy intended to
change that. By 2010. families earning less than
$45,000 per year will not beexpected to contribute
any money toward their child's undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford. Hie student may still have to
do work-study and take out loans, but Stanford
will cover everything else, from tuition to books to
toothpaste.
In an interview with the Daily. University
Provost John Etchemendy said the new policy
"will end up having an effect on a relatively small
number of students," because Stanford already

covers most costs lor low-income families.
"But it has a huge advantage in being easier to
explain," Etchemendy said. "One of the things
we're worried about is that there's this perception
that there are schools that people without a lot of
income can't afford to go to. Nothing could be fur
ther from the truth, even right now, without the
change in policy."
Etchemendy said students whose parents earn
under $45,(KM) currently comprise about 15 per
cent of the undergraduate population and account
fora total of $2.3 million per year in parental con
tributions to the University.
Besides eliminating the parental contribution,
Stanford also hopes to reduce the self-help expec
tation — such as loans and work-study—for
those students to $4,500 a year, which would cost
the University about another $1.7 million.
Etchemendy estimated that both goals could be
accomplished with around $80 million, Stanford
will soon launch a campaign to raise.
That would be money well-spent, said Alice
Kleeman, college adviser at Menlo-Atherton
11 igh School, which serves students from East Palo
Alto and EastMenlo Park, two low-income neigh

borhoods, as well as from the affluent Atherton.
"Right now, there aren't a lot of students that
[the new policy] would apply to," she said, noting
that few if any of the 14 students Stanford admit
ted from Menlo-Atherton this year are from fam
ilies earning less than $45,000.
"However, I think as it becomes more widely
known, it gives students more hope earlier that
there might be a way for them to go to a school like
Stanford." That hope, she said, could be a power
ful motivator.
That's why Etchemendy said that one of the
most important aspects of the plan is getting the
word out.
Kleeman said she already knew of the propos
al through a variety of sources, including Stan
ford's own outreach efforts. Across the bay at
Logan, Hope hadn't yet heard about it, but she
knew of similar proposals by Harvard and Yale,
both of which garnered national headlines by
eliminating parental contributions for low-income
families.
