# Design school in the works
## A 						multidisciplinary venture, Stanford Institute for Design to encourage innovation 
### BONNIE SWIFT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Stanford Institute for Design, com
monly referred to as the d.school is in the
process of being launched. It will be a place
for interdisciplinary design research and
teaching. Projects and courses at the d.school
will mainly be offered to graduate students
in engineering, medicine, business, the hu
manities and education, although under
graduates and faculty from a variety of back
grounds will be able to participate as well.
The d.school has already raised $35 mil
lion from a single private donor, and is close
to meeting its fundraising goals. In addition,
the Stanford School of Engineering has do
nated the Peteresen Building to house the
d.school, which is close to the Main Quad
and currently under renovation.
University President John Hennessy, in
an annual address made earlier this month to
the Academic Council, said the campus
needs to invest more in interdisciplinary
projects that benefit humanity and the envi
ronment.
"Stanford, with its breadth of excellence
and its contiguity, is well positioned to pur
sue such interdisciplinary initiatives (which]
will require new funding and new facilities,
as well as new ways of organizing teaching
and research," he told the council.
The d.school will fill a unique role in the de
sign community at Stanford, as a truly multi
disciplinary venture. The glue that will hold the
projects together will be what the d.school's
founders refer to as "design thinking."
In a March 14 TIME Magazine article

written about the new d.school, Co-founder
David Kelley is quoted, "For me, it's like a re
ligious thing. I truly believe design thinking
will make your life better."
Having worked extensively designing
products, services and environments, the
founders of the d.school adhere to the idea
that that innovation is most likely to occur
when strong multidisciplinary groups come
together and explore the intersection of
their different points of view, a method that
is relatively novel in an academic setting.
George Kembel, also a co-founder of the
d.school said that, "Design thinking culti
vates a culture of collaboration, and enables
members of a team to move more quickly
and build on one another's ideas."
Reducing differences in status and in
creasing leadership based on who has ex
pertise related to the problem at hand are
also core principles in design thinking, Kem
bel added. Stanford's location in the Silicon
Valley places the University in a very con
venient location for collaborative work with
technologically innovative industries, he
said.
Both Kelley and Kembel have extensive
experience in the real world of design. As a
tenured professor in Mechanical Engineer
ing who has taught at Stanford for more than
25 years, Kelley is also the co-founder of the
world-renowned design firm, IDEO. Ac
cording to the TIME Magazine article,
IDEO has worked to "bridge the gap be
tween modern design and modern business."
Kelley designed the very first Apple com
puter mouse and the light-up "LAVATORY
OCCUPIED" sign used in Boeing 7475. Dur
ing the 19905, IDEO was one of the most
prominent product-design firms in the Sili
con Valley, working with big firms and pro
ducing hundreds of user-friendly designs, ac
cording to the TIME article.
