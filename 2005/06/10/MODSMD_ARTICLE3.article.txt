# Student body elects new ASSU leaders
## Kannokada/Okonkwo triumph 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When the result of the ASSU executive election was announced
on Friday, the 150 or so students gathered in the CoHo began to scan
the room to find the winners.The Avalanche of Diversity slate was
there with supporters, including megaphone-equipped members of
The Chaparral and an inflatable turkey displayed on stage. But it
seemed as if neither the Carr / Castillo slate nor the Kannokada /
Okonkwo slate had shown up.
Within minutes, however, the victorious Melanie Kannokada
and Aneto Okonkwo, both juniors, made their way from the back of
the CoHo to the stage to greet friends and supporters.
Kannokada, who describes herself as a "normally calm person,"
seemed to hold back tears as she received hugs and shook hands.
"What did I tell you? What did I tell you?" shouted one eager sup
porter as he approached the ASSU president-elect.
But Kannokada would be the first to say that she was shocked by
the results.
"Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong," she said
of her campaign in an interview with'lTie Stanford Daily following
the announcement. She listed the late delivery of fliers and the fail
ure to receive endorsements from some student organizations —
including the Students of Color Coalition and TTie Daily — as two
things that did not work in her slate's favor. Both Kannokada and
Okonkwo admitted that before coming to the CoHo, they thought
that their chances of a victory' were slim.
However, no one seemed more shocked than Victoria Carr. Sur
rounded by a dozen supporters, the normally talkative junior re
mained silent and seated at a table while her running mate, junior
Fernando Castillo, stood by. The silence, it seemed, was to maintain
her composure. When she told The Daily that she would prefer not
to be interviewed, her eyes brimmed with tears. Castillo also chose

not to comment.
The Carr / Castillo slate had run a more visible campaign — in
White Plaza, for example, the duo's posters greatly outnumbered
those of the Kannokada / Okonkwo slate — and while no slate had
a clear edge going into the two days of voting, there had been some
talk on campus that Carr and Castillo would come out on top.
Among those who gathered to listen to Elections Commissioner
Troy Steinmetz, a sophomore, announce the results of the election,
there were more than a handful of students who seemed surprised
by the outcome.
While Kannokada and Okonkwo were being interviewed by The
Daily, for example, one student approached the pair and asked,
"How did you do it? 1 mean, did you get the IFC [Interfraternity
Council] vote?"The slate had received official endorsements from
both the IFC and the Intersorority Council, as well as the Jewish
Leadership Council and Club Sports.
Okonkwo said that while he and Kannokada had not received
what some would say are key endorsements, they received support
from smaller student groups whose leaders encouraged members
to vote. He also explained that the pair ran a "grassroots" cam
paign that focused on door-to-door outreach in order to "meet as
many people as possible." And he said that they "focused on get
ting out the grad vote."
Though there is no way to determine which get-out-the-vote
strategies were successful and which ones were not, the last tac
tic seemed to have worked. A total of 1,021 graduate students
voted in the executive race, whereas only 748 voted last year.
Kannokada and Okonkwo captured more graduate-student
votes than did Carr and Castillo; they also won more undergrad
uate-student votes.
