# Google gives The Daily a sneak peek
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Google opened its sprawling Mountain View
campus to journalists for the first time yesterday
to sketch its vision for the future of Web searching
and to announce the release of several new prod
ucts, including a personalized homepage option
similar to that offered by Yahoo! and a searchable
satellite mapping of the earth.
"Some of our users want the clean, classic
homepage," said Marissa Mayer, director of con
sumer Web products at Google and a Stanford
graduate. "But some of our users want more."
That "more" is a customizable homepage —
now available at labs.google.com — that inte
grates Google's Web-based products, including its
popular Gmail service and GoogleMaps-powered
driving directions, into one personalized Web site.
The launch is the first in a new a line of "fusion"
products meant to unify what some have called a
haphazard hodgepodge of tools.
True to the Google style, the interface of the
new options is uncluttered and simple. Users will
be able to customize their Google homepage to
feature news headlines, stock quotes, Gmail snip
pets, movie times and weather reports. There is
even a word or quote of the day feature.
The Google homepage feature allows users to
click-and-drag frames for instant customization,
setting it apart from similar tools offered by
other companies including Microsoft and Amer
ica Online.
Google representatives also announced the im
pending release of Google Earth, a searchable
satellite imaging of the world, with high-resolution
images of parts of the world previously neglected

by satellite imaging programs, including Santiago,
Chile, and South Africa.The new product will also
allow users to navigate terrain features so that
mountains really tower and valleys actually sink.
Google Earth will also be able to take users on vir
tual road trips.
"You can do an awful lot of things you can't do
in maps," said Sergey Brin, Google co-founder
who earned his doctorate in computer science at
Stanford.
While executives remained mum on other
products in the development pipeline, including a
much-rumored Google web browser, researchers
offered the group a glimpse at other technologies
in the pipeline.
Machine translations, for instance, have come a
long way at Google.
"Historically, the approach to building ma
chine translation systems is to have expert ma
chine linguists write down dictionaries and rules
on how to translate, say. from Chinese to English,"

said researcher Franz Och. "TVying to write down
all the rules on how to translate from Chinese to
English is very hard."
Instead, Google is fine-tuning a translation
program that can automatically translate back and
forth between documents in different languages
— a sort of virtual Rosetta Stone.
Current machine translations are inconsistent
at best, Och said. One current translation program
translated "The White House confirmed the exis
tence of a new bin Laden tape" in Arabic to
"Alpine white new presence tape registered for
coffee confirms Laden," in English.
Another Google researcher, Marius Pasca,said
he wants the Web to be searchable by different
categories of facts, like dates or locations. A search
for "Marilyn Monroe" by date, for instance, would
result in a timeline of her life.

One of Google's newest projects is to allow users to personalize the search engine's homepage. Google
users will soon be able to view their g-mail, news items of interest and their local weather.
