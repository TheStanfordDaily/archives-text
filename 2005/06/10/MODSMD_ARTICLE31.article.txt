## GSB applicants busted for hacking 
### SARA INÉS CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Forty-one applicants to the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business hacked into their online
applications last week using in
structions found on an online
Business Week forum. The GSB
has yet to determine a definitive
course of action.
Derrick Bolton, director of
admission at the Business
School, declined to comment,
and only provided an e-mail
statement in which he said,
"Business schools teach students
to make decisions and to be ac
countable for those decisions."
Early last Wednesday, some
one known only by the username
"brookbond" posted online the
procedure he used to hack into
the Harvard Business School to
view his application decision.
Others followed suit.
About 150 students total tried
to access their applications from
Stanford, Harvard, Duke,
Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth and
two programs at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology, said
Len Metheny, chief executive of
ficer of Apply Yourself, Inc., the
software company that manufac
tured the seven software pro
grams that were hacked.
At press time Harvard and
Carnegie Mellon were the only
two schools to announce that all
applicants who hacked into the
system will be automatically re
jected.
The instructions were re
moved from the forum at the
start of the business day Wednes
day, said Kimberly Quinn, direc
tor of communications for Busi
ness Week. She added that this
was the first time any hacking in
formation was posted on the Web
site, which is currently under
close watch.

There have been no similar in
cidents involving the software
since its implementation in 1998
and has since processed millions
of applications, Metheny said.
"It did touch us by surprise,"
he said. "Within two-and-a-half
hours our team had moved to
modify the problem."
Metheny added that Ap
ply Yourself has not ruled out
the possibility of pressing crimi
nal charges.
"We take this matter very seri
ously," he said. "We are evaluat
ing our options."
The software used by the Busi
ness School has several levels of
tracking that enable all of the pro
grams affected to know which ap
plications are accessed — that al
lows the hackers to be identified,
Metheny explained.
The Business School had not
placed any application decisions
online at the time of the breach,
so even successful hackers were
unable to obtain the information
they hoped to find.
However, there remains some
uncertainty about whether appli
cants themselves or others who
had access to their passwords did
the hacking.
Kim Clark, dean of the Har
vard Business School said on
Hiesday that the school will reject
all 119 applicants who tried to
view their admission decisions.
He added that the applicants will
not be barred from reapplying to
the school in the future.
The Business School has not
yet issued any statement about
the fate of the 41 applicants who
attempted to access the decisions,
which will not be posted until
March 31.
