# Surgery prof. sues Univ. and Hospital
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A surgeon at Stanford Hospital has filed
suit against both the University and the hos
pital alleging racial and gender discrimina
tion.
Denise Johnson, associate professor of sur
gery and the only African-American female
surgeon at Stanford, filed the case on Monday
in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
She claims, among other things, that she
was paid less than her white and male coun
terparts, that she has been unfairly targeted
because of past complaints she made against
the University and that she was asked to sub
mit to a random drug test even though the
practice is inconsistent with hospital policy.
"We believe Dr. Johnson's case is without
merit," wrote Paul B. Costello, a spokesperson
for the Stanford Medical Center, in a brief
statement.
He also denied that Johnson had been re
quired to submit to drug testing.
In addition to compensation for lost wages
and emotional distress, Johnson is seeking to
prohibit random drug testing on the grounds
that it is a violation of privacy.

She also claims that she was not asked to
apply for the position of chief of breast sur
gery even though she specializes in cancer re
search and is well-known in the field. But
Costello denied any "pattern of employment
discrimination" against Johnson.
"During the past few years," Costello
wrote, "Dr. Johnson has been promoted in two
instances: first, to an assistant dean for med
ical student advising in September 2002 and
second, from assistant to associate professor
in the medical school in May 2003."
After she was passed over for the chief of
breast surgery position, Johnson said the hos
pital reduced the number of patients she
would receive, causing her practice to lose 77
percent of its business.
In March 2005, Johnson sent an e-mail to
the Medical School Dean's Office estimating
that she had been paid $500,000 less than
"similarly situated surgeons" since 2000. Less
than a week later, she was accused of being
under the influence during surgery. Johnson
contends that this incident led directly to the
drug testing, the results of which were nega
tive.
These allegations come as Stanford, like
many of its peer institutions, struggles to in

crease minority and female representation.
The University Provost's Advisory Com
mittee on the Status of Women Faculty, for ex
ample, reported that women in the clinical sci
ences are "are significantly less likely than
their male colleagues to perceive their work
place as supportive" or "to believe that they
receive sufficient information for profession
al advancement."
Campus-wide, the number of black faculty
dropped by 2.2 percent last year, and the num
ber of female faculty grew by only 0.4 percent,
according to a report presented to the Faculty
Senate on April 28.
Johnson has received numerous scientific
grants for breast cancer research and several
teaching and mentoring awards from the Uni
versity.
In 1989, she became the first African-
American woman hired in the General
Surgery Department. Before that, she worked
at the Stanford-affiliated Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Medical Center until she was
fired in 1997 for refusing to take part in firing
or demoting two other physicians.
