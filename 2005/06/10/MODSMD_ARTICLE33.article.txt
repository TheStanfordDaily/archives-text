# Film, media major and minor begin in fall
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new major and minor program in film and
media studies will be introduced to the Commu
nication and Art and Art History Departments
this fall. The existing two-year documentary film
master's program, will also be turned into a mas
ter's of fine arts, or MFA, program in the fall of
2(X)6.
The Faculty Senate will vote on finalizing these
programs during its May 12 meeting.
"It'll be about ideas, understanding stories,
genre, the language of film," said Communication
Prof. Kris Samuelson, who will serve as the inau
gural chair of the new program for the first three
years.
To make way for the MFA program, the cur
rent MA program in filmmaking will not be ad
mitting a new class this fall. Applications will be
accepted for the following year, allowing the cur
rent class to graduate and the next entering class
to start with a clean slate.
Samuelson and Scott Bukatman, an associ
ate professor of art who will direct undergradu
ate studies for the new program,said interest in

the new programs has been overwhelming. The
film and media studies program has sponsored
several events during this academic year, and
two more events are scheduled before com
mencement.
One of the events, "Urban Trauma and the
Metropolitan Imagination: The City in Contem
porary Media," a conference sponsored by the
film and media studies program, will run from this
Thursday through Saturday.
A second event on June 1 will include the
homecoming of Stanford alumnus and film direc
tor Alexander Payne fora screening of his Oscar
nominated film "Sideways."
The new major and minor are designed to
have five different concentrations: film history,
film culture, film and performance, film and
technology and film criticism. An internship
program will also be established for students
who participate.
Changes have been a long time coming, Bukat
man said. The program was in the works eight
years ago when he was hired, but the real legwork
began two or three years ago.
"Stanford recognized that there is a field out
there," he said. "Moving image culture contours

our lives, and a program like this helps everybody
deal with that."
Samuelson and Bukatman said the University
has been very supportive of the arts in general and
the development of the program in particular.
Providing resources, support and promoting a
campus-wide effort to expand the arts, Stanford
administrators have been vital to the creation of
the program, Samuelson said.
Unlike similar programs at peer institutions,
Stanford's major and minor programs will not
provide vocational training in filmmaking.
"We are not becoming a film school in the
sense of UCLA or USC," Samuelson explained.
"The program will help students who want to
work in Hollywood, in screenwriting, production,
film studies, film history and the study of film â€”
to work in all aspects of the industry."
It is uncertain how many students will decide
to pursue the new major, Samuelson said, but
there will not be a cap to the number of majors or
minors. Bukatman said he has already seen en
rollments in his classes double during the prelim
inary stages of the program.
