### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Police Hashers lit up the streets of
downtown Palo Alto Friday night as of
ficers attempted to contain what partici
pants called an "anarchist" rally. Nearly
2(X) protesters — many clad in black
hoods, masks and bandannas — turned
hostile during the "Reclaim the Streets"
party beginning at Lytton Plaza, said a
Palo Alto Police Department report.No
injuries were reported, but the crowd
jumped on cars, turned over trash cans
and damaged several University Ave.
businesses.
One protester. William O'Connor, a
19 year old from Berkeley, was charged
with smashing the window of American
Express with a large flagpole,stated the
report. Another suspect, a juvenile, was
cited with vandalism charges and re
leased to his parents. Police could not be
reached for comment.
"This happens every year, but it's
never been this big " said Keith Dunck
el, a sophomore from Palo Alto High
Sch(K)l who observed the rally. "This
year it's a big radical movement."
The "Reclaim the Streets" party,
which began at 8:30 p.m.. was initially
under control. Police had been tipped
off about the event beforehand and di
rected traffic while monitoring the
crowd.
"It was just music and fun at the be

ginning," said Stanford senior Abby
Hull, who was in attendance. "The cops
were really cool at first. They were just
directing traffic —they weren't really
doing anything.There was a speaker and
an amp and the music was great. Then
the crowd started to move and every
thing changed."
The protesters moved into the
streets and begun chanting "Bombs are
dropping while you're shopping" and
"Whose streets? Our streets." said a post
on the Web site of The Paly Voice, Palo
Alto High School's student newspaper.
At first, passersby appeared more curi
ous than agitated.
By 9:30 p.m., more than 30 police of
ficers had herded the crowd on to
Hamilton St.and closed off sections of
downtown streets — including Univer
sity Ave. —in an effort to control the
mass of high school and college students.
Armed with police dogs and stun-guns,
they eventually pushed the crowd to
1 lamilton and Webster Streets, where
the rally dispersed.
Traffic was temporarily disrupted
and officers yelled at drivers attempting
to bypass the police officers blocking
streets.
For the more part, business on Uni
versity Ave. went undisturbed. Some of
the demonstrators attempted to run
through the Borders Bookstore, but
