### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Stadium, a time-honored part of the Univer
sity's landscape, may soon have a date with a wrecking
ball, as it is scheduled to be retrofitted or even replaced
with a state-of-the-art arena.
In an official statement, Alan Acosta, associate vice
president for public affairs, called it a "long-needed reno
vation that will not only benefit Stanford Athletics,but the
University at-large and the countless community resi
dents who attend Stanford sporting events."
The need for these changes has been clear for many
years, Acosta wrote. But plans for the project are only be
ginning to be formalized.
Citing sources close to the athletic department, an arti
cle in yesterday's San Francisco Chronicle said the stadi
um would be demolished soon after the Cardinal plays
Notre Dame on Nov. 26.
The article stated that the building project comes as a
result of Stanford Stadium's outdated bathrooms, its ob
solete running track and a drop in attendance, which has
made it difficult to fill the 85,500 seats. The new arena
would only seat 55,000,The Chronicle reported.
However, the University has not announced a time
frame for the project, and Acosta said that the project is
still in its "earliest stages."The Stanford Board of Trustees
and Santa Clara County must approve the plans before
further steps are taken.
The original Stadium was constructed in 1921, born out
of a competition with UC Berkeley to see which universi
ty could build a stadium first. Although Stanford won the
contest and scored the christening touchdown on its home
field, the Bears won the inaugural Big Game that year.
The stadium has since hosted the World Cup and Olympic
soccer matches, as well as Super Bowl XIX in 1985.
