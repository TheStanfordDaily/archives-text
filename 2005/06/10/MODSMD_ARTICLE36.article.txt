# Stanford to build hotel on Sand Hill
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A 21 -acre triangular slice of land on the southeast corner of
Interstate 280 and Sand Hill Road is "just sitting there with
nothing on it," said Stanford Management Company
spokesman Bill Phillips. "It doesn't do anything to support the
University's mission — in fact, it's costing us money in taxes."
That may soon change. The University last week announced
plans to build a 120-room luxury hotel on the site. The propos
al also calls for new office buildings.
The hotel would be operated by Rosewood Hotels and Re
sorts, a "privately-held ultra-luxury hotel management compa
ny," according to its Web site. Rosewood's properties, which in
clude The Carlyle in New York and The Mansion on TUrtle
Creek in Dallas, tend to have nightly room rates ranging up
ward from about $350.
Phillips said he expects the hotel to cater to business visitors
to Sand Hill Road's "venture capital row" and the Stanford Re
search Park area, as well as some visitors to the University and
Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
Before they can go forward, the plans will be subject to an
Environmental Impact Report and a traffic study. The Menlo
Park City Council must then approve the project.
Phillips said the University is hoping to open the hotel by
summer 2008 if all goes well.
This is the second time Stanford has tried to build a hotel on
the site. In the 1980s, Stanford contracted to lease the land to
Westin Hotels fora 350-room hotel, Phillips said. Those plans
fell through when the economy declined toward the end of the
decade.
The current proposal does not involve a lease; rather, Stan
ford will own the land and the building, while Rosewood acts as
the hotel management agent, sharing the revenues. Phillips said
Stanford approached several hotel chains, including the Ritz-
Carlton and the Four Seasons, and eventually decided on Rose
wood, which he said has the highest revenue per available room
of any major chain.
Meanwhile, a new Four Seasons is scheduled to open in Oc
tober along Highway 101 in East Palo Alto —so that the Penin
sula, which used to lack top-end hotels, may soon have two.
In the past, Stanford has often faced stiff opposition from en
vironmental groups when it tries to build on undeveloped land.
It is unclear whether this project will encounter significant re
sistance. Bounded by Interstate 280, Sand Hill Road and adja
cent Stanford-owned office buildings, the site is not environ
mentally sensitive, Phillips contended.
David Johnson, Menlo Park's business development manag
er, said there would be "plenty of opportunity for public com
ment on all sides of the issue" after the Environmental Impact
Report comes out.
Johnson said the project could be a financial boon to Menlo
Park.
"This is a very exciting revenue opportunity for the city," he
said. Menlo Park would reap a 10 percent Transient Occupancy
Tax on every room rental, in addition to property taxes.
