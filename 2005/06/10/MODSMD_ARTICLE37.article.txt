## Women capture 14th NCAA title Perfect ending for No. 1 Card 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a 4-oshutout of No. 11 Texas (25-6), the No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (27-0) clinched its record-set
ting 14th NCAA Championship title to cap another flaw
less season.
No. 25 senior Erin Burdette (22-8) sealed the deal by
defeating the Longhorns' No. 84 Kendra Strohm (21-19),
6-4. 6-1, at Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga.
In the 23-year history of the NCAA Championships,
Stanford ranks first with 14 titles, Florida ranks second
with 4 and Georgia has won two. Southern California
claimed a title in 1983, while the Longhorns came out on
top in 1995.
Legacy aside, this year's squad showed that the true
essence of being the most successful team in women's col
legiate tennis stems from the heart and determination of
its players.
For Burdette. leading the team to another NCAA vic
tory meant battling a debilitating shoulder injury to clinch
Stanford's final match fora third time in her career.
After a week of either coming up just short in singles
play, or not finishing her match at all, Burdette's pivotal
straight-set victory was that much more satisfying.
"No matter how many championships you win, it's al
ways great to come out on top," Burdette said in a press
release. "I would have" to say that the excitement I feel
after the last point is one of my best memories in colle
giate tennis."
On court three. Burdette was leading 5-0,40-love in the
second set. Meanwhile.at No. 2 singles. No. 20 Alice Barnes
was fighting out a 5-3 lead. No. 84 freshman Whitney Dea
son was on the verge of victory on court five, leading 5-1.
Neither head coach Lele Forood nor assistant coach
Frankie Brennan saw the final point, but both attested to
the poignancy of Burdette's resounding finish.
"I've seen it on Erin's face all week, a feeling that she
was just not quite getting over the hump,but improving a
little bit each day," Brennan said. "She's had so many in
juries in the last two years, and 1 don't think she's quite got
ten to do what she wanted on an individual level. But for
her t< > finish the way she did. to go out a winner, was icing
on the cake."
I or No. 36 Deason (30-3), rounding out her first year on

the Farm with a team title meant pushing through a nag
ging back injury to clinch a huge win in the semifinals
against Clemson.
Deason downed the Tigers' Daniela Alvarez (15-15) in
straight sets and sent Stanford to the final. 6-4,6-2.
"The girl 1 played was pretty tougli and didn't make
a lot of errors," Deason said. "1 wasn't playing my best
but 1 fought through it and it was good for me to get
through that."
"Whitney was coming off a [stress fracture] that
could have been career-ending if it had gotten any
worse," Brennan added. "But she comes to us and says,
'Hopefully I can play both doubles and singles all four
days.' From my perspective, this is what our team is
about, and the girls amaze me every day with the way
they come out and fight."
In doubles, Deason teamed up with sophomore
Theresa Logar to do some major damage. The newly
formed No. 3 doubles duo won all four of its completed
NCAA matches.
With an ace from Logar. the Cardinal tandem (4-0)
sealed an 8-5 victory over Texas' Kellv Baritot and Court

ney Zauft (23 I?.) in hike a I 0 lead over the l.onghorns.
Boasting its most reliable No. 1 doubles team in recent
years. Stanford was able to add a new level ot confidence
to its already sound squad. And what the last-minute
pairing of Logat and Deason may have lacked in shared
experience was made up for b\ a formidable array of
groundstrokes.
"We had been pla\ing leally great doubles the whole
week, so the doubles was huge for us." Brennan said.
" lhere was a lot ot piessure on us to beat someone like
Texas,an I Ith tournament seed.and I think it relaxed us to
know that the doubles teams could rely on each other; if
one team lost the other two could step up and secure the
doubles point. We haven 1 had this in past years."
For Barnes (26-7). a junior, owning her second team
title meant dominating both singles and doubles to be
named Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament.
In an unsettling quarterfinal match against Georgia,
Barnes gained momentum against Natalie Frazier by win
ning a first-set tiebreak,7 6(4).
