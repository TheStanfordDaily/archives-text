onship match with a 3-1 victory over Washington, the
Cardinal's second win over the Huskies this season
and only Washington's third loss overall.
Minnesota also posted a 3-1 victory, overpowering
a surprisingly sluggish USC team to set up the final
match-up.
It was clear early on that the Golden Gophers
would be no match fora determined and energetic
Stanford squad.The Cardinal had not lost in a month
and a half and were not going to allow that streak to
end in the most important match of the season.
Helped by some of Nnamani's best hitting of the
season and several strong supporting performances,
the Cardinal became national champions with a 30-
23,30-27.30-21 sweep of Minnesota.
Nnamani made only two hitting errors in the
match, the first of which did not come until the middle
of game two Only one tip into the net and another tip
that was blocked marred a 29-kill performance. Hit
ting at a .562 clip, she added four digs and a powerful
block.

the Tournament. Joining her on the All-Tournament
team were fellow senior Jennifer Hucke (nine kills,
four assists, three digs, two blocks), sophomore out
