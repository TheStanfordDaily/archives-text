# Women's rugby team claims title
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In front of a packed house at Steu
ber Rugby Stadium and a live televi
sion audience, Stanford junior fullback
Olivia Anglade struggled to describe
how it felt to be a national champion.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet,"
Anglade told a College Sports Televi
sion reporter after Stanford dominat
ed defending champion Penn State, 53-
6. Saturday to capture its first women's
rugby title since 1999. "Maybe it will
sink in after a few beers tonight."
I he Stanford women may still be
pinching themselves — and hungover
— today, not because they ever doubt
ed that they could go all the way, but
because they made it so easy.
Stanford used its superior quick
ness to counter Penn State's power
throughout the match. Ihe Nittany
Lions had no answer for Stanford's
speedy wings, who were routinely in
the open field en route to break away

tries and a 29-3 halftime lead.
And unlike Friday's 27-22 semifinal
win over Princeton, in which the Cardi
nal built a 27-5 lead before holding off a
frantic Tigers rally, Stanford was in con
trol for all 80 minutes against Penn State.
"We remembered yesterday,"
freshman fly-half Jossy Tseng said.
"Once we were up at halftime we did
not want to let up."
And they didn't.
Sophomore Carey Myslewski tal
lied her third try of the game 12 min
utes into the second half and the con
version gave Stanford a 36-3 lead.
"We kept up the momentum in
this game," said Anglade, who scored
a try on a long break away at the 22-
minute mark to increase Stanford's
lead to 43-3.
Five minutes later, junior Victoria
Folayan took a pass from Anglade and
raced down the right sideline to push
the lead to 48-3.
"That's our strength, getting it
wide," said Anglade, who finished with

three tries and was named linal hour
MVP "Whoever finishes it.finishes it.'
First-year coach Jonathan Griffin,
who guided England's Loughbor
ough University to the women's colle
giate championship before coming to
Stanford, said Saturday's win was
every bit as exciting.
"This is as wonderful as that was,"
he said. "Each one's special. I'm just
happy for these tiirls. Iliey put all the
effort into it."
As the only team not from the Mid
Atlantic region in the l inal Four,Stan
ford's triumph represented a victory
for West Coast rugby as a whole.
"Nobody expected anything out of
us," Anglade said. "But we always
knew we had a good team."
"West Coast rugby is here." Tseng
said.
And so is the national champi
onship.
