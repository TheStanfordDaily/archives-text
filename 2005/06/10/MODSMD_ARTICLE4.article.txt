# Univ. boasts $94M int'l initiative
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is about to take a giant step toward ful
filling University President John Hennessy's vision
of a "global university."
Hennessy announced yesterday that Stanford has
raised $94 million dollars in gifts fora new multi-dis
ciplinary program focused on international studies.
This international initiative is the latest in a series
of large-scale interdisciplinary projects to be
launched, and Hennessy told The Daily that it should
also further Stanford's efforts to broaden its global
presence and reputation.

The most generous gift came from Stanford alum
ni Bradford Freeman and Ronald Spogli, founding
partners of the Los Angeles-based investment firm
Freeman Spogli & Co., who together donated $50
million toward the initiative.
The money will he used to create up to 10 inter
disciplinary professorships and to endow the direc
torship of the Stanford Institute for International
Studies, or SI IS. It will also support the work of the
institute's centers and programs and, together with
funds from the Office of the President, serve as seed
money to support competitive interdisciplinary re-
search grants. The current director
of SIIS is Political Science Prof.
Coit D. Blacker.
The gift is the largest ever to be
received by an international stud
ies program at Stanford, according
to Klas Bergman, associate director
for communications at SIIS.
The Stanford News Service re
ported that the initiative will tackle
three broad themes: "pursuing
peace and security in an insecure
world; reforming and improving
governance at all levels of society;
and advancing human health and
well being."
Stanford is uniquely situated to
approach some of the most stub
born issues in global politics today,
Hennessy said in an interview with
Hie Daily.
"The scope and challenge of in
ternational problems around the
world have grown more acute," he
said. "Universities could be one of
the most important sources of solu
tions."
In their current state, SIIS and
its research centers, including the
Center for International Security
and Cooperation, or CISAC, have
been conducting research in areas

like homeland security and risk
management. Bergman said this re
search would take on a "Universi
ty-wide dimension" under the new
initiative.
For instance, Bergman said he
envisioned a collaborative effort
between SIIS and the Medical
School to research defense against
biological attacks and the spread of
infectious diseases, including the
African AIDS epidemic.
SIIS is currently located in Enci
na Hall, which is also the site of the
Political Science Department.
Bergman said that, with funds pro
vided by the initiative, the "master
plan" down the road will be to
make changes to Encina to better
outfit the building as a hub for in
ternational studies.
According to Bergman, the first
serious plans for the initiative
began last spring when Hennessy
appointed Blacker and Engineer
ing Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cornell to
chair the Faculty Steering Commit
tee.
In the past several years, the
University has launched two other
major multidisciplinary initiatives,
Bio-X program in the James H.
Clark Center and the Environmen
tal Initiative.
