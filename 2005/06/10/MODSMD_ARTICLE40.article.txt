# Men upset Huskies
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Coming off an ugly loss to Washington
State that put a temporarily lid on any
NCAA Tournament talk, the Stanford men's
basketball team bounced back with its sweet
est - and most important - win of the season.
Ihe Cardinal's 77-67 upset win over No.
10 Washington likely means Stanford's
streak of 10 consecutive trips to NCAAs will
remain intact when the 65-team field is re
vealed on Sunday.
Yes, there was more to celebrate in Satur
day's regular-season finale at Maples Pavilion
than the careers of seniors Nick Robinson
and Rob I .ittle.
For one. Stanford (17-11.11-7 Pacific-10
Conference) helped dash Washington's
chances of winning its first conference title in
20 years. (Arizona, which was tied with the
Huskies for first place entering Saturday's
games, won at Arizona State later that day to
capture the Pac-10 title outright). It was also
proper payback after Washington ended
Stanford's 26-game winning streak in the
final game of the regular season last March.
Perhaps most importantly, however, it
showed that the Cardinal still have some gas
in the tank of their battered ride: it was a tes
tament to the resilience of this year's team, a
feel-good way to end the regular-season
chapter of a trying, emotional campaign.
"This was a great win because we've been
st) up and down this year, and to come out in
the last game in Maples for Nick and Rob and
to come off such a bad performance Thurs
day, it shows we didn't give in," junior guard
(Tiris Hernandez said. "We showed people
we still have something in us."
Hernandez finished with 12 points and
five assists and got plenty of support from
fellow point guard Jason Haas. The junior

reserve delivered an inspired perform
ance, doubling his previous career-high
with 18 points.
"After Thursday night I just said,' Hey, we
can't play any worse than we did,'" Haas said.
"With three guys coming off the bench,some
one needs to be productive.
Haas was — scoring 13 of his points on
14 free-throw attempts, after getting to the
line by displaying an attack-the-glass men
tality with the Huskies focused on shutting
down Hernandez. Washington effectively
dared Haas to beat them on certain posses
sions, and he did.
The win was a total team effort, howev
er, as junior forward Matt Haryasz chipped
in a career-high 24 points to go along with
10 rebounds.
Robinson scored 12 points and grabbed
nine rebounds in his final game at Maples
Pavilion. While Little's individual numbers (4
points,4 rebounds, l-for-7 shooting) were for
gettable, the win will be one to remember.
"It was great," Robinson said. "I'm
glad we were able to come out and com
pete and get a win. It was a lot of fun, I had
a good time."
Stanford did the three simple things head
coach Trent Johnson has preached all season.
They outrebounded the Huskies 40-34, took
care of the ball (12 assists, 12 turnovers) and
played solid defense. Afterward, Johnson
made his thoughts about the team's postsea
son hopes known.
"If we're not automatically in the
NCAAs, after beating Arizona and now
these guys, and the non-conference schedule
we play, and all the things these kids have
been through since I've been hired some
thing's wrong."
