Mystique is, of course, not a play

basketball team that has dominated
the sport for the last three years Hi at
phrase which decorated signs taped
to Stanford players' hotel room
doors in Kansas City. Mo. — was
supposed to remind Cardinal play
ers to look past the "mystique" of the
three-time defending national
champions.
And last night. Stanford did just
that as it held the Huskies to a 32.4
shooting percentage on its way to a
76-59 victory.
"(Connecticut] is not a national
championship team without a Diana
I'aurasi - they've struggled this year,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said. ' I
didn't feel like we were playing
against a ghost team."
At Saturday's press conference,
Connecticut head coach Geno Au
riemma commented that the NCAA
regional semi-final and final were
traditionally the most dangerous
games en route to the national cham
pionship. On Sunday, that was an un
derstatement as the No. 1 team in the
polls clashed with the defending na
tional champions for just the second

time in Tournament history.
It was the first time Stanford and
Connecticut have faced off since
1997. and Stanford's victory snapped
a two-game losing streak against the
Huskies.
After demonstrating poise be
yond her years during both the regu
lar and post-season, Candice Wig
gins. National Co-Freshman of the
Year, appeared rushed in the early
minutes last night. Despite playing
nearly the entire first half, she man
aged just six points, while turning the
ball over five times
"It was a little frustrating.just be
cause I was getting a little rushed and
that led to turnoverSs" Wiggins said.
"Everyone just got together and said
Let's take care of the ball and play
our game.""
In the second halt Wiggins shot
1 l-of-12 from the free throw line to
ice the game and lead the team in
scoring with 21 points.
"We decided we didn't want to go
home, we didn't want to be done,"
senior Susan King Borchardt said.
"We just love playing together. We
had a great game plan for this game,
and we just needed to execute it."
