# Softball loses to UT in Super Regional
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Lauren Lappin's disappoint
ment at Stanford (43-1 fS) being
eliminated from this year's
NCAA softhall tournament was
evident during the post-game
press conference. With her voice
breaking at various points, the
Stanford junior shortstop tried to
explain what happened in the No.
5 Cardinal's 6-0 loss to No. 11 Ten
nessee (64-13).
"It was definitely frustrating
today because we could not catch
a break," Lappin said, struggling
to hold back tears. "We were hit
ting the ball well but to players. As
my Dad would say, the soltball
gods were not on our side this
weekend."
Almost anyone present at Boyd
and Jill Smith Family Stadium dur
ing the third inning of Saturday's
game would have to agree. The
Cardinal's potent lineup, a force
throughout the season, was shutout
for seven innings by the Lady Vols'
Monica Abbott (47-7).
The typically dominant pitching
tandem of Becky McCullough and
Laura Severson was touched for
nine hits, five which came in the
third. But the Cardinal duo only
gave up three earned runs during
the entire game, and Stanford's
loss came down to errors and
missed opportunities.
"I respect and care for Stan
ford's student-athletes, and it
seems like a lot of things went our
way today." said Tennessee head
coach Ralph Weekly. "Monica
pitched outs, and we got the key
hits."
The Lady Vols had reached base
once prior to the third inning, on a
hit and then on an error by fresh
man first baseman Erin Howe, but
they failed to score.

Sarah Fekete led off the live
run rally in the third. Two singles
later, Tennessee had scored the
first run of the game with a bounc
er to centerfield. That prompted
Stanford head coach John
Rittman to McCullough, and Sev
erson pitched the rest of the game
in relief.
According to Rittman, McCul
lough was taken out early in con
sideration of the possibility of a
double-header (the Super Re
gional was a best-of-three series.
If Stanford came back to win, the
deciding game would have taken
place later that afternoon).
Tennessee's next hitter, Kather
ine Card, hit the ball through Sev
erson's legs to load the bases and
from then on, things began to un
ravel for the Cardinal. Freshman
second baseman Tricia Aggabao
couldn't snag a line drive but
picked it up and fired to Lappin
who was covering second for what
was an apparent force out. But the
runner was ruled safe, and Lappin
was given an error for stepping off
the bag.
"This game was not indicative
of our defense," Rittman said. "I
believe we were one of the best
defensive teams in the Pac-10. A
couple of things factored into this
today. You can't give a good team
outs."
Severson struck out the next
batter, but Kenora Posey reached
first when Howe was unable to
handle Aggabao's throw. Ten
nessee extended the 3-0 lead with a
two-run single to center.
"I didn't know this was going to
be my last game," Nelson said. "I
did enjoy my time here at Stanford
and I had a great time here."
