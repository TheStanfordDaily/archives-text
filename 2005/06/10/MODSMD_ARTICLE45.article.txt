# Duo falls in NCAA semifinals
## Warburg/Corkery can't defend title 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It had been a season of narrowly
missed opportunities for the No. 22
Stanford men's tennis team and the
NCAA Individual Tournament
proved to be no different. In the
team competition, the Cardinal (14-
11,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) lost to
Pepperdine in a light match on May
15, and this past Sunday in College
Station, Texas, Stanford's only dou
bles duo to enter the NCAA tourna
ment fell in the semifinals in a close
two-setter.
No. 2 seeded senior Sam Warburg
and junior KC Corkery advanced to
the semifinals of the doubles bracket
before falling to Louisiana State's
Mark Growcott and Ken Skupski.7-
6,6-4.The Tigers were then defeated
7-6. 7-5 in the championship match
on Monday by Georgia's John Isner
and Antonio Ruiz.
Corkery and Warburg had never
faced Growcott and Skupski as a
team before and therefore were not
as familiar with the Tigers as they
had been with previous opponents in
the tournament. The duo from LSU
served first in the match but quickly
got down 15-40 in the first game. On
break point, Corkery ripped a fore
hand, but his opponent at the net hit
a reflex volley fora winner, eluding
the Cardinal of their opportunity to
break and start the match on a strong

note.
"If we had broken serve there, it
may have been a whole different
match," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "It would have given us confi
dence. We had some [other] chances
but didn't have a lot of break points.
Both of the LSU guys came up with
big serves when they needed to. with
aces or unreturnables."
Following the match, LSU head
coach Jeff Brown told Whitlinger
that Sunday's match was the best his
team's duo had played all year. Both
teams played a strong match in terms
of service games, and both pairs held
serve throughout the match except
for one game in the second set where
Corkery's serve was broken, ulti
mately leading to Stanford's defeat.
Prior to facing LSU, Stanford
faced Washington's No. 18 Daniel
Chu and Alex Slovic in the Round of
16 on Friday. The 2004 NCAA dou
bles champions had met the Huskies
twice previously this season, losing
to the pair in Seattle but defeating
them 8-6 in the finals of the Pac-10
Individual Tournament.
Corkery and Warburg handed
Washington a 6-3, 6-4 defeat to ad
vance to the quarterfinals where
they would face another Pac-10 foe,
Arizona's No. 20 Roger Matalonga
and Colin O'Grady.
