against the nation's best in collegiate swim
ming. the No. 3 Stanford men's swimming and
diving team (6-1,3-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
concluded its season at the 2005 NCAA Divi
sion I Men's Swimming and Diving Champi
onships. held from March 24 to 26.
With 36 teams scoring points, the Cardinal
came in second in the final team standings

fending champion No. 2 Auburn Tigers, who
finished with 491 points. This was a repeat of
the 1-2 finish that occurred at the 2004 meet.
At the competition, held at the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis, the Cardinal team
proved that they had what it takes to compete
and succeed with the best, despite losing a
strong senior class following last season's sec
ond-place finish.
"Fans, swimming journalists and our com
petitor teams all severely underestimated us
all year and so we were out to prove ourselves
and earn respect all season," said sophomore
Shaun Phillips, who competed in the 200-yard,
500-yard, and 1650-yard freestyle events, as
well as the 800-yard freestyle relay.
On the first day of competition, it was ob
vious that it would be the competition in the
field - not the record books - that would set
the pace for the events of the meet. In the
first event, both California and Auburn
broke NCAA and American records in the
200-yard freestyle relay, with Cal finishing
on top with a blistering time of 1:15.78. Stan

ford touched the wall fourth in the event,
with the quartet of sophomores Ben Wild
man-Tobriner, Kyle Ransom, Matt Crowe
and senior Jayme Cramer clocking a 1:17.46.
In the following 500-yard freestyle event, the
top Stanford performer was Phillips, who
came in fifth in another field whose top fin
isher. Michigan's Peter Vanderkaay, broke a
pool record, coming in nearly five seconds
ahead of his nearest competitor. In the third
event, the 200-yard individual medley, Stan
ford junior Tobias Oriwol finished seventh in
the finals, with a time of 1:46.66, while first
place finisher Florida junior Ryan Lochte,
broke NCAA and American records in the
event.
The trend only continued as the 50-yard
freestyle sprint approached, in which Auburn
senior Fred Bousquet and Cal senior Duje
Draganja both broke NCAA and American
records of 19.05 in their swims, with Bousquet
finishing at 18.90 in the finals. Earlier, in the
prelims for the event. Bousquet clocked an
18.74 to set the record. Wildman-Tobriner fin
ished third in the event, touching the wall at
19.27. In the sixth and final event. Stanford fi
nally pulled it together to win the 400-yard
medley relay with the quartet of seniors Gary
Marshall, Jayme Cramer and Matt McDonald
and sophomore Wildman-Tobriner taking a
come-from-behind win to set a pool record of
3:06.45 by over two seconds. At the end of the
day, Stanford was in fourth, following Auburn,
Arizona and Cal.
