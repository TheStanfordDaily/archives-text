### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
ITie Stanford wrestling team's two star
competitors, co-captains Matt Gentry and
Imad Kharbash, fought hard but fell short of
their ultimate goals of individual national ti
tles in St. Louis over a week ago. Despite
going down in the tournament, both wrestlers
can l<K)k back on great seasons for the Cardi
nal (6-7-1.2-5-2 Pacific-10 Conference), and
for Gentry, a senior, a great collegiate career.
After a first-round bye. the 174-pound
Kh;ubush won his first match in a 4-1 decisk>n
over Eastern Illinois' Kenny Robertson.The
junior continued with a 16-7 drubbing of
Northwestern s Jake Herbert in his next bout.
The fourth round would be the beginning
of the end as Kharbush fell 15-4 to Cornell's
Joe Mazzurco. In the consolation bracket,
Kharbush dropped a razor-thin 3-2 decision
to Mitch Hancock of Central Michigan.
"All in all, it was bittersweet." Kharbush
said.
On the second day of competition. Gentry
was matched up against sixth-seeded TVent
Paulson of lowa State. In overtime. Paulson
was able to secure the upset by scoring a take

down fora sudden victory decision, 8-6.
The painfully close defeat ended the se
nior's quest at repeating as national champi
on, and Gentry entered the consolation
bracket to face seventh-seeded Matt Lebe of
West Virginia. The Cardinal co-captain had
another tight battle and once again the match
was deadlocked, this time at three. Lebe
scored a takedown fora 5-3 sudden victory
decision.
"On the second day, I jast had an off day. I
wrestled two guys who I had beaten before,
and I lost to them in overtime. I didn't wrestle
my best, and to win the NCAAs you need to
wrestle at your best."
Gentry ended his collegiate career short

of where he wished, but the 157 pounder will
remain a Cardinal wrestling legend. Gentry
holds the school's all-time and consecutive
wins records.
"I guess some career highlights would be
obviously winning a national title, and being
Pac-10 champion and Pac-10 wrestler of the
year last year," Gentry said. "But other high
lights would be the fight. It's winning the close
matches, |or] fighting in the tough matches
and pulling it out. 1 guess 1 would want my
legacy to be someone who worked hard and
was exciting to watch."
