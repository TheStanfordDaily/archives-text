# Grunfeld having fun on and off the court
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Poring over the words on official Stan
ford letterhead three years ago, Dan
Grunfeld was worried.
The Cardinal's junior shooting guard, a
freshman at the time,didn't know what to
make of the shocking letter hand-deliv
ered to him by his concerned freshman
dorm RA. Grunfeld, the letter indicated,
was suspected of cheating on an I HUM
final exam.
Ten minutes later, a smiling Matt
Haryasz burst into the room and broke the
news to his friend and teammate: the letter
was a sham, authored as a cruel prank by
Haryasz and a friend.
"He got me so bad," Grunfeld said
after practice this week. "It was so official
looking, with a case number and every
thing. I was pretty worried for 10 minutes
there;some expletives may have come out
of my mouth."
Three years lateral's opposing coaches
preparing for Stanford who are worried.
Perhaps they are wondering if Haryasz
will burst into their office to announce
that Grunfeld's gaudy stat line (18.1 points
and 5.5 rebounds per game, 51 percent
shooting) is, like the letter, one big joke.
After all, this is the same guy who aver
aged 3.5 points per game his first two sea
sons at Stanford, the same 6-foot-6 reserve
who shot 36 percent from the field in a lim
ited role last year. Think Grunfeld has
done his part to make up for the loss of the
team's top three leading scorers? In his
first year as a starter for the Cardinal (8-7,
2-3 Pacific-10 Conference),he is averaging
14.7 points per game more than last year,
the best one-year improvement among
Division I players.
Grunfeld's 10-for-12, slashing, swish
ing, do-no-wrong 29-point performance in
Stanford's upset of Arizona two weeks
ago earned him some rare national atten
tion, as "Sports Illustrated" dubbed him
Player of the Week. Truth is, he has pro
duced at a high level all season, scoring in
double figures in all but two games, and his
teammates aren't surprised.
"He's had an opportunity to shine,"
said junior point guard and friend Jason
Haas, who lived with Grunfeld and
Haryasz last year. "Now that he's had his
opportunity to play, he's proven what he
has been able to do all along."
"I knew Danny could be this kind of
player ever since I met him," Haryasz said.
"He's got a great offensive game and he
works really hard. I'm honestly not sur
prised at all."
Least surprised is Grunfeld himself,
who spent the past two years backing up
Matt Lottich after arriving on the Farm as
one of the most highly touted shooters in
the country.
"I think every basketball player has
confidence in their abilities, and at Stan
ford it's just a matter of opportunity and
learning the system, just biding your time
and being patient," Grunfeld said.
Off the court, things are same as they
ever were for Grunfeld, who is living with
Haryasz for the second consecutive year.
Movies, parties, hanging out, a TV rotation
that includes 'The Surreal Life' and 'Real

World' - standard fare for the typical col
lege student. And then there are the
pranks.
"We've done a lot of dumb stuff togeth
er." Grunfeld said with a laugh.
Like the time he and Matt used rope to
lock Jason in the inner room while he was
taking a nap, barricading the first floor
window with bicycles and boxes of bottled
water to prevent an easy escape.
"Danny's the type of guy you can al
ways count on to crack a joke; he's always
making someone laugh," said Haas, who,
perhaps not surprisingly, opted to live
elsewhere this year. "He's very witty, he's
very savvy and he has a nice way with his
words."
As a senior at Nicolet High School near
Milwaukee, Grunfeld averaged 23.9
points per game and teamed up with point
guard Tanner Bronson to form a dominant
backcourt duo. Bronson, whose love for
the game â€” and The Surreal Life' - rivals
Dan's, walked on at Wisconsin this season
after spending last year as the Badgers'
team manager.
"Tanner was the greatest guy," said
Grunfeld, reminiscing about the one-on
one games they would play at Bronson's
house in Milwaukee, where Dan's mother
Nancy grew up and the Grunfelds still
have a residence. "He was a really smart,
good player. He was my boy."
Dan. of course, is Ernie's boy.The elder
Grunfeld enjoyed a decorated college ca
reer at Tennessee before playing for the
Milwaukee Bucks, Kansas City Kings and
New York Knicks during his nine seasons
in the NBA. Grunfeld later worked in the
New York Knicks' front office for 17 years
before he became general manager of the
Bucks in 1999. After four seasons in Mil
waukee, he was named the President of
Basketball Operations for the NBA's
Washington Wizards in 2003.
A die-hard Knicks fan while growing
up in New Jersey. Dan has switched alle
giances with every new place he has called
home. For now that's the D.C. suburb of
Potomac, Md., and Grunfeld beams when
talking about the upstart Wizards, an
anomaly before his dad arrived.
"They have the best backcourt in the
East," Grunfeld said. "You've got guys like
Gilbert [Arenas] and Larry [Hughes] on
the verge of really breaking out, playing
great.Tilings are coming together."
Sound familiar?
Buoyed by strong play from one of the
Pac-10's best backcourts, a modest two
game win streak has put the Cardinal right
back in the thick of a wide-open confer
ence race.
Grunfeld tries not to look too far
ahead, relishing every bit of his time at
Stanford this year just as he did for the
previous two.
"You just have to try to make the most
out of every experience," Grunfeld said. "I
think of my four years in high school and
three years at Stanford so far, and I think
there are a lot of good things to be drawn
out of all those years."
He pauses before adding:
"And a lot of that has come off the floor."
