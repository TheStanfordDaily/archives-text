# Frosh Grube makes it look easy
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
To answer your question, no — it's not
this easy.
Maneuvering a golf hall around some of
the most punishing courses in the country,
from the wind and rain of Oregon to the
greens of California's Pasatiempo Golf Club.
Fighting the finest young players in the land
from tee to green on the weekends while
fighting the onset of sleep in I-Hum lecture
during the week.
Placing a storied Stanford golf program
squarely on your back when you're already
toting around a full academic load and a
backpack jammed with the densest reading
material this side of Webster.
Let's just say it puts winning that $10 Nas
sau at the club last weekend to shame.
But watch Rob Grube and you're bound
to think doing it all is as easy as he makes it
seem.
"(Grube) is a person 1 wish 1 could have re
cruited," first-year coach Conrad Ray said.
"I'm lucky to have him."
Lucky indeed. With a junior resume that
included an American Junior Golf Associa
tion Ail-American honor, a runner-up finish
in the Illinois State Amateur Championship
and a victory at the California State NorCal
Championship, Grube was not short on op
tions for college.
"In your junior year [of high school],
coaches can send you official recruiting let
ters, so you get a mess of letters from every
university, some you didn't even know exist
ed," Grube said. "You kind of open them and
look through them and narrow down your
choices and go on official visits."

Eventually, the field thinned to three
contenders and a battle between East and
West: Stanford vs. the traditional North
Carolina golf powers of Duke and Wake
Forest.
"1 tried to spend my time at Duke and
Wake because 1 didn't know anything
about them," Grube said. "My philosophy
was to look at the schools independent of
the golf programs and figure out where I
would be happiest."
Give the recruiting assist to some well
placed Cardinal alumni. Grube's parents,
John and Ann, are both Stanford graduates,
as is his sister Katie, a lacrosse player and
member of the Class of 2004.
Last but not least. Stanford junior Kyle
Gentry played with Grube for two years at
the Robert Louis Stevenson School in
Carmel, Calif. No pressure.
"Like my dad. Kyle said "1 want you to do
what's best for you,"'Grube said. "Once I said
1 was going to Stanford. 1 told my dad. and he
said' Yes!', and they were really excited.They
were good in terms of letting me decide on
my own. but they definitely wanted me to
come here."
Sophomore Zack Miller, who also found
instant success in his rookie campaign, said a
constant desire for improvement is what his
teammate will need if he wants to continue on
his current path.
"It's a great feeling to come onto the col
lege scene and have a lot of success," Miller
said. "One of the hardest parts is to try to
continue to work hard even when things
are going great. It's easy to take things for
granted."
No problem there.
I low did Grube celebrate a runner-up fin

ish at Stanford's most recent event and his
best performance as a collegian? 1 le called up
his high school swing doctor for some quick
help with a troubled putter that had likely
cost him a chance at his first tournament vic
tory.
"It's an individual sport." Grube said.
"To improve the team, you have to improve
yourself"
With a team-leading stroke average of
72.3, the lowest fora Stanford freshman since
a performance by a guy named Tiger in 1M95,
Grube is certainly holding up his end of the
deal. But this individual sport also involves
four other players from week to week whose
performances he can't control. Or so you
might think.
"Rob is a great leader." sophomore Matt
Savage said. "[He's someone] who pushes
and encourages his teammates to be the
best."
"1 can't say enough about Rob," Ray said.
"Right now he's leading more by example
than anything. That really speaks volumes
among the guys, too. Ihat's really what they
look at when they ask themselves 'Who
should we follow?' or 'Who's leading the
charge for us?"'
When the Cardinal begin postseason play
on Monday at the Pacific-10 Conference
Championship, there will be no guarantees.
Seeing Grube in the lineup and pushing to
ward the top of the leaderboard. however,
may be as close as it gets.
If Grube does in front of the home crowd
what he's been doing all year long, just try to
remember: It's not this easy.
