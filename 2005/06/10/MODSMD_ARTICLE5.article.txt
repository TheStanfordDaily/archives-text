WASHINGTON, D.C. — Declaring President
George W. Bush the victor in the election against Sen.
John Kerry, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card
announced early this morning he was confident that the
president had won Ohio's electoral votes.
Bush left 4,(XX) of his supporters hanging in anticipa
tion last night when he opted not to appear at the Re
publican National Committee's "2(X)4 Victory Celebra
tion" at the Ronald Reagan Building and International

Trade Center. Most television networks' projections left
Bush short of the necessary 270 electoral votes. Some
people, including Sen. Kerry, believe that provisional
ballots and a few remaining districts still uncounted in
Ohio leave the swing state too close to call.
As late as 3 a.m.. Republican National Committee
Chairman Ed Gillespie, who was also chairman of the
festivities for the evening, tried to keep the crowd's en
ergy up,explaining that the remaining votes to be count
ed in Ohio were not likely to totally erase Bush's 123,(XX)
vote lead. Even though there were 120,(XX) provisional

votes that had to be counted, Gillespie
said, a large portion would be discarded.
Still, the crowd of Bush supporters re
mained confident and excited throughout
the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-something
political junkies who showed up to cheer
on Bush's campaign for four more years in
office and to rub elbows with the staffs of
the White House, the RNC and Bush / Ch
eney *04 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final stop to vic
tory is here in the Ronald Reagan Build

ing," said Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.
The stage was draped with a giant
American flag and featured a blue back
drop with white stars that illuminated the
arched ceiling of the building's modern in
terior. Against this setting, tiers of cheering
Bush supporters waved red and blue cylin
drical balloons declaring "GOP Victory."
Frist praised Bush's handling of a num
ber of issues, including the Sept. 11 attacks.
"We didn't run away — we turned and
faced our enemy," he said.
Frist also said the president had a plan to
restore economic growth and noted the tax
cuts Bush enacted all four years in office.
After every point he made, Frist repeat
ed the refrain that "President Bush has not
wavered, and we will win," and the audi
ence chanted "we will win" along with him.

Julia Tierney, a second year graduate
student at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies, said she
is taking more of an interest in the presi
dential election this year than ever before.
"The world is in such an interesting
place," she said. "We're at a turning point
in American history. This election will be a
mandate for more of what [Bush] is doing
or for something different."
As Bush received more and more votes
throughout the evening, the crowd of sup
porters continued to cheer jubilantly.
Deafening shrieks filled the room of
the main stage when FOX News project
ed that Bush would win Ohio.
