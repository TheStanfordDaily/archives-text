# Stanford's aces from two decks
## 
### SEAN HOWELL JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
At the start of their first practice as Stanford
baseball players, juniors Jeff Gilmore and Mark
Romanczuk picked up their gloves and a b;dl and
began to play catch together. Romanczuk was a
highly regarded lefthanded recruit from
Delaware who had been selected in the fifth
round of the MLB draft. Gilmore, a native of
Huntington Beach, Calif, was a righthander over
shadowed by the high expectations swirling
around his other classmates.
Three years later, Gilmore and Romanczuk
have ascended to the top two spots in the Cardinal
rotation. Their paths to success look nothing alike
— a power pitcher. Romanczuk rode the bullet
train to a starting role, while the craftier Gilmore
arrived more quietly. But somehow they both
landed in the same place, with complementing
reputations for reliability and leadership.
Today, when the Cardinal warm up at practice.
Gilmore and Romanczuk still play catch together.
Romanczuk started his Cardinal career with
a bang. He went 12-2 with a 4.01 earned-run av
erage in his rookie season. The performance
earned him one of four National Freshman of
the Year honors.
He started the season in relief posting three
wins and two saves, and was moved into the start
ing rotation early in the year. The first Pacific-10
Conference start of his career was a sign of things
to come: Romanczuk Ux>k the ball against Ari
zona State and spun a complete game, allowing
only two earned runs and picking up a win in a cru
cial rubber game.
When Romanczuk won the first 12 decisions
of his career, it was hard to tell that he wasn't a
veteran.
"In terms of poise. Mark is advanced for his age
and as good as anybody we've had at this stage in
his career," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess
said at the time.
Romanczuk's dream season ended on a sour
note, when he started and lost the final game of the
College World Series to Rice. It was the shortest
outing of his career, a one-inning stint in which he
allowed four runs.The start left a bad taste in Ro
manczuk's mouth,but he didn't have time t<) think
about it. Within days after the season ended, Ro
manczuk was on a plane to play for Team USA.

He had a stellar summer, allowing only three
earned runs in 36 innings for the 27-2 Americans
Gilmore watched his southpaw teammate's
startling breakout year — and just about every
other play of the 2003 season — from the
dugout. Gilmore made only three appearances
in his freshman year fora grand total of 2 1 / 3 in
nings He went to Alaska to play summer base
ball with the frustration of an uneventful year on
his shoulders.
Alaska, as it turned out, was the place where
Gilmore began to transform as a pitcher. In May
2003. Gilmore met former Cardinal and current
New York Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina, who
imparted some wisdom on how to throw his signa
ture knuckle curveball. Gilmore consumed the
advice and began to toss the pitch during his sum
mer outings.
"It brought out a new part of me and that's a
strikeout pitch," Gilmore said. "On a two-strike
count from sophomore year on, I had an option.
Before I had to fool the hitter, I had to trick them."
By the end of the summer, Gilmore had a
1.41 ERA in 32 innings of work for the Mat-Su
Miners. Romanczuk, who was jet-setting with
Team USA at the time, was the least surprised
person in the world.
"Mark allied me one day," Gilmore remem
bered, "And he said i looked at your numbers,
you're throwing great in Alaska. 1 knew you could
do it, keep it up. When you come back, you're
going to be one of our guys.'"
Gilmore added:"We're very different pitches
but we can learn from each other because of that."
Gilmore said the ensuing fall was his most
nerve-wracking time as a member of the Stan
ford team.
"I honestly believed that I had what it takes,"
Gilmore said. "But I had a narrow window of op
portunity to shine and prove myself in the fall."
The coaching staff liked what they saw in fall
workouts and Gilmore was immediately called
upon out of the bullpen in his sophomore season.
By the start of February he had his first collegiate
start and his first collegiate win. The righty never
slowed, collecting a 10-2 record with a 4.43 ERA.
Hie team's Most Improved Player Award was
a no-brainer.
♦♦♦
Romanczuk, meanwhile, carried his stellar
summer form back to the Farm, where he blos

somed into the team's ace in 2004, going 11-3 with
a 4.31 ERA. His numbers were nearly identical to
the ones he posted in 2(X)3. but last year. Ro
manczuk said, he learned how to pitch. I hough his
freshman numbers wouldn't indicate it.he says
that he wits more of "thrower" than a pitcher back
then.
"I've learned more of the finer points of pitch
ing." he said. "For example, how to change speeds
on hitters, how to pitch down in the zone. That's
been one of the keys for me."
I le is still a power pitcher, with a low-90s heater
and a devastating slider that hits helped him tally
249 Ks in his Cardinal career. But Rc>manczuk has
also developed a changeup this year that he uses
to gets easy outs to keep his pitch count dc >wn.
An economics major. Romanczuk is more
analytical than most pitchers you'll meet. Be
fore most of his starts last year, he would pore
over eveiything he knew about each hitter on
the opposing team and try to pitch to their
strengths and weaknesses.
But early this year, his dissection of opp< >sing
lineups got him into trouble at times. He was re
luctant to break from his game plan when things
were not going his w ay.
Recently, his motto has been to simplify. Ro
manczuk lost his Friday night starting spot after al
lowing nine runs in seven innings in a start against
Arizona State on April 15. Since that start. Ro
manczuk says.he has th< >ught about what he needs
to do to get hitters out. not what he could do to
make them get themselves out.
"In my last couple starts. 1 haven't focused so
much on hitters' weaknesses as 1 have on my
strengths," he said."l just learned,' Hey.if 1 put my
best f(X)t forward. I'm going to get guys out. no
matter what their strengths or weaknesses are.'
That's given me a l< >t more ci >n!idence in my stuff.
I'm trying to go with the How and make adjust
ments whenever I need to."
Romanczuk works with pitching coach Tom
Kunis during his mid-week bullpen session,
and they come up with a loose game plan for
Romanczuk to follow in his weekend start. In
some ways, he is going back to what made him
successful during his freshman year, worrying
less about the intricacies of pitching and letting
his competitiveness guide him. Since the Ari
zona State game, he has allowed two runs or
less in four of his five starts and tossed his third
complete game this season.

While Romanczuk has continued to refine
his raw talent, Gilmore continued to uncover
pieces of his. Alter a phenomenal sophomore
season, he went back to Alaska. This time, after
learning that his pitching coach would be Jack
Krawe/.yk. who holds NCAA single-season and
career saves records. Gilmore asked Krawczyk
to show him his circle change-up.
The grip required for the change-up is. in
Gilmore's words, awkward, and difficult to mas
ter — Gilmore only got the pitch working at the
end of fall practices this year. Now. the change,
which is more deceptive and more versatile than
the one Gilmore used previously, is the most ef
fective pitch in his arsenal.
Armed with the enhanced pitch options.
Gilmore settled into his Saturday starting role
like he'd never known the bench, and is current
ly 9-2 (the best record on the staff), with a 3.61
ERA (the best among Stanford starters) and
two complete games.
Gilmore moved into the Friday starting
role for four weeks, though the junior down
plays the shift.

"You can't think about what pitcher you're
facing," Gilmore said."You'll just psych your
self out that way. 1 have to think that I'm fac
ing USC's lineup, and our hitters are facing
IJSC's pitchers, and they're going to do their
best. And if 1 can keep it close. I'll take my
chances with that."
Romanczuk and Gilmore have come a long
way during their three years at Stanford, both to
gether and apart. I 'lhe pair will likely split up alter
this season — Romanc/uk is virtually guaran
teed to be drafted in the first few rounds, and
Gilmore is a good bet to leave as well. I hey will
leave big shoes to lill in the Cardinal rotation,
both in terms of their pitching ability and their
leadership styles.
Before they go. Romanc/uk and Gilmore
will have one last crack at the College World Se
ries, assuming the Cardinal make the playoffs.
In the postseason, it can never hurt to have two
aces in your deck. Especially when they have
such different styles

imparted some wisdom on how to throw his signa
ture knuckle curveball. Gilmore consumed the
advice and began to toss the pitch during his sum
mer outings.
"It brought out a new part of me and that's a
strikeout pitch," Gilmore said. "On a two-strike
count from sophomore year on, I had an option.
Before I had to fool the hitter, I had to trick them."
By the end of the summer, Gilmore had a
1.41 ERA in 32 innings of work for the Mat-Su
Miners. Romanczuk, who was jet-setting with
Team USA at the time, was the least surprised
person in the world.
"Mark allied me one day," Gilmore remem
bered, "And he said i looked at your numbers,
you're throwing great in Alaska. 1 knew you could
do it, keep it up. When you come back, you're
going to be one of our guys.'"
Gilmore added:"We're very different pitches
but we can learn from each other because of that."
Gilmore said the ensuing fall was his most
nerve-wracking time as a member of the Stan
ford team.
"I honestly believed that I had what it takes,"
Gilmore said. "But I had a narrow window of op
portunity to shine and prove myself in the fall."
The coaching staff liked what they saw in fall
workouts and Gilmore was immediately called
upon out of the bullpen in his sophomore season.
By the start of February he had his first collegiate
start and his first collegiate win. The righty never
slowed, collecting a 10-2 record with a 4.43 ERA.
Hie team's Most Improved Player Award was
a no-brainer.
♦♦♦
Romanczuk, meanwhile, carried his stellar
summer form back to the Farm, where he blos

somed into the team's ace in 2004, going 11-3 with
a 4.31 ERA. His numbers were nearly identical to
the ones he posted in 2(X)3. but last year. Ro
manczuk said, he learned how to pitch. I hough his
freshman numbers wouldn't indicate it.he says
that he wits more of "thrower" than a pitcher back
then.
"I've learned more of the finer points of pitch
ing." he said. "For example, how to change speeds
on hitters, how to pitch down in the zone. That's
been one of the keys for me."
I le is still a power pitcher, with a low-90s heater
and a devastating slider that hits helped him tally
249 Ks in his Cardinal career. But Rc>manczuk has
also developed a changeup this year that he uses
to gets easy outs to keep his pitch count dc >wn.
An economics major. Romanczuk is more
analytical than most pitchers you'll meet. Be
fore most of his starts last year, he would pore
over eveiything he knew about each hitter on
the opposing team and try to pitch to their
strengths and weaknesses.
But early this year, his dissection of opp< >sing
lineups got him into trouble at times. He was re
luctant to break from his game plan when things
were not going his w ay.
Recently, his motto has been to simplify. Ro
manczuk lost his Friday night starting spot after al
lowing nine runs in seven innings in a start against
Arizona State on April 15. Since that start. Ro
manczuk says.he has th< >ught about what he needs
to do to get hitters out. not what he could do to
make them get themselves out.
"In my last couple starts. 1 haven't focused so
much on hitters' weaknesses as 1 have on my
strengths," he said."l just learned,' Hey.if 1 put my
best f(X)t forward. I'm going to get guys out. no
matter what their strengths or weaknesses are.'
That's given me a l< >t more ci >n!idence in my stuff.
I'm trying to go with the How and make adjust
ments whenever I need to."
Romanczuk works with pitching coach Tom
Kunis during his mid-week bullpen session,
and they come up with a loose game plan for
Romanczuk to follow in his weekend start. In
some ways, he is going back to what made him
successful during his freshman year, worrying
less about the intricacies of pitching and letting
his competitiveness guide him. Since the Ari
zona State game, he has allowed two runs or
less in four of his five starts and tossed his third
complete game this season.

While Romanczuk has continued to refine
his raw talent, Gilmore continued to uncover
pieces of his. Alter a phenomenal sophomore
season, he went back to Alaska. This time, after
learning that his pitching coach would be Jack
Krawe/.yk. who holds NCAA single-season and
career saves records. Gilmore asked Krawczyk
to show him his circle change-up.
The grip required for the change-up is. in
Gilmore's words, awkward, and difficult to mas
ter — Gilmore only got the pitch working at the
end of fall practices this year. Now. the change,
which is more deceptive and more versatile than
the one Gilmore used previously, is the most ef
fective pitch in his arsenal.
Armed with the enhanced pitch options.
Gilmore settled into his Saturday starting role
like he'd never known the bench, and is current
ly 9-2 (the best record on the staff), with a 3.61
ERA (the best among Stanford starters) and
two complete games.
Gilmore moved into the Friday starting
role for four weeks, though the junior down
plays the shift.

"You can't think about what pitcher you're
facing," Gilmore said."You'll just psych your
self out that way. 1 have to think that I'm fac
ing USC's lineup, and our hitters are facing
IJSC's pitchers, and they're going to do their
best. And if 1 can keep it close. I'll take my
chances with that."
Romanczuk and Gilmore have come a long
way during their three years at Stanford, both to
gether and apart. I 'lhe pair will likely split up alter
this season — Romanc/uk is virtually guaran
teed to be drafted in the first few rounds, and
Gilmore is a good bet to leave as well. I hey will
leave big shoes to lill in the Cardinal rotation,
both in terms of their pitching ability and their
leadership styles.
Before they go. Romanc/uk and Gilmore
will have one last crack at the College World Se
ries, assuming the Cardinal make the playoffs.
In the postseason, it can never hurt to have two
aces in your deck. Especially when they have
such different styles

Senior Mark Romanczuk (left) and junior Jeff Gilmore have different pitching styles but form
one of the better 1 -2 pitching duos in the Pac 10.
At the start of their first practice as Stanford
baseball players, juniors Jeff Gilmore and Mark
Romanczuk picked up their gloves and a b;dl and
began to play catch together. Romanczuk was a
highly regarded lefthanded recruit from
Delaware who had been selected in the fifth
round of the MLB draft. Gilmore, a native of
Huntington Beach, Calif, was a righthander over
shadowed by the high expectations swirling
around his other classmates.
Three years later, Gilmore and Romanczuk
have ascended to the top two spots in the Cardinal
rotation. Their paths to success look nothing alike
— a power pitcher. Romanczuk rode the bullet
train to a starting role, while the craftier Gilmore
arrived more quietly. But somehow they both
landed in the same place, with complementing
reputations for reliability and leadership.
Today, when the Cardinal warm up at practice.
Gilmore and Romanczuk still play catch together.
Romanczuk started his Cardinal career with
a bang. He went 12-2 with a 4.01 earned-run av
erage in his rookie season. The performance
earned him one of four National Freshman of
the Year honors.
He started the season in relief posting three
wins and two saves, and was moved into the start
ing rotation early in the year. The first Pacific-10
Conference start of his career was a sign of things
to come: Romanczuk Ux>k the ball against Ari
zona State and spun a complete game, allowing
only two earned runs and picking up a win in a cru
cial rubber game.
When Romanczuk won the first 12 decisions
of his career, it was hard to tell that he wasn't a
veteran.
"In terms of poise. Mark is advanced for his age
and as good as anybody we've had at this stage in
his career," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess
said at the time.
Romanczuk's dream season ended on a sour
note, when he started and lost the final game of the
College World Series to Rice. It was the shortest
outing of his career, a one-inning stint in which he
allowed four runs.The start left a bad taste in Ro
manczuk's mouth,but he didn't have time t<) think
about it. Within days after the season ended, Ro
manczuk was on a plane to play for Team USA.

He had a stellar summer, allowing only three
earned runs in 36 innings for the 27-2 Americans
Gilmore watched his southpaw teammate's
startling breakout year — and just about every
other play of the 2003 season — from the
dugout. Gilmore made only three appearances
in his freshman year fora grand total of 2 1 / 3 in
nings He went to Alaska to play summer base
ball with the frustration of an uneventful year on
his shoulders.
Alaska, as it turned out, was the place where
Gilmore began to transform as a pitcher. In May
2003. Gilmore met former Cardinal and current
New York Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina, who
imparted some wisdom on how to throw his signa
ture knuckle curveball. Gilmore consumed the
advice and began to toss the pitch during his sum
mer outings.
