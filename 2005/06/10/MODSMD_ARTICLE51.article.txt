## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's track and field
team captured its first ever Pacific-10 Con
ference title last weekend, breaking
UCLA's eight-year reign at its own stadi
um. The Cardinal left favorites UCLA,
Southern California and Arizona State in
the dust, scoring 173 points to the runner
up Bruins' 125.
The men had a solid effort as well, plac
ing sixth in the team standings with 66
points. Oregon won the men's team com
petition with 152 points.
"I'm extremely happy with the results of
the women," men's head coach Robert
Weir said. "The programs together support
each other very, very well, and to have one
of the teams be successful is always a great
thing. I couldn't be happier for the
women's team and for the head coach."
"I think we competed well," said head
coach Edrick Floreal, who has been at the
Farm coaching the sprinters and jumpers,
as well as serving as the women's coach,
for five years. "A lot of people stepped up
and did a great job. Something like 21 of
the girls scored within the top five and if
you do that it's going to be hard for any
one to stop you."
The Cardinal women said they used the
meet's setting to their advantage.
"It was a motivating factor," Floreal
said. "We weren't the favorites, so it was a
lot easier to win. and there wasn't a better
place for people to be competitive."
On Saturday, Senior Alicia Craig and

freshman Erica McLain began the
women's weekend of domination, with vic
tories in the 10,000-meter run and the long
jump, respectively.
"Alicia had to run by herself," Floreal
said. "But she had to get the performance
done to get qualified for nationals, so she
just kicked it off from the beginning and
ran exactly the pace she had to do. But then
again, she is such a stud we just expect that
from her."
Craig finished in 34:02.79, more than a
minute ahead of second-place finisher Vic
toria Jackson of Arizona State, who fin
ished in 35:24.43. Freshmen Lindsay Flacks
and Katie Harrington finished third and
fifth, respectively. Flacks' time of 35:30.82
was the fifth-best freshman 10,000-meter
mark in school history.
McLain's win in the long jump was a
meet upset in addition to being a freshman
school record, the second-best mark in
school history and a Regional qualifying
mark. McLain jumped 21'2.5", well ahead
of runner-up and favorite Candice
Baucham of UCLA, who jumped 20'7.75".
The Cardinal tallied 21 points in the
3,000-meter steeplechase with second,
third, fifth and sixth place finishes. Sopho
more Katy Trotter finished in 10:24.71,
while senior Jeane Goff took third in
10:29.53. Freshman Lindsay Allen's per
formance earned a fifth-place finish in
10:31.99.
