# Harris comes to Farm

### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After making the difficult but
necessary decision to fire Buddy
Teevens on Nov. 29, Stanford Ath
letics Director Dr. Ted Leland
knew exactly what he wanted in the
Cardinal's next head football coach
â€” experience.
Enter Walt Harris, who was hired
Dec. 13 and officially began his
tenure at Stanford yesterday.
"Other than Bill Walsh, Walt is
the most experienced and successful
head football coach that Stanford
has hired since Pop Warner in 1924,"
Leland said. "He has done a fantastic
job at the University of Pittsburgh
for the past eight years, turning their
program into one of the nation's
perennial bowl contenders. He is a
man of high integrity and character,
and we welcome him into the Stan
ford community."
Harris, 58, is a South San Francis
co native who, in his eight seasons
with Pittsburgh, took the No. 19 Pan
thers to a Bowl Championship Se
ries game this year. He grew up in
the shadow of Stanford's unique
football program, and the bespecta
cled man with a creative mind has
shown throughout his career that he
can recruit talented players under
circumstances that are somewhat
less than ideal. He has a 63-67 life
time record, including a 39-23 mark
over his past six seasons, and he says
he's ready for the unique challenge
that Stanford offers.

"It's a huge responsibility to be
the head football coach at such a
tremendous academic institution,"
Harris said. "Our job as coaches is to
do the whole thing. It's not just about
athletics and winning champi
onships, but molding the whole stu
dent-athlete. "There's not one
person I talked to that can't sing the
praises of this university, and I'm
honored to be a part of that. I could
n't be more thrilled to represent
Stanford University like so many
great coaches have in the past."
Harris comes with his own band
of praise-singers, including Jon
Gruden, who has won a Super Bowl
as coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and got his start when
Harris hired him as a graduate as
sistant at Tennessee.
"I consider Walt Harris as good a
coach as there is in America," Gru
den said. "His track record with
quarterbacks, receivers and offen
sive football teams is unprecedent
ed, and his winning percentage at
Pitt speaks for itself. Walt is a class
act and Stanford should be proud to
have him."
Harris, who is under contract for
the next five years, inherits a work
able if not wonderful situation. Stan
ford went just 10-23 over the past
three seasons, but the players worked
hard underTeevens, a strong recruiter
who left behind a talented roster.
