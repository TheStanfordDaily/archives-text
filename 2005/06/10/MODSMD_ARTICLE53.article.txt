Stanford history to record more than 5,000

assists With a career total of 5,036 assists,
Hansen will leave the Cardinal as the third
best setter in school history.
In game one of the match, Vogel put
away two consecutive kills to bring the Car

the game at 6-6. Northridge responded by
jumping to a 15-9 lead. The Matadors
pulled ahead by eight at 27-19 and ulti
mately winning 30-23.
With the match tied 1-1, Northridge

game four, again keeping the score tied at
9-9. But the Matadors turned up the heat
and sailed to a 30-19 victory, closing out the
match.
"It's tough to end on a sour note, but
our team has a lot to be proud of," Shaw
said. "Making the playoffs was an im
provement from last year, and the guys
worked hard day in and day out. I'm proud
of them."
