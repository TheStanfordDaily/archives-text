### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Double team titles. Double individual titles.
This is becoming routine for the Stanford
cross country teams.
On Saturday, the top-ranked women's team
and the No. 2 men's squad raced to victory once
again at West Regionals in Fresno, Calif, at Wood
ward Park. Leading the Cardinal to victory, sen
iors Alicia Craig and Ryan Hall placed first in
each of their respective divisions.
Saturday's victory was the sixth straight title
for the women and marked the ninth consecutive
season in which the Stanford men have nabbed
the top finish at West Regionals.
The women competed in the 6,000-meter race
and finished ahead of 27 other teams, while Ari
zona State placed second. The Sun Devils took
second in the men's division as well.
The top two teams in each of nine regions
qualify for NCAAs, so both Stanford and Ari
zona State earned spots at the meet to be held
next week.Thirteen other teams will also earn at
large berths to the Championships.
Not only did Craig set the pace for the Stan
ford women, she also claimed her third consecu
tive Regionals title. At the Pac-10 Champi
onships held earlier this month, she came in sec
ond to Arizona State's Amy Hastings; however,
this weekend, Craig managed to finish the race 11
seconds ahead of her.
In the 2003 West Regionals, Craig outran sev
eral of her teammates, including seniors Sara Bei,
Jeane Goff and Anita Siraki, on her way to first
place; in 2002, Craig broke the 6,000-meter course
record with a time of 20 minutes and 39 seconds.
The men's team showed equally impressive
strength.
Although Hall did not participate in the ear
lier meets of this season, he has more than
made up for lost time. Arizona's Robert
Cheseret, last year's Pac-10 Newcomer of the
Year, barely edged out Hall two weeks ago at
the Pac-10 Championships in the 8,000-meter
race. However, just like Craig turned the tables
on Hastings, Hall learned from his previous
race and defeated Cheseret and 149 other run
ners. In Saturday's 10,000-meter race, the Stan
ford senior cruised through the finish line, plac
ing a five second margin between himself and
Cheseret.
