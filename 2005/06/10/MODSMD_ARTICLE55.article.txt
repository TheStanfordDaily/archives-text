# Water polo loses to UCLA
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR STAFF WRITER 
It seemed as if the championship matchup
between No. 2 Stanford and top-ranked
UCLA would never end.
But after a regulation and an overtime bat
tle. the clock ran down too fast for the Cardinal
to score just once more. And now, one month
later, the NCAA trophy belongs to the Bruins.
When a shot from UCLA's Josh Hewko
bounced off the top bar, teammate Logan Pow
ell was there for one more play.
"We had three players ejected and I was the
next guy in line to play," Powell said. "I was in
the right place at the right time."
With 13 seconds left in overtime play. Pow
ell's shot got tipped, touched a couple hands
and ultimately managed to go in.
A stunned Cardinal team had to watch
its opponent celebrate a national champi
onship at Stanford's home pool for the sec
ond year in a row.
One night after defeating Loyola Mary
mount, Stanford faced UC 1 .A for the fifth time
this season. With the season series split, and a
crowd of 3,044 on hand, the NCAA final was
the perfect stage for one last match.
Stanford took the lead in the first period,3-
2, but by the end of the half the Bruins had
come back to post a 4-5 goal advantage. Their
one-goal lead held up through the end of the
third
While there was plenty hack-and-forth ac
tion the first three periods, the match really

heated up in the fourth.
UCLA's 2004 Olympian Brett Ormsby
opened up the final quarter with a goal but jun
ior driver Peter Varellas pulled the Cardinal
within one.
Azevedo finally posted his first and only
goal of the night to tie the game at 7-7, but reg
ulation time ran out before either team could
notch a game-winner.
As the players lined up for overtime, the
Cardinal urged the boisterous crowd to
make noise.
With the support of the spectators, the Stan
ford squad took advantage of the absence of
three Bruin players who had fouled out - Ja
cobs. Chris Pulido and Albert Garcia, who
scored twice in the match. A shot by Hopkins
skipped in for the lead. Ormsby, however, fol
lowed up with his second goal and the match
was tied again. With 1:54 in the second pe
riod of overtime, Hopkins passed across the
pool to Varellas, who shot the ball cross-cage
for his third goal.
The Bruins answered less than a minute
later to tie it up again at 9-9.
The Bruins' game plan seemed to be to dou
ble or triple-team Azevedo. But even when left
alone though, the three-time Player of the Year
struggled with his shots.
"The ball wouldn't go in the goal today."
Azevedo said. "A lot of my shots weren't going
where I wanted them to go."
