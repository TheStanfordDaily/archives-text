# Women fall short

### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I can't wait for next year" was like
ly the thought running through the head
of every Stanford gymnast after the No.
16 Cardinal (4-8,4-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) failed to qualify to NCAA Na
tionals this past weekend.
The team needed to place second at
the West Regional on Saturday in order
to qualify, but it placed fourth with a
194.75 behind No. 2 UCLA,No. 11 Penn
State and No. 24 Washington. With help
from its three Olympians, UCLA fin
ished well ahead of the pack with a
197.025. Only 0.625, however, separated
the Cardinal from second place and
what would have been a five-year
streak of qualifying to Nationals.
"The beauty of it, though, is that the
entire squad returns next year and three
great incoming freshmen have signed
letters of intent," head coach Kristen
Smyth said. "We'll get this team healthy
and the future looks very bright."
The future of this season still looks
bright forTabitha Yim, one of the team's
six freshmen. The fourth-place finisher
at Olympic trials secured herself an in
dividual bid to compete in the All-
Around at Nationals in Alabama from
April 21 to 23. She earned her spot by
having one of the top two All-Around
scores excluding those posted by gym
nasts on qualifying teams.

Yim scored a 39.25 in her debut as an
All-Around competitor for the Cardi
nal, putting her in fifth place at Region
al behind competitors from UCLA
and Penn State. She will enter Nationals
as the top-seeded individual qualifier
and has a good chance to make a mark
on the podium on beam and bars.
"It was unbelievable to see Tab per
form as well as she did in her first time
competing All-Around in college,"
Smyth said. "Her comeback [from a
pre-season injury] was absolutely in
spiring."
At the beginning of the season, how
ever, no one would have guessed that
Yim would be competing alone at Na
tionals. With a preseason rank of No. 3,
a third-place finish at Nationals last
year, and two freshmen coming off top
-10 finishes at Olympic trials, the team's
sights were set on a national champi
onship. The thought of failing to qualify
for nationals was hardly on the radar
screen.
Injuries changed all that.
Freshmen LizTricase and Stephanie
Gentry, along with junior All-American
Glyn Sweets, three of the team's best
competitors, stood on the sidelines at
Regionals due to respective ankle, toe
and foot injures.
