One way to put an end to a dynasty is to start your own.
TTiis mindset was carried out to perfection by Stanford's
synchronized swimming team, which took the reins of
their fate and rode to victory at the 2005 United States
Collegiate Championships, held at the University of
Florida from March 24 to 26. The triumph marked the
first time in six years that Ohio State did not win the title
and the first time since I WW that Stanford emerged from
the competition at the top.
"We went into this meet focusing on what we had con
trol overourselves," Cardinal sophomore Samantha Bon
giovanni-Duclos said."l think our enthusiasm at the meet
showed the judges and other athletes how prepared we
were."
After a rough first day of preliminary competition, Stan
ford was trailing Ohio State. However, beginning on day
two, the Cardinal proceeded to sweep the top spot in every

finals competition, taking at least two of the top three
scores in all hut one event.
"This year, we didn't let [the early deficit] get to us,"sen
ior captain Katie Norris said. "We knew we were the best
and the meet wasn't over until it was truly over."
On Friday, the Cardinal athletes kicked into gear and
took the top four spots in both the A elements and B figures
events, with impressive scores coming from all classes. Katie
Norris took the top spot in A elements, scoring an 82.4. Fol
lowing closely behind were sophomore Elizabeth-Anne
Markman, freshman Sara Lowe and
Bongiovanni-Duclos, who took the second, third and
fourth spots, respectively. Freshmen Courtenay Stewart
and Poppy Carlig also competed in the event, finishing sixth
and ninth in the finals, respectively.
As Saturday competition kicked off, Stanford showed
no signs of losing any of the momentum created by the
previous day's performances, capturing the first and
third spots in the trio finals. The trio of Bongiovanni-
Duclos, Stewart and Lowe won the event with a score of

97.000, while the team composed of Carlig, junior Cas
sidy Ramage and freshman Melissa Knight took home
the bronze medal. In the duet finals, Stewart and Lowe
combined to receive a score of 97.300, good enough to
edge Ohio State's top duo by one-tenth of a point. Katie
Norris and Bongiovanni-Duclos finished a close third,
scoring 97.000 points.
Norris was not yet done for the day, however, as she cap
tured the gold medal in her individual swim in the solo fi
nals, defeating second-place finisher Becky Kim of Ohio
State by over one point.
In the final point tally, Stanford took the top spot with
98.2, followed by Ohio State, which finished with 90 points,
significantly distancing the two schools from the rest of the
field. The third-place finish went to the University of the In
carnate World, which finished with 67.5 points, and the top
five was rounded out with the University of Alabama-
Birmingham and Canisius College.
