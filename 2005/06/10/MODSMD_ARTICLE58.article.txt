# Card defeat Colin tide game
## Lacrosse wins MPSF 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
The season hung in the balance for the
women's lacrosse team last night. This time,
though, there were no shots to block, no cuts
to make, no opponents to guard. No team
mates beckoned fora pass, no coaches drew
up a play. This time, all the team could do was
wait and hope.
Finally, College Sports Television aired the
announcement. Despite winning the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament
this past weekend on the heels of a seven
game winning streak. No. 19 Stanford (13-5,
7-0) did not qualify for the 16-team NCAA
tournament field. The news, which draws the
Cardinal's season to a close, dampened an
otherwise glorious weekend for Stanford
lacrosse.
"It's definitely disappointing because mak
ing the tournament has been a goal of mine
ever since I've been here," senior midfielder
Nina Pantano said. "We're bummed, but
super-excited for our program's future. The
day we make it is going to be great."
Pantano also took solace in the fact that
qualifying for the NCAA tournament is much
more difficult for Stanford, as the MPSF is
one of the few conferences whose champion
does not receive an automatic bid.
"The system is kind of complicated with all
the automatic qualifiers," Pantano said. "For
example, Colgate is in and we played and beat
them. I think that our league doesn't get the
automatic qualifier sort of lessens the blow. It
makes it much harder for us. We know there
are teams in there we could beat."
The pain of missing the NCAAs sharply
contrasts with the joy the Cardinal experi
enced just a day earlier, while winning the
MPSF championships in Moraga, Calif. The
Cardinal capped their tournament run with a
12-9 defeat of California in the title game,
avenging Cal's 11-10 victory in last year's
MPSF final.
"It's always great to beat Cal," Pantano
said. "We were out for revenge from last sea
son, when they beat us in the last six seconds.
I think what was especially great is that we
had the lead the entire time. We truly played
the whole 60 minutes and never let up."
