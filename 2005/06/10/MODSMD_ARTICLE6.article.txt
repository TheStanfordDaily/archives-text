# Krasner takes place at State
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite his wife's repeated requests that he
purchase a cell phone. Political Science Prof.
Stephen Krasner has refused. He has said that
he is content with his landline phones, in his of
fice and at home, and his e-mail.
But it is hard to imagine that he can con
tinue to live his increasingly busy life with
out one.
Newly-confirmed Secretary of State and
former University Provost Condoleezza
Rice has named Krasner, her long-time
friend and colleague, as the incoming direc
tor of Policy Planning at the State Depart
ment. Today, Krasner will assume his new
post, a position equivalent in rank to an assis
tant secretary of state, according to the State
Department Website.
"Steve's scholarship in international rela
tions and his analytical prowess are well
matched to the job of director of Policy Plan
ning." said University President John Hen
nessy. "I believe his experience and insight
will help shed light on some of the seeming
ly intractable international situations faced
by the Unites States and other nations."
A State Department spokesman said he
could not comment on the appointment until
it becomes official.
One of the country's most renowned
scholars in international relations, Krasner.
turning 63 next month, served as the deputy
director of the Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies (SIIS) and headed the Cen
ter on Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law.
Past directors of Policy Planning include

influential statesmen such as George Ken
nan, author of the containment policy to
ward the former Soviet Union; Paul Nitze, a
crucial player in the U.S. Cold War strategy
and nuclear weapon policies; and Paul Wol
fowitz, the chief architect of the U.S. policy
toward Iraq.
The appointment did not come as a sur
prise, especially to faculty members familiar
with Krasner.
"As soon as I knew Condi Rice would be
come the next Secretary of State, I surmised
she might name Steve to that position, be
cause it was such a logical step." said Political
Science Prof. Larry Diamond, coordinator of
the Democracy Program at the CDDRL,
who has known Krasner for more than a
decade. "He and Condi have been close
friends and they tend to view the world in
largely similar ways."
Krasner said that when Rice asked him to
accept the position, he immediately agreed.
"Leaving Stanford is always difficult,"
Krasner said. "But at the same time, it is an
opportunity that I just cannot turn down."
In his new role, Krasner will lead a State
Department division known as the Policy
Planning Staff -the internal think tank that
carries out policy analysis and offers ad
vice to the secretary. According to the de
partment's Web site, the mission of the Pol
icy Planning Staff is "to take a longer term,
strategic view of global trends and frame
recommendations for the Secretary of
State to advance U.S. interests and Ameri
can values."
