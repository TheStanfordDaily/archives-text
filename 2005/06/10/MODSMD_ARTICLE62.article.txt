I walked into the Daily office as a fresh
man knowing I had no chance of surpassing
the legacy of my great-grandfather, Ben S.
Allen, who 99 years ago was Editor-in-Chief
of what was then calledThe Daily Palo Alto.
As I prepare to graduate, I'd like to tell his
story.
On January 30, 1906, my great-grandfa
ther, a senior at the time, ran an editorial
challenging the accuracy of a recently pub
lished account in the alumni magazine re
garding the inappropriate behavior of the
male students who lived in Encina 1 lall.The
final two sentences suggested that the stu
dents consulted as sources were not repre
sentative of the dorm â€” they were resi
dents who were paid to be proctors by the
University
While the editorial was hardly scathing
by today's standards, the backlash from
University President David Starr Jordan
was brutal. The banner headline on the
February 5 issue of The Daily was: BI N s
ALLEN IS SUSPENDED BY STU
DENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.The en
tire front page was devoted to the story of
my great-grandfather's involuntary depar
ture from the post of Editor-in-Chief and,
more significantly, from the University it
self. President Jordan was willing to let my
great-grandfather stay as a student (but
not continue as Editor-in-Chief) if he
would collect signatures from the resi
dents of Encina who were opposed to the
abolition of tubbing (a form of hazing that
entailed holding a freshman's head under
water until he gasped for air) and either
promised to leave the dorm or to "desist in
this behavior". My great-grandfather did
n't bite, and in his letter to the Executive
Committee of Associated Students resign
ing from his position of Editor-in-Chief, he
described the deal as "submitting to a
shameful condition, the very suggestion of
which was wholly unworthy of the men
who offered it."
In a double-bordered box above the

fold. The Daily reproduced the letter from
the Chairman of the Committee on Student
Affairs, R.L. Green, addressed to my great
grandfather informing him of his suspen
sion. In part, it read:
"I"he natural effect of the editorial is in
creased opposition and obstruction to the
efforts of the Committee to prevent hazing
and 'tubbing' in Encina Hall; and its natural
effect has also been to create unjust preju
dice and personal antagonism against men
for assisting in the effort to preserve order
and personal rights in the Hall."
iiie Daily staff passed and printed a res
olution in support of my great-grandfather,
the last of the 14 names printed beneath it is
Miss DC. French, the older sister of Victo
ria Rose French, who my great-grandfather
would marry in 1909.
My great-grandfather returned in the
fall and graduated in 1907. A condition of
his returning was that he not take part in
any extracurricular activities, including
The Daily. According to my grandfather,
my great-grandfather never held a grudge
against President Jordan, who continued
to correspond with him long after gradua
tion. One letter from Jordan commended
my great-grandfather on the quality of the
Sacramento Union, of which he was edi
tor and publisher fora period after World
War I.
My great-grandfather never lost his love
for Stanford and spent most of his adult life
living only a few blocks away from campus
near the corner of Embarcadero Avenue
and Emerson Street. Four of his sons at
tended Stanford, as did two of his grandchil
dren. I'm the first of the fourth generation,
but my younger cousins indicate that I may
not be the last.
As the Editor-in-Chief pro tem wrote on
the day the story broke, "B.S. Allen leaves
Stanford with the respect of the student
body, and it is certain that his name will live
long in Stanford history."
For 99 years and counting.
