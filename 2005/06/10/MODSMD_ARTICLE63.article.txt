## Waterpolo still hottest team on campus 
### 
Ibere, I finally achieved my year-long goal
of inserting that into the paper. As a sports ed
itor, I was constantly asking the EIC if I could
please run that headline and I was consistent
ly — as Clueless's Cher would say — "brutal
ly rebuffed." I look at this column as a way of
paying me back for all the things 1 ever want
ed to say in The Daily but couldn't. Oh, and
also, as a way of letting me blabber on without
much point (which is what I think most
columns do anyway. Booyah!)
I came to liie Daily as a wee sophomore.
Still on the e-mail list of what my mother liked
to term the "Spirit and Booster Club" (and
what you will refer to as Axe Comm), I re
ceived a note soliciting interested parties to
pick up a sports beat that fall. I agreed, and
was soon writing for crew and sailing. From
there, I picked up "bigger" sports, such as
women's lacrosse and men's volleyball, be
fore graduating to a nightly editor position. If
you are either of my parents, you cared about
that paragraph. Actually. I could probably
pick lint out of my bellybutton and you'd care.
St) thanks for that. Mom and Dad. And while
we're on it. thanks for reading all my articles,
too.
But if you aren't an Ashton parent. I apol
ogize for the tour de vie. Instead of prattling
on about minutia that may not interest you.
I'd like to give a non Daily-insider a list of
truths about The Daily.
Compliments: are the best gifts a reader
can give to a writer. For my first story, I wrote
a 40-incher feature (which just essentially
means "long as hell," especially fora starting
reporter) on how crew teams were recruiting
new members. The article is still encased in
glass at the Ford Center, and I enjoy staring at
it while I sweat off my Mickey's on the stair
master. But better than that was getting an e
mail from the coach thanking me for not talk
ing about how beautiful the scenic aspect of
rowing is, but for concentrating on the sport it
self. Or that time someone's dad wrote in and
thanked me for actually covering his daugh
ter's sport. This sounds ridiculous, but it is

huge. I haven't been so happy since the Chap
pie threw us a surprise party that included
large parachute light-up turkey. Hot.
Jules the Penguin: is to The Daily as Tree is
to LSJUMB. Except when Jules dances, he
tries to mix it up a little. You know, like not just
spin in circles all the time.
Hate Mail: is awkward. Especially in an
arena like sports, where that little bugger
called "opinion" rarely rears its beautiful,
beautiful head. Teams with painfully losing
records write in to say that we are covering
them negatively; players who lose matches
that they are expected to win become oddly
hostile when we say as much. It is one thing to
offer political commentary and run into some
opposition, but it is just WEIRD to get called
out for making basic observations.
Headlines: are pretty much the most diffi
cult thing to come up with on God's green
earth. Next time you pick up the paper, read
an article and then try to come up with an in
teresting headline that contains verbs, is spe
cific to the story, and fits within a four inch
space. Failed headlines I have had to change at
the last minute include, but are not limited to:
"Stanford Drowns Cal, 12-3;" "We Still Rule
at Running;" "Screw This, I Wanna Go
Home;" "Volleyball Pounds UCSD;" "Cal
Finds Stanford Basketball UnßEAßable;"
"Swimmers Make Waves at UCLA;" "Oh,
But Stanford Football is le Tired;" and, of
course: "Water Polo Still Hottest Team on
Campus." Yeah. I can't believe I get paid for
this crap, either.
Perspective: is something all of us could
use. I hear a lot of people complain about the
inadequacy ofThe Daily — misspellings, poor
fact-checking, lose-canon opinion columnists.
Sometimes, I agree with them. We do make
mistakes, and we are constantly trying to im
prove. But as a sports writer and editor, I've
helped document the accomplishments of
hundreds of athletes whose primary responsi
bility — just like Daily folk — is school. Daily
writers and editors deal with being a student
and then show up to a small room with sever

al broken computers to pound out a daily
paper for eight hours. Articles arrive late, a
story breaks at 11 p.m..scanners shut down —
but the world keeps turning, and deadline ap
proacheth. These are not excuses; they are
facts. We don't fault our sports teams for fail
ing to play like professionals because they
aren't. When they lose a game, 1 would hope
we cheer a little louder at the next one. Or fire
the coach. So,ok, maybe the analogy isn't per
fect. And criticism will only make us stronger.
But I don't think The Daily is having a losing
season, so maybe we should get a little per
spective and appreciate what goes into a
product of this magnitude. After all, we don't
even get free Nike gear.
Friendships: are the best part. My room
mates will tell you that watching "The OC"
makes me cry,so 1 guess I'm not kidding about
my sentimentality on this one. Why.Trey, why?
The world was your oyster, and you threw it
all away.
I came to The Daily terrified at first, only
stopping in between 4 and 5 p.m. to copyedit a
story and then get the heck out of dodge. But
once I learned to linger a while, I was reward
ed not only by an improved attention to detail
and an increased love of language and com
munication, but I was also welcomed by a host
of great people whom 1 now call great friends.
Will Oremus never got frustrated with my in
ability to remember the size of a drop cap.
David Herbert played indoor basketball with
me, even when he had three more articles left
to write. Cynthia Cho somehow tolerated the
good-natured ribbing of her underlings, like
the frattish yet endearingly goofy Brendan
Selbv. Jennie Kim has been a Daily phenom
ever since she was popping out columns to e
mail home from our tiny room in Oxford. And
Scott Shannon Allen didn't even make me
pay when 1 lost the Duke / Maryland bet.
These people, and so many others, are kind,
brilliant and so giving of their time and ener
gy. They have made my experience at The
Daily one of my very best Stanford memories
— and 1 have a lot of those.
