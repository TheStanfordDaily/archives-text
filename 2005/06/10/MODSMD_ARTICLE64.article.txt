## Bye-bye Stanford University 
### 
It's been four years, and unlike some of my
contemporaries, I'm not surprised: it's time to
go.
Iliere's a lot that can be said fora place like
Stanford. One of my favorites is that this place
sucks out your soul. It's also a place where I've
met amazing people — probably some of the
most amazing people I'll ever meet in my life.
It's a place where people come to make lots of
money; and many others come to make almost
none cleaning up after them.
If there's one thing I've learned at Stanford,
it's that there's never just one side to any story,
regardless of how convenient that would be. I've
met a lot of pretentious people at this school.
And while many of them were really smart, lots
of them also just had a few big words and were
good at pretending.
I'm ready to go. and that's the truth. Four
years here has taught me a lot about myself,
about institutions, about a litany of subjects, but
mostly 1 just learned about people. Professors,
administrators, students, geniuses — they're all
just people.
I worked in an academic department for
three years and heard professors giving advice
to each other on how to bullshit to their stu
dents. I've heard plenty of students confer in a
similar manner on how to bullshit to their pro
fessors. In the same department I've watched
professors for whom I've worked for these three
years not recognize me after being in the office
three days a week, while others have been sup
portive and taken an active interest in my life.
I 've also witnesses the growth and the regres
sion of my peers. I have watched as some people
I admire grow into amazing individuals who will

undoubtedly do amazing tilings and give me
ample stories to tell the rest of my life. I have
also watched as people 1 had hope in turned into
self-centered, immature individuals who had
difficulty seeing past their own immediate
needs.
I have a lot of bad things to say about Stan
ford University. Honestly, I was never as happy
here as I was anywhere else. I don't like the self
praising, individualistic, blinder-like mentality
at an institution that spends so much time talk
ing about how great it is. Being submerged in
this culture almost drowned me sometimes.
I have a lot of good things to say about Stan
ford, too. I'm very grateful for the financial aid
that allowed me to come and get such an out
standing education. I would not be the person I
am were it not for the generous donations of
alumni who allowed me to grow professionally,
and by the same token,as a person. I've learned
a lot from books, but in the process, I learned a
lot about myself.
I'm exhilarated to be graduating from Stan
ford and not having to come back fora long
time. But while I don't want to come back. I
hope to assist in recruiting efforts that will help
other students find their own paradise in a place
that was sometimes my hell.
To me, Stanford and my experience here is
like a relationship with another human being:
there's so much to like, and so much to forgive.
But despite Stanford's and my flaws, thannks
Stanford — for everything.
