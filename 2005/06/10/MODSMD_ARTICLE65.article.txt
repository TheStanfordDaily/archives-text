## Jen's call to arms 
### 
Relevance. A newspaper is nothing without it, and after
four years of working at The Daily — including two years
spent working too much at The Daily— I've realized it was
the feeling of relevance that kept me coming back. When
working at The Daily, you feel that the six or eight or 10 sto
ries that the paper will print the next day are essential infor
mation for everyone to read, and the hours you spend in the
Storke Publication Building are easily rationalized by the be
lief that you are uncovering, analyzing and reporting on issues
indispensable to Stanford and Stanford students.
It's a little bit disheartening, then, when you take a break
from the paper and watch its role in your day-to-day life grad
ually wane — crushing any delusions that The Daily is the
most relevant piece of paper on Stanford campus. After
spending my first two years at The Daily too much, 1 spent my
final two as a columnist, giving me the chance to generally ex
perience the Daily like most other Stanford students. My find
ings were disconcerting. I wouldn't read the paper everyday;
days I did read it. I'd rarely finish the articles; and though 1
swore by the need for in-depth investigative pieces as an edi
tor, they didn't get much of my attention as a reader.
This is bad news for The Daily, but should remind future
writers and editors of the torch the seniors on these pages
are leaving behind for them to carry on — the job of contin
uing to make The Daily relevant and essential to Stanford
students and beyond. I've enjoyed working at The Daily for
a host of reasons — ranging from playing HORSE with a
stuffed penguin to the biannual banquets to the below-min
imum-wage pay and Ink Bowl glory. But the number one
reason was the quality of conversation and company that
could be found in The Daily's office. It became a place to
discuss ethics, how the world related to Stanford, how Stan
ford related to the world and everything inbetween. As ed
itors and writers we poked and prodded at stories until we
understood their significance, had considered the implica
tions of printing them and were able to back up our asser
tions to a tough audience of fellow editors. In this environ

ment, even the seemingly smallest piece of Stanford news is
placed in a broad context that makes it feel essential and in
teresting.
The Daily's writers and editors are lucky to be able to be a
part of such a stimulating environment — but of course, the
purpose of a newspaper with a distribution of more than
I (),()()() people does not stop at personal enrichment. As an in
dividual. I found it hard to begrudge late nights at the office
when they were spent engaged in thoughtful debate. But as an
editor. I always hoped that each morning The Daily would
convey the excitement, complexity and relevance of these
newsroom discussions to readers, making the paper as stimu
lating for them to read as it was for us to produce.
Removed from the biasing influence of the newsroom, and
with the clarity of hindsight, I don't think The Daily has ac
complished this as well as 1 thought it did two years ago. This
is not meant primarily as a criticism however, but more as a
call to arms - whatever that means fora college newspaper.
Volume after volume, the paper's successive editors stress the
same theme: improvement. At Stanford we like to deride our
East Coast counterparts, but ask a Daily staffer and you can
probably get them to admit that the only thing about these
schools they are envious of is the quality of their newspapers.
So, to the future editors and writers of The Daily, I'll say
farewell with the following words: For the last four years, the
seniors on these pages have worked, in one way or another, to
improve The Daily by making it more compelling to students.
In your remaining time, pick up where we've all left off with
the goal of making the paper as exciting and relevant to your
readers in the morning as it was to you the night before in the
newsroom. It's not easy to distill the nuance of an hour-long
newsroom conversation into a 15-inch story, but it's a goal well
worth striving for.
My fondest shout-outs to Scoop McScooperstein, the trials
and tribulations of the labor and ASSU beats, emasculating
nicknames. News > Sports, the epic Iraq series and, of course,
the war issue.
