# Neil Davis
## A 						resurgence that would never come 
### 
For those keeping score at home, this col
umn started with an investigatory piece about
the sorry state of baseball in Montreal. After
submitting his original column to the desk of
Ms. Jessica Peters on,or around September 29.
2(MW. Neil Davis was offered an indecent pro
posal: "We will pay you (what Davis would
later discover to be a very meager wage), in ad
dition to allowing you to have your very own
soapbox."
Like a young buck caught by the headlights
of future success, Davis eagerly accepted the
offer.
For Pac-10 800m Champion. Justin Roma
niuk. Davis' original article was "exactly the
kind of piece that I'd expect to see in ITie Daily.
It's based in a real story, diverges into ripping
on Canada, throws in some Alanis quotes and
then collectively brings a nation to its knees as
you point out that they suck at their own
sport."
Longtime Daily legend. Spencer Porter,of
fered Davis the ultimate compliment:' Asa lit
tle leaguer who played on the Ross Valley
Expos, you captured the mentality of the
Expos and everything they stood for."
Unfortunately, the fame, fortune and col
lective wrath of the Canadian people that
Davis had garnered from his original piece
would devastate the quality his column. If only

he had listened to his brother Eric, who pre
sciently told Neil that "you are doing big things
there on the Farm. Don't let the success go to
your head."
However, much like slammin' Sammy
Sosa, Davis found his head size ever-increas
ing as he allowed success to permeate the
seemingly solid-structure of his cranium. Ef
forts to maintain the journalistic integrity of
the original column proved as futile as the
2(X)5 Giants attempt to win the NL West
(memo: La Iroy I lawkins is not the answer).
Fastforward three columns to an October
25,2004 column about Mike Ty son, and read
ers responses had drastically changed. Even
within Davis' seemingly tight nit family, a
chasm between Mother and Son had divided
the house. While Davis' Mother Peggy still
maintained that his latest effort was a "good
article," negativity emanated from Neil's
brother. Eric who told the writer (in Korean):
"Neonun dalk daegari ininida."Smarting from
an insult in a language he couldn't translate,
Davis vowed a resurgence in writing quality
It was a resurgence that would never come.
For Davis, the negative press that his col
umn was receiving, coupled with a baseball
postseason without the San Francisco Giants,
found the venerable scribe turning towards a
life of cereal —be it Life, Raisin Bran, or

Wheaties — as he longed to find an escape
from the crushing weight of the neagativity
And yet. the more he wrote, the more the
deluge continued. Despite attempts by Davis
to put a metaphorical poncho over his column,
and stop t he rain of insults from dampening his
journalism. Davis could not stop the rain.
Even with support from the Creed Fanclub
for writing that Scott Stapp "rocks" and "has
pipes", Davis and Co. found themselves inca
pable of warding off the perpetual How of fire
and brimstone that rained damnation on his
column.
According to anonymous emailer "David"
(webmaster of an RPG website), a future col
umn "sucked..." Pebble Beach resident
Meghan Kirbv would later chastise Davis as
she told him that his column had "hit a new
low." And ultimately, anonymous emailer
AtleeNelli43@aol.com, would call Davis an
asshole for his Sir Sidney "1 somehow have a
winning record this year, even with my enor
mous ERA" Ponson column.
Amazingly, having faced more adversity
than Barry Bonds ("I grew up with only four
black kids in my whole school"). Davis proved
resilient and completed his contractual obliga
tions for the Daily.To this day, he still writes.
