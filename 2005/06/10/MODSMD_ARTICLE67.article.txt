## Finding love at The Daily 
### 
For the prospective college grad. life is tilled
with shortages. No money, fewer job offers, and
a bank of marketable skills that points toward a
career in bottle collecting.
Advice, however, surrounds a senior like the
air he breathes, pressing in from every angle
with "answers" that will lead effortlessly to the
perfect job and lifelong fulfillment. What luck.
In this sea of advice, the commandment to
"do what you love" is all too common.The per
fect job is one that pays you to perform a task
that you would happily do free of charge.
Excellent advice, as long as you don't mind
starving to death. Most things that we happily
do without pay are activities for which the issue
of payment is hardly a matter of choice. Watch
ing the NFL playoffs with a full complement of
beer and Cheez-E-Puffs is a good time by any
standard, but a survey of your average classified
section for the words "Rabid Sports Fan Want
ed" will turn up some pretty paltry results. As
suming one were so lucky as to stumble across
those words, here's guessing the position does
n't come with dental.
So what is an undergraduate to do when her
passion doesn't have its own heading and clear
ly defined unit requirements in the Stanford
Bulletin?
It's a quandary that everyone from the ad

missions office to the Career Development
Center assures you is "okay," hut the average
student receives very little in the way of guid
ance toward a solution.
When I first sent an e-mail to the editor-in
chief of The Daily during the summer after my
freshman year, the words "sportswriter" and
"career" were approximately 87 leagues apart
in my mind. Sportswriters were merely a subset
of the prying, scheming tribe of "media," and
besides, 1 was busy convincing myself that noth
ing could lead to a more satisfying future than
the"median voter theorem" and the rest of my
public policy major.
Nonetheless, fora person whose internet
browser cookies are littered with trips to
ESPN.com, MLB.com, and InsertYourFa
voriteSportHere.net, ignoring the siren call of a
press pass and regular sports beat became in
creasingly implausible. With the realization that
my Daily scribbling had become a study break
from course work, the writing was on the wall.
Without any conscious effort. The Daily
backed me into a solution before I'd even had
time to formulate the problem. My post-gradu
ation destination had shifted from Washington,
DC. to Anytown. US.A; my dream employer
had changed from the federal government to
the Podunk Anteaters. minor-league affiliate of
Random Losing Sports Team.
The story is not an endorsement of Daily
writing as an employment cure-all (after all,my
desire to be a sportswriter has doomed me to a
life of penury and poor fashion decisions), al
though the banquets alone are sufficient rea
son to become part of that organization.
It is my suspicion, however, that ignoring
one's passion for lack of appropriate course of
ferings is far from a unique experience. It per
sonally took me three years of writing for the
Daily before realizing that the right career path
needn't correspond to the words on my diplo
ma.
Whether it be writing for the Daily, cam
paigning with the Stanford Republicans, or cul
tivating the world's finest turnips at the Stan
ford Organic Farm,our activities away from the
classroom are not only a huge portion of our
time, but a pure expression of what we'd be
happy to do without pay.
So think about your "day. Maybe the sugges
tion to "do what you love" isn't just a dream
after all.
