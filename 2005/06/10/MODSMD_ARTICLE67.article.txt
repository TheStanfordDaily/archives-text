## Finding love at The Daily 
### 
For the prospective college grad. life is tilled
with shortages. No money, fewer job offers, and
a bank of marketable skills that points toward a
career in bottle collecting.
Advice, however, surrounds a senior like the
air he breathes, pressing in from every angle
with "answers" that will lead effortlessly to the
perfect job and lifelong fulfillment. What luck.
In this sea of advice, the commandment to
"do what you love" is all too common.The per
fect job is one that pays you to perform a task
that you would happily do free of charge.
Excellent advice, as long as you don't mind
starving to death. Most things that we happily
do without pay are activities for which the issue
of payment is hardly a matter of choice. Watch

section for the words "Rabid Sports Fan Want

Center assures you is "okay," hut the average
student receives very little in the way of guid
ance toward a solution.

freshman year, the words "sportswriter" and
"career" were approximately 87 leagues apart
in my mind. Sportswriters were merely a subset
of the prying, scheming tribe of "media," and
besides, 1 was busy convincing myself that noth
ing could lead to a more satisfying future than
the"median voter theorem" and the rest of my
public policy major.
Nonetheless, fora person whose internet
browser cookies are littered with trips to
ESPN.com, MLB.com, and InsertYourFa
voriteSportHere.net, ignoring the siren call of a
press pass and regular sports beat became in
creasingly implausible. With the realization that
my Daily scribbling had become a study break
from course work, the writing was on the wall.
Without any conscious effort. The Daily
backed me into a solution before I'd even had
time to formulate the problem. My post-gradu
ation destination had shifted from Washington,
DC. to Anytown. US.A; my dream employer
