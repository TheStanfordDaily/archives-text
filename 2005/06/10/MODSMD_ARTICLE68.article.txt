## One last playlist 
### 
"MK! MK!" my friends are always screaming at
me, attempting to catch my attention when I'm
strolling in White Plaza or working at The Daily yet
another night, oblivious to the world, iPod head
phones glued semi-permanently to my ears. I ven
tured outside without my iPod once. I simply didn't
know what to do with myself. I even had to engage in
— dare 1 say it — conversation with normal people.
Scary thought.
Anyone who has spent a considerable amount of
time with me knows that my mood du jour is best ex
pressed by looking at the iTunes playlist blasting
through my pink MP3 player — it's like the soundtrack
of my life. The "ANGRR" playlist blasts through my
iPod in moments of temporary rage; the "WTF" for mo
ments of, well, utter annoyance; and the "Ah. Life" for
those days when you can't help but accept what life has
handed to you.
But I'm having a difficult time coming up with a
playlist these days. Nostalgia, excitement, sadness, anx
iety — a chaotic combination of emotions flood my
mind wherever I go. I simply can't put together enough
songs to express how I feel, even with the 12 GB of
music currently suffocating the memory on my laptop.
Yet if were forced to put a name my current playlist
of life, it would be "Surprise." Surprise that I'm going
into journalism post-Stanford, considering I'm a
Humßio major who started out set on going into nutri
tion research. Surprise that I went skydiving at some
point in my time at Stanford — I'm really not the type.
Surprise that these four years are over, after who knows
how many exams, papers — and. shhh, don't tell my
parents — crazy party nights.
I'm sure we will all leave Stanford with a few sur
prise experiences or outcomes we weren't expecting.
And I'm excited to see what surprises will continue to
pop up over the years. Such where in the world weill all
be in five years. Or for which companies we'l be work
ing (or starting) in 10 years. Or who will be the next
Sergey Brin. Larry Page — or Condi Rice. I'm sure we
will all have famous — and infamous — friends and

classmates.
But the one thing I'm not surprised about is how the
overall Stanford experience has turned out. Yes, Alum
ni Association staff, you can quote me on this one in
your glossy brochures. There have been unexpected
twists and turns along the way, but I love Stanford.
I love the people here. A few weeks ago, I was at a
farewell banquet for one of the organizations I work
for, and someone mentioned an interesting article pub
lished recently in The New York Times. Everyone had
read it. It wasn't required reading, people here just like
to stay informed. We discussed it — over a few glasses
of sangria, of course — and fora moment, I just sat back
and reflected on just how intelligent and interesting all
of my classmates here were.
I've also had some phenomenal professors who
were willing to spend time away from their research
just to chat. In my sophomore year, 1 needed an advi
sor fora research project and sent a timid e-mail to
Prof. Don Kennedy, president emeritus, asking him if
we could meet. I figured he would be too busy to meet
with a lowly undergrad. We met a couple days later
(surprise!) and he agreed to be my advisor. I should
n't have been surprised. This is Stanford, after all.
So now, as I get ready to take one my last runs on
Campus Drive (sans my faithful running partners, alas).
I'll pass by the frat houses, calling up blurry memories
of many a party night, run by the different residences
where friends live and have lived and sprint past old
classrooms, where memorable (and not-so-memorable)
lectures were delivered. And through it all, I'll listen to
my last Stanford playlist.
Perhaps I'll take the sad songs off that playlist. I
know that no matter what happens next, thanks to the
lessons I've learned and the people I've met here who
are now integral to my life, I will be fine again.

Michelle Keller cannot believe this is the last thing she'll
write for The Stanford Daily. She will be heading to Or
lando this summer and to Los Angeles in the fall. Write to
her at keller.michelle@gmail.com.
