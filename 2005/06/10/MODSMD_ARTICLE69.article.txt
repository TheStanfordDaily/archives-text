## Le 						fableaux destin de nous 
### 
Like many that have come before and many more
that will follow, this was my fifth year at Stanford — I
graduated one year ago only to return as a coterm three
months later. So though 1 hope to graduate again with
another freshly minted degree, I've come to view this
year's grad school experience as more of an extension of
sorts; what 1 will affectionately refer to as Year Five of
the Stanford experience.
But don't worry, I won't juice this piece with lofty ad
vice for the young or inspirational wisdom for fellow
graduates (things already attempted in last year's faux
farewell). Instead. I'm going to attempt what might be
simultaneously the most selfless and selfish thing possi
ble: I'm going to dedicate this column space to thanking
everyone who helped make this extra year enjoyable. So
here, dear reader, is a shout out to all the lovely people
and things that will forever represent to me my Year 5
— the things I think but do not say nearly enough
Thanks, Honmun. for the late night food runs, the
marathon running sessions and the quiet confidences.
Thank you. Ben, for consistently entertaining the behav
ior of a certifiable madman. Ihanks to Ann, for continu
ing to brave insurmountable odds and insisting I better
myself.Thank you. Fal. for constantly surprising me and
showing me what we are all capable of. Thanks to An
thony. who was game for everything this year from rants
at the CoHo to co-directing a movie to editing the very
column you are reading. Thank you. Josh Schwartz —
your plotting on "The OC" may be ridiculous, but your
music selection is spot on.
Thank you. Karan, for your genuine ego and your un
wavering conviction that all good writing should be in
teresting. Thank you. Max, for most of the same. Thank

you, Jenny, for your effortless profundity and wicked
dance music. Thank you, Nicole, for reasons I hope to
one day be able to articulate better. Thank you, Meena,
for getting me out to concerts and being a welcome face
at Packard. Thank you, Greg, for love of the game.
Thank you, Melissa, for being in our movie and teaching
Anthony how to dance. Thank you. faithful Camry, for
not breaking down. Thank you, "Battlestar Galactica,"
for making sci-fi cool again.
Thanks to Babar and Roxana, for being stellar co-
TAs.Thanks to Professor Dutton, who truly is one of the
department's best faculty members for undergrads.
Thanks to all the students I had the privilege of teaching
this year — it's good to know that intelligent over
achievers will never be in short supply. Thank you, Jon
Stewart, for keeping me informed of current events.
Thank you. Professor Tallent and all the kids from Ad
vanced Fiction Writing, for your whip-smart sensibilities
and much-appreciated encouragement.Thank you, Tom
Kealey, for Four Minute Readings.Thank you. Snow Pa
trol, for "Chocolate."
Thank you. Cynthia and The Daily — I've enjoyed
every minute of it and I'm glad I was able to stay in
volved this year. Thank you. Tarn, for being the saving
grace of Intermission. Thanks to men's basketball,
which gave us a more captivating season than anyone
could have anticipated. Thank you, Steven, Jay and
Justin, for being such accommodating roommates (even
if you do watch way too much "Law & Order"). TTiank
you, George Lucas, for ending your franchise in a semi
dignified manner.
And thank you. Class of 2005, for bringing me along
on this ride.
