A meditation workshop followed
by a question-and-answer session will

Dalai Lama Tanzin Gyatso
Lecture Series. On Saturday at 10 a.m.
in Memorial Auditorium, scientists
from Stanford and peer institutions, as
well as other Buddhist scholars, will
have a dialogue with the Dalai Lama
about the Buddhist perspective on
human craving, suffering and choice.
Some of the weekend's events will
be open to the public and others will be
invitation-only. While members of the
general public can purchase tickets for
the three main events, the number of
tickets sold to those outside the Stan
ford community for the lecture on non
violence will be limited to ensure that
enough spaces are available for stu
dents. McLennan said roughly 30 per
cent of the tickets for this event will be
reserved for students.
Tickets will go on sale for students,
faculty and staff beginning May 31.
and for the general public on June 13.
For those who are unable to attend,
the three events will be webcast live
on dalailama.stanford.edu. Ticket
prices were not listed, although
McLennan said that they would likely
be free to students for at least one of
the events.
The Dalai Lama will also attend an
invitation-only reception hosted by the
Stanford Center for Buddhist Studies.

"The Dalai Lama is one of the
major contemporary religious figures
in the world," said Michael Zimmer
mann, assistant professor of religious
studies who sits on the committee for
libetan studies." Ihe fact that he is vis
iting is a great honor to the University."
McLennan said he has offered the
Dalai Lama an invitation for three
years, as has Dean of the Medical
School Philip Pizzo.
"I le's a very busy man," McLennan
said. "We are very honored that he de
cided to come."
Ihe weekend's events are being
co sponsored by the Office for Reli
gious Life. Stanford Continuing Stud
ies, the Center for Buddhist Studies
a part of the Asian Religions and
Cultures Initiative — and the Stan
lord Medical School.
McLennan said that neuroscientists
on campus and from surrounding areas
are "very interested in looking at Bud
dhism in terms of its understanding of
ihe mind and the spiritual and scientif
ic dimensions of the human mind in re
late hi to craving and suffering."
I le also said that the Dalai Lama is
the ideal figure to speak on the global
necessity for peace and tolerance,
since he received the Nobel Peace
Prize in IW9 and has always discour
aged the use of violence in the Tibetan
liberal ion movement.
