## All good things must end 
### 
When I showed up for Daily "101 X"in March
of my freshman year, I clearly didn't know what I
was getting myself into.
I still remember the then-managing editor of
news showing my fellow prospective staffers and
me around the office. Reporters were busy typing
up breaking news stories. Layout personnel were in
the back hurriedly thinking up the next days head
lines. Ihere was a TV blaring in the corner, a well
stocked fridge in the editor-in-chief's office and the
remains of what looked like a delicious (although
remarkably unhealthy) staff dinner from earlier in
the evening on the center table.
In other words, it was the coolest place I'd ever
seen.
Shortly thereafter. I began writing for the News
Department on a semi-regular basis. From the
start, I was authoring hard-hitting pieces such as
"Awards recognize students" and "New trees
planted in record numbers."
Okay, so maybe my stories weren't quite on the
scale of Woodward and Bernstein — I certainly
wasn't going to bring about President Hennessy's
resignation anytime soon. But I was meeting a lot
of interesting people while covering a myriad of
things occurring on campus that I would have oth
erwise never heard about. My descent into The
Daily as a way of life had begun.
By the time I was a sophomore, I had gotten to
know most of the people on staff, so the office no
longer seemed like a sea of unfamiliar faces. And in
spring of that year, when I became a desk editor for
News,The Daily really got some momentum going
in its slow but steady campaign to take over my ex
istence. As a proud member of the first ever News
team in recent Daily memory that actually enjoyed
being together at News meetings, I was introduced
to a variety of cool characters along with many of
life's smaller joys such as Korean barbeque, pearl
milk tea and pho.
When my junior year started, the transforma
tion was complete.The Daily had me in a death grip
from which I could never hope to escape. From
serving as an Opinions editor in the fall to being ed
itor-in-chief in the spring, any notion of my having

a life outside the paper all but withered away. 1 was
no longer a "student" taking "classes." I was no
longer a "boyfriend" in a "long-term relationship."
I was lost in the bowels of the Storke Publications
Building, a place where I'd come everyday at 3
p.m., only to re-emerge 15 hours later — the sun
rising and morning joggers out making their
rounds — as I genuinely pondered whether or not
I'd be able to catch some shuteye before my 1 o'-
clock while slowly stumbling back to my dorm
room.
But don't get me wrong. Those countless
hours under the office's oppressive fluorescent
lights — during which I refined my golf swing,
chatted with fellow staffers and "edited" the
paper — were more than well spent. The Daily
might have shifted from being my second home
to, well, practically my primary place of resi
dence. My roommates might have occasionally
wondered if I was still alive. But every time I had
a random conversation with a fellow staffer until
6 a.m. or got the chance to break a big story, it'd
all seem worth it again.
Despite the good times, I was intent on taking a
break from The Daily my senior year — until I got
talked into being a managing editor in the fall and
an Intermission editor in the spring. And now. as
graduation approaches and I prepare to take over
the business operations of the organization come
July. I have to stop and wonder if Ill ever escape the
paper's clutches. I probably will, although I'll never
be sure until the time actually comes. What I do
know for certain, though, is that if I'm still having as
much fun as I have had over the last four years, it
won't really matter how long it is until the end.
But seriously, I'm drawing the line at five years
this time. I think.

Brendan Marten is a senior majoring in political sci
ence and co-terming in philosophy who will serve as
7he Daily's business manager and chief operating of
ficer next year. He'd like to thank Scott Allen for coin
ing the all-too-appropriate phrase "bowels of the
Storke Publications Building" in the indisputably
epic first-ever "Sports Intermission."
