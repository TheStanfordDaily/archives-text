## On graduates and casualties 
### 
I was working at The Daily as an Intermission ed
itor when President George W. Bush declared war
against Iraq three years ago. We were supposed to be
on hiatus for finals week but promptly blew off our
studies to print a special war issue. As I watched
staffers older, smarter and better than me scramble
to make deadline, I made a determined mental effort
to anchor that moment within my Stanford experi
ence, dreading the war, but confident that it would
burn itself out long before I graduated.
Succumb to this kind of insular thinking, and
shock is the inevitable sequel. It bothers me that I ut
terly failed to predict the scope of war, both in length
and depth, and it truly shames me that I had the gall
to plot this war — or any war — on a timeline that
was, essentially, a subset of my four-year plan.
Since that frenetic night, 1,634 students (myself
included) have matriculated and will graduate this
week. During that same time, 1,660 other Americans,
many our age or younger, were killed in Iraq. Just
think of it: 1,660 human beings just like us — each
loved, each with a family, each with dreams for the
future — felt pain and fear that we will never com
prehend and died violent deaths while we went to
class, wrote papers, took yoga, got trashed, had sex,
gossiped, ate. drank, slept and breathed.
What we do at Stanford matters, but the bubble
effect is real. Deny war its moral torque, overlook
the sobering facts of the world, and the choices we
make become lies to live by.
Our parents' generation experienced the hard re
ality of war during Vietnam — unlike us, they rallied
against it. Iraq is not Vietnam and. hopefully, it never
will be. The draft is gone, the casualty count is much
lower, military technology is much better, and the
nature of the threat is quite different. Charlie never
struck the Pentagon or the World Trade Center.
The 9/11 attacks, which took place 10 days be
fore the Class of 2005 arrived for freshman orien
tation, shaped our lives at Stanford in obvious and
unexpected ways. Instead of completing third

quarter Spanish, I took a full-year of Arabic. Many
other students did the same.
But the dual specters of terrorism and war have
cowed us — citizens, scholars and journalists — as
well. In general, Americans seem to place an unusu
ally high premium on comfort (or perhaps laziness),
a troubling trend that we are in a perfect position to
fight. After all, college is defined by perpetual, mild
discomfort — we sleep two per room on plastic mat
tresses atop plywood slabs, for God's sake.
Provoking intellectual discomfort is what really
matters though, and more than any other organiza
tion on campus. The Daily is responsible for bring
ing up those touchy issues, for asking the questions
that make people shift in their seats. As the lovely
and talented Anthony Ha once told me while we
were sifting through angry letters to the editor: "If
we're getting hate mail from both sides, we're
probably doing something right."
Experts say the greatest books on September 11
won't be written for at least another 20 years, after
we, the 9/11 generation, can apprehend its meaning
as a historical event. It's so hard — and heartbreak
ing — to imagine that the last chapter of our chil
dren's history books will begin with September 11,
followed by pages and pages detailing what hap
pened next. After that, the textbook ends. How will it
end? What will the lessons, key words and critical
thinking questions be?
When my kids get to the section on Iraq, I'll tell
them how it felt to be at The Daily the night our
country went to war. I can't predict its tone or histor
ical significance, but the basic story will go some
thing like this: There was a war going on. We didn't
know what would happen next. .. We started writ
ing.

Jennie Kim will pursue an M.A. in Middle Eastern
studies at the American University of Beirut in the fall.
