## The 						wisdom of Mikey Lee 
### 
Another year has brought many new pieces of wis
dom, and as I really leave Stanford University for good,
I want to share what I have learned.
Be humble. Don't ever underestimate the power of
letting your actions speak for themselves. Don't be com
placent. Life is way too short to hold back. Go big. Don't
go home. But visit home often. Don't forget the people
who got you where you are. If you're nowhere, call peo
ple up. They'll help you along the way. Appreciate
music. Don't self-deprecate. Make schedules. Make to
do lists. But don't obsess over them. Stay up late. Wake
up early. Don't spend too much money on yourself. Be
generous with your friends. Know that there's always
someone smarter than you. But don't underestimate
yourself. Run fast. Walk slow. Don't diet. Keep your
desk clean. Do what you're good at, but more impor
tantly, do what you love. Introduce yourself to strangers.
Hold the door open for others. Keep a journal. Keep in
touch with people. Visit your friends. Tip generously.
Get sun. Always be willing to give up things of value,es
pecially if it's fora greater good. Always be willing to
give up your future plans, especially if you need to do
bad things to fulfill them. Appreciate what you have.
Don't take things for granted. Don't put up with people
who take you for granted. Keep your receipts. Sing, even
if you think your voice is bad. Respect the opinions of
others.even if you don't agree with them. Fight the good
fight, but know when to fold your hand. Hold your
friends dear while you have them around. After leaving,
you'll stay best friends with some for the rest of your
life. You may never talk to others ever again. So on that
note, my words of wisdom come to a close and I want to
thank those who got me here:

My drawmates — the original bHOOd, we managed
to overcome being suspended fora year, survive
leukemia, get married and have a son, do what we love
— whether that's with a job or without, and most of all,
graduate.
To Singhma, Olu, DedersCoo and Bobbo ... 1 know
we'll be friends fora lifetime. It's been a hell of a ride,
and I'm glad I had you by my side. Always remember to
believe in the life of love, walk in the way of honor, and
serve in the light of truth.
To my friends, who never took me for granted:
Kenny, Brav, Jannie, Colie, Sen. Craig (D-CA), Mare,
the kids from Trancos, Harvs, IT, Remus, KDM, Sleaze
ball. Caroline, Bobo, Dirty, Zar, Dorsey, Payer, TK,
Nikhil, Q, J, Keller, Cho, Ha, BMart, DWang, Riechers,
Keaka, Adamatic, Chuck, Kelsey and Vic Lin.
To the friends from home and family who supported
me the whole way: Batu. Jon-Jon, Mr. and Mrs. Hicks,
Isaac, Charles,Timmo, Izzy. Valor, Christine Ann.
To my mentors: Bill Woo, William Hurlbut, Jeff
Wachtel, Bill Cockayne, John Bravman, Ted Glasser,
Victor Madrigal, Mike Martinez, Bill Shen, Stan Wanat,
Mark Oldman, Thom Massey, Jim Pitofsky and Mike
Choo, thank you for believing in me and helping me be
lieve in myself.
Finally, to my parents: There are much more than
150,000 reasons to thank you, but I can only give you
five words in return and a promise. I love you very
much, and with my life, I promise to make you very
proud.
Thank you to everyone who helped me through
these last five years. May our lifetime bring us great joy
and continued friendship. Take care.
