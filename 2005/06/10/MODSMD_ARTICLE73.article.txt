## One last adventure 
### 
My regular readers might recognize that many of my
columns have been about my family. I wrote about Grandpa's
old-fashioned set shot, and how he would have loved to watch
the Stanford women's basketball team play their traditional
brand of basketball. I wrote about Dad's glory days as Yale's
foosball champion and how he passed that passion onto me. I
wrote about Uncle Lou's youthful exuberance when telling
about his game-winning shot, which showed me that even 50-
year-olds never lose the kid inside them. I wrote several
columns about FC Barcelona, which reflects the passion that
Mom and Avi imbued in me.
I talked to Adrian, who along with the Ricker staff has be
come somewhat of a family to me, and recounted the adven
tures of my roommate, Seyi. as he set out to play professional
soccer in Turkey. I let you all in on the infamous bowling excur
sion and Wiffle ball debacle at the hands of some of my closest
friends on campus.
This is my last column for The Daily and I've really enjoyed
writing and letting you into 400 words of my world every Tues
day. Graduation is here sooner than I ever could have imagined,
and it's time to say goodbye.
I'm not quite ready to relinquish my grip on Stanford, so I
tried hard to live out this last week true to my style: I stayed up
late working on a Chem E project; I spent countless hours
watching playoff basketball, playing pick-up soccer and listen
ing to the Giants on the radio; and I drove up to Malibu Grand
Prix for one last classic mini-golf adventure.
If you've never been to Malibu Grand Prix, imagine it as par
adise on the 101. Semis whoosh by to distract you as you line up
a putt. The bright colored balls stand out against torn blue As
troturf. The ping from batting cages mixes in with the bells and
whistles of the arcade.
My car-full of opponents was a diverse bunch:
Katy, a sweet, happy girl with a charming smile and a vicious
competitive streak that burst through out of nowhere when she
started playing knockout basketball on the Nerf hoop over my
door in March.
Marissa, a fashion-conscious Grande Dame who disdains all
things sport and loves watching mediocre T.V., riding the Mar
guerite to class and analyzing the repressed homoerotic tension
in Disney's 1992 epic film, "Newsies."
David, a friendly Southern boy and the proud owner of the
Dorm Golf gladiator breastplate who wouldn't dream of getting
back at me for the bloody lip I gave him during a game of Fris
bee the day before.

Dixie Chick, my original nemesis who (as I learned over the
course of this year) not only turned out to be more competitive
than me, but has also managed to beat me at everything - tennis,
bowling, cribbage, rock-paper-scissors, Wiffle ball, Elimidate —
and then hound me for it relentlessly. Your time will come, Dixie
Chick, just you wait.
And of course, me, playing under the alias Flash in honor of
my new Nike sneakers that 1 thought were plain white and red
when I bought them only to discover that they're the most os
tentation shiny silver you could ever imagine.
ITie five of us proceeded to course No. 2, famous for its wind
mill and swinging log. David got the evening off on the right foot
by sending his first putt onto the green - of the second hole.
Beset by misfortune and all sorts of poor bounces, he finished
with a 67, a respectable number if you're playing a full day at an
official PGA event.
Katy lived up to form by smiling sweetly and giggling, while
cagily demanding everyone's total score at every hole to better
gauge her progress.
Marissa spent a rather enjoyable evening strolling around
the well-lit gardens with her putter over her shoulder like a
parasol. When I'd ask if she'd like to take the next shot, she
would snap her head towards me and respond in glaring dead
pan: "more than anything."
Dixie Chick? Let's just say that we were locked in intense
competition throughout the entire course. She took an early
lead with a string of twos, but 1 came back with a hole-in-one on
the daunting sth. She managed a masterful hole-in-one on the
11th and a series of late birdies to pull within one putt on head
ing to the last hole.
After our second shots, Dixie found herself in a tough corner
and I was an easy 4 inches from the hole. I would like to be able
to tell the story of how I wistfully gazed into the sunset, calmly
sank the winning putt, gallantly tipped my hat to my opponent
and rode off into the victorious night.
But instead, by some combination of sudden paralysis,
decades-old guilt and frailty under duress, my hot pink ball trav
eled a measly 2 of the 4 inches and stopped, defiantly short of
the hole.
It's the story of my life. We tied the 18th hole, and I lost by a
shot on the 19th. Then the Skee-Ball machine ate my comple
mentary token and wouldn't let me play.Then I came home and
realized I only have a week until I graduate, and all the earlier
pain became insignificant.
I'm going to miss this place.
