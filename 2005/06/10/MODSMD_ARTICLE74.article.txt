## Exactly what I wanted 
### 
I love red shoes, newspapers, good leads and bylines with
my name, wine that tastes like walnut and oak, trains, Trader
Joe's cheese popcorn, hands, Rome and the movie Roman
Holiday, human rights and international law debates, cooking
with my friends, singing while writing term papers. The
Guggenheim museum in Venice and jeans that fit my hips.
A month ago, feeling overly stressed and apprehensive
about my future while sitting in the Lane reading room, lis
tening to Iron and Wine and trying to finish a chapter in my
thesis. I decided to make this list of the things I love. I discov
ered many of these things about myself in the four years at
Stanford.
I am addicted, or perhaps a better word, obsessed, with
worrying that 1 have not done things perfectly At Stanford I
have worried about a range of things — 1 should have taken
different classes, chosen a different major, not gone abroad
for so long, done different summer internships and gotten in
volved with activities other than the ones I chose.
No matter what my parents, my sisters or my friends said,
I always came back with a new lamentation. I could not help
it; 1 just wanted to make the most out of my four undergrad
uate years. It has taken the fast approaching graduation to
make me realize that worrying has not been the solution to
my apprehension.
My library list reminded me that I did exactly what I want
ed to do and fell in love with the right things — the right
things for me. So I have to stop worrying, it is too late and
there is nothing to worry about.
Find your passion: I leave the Stanford Daily knowing it
has been one of the best things I did at Stanford. The editors

who made me a better writer and the excitement I received
seeing my name on the front page of the Daily remind me I
found my niche.
I know I love to write and will become a journalist, and
maybe even act on my buried desire to be a fiction writer.
While I do not know where I will be writing in five years. I
know I will be writing.
Go abroad: Travel, good food, new friends and mastery of
a foreign language were only some of the experiences I
gained from my year in Florence. More importantly, I have a
second family in my Italian host parents. I developed a thesis,
returned on a URO grant, met with leading Italian communi
cation scholars and, just now, finished a thesis on the Italian
media. I bought some amazing shoes and I found an intern
ship, which will hopefully jump-start my career as a foreign
correspondent.
Fall in love: 7"he other night my roommates and I did an
amazing grill job for our friends — I mostly just watched. I am
afraid of the fire so I opened the bottle of wine and made the
salad. Crowded around our little Mirrielees table I realized
that I was going to miss moments like these the most.
They know my quirks and I know theirs,they dealt with my
terrible moods, listened to me crv, celebrated with me and
laughed at my moments of ridiculousness. Graduation is not
going to be goodbye, but probably never again will we be in
one place altogether. Outside of my parents' constant sup
port, they have been my Lifesavers — the mint kind, which
have the additional benefit of making your breath smell good.
I am done worrying. Stanford has been exactly what I
wanted it to be. Almost perfect.
