## High school flashback 
### 
I loved my high school. It was a tiny school
of 400 kids, tucked into the heart of Marin
County, and I can't stop thinking about it. Here
I am. a college senior, writing his last column
after four years at Stanford, and I still think
that my Calculus BC class is in an hour, and I
have to move my car off Mission Ave. because
they ticket like crazy down there.
But friends, what made my high school so
special weren't the classes. It wasn't the
teachers. It wasn't even the students. It was
the combination of every part, every ele
ment, and every person to create a culture of
compassion.
TTiis culture is perfectly exemplified by
something called a "senior speech." Every
senior, no matter what, had to get up in front
of the entire school and deliver a five-minute
speech about themselves. It could be a story of
a particularly inspirational moment, a piece of
prose, even a song or a dance. But it had to be
something. For five minutes, every student
had the undivided attention of the entire
school, and it was wonderful.
You can probably tell where this is going, so
I'll just lay it on the line right here: This col
umn, a weekly spot for me to expose my biases
on a wide range of issues over the last three
years, has been my senior speech.
I have had the privilege, admittedly, of tak
ing up more of your time and space than I
probably should have, but in the end. I hope
you have enjoyed it as much as I have.

This column, among other things, has led
me to create a space for myself on this campus,
and thanks to your loyal readership, it has been
a largely reciprocal venture.
I really appreciate each and every one of
my readers, whether they read every word of
every column, or whether they just saw my
picture and laughed at my hideously dved
hair.
So whether it was my Introduction to
American Law TA stopping section to tell
me "don't listen to the haters." an e-mail back
to me discussing the finer points of Pac-10 of
ficiating or just a "Nice column!" shout-out
on my way to class, thank you. In your appre
ciation, you have helped me create the same
culture of compassion so prevalent at my
alma mater.
In four years, I'm sure I'll be stressed out.
flashing back to when I had an essay due for
my American Studies section in mere min
utes. but my bike's back tire was flatter than
Kansas. I'll remember playing soccer in
Meyer Library, plucking parking tickets off
my car and hitting golf ball after golf ball to
wards Lake Lag.
But of course, Ill always remember this col
umn, the joy it gave me, and hopefully, you as
well.
