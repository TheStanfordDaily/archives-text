## The 						road less Tivo-ed 
### 
Almost three and a half years ago, 1 boarded a
plane in the oppressive humidity of Miami, Florida,
leaving behind a professional basketball team that
consistently lost to Knicks, a football team on the de
cline, and the only city I ever knew. At the time,my fa
vorite high school teacher had given me a copy of
Robert Frost's poem "The Road Less Taken," her way
of trying to instill courage in me to try new things.
Having never been a fan of poetry, I never read the
poem. Poetry has just never been my thing. 1 lowever
from the title. I am sure we can all surmise the message
of the poem â€” try new things; making the same deci
sions will lead to an unfulfilling life.
In the eyes of my grandparents, I have lived up to
that credo. Whenever they ask me about my classes, I
shrug them off, instead wanting to talk about student
government, having fun or the number of nights I
have gone without sleep. And to many.they will never
get "it."for why would a student when handed the
keys to the Emerald City of Academia (albeit for
$40.(KX) a year), not jump at the chance to take as
many world-class courses with world-class professors
as possible?
For me, the choice is clear because there is so much
more than just academics. The array of extracurricu
lars, amazing dorm-life and weather provide an envi
ronment for Stanford students to find their individual
ways to flourish, and not be constrained by parental
pressure or past experiences. It is true that I will leave
Stanford without having learned everything I could.

rarely having given it my all in classes, hut I will he
most proud of those areas where I devoted my time
and energy (watchingTV, sucking at beirut).
In the remaining space I have left in this rant, 1
would like to thank my parents. I know ... awww ..
. I low cute. But the truth is that my parents gave me
the unlimited possibilities to find myself and pursue
the endeavors 1 found worth pursuing. Hell, for the
last three months, I have built a SuperTivo, have
consistently watched tv, have enjoyed the outdoors,
have allowed a dog named Oskie to poo in my shoe
and have not attended a single class. While these ac
tivities would seem to demonstrate that 1 have lost
all semblance of ambition, wanting to never let my
parents down will continue to motivate me, even if
my amibition is to watch more TV than human pos
sible.
The Robert Frost poem is right in some many ways
(alright, 1 did read it,but 1 didn't want to admit it ).The
path less taken is a more fruitful path, an avenue that
will truly allow one to better understand oneself. 1
only hope more people have had the freedom to
clumsily choose roads as have 1. And while 1 will never
return to live in Miami. 1 can at least claim to have
been from there when they win the NBA champi
onship.
Before I graduate, to clear the record: Stanford
women are attractive.Ti Vo is unquestionably the best
invention EVER and the ASSU does do stuff (1 think
... )
