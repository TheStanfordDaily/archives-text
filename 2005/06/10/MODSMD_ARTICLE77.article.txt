## Lessons learned 
### 
Years before 1 came to Stanford, I wanted to write for The Daily,
because I believed it to be the best college newspaper in the coun
try. My expectations for my experience could hardly have been
higher, hut The Daily nonetheless exceeded all of them.
Long before 1 entered high school. I knew what I wanted to do
with my life. I wanted to be a sportswriter. More specifically, I
wanted to cover Major League Baseball fora living.
I've spent the last decade of my life pursuing this goal, and
thanks in large part to The Daily. I am now doing what 1 have al
ways wanted to do with my life, and I know how fortunate I am
to be able to say that.
Not surprisingly, then. 1 have quite a people 1 need to thank
for my good fortune. During my three-plus years on the Farm, I
met countless Daily staffers who saw their dreams come true,
too. There never seemed to be any failures among the Daily
diehards, only successes, and in my mind that's as much a cred
it to the newspaper as it is to the individuals who've kept it both
an excellent publication and an effective training ground over
the years.
I am the writer and the person that I am today in large part be
cause of the lessons I learned at Hie Daily. I've learned how to be a
professional journalist, sure, but I've also learned less tangible les
sons: how to be a somewhat efficient manager, how to advance
one's career in an ever-difficult field, how to rise to a challenge and
how to cope with disappointment.
I'd like to use this space to thank some of the outstanding
Daily staffers who influenced me most during my time at Stan
ford. Jon Stull, who gave me my first sports beat and helped me
improve without stilling my enthusiasm. Mark Boucher, who
gave me my first editing job and served as a role model for effi
ciency and accomplishment. Arisha Hatch, who wasn't afraid to
demand my best or question my opinions. Ramin Setoodeh. who
taught me a great deal about self-actualization and the keys to
professional success. Mark Dominik, who always understood

what 1 meant and was never afraid to share his opinion. Erin
Archerd. a thoughtful friend who forwarded me the email that
ended up jumpstarting my career.
Iliere are countless others, and if I had the space, I could list al
most everyone I've ever worked with. Even those staffers with
whom I did not necessarily get along taught me many things, inten
tionally and incidentally
As influential as'llie Daily has been in my life, 1 would be remiss
if 1 did not acknowledge several other people who have nothing to
do with it.
I would not be who I am today if not for my parents. I have no
greater respect for any pair of individuals than I do for Carl and
Marilynn, who dreamt seemingly impossible dreams as young
adults and achieved them so seamlessly that I almost never real
ized how remarkable my parents were.
Iliey instilled in me a belief that success is a choice, and never
stood between me and my own aspirations. Everything I have
achieved or ever will achieve is a credit to them and their quietly
effective parenting.
I also would like to mention my grandparents. Pauline and
Douglas, who've taught me the meaning of family, community
and heroism, and my grandmother Imogene, whose selflessness
and strength make her the most wonderful person I've ever had
the honor to know.
I .astly, though, I must thank my sister, Margo, with whom 1 will
graduate this year. Not one has meant more to me or done more
for me. and I owe her my thanks and my gratitude.
1 apologize for the overtly personal nature of this farewell.The
Daily has meant very much to me over the years, and 1 hope my
appreciation for it has been made clear. When 1 graduate Sunday,
I will be proud and content, and I'm not certain I could be either
were it not for the impact ITie Daily has had on my life.
