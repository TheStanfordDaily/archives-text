## Editor in Chief hearts The Daily 
### 
Editor's Note: This column was published in the
June I edition of The Daily; the last regular issue of
the academic year.
That you are reading this newspaper now is
somewhat of a miracle.
Last night, our Internet connection went
down — which meant that anyone submitting an
article had to bring it into the office on a floppy
disk. Remember what those are? We used them
before the days of e-mail.
It also meant that we could not Google facts
or Facebook sources; several times during the
night, we sent an editor to the Women's Commu
nity Center, located around the corner from our
office, to use a computer there.
And it meant that we could not send the
paper electronically to our printer. So we had to
arrange for our business manager to drive to
Redwood City in the middle of the night to deliv
er the paper, on two CDs, to our printer. No one
at The Daily has had to do that since the mid
-19905.
"Oh my goodness, we're stuck in the Stone
Age," I said several times.

As if putting together the second-largest issue
of the volume (a whopping 32 pages) wasn't
enough work, there were a few late-breaking
news events we had to cover. Without the Inter
net, we relied on good old-fashioned reporting
tactics to hunt down sources. We used a phone
book. We called friends and friends of friends. We
went to peoples residences.
We had the time of our lives.
Had things in the office gone the way they
should have, you would be reading an entirely
different editorial right now. For two weeks, I had
been thinking about what 1 wanted to write in
this space. I read those written by my predeces
sors, whom 1 had admired over the last three
and-a-half years. I wrote one yesterday after
noon, but I scrapped it. 1 wanted to share with
you the adventure that we had last night because
that's exactly why 1 fell in love with Ilie Daily in
October 2001.
When I came into'lhe Daily as a freshman to
copyedit my first news story ("Attacks raise
turnout at religious services," Oct. 12,2001 ),I was
scared. I don't remember much of that editing
session but I remember being relieved when mv

editor and I were done. I also remember being in
awe of the people I saw in the office — 1 could
not believe that a group of students worked into
the early hours of the morning to publish a news
paper every day. I liked the pulse and the pace of
the newsroom. I liked the excitement and the
sense of urgency in the air. I knew then that I
would never leave The Daily until the day I grad
uated from Stanford.
Since January 31,2005, when I took over as
editor in chief, I have spent more time at The
Daily than in my dorm. You can tell because my
office is more decorated than my room in Cas
tano. From Sunday to Thursday, between the
hours of 3 p.m. and 3 a.m.. I was at the Storke
Publications Building. That means that I never
got to watch "Desperate Housewives" with my
dra wmates. I never made it to a single Senior Pub
Nite. I missed birthday dinners and study breaks
at luUe Nite. But looking back at the 71 nights
I've spent at Ihe Daily as editor in chief, I don't
have any regrets.
Sure, there are things I wish I could have done
better. Every weekday morning for the past four
months. I have dreaded reading The Daily. Yes,

dreaded. Perhaps even hated. Why? Because I
knew that I would find a mistake that I hadn't
seen the previous night. A name misspelled, a
comma misplaced, a jump that doesn't exist.
ITiere were bigger mistakes, too, of course —
when reporters got facts entirely wrong. That's
when the angry e-mails and phone calls would
come flooding in. And there are stories we
missed or didn't cover as thoroughly as I wish we
had.
But I don't regret taking this job. 'Ihe main
reason is that I've developed friendships with my
editors, the only ones who can truly understand
and relate to my experience at The Daily. They
are the ones who make fun of me for wearing
yoga pants every day.They understand why I will
not eat pizza, Chinese food or anything from the
Treehouse for months, if not years.'lhey are the
ones who helped me get through the volume
without having an emotional, mental or physical
breakdown. This editorial is dedicated to them.
I must thank two more groups of people. I will
forever be indebted to my family and friends. My
parents listened, rather than yelled, when I called
them at 4 a.m. (7 a.m. their time) as I was heading

to bed and they were getting ready to start their
days. And my closest friends visited me at The
Daily because I couldn't go to see them. (As I
write this piece, my roommate is sleeping on my
office couch.) I will never, ever forget their sup
port and encouragement.
Lastly. I must thank you, dear Daily read
er. The last time I wrote in this space, I made
a promise to you. I promised that I would
pick up my cell phone and listen to your
comments and thoughts about The Daily. To
those of you who called, e-mailed or stopped
by. thank you. Your contributions — and
even harsh criticisms — helped make The
Daily better. And now, as my term as editor
comes to a close, I have one request: Please
don't stop. Challenge next year's staff to
continue to answer your questions and re
spond to your concerns. Hold them account
able as vou have me.

would never leave The Daily until the day I grad
uated from Stanford.
Since January 31,2005, when I took over as
editor in chief, I have spent more time at The
Daily than in my dorm. You can tell because my
office is more decorated than my room in Cas
tano. From Sunday to Thursday, between the
hours of 3 p.m. and 3 a.m.. I was at the Storke
Publications Building. That means that I never
got to watch "Desperate Housewives" with my
dra wmates. I never made it to a single Senior Pub
Nite. I missed birthday dinners and study breaks
at luUe Nite. But looking back at the 71 nights
I've spent at Ihe Daily as editor in chief, I don't
have any regrets.
Sure, there are things I wish I could have done
better. Every weekday morning for the past four
months. I have dreaded reading The Daily. Yes,

dreaded. Perhaps even hated. Why? Because I
knew that I would find a mistake that I hadn't
seen the previous night. A name misspelled, a
comma misplaced, a jump that doesn't exist.
ITiere were bigger mistakes, too, of course —
when reporters got facts entirely wrong. That's
when the angry e-mails and phone calls would
come flooding in. And there are stories we
missed or didn't cover as thoroughly as I wish we
had.
But I don't regret taking this job. 'Ihe main
reason is that I've developed friendships with my
editors, the only ones who can truly understand
and relate to my experience at The Daily. They
are the ones who make fun of me for wearing
yoga pants every day.They understand why I will
not eat pizza, Chinese food or anything from the
Treehouse for months, if not years.'lhey are the
ones who helped me get through the volume
without having an emotional, mental or physical
breakdown. This editorial is dedicated to them.
I must thank two more groups of people. I will
forever be indebted to my family and friends. My
parents listened, rather than yelled, when I called
them at 4 a.m. (7 a.m. their time) as I was heading

to bed and they were getting ready to start their
days. And my closest friends visited me at The
Daily because I couldn't go to see them. (As I
write this piece, my roommate is sleeping on my
office couch.) I will never, ever forget their sup
port and encouragement.
Lastly. I must thank you, dear Daily read
er. The last time I wrote in this space, I made
a promise to you. I promised that I would
pick up my cell phone and listen to your
comments and thoughts about The Daily. To
those of you who called, e-mailed or stopped
by. thank you. Your contributions — and
even harsh criticisms — helped make The
Daily better. And now, as my term as editor
comes to a close, I have one request: Please
don't stop. Challenge next year's staff to
continue to answer your questions and re
spond to your concerns. Hold them account
able as vou have me.

Cynthia would have written a new column if
she had had the time. But it's true that she will
miss The Daily. Write to her at
