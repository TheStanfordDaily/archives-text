# Advisory panel recommends divestment
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University's Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility, or APIR, recommended
on TUesday to divest from four companies be
cause of their alleged links to the Sudanese
government.
The next University body to vote on divest
ment will be the Board of Trustees Subcommittee
on Investment Responsibility, which will issue its
own recommendation to be presented to the
Board of Trustees in early June. The Board will
make the final decision on the matter.
The panel also approved administrative
changes, including the creation of a Web site that
would allow community members to express
reservations about investment decisions.
The recommendation was a victory for student
organizations, such as the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, or SCID, and Students
Taking Action Now: Darfur, or STAND, which
have launched separate efforts expressing disap
proval of Stanford's investments.
The recommendation pertained specifically to
the oil companies PetroChina, ABB Ltd. Sinopec
and Tatneft. STAND leaders claim that the Uni

versity currently has about $1 million invested in
PetroChina.
The controversy over investments in compa
nies tied to the Sudanese government has not
been limited to Stanford.
Last month. Harvard decided to divest about
$4.4 million in shares of PetroChina, and earlier
this month the Illinois General Assembly passed a
bill to suspend state investment in companies
doing business with the Republic of Sudan.
Co-terminal student and APIR member Anna
Mumford. who is also a member of SClD,said that
there was "lots of very heated discussion over
Darfur" at Tuesday's meeting. She said that it took
a long time to bring the issue of divestment to a
vote even though the recommendations went on
to pass by substantial margins.
"The people running the meeting were in the
minority, so they tended not to let the majority
voices speak or take a vote," Mumford said.
Graduate School of Business Prof. George
Parker, the chair of the panel, is in New York and
could not be reached for comment. Parker will
present the results of Tuesday's vote to the Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsibility.
The panel cast three separate votes related to
divestment, Mumford said, all of which passed.

The first vote was in favor of "disinvestment,"
which means that Stanford would not buy new
shares of the companies, but would hold on to the
ones it already has. The second vote was to divest
from all four companies.
The third vote, to divest specifically from
PetroChina, was taken because some panel mem
bers felt that a stronger case could be made
against the company, Mumford said.
Stanford does not disclose its investment deci
sions, but Parker said in The Stanford Report
April 27 that it is helpful to "presume that the Uni
versity has owned, does own or might own all of
the stocks that are publicly traded."
On April 26, STAND presented a report to the
advisory panel urging Stanford to divest from the
four companies, which all do business in Sudan.
"We thought we had a pretty strong case," said
junior Ben Elberger, one of the leaders of
STAND. "We had met with many of the members
individually before the meeting, and some of them
had concerns about whether divestment was the
correct course of action, but in general it was a
pretty positive reception."
