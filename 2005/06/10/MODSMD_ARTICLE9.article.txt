### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Nick Jones, Class of 2003, has discovered a new
reason to admire his grandfather. Mark Felt — re
cently identified as Deep Throat, The Washington
Post's famous informant responsible for blowing the

During the summer and fall of 1973, however.
Woodward and Bernstein wrote a number of arti

garding Nixon's connection to the burglary. The
seemingly outrageous facts were confirmed and
some were even volunteered by a public official who
insisted his identity be protected, according to the
Vanity Fair article.
