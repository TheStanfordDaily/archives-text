# Watergate informant unmasked
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Nick Jones, Class of 2003, has discovered a new
reason to admire his grandfather. Mark Felt — re
cently identified as Deep Throat, The Washington
Post's famous informant responsible for blowing the
lid off the Watergate scandal, which caused Presi
dent Richard Nixon to resign in 1974.
Deep Throat, considered by many to be the most
important anonymous source ever quoted, has long
been one of journalism's greatest mysteries, accord
ing to Vanity Fair magazine, which broke the story.
Felt, now 91 -years-old, kept his role in the scandal
under wraps for more than 30 years until yesterday,
when writer John D. O'Connor announced his iden
tity to the public.
The revelation doesn't come as a complete sur
prise since Felt — who was the number two official
at the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the
Nixon administration — would have had access to
the information that was revealed to reporters Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein.
In an interview with The Daily. Jones said that
not even Felt's immediate family knew of his role in
tearing down thelMixon administration until a few
years ago.The family has-still not released an official
response about when, exactly, they learned Felt's se
cret, he added.
In 1972, five men affiliated with the Republican
National Party — some of whom were later found
to be directly involved with the Committee to Re
elect the President — broke into the National De
mocratic Committee's headquarters, located in a
Washington, D.C. office-hotel building called Wa
tergate. Nixon denied accusations that his adminis
tration hired the men to help swing the polls in his
favor. He was re-elected fora second term and the
scandal faded fora short while.
During the summer and fall of 1973, however.
Woodward and Bernstein wrote a number of arti
cles that contained incriminating information re
garding Nixon's connection to the burglary. The
seemingly outrageous facts were confirmed and
some were even volunteered by a public official who
insisted his identity be protected, according to the
Vanity Fair article.
Felt was giving reporters "information on deep
background," CNN reported yesterday."The Deep
Throat nickname, coined by a Post editor, was a play
on the phrase and a popular porn movie by the same
name."
Only Woodward, Bernstein and
Benjamin C. Bradlee, the executive
editor of The Post at the time, knew
the face behind the Deep Throat
alias.
Jones said his grandfather chose
not to disclose his identity to anyone

else until recently because "he was
concerned about being an honorable
guy."
"He knew he had done the right
thing in unveiling the Watergate
scandal, but when you work for the
FBI., everything is confidential,"
Jones said. "Taking information to
the press is breaking the FBl's num
ber one rule, and he wanted to pro
tect the organization."
Felt also feared for his personal
safety and that of The Post reporters,
O'Connor wrote in his article. Jones

confirmed this fact.
The long-awaited truth about
Deep Throat has proved to be elec
trifying. Jones said that reporters
have been calling his family all day,
proposing to pay them for extra pic
tures and interviews. Although Van
ity Fair reported that Jones' mother,
Joan Felt, at one point thought prof
its from publicity could help pay her
children's tuitions, the family has
decided not to accept any money,
Jones said.
"We're mainly just in it to honor

my grandfather," Jones said. "There
have been offers of money, but that's
not what this is about."
In a family statement which he
read to the press, Jones said, "I guess
people used to think Deep Throat
was a criminal, but now they think
he's a hero."
