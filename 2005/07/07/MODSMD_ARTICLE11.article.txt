## No more work — more play! 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
"No one should ever work. Work is the
source of nearly all the misery in the world. Al
most any evil you'd care to name comes from
working or from living in a world designed for
work. In order to stop suffering, we have to stop

working."
— Bob Black in his famous
essay, "The Abolition of
Work."
From childhood, we're
taught that work is noble, that
our work is our Identity, that
work provides meaning in
life. Yet there are many rea
sons why work is actually bad
— assuming we use the stan-

dard definition of work as tasks we perform for
pay or some artificial reward like grades, and in
a manner focused on efficiency rather than en
joyment.
Here are seven Reasons Why You Should
Work Less or Not at All:
1) Work is bad for your health. Insufficient
sleep and sitting at a desk all day is a lot less
healthy than, say, playing outside while gather
ing fruit and nuts.

2) Work is a huge source of stress. According
to St. Paul Fire and
Marine Insurance Company, "Problems at
work are more strongly associated with health
complaints than are any other life stressor —
more so than even financial problems or family
problems."
3) Work can kill you. Karoshi — death from
overworking — is an official occupational dis
ease in Japan.
4) Lots of work is actually bad for the world.
David C. Korten, a former Harvard Business
School professor wrote in "When Corpora
tions Rule the World," "The possibilities are
extraordinary if we acknowledge that many
existing jobs not only are unsatisfying but
also involve producing goods and services
that are either unnecessary or cause major
harm to society and to the environment. This
includes a great many of the jobs in the auto
mobile, chemical, packaging and petroleum
industries; most advertising and marketing
jobs; the brokers and financial portfolio man
agers engaged in speculative and other ex
tractive forms of investment; ambulance
chasing lawyers; 14 million arms industry
workers worldwide; and the 30 million peo-


Runyan
pie employed by the world's mili
tary forces. This leads to a startling
fact. Instead of paying hundreds of
million of people sometimes outra
geous amounts to do things that are
harmful to the quality of our living,
we would be better off if we gave
them the same pay to sit home and
do nothing."
5) Work distracts us from what we
care about besides our work.
6) Work devalues things we don't
do for pay. There are plenty of valu
able things people might do without
pay, but the fact that they aren't
"work" makes them seem less valu
able to others and to the people who
do them. Compare this with the way
that courses and grades devalue self

motivated learning; because formal
courses exist, people don't put much
stock in learning on their own.
7) Work detracts from relation
ships with friends, family, lovers, etc.
How many relationships have failed
because one or both people put
work ahead of the other? It's hard to
switch between work, which is fo
cused on efficiency, and relation
ships, in which the focus is almost
the opposite.
On the other hand, idleness is
pretty bad, too. I'll trust that I don't
have to lay out seven reasons for you
to be convinced that not doing much
is also bad for your well-being.
Most people say that we need to
balance work and play in order to
schedule time for baths or watching
movies, in-between intense study ses
sions or 60-hour work weeks.
But I think this sort of life causes
people to miss out on one of the most
satisfying things life has to offer —

active play.
Bob Black writes that stopping
work "doesn't mean we have to stop
doing things. It does mean creating a
new way of life based on play; in
other words, a lucid conviviality,
commensality and maybe even art...
Play isn't passive. Doubtless we all
need a lot more time for sheer sloth
and slack than we enjoy now, regard
less of income or occupation, but
once recovered from employment
induced exhaustion nearly all of us
want to act."
I think it's true that people like to
be active. If you don't believe it about
yourself, take some time off and
allow yourself to create your own
challenges and engage in things that
sometimes are called work — for
their own sake.
Other than the fear that without
work or courses to motivate us, we
wouldn't do anything, other fears
impel us to keep working: the fear

that without a traditional job, we'll
become homeless, or that without a
large salary, we won't be able to do
what we want to do in life, or that
without a prestigious job, we will be
nobodies.
Yet there are plenty of ways to find
fulfillment in life besides traditional
professions; there are plenty of ways
to support yourself and others without
spending much money; and there are
plenty of ways to challenge yourself
outside the job market.
In fact, I don't think we should be
afraid of not "working." Instead,
given the hazards and opportunity
costs of holding down a job, we
should fear work itself.
