## No more work — more play! 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
"No one should ever work. Work is the
source of nearly all the misery in the world. Al
most any evil you'd care to name comes from
working or from living in a world designed for
work. In order to stop suffering, we have to stop

working."
— Bob Black in his famous
essay, "The Abolition of
Work."
From childhood, we're
taught that work is noble, that
our work is our Identity, that
work provides meaning in
life. Yet there are many rea
sons why work is actually bad
— assuming we use the stan-

dard definition of work as tasks we perform for
pay or some artificial reward like grades, and in
a manner focused on efficiency rather than en

Here are seven Reasons Why You Should
Work Less or Not at All:
1) Work is bad for your health. Insufficient
sleep and sitting at a desk all day is a lot less
healthy than, say, playing outside while gather

2) Work is a huge source of stress. According
to St. Paul Fire and
Marine Insurance Company, "Problems at
work are more strongly associated with health
complaints than are any other life stressor —
more so than even financial problems or family
problems."
3) Work can kill you. Karoshi — death from
overworking — is an official occupational dis
ease in Japan.
4) Lots of work is actually bad for the world.
David C. Korten, a former Harvard Business
School professor wrote in "When Corpora
tions Rule the World," "The possibilities are
extraordinary if we acknowledge that many
existing jobs not only are unsatisfying but
also involve producing goods and services
that are either unnecessary or cause major
harm to society and to the environment. This
includes a great many of the jobs in the auto
mobile, chemical, packaging and petroleum
industries; most advertising and marketing
jobs; the brokers and financial portfolio man
agers engaged in speculative and other ex
tractive forms of investment; ambulance
chasing lawyers; 14 million arms industry
workers worldwide; and the 30 million peo-
