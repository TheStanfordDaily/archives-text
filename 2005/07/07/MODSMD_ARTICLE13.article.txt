## Stanford wins Director's Cup 
### JOHN SHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Director's Cup Heads Back Home to The Farm
Number 11 is in the record books. On June 29, the
National Association of Collegiate Directors of Ath
letics (NACDA) presented Stanford with its record
11th consecutive Director's Cup trophy. The Direc
tor's Cup annually recognizes the best collegiate ath
letic program in the nation — and with a pair of na
tional championships, several runners-up and several
other top 10 teams this year — the Cardinal were
sure to bring home the prize.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland proudly
accepted the honor and thanked all of the talented
teams and players across all Stanford sports.
Nonetheless, some teams contributed more than
others in the complicated point system that deter
mines the winner of the Director's Cup. NCAA
Championships in women's volleyball and women's
tennis gave Stanford a definite edge in the standings.
A second-place finish in both men's water polo and
men's swimming gave Stanford a cushion and the nu
merous accomplishments in track and field, softball,
basketball, cross country and gymnastics pushed the
University over the top.
The top five universities recognized by the
NACDA were Stanford, Texas, UCLA. Michigan
and Duke.
Ogonna Nnamani garners Honda-Broderick Cup
Ogonna Nnamani, U.S. Olympian and MVP of
the 2005 Stanford women's volleyball national
championship team, was recognized on June 29 as
the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year. With

out a doubt, she was a strong contender going into
deliberation, but it was her outstanding sports
manship, leadership and energy in this year's vol
leyball season that earned her this year's Honda-
Broderick Cup.
Nnamani's high-class company includes track star
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, soccer hero Mia Hamm, bas
ketball player and coach Cheryl Miller and fellow vol
leyball phenomenon Misty May. Nnamani becomes
only the second athlete in Stanford history to be
named the Collegiate Athlete of the Year — former
Cardinal swimmer Tara Kirk became the first in 2004.
In addition to making a name for herself on the na
tional level, Nnamani has secured her place in Stan
ford record books for years to come. She recorded
823 kills during the Cardinal's 2004-2005 campaign, a
single-season record for Stanford and the Pacific-10
Conference. Additionally, Nnamani has dished out
2,450 career kills, also a Pac-10 record.
Honors have poured in for Nnamani in the past
year, as she has earned recognition as ESPN's Vol
leyball Academic Ail-American and the NCAA Vol
leyball Tournament's Most Outstanding Player.
Nnamani graduated from Stanford last month, re
ceiving her bachelor of arts in the Program in Human
Biology. Her sister, Njideka Nnamani, who also plays
the outside hitter position for the Cardinal women, is
a rising junior.
The Cardinal win the 2005 Lexus Gauntlet trophy
In the first annual Lexus Gauntlet competition, the
Cardinal defeated cross-bay rival Berkeley in a year
long athletic battle between the schools by a narrow
70-65 margin. Leland accepted Stanford's Lexus
