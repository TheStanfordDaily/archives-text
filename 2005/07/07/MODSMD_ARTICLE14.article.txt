# Runners hit Nationals

### CAROLYN PENNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Erica McLain set a new
junior triple jump record of 45 feet
2 inches at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Track and Field Champi
onships in May, she probably did
not expect to soon destroy her own
mark by more than nine inches. But
athletes often surprise people —
even themselves.
At the U.S. Outdoor Track and
Field Championships in Carson,
Calif., which concluded on June 26,
McLain soared 45-113/4 in her third
and final jump. Second place finish
er, Candace Baucham, jumped 45-11
1/4. About two weeks earlier,
Baucham had won the NCAA triple
jump championship, at a meet in
which McLain took third and earned
All-American honors.
Although McLain has already
made quite a name for herself as a
U.S. and Pac-10 outdoor champion,
taking second and third at Western
Regionals and NCAAs, respective
ly, she is far from finished. She will
continue her incredible career and
represent Team U.S.A. at the World
Championship in Helsinki, Finland
in early August.
Four other current and graduat
ed Stanford athletes will join
McLain and compete for Team
U.S.A. in August: recent graduate
lan Dobson (5,000m), rising senior
Ryan Hall (5,000m), Lauren Flesh

man. Class of 2003, (5,000m) and as
sistant coach Toby "Crash" Steven
son (pole vault).
Dobson and Hall finished second
and third in the men's 5,000-meter at
the U.S. Outdoor Championships.
Dobson broke Hall's old school
record, 13:22.32, with a final time of
13:15.33. Hall crossed the line only
0.7 seconds later, earning a tune of
13:16.03. Alum Jonathon Riley, an
other All-American athlete, finished
fifth in 13:25.04, while Neftalem
Araia, a current athlete, finished
17th in 14:01.25.
In the women's 5,000-meter race,
All-American Lauren Fleshman,
class of 2003, finished second in
15:16.80. In the same race, Sara Bei,
who graduated last month, took
sixth place with a time of 15:24.74.
Former Stanford All-American
Stevenson earned his spot on the na
tional team with an 18-foot-6-inch
jump in the pole vault — good
enough for third place.
At the Outdoor Championships,
which occurred at the same time as
Senior Nationals in Carson, rising
sophomores Lindsay Allen and
Wopamo Osaisai gave spectators a
glimpse of a promising future for
Stanford's track and field squad as
they took first and second, respec
tively, in their events.
Allen completed the 3,000-
meter steeplechase in 10:37.94 and

Rising sophomore Wopamo Osaisai took second in the 100-
meter at the Outdoor Championships.
beat the second place runner,
Marie Lawrence, who ran 10:40.95.
Not only did Osaisai earn himself a
second place finish in the 100-meter
with a time of 10.58, but he also
took fifth place in the 200-meter.
His blistering time in the 200-
meter, 21.04, broke Stanford's
freshman record. Both Osaisai and
Allen will extend their seasons and
compete for Team U.S.A. at the Ju
nior Pan American Track and Field
Championships later this month in
Ontario, Canada.
These are only some of the ath
letes who competed in Carson. A
total of 28 current and former Stan
ford athletes participated in either the
Junior or Senior National Champi
onships.
