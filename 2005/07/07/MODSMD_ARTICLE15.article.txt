# Greer Park transforms
## Rugby rumbles into Palo Alto 
### DAN CERVANTES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This past Saturday, at Greer Park in Palo Alto, sev
eral athletes from the Stanford men's rugby club com
peted along with their summer teammates from the
San Jose Seahawks Rugby Football Club in the first of
four Tonik Summer Sevens tournaments to be held
nearby this summer.
Greer Park is normally a cluster of baseball fields, but
the rugby club has spent time converting the area into
something a little more suited to their style. Drawn in the
grass of the park on Saturday was a series of full-size
rugby fields or "pitches". The place was crawling with
rugby players and their friends and families. There were
high school and adult teams, men's and women's teams.
This was not your typical rugby tournament, though.
All of these teams focus on something called sevens
rugby during the summer. Normally, in fifteens rugby,
each of the two teams in a rugby match has 15 players on
the pitch at a time. Without changing the size of the
pitch, sevens cuts the number of players in half and
greatly reduces the length of each game. This kicks an al
ready exciting, fast-paced game into high-gear, and the
physical fitness of the athletes is really put to the test.
After having just finished two games in a row, recent
graduate Jose Guevara looked like he had just sprinted
several miles. It wasn't surprising at all when he said that
he needed to rest and lamented only having the length of
one game to do it.
One whole game? That's plenty of
time, right? Not for sevens.
Each game consists of two seven
minute halves with a two-minute
break in the middle. This doesn't
sound like enough time to even
break a sweat, but on a full-size pitch,
in the hot morning sun, upcoming
sophomore Jon Hofius said that
playing one sevens match feels like
playing an 80-minute game of fif
teens. Nonetheless, he and the other
players were all excited to get to play
such a fast-paced game.
And after only a few minutes, Jose
was warming up for his next game
with energy like it was his first one of
the day. Other Stanford students
playing sevens this summer include
John Clark. Andrew Townsend and
Mike Velcich.
The next Sevens tournament in
Palo Alto will be held on Saturday,
July 16 at Greer Park from 8 a.m.
until dusk.
