# Women thrive at nearby international meet

### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
It usually takes some kind of
record to beat former Stanford
swimmer Tara Kirk in her specialty,
the 100-meter breaststroke. And
that's exactly what Irvine No
vaquatics swimmer Jessica Hardy
did two weekends ago at the Santa
Clara International Meet, where
she set a new meet record to win the
100 breast, a mere 0.25 seconds
ahead of Kirk.
Kirk was just one of several Stan
ford affiliates to compete in Santa

Clara from June 23 to 26 at one of
four legs in the Grand Prix circuit,
which leads up to the FINA World
Championships later this month in
Montreal. Teams flew in from
places as varied as Lebanon,
Guatemala, Malaysia and Poland to
compete in the meet, which includ
ed 531 athletes.
A 2004 Olympic medalist, Kirk
won the other breaststroke event,
the 200-meter race with a time of
2:30.04, more than a second ahead of
Japan's Asami Kitagawa.
Two other members of the Car
dinal swim squad competed with

the Palo Alto Stanford Aquatics
Club — rising senior Dana Kirk
and rising sophomore Brooke Bish
op. Kirk picked up a third place fin
ish in the 100-meter butterfly with a
time of 1:00.52, while taking sixth in
the 200 fly. Bishop placed fourth in
the 50-meter freestyle, seventh in
the 100 free and ninth in the 200
backstroke.
Distance free specialists Lauren
Costella and Desiree Stahley, both
rising juniors, placed ninth and sev
enth, respectively in the 1,500-meter
freestyle, while Stahley also placed
ninth in the 800 free.

The Stanford women were also
successful in the relay events.
Stahley, Bishop, Dana Kirk and
Katherine Wong took away a win in
the 800-free relay. Bishop chipped in
the team's fastest leg, a 2:05.84 split.
Both Kirks and Bishop also compet
ed on a fourth-place 400 medley
relay team, which touched in with a
total time of 4:11.54.
Rising senior Laura Davis — who
was competing in Santa Clara with
the Terrapins Swim Team — an
chored her team in the 400-free relay
and raced to a second place finish
with a time of 3:55.37.
