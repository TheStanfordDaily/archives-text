## The 						dish on summer hits, straight from the cornfields Get a 'Rize' out of 'Cake' 
### SCOTT HOWARD ART FILM AFFICIONADO 
As Hollywood complains about dwindling
theater attendance while trotting out "Herbie:
Fully Loaded" as this season's hot new release,
two smaller films are making waves with art
house devotees.
Over the past 15 years. David LaChapelle's
glossy, highly saturated style has made him one
of the world's best known and most talented
photographers. His iconic spreads in "Inter
view," "Vanity Fair" and "Rolling Stone" are
instantly identifiable, and lately he has directed
music videos for everyone from Elton John to
Christina Aguilera. His input on the big screen,
however, has been limited to a classic dis of
Dandy Warhols' front-man Courtney Taylor in
Ondi Timoner's "Dig."
That changes with his adventurous feature
directing debut "Rize." which is probably the
most gorgeous documentary ever made. It pro
files a dance phenomenon from the poorest
parts of Los Angeles called "krumping" that
LaChapelle saw for the first time while filming
Aguilera's "Dirrty" video (not his best work).
He knows his strengths and plays them up,
capturing his subjects with a distinct visual
identity that somehow seems glamorous and
raw simultaneously. He never speeds the film
up but sometimes slows it down so we can savor
their complicated, wildly kinetic moves.
"Rize" is far from flawless: LaChapelle
makes the mistake of trying to turn it into a
morally uplifting junior "Hoop Dreams" by in
jecting a rigid storyline, and it's always a little
odd when a white millionaire from Connecticut
tries to school us on the ghetto. But it's worth

noting that a still photographer as famous as
LaChapelle chose to make a motion picture
with an emphasis on the motion. He is liberat
ed by the format, and he shares the dizzying
freedom of the dancers he profiles.
Matthew Vaughn's "Layer Cake" has been
criticized as Guy Ritchie-lite, which is ridicu
lous because Vaughn, Ritchie's best friend/
producer / best man at his wedding to Madon-

na, is ten times the director
Ritchie is. "Lock. Stock
and Two Smoking Barrels"
caused a commotion when
it was released seven years
ago, and everyone tagged it
as the British answer to
"Pulp Fiction." "Lock
Stock" was a pleasant
enough diversion, but was
barely even that; nothing
distinguishes it from a hun
dred billion other crime ca
pers, and everything's tied
up so nice and neatly at the
end that I thought I was
watching a TV pilot (I kind
of was, since it launched a
short-lived series on the
BBC).
Ritchie's shortcomings

as a filmmaker were further proven when his
next movie, "Snatch," was a de facto remake of
his first movie to the point that the working title
was "Lock, Stock and Six Stolen Diamonds."
He was originally attached to direct "Layer
Cake," but aside from the fact that it has a lot
of criminals with British accents, they operate
in separate universes.

Like "Good Fellas" and"The Sopranos,"
"Layer Cake" is about how criminal life even
tually kills a person — literally, spiritually or
both — no matter how smart they are.
Vaughn's protagonist is an unnamed yuppie
coke dealer played by the fantastic Daniel
Craig with an alluring mix of dashing good
looks and disturbing amorality. Craig's charac

ter wants nothing more than to make a few mil
lion from his criminal enterprises and then set
tle into the mythical gangster retirement, but
he never quite grasps that the people he's deal
ing with aren't nearly as levelheaded or con
cerned about their 401K as he is.
Though its setting may be familiar, "Layer
Cake" isn't your typical neo-noir; it's shot in
bright, minimalist swatches that one would find
in Ikea, and no self-respecting genre film would
score its most violent scene with Duran
Duran's "Ordinary World." It rises above easy
description and becomes a fascinating study of
what happens when one tries to reason with un
reasonable people.
