# 'Worlds' is not worth saving

### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER FILM CRITIC 
The new millennium has been an interesting time for
Steven Spielberg. In the 90s he defined the blockbuster
with "Jurassic Park" and the modern epic with
"Schindler's List" in the same year, but then slipped into
a boring safe period filled with self-conscious importance
("Amistad," "Saving Private Ryan") and uninspired
cash-ins ("The Lost World").
His movies in this decade are fascinating onscreen
battles of art and commerce that grapple with dark new
material but cop out at the last possible second to deliver
what he thinks a mainstream audience wants to see.
In essence, he's getting $200 million budgets to make
hit-or-miss experimental films that flirt with greatness
before crashing to the ground in utterly disastrous third
acts or, more specifically, addendums to third acts. Here,
the movies reach their logical conclusions, but Spielberg
keeps them going in order to give us happy endings so
saccharine and unconvincing that we leave the theater
shaking our heads in disbelief and wondering what the
hell he was thinking ("Minority Report," "A.1.").
But that kind of ramshackle adventurousness excites
me. In fact, I would make the controversial contention
that Spielberg is making some of the most interesting
work of his career (except for"The Terminal" â€” I don't
know what he was going for with that one).
"War of The Worlds" clearly follows in this vein. The
movie loses steam in the last 30 minutes, though it's never
flat-out terrible. The problems begin when Tim Robbins,

recycling his Oscar-winning role in "Mystic River,"
shows up in a small but pivotal but deleted-scene-worthy
role as a weirdo who shelters Tom Cruise and his family
after aliens have decimated most of the world.
I'm not quite sure what purpose his character serves be
yond the whole "humans are bad too" thing that derailed
the similarly apocalyptic "28 Days Later," but nothing re
ally works after he appears. I was especially irked by a

Justin Chatwin is a poor man's Frodo Baggins in Steven
Spielberg's rendition of "Worlds."
