# 'Worlds' is not worth saving
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER FILM CRITIC 
The new millennium has been an interesting time for
Steven Spielberg. In the 90s he defined the blockbuster
with "Jurassic Park" and the modern epic with
"Schindler's List" in the same year, but then slipped into
a boring safe period filled with self-conscious importance
("Amistad," "Saving Private Ryan") and uninspired
cash-ins ("The Lost World").
His movies in this decade are fascinating onscreen
battles of art and commerce that grapple with dark new
material but cop out at the last possible second to deliver
what he thinks a mainstream audience wants to see.
In essence, he's getting $200 million budgets to make
hit-or-miss experimental films that flirt with greatness
before crashing to the ground in utterly disastrous third
acts or, more specifically, addendums to third acts. Here,
the movies reach their logical conclusions, but Spielberg
keeps them going in order to give us happy endings so
saccharine and unconvincing that we leave the theater
shaking our heads in disbelief and wondering what the
hell he was thinking ("Minority Report," "A.1.").
But that kind of ramshackle adventurousness excites
me. In fact, I would make the controversial contention
that Spielberg is making some of the most interesting
work of his career (except for"The Terminal" — I don't
know what he was going for with that one).
"War of The Worlds" clearly follows in this vein. The
movie loses steam in the last 30 minutes, though it's never
flat-out terrible. The problems begin when Tim Robbins,

recycling his Oscar-winning role in "Mystic River,"
shows up in a small but pivotal but deleted-scene-worthy
role as a weirdo who shelters Tom Cruise and his family
after aliens have decimated most of the world.
I'm not quite sure what purpose his character serves be
yond the whole "humans are bad too" thing that derailed
the similarly apocalyptic "28 Days Later," but nothing re
ally works after he appears. I was especially irked by a

quiet chase sequence that was com
pletely stolen from"The Abyss,"
mainly because Spielberg lifted the
exact same scene for "Minority Re
port."
Still, the film doesn't cross over
from misguided to embarrassing
until the very last scene, which is the
most illogical finale Spielberg has
come up with yet.
The first two acts, though, make
"War of The Worlds" essential sum
mer viewing material. I whine a lot
about how horrible movie theaters
are and how I prefer watching DVDs
at home, but some films must be seen
in the theater, preferably with as
many people as possible, and this is
one of them.
There's a communal sense of un

ease we can only get from watching
an event movie with a crowd. When
the aliens first attack, the shock and
awe is so intense that we forget we're
watching crazy oF Tom Cruise and
feel like we've tuned in for live news
coverage.
It's the most impressive scene of
its kind due to its obvious reference
point, the T-Rex intro from "Juras
sic Park" — waves of total destruc
tion lashing out in every direction,
seeming to emanate from a single,
terrifying roar (in this case, a clever
reproduction of the signal from
Orson Welles' immortal radio
play).
In a lot of ways, this is Spielberg's
9/11 film, continuing a political
awareness streak that has run
through his recent work. Recasting
H.G. Wells' 107-year-old novel as a
metaphor for the World Trade Cen
ter attacks is less of a stretch than it
sounds: underground "aliens" who
have dwelled in our nation for years
suddenly rise up to destroy us, using

weapons that turn thousands of peo
ple into dust instantly and then re
make our home to their liking.
The final message — wait it out
and eventually, everything will be
OK because we've earned a right to
be here — is a little murky and more
than a little naive, but the explosions
before all that stuff are really cool.
Spielberg has been working at a
breakneck pace lately, like he's
building towards something big.
He's currently filming another 9/11-
inspired film about Israel's response
to the murders at the 1972 Munich
Olympics and developing an Abra
ham Lincoln biopic starring Liam
Neeson. Spielberg will start shooting
this work immediately after the Mu
nich film wraps.
It's rare to see a filmmaker of
Spielberg's stature breaking out of
his comfort zone almost 40 years into
a career, and despite the fact that his
newest films are the most uneven he
has ever made, I can't wait to see
what he does next.
