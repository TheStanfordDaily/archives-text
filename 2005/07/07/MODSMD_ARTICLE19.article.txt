### TAM VO SUMMER FASHION POLICE CHIEF 
Intermission has always prided it
self on having impeccable taste when
it comes to film, music and the arts.
We also pride ourselves on never
falling prey to whatever horrors the
retail fashion industry throws at us.
From the geniuses who brought you
two years of "peasant chic" comes...
BOHO CHIC! Or. BOHO VIN
TAGE! VINTAGE CONTEMPO
RARY! HOBO CHIC!
FASHION INDUSTRY GENIUS
No. 1: "Brilliant! That way we can
save on all the surplus lace we
bought to trim the trashy
peasant/frowsy blouses from 2003
and just use it to trim the cheap flow
ery print distressed bleached
camisoles and tank tops that'll be in
this season! Those peons won't
know what hit them! They'll pay
$29.99 for the rags I wouldn't even
wipe my ass with!"

FXG. No. t "Holy crap! You're a
genius! You know how crinkle cut
fries were so popular in the rnid-9()s
because we promised a crispier fry?
Well, the idiots who buy our clothes
will totally lap up crinkled cotton and
satin shirts! Tunics, camisoles, tees,
you name it. Everyone from Bebe to
BCBG Max Azria. Because wrinkles
are the new pleats. Who said looking
like the local bag lady wasn't cou
ture? Juicy Couture followers always
look like colorful trash. Oh, and trim
it with some of the leftover lace. If
you?re gonna wear a shirt that makes
you look like a sack of potatoes, you
want some trimming."
F.I.G. No. 1: "And think of all the
multi-tiered sheer cotton skirts with
eyelet hems and cheap lining that we
can churn out...if we leave everything
with UNFINISHED HEMS! Holy
crap, do you know how much faster
that will make production? Loose
