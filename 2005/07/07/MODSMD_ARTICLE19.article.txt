# Fashion Police Memo: Drop the gauchos!

### TAM VO SUMMER FASHION POLICE CHIEF 
Intermission has always prided it
self on having impeccable taste when
it comes to film, music and the arts.
We also pride ourselves on never
falling prey to whatever horrors the
retail fashion industry throws at us.
From the geniuses who brought you
two years of "peasant chic" comes...
BOHO CHIC! Or. BOHO VIN
TAGE! VINTAGE CONTEMPO
RARY! HOBO CHIC!
FASHION INDUSTRY GENIUS
No. 1: "Brilliant! That way we can
save on all the surplus lace we
bought to trim the trashy
peasant/frowsy blouses from 2003
and just use it to trim the cheap flow
ery print distressed bleached
camisoles and tank tops that'll be in
this season! Those peons won't
know what hit them! They'll pay
$29.99 for the rags I wouldn't even
wipe my ass with!"

FXG. No. t "Holy crap! You're a
genius! You know how crinkle cut
fries were so popular in the rnid-9()s
because we promised a crispier fry?
Well, the idiots who buy our clothes
will totally lap up crinkled cotton and
satin shirts! Tunics, camisoles, tees,
you name it. Everyone from Bebe to
BCBG Max Azria. Because wrinkles
are the new pleats. Who said looking
like the local bag lady wasn't cou
ture? Juicy Couture followers always
look like colorful trash. Oh, and trim
it with some of the leftover lace. If
you?re gonna wear a shirt that makes
you look like a sack of potatoes, you
want some trimming."
F.I.G. No. 1: "And think of all the
multi-tiered sheer cotton skirts with
eyelet hems and cheap lining that we
can churn out...if we leave everything
with UNFINISHED HEMS! Holy
crap, do you know how much faster
that will make production? Loose

threads dangling everrrywheeeeereee!
And we won't have to clean it up, ei
ther? Any scraps of fabric and thread
clinging to the finished product will just
add extra boho appeal, because bo
hemians can't be bothered with things
like matching buttons or irons! Hell, I
don't even think they know how to fold
their own clothes!"
FJ.G. No. 2: "This will be bigger than
bodysuits and stirrup leggings. I mean,
we brought Lacoste back from the
dead. We won?t even have to tailor any
of our pleather bags and totes anymore!
We?ll just call them hobo bags! Slouchy
and shapeless is the new tailored and fit
ted. Are you thinking what I'm think
ing?"
FJ.G. No. 1: "Marc Jacobs suede flats
the color of week-old mustard with sil
ver plastic hearts pasted all over them!
Macrame everything! On your feet!
Embellished and ethnic-looking es
padrilles and ballet flats that jingle and
blow whistles when you walk! If you
stare hard enough at the crazy beading,
I think shapes pop out like Magic Eye
3D. Is that a sailboat?"
FJ.G. No. 2: "No, you dipshit, we can
can get away with worse."
FJ.G. No. 1: "GAUCHOS?!"
FJ.G. No. 2: "Precisely. We will un
leash the bastard child of sweatpants
and linen trousers on the Urban-Outfit
ters worshipping masses. Maybe we can
even get Isaac Mizrahi to design some
for Target out of leftover lampshade
fabric. We'll coin the word 'fabulocity'
just for that!"
FJ.G. No. 1: "By Jove, I think you've
got it!"
F.I.G. No. 2: "It'll be more rampant
than the Uggs and miniskirt virus we

unleashed upon the nation last year.
More übiquitous than pictures of
Mary Kate carrying Coffee Bean
blended mochas while wearing
enough clothes for 2.5 people. We'll
make them in pseudo-linen, fleece,
wrinkly velvet, whatever's on sale."
FJ.G. No. 1: "But they're supposed to
resemble a skirt, no? If the point of the
wide-legged look is to have no separa
tion between the pant legs, what do
people do when their pant legs refuse to
stick together?"
FJ.G. No. 2: "Wear a sparkly sequined
bolero to draw attention away from the
lower source of embarrassment. Shiny
anything. When in doubt, make it
metallic. Anything is better than the
plaid pancake beret with the hideous
green bow Mischa Barton stole from
leprechauns in the last season of 'The
O.C.'. Obviously."
What's next? Fashion stolen straight
from the Amish? Prints inspired by the
colors of horse drawn buggies that
evoke afternoon barn raisings? For
more tips on what not to wear, head to
