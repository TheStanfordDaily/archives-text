Ever wanted to live in New
York fora summer? Well, if you're
reading this article from FloMo
dining you sure as hell blew that
one. At any rate, whether you're
serving as a camp counselor, con
ducting research for your profes
sor, or taking extra classes at Santa
Clara, this article will provide a
glimpse into the life you could have
had. But rather than describe life in
the city, I figured I could describe
what would happen if Stanford be
came more like the city. Intriguing,
you're thinking— now what
would that be like? Well, if Stan
ford was like New York:
Every intersection would be the
Intersection of Death.
Your bike would be stolen un

less you had the 'Fahgettaboudit'
bicycle lock. Three feet and three
inches in length, the 'Fahget
taboudit' is, in the manufacturer's
words, the "ultimate bicycle secu
rity for urban areas and other high
theft danger areas." Featuring
11mm, six-sided, hexagonal
chains made of triple heat-treated
boron manganese steel, it comes
with a $3,5(X) anti-theft protection
offer and weights 8.4 lbs. Good
god.
The police blotter would have
slightly more serious entries than
"door shut too hard" (2/1/04) or
"scratched words on metal bath
room paper dispenser" (5/17/05).
The Oval would be the only
patch of green on all of campus. All
other grass would be razed in favor
of high-rises, office buildings and
Old Navy.
Donald Trump would purchase
Hoover Tower, convert it to a five
star hotel, and host a Stanford ver
sion of the Apprentice from his
penthouse office. Participants
would include Hennessy, Bravman
and other prominent administra
tors vying fora shot to be the

Trump's bitch.
Late Night would be open until
4 a.m. However, the guy at the
counter won't take your order un
less you decide in five seconds or
less. No smoothie for you!
It would take a lot more than a
Stanford ID to get into that Sigma
Chi party. Rather than wink your
way in, a very large bouncer would
first size you up. If you didn't make
the cut there would suddenly be a
$50 cover charge. All for beer
worse than the stuff my neighbor
brewed sophomore year.
The Marguerite would operate
24 hours a day, seven days a week.
However, it would smell like crap
and pesky tourists would constant
ly be asking you how to get to
White Plaza.
A large Cup Noodles sign, com
plete with fake noodle steam,
would adorn the clocktower.
The NetAppetit truck by
Tresidder would serve nothing but
falafel.
And there you have it. If this
didn't inspire you to check out the
Big Apple sometime in the near fu
ture, I don't know what will.
