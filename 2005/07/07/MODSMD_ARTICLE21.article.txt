# Thousands turn out to support gay rights in city
## Pride Parade fills streets of San Francisco 
### SIMON SHUSTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 35th annual San Francisco Pride
Parade filled one of the city's main thor
oughfares on June 26 in celebration of the
Bay Area's diverse and thriving gay com
munity. This year's motto: "Stand up, stand
out, stand proud!"'
Tourism officials were expecting around
500,000 parade-goers to visit San Francisco
this weekend, and hotels and hostels were
booked throughout the city. The SF Pride
Web site boasted that over 1 million people
were set to attend.
The parade itself — which started on
Beale Street at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday and con
tinued along Market Street to Bth Street —
consisted of over 10,000 people, some dressed
in drag, others riding elaborate floats and
throwing candy and condoms into the crowds
that lined the street.
A procession of 600 members of the group
Dykes on Bikes kicked things off, and was fol
lowed by over 200 floats, convertible cars and
other parade contingents.
At the end of the parade route, celebra
tions were in full swing. On the main stage,
musical groups like En Vogue and Third
Eye Blind entertained fans until late into
the evening.
Although San Francisco police made an
effort to guard the parade, their presence was
minimal. Alcoholic drinks were served, and
the smells of barbeque pits mingled with the
odor of marijuana smoke.
But the tone and purpose of the parade
was not fun and games for everyone. In light
of recent debate over same-sex marriage,
which is still illegal in 48 states, many atten
dees saw the events as symbolizing the
ongoing struggle to secure equal rights for
gay Americans.
Joe Messenberg, a marcher who wore a
bridal veil to the parade, said, "It's really
about reminding people that there is still a

long way to go...we can have as many parades
as we want, but we still don't really have full
rights as citizens."
Many cities around the world celebrate
gay rights with parades and festivals.
Brazil's San Paolo Gay Parade made inter
national headlines last month by attracting
over 2 million people, one of the largest
turnouts in the history of such events. Last
year, Germany hosted the world gay pride
day celebrations, where hundreds of thou
sands of people crowded a parade route
through Berlin.
Germany recognizes same-sex marriages,
but does not yet allow gay couples to adopt.
Brazil, in spite of its Catholic traditions, has
granted limited rights to homosexual unions.
"It's like we're stuck in the Stone Age over
here," Messenberg said. "Everybody sees
that we should have rights, but over here we
can't see it."
