### KATIE BEARMAN NEWS EDITOR 
As members of the United Nations converged
in San Francisco to celebrate the organization's
60th anniversary', or UN6O, on June 25 and 26,
Stanford also had its fair share of distinguished
world leaders roaming around campus.
Among other high profile individuals, former
secretaries of state Robert McNamara and
William Perry, as well as former president of
Ireland Mary Robinson, gathered at the Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center from June 21 to June
25 for the 23rd meeting of the Inter Action Council,
or lAC, and the World Leaders Summit, or WLS,
said Sally Bachman. director of communications
for the Saga Foundation — a Menlo Park-based
organization that helped host the WLS.
The Saga Foundation, founded in the 1980s, is
affiliated with the Stanford Institute for
International Studies, or SIIS, Bachman said.
While the two meetings were separate events,
some former heads of state and other political fig
ures participated in both, Bachman told The Daily.
While both events united political leaders
and other experts to address global problems,
the lAC meeting was open only to former heads
of state that are members of the organization
and a small number of invited guests.
Participants in the WLS included various heads
of state as well as members of 12 independent
organizations, Bachman explained. Although
the WLS took place for the first time this year,
it involved more people than the lAC meeting.
All participants in the lAC meeting and the
WI.S were invited to the UN6O celebration, also a

separate event. Not all attended, Bachman added.
The Hoover Institution was the on-campas
sponsor for the lAC meeting, according to
Bachman. Founded in Japan in 1983, the IAC
seeks to bring together former heads of state from
democratic countries to address peace and security;
world economic revitalization; and universal ethical
standards, according to the council's Web site.
At a dinner held on June 21 for the IAC,
Stanford Provost John Etchemendy spoke about
the ways in which Stanford — and.in particular,
the SI IS — supports and encourages the lAC's
efforts.
He said that the issues facing the world today
represent an intermingling of issues and thus defy'
traditional problem-solving approaches. A new,
interdisciplinary approach to education is needed,
and SI IS is attempting to cultivate diverse, inter
national viewpoints and solutions, he added.
Etchemendy said that University founders Jane
and Leland Stanford were widely traveled and
worldly for their time. Dealing with international
issues is what they would have wanted, he said.
With the recent launch of Stanford's
International Initiative — a $1(X) million cam
paign to create interdisciplinary professorships
and endow the directorship of the SIIS, accord
ing to the Stanford News Service — the
University has indicated its dedication to
resolving global problems creatively.
While the specific agenda of the 2005 lAC was
not made available to the public, Bachman told
The Daily that the WLS mainly addressed issues of
growing economic inequality and the proliferation
