# Mithcell to join Cancer Center
## 
### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
Beverly Mitchell, former deputy director of
the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill's
Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center,
joined the Stanford faculty on July 1 as the deputy
director of Stanford's proposed Comprehensive
Cancer Center.
"Dr. Mitchell will play a key role in helping to
shape the scientific agenda and in fostering an
environment that stimulates translational
research — and that employs scientific discovery
and innovation to shape the diagnosis and treat
ment of cancer patients," said Philip Pizzo, dean
of the School of Medicine.

Her recruitment is part of Stanford's ongoing
effort to become designated as a Comprehensive
Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute.
The benefits of earning this distinction are
manifold. Achieving NCl's recognition would
enhance the prestige of the Stanford cancer cen
ter and would help attract more cancer experts
and NCI funding.
"Being NCI designated carries the distinction
of having met rigorous peer review approval as an
outstanding cancer center," Pizzo said.
Prior to joining the UNC faculty in 1991,
Mitchell was a fellow at the University of Zurich
and the University of Michigan. She received her
BA from Smith College in 1965 and
graduated from Harvard Medical
School in 1969. Mitchell also served as
the President of the American Society
of Hematology. She was awarded the
honor of being a member of the
Institute of Medicine of the National

Academy of Sciences in 2001 for her
distinguished academic career.
According to Pizzo, Mitchell's
experience overseeing UNC's
Comprehensive Cancer Center for 11
years and her accomplishments in the
field made her the perfect candidate
for the job.
Pizzo said Stanford has been work
ing hard to live up to NCl's standards
and expectations for more than two
years. The preparation included two
external reviews that were carried out
to estimate the progress toward meet
ing the rigorous requirements. Pizzo
also said Stanford has been preparing a
1,600-page proposal that would pro
vide "the scientific justification for nine
major projects that range from basic
research to clinical science and popula

tion-based science and cancer preven
tion research proposals."
"Also included will be more than a
dozen laboratory-based shared ser
vices or research cores that will sup
port the work of the faculty and inves
tigators in the Comprehensive Cancer
Center," he added
Despite the rigorous application
process, the effort is deemed to be
worthwhile since "it is helping to
sharpen and refine our science and
clinical proposals," Pizzo said.
The Stanford Cancer Center is dis
tinguished from existing comprehen
sive cancer centers across the nation
due to its focus on innovation and dis
covery, he added.
"We look forward to the next
stages and recognize the important
challenges that lie ahead," he said.
