## Stanford alumna steps down O'Connor resigns from Supreme Court 
### JUSTIN HELLER STAFF WRITER 
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first
woman appointed to the nation's highest court, announced
her resignation last Friday, surprising many politicians who
have anticipated the departure of ailing Chief Justice
William Rehnquist. Both O'Connor and Rehnquist gradu
ated from Stanford Law School, with Rehnquist ranking
first and O'Connor third in the Class of 1952.
Since her arrival on the court in 1981, O'Connor has
proved pivotal on issues including affirmative action, the
death penalty and religion. Most notably, her vote reaf
firmed Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case permitting women
the right to an abortion.
O'Connor's resignation will grant President
George W. Bush his first chance to alter the structure
of the Supreme Court, which has remained unchanged
for 11 years.
Some students on campus have expressed concern
about the president's impending nomination.
"If evil is replaced by evil then everything cancels,"
said senior David Louk. "If a moderate swing-vote is
replaced by evil then that is a net loss."
Other students expressed enthusiasm about the
opportunity presented by the vacancy.
"Every person that leaves the Supreme Court, that's
another nomination that Bush can put in," remarked ris
ing junior Brice Rolsten.
O'Connor will not officially leave the court until a
successor has been nominated by the president and

confirmed by the U.S. Senate. However, Bush will like
ly postpone his decision until after his trip to Denmark
and Scotland this week, during which time he will
review possible nominees. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-
Penn.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
has been invited to the White House to speak on
O'Connor's replacement as well, according to a July 2
article in The New York Times.
"The nation deserves, and I will select, a Supreme
Court justice that Americans can be proud of," Bush
said in the article.
At the same time, the president cautioned the sen
ate, particularly its Democratic contingent, which has
used filibusters to block 10 of Bush's nominees for fed
eral appeals courts.
"The nation also deserves a dignified process of
confirmation in the United States Senate, character
ized by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote."
Bush added.
