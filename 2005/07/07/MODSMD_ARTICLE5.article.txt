# Apple Computer CEO speaks on twists of fate
## Jobs addresses '05 graduates 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Stanford's 114 th Commencement kicked
off with an ad hoc game of kick ball — not to
mention ape-masked ballerinas and a flock of
speedo-clad swimmers. The traditional
Wacky Walk gave the June 12 ceremony a
frolicky tone, which continued throughout
Apple Computer co-founder and Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs' short address
and the conferral of degrees.
Jobs, who donned blue jeans and sandals
underneath his somber robe, offered the audi
ence of 23,(KM) advice based on his own expe
riences, from his adoption at birth to his
recent battle with pancreatic cancer. His
keynote was broken into three distinct parts,
each detailing a seemingly negative event in
his life that proved beneficial.
Leading with his decision to drop out of
Reed College in Portland, Ore., Jobs, 50, said
that his speech was the closest he had ever been
to a college graduation. While he decided to
drop out to save his parents money and pursue
interests outside of the classroom, he admitted
that his future had never seemed less certain,
and that only now, looking back, does the
choice make perfect sense.
"Trust that the dots will somehow connect

in your future," Jobs told the Qass of 2005.
"You have to trust in something — your gut,
destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach
has never let me down, and it has made all the
difference in my life."
At age 20, he founded Apple Computer
with Steve Wozniak. Ten years later, it had
grown into a $2 billion company with 4,000
employees.
Jobs' second anecdote centered on his forced
resignation from the corporation in 1985, an ini
tial shock that led to what he called one of the
most creative periods of his life.
"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that
getting fired from Apple was the best thing
that could have ever happened to me," he said.
"The heaviness of being successful was
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner
again, less sure about everything."
After his departure, he founded NeXT
Software, Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios,
which went on to produce the popular Disney
films "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo." In
1997, Apple bought NeXT, and Jobs found him
self at the company's helm once again. Jobs
remains CEO of Pixar as well.
The last segment of his speech focused on his
brush with death last year, when he was diag-
nosed with pancreatic cancer. He was
told that he had six months to live.
"My doctor told me to go home
and get my affairs in order, which is
doctor's code for prepare to die,"
Jobs said. "It means to try to tell
your kids everything you thought
you'd have the next 10 years to tell
them in just a few months. It means
to make sure everything is buttoned
up so that it will be as easy as possi
ble for your family. It means to say
your goodbyes."
When doctors determined the can
cer to be a unique, curable form, they
operated immediately and Jobs recov
ered speedily, embracing the lessons
he gleaned from the experience.
"Your time is limited, so don't
waste it living someone else's life," he
told the graduates. "Don't be trapped
by dogma — which is living with the
results of other people's thinking.
Don't let the noise of others' opinions
drown out your inner voice."
In his introduction of Jobs,

University President John Hennessy
said the CEO was a perfect com
mencement speaker, embodying the
very spirit of the University with his
willingness to "be bold and strike out
in new directions."
He also followed Jobs keynote
address with remarks about Jane
Stanford, her character and persever
ance in the founding of the University.
"Stanford is committed to keep
ing the spirit envisioned by Jane and
Leland Stanford alive and instilling it
in the generations of students who
pass this way," Hennessy said. "And
so, I hope that you leave this campus
with a strong reservoir of the
Stanford spirit, a reservoir that will
grow over the years."
The University awarded a total of
1,782 bachelor's degrees, 2,026 mas
ter's degrees and 904 doctoral
degrees, the Stanford News Service
reported. Of the undergraduates. 388
received departmental honors, and
294 received distinction.
The commencement ceremony
capped off a weekend of planned
events, including the opening
Baccalaureate ceremony, a multifaith
religious celebration, and the senior
class luncheon.
