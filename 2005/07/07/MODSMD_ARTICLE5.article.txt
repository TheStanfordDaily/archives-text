# Apple Computer CEO speaks on twists of fate
## Jobs addresses '05 graduates 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Stanford's 114 th Commencement kicked
off with an ad hoc game of kick ball — not to
mention ape-masked ballerinas and a flock of
speedo-clad swimmers. The traditional
Wacky Walk gave the June 12 ceremony a
frolicky tone, which continued throughout
Apple Computer co-founder and Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs' short address
and the conferral of degrees.
Jobs, who donned blue jeans and sandals
underneath his somber robe, offered the audi
ence of 23,(KM) advice based on his own expe
riences, from his adoption at birth to his
recent battle with pancreatic cancer. His
keynote was broken into three distinct parts,
each detailing a seemingly negative event in
his life that proved beneficial.
Leading with his decision to drop out of
Reed College in Portland, Ore., Jobs, 50, said
that his speech was the closest he had ever been

most creative periods of his life.
"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that
getting fired from Apple was the best thing
that could have ever happened to me," he said.
"The heaviness of being successful was
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner
again, less sure about everything."
After his departure, he founded NeXT
Software, Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios,
which went on to produce the popular Disney
films "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo." In
1997, Apple bought NeXT, and Jobs found him
self at the company's helm once again. Jobs
remains CEO of Pixar as well.
