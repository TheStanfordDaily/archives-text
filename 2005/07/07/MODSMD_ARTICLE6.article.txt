Richard Shaw, dean of admis
sions and financial aid at Yale
University will replace Robin
Mamlet as Stanford's new dean of
admissions and financial aid effec
tive Sept. 1,2005.
Mamlet, who came to Stanford
from Swarthmore College five
years ago, announced her decision
to leave in September and depart
ed campus on June 1 to spend
more time with her family. She
remained active at her post
throughout the 2004-2005 acade
mic year.
"Shaw has extensive experi
ence in admissions and financial
aid at several public and private
institutions," said John Bravman,
vice provost for undergraduate
education and co-chair of commit
tee charged with finding a replace
ment. "He has established an
excellent record of success, and
has all of the personal qualities we
seek in one of Stanford's most vis
ible representatives."
Shaw told The Stanford
Report that he has been respect
fully aware of Stanford's excep
tional educational opportunities
for his entire career.
"I am thrilled to have the
opportunity to join the communi

ty, especially the admission and
financial aid staff, and excited to
work with faculty, staff and stu
dents to develop outreach and
admissions programs," he said.
"Identifying and selecting the
Stanford incoming class is one of
the best opportunities in the coun
try, and I look forward to the chal
lenge."
Shaw, who boasts 33 years of
experience in undergraduate
admissions, arrives during a peri
od of steady growth in the number
of students applying to Stanford.
For the first time in the
University's history, the total
number of applications for the
class of 2009 rose above 20,000.
Accordingly, the admit rate was
lower than ever, with just under 12
percent of the 12,194 applicants
admitted.
According to Provost John
Etchemendy, who was also
involved in the search fora new
dean, Shaw's experience at other
top universities distinguished him
from other candidates for the
position.
"Rick Shaw offers proven
experience in several areas of vital
importance to Stanford, including
creating a diverse student body,"
he said. "He also knows the
challenges involved in
selective admissions, in
making the case for the lib
eral arts and for ensuring
that higher education is
accessible to everyone."
Shaw has led Yale's
undergraduate admissions
and financial aid office
since 1993. Beforehand, he
was appointed director of
admissions at the
University of Michigan
from 1988 to 1993, and
associate director of admis
sions and records at UC-
from 1983-1988.
In addition to a bache
lor's degree from
Dartmouth College and a
master's degree in college
student personnel, guid
ance and counseling from
the School of Education at
the University of Colorado,
Boulder, he is a member of
a number of national
admissions groups, includ
ing the College Board and
the American Association
of Collegiate Registrars
and Admissions Officers.
According to Bravman,
Shaw will be responsible a
host of duties as dean.
"Shaw will hold full
responsibility for all fresh
man and transfer admis
sions, financial aid deci
sions and for recruiting and
yielding each new class of
students," he said. "He will
supervise the staffs of
Admissions, Financial Aid
and Visitor Information
Services and will serve on
the University Cabinet.
This is all quite similar to
his post at Yale."
