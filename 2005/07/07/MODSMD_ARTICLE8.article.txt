## A 						Guy's Take Maybe she's into you... 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
Or maybe she's not. Perhaps she was into
you and now she's changed her mind. Possibly
she'll rediscover her enthusiasm next Tuesday,
though it's equally likely that she'll decide it
was your roommate she actually wanted.
On the other hand, I could be completely
wrong. Possibly it's her friend that's into you —
she too will probably have the standard weekly
fluctuations before you find out that the two
are actually dating and that you never had a

chance in the first place.
There is a chance, of
course, that the line she spun
about having to deal with
her ex-boyfriend was, in
fact, true. Thus at some
point in the future she will
receive your attentions glad
ly. Needless to say no one
will inform you when this oc
curs, and should your psy-

chic powers fail you at the crucial moment,
well, tough.
Women are a complete mystery. I find
this rather bothersome. This is largely be
cause I like to kid myself that everything in
life follows neat rules of rationality —
human behavior included. I suppose this
may seem a little hopeful, but everyone has
their dreams.
The reason I'm dwelling on such an intel
lectual topic this week is that I've recently had
the opportunity to glance over and discuss a
wonderful little tome, "He's Just Not That
Into You: The No Excuses Truth to Under
standing Guys."
The book is a treatise on the male psyche
compiled by two writers from that marvelous
television program "Sex in the City." Since
said program was acclaimed for its probing in
sights into the lives and minds of modern
women (albeit only that vanishingly small sec
tion of modern women with high-flying, well
paid and not at all time-consuming New York

jobs) one assumes the book is full of conse
quent insights.
Such assumptions, 1 am reliably informed,
would be justified; though I must confess a lit
tle surprise that the surface simplicity of men
would come as a shock to anyone.
To write similar words on women, though
— now that would be something. To find the
threads of meaning in the apparent insanity
that cloaks the human female. To seek the
mysterious truth that... Yes, well, before I get
too carried away with this metaphorical non
sense, I suppose I should stop, you probably
get the idea by now.
Sadly, however, it seems that the female of
the species is beyond pocket-sized analysis,
which leaves us seeking alternative paths
through the feminine mystique. Luckily, I
have one in mind.
Life would be much simpler if women did
all the work. You know — the asking out, the
seduction, the first move, all that jazz. The rea
son for this is simple — men are easy. Really,
we make sense. There's a firm relationship be
tween what men think and what they say.
For example, should you ask a man out, you
can be confident of a strong connection be
tween his interest in you and his reply. Women,
on the other hand, appear to correlate their re
sponses with the phases of the moon.
Actually, that's a little unfair for the
phases of the moon. They at least follow a
regular pattern. What's more, at least...
Hmmm. I seem to find myself running out of
words before this diatribe can truly go full
throttle. Perhaps a more contrite sentiment
is in order.
Generally speaking, blissfully ignorant
stereotyping is to be frowned upon — espe
cially from our lofty academic heights. Some
times, though, you can't help but feel that
stereotypes just might exist fora reason.

However, if you know the secret to female be
havior don't tell me. Instead publish a book
and make a million.
