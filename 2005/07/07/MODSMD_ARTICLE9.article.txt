# Senior Column
## How The Daily no longer sucks 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE INNOVATION EDITOR EMERITUS 
Editor's Note: Due to a technical error, this se
nior farewell column was left out of The Daily's
commencement issu, published on June 10.
When I was a freshman, I signed up to join
The Daily staff. I talked to a bunch of Daily
people, went to an orientation session and
even e-mailed an editor or two. No one got
back to me. So I joined KZSU (the one and
only and wonderful Stanford radio station),
tried not to cry and tattooed "The Daily sucks"
on my butt (next to the names of several men
who have spurned me).
But this year, on a whim, I decided to
knock on The Daily's door again, willing to let
bygones be bygones. And suddenly, as a
super-senior-coterm. 1 found myself editing
the Innovation page, stuffing my face while

still standing in the junk food closet and
schmoozing with Cynthia and friends.
And thanks to my reconciliation with The
Daily, I've gone through a billion diet Snap
pies (a billion dollars but zero calories), sev
eral tattoo removal procedures (two thou
sand dollars) and a weird year working with
Daily writers and editors (priceless). So in the
end it all worked out.
Despite the brevity of this column (which is
aptly proportional to the amount of time I
spent in the Storke Publications Building), I
think there are several important morals to
know, which I will now divulge:
1) Some things are better late than never
— which also applies to term papers.
2) Tattoos can be removed.
And 3) you can do it all at Stanford —
you'll just need five or six or seven years and
an extraneous degree or two.
