In the bathroom and beyond:
• Report dripping sinks and running toilets to your
Housing Supervisor or by calling 3-2281 for
academic buildings.
• Don't flush trash down the toilet.
• Minimize time spent in the shower.
• Fill the basin rather than leave the water running
while shaving.
• Take your car to a local carwash (they will capture
and re-use the water) instead of washing it yourself.
• Contact us for more information, water-saving tips,
and answers to frequently asked questions.
