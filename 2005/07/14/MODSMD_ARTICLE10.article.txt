## Co-op college for me 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
College strikes me as a hybrid of a finishing
school and a training ground for the work
place. The true purposes of attending seem to
be to pick up sufficient cultural knowledge
and to seem "educated," obtaining the stamp

of a member of the educated
class — demonstrating to
potential employers not only
your ability to work but also
your willingness to cater to
authority and sacrifice sleep,
friendships and other inter
ests for delayed and arbi
trary rewards.
But what do we really want
colleges to do or to provide?

1) It would be nice if college was less expen
sive. Tuition refund schedules show that each
day of class at Stanford costs at least $132, de
pending on the quarter. Then there are addi
tional costs like room and board.
2) It would be nice if students could study
what they liked, instead of feeling like they
merely were jumping through hoops and satis
fying requirements.
3) It would be nice if students weren't
rushed and if they could pursue friendships and
non-academic interests without feeling like
they were wasting their education.
4) It would be nice if students appreciat
ed their teachers' efforts. Teaching a few
classes themselves would show them how
much work goes into teaching. Professors
were once students themselves, but taking
courses in new subjects, along with students,
would let them show a little humility and
emphasize to students that there's always
more to learn.
5) It would be nice if students worked. Col
lege as we know it has a hedonistic side and en
courages self-centeredness, since the main
goals seem to be pleasure and building one's
transcript and resume. Working, as Stanford
co-op members might agree, would engender
an ethic of service.
6) It would be wonderful if people could re

main at college for as long as they liked, and if
anyone who wanted to be a professor could be
one. The intellectual environment of colleges is
so difficult to find elsewhere that it's unfortu
nate that tuition is a limiting factor for many
students, and faculty openings are a limiting
factor for many aspiring professors.
Perhaps we could provide all of this with col
lege co-ops.
As with a housing or food co-op, college
co-ops could exist without employees if stu
dents provided the labor. Co-op members
would be students as well as teachers, tutors,
maintenance workers and gardeners (grow
ing the college's food). Even the most erudite
of professors could continue taking courses,
and even after decades at the college, there
still would be new courses to take since stu
dents would generate new student-taught
courses. Teachers would be students, and stu
dents would be teachers: Paolo Freire would
be happy.
Besides cutting costs and allowing members
to remain as students / teachers for as long as
they liked, having students provide labor would
contribute to a stronger work ethic.
Most notably, being able to stay at a co-op
college for as long as one liked would enable a
sort of free, unhurried inquiry that Herman
Hesse describes in his novel, The Glass Bead
Game: "The student may dabble in all sorts of
fields, combine the widest variety of subjects,
fall in love with six or eight disciplines simulta
neously, or confine himself to a narrower selec
tion from the beginning. For semesters or years
he may, if he pleases, merely make use of the li
braries and listen to lectures."
People often say that college is the best time
in life — why, then, don't we change the colle
giate system so that people can stay there as
long as they like? As John Dewey wrote, "Ed
ucation is not preparation for life; education is
life itself." I can't wait until the same can be said
for college.
