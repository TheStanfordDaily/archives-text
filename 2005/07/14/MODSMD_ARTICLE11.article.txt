## After bombings, England should not follow in American footsteps 
### CHRISTOPHER R. VAUGHAN 
The hushed voices came over NPR Thurs
day morning and prompted a ritual that is no
less harrowing for its increasing familiarity. As
on that dizzying Tuesday morning four years
ago and that stunning Thursday 16 months
back, 1 found myself thinking immediately of
whom I knew in the western metropolis whose
morning commute had been violated in the
worst possible way.
So far, I've been lucky. When the World
Trade towers fell, my sister was in the Bronx;
likewise, my friend Ryan wasn't on or near
the exploded commuter trains in Madrid.
And, after running the mental Rolodex last
week, I breathed with relief that 1 knew no
one in London.
And yet, 1 felt incensed. 1 can't pinpoint why
1 identified with the London attacks. To begin,
I've spent no more than five hours in the city in
my life. Furthermore, differing from Thomas
Friedman and surely others, 1 feel a strong
pang of solidarity with the British not because
they are "our mother country" (I can't call up
that peculiar slice of patriotism) or because
they are our "closest ally" (I've never felt great
about this war).

Perhaps the need to run the Rolodex ex
plains it all: New York, Madrid and London are
places in which I and my loved ones could trav
el or live without feeling all that out of place. So
when Tony Blair speaks of "our values," the
"our" makes sense to me for the simple reason
that the tragedy in London made me feel like
those in Madrid and New York had earlier.
A terrorist attack is not a wish-granting
event, but it does force us — if only briefly —
to consider issues larger than our morning
commutes.
On the topic of "values," let us remember
that Blair is likely to overstate the extent of
unity on that front among Britons. On the
other hand, nearly everyone can abhor civilian
massacres, and, in that sense, a certain shared
British value has undeniably been violated.
And reactions to crises tend to compel a sort
of ad hoc unification of latent affinities. When
an external threat makes its irruptive entrance
into a society, people suddenly feel their citi
zenship all the more strongly.
But when it comes to the messy matter of
placing blame, imputing reason and planning
response, unity quickly disintegrates. Even if a
government fights a war in defense of "shared
values," those values can suddenly go to de

bate. And so what might sound like moralizing
or false togetherness on Blair's part is probably
only his sincere and temporary effort to cheer
lead a nation back to confidence.
Let us hope, on the other hand, that the
Anglo-American "special relationship" does
not return too much to fashion. When Fried
man writes of our "mother country" and "clos
est allies," as he did in last Friday's New York
Times, he is stating truths that are the basis and
results of the transatlantic partnership.
But we Americans might remember that a
great many of our citizens and would-be citi
zens descend not from white England (as I
do) but rather from Africa, Asia, the Ameri
cas and elsewhere. How much is Britain their
"mother country"? And how much, really, is
it mine?
Let us also hope that the vexing issues of
Iraq and the attacks of Sept. 11 are weighed in
a thoughtful fashion vis-a-vis this latest
episode. I can imagine many of my comrades
on the left citing the U.S.-military control of
Iraq as the cause of the London bombings.
But there are a lot of causes. As I write this,
it seems that a European variant of al-Qaeda
has claimed responsibility for the bombings. If
indeed they are responsible, it will be useful to

pay attention to how often Iraq is and is not
mentioned in their statements.
Finally, there is the matter of how much
"freedom" will remain after the attacks. Blair
vows that Britain "will not be intimidated" and
"will not be changed." Friedman takes the
more practical stance that "we all just lost a lit
tle freedom yesterday."
Not all gains in security come at the cost of
liberty, but the American example shows that
much freedom has indeed been squandered
since Sept. 11. Widespread camera surveillance
has begun in London, and right there we can
see looming curtailments.
Let us hope, however, that Blair and his
government refrain from taking the excessive
step of passing something like a British PA
TRIOT Act. Some freedom will be lost, but it
need not all be.
To conclude: Let's hope that linking last
week's bombings with the attacks of Sept. 11
does not compound our lesser traits, but rather
brings out our more thoughtful ones.
