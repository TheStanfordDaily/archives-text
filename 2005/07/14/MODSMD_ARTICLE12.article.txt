## Men ousted in first race Rowers face Europe's best 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Recent graduate coxswain Zack Cooper
has navigated numerous races during the
course of his career on the Stanford men's
crew team, traveling coast to coast to race
against the best collegiate crews in the nation.
But all that seemed a world away as Coop
er stared down the River Thames and lined up
the Cardinal boat for its opening race of the
2005 Henley Royal Regatta in Oxfordshire,
England. The first round of competition in the
Ladie's Plate event gave the Stanford men a
taste of the regatta's international flavour.
Seeded No. 10 under the event's single-elimi
nation format, the Cardinal drew the Tara
boat club, represented by the Irish national
lightweight team, in their opening match-up.
Unfortunately, the Stanford men's first
race would also be their last, as the Irish na
tionals mounted a strong second-half push
to overtake the Stanford boat in the final
meters of the course. «
Within their first strokes of the starting line,
the two boats established a fast pace. The Car
dinal jumped out to an early three-fourths
length lead and managed to stretch the advan
tage to a whole length as the two crews passed
the barrier marker approximately a quarter
mile into the 2,112-meter course. The fierce
battle continued as the Tara boat took back a

seat over the next half-mile of the course, but
the Stanford men still maintained a two-sec
ond lead at Fawley just beyond the half-way
point.
As the two boats entered the final stretch
of the course, however, the Irish nationals
made their move. The Cardinal fought to
counter the surge, but were unable to keep
the Tara boat from drawing even 10 strokes
from the finish line. Both crews powered
through the finish with a time of 6:36, but it

was the Irish crew's bow that crossed the line
first, a mere three feet and split seconds
ahead of the Cardinal's boat.
Despite the disappointing outcome of the
race and their early elimination from the
Ladie's Plate competition, the Cardinal's ap
pearance at the world-famous regatta pro
vided an invaluable experience for each
member of the Stanford team.
For recent graduate David Banks and ris
ing senior Jake Cornelius, Henley afforded

them the chance to see first-hand the caliber
of international competition. Both men re
cently received invitations to the U.S. Na
tional Team training camp and hope to rep
resent Stanford and the United States on the
international stage.
After walking onto the men's squad four
years ago, Banks was named one of the
team's co-captains during his senior year and

distinguished himself as a major
force in the men's first varsity
boat. Cornelius, hailing from up
state New York, for three years
has played an integral role in Stan
ford crew's rising standing in the
world of collegiate rowing.
But of equal significance is the
fact that seven of the Cardinal
boat's eight oarsmen will return to
the Farm knowing what it feels like
to row in front of 100,000 people at
the world's most storied regatta. In
addition to Cornelius, rising senior
Rob Meyer and rising juniors Kevin
Baum, Justin Brown and Donny
Simkin all stand to fill major roles in
the squad's varsity boats. Rising
sophomores Jake Pashelinsky and
David Creighton rounded out the
Cardinal eight at Henley and factor
greatly into head coach Craig
Amerkhanian's plans for the future.
While the squad's early exit at
Henley may leave a bitter taste in
the mouths of the boat's oarsmen,
the opportunity to showcase the
program's progress will pay divi
dends in the long run — and in a
sport where performance over the
long run is what really counts,
things couldn't be brighter for the
Stanford men's team.
