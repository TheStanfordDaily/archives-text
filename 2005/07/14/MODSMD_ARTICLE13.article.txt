Borchardts become first hus
band-wife duo in NBA and
WNBA
With Susan King Borchardt's
decision to sign a free agent con
tract with the Minnesota Lynx
and compete in the WNBA, she
and her husband, Stanford grad
uate Curtis, became the first hus
band-wife duo to play for profes
sional basketball teams. (Curtis
is a center for the Utah Jazz).
King Borchardt spent some
time on the injured list at the be
ginning of the season due to plan
tar fascilitis in her left foot. On
June 11 she was activated and be
came available to play in her first
game, against the Washington
Mystics. Unfortunately, she re
turned to the injured list on June
22. She has only played three
games so far this season, a total
of 17 minutes, averaging one
point per game.

also been plagued by injury. He
missed his entire first pro season
and could not play in 65 of 82
games last year. However, this
year, he was able to play in a ca
reer-high 65 games, 23 of which
he started. Averaging 12.8 min
utes per game, he scored 3.0
points and recorded 3.3 re
bounds on average per game.
After three seasons with the
Utah Jazz, his scoring average
has risen to 3.1 points and 3.3 re
bounds per game.
Wiggins stars on Ul9 U.S. team
Stanford's sophomore hoops
star Candice Wiggins has teamed
up with Maryland's Crystal
Langhorne and North Carolina's
Erlana Larkins to serve as the
captains of the U.S. Under 19
World Championship Team.
This is not the first time Wiggins
has found herself in such a posi
tion. Last summer she was a co
captain for the U.S. Junior Team,
which competed at the FIBA
America's Junior World Cham
pionship Qualifying Tournament
and took the gold.
Wiggins' other national bas
ketball experience includes try
ing out for the USA Women's
National Team and playing on
the 2003 USA Youth Develop
ment Festival West Team, which
won the bronze medal.
She seems to bring success to
the teams she plays for, a streak
that will hopefully continue in
the FIBA World Champi
onship.
Championship Team head
coach Gail Goestenkors seems
to have great confidence in Wig

gins, describing her as "vocal...
high energy ... and [having] a
great understanding of the game
that will be helpful."
The team spent July 3-6 in
Washington D.C., training at
American University and then
left for Budapest, Hungary on
July 7 to play Hungary's Ul9

team. The U.S. team won the
first match 82-42, but suffered a
67-75 loss in the second round.
USA played a total of six exhi
bition games and finished with a
5-1 record. The team heads next
to Tunis, Tunisia for the FIBA
Women's Ul9 World Champi
onship.
