# Summer's anything but slow for athletes
## 
### SEAN HOWELL SPORTS COLUMNIST 
Summer is a time to kick back and relax. A time to learn a
new hobby, to chill out in a pool, to fire up the grill fora back
yard barbecue and to fight tooth-and-nail for that job or in
ternship you've always wanted (if you're a student, that is).
Most athletes, meanwhile, spend their summers honing their
skills in their respective sports. But that doesn't mean they miss
out on interesting summer experiences. In fact, the opposite is
true — Stanford athletes play all over the country and, in some
cases, the world. Here is a sampling of what a few of them do
during the summer to refine their skills and (hopefully) have
some fun while they're at it.
Dan Grunfeld, basketball — Grunfeld's staggering leap in
scoring last season — an NCAA-high 14.5 points per game, up
from 3.4 during the 2003-2004 season — was not quite as im
probable as you might think, if you knew that Grunfeld had
worked on his moves in pickup games with the likes of Jerry
Stackhouse and Larry Hughes the previous summer. (Grun
feld's father, Ernie, is the general manager of the Washington
Wizards, the team that those two played for at the time).
"It always helps to play against the best competition out
there," Grunfeld said in an e-mail to The Daily. "I have learned
a lot about the level of strength and toughness that is needed to
play at the pro level. In the NBA, wing players like Jerry Stack
house are not only extremely skilled but they have the ability to
punish you physically and wear you down with strength."
After working on his moves last year, Grunfeld has spent
this summer working his way back onto the court. He is almost
finished rehabbing the knee he tore in a game against Califor-
nia last season.
"It is going really well and I am look
ing forward to getting back in action
soon," he said.
Jeff Gilmore, baseball — The senior
right-hander signed with the Seattle
Mariners earlier this week and may end
up playing pro baseball in one of the
gloomiest cities in America. But as for
summer, Gilmore seems to have taken
Paul McCartney's advice in "I'll Follow
the Sun" to heart. He spent the summers
after his freshman and sophomore years
playing for the Mat-Su Miners in
Palmer, Alaska, a small town 35 miles
north of Anchorage. Because of Alas
ka's location, high in the northern hemi
sphere, the sun almost literally never
sets during the summer. Gilmore
couldn't have been happier.
"I loved the sun always up, it's like you
never get tired the entire summer,"
Gilmore said. He developed into a top
notch collegiate pitcher in Alaska, re
turning to go 10-2 his sophomore year
after seeing limited action during his
freshman campaign.
In addition, Gilmore, who already had
his pilot's license, learned to fly sea
planes in Alaska. He also took advantage
of all of the outdoor opportunities the
state offers, at least those he could fit into
his busy schedule.
"Games in Alaska always start at 7
p.m., usually go to about 10, and you usu
ally leave the field at 10:30," Gilmore
said. "It's still very bright by then. After
games you go fishing with your team
mates, or drive into the mountains, what
ever. There is plenty of light, always.l've
only seen the moon one time in Alaska, it
was the last night I was there last year,
August 1, and the moon faintly appeared
in the dusky sky. I had a long face the first
night I got home and saw darkness in
California."

This summer, Gilmore is playing in
another location renowned for the
amount of sunlight it gets — Lake Hava
su, Ariz.
"Each day here is at least 110 degrees,
no joke, and I love it," Gilmore said.
Ryan Hall, cross country and track —
Hall has spent the last three weeks train
ing on the Stanford campus with team
mate lan Dobson in preparation for the
World Championships, which will be
held in Helsinki, Finland, from Aug. 6 to
14. They are running close to 100 miles
per week.
"It is nice to do the same loops around
the woodchip trail, around the stadium
and on the track," Hall said. "There is
something comforting about sticking
with something, and some place that we
know works and we enjoy."
Hall and Dobson will trade the famil
iarity of the campus for an opportunity to
compete against the best runners in the
world in Helsinki.
"I have been dreaming of competing
internationally for all of my life," Hall
said. "I hear that track and field is very
popular in Europe so it will be fun to run
in front of packed stadiums and loud fans.
It still hasn't really set in that I will be
competing in the world championships.
Every time I walk through tunnels I pic
ture myself walking out into a packed
Olympic Stadium. It will be exhilarating
to live the vision in a month's time."
After running in Helsinki, Hall might
want to compare notes with swimmer Tara
Kirk, who earned a bronze metal at the
Olympics in Athens last summer. The
most interesting thing about Athens to
Kirk was not the competition or hanging
out with her fellow athletes in the Olympic
village — it was the Greek people.
"The Greek people were totally hos
pitable and made it really fun to be
there," she said. "The best part of the ex
perience for me was enjoying the last
week of the games after swimming was
done — Europeans really know how to
throw a party."
Hopefully for Hall and Dobson, the
same can be said of the Finns.

"Each day here is at least 110 degrees,
no joke, and I love it," Gilmore said.
Ryan Hall, cross country and track —
Hall has spent the last three weeks train
ing on the Stanford campus with team
mate lan Dobson in preparation for the
World Championships, which will be
held in Helsinki, Finland, from Aug. 6 to
14. They are running close to 100 miles
per week.
"It is nice to do the same loops around
the woodchip trail, around the stadium
and on the track," Hall said. "There is
something comforting about sticking
with something, and some place that we
know works and we enjoy."
Hall and Dobson will trade the famil
iarity of the campus for an opportunity to
compete against the best runners in the
world in Helsinki.
"I have been dreaming of competing
internationally for all of my life," Hall
said. "I hear that track and field is very
popular in Europe so it will be fun to run
in front of packed stadiums and loud fans.
It still hasn't really set in that I will be
competing in the world championships.
Every time I walk through tunnels I pic
ture myself walking out into a packed
Olympic Stadium. It will be exhilarating
to live the vision in a month's time."
After running in Helsinki, Hall might
want to compare notes with swimmer Tara
Kirk, who earned a bronze metal at the
Olympics in Athens last summer. The
most interesting thing about Athens to
Kirk was not the competition or hanging
out with her fellow athletes in the Olympic
village — it was the Greek people.
"The Greek people were totally hos
pitable and made it really fun to be
there," she said. "The best part of the ex
perience for me was enjoying the last
week of the games after swimming was
done — Europeans really know how to
throw a party."
Hopefully for Hall and Dobson, the
same can be said of the Finns.
