Walsh, May-Treanor win back to back
World Championships
Cardinal volleyball alum and Olympic
gold medalist Kerri Walsh teamed up with
Olympic partner Misty May-Treanor — a
graduate of CSU Long Beach — to win the
Women's World Championship of Sand
Volleyball this past week. Over 15 coun
tries participated in this year's tournament.
In the final game, Walsh and May took
on long-time rivals Juliana Silva and Laris
sa Franca of Brazil. The match was closely
contested throughout the two sets, which
both ended with a final score of 21-17.
Great set-ups by May and perfect spikes
by Walsh led to a quick second-set finish
and eventually the 40-minute match.
May and Walsh's amazing composure
is what won them first place and as a re
ward, they will return to the United States,
splitting a prize of $62,000. Additionally,
Walsh, Class of 2000, won the SWATCH
Most Valuable Player award for the tour
nament.
Their victory marked the 16th first
place finish by the pair in the SWATCH
FIVB World Tour since the duo began
playing together in 2001. In the runner-up
game of the tournament, China nabbed the
bronze medal to round out the top three.
Richards leads USA women in disap
pointing finish at the World Grand Prix

During these hot summer months,
USA women's volleyball is sizzling over
seas, hard at work at the World Grand
Prix. Playing against China, Brazil, Cuba,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland,
Korea, Germany, Thailand and the Do
minican Republic, American stars are
getting a chance to size up their more in
ternational competition. Kristin
Richards, a rising junior outside hitter
from Utah, represents Stanford as the
only Cardinal on the squad.
Richards posted some impressive num
bers in the past few weeks for Team USA in
Bangkok, Thailand. She is consistently one
of the squad's leaders in kills and shot-blocks
for the American team. And in a game last
week against Japan, she racked in a team
high 16 points off 11 kills and five blocks.
Unfortunately, inconsistent play led the
American team to an early exit from the
World Grand Prix. Early wins against
teams in their group pushed USA ahead in
the standings, but later losses to those same
teams eventually brought the squad's
record back to an even 0.500 heading into
the final games of the round, which con
cluded last weekend.
Team USA finished in sixth place over
all, just missing the top-five cut for the final
round, which will be played next week.
Up next, the squad will tour Europe and
Asia. Richards will return for fall training
and practice with the Cardinal women,
who will try to defend their NCAA Na
tional Championship next season.
