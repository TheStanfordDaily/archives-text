# Johnny Depp goes for Wonka style 'Chocolat'
## 
### TAM VO OOMPALOOMPA SYMPATHIZER 
Of this summer of remakes of remakes (or
adaptations of novels), no film is more highly an
ticipated than this week's box office release of
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." What I
didn't anticipate was that Willy Wonka would be
crooning, "Good morning starshine, the earth
says hello!" We definitely weren't in Gene
Wilder-land anymore.
Visually speaking, "Charlie" excels and keeps
us happy with a constant supply of eye candy.
The oversaturated hues of the factory scenes and
whimsical inventions provide contrast with the
dismal city. Combined with smoothing filters and
soft lighting, you'd swear everything really was
edible. I'll let the beautiful imagery and deft cin
ematography speak for itself. Nothing makes us
want to gouge our eyeballs out with spoons more
than seeing Violet and her mother in matching
electric blue velour tracksuits.
There's something equally pathetic and hilar
ious about the absurdly constructed house that
Charlie and his family of six live in. The whole
"the foundation is sliding" idea means the door is
tilted at a 45-degree angle, making it impossible
to find a level surface. And I'm pretty sure the
trained squirrels in Wonka's nut-shelling depart
ment are real, which accounts for how life-like
they look.
What can I say about Danny Elfman, the
man responsible for scores like "Good Will
Hunting" and "Army of Darkness"? He's this
generation's Burt Bacharach. There's no signs
of the familiar Wonka jingle, but the opening
puppet-and-fireworks scene when Wonka
(Depp) opens his factory up to the five lucky
Golden Ticketholders is accompanied by a
tune that's remniscent of the "Itchy and
Scratchy Show" theme song from"The Simp
sons." Without a standardized oompa loompa
tune, each disappearance of another spoiled
brat is accompanied by a unique choreo
graphed song-and-dance number that takes
you through various music genres. There's a
Shaft-tastic funk / soul number accented by
Barry White voices and a dance number that
pays tribute to the Hustle and Sergeant Pep-

per's Lonely Hearts Club. There's even a
Brazilian tribal drum-accented farewell
song complete with synchronized swim
mers in the chocolate waterfall lake. You
can't help but chuckle.
All the snot-faced kids are successfully
obnoxious from the get-go with the excep
tion of Charlie, who becomes a bit too cloy
ing as he persists in reiterating his Hallmark
approved statement "There's nothing more
important to me than my family." Did you
forget something, Charlie? Chocolate, per-

haps? You found $10 (I thought he was British,
but the currency is constantly referred to as "dol
lars") in the snow and you buy a candy bar and in
the excitement of having won the golden ticket,
forget to bring the change back to your starving
mum and pop? Despite the lack of any real moral
conflict or dilemma, Freddie Highmore (last
seen in "Finding Neverland" with guess who?
Johnny Depp!) is an extremely talented kid.
The manipulations of rich spoiled brat Veru
ca Salt (Julia Winter) and maliciously competi
tive Violet Beauregarde (Anna Sophia Robb)

will remind you of the bitchy girls you knew in
middle school. If he hadn't written it already, 50
Cent would have been inspired by the delirious
ly gluttonous Augustus Gloop, deftly played by
Philip Wiegratz, to pen the lyric "Love you like
a fat kid love cake." Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry),

who will clearly grow up to play a lot of
Counterstrike and Halo, is a foul
mouthed know-it-all who looks like he
stumbled onto the set after shooting
"Spy Kids."
It's the little "look at me, I'm so clever!"
subtleties that are unnecessary, like the
opening of the Wonka Factory, where
red-ribbon-cutting Willy, armed with
heavy silver industrial clippers, looks
more like Edward Scissorhands than the
charming and welcoming Roald Dahl

character we've come to expect. It's one thing for
Steven Spielberg to make allusions to his other
films in "War of the Worlds" (Don't tell me you
missed the "E.T." reference when the alien gin
gerly spins the bicycle wheel in the basement), but
Tim Burton? Three words: one trick pony.
It's hard not to blame Burton for everything
that seems to be wrong with Wonka. Johnny
Depp and I have had our ups and downs, but the
charisma of "Pirates of the Caribbean" and even
"Finding Neverland" is sorely lacking. Depp's
Wonka is just downright strange and creepy, i.e.

the subdued outfit and latex gloves that scream
Prince and Michael Jackson. Then again, they
both love children too, right?
Depp reminds me of the socially awkward
klutz from high school who would get picked on
for wearing headgear than a confident candy
maker. Can you smack into your glass elevator
any more times? The other adults in the film,
including Helena Bonham Carter, are sorely
underused.
I could forgive Wonka's weirdness. I could
even forgive the fact that they left out any real
conflict. But it's hard to forget these little detri
ments when half of the movie feels like a Psych 1
lecture with constant flashbacks. Psychoanalysis
of Wonka? Not necessary. I was expecting a
cameo from Philip Zimbardo and Albert Ban
dura with all the references to childhood repres
sion, issues with overprotective parents, displace
ment, depression. Not to mention the hedonism.
If I wanted to watch an overtly "psychological"
movie, it should be a thriller, not a children's
movie. The "sweetest thing of all" is not that
Charlie gets a chocolate factory (which is totally
flipping sweet) but that Willy Wonka finally gets
a real family. Let's call Oprah!
Despite all of this, I'm still a sucker for any
thing Wonka. My brief disappointment will pass,
but Nerds, Ropes and Everlasting Gobstoppers
are always tasty.
