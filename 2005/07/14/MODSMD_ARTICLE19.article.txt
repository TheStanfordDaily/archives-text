### CALEY ANDERSON SUMMER TV GURU 
If you were anything like me this past year, instead of
spending time in front of what my mother likes to affec
tionately call the "Idiot Box", you were otherwise occu
pied with "hundreds of pages of reading" or "Chem prob
lem sets." With the exception of a few select shows, (let's
not lie, "American Idol" was the whole reason I brought
a TV with me to college), my television was neglected.

Being home from school with no
pending papers or tireless hours in
the stacks (sorry, summer school
folks) has definitely freed up my
time to garner a deep respect for
summer programming. So, instead
of wasting your time on the crappy
shows, I've supplied you with a
short list of the must-sees:
The Best Free Entertainment a Girl
(an (iet:
Strip Search (Thursdays on Vhl...
and repeats, too)
"Strip Search," hands down, is
the most amusing show you will find
this summer. Where else will you
see 15 gorgeously chiseled men
compete for seven spots in a Vegas
review show and act like complete
and utter women while doing it?
Most of these men are large enough
to be bouncers; yet in every episode

at least one of them cries. And the amount of preening and
obsessive talking that is done about each other and about
their body issues would rival even the worst sorority
stereotypes.
What keeps me tuned-in, however, besides their at
tempts at learning choreography, is the personalities of the
contestants. I may rag on their surprising effeminate sides,
but they are, on the whole, an adorably sweet and humble
set. Fora show based upon vanity, there are very few ass
holes, which makes the show likable. Vhl replays it often,
so don't worry about missing an episode. I'm sure there
will be a marathon or two.
The Best Argument for Summer Repeats
House (Tuesdays on Fox)
This was a show to which I paid no heed until I came
home for winter break and my mother made me watch an
episode. I have been addicted ever since. Every person I
have introduced the show to has had a similar experience.
The crowd that gathered in my room to watch "House"
grew exponentially as the year progressed, and for good
reason: this is not stupid, mindless entertainment.

"House" is a hilarious, mysterious, squeamish and always
surprisingly brilliant show that follows Dr. House as he
watches soap operas, takes none of his stupid patients seri
ously, and solves medical mysteries CSI style. All it takes
is one episode to get you hooked. This is a smart show, and
you will not be disappointed.
The Best Kept (Non) Secret
Tour de France (OLN â€” every day until July 24 th, who
really knows when)
I'm serious. Watch some of the Tour de France; there is

no better drama on T.V. this summer.
And this is coming from someone
who not only understands nothing
about the Tour, but hates riding her
bicycle, period. What I did not realize
was the complexity involved with the
event. It has everything: fierce compe
tition, rivalries, intense loyalty, team
work, strategy, brute strength and
flat-out drama. You don't need to
watch all ten bazillion hours of it, but
do make an effort catch at least the
last five to ten minutes of each event.
If anything, it will make you feel more
physically fit just watching these
mind-blowing athletes ride up the
Alps faster than I could drive them.
The Best Show You Avoided Be
cause It Seemed Stupid, But If There
Is A Marathon, Stop, Drop, and
Watch.

Beauty and the Geek (WB)
This reality show, which vies with "Strip Search" as
the best show of the season, is addicting because within
the first five minutes you identify with one of the contes
tants for one of three reasons: one, he/she is like you;
two, he/she is like your best friend; or three, you sat next
to at least two or three of them in Econ. "Beauty," like
"Strip Search," chooses contestants that bring a lot of
heart and an open mind, raising the premise from a
mockery of stereotypes to a genuine social experiment
that brings together two groups that would not have oth
erwise melded (hot girls and 'nerds'). And you can't
make up lines like, "I like numbers. I mean, 1 like to cal
culate them. On my cell phone."
Don't feel restricted to just four shows, however. Also
check out "30 Days", "Rescue Me", "Queer Eye for the
Straight Guy", "Hell's Kitchen", "The 70's House" (just to
watch the kid jump out of the shower to do the Hustle),
"Hogan Knows Best", "Real World: Austin" (where not
everyone on the show is an incoherent slut), and reruns of
the "West Wing" and "CSI." Stay tuned for more recaps,
or get off your feet and watch them yourself!
