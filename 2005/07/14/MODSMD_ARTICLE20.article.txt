# Roxy scouts for a cabin mate
## Camp goes scandalous 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, WORLD BODYSHOT CHAMPION 
Greetings from sunny Puerto Vallarta! To all of my loyal
readers who were afraid I had disappeared on vacation, fear
not; there's plenty more Roxy coming your way. That is, if I
can find the free time, or for that matter a free hand, to type
my columns. Roxy's been quite busy lately. After all, it is
summer break.
Roxy's had a long love affair with the hottest months of
the year. While Roxy loved being a little girl, eating popsi
cles (hmm, although they may be more enjoyable nowa
days) and splashing in the pool, sleep-away camp revolu
tionized the summer experience for Roxy. Remember
sleep-away camp? If you don't, it's all those cabins tucked
away in the woods somewhere where they expect 15 to 18
year old kids to be asleep at 10 p.m. Haha. Sorry, Roxy still
cracks up over that. Then again, maybe the other kids were
asleep while Roxy snuck out to see Counselor Tom. Roxy
certainly learned a lot more about mouth-to-mouth from
Tom than she ever did during junior lifeguard training.
More importantly, summer camp taught Roxy how to
pack a full relationship into just five days. Meet someone,
flirt, make out behind the arts and crafts tent and then leave
them — and Camp Anawanna — in the rear-view mirror.
Hopefully all your relationships aren't that short, but
sometimes a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. If you're
only in Mexico fora week, you can tell that hottie from Den
ver that you met while doing body shots at Senor Frog's that
you'll email him sometime, but honestly, you'll forget his
name and he'll never even get a Facebook invite. Roxy

knows it's best to end these things quickly.
The important thing to remember about summertime is
that it's like being in Vegas for three months. What happens
in the summer, stays in the summer. If your special friend is
out of (insert state, area code, or zip code here), he/she
should be out of mind. You're back home in Chicago and
your girlfriend lives in Miami? Trust me; she's down at
South Beach living it up. So hit a Cubs game and take down
some perky gal you find in the bleachers. No one will be the
wiser when you two bump into each other in front of Toyon
next year. Besides, with any luck, the two of you will have
picked up some new moves to try out.
But Roxy, won't she know 1 was cheating on her then? you
ask. If she's screaming your name, Roxy thinks you'll be OK.
Rule No. 1 of any good relationship is that if you enjoy your
partner's skills, don?t ever ask where he or she picked them
up. Just chalk it up to careful reading of 'Cosmopolitan' or
perfect attendance at those images of Women in French Cin
ema' screenings. Trust Roxy. For example, can your girl
friend 'pleasure' you like a pornstar? She probably didn't
learn how to suck a golf ball through a garden hose by tack
ling that summer reading list. Just let it be, and enjoy the ride.
