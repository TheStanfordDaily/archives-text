# Lone critic says Dylan movie ain't that bad
## 
### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER ART FILM CRITIC 
There are lots of notoriously bad
movies where the title becomes a code
word for "colossal failure." The most
recent example would probably be the
Bennifer atrocity "Gigli," but there's
also the Scientologist mysticism of
"Battlefield Earth," the Dustin Hoff
man / Warren Beatty fiasco "Ishtar"
and the childhood icon genocide
known as "Batman & Robin."
Such determinations are made by
audiences, but are usually guided by
the intellectuals of the film world: crit
ics, writers and industry insiders who
use their power to decide what recep
tion a movie should get. Usually their
art fascism is on point (i.e. the afore
mentioned films), but in the case of
"Masked & Anonymous," an unsung
2003 masterpiece starring Bob
Dylan, they couldn't be more wrong.
I didn't see it until last week. Why
should 1? It got brutal reviews from
every major publication in the coun
try, the kind of self-satisfied literary
circle jerk where deeply resentful
critics get themselves all in a tizzy
about how ridiculously over the top
they can be while trashing a fellow
human being's art (that's not to say 1
haven't joined in from time to time).
Roger Ebert called it"a vanity
production beyond all reason,"
which clothed Dylan in"a couple of
costumes borrowed from the Tin
horn Dictator rack." And Michael
Atkinson of "The Village Voice"
began his review with the following:
"A mad monster party, a stoner's
dystopian doodle, an album-cli
maxing mega-dirge visualized as
open-bar Hollywood dinner party
— how to describe the scatter
brained quixotism of Bob Dylan's
'Masked & Anonymous?'" Could
the movie he's reviewing possibly
be more embarrassing than that
brazen display of 50-cent words and
nose-thumbing elitism? Even the
audiences at Sundance were per
plexed (according to Ebert), with a
half-packed auditorium silently
shuffling out during the end credits.
Morbid curiosity got the best of
me last week when 1 found a used
copy of the DVD for $5. I'm a big
fan of laughably bad Mystery Sci
ence Theater 3000-style movies,
and I heard that this one had Ed

Harris in blackface and Val Kilmer
delivering a long-winded mono
logue about evolution before pre
tending to kill a rabbit.
But I found "Masked & Anony
mous" to be a fantastic film that cap
tures the dense metaphors and
bruised Americana of Dylan's music
perfectly. Arthouse cinema always
meets with mixed reviews, but I was
shocked that so many people with a
background in film found it impene
trable. Should the autobiography of
America's greatest and most enig
matic songwriter be given a straight
forward treatment, a la "Ray"?
Though it's far from the cohe
sive narratives that mainstream au
diences are used to, its structure
isn't far removed from the material
you'd see in a Foreign Films 101
class, and I picked up everything
that was going on fairly easily with a
single viewing. Its message lies in
what Dylan's shifting persona rep
resents, the forces in his life that
have shaped him, what we have
taken from him and, ultimately,
what he really is —just a man.
A book could be written about
the movie, but bringing this material
down to earth in a tidy package
would be unfair, and undoubtedly
out of context. I will offer a few
thoughts, though, for those of you
who take the time to see it on my rec
ommendation and don't get what's
going on. For me, the setting mainly
concerns his transformation from a
youthful voice of change in the 60s to
the mysterious renegade of today.
Each major character is a mani
festation of an abstract entity; for ex
ample, Penelope Cruz is the church
and Jeff Bridges is the media. The
film's most memorable scene is the
beautiful a capella rendition of "The
Times They Are A-Changin'" by
the extraordinarily talented Tinashe
Kachingwe, which represents art's
ability to survive and make change
independent of the artist. That
major theme also guides the film's
final anti-iconic scenes.
It's heady, but it's enjoyable, too
—just like Dylan's music. I can
imagine the same critics mocking
"All Along The Watchtower"
when it came out: "Who's this Joker
he's talking about?! Who's the
Thief?! This is an esophoric load of
guileless balderdash!"
