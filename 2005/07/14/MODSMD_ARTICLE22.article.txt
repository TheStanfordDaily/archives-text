# Renovation of historical landmark worth millions
## Mansion nears opening 
### RICARDO GILB 
Leland Stanford's old Governor's Mansion
in Sacramento, which has absorbed millions of
dollars and over a decade of renovation efforts,
has become California's newest venue for the
entertainment of state and national officials.
The cost of refurbishing the 1872 main din
ing room? $275,000. Leland Jr.'s toy room?
$30,000. But as the work appears to be drawing
to a close, it seems as though the result may be
well worth the steep price tag.
As an official state historical park, the man
sion now welcomes visitors to view its Victorian
era furniture and chandeliers. They will also see
rooms commemorating the history of the man
sion, which has housed both California's impor
tant leaders and its most impoverished citizens.
The mansion itself was originally purchased
by then Governor Leland Stanford from a local
grocer a> a 4,000-square-foot property. When
the Stanfords moved to San Francisco in the
1860's, the site became the residence for three
California governors. The Stanfords moved
back in 1867 and expanded the house to its cur
rent size of 19,000 square feet.
Upon Leland's death in 1900, the mansion
was donated by Jane Stanford to the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Sacramento as a home for
"friendless children." It continued to operate as
an orphanage and shelter for well over half a

century. In 1978, the state purchased the man
sion and dubbed it a historical landmark.
In 1991, the Leland Stanford Mansion
Foundation was founded to gather funds for
the restoration from the private sector. The
current executive director of the Foundation,
Charles Ansbach, said that the project was orig
inally expected to cost around $10 million,
which would be split between the state and the
private sector.
But two problems quickly arose. First, the
state ran into a recession in the mid-1990's and
was unable to provide the necessary amount.
Second, major donors were not excited enough
by the restoration project to hold up their end
of the deal.
There was a breakthrough in the 1990s when
state officials promised to make the mansion
into a site where government officials and busi
ness leaders could interact in a suitable envi
ronment.
The idea got the attention of donors and
state officials, notably State Senator Becky
Morgan, Ambassador Bill Lane and
California's First Lady Gayle Edlund Wilson.
Governor Pete Wilson secured $5 million dol
lars for the project. Proposition 40, which fund
ed the state's parks, also benefited the effort.
To date, about $23 million has been raised, with
slightly over half coming from the state and the
rest from private donors.

"California competes with other states and
other countries for the attention and involve
ment of business interests and diplomatic inter
ests," Ansbach said. "Economic development
depends on people talking one on one."
He added that such a place "didn't quite
exist [in California]," and with the mansion, the
state now has "a home court — a backdrop for
important meetings."

The mansion renovations are not quite com
plete, and, according to Ansbach, the state is
unsure of the exact role the mansion will play in
the state government's future.
"Right now there is a great deal of enthusi
asm and attention to the fact that this now
exists," he said. "We will have to see over the
next three to five years the evolution of the
importance of this place."
