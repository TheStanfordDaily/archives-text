# Hydrogen explored as new fuel
## Stanford researchers draw up plans for transition from fossil fuels to fuel cells 
### SEAMON CHAN 
In an era of escalating gas prices and diminish
ing global resources, much attention has been paid
to the quest for new, innovative energy sources.
However, there is much recent debate over what
type of energy will power our society's future.
Three Stanford researchers, Mark Z.
Jacobson, associate professor of civil and envi
ronmental engineering, Whitney G Colella, a
graduate student in the program, and David M.
Golden, consulting professor of mechanical engi
neering, recently weighed in on the issue in the
June 24 issue of the journal Science. The
researchers claim that hydrogen fuel cells are
superior to fossil fuels and should be developed
for large-scale applications in the future.
A conversion from fossil fuels to hydrogen fuel
cells would provide health, environmental, cli
mate, and economic benefits, and would reduce
reliance on shrinking oil supplies, Jacobson said.
"Fuel cells are a new car technology that uses
hydrogen for power instead of gasoline," he
explained. "In fuel cells, hydrogen reacts with
oxygen to produce water and energy. The ener
gy is used to power the vehicle and only water is
emitted, eliminating harmful gases that all cur
rent internal combustion cars, including hybrids,
emit." *
Currently, the process of creating hydrogen
fuel produces many pollutants, studies show. In
Science, the researchers suggest that using wind
power to generate hydrogen could solve this
problem.
Although the researchers report that wind is
not the only way to produce hydrogen fuel, they
published in Science that using wind energy to
create hydrogen fuel could actually make this
form of energy cheaper than fossil fuels, especial
ly when the social costs of sources like coal and
oil are considered.
The researchers have also identified many

health benefits that could result from the use of
hydrogen fuel cells. According to the paper pub
lished in Science, such a conversion could prevent
millions of cases of respiratory illness and tens of
thousands of hospitalizations annually.
In order to promote the conversion to hydro
gen fuel and reap these long-term benefits, the
researchers suggest that the U.S. government
embark on an "Apollo Program" for fuel cells,
referring to America's gigantic push for lunar
exploration in the 19605.
The program would include measures such as
investing heavily in the development of a hydro
gen fuel infrastructure and giving financial incen
tives to companies that produce hydrogen pow
ered vehicles.
Jacobson said his research stemmed from his
interest in problems associated with energy con
sumption.
"I was motivated to research the issue because
I was interested in finding solutions for problems
like global warming and atmospheric pollution,"
he added.
Jacobson told The Daily that he hopes that the
attention his article creates can help further the
development of new energy sources and fuel cell
technology.
"It would be great if the attention we are get
ting can be used fora beneficial purpose, to gen
erate a lot of industrial interest or even influence
environmental policy," he said.
Students on campus have a range of opinions
regarding the practicality of hydrogen fuel. Some
argue that a large investment in fuel cells is,
indeed, necessary and important.
"I don't know how realistic and accurate these
simulations are, but the data is definitely
extremely detailed," said rising sophomore Artit
Wangperawong. "I totally agree with the
researchers that we should put a huge short-term
investment into fuel cell technology to get long
term results. The sooner the better."
However, rising sophomore Ivan Janatra, an
electrical engineering major, said he is "not sure
if now is the right time to make an enormous
endeavor towards fuel-cell technology. We could
definitely rely on hybrids fora good number of
years until fuel-cell technology and hydrogen
infrastructure is more developed. This way, the
transition would be more natural and wouldn't
put too much of a strain on the economy."
