# Students in London react to bombings
## 
### KATHERINE MATSUI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the morning of Thursday, July
7, a succession of four London explo
sions shocked the world and left a
previously jubilant London devastat
ed. The city had just won the oppor
tunity to host the 2016 Summer
Olympics the night before.
Three bombs exploded on the
London Underground train, and the
fourth destroyed a bus about an hour
later. All were believed to be suicide
bombings, but it is still unclear
whether the explosives were placed
on the trains themselves or in the tun
nels.
Stanford students studying and
working abroad in London joined in
the city's shock. Rising senior Stacy
Pepper, who is working this summer
at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, said she was walk
ing to work when she heard the deaf
ening bang of the bus explosion.
"1 heard the explosion on the bus,
but, at the time, nobody around
seemed to realize what the noise was
or where it had come from," she said.
Pepper added that the bombings
were a tragic, horrific attack and that
it's been especially hard to be away
from family during such a time. She
said she was fortunate to not be

directly impacted by the attack, but
still felt profoundly affected by the
incident.
"I have gained understanding into
the nature of terrorism and survival
in a way that only being here, in this
time, permits," she added.
In the days since the attack,
London citizens have been in for
another surprise, as police deter
mined that the still unknown
bombers were of British origin.
"What we know now is appalling
to contemplate," said Michael
Howard, Britain's Conservative Party
Leader at a press conference. "It will
take us a long time to come to terms
with the fact that these atrocities
appear to have been committed by
those who were born and brought up
in our midst."
