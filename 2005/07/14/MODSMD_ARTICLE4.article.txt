## Greenwell departs for S.F State Associate director of student activities plans to stay in touch with students 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Joey Greenwell, associate director of stu
dent activities, recently announced that he will
leave his position, effective July 21. He will be
moving to San Francisco State University, or
SFSU, to become the director of the Office of
Student Programs Leadership and
Development, he said.
"Although I know that my new position at
SFSU is a great opportunity, I will miss work
ing with the students here at Stanford,"
Greenwell told The Daily. "I owe it to the staff
and students here for making me a stronger
professional and for making me a better per
son overall. I hope I have had some impact on
the University, for the University has had a
great impact on me."
Greenwell, who has been with Stanford for
six years, tendered his resignation two weeks
ago. He applied for the position SFSU in April
and was contacted for an interview at the
beginning of June, at which point he notified
the Office of Student Activities of his potential
departure.
It is expected that Stanford will launch a
nationwide search for his replacement shortly,
and a new associate director should be in place
by the beginning of the 2005-2006 academic
year.
In his position at Stanford, Greenwell was
responsible for advising a number of student
groups, including creative arts groups, political
groups, social groups and dorm and house
governments. He advised the junior class pres
idents and students coordinating Absolute
Fun, an ASSU initiative to promote a wider
variety of activities on campus for undergrad
uates.
Greenwell was also highly involved with

organizing and planning campus events. He
helped with event planning and scheduling in
White Plaza and worked with parties on cam
pus as a party planner educator. As fraternity
advisor, he also worked as the resident assis
tant supervisor for Greek Row houses.
"Greenwell was amazing at empowering
students and student groups and at helping
them to fulfill their goals," said former ASSU
vice president Joey Natoli, Class of 2005.
"Parts of the University serve to stifle stu
dents. Greenwell excelled at finding a medium
between university responsibility and student
freedom."
In his role at SFSU, Greenwell will contin
ue to work with a wide range of student
groups. His office, which will focus largely on
conduct issues, will be involved in event plan
ning and leadership development in student
organizations. Many of the student groups that
he will help guide are activist groups, a facet of
the new position that Greenwell said he par
ticularly appreciates.
"San Francisco State has a history of
activism," Greenwell said. "I'm excited about
that. When people are that passionate about
issues, I think there's a lot of energy."
Though he was not actively seeking to
leave Stanford, Greenwell applied for the
SFSU position after his friends repeatedly for
warded him e-mail announcements about the
opportunity â€” they thought the job would be
a perfect fit for him, he said.
"I decided to throw my hat in," Greenwell
added.
While he looks forward to his new position,
Greenwell expressed a great appreciation for
his time at Stanford. He also commented on
the timing of his departure. Since he found out
about the new position during the summer,
none of the students he has worked with have
been told.
"I didn't have the opportunity to say good
bye," he said. "Hopefully students will keep in
touch with me."
Natoli said that Greenwell's departure is an
unquestionable loss for Stanford.
"I only hope they can find someone half as
good as he is," he said.
