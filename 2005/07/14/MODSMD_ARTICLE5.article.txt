Stanford's quest to digitize the exten
sive libraries of the 16th century
Englishman Matthew Parker just received
a boost — in June, the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation donated $1.4 million to the
project.
The project, entitled Parker on the
Web, is a collaborative effort between
Stanford University Libraries, the
University of Cambridge and Corpus
Christi College in the United Kingdom.
The project's goal is to make hundreds of
Parker's medieval manuscripts available
online and accessible to scholars around
the globe by 2007.
The Parker library materials, which are
held at Corpus Christi College in
Cambridge, include more than 500 manu
scripts dating from the 6th to the 16th cen
turies. Parker on the Web, initiated in 2004,
will create legible images of manuscripts
and post them on the Internet, where they
will be available for academic research.
Although Parker's library is one of the
world's largest collections of Anglo-Saxon
manuscripts, it is not easily accessed by the
public or even academics.
"As unique artifacts, these manuscripts
are kept in a single room in Cambridge that
is not open to the public," said Andrew
Herkovic of Stanford University Libraries
in a press release. He added that the pro
ject "opens that single room up to the
scholarly community."
According to Herkovic, the three insti
tutions worked together to procure the
new grant.
"It was a very formal grant which
involved a very intensively compiled pro
posal with a formal budget; in both pounds
and dollars... it was done in conjunction
with our colleagues in Cambridge," he
said. "It was a negotiated process and the

Andrew W. Mellon Foundation knew the
proposal was underway."
Mathew Parker, who lived from 1504 to
1575, served as the archbishop of
Canterbury during the English
Reformation and was master of Corpus
Christi, one of the ancient colleges located
in Cambridge, founded in 1352. He
worked to recover medieval manuscripts
and preserved the materials that related to
Anglo-Saxon England.
Herkovic said the choice to digitize
Parker's library stemmed from Corpus
Christi's small size and Stanford's lack of
medieval library material.
"It has to do with the initiative of an
alumnus of both colleges who suggested a
discussion and collaboration, which we
found to be extremely attractive," he said.
"Corpus Christi College is a very small col
lege with finite resources; this was an ini
tiative they would have been very hard
pressed to take on their own. Stanford
does not have as big of a collection of
medieval manuscripts; our interest was to
expand access to the Stanford communi
ty."
Although the project should not be
complete until 2007, a prototype is up and
running and will be available through
2005. The prototype contains high-resolu
tion images for two complete manuscripts.
According to Herkovic, when the pro
ject is complete, those who wish to view
the Parker collection will most likely be
charged.
"Some version will be available at no
cost to the world," he said. "However,
there may be a subscription model to get
all of the resources. The business model
should support long term aspects of this
site."
Currently, scholars and students are
invited to visit the Web site and provide
feedback to the project team.
