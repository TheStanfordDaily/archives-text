## Construction progresses on Stern and Columbae

Throughout this summer and the
fall, Stanford will work on two
notable construction projects at
Columbae and Stern Hall.
The work at Columbae will focus
on renovating and modernizing the
building, while construction at Stern
will aim to tear down and then sub
sequently rebuild the cottage for the
residence fellows at Casa Zapata.
According to Project Manager
Mark Bonino, the project at Zapata
is preparation for the construction
of the Munger Graduate Residence,
which is expected to begin after the
cottage has been restored.
"The construction at Stern Hall

is to reconfigure the Casa Zapata
resident fellow's residence to make
way for future roadwork and under
ground utilities in support of the
planned Munger Graduate
Residence," Bonino said. "The
scope of the Zapata project is to
demolish the existing residence and
to create a new two-story town
house style apartment within Stern
Hall. Construction started in June,
and the project is expected to be
completed in September."
The University announced the
Munger project last fall to compen
sate for the lack of graduate student
housing on campus. Currently, only
57 percent of all graduate students
