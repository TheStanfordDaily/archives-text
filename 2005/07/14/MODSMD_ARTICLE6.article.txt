# Projects slated to wrap up in September
## Construction progresses on Stern and Columbae 
### MANDY KOVACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Throughout this summer and the
fall, Stanford will work on two
notable construction projects at
Columbae and Stern Hall.
The work at Columbae will focus
on renovating and modernizing the
building, while construction at Stern
will aim to tear down and then sub
sequently rebuild the cottage for the
residence fellows at Casa Zapata.
According to Project Manager
Mark Bonino, the project at Zapata
is preparation for the construction
of the Munger Graduate Residence,
which is expected to begin after the
cottage has been restored.
"The construction at Stern Hall

is to reconfigure the Casa Zapata
resident fellow's residence to make
way for future roadwork and under
ground utilities in support of the
planned Munger Graduate
Residence," Bonino said. "The
scope of the Zapata project is to
demolish the existing residence and
to create a new two-story town
house style apartment within Stern
Hall. Construction started in June,
and the project is expected to be
completed in September."
The University announced the
Munger project last fall to compen
sate for the lack of graduate student
housing on campus. Currently, only
57 percent of all graduate students

are housed on campus, but the
University expects to house 80 per
cent once the Munger project is
complete.
The new dorm is expected to
provide housing for 600 graduate
students, approximately the num
ber of bed spaces in Stern.
In addition, it is anticipated that
these new residences will empty
current graduate rooms at Crothers
Hall and Crothers Memorial, allow
ing for more undergraduate hous
ing, as well.
Although the construction at
Stern Hall will be finished before
the start of the academic year, the
construction on the Munger resi
dence will continue throughout the
year. Bonino told The Daily that he
is working hard to minimize any
inconvenience the construction my
cause students.
"Unfortunately, construction is a
disruptive activity, and we try to
keep the causes of complaint down
to a minimum," he said. "We work
very closely with the Housing
Office and Summer Conferences
with that goal."
The Columbae House renova
tion project is expected to reach
completion in mid-September,
before students arrive on campus.
Members of the project manage
ment team report that the building

will receive a complete renovation,
including a systems upgrade to
achieve current code compliance
and communication requirements.
The plans for the renovation
were announced to Columbae resi
dents last spring. The students
expressed mixed feelings towards
remodeling a house whose weath
ered walls are, to some, what gives
the house its charm.
"I'm hoping that the CIP man
ages to preserve the special vibe of
the house: 1
cross my fingers that the murals,
narrow stairways and wooden-pan
eled rooms will remain when I
return," said Eva Dehlinger, a rising
junior who lived in Columbae this
past year and will live in the house
after the renovations. "Although I
think the house needed some gener
al repairs here and there, I fear the
house will lose more than it will
gain. I guess we'll see."
Others felt the renovation was
needed and would not take away
from the tradition of the house.
"Columbae's hidden bathrooms
and crooked hallways were part of
its charm, but you can't get rid of
what makes Columbae special by
remodeling the house," said Renee
Trochet, a rising senior. "Moving
furniture through the hallways
every quarter will be easier this
year. In addition, our kitchen and
garden will be better and the first
floor will be wheelchair accessible.
The benefits definitely outweigh the
inconvenience of getting used to the
changes."
