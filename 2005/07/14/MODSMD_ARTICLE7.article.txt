## Sketch I hate students 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM OPINIONS COLUMNIST 
Now that I've got that out of the way I sup
pose you're all going to want some kind of jus
tification. That will follow presently, but first,
a brief aside.
For the sake of honesty I should admit that I
actually enjoy working as a teaching assistant.
Teaching is kind of like the cheap hooker of the
academic world. While most of one's working
day is a continuing series of disappointments, in
the classroom it doesn't take much to get off —

sorry, I mean "get a brief
sense of achievement."
There's a lot to be said fora
sense of achievement. It feels,
well, like you've achieved
something and that can only
be a good thing.
Unfortunately, such good
things only happen during
three-quarters of the year.
During the summer most of

us are sadly deprived of
"eager" young things. Still, although I miss the
hours spent each week dealing with homework,
e-mails, grades, lessons, etc., there is something
pleasant about not having the kids around fora
little while.
It's not, incidentally, that I don't like chil
dren. Most of the time they are adorable, cute
little bundles of joy, it's just that — well, some
times they can be just a tad too much.
And that leads nicely back to the biggest
problem with teaching: students. There's
nothing wrong with students in the abstract.
If they would just sit there and respond in the
appropriate fashion everything would be just
fine. In practice, however, that never seems
to happen.
Take, for example, the asking of ques
tions. This, at least to me seems like a
straightforward thing. Something is unclear
— though how anything in physics could be
unclear is a little puzzling — so someone
puts forward an inquiry.
Alas, this is not what occurs. As a TA, you
quickly find yourself in one of two situations.
Either you are met with blank stares instead of
queries (one can only guess that this is some
kind of attempt to perform a psychic transfer

of knowledge) or you have to deal with the
jackhammer-like hand-raising of the class en
ergizer bunny.
Even if you aren't perturbed by the bizarre
world of the classroom, no one can maintain a
stoic attitude in the face of student / TA com
munication.
This comes in many forms. As well as home
work and exams, there are e-mails. So many e
mails. Sometimes valid issues are addressed,
but the term "valid issue" appears to be one
that is open to interpretation. Furthermore, un
dergraduates seem unclear on the concept of
timely notification — informing us that you
will be unable to make a midterm after it occurs
is not sufficient notice.
Speaking of homework, it is a source of con
stant wonderment that such creativity can arise
from a typical problem set. Leaving aside the
obvious rewriting of the laws of physics, there's
also an amazing number of ways work can be
presented on a page.
There are those who cram detailed work for
nineteen problems on one side of a single sheet
of paper with writing that can only be examined
by a microscope. And there are others who
seem blissfully unaware of linearity. Parts (a),
(b) and (c) will be spread around without any
thought to order, leaving the grader with a
fiendish jigsaw to make sense of.
It's on exams, though, that sense appears
to complete desert the Stanford undergradu
ate. The simplest of principles are apparent
ly forgotten. Rather than move onto the next
page, the student will skip to another, seem
ingly at random. And rather than move onto
the next line, there's a tendency to just turn
the page through 90 degrees and start writing
on an inward spiral. Artistic? Yes. Compre
hensible? No.
The somewhat confused attempts of under
graduates to produce work could lead to one
more demoralizing conclusion. Watching the
intellectual flailing of youth only makes it all
the more clear that not only were we doing the
same thing a short while ago, we're probably
still doing it now.

Are you a student deserving of love, not hate? Are
you a TA filled with affection rather than
loathing? In either case, e-mail navins@stan
ford.edu and I'll try my hand at matchmaking.
