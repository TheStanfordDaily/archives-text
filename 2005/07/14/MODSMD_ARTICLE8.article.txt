Protect the California coast
California's coastline is under attack. Cer
tain members of Congress are attempting to re
move key offshore drilling prohibitions and
open our coast to oil exploration.
As the state's chief fiscal officer, I am con
cerned about the environmental damage that
offshore drilling can cause to the people and
economy of California. The risks are too great
— especially weighed against our need to ag
gressively develop clean forms of energy.
California needs your help this summer.
We need to educate the public on what
Washington is trying to do to California. I
challenge you to become part of this impor
tant effort.
Your voice and actions —joined with oth
ers across the state, can send the important
message that California will not accept any
weakening of our coastal protections. Each of

us must accept this challenge — we cannot
stand back and let special interests thousands
of miles away determine our future.
I have accepted this challenge and have
called on other elected officials in California to
join in the fight. Further, as a member of the
State Lands Commission, I advocated for the
passage of a resolution urging the president
and Congress to continue the moratorium on
federal offshore oil and gas leasing.
This summer, I am hosting seven California
college interns. They will help research and de
velop policy on climate change, renewable en
ergy and offshore oil drilling. Through all of
our efforts, California's environment will be
better protected.
Best wishes from my summer interns, and
from myself.
STEVE WESTLY
California State Controller
