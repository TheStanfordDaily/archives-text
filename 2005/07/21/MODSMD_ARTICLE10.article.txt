"Humanity is one and indivisible"
I spent two years of my life in London and the
bombings of two weeks ago touch me deeply,
particularly because two of the attacks pierced
the academic heart of the city. There is no doubt
that Londoners will overcome the trauma.
Bombings, terrorism and suicide are all familiar
themes in British history. What puzzles me, how
ever, is the shock at the idea that ordinary citizens
can mutate into suicide bombers.
Has anyone considered how desperate the life
of an ordinary person can become in recent years?
To be such a person today means, more or less,
that you are an expendable employee of a large

company (or a sector subject to the currents of
market forces), you see your income falling year
after year, you lose health and educational bene
fits, you find fewer opportunities to improve the
quality of your life and more closed doors. To be
ordinary is to be nobody, because you have no
control over the conditions of your life.
On the other side, you are mercilessly bombard
ed with images of might and achievement, of wealth,
power and independence. "You can do anything you
want," the Sirens shout. Drugged with aspiration to
be somebody, you soon realize that the gates of pos
sibility are guarded by mighty dragons and that the
resources of the world are reserved for
elites of vast ambition and arrogance.
What can you do, the little and powerless
man that you have become? How will
you express your aspiration for self-re
liance and individuality when all dtxirs
are closed to you?
Irrational distribution of resources in

vites irrational acts as a way of restoring
equilibrium. You have known that since
the French Revolution. When you real
ize that the only thing you still control is
your biological existence, you gladly turn
your body into a weapon for the chance
of becoming somebtxiy. You are no
longer the ordinary person squeezed to
the bottom of the barrel. You are a mar
tyr and the instrument of a higher pur
pose.
More than anything else, suicide
bombers are the sons of despair and ide
alism. lnd( >ctrination and jihad are simply

methods of directing this energy to spe
cific aims. Defuse these living weapons by
opening the doors of opportunity to all
people. No form of life on this planet is an
accident. Every human being is entitled
to the basic essentials of life, as the Decla
ration of Human Rights asserted half a
century ago. In 2003, the American and
British governments opened a colossal
wound in an already inflamed area of the
world. And to this day, American media
have yet to disclose the death and misery
this action has brought to millioas in Iraq
and elsewhere.

The London bombings were only a
tiny repercussion of the bomb that the
USA
released to the world two yeais ago, as
much as Sept. 11 was a boomerang of ter
rorist activity this country had brewed for
decades through CIA. What one sows in
Afghanistan and Iraq, one reaps in New
York and London — a tragic but scientif
ic demonstration that humanity is one
and indivisible.
