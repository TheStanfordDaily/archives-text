## Event draws top women in pro tennis 
### CAROLYN PENNER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Perhaps you've noticed the busy hum sur
rounding the tennis stadium on Campus Drive,
or maybe you've coasted by and not given the
change a second thought. But if the construc
tion underway wasn't enough to catch your eye,
how about the sight of tennis stars like Lindsay
Davenport and Venus Williams drilling serves
on the Stanford courts?
Stanford's very own Taube Family Tennis
Stadium will serve as host to the Bank of the
West Classic July 25-31. In its 35th year, the
Bank of the West Classic is the oldest women's
only tennis event in the world. The tennis stadi
um has served as the site for this prestigious
competition since 1997, and Bank of the West
has been the main sponsor since 1992.
This year, the event features last year's
champion Davenport, Williams — who won in
2000 and 2002 — and Kim Clijsters, the 2001
and 2003 champion. Patty Schnyder, Daniela
Hantuchova and Ai Sugiyama will also be play
ing. Australian Open champ Serena Williams
was slated to compete, but withdrew on Tues
day due to an injured left ankle. The tourna

ment will consist of a 28-player singles draw and
a 16-team doubles draw.
Davenport noted that an impressive field
usually competes at the Classic, which bodes
well for spectators hoping to see hard-fought
matches.
"Stanford, I guess is a very lucky tourna
ment," she said during a conference call.
"[Venus Williams and I] seem to be the top
two players that have played in Stanford the

most. We've played some tough matches
throughout the years. She's always a very
tough opponent. Last year's win was extreme
ly exciting and a huge step for me throughout
the whole summer."
With the U.S. Open approaching, the Bank
of the West Classic serves as the first of three
key tournaments that will help some of the best
