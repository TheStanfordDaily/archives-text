# Five Card join MLB

### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
After three years batting back-to
back in the Stanford lineup and mind
ing the right side of the infield togeth
er, it seemed only fitting that when the
MLB Draft rolled around last month,
juniors John Mayberry, Jr. and Jed
Lowrie would enlist the same agent
and become the top two Stanford
draft picks of 2005.
Brodie Van Wagenen of IMG
Baseball — an alum of both Stanford
University and its baseball team —
handled negotiations for both players,
who have already signed with their re
spective teams.
Mayberry, who hit .312 during his
Cardinal career, became the 15th first
round pick out of Stanford in the past
19 years of the draft when he was
picked up 19th overall by the Texas
Rangers.
Many felt that the right-hander's
stock had dropped during the 2005
season, as his power numbers
dropped significantly — he hit .333
with 16 homers in 2004, compared to
.303 with eight bombs the following
season. Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess had always attributed this
decline to the change in the nature of
the Cardinal lineup. Marquess said
that Mayberry was more likely to get
hittable pitches when he was batting
ahead of former Cardinal — and rec
ognized clutch-hitter — Danny Put
nam than when he was hitting in front
of the young, inexperienced players of

the 2005 order.
The Rangers apparently agreed
with this explanation — and Mayber
ry's pedigree as a former All-Star's
son probably didn't hurt. Mayberry
penned a deal with Texas last month
fora $1,525 million signing bonus and
is rumored to be switching from first
base to the outfield once he hits the
minor leagues.
Lowrie, who transformed from a
reliable middle infielder in his rookie
campaign to an all-fields power threat
in 2004, was selected by the Boston
Red Sox in the Compensation A
round, which is sandwiched between
the first and second rounds. Lowrie
finished his Stanford career with a .338
batting average and a .565 slugging
percentage. The second baseman led
his team in virtually every offensive
category during his sophomore cam
paign and was named co-Pacific-10
Conference Player of the Year.
The Oregon native reportedly re
ceived a $750,000 signing bonus from
the Red Sox.
Four other Cardinal players were
selected on draft day, including junior
Mark Romanczuk, a two-time Team
USA member. The southpaw was
drafted before his arrival at Stanford
in the fifth round, but three years in
the Cardinal rotation — and two as
the team's ace — boosted his reputa
tion and made him a fourth-round
pick this year. Romanczuk was
nabbed by the Arizona Diamond

backs, and his agent, the notorious
Scott Boras, reportedly negotiated a
bonus worth $300,000 for the lefty.
Junior Peter Duda, a right-hander
whose mid-90s fastball kept him on
scouts' radar — and whose lack of
pitching control kept him off the
mound in college — was selected in
the 20th round by the Diamondbacks
and signed shortly after.
Junior Jeff Gilmore, who broke
into the starting rotation in 2004 after
pitching 2 and a third innings in his
freshman year, was selected by the
Seattle Mariners in the 31st round.
The right-hander signed with Seattle
last month, leaving Stanford with
ownership of the 10th slot on the all
time win-loss percentage list (.800).
Catcher John Hester, a junior, was
the final Cardinal player to be draft
ed in 2005, as the Red Sox picked him
in the 34th round. At press time, he
was the only Stanford player drafted
who has not signed a professional
contract. It has been speculated that
the backstop will return for his senior
year, much like former Cardinal slug
ger Ryan Garko. in hopes that his
power potential will continue to build
and improve his draft position for
next year.
