# Midseason, and it's already in the bag
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS SPORTS COLUMNIST 
It's official. The first half of the first year of
the post-steroids era of baseball is in the
books. Now that we've got 81 games under
our belts, let's take a look at the new baseball.
The White Sox, with the refreshingly
blunt Ozzie Guillen at the helm, have
pitched, sacrificed and run their way to the
top of baseball. Boasting a middle-of-the
pack .262 team average (good for 17th in the
majors), the White Sox have relied on bril
liant starting pitching and smart strategy.
Their starters are a ridiculous 46-18 com
bined, and have the third-lowest ERA in
baseball and the lowest WHIP (walks and
hits per inning pitched, for you non-fantasy
players). They have the most stolen bases
(104) and the most sacrifice flies (33) in either
league. Quite simply, they're doing all the lit
tle things to win.
Want an even more spectacular example
of the little things? Take a look at the Wash
ington"I swear, Montreal is really just that
depressing" Nationals. Halfway through
their inaugural season following relocation
from the black hole of baseball, they're lead
ing the National League East (arguably the
toughest division in baseball).
TTie Nats own the best record in one-run
games in either league. At last check, the one
run wonders were an amazing 23-8. The in
sane part about it, however, is that the Nats
are hitting an anemic .252 as a team, good for
26th of 30 teams. Overall, they've been
outscored 382-373 this year. How does a team
13 games over .500 have a negative run dif
ferential? Pitching and sacrifice again. Wash
ington has a staff ERA under 4.00, and when
you just have to score four runs a game to win
... well, you can do the math. And if you're
busy creating runs by leading the league in
sacrifice hits (55), then it seems you're taking
advantage of any opportunity to score. As for
the critics in the audience that say the Nats
can't keep relying on Chad Cordero and one
run wins, shut up. This isn't blacktop basket
ball. You don't have to win by two.
Turning my attention from a purist's
dream, it's the same old, same old in the rest
of baseball. At press time, three of the four
other division leaders (Angels, Yankees and
Cardinals) were last year's division winners,
with the young Padres rounding out the
ranks.
Setting San Diego aside (my IM softball
team might be able to break .500 in the
abysmal NL West), the other three teams
are a microcosm of what still remains wrong
with professional baseball — the greedy
pursuit of championships.
If it's possible, I hate the Yankees even
more than I did before. The Evil Empire con
tinues to find ways to disgust me; purchasing
the ridiculously overpriced Randy Johnson,
who, for $15 million, has gone a semi-re
spectable 10-6 with an ERA over 4.00 —
hardly "ace" numbers. For those keeping
count at home, the Yanks' payroll is now
more than the GDP of the Marshall Islands
and Tonga combined. Unfortunately,
they've managed to worm into first place, de
spite the fact that the team knows less about
chemistry than a SLE kid.
Not to be outdone, the Angels and
Cardinals rank fourth and sixth in
total payroll, respectively. During the
off-season, St. Louis picked up Mark
Mulder, further bolstering an already
expensive rotation. Add in David
Eckstein and the already costly Larry
Walker and Scott Rolen, and you can
imagine the Cardinal farm system is
starting to look like Swiss cheese.
As for the California Angels (I
refuse to relent to the greedy mad
ness of Arturo Moreno), they've
picked up Steve Finley, Bartolo
Colon and Vladmir Guerrero in the
past few years, making Moreno the
Mussolini to Steinbrenner's Hitler.
Hey, Jason Giambi, the fans
called. They want the home runs
back. With baseball's new steroid
policy in effect, Giambi's not the
only one coming up short. The sus
pect slugger's home runs are down
from 26 at the 2(X)3 All-Star break to
10 at this break. Overall, the league
average is down from 2.33 per game
in 2004 to 2.12 in 2005. Play those
numbers out, and you've got close to
700 fewer home runs through the
2005 season. But I'm sure steroids
have nothing to do with it.
And Barry Bonds, please just put
up or shut up. You're one of the
greatest hitters of all time, but stop
feeding us all this crap about your in
jury. You may be hurt, but I really
don't need the weekly update. I don't
care if you're STILL not playing. Just
get on the field and prove us wrong.
By the way, White Sox over Cards
in six, if you're wondering...
