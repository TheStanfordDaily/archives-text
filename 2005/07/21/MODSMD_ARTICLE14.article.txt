# Kirk sweeps fly events in So Cal

### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
In a field of dozens of high-level
competitors and Olympians, the star
ring role at the Janet Evans Invita
tional last weekend was up for grabs.
And by the end, the Los Angeles
meet, named for the former Stanford
swimmer and world-renowned
Olympic gold medalist, clearly be
longed to rising Aubum junior Hay
ley Peirsol.
Peirsol, the younger sister of three
time Olympic gold medalist Aaron
Peirsol, won four events at the com
petition, one on each day of races.
Swimming for southern California
club Novaquatics, Peirsol captured
wins in the 400-meter individual med
ley, and the 400, 500 and 1,500
freestyle events.

But there was plenty of room for
Stanford swimmers to shine, and they
did. Rising senior Dana Kirk led the
way with a sweep of the butterfly
events. Kirk beat UCLA's Kim Van
denberg by nearly two seconds in the
200-meter fly and then went on to win
the 110-meter with a time of 1:00.64.
Rising sophomore Brooke Bishop
also kept busy during the weekend,
setting a pair of personal bests —
good enough for two second-place
finishes — in the 100 fly and 100 back
stroke. Bishop also garnered a run
ner-up time in the 50-meter freestyle,
just behind Ford Aquatics-AZ com
petitor Courtney Cashion, who
touched in at a time of 25.90 in the
event. Additionally, Bishop took
fourth in the 100 free with a time of
57.79 and 10th in the 200 back.
Former Stanford All-American

Peter Marshall tallied a win in the 100
butterfly with a time of 55.39 — ris
ing junior Hongzhe Sun finished right
behind in the tight race, coming in
third (55.83). Sun also nabbed second
place in the 200 backstroke and third
in the 200IM.
Rising senior Mark Stephens
picked up four top-10 finishes —
third in the 400 IM, sixth in the 200
IM, eighth in the 200 breastroke and
10th in the 200 butterfly. Rising junior
Shaun Phillips took third and sixth in
the 400 and 1,500 freestyle events, re
spectively, while classmate Kyle Ran
som placed sixth in the 100 free. Ris
ing junior Andy Grant touched the
wall right behind Ransom in the 100
free to earn seventh place.
Incoming freshman Andrea Axtell
rounded out Stanford's effort, placing
fourth in the 200 backstroke.
