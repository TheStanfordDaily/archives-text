# 'Crashers' crashes
## Not exactly quoteworthy 
### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER FILM CRITIC 
The Ã¼biquitous Moriarty of Ain't It Cool
News brought up "Stripes" when discussing
"The Wedding Crashers," which fits well be
cause both movies have developed a reputation
for being great when they're not. They're not
bad, they're just unmemorable. After seeing
what 1 would call an "exceptional comedy," 1
walk around quoting it for days. 1 just saw "The
Wedding Crashers" less than 24 hours ago, and
though 1 laughed a lot in the theater, I'm having
trouble remembering anything from it.
Movie review
The Wedding Crashers
Directed by
DAVID DOBKIN
It's still definitely worth seeing, simply be
cause it's the latest from the genius comedy col
lective that includes heavy hitters like Will Fer
rell, Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn and charis
matic second-stringers like Paul Rudd and
Jason Bateman. But this is one of their lazier,
"Starsky & Hutch'Mevel entries that will never
reach comic nirvana like "Anchorman,"
"Dodgeball" or "Zoolander."
That's a shame, because it finally puts
Vaughn front and center in a mainstream com
edy. Though he was a fine straight man in
"Dodgeball" and has racked up great support
ing roles in everything from "Be Cool" to "Mr.
& Mrs. Smith," he hasn't been able to clown
around in the multiplex the way he did in
"Swingers" and "Made."
That changes here, with a rip-roaring,
motor-mouthed performance that would be de
scribed as star-making if he wasn't already
known as one of the funniest guys alive. Some
one who actually does deliver a star-making
performance is Isla Fisher, who is best known
up to this point for being engaged to Sacha
Baron Cohen a.ka. Ali G (and by extension, I
suppose, "me Julie"). Here she takes what
could have been a one-note part as Vaughn's
stalker-turned-love-interest and steals nearly
every scene she's in with her natural charm and
razor-sharp timing. The reliably fantastic
Christopher Walken doesn't really try to be
funny (playing the Secretary Of The Treasury!)

but is funny anyway because he's Christopher
Walken.
Unfortunately, though, the movie's not re
ally about them. It's centered on a weepy ro
mantic storyline about how Owen Wilson is
tired of the partying lifestyle and falls in love
with Walken's privileged daughter, played by
Rachel McAdams. It's standard territory for
crude comedies nowadays: boy meets girl and
intrigues her because of life-based-on-lies,
boy loses girl because girl finds out about life
based-on-lies, boy gets girl back with serious
speech proclaiming "that stuff was all a bunch
of lies, but the guy you fell in love with, that's

who I really am!"
Wilson and McAdams are very appealing
actors who do what they can with the material,
but sappy love stories and hard-R frat boy
comedies go together about as well as oil and
water. In the end, "The Wedding Crashers" is a
little too much of both. It verges into "Porky's"
homage far too often and good luck if the love
story doesn't make you feel queasy.
Hopefully this move toward sentimentality
doesn't signal a permanent drop in quality the
way that Adam Sandler's bizarre early classics
