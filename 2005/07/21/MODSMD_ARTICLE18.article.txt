# Series, reality shows teach useful lessons

Television shows generally fall into one of two
categories: entertaining or informative. One makes
you laugh but requires little brainpower to under
stand: the other is brimming with knowledge and has
a purpose. Unfortunately, the informative shows
often lack the pizzazz of sitcoms and dramas, making
them unwatchable for more than five minutes at a
time (the sorry state of my attention span). Not all is

lost, however, as shows arc now trying to combine
the two and surreptitiously teach you things. Thus,
my pick of must-see (or must not-sce) shows for the
week are those that totter on the fine line between
education and enjoyment.
30 Days (FX, Wednesday) — Morgan Spur
lock, the guy whose liver will be forever ruined be
cause of "Super-Size Me," has created a mini-se
ries that literally has a man or woman walk a mile
in someone else's shoes. While the concept isn't all
that original, Spurlock's show easily tops its prede

ccssors because the situations are pertinent and cre
ative, and the participants are thoughtful and intelli
gent.
In the first episode, Spurlock himself is the
guinea pig. He and his fiancee live at minimum
wage fora month, highlighting the increasingly in
accessible cost of living. The next show sends a
Christian to live in a strict Muslim community.
Another premise has a conservative soldier go live
in the Castro district for 30 days with a gay man.
The last of the series turns a mother into a binge
drinker in an attempt to understand her college-aged
daughter.
Each show addresses social issues insightful
ly and with an open-mind, yet the hour-long
show is never boring, nor does it feel forced. It is
the most fascinating reality show on television,
and it works without needing to give the contes
tants prizes or have them eat pig intestines.
Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (Bravo, Tues
day)— Anyone who questions this pick was
clearly not in my basement last week helping my
mother and 1 paint. For the first time we were ven
turing away from white and anytime Mom started
to freak out about the purple, she would repeat to
herself Queer Eye interior decorator Thorn
Fiduccia's motto: "1 am not afraid of color."
Though the show has been on the air now for
two years, it has managed to stay fresh and hilarious
by continually milking over unique and deserving
men. One week it's a nudist, the next a foster father
with 10 foster children. And while the show is
geared towards teaching men how to dress, cook
and decorate, I have learned invaluable tips regard
ing hangers, hair care and, of course, piiinting.
The Surreal Life (VHI, all the time) — What I
have learned from this show can be summed up in

three words — don't do drugs. The only anti-drug
video that needs to be shown in health classes is a
half hour of Janice Dickinson (the first supermod
el ever, mind you). The bitch is crazy. And it is
scary. Ergo, drugs and I are parting ways. Forever.
Hooking Up (ABC, Thursday) — ABC's
recent attempt at a mini-series follows single 30-
somethings as they attempt on-line dating.
After five minutes, I had to turn it off, simply be
cause what it teaches is depressing. All of the
people being followed were desperate (one lady
actually told a guy on her first date that she

wants to get married and have kids as soon as
possible), and the dates were all disasters.
One poor woman was dumped through e
mail. Ouch. If this is to be my fate in 10 years, I
do not want to know about it now. Only watch
this series if you have a deep yearning for knowl
edge about Match.com. Otherwise, watch re
peats of "The 0.C." Sadly, the unsuccessful sec
ond season is less disheartening than "Hooking
Up." Or, go buy the new Harry Potter and
spend a few days engrossed in a really good
read. In fact, do that anyway.
