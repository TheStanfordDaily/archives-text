Television shows generally fall into one of two
categories: entertaining or informative. One makes
you laugh but requires little brainpower to under
stand: the other is brimming with knowledge and has
a purpose. Unfortunately, the informative shows
often lack the pizzazz of sitcoms and dramas, making
them unwatchable for more than five minutes at a
time (the sorry state of my attention span). Not all is

lost, however, as shows arc now trying to combine
the two and surreptitiously teach you things. Thus,
my pick of must-see (or must not-sce) shows for the
week are those that totter on the fine line between
education and enjoyment.

in someone else's shoes. While the concept isn't all
that original, Spurlock's show easily tops its prede

ccssors because the situations are pertinent and cre
ative, and the participants are thoughtful and intelli
gent.
In the first episode, Spurlock himself is the
guinea pig. He and his fiancee live at minimum
wage fora month, highlighting the increasingly in
accessible cost of living. The next show sends a
Christian to live in a strict Muslim community.
