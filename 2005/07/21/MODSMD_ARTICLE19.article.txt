# DVD PICK OF THE WEEK

### 
The movie "Gia," starring a much
younger, yet no less fabulous, Angelina
Jolie as doomed supermodel Gia Carangi
first aired on HBO in 1998. Seven years
later, it is still one of the top-selling DVDs in
the nation. How, may you ask, does a movie
never released in theatres retain such im
mense popularity? The answer is likely Ms.
Jolie's electric performance, not to mention
her other assets — like her recent star
power, for one.
The bio pic fallows Gia Carangi from age sev
enteen when she works as a waitress in her fa
ther's diner to her battle against and eventual
death from AIDS in 1986. One of the first women
in the U.S. to die from the virus, Gia struggled in
life with drug use and abusive relationships. Jolie,
23 years old at the time the movie was made, skill
fully portrays her character's inability to cope
with fame and need for her family, particularly
her mother's, approval. By the time she became
ill, Gia was a hospital welfare case. She was only
26 when she died.
"Gia" is the first movie that gave Jolie, now
one of the biggest box-office draws in Holly
wood, the opportunity to prove herself to be
more than just a pretty face. There are few ac
tresses working today that can sustain that level
of energy in their work. Incidentally, Faye Dun
away, who also stars in the movie alongside
Jolie, is one such actress.
Critics' most common complaint about the
film is that it is too short to get a strong hold on
who Gia was during her life. While its true that
the movie runs shorter than most movie bi
ographies, at 126 minutes, the film makes up
for its brevity with its intensity of feeling and
stunning performances.
