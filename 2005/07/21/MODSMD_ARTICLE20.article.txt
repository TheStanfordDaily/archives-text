### ADAM SCHAEFER MIDWESTERN AUTHORITY 
Somewhere between the East Coast, the
West Coast, the South and Canada, there ex
ists a non-fictional place called the "Ameri
can Middle-West." Mostly populated by
corn, cows and other things that can be eaten,
this region also contains several clusters of
buildings, roads and people — the "cities" of
the Midwest.
Most notable among these is Chicago, with
her two baseball teams and two airports. An
other city is Cleveland — "the Cleaving
Land" —so named by the Iroquois 6,000
years ago because of its once magnificent mis
sionary-cleaving industry. This majestic jewel
on Lake Erie is often called the "Mistake on
the Lake," but this is a misnomer — the in
vention of Cleveland was no accident. Her
founding fathers simply wanted to establish a
village on the muddy, muggy and dangerous
ly mosquito-infested banks of the winding
Cuyahoga River.
The proud history of this gorgeous city is
as diverse and fascinating as its 500,000 resi
dents, but can be easily summarized with wry
anecdotes about flaming rivers and Drew
Carey. Although the Cuyahoga River once
actually contained water and supported
wildlife, the booming steel industry of the
20th century transformed it into a scenic canal
of toxic waste. Mayor Drew Carey made the
decision to ignite the river in 1969 to attract
tourists and the EPA, and it still burns on
today in his memory. The combustible Cuya
hoga continues to attract tourists, and Cleve
land is without a doubt the state's hottest va
cation spot, with the exceptions of Columbus
and Cincinnati. A summer spent in Cleveland
is a summer well-spent, with millions of at
tractions, activities and investment opportu
nities that can't be missed.
Places to see while vacationing in Cleveland:
The Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame — Another
of Cleveland's non-mistakes, this museum
commemorating rebellion and rebelliousness

contains hundreds of exhibits of Rock memo
rabilia — everything from plaques of golden
Beatles' records to instruments used by The
Beatles to pictures of The Beatles themselves.
A must-see for all ages.
The Flats — Cleveland's bar district, span
ning two sides of the Cuyahoga. Littered with
bars, strip clubs and, well, litter, the Flats are
a great place to drink and drown. Several
music venues exist here, attracting fans of
country music, classic rock cover bands and
people who want to watch local radio person
alities fight the IB A Super Heavy Weight
Champion "Butterbean." The Flats host the
Women's Pudding Wrestling Championships
and the Cleveland Rib Cook-Off every year.
For entertainment, clubbing and chucking
beer bottles into chocolate-brown water. The
Flats can't be beat.
Ohio City — Home to Cleveland's two
liberal residents, this "hip" district is located
on the city's near-West Side. With bars and
restaurants aimed at attracting Cleve
landers looking fora more cosmopolitan ex
perience, Ohio City boasts a martini bar, a
Caribbean-themed cafe and may someday
have a sushi restaurant.
Steelyard Commons — This playground
for abandoned factories and piles of rocks was
the heart of the once-bustling steel industry in
Northeast Ohio. "The Inferno," a 250-foot-tall
smokestack expelling a 60-foot-tall yellow
green flame, lights up the night sky. In an effort

to revive the area, Geveland's economic mas
terminds plan on installing several Wal-Marts.
Leßron James — The President of Cleve
land, Mr. James can be seen driving his several
thousand children and their mothers in his
fleet of flying Cadillac Escalades. Tickets to
see Cleveland's NBA team, the Lehrons, can
be purchased at Leßron Arena downtown.
Things to do in Cleveland:
Take a Stripper Home — After a night of
hard drinking and lap dances, take the advice
from the guy who hands out the towels in the
bathroom — ask Naomi up to your crib fora
few shots of chilled Bacardi Razz. Don't wait
for her in the club parking lot — the bouncer
will tell you that prostitution is illegal — tell
her that you'll pull around to the bar next door.
Make small talk in the car and on the way to
your apartment, and while she's in the bath
room, hide your valuables in the washing ma
chine. Take her home in the morning, but
don't offer to buy her breakfast. Borrow make
up from a female co-worker to conceal any
hickeys and go get tested.
Take a Vacation — While vacationing in
Cleveland, consider these beautiful and excit
ing vacation destinations: Paris, Cancun, Key
West, Barcelona, Miami, Cairo, Tahiti, Los
Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Las Vegas, San Fran
cisco, Ibiza, Boston, Brussels, Berlin, Chicago,
London, Amsterdam, Washington, DC,
Moscow, Tokyo, New York City, Seattle,
Philadelphia and San Tropez.
