"He's certainly Pinteresque, but there's a
lot more to it," explained Rush Rehm. associ
ate professor of drama and classics, referring
to Harold Pinter, considered by some to be
one of the greatest living English playwrights
— evidently, great enough to spawn his own
adjective — and the subject of the Stanford
Summer theater festival, which began July 11
and will continue through Aug. 8.
The festival includes four Pinter plays and
five films. Coordinators hosted a symposium
yesterday, which featured some of Pinter's
shorter works, a song, movie clips highlighting
Pinter as an actor and a panel discussion on
his significance with Rehm. playwright Amy

recent Stanford graduate Ed Iskandar and
director Jeffrey Bihr.
While the festival is a celebration of Pinter,
it also aims to show that there is a lot more to
the wnter than meets the eye, Rehm said.
Pinter became famous in the 1950s and early
1960s for his plays, which used language in
new ways and always had a mysterious ele
ment — sometimes described as absurd,
sometimes terrifying and sometimes, when no
other words seemed to work, Pinteresque.
Rehm. founder of the seven-year-old
Stanford Summer Theater, a professional the
ater company that performs on campus, is
attempting to broaden appreciation for Pinter
beyond those limited elements of his work as
playwright, to include his life as a poet, actor
and political activist.
Pinter, now 75, has long been a critic of
U.S. policy towards Central and South
American, and has most recently taken a very
vocal stand against the brutality of the
American-led war in Iraq. Charles
Junkerman. dean of continuing studies and

the summer session, speaking at Wednesday's
symposium, called Pinter the "moral con
science of the British Left."
His political views were as much the focus
of Wednesday's symposium as any of his
artistic work. Rehm argued that Pinter's fear
of the abuse and misuses of language is the
common thread between these two aspects
of his life. When asked how someone who
can create such brutal characters could care
about humanity enough to work so hard for
its betterment, lskandar replied with a
Pinter quote: "I hate my characters. I cry for
'them at night."
The political aspect of Pinter's life may give
audiences something more concrete to hold
onto than Pinter's artistic pronouncements.
Justin Liszanckie, a rising senior and press
contact for the festival, said that audience
members "leave the theater scratching their
heads wondering, 'What did we just see?'
and are unable to justify the actions of the

characters."
Liszanckie added that Pinter is well-known
for his particularly dramatic pauses, which
also add to the fun of adapting his work for
the stage.
"His dialogue is rapid-fire back and forth,
quick jabs and punches then a pause," he
explained. "It makes you wonder, where is it
going to go next? A lot of it is timing. It's chal
lenging as an actor to convey that."
The productions "The Lover" and "Night"
will run Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8
p.m.. and Sundays at 7 p.m., in Pigott Theater
through Aug. 7. There is an additional mati
nee at 2 p.m. on Sunday Aug. 6. On Fridays
