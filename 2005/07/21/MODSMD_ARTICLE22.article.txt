As investigators in Britain continue to uncov
er information about the now infamous London
transportation bombings of July 7th. students
and transportation authorities are only beginning
to adjust and respond to the shock of the grue
some event.
"The whole situation was a total shock to
me," said Stanford Summer College student
Brittany Taylor, who hails from England. "I
knew people who were near the bombings and
were thankfully not hurt, but this has definitely
brought fear to me and my friends about trav
eling on trains."
In the aftermath of the attacks, which struck
three subway trains and one double-decker
bus. the United States raised its terror alert to
red. Almost three weeks later, the alert level
remains at orange.
In Washington. D.C., police are patrolling the
subways with machine guns. Locally, BART
platforms all over the Bay Area are being
patrolled regularly.
The police presence at BART stations has
been raised since the incident, and many diffi
cult to monitor public bathrooms have been
locked.
"For public transportation, this is a reminder
that we are living in a difficult time." said Public
Information Officer Jayme Kunz of the Caltrain
system. "As a result, we need to maintain the
best security for our passengers."
In London, the mangled trains have only
recently been removed from their tracks. Despite
these conditions, the London Underground,
which has also taken measures to tighten its secu
rity on trains and in tunnels, is expected to resume
normal service within a couple of weeks. Dogs
will sniff every bag that enters the station to pre
vent bombs from reaching train platforms.
Police in London have found and identified
the four perpetrators believed to have detonated
the explosives used in the attack.
