# Stanford nears traffic limit, asks employees to carpool
## 
### ADAM WIDMAN NEWS EDITOR 
Recent counts have shown that Stanford is
close to exceeding the number of morning and
evening vehicles that are allowed to travel to
and from the University under its current
Santa Clara County General Use Permit.
If Stanford violates the number of vehicles
allowed by its permit, the University will have
to pay millions of dollars to modify local inter
sections affected by traffic.
To avoid these consequences, Provost John
Etchemendy requested in a July 12 memo that
managers help reduce the number of employ
ees who commute in single passenger cars
during peak hours by 10 to 15 percent.
According to Etchemendy, efforts to cut
the number of vehicles around campus will
not lead to cuts in the Stanford workforce.
Instead, employees will be encouraged to take
advantage of alternative modes of transporta
tion or adopt work schedules that do not
require commuting during peak traffic hours.
"We are asking employees and offices to
try to reduce their single-occupant commuting
at peak hours in several ways." Etchemendy
told The Daily. "For those people who live
close by, I hope they will consider walking or
biking to work. Second, we hope even more
people who have to commute will adopt some
of the alternative transportation programs the
University offers. Finally, for some people, it
makes sense to change their work schedule, so
that they do not arrive or leave at the peak
commute times."

He added that the University's efforts to
decrease traffic are not purely motivated by
financial concerns.
"We could certainly pay to modify the road
intersections, but there are more important
reasons to discourage commuting by car," he
said. "It improves traffic in the neighboring
communities, air quality and the environment.
That is reason enough to try to reduce single

occupant cars coming to campus, quite inde
pendent of the GUP restrictions."
While Stanford currently has a number of
programs designed to provide employees with
incentives not to drive alone to campus —
including free passes for many Bay Area
trains and buses and financial benefits for
employees who carpool or agree not to pur
chase parking permits — the University plans
to greatly expand these services in August and

September. Most notably, Parking and
Transportations Services plans to extend
Marguerite service on many popular routes
and increase the frequency with which
Marguerites arrive at certain campus stops.
Changes could also affect students.
Etchemendv said the University is considering
raising the price of parking permits consider
ably to decrease the amount of vehicles
parked in campus lots.
"The General Use Permit also restricts the
amount of parking we can have on campus: so
in addition to discouraging commuting, we
would also like to see fewer students owning
cars," he said.
According to Jean McCown, director of
community relations, members of the commu
nity have been generally pleased with
Stanford's efforts to reduce traffic generated
by a workforce that has expanded consider
ably since the University's current GUP was
established in 2001.
She added that Santa Clara County con
ducts traffic counts regularly and that the
inspections were not prompted by community
complaints.
"Recently, there have been no specific sig
nificant complaints about traffic, but we know
our neighbors will remain very interested in
how additional GUP development will affect
local traffic patterns," she said. "Prior to this
GUP. the University had already done a great
deal in providing alternatives, and while 1
think the community appreciated those
efforts, they wanted them to continue and
even be expanded."

Throughout most of the day, traffic ties up not only El Camino Real, above, but also the other
raods leading to Stanford and those that run through campus.
