## Stanford solar vehicle races over int'l borders 
### LAUREN OTERO 
After more than a year and a half
in the making, "Solstice," Stanford's
most recent solar car, faces the ulti
mate road test — the North American
Solar Challenge, sponsored by the
United States Department of Energy.
Hie Challenge, which is the world's
longest solar car race, began July 17
and will continue for 10 days, running
a 2,500-mile course from Austin, Tex.
to Calgary, Canada.
The Stanford Solar Car Project, an
entirely student-run club, has built and
raced more than five vehicles powered
by solar energy since 1986. Those
involved say they invest time and
energy to construct these cars not only
for the thrill of the challenge, but also
in hopes of developing renewable
energy resources, according to the
group's Web site.
Solstice, which cost about $250,000
to build, can move up to 45 miles per
hour using only the sun's energy and
70 miles per hour while using the bat
tery pack — a device that can store
solar energy for future use, according
to the Stanford News Service.
Four Stanford students will switch
off operating the car throughout this
month's competition, and 11 other
team members will follow in a van,
providing the driver with weather and
temperature updates as well as other
pertinent logistical data.
Team member Addison Shelton,
a recent graduate, described the
important points of racing a solar
powered car.
"When we are racing, weather is
really important," Shelton said. "We
have to look at weather maps and out
look during the race to determine
optimal speed."
Stanford's current design gains
speed under conditions that might
seem counterintuitive. Although
most solar cars function optimally
when sunlight is at its peak, the solar
cells installed in Solstice respond best
to infrared light. This translates into
a clear advantage and fast speeds for

Stanford on cloudy days.
Participants in the Stanford Solar
Car Project said they hope that the
dynamic, sleek design of the vehicle
will earn Solstice a winning place in
the competition. Unlike previous
years, during which the car's frame
included carbon deposits, the team put
together the tubular steel frame of
Solstice in just several days.
In addition, the car's electric motor
increases energy saving and efficiency
— the car can convert energy into
electric power, allowing the vehicle to
reach speeds of up to 70 miles per
hour when the car's batteries are
charged, Shelton said.
In some respects, the design of
Solstice resembles any other motor
vehicle. Like most cars, Solstice has a
single break pedal and uses hydraulic
breaks. However, while the average
car has a 100-horse power engine.
Solstice has a 10-horse power maxi
mum. using about 10 percent of the
power that a normal car does to go
the same speed.
The North American Solar
Challenge is going to be a very com
petitive race, said recent graduate
Eerik Hantsoo. who has been on the
team for four years and helped build
Solstice. Still, his expectations for the
race are high.
"In 1997 the team's car came in
third out of the entire field and in 2001
placed second in its particular stock
class," he said. "I expect that we will
do as well if not better than past
years."
Despite high hopes for Solstice,
the team faced disappointments on
the first day of the race. The car suf
fered a 30-minute delay when leav
ing the starting gate and, as a result,
placed 13 out of 20. However, as
reported on the Stanford Solar Car
Project Web site, the team has a
positive outlook for the remainder
of the Challenge.
"Despite today's setbacks, we are
coming together as a team and will do
our best regardless of what happens,"
Hantsoo said.
