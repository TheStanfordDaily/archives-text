# Stanford's robotic car competes for $2M
## 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Racing Team will enter
its robotic car to compete this October in
the last of three stages in the DARPA
Grand Challenge 2005 autonomous
ground vehicle competition. The
Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or DARPA. ;innually sponsors
the competition to promote research in
the field of autonomous vehicles.
On June 6. Stanford's vehicle, Stanley,
advanced to the semilinalist round of the
competition, after completing three laps
on an S-shaped obstacle course in
Barstow, Calif. The winner of the compe
tition will receive a $2 million prize.

Stanley, a Diesel-powered
Volkswagen Touareg R-5. could pass
for an everyday SUV. give or take the
sensors on the rcxrf, the computer net
work in the back or the control panel in
the passenger seat. The car has only
one obvious missing feature — a driver.
Indeed, Stanley drives itself. The
Stanford RaangTeam began programming
the cir in July 2(XH using Gktail Positioning
System sens* >rs, an« Jar system, cameras iind
other features to help it detect its surround
ing> and maneuver anxmd them.
From September 27 to October 5,
Stanley's sensor features will be put to
the test. The 40 semifinalist, in the
DARPA competition will be nar
rowed to 20 competitors who will race

in the Grand Challenge on October 8.
"The DARPA site visit was essen
tially an abridged version of the Grand
Challenge." said team member David
Stavens, a computer science graduate
student. "Stanley was required to navi
gate a course at high speed, avoiding
obstacles while staving on the road."
The Grand Challenge will be held
on a 150-mile course from Los
Angeles to Lis Vegas. It must be
completed in less than 10 hours.

er science. Stanford's team will work

well prepared for the race.
"There are a few minor things
missing," he said. "Most notably, the
ability to drive under extended GPS
outages and the ability to back up
when there is no valid path left. We
hope to resolve these items shortly."

According to Stavens, the bulk of
Stanley's design has been completed, and
the team will work mainly on fine tuning
the vehicle before the competition.
"All of our technical design and
development is complete," he said.
"We now focus on two things. The
first is exhaustive testing of all of
Stanley's systems, both individually
and as a whole. The second is the addi
tion of certain functionality required
by the competition, for example, a sin
gle-button start sequence."
Team member David Orenstein,
public relations manager for the School
of Engineering, said it would be nice if
the team could return to campus with a
first place win, but its ultimate goal is to
contribute knowledge and innovations
to make transportation safer.

"For as or any team to win in
October —to complete the entire
course — would be a huge milestone in
robotics and artificial intelligence,"
Orenstein said. "It would be a shining
example of how far we've come in
enabling machines to think for them
selves in real-world, real-time situations.
Win or not, Stanley is contributing
many technical innovations to the
future of robotic cars."
He added that he hopes the
resulting technology will aid in the
development of driver assistance sys
tems that can protect both motorists
and pedestrians.
"About 43,000 people die on U.S.
streets and highways each year," he
said. "Cars smart enough to help drivers
avoid collisions could help save lives."
