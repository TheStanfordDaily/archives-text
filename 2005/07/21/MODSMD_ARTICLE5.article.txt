### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Racing Team will enter
its robotic car to compete this October in
the last of three stages in the DARPA
Grand Challenge 2005 autonomous
ground vehicle competition. The
Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or DARPA. ;innually sponsors
the competition to promote research in
the field of autonomous vehicles.
On June 6. Stanford's vehicle, Stanley,
advanced to the semilinalist round of the
competition, after completing three laps
on an S-shaped obstacle course in
Barstow, Calif. The winner of the compe
tition will receive a $2 million prize.

Stanley, a Diesel-powered
Volkswagen Touareg R-5. could pass
for an everyday SUV. give or take the
sensors on the rcxrf, the computer net
work in the back or the control panel in
the passenger seat. The car has only
one obvious missing feature — a driver.
Indeed, Stanley drives itself. The
Stanford RaangTeam began programming
the cir in July 2(XH using Gktail Positioning
System sens* >rs, an« Jar system, cameras iind
other features to help it detect its surround
ing> and maneuver anxmd them.
From September 27 to October 5,
Stanley's sensor features will be put to
the test. The 40 semifinalist, in the
DARPA competition will be nar
rowed to 20 competitors who will race

in the Grand Challenge on October 8.
"The DARPA site visit was essen
tially an abridged version of the Grand
Challenge." said team member David
Stavens, a computer science graduate
student. "Stanley was required to navi
gate a course at high speed, avoiding
obstacles while staving on the road."
The Grand Challenge will be held
on a 150-mile course from Los
Angeles to Lis Vegas. It must be
completed in less than 10 hours.
According to project leader Sebastian
Hi run, associate professor of comput
er science. Stanford's team will work
tirelessly to make sure that Stanley is
