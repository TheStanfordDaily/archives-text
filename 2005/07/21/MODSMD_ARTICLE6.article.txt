## Sketch The 						Death of Friendship 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
One of the more unpleasant aspects of growing
older is watching opportunities disappear. Some
times it's merely temporary; much that seems lost
in life comes back eventually. However, the death
of a chance is often a more permanent affair.
Take, for example, underage drinking. Once
you pass the age of 18 (or, like 457 in America),
that's it, a whole rite of passage is consigned to
memory. No more sneaking warm cans of beer to
the park (well, unless your career really nosedives).
Of course, not every passing slips by with such a
clear demarcation. Change can

often be a more subtle thing.
While there's a well-trodden
path from crushes and stolen
kisses to domestic bliss and the
conventional-ever-after, it's
hard to pick the point when the
random hook-ups will cease
and the subscription to "Mod
em Bride" will begin.
Sometimes subtle is just the
beginning. Occasionally life

switches on you in ways so unsuspected that you
don't even notice what you're losing until its de
cline is inevitable.
Before sordid pleasures of the flesh take hold,
most of us spend much of our time in the hunt fora
nobler, simpler, less penetrative form of compan
ionship: friendship. The pursuit of friendship is a
particularly human lust amongst the many human
cravings. And yet it dies.
Each time a kid has to sobbingly leave a "best
friend" behind and move on, well the invariable re
frain from older folk (sometimes thought, not spo
ken) is that these acquaintances are temporary —
the greatest friends we make are those in college.
Now, that's a sweeping generalization. And for
many people it's not true. Having got the reason
ableness out the way, though, we should probably
acknowledge that there's something to be said for
this particular assertion.
Friendships formed in dorms are tough and
deep. They're tempered in a heady mix of the
new. With long hours and late nights as shared ex
periences, the flutters of trepidation and anticipa
tion that accompany each new companion push

camaraderie to greater glory than most us will
ever experience again (unless of course you find
yourself part of a crack team of rogue scientists).
Sadly, though, the exhilaration of such bonding
comes at a heavy price. Once you top any pinnacle,
the waning is unavoidable.
You don't notice at first in grad school. In
the thrill of embracing a new environment it's
easy to kid yourself that the giddy college days
still continue.
Those awkward events that open each year's
proceedings seem like they will lead to new deep
and meaningful interactions, but alas, it never
works out like that.
Rather, secure in the knowledge that we al
ready have friends, we proceed without the forth
rightness that used to characterize our quests. A
little less honesty and openness, a little more cau
tion and care.
Inevitably, when everyone holds back, the al
liances we form are of a lower standard. And
being lower, we put in less time to maintain them.
Friendship dies.
Death is never a pleasant thing, even when it's
the intangible that chokes. There's a lurching
feeling in the pit of your stomach when you final
ly realize that one more nail has been hammered
into the coffin.
It's a terrifying thing to know that life can
change on you without warning. Well maybe I
should have taken the nights (and mornings) sit
ting at home sipping single malt as a sign.
Incidentally, I'm not saying that you'll never
make an acquaintance again — that's not true,
you'll make many. But acquiring a network of aca
demic contacts or neighborly social drinkers or
salsa partners is rarely friendship.
Friendship should need no activity but compa
ny to sustain it. And that sort of relationship be
comes harder and harder to find.
However, all is not lost. What breadth has van
ished could be replaced with depth. Perhaps you
no longer have your girls or your boys, but there's
always the hope that you're just about to find that
special someone. Though, given that you're at
Stanford and in grad school, I doubt it
