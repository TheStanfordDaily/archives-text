## Cooking with Tina 
### TINA LIN OPINIONS COLUMNIST 
Twenty-four hour open kitchen convenient
ly located in my very own apartment! No more
dining halls to control when and what I eat. No
more mass produced mystery dishes for me! I'll
get to cook whatever I want, whenever I want.
I'll get to eat all those delicious home cooked
meals I've been craving since I left home. Awe
some. That was a month and a half ago. I think
I've successfully cooked about three real
meals since then.
The other times I cooked were either spectac
ular failures that ended up in flames because I
was careless and didn't watch the timer, or they
were meals consisting of randomly thrown to
gether snack items. (Of course, cheese, crackers,
yogurt, apples and peanut putter work together
as a meal). There were many inherent shortcom
ings to this idealistic plan of cooking whatever

and whenever I want.
Wait, I have to cook!? Don't get me wrong. I
love cooking as a leisurely activity. The keyword
is "leisurely." Who wants to cook after a long day
at work? I want my food and I want it NOW. Who
wants to slave over a burning hot kitchen stove in
a greenhouse-like room that has no air condition
ing capabilities after a long day? And let's not for
get the most important question: who wants to do
dishes afterwards?
Sure, there is the miracle that is The Mi
crowave. If there is ever an Iron Chef Microwave
edition, I would definitely be one of the mi
crowave chef champions out there. However, one
can only take so much radiation-prepared food.
Sorry, but it's just not doing it for me.
Why don't 1 go out to eat? Man, I love going
out to eat. There are so many delicious places in
the area. If I could afford it, I would go out to eat
