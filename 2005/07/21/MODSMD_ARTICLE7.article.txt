# Hazards of Dorm Life
## Cooking with Tina 
### TINA LIN OPINIONS COLUMNIST 
Twenty-four hour open kitchen convenient
ly located in my very own apartment! No more
dining halls to control when and what I eat. No
more mass produced mystery dishes for me! I'll
get to cook whatever I want, whenever I want.
I'll get to eat all those delicious home cooked
meals I've been craving since I left home. Awe
some. That was a month and a half ago. I think
I've successfully cooked about three real
meals since then.
The other times I cooked were either spectac
ular failures that ended up in flames because I
was careless and didn't watch the timer, or they
were meals consisting of randomly thrown to
gether snack items. (Of course, cheese, crackers,
yogurt, apples and peanut putter work together
as a meal). There were many inherent shortcom
ings to this idealistic plan of cooking whatever

and whenever I want.
Wait, I have to cook!? Don't get me wrong. I
love cooking as a leisurely activity. The keyword
is "leisurely." Who wants to cook after a long day
at work? I want my food and I want it NOW. Who
wants to slave over a burning hot kitchen stove in
a greenhouse-like room that has no air condition
ing capabilities after a long day? And let's not for
get the most important question: who wants to do
dishes afterwards?
Sure, there is the miracle that is The Mi
crowave. If there is ever an Iron Chef Microwave
edition, I would definitely be one of the mi
crowave chef champions out there. However, one
can only take so much radiation-prepared food.
Sorry, but it's just not doing it for me.
Why don't 1 go out to eat? Man, I love going
out to eat. There are so many delicious places in
the area. If I could afford it, I would go out to eat
every night; ay, there's the rub. I
CANT afford it. Sure, I can eat at a
nice restaurant once in awhile, but a
starving college student's budget pret
ty much limits me to pizza and greasy
fast food. I'm pretty sure my arteries
harden from the mere thought of eat
ing at more fast food joints.
A ample of times my friends and I
tried looking fora late-night meal a few
nights ago. We were on a quest for some
"real" food. We were even willing to
spend a little bit more on something
nice. (When I say "late night," I mean 10
p.m. I feel old. Late night used to be
around 2 a.m.) We scrounged up and
down University Ave. and up and down
a seven-mile stretch of El Camino Real
fora place that was even open. Some
place where we could sit down and chat
... some place with a chef! Unfortunate
ly, pretty much everything in this area
shuts down at 9 p.m. We sadly settled for
some drive-through.
Maybe I'm just weird and whin
ing too much. Maybe no one else
thinks that there should be a larger
variety of good cheap food near cam
pus that is open at all hours. If these
places already exist, please let me
know. All I want is a place that serves
a variety of delicious, freshly-pre
pared, inexpensive food at any hour
and is close to campus. Is that too
much to ask for? Until then, I guess
I'll have to live by my microwave
cooking and fast food â€” or I could
hire you as my personal chef?

Yes, Tina meant to flambe that dish
yesterday. Save her from kitchen fires,
the microwave and unhealthy fast
food by suggesting tasty places for her
