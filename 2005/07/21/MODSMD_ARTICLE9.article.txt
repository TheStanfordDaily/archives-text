## Stanford Double-think 
### ANDREA RUNYAN OPINIONS COLUMNIST 
We're involved in a collective delusion. We
chronically deny the extent of our privilege, under
estimate our ability to change things in the world
and rationalize using our resources selfishly.
Some double-think I hear at Stanford:

• I'm not that rich. Com
pared to other Stanford stu
dents, perhaps you aren't, but
compared to most of the human
race, you are. Almost half the
people alive today live on less
than $2 a day.
• There's nothing I can do.
Bull. You're a Stanford stu
dent/alum/whatever. You have
immense resources at your dis-

posal, including the Stanford cachet.
• I'm going to help the world by applying (insert
subject here). Some of my friends want to study en
gineering and make ecologically-sound products
or renewable energy technologies, apply econom
ics to help third-world countries or use law to ben
efit the underprivileged or the environment.
This worries me. People enter treacherous
fields, learning skills that make them valuable to in
dustries and practices they detest, with the blind
hope they'll be able to use these skills to "help the
world." More often than not, they're sucked into in
dustries they formerly loathed.
I'm saddened when my friends major in eco

nomics, financial math, statistics, political science,
environmental engineering and such; not because
the subjects themselves are immoral, but because
they increase the risk that the people will go to the
dark side: Goldman Sachs, K Street, Exxon-Mobil
or the World Bank.
Maybe it's possible to help the world through
morally-suspect industries. But if one can have a
good affect on the world working in a stereotypi
cally "bad" industry, then one can have a bad af
fect on the world working in a "good" industry,
which takes us to the next misconception:
• AD I need to do to help the world is to become
a doctor, researcher, etc or join the Peace Corps.
As people who read my column last quarter might
have deduced. I'm dubious about the benefits of
most medicine, research, the World Bank and even
the Peace Corps. Anything connected to the gov
ernment or big industries probably isn't taking the
world in a direction I favor.
Yet even if you're working in the best of in
dustries, still you might not be making much of a
marginal "difference," since someone else would
be doing the job if you weren't. I laugh at how
people compete for the privilege of "helping the
world" as, for instance, journalists or doctors. In
my opinion, if you have to compete for your job
or if it's well-compensated, you probably aren't
changing much. Changing the world through jobs
is doubtful anyway (I think the biggest changes
are made outside of work), so I regret that people
