KRONOS KXOX/6S TO AVESS
If you hove on hourly port-time job on compus,
you moy soon use Kronos to enter hours worked.
Starting August 1. Stanford's Time and Leave System is getting overhauled. And since
reporting hours worked is the way you get paid for your part-time work, here's the
scoop: in Axess, look on the Employee Information Tab for Time and Leave Reporting.
Click the link to log in to Kronos.
• If you're on a PC, a Java 1.4.2_06 download occurs automatically if you do not
already have that version of Java.
• If you're on a Mac running less than OS 10.3.7, you must do system updates to get
the correct version of Java.
Once you have Java on your computer, you'll be set to go into Kronos to enter hours
worked. If you're not working in the first pay period in August (8/1-8/15), maybe you'll
use it when you return in the fall.
Note: Students who do not work in hourly, part-time jobs do not use Kronos; this applies
to postdoctoral students, graduate students with assistantships, and students receiving
financial aid where there is no hourly, part-time job.
To get ready:
• Ask your supervisor how you are expected to report your hours so you can get
paid; if Kronos is not used, perhaps a department system is used that feeds into
Kronos.
