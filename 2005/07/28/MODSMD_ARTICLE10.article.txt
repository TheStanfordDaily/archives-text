## The end of all education should be service to others
### ALEJANDRO RIVAS 
Weekly columnist Andrea Runvan is right;
most of us underestimate our ability to effect
change in the world. Last week she endorsed a
cynical attitude toward work and careers that fur
ther underestimates us.
First, she claimed the sciences and profession
al fields lend themselves to "the dark side." Sec
ond, she declared that competitive careers such
as medicine, research and government service do
not create positive change. Finally, she blithely
dismissed the notion that one can bring about

change through a career.
As someone who intends to pursue a career
tied to social change, 1 feel that while Runyan's
heart is in the right place, she should not underes
timate us and dismiss the possibility of a connec
tion between vocation and social change.
Certain fields may have bad track records
when it comes to social change, but advocating
that scholars abandon their academic passions
because it will be difficult to reconcile those pas
sions with their drive for social change will do
nothing to alter these track records.
If we discourage our most talented and most

motivated socially-conscious peers from working
to create change from within these poorly per
forming fields, then we will only ensure that those
fields never gain a social conscience. Allowing
our most talented to become cynical about
change through the "system" will guarantee that
change will not come through the "system." We
must work for change in and through all fields,
and we must encourage aspiring agents of change
to stand strong in the face of the allure of working
for only oneself and not for others.
Some may laugh at "how people compete
for the privilege of 'helping the world'" but

such competition demonstrates that there exists
a wealth of talented and educated individuals
who seek to use their advantages to give back to
society.
If we should lament anything about this com
petition, it should be the lack of knowledge con
cerning the many highly specialized jobs through
which one can give back to society. This broad ig
norance restricts the educated to a very narrow
range of careers.
Therefore, we should not discourage people
