## The 						end of all education should be service to others 
### ALEJANDRO RIVAS 
Weekly columnist Andrea Runvan is right;
most of us underestimate our ability to effect
change in the world. Last week she endorsed a
cynical attitude toward work and careers that fur
ther underestimates us.
First, she claimed the sciences and profession
al fields lend themselves to "the dark side." Sec
ond, she declared that competitive careers such
as medicine, research and government service do
not create positive change. Finally, she blithely
dismissed the notion that one can bring about

change through a career.
As someone who intends to pursue a career
tied to social change, 1 feel that while Runyan's
heart is in the right place, she should not underes
timate us and dismiss the possibility of a connec
tion between vocation and social change.
Certain fields may have bad track records
when it comes to social change, but advocating
that scholars abandon their academic passions
because it will be difficult to reconcile those pas
sions with their drive for social change will do
nothing to alter these track records.
If we discourage our most talented and most

motivated socially-conscious peers from working
to create change from within these poorly per
forming fields, then we will only ensure that those
fields never gain a social conscience. Allowing
our most talented to become cynical about
change through the "system" will guarantee that
change will not come through the "system." We
must work for change in and through all fields,
and we must encourage aspiring agents of change
to stand strong in the face of the allure of working
for only oneself and not for others.
Some may laugh at "how people compete
for the privilege of 'helping the world'" but

such competition demonstrates that there exists
a wealth of talented and educated individuals
who seek to use their advantages to give back to
society.
If we should lament anything about this com
petition, it should be the lack of knowledge con
cerning the many highly specialized jobs through
which one can give back to society. This broad ig
norance restricts the educated to a very narrow
range of careers.
Therefore, we should not discourage people
from going into medicine, for exam
ple. Instead, we must hold up more
careers and disciplines as means for
change. We must invite scholars
throughout academia to answer the
call to serve humanity, rather than
tell them that their knowledge is
overcompensated and tainted by
competition. After all, as Cesar
Chavez once said, "The end of all ed
ucation should surely be service to
others."
While some may say that one can
not change the world through work, 1
offer the following examples of indi
viduals working in the federal govern
ment to create positive change.
Leopoldo Miranda-Castro, a biol
ogist. established the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Partners for
Wildlife program in the Caribbean,
restoring more than 2,(XX) acres of
tropical habitat. Marcella Banks at the
U.S. General Services Administration
works to bring the information tech
nology we take for granted at Stanford
to disadvantaged Native American
tribal nations, educating their children

and improving their standards of liv
ing, while also sustaining their cultural
heritage.
Marsha Henderson of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services created a national health
campaign that reaches millions of
the nation's underserved women —
particularly women of color — with
practical, life-saving health infor
mation.
Finally, Terry Van Allen at the
U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development helped establish
a school of entrepreneurship for resi
dents in the impoverished Old Central
Carver Park neighborhood of Galve
ston, Tex. The school instructs and
counsels 50 residents on starting small
businesses to build a more prosperous
community.
You can learn more about these
great public servants and others at the
Partnership for Public Service's web
sit at
http://www.ourpublicservice.org.
There you can also learn how your
academic passion can be combined
with your passion for change to make
a career in federal public service.
The Partnership for Public Service
is a non-partisan, nonprofit organiza
tion dedicated to bringing back the
days when the best and brightest

dreamed of and sought a role in gov
ernment service.
Starting this fall, the Partnership
will team up with Stanford's Haas
Center for Public Service to raise the
profile of public service careers at
Stanford through the Partnership's
Call to Serve initiative. Through initia
tives like Call to Serve, the Partnership
is working to inspire a new generation
to public service and to transform the
way government works so young peo
ple with big dreams can make a differ
ence through government work.
The late Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-
Minn.) once remarked, "The future
will not belong to the cynics or to those
who stand on the sideline. The future
will belong to those who have passion,
and to those who are willing to make
the personal commitment to make our
country better."
A career in public service is an ef
fective and rewarding way to make
this personal commitment to make
our countrv and our world better.
