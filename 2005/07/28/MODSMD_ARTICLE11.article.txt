## Williams claims first Classic win 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When second-seeded Venus
Williams dispatched lucky
loser, Sania Mirza. 6-3, 6-2. in
front of a sold-out crowd at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium
on Wednesday, her carefully
chosen words going into the
match proved prophetic.
"I haven't had a lot of time
to prepare. I just want to go out
there and play," Williams said at
a press conference on Monday.
"It's important never to under
estimate anyone."
The crowd showed over
whelming support from the un
derdog who hails from India,
cheering especially loud when
Mirza broke Williams' serve in
the second set to narrow her
deficit to 2-4.
Williams explained that
playing a newcomer can be just
as challenging as a top-10 play
er, given that they have nothing
to lose from the match.
'i think she was just trying to
play whatever she could to
shock me," Williams said.
Mirza took her second

round showing against the ten
nis legend in stride.
"It's a good feeling when you
break the serve of one of the
best servers in the game," Mirza
explained.
The Bank of the West Clas
sic, which started Monday, and
wraps up this Sunday, draws
some of the biggest names from
the WTA circuit. Defending
champion Lindsay Davenport is
the top seed, while Patty Schny
der and Kim Clijsters are seed
ed third and fourth.
At the same time, the Tier 11
tournament serves as the start
ing grounds for newcomers to
the professional circuit. This
year, seven players make their
debut in the main draw, includ
ing 18-year-old Mirza.
Such variety in the players'
lineup makes for exciting
match-ups, even in the opening
rounds. On Tuesday, qualifier
Meghann Shaughnessy battled
for 2 1/2 hours before overtak
ing fifth-seeded Vera Zvonare
va in three sets, 6-3,1-6,7-6(6).

appearance of this year's Bank of the West Classic.
lentless tiebreak, Shaughnessy saved
matchpoint with an ace and fired an
other no-hitter to go up 7-6. Zvonare
va answered back with a timid 76
mile-per-hour second serve, allowing
Shaughnessy to blast a winner and ad
vance to the second round against
Daniela Hantuchova.
Notching a record 12 aces during
the match, Shaughnessy's demanding
level of play spoke to her career-high
No. 11 WTA ranking in 2(X)l. It said
little of the fact that she had to sift
through three qualifying matches be
fore reaching the main draw.
"It was a little bit tough mentally
for me to play qualies. which 1 don't
think I've played in for five or six
years," Shaughnessy said. "But I've
used it as an opportunity to build my
confidence, and I think it really
helped me today."
To kick off her seventh consecu
tive Bank of the West appearance,
Shaughnessy defeated Cardinal Alice
Barnes last Saturday, 7-5.6-2.
Barnes, a rising senior, received a
last-minute wildcard berth into the
tournament qualifiers.
"I had no clue I was playing until
Thursday," she said.
Barnes rounded out last season
with a No. 17 ITA ranking and a pol
ished 28-8 record. With no plans to go
professional after college, the Cam
bridge, UK, native still takes pride in
her ability to make a decent showing
against a pro-circuit veteran.
"I wasn't noticing a huge differ
ence between [her strokes and
mine]," Barnes said. "For me [and my
teammates], we're not miles behind
in ability, it's just that the pros take
every opportunity and pounce on it."
Barnes explained that her own
strong serves were easily matched
by Shaughnessy's impeccable ser
vice game.
"I couldn't get anywhere near her
first serve, so I couldn't get much of a

rhythm going on my return," she
said. "I realized pretty quickly that if
1 tried to play defensively, it wasn't
going to work."
For Shaughnessy, however, her
experience to-date at the competition
has been more a case of deja vu. The
No. 69 player had faced No. 15
Zvonareva five times before, with
Zvonareva claiming four of those
showdowns.
It is true that the Bank of the West
tournament kicks off the six-week
countdown to the U.S. Open. In that
spirit of clambering for hard-court ac
tion, it is also true that Shaughnessy
got the best of her Russian rival at the
2003 Open, outlasting her in the
round of 32 in three sets.
But on Tuesday, Shaughnessy was
reeling from last week's straight-sets
loss to Zvonareva in Cincinnati.
"I always say there's nothing
worse than being sent home by the
same player in two consecutive
tournaments," Shaughnessy told
the Associated Press. "I'm glad to
win if for nothing else to protect my
own sanity."
Another player on the quest to
remain cool and collected is none
other than the celebrated Williams.
In a record-breaking Wimbledon
final earlier this month. Williams
topped Davenport in three sets to
clinch her first Grand Slam title in
almost four years.
Ripe with images of the former
world No. 1 leaping in disbelieving
glee on Centre Court, speculation
abounds as to whether the Wimble
don victory signals a great comeback
on the 25-year-old's part.
Williams, who still holds onto a
No. 10 ranking and a total of five
Grand Slam honors, considers tire
less, no-frills hard work to be her pri
mary concern.
"I just think it's important for me
to continue on my same path,"
Williams said.
Later at Monday's press confer
ence, she added, "I feel that everyone
has their moment when they're not at
their best. It shows character to be
able to get through that."

In a tournament atmosphere de
scribed by Williams as "very fair," it
is only appropriate that every player
seems eager to give credit where
credit is due.
After No. 19 Jelena Jankovic
made quick work of last year's Bank
of the West semifinalist. No. 59 Amy
Frazier, the Serbian had only objec
tive words for her 6-0,6-3 victory.
"I think I played well," Jankovic
said at a press conference. "I don't
think she played bad either, I just
didn't give her any chances."
Jankovic will take on Williams in
the quarterfinals on Friday. Cli
jsters will headline today's action
against Ai Sugiyama. Match play

Barnes, a rising senior, received a
last-minute wildcard berth into the
tournament qualifiers.
"I had no clue I was playing until
Thursday," she said.
Barnes rounded out last season
with a No. 17 ITA ranking and a pol
ished 28-8 record. With no plans to go
professional after college, the Cam
bridge, UK, native still takes pride in
her ability to make a decent showing
against a pro-circuit veteran.
"I wasn't noticing a huge differ
ence between [her strokes and
mine]," Barnes said. "For me [and my
teammates], we're not miles behind
in ability, it's just that the pros take
every opportunity and pounce on it."
Barnes explained that her own
strong serves were easily matched
by Shaughnessy's impeccable ser
vice game.
"I couldn't get anywhere near her
first serve, so I couldn't get much of a

rhythm going on my return," she
said. "I realized pretty quickly that if
1 tried to play defensively, it wasn't
going to work."
For Shaughnessy, however, her
experience to-date at the competition
has been more a case of deja vu. The
No. 69 player had faced No. 15
Zvonareva five times before, with
Zvonareva claiming four of those
showdowns.
It is true that the Bank of the West
tournament kicks off the six-week
countdown to the U.S. Open. In that
spirit of clambering for hard-court ac
tion, it is also true that Shaughnessy
got the best of her Russian rival at the
2003 Open, outlasting her in the
round of 32 in three sets.
But on Tuesday, Shaughnessy was
reeling from last week's straight-sets
loss to Zvonareva in Cincinnati.
"I always say there's nothing
worse than being sent home by the
same player in two consecutive
tournaments," Shaughnessy told
the Associated Press. "I'm glad to
win if for nothing else to protect my
own sanity."
Another player on the quest to
remain cool and collected is none
other than the celebrated Williams.
In a record-breaking Wimbledon
final earlier this month. Williams
topped Davenport in three sets to
clinch her first Grand Slam title in
almost four years.
Ripe with images of the former
world No. 1 leaping in disbelieving
glee on Centre Court, speculation
abounds as to whether the Wimble
don victory signals a great comeback
on the 25-year-old's part.
Williams, who still holds onto a
No. 10 ranking and a total of five
Grand Slam honors, considers tire
less, no-frills hard work to be her pri
mary concern.
"I just think it's important for me
to continue on my same path,"
Williams said.
Later at Monday's press confer
ence, she added, "I feel that everyone
has their moment when they're not at
their best. It shows character to be
able to get through that."

In a tournament atmosphere de
scribed by Williams as "very fair," it
is only appropriate that every player
seems eager to give credit where
credit is due.
After No. 19 Jelena Jankovic
made quick work of last year's Bank
of the West semifinalist. No. 59 Amy
Frazier, the Serbian had only objec
tive words for her 6-0,6-3 victory.
"I think I played well," Jankovic
said at a press conference. "I don't
think she played bad either, I just
didn't give her any chances."
Jankovic will take on Williams in
the quarterfinals on Friday. Cli
jsters will headline today's action
against Ai Sugiyama. Match play
beeins at 11 a.m.
When second-seeded Venus
Williams dispatched lucky
loser, Sania Mirza. 6-3, 6-2. in
front of a sold-out crowd at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium
on Wednesday, her carefully
chosen words going into the
match proved prophetic.
"I haven't had a lot of time
to prepare. I just want to go out
there and play," Williams said at
a press conference on Monday.
"It's important never to under
estimate anyone."
The crowd showed over
whelming support from the un
derdog who hails from India,
cheering especially loud when
Mirza broke Williams' serve in
the second set to narrow her
deficit to 2-4.
Williams explained that
playing a newcomer can be just
as challenging as a top-10 play
er, given that they have nothing
to lose from the match.
'i think she was just trying to
play whatever she could to
shock me," Williams said.
Mirza took her second

round showing against the ten
nis legend in stride.
"It's a good feeling when you
break the serve of one of the
best servers in the game," Mirza
explained.
The Bank of the West Clas
sic, which started Monday, and
wraps up this Sunday, draws
some of the biggest names from
the WTA circuit. Defending
champion Lindsay Davenport is
the top seed, while Patty Schny
der and Kim Clijsters are seed
ed third and fourth.
At the same time, the Tier 11
tournament serves as the start
ing grounds for newcomers to
the professional circuit. This
year, seven players make their
debut in the main draw, includ
ing 18-year-old Mirza.
Such variety in the players'
lineup makes for exciting
match-ups, even in the opening
rounds. On Tuesday, qualifier
Meghann Shaughnessy battled
for 2 1/2 hours before overtak
ing fifth-seeded Vera Zvonare
va in three sets, 6-3,1-6,7-6(6).

appearance of this year's Bank of the West Classic.
lentless tiebreak, Shaughnessy saved
matchpoint with an ace and fired an
other no-hitter to go up 7-6. Zvonare
va answered back with a timid 76
mile-per-hour second serve, allowing
Shaughnessy to blast a winner and ad
vance to the second round against
Daniela Hantuchova.
Notching a record 12 aces during
the match, Shaughnessy's demanding
level of play spoke to her career-high
No. 11 WTA ranking in 2(X)l. It said
little of the fact that she had to sift
through three qualifying matches be
fore reaching the main draw.
"It was a little bit tough mentally
for me to play qualies. which 1 don't
think I've played in for five or six
years," Shaughnessy said. "But I've
used it as an opportunity to build my
confidence, and I think it really
helped me today."
