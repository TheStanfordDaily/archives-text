## Williams claims first Classic win 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When second-seeded Venus
Williams dispatched lucky
loser, Sania Mirza. 6-3, 6-2. in
front of a sold-out crowd at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium
on Wednesday, her carefully
chosen words going into the
match proved prophetic.
"I haven't had a lot of time
to prepare. I just want to go out
there and play," Williams said at
a press conference on Monday.
"It's important never to under

explained.
The Bank of the West Clas

champion Lindsay Davenport is
the top seed, while Patty Schny

ed third and fourth.
At the same time, the Tier 11
tournament serves as the start
ing grounds for newcomers to
the professional circuit. This
year, seven players make their
debut in the main draw, includ
ing 18-year-old Mirza.
Such variety in the players'
lineup makes for exciting
match-ups, even in the opening
rounds. On Tuesday, qualifier
Meghann Shaughnessy battled
for 2 1/2 hours before overtak
