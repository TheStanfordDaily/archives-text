# Tennis alumni honored
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
Title IX is a beautiful thing for
athletics or a collegiate sports
tragedy, depending on who you talk
to, but the stories of two Stanford
tennis alumni make it look a whole
lot like the former.
Say what you want about imple
mentation problems and the affects
on men's sports — Susan Hodgman
Anawalt will tell you precisely the ar
gument that makes Title IX a praise
worthy statute.
"|ln the years prior to Title IX|, it
was a different world for women in
athletics," she said. "Girls today
can't even imagine a world where
there wouldn't be athletic opportu
nity for them. Title IX put the idea
out there."
This morning, Anawalt and Patty
Fendick-McCain were inducted into
the USTA Northern California Hall
of Fame. These women grew up on
opposite sides of Title IX's imple
mentation — Anawalt was a Stan
ford freshman in 1959, Fendick-Mc-
Cain graduated from the University
in 1987 — but both managed to bend
perceptions of what was possible for
female tennis players.
Anawalt only spent two years at
Stanford — she proudly graduated
from UC-Berkeley — during a time
when there was no official women's
tennis team on the Farm. The Michi

gan native instead practiced her serve
with the men's team, a move that
then-Stanford senior and current ten
nis director Dick Gould said was un
conventional for the time.
Anawalt found her opportunity to
shine in 1976, when she began com
peting on the senior circuit after sev
eral tennisless years spent raising her
sons and heading up peace efforts in
Northern California. Since 1976,
Anawalt has won 14 national champi
onships, known as gold halls and 14 sil
ver balls in both singles and doubles
competitions. She has represented the
U.S. on many international teams and
spent a considerable amount of her
energy lobbying for better conditions
for women in tennis.
"I feel very proud and honored."
Anawalt said of her Hall of Fame in
duction.
Fendick-McCain, on the other
hand, led a career when the stigmas
attached to women in sports had
began to fade. She was recently
named the head women's coach at
Texas after eight years at Washing
ton, and through her determination
to seize each opportunity, has earned
a permanent place in Stanford histo
ry-
The Cardinal won team national
championship honors three of the
four years that the she spent playing
in the squad's top singles spot. Fen
