# Lance's legacy lives strong in us already
## 
### 
Last Sunday, after Lance Armstrong's sev
enth Tour de France victory, a reporter asked
him what he thought his legacy would be.
Lance modestly shook off the question, saying.
"I firmly believe that an individual cannot de
cide how he's remembered. 1 can't be in charge
of dictating what it says, but in 15,20 years, we'll
see what the legacy is."
To me, though, it's simple: Lance simply has

more heart than anyone else.
No, really. The seven-time
Tour de France champ's heart
is 10 percent larger than that of
the average male, 30 percent
larger when he is in peak physi
cal condition. It should belong
to a man who stands at 7 feet,
not Armstrong's 5'10." His
body converts 23 percent of its

oxygen into muscle power, near the highest rate
ever recorded. In a recently published study by
Dr. Edward F. Coyle, who has been observing
Armstrong since his first Tour victory, it is shown
that, "even in a de-trained state," Armstrong's
conversion rate of oxygen to muscle is "in the
range of the highest values that normal men can
achieve with training."
Basically, the man was born to cycle. He is
one of the most-tested athletes of all time, be
cause of his cancer and because he allowed it.
We have charts and graphs that document
every detail of what, from a physical standpoint
makes Lance, well. Lance.
In addition to having the right body type, he
also trained so hard that, as he said in an inter
view after his last Tour on Sunday, "we took a
three-week event and turned it into a 12-month
event. This is an obsession for us."
He assembled a group of technicians in a
smattering of fields, known as the F-l group,
which ranges from aerodynamics specialists
to sports nutritionists. The group has spent
seven years improving his gear, his diet and
his exercise routine.
The way he has revolutionized cycling over
the last seven years is incredible. Armstrong and
his team have taken a race that was based most
ly in tradition and boiled it down into an exact
science-a fact that some Tour purists lament.
But you don't need a calculator to figure
out what made Lance one of the greatest cy
clists of all-time, and one of the most revered
athletes of our era.
You just needed to watch his face when he
was on the bike in the final time trial of his ca
reer. It was a look of steely determination — jaw
clenched, lips curled, teeth bared. He started
sprinting for the finish line with 5 kilometers left,
going at a clip that most professional cyclists
reach only 100 meters or so from the final ban
ner, and he beat Jan Ullrich by a handy 23 sec
onds.
It was the same kx>k that set in on the toughest
hills, in the most critical stages, while his oppo
nents grimaced and gasped for air. It was a lcxik
that television announcers used as a barometer.
"Lance has got that kx>k on his face again."
the usually calm, glib British announcer would
excitedly say. He would chart the look: "We last
saw it during Stage 12, when he took off and put
a minute between himself and his main rivals.
They had better lcxik out."
It was the look of a killer. It didn't matter
what place he happened to be in or how fast his
legs were churning. Pretty much, when Lance's
face set into that familiar l<x)k, it was over. He
flashed it to Jan Ullrich on I'Alpe d'Huez during


S«an Howell
Stage 10 of the 2001 tour, when he
stared the German down after feigning
fatigue, passed him at the bottom of
the hill and took off.
While other riders suffered. Lance
seemed to feed off of the pain. He just
didn't seem to get tired.
When he was coming up through
the ranks of pro cycling, he made a
name for himself in long, one-day
races, because he was able to cycle well
for 250 miles — and then speed up and
leave opponents in the dust. He won
the World Championship in 1993 in
such a race, when he tore out from the
peloton on the final hill and rode alone
to the finish.
Bike racing, especially in the
Tour, is suffering, and Lance was
able to dole out pain as well as he
was able to endure it.
As his coach. Michael Carmichael,
said, "To grind out a win in a long, one
day cycling race, you've got to want to
intiict pain. Ever read how people say
it's really personal when you stab
somebody? Well, a bike race is that
kind of personal."
For Lance, bike racing has always
been about his ability to take his own
personal pain and turn it into some
thing positive. His father abandoned
him and his mother, only 19 at the time,
when Lance was two. But he became a
great swimmer and world champion
tri-athlete by age 17, when the world of
professional cycling came knocking on
his door after hearing about the boy
who kept up with some of the best bik
ers in the United States during his
triathlon competitions.
Armstrong fought through Stage
Four testicular cancer which had spread
into his lungs and his brain. His doctors
told him that he had a 50-50 chance of
survival, but one of them told him after
wards that his chances were more like 3
percent, explaining that it was one of
the worst cases he had ever seen.
The one time when science was not

on Lance Armstrong's side.
But he was even able to turn that
into a positive. Without the cancer,
who knows if he would have won the
Tour? It changed his racing strategy,
and as it turned out, the 12 pounds he
lost off his upper body may have been
the difference between previous Tours
— he didn't complete the first one he
raced in — and the last seven.
Last week, for some ungodly rea
son— partly inspired by Lance — I
found myself biking up a fairly steep
hill in my town (read: slight grade).
Sweat dripping down my pained face,
gasping for air like Armstrong's belea
guered opponents, 1 turned a corner
near the top of the hill. Painted on the
ground, in white block letters, was the
phrase, "LANCE IS GOD."
It made me laugh a little that some
one would take the time to paint it. but
those words rang true as 1 struggled up
the hill, thinking about the monstrous
ascents that Armstrong takes on in the
Tour and feeling a sense of solidarity
with somebody who was obviously so
inspired by Lance that he felt the need
to write it out on a public street. I let
out a "whoop" and made it to the top.
In the end. Armstrong's legacy will
be about much more than his inborn
physical gifts or his unprecedented
amount of meticulous training. A large
part of his legacy will be the fact that he
overcame the odds, beat cancer and
became a champion. Seven times.
But it will have as much to do with
those things as it will with the way in
which he inspired and helped others to
overcome their own pain. His founda
tion sold over 50 million of the now
ubiquitous one-dollar Live Strong
bracelets and has raised tens of millions
of dollars on top of that. Since the foun
dation's inception in 1998, rates of can
cer survival in America have increased
every year. Armstrong's foundation
has played a role in that. Cancer sur
vivors waited at the starts and finishes
of Lance's races, content to catch a
glimpse of their hero. The fact that he is
a champion cyclist is only a part of that.
1 lis legacy might just be as much
about his big heart as it is about ...
well, his big heart.
