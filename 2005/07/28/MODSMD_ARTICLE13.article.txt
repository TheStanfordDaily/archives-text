# Lance's legacy lives strong in us already
## 
### 
Last Sunday, after Lance Armstrong's sev
enth Tour de France victory, a reporter asked
him what he thought his legacy would be.
Lance modestly shook off the question, saying.
"I firmly believe that an individual cannot de
cide how he's remembered. 1 can't be in charge
of dictating what it says, but in 15,20 years, we'll
see what the legacy is."
To me, though, it's simple: Lance simply has

more heart than anyone else.
No, really. The seven-time
Tour de France champ's heart
is 10 percent larger than that of
the average male, 30 percent
larger when he is in peak physi
cal condition. It should belong
to a man who stands at 7 feet,
not Armstrong's 5'10." His
body converts 23 percent of its

oxygen into muscle power, near the highest rate
ever recorded. In a recently published study by
Dr. Edward F. Coyle, who has been observing
Armstrong since his first Tour victory, it is shown
that, "even in a de-trained state," Armstrong's
conversion rate of oxygen to muscle is "in the
range of the highest values that normal men can
achieve with training."
Basically, the man was born to cycle. He is
one of the most-tested athletes of all time, be
cause of his cancer and because he allowed it.
We have charts and graphs that document
every detail of what, from a physical standpoint
makes Lance, well. Lance.
In addition to having the right body type, he
also trained so hard that, as he said in an inter
view after his last Tour on Sunday, "we took a
three-week event and turned it into a 12-month
event. This is an obsession for us."
He assembled a group of technicians in a
smattering of fields, known as the F-l group,
which ranges from aerodynamics specialists
to sports nutritionists. The group has spent
seven years improving his gear, his diet and
his exercise routine.
The way he has revolutionized cycling over
the last seven years is incredible. Armstrong and
his team have taken a race that was based most
ly in tradition and boiled it down into an exact
science-a fact that some Tour purists lament.
But you don't need a calculator to figure
out what made Lance one of the greatest cy
clists of all-time, and one of the most revered
athletes of our era.
You just needed to watch his face when he
was on the bike in the final time trial of his ca
reer. It was a look of steely determination — jaw
clenched, lips curled, teeth bared. He started
sprinting for the finish line with 5 kilometers left,
going at a clip that most professional cyclists
reach only 100 meters or so from the final ban
ner, and he beat Jan Ullrich by a handy 23 sec
onds.
It was the same kx>k that set in on the toughest
hills, in the most critical stages, while his oppo
nents grimaced and gasped for air. It was a lcxik
that television announcers used as a barometer.
"Lance has got that kx>k on his face again."
the usually calm, glib British announcer would
excitedly say. He would chart the look: "We last
saw it during Stage 12, when he took off and put
a minute between himself and his main rivals.
They had better lcxik out."
It was the look of a killer. It didn't matter
what place he happened to be in or how fast his
legs were churning. Pretty much, when Lance's
face set into that familiar l<x)k, it was over. He
flashed it to Jan Ullrich on I'Alpe d'Huez during
