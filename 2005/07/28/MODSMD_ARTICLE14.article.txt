## Barnhart, Buehler anchor U-21 women 
### 
The U-21 women's national soccer team
has won eight of the last nine Nordic Cups,
often with a little help from Stanford prod
ucts. This year, it was recent graduate Nicole
Barnhart and redshirt sophomore Rachel
Buehler that pitched in the Cardinal style, as
the U.S. defeated Norway for the Nordic Cup
yesterday in Karlskoga, Sweden.
Barnhart is a member of the Senior Na
tional Team, but was allowed to start between
the posts for the U.S. as one of two permitted
over-age players. Her presence was largely an
insurance policy for an already strong U.S. de
fense, which tied up Norway's aggressive
charge in the 4-1 victory.
Buehler, who redshirted last season to play
for the IJ-19 national team, played center
back in the tournament. The U.S. team al
lowed only two goals in the course of this
year's competition.
Kirk takes bronze at Worlds
The winner of the 100-meter breaststroke
at the FINA World Championships was an
Australian, but the California Bay Area
snapped up the silver and bronze medals in
the event to assert West Coast swimming

dominance for the I,oooth time.
Stanford alumna Tara Kirk, who has con
tinued to swim under the direction of retired
Cardinal coach Richard Quick, won the
bronze medal in her specialty event, touching
the wall at 1:07.43. California's Jessica Hardy
claimed the silver after setting a world record
in the event's semifinals.
Australia's Leisel Jones, the Olympic
bronze medalist in the KM) breast, won the
race in 1:06.62.
Azevedo, Villa leading U.S. water polo
Former Stanford athletes Tony Azevedo
and Brenda Villa also competed at the World
Championships in Montreal. The U.S. men
will miss the medal round, but Azevedo still
managed to become the competition's fifth
highest scorer, racking up 10 goals on 19 shots
for the Americans.
Villa, on the other hand, advances with the
American women's team, and is the squad's
top scorer. She also has the second highest
number of goals among the tournament's
women (16 goals on 29 shots).
The FIN A World Championships will con
tinue through Sunday.
