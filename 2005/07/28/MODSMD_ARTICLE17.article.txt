# Honesty and humor converge
## Romance buds among loners in indy flick 
### JOSH STERN SUMMER FILM CRITIC 
Go see "Me and You and Everyone We
Know." It is an astoundingly intelligent and
moving film ("back and forth" aside), and has
won numerous first-rate awards (including
some at Cannes and Sundance). Not convinced
yet? Fine. Read on.

tr

While it is at times an incredibly funny film,
it's hardly a comedy. The movie follows the
lives of a handful of middle-class Americans,
focusing on the neuroses and loneliness that
mark their lives. The characters are extremely
believable, and most possess an undeniable
charm. They may be lonely, but in a bemused
rather than depressed sort of way.
The central plot follows recently separated
Richard and his two sons Peter and Robbie.
The film starts immediately after Richard's
separation and traces a budding romance be
tween him and the charmingly squirrelly video
artist Christine (played marvelously by writer
and director Miranda July). Other engaging
characters of different ages and from various
walks of life are explored along the way, and
despite their differences they all share the same
sense of aloneness.
The film possesses a breathtakingly emo

tional honesty. July abandons pretense and
offers her audience truly intimate characters.
And she succeeds in capturing the complex
struggle and emotional fallout experienced
by each.
The sincerity and candor of the whole pro
duction only makes the comedic scenes that
follow even funnier — simultaneously moving
and hilarious. But hey, isn't that the way most
genuine humor works in the real world? The

funniest of these scenes involves pre-pubes
cent sexuality, and Freudian psychology all at
once becomes disturbingly hilarious.
July truly opens herself up to her audience,
and you'll come away from the film feeling as
though you've just had a heart-to-heart with an
intimate friend. 1 found myself grinning the en
tire time. Unless you hate good movies or your
self, you owe it to yourself to go see "Me and
You and Everyone We Know."
