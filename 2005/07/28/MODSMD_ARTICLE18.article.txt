# How to stave off that summer quarter ennui
## 
### ADAM SCHAEFER SUMMER CAPITAL VENTURIST 
A significant fraction of the summer is
gone, and as a Stanford student, you have no
doubt used this time to make gains on your
path to success and fortune. Whether you have
spent the summer selflessly reaching out to im
poverished Micronesians, networking at a lu
crative D.C. internship or establishing a rec
ommendation-generating relationship with an
international leader in biotechnology, you
have excelled and learned much about your
self and humanity.
But let's face it, when you're not out saving
the world, you're pretty damn bored. Am I
right? So voila! Here are some sizzling summer
tips to spice up your off-campus quarter and an
swer your inevitable question: "It's vacation —
what the hell have I been doing?!"
Listen to some fresh, quality music
Use iTunes, myTunes, Amazon or the old
fashioned analog "walk into a music store" style
to acquire these hot albums of twenty-aught
five. Pick up a couple of these and give your
tired collection of Bach, 50, Dave and anime

soundtracks a rest.
LCD Soundsystem: "LCD Soundsystcm"
(DFA). A two-disc must-have collection of
solid party tracks and thoughtful ironic jabs at
the my-vinyl-can-beat-up-your-vinyl under
ground. James Murphy makes imitation and
extrapolation an art, mixing subtlety, irony,
history and cowbell in an elaborate cocktail of
melodious hat-tips to Santana, the White
Album, the Talking Heads, the Fall, the Son
ics [...the Sonics...] and oh yes, Daft Punk.
Good music for driving fast, making out or
feeling superior to people who don't own this
album.
The Hold Steady: "Separation Sunday"
(Frenchkiss). Craig Finn headlines this band
from Minneapolis. It will make you feel like the
gritty, savvy hardcore bar savage that you
aren't. Great if you just broke up with someone
or if your summer goals involve stabbing some
one to death with a splintered bottle of MD
20/20 because he sold you some poisoned junk.
The album also has a resonant religious theme
to supplement the more overt themes of vio
lence, abuse, exploitation and masochism.
Read a popularly impenetrable book

Nothing says "summer" like a vast collection
of bizarre phrases and syntactically outrageous
sentences that have baffled readers and critics
for decades. Pick up one of these novels and dis
play it prominently so that your coworkers and
fellow commuters can marvel at what a literary
spelunker you are.
Ulysses — James Joyce. Why not? Millions
of people have tried to read it, and it may serve
as an interesting conversation piece with those
higher-ups who aren't impressed just by the fact
that you go to Stanford. Prepare yourself with
some intellectual ammunition when Joyce
comes up in a Fall Quarter discussion section.
"Oh, 'Ulysses'? Yeah, I've looked at the words
in that book."
Naked Lunch — William S. Burroughs.
Alternate idea: Fear and Loathing. If any
thing, this text is an exercise in exciting diction
and intimidating junkie jargon. The story is
solid as well. Follow "characters" as they live
out absurd scenarios you'll unavoidably start
to dream about.
Harry Potter VI —J.K. Rowling. J/K —
noi worth your time unless you
own the previous live books, at
least then it's an e-Bay investment
opportunity. Spoilers — none. It's
everything you'd expect, but some
how, less.

A new season of "The Real
World" is underway, and what bet
ter way to spend those summer
nights than living vicariously
through Melinda, Danny, Wes, Ne
hemiah, the semi-hot girl, the Army
chick and the ugly one? Watch as
these seven strangers defy logic and
reason in their attempts to find love
and 15 minutes of pseudo-fame in
Austin, Tex. And if Andy Milonakis
isn't a part of your soul just yet, tune
into the Sunday Stew — besides
watching Xibit serve yet another
season of community service, you
can see a pudgy New York pre-pu
bescent insult passers-by and rap
about wearing pancakes and
bologna.
