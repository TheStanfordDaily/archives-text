## PICK(S) OF THE WEEK 
### CALEY ANDERSON SUMMER COUCH POTATO 
Summer is notorious for large blockbuster
films, but if you don't believe in paying $10 to see
one likely lousy movie, it can also be a good time
to catch up on the ones you missed during the
school year. While Flicks makes an effort to
bring mainstream cinema to campus, homework
keeps most of us tied to our desks on Sunday
evenings. So for those of you who want to check
out what you missed, here's a list of the DVDs
released this week:
"Guess Who" — Ashton Kutcher and
Bernie Mac attempt to recreate "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner" — attempt being the opera
tive word — but unless you have a large crush
on Kutcher (I know you still have that Aber
crombie bag under your bed) or a deep love for
the "Bernie Mac Show," head on over to the
classics section and pick up the brilliant and
much more entertaining original starring Sid
ney Poitier. Kutcher and Mac are occasionally
laugh-out-loud funny, but the movie as a whole
lacks substance.
"Alexander" — This movie serves one pur

pose and one purpose only: three hours of back
ground noise while you do what you do best with
the person you arc watching this movie with
(and I don't mean Backgammon, buddy). Well,
maybe that's unfair. If you're running low on
coasters...
"Million Dollar Baby" — (I know it came
out two weeks ago, but I don't care. Rent it any
way). Clint Eastwood's masterpiece owned the
Oscars this year, and up until I saw the movie last
week, I didn't understand the hoopla. I had been
advised not to see it because of the "depressing
ending," but I walked away feeling more im
pressed then depressed. Eastwood masterfully
weaves together the story of Frankie and Mag
gie (played by Eastwood and a phenomenal Hi
lary Swank, respectively), who each have noth
ing else in their lives except boxing, and then,
slowly, each other.
Keep in mind, boxing is one of my least fa
vorite sports — but this is not a boxing movie.
It is a movie about how each character evolves
and ultimately achieves a great dream, which
happens to include some pretty serious blood
shed. The scene where Frankie cracks Mag
gie's broken nose back into place so she can
continue the round is grisly, but realistic.
That's why the ending didn't bring me down —
it never strayed from realism. It's a heavy
movie for sure, but well worth the two hours
and a much worthier pick than anything else
coming out this week.
