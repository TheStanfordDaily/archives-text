# Video games go social
## Join together in nerdiness! Check out the new flock of multiplayer games 
### ERIC FORD SUMMER GAMING AUTHORITY 
With the release of the Nintendo DS
and Sony's PSP, there has been a revolu
tion in the world of multiplayer gaming on
the run. No longer do gamers require cum
bersome connection cables or extra
adapters to play against your buddies
while you're on the go. In fact, there are
many times nowadays when you only need
one copy of the game, a godsend for
gamers that have poor friends (yet, still
own the hand-held with their meager one
title). So, for the rare nerd that has other
friends to game with, here's a look at the
hottest multiplayer games to hit the
shelves this summer.
Lumines (PSP) — Lumines is hands
down one of the best titles currently avail
able on Sony's portable, and it gets my
thumbs-up as the best puzzle titles of this
generation of games. The premise is sim
ple — create same colored cubes of
blocks falling from the top of the screen.
A moving wand that's in sync with the
beat of the current song sweeps by to take
out the cubes that are made. Addicting
and fun as hell, the game only gets better
as the PSP offers wireless multiplayer for
two gamers to go head-to-head stealing
screen space and trying to get the other to
overflow his or her screen. This is a must
own title for the PSP
Super Mario DS (Nintendo DS) —
One of the launch titles for the DS, Mario
DS, shows exactly how powerful the Nin
tendo DS really is, emulating the now clas
sic Nintendo 64 version. But the big sur
prise was what never made it into the con
sole legend — 4 player wireless multiplay
er mode. Gamers enter into a free for all
battle with their competitors trying to col
lect the most stars and coins and using all
the famed Mario moves we've come to
love. Its simple, fun. fast and everything
that gamers should expect from the big N.
Check it out if you're one of the two peo

ple who bought a DS and not this title.
Bomberman DS (Nintendo DS) —
This is multiplayer gold. The recently re
leased Bomberman DS features a pletho
ra of game modes that offer a unique
twist on the classic Bomberman formula.
The premise is simple. You're locked in a
puzzle-filled room with other players and
the object is to trap them by laying strate
gic bombs and killing them in the flaming
aftermath. Over the years, revenge
modes, new power-ups for taking out
your foes and different rule sets have
been added. This title takes all the great
ness of the previous versions and kicks it
up a notch with one cartridge multi-play.
Now your friends don't have an excuse
not to play as long as they have a DS on
hand. Only got two players? You can
place up to eight computer opponents on
screen. Bomberman has always been a
mainstay for multiplayer mayhem, and
this title takes every thing above and be
yond. Go buy it now, and make some
friends (then blow them up).
