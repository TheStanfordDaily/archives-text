### TAM VO SUMMER BACKSEAT DRIVER 
Road trips don't always have to mean stolen
cars, hookers and forties. Imagine a drive that starts
on a fogless afternoon in SF's Hayes Valley, then
turns south toward Los Angeles and Orange Coun
ty, where stops don't mean getting pulled over by
the Camaro cops in King City. The following San
Francisco stops will reinforce you for the long drive
ahead.
Minnie Wilde (1592 Laguna Street, www.min
niewilde.com) — I hate parting with fashion se
crets, but I spent so many years trying to find clothes
that fit (that weren't from Limited Too or the chil
dren's department) that it'd be a crime for me to
keep it to myself. This tucked away store is an ex
plosion of color and '60s and '70s inspired retro
style that begs for you to spend all that money you
were saving for fall tuition.
The spring / summer line includes an unbeliev
ably soft, stretchy keyhole top with flowered trim
and a Peter-Pan collar in bright colors, as well as the
most comfortable fitted corduroy culottes with
striped lining and detailed buttons. Accessorize
your new outfit with a snazzy tote bag by the Sper
ber sisters of 31 Corn Lane (www.3lcornlane.com).
A new, larger location just opened in the Mission
district (3266 21st St.) in San Francisco. So head

over there and say hi to Minnie Wilde's designers
Terri and Ann. Forget the mall and support your in
dependent designers and DIY artists!
Frjtz (579 Hayes St., www.frjtzfries.com) — The
place bills itself as a "Belgian fries, crepes and DJ
art teahouse." The main attraction is the non-Free
dom fries, which will cause you to ask, "Have 1 ever
eaten potatoes as real as these before?" The answer
is no, as the piping hot, lightly salted slabs, wedged
into a paper cone that's tucked into a silver serving
glass, will cause you to wonder how you could have
ever settled for MickeyD's French Fries again. Let's
run through the list of 15 amazingly eclectic dipping
sauces: strawberry mustard, pesto mayonnaise,
curry ketchup, Thai-chili ketchup, ginger orange
mayo. Kalamata olive ketchup, chipotle re
moulade, creamy wasabi mayo, caper-onion
ketchup, spicy yogurt-peanut, balsamic mayo,
smoky honey-mustard, roasted pepper mayo,
jalapeno ketchup and BBQ. Phew. If that selection
doesn't have you convinced, maybe the delicious
crepes, named after artists like Pollack and Goya,
and weekly live music will.
True Sake (560 Hayes St., www.truesake.com)
— Just because 1 said my road trip didn't involve
forties didn't mean that it was drier than Admit
Weekend. The whole point of the trek down south
was a friend's 21st birthday party, and what 21st
birthday party would be complete without... a

pinata? Substitute "sake juiceboxes" for "pinata,"
and you've got a hip gift that demands to be
wrapped in something better than a brown paper
bag from Ernie's. There are nearly KX) varieties of
sake here, ranging from $4 (the juiceboxes are $8
each) to $180 a bottle. There's no other store like it
in San Francisco, so pick up a few bottles (or boxes,
which can be stashed conveniently in the glove
compartment) of this fresh alternative to tap water.
Oxenrose Salon (500 Hayes St. www.oxenros
esalon.com. cuts start at $40) — On a rainy Tues
day morning during Winter quarter last year. 1
Googled "SF best hair salons" and randomly chose
Oxenrose from the reviews. It was the best spur-of
the-moment ditch-dav haircut I've ever got gotten
(meaning my best friend and I decided to cut class
after pulling all-nighters and drive to SF at 9 a.m. in
stead. forgetting that nothing opens before 10 or
11). Oxenrose's site boasts that the salon "has been
taming the unruly beast since the rash of wanton
blow-drying began." I practically fell asleep during
my haircut from a lack of sleep, but the razor-cut
asymmetrical textured bob I was sporting after
wards didn't show how many times I nodded off
(five).
Next week: Sometimes, the destination matters
more than the journey. This backseat driver will
share her favorite Southern California spots to jus
tify speeding on the 1-5.
