### RICARDO GILB CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four Stanford football players belted out
some a cappella tunes at a fundraiser in Palo
Alto on Saturday, July 23, helping to raise
money for Bay Area charities that help "eman
cipated" foster youth or foster children who
have turned 18, who may be struggling to find
affordable housing and other support services,
according to the California Department of
Social Services.
Jeff Pollock, vice president of Pollock
Financial in Portola Valley, was an event chair
for the fundraiser. He heard about the Stanford
football singers and asked Stanford co-terminal
student J.R. Lemon, an intern at Pollock
Financial and a member of the a cappella group,
if the football guys would sing at the fundraiser.
Shana Morrison, daughter of Van Morrison,
and her band. Caledonia, also performed at the

event, and various emancipated foster youth
shared their experiences with an audience of
about 50 people, made up mostly of local
Morrison fans.
The fundraiser was held at the Fire Circle
Amphitheater, part of the Lucie Stern
Community Center, on Middlefield Road. All
profits from ticket sales and from the silent auc
tion will be donated to three charities: First
Place Fund for Youth, an Oakland-based group
which helps emancipated kids move into their
own apartments; Jeremiah's Promise, an orga
nization in Palo Alto that maintains a group
house for emancipated young women; and
Child Advocates of Santa Clara and San Mateo
Counties, which helps provide court-appointed
advocates for foster children.
The event was organized by the Heart of
Silicon Valley, or HOSV, a Palo Alto organiza
tion founded in 2002. The HOSV has raised
thousands of dollars for various charities by

hosting events like this one which, according to
its Web site, "brings people together through
music."
Lewis Greer, who serves on the managing
board of the HOSV. kicked off the event by
engaging his listeners in a brief activity.
"Before we start. 1 want everybody to move,
just one or two seats," he said. "Now, move
again. You can move back to your original seat
if you'd like. You see how hard it is to move
once you've established yourself in one loca
tion, even when it's your seat. Now imagine
changing homes nine times in nine years."
Greer's introduction was an attempt to com
municate the feeling of being a child in
California's foster care system to the audience.
Foster children move an average of six times
while in the system, Greer said.
Nearly three-quarters of foster children in
California experience some type of physical,
sexual or emotional abuse, he added. And each

year in California, about 3,(XX) 18-year-olds
leave the system, roughly 200 of which live in
the Bay Area, said Susan Hill, director of devel
opment at the First Place Fund. Of these 3,000,
about two-thirds do not have a home, and many
end up homeless, living in cars or with friends.
Hill said.
Celico Asidanya, a cheerful 18-year-old who
was recently emancipated, attended the event
and said that the First Place Fund helped her
find an apartment in the East Bay on her 18th
birthday.
It was"the best gift I ever had in my life,"
she said.
Asidanya said she entered the foster care
system after it became impossible for her to live
with her own family. Like most in the foster
care system, Asidanya frequently moved hous
es and many provided terrible living situations,
she explained.
"I've been pretty much on my
own since I was 15," Asidanya said.
"[My foster parents] didn't care
what I did, where I went or what
time I came home. Many just do it
for the money."
A foster family collects around
$600 to $800 from the government
for taking in a child, she added.
Some foster parents adopt many
kids in order to get a steady
income, but provide little care for
the children, she said. When the

kids reach age 18, the money stops
coming in and the kids are some
times forced out, even when they
have nowhere to go.
The First Place Fund has man
aged to put about 150 of these
teenagers into apartments, mainly
with funds from private donors, gath
ered at events similar to Saturday's
fundraiser, Hill said. She added that
the teens, having been kicked around
by the system for so many years, are
often a little skeptical at first that
they will actually be helped, but that
through it all they are still optimistic
and looking for someone to trust.
"It's an awful way to grow up, but
the children themselves retain hope
for the future," she said. "They're
great kids."
