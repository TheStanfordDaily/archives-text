# Grad students engineer ankle device for elderly
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To most people, walking seems like
the most natural and simple act possi
ble. And yet. fora group of six
Stanford graduate students in mechan
ical engineering, the basic act of
putting one foot in front of the other
became a mystery that consumed their
energy for months. The fruit of their
labors — a vibrating ankle brace that
may help protect elderly people from
life-threatening falls.
"Walking and the idea of stability
are very complicated." said Tejas
Mazmudar, one of the students. He
and his fellow group members — Tim
Ramsey, Ryan McDonell, Buzzv
Bonneau, Jeremy Dittmer and Surag
Mantri — tackled this issue during
their project fora medical device class
that spanned two quarters.
While most groups in the class were
assigned a project by a medical device
company, this team's task came from
the Stanford Biodesign Innovation
Program, Dittmer said. As a result, the
group had to spend more time
researching than their classmates.
Operating on a $5,000 budget, the
students tried various techniques to
explore the concept of walking, stabili
ty and falling. They surprised test sub
jects. suppressed visual information by
blindfolding subjects and made sub
jects stand at difficult angles in order to
recreate motion during a fall.
"We're all engineers, so the biggest
problem was narrowing down one rea
son why people fall.'' Mazmudar said.
After conducting research and
meeting with doctors and specialists,
the group decided to focus on the
human sense of proprioception, or the
awareness of one's spatial orientation
in relation to one's surroundings.
"If I am closing my eyes and lifting
my finger right now, I still know it is
raised," Mazmudar explained. "But
as you grow older, your sensitivity to
your surroundings decreases and you
are not as aware of your joint posi
tion. In our research, we found that
most of the falls occur during the
night when seniors wake up to go to
the bathroom."

The prevalence of these falls, com
pounded by decreasing bone density
with age, leads to more complicated
injury' and premature death, studies
have shown.
"In our research, we found that
most of the falls occur during the night
when seniors wake up to go to the
bathroom," Mazmudar said.
"So one problem was that no one is
going to wear a shoe at night," Ramsey
added.
Instead of a shoe, the students
decided to make a brace that would
enhance proprioception through
vibration. TTiev designed sensors that
compare measurements of normal and
abnormal ankle movement and cause
the brace to vibrate if the ankle rolls
out of position.
The vibration warns the user that
his or her ankle is in a potentially
dangerous position and should be
adjusted. Additionally, vibratory
stimulation of certain parts of the
ankle was found to increase proprio
ception. leading to greater awareness
of one's joint position and improved
joint recovery.
Understanding balance and the
minute details of the ankle was one of
the goals of the students' project. But
the course also enhanced the stu
dents' experience in the medical
device industry, which many are
looking to pursue as a career, group
members said.
"The professors tried to treat our
projects the way a company would,"
Tejas added. "We looked at intellectu
al property laws and patenting and
researched specific medical proce
dures application. We had to take eco
nomic and market considerations into
account throughout the process."
Looking ahead, the students say
the next step for the brace they creat
ed would be clinical trials. It has not
been tested on anyone other than the
students in the group themselves,
they said. And even this process was
imperfect.
"It was like trying to apply censors
that are normally used for industrial
purposes on a machine and trying to
use it on a human." Dittmer said.
"People don't behave the way
machines do."
