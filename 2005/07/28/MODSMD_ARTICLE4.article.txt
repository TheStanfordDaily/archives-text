## Supreme Court rules on file-sharing 
### AYSHA PAMUKCU 
Throngs of college students were dismayed by the
Supreme Court's ruling on MGM vs. Grokster,
according to a recent survey by the Business Software
Alliance, or BSA, which claims that most college stu
dents do not find illegal file-sharing unethical.
In MGM vs. Grokster, the Supreme Court deter
mined that companies providing file-sharing software
are liable for the actions of users sharing copyrighted
files. The case took place in late June and will be
handed back to lower courts to determine whether
Grokster Ltd. and Stream Cast Networks Inc. — the
companies prosecuted in the case — knowingly sup
ported copyright violations.
The decision comes on the heels of increased
efforts by Recording Industry and Motion Picture
Associations of America, or RIAA and MPAA, to
rein in users sharing copyrighted material, including
lawsuits against students and universities using peer
to-peer file-sharing networks.
Coupled with numerous lawsuits against students
at colleges across the nation, this decision strengthens
the ability of copyright holders such as the RIAA to
prevent illegal file-sharing.
"The lawsuits have helped arrest the tremendous

growth of illicit peer-to-peer use," said RIAA
spokesperson Jenni Engebretsen.
Curbing file-sharing, however, may prove difficult,
if not impossible. The BSA found that two-thirds of
college and university students surveyed see nothing
unethical about sharing unpaid-lot" digital copyright
ed content such as software, music and movies, and
more than half believe it is acceptable behavior even
in the workplace.
The survey also shows that 45 percent of students
use campus networks for downloading activities, and
36 percent of the networks are likely to report
increased downloading.
"Musicians and movie producers make tons of
money that could go elsewhere," said Stanford senior
Nicole Gomez. "So to me, file sharing is a way to
spread the goods while we hold on to money that can
then go to better uses than musicians' cars."
As more colleges are subpoenaed to identify stu
dent users unlawfully sharing copyrighted material,
there is increased risk of legal repercussions for such
students. Currently, copyright violations can result in
civil penalties of up to $150,000 per violation.
