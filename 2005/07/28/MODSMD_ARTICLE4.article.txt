## Supreme Court rules on file-sharing 
### AYSHA PAMUKCU 
Throngs of college students were dismayed by the
Supreme Court's ruling on MGM vs. Grokster,
according to a recent survey by the Business Software
Alliance, or BSA, which claims that most college stu
dents do not find illegal file-sharing unethical.
In MGM vs. Grokster, the Supreme Court deter
mined that companies providing file-sharing software
are liable for the actions of users sharing copyrighted
files. The case took place in late June and will be
handed back to lower courts to determine whether
Grokster Ltd. and Stream Cast Networks Inc. — the
companies prosecuted in the case — knowingly sup
ported copyright violations.
The decision comes on the heels of increased
efforts by Recording Industry and Motion Picture
Associations of America, or RIAA and MPAA, to
rein in users sharing copyrighted material, including
lawsuits against students and universities using peer
to-peer file-sharing networks.
Coupled with numerous lawsuits against students
at colleges across the nation, this decision strengthens
the ability of copyright holders such as the RIAA to
prevent illegal file-sharing.
"The lawsuits have helped arrest the tremendous

growth of illicit peer-to-peer use," said RIAA
spokesperson Jenni Engebretsen.
Curbing file-sharing, however, may prove difficult,
if not impossible. The BSA found that two-thirds of
college and university students surveyed see nothing
unethical about sharing unpaid-lot" digital copyright
ed content such as software, music and movies, and
more than half believe it is acceptable behavior even
in the workplace.
The survey also shows that 45 percent of students
use campus networks for downloading activities, and
36 percent of the networks are likely to report
increased downloading.
"Musicians and movie producers make tons of
money that could go elsewhere," said Stanford senior
Nicole Gomez. "So to me, file sharing is a way to
spread the goods while we hold on to money that can
then go to better uses than musicians' cars."
As more colleges are subpoenaed to identify stu
dent users unlawfully sharing copyrighted material,
there is increased risk of legal repercussions for such
students. Currently, copyright violations can result in
civil penalties of up to $150,000 per violation.
Intranet file-sharing networks, which are popular
on campus and only allow users on
a single network to file-share, are as
illegal but theoretically less risky
than open internet file-sharing,
according to Mark Lemley, profes
sor of law at Stanford anil counsel
to Grokster.
He explained that users who file
share on such networks are less like
ly to be caught because a member of
the Stanford community would have
to report the student and, among the
many potential people to be sued,
users who make copyrighted content
available worldwide are most likely
to be targeted.
But the RIAA says it is adamant
about going after music piracy at all
levels.
"Because intranets such as local
area networks, or LANs, are not
connected to the public internet,
many students who use them mis
takenly believe that they remain
undetectable to the outside world."
Engebretsen said. "We have
brought suits against LAN opera
tors in the past at various universi
ties. Those enforcement efforts
were a powerful deterrent, and we
know of several LAN piracy net
works that came down following
our lawsuits."

Stanford has adopted a clear
stance against illegal applications of
file-sharing technology. In an open
letter to the Stanford community,
University Provost John
Etchemendy wrote, "The law
requires the University to respond
to such complaints [of users sharing
copyrighted material] by eliminat
ing access to the infringing materi
als and may further require
Stanford to identify students, facul
ty, staff or others who have violated
copyright laws. The University will
eliminate access and will provide
information as required by law."
Two legal actions have so far
been taken against Stanford stu
dents. The first was the result of 11
songs shared in 2003 and the second
for eight songs shared in 2004. In
both cases, the students settled
anonymously for four figure sums.
However, knowingly inf ringing on
statutory copyright theoretically can
reach a maximum of seven figures,
according to Lauren Shoenthaler,
senior university counsel for the
Stanford Legal Office.
Schoenthaler also advocates
legal alternatives to decrease illegal
file-sharing.
"We're not where we were 10
years ago when there was nothing
like iTunes and people couldn't buy
music on the web, so now a lot of
the old excuses are gone as the mar
ket improves," she said.
The ResComp Web site also

points to the availability of legal
file-sharing services.
"Because file-sharing can be
used legally and beneficially in an
academic setting, Stanford has no
plans to shut down sharing proto
cols, a drastic step taken by some
universities as a means of avoiding
illegal file-sharing," the site states.
• Students, who make up a signifi
cant portion of the file-sharing
demographic, express mixed feel
ings about the issue.
"A lot of the people who don't
really care about illegal file-shar
ing' are independent artists who
really stand to suffer the most from
illegal downloading." said senior
Meggy Wang. "1 really love the
analogy of the movie industry
freaking out over the invention of
VHS tapes and VCR recording as
compared to file-sharing. 1 think
the people who do stuff like
Napster and iTunes are being
smart — instead of punishing peo
ple, they just make it easier to do
things legally."
Lemley said that file-sharing is a
problem the industry is not going to
be able to solve using lawsuits as
their only weapon.
"They're going to have to give
consumers legal options," he said.
"I suspect there will continue to be
lawsuits but I hope the entertain
ment industry will realize that legal
action only represents one option
and not the whole solution."
