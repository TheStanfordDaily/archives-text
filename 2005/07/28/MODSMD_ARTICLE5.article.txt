# AFL-CIO loses more than 3 million members
## Groups split from union, prompt changes 
### KATIE BEARMAN NEWS EDITOR 
While the national labor move
ment may be facing large-scale
changes after two groups split
from a major labor union on
Monday, most everything "will be
business as usual" for workers rep
resented by the San Mateo and
Santa Clara County branch of the
Service Employees International
Union, said Gayle Tiller, commu
nications director of the branch, or
SEIU Local 715. This includes
approximately 2,500 Stanford
employees who work in the hospi
tal or in other facilities on campus,
Tiller said.
The American Federation of

Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations, or AFL-CIO, lost
more than three million members
and $18 million in annual dues on
Monday when SEIU and the
International Brotherhood of
Teamsters split from the group,
according to Reuters. The AFL
CIO is an organization of more
than 50 national and international
labor unions, and had about 13 mil
lion members before Monday,
according to its Web site.
SEIU's local unions, which
together include about 1.8 million
working people and 120,000
retirees, and the Teamsters, made
up of 1.4 million workers, decided
to abandon the AFL-CIO because
it "devotes too much of its
resources to political lobbying and
the central office," according to an
article published by Reuters on
July 26.
These unions want to put money
towards organizing more workers,
making changes in society and in
the economy, and giving smaller
unions power to join together,
according to the Associated Press.
Neither SEIU nor the
Teamsters attended the AFL-CIO
national convention, held July 23
in Chicago, 111., AP reported.
United Food and Commercial

Workers and UNITE HERE,
made up of hotel, textile and
restaurant workers, boycotted the
convention as well, but did not
split from the federation.
Reuters reports that analysts
are scrambling to predict the
effects that these events will have
on the national labor movement,
but Tiller said that while SEIU
Local 715 joined its parent organi
zation in the national split, "local
ly, we'll still be involved with the
state AFL-CIO and the South Bay
Labor council. It's not about divi
sion, it's about building a move
ment. We still want to be involved
with AFL-CIO. even if we're not
partners."
She continued. "We will contin
ue to focus on organizing and
bringing new workers to the move
ment so that thye can have health

benefits, pensions when they retire
and other basic rights for workers."
Labor unions in the United
States have been on the decline
since non-union corporations such
as Wal-Mart have proliferated and
because of outsourcing labor,
Reuters said. When AFL-CIO was
founded in 1955, one third of pri
vate-sector workers belonged to
labor groups, but today, fewer than
one in eight of these workers are
members of such organizations,
according to AP.
Some experts argue that the
SEIU and the Teamsters' split
from the federation will send the
labor movement into deeper dis
tress, Reuters said. But other ana
lysts say that the split could create
competition among labor unions
and give the labor movement a
boost.
