# Cantor to receive prof's art collection
## 
### ADAM WIDMAN NEWS EDITOR 
Ophthalmology Prof. Michael
Marmor and his family recently
pledged to donate a set of 220
works of art, including prints,
sculptures and paintings, to the
Cantor Center for the Visual Arts.
The collection, which is donat
ed on behalf of the family's
Marmor Foundation, will be
given to the center over a period
of 20 years. The museum already
has some of the Marmor collec
tion on display and plans to
include more donated works in
exhibits opening in the next few
months.
"The Marmor Foundation gift
brings to the Cantor Arts Center
substantial works by important
contemporary artists not present
ly represented in depth in our
collection," said Museum
Director Thomas Seligman in a
July 12 press release. "Prints by
Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein
and Andy Warhol and sculptures
by Joseph Cornell and Ed
Kienholz, among others, will give
us the capacity to teach about
contemporary printmaking and
modern art, particularly on the
West Coast."
"We are delighted that the
Marmor Family wants to continue
to see these works at Stanford
where they can be used for teach
ing as well as the enjoyment of
our audiences," Seligman added.
The donation was made in
memory of Marmor's parents,
Judd and Katherine Marmor, who

were primarily responsible for
collecting the artwork.
Anna Roster, the museum's
public relations manager, told the
Weekly that the Center does not
discuss the monetary value of its
collections, saying instead that
the"artistic, aesthetic and art his
torical value of [the donated]
works is immense."
According to Prof. Marmor,
the donation was given to the
Cantor Arts Center because of his
own ties to the University and the
museum's ability to put the art on
display for educational purposes.
"1 have obvious links to
Stanford, as long-time faculty, but
my parents lived in the L.A. art
world," he said. "However, for
the type of art that we had, larger
L.A. museums would simply hold
most of it in storage. The Cantor
Arts Center is a part of a universi
ty, and the art will not only be on
view, but available for study. Art
should be enjoyed and used, and
the Cantor provided a unique
location that is academic as well
as a site for display."
Marmor added that the size
and scope of the collection that
will be donated was more suited
to the smaller Cantor Arts Center
than to a larger arts venue.
"The works all represent art
that Judd and Katherine thought
enjoyable to live with, as well as
innovative and important in the
evolving art world," he said. "So
the pieces are nt mammoth
museum size, but works that
could — and many did — live in
the home."
