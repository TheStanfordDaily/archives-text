## Sketch Un-f cking-believable 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
God hates me, which is pretty unreason
able of him or her, since (a) other than the
odd coveting of my neighbor's ass, I'm real
ly not much of a sinner (despite my best ef
forts) and (b) I don't even believe in him /
her /it / whatever. And frankly, when an
omnipotent being whose existence you
doubt is conspiring against you. it's hard not
to feel a little put upon.
I mention this, not to complain (well, not

only to complain — I sup
pose I do want to bitch a lit
tle), but rather because it's
the only explanation for the
varied misadventures that
constitute my life at this mo
ment. The most bothersome
of these revolves around the
fact that I'm finally leaving
Stanford.
Now, before you all rush

off to beg me to stay (I
know you guys love me, no need to hide it), I
should make it clear that it's only Stanford
the town that I'm leaving behind, I'll still be
firmly anchored to Stanford the University
(oh, joy).
The details of this departure I shall save
for another time — I think the chaos of
Craigslist deserves its own column — for
now, I'll stick to dishing on my reason for
leaving.
Palo Alto is really boring. Not just, like, a
little dull, but out-of-your-mind-skull-searing
ly miserable. So like any rational person, I'm
escaping to greener pastures — well actually
to cold hard concrete and grimy red brick, but
you know what I mean.
I suppose that deep inside I knew that
somehow the misery that is graduate school
would conspire to ensure that my life still
sucked despite my best efforts to find some
fun; but hey, sometimes you just gotta try.
The aforementioned conspiring began to
take hold with the opening of the 750. For
those who don't know, the 750 is the stagger
ingly-brilliant name of the pub inhabiting the
ground floor of the Graduate Community
Center (located at, yes you guessed it, 750 Es
condido Road).
As regular readers know. I'm somewhat of
an optimist, so I had high expectations.

In my mind's eye 1 could envision a
"Cheers"-like environment, complete with a
regular crew of slackers propping up the bar,
an aging Lothario running the place and a cou
ple of hot girls working the taps.
Which is why it came as an enormous sur
prise to find that the real thing actually
matched the fantasy — right down to the
Lothario.
Somehow, in this horribly adverse envi
ronment, in this soul-sucking pit of tedium,
there now exists somewhere fun to hang out
on campus. I'm speechless. And very an
noyed.
Two years living within spitting distance
of the site, and they only fill it when I'm
about to leave. Worse, they fill it with some
thing good.
How am I supposed to gloat effectively
about life in the city if the joylessness around
here no longer persists? It's really not fair.
It's not just the fact that alcohol is now
within walking distance (though this has
been a gripe of mine since I first got lost
walking home from the Nuthouse on my sec
ond night at Stanford) there's also the late
night thing.
With the exception of its so-called bars,
Palo Alto shuts down at around 10 p.m. If
you want food, tough (unless you think Taco
Bell qualifies). So, 1 was poised to smugly
boast about late night snacking in the Mis
sion, secure in the knowledge that the
denizens of Stanford would be suitably en
vious.
Now, of course, this isn't going to work.
Want food? They're cooking until 2 a.m. at the
750, and there goes another chance for me to
grasp that sense of superiority.
Alas, it appears that the elusiveness of my
disdain may well be unconquerable; looking
down on people will most likely remain a pipe
dream. Damn shame, because I really wanted
to be on the other side of condescension fora
change.
Anyway, since I can't brag, I suppose I'll
have to stick with offering a couple of words of
reassurance. You may be bored and restless
here at the Farm, but just think, it could be
worse: You could be leaving.

Why are you wasting your time reading this? Go
and have a pint at the 750 instead. And if that
doesn't cheer you up, e-mail navins@stanford.edu
and I'll tell you a joke.
