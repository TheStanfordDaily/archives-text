## It's not a race 
### ADREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
There's a difference between being untal
ented at something and being chronologically
behind. If you're worse than your peers at
something, you might not have less of a capa
bility for it — you might have had a late start.

No matter what your subject
or specialty, there are proba
bly people your age at Stan
ford who have been doing it
longer or more intensely
than you.
We have world-class mu
sicians and Olympic ath
letes, not to mention some
of the country's best techni
cal students. While these

others can be an inspiration, they also can
cause discouragement — 1 assert, often un
necessarily.
Say you had only minimal training in Span
ish, piano or swimming. It wouldn't make
sense to decide you were bad at those things
just because you had less practice than others
your age.
Yet many people (including myself) some
times use this reasoning with math, computer

science and other technical subjects. For some
reason, success in these areas is often attrib
uted to innate ability rather than good old
fashioned practice.
And while most people who are precocious
in these fields probably have natural potential,
the inverse isn't necessarily true. One of my
professors played college basketball and only
later turned his focus to his field. Another pro
fessor was a professional magician. 1 hope peo
ple won't give up on certain subjects because
they haven't had the opportunities of other
students. I'd say this:
1) Precocity isn't the same as long-term po
tential. If you aren't advanced for your age,
don't worry.
2) If you happen to be advanced at some
thing, don't feel obligated to pursue it instead
of things you like more.
3) If you're behind your peers at something,
don't rule it out as something to study — just
catch up.
4) Ask yourself what you'd study if you were
smart enough to do anything, and then study
that subject.
5) Seek challenge instead of avoiding it.
