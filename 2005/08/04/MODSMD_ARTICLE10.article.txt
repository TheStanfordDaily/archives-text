## Clijsters upends Williams Fourth-seeded Belgian nabs fourth tourney win of 2005 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters fired a crosscourt
forehand winner to break Venus Williams' serve at
15-40 and clinch the Bank of the West Classic final
on Sunday.
Clijsters' whirlwind victory at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, her third at the Tier 11 tournament and
fourth for the year, places the Belgian in prime posi
tion to dominate this month's US Open.
While other WTA competitors are bowing left and
right to injury and exhaustion, including world No. 1
Lindsay Davenport, Clijsters emerges from the fray in
better health than ever. Clijsters' own injuries, includ
ing a year-ending wrist ailment in 2004, seem no more
than a distant memory, banished by the brilliant return
of her top-notch game.
And on Sunday, what a game she had.
The quick court coverage. The deftly angled
groundstrokes. The never-say-die determination
which sent her lunging for would-be winners, facing
the sun without a single flinch as she sent strategic lobs
sailing back over the net.
Clijsters defeated a flagging Williams in straight
sets, 7-5, 6-2, her third win over Williams in their last
nine meetings.
"1 just had some lapses," Williams said. "I kept say
ing to myself, 'Challenge yourself, V, move your feet
and hit the ball." But I just came up short."
Unforced errors said more, with Williams commit
ting 43 and Clijsters 18.
In addition, Clijsters built up unstoppable momen

turn, claiming 100 percent of points off her first serve
in the second set. Williams, usually noted for her dev
astating service game, closed just over half of her first
serves.
"Sometimes you have those moments where
you're reading the serve really well," Clijsters said.
"Even on [Venus'] second serve. 1 was aggressive, I
was turning well."
Clijsters went on to explain that raising her game
meant more than topping such a tough opponent.
"The tennis that I've played here means so much
more than any of the other victories I've had so far,"
she said. "In Paris, 1 was just looking for motivation, 1
didn't really enjoy being out on the court because of
the injuries, that was frustrating. 1 just wanted to start
working hard and thinking ahead for grass [courts]
and about this trip ... and it's paid off."
The luck of the draw
Clijsters arrived at Sunday's final fresh off a
straight-sets win over Anna-Lena Groenefeld. She
needed less than an hour to send the unseeded Ger
man packing, 6-4,6-0.
"I tried to be aggressive today and 1 made a lot of
errors," said Groenefeld after her semifinal match.
"She moved me around a lot. I should have just gone
for my shots."
Groenefeld, 20, made her first appearance at
Bank of the West this year, and reached the semifinal
after outlasting sixth-seeded Natalie Dechy on Fri
day, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3. She then went neck-in-neck for
most of the first set against Clijsters before her game
quickly unraveled.
Serving at 4-5, Groenefeld saved three break points to
even the score at deuce. On the next point, she went fora

forehand smash to gain the advantage.
Several seconds later, a line judge
declared the ball out of bounds and
ordered a replay.
Groenefeld calmly fired a 120-
mph ace in response, but with her
confidence shaken, her opponent
easily claimed the next nine games
for the match.
Williams, on the other hand,
pulled out all the stops in her semifi
nal contest against Patty Schnyder,
who was seeded third. Williams, 25,
appeared down for the count before
saving triple match point to force a
tiebreak in the second set.
In a two-hour battle, second-seed
ed Williams rose to the show-stopping
occasion, winning 2-6,7-6(4), 6-2.
Schnyder was serving, up 6-5, 40-
0, when she bungled a backhand to let
Williams back in the match.
In an unabashed display of net
game finesse, Venus needed merely
to stick out her racket to drop shot
and volley her way back to deuce. She
would go on to save two more match
points, including a fateful serve which

Schnyder believed to be an ace.
"It was close, but very much out,"
Williams said.
The rest of the match unfolded as
only it could, with a recent Wimble
don champion once again proving
her mettle. Schnyder, a left-hander
whose serves and tightly wound
ground-strokes usually bewilder op
ponents by spinning in the opposite
direction, was left in the dust.
"If you're Venus Williams coming
back from five match points and a
Wimbledon title, there's just no way
you're going to lose," Schnydcr said.
She added, "I had a couple of
break points to come back in the
third set. I was there too to make the
points, but she was just too good in
the third. She wouldn't miss."
Rest for the weary
Throughout the tournament's du
ration, Williams shed light on her ex
hausted state, which got the best of
her in the final. A week after garner
ing Wimbledon honors in early July,
she competed in the Fed Cup and
began her first of three stints playing
World Team Tennis.
The No. 8 player has also been
busy promoting her new reality TV
series with her sister Serena, Venus &

Serena: For Real.
"Mentally and physically, it's hard
to stay there," Williams said. "I love
competing, but you also have to have
some time awav"

Other players have had greater
misfortune, forced to take the sidelines
instead of choosing to do so. The 2004
Bank of the West champion. No. 1
Davenport, aggravated her on-going
back injury in her opening round
match against Groenefeld.
An ailing Davenport retired from
the match, trailing 5-0.
"I don't know what to expect and
that's really, really frustrating," Dav
enport said. "I think if someone would
tell me, 'If you did this for three weeks
and didn't play a tournament,' I'd be
very happy at this point. I get clearance
to play and then it flares up."
On the road to recovery, Davenport
pulled out of this week's Acura Classic
in San Diego. Her absence is matched
by the likes of Serena Williams and
young phenom Maria Sharapova, who
also withdrew from the tournament.
Bank of the West Champion Cli
jsters, meanwhile, is thankful for her
own robust health.
"I'm sure a lot of the girls [on tour]
have a few aches and pains and they
don't want to take a risk for the US
Open," she said. "I'm just happy that
I'm here and that I'm healthy."
With the Stanford win, Clijsters
moved up four spots to No. 10 in the
rankings, her first time in the top 10
since last October.

you're reading the serve really well," Clijsters said.
"Even on [Venus'] second serve. 1 was aggressive, I
was turning well."
Clijsters went on to explain that raising her game
meant more than topping such a tough opponent.
"The tennis that I've played here means so much
more than any of the other victories I've had so far,"
she said. "In Paris, 1 was just looking for motivation, 1
didn't really enjoy being out on the court because of
the injuries, that was frustrating. 1 just wanted to start
working hard and thinking ahead for grass [courts]
and about this trip ... and it's paid off."
The luck of the draw
Clijsters arrived at Sunday's final fresh off a
straight-sets win over Anna-Lena Groenefeld. She
needed less than an hour to send the unseeded Ger
man packing, 6-4,6-0.
"I tried to be aggressive today and 1 made a lot of
errors," said Groenefeld after her semifinal match.
"She moved me around a lot. I should have just gone
for my shots."
Groenefeld, 20, made her first appearance at
Bank of the West this year, and reached the semifinal
after outlasting sixth-seeded Natalie Dechy on Fri
day, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3. She then went neck-in-neck for
most of the first set against Clijsters before her game
quickly unraveled.
Serving at 4-5, Groenefeld saved three break points to
even the score at deuce. On the next point, she went fora

forehand smash to gain the advantage.
Several seconds later, a line judge
declared the ball out of bounds and
ordered a replay.
Groenefeld calmly fired a 120-
mph ace in response, but with her
confidence shaken, her opponent
easily claimed the next nine games
for the match.
Williams, on the other hand,
pulled out all the stops in her semifi
nal contest against Patty Schnyder,
who was seeded third. Williams, 25,
appeared down for the count before
saving triple match point to force a
tiebreak in the second set.
In a two-hour battle, second-seed
ed Williams rose to the show-stopping
occasion, winning 2-6,7-6(4), 6-2.
Schnyder was serving, up 6-5, 40-
0, when she bungled a backhand to let
Williams back in the match.
In an unabashed display of net
game finesse, Venus needed merely
to stick out her racket to drop shot
and volley her way back to deuce. She
would go on to save two more match
points, including a fateful serve which

Schnyder believed to be an ace.
"It was close, but very much out,"
Williams said.
The rest of the match unfolded as
only it could, with a recent Wimble
don champion once again proving
her mettle. Schnyder, a left-hander
whose serves and tightly wound
ground-strokes usually bewilder op
ponents by spinning in the opposite
direction, was left in the dust.
"If you're Venus Williams coming
back from five match points and a
Wimbledon title, there's just no way
you're going to lose," Schnydcr said.
She added, "I had a couple of
break points to come back in the
third set. I was there too to make the
points, but she was just too good in
the third. She wouldn't miss."
Rest for the weary
Throughout the tournament's du
ration, Williams shed light on her ex
hausted state, which got the best of
her in the final. A week after garner
ing Wimbledon honors in early July,
she competed in the Fed Cup and
began her first of three stints playing
World Team Tennis.
The No. 8 player has also been
busy promoting her new reality TV
series with her sister Serena, Venus &

Serena: For Real.
"Mentally and physically, it's hard
to stay there," Williams said. "I love
competing, but you also have to have
some time awav"

Other players have had greater
misfortune, forced to take the sidelines
instead of choosing to do so. The 2004
Bank of the West champion. No. 1
Davenport, aggravated her on-going
back injury in her opening round
match against Groenefeld.
An ailing Davenport retired from
the match, trailing 5-0.
"I don't know what to expect and
that's really, really frustrating," Dav
enport said. "I think if someone would
tell me, 'If you did this for three weeks
and didn't play a tournament,' I'd be
very happy at this point. I get clearance
to play and then it flares up."
On the road to recovery, Davenport
pulled out of this week's Acura Classic
in San Diego. Her absence is matched
by the likes of Serena Williams and
young phenom Maria Sharapova, who
also withdrew from the tournament.
Bank of the West Champion Cli
jsters, meanwhile, is thankful for her
own robust health.
"I'm sure a lot of the girls [on tour]
have a few aches and pains and they
don't want to take a risk for the US
Open," she said. "I'm just happy that
I'm here and that I'm healthy."
With the Stanford win, Clijsters
moved up four spots to No. 10 in the
rankings, her first time in the top 10
since last October.

Bank of the West champ Kim Clijsters
moved into the top 10 in the world
rankings.
Fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters fired a crosscourt
forehand winner to break Venus Williams' serve at
15-40 and clinch the Bank of the West Classic final
on Sunday.
Clijsters' whirlwind victory at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, her third at the Tier 11 tournament and
fourth for the year, places the Belgian in prime posi
tion to dominate this month's US Open.
While other WTA competitors are bowing left and
right to injury and exhaustion, including world No. 1
Lindsay Davenport, Clijsters emerges from the fray in
better health than ever. Clijsters' own injuries, includ
ing a year-ending wrist ailment in 2004, seem no more
than a distant memory, banished by the brilliant return
of her top-notch game.
And on Sunday, what a game she had.
The quick court coverage. The deftly angled
groundstrokes. The never-say-die determination
which sent her lunging for would-be winners, facing
the sun without a single flinch as she sent strategic lobs
sailing back over the net.
Clijsters defeated a flagging Williams in straight
sets, 7-5, 6-2, her third win over Williams in their last
nine meetings.
"1 just had some lapses," Williams said. "I kept say
ing to myself, 'Challenge yourself, V, move your feet
and hit the ball." But I just came up short."
Unforced errors said more, with Williams commit
ting 43 and Clijsters 18.
In addition, Clijsters built up unstoppable momen

turn, claiming 100 percent of points off her first serve
in the second set. Williams, usually noted for her dev
astating service game, closed just over half of her first
serves.
"Sometimes you have those moments where
you're reading the serve really well," Clijsters said.
"Even on [Venus'] second serve. 1 was aggressive, I
was turning well."
Clijsters went on to explain that raising her game
