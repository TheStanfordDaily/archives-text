## Clijsters upends Williams Fourth-seeded Belgian nabs fourth tourney win of 2005 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fourth-seeded Kim Clijsters fired a crosscourt
forehand winner to break Venus Williams' serve at
15-40 and clinch the Bank of the West Classic final
on Sunday.
Clijsters' whirlwind victory at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, her third at the Tier 11 tournament and
fourth for the year, places the Belgian in prime posi
tion to dominate this month's US Open.
While other WTA competitors are bowing left and
right to injury and exhaustion, including world No. 1
Lindsay Davenport, Clijsters emerges from the fray in
better health than ever. Clijsters' own injuries, includ
ing a year-ending wrist ailment in 2004, seem no more
than a distant memory, banished by the brilliant return
of her top-notch game.
And on Sunday, what a game she had.
The quick court coverage. The deftly angled
groundstrokes. The never-say-die determination
which sent her lunging for would-be winners, facing
the sun without a single flinch as she sent strategic lobs
sailing back over the net.
Clijsters defeated a flagging Williams in straight
sets, 7-5, 6-2, her third win over Williams in their last
nine meetings.
"1 just had some lapses," Williams said. "I kept say
ing to myself, 'Challenge yourself, V, move your feet
and hit the ball." But I just came up short."
Unforced errors said more, with Williams commit
ting 43 and Clijsters 18.
In addition, Clijsters built up unstoppable momen

turn, claiming 100 percent of points off her first serve
in the second set. Williams, usually noted for her dev
astating service game, closed just over half of her first
serves.
"Sometimes you have those moments where
you're reading the serve really well," Clijsters said.
"Even on [Venus'] second serve. 1 was aggressive, I
was turning well."
Clijsters went on to explain that raising her game
meant more than topping such a tough opponent.
"The tennis that I've played here means so much
more than any of the other victories I've had so far,"
she said. "In Paris, 1 was just looking for motivation, 1
didn't really enjoy being out on the court because of
the injuries, that was frustrating. 1 just wanted to start
working hard and thinking ahead for grass [courts]
and about this trip ... and it's paid off."
The luck of the draw
Clijsters arrived at Sunday's final fresh off a
straight-sets win over Anna-Lena Groenefeld. She
needed less than an hour to send the unseeded Ger
man packing, 6-4,6-0.
"I tried to be aggressive today and 1 made a lot of
errors," said Groenefeld after her semifinal match.
"She moved me around a lot. I should have just gone
for my shots."
Groenefeld, 20, made her first appearance at
Bank of the West this year, and reached the semifinal
after outlasting sixth-seeded Natalie Dechy on Fri
day, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3. She then went neck-in-neck for
most of the first set against Clijsters before her game
quickly unraveled.
Serving at 4-5, Groenefeld saved three break points to
even the score at deuce. On the next point, she went fora
