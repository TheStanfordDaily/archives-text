# Quentin close to call-up
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
With the July 31 trade deadline
looming and the Arizona Diamond
backs" flimsy offense begging for an in
fusion. few minor leaguers were pelted
with anticipation like former Cardinal
outfielder Carlos Quentin.
In the two years since his departure
from the Farm — he was selected by
Arizona in the 2003 draft — Quentin
has established himself as one of the or
ganization's top two prospects, along
with California alum Conor Jackson.
The one-time college baseball rivals
became an unparalleled duo, pushing
their way through the farm ranks.
And as the Diamondbacks drew
closer to playoff contention — the
team is currently one game behind
San Diego in the embarrassment that
is the National League West standings
— rumors began to circulate. Jose
Cruz, Jr., Arizona's centerfielder, fal
tered at the plate for months, batting
in the low .200's, and Quentin and
Jackson became the prime candidates
for his replacement.
Which Pacific-10 Conference prod
uct would get the green light? The
Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders team
mates spent most of the 2005 season
hitting above .300; Jackson led the
squad in doubles (38), while Quentin
was the team's long-ball specialist (20).
Jackson owned an advanced brand of
plate discipline, while Quentin's can

non of an arm made him the defensive
choice. The pair talked about the possi
bility of getting calls to the majors, in
the midst of their discussions of the
game itself.
Last Wednesday, when the Ari
zona management purchased Jack
son's contract and designated Cruz for
assignment to open a roster spot,
Quentin had encouraging words for
his teammate.
"He really deserves it," Quentin
said of Jackson. "He's just been nail
ing the ball."
Jackson proved himself to be any
thing but a fluke in his first start for the
big club, going 2-for-4 — his first
major-league RBI happened to be a
game-winner.
But the Cal grad's call-up will not
flatten Quentin's chances of a big
league debut. A natural right fielder,
Quentin has spent a month in center
for the Sidewinders. And as the sub
.soo Diamondbacks l<x)k fora way to
win the MLB's ugliest division,
Quentin's big bat could entice the club
before season's end.
"A call-up would be amazing,"
Quentin said emphatically, losing a bit
of his typical seriousness at the thought
of his lifelong dream. "Management
will always do what's best for the big
club, and there's a possibility that they
might need some offense, so I'm going
to continue learning and see what hap-
