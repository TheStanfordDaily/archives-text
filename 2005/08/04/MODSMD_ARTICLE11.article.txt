# Quentin close to call-up
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
With the July 31 trade deadline
looming and the Arizona Diamond
backs" flimsy offense begging for an in
fusion. few minor leaguers were pelted
with anticipation like former Cardinal
outfielder Carlos Quentin.
In the two years since his departure
from the Farm — he was selected by
Arizona in the 2003 draft — Quentin
has established himself as one of the or
ganization's top two prospects, along
with California alum Conor Jackson.
The one-time college baseball rivals
became an unparalleled duo, pushing
their way through the farm ranks.
And as the Diamondbacks drew
closer to playoff contention — the
team is currently one game behind
San Diego in the embarrassment that
is the National League West standings
— rumors began to circulate. Jose
Cruz, Jr., Arizona's centerfielder, fal
tered at the plate for months, batting
in the low .200's, and Quentin and
Jackson became the prime candidates
for his replacement.
Which Pacific-10 Conference prod
uct would get the green light? The
Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders team
mates spent most of the 2005 season
hitting above .300; Jackson led the
squad in doubles (38), while Quentin
was the team's long-ball specialist (20).
Jackson owned an advanced brand of
plate discipline, while Quentin's can

non of an arm made him the defensive
choice. The pair talked about the possi
bility of getting calls to the majors, in
the midst of their discussions of the
game itself.
Last Wednesday, when the Ari
zona management purchased Jack
son's contract and designated Cruz for
assignment to open a roster spot,
Quentin had encouraging words for
his teammate.
"He really deserves it," Quentin
said of Jackson. "He's just been nail
ing the ball."
Jackson proved himself to be any
thing but a fluke in his first start for the
big club, going 2-for-4 — his first
major-league RBI happened to be a
game-winner.
But the Cal grad's call-up will not
flatten Quentin's chances of a big
league debut. A natural right fielder,
Quentin has spent a month in center
for the Sidewinders. And as the sub
.soo Diamondbacks l<x)k fora way to
win the MLB's ugliest division,
Quentin's big bat could entice the club
before season's end.
"A call-up would be amazing,"
Quentin said emphatically, losing a bit
of his typical seriousness at the thought
of his lifelong dream. "Management
will always do what's best for the big
club, and there's a possibility that they
might need some offense, so I'm going
to continue learning and see what hap-

pens."
Seeing what happens has so far
been a successful mode of operation
for the right-hander, who moved
through the minor leagues despite a ca
reer-stalling injury sustained at Stan
ford. While making a throw from right
in the Cardinal uniform, Quentin dam
aged the tendon in his elbow, an injury
that would require Tommy John
surgery, and could have postponed his
entry to the draft.
But Quentin had already set his

mind to leaving Stanford a year early,
and played injured even through the
Cardinal's College World Series dash.
He managed to hit .3% with 12 homers
in his final season, despite struggling
with his defensive tools. To avoid ag
gravating his throwing arm in that year,
Ouentin would flip the ball to then-cen
terfielder San Fuld, who would oblig
ingly relay the ball to the infield. But
the injury may have developed
Quentin's signature offensive style.
"It forced me to simplify my swing,"
he said. "1 had to get rid of any wasted
movement. My bat speed faltered, es
pecially near the end of the season, but
it made me a complete hitter. 1 had less
power, but I improved at hitting to the
opposite field."

The fast track was not what Ouentin
expected upon recovering from his
surgery, which left a long scar along the
curve of his inner elbow, the most fa
mous of baseball battle scars. But
Ouentin found himself pushed through
High-A and Double-A in the same
year, gathering up more bumps and
bruises along the way.
The Chula Vista, Calif, native hit
.332 between the two levels in 2004,
with 89 RBI and 21 four-baggers, and
also picked up the minor league record
for most hit-by-pitches in a single sea
son. The mark hardly came as a sur
prise to anyone who had seen
Ouentin's plate-invading stance, which
often enticed inside fastballs that
ended up somewhere in left field.

"It's a weird record to have," said
Quentin, who also owns the NCAA
single-game hit-by-pitch record
(five). "It helps out the team, but it's
really unintentional. It's a side-note of
my career that's kind of funny to sit
back and laugh at."
Despite his propensity for getting
hit, Quentin has shred away from the
boxes of protective batting gear he's
been offered, just as he did in college.
"It feels funny when I swing, so I
don't use it,"he said. "I'd rather get hit
than sacrifice my swing."
At the moment, that swing is earn
ing Quentin a .298 batting average, 74
RBI and 41 extra-base hits. And you
can be sure that the Arizona Diamond
backs are watching.
