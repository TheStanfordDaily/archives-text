### ANDREW ROGERS SPORTS COLUMNIST 
In an effort to please my editors (and not become a
one-sport horse), I will stay away from baseball in
today's column. "But Andrew," you may be saying,
"what else is there to talk about? It's the only sport
being played right now." I'll tell you. 1 refuse to do a pre
preseason analysis of either pro or college football.
Honestly, do we really need to know what Alex Smith's
passing completion was in both the morning and after
noon practices, or that the University of Arkansas is mo
tivated to win this year? Duh...
In fact, right here and now, I'm making a rule. If an
athlete can do something that I can do, I don't want to
hear it reported in the news. Thus, Barry reporting that he
isn't playing, or reading about Smith's favorite food is not
newsworthy. Fill my sports page with stuff that doesn't in
volve my morning routine, because I think to myself
every day,"I won't be playing major league baseball the
rest of this season."
So what is this all about? THE NATIONAL HOCK
EY LEAGUE. Remember us? We're that goofy Canadi
an sport, sort of like soccer (which coincidentally. Amer
icans also have extreme difficulty focusing on). After a
lockout that destroyed an entire season, the players and
owners have finally agreed on a new collective bargaining
agreement. Never mind that the players finally accepted
a deal that was worse than the one offered them in De
cember, which would have saved at least half a season.
The point is that, come Oct. 5. all 30 teams will open the
2005-2006 season. It's the first time in league history that
all teams will play on the same night, one of many mea
sures taken by the governing body to bring the sport back
