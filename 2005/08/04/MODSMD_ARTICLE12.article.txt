# Here's the NHL's shot at entertaining us (for once)

### ANDREW ROGERS SPORTS COLUMNIST 
In an effort to please my editors (and not become a
one-sport horse), I will stay away from baseball in
today's column. "But Andrew," you may be saying,
"what else is there to talk about? It's the only sport
being played right now." I'll tell you. 1 refuse to do a pre
preseason analysis of either pro or college football.
Honestly, do we really need to know what Alex Smith's
passing completion was in both the morning and after
noon practices, or that the University of Arkansas is mo
tivated to win this year? Duh...
In fact, right here and now, I'm making a rule. If an
athlete can do something that I can do, I don't want to
hear it reported in the news. Thus, Barry reporting that he
isn't playing, or reading about Smith's favorite food is not
newsworthy. Fill my sports page with stuff that doesn't in
volve my morning routine, because I think to myself
every day,"I won't be playing major league baseball the
rest of this season."
So what is this all about? THE NATIONAL HOCK
EY LEAGUE. Remember us? We're that goofy Canadi
an sport, sort of like soccer (which coincidentally. Amer
icans also have extreme difficulty focusing on). After a
lockout that destroyed an entire season, the players and
owners have finally agreed on a new collective bargaining
agreement. Never mind that the players finally accepted
a deal that was worse than the one offered them in De
cember, which would have saved at least half a season.
The point is that, come Oct. 5. all 30 teams will open the
2005-2006 season. It's the first time in league history that
all teams will play on the same night, one of many mea
sures taken by the governing body to bring the sport back
to mainstream America.
Well, bringing it back assumes
too much. Let's be frank. How many
of you reading this column knew that
the NHL had signed a new CBA?
No? OK, let's start bigger. How
many of you knew that the NHL
took a year off? Still no? Anyone out
there remember that the Tampa Bay
Lightning were the last team to win
the NHL championship? Anyone
ever heard of the Stanley Cup?
While the last questions may be a
bit insulting to the average sports
mind, it's not that far from the truth.
Asking a few hockey questions to a
friend of mine, who is of at least aver
age sports intelligence, shed some
light on hockey's position in the aver
age American mind. Rising sopho
more Kevin "I should know these
things, I'm from Buffalo" Choo knew
that "either Detroit or that Florida
team" won the last Stanley Cup, set
tling on Detroit because he "remem
bered it being a big deal because they
won basketball the same year."
Okay, so he wasn't that far off,
but "that Florida team"? And the
way he decided? Basketball, which
shares a season with hockey. The
NHL is that ugly stepsister who
shares a room with the hot, fast girl
that everyone loves. The NBA has
fast-paced, high scoring games that
pack arenas and fill TV slots. The
NHL is lowering ticket prices and
still looking fora TV deal for its up
coming season.
The good news is that steps are
being taken to make hockey more
than just boring, cold Canadian soc
cer. Doing their best to raise scoring
and make the game more exciting,
the NHL has increased the offensive
zone and decreased the size of goalie
pads, among other changes. Perhaps
the most radical change, however, is
the commitment to rid the game of
the American nemesis: the tie. Is
there anything more repulsive to an
American sports fan than the idea of
not determining a winner? Not ac
cording to the NHL, who has decid
ed to eliminate the ugly third column
from the sports page, deciding to go
to shootout if the teams can't decide
things in a timely fashion.
While this promises more offense
and exciting moments, purists
haven't exactly leapt on the band
wagon. As Mike Murray, a recent
graduate who enjoys watching the
hustle and action of semi-pro hock
ey. points out, "You play so hard and
the game is decided by an activity
that is different from the sport. What
about home run contests instead of
extra innings for baseball? It's excit
ing. but not the same."
While Murray may have a point.
I, for one, am looking forward to
having hockey back. 1 encourage
anyone reading this column (yeah.
I'm aware that my audience is less
than what the Montreal Expos used
to average at home games) to tune in
for the new season. The game has
everything America loves: fast-ac
tion, fights and hopefully now, of
fense. Hell, it's gotta be better than
reruns of the Surreal Life...

Andrew Rogers is a senior who
couldn 7 please his editor if he was a
25-sport elephant. Or something. E
