# Michael Bay; best consumed with a side of fries
## Senseless carnage not so much fun 
### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER FILM CRITIC 
The only thing more deceptive than a politi
cian is advertising, but everything you need to
know about "The Island" is front and center, at
the top of every poster, in the opening seconds
of every trailer: "From the director of 'The
Rock' and 'Armageddon."'

That's not even condescending critic
speak, I'm just saying that you know what
you're getting with a Michael Bay movie.
There are certainly intelligent arguments for
and against what he does. He's a symbol of all
that is wrong with Hollywood for most dis
criminating cineastes, but two of his films
have merited inclusion in the highbrow Cri
terion Collection, an organization best
known for their luminous restoration of mas
terpieces by the likes of Cocteau, Kurosawa
and Ozu. His movies have made over $2 bil
lion worldwide but his style has never really
progressed beyond his video for Meat Loaf's
"I Would Do Anything For Love (But I
Won't Do That)."
For me, Bay's films are like paying $2 fora par
ticularly greasy cheeseburger that weighs over a
pound: it's gross, but you definitely leave feeling
like you've gotten your money's worth. He's a
huckster to rival P.T. Barnum. Bay has no grand
statements to make and wishes only to entertain.
I'll bet he has a checklist of things he has to
put in every movie: "Twenty minute car chase?

Check. Gratuitous strip
club scene? Check. Three
dozen massive explo
sions? Check." He even
reaches out to indie audi
ences by getting their fa
vorite stars to whore out;
Steve Buscemi is a regular
in his films, and he
nabbed Billy Bob Thorn
ton right after "Sling
Blade" for "Armaged
don" and Scarlett Johans
son on the heels of "Lost
In Translation" for this
one. His budgets are usu
ally north of $150 million,
and every penny of it is
onscreen.
But in the wake of
"The Matrix," block
busters have become
heady. The norm now is
something like "Constan
tine," a crowd-pleasing
thriller with roots in theol
ogy and Alan Moore.

Even Bay's old moneyman Jerry Bruckheimer
— who defined the summer event movie in the
'80s — has moved on to prestige projects like
"Black Hawk Down" and family-friendly Dis
ney adventures like "Pirates Of The
Caribbean." The man who was once the undis
puted king of action spectacle suddenly seems
achingly retro.
"The Island" is Bay's attempt at this new
breed of big-budget extravaganza, with "at
tempt" being the operative word. The first half
is the kind of minimalist, high concept sci-fi
that has come back in style lately, confronting
difficult questions about cloning and medical
ethics. It's essentially a carbon copy of the
1979cheesefest "Parts: The Clonus Horror" to

the point where a lawsuit is pending (why
would a studio greenlight a de facto remake of
a movie that was immortalized on "Mystery
Science Theater 3000?"). Then Bay seems to
lose interest and confidence in making a film
that's not based on action sequences. After
staging a surprisingly disturbing scene featur
ing Michael Clatke Duncan in a glorified
cameo, it turns into a "Logan's Run" re-tread
with Ewan McGregor and Johansson running,
running and running some more.
I think Bay was trying to go fora "Total Re
call" vibe, an unapologetic action movie that's
still clever and confronts important questions.
