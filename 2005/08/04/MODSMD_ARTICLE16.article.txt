# Reading is sexy – grab some books
## 
### ZOE TROPE SUMMER BOOKWORM 
Zoe Trope thinks reading is sexy, and you
should too. Put down that boring treatise on glob
al wanning you were supposed to read fora pro
fessor this summer and pick up one of these
books instead (or avoid them as the case may be).
"When Zachary Beaver Came To Town" by
Kimberly Willis Holt — 13-year-old Toby Wil
son is leading a nice, boring life in Antler, Tex.
when Zachary Beaver, the World's Fattest Boy,
rolls into town in a shiny silver trailer. Things get
even more interesting when Toby's mom leaves
to become a superstar singer in Nashville and
Zachary's chaperone leaves for Paris to find
more sideshow acts. Toby helps Zachary come
out of his shell (literally and figuratively) and, in
return, Zachary helps Toby in this saccharine,
National-Book-Award-winning story. (4 stars)
"Goal Girls" by Francesca Lia Block —
Two short-short books by the magical Miss
Block. These stories are wonderful if you need a
touch of glitter, feather wings and roller skates
in your life. Otherwise it can be hard to pay at
tention as Block rambles on about girls with

snarled hair
sleeping in
teepees with
boys in goat
pants. (2 stars)
"Shopgirl"
by Steve Martin
— My primary
reason for read
ing this book is
that Jason
Schwartzman
(of "Rushmore"
and"I Heart
Huckabees"
fame) will be
playing the char-

acter of Jeremy in the upcoming movie adapta
tion. The cover of the book features a lovely
shot of an anonymous woman's ass. The con
tents, unfortunately, are not nearly as sexy. Mar
tin's voice in "Shopgirl" is extremely passive and
distant. It's like someone far away is speaking
very quietly into a tape recorder: "She sits down
on her futon. She pets her cat. She feels tired,
and she sleeps. She wakes up and drives to

work." The tone
of his writing is
slow and quiet,
which some peo
ple may enjoy.
But I found it to
be a hit irritating
at times. On the
upside, it's a
quick read and
it's a good teaser
if you're a Jason

Schwartzman fan. (3 stars)
"Jake, Reinvented" by Gordon Kormon —
A modern high school retelling of The Great
Gatsby. Stereotypical, obvious and a little in
sulting to the original Gatsby. I've heard Kor
mon's other books are better, but I'd leave this
one on the shelf. (0 stars)
"If Loving You Is Wrong" by Gregg Olsen
— I was around Vili Fualaau's age when his
girlfriend, Mary Kay Letourneau, went to jail
for raping him. Years later, this case continues
to interest people primarily because it seems so

outrageous. How could a pretty,
friendly sixth grade teacher fall in
love with one of her students? In this
story, the traditional roles of man as
predator and girl as victim of sexual
abuse are reversed. Olsen's writing
is decent, hut his research brings to
light many details that are not dis
cussed in the media. For instance, I
had no idea that Mary Kay's family
was so dysfunctional (her father was
a politican, her mother was uptight
and cold, her little brother drowned
when she was young, and on and on)
or that she dropped out of college to
start a family with her rebound
boyfriend, Steve Letourneau. I'd
recommend this if you secretly (or
not-so-secretly) enjoy reading
tabloids. (3 stars)
"Harry Potter and the Half-
Blood Prince" by J.K. Rowling —
Here's a tip: Harry Potter is more fun
to read if you're not completely
freakishly obsessed with it. So put
away the fanfic, take a deep breath
and read the damn book. It's okay to
cr y — just not because Harry kissed
that one girl. (5 stars)
"Freaky Cireen Eyes" by Joyce
Carol Oates — This dark coming-of
age story about a 15-year-old girl,
Franky, and her emotionally / physi
cally abusive father seems ripped
from today's headlines. The plot
may seem obvious from the begin
ning, but Oates's characters arc be
lievable and engaging without being
overly dramatic. A wonderful but
disturbing and possibly triggering

read. (3.5 stars)
"Story Time" by Edward Bloor
— 13-year-old Kate is horrified
when she learns that she's been ac
cepted to the Whittaker Magnet
School, but her Uncle George (age
11), is thrilled. The Test-Based Cur
riculum suits him perfectly (he's a
nerd), but Kate would rather go to
Lincoln Middle School and star in
the production of Peter Pan. To
make things worse, classes are held
in a windowless basement, protein
shakes are required nutrition and
the building is haunted by demons.
Together Kate and George solve the
mystery of the Whittaker Building
while Bloor takes a few jabs at the
state of education in America, so
there's a little something for every
one. (4 stars)
