# Street Scene 2005. Dig it.

### JOSHUA STERN SUMMER MUSIC GURU 
Headlined by some of the biggest names in
modern music, San Diego's 2005 Street Scene
music festival faced some serious expecta
tions. While San Diego is more than a short
drive from Stanford, with such titans as the
Pixies, the Flaming Lips, Snoop Dogg and the
White Stripes performing, the decision to
make the long trek south was hardly difficult.
So how was the experience as a whole? Just as
you'd expect two days of non-stop rocking to
be: epic.
The most memorable part of the trip actual
ly occurred before we even arrived in San
Diego. Desperately in need of gas and nourish
ment, our intrepid party was forced to stop in
the armpit of California that is Bakersfield. The
town's primary claim to fame is that it is the most
obese city in the United States, (just edged out
Houston in this year's rankings ... sorry Texas,
better luck next year). I'd be lying if I said Bak
ersfield didn't assert its dominance with painful
elegance. Within minutes of pulling into a gas
station, we were subject to a debate between a
local hick and a clerk concerning the true
essence of corndog, an argument so heated that
it would have left even the most hardened I-
Hum teaching fellow in defeated bewilderment.
For you see, this particular gas station has a two
hotdog for $2 deal, and this sneakster local was
trying to pass a corndog off as a hotdog. I'll leave
the degree of verbal carnage that ensued to your
imagination.
Street Scene started rather precariously, as I
-5 traffic caused practically every set on the first
day of the festival to begin significantly late, and
the opening bands of Autolux and Hard-fi failed
to even show up. Luckily, despite delays, most
groups performed their entire sets and the rest
of the festival ran incredibly smoothly.

The International Noise Conspiracy
I'd seen these Swedish rockers at Coachel
la 2(X)4. I was not impressed with them then,
and I was even less impressed with them this
time. Minimal talent abounds, so the band re
sorts to the rock show gimmicks painfully rem
iniscent of Spinal Tap. Worst show of the
weekend.
Louis XIV
Seeing these guys right after Noise Conspira
cy was a breath of fresh air. Louis XIV is a neo
glam rock band hailing from San Diego, al
though you wouldn't guess it from their sound.
They perform with a '70s-British-rocker flair
and the result is hilarious. Their songs are also
ridiculously catchy — so catchy, in fact, that we
were forced to stop at a record store to pick up
their album on the drive back. Definitely check
them out.
Flogging Molly
I've had a soft spot for Flogging Molly for
years. It has some of the most rabid fans in punk
rock, and they were out in force. The band gave
a rowdy, energetic performance. Combining
punk rock with Irish folk music, there is little not
to love about Flogging Molly — unless, of
course, you hate Irish folk music and punk rock.
Black Eyed Peas
About 10 minutes into their performance, Fer
gie pissed her pants onstage. Maybe they should
change their name to Black Eyed Pees? Ho!
The White Stripes
How two people can produce such a power
ful sound floored me. Jack White is truly one of
the most talented guitarists in modern rock. The
guitar-drums blues-rock duo played with amaz
ing intensity, blasting through their set with
practically no breaks. The crowd loved every
minute of it. If you ever get a chance to see these
two live, do it.
Death Cab for Curie and
Dashboard Confessional

Both bands have zero stage presence, so I'll
address them together. Don't waste your money
to see either hand live as their shows add little to
what you'll hear on their CDs.
Snoop Dogg
He's a great performer and knows how to
work an audience. Overall though, he put on a
relatively tame show and it was especially hard
for me to take him seriously after he told the
crowd to wave their arms in the air. A majority
of white arms proceeded to dance / flail / what
have-you in the air. I had to listen to "The
Chronic" on the drive home' to salvage my ap
preciation for Snoop.
The Pixies
The ironic thing about the Pixies is that they
are way more popular now than they ever were
when they were originally together. The group
gave a solid performance, although I found my
self wondering just how much of my enjoyment
was simply out of respect for the Pixies and the
enormous impact they had on '90s rock. Lead
man Frank Black (who looks startlingly like
Tenacious D's Kyle Gass) still knows how to
rock out with the best of them, but bassist and

singer Kim Deal's voice has been lamentably
punished by years of chain smoking. Perhaps
they should have changed the lyrics of ' Broken
Face" to "I've got a broken voice."
The Flaming Lips
Delivering the sheer sensory overload that
Flaming Lips live shows are known and loved
for, this was arguably the best performance of
the festival. Furry suits, dancing inflatable
suns, strobe lights, fog machines and a giant
karaoke screen made fora great spectacle.
Lead singer Wayne Coyne opened the act by
crowd surfing in a giant plastic bubble (also
circa Coachella '04). The undeniable highlight,
however, was a new instrumental called "Cow
jam" where Wayne rocked out on a children's
animal noise toy. The back and forth between
the droning moos and quacks of the machine
and the rest of the band was truly legendary.
So, there you have it. Southern California's
Street Scene '05 attracted quite the diverse set
of performers, and hopefully everyone left hav
ing broadened their musical horizons at least a
little. You stay classy, San Diego. (Sorry, I had
to say it).
