Summer sketchy relationship review
Traditionally, like on Theface
book, relationship status falls into one
of five categories: Single, In a Rela
tionship, In an Open Relationship,
Married and "blank." All of these des
ignations are confusion-free, with the
exception of "No Information Provid
ed." This undefined relationship status
can mean many things and describe
many people, from prostitutes and
priests to asexuals and necrophiliacs.
But "blank" can also be a blanket
category for seemingly normal people
who color outside the lines of a regular
relationship — the so-called hustlers,
pimps, players, playas and playaz.
More appropriately, these are the liars,
cheaters and sometimes criminals of
the D&R (Dating and Relationships)
scene. The following subcategorized
case studies outline some of their
traits, behaviors and weaknesses, with
a few tips on how to avoid them and
how to avoid becoming them (unless
you want to).
The Guy who talks about how
much he wants to marry his girlfriend
and picks out a ring and everything
and then it turns out that her brother
just proposed to his girlfriend so he de
cides to wait a little bit and then his
(the original Guy's) girlfriend gets
pregnant so in order to make sure they
have health insurance (since they're

both only twenty-two) they get legally
married down at the courthouse (the
Guy's job has decent health insurance,
dental too, and it's sweet that he has
that job in the first place — he makes
decent money — and he's pretty well
respected even though he's just a
young guy) and they decide to set the
wedding for six months after the baby
comes and everything looks like it will
turn out OK since none of his friends
or co-workers are really judging him:
they've all been there, or know some
body who's been there and they figure
that he will straighten up once the kid
is born because he is a bit of a party an
imal and he could really use some set
tling down, but boys will be boys, even
if they're married with a kid on the
way, so who knows, and things are
moving along but one day at the bar he
lets it slip to a few friends and co
workers (and after a few drinks: since
a few of those few were double shots
of Crown, his tongue is feeling pretty
loose) that he went to the strip club
one night after work last week and
met this gorgeous Italian dancer
(stripper) named Miranda or Mari
nara or whatever and since he is Ital
ian himself (well, half, sort of), they hit
it off and wound up exchanging num
bers and then hooking up in his car
and the friends are congratulatory to
his face but when he leaves they look
at each other stunned and let out exas
perated sighs and tell all their friends
what happened (and to keep it a se
cret), so it's a secret and then the guy
does it again and opens his mouth
about it again, probably because he
