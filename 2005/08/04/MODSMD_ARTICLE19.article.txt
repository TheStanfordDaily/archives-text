# Law prof. weighs in on Supreme Court nominee
## 
### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
Since President George W.
Bush's nomination of John G.
Roberts to the Supreme Court on
July 19, there has been intense
scrutiny on Roberts' personal and
professional background and
debate over whether they will have
a significant influence on the deci
sions he will make should he be
confirmed.
A native of Buffalo, N.Y.,
Roberts graduated from Harvard
College in 1976 summa cum
laude and received his law degree
at Harvard Law School magna
cum laude.
He clerked for Justice William
Rehnquist on the Supreme Court
from 1980 to 1981. Prior to practic
ing privately at Hogan & Hartson
law firm in 1986. he served in the
Reagan administration as a special
assistant to U.S. attorney general
and later served as the associate
counsel to the president.
In 1989, Roberts's affiliation
with Republican government con
tinued as he left private practice to
become deputy solicitor general
during the first Bush administra
tion. However, after Bush Sr.'s
defeat in the 1992 presidential elec
tion he returned to private practice
until he joined the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of
Columbia in 2003.
Whether or not his association
with two Republican governments
and his Catholic faith would influ
ence his approach to interpreting
the Constitution has generated
controversy. Roberts wrote in a
document dated Feb. 16, 1982, "It
really should not matter what the
personal ideology of our
appointees may be, so long as they
recognize that their ideology
should have no role in the deci
sional process."
However, Stanford Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg said he believes
that the complete divorce of
Roberts' personal and professional
background from the decision
making process, especially regard

ing the major issues such as abor
tion, the death penalty and same
sex marriage is not likely.
"He'll say [his background and
beliefs] have nothing to do with
decisions. But a person is what a
person is — these are all part of his
character and outlook," he said.
He's likely to be very skeptical of
broad rights in these areas."
There is also debate about how
Roberts' judicial philosophy could
affect his interpretation of the
Constitution.
In his testimony before
Congress in 2003, Roberts said, "I
don't necessarily think that it's the
best approach to have an all
encompassing philosophy. The
Supreme Court certainly doesn't.
There are some areas where they
apply what you might think of as a
strict construction; there are other
areas where they don't."
Weisberg called Roberts' denial
of having any judicial philosophy
"disingenuous," referencing
Roberts' "political loyalties" to
Republicans.
"It's pretty obvious that he will
be prone to take a so-called textual
originalist position as often as pos
sible, but that he's driven more by
less government is a better philoso
phy than a textual theory," he said.
Weisberg also speculated that
Roberts will vote with other con
servative judges.
"My guess is that he will usually
vote with Scalia and Thomas but
somewhat more often with
Rehnquist, and that his style will be
more like Rehnquist's than Scalia's
— more case-by-case, less overt
drum-beating," he said.
Despite the conflict over his
impending role on the Supreme
Court, many pundits and even
Stanford students have said they
believe that he is an extremely
qualified candidate regardless of
his personal opinions.
"As far as I can tell, he's a top
flight legal mind," said Justin Liu, a
junior majoring in philosophy.
"That's all I want from a Supreme
Court nomination, regardless of
the nominee's political views."
