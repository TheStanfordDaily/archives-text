# Computer science researchers hope to stump hackers
## Students work to protect passwords 
### ROSE JENKINS 
Aware of the rampant growth of
high-profile online information thefts,
a team of Stanford computer science
researchers said they feel that there is
clearly a need to make Internet users'
passwords more secure. These
researchers — Colin Jackson, a com
puter science doctoral student; junior
Nicholas Miyake: sophomore Blake
Ross; and computer science profes
sors Dan Boneh and John C. Mitchell
— have thus created a browser exten
sion that helps protect passwords and
is free and open to the public.
Ross started PwdHash during a
project fora Freshman Introductory
Seminar taught by Boneh in 2003-
2004, and the others joined the effort
later. Jackson presented a paper that
the team wrote about the product at
the 14th annual Usenix Security
Symposium in Baltimore, Md„ on
Aug. 3.
Many Internet users employ the
same password at a variety of sites,
Miyake explained. This is a problem
because hackers can steal passwords
from low-security websites, such as
dating websites and then use them to
circumvent the security systems at
other, more sensitive websites, like
those of a bank, he said.
Therefore, rather than focus on the
secure storage of passwords,
PwdHash creates new passwords that
fool hackers. When PwdHash users
visit a Web site that demands a pass
word. they either "choose a password
that starts with the special prefix'@@'
or press a special password key (F2),"
according to the research team. This
prompts PwdHash to jumble the actu
al password and mix it with text from
the site's web address, Jackson
explained. If hackers try to take the
password, they will see the scrambled
code rather than the actual password.
"Our solution is somewhat differ
ent than others in that we focus on

protecting the password itself rather
than informing the user about
whether or not they are at a legitimate
site," Miyake said.
PwdHash is available as both a
"plug-in" version, essentially a down
load, for Internet Explorer (at
http://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/)
and Mozilla Firefox (at
http://addons.mozilla.org), and as a
Web-based version that does not need
to be downloaded (https://www.pwd
hash.com/).
The security technique used in
PwdHash also makes it a useful
defense against phishing, the common
hacking strategy in which hackers set
up fake Web sites to look like their
authentic counterparts, collect users'
passwords, and then use them at
other, more secure sites, Jackson said.
Because PwdHash creates scram
bled passwords, hackers will
unknowingly collect false passwords
which they will not be able to use at
other sites.
Though it was not originally
designed to prevent phishing, the
PwdHash team has also investigated
and attempted to thwart other com
mon phishing techniques, like
Javascript codes that would detect the
users' keystrokes and thus the actual
password.
"Almost all of these are scenarios
that we thought about ourselves —
we would brainstorm ways that one
might attack the plug-in. implement
samples of such techniques if neces
sary and then figure out how to
defend against it," Miyake said.
Notably, PwdHash is not com
pletely foolproof. Users have report
ed incompatibility with certain
browsers and with certain websites,
but its creators have been working
hard to address those problems.
While an older version of the
extension is available for Internet
Explorer, most of the updates are
being made to the plug-in for Firefox.

Also, the software cannot completely
prevent the original password from
being deciphered. Hackers could still
use the "offline dictionary attack"
method to hash all possible passwords
until they find a match for the one
they've stolen, thus identifying the
password, Miyake explained. The fea
sibility of this technique depends on
the strength of the original password.
"Under this scenario it would be
possible for an attacker to recover the
user's password, but if the user wasn't
using PwdHash their password would
have been exposed without the
attacker even having to do a dictio
nary attack, so it does provide more
protection," Miyake said.
Users have recognized the addi
tional protection provided by
PwdHash. According to Jackson,
thousands have downloaded either
the Internet Explorer version posted
on the team's Web site about a year
ago, or the Mozilla version made
available there in mid-July.
And Miyake said that more than
250 people downloaded the Firefox
plug-in from the Mozilla website on
July 29, the first day it was posted.
The researchers say they intention
ally left the software's source code open
and free, even for commercial use,
because they hope anyone who wants
to will take it up and incorporate the
extension's strategies into browsers and
a broader Internet security package.
"It hasn't gone through the kind of
quality assurance process that com
mercial products do," Jackson said.
"We're hoping that someone bigger
than us with more marketing muscle
will pick up the project and put it in
the hands of the average user."
Miyake noted, "If our methods of
hashing passwords to protect them
are adopted by major browser mak
ers, password authentication on the
Internet would become much more
secure."
