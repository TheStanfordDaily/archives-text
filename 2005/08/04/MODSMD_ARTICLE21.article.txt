# "Mozart Effect" theory evaluated
## 
### KATHERINE MATSUI 
Many Americans harbor an obses
sion with their children's education,
said Chip Heath, associate professor
of organizational behavior at
Stanford. After studying the prolifera
tion of the "Mozart Effect" in media
outlets from 1993 to 2001, Heath said
that people across the nation latched
onto this concept in an attempt to
quell their concerns about failing edu
cation systems, according to an article
published July 27 by the Stanford
Business Wire.
Adrian Bangerter, a Swiss psychol
ogist who participated in a post-doc
torate program in the Stanford psy
chology department in 2002, conduct
ed the study with Heath. Bangerter
researches psycholinguistics, and he
and Heath decided to pursue the
study because they were interested in
the ways in which ideas evolve in soci
ety, Heath told The Daily.
The "Mozart Effect" refers to the
claim that listening to Mozart and
other classical music can improve
one's 10 or bolster one's academic
performance. It was originally cham
pioned in a 1993 'Nature' journal
report titled "Music and Spatial Task

Performance," the Business Wire
reported. Although this study tested
only college-age individuals, showed
minimal and evanescent improve
ments in 10, and could not be repro
duced, the study's claims hit the
ground running — and Americans
eagerly devoured them.
"My math teacher plays classical
music during tests," said Katrin Sharp,
a high school student from Salt Lake
City, Utah who is currently attending
a summer program at Stanford. "He
says it stimulates our brains."
The Business Wire article says that
people in the U.S. began to believe
that listening to classical music had
profound effects on high school kids,
small children, babies and even fetus
es, despite the fact that these age
groups had never been studied.
To back up their claim that
Americans' obsession with early
childhood education provided fertile
breeding ground for the "Mozart
Effect," Heath and Bangerter count
ed the number of times newspapers in
each state mentioned the effect, says
the Business Wire Article. Then, they
looked at the condition and quality of
each state's system of early education.
Heath said he and Bangerter had

ample data with which to work.
"The Mozart Effect was a nice start
because we could find exactly where it
was horn and we could track it as it
grew up," Heath told The Daily.
They found that in states such as
Georgia and Florida, where educa
tion systems are particularly unsatis
factory, newspapers covered the
"Mozart Effect" at higher rates than
newspapers in states with better edu
cation systems, according to the
Business Wire.
From his study, Heath further
claims that when societies are con
fronted with problems, they are eager
to snatch up solutions, even when their
sources are not reliable, explained the
Business Wire. Additionally, he sug
gested that when media outlets give a
certain topic extensive coverage, it
often does so due to occurrences such
as government decisions and new
bxx)k releases rather than the unveil
ing of scientific data.
Heath emphasizes the fact that his
theory is just that — a theory, report
ed the Business Wire. It could just be
the "convenient answer," he said in
the article, adding, "we've got to look
fora realistic way out instead of an
easy way out."
