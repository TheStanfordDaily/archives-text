## Hospital promotes patient safety 
### AYSHA PAMUKCU 
In an effort to prevent unneces
sary deaths of hospital patients,
Stanford Hospital and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital recently
joined the Bay Area Patient Safety
Collaborative, an affiliation of Bay
Area hospitals that work together to
improve patient safety.
The Hospital Council of Northern
California, or HCNC, launched the
collaborative as part of a national
effort by the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement, or IHI, to save
100,(XX) lives a year by improving
health care quality and safety. The
Sacramento-based HCNC is a non
profit hospital and health system
trade association representing over
200 California hospitals. The IHI,
based in Cambridge, Mass., is a non
profit organization that aims to
improve the quality of health care in
the United States.
The Bay Area Collaborative start
ed July 26. Its members include 32
hospitals in Santa Clara, San
Francisco. San Mateo. Alameda and
Marin.
"Across the board pretty much

anyone [at participating hospitals]
who has direct patient care is
involved [in the project]. This touch
es just about everyone," said Sandra
Trotter, patient safety program man
ager at the Children's Hospital.
In the United States, preventable
medical errors in hospitals kill as
many as 98,(XX) patients a year —
more than motor vehicle accidents,
breast cancer or AIDS — according
to a 1999 report released by the
Institute of Medicine.
To combat preventable errors, the
IHI campaign has enlisted over 2,500
hospitals, nearly half of the nation's
roughly 5,000 acute-care hospitals.
According to Joe McCannon, IHl's
campaign manager, if every U.S. hos
pital participated in the institute's
safety initiatives, over 180,000 lives
would be saved annually.
"Introducing these changes reli
ably and completely will improve the
quality of care for patients, signifi
cantly reducing morbidity and mor
tality," McCannon said. "This is the
primary aim of our work."
Participating hospitals agree to
implement six steps to improve
health care quality and reduce pre

vcntable error. They must create
rapid-response teams trained to
assist at-risk patients and reliable
care for heart attack patients.
Furthermore, they must make efforts
to avoid adverse drug reactions, pre
vent central line infections, prevent
ventilator-associated pneumonia and
reduce surgical-site infections.
According to Trotter, the
Collaborative uses a new approach to
health care that emphasizes hospital
communication and education
through methods such as monthly
conference calls and quarterly meet
ings.
"I've been in health care for over
20 years and I've never seen this kind
of collaboration between hospitals
that share the same geographical
region," Trotter said. "Hospitals are
businesses. But with this program,
instead of competing, we're putting
that aside for patient safety. We're
going to learn from each other."
Many hospitals have been eager
to join the nationwide effort, espe
cially because of its relatively inex
pensive, procedural approach to
patient safety.
"Changes should not require

additional resources — what we are
talking about are changes in process
that will allow departments to oper
ate more efficiently and ultimately
reduce costs through the provision of
better care," said McCannon.
"Above all, these are very practical,
straightforward interventions that we
believe will reduce harm to patients
and save a lot of lives. All the inter
ventions that we're introducing
should be available to all recipients
of care 1(X) percent of the time."
Stanford Hospital has already

implemented five of the six IHI inter
ventions. The Children's Hospital
has implemented the five interven
tions that apply to pediatrics.
"If we're successful here, we'll...
create an unprecedented national
network for change that will improve
the health care system in other areas
— a group of thousands of hospitals
that will know how to make improve
ment and will do so through ongoing
collaboration, locally and nationally,
in the years to come," McCannon
said.
