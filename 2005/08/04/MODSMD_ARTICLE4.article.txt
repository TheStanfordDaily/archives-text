# Solar car turns in impressive showing

### ADAM WIDMAN NEWS EDITOR 
On July 27, Stanford's solar vchicle 'Solstice' finished the
North American Solar Challenge, or NASC — a journey
from Austin, Tex., to Calgary, Canada — in 68 hours and 4
seconds. The vehicle placed first in Stock Class, just in front
of UC-Berkeley's car, and ninth overall in the competition.
The University of Michigan team placed first in the open
class competition.
Although Stanford has competed in the NASC for many
years, this is the first year a Stanford vehicle won its class.
"1 am extremely excited with our finish in this year's
race," said Addison Shelton, a team member of the Stanford
Solar Car Project. "We have been working extremely hard to
test our solar car and make sure that it was ready to run all
2,500 miles without any major problems ... We think that this
win will help build more excitement at Stanford about solar
car racing."
The 2,500-mile NASC was sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Energy. According to Shelton, who graduated
in June, the 10-day race, with its stages and checkpoints, has
rules similar to cycling's Tour de France. All solar cars are
accompanied by both lead and chase vehicles and must race
from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. of each race day.
Mechanical Team Leader Brian Cheung, Stock Class
vehicles must use commercially available solar cells to power
their engines. Faster vehicles in the race use higher quality
— even space grade — cells to power their cars, which can
often produce twice the power of a Stock Class vehicle.
Cheung added that Stanford's car was considerably cheaper
than many faster vehicles.
"We spent about $35,000 on our array; a good open class
array is approaching $100,000 or more," Cheung said.
Team member Brian Belmont said that Solstice had a
"shaky start" after electrical problems on the first day.
According to Cheung, the problems cost the team about a

half hour and temporarily subdued the team's high expecta
tions.
"I'd like to say that we expected to win our class, but after
the breakdown at the starting line, we realized that we defi
nitely had a lot of work ahead of us," Cheung said. "After
that point, I really didn't think too much about winning or
what place we were in, and it wasn't really a main focus for
our team until near the end when we were neck and neck with
Cal. We just did what we could to get our car and our team
going to the best of our abilities, and I'm happy to say that it
worked out for us."
Team member and head logistician Robert McConnell
said that the team spent much of the race catching up with
Cal until passing the Bears late in the race. Afterwards, the
competition remained tight.
"We entered the last day twelve minutes ahead, but... our

worst fears were realized when Cal blew by us going about 10
mph faster than we were, a huge amount in solar car races,"
said McConnell, who also recently graduated. "Fortunately,
we chose to try to stick with them and they didn't have quite
as much extra juice as they seemed to have, and we caught up
with them by the time we entered Calgary."
"A last-minute electrical problem sidelined them on the
Calgary streets and we actually managed to extend our victo
ry to s solid 25 minutes on the last day,"he said.
Although the next NASC will take place in 2007,
McConnell said he thinks the team will start preparing for it
soon.
"Work for the 2007 race is probably going to get started as
soon as the new school year starts," he said. "Building a solar
car is a huge endeavor, so we'll need as much time, money
and manpower as possible."
