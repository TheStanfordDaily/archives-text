## Sketch Procrastination vacation 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
I grow increasingly convinced that the major
reason faculty seem so damn smart is because
when they were graduate students there was no
Internet. So instead of researching Britney and
Kevin, they were actually researching.
To put it another way, the World Wide Web
may be helping millions of teenage boys and
girls get off (well, perhaps not just teenagers),
but it's also ruining a generation of prospective
academics.

You see, it's awfully diffi
cult to settle down in front
of a computer and work
when the melodious tinkle
of the net is just a couple of
clicks away.
Ah. The Internet. How do
I love thee. Let me count the
ways. I love thee to the depth
and breadth and height my
soul can reach... Sorry, I can
get a little carried away on this
subject.

It's not just me, though. It's not even just
Stanford. All over the post-graduate world,
potential Ph.Ds are floundering in their re
search and drowning in the latest news on
TomKat (well, perhaps not everyone follows
the TomKat thing quite so closely) or some
thing similar.
Procrastination is not, of course, exclusively
the province of the wired, but they seem to have
an edge over the rest. Not only is surfing just a
different sort of time-wasting — it transcends
mere screwing around and reaches a sort of
higher plane.
For example, you can waste time each morn
ing reading The New York Times in print. It
maybe takes a couple of hours if you're dedicat
ed, but it gets boring pretty quickly. Do the same
thing online, though, and the scope for playing
expands exponentially. And there's porn.
Speaking of playing brings me on to the es
sential appeal of the electronic mistress. She's a

wonderful toy. A pretty plaything with buttons
to press, knobs to turn and fun, fun, fun galore.
You can't help but fall fora lady who's so
willing to be tweaked and twisted. And — even
better — she's always on call.
Actually, aside from the cheap hooker analo
gies, the net is pretty special. Fora start it's a
lethally addictive drug.
Back in the wayward days of my youth (well,
I wish they were wayward) I used to smoke a lot.
During my peak I was puffing through a good 30
each day (strangely, I was also much cooler
then). But I gave it up. I went cold turkey. And I
was lucky, it was easy.
I went through the same thing with tempo
rary alcohol suspension — there was no prob
lem locking up the liquor fora year and starting
to remember the night before.
The Internet, though, that's proving to be a
much harder habit to kick. I just can't do it. If I
close my laptop lid, my fingers start twitching. I
develop an uncontrollable tic where my head
flicks intermittently from side to side. And the
only cure is Firefox.
It's an insidious addiction, eating into every
thing — your plans to intersperse a whole day of
work with carefully plotted breaks for surfing...
well, they often devolve into plans to intersperse
a whole day of surfing with carefully plotted
breaks for work.
After all, can you avoid asking yourself
whether or not it's really worth missing out on
the thrice-hourly checks on celeb gossip just to
get that extra degree? No one cares about your
research. And if they did, they could just go to
www.l3thcenturyrussianpeasants.com and find
out whatever they needed.
Speaking of which, I should really get back to
"work." I've been at this for the last hour and I'm
not sure I can handle it any longer without some
serious Web time. Plus that Russian peasant
thing has got me a little curious...

Bored? Waste some time and e-mail
navins@stanford.edu. Oh, and if you're wonder
ing about the title, well I'm a sucker fora cute
voice and a firm believer in paying homage.
