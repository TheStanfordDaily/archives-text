## Supreme Court rashly rewrites property law in Kelo decision 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
Likely lost in the political consciousness amid
the hubbub of Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor's retirement and replacement is
the Court's mind-boggling evisceration of the
Fifth Amendment.
The Supreme Court has been known to inter
pret rights not stated in the document, such as the
freedoms of association and privacy. But in the case
of Kelo vs. New London, the justices took it upon
themselves to explicitly edit the Bill of Rights.
Amendment V, which guarantees due
process of law and protects against self-incrimi
nation, also states "nor shall private property be
taken for public use, without just compensation."
"Eminent domain" has always been a govern
ment power, and one that I grudgingly accept.
(For comparison, I also accept that even democ

ratic free societies are sometimes forced to con
script their citizens). It is in the sense of "public
use" that property can be bought by the govern
ment without the consent of the owner, for the es
tablishment of roads, schools, airports and other
public amenities.
But Kelo wasn't about building a military base
or a sewage plant or even rebuilding a blighted
neighborhood. lastead, the New London Devel
opment Corporation, or NLDC, a private body,
sought to complement a nearby Pfizer facility
with, among other things, a hotel and retail shops.
It would seem to be a problem that the land
the NLDC desired was owned by city residents.
No matter — the city simply exerted its privilege
of eminent domain to boot the owners off their
property, arguing that the economic develop-
ment and tax revenue of the project
was in the "public interest" and justi
fied the action. The owners of 15 homes
held out and refused to sell initiating a
legal chain reaction that ended a month
ago in D.C.
Apparently, the purpose of attor
neys is to make the law mean what it
doesn't say, because that's what the
Court did. Unswayed by the dissent
of the conservative bloc and swingin'
Sandra Day, the left side of the
Court led a 5-4 ruling for the city of
New London.
Justice John Paul Stevens' majority
cited "appreciable benefits to the com
munity" and dismissed those who envi
sion abuse of the ruling, writing "the
hypothetical cases... can be confronted
if and when they arise."
Despite the obvious differences of
the two terms, for legal purposes, "pub
lic use" now means "public interest." In
other words, private property can now
be ceded to other private owners — on
the whim of city council members and
other solons of the local administration.
(The dispossessed still have the right of
"just compensation," but it's difficult to

expect "just compensation" from a gov
ernment body in cahoots with a single
buyer market).
Anyone who saw "You've Got
Mail" understands the commercial
clout that corporate franchises can wield
against small businesses. Now they have
a new weapon in their arsenal: the local
government gets to decide which busi
ness is the most worthy.
Here's guessing that with all the
wining and dining, the authorities will
more often than not rule for the giants
— responsive not to the customers and
community but to the bottom line, as
determined by some corporate execu
tive in a skyscraper.
No system, capitalist or not, can
survive if the well-heeled are allowed
to outright swallow the middle class
with the government enabling (see the
French Revolution). Kelo opens the
door to a command economy — led
by corporate suits in league with local
political hacks.
Somewhere Karl Marx is laughing.
Kelo is a legal approval of forced
transfer of wealth — with the redis
tribution going up the ladder instead
of down it. O'Connor issued a
scathing dissent: "Any property may
now be taken for the benefit of an
other private party, but the fallout
from this decision will not be random.
The beneficiaries are likely to be

those citizens with disproportionate
influence and power in the political
process, including large corporations
and development firms."
Who's to say now that the seen-bet
ter-days Massachusetts community of
Newburyport won't be told by their
city council to shut down the Park
Lunch Bar to make room for an Out
back Steakhouse?
Beyond the economic arguments,
it's also dismal to think about what
might happen to the country's real es
tate artifacts in the wake of Kelo. For
those who have not traveled outside
the west, nor strayed from the sub
urbs, it can be difficult to imagine the
sheer wonder of the buildings on the
East Coast — historic monuments to
bygone ages.
The colonial and Victorian houses
that dot New England (including those
of New London), the woody bars and
restaurants of Pennsylvania's steel and
coal towns, the shoreline shacks of the
Mid-Atlantic — these are all under
threat for "tax revenues" that are now
the litmus test for the public good.
And the kicker — who's to say
these new businesses won't shut down
and outsource their employees when
the next recession hits?
The battle is not quite over. In
censed citizens have called fora Con
necticut Tea Party as various states

move to limit eminent domain, and the
Kelo plaintiffs have attempted to ap
peal the Court's decision.
There is humorous irony brewing.
One developer in Weare, N.H. has
plans to build a hotel on the current site
of Justice David Souter's house. Each
room would be stocked with a copy of
Ayn Rand's anti-authoritarian novel
"Atlas Shrugged."
The consolidation of power and the
transfer of rights is reaching critical
mass.
It's happening in drinks. The brew
ing industry has long been controlled
by the Big Three (Coors, Miller and
Anheuser-Busch), who are buying up
microbrew brands and destroying
craft-brew products in the process.
It's happening in music, where the
label executives own their artists'
works and performances.
It's happening in technology,
where companies with gargantuan
legal departments secure untold
amounts of realized and unrealized in
tellectual property and sue the shirt off
of any possible competitor.
And now it has come literally to
your backyard. Patrick Henry was right
to say he smelled a rat.
