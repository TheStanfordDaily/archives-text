## Imagine that 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
The nursing home where I volunteered last
year had an interesting sign in the foyer. Like a
poster from kindergarten, it displayed the day of
the week, the date and the weather. But it had

something I'd never seen on a
school poster — "The year is:
2004."
It's easy to tell that our
thoughts are affected by what
day of the week we think it is,
by how we think we look at
the moment, where we think
we are and so on. We'd be
having different thoughts if
we were at Golden Gate Park
on Sunday morning.

But these changeable circumstances are
only a few of the things that affect us. People
have different thoughts when they think it's still
the '30s or '40s, as I observed at the nursing
home, but most of us aren't aware of the impact
of, say, thinking it's 2005, since we rarely try
thinking otherwise.
I think we ought to. It can be informative to
try to live fora while with different assumptions.
If the brain includes a massive version of the
nursing home's sign, with slots for keeping track
of everything that might influence our thoughts,
it's worthwhile — not to mention entertaining
— to change up the answers every now and then
to see how much these background facts and as
sumptions affect us. Think about your personal
nursing home "sign" —where you think you
are, what sort of world you live in and how you
relate to it. Then see if you have different atti
tudes when you do the following fora few min
utes, hours or days:
• Imagine that Stanford is a second-tier uni
versity. You don't get any credit for being here.
If you're a student, you'll have to stand out here
in order to go anywhere in the future.
• Imagine that no one pays to attend Stan
ford. Everyone is here on a merit scholarship
funded by the endowment.
• Take down the "Stanford" and "Califror

ilia" and "United States" placards from your
sign and put up something else in the slots for
where you're living. Looking around, it's not
hard to imagine that we're in Melbourne, San
Miguel or even a Martian colony. (This one is
particularly fun.)
• Switch the terms "men" and "women" and
imagine that women are always more intelligent
and capable than men.
• Record the "facts" that women provide the
bulk of family income, take the leading role in
relationships and propose the majority of mar
riages.
• Consider the humanities more challenging
than technical subjects.
• Imagine that you will be executed if you
fail to achieve a 4.0 grade point average. Alter
nately, imagine that no one but you will see
your grades.
• 1 magine that you are one of the smartest ten
people at Stanford. Then imagine that you're
less intelligent than average.
• Think of yourself as incredibly attractive or
exceptionally ugly.
• Try believing in God if you don't, and try
disbelieving if you do. Pretend that our culture
worships the sun or that the South Bay's Mission
Peak is a holy site.
• Imagine that all living things are sentient
and occasionally can communicate with hu
mans. Pretend that plants can understand you if
you talk to them.
• Mix up your idea of the state of the world.
Tell yourself that the human population is two
billion and stable and that there are vast conti
nents we leave relatively unsoiled. Imagine that
humans are living sustainably.
• Pretend that humans are only one of many
species of similar intelligence and influence on
the world. Perhaps North America belongs to
the humans, but a race of land-dwelling dolphins
rules Asia and gorillas and chimpanzees control
Subsaharan Africa.
• Pretend that the world is set to end in 1(X)
years, after you're dead — but perhaps while
your grandchildren are alive.
