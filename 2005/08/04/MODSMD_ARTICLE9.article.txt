Justice Roberts threatens Roe v. Wade
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Con
nor was a powerful force for moderation, inde
pendence and consensus building on a much di
vided court. Judging from the giddy anticipation
on the right and from the anti-abortion move
ment, Supreme Court nominee John Roberts
will be anything but a consensus builder. Let's
just hope he doesn't push the Supreme Court too
far to the right.
Remember how the anti-choice jihadists went
off with the mere mention of Alberto Gonzales
being a replacement for O'Connor. John Roberts
selection as Supreme Court nominee has quieted
down this noisy contingent. Roberts is solidly in
the religious right's corner. White House spin will
tell you just the opposite.

Roe vs. Wade is just a memory even as a recent
poll confirmed 68% of Americans are against
overturning Roe vs. Wade while 29% were for
overturning it. We are about to witness what a
committed religious and extremist minority can do
when they take over a government.

Religious leaders should denounce attacks
As the death toll rises in the Egyptian bomb
ings and London encounters its second terrorist
attack, there is one certain way, albeit one requir
ing a great deal of courage, of defusing tensions. I
would urge the entire Muslim community to un
equivocally condemn these killings and offer

reparations to the families of those that died.
Likewise, I would urge all religious groups, par
ticularly the Christian Church and all the pro-life
advocates, to condemn the senseless slaughter of
thousands of innocent civilians in Iraq and Pales
tine and offer reparations to the families of those
that have perished because of the thoroughly dis
credited polices of Bush, Blair and Sharon. This
would demonstrate that our community religious
leaders can 'walk the walk' with a strong commit
ment to the sanctity of human life. Political lead
ers have sown the seeds of rage and hatred and in
nocent civilians are reaping the tragic outcome.
Meanwhile religious leaders have chosen to re
main silent bringing dishonor to their faith and
our common creator.
