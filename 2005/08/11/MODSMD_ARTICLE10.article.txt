# Hazards of Dorm Life

I've heard happier people live longer and
have better lives.
Because of that, I try to go through my day
with a cheerful disposition and avoid any nega

don't mind you going through my private stuff
and borrowing $20 without asking me and then

going haywire.
All I could think about were all the ways
each of them had wronged me. Every miniscule
old grudge stormed in my brain. Thoughts of
"you borrowed my pen and never gave it back"
or "you kept the much bigger piece to the
chocolate bar that we shared" or "I know he
was never actuallv mine, but you stole the boy
