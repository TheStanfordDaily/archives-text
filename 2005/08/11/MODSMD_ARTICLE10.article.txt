# Hazards of Dorm Life
## Just one of those days 
### TINA LIN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
I've heard happier people live longer and
have better lives.
Because of that, I try to go through my day
with a cheerful disposition and avoid any nega
tive feelings toward others. No, of course I
don't mind you going through my private stuff
and borrowing $20 without asking me and then
forgetting to pay me back. No, of course I don't
mind that my best friend didn't choose me to be
his partner for that project. Silly things like that
aren't supposed to bother me.
Ever have one of those days when nothing in
particular is wrong, yet everything just feels
like it is? You know, one of those days where
you got up on the wrong side of bed and ended
up being moody with childish tendencies the
rest of the day. Why do those days happen?
That was me a few days ago. Something
about everyone and everything annoyed me.
Seeing different people would trigger old child

ish silent grudges. There are definitely people
that live with cloudy skies all the time, but for
me it's usually either sunshine or pouring rain.
I get in such weird funky moods where I just get
upset or am reminded that I used to be upset
over the silliest of things.
Some of my best friends from home were
having a slumber party and called me to catch
up on things in life since I hadn't gone home
for the summer. It was great hearing from
them. I was polite and excited to talk to all of
them since I haven't seen any of them since
high school graduation, but my brain was just
going haywire.
All I could think about were all the ways
each of them had wronged me. Every miniscule
old grudge stormed in my brain. Thoughts of
"you borrowed my pen and never gave it back"
or "you kept the much bigger piece to the
chocolate bar that we shared" or "I know he
was never actuallv mine, but you stole the boy
you knew 1 liked and he liked me
back" or "you snapped at me and
called me stupid as a joke in seventh
grade gym once" kept entering my
thoughts ... and these were my best
friends, the people I had the greatest
of memories with. 1 felt so foolish
and selfish for thinking these trivial
thoughts 1 would never admit to
thinking. Why had all these little
things suddenly come back?
My bad mood and 1 were sitting at
a fast food joint waiting for my order
and trying to find something inspira
tional for my column. Instead of in
spiration, thoughts of things that had

ticked me off in the past (but that I
had let slide) played over and over
like a broken record.
There's an older employee there
who always enthusiastically calls out
order numbers as if he were a radio
commercial announcer. The younger
employees there are nice, but they al
ways sound like they're following a
script. Not only is this guy entertain
ing, but he represents customer ser
vice at its finest. This one day, before
he would let me pick up my order, he
stopped and said, out of the blue,
"Did you know that thinking too
much about something is like shak
ing up a bottle of soda? That's a
messy idea." Then he gave a genuine
smile and resumed his sunny per
sona.
What just happened? How can a
stranger give another complete

stranger appropriate advice in the
most unexpected of locations?
Maybe he's psychic. Maybe he's
crazy and saying random things that
coincidently worked. Maybe I just
looked that moody. In any case, his
unexpected words subdued the
storm in my head and his smile
brightened the day.
Basically, the moral of this col
umn is that a smile goes a long way
and repressing negative feelings by
pretending to be happy and "okay"
with things is like saving the little rain
clouds in a bottle. When you shake it
up, it just explodes.

matter how stupid they sound. If
