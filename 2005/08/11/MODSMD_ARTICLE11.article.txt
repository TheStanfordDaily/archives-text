Saudi Ties Still Too Strong
It appears that our Saudi co-dependency
has become stronger than ever. Last Friday,
Bush senior accompanied by Halliburton's
benefactor, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney,
made another pilgrimage to Riyadh to assure
the House of Saud that our unhealthy addic
tion for their oil remains unabated. "The rela
tionship has tremendously improved with the
United States," gushed Saudi Foreign Minis
ter Saud al Faisal. Forgotten is that most of
the Sept. 11 perpetrators came from Saudi
Arabia. Forgotten is most of the religious
schools spewing a virulent form of Islam have
been funded by Saudi money. Forgotten is the
enormous repression of Saudi women who are
virtual prisoners in the House of Saud's dys
functional kingdom.
And yet, we embrace the Saudis as friends

and view our former ally, Saddam Hussein, as a
monster. We declared war on Iraq and killed
thousands of their people which our compliant
media described as being in "shock and awe,"
ignoring the immorality of such an action. We
claim to revere life, as evidenced by the passion
generated by the pro-lifers, but abort the life of
tens of thousands of innocent civilians with no
visible signs of remorse.
Our government has committed crimes
against humanity. The appalling visual images of
human suffering from the atomic bombs dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki still remain hidden
from the U.S. public. Sadly, our government con
tinues the same strategy of censoring the human
carnage of the war in Iraq to quell a public outcry
and demand accountability for this madness.

Daily Op-Ed Misdirects Blame
I would like to comment on Ilias Chrisso
choidis' letter to the Daily (published on July
21, 2005), since there were several issues that
caught my attention. While apparently "deeply
touched" by the London tragedies, Chrisso
choidis proceeds to state in an off-handed man
ner that undoubtedly "Londoners will over
come the trauma." He then proceeds to go to
great lengths to show that Londoners (and
Americans, of course) are the ones to blame for
these attacks — suicide bombings apparently
are repercussions of what the U.S. and Britain
have done in the Middle East. I wonder what
Mr. Chrissochoidis had to say about the chil
dren of Beslan being massacred by terrorists —
I suppose they had it coming as well.
Well, let's take a look at what the U.S. and
Britain have done in the Middle East. They

have removed Saddam Hussein from power —
that certainly was a crime! Mr. Chrissochoidis
obviously was not deeply touched by the plight
of the Kurds, political dissidents and thousands
of others murdered and tortured under Hus
sein's rule. The U.S. supports Israel — another
obvious transgression!
There's no reason to support the only democ
racy in the Middle East, and no reason to be
upset when Israeli children are blown up by
suicide bombers.
On the other hand, while unfazed by the
fate of the terrorism victims, Mr. Chrisso
choidis seems to have compassion to spare for
suicide bombers themselves. Indeed, those
men have been brainwashed and manipulated,
but let's not forget who the real victims are.
