## Men display depth at Irvine Nationals 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
You can say this for the swimmers on the Stanford men's squad: They
know exactly how to make their presence known. The Cardinal chose to
announce their arrival with the 100-meter backstroke at the Cono
coPhillips Summer National Swimming Championships, taking four of the
top five finishes in the event.
Randall Bal, Qass 0f2003, led the charge for the Cardinal in Irvine, Calif.,
winning the 100 back for the third straight year at Summer Nationals with a
time of 54.09 seconds. Despite the win, Bal expressed disappointment that a
sub-54.00 time had eluded him again.
Recent graduate Peter Marshall finished in second right behind Bal, with
2005 graduate Jayme Cramer pulling into fourth place with a time of 55.25.
Rising junior Ben Wildman-Tobriner scored the Cardinal clan's only
other victory in the meet, touching the wall first in the 50 freestyle. His time
of 22.13 just barely beat the 22.15 posted by the world champion in the event,
Roland Schoeman.
"Roland is still the world champion, but you have to do it when it counts,"
Wildman-Tobriner said. "I still respect him incredibly. He's still the fastest
man in the world."
Wildman-Tobriner also picked up a pair of fifth-place finishes, in the 100
free and the 100-meter butterfly.
Cramer managed an impressive showing in the 200-meter free against two
of the top swimmers in the world—Olympic gold medalists Klete Keller and
Michael Phelps. Cramer picked up the top preliminary time for the event,
1:48.71, outdoing Phelps by a little over a second. But Phelps walked away
with the win, with Keller behind. Cramer finished third with a time of 1:48.19.
Rising senior Tobias Oriwol paved the way for the Cardinal's individual
medley specialists in the 200-meter race, picking up a fourth-place finish in
2:03.90. Classmate Mark Stephens touched in just behind in fifth.
Sisters Tara and Dana Kirk (a 2004 graduate and a rising senior, re
spectively) headlined the women's effort for Palo Alto Stanford Aquat
ics, as usual.
Tara Kirk competed in both her signature breast stroke events, placing
4th in the 200 and 3rd in the 100. The 100 winner, California's Jessica
Hardy, has begun to make a habit of beating out Kirk, as she did at the
World Championships in Montreal last week and the Santa Clara Inter
national Meet last month.
Dana Kirk touched the wall in fourth place in the 200-meter butterfly with
a time of 2:29.83, then raced into second place in the 100-meter fly, on the
heels of winner Elaine Breeden.
Rising sophomore Brooke Bishop continued her summer success at the
meet, finishing third in the 50 free with a time of 25.79, then taking fourth in
the 100 backstroke.
Incoming freshman Andrea Axtell found her stride in the relay events
with her team from Longhorn Aquatics. Axtell led off the 800 free relay,
swimming a 2:04.62 split for the second-place quartet. She also aided the
third-place 400 medley relay team, swimming a 1:04.11 lead-off leg.
