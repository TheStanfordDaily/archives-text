# Legend coaches final event
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
Richard Quick has said that during his time
as the Stanford women's swimming coach, he's
"lived a dream." Quick spent 29 years at the
helm of NCAA swim programs both at Texas
and Stanford and owns more national titles
than any other coach in the sport's history (12),
in addition to being a six-time Olympic coach.
On Sunday, Quick's dream closed with
graceful triumph at the Summer National
Championships in Irvine, Calif., as his 400-
meter medley relay team gifted him with a win
in his final event as a coach.
Rising sophomore Brooke Bishop, rising se
nior Dana Kirk and 2004 graduate Tara Kirk
combined with Liv Jensen in the Palo Alto
Stanford Aquatics effort. Bishop led off the
race with a 1:03.55 backstroke split, followed by
Tara Kirk's 1:08.73 breaststroke and Dana
Kirk's 59.84 butterfly. Jensen swam the anchor

leg in 57.88, sealing the farewell for Quick.
"This was my last swimming meet as a coach,
and it's kind of a strange feeling because I've
wanted to be a swimming coach since I was 12
years old," Quick said. "The biggest thing I'm
going to miss is being a partner with the athletes
and living their dreams. I just loved that, and
I'm going to miss it a lot."
Quick will now head back to his home in
Austin, Tex. to spend more time with his family,
especially his doting grandchildren Blake and
Emily. (Emily even postponed her 10th birthday
party so that her grandfather could attend).
Swimming will continue to play a role in the
62-year-old Quick's name, of course. He will
accept a position as a Master coach for USA
Swimming and provide coaching for some of
the country's top racers, in addition to public
speaking and clinic appearances. Quick will
also join a national steering committee which
governs the policymaking aspects of the sport
he coached for 40 years.
