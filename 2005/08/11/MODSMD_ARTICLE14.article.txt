# I know how it feels to be Raffy—really

### 
Dear Mr. Palmeiro,
When I heard the news about your posi
tive test for the powerful steroid Stanozolol, 1
was crushed.
At first.
You have always been honest about the
(ahem) "performance-enhancing" drugs you

use. Your endorsements
have allowed middle-aged
men everywhere to feel
comfortable with the
(cough) flabbiness of their
muscles, secure with the
knowledge that you were in
their company. But since
your test results became
public, I have begun to
wonder if it was the side-

effects of steroids, not old age, which led you
to become the spokesman for Viagra.
Since the events of last Tuesday, however,
when I found myself in a similarly sticky situ
ation, I have come to empathize with your
predicament.
It was at the end of a long day of painting
in the hot Southern California sun at my job
at a studio in Los Angeles. I was waiting for an
elevator in the lobby of a 12-story office
building so that I could take my paint cart
downstairs and call it a day.
But as I went to pull the cart into the ele
vator, the front left wheel got stuck in a crack.
The paint can toppled over, the lid slid off,
and a thick layer of grey #16 spilled over the
lobby's shiny tile floor.
And what did I do?
1 just stood there, dumfounded and mo
tionless, unsure of what to do. For about a
minute, as the security tapes later revealed. I
stood still as the paint crept around my an
kles, much as your detractors claim that you
stayed the course, continuing to use steroids
as the doping scandal enveloped your sport
this past winter.
The woman behind the front desk saw
the paint and asked if 1 wanted her to call
my boss.
"No," 1 told her, the gears in my head turn
ing. "Call janitorial." It was the perfect plan:
get Alejandro, the janitor, over here to help
me clean up the mess. Lay down wads of
paper towels, spray it clean, and pretend like
it never happened. No one would ever know.
It was going really well until Ivory, my
boss, got on the elevator with Alejandro and
1 while we were returning from a trip to get
cleaning supplies. Our arms were filled with
strips of cardboard that we had ripped from
boxes to sweep up the paint.
Ivory looked at my bare feet.
He looked at the cardboard.
And he shook his head, probably wonder
ing if I had been ingesting heavy drugs, simi
lar to the ones that Bud Selig claims you have
been, um, experimenting with.
Then, taking a page from the book ol
every owner and manager in baseball. Ivory
said, "I don't want to know."
"Maybe you should cover your eyes when
we reach the lobby," I suggested.
He took off his glasses instead.
Alejandro and I made quick work of the
paint spill — fortunately, it was water-based.
No one, except Ivory, the security guard and
a handful of preoccupied passersby. noticed.
Or so I thought. When I got to work the
next morning, Nikki, the stage manager.


Sean Howell
asked me if I could do her a favor.
"Sure," I replied. "What?"
"Get me a five-gallon can of
paint!"
I'm not sure what tipped me off.
Probably the fact that she was bent
over gasping for air halfway through
her sentence, choking on her own
laughter.
But I had a feeling that they were
on to me.
My premonition was confirmed
15 seconds later when another co
worker asked if I'd seen "the video."
"What video?"
I had been caught, red-(actually,
grey-)handed, by the security cam
eras. She informed me that Charles,
the man who hired me, had saved
that section of footage and put it on
the server so that anyone visiting the
website could have a look.
1 don't think my face lost its crim
son tint for the rest of that day. Peo
ple I had never met before grinned
slyly and told me — by name — that
they had some painting for me to do.
More than once, 1 overheard co
workers talking about the incident.
"He just stood there?"
"Yeah! Then he took off his
shoes!"
"Weird. Then what happened?"
People snickered behind my back
when they saw me painting a wall on
the first floor that afternoon.

"Instead of WET PAINT, that
sign should say, SEAN USING
WET PAINT," one joker cracked.
In a better, more peaceful world
— a world before security cameras
— the whole mess would have been
over and done with in five minutes.
But in this age of technology, the
video of my goof was passed around
the office as rapidly as needles are
passed around a clubhouse.
Which is all by way of saying: I
feel ya, Mr. Palmeiro. Just like you, I
tried to cover up my mistake, but it
leaked out like a ... well, like paint
spilling out of a can. I know how it
feels to be caught, helpless to stop
the media (Charles) from spreading
the news all over the Internet (office
Web site).
When I tried to explain myself,
people told me that video cameras
don't lie.
"But it was an accident!" I would
say. "An accident!"
Some have claimed that drug tests
don't lie. This may be true. But 1 be
lieve you, Raffy, when you say that
you didn't knowingly ingest (inject?)
the potent steroid found in your
blood. 1 agree wholeheartedly with
what your old pal Mike Mussina said:
"The question is: How did he get it?
What did it come in? Do you know
everything that you take in? I think
we can control it to a point."
Thank you, Mike. I guess your
Stanford diploma came in handy
after all. So what if the drug found in
your system can only be found in
dark alleys and the offices of shady
physicians? You can't be expected to

analyze the contents of every drug a
teammate hands you.
You can't expect a finely-tuned,
nutrition-conscious ballplayer like
yourself to monitor everything that
goes into your diet. I'm sure you have
someone who does that for you.
Probably an ambitious trainer who
would have been in line fora nice lit
tle bonus around the same time that
you, Mr. Palmeiro, were to receive
your well-deserved Hall-of-Fame
plaque after joining the ranks of
Henry Aaron, Willie Mays and your
former teammate Eddie Murray as
the only players ever to collect 3,000
hits and 500 homers. Sadly enough,
even your claim to that plaque is now
shaky.
Fact is, it's tough being a baseball
player these days. All that testifying
can tire a guy out. Look at your poor
buddy Jason Giambi who called a
press conference to apologize after
someone leaked his secret Grand
Jury testimony in the BALCO case
when he had fessed up to using 'roids.
Giambi was so flustered he didn't
even say what he was apologizing for!
Oh, yeah, Raffy. Speaking of tes
timony: there is the slight issue of
that speech you gave to Congress
less than five months ago. Remem
ber? You denounced Jose Canseco
for revealing that he and some of his
teammates, including yourself, used
steroids. He went as far as saying
that he personally injected them
into you with a needle. Tears of
pride welled up in my eyes when
you put your finger in the air and
said, under oath: "I have never used

steroids. Period."
If you are prosecuted, it will be be
cause a bunch of no-good congress
men overstepped their bounds. As
Tom Davis (R-Va.), one of two House
members who is looking into your
case, said: "If we did nothing, I think
we'd look like idiots, don't you?"
You've got to be kidding me.
MLB has done nothing to stop
steroid use for going on two decades
now, and Mr. Davis thinks that he, of
all people, will look like an idiot? In
stead of prosecuting, Mr. Davis
should take a cue from the governors
of the sport — and from my boss —
and close his eyes!
Because even if you did intentional
ly use steroids — not to jump to unrea
sonable conclusions — the fact of the
matter is, you couldn't help it. How are
you supposed to compete with these
younger, freakishly ripped guys if
you're not doped up too? I'll tell you
what's idiotic: th.it Major League
Baseball thinks it can mandate players
for whom steroid use is a way of life to
stop using them cold-turkey.
When MLB banned the spitball in
1920, each club was allowed to
"grandfather" two players who re
lied heavily on the pitch so that they
could continue to use the one ele
ment of their game that allowed
them to stay competitive. How about
grandfathering players like you, who
may or may not be clinging on to
their fading careers only by the tip of
their needles? (You don't have to an
swer that, Mr. Palmeiro. But if you
think the Grandfather Clause is a
good idea, just nod your head slight

ly during your first at-bat in your first
game back tomorrow against the
Blue Jays, and I'll look into it).
As social psychologists love to
say: It's not your fault, Raffy. It's the
Power of the Situation. The players
have to juice to keep up, but they
earn the scorn of the fans if they get
caught. It's a Catch-22. MLB has
failed to recognize that, like my paint
spill, steroid use is inevitable.
But hey, Raf, at least your col
leagues are still on your side.
"I look at Raffy and I don't see a
big-muscle guy who looks like he's
on steroids — all I see is that sweet
swing," quoth your former Rangers
teammate, Ruben "1 have a neck the
size of a canned ham" Sierra.
Until recently, that's all the fans
saw, too. Then dark secrets of your
trade — which, not unlike the Wiz
ard of Oz, should always be kept be
hind a thick red curtain, or at least in
side clubhouse walls — seeped out.
You should know, Raffy, that
when you return from your suspen
sion tomorrow, there will be ques
tions. There will be doubts about
your gaudy numbers. Holes will be
poked in your Hall of Fame creden
tials, which seemed bulletproof as re
cently as 10 days ago. Your home
town fans might even turn on you.
the man they once saw as a rock in a
turbulent sea filled with Cansecos.
He of the sweet swing. The face of
the franchise.
You don't want that.
My advice, Mr. Palmeiro?
Make like Barry Bonds.
And don't come back.
