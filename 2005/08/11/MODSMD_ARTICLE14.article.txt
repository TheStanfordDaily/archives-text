# I know how it feels to be Raffy—really

Dear Mr. Palmeiro,
When I heard the news about your posi
tive test for the powerful steroid Stanozolol, 1
was crushed.
At first.
You have always been honest about the
(ahem) "performance-enhancing" drugs you

use. Your endorsements
have allowed middle-aged
men everywhere to feel
comfortable with the
(cough) flabbiness of their
muscles, secure with the
knowledge that you were in
their company. But since
your test results became
public, I have begun to
wonder if it was the side-

effects of steroids, not old age, which led you
to become the spokesman for Viagra.
Since the events of last Tuesday, however,
when I found myself in a similarly sticky situ
ation, I have come to empathize with your
predicament.
It was at the end of a long day of painting
in the hot Southern California sun at my job
at a studio in Los Angeles. I was waiting for an
elevator in the lobby of a 12-story office
building so that I could take my paint cart
downstairs and call it a day.
But as I went to pull the cart into the ele
vator, the front left wheel got stuck in a crack.
The paint can toppled over, the lid slid off,
and a thick layer of grey #16 spilled over the
lobby's shiny tile floor.
And what did I do?
1 just stood there, dumfounded and mo
tionless, unsure of what to do. For about a
minute, as the security tapes later revealed. I
stood still as the paint crept around my an
kles, much as your detractors claim that you
stayed the course, continuing to use steroids
as the doping scandal enveloped your sport
this past winter.
The woman behind the front desk saw
the paint and asked if 1 wanted her to call
my boss.
"No," 1 told her, the gears in my head turn
ing. "Call janitorial." It was the perfect plan:
get Alejandro, the janitor, over here to help
me clean up the mess. Lay down wads of
paper towels, spray it clean, and pretend like
it never happened. No one would ever know.
It was going really well until Ivory, my
boss, got on the elevator with Alejandro and
1 while we were returning from a trip to get
cleaning supplies. Our arms were filled with
strips of cardboard that we had ripped from
boxes to sweep up the paint.
Ivory looked at my bare feet.
He looked at the cardboard.
And he shook his head, probably wonder
ing if I had been ingesting heavy drugs, simi
lar to the ones that Bud Selig claims you have
been, um, experimenting with.
Then, taking a page from the book ol
every owner and manager in baseball. Ivory
said, "I don't want to know."
"Maybe you should cover your eyes when
we reach the lobby," I suggested.
He took off his glasses instead.
Alejandro and I made quick work of the
paint spill — fortunately, it was water-based.
No one, except Ivory, the security guard and
a handful of preoccupied passersby. noticed.
Or so I thought. When I got to work the
next morning, Nikki, the stage manager.
