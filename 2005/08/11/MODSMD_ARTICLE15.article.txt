## Hoops duo makes Wooden Preseason List, Six head to track and field Worlds 
### 
Rising Stanford seniors Chris Hernandez
and Dan Grunfeld were named to the
Wooden Award Preseason List along with
48 other collegiate stars. The John R. Wood
en Award is presented every year to the top
player in NCAA Basketball, and the Presea
son List is based on performance from the
previous year.
Hernandez was a finalist for the Bob
Cousy Award-given to the top point guard in
the country-in 2005, and led the Cardinal in
shots made from behind the arc (65). He was
an All-District 14 selection and a first-team
All-Pacific-lOchoice. Hernandez entered the
2005 draft, but opted out to return for his se
nior year on the Farm.
Grunfeld turned heads as the surprise of
the 2005 Stanford season, leading the team in
scoring (17.9 points per game). Though he
missed the final nine games of the year with
a torn ACL, Grunfeld was also an All-Dis
trict 14 player.
The duo makes Stanford one of only seven
schools to gain two selections to the Wooden
Preseason List. Boston College, Connecticut,
Duke, Michigan State, Texas and Wake For
est each had a pair of players selected.
The list of 50 will be pared down to 30 by
January, and by March the list will shrink to
the 10-man Wooden Award All-American
Team. Duke's JJ Redick and Illinois' Dee
Brown are the only two players on the Pre
season List to have made the 2005 Wooden

All-American squad.
Six Stanford affliates to compete at World
Championships
Rising sophomore Erica McLain's 2005
campaign secured her a place in Stanford's
memory, as she racked up conference cham
pionships in the triple and long jump, all
while picking up school records and national
acclaim. Now the Texas native heads to
Helsinki, Finland in search of a place in the
international spotlight.
The IAAF World Track and Field Cham
pionships will be the temporary home of
McLain and five other Stanford affiliates
this week.
At 19, McLain will be the youngest ath
lete on the American team, and will look to
improve on her record-breaking perfor
mance at the U.S. National Championships
last month.
Alumna Jackie Edwards will be compet
ing in the long jump for her native Bahamas
in her eighth career Championships, and
will be joined by fellow Stanford graduates
Laura Fleshman (5,000 meters), lan Dobson
(5,000 meters) and Olympic silver medalist
Toby Stevenson (pole vault). Redshirt se
nior Ryan Hall will also compete in the 5,000
meter race.
