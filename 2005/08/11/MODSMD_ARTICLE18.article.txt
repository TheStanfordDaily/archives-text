# Linklater's remake puts charming spin on original
## Sweet tooth in this foul mouth 
### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER T-BALL COACH 
Richard Linklater is America's Anto
nioni. His 1991 breakthrough "Slacker" was
a watershed moment in the independent film
movement. A decade later, he revisited that
film's loose structure and took it to transcen
dent heights with the staggeringly unique

"Waking Life." At the same time, he has
carved out a reputation as an unlikely suc
cessor to Michael Ritchie ("Semi-Tough,"
"Smile"), crafting memorable, good-hearted
mainstream comedies like "Dazed and Con
fused" and "School Of Rock." His newest
movie is a remake of Ritchie's greatest com
mercial success, "Bad News Bears," and it
captures all the shockingly profane charm of
its predecessor.
The movie is, of course, about a washed
up former minor leaguer (Billy Bob Thorn
ton here, Walter Matthau in the original) who
takes a little league coaching gig for the cash
and gets saddled with a roster of kids with
baseball skills roughly comparable to my own
(that is none whatsoever). Eventually he
turns them into a great team, partly because
all the post-loss pouting gets to him, but
mostly because he hates his egomaniac yup
pie arch nemesis (Greg Kinnear) so much.
Linklater's remake is not so much loyal to
the first film as it is loyal to every sports
movie ever made — early humiliation leads
to a miracle season during which the under
dogs make it to the one big game against a
team of young Aryans, and everything comes
down to a final risky play. But it would be
silly to fault a PG-13 comedy for narrative
conventionality when the real goal is to load
up a familiar template with as much fun as
possible, especially when the movie in ques
tion is as light and refreshing as a summer
breeze.
As in "School Of Rock," Linklater employs
a flawless cast of regular kids (no showy Dako
ta Fannings or Haley Joel Osments here) who
just happen to be absolutely hilarious. The
laughs couldn't be less complex; your enjoy
ment level here is directly related to how
funny you think it is to see a chubby 10-year
old yell profanities.
In fact, the only departure from the 1976

original is that Ritchie's child actors were ex
tremely animated while Linklater keeps
these kids as realistic as possible. This is most
obvious in his treatment of star pitcher
Amanda Whurlitzer. In the first movie,
Tatum O'Neal stuck to the adorable loud
mouth routine she perfected in "Paper
Moon" a year earlier. Real-life baseball
prodigy Sammi Kane Kraft's Amanda is
much different — shy. quiet, unsure of her
self. Linklater's film rarely veers into cheap
sentimentality, but it has a lot of heart pre
cisely because of its honest portrayals of kids
entering adolescence.
Thornton is great in the Matthau role, and
while it would be easy to tag his Morris But
termaker as "Bad Santa"-lite, there are key
differences — namely that "Bad Santa" was
about creating laughs out of sheer depravity
whereas "Bad New Bears" is a sweet movie
starring foul-mouthed children.
Buttermaker may be an alcoholic, but he
never gets drunk enough to piss his pants, and
he actually has advice to impart to his young
proteges. When one player doesn't want to
tell his stern father that he lost a game. But
termaker tells him, "Lie your ass off," and
then gives examples from his own life, such as,
"1 didn't steal your stereo," "I don't smoke"
and "She looked 18."
It's a shame that the movie has mostly
gone unnoticed, opening just a week after this
summer's only major hits ("The Wedding
Crashers" and fellow '70s remake "Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory"). Its inability to
connect with an audience is most likely due to
bad planning on the part of the studio — its
sprightly humor would probably play better
in early May than in the punishing dog days of
late summer.
