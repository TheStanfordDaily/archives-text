# 'Dukes' crashes, not worth a look

### HUGO GOMEZ CONTRIBUTING DAISY DUKE SPECIALIST 
Every few years the film industry sends out an
artistic triumph for the entire world to see. If
"The Dukes of Hazzard" is any indication of the
direction the mainstream industry is heading, it
looks like we'll be waiting for that rare gem fora
long, long, long time.

Movie review
Dukes of Hazzard r 7 y
Directed by

The stink of hillbilly grit isn't ambiguous in
the latest of this summer's line of remakes and /
or adaptations. After all, what can one expect
from director Jay Chandrasekhar (oh, don't tell
us you've forgotten about his cinematic pinnacle
"Super Troopers") and writer John O'Brien
("Starsky and Hutch")?
Seann William Scott plays Bo Duke, partner
in-crime and cousin to Johnny Knoxville's "I got
shotgun!" Luke Duke. The boys flex their thes

pian muscles — wincing, yelling, hollering,
punching and picking up chicks. Their perfor
mances are about three trillion light years shy of
being anything close to remotely good.
Luckily, Jessica Simpson, playing Daisy
Duke, muffles Scott and Knoxville's sub-par ex
ecution. No, wait, she doesn't. Simpson might
even claim an award for the Worst Performance
Ever by Any Actor in Any Film Ever Made (pre
vious title held by Rosie O'Donnell playing her
self in "Riding on the Bus with My Sister").
Shakin' ass and showing off her never-melting
milkshake, Simpson has lowered herself into the
realm of B-listdom.
Needless to say, the plot is nothing to write
home about — Boss Hogg (Burt freaking
Reynolds) is a local official who plans to seize a
bunch of property in the county to put together
a strip mine. He crosses the line when he seizes
the Duke farm, igniting the Dukes' furious tem
pers, and forcing them to take their car over
ridiculous, yet not all that amusingly high jump.
Essentially, "Dukes" is nothing more than a pa
rade of red state stereotypes. For moonshine's
sake, Willie Nelson got the gig as Uncle Jesse.
In this period of awkward unoriginality, the
least "Dukes" could have done was accentuate
the social impact of Daisy Duke shorts. Never has
a character's name been synonymous with an ar-

tide of clothing. Daisy Dukes are far more than
three inches of cloth — they are a way of life.
For now, I think that perhaps the car wreck of
a movie that ensued before my eyes was there for
a reason. Perhaps this is all a conspiracy to en
lighten the American public about how our taste
as a people has gone sour. Call me an idealist, but
I think 1 may be onto something.
To boil it down for you, this movie is nothing
but NASCAR humor, Stifler with a southern ac
cent, Knoxville without the lubricated toy race
car and MTV's The Newlyweds sans the tolera
ble Nick Lachey. In short, if you like feeling stu
pid, maybe this is the movie for you.
