# Penguin sex?
## None for me, thanks 
### JOSHUA STERN PANDA SYMPATHIZER 
The entertainment industry is
conspiring against you. They all want
you to go see "March of the Pen
guins." Do not listen to them. Your
$8 and two hours deserve to be spent
elsewhere. This movie is painfully
boring. '"But Josh," you may be
thinking, "penguins are so cute!"
You are right, penguins are cute ...
but they definitely aren't after you
watch them getting it on.
Don't get me wrong, 1 really
wanted to like "March of the Pen
guins." It's a detailed documentary
tracking the struggle of a flock of the
adorable birds throughout a harsh
Antarctic winter, and with some
truly breathtaking imagery, there is a
lot to like about it. There's also a
whole lot to not like about it, and the
slew of fantastic reviews across all
major media outlets seem to gloss
over just how incredibly boring and
simple the movie ends up being.
The film's sole message is that
penguins are sort of like humans.
They love each other, are capable of
great feats and experience both loss
and joy. The film relies on the hope
that we'll be continually impressed
by this, over and over again. Well
sure, it is impressive, but with no real
plot or individual characters to speak
of, the movie can only sustain one's

interest for so long. I'd be lying if 1
said 1 wasn't tempted throughout the
movie by the promises of sweet free
dom the exit sign offered in the re
flection of my glasses. Heck, the guy
next to me passed out cold about 30
minutes into the thing, and he'd
spent those first 30 minutes pound
ing three Pepsis. No bueno.
For most of the film, the penguins
saunter around their breeding
ground while Morgan Freeman talks
about how amazing they are. The
courting rituals of the penguins pro
vide rare moments of humor, but the
amusement you feel will be immedi
ately replaced with horror as the cute

flirting turns into full blown, hard
core penguin coitus. The little kid in
front of me — who promptly started
crying and begging his mother to
leave — had the right idea.
The penguin lifestyle is not with
out conflict, however. They face
storms, a hungry seal and starva
tion, but none of these struggles is
particularly moving. Maybe it's be
cause the birds aren't that adept at
conveying emotion, what with being
birds and all. You have no idea just
how much 1 yearned fora stray
polar bear to come romping along
and wreak some havoc, just to spice
things up a bit.
The film's mam flaw is that it
takes itself way too seriously. For its
duration, it tries to instill a sense of
awe. Maybe I'm just cynical, but it's
hard for me to sustain a sense of awe
for 90 minutes. If the narration had
been even slightly witty, it would
have made a huge difference. The
whole thing just feels like some biol
ogy movie a middle school teacher
would throw on for "fun day,"and
you all remember just how fun "fun
days" were.
"March of the Penguins" would be
better suited as a PBS special. Not even
Animal Planet would pick this one up
— at least their shows are funnv.
