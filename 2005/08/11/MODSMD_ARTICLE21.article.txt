# 'Sherit' takes digital 3-D form
## Scans model mummy 
### RICARDO GILB STAFF WRITER 
Ancient Egyptians dreamed that
they could preserve life by preserv
ing the dead. Thousands of years
later, a collaboration between a San
Jose museum, the Stanford Medical
School, and the Mountainview
based Silicon Graphics Company, or
SGI, has helped that dream become
a digital reality.
A female Egyptian inufhmy has
just been resurrected in the form of
a computerized three-dimensional
model. The girl has been named
Sherit, Egyptian for "little girl."
Scientists have been able to peer
through her casing and understand a
little bit about her life. They have
learned that Sherit was about about
five years old, could walk normally,
and most likely died of some kind of
intestinal disease.
"[This] brings to life the story of
this little girl who lived at a time
when Egyptians, Romans, Jews and
Christians all lived side by side,"
said Linda Schwappach-Shirriff,
curator of San Jose's Rosicrucian
Museum. "This mummy is no longer
just a fascinating artifact, but a live

ly young child who lived many ages
ago."
The three dimensional model of
Sherit was made by combing 60,000
two-dimensional CT scans of a
2,000 year old mummy, all collected
at Stanford. Half of these scans
were traditional CT scans, while
the other half were done using
Stanford's new AXIOM Siemens
scanner, which is one of only five
CT scanners in the world that can
operate at a resolution high enough
to conduct the project.
Such scans produce massive
amounts of raw data — this set of
scans contained 92 gigabytes of
information — that needs to be
processed before it can be useful.
SGI provided the processing power
—24 processors, to be exact —
needed to convert this data into the
three-dimensional model.
Sherit had spent the last 75 years
sitting quietly in the Rosicrucian,
which houses a large collection of
Egyptian artifacts. Her body was
encased in "cartonnage," a type of
plaster made from papyrus, but
almost nothing was known about
her. Workers at the Rosicrucian
guessed that she was young, but

nothing — not even her sex — was
certain. The Museum deemed that
further investigation was needed.
The collaboration began when
the Rosicrucian approached SGI
about scanning their mummy. SGI
had previously collaborated with
the British Museum to scan the
body of an Egyptian priest, and had

unveiled the scans simultaneously
in Britain and in San Jose. SGI was
not immediately interested, but
eventual project leader Afshad
Mistri saw an opportunity to collab
orate with Stanford, using their new
high powered scanner.
According to Caroline Japic of
SGI, it was an opportunity for both

SGI and Stanford to see what could
be done with the medical school's
new technology.
Both Sherit and the SGI comput
er model will be on display at the
Rosicrucian until Sept. 5.
