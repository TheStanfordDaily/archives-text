## 13,000 feet below sea level Hole drilled in San Andreas 
### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
On Aug. 9, investigators from the San Andreas
Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) successfully
completed drilling into the San Andreas fault zone,
reaching a depth of 13,082 feet below sea level. The
completion of the hole marks the first time geologists
have drilled into the fault.
"We are finished with drilling the hole, and we are
about to start geophysical measurements in the hole that
will tell us the physical properties of the fault at depth,
which is one of the main objectives of the experiment,"
said Mark Zoback, a geophysics professor and a leader
of the project. "We want to understand the conditions
under which earthquakes actually occur."
The SAFOD project, led by Zoback and his col
leagues Bill Ellsworth and Stephen Hickman at the
government-run U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
started drilling in 2003 after receiving funding from
National Science Foundation. According to Zoback,
the birth of the project would not have been possible
without organized efforts by a team of scientists who
were determined to address many unanswered ques
tions concerning how earthquakes actually work. Many
scientists believe that a number of questions regarding
earthquakes can be best addressed by data from active
fault zones.
The SAFOD project, which will cost 20 million dol
lars over 5 years, is one of three initiatives of Earthscope,
an initiative designed to explore the geophysical process
es that affect the North American continent. SAFOD
consumes only 10 percent of Earthscope's budget, which
totals $200 million over five years.
According to Zoback, the fundamental scientific
objectives of this drilling of SAFOD lie not in predicting
earthquakes, but in advancing the understanding of how
earthquakes work.
"Predicting earthquakes is something we don't know
how to do and we don't even know if it's possible,"
Zoback said. He stressed that testing whether or not they
are predictable is only one of the objectives of the project.

"The research we arc trying to do is very fundamen
tal; the better we understand how earthquakes work, the
better we could model them and predict their effects so
we can be better prepared," he added.
The successful completion of drilling into the active
fault zone provides a significant operational foundation
for achieving these scientific objectives. Zoback told The
Daily that the drilling of the hole enables scientific
research that includes "determining the conditions in
which earthquakes occur, retrieving samples from the
actual material from the fault zone to see how they have
been altered and chanced over time, and building an
[earthquake] observatory directly withir the fault zone."
"What we really succeeded in doing is opening the
door to decades of research that the project will make
available," he said.
"The breakthrough is sort of yet to come," Zoback
concluded. "Operationally, we succeeded in drilling the
hole, and the breakthrough is going to come through
from the science in the next few weeks, years, or
decades. There's a lot of hard work ahead of us."
