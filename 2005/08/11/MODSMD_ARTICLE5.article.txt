# Profs show kids joy of learning
## Group helps youths 'pimp' golf cart 
### ANNA KHAN 
A Stanford student group, TUTOR 24, has brought a
number of underprivileged children between the ages of
nine and 13 to campus to learn about science from the
Stanford community.
TUTOR 24, in conjunction with Teen Technology
Learning, has designed a summer program that matches
a group of mentors with underprivileged students from
East Palo Alto.
"We dedicated our summer to helping the students
realize their dreams and see the possibility of becoming
professionals," said Sam Alemayehu, a member of
TUTOR24\s executive council.
The 13 children that were selected for the summer pro
gram had to go through an application process, writing
about their passions in the world of science. The partici-
pants have spent four weeks at
Stanford learning from Stanford
Profs. Godfrey Mungal, Reginald
Mitchell, Brigid Barron, Doug
Osheroff, Chris Gerdis and others.
According to Alemayehu, the
children's main project consists of
being able to transform an old golf
cart into a bio-diesel and solar elec
tric car.
"Inspired by the popular TV

show PIMP-MY-RIDE the Golf
Cart Project attempts to "pimp" a
beat up Golf Cart while teaching stu
dents about basic science skills and
attracting them to Engineering
fields," he said. "Students have been
working four days a week from the
planning and research stage to the
simulation and implementation
stage... The projects each have a
detailed curriculum and are designed
to encourage students to apply class
room math, science and writing skills
to a rather fun project."
On Friday, Aug. 5, Nobel
Laureate and Physics Prof. Doug
Osheroff gave the program partici

pants the opportunity to observe
physics at its wildest. The lecture was
dubbed, "Physics Phur Phun," and
was designed to enable the children to
exercise the creative side of science.
Osheroff demonstrated phenom
ena such as the transfer of electrical
energy through shocks and the expo
sure of liquid nitrogen to make his
lecture more interesting to young
children.
"It is wonderful to see an idea
being acted out," said Bowen Jiang, a
member of TUTOR 24. "There are
so many summer programs offered at
Stanford, but they cost money and
kids from low-income families are

not able to afford them. It does not
mean that they are less qualified — it
only means that they do not have
opportunity. TUTOR 24 is building a
toolkit for the community and exer
cising project-based learning."
Jiang added that the organization
has developed a sturdy relationship
with each of the 13 kids and hopes to
spread the idea to different colleges.
"Our organization wants to spread
the basis of American learning,"
Jiang said. "America stresses free
dom of thought and I want these chil
dren to ask: Why? How? What if?
Once they become eager to learn, the
world is at their fingertips."
