# Scientists investigate new cancer treatment

A research group at Stanford
has discovered a new laser treat
ment that eradicates cancer cells
without causing damage to
healthy cells.
"The treatment provides a new
type of radiation therapy, to treat
various types of cancer that is
based on a near infrared light
which is harmless to normal tis
sue," said graduate student
Nadine Wong Shi Kam, the
study's principal experimentalist.
"It will potentially open up a new
way of treating cancer."
The study was published in the
Aug. 1 online edition of "The
Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences." The
researchers have applied fora
patent at the Stanford Office of
Technology Licensing. The group
consists of Chemistry Professor
Hongjie Dai, the lead author of
the study, Wong Shi Kam, former
chemistry postdoctoral fellow
Michael O'Connell and applied
physics graduate student Jeffrey
A. Wisdom.
The treatment involves a new
laser that is used to heat synthetic
nanotubes that can easily fit into a
typical cell. The nanotubes are
implanted in cancerous cells,
which are subsequently destroyed
by the nanotube's heat.
"The most exciting aspect of
the new laser treatment is the
fact that the laser used is a diode
laser, which is one of the cheap
est and most reliable lasers avail
able," Wisdom said. "It is not

something which relies on lots of
technical might. It has no limits
in terms of the optical compo
nents."
Holistically, the specific pro
ject was a year's worth of work.
However, the research invested in
the project had been in progress
for more than a year. According
to Dai, the researchers were try
ing to make use of two factors:
normal tissues are very transpar
ent and thus are not inflicted with
any harm near infrared light,
while the nano material used in
the laser treatment absorbs
infrared light readily.
According to Dai, laser treat
ment is more selective then wide
ly used chemotherapy.
"Chemotherapy is not selec
tive, which means it damages
healthy as well as cancerous tis
sues," she said. "Chemotherapy
uses x-rays with highly energetic
photons. Our treatment uses
lasers, which have been found
to eliminate the damage in nor
mal cells."
Wisdom added that the laser
treatment must be tested on ani
mals before it can be tested on
humans.
The research is relatively new
and thus will take time to develop
into a treatment that can be used
for cancer patients around the
world, according to those
involved. The laser method has
not been tested on humans, a key
and lengthy obstacle in the way of
its success as a cancer remedy.
The cost of the treatment is also
unknown, the researchers said.
