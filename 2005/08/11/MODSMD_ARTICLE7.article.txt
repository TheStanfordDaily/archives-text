### LAUREN OTERO 
Students involved in Stanford's Summer
in Washington Program, hosted by Stanford
in Government, or SIG, have packed their
calendars with political events.
Rising senior Shirin Sharif, this year's
education program coordinator for the
Summer in Washington program, has
organized several events headlined by
local big names. Program attendees have
heard from the likes of Congressmen F.
James Sensenbrenner, Jim Kolbe and
Congresswoman Judy Biggert, as well as
the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget Josh Bolten.
Another event at the White House
Executive Office Building with the
National Economic Council Deputy
Director Keith Hennessey, drew a consid
erably larger crowd because of the prestige
of the location and its speaker. White
House Chief of Staff Andy Card surprised
students when he stumbled upon the group

as they waited for Hennessey. He casually
proceeded to discuss public policy, demon
strating that running into major figures like
Card is just one of the perks of living at the
hub of government and politics.
The Summer in Washington Program,
arranges educational, cultural and social
activities fora network of over 190 stu
dents and alums staying in the D.C. area.
The program operates out of the Bass
Center, Stanford's house in D.C. which has
become a central meeting place for social
gatherings and speaker events. Twenty-eight
students currently live at the Stanford house,
mostly SIG fellows and past Stanford in
Washington program participants. These
students are a small part of the larger
Summer in Washington network, which uses
an e-mail list and online calendar to allow
Stanford students and graduates to keep in
touch and stay updated with one another.
Sharif spent last summer in D.C. as a
SIG fellow and studied there in the fall.
Now familiar with the area, she plans week

ly events and schedules speakers to present
at the Stanford house. She also coordinates
sightseeing trips and weekly happy hours.
Less formal activities, such as museum
visits, nighttime concerts and the occa
sional house party also keep students
entertained while staying in the nation's
capital. The online calendar informs stu
dents in the area of free events such as the
Jazz concert held at the National Gallery
of Art Sculpture Garden or the tour of the
National Air and Space Museum led by a
Stanford graduate.
According to Sharif, the Summer in
Washington program is not unique to
Stanford. Most major universities have a
similar program, allowing individual pro
gram coordinators to collaborate.
"Another part of the program is stu
dents meeting other students from various
schools, like Yale, Harvard, Penn,
Princeton. Rutgers and Michigan," Sharif
said. "We've had joint happy hours, ice
cream socials, 4th of July events, etc."
