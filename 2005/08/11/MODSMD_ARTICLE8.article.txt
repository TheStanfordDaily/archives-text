### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
I've been plotting fora while the penning of
a column on the perils and pleasures, the peaks
and pitfalls of the most important relationships
we have: the one with our advisers.
Unfortunately (and. I must confess, a little
surprisingly) such a column has not arrived.

Sorry. I do have an excuse
though. Fear.
Although I (like all good
rogue scientists) am normally
fearless in face of danger, one
can't help but feel the need to
tread carefully around the
delicate issue of faculty.
I have a sneaking suspi
cion that, as well as holding
the power of the Kings of

Old, advisers may also have the capacity to
reach regal levels of capriciousness.
With such thoughts flitting around my little
mind, I thought it best to wait until 1 had a deli
cate approach laid out for this touchy subject.
Now, after months of thought, I think I'm set to
treat the issue with an appropriate amount of
respect.
So what is the spirit of the bind between
graduate student and professor?
How best to convey the fragile and numerous
connections?
Frankly, capturing the essence of a rela
tionship with just a word or two is never an
easy thing. Nor, for that matter, is one ever
likely to be right.
However, as we all learned in Academic Life
101, you don't need to be right in order to pub
lish — you just need a little imagination.
My first thought was to cast us as hookers
and the profs as johns. After all, one's services
are definitely purchased. And at least a small
degree of slavish devotion is expected. And
they pay extra for oral. (That was a joke).
In reality, though, the sex-worker analogy
doesn't really hold up. Fora start, we command
a far lower hourly rate. And the amount of de
viant criminal behavior among senior faculty is
not nearly so high as in the world of prostitution.
More seriously, one doubts that (despite
what the odd pomographer would have you be
lieve) the typical prostitute chooses her (or his)

career out of love for the work. We don't have
that excuse.
Several other possibilities have occurred to
me: Master and slave, landlord and serf, prison
guard and prisoner and so on. These all, howev
er. suffer from the problem that the lesser party
doesn't generally volunteer (unless we're talk
ing about an altogether different sort of master
and slave).
With that in mind, how about witches and
their familiars? After all, your adviser often has
supernatural powers, an evil cackle and a pen
chant for arcane ritual.
Plus, there is something a little pet-like in the
behavior of the average advisee. We seek ap
proval. will run around for even the slightest
hint of a treat and (after months of training) can
perform simple tricks.
If that doesn't work for you. how about sol
dier and commander? 1 like this one. There's
the professor as the stern, imperious military
type and you as the earnest grunt. While they
plan strategy for full-scale assaults on the tran
sition temperatures of cobalt superconduc
tors, you're hard at work in the trenches draw
ing graphs.
In an ideal world (and probably in the minds
of prospective students) the appropriate com
parison would be with apprenticeships. One is,
after all, learning a trade from a master. And,
after graduation, you will go on to teach others
and ensure that the circle of life keeps turning
(or something like that).
The problem with this somewhat pastoral
view is that it's not true. Not only is drudgery
more common than the thrill of learning or
the moments of headstrong rebellion, but the
easy camaraderie of Jedi and Padawan is
rarely present.
I suppose that each of us would want an ad
viser who is as much a friend as a boss, and per
haps it's best to dream of the perfect bond.
Looking around, though, I suspect that very few
of us have such a relationship handed to us.
Which means, I guess, we have one more thing
to work on.

On the off chance that any past, current or fu
ture advisers are reading this, I want you all to
know that I think you're wonderful. E-mail
navins@stanford.edu if you have nothing bet
ter to do.
