On Thursday, July 14, 2005, Mark Ira Weinberger died peacefully in San Francisco, after a four
year struggle with leukemia. He was fifty-seven.
Mark was born in Oakland in 1948 and spent his early years in Palo Alto. He graduated Stanford
University in 1970, where he was Editor in Chief of the Stanford Daily. He went on to earn his law
degree from Harvard University in 1974 and thereafter played a pivotal role in the emerging field
of California environmental law.
For thirty years, Mark practiced environmental and land use law, initially as an attorney in the
California Attorney General's environmental unit where he focused on coastal protection and log
ging regulation.
In 1980, Mark joined with two other attorneys in the Attorney General's office to found Shute
Mihaly & Weinberger LLP a law firm that represents community groups and government agencies
in land use and environmental matters. The firm has since thrived; it now has over 20 attorneys
and is recognized as one of the leading land use and environmental firms in the state. Mark
attended the firm's 25th anniversary celebration earlier this year.
Mark was devoted to his law firm and he continued his law practice throughout the course of his
illness. He was a brilliant litigator, winning many groundbreaking environmental cases. In later
years, he skillfully negotiated a number of complex land use disputes, and developed innovative
strategies for preserving open space and protecting environmental values.
Mark is survived by his son Adam Weinberger; his life partner, Tamara Galanter; his mother,
Marion Weinberger-Greenberg (who worked at the Stanford School of Medicine Department of
Ophthalmology for more than 25 years) and stepfather, Bernard Greenberg; his sister, Kathy
Weinberger (72), brother- in- law Jim Friedlander, and niece Rachael Friedlander; his former wife
and mother of Adam, Susan Cohen Rodriguez ('70); and many friends and associates. He is pre
ceded in death by his father, Edward Weinberger (MBA '40).
In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations in Mark's memory to the Greenbelt Alliance, 631
Howard Street, Suite 510, San Francisco, CA 94105 (www.greenbelt.org), the California Wilderness
Coalition, 1212 Broadway, Suite 1700, Oakland, California 94612 (www.calwild.org), or other envi
ronmental organizations.
