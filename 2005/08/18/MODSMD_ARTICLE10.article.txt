## Fanton becomes Card's sideline hero 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
While the game-winning quarterback may
receive the lion's share of the credit, countless
others contribute to a team's success on the
field. From the unheralded lineman fending
away opposing rushers to the coaching staff
working 80-hour weeks, to the scout team
sweating buckets in practice, it's often those
behind the scenes who determine whether
games end in victory or defeat. Dr. Gary Fan
ton is one such unsung hero.
Eight months ago, Stanford hired Fanton
to head their new orthopedic medical pro
gram at Stanford and launch an outpatient
and surgery practice. As the chief of sports
medicine, Fanton consults and performs or
thopedic surgery upon both Stanford varsity
athletes and members of the community at
large at his on-campus clinic on Welch
Road.
Fanton came to Stanford with over 22 years
of experience working with professional, col
legiate and recreational athletes, including
roles as the team physician for the San Fran
cisco Giants and 49ers. His hire brings a sore
ly needed sports medicine presence to the
Stanford campus, as injured Stanford athletes
and Palo Alto residents formerly had to visit
his Redwood City practice.
As part his of his new role at Stanford, Fan
ton works with four partners to provide sports
medicine coverage for every Stanford team.
Fanton is the head team orthopedist for sever
al Stanford teams, including the sport with far-

and-away the most or
thopedic injuries —
football.
Fanton attends cer
tain practices and all
home games and travels
with the team to every
away game in order to
provide Walt Harris'
squad with on-site med
ical coverage. He is also
responsible for per
forming physicals for
entering freshmen on

the football team and any surgeries players
may require.
While he never wishes ill on Stanford varsi
ty athletes, when injury does strike, Fanton
appreciates that he's working with talented
and dedicated athletes.
"I like this type of patient whose primary
goal is to get better as quickly and successfully
as possible," Fanton said. "It makes my job
more enjoyable to see people run, jump and
excel based on something I've done."
Fanton said one of the most overlooked as
pects of his job is his relationship with coaches
and the athletes themselves, especially when
he has to decide when to clear a player to re
turn to competition.
"Of course every coach wants their athletes
back as quickly as possible," Fanton said. "So
do I. People need to understand that it's as im
portant fora doctor to make calls on the side
line as it is for coaches to make calls on the
field. I've been very blessed to work with

coaches respectful of that decision process."
Fanton anticipates a similarly supportive
attitude from new head football coach Walt
Harris.
"Coach Harris has already opened a great
channel of communication with the sideline
trainers," Fanton said. "He seems to be a very
genuine coach concerned about the welfare of
his athletes."
Fanton arrived at Stanford with experi
ence in diverse environments ranging from
the San Jose ballet to the U.S. Decathlon
team to San Francisco's two major profes
sional teams — the Giants and the 49ers.
While he enjoys the high-profile work he does
as team physician for the San Francisco Gi
ants and 49ers. he doesn't appreciate the
high-strung personalities that professional
athletics often attracts.
"Sometimes at the professional level, you
get into the personality issues with coaches,
owners and agents that you read about in the
newspapers every single day," Fanton said.
"These issues just make carrying out a medical
plan that much more difficult. Everyone's tug
ging you in different directions."
With no such obstacles distracting him
from his craft at Stanford, Fanton has grown
to love the work he does on the Farm.
"My most enjoyable and rewarding level of
sports medicine is on this campus," Fanton
said. "At Stanford, we have great coaches, a
great training staff and a great group of payers
who are smart enough and understand enough
to trust the program. For me, it's as good as it
gets right here."
