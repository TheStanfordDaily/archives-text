# U.S. men, women undefeated
## Smith, Haryasz key at World Games 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
United States dominance in in
ternational hoops is hardly a new
phenomenon, and this summer,
Stanford stars are helping to carry
on the tradition. Redshirt junior
Brooke Smith and rising seniors
Chris Hernandez and Matt Haryasz
are all currently competing for the
United States in the World Univer
sity Games, inching closer to gold by
the day.
Smith and the women's team se
cured a berth to the gold medal
game yesterday with a 118-67 win
over Russia. Smith, a center, con
tributed eight points and five re
bounds in the lopsided victory, while
averaging 7.3 points and 5.0 re
bounds overall.
The U.S. women have been un
stoppable thus far, outscoring op
ponents 603-327 in six straight
wins. The team's margin of victory
ranges from a low of 24 points
(against the Czech Republic on
August 10) to a high of 70 points
(against South Africa the following
day).
Smith and Team USA are guar
anteed at least a silver medal in to

morrow's contest where they will
face Serbia and Montenegro, the
only other undefeated team in the
tournament.
The men's tournament includes
eight groups of competing countries
as opposed to the four women's
groups, so the competition is just get
ting started. Yesterday Haryasz,
Hernandez and Team USA topped
the Czech Republic 87-51 to gain a
spot in the quarterfinals. The U.S.,
which is currently undefeated at the
Games, got scoring help from five
different players in double digits, in
cluding Haryasz's 14.
Haryasz is averaging 8.4 points
per game along with 3.0 rebounds,
and is second on the squad with six
blocks. Hernandez averages 4.4
points per game, while sitting in
third on the team in assists (eight)
and steals (10).
The men have plowed through
five teams already, including a 10-
point win over Germany which was
USA's closest game of the tourna
ment. The squad will face Australia
today, a team that is 2-3 in the
Games. Along with the United
States, Serbia and Montenegro and
Ukraine are the only undefeated
teams remaining in the field.
