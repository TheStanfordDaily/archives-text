# Here's a season you never gave a thought
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS SPORTS COLUMNIST 
The road less traveled doesn't even begin
to describe it. It's one of the most esoteric
sports on the planet, and for the better part of
his life, my brother Stephen has been a com
petitive participant in an arena with less than
S,()CK) people nationwide. My brother is an
equestrian and a damn good one at that. 1
know what you're thinking, because at first 1
did too. How hard can it be to just sit on a
horse and hold on? Oh brother...
Since he was a preteen. he has been com
peting on a regional and national level with
the best of America. When most kids his age
were out partying or going to the mall (or
whatever children are doing these days), he
was giving up his weekends to compete all
over the nation. He rides his horse (Kelecyn
Applause â€” we call him Yogi) six times a
week during "the season," which runs from
March to November. Hell, the only two things
1 ride are the couch and a bet.
Stephen participates in a sport known as
eventing. It's a three-part gig, requiring the
horse and rider to test themselves over a wide
variety of skills throughout the weekend. I
have a working knowledge of two of these
parts (i.e. I can identify an error). The third
one is just beyond me, but we'll come to that
later.
The first of these two is what is called cross
country. The horse and rider simply head out
for some nature jumps. You know the kind,
over logs and streams, occasionally some
brush ... no big deal, right? Yeah, except
these logs are a Volkswagen tall and an ele
phant thick. Imagine Michael Jordan taking
off from the three-point line with Mugsy
Bogues on his back and you got it.
Did I mention that this course stretches for
miles and the horse is basically on a dead
sprint for the entire trip? It's long, grueling
and if you take too long, you're screwed.
Never mind that the horse has to be in good
shape: it's so intense that my brother comes
back out of breath from working so hard. And
I thought sitting was easy...
The second trial is called stadium jumping
and it's similar to cross country. Just as be
fore, the horse and rider have to navigate a
course in a certain amount of time, jumping
things on the way. The difference? These
jumps look like they were designed by the
Mad Hatter on acid.
They are much less "natural" looking,
painted crazy colors and topped with flowers,
plastic flamingos, windmills, anything you can
thing of to distract a horse. It's like a putt-putt
course crossed with a roller coaster, only
you're in command of the car. And this time,
the jumps can and will fall apart if you don't
clear them. This can lead to your penalization
and eventual disqualification, should you be
unable to finish the Wonderland of fun in a
timely or crisp fashion.
OK, these two I get. You sit, you jump...at
least I know what's going on. As for the last
part, it's all Greek to me. The final leg of this
trifecta is called dressage. Best I can figure,
it's ballet on horseback.
The horse and rider enter an arena just like
the one in stadium jumping. The horse is
groomed and braided handsomely and
Stephen looks like the butler from Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air. The duo makes its way to
