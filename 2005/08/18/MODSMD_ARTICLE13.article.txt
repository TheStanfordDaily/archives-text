## Track and cross country rebuilding moving swiftly 
### 
The reorganization process con
tinues for the Cardinal track and
cross country programs. Last
month, Dena Evans resigned as the
head coach of the women's team to
spend more time with her family.
Last week, men's head coach An
drew Gerard left the Farm to as
sume a position at the helm of the
track and field team at George
Mason University.
On Tuesday, the athletic depart

ment took what could be an impor
tant step in rebuilding by appointing
Edrick Floreal to be director of track
and field and cross country. Floreal,
who has spent eight seasons coach
ing at the university — including the
last two as the women's track and
field head — was this season's Pacif
ic- 10 Conference Coach of the Year.
"There is a lot of work to be
done," Floreal said in a press re
lease. "The No. 1 priority is to put a

staff together that will be able to
work together as a unit and develop
the athletes."
One of Floreal's first tasks will
be to hire replacements for Evans
and Gerard, both of whom poured
boundless energy into furthering
the distance running tradition at
Stanford. The duo, among other
accomplishments, coached their
respective squads to a pair of na
tional cross country championships
in 2003.
The hiring process is well under
way, as yesterday Floreal named
the new men's and women's cross
country coach, 30-year veteran
Peter Tegen, who was supremely
successful in his role at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin Madison, coach
ing more league champions, nation
al champions and All-Americans
than any other Big-10 coach in the
history of the sport.
"Peter Tegen is one of the most
sought after middle distance and
distance coaches in the country,"
Floreal said. "His ability to devel
op great runners is known
throughout the world. He is a
great coach and person. He relates
to his athletes, and his athletes
love him."
The coach-athlete relationship
is an area of focus in Floreal's plan
for the future of the program. He
mentioned the philosophies of
famed former Cardinal coach Pay
ton Jordan, who believed that a
"family"-feel to a team was crucial
to its success. That belief will likely
play a large role as Floreal contin
ues to build his new coaching staff
and guide the trajectory of Stanford
track and cross country.
Krug nabs first national win
Rising junior Cassidy Krug and
diving partner Nancilea Under
wood of the University of lowa both
won their first national titles at Se
nior Nationals in North Carolina
last week. The duo earned gold in
the synchronized 3-meter spring
board event.
Krug's run did not end there, as
she also managed a bronze medal
solo performance on the 3-meter
springboard, racking up a score of
495.50. Kelci Bryant, a 16-year-old

diving phenom. won that event with
a 495.03 tally.
Wiggins tapped for honors
Rising sophomore Candice Wig
gins was named to a pair of presti
gious watch lists in the past week,
scoring nods from the selection
committees for the Wade Trophy
and the Wooden Award.
Wiggins was in the running for
last season's Wooden Award, gain
ing a nomination at midseason from
the committee. This year, she was
given a spot on the 30-player pre

season list.
The Wade Trophy, which is con
sidered the highest honor in
women's basketball, is named for
legendary coach Lily Margaret
Wade, who led Delta State Univer
sity to three national champi
onships. This award is based not
only on playing ability, but on lead
ership skills, character and overall
effect on the team.
Both awards will be presented
during the Final Four this spring in
Boston.
