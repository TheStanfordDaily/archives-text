# McAdams and Murphy shine despite weak writing
## Plot schmot, 'Red Eye' succeed anyway

'Red Eye." Wes Craven's latest movie, is a
suspense thriller at 32.000 feet. And as a result,
it succeeds in being at least as much fun as an 80-
minute plane ride. The movie begins with our
plucky heroine. Lisa (Rachel Mc Adams), flying
through streets on her way to the airport while
trying to solve a crisis at the hotel she manages
(of course she's on her cell phone). We also get
a montage of various random scenes, such as a
mysterious hidden box being unloaded out of a
crate of frozen fish, which we can only take as a
sign that some serious shit is about to go down.
Inside the terminal, she meets several of her
future plane-mates, including the sharp-eyed
Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), whose
name might as well be a big neon sign on his
forehead that reads "Villain." Everyone is
waiting around because the flight is delayed
and it seems like Craven uses this excuse to
take his sweet time. When they finally take off,
Rippner informs Lisa that she must call her
hotel and arrange for the Secretary of Home
land Security, who is staying there the next day,
to be moved to a different room — or he will
have someone kill her father. It doesn't take
her long to realize that moving the Secretary
would be signing his death warrant. If at this
point you're wondering. "Is that it? Is that all
there is to the plot?" then this movie is proba
bly not for you.
From the moment the plane lifts off the run
way, the movie wastes little time. Craven does
an excellent job of keeping suspense high with
in the limited confines of an airplane cabin, and
he exploits all of the limited avenues for action.
The interplay between the main characters and
the other occupants of the plane provide for
quick and witty breaths of fresh air from the

otherwise tense action between the characters
of McAdams and Murphy.
McAdams shines in the role, appearing real
istically scared of the threat to her father, while
at the same time singularly defiant to the will of

Murphy's character. We can never tell if the
trepidation in her voice is fear, or the masked
defiance of an adder poised to strike. Murphy,
on the other hand, taps into much the same ca
sual creepiness that he honed in his perfor
mance earlier this summer in 'Batman Begins."
Sitting in your seat, it isn't hard to imagine your
self by his side on the plane, or to feel trapped in
his intense, blue-eyed stare. The chemistry be
tween the two is obv ious, like two well-matched
opponents playing a high-stakes game of chess.
Unfortunately, once the plane lands, the
movie also begins to screech to a halt as all the
built-up tension begins to unwind. Like a six
year-old prone to temper tantrums, the movie
becomes increasingly hectic as it escapes the
confines of the cabin. In order to keep it under
control. Craven begins to rely too heavily on
"Scream"-esque horror genre tricks (like the
classic "Girl closes door of the room, but the
killer was hiding behind the door the entire
time" gimmick) so much so that you begin to
wonder if you're even watching the same
movie. While before the duel between
McAdams and Murphy was made out to be just
a piece in a much larger puzzle, we never see
enough of it to really care.
All this isn't to say that the movie isn't enter
taining. In fact, "Red Eye" has enough sheer
thrills to beat most of its box office competition.
And, weighing in at only 80 minutes, you'll be in
and out of the theatre before you can stop to
think. Which is good — because if you do,
you'll inevitably be disappointed. The film is
tight and energetic but in the end. the plot is just
too thin to hold up to much examination. If
you're in the mood for a cheap summer thriller,
"Red Eye" won't disappoint, but if you're look
ing for a movie that will jolt your brain back into
action, you're probably better off flying standby
and sitting this one out.
