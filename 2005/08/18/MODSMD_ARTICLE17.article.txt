# Cops, Craven and Cillian: An interview to remember
## 
### TAM VO WINDOW SEAT DEMANDER 
Intermission writers and editors have had a run
of terrible luck with law enforcement officers in
the past (see "A "Hitch' in our plans" for the last fi
asco). This luck does not change in the Intermis
sion off-season that is summer, when we become
the entertainment section of The Weeklv. So what

would a press junket for Wes Craven's upcoming
release "Red Eye" at the Ritz Carlton in SF be
without cops, you ask? Well, we would have ar
rived on time, without a speeding ticket and with
out a verbal warning for "following too closely at
an unsafe speed."
Wes Craven and the other journalists were al
ready ten or so minutes into their roundtable in
terview. meaning they had stroked his eeo for

about 8 of those minutes and that we didn't miss
t(X) much. Having done my research over the
phone on the way to the city. I felt that we were
well prepared to ask questions completely unrelat
ed to Craven's new film. He wasn't as scary as we
anticipated, with a voice so swthing he should
record books on tape and a distinguished look that
screams. "Law professor." But if he really wants to
leave the horror genre ("Nightmare on Elm
Street" and the "Scream" series) and make suc
cessful romantic comedies and period dramas, as
he told us. he might consider going back to his lull
name. Wesley, and adding a "burg" to the Craven.
On Rachel McAdams [of "Mean Girls,"
"The Notebook" and "Wedding Crashers"]
WES CRAVEN: That role changed names and
genders and ethnic backgrounds all through cast
ing. and then she walked in...and it's like "Okay,
where the hell were you?" This is her first feature
and she's just wonderful. You look at her and
how she does lines and makes up things — it's
just great.
On novel writing
WC: It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.
a lot of the writing happened in between shoot
ing. it's as hard as I push myself. I was a writer all
through high school and college. 1 went to Johns

Hopkins, it's what I originally thought I
was going to do. Years and years later, I
had the opportunity to do it. I've had the
idea for almost 20 years, so the first
chance I got to do it, I grabbed it...lt's
hard. It's something I'd love to do again,
but it'll have to be a time when I have
time. It's fun though because you don't
have any restrictions. With a novel, you
know, you can roam the world, you can
go inside of people's minds.
On upcoming projects
WC: I've got three scripts, a romantic
comedy, a road picture, and a costume
drama, things we've have kind of brought
with us and find that we now own. I
would love to do any of those but I have
no plans to do that right now. I purposely
didn't commit myself to anything else, we
had offers, but I wanted to be free to
enjoy this film, I feel that it's really
g00d,...1 want to be able to do press for it,
I want to be able to see it with friends, just
relax...l've been working fora long time.
"Cursed" was a very long picture, it took
two and a half years, the two films over
lapped, so I'm try ing to take it easy.
ENTERTAINMENT: Do you think
you're trying to do more of that, relax a lit
tle in your career?
WC: Not with movies, but I'd like to try
to be a little kinder to myself, take a va
cation... Also 1 just got married and it
was important to get married in the mid
dle of the shoot, so we haven't had a
honeymoon yet.
On being in film for so long and what
he plans to do in the future
WC: I guess cure cancer. I don't have any
plans. I think I would love to be able to
make comic films, so I'll see what this film
affords me in opportunities.
On finding talent for horror flicks
WC: A lot of actors don't want to be in a
horror film, a lot, so that rules out a lot of
people. Meryl Streep, after she was
working with me, said, "I haven't seen
any of your movies and was afraid that if
I work with you, you'd kill me or some
thing." So I guess that's 90 percent of the
actors and talent I'd like to work with.
Q: Is there an advantage to horror films?
WC: The advantage is that you're often in
a twilight zone where most people don't
go, so with studio execs, they kind of look
at you as a unique person who's crazy, you
must be. with ideas they could never have,
so they kind of leave you alone.
Q: Is that part of the reason that horror di
rectors tend to get pigeonholed?
WC: I think it's a natural human assump
tion that someone who does something re
ally. really scary mast have that all inside,
its a distancing thing, you know, a projec
tion thing. "It can't be me, so it must be
him." And it can be very rigid and confin
ing and then there's just the business fac
tor that your name becomes synonymous
with a certain thing. So even if a studio
exec knows that you can do something
else, they are afraid they won't be able to
sell it if you do something else.
ENTERTAINMENT: You were a pro
fessor at Clarkson college teaching hu
manities. What the do you do with a B.A.
in English these days, and is there hope for
creative writing majors?

WC: I can tell you that the most scarce
commodity in Hollywood is a good
writer. I'm serious — there's an immense
amount of hiring of good writers because
television has just flourished, there's real
ly good shows on, "24" and"The Sopra
nos" and such. There's really neat stuff
being done (like "Six Feet Under") so if
you can actually write, you can do very
well in Hollywood. It's always hard to get
in, you always have to commit to just
being there and being poor and waiting
tables or whatever, and you might get dis
covered in one week or you might get dis
covered in 20 years, but if you're not
ready for that then you should do some
thing else. But writing is great and there
are tons of directors, tons of people who
can order people around but to get a
good script... the Last time I saw a script
as good as "Red Eye" for instance, and I
read a lot of scripts, was "Scream" which
was'%, almost 10 years ago.
On pauses and timing
WC: It's all about timing, there are plenty
of times when you do pause. I find on a
film set that your perception of time like
on a take of how people are speaking and
the energy level is twice as high as every
thing really is...You kind of have to be a
cattle driver sometimes on a film. You
have to be ruthless.
Q: What about "Freddy vs. Jason," "Son
of Freddy," anything? Any plans'?
WC: No. I mean, it's just the nuts and
bolts fact that when I wrote it, it was so
unusual that nobody wanted to do it.
People thought it was stupid or not scary
or whatever. It took 3 years to find the
money, during which I went completely
broke. Unfortunately, in the deal, I
signed over the rights. I don't own Fred
dy Krueger, basically it's something they
own and they exploit however they want.
Q: You shot "Red Eye" in actual airports.
Considering how hard it is to get into an
airport now, how tricky was it?
WC: Heroic work was done by people
who never get credit, like our location
managers. It was relentless, we told them
[the airport security] exactly what we
could do and they could throw us out if
we didn't, we kind of won them over, they
were very cautious and already over
whelmed by the amount of security they
had to crank up. Everything was
searched, they were nervous and hoping
nothing went wrong. The principal air
port was in Ontario, in southern Califor
nia. It was too much to try to watch at the
same time. I think we just got a window
with a script people responded to.
Q: When's a film done, do you have a hard
time letting go? What about editing it so
that it can be cut the best?
WC: Um, no, 1 don't think so. Fellini
once said. "A film is never done, it's
abandoned," and this one was such a fast
track...we were just racing. There wasn't
even time to worry about it. Oddly
enough with this film 1 never had doubts
about it being done when it was done —
and I'll tell you something extraordi
nary. the minimum time directors have
to get their first cut is 12 weeks, I had my
director's cut in four days. It was done,
that's it, except for what we reshot,
which took a day and we were ready to
go...very careful shooting, I knew just
what we needed, and I have a great edi
tor who was cutting the whole time... I
think if you really know what you're
doing, you can walk away. It's a good lit
tle film, and we'll see how it does.
Q: So, the way Rippner dies in the

end...was that in the script the whole
time? Her father [Brian Cox] got to kill
the guy at the end.
WC: That went back and forth between
her having the final shot and he having
the final shot, it was the studio...lt felt
like that at this point she had beaten him
all she could and that she needed some
help. The fact that her father was there
and that she had saved his life, the inter
esting thing to me about that was after
the father kills Rippner (played by Cil
lian Murphy), and Rippner gets up, she
has all these lines about "It's over!" and
"Never undestimate your enemy." We
took all that out and just made it all in
the looks, it went from here to there, it's
amazing. "Never underestimate your
enemy" was my mistake, I was fighting
for it to be kept in, and finally I said
"Take that damn thing out" and that
was it. Those looks are some of my fa
vorite stuff in the movie. It's almost a
smile on his face, like looking at a wor
thy adversary and saying "You beat the
shit out of me" — she won his respect, I
think it's a great film for those two to be
thrown together...he faked being in love
with her, but I think that character did,
he certainly became a friend to her.
ENT: You say they sort of became friends,
and also that whole he's just doing his job
but in the movie, Ripner takes a lot of pun
ishment. He gets tripped, beaten with a
field hockey stick, trips over a couple of
chairs, knocked down the stairs, shot
twice, you know, pen in the throat... so he
takes quite a lot of punishment. Did you
find during the screenings that people
started to feel sorry for him. that people
sympathized with the killer too much,
even though he's just trying to do his job?
WC: It doesn't bother me. He says the line
"I'm just trying to do my job" and at the
point that he says that, you can see he re
alizes that it's not a good enough excuse
anymore, that the family was going to be
involved. You can see it in his face, that
any illusion that she might look at him and
respect him is gone. You can also tell, I
think, that he was uneasy with what he
was participating in; a part of the fall of a
guy who is in control, to, piece by piece,
having every facade of his professional
ism stripped away. A professional
wouldn't have gone into the house. A pro
fessional would've just walked away.
ENT: After you taught, you were a taxicab
driver in New York City. What are some
of the most memorable characters and ex
periences you had? Any crazy people?
WC: I could write a book about that.
There were people passing joints, prosti
tutes offering to turn tricks, there was
once a guy who was clearly a business
man coming out of a gay bar with his nose
smashed in completely. I drove him all
the way to Long Island and he left a $100
tip. There was a guy I thought died in the
backseat, so I took him to the police sta
tion and the officer pulled him out and
slapped him from side to side going "Hey
chico! Wake up!" (He wasn't dead after
all.) That was when I grew my hair out
long and took lots of exotic drugs, things
were much more realistic...! always
thought it'd make a great T.V. series.
ENT: What would you tell a cop if he
pulled you over for speeding /following
the car in front of you (who was also
speeding) too closely?
WC: I would've said, "I am the father of
Freddy Krueger, do you really want to
give me a ticket?"
ENT: That works.
