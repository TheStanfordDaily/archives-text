# Cops, Craven and Cillian: An interview to remember
## 
### TAM VO WINDOW SEAT DEMANDER 
Intermission writers and editors have had a run
of terrible luck with law enforcement officers in
the past (see "A "Hitch' in our plans" for the last fi
asco). This luck does not change in the Intermis
sion off-season that is summer, when we become
the entertainment section of The Weeklv. So what

would a press junket for Wes Craven's upcoming
release "Red Eye" at the Ritz Carlton in SF be
without cops, you ask? Well, we would have ar
rived on time, without a speeding ticket and with
out a verbal warning for "following too closely at
an unsafe speed."
Wes Craven and the other journalists were al
ready ten or so minutes into their roundtable in
terview. meaning they had stroked his eeo for

about 8 of those minutes and that we didn't miss
t(X) much. Having done my research over the
phone on the way to the city. I felt that we were
well prepared to ask questions completely unrelat
ed to Craven's new film. He wasn't as scary as we
anticipated, with a voice so swthing he should
record books on tape and a distinguished look that
screams. "Law professor." But if he really wants to
leave the horror genre ("Nightmare on Elm
Street" and the "Scream" series) and make suc
cessful romantic comedies and period dramas, as
he told us. he might consider going back to his lull
name. Wesley, and adding a "burg" to the Craven.
On Rachel McAdams [of "Mean Girls,"
"The Notebook" and "Wedding Crashers"]
WES CRAVEN: That role changed names and
genders and ethnic backgrounds all through cast
ing. and then she walked in...and it's like "Okay,
where the hell were you?" This is her first feature
and she's just wonderful. You look at her and
how she does lines and makes up things â€” it's
just great.
On novel writing
WC: It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.
a lot of the writing happened in between shoot
ing. it's as hard as I push myself. I was a writer all
through high school and college. 1 went to Johns
