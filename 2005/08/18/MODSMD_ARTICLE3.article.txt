## Future may hold centralized performing arts space Groups seek more theater venues 
### RICARDO GILB STAFF WRITER 
With the plans to renovate Stanford
Stadium and the opening of the new
Arrillaga Family Fitness Center in
September, some students and administra
tors have been reflecting on the status of
arts and performing arts venues on cam
pus and evaluating the role that these
activities play on campus.
According to the Stanford News
Service, the facility that currently houses
Roble Gym will be given to the Drama
Department once the fitness center opens.
But the campus will still lack a place
where students can both produce and
watch the performing arts.
While the arts at Stanford may appear
weak to those who do not actively seek
out performances, there are over 70 "cre
ative arts groups" registered with the
Office of Student Affairs. However, there
are few places where involved students
can meet and collaborate.
"The biggest problem is visibility," said
Kay Kostopoulos, a lecturer in Stanford's
Drama Department. "People don't think
of Stanford as an art community. It's
noted for its business school, for its law
school and for its computer science. Arts
don't have an on campus presence."
Many students and professors said they
feel that this problem could be addressed
if the University committed to building a
high-quality performing arts center.
University President John Hennessy
told The Stanford Report in March, "I
personally believe that our programs in
the arts do not play as central a role as
they should in a university of Stanford's
caliber. I hope that we can address this dis
crepancy in the years ahead."
And much will likely be happening in
the years ahead. A large part of the strug
gle for performing arts groups on campus
has been the battle for both rehearsal and
performance space.
"One of our biggest challenges as a the
ater group not permanently housed is we
move into our space a week before we
start," said Nick Allen, one of the direc
tors of the Stanford Shakespeare Society.
Students looking for space to perform
often have to compete with other students,
or they find that the space is reserved for
other departmental or administrative fuc
tions.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, for example,

is frequently booked by Stanford Lively
Arts, which brings world-class performers
to campus, but nonetheless precludes stu
dent access to one of the campus' most
prominent stage.
As for space in the Drama
Department, alumnus Sean Lim, who
helped restart the Asian American
Theater Project before he graduated in
2(X)1, said the department has traditional
ly "had a monopoly on performance
venues." This may change, as the depart
ment will, over the next few years, be tak
ing over Roble Gym.
Next year all rehearsals will be moved
to Roble. which, said Alex Mallory, a ris
ing sophomore, "makes it possible for
there to be more performances, and that's
a good thing."
In addition to more space for
rehearsals and performances, students
need to know that these events are actual
ly going on. James Lin. former president
of the Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts, or SOCA. said he believes that a
permanent building would give students a
place to go check event schedules,
increase awareness regarding the number
of students involved in the arts and
encourage students to attend more such
events.
Lin, as part of SOCA, has helped orga
nize An Art Affair, which aims to expose
students to art produced by their peers.
He said that students are pleasantly sur
prised by the caliber of the art at the Art
Affair.
"They do not expect the level of talent
they see," he said.
Lim, who is now the artistic director of
the Asian American Theater Company in
San Francisco, agreed that those expecta
tions are important and that a new venue
could help broaden more students' appre
ciation of the fine arts.
"If there's a viable space, we can
encourage artists to work together and we
can centralize an audience," he said.
Art Department Prof. Bryan Wolf and
Music Prof. Jonathan Berger presented
the Faculty Senate in March with an ini
tiative to encourage artistic creativity on
campus.
According to a June article in The
Stanford Report, Berger considers himself
"a radical proponent of the idea that to be
number one, we first need a first-rate the
ater before we need a refurbished football
stadium."

Next year Roble Gym will be converted
from an athletic facility into practice and
rehearsal space for the performing arts.
