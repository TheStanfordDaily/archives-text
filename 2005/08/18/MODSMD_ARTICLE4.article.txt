### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
Hwang Woo Suck, a professor at Seoul
National University and pioneer in stem cell
research, addressed the Korean community
at Stanford on Aug. 12 with a lecture enti
tled "Life, Science, Technology and Our
Future." His presentation outlined his
South Korean team's recent breakthroughs
in the field.
Hwang's team, with help from Gerald
Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, recently became the

first to clone a dog. The team used Somatic
cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, technology,
which was also employed in creating Dolly,
the sheep clone made in 1997 by a team of
scientists from the United Kingdom.
According to Hwang, lan Wilmut, one of
Dolly's creators, visited his laboratory at
Seoul National University and has agreed to
take part in its embryonic stem cell
research. The scientists will investigate the
possibility of curing Lou Gehrig's with stem
cell technology.
Hwang said that cloning animals may
lead to the generation of organs that would

not be rejected by human bodies. In his lec
ture, Hwang emphasized the importance of
therapeutic cloning, referencing the fact
that the current supply of human organs
available for transplantation does not keep
up with the demand.
"A pig's heart is very similar to that of a
human" he said. He added that once the
safety of transplanting organs can be
assured, his team will further their research
by transplanting animals' organs into
human bodies.
