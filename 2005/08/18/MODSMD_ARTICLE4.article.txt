# Korean scientist describes cloning progress

### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
Hwang Woo Suck, a professor at Seoul
National University and pioneer in stem cell
research, addressed the Korean community
at Stanford on Aug. 12 with a lecture enti
tled "Life, Science, Technology and Our
Future." His presentation outlined his
South Korean team's recent breakthroughs
in the field.
Hwang's team, with help from Gerald
Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine, recently became the

first to clone a dog. The team used Somatic
cell nuclear transfer, or SCNT, technology,
which was also employed in creating Dolly,
the sheep clone made in 1997 by a team of
scientists from the United Kingdom.
According to Hwang, lan Wilmut, one of
Dolly's creators, visited his laboratory at
Seoul National University and has agreed to
take part in its embryonic stem cell
research. The scientists will investigate the
possibility of curing Lou Gehrig's with stem
cell technology.
Hwang said that cloning animals may
lead to the generation of organs that would

not be rejected by human bodies. In his lec
ture, Hwang emphasized the importance of
therapeutic cloning, referencing the fact
that the current supply of human organs
available for transplantation does not keep
up with the demand.
"A pig's heart is very similar to that of a
human" he said. He added that once the
safety of transplanting organs can be
assured, his team will further their research
by transplanting animals' organs into
human bodies.
Hwang also said that embryonic
stem cell research is a key to a
promising future for treating spinal
cord injuries and diseases such as
Alzheimer's. Lou Gehrig's and dia
betes. However, this promising tech
nology further stirs already inflamed

moral debates about the ethics of
stem cell research in which human
embryos must often be destroyed to
produce embryonic stem cells.
President George W. Bush has
publicly expressed concern about
Hwang's work.
"I worry about a world in which
cloning becomes acceptable," he
said.
"Research on stem cells derived
from human embryos may offer
great promise, but the way those

cells are derived today destroys the
embryo," Bush added in a White
House address in May. "We should
not use public money to support the
further destruction of human life."
Unlike its U.S. counterpart, the
South Korean government fully
supports Hwang's team. The coun
try's government announced that it
would give the team an additional
$1 million in funding and provide
whatever assistance that it might
need in the future.
