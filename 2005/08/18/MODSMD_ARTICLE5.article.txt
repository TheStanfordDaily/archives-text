# Alcohol banned from Mirrielees
## 
### MANDY KOVACH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just before the close of the eight-week Stanford
Summer Session on Aug. 10, students living in
Mirrielees were notified that alcohol was prohibit
ed in the building's public spaces.
According to Residence Dean John Giammalva.
the decision to ban alcohol came in response to
excessive student vandalism.
An e-mail sent out to residents after the week
end of Aug. 6 and 7 reported that a total of $3,000-
worth of damage had been done since the begin
ning of summer and the $950 of that had been com
mitted that weekend.
"The problem was less the amount of alcohol
than the amount of damages, and the unwillingness
of residents to clean up after themselves," he said.
Three weeks prior to the decision, Giammalva
sent an e-mail warning all Mirrielees residents
about the amount of damages and impending fines.
"Furniture is missing, people are having parties
and simply leaving their mess for custodial staff to
clean up instead of cleaning up after themselves,"
he wrote. "Of greatest concern is the fact that two
fire extinguishers have been stolen. If anyone is
caught tampering with the fire extinguishers (or any
other fire alarm / safety equipment), there will be a
hefty fine and immediate removal from housing, for
the summer and most likely afterwards as well."
Throughout the weeks following that announce
ment, various emails were sent to students from the
Mirrielees resident assistants concerning further
damages to the building. The beginning of August
saw fines that resulted from a range of damages
including a hole in the wall from a pool ball and
excessive debris left for the custodial staff to clean.
According to Giammalva, the staff was support
ive of the decision. Although he foresees mixed
feelings from the residences, he also feels that a
majority of students living in Mirrielees understand
the necessity to maintain a safe environment.
"I imagine there are some who approve of the
new policy and some who do not," he told The
Weekly. "1 have received a number of e-mails from
Mirrielees residents supporting the policy. This
action was taken as a direct response to continued
unacceptable behavior that resulted in vandalism,
damages and mess. I think the vast majority of
Mirrielees residents understand why this action was
taken and support it on principle."
Mirrielees resident Nick Miyake, a rising senior,
said he understood why the decision was made.
"I am disappointed about the amount of proper
ty that was damaged and people not being respon
sible for their mess," he said. However, Mirrielees
is not a single community, so people are less
inclined to take care of their mess. They do not
have as much respect for the residence. It is an
unfortunate outcome, but necessary action was
taken."
Others were much less supportive of the deci
sion. Steven Tan, who will return to Yale after the
10-week Summer Session ends, does not support
the final decision.
"Mirrielees did not provide many social events
that I was able to enjoy," Tan said. "There were
trips to laser tag and the gun range, but I was not
interested in going. I think it would have helped the
problem if activities for a larger majority were pro
vided. However, the timing of the alcohol proba
tion was better because the eight-week residents
moved out shortly after, so the level of socializing
would have declined regardless."
