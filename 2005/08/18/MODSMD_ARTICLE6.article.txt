## Sketch Analyze that 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM OPINIONS COLUMNIST 
The main reason for last week's title was so
that 1 could follow up this week with another
pop culture reference. Of course now that I've
done that 1 suppose 1 need to back it up with
some content-
Well. it so happens that I haven't quite fin
ished on the topic of slave-driving - sorry, that
should have been "advising" — so luckily the
heading is not only witty, it's also appropriate.
Oh, one more thing before I start: Once again

former, current and prospec
tive advisors should consider
themselves exempt from all
that follows (except the good
bits).
There are 39 types of re
search advisors. Well actual
ly that's not exactly true. I
just made that up. Thirty
nine is, however, as good as
any other number for mak
ing the point that, much like

ice cream, advisors come in many different fla
vors, colors and fat contents.
I don't have the time, the inclination or the
imagination to come up with 39 types of profes
sors. However, below are a few that I've heard
about over the last couple of years. (I was going
to label them after ice creams, but I started to get
hungry, and I'm watching my waistline).
First off. there's the genius. Actually, this is a
whole sub-class. There are lots of geniuses (or
genii, according to my spellchecker. either goes)
amongst the Stanford faculty. In fact, I don't
think I'll be getting past the genius sub-category.
There's the quiet genius. You know they're a
genius because everyone cites their papers and
their names are whispered in reverent tones
around the department. They, on the other
hand, barely speak.
Extracting a single word is like getting a smile
from a traffic cop — simultaneously miraculous,
a little terrifying and utterly bewildering.
I guess it's like dating the cute, but quiet boy
from the back of the class. You just gotta hope
that you'll be the one he'll open his heart to. And
dish out all the insight you need to score a plush
post-doc.

We also have the utterly petrifying genius.
Old, wise and really intimidating. You can bare
ly bring yourself to speak to her.
Despite the fact that she's your nominal boss,
the bi-weekly ritual mauling at the group meet
ing of the visiting speaker means that you tend to
shy away from the face-to-face.
While terrifying types are often old, the old
aren't always frightening. Sometimes they're
friendly. Very friendly. So friendly that you
could go five years without ever having a dead
line.
Every week is spent surfing the Internet
(sigh, how I love the net) and idly contemplating
whether to start working or not. And since the
boss never asks you to do anything, this state of
affairs will persist until your hair starts thinning
(this is where balding 11 th-year grads are made)
and hopes of a job prospect no longer exist.
Comic geniuses are also surprisingly com
mon. Not that the endless physics/engineering /
chemistry jokes are funny (except for the ones
about the social skills of EE types — God, that
felt good, it's been a while), but I guess one's
sense of humor radar switches off after too many
differential equations.
So. should you be subjected to one of these
chaps for half a decade, you're in for the long
haul. Pretty soon, you'll be chortling at so many
jokes that wouldn't raise a smile in civilized
quarters that all sense of discrimination will dis
appear. Eventually, you'll start making them
yourself and the three normal friends you had
will disown you.
I'd say we've run the gauntlet of potential ge
nius advisors, and if not that we're certainly run
ning short of space. Which leaves me with my
weekly dilemma of how to finish.
Perhaps a personal thought might do the
trick this time. In the various conversations I've
had on this topic I've built up a vision of what a
dream mentor might be like. I've thought about
personality. About research areas. About acad
emic philosophies. And I've come up with three
criteria: Tall, leggy and a brunette.

Oddly enough, I'm actually looking for work at the
moment. So if you need a wannabe cosmologist/
student journalist / amateur cook / international
jewel thief (well the last one's been a fantasy of mine
fora while) e-mail navinsQstanfordedu.
