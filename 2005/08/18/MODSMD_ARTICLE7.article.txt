# Peace Notes
## Today is the beginning 
### TED DRENTON DAILY ALUMNUS 
Editor's Note: The Stanford Daily would like to
recognize the 6()th anniversary of the United Na
tions as part of the ongoing commemoration of
the end of World War II and the noteworthy
events that followed. In an article excerpted from
his series, "World Peace Notesâ€” '45", Stanford
alumnus and former Daily editorial writer Ted
Drenton, Class 0f1946, discussed the profound
importance of the U.N.'s first assembly in San
Francisco, Calif, on April 25,1945.
Today the United Nations Conference,
which will determine the course of history for
many decades, begins. Diplomats from nearly
every nation in the world arrive here to speak

for their peoples and the people of the world.
Now work is begun in an attempt to termi
nate an era of discord and human agony; Man's
spirit, after a great trail, is rekindled by the new
vision of brotherhood.
Many complex, international problems still
remain to be solved but the will to solve them
makes them smaller.
Everywhere, directly or indirectly, the un
wholesome effects of Fascism have disturbed
the order of world society. Millions of innocent
people have been slaughtered to suit the pur
poses of fanatical dictators. In Germany, it is
said, 5,000,000 Jews alone have been put to
death by the most ghastly means of torture be
cause they were a race out of favor.
Millions have been blasted to
death by bombs from those impartial
instruments of war. airplanes. Mil
lions. in the armed forces of nations,
have been cruelly wounded or slain in
defense of their lands. Fascists have
eradicated priceless works of art.
They have outlawed or made inconse
quential culture and morality.
Civilization totters but survives,
still strong in the faith that the crisis of
Fascism will never again occur. At
San Francisco, Fascism will be buried,
we trust, remaining only, in history, as
a monument to the evil possibilities of
the human mind.
Outmoded political systems and
the old injustices may perish at San
Francisco. Pressure will come upon
the British empire to give her subject
peoples economic and political free
dom. We are wisely giving political in
dependence to the Philippines and
there will seem less reason for other
Oriental peoples not to have similar
justice.
Now or never must come the real
ization that there exists no inferior peo
ple and that every human being has a
right to a free and complete life no mat
ter what his culture, faith, or skin.
America, in particular, which
stands for so much, should be aware
of this fact. In our history Negroes and
other colored peoples have been
treated as inferior to the white man
when they are equal.
