# Peace Notes
## Today is the beginning 
### TED DRENTON DAILY ALUMNUS 
Editor's Note: The Stanford Daily would like to
recognize the 6()th anniversary of the United Na
tions as part of the ongoing commemoration of
the end of World War II and the noteworthy
events that followed. In an article excerpted from
his series, "World Peace Notesâ€” '45", Stanford
alumnus and former Daily editorial writer Ted
Drenton, Class 0f1946, discussed the profound
importance of the U.N.'s first assembly in San
Francisco, Calif, on April 25,1945.
Today the United Nations Conference,
which will determine the course of history for
many decades, begins. Diplomats from nearly
every nation in the world arrive here to speak

for their peoples and the people of the world.
Now work is begun in an attempt to termi
nate an era of discord and human agony; Man's
spirit, after a great trail, is rekindled by the new
vision of brotherhood.
Many complex, international problems still
remain to be solved but the will to solve them
makes them smaller.
Everywhere, directly or indirectly, the un
wholesome effects of Fascism have disturbed
the order of world society. Millions of innocent
people have been slaughtered to suit the pur
poses of fanatical dictators. In Germany, it is
said, 5,000,000 Jews alone have been put to
death by the most ghastly means of torture be
cause they were a race out of favor.
