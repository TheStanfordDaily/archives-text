# Beyond the Books
## Sex is more than socialization 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
Editor's Note: This article is the first in a series of
columns about men and women.
Last weekend, 1 had the privilege of spending
an evening with, among others, a three-year-old
girl and her one-year-old brother. Their parents re
marked and my observation affirmed that the chil
dren were incredibly different — more stereotvpi
cally male and female than they or 1 expected. 1

might have dismissed their ob
servations as stereotypes, if the
girl and her brother (let's call
them Anne and John) didn't re
mind me so much of what I've
seen of myself and my brother
in family videos.
Anne and 1 were both volu
ble and volatile — quick to cry,
enamored of clothing, sensi
tive, easily scared and con-

stantly whining. John and my brother rarely made
a sound, were mostly calm and would have been
very easy babies if only they weren't so mobile
and prone to manipulating things (e.g. John
turned the fax machine on and off several dozen
times, came close to knocking over everyone's
beer can and opened the dishwasher, pulling out
hefty vegetable knives).
Seeing these children reminded me that, as po
litically incorrect as it is to say so, male and female
minds are fundamentally different. Certainly, so
cial expectations have some affect on people's in
terests and expectations for themselves. However,
I had to wonder whether a girl who was barely old
enough to communicate with adults amid be pick
ing up her love of dresses and chatter from them, or
whether a boy Ux> young to talk could be getting
the idea from adults that such behavior wasn't ex
pected of him.
Indeed, children show marked gender differ
ences in their behavior far before they could
reasonably be interpreting different societal ex
pectations.
Early in life
• At one day old, boys kx)k at mobiles longer than
newborn girls.
• At 12 months, girls look at human faces longer.
Researchers at Cambridge found that girls look at
faces longer than boys.

• The same Cambridge team found that one-year
old boys preferred watching a film showing cars to
one showing a person. Girls showed the opposite
preference.
• At a few hours, old girls are more sensitive than
boys to touch. Tests between the sexes of tactile
sensitivity in the hands and fingers produce differ
ences so striking that sometimes male and female
scores do not even overlap, with the most sensitive
boy feeling less than the least seasitive girl.
• When it comes to sound, infant females are much
less tolerant — one researcher believes that they
may "hear" noises as being twice as loud as do
males. Baby girls become irritated and anxious
about noise, pain or discomfort more readily than
do baby boys.
• According to Anne Moir and David Jessel in
"Brain Sex: The Real Difference Between Men
and Women." "[ajt four months, most baby girls
can distinguish photographs of people they know
from photographs of strangers; baby boys cannot."
• Researchers found three- and four-year-old boys
to be better at mentally rotating figures than girls of
the same age. — ibid.
• Doreen Kimura, the co-author of the 1994
paper, "Cognitive Pattern in Men and Women Is
Influenced by Fluctuations in Sex Hormones,"
"[f]or the past few decades, it has been ideologi
cally fashionable to insist that these behavioral
differences are minimal and are the conse
quence of variations in experience during devel
opment before and after adolescence. Evidence
accumulated more recently, however, suggests
that the effects of sex hormones on brain organi
zation occur so early in life that from the start the
environment is acting on differently wired
brains in boys and girls."
Different aptitudes?
• Boys outnumber girls four to one in remedial
reading classes, according to the book "Brain Sex. "
• "When asked to judge when someone might
have said something potentially hurtful, girls
score higher from at least seven years old.
Women are also more sensitive to facial ex
pressions. They are better at decoding non-ver
bal communication, picking up subtle nuances
from tone of voice or facial expression or judg
ing a person's character," writes Simon Baron-
Cohen in an article in The Guardian. He writes
