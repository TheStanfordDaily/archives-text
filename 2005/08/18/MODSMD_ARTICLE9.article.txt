## Sex is more than socialization 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
Editor's Note: This article is the first in a series of
columns about men and women.
Last weekend, 1 had the privilege of spending
an evening with, among others, a three-year-old
girl and her one-year-old brother. Their parents re
marked and my observation affirmed that the chil
dren were incredibly different — more stereotvpi
cally male and female than they or 1 expected. 1

might have dismissed their ob
servations as stereotypes, if the
girl and her brother (let's call
them Anne and John) didn't re
mind me so much of what I've
seen of myself and my brother
in family videos.
Anne and 1 were both volu
ble and volatile — quick to cry,
enamored of clothing, sensi
tive, easily scared and con-

stantly whining. John and my brother rarely made
a sound, were mostly calm and would have been
very easy babies if only they weren't so mobile
and prone to manipulating things (e.g. John
turned the fax machine on and off several dozen
times, came close to knocking over everyone's
beer can and opened the dishwasher, pulling out
hefty vegetable knives).
Seeing these children reminded me that, as po
litically incorrect as it is to say so, male and female
minds are fundamentally different. Certainly, so
cial expectations have some affect on people's in
terests and expectations for themselves. However,
I had to wonder whether a girl who was barely old
enough to communicate with adults amid be pick
ing up her love of dresses and chatter from them, or
whether a boy Ux> young to talk could be getting
the idea from adults that such behavior wasn't ex
pected of him.
Indeed, children show marked gender differ
ences in their behavior far before they could
reasonably be interpreting different societal ex
pectations.
Early in life
• At one day old, boys kx)k at mobiles longer than
newborn girls.
• At 12 months, girls look at human faces longer.
Researchers at Cambridge found that girls look at
faces longer than boys.

• The same Cambridge team found that one-year
old boys preferred watching a film showing cars to
one showing a person. Girls showed the opposite
preference.
• At a few hours, old girls are more sensitive than
boys to touch. Tests between the sexes of tactile
sensitivity in the hands and fingers produce differ
ences so striking that sometimes male and female
scores do not even overlap, with the most sensitive
boy feeling less than the least seasitive girl.
• When it comes to sound, infant females are much
less tolerant — one researcher believes that they
may "hear" noises as being twice as loud as do
males. Baby girls become irritated and anxious
about noise, pain or discomfort more readily than
do baby boys.
• According to Anne Moir and David Jessel in
"Brain Sex: The Real Difference Between Men
and Women." "[ajt four months, most baby girls
can distinguish photographs of people they know
from photographs of strangers; baby boys cannot."
• Researchers found three- and four-year-old boys
to be better at mentally rotating figures than girls of
the same age. — ibid.
• Doreen Kimura, the co-author of the 1994
paper, "Cognitive Pattern in Men and Women Is
Influenced by Fluctuations in Sex Hormones,"
"[f]or the past few decades, it has been ideologi
cally fashionable to insist that these behavioral
differences are minimal and are the conse
quence of variations in experience during devel
opment before and after adolescence. Evidence
accumulated more recently, however, suggests
that the effects of sex hormones on brain organi
zation occur so early in life that from the start the
environment is acting on differently wired
brains in boys and girls."
Different aptitudes?
• Boys outnumber girls four to one in remedial
reading classes, according to the book "Brain Sex. "
• "When asked to judge when someone might
have said something potentially hurtful, girls
score higher from at least seven years old.
Women are also more sensitive to facial ex
pressions. They are better at decoding non-ver
bal communication, picking up subtle nuances
from tone of voice or facial expression or judg
ing a person's character," writes Simon Baron-
Cohen in an article in The Guardian. He writes


Runyan
further that men tend to show "di
rect" aggression such as hitting
whereas women show covert or rela
tional aggression, such as gossip or
verbal insults. His thesis in the book.
"The Essential Difference: The
Truth about the Male and Female
Brain." is that women's brains are
designed for empathy whereas
men's are built for understanding
and building systems.
• The amygdala, the brain's emotion
control center, shows significantly
higher levels of activity in males
viewing sexual visual stimuli than fe
males viewing the same images, ac
cording to a study led by Emory Uni
versity psychologists Stephan
Hamann and Kim Wallen.
• Women might have better short-term
memories. They can store greater
amounts of irrelevant and random in
formation than men. who seem to need
the information to be organized in
order to remember it.
• Doreen Kimura writes in "Sex Dif
ferences in the Brain" that "[mjen tend
to perform better than women on cer
tain spatial tasks. They do well on tests
that involve mentally rotating an object
or manipulating it in some fashion, such
as imagining turning [a] three-dimen
sional object or determining where the
holes punched in a folded piece of
paper will fall when the paper is un
folded. Men also are more accurate
than women at target-directed motor
skills, such as guiding or intercepting
projectiles. They do better at matching
lines with identical slopes. And men
tend to do better than women on tests
of mathematical reasoning."
• On the other hand. "Women tend
to perform better than men on tests
of perceptual speed in which subjects
must rapidly identify matching items
... When reading a story, paragraph
or a list of unrelated words, women
demonstrate better recall. Women do
better on precision manual tasks —
that is, those involving fine motor co

ordination — such as placing the
pegs in holes on a board. And women
do better than men on mathematical
calculation tests."
• Vanderbilt researchers find that
among a sample of 40,000 "gifted" 12-
to 14-year-olds who took the SAT,
about twice as many boys as girls
scored above 500 on the math section;
four times as many scored above 600;
and 13 times as many boys than girls
scored above 7(X). Boys and girls per
formed approximately the same on the
verbal portion.
• UCLA researchers performed brain
scans on people who scored in the 99th
percentile on the math portion of the
SAT and found that as they worked on
problems, the men relied on grey mat
ter in the cerebral and parietal cortices,
whereas women showed more activity
in areas with white matter, sparking the
observation by Richard Haier, a pro
fessor of psychology at the UCLA
Medical School that "Maybe [the
women] are doing the math using the
white matter."
Structural differences
• Haier and his colleagues at the Uni
versity of New Mexico and the UCI
Brain Imaging Center found that men
have about six-and-a-half times the
amount of gray matter related to gen
eral intelligence than women, and
women have nearly 10 times the
amount of white matter related to in
telligence than men. "These findings
suggest that human evolution has cre
ated two different types of brains de
signed for equally intelligent behav
ior," Haier said. Gray matter is used for
information processing, while white
matter consists of the connections be
tween processing centers.
• Rex Jung, a co-author of the study,
suggested that this difference in white
and gray matter between the sexes
might help to explain why men excel at
local processing tasks while women
tend to be good at integrating and as
similating information from distributed
gray-matter regions.
• In this same study it was found that 84
percent of gray-matter regions and 86
percent of white-matter regions in
volved with intellectual performance in

women were found in the brain's
frontal lobes, compared to 45 percent
and zero percent for males. Thus, most
of women's brain matter involved in in
telligence is in the frontal lobes, where
as the grey and white matter involved
in men's intelligence is distributed
throughout brain regions. The re
searchers remarked that this finding
that women's intelligence processing is
concentrated in the frontal lobe is con
sistent with findings that frontal brain
injuries can hurt women's cognitive
performance more than men's.
• A similar study at McMaster Uni
versity found that women have up to
15 percent more brain-cell density in
certain areas of the frontal lobe,
which controls so-called higher men
tal processes including judgment,
personality, planning and working
memory.
• Parts of the corpus callosum, a major
neural system connecting the two
hemispheres, as well as the anterior
commissure, another connecting struc
ture, are larger in women, which might
enable better communication between
hemispheres.
• Men seem to have greater asymmetry
between brain hemispheres, and dam
age to one hemisphere often has more
of an effect on cognition than a similar
injury in women.
Hormones affect the brain
• Canadian researchers found prenatal
testosterone levels were positively cor
related with skills on a mental rotation
test (imagining objects being rotated).
• Males with IHH (idiopathic hypogo
nadotrophic hypogonadism) have
small testes (and therefore low levels of
testosterone) and are worse at spatial
reasoning.
• Male babies with androgen insensi
tivity (AI) syndrome are also worse at
spatial reasoning.
• Females with CAH (congenital
adrenal hyperplasia) have high levels
of androgens and enhanced spatial sys
temizing.
• Researcher Elizabeth Hampson of
the University of Western Ontario
found that women's performance on
certain mental tasks varied throughout
their menstrual cycles. High levels of

estrogen were correlated with de
creased spatial ability but increased
speech and manual skills.
In the day or two that I've been
looking things up for this column. I've
been astounded not only at the number
of differences between male and fe
male brains, but also at the lack of sci
entific arguments that the brains are es
sentially equal. Certainly, people have
written that men and women have
equal ability, etc. during the Larry
Summers ordeal, but among people
who study the brain, the consensus
seems to be that while intelligence
(however it is defined) might be equal,
the male and female brains are alto
gether different animals.
As Moir and Jessel write in "Brain
Sex," "Men are different from women.
They are equal only in their common
membership of the same species, hu
mankind. To maintain that they are the
same in aptitude, skill or behavior is to
build a society based on a biological
and scientific lie.
We might condone that lie if it helps
women to believe that they can per
form in technical subjects just as well as
men or if it encourages the homogene
ity and androgyny our society seems to
desire. But there can be huge costs to
assuming that besides sexual responses
and the like, male and female brains are
the same.
I'll address these consequences in a
later column in this series.

Given that Andrea is prefers talking to
writing in solitude and also loves Moon
beams' tea, she'd love to talk with you
over hot beverages about sex differences.

adrenal hyperplasia) have high levels
of androgens and enhanced spatial sys
temizing.

In the day or two that I've been
looking things up for this column. I've
been astounded not only at the number
of differences between male and fe
male brains, but also at the lack of sci
entific arguments that the brains are es
sentially equal. Certainly, people have
written that men and women have
equal ability, etc. during the Larry
Summers ordeal, but among people
who study the brain, the consensus
seems to be that while intelligence
(however it is defined) might be equal,
the male and female brains are alto
gether different animals.
As Moir and Jessel write in "Brain
Sex," "Men are different from women.
They are equal only in their common
membership of the same species, hu
mankind. To maintain that they are the
same in aptitude, skill or behavior is to
build a society based on a biological
and scientific lie.
We might condone that lie if it helps
women to believe that they can per
form in technical subjects just as well as
men or if it encourages the homogene
ity and androgyny our society seems to
desire. But there can be huge costs to
assuming that besides sexual responses
and the like, male and female brains are
the same.

Editor's Note: This article is the first in a series of
columns about men and women.
Last weekend, 1 had the privilege of spending
an evening with, among others, a three-year-old
girl and her one-year-old brother. Their parents re
marked and my observation affirmed that the chil
dren were incredibly different — more stereotvpi
cally male and female than they or 1 expected. 1

might have dismissed their ob
servations as stereotypes, if the
girl and her brother (let's call
them Anne and John) didn't re
mind me so much of what I've
seen of myself and my brother
in family videos.
Anne and 1 were both volu
ble and volatile — quick to cry,
enamored of clothing, sensi
tive, easily scared and con-

stantly whining. John and my brother rarely made
a sound, were mostly calm and would have been
very easy babies if only they weren't so mobile
and prone to manipulating things (e.g. John
turned the fax machine on and off several dozen
times, came close to knocking over everyone's
beer can and opened the dishwasher, pulling out
hefty vegetable knives).
Seeing these children reminded me that, as po
litically incorrect as it is to say so, male and female
minds are fundamentally different. Certainly, so
cial expectations have some affect on people's in
terests and expectations for themselves. However,
I had to wonder whether a girl who was barely old
enough to communicate with adults amid be pick
ing up her love of dresses and chatter from them, or
whether a boy Ux> young to talk could be getting
the idea from adults that such behavior wasn't ex
pected of him.
Indeed, children show marked gender differ
ences in their behavior far before they could
reasonably be interpreting different societal ex
pectations.
Early in life
• At one day old, boys kx)k at mobiles longer than
newborn girls.
• At 12 months, girls look at human faces longer.
Researchers at Cambridge found that girls look at
faces longer than boys.

• The same Cambridge team found that one-year
old boys preferred watching a film showing cars to
one showing a person. Girls showed the opposite
preference.
• At a few hours, old girls are more sensitive than
boys to touch. Tests between the sexes of tactile
sensitivity in the hands and fingers produce differ
ences so striking that sometimes male and female
scores do not even overlap, with the most sensitive
boy feeling less than the least seasitive girl.
• When it comes to sound, infant females are much
less tolerant — one researcher believes that they
may "hear" noises as being twice as loud as do
males. Baby girls become irritated and anxious
about noise, pain or discomfort more readily than
do baby boys.
• According to Anne Moir and David Jessel in
"Brain Sex: The Real Difference Between Men
and Women." "[ajt four months, most baby girls
can distinguish photographs of people they know
from photographs of strangers; baby boys cannot."
• Researchers found three- and four-year-old boys
to be better at mentally rotating figures than girls of
the same age. — ibid.
• Doreen Kimura, the co-author of the 1994
paper, "Cognitive Pattern in Men and Women Is
Influenced by Fluctuations in Sex Hormones,"
"[f]or the past few decades, it has been ideologi
cally fashionable to insist that these behavioral
differences are minimal and are the conse
quence of variations in experience during devel
opment before and after adolescence. Evidence
accumulated more recently, however, suggests
that the effects of sex hormones on brain organi
zation occur so early in life that from the start the
environment is acting on differently wired
brains in boys and girls."
Different aptitudes?
• Boys outnumber girls four to one in remedial
reading classes, according to the book "Brain Sex. "
• "When asked to judge when someone might
have said something potentially hurtful, girls
score higher from at least seven years old.
Women are also more sensitive to facial ex
pressions. They are better at decoding non-ver
bal communication, picking up subtle nuances
from tone of voice or facial expression or judg
ing a person's character," writes Simon Baron-
Cohen in an article in The Guardian. He writes


Runyan
further that men tend to show "di
rect" aggression such as hitting
whereas women show covert or rela
tional aggression, such as gossip or
verbal insults. His thesis in the book.
"The Essential Difference: The
Truth about the Male and Female
Brain." is that women's brains are
designed for empathy whereas
men's are built for understanding
and building systems.
• The amygdala, the brain's emotion
control center, shows significantly
higher levels of activity in males
viewing sexual visual stimuli than fe
males viewing the same images, ac
cording to a study led by Emory Uni
versity psychologists Stephan
Hamann and Kim Wallen.
• Women might have better short-term
memories. They can store greater
amounts of irrelevant and random in
formation than men. who seem to need
the information to be organized in
order to remember it.
• Doreen Kimura writes in "Sex Dif
ferences in the Brain" that "[mjen tend
to perform better than women on cer
tain spatial tasks. They do well on tests
that involve mentally rotating an object
or manipulating it in some fashion, such
as imagining turning [a] three-dimen
sional object or determining where the
holes punched in a folded piece of
paper will fall when the paper is un
folded. Men also are more accurate
than women at target-directed motor
skills, such as guiding or intercepting
projectiles. They do better at matching
lines with identical slopes. And men
tend to do better than women on tests
of mathematical reasoning."
• On the other hand. "Women tend
to perform better than men on tests
of perceptual speed in which subjects
must rapidly identify matching items
... When reading a story, paragraph
or a list of unrelated words, women
demonstrate better recall. Women do
better on precision manual tasks —
that is, those involving fine motor co

ordination — such as placing the
pegs in holes on a board. And women
do better than men on mathematical
calculation tests."
• Vanderbilt researchers find that
among a sample of 40,000 "gifted" 12-
to 14-year-olds who took the SAT,
about twice as many boys as girls
scored above 500 on the math section;
four times as many scored above 600;
and 13 times as many boys than girls
scored above 7(X). Boys and girls per
formed approximately the same on the
verbal portion.
• UCLA researchers performed brain
scans on people who scored in the 99th
percentile on the math portion of the
SAT and found that as they worked on
problems, the men relied on grey mat
ter in the cerebral and parietal cortices,
whereas women showed more activity
in areas with white matter, sparking the
observation by Richard Haier, a pro
fessor of psychology at the UCLA
Medical School that "Maybe [the
women] are doing the math using the
white matter."
Structural differences
• Haier and his colleagues at the Uni
versity of New Mexico and the UCI
Brain Imaging Center found that men
have about six-and-a-half times the
amount of gray matter related to gen
eral intelligence than women, and
women have nearly 10 times the
amount of white matter related to in
telligence than men. "These findings
suggest that human evolution has cre
ated two different types of brains de
signed for equally intelligent behav
ior," Haier said. Gray matter is used for
information processing, while white
matter consists of the connections be
tween processing centers.
• Rex Jung, a co-author of the study,
suggested that this difference in white
and gray matter between the sexes
might help to explain why men excel at
local processing tasks while women
tend to be good at integrating and as
similating information from distributed
gray-matter regions.
• In this same study it was found that 84
percent of gray-matter regions and 86
percent of white-matter regions in
volved with intellectual performance in

women were found in the brain's
frontal lobes, compared to 45 percent
and zero percent for males. Thus, most
of women's brain matter involved in in
telligence is in the frontal lobes, where
as the grey and white matter involved
in men's intelligence is distributed
throughout brain regions. The re
searchers remarked that this finding
that women's intelligence processing is
concentrated in the frontal lobe is con
sistent with findings that frontal brain
injuries can hurt women's cognitive
performance more than men's.
• A similar study at McMaster Uni
versity found that women have up to
15 percent more brain-cell density in
certain areas of the frontal lobe,
which controls so-called higher men
tal processes including judgment,
personality, planning and working
memory.
• Parts of the corpus callosum, a major
neural system connecting the two
hemispheres, as well as the anterior
commissure, another connecting struc
ture, are larger in women, which might
enable better communication between
hemispheres.
• Men seem to have greater asymmetry
between brain hemispheres, and dam

scored above 7(X). Boys and girls per
formed approximately the same on the
verbal portion.
• UCLA researchers performed brain
scans on people who scored in the 99th
percentile on the math portion of the
SAT and found that as they worked on
problems, the men relied on grey mat
ter in the cerebral and parietal cortices,
whereas women showed more activity
in areas with white matter, sparking the
observation by Richard Haier, a pro
fessor of psychology at the UCLA
Medical School that "Maybe [the
women] are doing the math using the
white matter."
Structural differences
• Haier and his colleagues at the Uni
versity of New Mexico and the UCI
Brain Imaging Center found that men
have about six-and-a-half times the
amount of gray matter related to gen
eral intelligence than women, and
women have nearly 10 times the
amount of white matter related to in
telligence than men. "These findings
suggest that human evolution has cre
ated two different types of brains de
signed for equally intelligent behav
ior," Haier said. Gray matter is used for
information processing, while white
matter consists of the connections be
tween processing centers.
• Rex Jung, a co-author of the study,
suggested that this difference in white
and gray matter between the sexes
might help to explain why men excel at
local processing tasks while women
tend to be good at integrating and as
similating information from distributed
gray-matter regions.
• In this same study it was found that 84
percent of gray-matter regions and 86
percent of white-matter regions in
volved with intellectual performance in

women were found in the brain's
frontal lobes, compared to 45 percent
and zero percent for males. Thus, most
of women's brain matter involved in in
telligence is in the frontal lobes, where
as the grey and white matter involved
in men's intelligence is distributed
throughout brain regions. The re
searchers remarked that this finding
that women's intelligence processing is
concentrated in the frontal lobe is con
sistent with findings that frontal brain
injuries can hurt women's cognitive
performance more than men's.
• A similar study at McMaster Uni
versity found that women have up to
15 percent more brain-cell density in
certain areas of the frontal lobe,
which controls so-called higher men
tal processes including judgment,
personality, planning and working
memory.
• Parts of the corpus callosum, a major
neural system connecting the two
hemispheres, as well as the anterior
commissure, another connecting struc
ture, are larger in women, which might
enable better communication between
hemispheres.
• Men seem to have greater asymmetry
between brain hemispheres, and dam
age to one hemisphere often has more
of an effect on cognition than a similar
injury in women.
Hormones affect the brain
• Canadian researchers found prenatal
testosterone levels were positively cor
related with skills on a mental rotation
test (imagining objects being rotated).
• Males with IHH (idiopathic hypogo
nadotrophic hypogonadism) have
small testes (and therefore low levels of
testosterone) and are worse at spatial
reasoning.
• Male babies with androgen insensi
tivity (AI) syndrome are also worse at
spatial reasoning.
• Females with CAH (congenital
adrenal hyperplasia) have high levels
of androgens and enhanced spatial sys
temizing.
• Researcher Elizabeth Hampson of
the University of Western Ontario
found that women's performance on
certain mental tasks varied throughout
their menstrual cycles. High levels of

estrogen were correlated with de
creased spatial ability but increased
speech and manual skills.
In the day or two that I've been
looking things up for this column. I've
been astounded not only at the number
of differences between male and fe
male brains, but also at the lack of sci
entific arguments that the brains are es
sentially equal. Certainly, people have
written that men and women have
equal ability, etc. during the Larry
Summers ordeal, but among people
who study the brain, the consensus
seems to be that while intelligence
(however it is defined) might be equal,
the male and female brains are alto
gether different animals.
As Moir and Jessel write in "Brain
Sex," "Men are different from women.
They are equal only in their common
membership of the same species, hu
mankind. To maintain that they are the
same in aptitude, skill or behavior is to
build a society based on a biological
and scientific lie.
We might condone that lie if it helps
women to believe that they can per
form in technical subjects just as well as
men or if it encourages the homogene
ity and androgyny our society seems to
desire. But there can be huge costs to
assuming that besides sexual responses
and the like, male and female brains are
the same.
I'll address these consequences in a
later column in this series.
