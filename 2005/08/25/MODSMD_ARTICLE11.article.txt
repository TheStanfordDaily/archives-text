## Anti-anti-anti-antidepressants 
### ANDREA RUNYAN WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
A column opposed to the antagonizing of
people who would prefer not to take antidepres
sants for their whole lives.
From the way people talk about it, you'd
think the decision to stop taking antidepres
sants or to refuse to start taking them was
like shunning power steering out of mere
stubbornness. "It can help so much." people
say. "Why struggle when things can be so

easy?"
The pressure is even
stronger because the choice
affects not just the person but
everyone he or she interacts
with. "Take your meds, and
use your power steering," the
ethic goes, "or no one will
want to be around you." The
unspoken question is. "What
sort of weird combination of

Luddism, stubbornness, vanity and ignorance
would make you want to take out your power
steering or be off of antidepressants, if they help
you?"
Power steering and antidepressants were
both invented in the mid-20th century and are
now almost übiquitous. Nearly all cars have
power steering and we're practically putting
antidepressants in the drinking supply.
But whereas power steering generally is a
good thing for widespread use, antidepressants
might not be. Unlike power steering, they have
many drawbacks and dangers — so many that
we'd do well to support people who want to dis
able their power steering, as it were, and experi
ence life without antidepressants.
A Chemical Imbalance?
Because of the say some cars are built,
they're almost un-drivable without power
steering. It's widely assumed that some people
are like this, too — that certain people, for
whatever reason, have a chemical imbalance
that requires them to take antidepressants for
life. In an essay on the phenomenon of taking
medicines indefinitely, MIT anthropology
professor Joseph Dumit cites a depression suf
ferer with the common explanation," [TJhat I
have to take some pills every day to maintain
my life is no different from my friend who

takes sulfa drugs daily to stave off a recur
rence of colitis, or another who injects herself
with insulin."
Pharmaceutical companies are doing a good
job spreading the bio-amine hypothesis of de
pression, exemplified in this paragraph on the
Prozac Web site: "Depression is not fully un
derstood, but a growing amount of evidence
supports the view that people with depression
have an imbalance of the brain's neurotransmit
ters. the chemicals that allow nerve cells in the
brain to communicate with each other. Many
scientists believe that an imbalance in sero
tonin. one of these neurotransmitters, may be
an important factor in the development and
severity of depression. Prozac may help to cor
rect this imbalance by increasing the brain's
own supply of serotonin."
The public is buying it — the medicine as
well as the theory. More than 50 percent of
Americans have taken a medication for de
pression at some point in their lives. A 2(X)1
poll conducted by the National Mental Health
Association found that 55 percent of people
never diagnosed with depression "understand
depression is a disease, and not a state of mind
that a person can snap out of." up from 38 per
cent ten years before. Of those with a diagno
sis of depression, more than three-quarters be
lieve that they will need treatment for the rest
of their lives.
Much of this ease with which people are buy
ing into antidepressants could be attributed to
the bioamine hypothesis of depression, a theory
supported much less by research than by drug
companies. The eminent neurosientist Elliott
Valenstein challenged this theory in his book.
"Blaming the Brain," writing that no biochemi
cal or anatomical traits have been found to reli
ably distinguish the brains of the depressed, and
attempts to prove the chemical deficiency hy
pothesis of depression have been in vain. Con
trary to predictions, depressed people don't
have less serotonin, and they don't seem to have
predictable imbalances of other neurotransmit
ters, either.
Valenstein's conclusion about why the
chemical imbalance theory persists despite
decades of failures to validate it is similar to
that which David Healey voices in"The Anti
depressant Era," — "It can reasonably be


Runyan
asked whether biological language
offers more in the line of marketing
copy than it offers in terms of clini
cal meaning."
Dr. Jonathan Metzl writes that
when a patient asks how his or her
psychiatric medication is thought to
work. "[t]he question, amazingly
enough, often results in a disquieting
pause. Sometimes, the physician will
take the scientific approach. "What
we know about their in vivo action is
simply theory. There are many, many
neurotransmitters in the brain. We
know medications such as Prozac
work on the serotonin system,
thought to be involved in the mecha
nism of depression...'
"Sometimes, the response can
sound a bit defensive. 'Well, let's just

say they work.' And sometimes, one
can just change the subject. Well,
how about this weather, huh?' But
beneath these responses, or lack
thereof, lies a discomforting truth:
We are not entirely sure of the mech
anism of action, broadly speaking, of
many psychotropic medications.
Moreover, while we have ample evi
dence attesting to these medications'
effect on brain chemistry, much re
mains to be said about the connec
tion of brain chemistry and emotion
al well being."
At least, people who decide to
stop taking antidepressants might
not be like diabetics choosing to
stop using insulin. But they might
not be like people disabling their
power steering, either ... [to be con
tinued].
