## Women open schedule against Penn State 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
The defending national champion women's
volleyball squad has a number of things to prove
this fall season. The Cardinal are out to prove that
they, and not projected league winner Washing
ton, rule the Pacific-10 Conference. That they,
and not current No. 1 Nebraska, deserve the top
ranking in the nation. And they have to show they
can do it all without the help of the team's four

season anchor, alumna Oganna Nnamani.
The players that made up Nnamani's support
ing cast last season will now take leading roles, and
the first challenge of the year will be the ultimate
test of their abilities to perform. This weekend, the
No. 3 Cardinal will open 2005 in the four-team
AVCA/NACWAA College Volleyball Show
case, which includes four of the top five preseason
squads in the nation. Those teams — Stanford,
Nebraska, Hawaii and Penn State — combine to
own 12 of the 24 NCAA Championship titles that

have been awarded in women's volleyball.
The tournament will make Nebraska's two
year-old Qwest Center, a $292 million facility, a
first-time volleyball host. The Qwest Center will
also host an NCAA Regional in December and the
2006 NCAA Volleyball Championships.
Stanford will take on No. 5 Penn State tomor
row night in Omaha. The defending Big 10
champ Nittany Lions finished 2004 with a 29-3
record, and five of the starters that keyed that suc
cess return to the court this season. Setter San
Tortorello leads the charge, joined by senior
Kaleena Walters. Walters set Penn State's single
season record for digs last year, averaging 5.68 per
game. Last season's Big 10 freshman of the year,
Kate Price returns as an outside hitter, hoping to
once again pace the team in kills. Fellow sopho
more Melissa Walbridge, who lead the confer
ence in hitting percentage and blocking, and ju
nior middle hitter Cassy Salver also return.
The Nittany Lions are 4-3 all-time against the
Cardinal, having won the team's most recent meet
ing last September on the Farm. Penn State also de
feated Stanford for the NCAA Championship title
in 1999. The team is 5-3 all-time at the Showcase.
The Cardinal also returns five starters — out
side hitter Kristin Richards, setter Bryn Kehoe,
middle blocker Lizzie Suiter, outside hitter Franci
Girard and libero Courtney Schultz.
While Penn State and Stanford battle, top
ranked Nebraska will face No. 4 Hawaii. The
Cornhuskers garnered 35 of the 60 first-place
votes which determine the preseason rankings,
in part because they return six starters from last
season's 30-2 squad. Two of those players —
middle blocker Melissa Elmer and sophomore
right side/opposite hitter Sarah Pavan were
first-team Ail-Americans in 2004.
Hawaii will also have to contend with the
Husker habit of starting strong. Nebraska has a
.900 winning percentage in season openers —
however, no host team has won the Showcase in
its 10-year history.
The Wahine also retain six starters after a 30-
1 campaign in 2004, and traditionally fare well
against Big 10 and Big 12 opponents, with win
ning percentages of .833 and .825 against those
conferences, respectively.
The victors in the two Friday contests will ad
vance to the championship at the tourney, while the
losers will play a consolation match.
Stanford leads the all-time series against Ne
braska, 7-3, but is 10-15 against Hawaii. All four
teams have at least one Showcase win, while Stan
ford has two to its credit.
