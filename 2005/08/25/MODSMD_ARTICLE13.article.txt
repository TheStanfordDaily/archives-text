# Taylor turns star in Alaska summer league
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SPORTS EDITOR 
Stanford baseball fans knew something spe
cial was in store when highly regarded recruit
Michael Taylor arrived from Florida last fall.
Fingers crossed in hopes that he would be a
freshman who didn't play like one, and the 6-
foot-6 outfielder disappointed no one. He bat
ted .289 on the season with four home runs, and
became the first Stanford player to hit for the
cycle since Edmund Muth in 1998. And then he
went to the Land of the Midnight Sun.
Taylor took the field this summer for the Mat-
Su Miners of the Alaska Baseball League, a team
that has also been home for recent draft choices
Jed Lowrie and Jeff Gilmore. Taylor punished the
pitchers of the ABL with his long swing all sum
mer long, and for his efforts earned a spot on the
All-League squad. He batted .317 (second among
everyday starters on his team), with four homers

and a team-leading 25
RBI. Taylor also managed
to lead the league in stolen
bases with 25, all while
holding down right field
for the Miners — though
he did put in some time in
center and at short.
Stanford catcher
John Hester, who will re
turn for his senior year
after being selected late
in this year's MLB draft,

joined Taylor on the Miners squad. Despite
spending his time as a Cardinal backstop, the
Miners used Hester as a first baseman for half
of his time and a left fielder for the other half.
The righty hit .248 on the summer with 20 RBI
and two longballs.
Despite the help of Hester and Taylor, the
ABL Championship went to the Fairbanks Gold

panners this season, with a little bit of help from
rising junior Joe Ayers. The infielder hit .250 in 21
games for the Goldpanners.
Rising sophomore Randy Molina, who saw
limited time on the Cardinal's lineup card in 2005
had plenty of opportunities this summer with the
Madison Mallards of the Northwoods League. In
56 games in the designated hitter spot, Molina hit
.279 with 26 RBI.
Soon-to-be junior centerfielder Jim Rapoport
did not fare as well hitting for the Yarmouth-Den
nis Red Sox in the Cape Cod League — he mas
tered only a .162 on the summer. However, the
speedy lefthander drew 17 walks and picked up 18
stolen bases to lead the squad (the next closest
swiped bases total was seven).
Stanford pitchers also impressed in the sum
mer leagues this year, with rising junior reliever
Jeff Stimpson highlighting the performances.


Chris Minaker
Stimpson went 2-0 with five saves out
of the pen for the Santa Barbara
Foresters of the California Collegiate
League. He made 20 appearances for
35 total innings, scoring an ERA of
2.83 and holding batters to a .195 bat
ting average.
Sophomore Erik Davis pitched 36
1/3 innings for the Maxim Yankees,
holding onto a slick 2.48 ERA in eight
games. He fanned 47 batters and did
not allow a four-bagger.
Rising junior Greg Reynolds had
a rocky record of 2-3 for the Bourne
Braves in the Cape Cod League, but
racked up an ERA of just 1.70 in 53
innings pitched, including one com
plete game.
But the greatest gig in summer
baseball certainly belonged to the
quintet of Stanford players who com
peted in the Hawaii Collegiate Base
kill League — seniors Matt Manship.
Chris Lewis and Chris Minaker and ju
niors Zach Gianos and Ryan Kissick.
Manship, Lewis and Minaker put to
gether strong summer numbers and
each earned a spot on the very tan (or
very sunburnt) All-League team.
