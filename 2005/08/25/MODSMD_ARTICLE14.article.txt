# Dissecting the Diesel's "G-Funk"
## 
### SEAN HOWELL SPORTS COLUMNIST 
I work at a movie studio, so I didn't think it
was that odd when I asked a co-worker what
his favorite movies were. His answer, though,
struck me as strange.
"Man, 1 don't really watch movies," he said,
then reconsidered. "We 11...1 really like
Shaq's."
I was taken aback. When I think of The

Diesel, 1 think of his other
career.
As a recording artist.
I know what you're think
ing: no matter how lyrically
talented Mr. O'Neal is —
and if you believe what he
says in his songs, his 'skill/'
are as immense as he is —
his rhymes could never sur
pass his portrayal of a rap
ping genie in "Kazaam" or

as a weapons-designer-turned-crime-fighting
superhero in "Steel."
But if, like my misguided co-worker, you
think that Shaq's legacy will be on celluloid
instead of vinyl, then boy, do I have an album
for you: Shaq's 19% opus, "Shaq Fu: Da Re
turn." (Note: Mr. O'Neal never specifies
what he is "returning" from. He hasn't re
leased an album titled "Shaq Fu," leading us
to believe that he abandoned the original
project in a spat of creative frustration. How
ever. Shaq did release a video game called
"Shaq Fu" in 1994).
"Shaq Fu: Da Return" was the second of
his four albums (five if you count his 1996
"Best of," a compilation of his first two
records), and it showcases Shaq in his prime.
As J.T. Griffith, a reviewer for All Music, put
it:"The Best of Shaquille O'Neal may be
Shaq's best collection of songs, but 'Shaq-Fu:
Da Return' is the album where the artist first
finds something to say."
Well said. The most poignant lyric comes
in "Biological Didn't Bother," an ode to
Shaq's stepfather, Philip Harrison. (Note: To
dispel any confusion, there are two versions
of the song on the album: "Biological Didn't
Bother (G-Funk Version)" and "Biological
Didn't Bother (Original Flow)," which, de
spite being the original, comes after the G-
Funk Version on the album. The liner notes
offer no explanation).
On both versions, Shaq raps: "Mom offered
[Phil] a million-dollar package deal / She said
you want me, you got to take my son / Or else
it's like a hot dog / but without the bun." Grif
fith is right: Shaq has found something to say,
but like any good artist, he leaves plenty of lyri
cal ambiguity. Why is Shaquille referring to his
mother as a hot dog? Is she flashy, as in, "T.O.
hot-dogged that last touchdown when he
spiked the ball and then gave the defensive
back a wedgie"? Does he mean that his moth
er is just plain hot, but also a dog? Is that a com
pliment or an insult?
And why is Shaq the bun?
The confusion with regard to Shaq's feel
ings towards his mother deepens on track
four. At first, it sounds as if he is rapping in
the chorus: "I want a girl like Medea."
Uh...Medea? As in the Greek tragic hero who
murders her children revenge herself upon
her husband when he leaves her for another
woman?
