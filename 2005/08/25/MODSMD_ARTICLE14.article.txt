# Dissecting the Diesel's "G-Funk"
## 
### SEAN HOWELL SPORTS COLUMNIST 
I work at a movie studio, so I didn't think it
was that odd when I asked a co-worker what
his favorite movies were. His answer, though,
struck me as strange.
"Man, 1 don't really watch movies," he said,
then reconsidered. "We 11...1 really like
Shaq's."
I was taken aback. When I think of The

Diesel, 1 think of his other
career.
As a recording artist.
I know what you're think
ing: no matter how lyrically
talented Mr. O'Neal is —
and if you believe what he
says in his songs, his 'skill/'
are as immense as he is —
his rhymes could never sur
pass his portrayal of a rap
ping genie in "Kazaam" or

as a weapons-designer-turned-crime-fighting
superhero in "Steel."
But if, like my misguided co-worker, you
think that Shaq's legacy will be on celluloid
instead of vinyl, then boy, do I have an album
for you: Shaq's 19% opus, "Shaq Fu: Da Re
turn." (Note: Mr. O'Neal never specifies
what he is "returning" from. He hasn't re
leased an album titled "Shaq Fu," leading us
to believe that he abandoned the original
project in a spat of creative frustration. How
ever. Shaq did release a video game called
"Shaq Fu" in 1994).
"Shaq Fu: Da Return" was the second of
his four albums (five if you count his 1996
"Best of," a compilation of his first two
records), and it showcases Shaq in his prime.
As J.T. Griffith, a reviewer for All Music, put
it:"The Best of Shaquille O'Neal may be
Shaq's best collection of songs, but 'Shaq-Fu:
Da Return' is the album where the artist first
finds something to say."
Well said. The most poignant lyric comes
in "Biological Didn't Bother," an ode to
Shaq's stepfather, Philip Harrison. (Note: To
dispel any confusion, there are two versions
of the song on the album: "Biological Didn't
Bother (G-Funk Version)" and "Biological
Didn't Bother (Original Flow)," which, de
spite being the original, comes after the G-
Funk Version on the album. The liner notes
offer no explanation).
On both versions, Shaq raps: "Mom offered
[Phil] a million-dollar package deal / She said
you want me, you got to take my son / Or else
it's like a hot dog / but without the bun." Grif
fith is right: Shaq has found something to say,
but like any good artist, he leaves plenty of lyri
cal ambiguity. Why is Shaquille referring to his
mother as a hot dog? Is she flashy, as in, "T.O.
hot-dogged that last touchdown when he
spiked the ball and then gave the defensive
back a wedgie"? Does he mean that his moth
er is just plain hot, but also a dog? Is that a com
pliment or an insult?
And why is Shaq the bun?
The confusion with regard to Shaq's feel
ings towards his mother deepens on track
four. At first, it sounds as if he is rapping in
the chorus: "I want a girl like Medea."
Uh...Medea? As in the Greek tragic hero who
murders her children revenge herself upon
her husband when he leaves her for another
woman?

Thankfully, no. A glance at the
track list reveals that Shaq is actual
ly saying "My Dear." A closer listen
to the lyrics reveals that by "My
Dear," Shaq means ... his mother,
Lucille. He goes on to describe phys
ically: "tall, slender, brown eyes,

with that jet black hair." At this
point, the listener may find himself
wondering which is creepier: that he
wants a woman who kills her chil
dren, or that he wants his mother. "I
need a woman who reminds me of
Lucille," Shaq raps, sounding a bit
like a character in another ancient
Greek play centering around odd
family relations. Maybe The Big
Aristotle meant to refer to the clas
sics, after all.
Though the literary allusions
add a lot, this album wouldn't be

what it is without Shaq's social
messages. He advises against tak
ing drugs and drinking but still
manages to get in a plug for Pepsi,
one of his endorsers: "1 never did
drugs, nor do I drink / Okay, I
drink Pepsi, 'cuz it makes me
think." Of all the claims that Pepsi-
Cola has made in its advertise
ments, I don't believe that an in
crease in brain activity is one of
them. But that's why we like to lis
ten to Shaq making art: we get to
see what Shaq really thinks. He
gives us the true scoop on Pepsi
without having the remark scruti
nized as heavily as it would be,
were he to claim it in an actual ad
vertisement.
Shaq deals with the pressure of
fame from his film career on the
album, as well. He claims that, no
matter how big he gets, he "Won't
get caught jackin' off like Pee Wee
Herman." Good advice to anyone in
the public eye. Hell, it's good advice
to all of us. Don't do it in public!
Come on. people!
There are, of course, the übiqui
tous rap boasts: "Change my name
like Prince/Punks be tremblin'./My
name ain't Shaq anymore/Call me
Superman...emblem." It seems like
an odd choice to want to be a Su
perman emblem, rather than Su
perman himself. But it sure sounds
good.
On the whole, "Shaq Fu: Da Re
turn" is a fresh, authentic album,
packed with content, not style. As
The Big Emblem raps on the first
track along with RZA and Method
Man of The Wu Tang Clan, over and
over again: "We don't need no
hooks!" The Big Daddy's talents are
enough to carry the album.
So. please: listen to the record.
Believe me, it will make you will
think of Shaq as much more than
simply a movie star and a basketball
player. Maybe we can get a petition
going around to get Shaq to contin
ue his recording career after a
seven-year absence from the scene.
Lord knows the ego-driven music
industry could use a centered voice
like his.
