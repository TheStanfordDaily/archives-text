## Stanford Hall of Fame invites 11 more, soccer teams nab victories 
### 
Former men's basketball head
coach Mike Montgomery was just
one of 11 Cardinal athletics affiliates
that will be inducted into the Stan
ford Hall of Fame on Sept. 30.
We are very proud of the Hall of
Fame Class of 2005 and all of their
accomplishments," said Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland. "This
diverse group of former student-ath
letes and coaches is a great represen
tation of the history of Stanford ath
letics."
Montgomery coached the Cardi
nal men for 18 years and took the
team to the postseason in 16 of those
campaigns. The current Golden
State Warriors head coached the
Cardinal to a 393-167 (.702) record
during his time on the Farm.
Four former Stanford rowers
will also be inducted: Conn Finlay,
Kurt Seiffert, Kent Mitchell and
Edward P. Ferry. The quartet of
National Rowing Hall of Famers
has eight Olympic medals between
them, including at least one gold
medal apiece.

Women's tennis alumna Sandra
Birch helped the Cardinal to four
straight national championships
(1988-1991) and earned a pair of
NCAA singles titles. She was also a
two-time Broderick Cup winner in
her sport.

The other Stanford inductees are
water polo player Doug Burke,
swimmer Janel Jorgenson, football
players Ed Cummings and Chuck
Evans and baseball player Eric
Hardgrave.
Men's and women's soccer win
exhibition games
A crowd of 1,017 is hardly the
scene one would expect at a presea
son exhibition soccer match, but that
is precisely what the Cardinal men
saw in their contest against Drake in
Des Moines, lowa on Tuesday. The
attendance count set an lowa state
record for DI men's soccer, but that
was all the Cardinal gave the crowd
to clap about, as they handed Drake
a 2-1 comeback win.
The Bulldogs got on the board
halfway through the match, but the
Stanford rookies fired back in the
73rd and 77th minute for the lead.
T.J. Novak and Alex Kozachenko
did the damage on a penalty kick and
a header, respectively.
The Cardinal women also

grabbed a preseason win on the
pitch against UC-Davis. Senior
Martha West and junior Shari
Summers gave the team a 2-0 lead
that stuck. The contest was the
last for the women before Satur
day's season opener against Port
land.
Team USA wins gold at World
University Games
The United States flag was hoist
ed in celebration yet again at the
World University Games in
Turkey, after the USA men
matched the women's squad's gold
medal effort in basketball. The gold
was clinched by an 85-70 victory
over Ukraine on Sunday.
Senior point guard Chris Hernan
dez was one of five U.S. players to
post double digit points, scoring 11.
The American team has now
medaled in each of the 18 World
Games it has entered, and is 127-17
overall at the tournament.
