# Terrence Howard could just be the next big thing
## 'Hustle' will embrace your inner pimp 
### SCOTT HOWARD SUMMER FILM CRITIC 
"Hustle & Flow" is a good film that pulls too
many punches to be a great one. It's hard to be
lieve that a movie about a pimp in poverty
stricken Memphis with dreams of becoming a
rapper ends up so warm and cuddly that my
mom would like it. especially considering that
said pimp first feels the joy of personal artistic
vision while writing a club banger called
"Whoop That Trick" (and further considering
that its alternate titles include "Beat That
Bitch" and "Stomp That Ho").
It follows DJay (Terrence Howard in an ab
solutely brilliant performance that makes the

film essential viewing), whose long days of
pimping and small time drug dealing are so
fruitless that he can't even afford air-condition
ing. His. ahem, ladies (Taryn Manning, Taraji
Henson and Paula Jai Parker, all very different
and very effective) are giving him problems, a
midlife crisis has set in and he's plagued by (jus

tifiable) feelings of worthlessness.
When he runs into an old classmate who
records gospel records and court affidavits (An
thony Anderson), he remembers the mix-tapes
and freestyling of his youth and sees a chance to
make his music dreams a reality. With the help of
a nerdv beatmaster (DJ Quails of "Road Trip"
fame), he records a demo tape and attempts to
pass it off to Skinny Black (Ludacris in what
amounts to a memorable cameo), a local boy who
has hit the big time. Problems inevitably ensue.
Subject matter concerning drugs and prosti
tution walks a fine line between authenticity and
depravity, but director / writer Craig Brewer
makes DJay the most Disneyfied pimp imagin
able. squandering an opportunity to create a
unique, challenging and compelling antihero. As
is, DJay is less a pimp than a deadbeat. living off
the (extremely) hard work of his girlfriend(s).
Howard's intense eyes sometimes hint at the vi
olence his character is capable of, but since we
never see the darkest parts of his work his house
hold could just as easily be filled with any group
of aimless twenty or thirtv-somethings (fast food
workers, convenience store clerks, etc.). Perhaps
that's Brewer's intention — pimps and ho's are
just like you and me, or vice versa — but it feels
more like he's sanitizing difficult material for
mainstream protection.
It's also a shame that such an unconven
tional story betrays its low-budget indie roots
(it only cost 1/4 of what it made in its opening
weekend) by walking the same tired path as so
many films before it: "Purple Rain." "Rocky,"
"8 Mile"and so on. The"this has gotta happen
and it's gotta happen now!" thing has been
done so often that a five year-old could proba
bly tell you everything that happens just by
watching the trailer.
But one doesn't just watch movies t see the
last ten minutes, and "Hustle & Flow's" pre
dictable narrative is just the surface of a surpris
ingly rich atmospheric journey that stays in the
memory long after leaving the theater. DJay is
part of the proud southern tradition of story-
