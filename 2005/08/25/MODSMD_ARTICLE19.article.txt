# 'Broken Flowers' breaks your heart (but not really)
## 
### CHRIS LEE SUMMER HEARTBREAKER 
Greetings, dear entertainment reader — be
you casual peruser or discerning connoisseur,
welcome to the first (and last and only etc.)
summer movie column in which we, The Stan
ford Weekly, attempt to engage you, the lucky
(hapless) reader, in a scintillating to-and-fro
about movies which we have and possibly have
not seen in the past few weeks. How can you
have a spirited discourse with a printed page,
you ask? Well, you should not ask, foolish
reader, because everyone knows that talking to
a newspaper is crazy.
The limits of modern newsprint being what
they are, I suspect this "conversation" will
eventually devolve into an unmitigated, florid
ly unobjective rant in which this writer at
tempts to push his or her own subliminal agen
da (GO SEE "2046"); however, let it be said
that this column began with noble intentions
— something along the lines of Nick Hornby's
"Stuff I've Been Reading" column from The
Believer, minus the foppish charm and ambi
tions to hipster literati.

But let's begin, shall we? With "Batman Be
gins," perhaps the best studio flick of the sum
mer. Props to Chris Nolan for whisking the fran
chise away from the kitschy claws of Schumach
er emasculation. The killer cast adds much
needed gravitas (excepting Katie Holmes, who
just looks lost); Christian Bale does make fora
wonderful American bat psycho.
And then there's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"
which typifies studio bullheadedness. What
should have been a sly black comedy gets lost in
a hailstorm of gunfire and exploding cars; I con
fess: I fell asleep, but only after checking my
watch twice. Not even those Jolie lips could
keep my interest.
"War of the Worlds" kind of snuck up on us
at least, those of us who weren't fed up with the

antics of Tom "raving Scientologist" Cruise. As
always I admired Spielberg's flawless construc
tion and pacing, and Cruise acts just fine, but the
narrative itself is flawed — true to H.G. Wells
or not, that ending is still a killer anticlimax
("Deus ex machina," 1 hear Donnie Darko mut
tering). It's the first straight Spielberg theme
park ride since "Lost World," which is some
what disappointing.
But then those "Wedding Crashers" came
to save the day. 1 have to cop to being more
than a little tired of the new comedy "brat
pack" comprised of the brothers Wilson.
Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, ad
nauseam that keeps releasing the same movie
every six months. So imagine my surprise at
having "Wedding Crashers" deliver some of
the heartiest laughs of the year. Vince Vaughn
hasn't been so rabidly winning since his
"Swingers" days, and even when the plot turns
formulaic, the picture does have one last ace up
its sleeve: the irresistible cutie Rachel
McAdams, who might be single-handedly sav
ing that "Red Eye" flight as well.
But what about those indies, you
clamor. Isn't this supposed to be a
review for "Broken Flowers?"
(Deepest apologies, Tam.) Well,
sure. Here goes. 1 loved "Broken
Flowers." It's easily one of my fa
vorite films of the year (of the few
I've seen), perhaps Jim Jarmusch's
most accessible work. Bill Murray's
not doing anything you haven't
seen in "Rushmore" or "Lost in
Translation," but 1 do think Jar
musch might have the most deft use
of the actor's deadpan style; juxta
posed with the excruciatingly well
realized minutiae of suburban liv
ing. both artists complement each
other nicely.
Jeffrey Wright and Sharon Stone
turn in endearing performances.
About the only failures the film has
are its glacial pacing (not a real prob
lem for me) and an ending that real
ly has no hope of satisfying anyone.
However, if you're looking fora
movie to try, you could do a lot worse
than spend some reflective moments
re-exploring lost love with Murray
and company.
