# Music Update: Screw textbooks, buy these instead
## 
### TAM VO HOLLICE WANG SUMMER PLAYLIST AFFICIONADOS 
Whenever September rolls around, that only
means one thing — school is starting (and you
can't wear white after Labor Day). You can reme
dy the torture with a bit of good music, as opposed
to the radio's Hood of terrible muzak. So while
you're running around getting pens, filler paper
and those pesky things known as textbooks, be sure
to pick up some of these upcoming albums to put
your mind at ease.
I his week. Jack's Mannequin releases their debut
record entitled "Everything In Transit." If you don't
know who they are, think again, it's Something Cor
porate'* Andrew McMahon's side project. Even
with leukemia. McMahon pounds out another
catchy pop punk album, filled with songs that resem
ble the early SoCo sound.
Another highly-anticipated release is from those
loveable Canadians, The New Pornographers.
" I win Cinema," out on Tuesday, is the follow up to
their 2fX)3 sophomore release "Electric Version"

(2(KX)'s "Mass Romantic" is a must-have) and is ex
pected to feature the same type of upbeat, feel good
tunes. Don't believe us? Just download in"The Laws
Have Changed" or "All for Swinging You Around"
and wait for your feet to start tapping to the sunshiny
harmonies of Neko Case and A.C. Newman. We
don't know about you, but it makes Tam want to go
roller-skating around the neighborhood.
Speaking of feel good tunes, it's too bad that we
live in the United States this week, because (iold
frapp's "Supernature" made its debut in Europe.
This is probably Hollice's favorite album this week,
as it combines the electric sounds of "Black Cherry"
and the mellow tracks of "Felt Mountain" to make a
completely new, innovative sound. (Snaps for Alison
Goldfrapp!). However, it hasn't been released in the
US yet, so unless you are willing to pay oversea ship
ping charges, P2P sharing seems to be your only op
tion to get your hands on this great album.
As for the upcoming weeks, alternative music
fans should be looking forward towards Our Lady
Peace's " Healthy In Paranoid Times" release on Au
gust 29 and Switchfoot's "Nothing Is Sound." Skip

the SwitchfcxH and go "Oh No" with Ok Go, a hand
best known for catchy hook-laden singles such as
"You're So Damn Hot" on the day after. Overdosing
on tcx> much pop rock? "Late Registration" is a
phrase that strikes fear in the hearts of college stu
dents and car owners everywhere, except, unless,
you're Kanye West (Aug. 30).
Pop lovers should be excited for Craig David I **
"Story Goes," as we're pretty sure this album will be
full of cheesy lyrics just like the last one. And saving
the best for last, indie fans should pick up Ladvtron's
"Witching Hour," Sigur Ros's "Takk..." (Icelandic
for "thanks...") as well as Iron & Wine's collabora
tion with Calexico entitled "In The Reins," which
will available for your greedy paws come Sept. 13. If
you want some more moodiness and black eyeliner
with that rock, pick up the cheerfully-titled "Dead
beat Sweetheart" by The Juliana Theory (a band
whose catchiest song was once "If I Told You This
Was Killing Me. Would you Stop") And if you can't
wait until then, be sure to pick up Death Cab for
Cutie's latest effort "Plans," which we've had on re
peat for the last week.
