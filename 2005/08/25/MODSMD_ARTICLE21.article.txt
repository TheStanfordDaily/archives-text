# Nintendo goes to the dogs
## Innovative title has broad appeal 
### ERIC FORD SUMMER GAMING EXPERT 
Game: Nintendogs
System: Nintendo DS
Nintendo has always had
a mission that never quite
matched up with the rest of
the gaming industry. While
others focused solely on
pumping out hit sequels with

recycled gameplay, the big N has always publicly stated that they
try to not only give gamers what they want, but they try to also cre
ate new and innovative titles that will not only give players a new
experience, but will also appeal to a wide audience. Enter Ninten
dogs, the newest title for Nintendo's portable DS system. Touted
as a glorified puppy simulator, Nintendogs manages to use every
unique feature of the Nintendo DS to provide a fun gaming expe
rience that appeals to anyone that ever wanted to try their hand at
owning man's best friend (minus the mess).
Unlike traditional gaming titles, there is really no specific ob
jective in Nintendogs. When you start the game, you get to choose
from one of six initially available dog breeds (more are unlocked
as you play the game further) and after teaching it a name (yes,
you can actually give virtual puppy a name using the DS's micro
phone), you have free rein to do whatever you want with your
puppy. After "buying" my labrador retriever, 1 named him Bruno
and taught him a few simple tricks before taking him on a walk to
meet other puppies in the neighborhood. Of course, there are
other more routine activities such as feeding, petting and cleaning
your puppy, which have to do done occasionally in order to keep
your puppy's happiness high.
Okay, 1 know what you're thinking. So far this "innovative"
title sounds pretty boring as far as games are concerned, right?
Well, what makes Nintendogs different than any other title is the
sheer amount of detail in every activity the game offers. The graph
ics are on par with any handheld title available today. In fact, each
puppy looks and acts so horribly cute, only the most hardened and
desensitized of veterans wouldn't be touched by them. And
they're great for kids who are allergic to dog dandruff! The built in
DS microphone means that when you call your puppy, they will re
spond to you as if they were a real puppy, and the touch screen
means that when you take the stylus and pet your dog. they re
spond very realistically to every thing.
Competitions like running your puppy through an obstacle
course and participating in a Frisbee tournament add a lot of re
playability and incentive to train with your dog, as these are the main
avenues of earning hidden items in the game (including new breeds
of dogs that can be purchased in the kennel for training). Sometimes
it's fun just watching the little virtual puppies act on their own accord
to see how just how realistically they were programmed.
In the end, it's the presentation that makes Nintendogs shine.
Nintendo has done an excellent job in preserving the spirit of
owning a puppy in a tiny game cartridge. While hardcore gamers
may be turned off by the extremely non-linear path of the title,
and others may not appreciate Nintendogs' ultra-cute stars, I still
recommend that any one that owns a DS must give this game a
try. You just might fall in love with one of these puppies.
