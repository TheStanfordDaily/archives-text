# ROXY
## Heat up your summer internship 
### ROXY SASS SUMMER SEX GODDESS 
By now. Roxy is pretty sure that you
overachievers are sick of your glitzy
summer internships. "Get me back to
the Farm. Roxy!" you scream. The only
kind of screaming you've been doing all
August is from all the TPS reports
you've had to fill out lately. While at
work on a Saturday. This is even worse
than the months you spent masturbating
to Kelly Clarkson's hit "Since U Been
Gone" during the spring because your
girlfriend was abroad in Madrid. And, as
you realized in June, she wasn't having
as many siestas after she met Raul, the
"hot Spanish chef in my house who
serves me breakfast. In bed." Ouch.
Buck up little campers, because
miniskirt-and-halter-top season will
soon turn into "why are there no hot
people at Stanford?" season. As the
poet Robert Herrick noted in "To The
Virgins, To Make Much of Time," you
better get laid fast or you're going to
have to settle. Any idiot knows "That
age is best, which is the first / when
youth and blood are warmer." Loosely
translated, this means that you, dear
Reader, have a rapidly closing window
in which to fight carpal tunnel syndrome
and to get someone to gather your
"rose-buds." Even more importantly,
get to those cute frosh girls before SAE
invariably does. Get them before the
herp does, or risk ending up with a new
and vivid appreciation for Johnny
Cash's "Ring of Fire."
Stuck in between two fat interns
whose pimples create patterns you
swear are real constellations? No
problem. Unlike Staples ("the office
superstore"), Roxy has some more
useful solutions to your below-the-belt
business needs. If you're not an over
paid engineer at Google this summer,
you won't feel guilty about taking time
away from stuffing envelopes to lick
the stamps of that hottie from the sales
department. And please, for the love
of God, don't compare her nipples to
O's and l's. Hard to believe, but binary
isn't a turn-on for all.
It's widely known that everyone uses
the stock closet or conference room to

hook up. Borrow the company car in
stead. Just because you work fora non
profit doesn't mean that you wouldn't
profit from a blowjob. Rule of thumb
for that DC internship: hook your way
up to the top. At the end of the summer,
if you don't get offered at least a junior
staff position after all the time you
spent in the missionary position, well,
the Capitol is ready fora September
scandal to break.
Just remember not to blog about it
while at work — they can't fire you for
fucking around if it's not on department
time or equipment. As for those toiling
in the law firms (with aspirations of
high LSAT scores come fall), start per
fecting those oral arguments and cross
examinations in chambers. Offer to
help that junior partner with her rebut
tals and to look over her briefs. Who
says you don't learn anything when
school's out for summer?
People are much more likely to take
their clothes off when it's hot. If you're
not as unlucky as a former Intermission
editor who sold churros in the desert of
southern California at Disneyland last
summer, you probably have air condi
tioning at work. Sneakily shift the ther
mostat towards "Rio" not "frio" on
your way to the water cooler — break
the damn thing if you have to — and
the temps will be removing their
sweater sets and loosening ties sooner
than you can say "casual Fridays."
Hello, climax control.
Finally, if you're cursed enough to be
on the Farm this summer or within strik
ing distance. Roxy is sorry. You're just
hopeless. It's tough enough to think of
ways for you socially awkward Stanfor
dians to get ass during the school year,
especially if you're living in Castano.
Let's not even get into how impossible it
is to help you kids get laid when the ma
jority of the folks on campus haven't got
ten to algebra yet. If you've made it this
far without cashing in on some of the il
legal tender at the Nike summer tennis
camp, you are, indeed, strong of spirit.
Too bad too. most of you SRC folk prob
ably could have learned a thing or two
from those middle-schoolers, seeing
how their sexual development no doubt
dwarfs your own.
