# Small dishes slated for demolition

### ADAM WIDMAN NEWS EDITOR 
Five smaller cousins of the
Dish, Stanford's well-known,
massive radio antenna in the
foothills, may soon cease to exist.
The University has plans to
destroy the 60-foot radio dishes
pending a demolition permit
from the Santa Clara County
Planning Office.
The office is conducting a
review of the dishes' historical
significance and will issue or
not issue a permit based on its
findings.
The review was prompted by
the objections of a number of
community members to the dish
es' destruction. The Friends of
the Bracewell Observatory
Association, a local group dedi
cated to saving the dishes, has
already given the engineering
department $20,000 to delay the
demolition.
According to Bob Lash, the
group's president, the dishes not
only have historical significance
but can also be useful research
and learning tools in the Stanford
academic community.
"In light of the fact that these
dishes carry a $10 million
replacement cost, we feel it
would be a tragedy for them to
be demolished for no compelling
reason," Lash said. "We are
unaware of any competing use
for the property that has any aca
demic standing."
He added, "We are offering
to donate complete funding,
refurbishment, maintenance and
usage in exchange fora paid
lease to Site 515."
Lash also told The Weekly
that his organization encompass
es a host of Stanford professors,
including those who built and
operated the dishes in their early
years.
Stanford decided to raze the
dishes when the fire marshal
declared the wild brush area sur
rounding the radio antennas a
fire hazard. The dishes are all
located on territory owned by the
School of Engineering.
Jim Plummer, Stanford's
dean of engineering, said that the
University will keep what he
thinks is the most historically sig
nificant element of the site: con
crete pillars inscribed with "the
names of prominent scientists
and engineers who worked on
the site during that time period."
While the demolition permit
will be granted based on the dish
es' historical significance,
Plummer told The Weekly he
believed that the dishes are no
more historically relevant than
many of Stanford's other labs.
"There was a significant
amount of engineering and scien
tific research done there in [the
60's and 70's]," he said. "But of
course, one could make that
statement about many laborato
ries on campus.'"
