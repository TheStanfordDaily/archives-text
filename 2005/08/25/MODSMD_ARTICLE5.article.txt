### JIN YOON STAFF WRITER 
Daniel Coronell, a Colombian jour
nalist who has received numerous
death threats, will participate in the
Knight Fellowships program at
Stanford as a senior research fellow
this upcoming year. He will join 20
other fellows from the United States
and around the world.
Coronell is known for his investiga
tive work on drug trafficking, political
corruption and Colombia's continuing
civil war.

Dawn Garcia, deputy director of the Knight
Fellowships program, said that Coronell was referred
to them by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or
CPJ. She added that the committee often recommends
outstanding journalists to the program to advance
their understanding of the world through the numer
ous academic and professional opportunities that the
program offers.
Garcia added that Coronell will provide his insight into
and knowledge of Colombian journalism to the other
Knight fellows and to Stanford students. She said she


Coronell
expects Coronell to have opportuni
ties to speak to several classes o
Stanford students as well.
The most recent death threa
against Coronell. news director o
Noticias Uno on the TV station
Canal Uno in Bogota and a week
ly columnist for the Colombian
magazine Semana, was delivered
in the form of a burial wreath on
May 16. Prior to receiving the
funeral wreaths, he got unidenti
fied phone calls threatening to
kill him and his family on April 24
and May 14.
Threats against Coronoll began
three years ago after he aired a
report on Canal Uno that alleged
that ties existed between then presi
dential candidate Alvaro Uribe
Velez and Colombia's drug cartels.
After broadcasting the report on
April 21, he received anonymous
phone calls threatening to kill him
and his daughter on April 22 and 23

of 2002.
In response to the threats
against Coronell and his colleagues,
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe
vowed to support freedom of the
press.
"Democratic Security is a policy
that guarantees the safety of all our
citizens, whatever their ideology, pol
itics or religious beliefs," Uribe said
in a speech to the International
Federation of Journalists.
However, despite the president's
public announcement and the gov
ernment's protection, the serious
death threats against Coronell and
his family have compelled them to
leave the country. Coronell is expect
ed to continue to work for Semana in
the United States where the safety of
his family should be thoroughly
ensured, according to the Stanford
News Service.
Coronells' case epitomizes the
precarious state of journalism in
Colombia. According to the CPJ.
threats against journalists are typical
in Colombia, which ranks as one of
the five most dangerous countries
for journalists.
