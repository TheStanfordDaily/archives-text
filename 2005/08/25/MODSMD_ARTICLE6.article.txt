# Profs examine voting accuracy
## Stanford and peers given $7.5 million to investigate electronic voting systems

The National Science Foundation, an inde
pendent federal agency devoted to researching
and developing the sciences, recently granted
$7.5 million to a group of five universities and
one nonprofit research organization, enabling
them to collectively study the reliability of
electronic voting system.
The grant, announced on Aug. 15, will be
used to fund a project called ACCURATE, or,
A Center for Correct, Usable, Reliable,
Auditable and Transparent Elections, said
David Dill, professor of computer science and
one of the participants in the project.
ACCURATE will be based at Johns
Hopkins University, according to the Stanford
News Service. Johns Hopkins University will
receive $1.2 million over five years for the vot
ing center, according to an Aug. 16 article in
the Baltimore Sun. The remaining funds will
go to the five other institutions.
The other participating universities are
Stanford; UC Berkeley; the University of
Iowa; and Rice University, and the nonprofit
research organization involved in the effort is
SRI International, based in Menlo Park.
Avi Rubin, professor of computer science
at Johns Hopkins University and technical
director at the University's Information

Security Institute, was chosen to head up the
center.
The project focuses on making voting sys
tems more reliable. Dill said. Dan Boneh,
associate professor of computer science at
Stanford, is also conducting research for
ACCURATE.
"The research will target the fundamental
barriers to making voting systems more trust
worthy," Dill told The Stanford Weekly.
"Professor Boneh's area of study is computer
security and cryptography, while my area is
formal verification â€” proving that systems do
what they are supposed to do. These are both
central to making systems trustworthy.
Obviously, a system will not be trustworthy if
someone has broken into it, or can read or fab
ricate data."
Some of the experts conducting research
for ACCURATE will study the psychological
practicality of electronic voting systems by
working with volunteers.
"The main application of psychology is
usability," Dill said. "A huge problem with
voting technology has been voter errors and
confusion. Many of the problems of Florida in
the 2(XX) election, including the butterfly bal
lot, are usability problems. Those problems
aren't unique to Florida. They happen in every
election with every type of equipment."
The project has funds to last five years,
which covers the 2008 presidential elections in
the U.S. But participants in ACCURATE say
their research may affect elections after 2008
more than the 2008 elections themselves.
"We might have some impact, but we're
conducting long-term research, and it takes
quite a long time for new technology to make
it into polling places," Dill said.
