## Sketch Crash 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
I'm tapping out this week's masterpiece with
some difficulty. Sadly my laptop took a beating
last Thursday.
Said beating was not the result of having
been laid about by a gang of burly thugs,
but rather was a consequence of my driving
abilities.
1 was happily trundling up to the city when 1
and the traffic in front of me had a violent dis
agreement about stopping distances.

My darling Emmy took
the brunt of the damage and
appears to be in desperate
need of either drastic cos
metic surgery or euthanasia.
I've been barely able to
sleep as I've contemplated
the brutish fashion in which
her cute little pop-up head
lights were wrenched from
their sockets...
Sadly, in addition to the

guilt from the dreadful damage I have inflicted
on the dearest young(ish) lady in my life, I also
have to deal with the fact that I no longer have a
way to get from point A to point B.
Now, since Stanford is a smallish place, one
might think that there is no need to panic. After
all. even if one shies away from two-wheeled
transport, it's possible to get pretty much any
where on foot without breaking a sweat.
Of course, as further proof of the infinite wis
dom of God, 1 no longer live on campus.
Instead of crashing my car back when it was
a luxury item, I did the totalling just when I was
really starting to need it. Yes. that's right; I am
now a San Franciscan.
In fact, for this week's column I had planned
to develop a convenient bullet-point list of all
the crazy fun things I did during my first week
end in the city. Actually, so excited was I at my
new situation, in somewhat of a break from tra

dition. I thought 1 might even be positive about
life.
Luckily for the schadenfreude aficionados,
though, that's not going to happen.
All the same I'd rather not taint the fine
town of San Francisco by moaning just yet. so
I'm afraid tales of the city will have to wait.
Instead, since my head is full of nothing but
cars, crashes and consequences, further
dwelling on last Thursday's incident is the order
of the week.
I've only been driving for about a year. I
stopped attempting to get my license back in
England after my second test failure at the ten
der age of 18. Despite my limited experience on
U.S. roads, though. I swiftly fell into the trap of
believing 1 knew what I was doing.
I like to think I'm not alone in this particu
lar error of judgement (which is a rather com
mon one in the academic realm too). The mis
conception of competence is not only preva
lent. but also extraordinarily painful when
shattered.
After the event, you can fret not only about
the horrible consequences of disaster and the
ease with which it could have been prevented,
but also about the hubris.
Hubris is more often a fault of youth and ear
lier achievers; it should be a quality that is tem
pered as the years pass. This used to be a cheer
ing note; after all if one could maintain a little
overconfidence, perhaps old age has not de
scended yet.
Now, however, the last remaining vestiges of
arrogance are vanishing. First the illusion of af
fable sociability is dispelled, then that of acade
mic prowess and now invincibility on the road.
Leaving one with the depressing thought that
not only are you talent deficient, but there is
also little chance of convincing anyone of the
contrary.
