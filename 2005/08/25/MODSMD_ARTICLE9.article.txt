Iraq protests unlike Vietnam era
A July 27 USA Today / CNN / Gallup Poll
shows that a majority of Americans doubts the
United States will win the war in Iraq. A ma
jority also believes the Bush administration de
liberately misled the country over Iraq's
weapons capabilities.
It was the first poll to find that 51 percent of
Americans believed the administration was de
liberately misleading about Iraq having
weapons of mass destruction.
Meanwhile parents of soldiers killed in Iraq
are following President George W. Bush around
the country hoping to generate nationwide anti
war sentiment.
Sue Niederer founded with Cindy Sheehan
and other families of dead soldiers the group
known as "Gold Star Families for Peace."
She stated "We are going to be continuously
on Mr. Bash and make him understand we are
not going away. We are very, very steadfast in
what we doing."
She said of George Bush and the Xerox
speech he has been giving, "You are dishonoring
the soldiers, you are not honoring them."
She asked, "Given the reasons for why we went
into this war, why have their deaths not been in
vain?"

She also stated, "This is Vietnam No. 2. As
we are seeing in the polls, the American people
are beginning to realize this war was created on
lies, deceit and deception."
It has been reported that Stanford University
Political Science Professor and Hoover Institu
tion Senior Fellow Morris Fiorina said to make a
Vietnam-style nationwide protest against the
Iraq conflict will be almost impossible without a
draft to focus dissent.
"If you had a draft, you would affect every
body and break beyond the usual protesters."
Fiorina was quoted.
