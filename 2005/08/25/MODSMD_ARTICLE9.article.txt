Iraq protests unlike Vietnam era
A July 27 USA Today / CNN / Gallup Poll
shows that a majority of Americans doubts the
United States will win the war in Iraq. A ma
jority also believes the Bush administration de
liberately misled the country over Iraq's
weapons capabilities.
It was the first poll to find that 51 percent of
Americans believed the administration was de
liberately misleading about Iraq having
weapons of mass destruction.
Meanwhile parents of soldiers killed in Iraq
are following President George W. Bush around
the country hoping to generate nationwide anti
war sentiment.
Sue Niederer founded with Cindy Sheehan
and other families of dead soldiers the group
known as "Gold Star Families for Peace."
She stated "We are going to be continuously
on Mr. Bash and make him understand we are
not going away. We are very, very steadfast in
what we doing."
She said of George Bush and the Xerox
speech he has been giving, "You are dishonoring
the soldiers, you are not honoring them."
She asked, "Given the reasons for why we went
into this war, why have their deaths not been in
vain?"

She also stated, "This is Vietnam No. 2. As
we are seeing in the polls, the American people
are beginning to realize this war was created on
lies, deceit and deception."
It has been reported that Stanford University
Political Science Professor and Hoover Institu
tion Senior Fellow Morris Fiorina said to make a
Vietnam-style nationwide protest against the
Iraq conflict will be almost impossible without a
draft to focus dissent.
"If you had a draft, you would affect every
body and break beyond the usual protesters."
Fiorina was quoted.

America needs to reevaluate role in Israel-
Palestine conflict
Because Palestinian patience has reached its
limits with Israelis' refusal to abide by the unen
forced U.N. Resolution No. 242 — now over 32-
years-old — in which virtually the whole world.

Ask the Palestinians who are being
tear-gassed by American-made chem
icals, shot by American weapons and
bombed by American missiles how
peaceful the United States really is.
The Israelis have killed many innocent
Palestinians and the United States has
supplied the arms for their slaughter.
If the United States would export
half as much peace as it does weapons
— working on feeding the p<x>r. cloth
ing the needy and providing jobs to the
destitute — then it would make the
world a far better place.

Televangelists wield unduly
influence
Religious fanaticism is spreading
like wild fire, engulfing innocent vic
tims in its wake. We now have our very
own homegrown religious mula, none
other than Christian televangelist Pat

including America, agreed that Israel
should withdraw from Palestinian
lands.
America mast persuade Israel to
withdraw or America will get no more
oil from the Arabs. America will never
force Israel to do this and her economy
will collapse without the oil. The Pales
tinian-Israeli War is an American War
with American-Jewish soldiers fight
ing with weapons for the American
territory of an American colony — Is

Robertson, who has set off an interna
tional firestorm when he issued a fatwa
calling for the assassination of
Venezuela's democratically-elected
president Hugo Chavez on his pro
gram "The 7(X) Club." Robertson's lat
est peccadillo exposes the extremely
dangerous influence of the Christian
Coalition on our public policy.
It is extremely telling that President
George W. Bush has chosen to remain
silent on this issue and by doing so
seems to approve of Robertson's ranti
ng. One am only speculate the public
outcry that would occur if a Muslim re
ligious leader had issued a similar de
cree against Bush or Tony Blair. Reli
gious institutions should publicly con
demn the actions of Robertson.
Robertson's outrageous statement is a
message from Satan, not a loving God
whom Robertson claims to represent. It
hardly seems likely that God is interest
ed in the geopolitics of our unhealthy
addiction to Venezuela's rich oil supply.
