## Volleyball turns in strong showing in Omaha 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
The first weekend of preseason volleyball
was a mixed bag for the defending national
champion Cardinal, who finished second at the
AVCA/NACWAA Collegiate Volleyball
Showcase in Omaha, Neb. The tournament
featured four of the top five teams in the na
tion and was billed as a Final Four preview.
Stanford proved to be worthy of the team's

third-place ranking in the preseason poll and
showed the potential to challenge once again
for the top spot.
The 2005 season kicked off with an im
promptu serenade in a restaurant on the
team's first night in Omaha when the men's
soccer team — in town for games of their
own — surrounded the players' table and
belted out "You Are the Champions" to the
tune of Queen's rock anthem, followed by a
rollicking "Happy Birthday" for junior mid

die blocker Jen Wilson, who turned 20 on
Wednesday.
On the court Friday and Saturday, the rela
tively young Stanford squad proved to already
be poised and mature competitors and saw
stand-out performances from both veterans
and newcomers, despite being without last
year's leader — the phenomenally talented
Ogonna Nnamani — and with the Cardinal's
top returning blocker, junior Lizzie Suiter, on
the bench nursing an ankle injury.
The Cardinal reached the championship
match of the four-team tournament with a
hard-fought victory over No. 5 Penn State in
the tournament opener. After controlling the
match early — winning the first two games
both by scores of 30-24 — Stanford's offense
sputtered in the next two games, allowing the
Nittany Lions to tie up the match at two games
apiece and force a decisive fifth game. The
Cardinal offense rebounded in the clutch and
Penn State slumped, giving Stanford the 30-24,
30-24,28-30,23-30,15-10 victory.
Playing in the first match of her collegiate
career Friday, incoming freshman outside hit
ter Cynthia Barboza lived up to the hype which
has surrounded her arrival on the Farm. The
2004-2005 Girl's Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year (given to the top fe
male athlete across all sports), Volleyball
Magazine's 2004 High School Player of the
Year and two-time Gatorade Volleyball Play
er of the Year, Barboza led the Stanford of
fense with 22 kills — 13 in the first two games
alone — on .362 hitting along with 12 digs, a
service ace, and two solo blocks. Barboza's
powerful hitting and intense presence on the
court belied her newcomer status as she
demonstrated the poise and intelligent play
which she developed in her time training and
playing with the US national team over the last
year and a half.
Fellow freshman Foluke Akinradewo, a
middle blocker with three years of experience
with the US junior national team despite hav
ing picked up volleyball as a sophomore in
high school, also had an impressive collegiate
debut Friday with 16 kills and a team-leading
four blocks.
Converted to the right side after being a
sparingly used back-up outside hitter, junior
Nji Nnamani more than doubled her previous
career-high with 13 kills and contributed two
blocks despite being several inches shorter
than the outside hitters she faced.
Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards, a
Volleyball Magazine Ail-American who spent
her summer as a starter on the national team,
finished the match with an ace, three blocks
and 14 kills, hitting error-free until the mid
point of the third game.
Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe, who made
history last year as the first freshman setter to
take her team to a national championship,
skillfully dished out the ball, tallying 64 assists
to go along with five kills, 10 digs, and two ser
vice aces.
Senior libero Courtney Schultz, a 6-foot-1
middle blocker who changed positions while in
college on the strength of her passing, led the
team with 21 digs, tying her career high.
Penn State challenged the Cardinal
throughout the match, paced by Nicole Faw
cett and Cassy Salyer with 17 kills each.
Christa Harmotto added 14 kills and led the
team with five blocks. Stanford was able to
hold on for victory nevertheless, out-hitting
the Nittany Lions in the fifth game to earn a
spot in the final match against top-ranked Ne-

braska, who swept No. 4 Hawaii in
three games Friday night.
Playing in front of 10,576 vocal
fans (the second-highest attendance
ever fora Stanford volleyball
match), the vast majority of whom
were supporting the home team, the
Cardinal struggled early against the
Cornhuskers, falling 30-23 in the first
game. Stanford came out fighting at
the beginning of the second but
could not hold on. as Nebraska
snatched the game 31 -29 after seeing
the score tied 20 times.
With a two-game lead, Nebraska
came out swinging in game three,
leading by as much as six. Stanford
clawed back to tie the game at 25-25,
hut fell short again, losing 33-31 on
an ace by Nebraska's Jordan Larson.
Though the match ended in three
games, the teams were closely
matched and the Cardinal made Ne
braska earn the victory.
"We didn't doubt ourselves,
that's for sure," Richards said.
"We're a fighting team, and we did a
good job of that tonight."
Richards led the way for the Car
dinal with 13 kills, 10 digs, two blocks
and the team's only ace. Barboza,
who was frustrated early on by the
large block of Nebraska, came alive
at the end of the match, finishing
with 12 kills, eight digs and a solo
block. The two outside hitters were
both chosen to the All-Tournament
Team for their performances.
Akinradewo had another good
night Saturday, posting 12 kills and a
team-leading four blocks. Girard
posted the team's highest hitting per
centage, hitting .353 with 10 kills.
Kehoe was in on three blocks, tallied
10 digs and dished out 50 assists.
Schultz led Stanford's defensive ef
fort for the second night in a row, fin
ishing the match with 15 digs.
Nebraska, the top seed in last
year's postseason who returned all of
its starters this fall, overpowered the
Cardinal behind 15 kills each from
Larson and Tournament MVP
Christina Houghtelling. Melissa
Elmer was the best among several
big blockers on the Huskers squad,
finishing with 10. Nebraska out
blocked the much smaller Cardinal
14-7. Outside hitter Jennifer Saleau
mua, who went down with a twisted
ankle at the end of the first game,
shook off the effects of her injury to
lead the team with 17 digs.
"Nebraska is a tough team to
play," head coach John Dunning
said. "We just hope to learn from
what we experienced tonight and do
a little better next time we see them
down the road. 1 think Nebraska has
a great chance to be in the Final
Four. That's where we hope to be.
We showed that we are not too far
behind."
With Suiter recovering and the
team improving individually and as a
group every day, the Cardinal has a
good chance of seeing the Huskers at
the finals in San Antonio, Texas, in
December. Next up for Stanford,
however, is a slew of East Coast chal
lengers. The team travels east this
weekend to face Syracuse, Maine
and host Boston College in tourna
ment play, visits New Hampshire for
a mid-week battle, and will finish the
two-week road trip against Mar
quette, Creighton and Colorado in
Boulder.

featured four of the top five teams in the na
tion and was billed as a Final Four preview.
Stanford proved to be worthy of the team's

third-place ranking in the preseason poll and
showed the potential to challenge once again
for the top spot.
The 2005 season kicked off with an im
promptu serenade in a restaurant on the
team's first night in Omaha when the men's
soccer team — in town for games of their
own — surrounded the players' table and
belted out "You Are the Champions" to the
tune of Queen's rock anthem, followed by a
rollicking "Happy Birthday" for junior mid

die blocker Jen Wilson, who turned 20 on
Wednesday.
On the court Friday and Saturday, the rela
tively young Stanford squad proved to already
be poised and mature competitors and saw
stand-out performances from both veterans
and newcomers, despite being without last
year's leader — the phenomenally talented
Ogonna Nnamani — and with the Cardinal's
top returning blocker, junior Lizzie Suiter, on
the bench nursing an ankle injury.
The Cardinal reached the championship
match of the four-team tournament with a
hard-fought victory over No. 5 Penn State in
the tournament opener. After controlling the
match early — winning the first two games
both by scores of 30-24 — Stanford's offense
sputtered in the next two games, allowing the
Nittany Lions to tie up the match at two games
apiece and force a decisive fifth game. The
Cardinal offense rebounded in the clutch and
Penn State slumped, giving Stanford the 30-24,
30-24,28-30,23-30,15-10 victory.
Playing in the first match of her collegiate
career Friday, incoming freshman outside hit
ter Cynthia Barboza lived up to the hype which
has surrounded her arrival on the Farm. The
2004-2005 Girl's Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year (given to the top fe
male athlete across all sports), Volleyball
Magazine's 2004 High School Player of the
Year and two-time Gatorade Volleyball Play
er of the Year, Barboza led the Stanford of
fense with 22 kills — 13 in the first two games
alone — on .362 hitting along with 12 digs, a
service ace, and two solo blocks. Barboza's
powerful hitting and intense presence on the
court belied her newcomer status as she
demonstrated the poise and intelligent play
which she developed in her time training and
playing with the US national team over the last
year and a half.
Fellow freshman Foluke Akinradewo, a
middle blocker with three years of experience
with the US junior national team despite hav
ing picked up volleyball as a sophomore in
high school, also had an impressive collegiate
debut Friday with 16 kills and a team-leading
four blocks.
Converted to the right side after being a
sparingly used back-up outside hitter, junior
Nji Nnamani more than doubled her previous
career-high with 13 kills and contributed two
blocks despite being several inches shorter
than the outside hitters she faced.
Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards, a
Volleyball Magazine Ail-American who spent
her summer as a starter on the national team,
finished the match with an ace, three blocks
and 14 kills, hitting error-free until the mid
point of the third game.
Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe, who made
history last year as the first freshman setter to
take her team to a national championship,
skillfully dished out the ball, tallying 64 assists
to go along with five kills, 10 digs, and two ser
vice aces.
Senior libero Courtney Schultz, a 6-foot-1
middle blocker who changed positions while in
college on the strength of her passing, led the
team with 21 digs, tying her career high.
Penn State challenged the Cardinal
throughout the match, paced by Nicole Faw
cett and Cassy Salyer with 17 kills each.
Christa Harmotto added 14 kills and led the
team with five blocks. Stanford was able to
hold on for victory nevertheless, out-hitting
the Nittany Lions in the fifth game to earn a
spot in the final match against top-ranked Ne-

three games Friday night.
Playing in front of 10,576 vocal
fans (the second-highest attendance
ever fora Stanford volleyball
match), the vast majority of whom
were supporting the home team, the
Cardinal struggled early against the
Cornhuskers, falling 30-23 in the first
game. Stanford came out fighting at
the beginning of the second but
could not hold on. as Nebraska
snatched the game 31 -29 after seeing
the score tied 20 times.
With a two-game lead, Nebraska
came out swinging in game three,
leading by as much as six. Stanford
clawed back to tie the game at 25-25,
hut fell short again, losing 33-31 on
an ace by Nebraska's Jordan Larson.
Though the match ended in three
games, the teams were closely
matched and the Cardinal made Ne
braska earn the victory.
"We didn't doubt ourselves,
that's for sure," Richards said.
"We're a fighting team, and we did a
good job of that tonight."
Richards led the way for the Car
dinal with 13 kills, 10 digs, two blocks
and the team's only ace. Barboza,
who was frustrated early on by the
large block of Nebraska, came alive
at the end of the match, finishing
with 12 kills, eight digs and a solo
block. The two outside hitters were
both chosen to the All-Tournament
Team for their performances.
Akinradewo had another good
night Saturday, posting 12 kills and a
team-leading four blocks. Girard
posted the team's highest hitting per
centage, hitting .353 with 10 kills.
Kehoe was in on three blocks, tallied
10 digs and dished out 50 assists.
Schultz led Stanford's defensive ef
fort for the second night in a row, fin
ishing the match with 15 digs.
Nebraska, the top seed in last
year's postseason who returned all of
its starters this fall, overpowered the
Cardinal behind 15 kills each from
Larson and Tournament MVP
Christina Houghtelling. Melissa
Elmer was the best among several
big blockers on the Huskers squad,
finishing with 10. Nebraska out
blocked the much smaller Cardinal
14-7. Outside hitter Jennifer Saleau
mua, who went down with a twisted
ankle at the end of the first game,
shook off the effects of her injury to
lead the team with 17 digs.
"Nebraska is a tough team to
play," head coach John Dunning
said. "We just hope to learn from
what we experienced tonight and do
a little better next time we see them
down the road. 1 think Nebraska has
a great chance to be in the Final
Four. That's where we hope to be.
We showed that we are not too far
behind."
With Suiter recovering and the
team improving individually and as a
group every day, the Cardinal has a
good chance of seeing the Huskers at
the finals in San Antonio, Texas, in
December. Next up for Stanford,
however, is a slew of East Coast chal
lengers. The team travels east this
weekend to face Syracuse, Maine
and host Boston College in tourna
ment play, visits New Hampshire for
a mid-week battle, and will finish the
two-week road trip against Mar
quette, Creighton and Colorado in
Boulder.

champion Cardinal, who finished second at the
