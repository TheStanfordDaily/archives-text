## Volleyball turns in strong showing in Omaha 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
The first weekend of preseason volleyball
was a mixed bag for the defending national
champion Cardinal, who finished second at the
AVCA/NACWAA Collegiate Volleyball
Showcase in Omaha, Neb. The tournament
featured four of the top five teams in the na
tion and was billed as a Final Four preview.
Stanford proved to be worthy of the team's

third-place ranking in the preseason poll and
showed the potential to challenge once again
for the top spot.
The 2005 season kicked off with an im
promptu serenade in a restaurant on the
team's first night in Omaha when the men's
soccer team — in town for games of their
own — surrounded the players' table and
belted out "You Are the Champions" to the
tune of Queen's rock anthem, followed by a
rollicking "Happy Birthday" for junior mid

die blocker Jen Wilson, who turned 20 on
Wednesday.
On the court Friday and Saturday, the rela
tively young Stanford squad proved to already
be poised and mature competitors and saw
stand-out performances from both veterans
and newcomers, despite being without last
year's leader — the phenomenally talented
Ogonna Nnamani — and with the Cardinal's
top returning blocker, junior Lizzie Suiter, on
the bench nursing an ankle injury.
The Cardinal reached the championship
match of the four-team tournament with a
hard-fought victory over No. 5 Penn State in
the tournament opener. After controlling the
match early — winning the first two games
both by scores of 30-24 — Stanford's offense
sputtered in the next two games, allowing the
Nittany Lions to tie up the match at two games
apiece and force a decisive fifth game. The
Cardinal offense rebounded in the clutch and
Penn State slumped, giving Stanford the 30-24,
30-24,28-30,23-30,15-10 victory.
Playing in the first match of her collegiate
career Friday, incoming freshman outside hit
ter Cynthia Barboza lived up to the hype which
has surrounded her arrival on the Farm. The
2004-2005 Girl's Gatorade National High
School Player of the Year (given to the top fe
male athlete across all sports), Volleyball
Magazine's 2004 High School Player of the
Year and two-time Gatorade Volleyball Play
er of the Year, Barboza led the Stanford of
fense with 22 kills — 13 in the first two games
alone — on .362 hitting along with 12 digs, a
service ace, and two solo blocks. Barboza's
powerful hitting and intense presence on the
court belied her newcomer status as she
demonstrated the poise and intelligent play
which she developed in her time training and
playing with the US national team over the last
year and a half.
Fellow freshman Foluke Akinradewo, a
middle blocker with three years of experience
with the US junior national team despite hav
ing picked up volleyball as a sophomore in
high school, also had an impressive collegiate
debut Friday with 16 kills and a team-leading
four blocks.
Converted to the right side after being a
sparingly used back-up outside hitter, junior
Nji Nnamani more than doubled her previous
career-high with 13 kills and contributed two
blocks despite being several inches shorter
than the outside hitters she faced.
Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards, a
Volleyball Magazine Ail-American who spent
her summer as a starter on the national team,
finished the match with an ace, three blocks
and 14 kills, hitting error-free until the mid
point of the third game.
Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe, who made
history last year as the first freshman setter to
take her team to a national championship,
skillfully dished out the ball, tallying 64 assists
to go along with five kills, 10 digs, and two ser
vice aces.
Senior libero Courtney Schultz, a 6-foot-1
middle blocker who changed positions while in
college on the strength of her passing, led the
team with 21 digs, tying her career high.
Penn State challenged the Cardinal
throughout the match, paced by Nicole Faw
cett and Cassy Salyer with 17 kills each.
Christa Harmotto added 14 kills and led the
team with five blocks. Stanford was able to
hold on for victory nevertheless, out-hitting
the Nittany Lions in the fifth game to earn a
spot in the final match against top-ranked Ne-
