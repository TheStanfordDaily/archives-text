# Sports at the beach, a winning combo
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS SPORTS COLUMNIST 
I'm taking a break from round-the-clock
hurricane coverage to bring you this column.
1 don't want to come across as insensitive to
the Gulf Coast's plight, but the show must go
on. Anyway, we've been watching the video
of the same house underwater for the last
three hours and 1 swear I just heard Fox News
play "Singin" in the Rain."
As 1 sit here on the beach, however, we're
not getting any of that sport-ceasing rain.
Thus, 1 am free to be as active (or lazy) as 1
choose. Since this is about sports, we'll focus
on the active. In addition to the obvious surf
ing and volleyball, the beach has a surprising
ly large number of "sports" available to the
casual vacationer.
Beginning at the deck on the dune and
working my way to the ocean, the first sport to
be found is volleyball, which has its net set at
the very top of the beach. The sand is softest
and deepest here, allowing for the kind of all
out dives and hustle that our game demands
— if by dives you mean bars and hustle you
mean to the fridge...
Most of the game is spent avoiding beer
cans sitting on the"court." I use the term in
quotation marks because the boundaries of
the game are a source of contention. At the*
beginning of the game, "clearly" marked lines
are dug with a heel. Within 10 points, howev
er, the marks of distinction are blurred and
the dispute ensues. There's usually some
yelling and sand kicking (both at people and
on the lines). Luckily, the contests are usually
resolved peaceably by a chug-off. Either that
or one side gets too drunk to care.
Moving closer to the water, we run into
paddleball, which shares many similarities
with volleyball. There are two ways to play
paddleball. One of which is as a one-on-one
game, where the goal is much like four
square, where you try and get the ball down in
your opponent's square. Lines are dug with
the heel again (an essential tool for beach
sports), and the only real rule is that your pad
dle must strike the ball at an angle greater
than 90 degrees with the ground. As you can
imagine, this also leads to some heated de
bates and protractors have been suggested.
The second form of paddle ball is a simple
rally game where the goal is to work with your
partner to keep the ball of the ground for as
many hits as possible. The competition arises
when you set a mark and try to break it. Allow
me to recount an exchange between my
brother and me during a game one afternoon
— we ran our streak to 557, with the high
mark being 558:
Andrew: We got so close. I can't believe
you just botched that last one.
Stephen: I dunno, I just missed it.
Andrew: It looked like you almost
screwed it up on purpose.
Stephen: I did. I didn't want you to have a
piece of the record.
Brotherly love notwithstanding, there's
more to our tour of beach sports. Next as you
make your way to the ocean is skim boarding.
I think it's skim boarding, but I find it more
fitting to call it "skin boarding," because
you're more than likely going to need a graft
afterward. The goal? Toss a thin, waxed piece
of wood onto the crashing waves and jump
on. My ride is usually over before it begins
since this sport is generally not made
for people who weigh more than
Mary Kate Olsen. The board
grounds and 1 keep going, often end
ing up with rocks in my ear and suit.
Finally, we reach the water where
there are three different ways to ride
the waves. First off, you can go with

body boarding, which is exactly as it
sounds. You use your own flesh and
bones to ride the tide. While this is
fun, the longevity of your career as a
body boarder is in jeopardy the first
time you get caught in the break
zone, where the waves both come in
and out. One pummeling from the
wave you don't see coming and
you're done for the day.
Slightly farther into the water and
safer than body boarding is raft rid
ing. In this AARP version of wave

sports, you simply sit on the raft and
let the breaking waves carry you in.
However, there is a bit of danger in
volved in this as well, as there are two
kinds of waves that carry you. Ac
cording to my cousin, there are "lay
me-downs," which are so called be
cause they gently place you on the
beach, and "uh-ohs," so named be
cause "Holy #%&*!" is not allowed
on the family beach.
Finally, farthest out in the water,
you find the king of the beach

sports. Surfers dominate the outer
limits, looking for the biggest waves
that break the farthest from the
coast to catch the biggest rides. Un
fortunately, the Outer Banks of
North Carolina are not exactly
Maverick's, and most of the time
the surfers end up sitting upright on
their boards, slicking back their
long blonde hair and sharing water
polo-esque, profound utterances,
such as "Dude" and "Brah". 1 know
because I do it.
