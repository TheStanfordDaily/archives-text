# Fall Sports Preview
## Gear up for a full season of Cardinal athletics 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
While The Daily takes a break until Wednes
day, Sept. 21, several Stanford sports teams will
play key early-season contests in the upcoming
weeks. With that in mind, here's a preview of all
the early fall sports action.
Women's Volleyball
After a strong showing this past weekend in
Omaha, downing No. 5 Penn State in five sets
and tumbling to top-ranked Nebraska 3-0, John
Dunning's squad will rack up the frequent flier
miles and criss-cross the country to defend Stan
ford's national championship. Over the next
three weeks, the No. 3 Cardinal will face 10 op
ponents in four different states, participating in
tournaments in Boston and Boulder, Co., host
ing a tournament at Stanford, and even squeez
ing in a game at New Hampshire. Despite the ex
tensive travel, the Cardinal figure to finish their
out-of-conference schedule with a stellar record,
as only two of their next 10 opponents place in
the Top 25: No. 15 UC-Santa Barbara and No. 23
St. Mary's.
Men's Soccer
After eking out one-goal exhibition wins
against Creighton and Drake, Stanford men's
soccer kicks off its season with six games in the

next few weeks. First on the schedule are four
California squads and Vanderbilt in early-season
contests across the Golden State. Stanford then
returns to the Farm on Sept. 18, in time for its
home opener against San Francisco. The early
highlight for Bret Simon's squad should be a
September 16 visit to No. 21 Santa Clara. Stan
ford lost 2-0 last year to the Broncos, a tradition
al powerhouse in both men's and women's soc
cer.
Women's Soccer
Of all the Stanford fall sports, none face
tougher opponents before school even starts
than No. 14 women's soccer. Before the first
freshman arrives for Orientation, the women
will have already faced seven opponents in three
states. More impressively, four of those oppo
nents — No. 2 North Carolina, No. 6 Texas
A&M, No. 7 Portland and No. 13 Illinois — are
ranked higher than the Cardinal, and Stanford
will not have home-field advantage in any of
those contests. Stanford closes out the month of
September by hosting yet another top opponent.
No. 5 Santa Clara, so head coach Paul Ratcliffe
has to be hoping this tough early season schedule
will pay its dividends as the season unwinds.
Men's Water Polo
The 2004 national runners-up begin the 2005
season by hosting Santa Clara this Sunday, and

UC-Davis and UC-Santa Cruz next weekend.
Stanford will be heavy favorites in all three con
tests, as Stanford beat Santa Clara and UC Davis
by a combined score of 31-12 last year, and UC-
Santa Cruz doesn't appear any tougher. After
the three-game homestand, Stanford will head to
Irvine, Calif, seeking revenge in the SoCal tour
nament. as Southern California beat the Cardi
nal 8-6 in the tournament's title game last season.
Men's Golf
Coming off a fifth-place individual finish in
last year's NCAA Championships, rising sopho
more Rob Grube will lead the men's golf squad
into action at the Tom Lehman Invitational in
Wayzata, Minn, the weekend of Sept. 17. In his
second year as head coach. Conrad Ray looks to
lead the Cardinal upward after the team finished
18th at the NCAA Championships last season.
Ray comes off an exciting summer, as the 1997
Stanford graduate qualified for and played in the
U.S. Open.
Field Hockey
Lesley Irvine's squad was one of the first Car
dinal teams to kick off their season, already
dropping a heartbreaking 2-1 overtime loss to
Miami-Ohio last Saturday and falling to
Delaware last Tuesday, 5-1. The Cardinal will
play another three home games in four days this
weekend, hosting lowa, Syracuse and Michigan
State. Stanford then hits the East Coast for four
games in North Carolina and Maryland the week
of Sept. 7. A Sept. 17 visit to Berkeley will pro
vide a good early measuring stick for this Stan
ford squad: the Cardinal were 0-for-2 in hard
fought contests against the Bears last season.
Football
Walt Harris kicks off his coaching tenure with
two out-of-conference contests: a Sept. 10 sea
son-opener at Navy and a Sept. 17 home-opener
versus UC-Davis. Navy appears to be pretty
evenly matched with Stanford, so how well Stan
ford performs could set the tone for the entire
season. UC-Davis is only a Division I-AA squad,
and should be Stanford's safest bet fora victory
this season.
