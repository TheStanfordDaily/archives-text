bots who look like Asian pop star Faye Wong.
Thankfully, though, the sci-fi angle is a red
herring; it's really just a flight of fancy cooked
up by Mr. Chow (Tony Leung, who might be
my favorite actor in cinema these days), the
mild-mannered pulp fiction writer from
Wong's last movie, "In the Mood for Love"
(one of my favorite films of all time). Those
who saw that film might remember that he
stayed in a hotel room with the number 2046
while conducting a futile romance with a mar
ried woman (Maggie Cheung); the film "2046"
is ostensibly a sequel about the emptiness of
Mr. Chow's life after that affair.
This time he's in room 2047 of a hotel, and
living across the hall (in room 2046) is Ziyi
Zhang, a feisty call-girl who he soon falls in with.
But he is unable to fully commit to her — per
haps due to his previous scars — and what starts
out as a passionate fling degenerates into a bit
ter dissolve. Faye Wong (endearing as ever) also
flits in and out as the hotel owner's daughter, a
woman who befriends Mr. Chow because he
sympathizes with the scandalous relationship
she is conducting with a Japanese businessman.
Close followers of Wong's work — particu
larly "Chungking Express" and "Fallen An
gels" — will know that part of his style comes
from his peculiar method of filmmaking: Wong
constantly has his actors improvise scenes,
often with no script and little instruction, then

builds his movies around particularly poignant
moments he comes across while looking at the
footage. The result is often a vibrant collision of
seemingly random narratives, an amalgam of
moods and tones that somehow seem to simul
taneously capture everything and nothing
about the nature of living.
"2046" has these components as well, with
the added infusion of a surreal sci-fi thread. In
general I'm torn about the use of these futuris
tic scenes. There's something admirably loopy
about trying to stitch B-grade sci-fi right into
the middle of a Wong Kar Wai film — some se
quences are so oddly expansive and empty they
had me thinking of that other numerically

named movie, "2001," or early George Lucas
sound-experimentation art — but I think in
general they get in the way of the other narra
tives which seem a lot more interesting.
As soon as Ziyi Zhang shows up the picture
really kicks into full Wong Kar Wai mode, and
you feel loathe to leave it for some crazy flashing
lights and gaudy space-age costuming. The film
is not quite a sequel either. 1 don't really sense a
continuity between Leung's performance here
and in the previous movie, and one gets the feel
ing that the sequel idea was probably just an af
terthought; once Wong realized his sci-fi epic
was stalling he just tried to cover it up by incor
porating "In the Mood for Love" back into it.
