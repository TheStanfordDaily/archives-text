# Brazilian Girls make good on ecclectic charm
## New York house band goes from backdoor dives to top fives 
### CHRIS HUGHES HOT TREND BEAT REPORTER 
Eight months ago, the Brazilian girls were
nowhere. The four members of the New York
house band — none of whom are Brazilian,
and only one of whom is a woman — had
been hosting late-night jam sessions at New
York's hipster-chic club Nublu for almost two
years. There were no rehearsals, no songwrit

ing sessions, no image brainstorming. And
next to no fans.
That was, until the February 2(X)5 release of
their self-titled album by Verve Records. The
band quickly shot up from next to no-name sta
tus to sold-out shows in American and Euro
pean cities. They've been listed on the much
coveted Best of the Year List at Amazon, and
MSN Music has put them along with other for
merly underground bands like Le Tigre on their
billboards that encourage people to download
something hot and new.
No doubt there's a reason for the hype.
Brazilian Girls have done quite effectively what
a number of groups have been trying to do fora

long-time: mix rhythmic dance beats with the
coolness of lounge music. The sheer breadth of
the sounds packed into the 12-track set is as
tounding. Singer Sabina Sciubba's light, tex
tured voice is interwoven with samples, key
board vamps and the subtle sounds of the dou
ble bass. The tracks range from the slow,
melancholy tones of "Ships in the Night" to the
upbeat dance flavor of "Don't Stop."
At the heart of the music is international
color. Sciubba's words come out (seemingly ef
fortlessly) in four languages — English,
French, Spanish and German — and the
group's members hail from all
corners of the globe, or more
precisely, Italy, Argentina,
Kansas and California. Neither
sex nor the serious are neglected.
The fairly lascivious lyrics of
some songs —"Don't Stop don't
stop, no just keep on going until 1
come" or "Pussy Pussy Pussy
(How much do you need)" —
are spliced between other, more

literary tracks like "Me Gustas
Cuando Callas," in which the
lyrics are the words to a well
known Pablo Neruda poem.
It's important to note that
Brazilian Girls' success isn't to
tally a result of their music. The
fact that Ron Goldstein, chief
executive officer of Verve
Music Group, picked the group
up after a show at Nublu has
helped rocket them to success.
Connections like that will work
fast to move you from a back
room, late-night band in New
York to a band that buzzes on

people's cell phones (yes, you
can now download Brazilian
Girls ring-tones).
As for the worry that ring
tones and billboards might ruin
the group's improvisational, re
laxed-and-cool mentality, the
chances seem fairly slim. Ac
cording to a Boston Globe re
porter, Sciubba was last seen on
stage at Paradise decked out in
"layers of sheer pink and purple
fabric and oversized '80s sun
glasses with a dollar sign on the
right lens." Naturally. What else
would one wear?
