## Kissing the summer fling goodbye 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
It's me, not you. I know you've heard
that one before, but it really is me this
time. Yes, Ms. Sass is pulling the plug on
our summer romance and bidding you,
her faithful reader, adieu. But before I
move on, Roxy would like to impart
some words of wisdom from the depart
ment of disassociation because as a wise
man told her, the end of summer is the
best time to break up. (People are far less
clingy than in the winter).
One of Roxy's favorite break-ups —
that is, the one she finds most frenetically
amusing and is most often involved in - is
calling it quits with the person you didn't
even realize you were dating.
Let's be honest; we've all been there.
You hook up with the hot item at Sigma
Chi's Saturday party, and by Wednesday,
random people are stopping you in White
Plaza to tell you how excited they are for
you and so-and-so. You stop short of,
"Sweet — that's her name!" and assume
some uncharacteristically alert partygoer
saw you two together and jumped to the
wrong conclusion.
Until she shows up on your doorstep
with dinner and a movie on Friday.
Or maybe he's that guy you've always
been friends with and now find yourself
hanging out with a lot. You're enjoying his
company, thinking how great it is that you
can just be friends with a man.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, your
clever cowboy is practically beside himself
enjoying the impending success of his slow
saunter into your heart.
No matter the approach, you eventual
ly find yourself faced with romantic entan
glement. Unable to do the adult thing and
straighten your would-be future spouse
out then and there, you surrender to a lit
tle more pseudo-relationship, and wham
— you have a break-up on your hands.
Don't despair. Whether your imagi
nary coupling came out of a frat party or a
faux friendship, the bottom line is that you
can't let it go on. Of course, breaking up
may not be the most fun way to spend your
Friday dinner, but rest assured that having
next week's new flavor accuse you of phi
landering (on account of having recently
met your "girlfriend") will be far less fun.
That said, don't be a jerk. Refrain from
calling her delusional or telling him it was
just hooking up. Swallow your pride and
just treat it like an actual break-up. You
know how it works: "You're great. This i&
great. But I'm just not at that moment in
my life right now." The discomfort of han
dling it the right way is worth the continu
ing health of your reputation.
In the preceding situation you are in a
hole, in this case you are in a trench. You
went to bed with a prince, woke up with n
frog and decided to date said amphibian, a
likely beneficiary of circumstance. This is
the "it's you" break-up, where you have to
wriggle yourself out of the grips of a person
who is a little crazy, likely enamored and
definitely annoying.
Your hook-up tracked you down —
damn the Facebook — and in a moment
of weakness you agreed to make a public
outing. You survived the movie, and even
managed to make small talk through the
gelato, but somewhere near the end he
caught you off guard with a, "We should
do this again sometime," and you nodded
politely. You go out again...and again.

You've misplayed your hand and found
yoursell in ade facto relationship. But
ever the trooper, you hang out a few
times until he mentions how wonderful
you are for the 27th time, and you want to
poke out your left eye. Even then, you
think about suffering through, especially
when you think about the alternatives out
there. But don't, because soon sitting
alone in a dark room will sound appealing
compared to another dinner and a movie
night with him.
And while he is prostrate-on-the
ground in love with you, it doesn't nec
essarily mean that you should step on
him. The longer you let it the linger, the
more your partner will languish and the
worse you'll feel in the end. But, of
course you're not completely selfless be
cause, as convenient as Mr. Right Now
is, Mr. Right could be waiting fora space
on your dance card.
When you finally work up the courage
to declare your independence, feel free to
recycle the, "It's me, not — you," line, but
pay some charity lip-service to the good
parts of him and your relationship -
whether you want to or not — before you
induct him into your illustrious ex
boyfriend club.
When it comes to the college relation
ship, Ms. Sass has to be honest: 1 just don't
have that much sympathy for you. "That's
a smidge harsh," you're thinking, but bear
with me a moment.
It isn't that I don't value these relation
ships, or that 1 think breaking them up is
easy. Quite the opposite, in fact. The col
lege relationship comes in a wide range of
shapes and sizes, but no matter the variety,
the best long-term fit is almost always a
break-up.
How could that be, Roxy? Well, think
about it. Do you really want to meet the
man or woman you're meant to marry
now, when you're 20 and hanging out on
the Row with those people from freshman
year you still haven't cut loose? Ha.
The senior boyfriend will break up
with his junior girlfriend - that's a done
deal - but the real question is whether
she'll realize what a favor's he's doing
them both. After all, nothing says love
like the gift of an appropriately debauch
erous senior year.
And for the two that are both graduat
ing. but working on opposite coasts, you'll
find your way back to each other when the
time is right. Just don't let the end of your
romance be the end of your friendship.
Unless, of. course, you're in one of those
college relationships for which your
friends took odds on both the hook-up and
the break-up at the same time. In that case,
call it a good time and let it go.
So there you have it — Roxy's parting
look at the ins and outs of the relation
ship, from hook-up to break-up, and
everything in between. As summer
comes to a close and the school year
looms large on the horizon, promise
yourself now that you'll take some time
out fora little love, whether you like it hot
and sexy or sweet and subtle.
And for that moment when you arrive
at the worst break-up of all - the one where
you're in love but know it just can't be, for
whatever reason — remember that every
good marriage is built on at least one won
derful lost love. Timing is everything, and
heartbreak builds character. You have
three weeks to ponder that. See you in
September.
It's me, not you. I know you've heard
that one before, but it really is me this
time. Yes, Ms. Sass is pulling the plug on
our summer romance and bidding you,
her faithful reader, adieu. But before I

poke out your left eye. Even then, you
think about suffering through, especially
when you think about the alternatives out
there. But don't, because soon sitting
alone in a dark room will sound appealing
compared to another dinner and a movie
night with him.
And while he is prostrate-on-the
ground in love with you, it doesn't nec
essarily mean that you should step on
him. The longer you let it the linger, the
more your partner will languish and the
worse you'll feel in the end. But, of
course you're not completely selfless be
cause, as convenient as Mr. Right Now
is, Mr. Right could be waiting fora space
on your dance card.
When you finally work up the courage
to declare your independence, feel free to
recycle the, "It's me, not — you," line, but
pay some charity lip-service to the good
parts of him and your relationship -
whether you want to or not — before you
induct him into your illustrious ex
boyfriend club.
When it comes to the college relation
ship, Ms. Sass has to be honest: 1 just don't
have that much sympathy for you. "That's
a smidge harsh," you're thinking, but bear
with me a moment.
It isn't that I don't value these relation
ships, or that 1 think breaking them up is
easy. Quite the opposite, in fact. The col
lege relationship comes in a wide range of
shapes and sizes, but no matter the variety,
the best long-term fit is almost always a
break-up.
How could that be, Roxy? Well, think
about it. Do you really want to meet the
man or woman you're meant to marry
now, when you're 20 and hanging out on
the Row with those people from freshman
year you still haven't cut loose? Ha.
The senior boyfriend will break up
with his junior girlfriend - that's a done
deal - but the real question is whether
she'll realize what a favor's he's doing
them both. After all, nothing says love
like the gift of an appropriately debauch
erous senior year.
And for the two that are both graduat
ing. but working on opposite coasts, you'll
find your way back to each other when the
time is right. Just don't let the end of your
romance be the end of your friendship.
Unless, of. course, you're in one of those
college relationships for which your
friends took odds on both the hook-up and
the break-up at the same time. In that case,
call it a good time and let it go.
So there you have it — Roxy's parting
look at the ins and outs of the relation
ship, from hook-up to break-up, and
everything in between. As summer
comes to a close and the school year
looms large on the horizon, promise
yourself now that you'll take some time
out fora little love, whether you like it hot
and sexy or sweet and subtle.
And for that moment when you arrive
at the worst break-up of all - the one where
you're in love but know it just can't be, for
whatever reason — remember that every
good marriage is built on at least one won
derful lost love. Timing is everything, and
heartbreak builds character. You have
three weeks to ponder that. See you in
September.
It's me, not you. I know you've heard
that one before, but it really is me this
time. Yes, Ms. Sass is pulling the plug on
our summer romance and bidding you,
her faithful reader, adieu. But before I
move on, Roxy would like to impart
some words of wisdom from the depart
ment of disassociation because as a wise
man told her, the end of summer is the
best time to break up. (People are far less
clingy than in the winter).
One of Roxy's favorite break-ups —
that is, the one she finds most frenetically
amusing and is most often involved in - is
calling it quits with the person you didn't
even realize you were dating.
Let's be honest; we've all been there.
You hook up with the hot item at Sigma
Chi's Saturday party, and by Wednesday,
random people are stopping you in White
Plaza to tell you how excited they are for
you and so-and-so. You stop short of,
"Sweet — that's her name!" and assume
some uncharacteristically alert partygoer
saw you two together and jumped to the
wrong conclusion.
Until she shows up on your doorstep
with dinner and a movie on Friday.
Or maybe he's that guy you've always
been friends with and now find yourself
hanging out with a lot. You're enjoying his
company, thinking how great it is that you
can just be friends with a man.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, your
clever cowboy is practically beside himself
enjoying the impending success of his slow
saunter into your heart.
No matter the approach, you eventual
ly find yourself faced with romantic entan
glement. Unable to do the adult thing and
straighten your would-be future spouse
out then and there, you surrender to a lit
tle more pseudo-relationship, and wham
— you have a break-up on your hands.
Don't despair. Whether your imagi
nary coupling came out of a frat party or a
faux friendship, the bottom line is that you
can't let it go on. Of course, breaking up
may not be the most fun way to spend your
Friday dinner, but rest assured that having
next week's new flavor accuse you of phi
landering (on account of having recently
met your "girlfriend") will be far less fun.
That said, don't be a jerk. Refrain from
calling her delusional or telling him it was
just hooking up. Swallow your pride and
just treat it like an actual break-up. You
know how it works: "You're great. This i&
great. But I'm just not at that moment in
my life right now." The discomfort of han
dling it the right way is worth the continu
ing health of your reputation.
In the preceding situation you are in a
hole, in this case you are in a trench. You
went to bed with a prince, woke up with n
frog and decided to date said amphibian, a
likely beneficiary of circumstance. This is
the "it's you" break-up, where you have to
wriggle yourself out of the grips of a person
who is a little crazy, likely enamored and
definitely annoying.
Your hook-up tracked you down —
damn the Facebook — and in a moment
of weakness you agreed to make a public
outing. You survived the movie, and even
managed to make small talk through the
gelato, but somewhere near the end he
caught you off guard with a, "We should
do this again sometime," and you nodded
politely. You go out again...and again.

You've misplayed your hand and found
yoursell in ade facto relationship. But
ever the trooper, you hang out a few
times until he mentions how wonderful
you are for the 27th time, and you want to
poke out your left eye. Even then, you
think about suffering through, especially
when you think about the alternatives out
there. But don't, because soon sitting
alone in a dark room will sound appealing
