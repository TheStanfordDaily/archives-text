Chinese director / writer / actor Stephen
Chow has established himself as a
be reckoned with — particularly wiHWis
recent submission, "Kung Fu Hustle," the
action-based comedy set in 1940's Shang
hai. The plot is based on the exploits of Sing
(Chow) and his attempts to join the infa
mous and brutal "Axe Gang." Along the
way, he encounters a small village inhabited
by reclusive kung fu masters. While this
might seem to play into formulaic stereo

types typical to all martial arts films,
"Kung Fu Hustle" is hardly cliche.
The film boasts terrific action se
quences and highly stylized camera
work, which is never gratuitous (unlike
some films in the genre, including "The

Matrix"). Rather than numbing the audi

ence with overblown and painfully drawn out
fight sequences, Chow stresses quality over
quantity, blending the absurd with reality. The
humor of the film is found not in its dialogue,
but in the precarious and amusing situations
faced by the characters.
The film's pacing is also key, as Chow elegant
ly walks the fine line between comedy and drama,
never blending the two unintentionally. The

greatest testament to "Rung Fu Hustle" is that it

draws the viewer closer in its melodramatic mo

ments, only to quickly lighten the atmosphere

with a comedic flourish here and there.
