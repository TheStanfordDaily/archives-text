Field named new Jasper Ridge director

Stanford Biology Prof. Christopher
Field has been named faculty director
of Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, a 1,189-acre research area in
the foothills, the Stanford News
Service reported. Field's tasks as direc
tor will include "providing academic
leadership for Jasper Ridge's research,
education and conservation programs"
and creating stronger ties between
the preserve and the University.

Field, an expert in global ecology, became a faculty
member in 1984 and is currently the director of the
Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology.
Jasper Ridge is currently home to 67 research stud
ies, accord to the News Service.
Prof says many students unprepared for
community college
According to a Business Wire press release, Stanford
School of Education professor Michael Kirst has attrib
uted America's low postsecondary school graduation
rate to the lack of preparation high school students
receive for the community college placement test that
exempts students from taking remedial classes.
The press release states that 44 percent of American
undergrads attend community colleges, but less that
half of those students graduate. However, according to
Kirst, most students are unaware that the placement
test even exists and are thus unprepared to take it. The
students are then placed in remedial classes and subse
quently, as Kirst said, "can't handle the work or get dis
couraged and just end up dropping out."
Kirst also noted that many of these students are
minorities or "economically disadvantaged."
Hennessey helps open playing field ceremony
Stanford President John Hennessey broke ground in
an Aug. 30 ceremony commemorating impending con
struction of Palo Alto community soccer fields on
University-owned land, according to The Stanford
Report. Palo Alto Mayor Jim Burch and Councilman
Vic Ojakian joined Hennessey at the event.
The two playing fields and a smaller practice field
will cover 6 acres around El Camino Real and Page Mill
Road, The Report stated. In a move aimed at improv
ing collaboration between Stanford and Palo Alto, the
University will lease the land to the community for only
$1 a year for the next 51 years. Palo Alto has already
presented Stanford with a $51 check.
Students to appear in fall TV premier
Four Stanford engineering graduate students will
appear in the premiere of Animal Planet's television series
"Chasing Nature," the Stanford News Service reported.
The students, Alfonso Pulido, David Lu, Mark Bianco
and Leslie Oley, and all show participants were charged
with the task of creating a human-sized replica of a physi
cal characteristic of an animal, the News Service explained.
Viewers will have to wait until the episode is aired
during the fall to check in on the group's success.
Study shows that women also go after
looks in speed dating
A study conducted by Stanford Business Prof.
Itamar Simonson and researchers from other universi
ties demonstrates that women most often choose mates
based on physical attractiveness, according to an article
in The Stanford Report.
During the study, the researchers observed speed
dating situations and found that women who were inter
ested in dating male partners were largely motivated to
do so based on the male's level of physical attractiveness.
The News Service reported that the study comes in
response to similar research claiming that women look for
intelligence in men over good looks, whereas men base
their decisions almost solely on outward appearance.
