# Students innovate secure e-mail program
## Cipher Mail startup could solve several e-mail glitches 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Maybe e-mail security doesn't keep
most college students up at night, but it
certainly is on the minds of five Stanford
Students this summer. In fact, they have
taken it a step further, spending the last
three months trying to find solutions to the
imperfections of modern e-mail systems.
"Sending an e-mail is like sending a
postcard" goes the saying in the internet
security community. Your e-mails are so
insecure in fact, that just about any one
can read the e-mail you have sent from
any program. Webmail, Outlook, Gmail
or otherwise.
According to rising junior Chris
Pedregal, this is one of many problems
that "Ciphermail," the temporary name
for the group project, aims to fix. The
founder and leader of the project,
Pedregal came up with the idea last year
during a casual conversation about the
power of technology and its potential to
change the world.
Despite his love for high-tech gadgets,
he found that one of the most basic sys
tems we rely on every day has very serious
flaws.
"People have to deal with SPAM all the
time," in addition to security issues,
Pedregal told The Daily.
"There is no way to know if your mes
sage has been read once you send it; it
could have gotten lost along the way or
thrown out by the spam filter," he added.
Phishing attacks present another major
problem. Hackers can create e-mails that

look like they're from a bank or another
company seeking important information.
They'll direct the user to a Web site that
looks just like the company's real site in
order to get credit card, bank account and
other sensitive data.
Though there are efforts to tackle these
problems individually, Ciphermail has
made it a goal to create one program that
can incorporate all new security measures
at once and come as part of a user's pre
existing e-mail system or client. Ideally,
one result of Ciphermail's work would be
a "send securely" button that would
address multiple issues at a time, yet still
operate simply, Pedregal said.
"We don't want to create a program
that solves one problem or that just patch
es things up," he added. "A lot of compa
nies are working on these, but it's a pain to
get them to work, so no one uses them. We
want an overall, complete and easy-to-use
service for safe and reliable e-mail.''
The project started out tackling basic e
mail problems, and lacking any other sum
mer plans, Pedregal and his friends decid
ed to take a leap of faith and pursue the
nagging question: "Is there a better way to
send e-mail?"
"I lucked out," Pedregal said. "My
friends knew exactly what we needed to
build this thing."
As of now, their plan is to develop a
beta version soon which would allow users
to try the program, find bugs and provide
feedback on setup and usability. They will
approach local venture capitalists for
funding before school starts and hopefully
launch the company in the fall, Pedregal
said.
Rising senior Max Mednik, a computer
science major and materials science and
engineering coterminal student who man
ages the business aspect of the project,

estimates that every team member con
tributes at least five to 10 hours to the pro
ject everyday.
"Some weeks I've put in up to 60
hours," said rising junior Mathew Cowan,
also a computer science major and pro
grammer for the project. "It reminds me of
some Stanford projects I've done."
But the work isn't as overburdening as
it sounds, Pedregal said.
"Its all day everyday because it is some
thing I care about and I want to work on
it,"he said. "It's really not like work â€” it's
fun. which is a nice situation to be in."
Cowan said that he has appreciated the
opportunity to flex his technical creativity.
"I much prefer working on something
like this over the summer than the other
choice I would've had fora summer job,"
he said. "Since we were all friends working
together it has been a lot of fun."
All five of the students involved knew
each other through classes on campus and
became friends before the project began.
"Chris had mentioned the idea to me
and asked if I would be interested in
becoming involved," Cowan said. "I had
always wanted the opportunity to work on
a startup since before I came to Stanford.
I know and trust the capabilities of every
one working on the project and it gave me
confidence in our group."
After committing to the project, the
group rented out a local apartment, got a
few computers and started the summer
designing and building their program.
Cowan, who works from his native
Guatemala, depends on the free internet
telephone service Skype to communicate
with his coworkers.
"The first thing we did was go to Wal-
Mart and buy four white boards just to get
