## Sketch Why wake up? 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM WEEKLY COLUMNIST 
Now, promise not to tell my advis
er, but 1 haven't actually done very
much work over the last couple of
weeks. There are several reasons
(nee excuses) for this. Don't stop
reading though; I'm not going to
bore you with those.
I've been using all the free time
that I've had idly contemplating why
we are here. Obviously the immedi-

ate answer that
sprang to mind was
something about
furthering the glory
of our Lord. But
then I remember
that He hates me.
So, if not to
heaven or hell,
whither are we
wandering as we
tread through the

treacherous turf of graduate school?
Flowery language aside, this is not
an easy question to answer. In fact,
it's not even an easy question to ask.
After all, what does it mean to ask
why?
On some very basic level the ap
propriate response revolves around
career development. Many people
go to graduate school to get a better
job. Apparently you can move even
faster along the McDonalds fast
track program with a Ph.D.
However, while getting a job cer
tainly lies at the heart of pursuing a
vocational qualification, it doesn't do
much more than create further ques
tions for those of us who aren't bud
ding lawyers, medics or businesspeo
ple.
This is not to say that the reason
ing behind spending a few years of
your life in graduate school in order
to score a steady supply of prescrip

tion drugs or dubious criminal char
acters is coherent. But at least there's
money involved.
Outside of these practical pro
grams. the monetary rewards are not
nearly so significant, so one would as
sume that something else lies be
neath.
1 found three broad reasons:
Love, laziness and glory.
Love is the easiest. From a young
age you've tinkered with chemistry
sets and microscopes and do-it-your
self radios while your more active
peers were out on the streets playing
games and making mischief.
When you got to school you
found that whilst you were usually
picked last for the playground soccer
game you could find hitherto un
known solace in the joys of arith
metic. And so it went until you stood
up to collect an undergraduate de
gree in physics with a minor in slight
ly-deficient-social-skills-and-eccen-
tric-behaviour.
The obvious thing to with such
passion is to take it to graduate
school, where it will be slowly beaten
out of you. You see, there is a differ
ence between learning and doing.
The former, at least to those of the
appropriate mindset, is an adven
ture, an exploration.
The latter, on the other hand, is
usually a miserable slog through lines
of code/verse/historical sources.
There is little joy in trying to find the
missing minus sign in a 30-page cal
culation when you're not even sure it
should be there.
Laziness afflicts us all, but fora se
lect few it becomes a raison d'etre.
Some of us really enjoyed under
graduate life. The drinking. The ca
vorting. The late nights. The parties.
The total lack of meaningful respon
sibility. And so on.
With so much to recommend the

student lifestyle, it's no wonder that
many of us seek to extend out care
free days of youth by staying in
school.
Of course, as regular readers may
have figured out, grad school is not so
carefree. Not so much late night ca
vorting as late night lab work. No
matter what you try, the days of
youth will recede with age.
What about glory? Fame and for
tune may wait in many arenas, but for
the average scholar the realms of
professional sports and Hollywood
movie-making are out of reach. And
so we are left searching fora differ
ent kind of renown.

It's a smaller kind for sure, but
one that can often seem at the edge
of your grasp. After all you spend
your days being taught by those who
have ascended the lofty heights of
academic prominence, so why
shouldn't you be able to reach them?
Well, as one swiftly comes to re
alise in the halls of learning, acade
mia is powered by a handful of greats
and legions of grunts. And you, my
friend, are almost certainly going to
be a grunt.
With all this in mind, it seems
clear that love, laziness and glory
should be nothing more than swiftly
dispelled illusions. Which leaves us

still wondering why we continue to
wake up as graduate students?
Regrettably I have no real answer
to that question. All 1 can suggest is
apathy: If you're struggling through
the daily grind of grad school, it's an
awful lot of effort to switch to an al
ternative career just so you can be
miserable doing something else. And
at least in grad school getting out of
bed and into the office doesn't mean
you can't go back to sleep.

Yawn. Have you found meaning and
purpose through your studies? E-mail

crets of your Zen-like state.
