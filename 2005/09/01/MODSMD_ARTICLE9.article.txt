### 
Singh's letter shortsighted and extreme
It is one thing to oppose the policies of the
United States, Great Britain and Israel with re
gard to terrorism. It is another to equate those
policies to terrorism, which is what Jagjit
Singh's letter to the editor of Aug. 4 does. This
extreme left-wing view is an offense to Ameri
cans, Britons and Israelis.
Moreover, Mr. Singh's basis in fact is
seriously flawed. He seems to forget that
Pope John Paul II repeatedly called for
the end of violence in the Middle East and
paid particular attention to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. He also neglects the
fact that since the Sharon government
took a harder stance against terrorism
originating from the Palestinian Territo
ries the combined death rates of Palestini
ans and Israelis declined measurably —
particularly among civilians who were not
involved in terrorist activities on either
side of the ongoing dispute. If Mr. Singh
were to have his way, the Intafada would

still be alive and well and the Palestinian
government would today be led by some
one chosen by Yasser Arafat's unilateral
decree rather than the voice of the Pales
tinian people.
Mr. Singh's arguments do not lead to con
structive dialogue and they do not lead to
finding common ground. They are divisive
and offensive to the substantial majority of
Americans.

Fight against fundamentalism
should be more focused
Jagjit Singh's Aug. 4 letter "Religious leaders
should denounce attacks" states that because
Muslim extremists terrorized England, that "all
religious groups" should condemn "senseless
slaughter" in Iraq and in Palestine. However,
the Fallujah insurgents who are killing Ameri
can troops are Muslim, and members of Hamas

and Islamic Jihad, who are prevented only hv a
wall from massacring Jews in Israel, are all Mus
lim as well. Instead of cloaking Islamic terror
within a mythical pan-religious extremism, why
not identify the Muslim perps and take them
out. thereby freeing the other 300 million-Mus
lims from their fanaticism?

Andrea Runyan's column ("Sex is more
than socialization," published on Aug. 18) is
painful to me. Literally, every word I read
sucks that much more life force from my
emotionally crippled, 21st century male
soul. Her column was a laundry list of irrel
evant information, the kicker being that she
promises to "address these consequences in
a later column in this series." This kind of
unedited pablam is typical of a 16-year-old
girl's blog. Missing are black and white pic
tures of her feet and a link to some obnox

ious quote of the day Web site.

Congratulations to Stanford STAND
We want to commend Stanford STAND on
their successful divestment campaign and ap
plaud the courage of the Stanford Board of
Trustees and their willingness to take an active
stand against the atrocities taking place in Sudan.
Divestment should not be a common prac
tice, but Stanford has correctly identified the
genocide in Darfur as an unusually heinous evil.
