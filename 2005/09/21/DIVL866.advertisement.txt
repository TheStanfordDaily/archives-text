Consumer Alert
Compare Cardinal Care with other health insurance rates
and benefits.
Rates and benefits can vary widely in the Cardinal Care program. You need to com
parison shop for insurance - just like you would for anything else. Cardinal Care is
filled with fine print requiring all students first seek treatment at Vaden Health
Center, or face reduced coverage. Don't be shy about comparing insurance plans and
companies. Here's a short list of some of the questions you should ask.
What is the maximum I would be covered for?
What is the deductible?
How much will this cost - and how does the cost change with different deductibles?
What am I not covered for (for example, some insurance plans
don't cover varsity or even intramural sports injuries)?
Are there restrictions on which physicians I can use?
Do I need a referral to see a specialist?
What if I get sick or hurt while I'm traveling?
Do I need pre-approval from the insurance company
before I can go see a health-care provider?
These are the basics - but don't limit yourself to these questions.
How to find student health insurance
Several insurance providers cater to students (Blue Shield of California, for example).
You should definitely shop around at more than one provider - prices and coverage
can vary tremendously. If you've recently graduated, or plan to graduate in the near
future, you should purchase individual medical insurance rather than student insur
ance. For additional information please contact:
