Welcome to Stanford!
Love cats? We need your help!
The Stanford Cat Network cares
for the homeless and abandoned cats
on Stanford University lands.
We urgently need volunteers to:
• Feed cats on campus
• Foster and socialize our rescued cats and kittens
(only if you're living off-campus in cat-friendly housing)
Contact us at http://catnet.stanford.edu or (650) 566-8287
For students living on campus: please do not adopt or abandon pets!
