The Rise of People Power
I lie Rise of People Power
However much they may iry, politicians and other leaders
find it more and more difficult to control events and to keep
their 'ship of state' on an even keel. They find that, despite
their expertise, it careers helplessly on its own as if under the
guidance of some unseen hand. That unseen hand, of course,
is the logic of change. They fail to understand that the rules
and methods by which they work belong to the past and have
little relevance to the problems and needs of today. They meet
and discuss these problems, but invariably retreat from actions
that alone would solve them. Meanwhile, in varying degrees,
the people suffer, and wait for. reason and insight to alleviate
their distress. They know in their hearts that deliverance is pos
sible and should be theirs, but lack, as yet, the structures and
power to make it so.
Dissent
Not for ever will the people wait. Already, the signs of dis
sent and impatience are appearing across the world, urging the
leaders to engage with their needs and afflictions. The leaders,
men without vision, look to promises and palliatives to halt the
mounting demands lor fairness and justice. They do so in vain.
The peoples of the world have caught the vision of freedom, of
justice, and peace, and will not let it go. They, rather than their
leaders, will outline the future and shape it to their needs.
Thus will it be. This new force in the world — the voice of the
people — is rapidly gaining strength and cohesion and will
play a major role in world affairs from now
Opportunity
Maitreya awaits llis opportunity to augment the power
and influence of the people's voice and to steer its course.
Many are the strands which form it and disparate their aim
Wise must be the guidance, therefore, lest it lose its way and
dissipate its strength.
Single and simple, therefore, must be the demands of
the people. Many and varied are their problems but universal
are their needs: peace through justice and freedom are the
needs of all men. Sharing, Maitreya will advise, is the key to the
creation of trust without which naught is possible Share and
make blessed trust, He will tell the world, and know the bless
ings of justice and peace No other way He will solemnly
remind the nations, will bring them (lie peai e for which in
their hearts they yearn. Thus will it be, and thus will the people
call for sharing and therefore peace. A new and potent world
opinion will demonstrate its power and render obsolete the
manoeuvres and stratagems of the men of power today. Then
will Maitreya declare Himself to all the peoples, and dedicate
Himself to their service throughout this coming time.
