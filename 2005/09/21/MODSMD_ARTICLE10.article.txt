## Summers on Farm, abroad provide new grip on reality 
### 
Miri: I didn't leave Stanford this summer. But
I woke up one morning and Stanford had left
me. As June drew to a close most of the under
graduate population had absconded to more
(Ecuador) or less (Cleveland) distant ports of
call, and I was left on a campus that felt sudden
ly foreign. It was overrun by unknown aspiring
tennis stars and violinists. Everyday 1 saw paral
lel columns of binder-toting "extraordinary
youth." It was hard not to stumble upon serious
conferences of aerospace engineers and prepu
bescent math geniuses. Not much of a change,
some might say. It is true that conversations
between the high schoolers could have been ver
batim extracts from any Saturday night. Still,
there were days when I felt like an undergradu
ate impostor in a world of anonymous talented
teens and pressured graduate students.
Robin: "Don't leave senorita," sobbed the
final 20 kids at our farewell party. I almolt lost it
too, as they wrapped their arms around my back
and buried their cheeks in my stomach. The nine
of us Stanford students were leaving Quito,

Ecuador, where we spent two months running a
summer camp for working kids at Casa de la
Ninez. Everyday at the shelter, we took kids on
field trips to the planetarium, the zoo, swimming
pools, places I had been as a kid, but places most
of them never visit.
As much as we all loved the kids, long meet
ings, stressful workshops and crowded buses
took their toll on us all. How, among all of the
future Emily Dickinsons, Barry Bonds,' Nobel
Prize winners and Everest climbers at Stanford,
did I end up in Quito with these nine people
who simply could not function as a group?
Perhaps because we were playing with kids for
different reasons: to improve our Spanish; to do
community service; to make a difference
abroad; to live up Quito's nightlife. In the end,
Stanford really was all that we had in common,
the only fickle thread tying us together fora
whole summer.
Miri: We may talk about an "intellectual com
munity," but Stanford is also buildings and foun
tains, bookshelves and oak tress and bollards. It
couldn't exist without them. There are days in
the library, studying up on Kant, that I am grate
ful for the six flights of stairs in the Bing Wing to
remind my legs that the world is real.
This summer, I hid from the intimidating 14-
year-old prodigies, doing research in these sur
roundings I know so well. Using the arching bat
tlements of Meyer library as my academic cover,
I saw many a tour come through. At 11:00 a.m.
everyday, a gaggle of parents, high school stu
dents and tourists would round the corner of the
library, nodding their heads as the guide men
tioned the millions of volumes inside. Everyday
I'd hear the guide make the same agile transition
from talk of books into praise of the bevy of will
ing advisors available to (thrust upon) incoming
freshmen. Finally, the group would pause at the
corner of Stern Hall where they would be regaled
with dining plans, housing options and tales of
princeling roommates. Then the dazzled tourists
would turn, passing out of earshot as the list of
Stanford's assets grew ever-longer.
Robin: Every summer since 2002, a group of
Stanford students has volunteered at Casa de la
Ninez. It's a fantastic opportunity, one of those
assets that the school touts to incoming fresh
men as a way to learn outside of the bubble. The
kids in Quito taught me how to "dance regga
ton," then described their jobs shining shoes,
selling gum or cleaning furniture at hotels where
the gringos are rich and don't speak any
Spanish.
I translated "Boom Chicka Boom," my
favorite childhood chant, into Spanish with a flock
of children trailing me and repeating my every
move. The day I lost my voice in Quito, I told the
kids I had swallowed a frog. I spent the next sev
eral days opening my mouth on command when
they all wanted to peer at the frog's legs.
By the end of the summer I could even roll
my r's, quite a feat fora six-year student of the
language. In Quito, Stanford tied our group
together. I may not see my fellow volunteers
much anymore, but now that we're back on cam
pus, we can reunite outside Moonbeans, to remi
nisce about our favorite days of playing soccer
and flying kites in the Andes with Marco,
Santiago, Darwin, Evelyn and all the other kids
that no other Stanford student knows as we do.
Miri: I never heard a tour guide mention the
fruit trees, the figs and European strawberries
and loquats that were ripening over their heads.
The fountains were passed, unpraised. Maybe
they all went unnoted in the sales pitch because
the campus speaks so well for itself. 0h... the
grass is too green, some of the buildings too
ambitious. But still, anywhere else I'd miss the
waves of heat and cold biking in the staccato
shade of the pillars lining the Quad. People
make Stanford my home. But it is sandstone and
tile that build the place I live and know —at
least for one more year.
