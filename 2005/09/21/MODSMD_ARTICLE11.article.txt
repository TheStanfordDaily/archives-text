# road trips from Stanford in hour or less
## 
### 
Expansive as the Stanford campus may be — and
busy bees that we sometimes are — it can be nice
to leave the Farm for the wide world that exists out
side Stanford's palm-tree-lined walkways. The following is a
chronological log of the road-trips I took with a friend this
summer — with destinations boasting driving times of an
hour or less from campus.

The Redwood Room Lounge

Distance and time: Located in
San Francisco, about 32 miles
away from the Oval. Take
Interstate-280 North to the King
Street exit, go left on 3rd, and left
again on Geary Street Drive.
Approximately one hour, includ
ing time to find parking.
If you were to walk by, you
wouldn't know what you were
missing inside The Redwood
Room because there is no indica
tion of its existence on the street.
But we have decided to share this

secret — the lounge is on the cor
ner of Geary and Taylor, inside
the large, unmarked, swinging
doors of the Clift Hotel, across
the street from the Warwick
Hotel.
1 felt as though as was being
watched by the walls in the rich,
red-laden, dark yet glowing room.
Beautiful women in black cock
tail dresses and men in well-tai
lored suits were not the only ones
with their eyes on us. There was
something about the walls ... the

paintings. After 20 minutes, I saw
a figure in a portrait blink and
realized that the art was not
painted from oils, swept smooth
centuries ago. Instead, seven flat
plasma screens stream ghost-like
videos of various characters
watching the observer.
A careful ear will hear five
languages and a trained palate
will enjoy the finest of food and
drink. I cannot speak highly
enough of the chair in The Living
Room.

The Golden Gate Bridge

Distance and time: Also located
in San Francisco, about 55 miles
from the Oval. Take 1-280 North.
Follow signs to Highway 101, which
turns into the Golden Gate Bridge.
Cross the bridge and take the first
exit. Park at the Vista Point.
Approximately 47 minutes... with
pirates at the helm.
First word on our Lady Golden
— and I feel a bit guilty offering this
advice, which I have never taken —
walk it after you park. Don't hesi
tate to walk on the Pacific side, if
the sun is shining and the ocean

isn't blanketed by the famous San
Franciscan fog. Ignore the signs ask
ing you to cross on the opposite
pedestrian side; the yelps from hos
tile bicyclists are worth the sight of
the open, sailboat-free water.
On our visit it was too chilly for
a stroll. Next time, we'll bring some
thing warmer. Stanford entrepre
neurs with a penchant for sweat
shirts, take note of the prospering
industry ... those who cater to naive
tourists do well.
Exiting the Vista Point, go North
on Highway 101, take the Mar

. r ....
Monte exit and follow signs to 101
South. On your way back South,
take the very last exit before the
bridge, which will point you
towards the Headlands. An aban
doned army camp sits atop a hill,
nose to nose with the Golden Gate
towers, offering a sweeping view of
the
city, as well as a spook for those who
venture up the path at night. TVuth
or dare? Dare: play hide and go
seek in the abandoned corridors.
Just over the hill is Chronchite
Beach. Speaking of beaches ...

Half Moon Bay

Distance and time: Take 1-280
North, exit onto 92 West and drive
for about 32 minutes to Half
Moon Bay, about 22 miles north
of the Oval.
I was surprised by how quickly
we arrived at the town of Half
Moon Bay. I would take my books
there and study for an afternoon,
without feeling guilty for wasting
time or petrol. It is a beautiful
drive. Small plant nurseries line
the road and at this time of year
you can purchase pumpkins or

strawberries sold at the end of
small dirt driveways. We bought
ours from an ancient, tattered
Italian named Domenico and
promised to come back soon. But
we haven't yet had the chance. If
you see him, tell him we'll be by in
no time.
We had barely crossed the
San Andreas Fault when we
drove over the wooded hills and
saw the beach. You need not
have a specific plan when ventur
ing to Half Moon Bay. There are

a few very cozy coffee shops in
the downtown area and beaches
at the end of every westerly
road.
When Highway 92 ends at Half
Moon Bay, go South on Highway
1 if you would like to continue to
our next stop — Santa Cruz. On
the way, you will surely notice
intriguing dirt pull-outs on the
beach side of the road. Pull over
when you feel compelled. Climb
out on the cliffside; there lies the
raging sea.

Santa Cruz

Distance and time from Half
Moon Bay: Take Highway 1 South
for about 60 miles, which will take
approximately an hour.
Distance and time from the
Oval: Take 280 South and then
head West on Highway 17 at the
junction. You'll travel about 46
miles, which will take roughly 45
minutes.
The other day we were sitting at
a small cafe in downtown Palo Alto
when an unexpected visitor joined

us for espresso. He was from Santa
Cruz and I think he was not atypical
of the town. From Italy, he was liv
ing on the California coast, surfing
and designing jewelry — he seemed
to me to be quite the epicurean.
And, he invited us dancing — they
do that down there.
This is why we visit Santa Cruz:
For the people. When we got there,
we stopped to listen to a man
named David sing us a half hour's
worth of original love tunes. We

asked him how long he played each
night and he said, "Until I've made
$4."
Also in downtown Santa Cruz
on Pacific Avenue is Chocolate, a
cafe that serves four types of hot
chocolate (we recommend the
Sofia), a hat shop (perfect for the
horse races) and a vintage clothing
store called Cognito at the far end.
The beach culture surrounding
Santa Cruz is magical, not to men
tion the surf.

Skyline Boulevard

Distance and time: Very close.
If you are feeling restless, and
you have a car (or a friend with a
car), it is not difficult to catch a
breath of fresh air off campus. We
are surrounded by hills. Driving
North on 1-280, exit on Highway 92

West and then go left onto Highway
35, commonly known as Skyline
Boulevard. I've heard rumor of bik
ers that make this trek on a regular
basis to admire the winding, wooded
wilderness found there. Some pause
at the bottom of one of the manv

hills to have a relaxed bite at Alice's
Restaurant — you can't miss it.
As an added bonus, on the way
up 1-280 there are two Vista Points
which offer beautiful views of the
pristine and wooded San Andreas
Fault Reservoir.

There is no need to feel claustrophobic while attending school
at Stanford. In case of panic, always leave campus. There is
quiet outside — stars at night and many moons.

doors of the Clift Hotel, across
the street from the Warwick
Hotel.
1 felt as though as was being
watched by the walls in the rich,
red-laden, dark yet glowing room.
Beautiful women in black cock
tail dresses and men in well-tai
lored suits were not the only ones
with their eyes on us. There was
something about the walls ... the

paintings. After 20 minutes, I saw
a figure in a portrait blink and
realized that the art was not
painted from oils, swept smooth
centuries ago. Instead, seven flat
plasma screens stream ghost-like
videos of various characters
watching the observer.
A careful ear will hear five
languages and a trained palate
will enjoy the finest of food and
drink. I cannot speak highly
enough of the chair in The Living
Room.

The Golden Gate Bridge

Distance and time: Also located
in San Francisco, about 55 miles
from the Oval. Take 1-280 North.
Follow signs to Highway 101, which
turns into the Golden Gate Bridge.
Cross the bridge and take the first
exit. Park at the Vista Point.
Approximately 47 minutes... with
pirates at the helm.
First word on our Lady Golden
— and I feel a bit guilty offering this
advice, which I have never taken —
walk it after you park. Don't hesi
tate to walk on the Pacific side, if
the sun is shining and the ocean

isn't blanketed by the famous San
Franciscan fog. Ignore the signs ask
ing you to cross on the opposite
pedestrian side; the yelps from hos
tile bicyclists are worth the sight of
the open, sailboat-free water.
On our visit it was too chilly for
a stroll. Next time, we'll bring some
thing warmer. Stanford entrepre
neurs with a penchant for sweat
shirts, take note of the prospering
industry ... those who cater to naive
tourists do well.
Exiting the Vista Point, go North
on Highway 101, take the Mar

. r ....
Monte exit and follow signs to 101
South. On your way back South,
take the very last exit before the
bridge, which will point you
towards the Headlands. An aban
doned army camp sits atop a hill,
nose to nose with the Golden Gate
towers, offering a sweeping view of
the
city, as well as a spook for those who
venture up the path at night. TVuth
or dare? Dare: play hide and go
seek in the abandoned corridors.
Just over the hill is Chronchite
Beach. Speaking of beaches ...

Half Moon Bay

Distance and time: Take 1-280
North, exit onto 92 West and drive
for about 32 minutes to Half
Moon Bay, about 22 miles north
of the Oval.
I was surprised by how quickly
we arrived at the town of Half
Moon Bay. I would take my books
there and study for an afternoon,
without feeling guilty for wasting
time or petrol. It is a beautiful
drive. Small plant nurseries line
the road and at this time of year
you can purchase pumpkins or

strawberries sold at the end of
small dirt driveways. We bought
ours from an ancient, tattered
Italian named Domenico and
promised to come back soon. But
we haven't yet had the chance. If
you see him, tell him we'll be by in
no time.
We had barely crossed the
San Andreas Fault when we
drove over the wooded hills and
saw the beach. You need not
have a specific plan when ventur
ing to Half Moon Bay. There are

a few very cozy coffee shops in
the downtown area and beaches
at the end of every westerly
road.
When Highway 92 ends at Half
Moon Bay, go South on Highway
1 if you would like to continue to
our next stop — Santa Cruz. On
the way, you will surely notice
intriguing dirt pull-outs on the
beach side of the road. Pull over
when you feel compelled. Climb
out on the cliffside; there lies the
raging sea.

Santa Cruz

Distance and time from Half
Moon Bay: Take Highway 1 South
for about 60 miles, which will take
approximately an hour.
Distance and time from the
Oval: Take 280 South and then
head West on Highway 17 at the
junction. You'll travel about 46
miles, which will take roughly 45
minutes.
The other day we were sitting at
a small cafe in downtown Palo Alto
when an unexpected visitor joined

us for espresso. He was from Santa
Cruz and I think he was not atypical
of the town. From Italy, he was liv
ing on the California coast, surfing
and designing jewelry — he seemed
to me to be quite the epicurean.
And, he invited us dancing — they
do that down there.
This is why we visit Santa Cruz:
For the people. When we got there,
we stopped to listen to a man
named David sing us a half hour's
worth of original love tunes. We

asked him how long he played each
night and he said, "Until I've made
$4."
Also in downtown Santa Cruz
on Pacific Avenue is Chocolate, a
cafe that serves four types of hot
chocolate (we recommend the
Sofia), a hat shop (perfect for the
horse races) and a vintage clothing
store called Cognito at the far end.
The beach culture surrounding
Santa Cruz is magical, not to men
tion the surf.

Skyline Boulevard

Distance and time: Very close.
If you are feeling restless, and
you have a car (or a friend with a
car), it is not difficult to catch a
breath of fresh air off campus. We
are surrounded by hills. Driving
North on 1-280, exit on Highway 92

West and then go left onto Highway
35, commonly known as Skyline
Boulevard. I've heard rumor of bik
ers that make this trek on a regular
basis to admire the winding, wooded
wilderness found there. Some pause
at the bottom of one of the manv

hills to have a relaxed bite at Alice's
Restaurant — you can't miss it.
As an added bonus, on the way
up 1-280 there are two Vista Points
which offer beautiful views of the
pristine and wooded San Andreas
Fault Reservoir.

There is no need to feel claustrophobic while attending school
at Stanford. In case of panic, always leave campus. There is
quiet outside — stars at night and many moons.





Expansive as the Stanford campus may be — and
busy bees that we sometimes are — it can be nice
to leave the Farm for the wide world that exists out
side Stanford's palm-tree-lined walkways. The following is a
chronological log of the road-trips I took with a friend this
summer — with destinations boasting driving times of an
hour or less from campus.

The Redwood Room Lounge

Distance and time: Located in
San Francisco, about 32 miles
away from the Oval. Take
Interstate-280 North to the King
Street exit, go left on 3rd, and left
again on Geary Street Drive.
Approximately one hour, includ
ing time to find parking.
If you were to walk by, you
wouldn't know what you were
missing inside The Redwood
Room because there is no indica
tion of its existence on the street.
But we have decided to share this

secret — the lounge is on the cor
ner of Geary and Taylor, inside
the large, unmarked, swinging
doors of the Clift Hotel, across
the street from the Warwick
Hotel.
