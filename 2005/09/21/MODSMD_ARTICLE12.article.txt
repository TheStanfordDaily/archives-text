# Graduate Scene
## Nondaters: stop being lame and get some game 
### 
I don't know about you, but when I first
came to Stanford, I thought finding datable
men was going to be like shooting fish in a
barrel. All potential candidates automatically
met the minimum requirements for intelli
gence and motivation; now 1 simply had to
whittle down the group to those individuals
with a sincere appreciation for "Family Guy"
and minimal history of homicidal behavior.
That's what, like several thousand men?
Calculating the possibilities, I immediately
broke up with my high school boyfriend.
"But we're in love!" he sobbed into the
phone hysterically.
"Sorry, what? I'm organizing my social
calendar," I replied distractedly. At awkward
pauses in the conversation I'd roll my eyes in
boredom, and I'd imagine a sea of handsome

undergraduates rolling their eyes with me.
That may be a bit of an exaggeration, but
sadly, so were the hordes of potential dating
conquests. Don't get me wrong — there are
plenty of funny, intelligent, non-homicidal
me£ on campus, and I've even gone out with
a few of them. But somewhere between con
soling my attractive-yet-often-lonely friends
and swearing off all-campus grope-fests for
the umpteenth time, I realized the truth:
This campus is in serious need of a love
life intervention.
Think about it: when was the last time that
you, a very desirable individual, went out on
a date? Not a spontaneous make-out session
sponsored by Jack Daniels, but a what-sh.rt
should-l-wear-to-the-movies date? I'm bet
ting that it was a long time ago.
Now, you don't have killer halitosis or
ebola of the face. Most of the time you smell
pretty tasty, kind of like clean clothes or sum
mer rain. So where is the love? Why can't
you connect with anyone unless they're
engaged to you or drunk (or drunkenly
engaged to you)? We're the future leaders of
America — so why can't we date like adults?
These are the questions that drove the
creation of my blog —
www.stanfordsingle.com — the Facebook
group by the same name and now this col
umn. The response has been truly over
whelming. which tells me that there are a
great number of you out there who 1) want to
know why Stanford can be a weird place
socially, and 2) want to know how to change
that, or at least deal with it. And thank God
for that.
At an institution hell-bent on fostering
the life of the mind, it is easy to forget that
developing your social skills is an integral
component of the college experience. A com
prehensive understanding of the finer points
of interpersonal relations will affect every
thing from your ability to ace an interview for
a kick-ass job to the ease with which you will
be able to find a life companion when the
time is right. You wouldn't take the MCATs
without prepping for the test first, right?
Similarly, you need to have ample practice
interacting with potential romantic partners
in a dating situation.
I certainly don't have all the answers, but
I do have a lot of experience with both seri
ous relationships and casual dating, and I
have you, my lovely readers, to let me know
when I am completely off the mark or when
I should consider writing about a specific
topic. So far I've come up with a few interest
ing observations about this campus and the
students here. Thus, the following:
Stanford is a rich place to transition into
adulthood. The opportunity to synthesize
great quantities of knowledge among a com
munity of scholars is something most of the
world will never have the chance to experi
ence. But for all of its benefits, life on the
Farm does have its limitations. There are
many explanations for why Stanford, like
many other first-rate institutions, has some
thing of a second-rate social scene — stu
dents are simply too busy to date casually, the
most academically talented students tend to
have less practice in social situations, and/or
as overachievers we are afraid of the vulner
ability that is inherent to dating. Regardless
of the origin, we as a campus need to realize
that we exist in a restricted social environ
ment and take steps to address that.
Following this column is a good start.
How you apply the power of social savvy is
up to you. Get ready for love. Stanford style.
