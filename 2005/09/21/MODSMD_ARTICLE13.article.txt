## Grads laud convenience of new pub 
### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
With June's grand opening of
The 750 Pub, Stanford's new on
campus bar, graduate students
have found themselves a new ren
devouz point and place to hang
out, mingle and meet other mem
bers of the community.
"It's like 'Cheers' on campus for
grad students," said Donna
Winston, a second-year doctoral
student at the School of Education.
The 750 was built, in large part,
to provide a comfortable, fun and
central place where grad students
from all departments could meet
up, according to Moriah Thomason,
a fifth-year medical student and
former chair of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC). She added
that graduate students often find it
difficult to meet peers outside their
areas of concentration.
"I think the Pub definitely con
tributes to grad life, as it's right in
the heart of grad housing and stu
dents can just come and be social
with other grads," Winston said.
While efforts to spread the
word about The 750 have been
directed mainly at grad students,
anyone is welcome at the venue,
including undergraduates, faculty
and staff, according to Melroy
Saldanha, a second-year master's
student in computer science who
frequents the Pub. Patrons need
not be 21 to enter the bar, but
employees will check identifica
tion when people purchase alco
hol, he said.
"It's mainly a grad student
crowd, but undergrads show up
every now and then, and some pro
fessors have stopped by, normally
for lunch," Saldanha added.
Located on Escondido Road,
The 750 Pub is a dimly-lit lounge
area with comfy chairs, tables and
an outdoor seating area. Saldanha
said that currently, the Pub does

not have a license to serve alcohol
that is more than 24-proof, but
that the selection of sake, interna
tional beers and martinis is still
adequate.
In addition to drinks, the pub
serves a wide variety of food, and
all items are reasonably priced,
Winston said.
"Maurice Carrubba, the pub's
owner, specifically researched
other bars and restaurants to see
how he could provide students with
the best product choices at the

most competitive prices," Winston
told The Daily.
Saldanha said his favorite dish
at The 750 is the Tbscany chicken
sandwich, which costs about $6.50
and that most beers are $3 a pop.
Once the school year starts, the
Pub will even serve breakfast foods
like breakfast burritos, he added.
While many grad students like
going to bars off campus. The 750 is
a convenient alternative, Winston
said.
"I like that you're almost guaran

teed to know someone at The 750,
which is not necessarily the case for
Palo Alto bars," she remarked. "And
The 750 is really close by so that I
can just walk right to it."
The 750's proximity to graduate
housing is also a plus for Saldanha.
"I love the place just having
something nearby," Saldanha said.
But he also lamented the fact that
crowds in the venue were small this
summer, and said that on week
ends, he prefers to grab a beer at
the Pub and then head to bars in
San Francisco or Palo Alto.
"It's important to try to get
more people to know about The
750," he said.
Thomason told The Daily that
The 750 plans to hold many special
events this year to do just that,
including trivia nights, karaoke
nights and a grad night every
Thursday.
"The GSC has been an essential
contributor to making The 750 Pub
the hip-hop happening place that it
is, and years of work have gone into
this," she said.
