# GSC outlines goals for year
## 
### TINA HAN DESK EDITOR 
When created, the goals of the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
were meant to be threefold, with
every member working to strength
en advocacy for the graduate stu
dent body, plan event programming
and find funding for the various
graduate student groups on cam
pus.
The 2005 GSC Spring Bulletin
describes preliminary efforts by the
GSC to tackle the issue of diversity,
which will be extended into this
academic year. For the past year,
the GSC has also been working
through the newly founded GSC
Diversity Committee to promote
the idea that the graduate commu
nity should mirror the greater
diversity of Stanford's overall stu
dent population as well as national
population averages.
As a resource for Stanford's
graduate population, the GSC pro

vides numerous events and advoca
cy programs to help graduate stu
dents make the most out of their
time on the Farm. From the new
Graduate Student Community
Center to the various events such
as Grad Night at Flicks, dinner with
the University President and
Provost and the annual
Thanksgiving dinner, the GSC is
hoping to not only create a strong
sense of community, but also to
expand participation in the govern
ing body.
The GSC's Diversity
Committee was originally formed
to address the problem of under
representation of women and
minorities in Stanford's graduate
and professional programs. The
committee has developed a three
pronged strategy to utilize
Stanford's world renowned faculty,
administrators and student popula
tion to help noticeably improve the
state of diversity within Stanford's
graduate culture.

The committee will act as an
overarching umbrella organization
that will connect all the different
graduate student groups on cam
pus. This way, they will be able to
facilitate the much-needed talks
between various groups and the
University's administration and
faculty. These discussions on diver
sity are intended to form a solid
relationship with the University so
that diversity issues can be quickly
and effectively improved upon.
Recently, the Diversity
Committee conducted a survey on
the GSC Web site. Although results
of the questionnaire have not yet
been revealed, the survey asked all
graduate students their opinions on
subjects from the graduate school
selection process to instances of
possible discrimination that they
experienced in the past.
It also asked graduate students
to rate the diversity of their specif
ic departments in comparison to
either the graduate community or

Stanford as a whole. The compila
tion of this information will give
the Diversity Committee a more in
depth look into the different expe
riences of graduate students in the
many graduate programs and pro
fessional schools on campus.
For the upcoming academic
year, the GSC will also be trying to
promote diversity, participation
and interaction of graduate stu
dents already on campus with vari
ous social events that include mix
ers and dinner clubs. A weekly e
mail bulletin found at
http://gsc.stanford.edu will contain
information about graduate stu
dent events in greater detail.
Jenny Allen, a second-year law
student and GSC chair, told The
Daily that with the opening of The
750 Pub and Eatery on the first
floor of the Graduate Community
Center as well as the implementa
tion of many different events, grad
uate life will thrive during this next
academic year.
