## The 						idiot's guide Mastering thy inbox 
### 
Moving into college can be daunting, but setting up your e-mail
shouldn't have to be.
Stanford provides students a vast array of options for getting
"@stanford.edu" e-mail. Students can choose between two protocols, as
well as a number of clients, for retrieving their mail. They can use their
browser, a program such as Outlook or even another mail service such
as Gmail. Best of all, Stanford's upgraded 500 MB storage space offers
plenty of room for all of your e-mail and images, too!

POP, IMAP? What Gives?
The internet is governed by protocols that tell your computer how to
get the content you want. E-mail gives users a choice of protocols,
either the Post Office Protocol (POP), or the Internet Mail Application
Protocol (IMAP).
When you set up your e-mail program, you will need to tell it which
protocol to use. Not all internet protocols are created equal.
POP, which stores your e-mail locally on your computer, is the most
common protocol, but is also the most outdated. Although POP allows
you to read your mail when you are offline, your mailbox won't follow
you from computer to computer.
For students who want their e-mail available in more than one place
— such as on the Web, at home and at school — IMAP is the protocol
of choice. IMAP stores all of your mail and folders on Stanford's serv
er, and, as a result, your inbox and folders follow you across computers
and e-mail programs.
Choosing a Client
Most Stanford students start out using "Webmail" because it requires
only a browser. Located at http://webmail.Stanford.edu, Stanford's
Webmail is less than ideal. Slow and finicky, it often gets confused if you
use your browser's "Back" button. Even worse, scrolling through your
inbox is a chore, and requires you to wait for pages to reload. Lastly,
POP and Webmail don?t always play together nicely and POP users
may find much of their inbox missing.
Gmail: Webmail on Steroids
Those who absolutely love browser-based e-mail should consider
using Google's "Gmail," which is faster, friendlier and cooler than
Stanford's Webmail. Sign up for Gmail at http://Gmail.com, then go to
http://stanfordyou.stanford.edu and forward all incoming mail from
your Stanford account to your Gmail account. Lastly, tell Gmail about
your Stanford address in "Settings"-> "Accounts"->" Add another
email address." Now, you can send and receive mail from within Gmail
and it will still look like it originated from your Stanford account.
The Stand-Alone Option
I prefer a stand-alone e-mail client. These dedicated e-mail pro
grams are designed to give you total control of your inbox. Windows
users should download the free "Mozilla Thunderbird" at
http://mozilla.org. By far the best client for Windows, Thunderbird is
richer in features and more intuitive than others such as Outlook
Express. In particular,Thunderbird offers inline e-mail searching and
an impressive spam filter that not only kills off junk mail, but also
improves its accuracy with use.
Eudora is another option for students. Although better than
Outlook Express, Eudora has barely changed over the years and
lacks the innovative features found in Mozilla Thunderbird.
Mac users already have an excellent client that comes free with
their operating system. Since they introduced OSX, Apple has includ
ed "Mail.app," a solid, feature-rich program with inline searching and
spam-filtering. Best of all, Mail.app users can benefit from the easy-to
use look and feel characteristic of all Apple software.
For Linux users, I recommend Mozilla Thunderbird over the alterna
tive "Evolution," which is too eerily similar to Outlook Express.
Configure Your Client
After you install an email client, it's time to configure it. Using
Mozilla Thunderbird with IMAP on Windows, go to Tools-> Account
Settings and click "Add Account." Follow the prompts to enter your
name and Stanford email address ( your_SUNet_lD@stanford.edu).
When prompted for an incoming server, check the IMAP box and
enter "your_SUNet_lD.pobox.stanford.edu." For the outgoing server,
type "smtp.stanford.edu." Follow the prompts and click "Finished."
You?re not done yet! Add encryption by going to "Account Settings"
and clicking on "Server Settings" in the left pane. On the right pane
check the box entitled "Use Secure Authentication (SSL)." Click
"OK" and your inbox should be there waiting.
To configure other clients, go to http://mail.Stanford.edu and click
on "Configuring your e-mail program."
Next column, we will explore how to get the most out of the advanced
features in your e-mail client. Enjoy your new mailbox!
