# New cell rings with mediocrity ROKR
## Digital Love Motorola ROKR phone doesn't hold a candle to the iPod 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
On Sep 7, Motorola, Inc. and Apple
ushered in a new era of cell phone tech
nology with the release of the Motorola
ROKR, the world's first mobile phone to
come bundled with the omnipresent com
puter media player, iTUnes.
The ROKR (pronounced "rocker")
allows users to transfer up to 1(K) songs
from their computer library to their
mobile device. At a time when sporting
white earbuds has become everyone's
favorite fashion statement and iPods are
de rigueur, the two tech gurus' combined
effort is expected to send shockwaves
through the industry — stopping right at
the wallets of eager consumers.
Weighing in at a bantam 3.77 ounces,
the lightweight ROKR counterpunches
with a hefty $249 price tag — and that's
when you sign a two-year contract with
Cingular. Purchasing the phone without a
contract can run up to $4(X).
Ed Zander, chairman and chief execu
tive officer of Motorola, explained that
Motorola's latest brainchild delivers an
unprecedented service to merit the
phone's stifling cost.
"The Motorola ROKR represents the
ultimate convergence of mobile commu
nications and music," Zander said in a
recent press release. "Fusing iTUnes with
your always-with-you mobile phone,
we're revolutionizing the way the world
experiences mobile self-expression and
entertainment."
But in the two short weeks since
ROKR's release, professional critics and
gadget enthusiasts have already drafted a
laundry list of complaints about the
phone. Whereas Motorola's other iconic
product, the half-inch-thin RAZR.

received rave reviews for its sleek design,
the ROKR is being lambasted for its
unimaginative shape.
Because it is a stodgy, rectangular,
non-flip phone, the ROKR might be
pegged as "so two years ago" by its pur
portedly young target audience.
And Alfred Hermida, technology edi
tor for BBC News, points out the flashy
lights adorning the phone's boxy edges,
strictly deeming them a "gimmick
designed to appeal to younger callers."

By UK
standards, the
ROKR feels like
yesterday's
phone.

Whether the ROKR's simple light
emitting diode (LED) patterns — which
flicker in sync with the music — can sal
vage both its aesthetic and functional
shortcomings remains to be seen.
Kent German and James Kim. editors
for the popular tech review Web site,
cnet.com, also claimed the new phone

suffers from "several tedious limitations."
"It won't replace your iPod by any
means," they wrote in a Sep 7 article.
Transferring songs through the
ROKR's sluggish USB 1.1 interface is
sure to frustrate users acclimated to the
current 2.0 standard.
Nowhere to be found is the plug-and
play ease of iPod, as the ROKR's library
can only be controlled through a separate
data transfer application. The phone
comes equipped with Bluetooth, a wire
less connection that enables devices to
exchange information, but it does not
support song delivery.
If 10() MB of storage space seems like
a paltry amount, further consider that it is
an artificially-imposed limit on the flash
drive — Apple would not want to detract
from the success of its already established
iPod line.
And while those white earbuds are an
mp3 enthusiast's badge of honor, they're
also compulsory here. Motorola plays to
Apple-induced familiarity and throws in
a very similar pair of its own, but outside
headsets will need an adapter.
Those who give into pressure and pur
chase the world's first phone with ilbnes
will be happy to know that the ROKR
adopts the nested menus used by iPod.
Those unconvinced by Motorola's
flawed output might just side with
Hermida, who hints at an American will
ingness to jump at unnecessary and under
performing goods.
"By UK standards, the ROKR feels
like yesterday's phone," Hermida wrote.
"It may fare better in the U.S., where
handsets have tended to be somewhat
basic and lacking in the many functions
taken for granted in other parts of the
world."
Oh well, there's always the iPod Nano.
