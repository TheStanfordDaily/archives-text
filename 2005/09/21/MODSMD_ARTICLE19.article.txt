# The 						usual suspect, alcohol
## 
### 
Stanford has adjusted its fairly lenient
alcohol policy a few times in recent years
â€” usually in ways that cause grumbling
or outright consternation among students.
The biggest revision bans alcohol in com
mon areas of freshman dorms, and most
of the administration s concern regarding
alcohol use on campus has focused on
freshmen. So pay attention to what the
rules are, or you may become one of the
statistics mentioned in this editorial origi
nally run on May 27, 2005:
The Daily recently published an
unusually flattering piece about the
University's prohibition of alcohol in
freshman common spaces ("New alcohol
policy proves successful," May 16). While
a student newspaper reacting so positive
ly to the administration is rare, facts sup
porting the article's headline were even
harder to find.
For too long, alcohol policy debates
have been buttressed in anecdotes and
unscientific qualitative measurements.
Frankly, it does not matter what one res
ident assistant's experiences over the
course of one year were; without sys
temic studies of alcohol consumption,
overconsumption and culture, no one
knows which policies make students'
lives safer.
Currently, the University and the

Department of Public Safety collect
alcohol-related statistics including
minors in possession, driving under the
influence, alcohol-related misconduct
and trips to the emergency room, all in
terms of class year. Aside from the
Stanford Police's annual publication of
the safety statistics, these statistics are
not widely publicized and there is no
part of the University administration
that disseminates and publicizes a com
pilation of these statistics.
Stanford needs to stop downplaying
less pleasant facts. For future alcohol
policies to be successful, the student
body has to understand and support
them, and that will only happen through
frank discussion that includes alcohol
related statistics. A Stanford committee,
such as the Alcohol Advisory Board,
should publish a yearly report detailing
all available statistics, and the compari
son to prior years would assist in build
ing such a discussion.
Discussions about the alcohol policy
tend to create negative responses among
students, who always believe the
University is out to get them. Generally
this is not the case. But when discussing
these sensitive topics, it is particularly
important to be as truthful about the sta
tistics as possible.
