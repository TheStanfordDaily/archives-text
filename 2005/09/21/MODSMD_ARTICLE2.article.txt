## 'Hotel Rwanda' hero revisits genocide 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I had seen the international
community abandon us, but I never
gave up," said Rwandan refugee
Paul Rusesabagina during his
speech at De Anza College Monday
evening
Rusesabagina was a hotel man
ager in Kigali, Rwanda in 1994 dur
ing the Rwandan genocide. Through
courage and cunning, he managed to
save the lives of over 1,200 people.
Since the release of the film "Hotel
Rwanda," which tells his inspiring
story, Rusesabagina has become an
international celebrity.

He has also
been involved in
charitable organi
zations that aid
survivors of the
Rwandan tragedy.
He has even trav
eled around the
country to speak to
students about the

importance of Rusesabagina
standing up against massive injustice.
"Young people are the ones who
can help the most because they
have the force and the will," he said
in an interview with The Daily fol
lowing the speech. "Where there is
a will, there is a way."
On March 31,1994, Rusesabagina
returned with his family from a trip
to Switzerland. At first they sought
refuge in the Diplomate hotel where
Rusesabagina was working, but they
returned home confident that noth
ing would happen to them.
The next day, road blocks were
set up and Hutu soldiers were
checking people's ID's — killing
them if they were not Hutu.
Belgium quickly evacuated their
citizens from Rwanda and other
countries followed.
"The international community
pulled out," Rusesabagina said,
"closing ears, eyes, turning backs
and running away."
When his son went to visit a
friend and saw that friend, his moth
er and six sisters dead in their home,
Rusesabagina quickly realized the
gravity of the situation.
"He [Rusesabagina's son] went
to his room and did not speak for
four days," he said.
Rusesabagina managed to get 26
people who had taken refuge in his
home safely to the Diplomate hotel,
despite the fact that his car was
pulled over half way there, and he
was asked to kill all the people that

he was transporting.
Rusesabagina said that when the
soldier asked him to kill the passen
gers, he remained speechless for five
minutes. He then went to one of the
women that had been in his car and
showed her baby girl to the soldiers.
"Do you see yourself moving
through your life with this baby's
blood on your hands?" he asked
them.
Rusesabagina suggested that
there were other ways to deal with
the situation and escaped death by
offering the soldiers a bribe.
During the 100 days of genocide,
Rusesabagina took refuge in the
Mille Collines hotel, the place he
had worked prior to the Diplomate.
"Every day was almost like a
century." he said.
Not only did people in his hotel
have to resort to drinking out of the
swimming pool, but when he went
away from the hotel, Rusesabagina
saw that the soldiers had piled dead
bodies on the road to make road
blocks and were sitting on the piles
drinking beers.
"When? How? Where? These
were the questions that we were
asking ourselves, but we were not
asking ourselves whether we were
going to die or not," he said.
Rusesabagina managed to
receive immigration passes for his
family but realized that there
were over a thousand people liv
ing in the hotel who would be
killed if he left. He was the only
one who had managed to talk to
the soldiers, keeping them from
killing all of the Tutsis at his hotel
through bribes and by claiming
that he had information from his

international connections that
they did not.
Rusesabagina chose not to leave
with his family but to stay in the
hotel and do his best to protect the
people there.
"If I were to leave and these peo
ple were to be killed. I would never
be a free man in my life," he said. "I
would never be free from my own
conscience."
Though many men went to mili
tary training after the genocide,
Rusesabagina decided not to.
"Do never fight with a gun." he
said. "I just fight with my own
mouth. This is the best weapon."
Before telling the story of the
genocide, Rusesabagina began with
a brief history of Rwanda. He
explained that the country is broken
down into three major groups. The
Hutus make up 85 percent of the
population, Tutsis 14 percent and
Twa 1 percent.
Before colonization, all three
groups lived in harmony under
the rule of one king. According to
the Rwandan Youth Information
Web site, the divisions were eco
nomic. The Tutsis were the minor
ity who owned cows and the
Hutus were the majority that
farmed the land.
With colonization, however, the
divisions became racial and were
associated with certain physical
characteristics. To make sure that
there was no ambiguity, the colonial
powers began to issue identification
cards, which were still in use during
the genocide.
The first instance of violence
between Hutus and Tutsis occurred
in 1959 when the Tutsi kings lost
power to a Hutu Republican Party.
Thousands of Tutsis were killed and
many more were forced to seek asy
lum in neighboring countries such
as Uganda. Tanzania and Congo.
In 1973, there was a revival

killing of Tutsis, an occasion that
Rwandan President Habyarimana
Juvenal used to commence the
Second Republic. At the time,
Rusesabagina was 19 years old.
He said that he saw many of his
classmates kicked out of school
because of their ethnic back
grounds.
"All of their goals and all of their
objectives were cut off there," he
said.
Those TUtsis and moderate
Hutus who had gone to seek refuge
in the Ugandan hills began to form
a resistance group called the
Rwandan Patriotic Front that invad
ed Rwanda in 1990.
Four years later, the Hutu gov
ernment planned a mass genocide
to kill all Tutsis and any Hutus that
did not support their actions. As a
result, over 1 million people were
killed.
Rusesabagina said that one of
the greatest tragedies after the
genocide was that there were almost
half a million orphans left behind.
Many women were raped, and of
those, many contracted AIDS or
became pregnant.
He said that now in Rwanda
both the women and the children
still need psychological and medical
care as well as an education.
Until this month, there was a full
moratorium on the teaching of his
tory in Rwanda. Facing History and
Ourselves, a group that co-spon
sored the event with the Allstate
Foundation, was one of the organi
zations that helped to overturn that
moratorium.
Rusesabagina's speech was free
and open to the public — attended
by over 2,400 people — yet he
stressed the need to make sure that
his message went far beyond the
people in the room.
"It is now or never to say enough
is enough." he said.

Rusesabagina took refuge in the
Mille Collines hotel, the place he
had worked prior to the Diplomate.
"Every day was almost like a
century." he said.
Not only did people in his hotel
have to resort to drinking out of the
swimming pool, but when he went
away from the hotel, Rusesabagina
saw that the soldiers had piled dead
bodies on the road to make road
blocks and were sitting on the piles
drinking beers.
"When? How? Where? These
were the questions that we were
asking ourselves, but we were not
asking ourselves whether we were
going to die or not," he said.
Rusesabagina managed to
receive immigration passes for his
family but realized that there
were over a thousand people liv
ing in the hotel who would be
killed if he left. He was the only
one who had managed to talk to
the soldiers, keeping them from
killing all of the Tutsis at his hotel
through bribes and by claiming
that he had information from his

international connections that
they did not.
Rusesabagina chose not to leave
with his family but to stay in the
hotel and do his best to protect the
people there.
"If I were to leave and these peo
ple were to be killed. I would never
be a free man in my life," he said. "I
would never be free from my own
conscience."
Though many men went to mili
tary training after the genocide,
Rusesabagina decided not to.
"Do never fight with a gun." he
said. "I just fight with my own
mouth. This is the best weapon."
Before telling the story of the
genocide, Rusesabagina began with
a brief history of Rwanda. He
explained that the country is broken
down into three major groups. The
Hutus make up 85 percent of the
population, Tutsis 14 percent and
Twa 1 percent.
Before colonization, all three
groups lived in harmony under
the rule of one king. According to
the Rwandan Youth Information
Web site, the divisions were eco
nomic. The Tutsis were the minor
ity who owned cows and the
Hutus were the majority that
farmed the land.
With colonization, however, the
divisions became racial and were
associated with certain physical
characteristics. To make sure that
there was no ambiguity, the colonial
powers began to issue identification
cards, which were still in use during
the genocide.
The first instance of violence
between Hutus and Tutsis occurred
in 1959 when the Tutsi kings lost
power to a Hutu Republican Party.
Thousands of Tutsis were killed and
many more were forced to seek asy
lum in neighboring countries such
as Uganda. Tanzania and Congo.
In 1973, there was a revival

killing of Tutsis, an occasion that
Rwandan President Habyarimana
Juvenal used to commence the
Second Republic. At the time,
Rusesabagina was 19 years old.
He said that he saw many of his
classmates kicked out of school
because of their ethnic back
grounds.
"All of their goals and all of their
objectives were cut off there," he
said.
Those TUtsis and moderate
Hutus who had gone to seek refuge
in the Ugandan hills began to form
a resistance group called the
Rwandan Patriotic Front that invad
ed Rwanda in 1990.
Four years later, the Hutu gov
ernment planned a mass genocide
to kill all Tutsis and any Hutus that
did not support their actions. As a
result, over 1 million people were
killed.
Rusesabagina said that one of
the greatest tragedies after the
genocide was that there were almost
half a million orphans left behind.
Many women were raped, and of
those, many contracted AIDS or
became pregnant.
He said that now in Rwanda
both the women and the children
still need psychological and medical
care as well as an education.
Until this month, there was a full
moratorium on the teaching of his
tory in Rwanda. Facing History and
Ourselves, a group that co-spon
sored the event with the Allstate
Foundation, was one of the organi
zations that helped to overturn that
moratorium.
Rusesabagina's speech was free
and open to the public — attended
by over 2,400 people — yet he
stressed the need to make sure that
his message went far beyond the
people in the room.
"It is now or never to say enough
is enough." he said.
"I had seen the international
community abandon us, but I never
gave up," said Rwandan refugee
Paul Rusesabagina during his
speech at De Anza College Monday
evening
Rusesabagina was a hotel man
ager in Kigali, Rwanda in 1994 dur
ing the Rwandan genocide. Through
courage and cunning, he managed to
save the lives of over 1,200 people.
Since the release of the film "Hotel
Rwanda," which tells his inspiring
story, Rusesabagina has become an
international celebrity.

He has also
been involved in
charitable organi
zations that aid
survivors of the
Rwandan tragedy.
He has even trav
eled around the
country to speak to
students about the

importance of Rusesabagina
standing up against massive injustice.
"Young people are the ones who
can help the most because they
have the force and the will," he said
in an interview with The Daily fol
lowing the speech. "Where there is
a will, there is a way."
On March 31,1994, Rusesabagina
returned with his family from a trip
to Switzerland. At first they sought
refuge in the Diplomate hotel where
Rusesabagina was working, but they
returned home confident that noth
ing would happen to them.
The next day, road blocks were
set up and Hutu soldiers were
checking people's ID's — killing
them if they were not Hutu.
Belgium quickly evacuated their
citizens from Rwanda and other
countries followed.
"The international community
pulled out," Rusesabagina said,
"closing ears, eyes, turning backs
and running away."
When his son went to visit a
friend and saw that friend, his moth
er and six sisters dead in their home,
Rusesabagina quickly realized the
gravity of the situation.
"He [Rusesabagina's son] went
to his room and did not speak for
four days," he said.
Rusesabagina managed to get 26
people who had taken refuge in his
home safely to the Diplomate hotel,
despite the fact that his car was
pulled over half way there, and he
was asked to kill all the people that

he was transporting.
Rusesabagina said that when the
soldier asked him to kill the passen
gers, he remained speechless for five
minutes. He then went to one of the
women that had been in his car and
showed her baby girl to the soldiers.
"Do you see yourself moving
through your life with this baby's
blood on your hands?" he asked
them.
Rusesabagina suggested that
there were other ways to deal with
the situation and escaped death by
offering the soldiers a bribe.
