# Tuition: going up and up
## 
### 
On May 3,2005, the board reacted pos
itively to University President John
Hennessy's announcement that by 2010,
families earning less than $45,000 per year
will not be asked to contribute any money
to their child's undergraduate education at
Stanford. Unfortunately, the Class of '09
won t get to benefit from policy, which we
fully support. Instead, most incoming
freshmen can look forward to four years
of dealing with the beast that is tuition,
which the editorial board has consistently
pounded as an important issue. Here's our
view on Feb. 17, 2005:
More than $10,000 a quarter. It's a
milestone.
Think about it fora second. That's
$1.000 a week, or $500 per unit — more if
you take less than 20 units each quarter.
Your I-Hum experience just set you back
over $7,500.
Hiition keeps jumping and Stanford
students have virtually no say in how
much they have to pay each quarter. We
debate ASSU special fees, laundry costs
and Internet bills, but they make up just
a small percentage of the additional

$1,353 that students will have to pay next
year just to attend Stanford. Our 'cost of
living" initiatives are just a fraction of
housing costs every quarter, and the
much-debated cost of textbooks is less
than the increase in tuition that we bare
ly talk about.
Each year, the University's Board of
Trustees buries news about the tuition
increase. So, echoing last year's Daily edi
torial board, we call fora fuller explana
tion and justification of tuition increases.
We understand that future improve
ments to housing and student space are
expensive, and we support them, but stu
dents would be more likely to accept large
annual increases in tuition if we had a bet
ter sense of where our money was going.
Need-based financial aid blunts the
impact of tuition increases for many stu
dents, and costs are inevitably rising for
the University. But citing tuition as the
main source of unrestricted income —
the primary explanation this year —
implies that administrators see students
only as paying customers, or even just as
tuition conduits.
