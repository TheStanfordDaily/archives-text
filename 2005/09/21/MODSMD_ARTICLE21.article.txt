# Exotic Erotic: finally, no fiascos
## 
### 
You can look forward to Exotic Erotic,
Stanford's most famous party, put on each
May by 680 Lomita. The event has strug
gled in recent years due to problems with
security, overcrowding and police officers
videotaping scantily-clad partygoers. Last
year's affair was largely a logistical suc
cess, which bodes well for the future of the
party. On May 23, 2005, the editorial
board commended party organizers and
monitors fora job well done:
Smiles abounded on Saturday night as
young, nubile flesh was exposed in ways
that would have made even Paris Hilton
blush. But the real heroes of the night
were not the hot naked people â€” they
were the 680 staff. Office of Student
Activities (OSA) and Stanford Police
who spent five months making a work
able security plan.
At the peak of Exotic Erotic, 1,200
Stanford students were crammed within
the confines of 680 Lomita and its back
yard. A small cadre of Stanford Police.

Stanford Event Police and residential
staff ensured the event did not end early
as it did last year. Given the high demand
for the event on campus, this was no small
feat. Of course, this was little consolation
to the leagues of students turned away at
the bottom of the hill leading to 680.
For the last three years, there have
been problems surrounding crowd con
trol at Exotic Erotic. This year, organizers
took this concern to heart and reorgan
ized security to allow for quick entry and
exit and prevented the crowd from
becoming unruly.
We were particularly impressed by the
holding areas set up prior to reaching
680. reminiscent of Disney W<frld's Space
Mountain, which stopped the crowd from
becoming large enough to overcome
security. Unfortunately, one officer was
assaulted by students trying to rush into
the party. While the officer was
unharmed, the system could clearly still
use some tweaking.
