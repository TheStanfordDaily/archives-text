Alumni disappointment
Ted Leland's cronyism strikes again. I was
surprised, bui not shocked, to see that UC-
Davis had beaten our football team. When
you pass on Norm Chow to get a guy who
was run out of town at his last job, you
deserve an offense that can only muster a
field goal against a Division I-AA opponent.
Buddy. Walt... who's next, Ted, the fami
ly dog?

Congratulations to Stanford STAND
We want to commend Stanford STAND on
their successful divestment campaign and
applaud the courage of the Stanford Board
of Thistees and their willingness to take an
active stand against the atrocities taking
place in Sudan.

Divestment should not be a common
practice, but Stanford has correctly identi
fied the genocide in Darfur as an unusually
heinous evil.
