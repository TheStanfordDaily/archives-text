# Holt's Harangue
## Welcome to my evil lair 
### 
Iwas enjoying a pina colada and
watching the sunset on my beautiful
desert island when a most unfortu
nate incident occurred. My butler came
to inform me that my opinions editor
wanted some material this week. 1 calm
ly reminded the butler that this is sum
mer break and I would feed him to the
sharks if he was serious. Now I'm short
a butler, have completely ruined my day
of napping, and my Enya CD just start
ed skipping.
The life of a playboy humor columnist

is tough.
Bikini clad volleyball players are run
ning by, insisting I join them in the sprin
kler. But I must tell them "No, my boss
insists I produce over S(X) words this sum
mer." 1 hope my editor will enjoy their
looks of absolute disappointment and
sadness.
So now I should be writing some
inspiiing drivel about how I welcome all
of you to Stanford. But you know what?
You're going to hear that an awful lot this
week. Personally, I'd rather wait till you
receive the first B of your life. Then. I
shall come up behind you. quietly light a
cigarette and ask, "Welcome to Stanford.
Where's your god now?"
But Stanford doesn't want me to do

that to you. They want "cheery." Not
"psychotic."
Just to prove my goodwill, though, I'll
try to enlighten some of you eager
beavers. People often ask what the secret
to my success is. I tell them that investing
in a desert island complete with butlers
(it's good to have a spare), landing a
cushy job as a humor columnist, and cor
nering the diamond market at age 10 will
get you far. Essentially, 1 tell people the
secret to my success is being Chris Holt,
King Among Mortals.
But that's not very specific. So, I'll try
to come down from my ivory tower and
describe my experiences as a Bond-era
villain; hopefully they will prove helpful
to you in your own quest to control the
weather, raise the dead or whatever it is
that you plan on doing with your time at
Stanford.
First of all, I suggest finding your pas
sion. My passion, of course, is for pointing
out the flaws in people and getting paid
for it. In addition, I have a passion for
going to cafeterias and replacing Boca
burgers with baby harp seal meat. It's
good to be well-rounded here at
Stanford.
Also, I recommend acquiring a loyal
army of black squirrels that can do your
bidding. Just right now the black squirrels
are typing up this column as I dictate.
More often then not, they ghostwrite.
That's why last year's columns kept on
discussing climate change and its affects
on harvesting nuts.
Still, the squirrels are good workers
and I enjoy their jittering company. 1 sug
gest you too find a similarly beneficial
study situation. Personally, I do my best
work when I am waited on by genetically

enhanced squirrels, have my papers typed
up for me, and am quietly fanned by
Jessica Alba. You should find a similar
study space, except without Jessica Alba.
She's mine.
Of course, being on a desert island
you would assume I would be rather
lonely. Nothing is further from the
truth! In addition to the squirrels and
the former star of TV's "Dark Angel," I
keep a dungeon full of my freshman
hallmates. I decorate their room so it
looks like Lag, that way they don't get
too homesick.
They offer me their unique perspec
tives on the world: that of people living
in a dungeon. I offer my perspective of
being an evil genius and millionaire
humor columnist. Stanford is all about
getting to know other people's views.
And if you disagree with them, it's nice
to have a lava pit underneath their
cages.
Now you may be asking: Chris, how
can I attain happiness at Stanford when I
am not as good looking, talented or suc
cessful as you are? Fear not, young one.
There is only one Chris Holt, King
Among Mortals. But there is probably
only one of you as well. Unless, of course,
you are a clone who has escaped from my
lab. In which case, there are several of
you and unless you return my weather
control device, my attack dogs will track
you down!
Where was I? Oh yes. Find your pas
sion. Know your study habits. Meet new
people. Own a lava pit. See you this fall.

Chris will he enjoying the last few days of his
summer vacation, thank you very much.
