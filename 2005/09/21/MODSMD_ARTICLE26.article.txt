# One time shot
## A 						responsibility to offend 
### 
Ihad a bad experience with a group of Japanese
tourists on campus this week. I wanted to discuss
it in this space, but a friend cautioned me that the
subject might be too "racially charged." I'm not sure
if he was serious or not, but in saying so. he summed
up an important part of the culture here.
Take note, newbies. As you will learn if you read
this page often enough, political correctness is coin of
the realm at Stanford. Even those who openly chafe
against the practice, like the diligent staff of the
Stanford Review (title of one recent article: "Exactly
How Latino is 'Latino?'"), are usually, in the end,
only feeding the beast. For that matter, the use of the
phrase "political correctness" in this column feels too
correct. I prefer the grandfather-friendly phrase
"pussy-footing around." As in. there's a lot of pussy
footing around on this campus.

(For anyone who doesn't know what the phrase
means, I would recommend reading "Poem" by
William Carlos Williams. The poem is about a cat. a
flower pot and a jamcloset.)
John Hennessy likes to pussy-foot around. We may
have the most politick University President in all of
higher education. In one statement from last year he
responded to the flap created by Harvard President
Lawrence Summers about women in the sciences.
The title, "Vantage Point: Look to future of women in
science and engineering," reads like something trans
lated from Chinese into English by Google.
In the statement, Hennessy seems to want to criti
cize Summers for speculating about "innate differ
ences" between men and women. But we'll never
know, because he buries the criticism underneath a
few statistics and a pile of words like "enterprise."
"pipeline," and "untoward." His pleasant, insubstan
tial tone flutters on the page like a seagull riding the
updraft.
But the statement was actually a team effort, much
like the St. James Bible, except to different effect. He
wrote it with two other University presidents, which
is like going out on a limb after first stacking mat
tresses underneath. After reading it, I went and lis
tened to my pirated copy of Slim Thug's "Like a
Boss."
Why pick on President Hennessy several months
after the fact? Because it's a trickle-down effect.
Recently, as part of a vague, ongoing series of
columns described only as being "on men and

women," Andrea Runyan wrote in The Daily that, "
... as politically incorrect as it is to say so, male and
female minds are fundamentally different." Right as
I read that. 1 heard the slight crinkle of little pussy
feet padding across my paper.
Perhaps Hennessy, Runyan and I can sit down
over a saucer of milk sometime and talk about why it
might be politically incorrect to say that male and
female minds are different. But seeing as I'm leaving
for Oxford in a week, I'll be untoward and put the
enterprise somewhere down the pipeline.
But about the Japanese tourists. My Sophomore
College class of 14 students and two professors was
sitting around one of the half-moon conference
tables in a room in the History Building, discussing
the plays we had just seen at the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival.
So I'm sitting there, trying not to bite my finger
nails, when a group of Japanese tourists passes
beneath our open window, talking with abandon. I
hear the outside door open, and a moment later the
tour guide leads a group of 10 or 12 (I'm certain it
was an even number) people through the hallway by
our room. The tour guide shushes his group loudly
when he sees our class through the open door.
The tourists slow as they pass in order to catch a
glimpse of our class, which I admit looked like some
thing out of the University brochure. They walk and
talk softly, sometimes pointing into our room, until the
last of them is out of sight. I resume biting my finger
nails. A moment later, I look to see a hand creeping
around the doorframe, holding a small digital camera.
A head emerges behind the hand, followed by a body.
The beholder, a middle-aged Japanese man, does
not say hello, nor does he ever break eye contact with
the small, silent, bloodless image on his viewfinder
screen.
He moves slowly into the door frame with the
careless confidence of a turn-of-the-century Safari
hunter. His concern is not that we might take
umbrage at his shooting us, but rather that any sud
den motion on his part could send our group leaping
like gazelles out the window.
One of our professors, seated with her back to the
camera, notices the faces of a few students have
turned towards the door. She turns to see what they
are looking at just as the camera's flash goes off. She
blinks to erase the spots from her vision before turn
ing back to the discussion.
The first photographer disappears, but another
soon takes his place. And another. Most of us are
too stunned to think to close the door until they
have gone.
