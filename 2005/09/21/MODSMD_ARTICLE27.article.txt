# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## A
						warning from experience 
### 
You're new here. I can tell. You have about you that iri
descent aura of innocence. I envy you, ready to finish
off your teenage years with a flourish.
Congratulations. Really, you deserve it. You've done very
well to get here. And, what's more. I'm sure you'll find that
the Stanford experience lives up to its reputation.
However, as with much in life, the Farm is not without its
dangers. I know that from the outside it appears an idyllic
hideaway, where the troubles and cares of everyday life are
swept away by one's burgeoning intellectual development —
but appearances are, as they say, deceptive.

As you wade your way through the ocean of your fresh
ly-scrubbed and (almost) acne-free peers, you will occasion
ally see those who lack the hard body and wide-eyed igno
rance of the undergraduate. Who are these apparent dere
licts?
Well they. too. are students. Just older. Much, much older.
Yes. that's right, despite its innumerable strengths as a
school. Stanford still fails in one vital area. It tolerates grad
uate students.
Needless to say. this isn't heavily advertised. I'm sure
many of you may not have even realized that you would be
sharing your air with those musty, decaying scraps of human
ity that will never cease their clawing for qualifications.
Further, I suspect that even if you knew Stanford's dirty
secret you would have assumed the graduates would be hid
den away, not polluting your space.
It's not just the pervading stench of graduateness that is
so bothersome. Nor is it simply the clutter of bicycle-helmet
wcaring social rejects. No, what is particularly worrisome is
the menacing atmosphere of sketchiness that these students
create.
In this enlightened age, no one should have to feel preyed

upon. Sexual harassment should be constrained to frat par
ties and locker rooms. Yet, despite this, nowhere on campus
is safe from sketchy stalkers.
You may believe that confining your burnished biceps
within a Stanford-stamped wife-beater should afford you
some privacy. You're wrong. They will stare.
And young ladies: I know that you wish to be free to wear
your branded hot pants without the wrong sort of older gen
tleman glancing your way; unfortunately, though, the misog
ynists still roam free.
If such lecherous looking were only found in common
rooms and open spaces during daylight hours, perhaps it
would not be so bad. After all, tolerance is all the rage here
on the West Coast.
However, some of these graduates have the audacity to
venture out at night, even to the most inappropriate of ven
ues— the deliberate misunderstanding of parties that are
"open to everyone" is all-pervasive.
Furthermore, they teach. You can't even avoid them by
choice. They'll guide your discussion groups, grade your work
and use both of those jobs as an excuse to make eye contact.
Along with taking such liberties as conversing outside of
class, they also have the audacity to fail in their duty to be at
your beck and call during every waking hour. I mean, it's not
iike they have anything better to do than instantaneously
answer your e-mail with a question about the midterm - sent
at 3 a.m. the night before the exam.
I've always found that the best way to deal with a mangy
dog is to hurl abuse and small stones. While the latter is
frowned upon when it comes to suppressing the activities of
future Ph.D.s, the former is a powerful tool.
With sufficient curling of one's upper lip, withering sar
casm can actually wither. Remember mocking people for
their apparent inadequacies is the best way to destroy their
confidence and ensure that they know their place at the bot
tom of the social hierarchy.
And, what's more, nothing will make you feel more like
you and your brethren belong at the top than looking down
at those below.

Still not convinced graduate students are all terrible people that
you should have nothing to do with? Well, in that case e-mail
navins@stanford.edu fora personal demonstration.
