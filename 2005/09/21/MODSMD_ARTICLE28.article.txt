## New Google digital library hits copyright roadblocks 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA DESK EDITOR 
Last December Google announced its plan to
team up with leading universities and public
libraries around the country, including Stanford,
to provide instantly searchable copies of library
books to all of its users. Along the way, however,
this digital library ran into some legal road
blocks.
Publishers have argued that by scanning copy
righted material, Google is violating US. copy
right law. Google, however, stands by its idea,
arguing that their use of the copyrighted material
falls under the "fair use" doctrine.
"By making digital copies of copyrighted
works, Google has infringed on the exclusive
rights of the copyright holder," said Chris
Sprigman, a fellow in the Stanford Law School
Center for Internet and Society and associate
professor of law at the University of Virginia Law
School. "Does fair use save what they are doing?
This is the $64 million question."
Colette Vogele, also a fellow at the center and
head of the firm Vogele and Associates, which
advises on issues of intellectual property,
explained that fair use is a murky area in copy
right law.
"The fair use law is intended to allow individ
uals or organizations to make use of copyrighted
materials under certain conditions and situations
without specific permission from the copyright
holder," she said. "The classic example is people
using excerpts from works for commentary,
analysis or criticism, but the law is not as clear cut
as it would be in an ideal world."
According to Vogele, there is a four factor bal
ancing test used to decide if something falls under
the fair use clause. These criteria include how
much of the work was used, the nature of the use,
whether the use was for commercial or non-com
mercial purposes and whether the use will inter
fere with the potential market of the copyrighted
material.
To adhere to these factors, Google will not
make the entire text of copyrighted materials
available to the public. When a user searches for
a term in the text of such copyrighted books,
Google will only show the specific passages in

which the term is found, along with links to where
the user can buy or borrow the book.
"I think Google has a great argument for fair
use," Vogele said. "They are copying the entire
book, but they are not distributing all of it — only
giving away a paragraph or so. They have three of
the four factors on their side."
Nevertheless, Google announced that it will
stop scanning copyrighted material until
November, giving copyright holders a chance to
let the company know which works they would
prefer not be included in the library.
"No one can know at this point what will hap
pen." Sprigman said. "I suspect that if a publisher
really doesn't want their works to be included,
they will tell Google and Google will not include
them. This is a way that a lot of potential legal dis
putes could be resolved out of court."
Google representatives contend that the digi
tal library will be beneficial not only to readers
but also to publishers.
"This way you can have your books in Google
Print, which will put them into Google.com
search results, direct potential buyers to your Web
site, provide ongoing reports about user interest
in vour books and your books will also earn rev

enue from contextual advertising — even if they
are out of print," wrote Adam Smith, the Google
Print production manager, on Google's Web blog.
Sprigman said he agrees that the digital library'
would be beneficial for all.
"This is a very useful thing for society and it
may ultimately be in the interest of publishers,"
he said. "However, the fair use test does not
authorize everything that is in everyone's best
interest."
Whether or not Google's library passes the
fair use test, Stanford will continue to digitize its
library collection.
"Stanford has been digitizing books for years,"
said Andrew Herkovic, director of communica
tions and development for the Stanford
University libraries. "We have a very sophisticat
ed operation that includes the world's first and
perhaps only book digitizing robot."
According to Herkovic, Stanford's ultimate
goal is to have digital copies of its entire collec
tion available for analysis, reading and other use
to the Stanford community.
"We will do everything we can to provide
access no matter where the digitization is done —
at Google or here," he said.
