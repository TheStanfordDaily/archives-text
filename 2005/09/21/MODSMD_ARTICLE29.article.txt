# Stanford ranked third in international poll
## 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is the world's third
best university in terms of aca
demics and research, while the
United States takes a wide lead
in the quality of higher education
internationally, a 2005 global uni
versity ranking reported.
The academic ranking, com
piled annually since 2003, was
published by the renowned
Shanghai JiaoTong University in
China.
Harvard topped the list tpr
the third consecutive year, while
Cambridge University in the
United Kingdom jumped one
slot from last year and took the
number two position previously
held by Stanford a year before.
Jiao Tong University exam
ined data from more than 2,000
universities around the world,
though it only released the rank
ing of the top 500.
Ranking criteria include the
numbers of the following: alumni
and staff winning Nobel Prizes or
Fields Medals; highly cited
researchers in 21 categories; arti
cles published in the journals
Nature or Science; articles in
three scholarly citation indexes
and a measure of academic per
formance with respect to the size
of the institution.
Stanford attained the highest
score in the category of most fre
quently cited researchers. The
University also fared well in its
numbers of award-winning facul
ty and articles contained in schol
arly citation indexes.
Stanford underperformed
significantly, however, in the
number of alumni who have
won Nobel Prizes and Fields
Medals, possibly owing to
Stanford's relatively late incep
tion compared to members of
the Ivy League and other peer
institutions.
Overall, the U.S. boasts 17 of
the world's 20 best universities

and more than half —53 in
total — in the top 100, accord
ing to the 2005 ranking. Of all
500 universities that are ranked
this year, the U.S. lays claim to
168.
The second best performing
country in the ranking, the U.K.,
enjoys just two universities —
Cambridge and Oxford — in the
top 20 list and a total of 11 in the
top 100.
The University of Tokyo, at
20th place in the list, is the top
ranked institution of higher edu
cation in Asia.
JiaoTong University admitted
that mere numbers cannot pre
cisely reflect the quality of a
school, and cautioned that the
ranking should be interpreted
with care.
"Any ranking is controversial
and no ranking is absolutely
objective," Jiao Tong officials
told The Daily. "People should be
cautious about any ranking
including our Academic Ranking
of World Universities."
Notwithstanding its limita
tion, the ranking highlights the
dominant role that the United
States continues to play in the
arena of higher education on a
global scale. At the moment,
American universities employ
some 70 percent of all Nobel lau
reates, produce 44 percent of the
most frequently cited articles and
account for 30 percent of the
world's total output of science
and engineering articles.
The Economist reported that
despite its performance in the
current ranking, Asia is catching
up fast when it comes to the qual
ity of its higher education and
thus preparing for the knowledge
economy. China, for instance, has
doubled the size of its student
population in the past decade
while equipping elite universities
with enormous resources. India,
the article said, is also upgrading
institutions with a focus on tech
nological development.
