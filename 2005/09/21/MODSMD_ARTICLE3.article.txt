## Katrina hits close to home for Cardinal 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A number of Stanford students and
faculty will begin their school year with
more than academic stress on their
minds. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina,
many are more concerned with the safety
of their friends and family, and what lies
ahead after so much has been destroyed.
"It's hard to describe it," said junior
Brice Rolston, one of the many Stanford
students directly affected by the storm.
Rolston lives in Mandeville, La., a
town on the North Shore of Lake
Pontchartrain across from New Orleans,
but was at Stanford when the hurricane
hit. Unable to communicate with his
family, he immediately booked a flight
to Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital,
where he was able to communicate with
his family
Rolston spent the next week doing
anything that he could to help out spend
ing time to search for supplies.
"It was a total madhouse; you could
not even get drinking water," he said.
"You take advantage of all the modern
conveniences until you live without them
fora few days."
Rolston's family was lucky Though
half the houses in his neighborhood had
trees that had fallen through their roofs,
Rolston's house suffered no serious
damage.

There were downed power lines in the
road, trees that had uprooted and taken
neighbors' lawns with them, and very lit
tle water pressure. Because Rolston's
home was above sea level, there was lit
tle flood damage. Nearby homes located
on Lake Pontchartrain, however, were
simply pushed over by the water, the
walls parallel to the lakefront collapsing.
Early on, several houses in the neigh
borhood were looted. Rolston's family

Students, families evacuated

and the neighbors quickly set up their own
security detail and patrolled the neighbor
hood with firearms. More than anything
else, it was a tactic intended to scare looters
away and the looting stopped after a few
days.
For the week that Rolston was in
Louisiana, he and his neighbors were con
stantly doing whatever they could to better
the situation.
"In our community, the hurricane really
brought us all together," he said. "The bleak
picture you see in New Orleans was some
what countered by the people on the North
Shore."
Junior Julia Saladino had a somewhat dif
ferent experience. Because her mother was
used to New Orleans' annual hurricane
warnings, she initially did not want to leave
the city.
At 2 a.m. on the Saturday night before the
storm, Saladino's brother woke her up and
made her watch the news. When they saw
the hurricane's destructive potential,
Saladino's family immediately began pack
ing and drove into Texas.
Shifting between the houses of several
different family members, Saladino had to
return to Stanford early for medical reasons
since she could not see her doctor in New
Orleans. Her family is staying in Texas indef
initely.
Because Saladino's home is above sea
level, it suffered little damage. "We are
certainly one of the families that were very
lucky," she said. "I know so many people who
lost everything in that storm and I can't
imagine how that must feel."
Freshman Sarah Woodward and her fam
ily may not have been as fortunate. They
were at their vacation home when the hurri
cane hit, and still do not know if their house
weathered the storm.

"The hurricane completely transformed
the area that I was in," Woodward said. "It
was not even recognizable."
She said that everyone in the neighbor
hood was extremely supportive. They had no
running water, electricity or air-conditioning
after the hurricane, but three different peo
ple came with truckloads of supplies for
them and their neighbors, two of whom were
strangers.
Woodward said that being with her fami
ly immediately after the storm struck helped.
She talked to some of her friends who had
already left for college when the hurricane
hit, but it was difficult to speak with them
because everyone was already caught up in
college life.
"It's hard not being able to go back even
at Thanksgiving," she said. "A lot of my
friends are not even coming back. I may not
even see some of them again."
Junior Zataia Richburg, who evacuated to
Montgomery, Ala. before the storm hit said
that it helps to try to go from day to day as
normally as possible. She and her family are
now in Cincinnati, Ohio, where they have
been reading books, watching movies and
talking to friends.
"I always knew my family was impor
tant," Richburg said. "I was always wonder
ing about [the] hurricane season before I left
for school, what would happen if the big one
hit. I'd rather be here with my parents and
know that they're safe."
Originally from Louisiana, Jan Barker
Alexander, assistant dean of students and
director of the Black Community Services
Center, has college friends that are still miss
ing. When asked about the hurricane, she
quickly rattled off the names of a number of
people she knew here at Stanford who were
affected in one way or another.
"The stories are endless," she said.
