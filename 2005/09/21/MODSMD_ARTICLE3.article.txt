## Katrina hits close to home for Cardinal 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A number of Stanford students and
faculty will begin their school year with
more than academic stress on their
minds. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina,
many are more concerned with the safety
of their friends and family, and what lies
ahead after so much has been destroyed.
"It's hard to describe it," said junior
Brice Rolston, one of the many Stanford
students directly affected by the storm.
Rolston lives in Mandeville, La., a
town on the North Shore of Lake
Pontchartrain across from New Orleans,
but was at Stanford when the hurricane
hit. Unable to communicate with his
family, he immediately booked a flight
to Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital,
where he was able to communicate with
his family
Rolston spent the next week doing
anything that he could to help out spend
ing time to search for supplies.
"It was a total madhouse; you could
not even get drinking water," he said.
"You take advantage of all the modern
conveniences until you live without them
fora few days."
Rolston's family was lucky Though
half the houses in his neighborhood had
trees that had fallen through their roofs,
Rolston's house suffered no serious
damage.

There were downed power lines in the
road, trees that had uprooted and taken
neighbors' lawns with them, and very lit
tle water pressure. Because Rolston's
home was above sea level, there was lit
tle flood damage. Nearby homes located
on Lake Pontchartrain, however, were
simply pushed over by the water, the
walls parallel to the lakefront collapsing.
Early on, several houses in the neigh
borhood were looted. Rolston's family
