# Op-ed calls for Bush impeachment
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO DESK EDITOR 
The devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane
Katrina not only left thousands homeless and hit
America's gross domestic product hard, but has
also sparked controversy in the country's political
arena.
Paul Craig Roberts, a former senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and self-identified Independent,
published a Sept. 3 article "Impeach Bush Now" in
the Creators Syndicate, an independent newspaper.
In it, he asserts that President George W. Bush's
inability to handle this natural disaster warrants his
removal from office.
Roberts argues in the editorial that the compound
ed disaster could have been prevented had the Bush
administration heeded the warnings of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
A report filed in 2004 by FEMA after a hurricane
simulation project stated that the levees needed to be
raised to prevent flooding and that "the gravity of the
situation calls for an extraordinary level of planning to
improve government readiness."
Roberts stated that a majority of the funds that
should have been spent to protect New Orleans were
instead diverted to combating terrorism.
"Every expert and newspapers as distant as Texas
saw the New Orleans catastrophe coming," Roberts
wrote. "But President Bush and his insane govern
ment preferred war in Iraq to protecting Americans at
home."

Roberts also criticized the federal governments
immediate response to the disaster.
"When it was known that Hurricane Katrina was
bearing down on New Orleans, the normal advanced
preparations by FEMA were not undertaken,"
Roberts said in an interview with The Daily. "It was
many days after the hurricane that help arrived, a sec
ond unprecedented failure."
Roberts explained that poorly distributed funds
created much of the problem.
"Many multiples of the funding that would have
saved the city now have to be spent to rescue it."
Roberts wrote while furthering his claim that the cur
rent administration has been fiscally irresponsible.
Roberts clarifies his point that the loss of American
lives and that of a major city, in addition to the lack of
preparation and delayed response to the hurricane, is
justification for an impeachment.
"Congress can impeach any president (and any
presidential appointee) for whatever reason it wants,
as long as it is prepared to take the heat," Roberts
said.
He claimed that the level of incompetence reaches
the point of criminal negligence, more than enough
reason for Congress to call for an impeachment.
"Suppose that a private party had the contract to
protect the city from levee failure and flooding,"
Roberts said. "The New Orleans failures are so great
that such private parties would be guilty of criminal
negligence and be facing severe legal problems. Why
do Americans permit government to fail with
impunity?"
