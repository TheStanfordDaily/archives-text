Hundreds of Stanford University and Stanford
Hospital workers marched from Sand Hill Field to the
main entrance of the Stanford Hospital on Sept. 5 in
protest of Stanford Hospital's treatment of its
employees.
"Labor Day is a time to remember the gains and sac
rifices made by working people to improve the working
conditions for all people and demand the respect and
fairness we deserve as those who make Stanford a
world-class institution," said Zev Kvitky, president of
the United Stanford Workers, a Stanford based union.
With new hospital labor contract negotiations set to
begin in late September, workers rallied to demand
"better health care, retiree health benefits and a better
retirement," said Gayle Tiller, spokeswoman for the
Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local
715, a Silicon Valley based chapter that helped organ
ize the rally.
According to Tiller, the Stanford Hospital's profits
have increased dramatically in the past few years, with
the hospital garnering $9.3 million in profits in 2(X)2 and
$101 million in 2(K)4. However, Tiller said in an inter
view with The Daily that although the hospital's profits
have risen, it has failed to invest any of its additional
funds in its employees.
Tiller added that turnout was greater than expect
ed at the protest and that over 750 people attended
the rally, though The San Jose Mercury News report
ed that Palo Alto police estimated the number of peo
ple to be 450.
At the rally, workers held SEIU signs reading "Fair

contract now!" and "Retirement with Dignity."
California Assemblymembers Ira Ruskin and Sarah
Lieber also addressed the crowd.
This was the first campaign involving both University
and hospital employees, according to Kvitky. He said he
felt the rally was effective and that it wiil encourage
workers to unite to demand better contracts.
"We know that our members were energized by our
spirited action and have realized our greater strength as
workers from across all of Stanford," he said. "We want
Stanford to recognize that workers see themselves as
Stanford employees whether they work at the
University or the hospital, and we will be fighting
together for the respect and fairness we deserve."
Although Kvitky claimed the demonstration was
effective, Sarah Staley, director of communications for
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital, said the protest
would not affect negotiations between the hospital and
its employees, which begin the week of Sept. 27, though
the hospital is aware of the employees' demands.
"We plan to approach negotiations with a real spirit
of cooperation, and we expect to present a really com
petitive offer to our employees," Staley said. "These are
incredibly valued employees, and we're going to work
within the process to effect changes to the contract as
needed."
Staley added that although workers are protesting,
the demands expressed by the hospital's 8,000 employ
ees will be considered at the bargaining table.
" ITie general public needs to understand that we
do address the [year] with a tone of collaboration,"
she said. "People need to realize that we haven't sat
down yet and we will address these topics when nego
tiations begin."
