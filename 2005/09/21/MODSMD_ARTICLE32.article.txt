# Undergraduates pull out the plastic, run up sizable debt

### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
College students nationwide are
having serious problems managing
their money, and as a result, some col
lege advisors are warning that credit
card debt has become the primary
cause for freshmen dropout rates,
according to a recent article published
in Inside Bay Area Newspaper.
With more and more financial
resources available to students, includ
ing various programs to help pay for
tuition, living expenses and books, the
phenomenon seems startling, but it is
not a lack of resources that is giving stu
dents economic problems. More often,
poor planning, bad budgeting and
parental negligence are the main con
tributors to the skyrocketing credit card
debt plaguing college students.
Credit card debt at Stanford, howev
er, is hard to monitor. While many stu
dents receive some sort of financial aid,
the Office of Financial Aid records only
the debt that students owe on loans; it
does not monitor individual student
credit card debt.
Smith College recently conducted a
survey of 700 students across the coun
try revealing that the average amount
of credit card debt per student totals
$2,400. Most of these students did not
rack up this debt because they were
buying excessive amounts of personal
items; in fact, more than half of the stu
dents surveyed used their credit cards
to purchase textbooks and other school
supplies, while a quarter of the students
used plastic to pay for all or part of
their tuition.
San Leandro financial consultant
Errold F. Moody, Jr. argues that if stu
dents could get a grip on their finances

in college, they would be better pre
pared for life after school. In addition,
he said he believes that students who
have credit card debt problems at such
a young age are at a greater risk for
economic instability as adults.
"You have to learn financial disci
pline for your adulthood," Moody told
Inside Bay Area. "That's why later they
have problems with their 401 (k) run
ning down because they don't pay
attention."
At nearby CSU-East Bay in
Hayward, administrators have banned
credit card vendors from campus, hop
ing the move will curb the overuse of
plastic at the school.
East Bay Communications Prof.
Sally Murphy said she believes many
students' financial issues are a result of
the perceived importance of "self-pres
entation, clothing, the weekend, clubs."
Murphy cited differences between
past generations of college students and
the current one. pointing out that cred
it card use is far more prevalent today,
and consequently, credit card debt is
also more common.
But student credit card debt is far
from incurable. In fact, it appears as if
many parents have accepted the fact
that their children cannot handle the
potentially dangerous freedom of
credit cards, and have decided to
switch to more manageable financial
alternatives â€” most popularly debit
cards.
San Mateo financial advisor Paul
Casias said that an increasing number
of parents are controlling the finances
of their college-age children with pre
paid, re-loadable credit cards issued by
Visa and MasterCard, which allow par
ents to track how their children are
spending their money.
