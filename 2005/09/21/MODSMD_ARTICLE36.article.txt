# A 						solitary figure paced outside the Stanford locker room late last Saturday night.
## 
### 
His hands firmly grasped
his hips and the scowl on his
face never once wavered,
but most gripping were his
wandering eyes.

Perhaps he merely stared
into space and tried to forget.
But his disappointment could
not be concealed. Stanford
Athletic Director Ted Leland
turned and embarked alone
on his long up-hill trek out of
the stadium.
Just feet away, a UC-Davis
linebacker screamed into his
cell phone in excited disbelief.
"We just beat Stanford!"
the freshman hollered. "We
beat 'em! We beat 'em!"
Inspired, the Davis cheer
leaders started a "Go Aggies"
cheer with renewed vigor,
right in the ear of fifth-year
senior Erin Lashnits, this
year's Tree. Lashnits poked
her head out of the costume,
and, with a slow shake of her
head, wordlessly filed out of
the stadium and into the cold
night.
The locker room doors
swung open and a slow pro
cession of Stanford players
piled out, most in single file.
With their helmets still on
their down-turned heads, the
men marched in near-silence,
save fora lineman who
glanced towards the media,
cameras and notepads wait
ing. A series of four-letter
expletives was all he could
muster before he too headed
for the exit ramp.
Inside the locker room the
mood was as dramatic.
Huddled in a circle, four
watery-eyed players talked
softly and tried to console
each other. Next door, head
coach Walt Harris bit his
upper lip in attempt to fight
back the tears, but his eyes
were also watery as he talked
about his team's perform
ance.
Where to start? After
growing up his whole child
hood a Stanford fan, Harris'
return to the Farm may go
down as the most embarrass
ing loss in Cardinal football
history. Stanford had never
before lost to a Division l-
AA team. Of 119 Division I-
A teams, only two have lost to
non-Division I-AA competi
tion thus far this season:
Louisiana-Monroe and
Stanford.
The loss shattered the

optimism brought about by a
new season and a new coach
ing staff. Ever since the hiring
of Harris this past November,
many faithful Cardinal fans
had suspended disbelief.
Harris had made five consec
utive bowl games in
Pittsburgh, and he and the
team expected to instantly
ride the ship at Stanford as
well, setting their goals at a
winning season and a bowl
berth.
The coaches, the team and
the fans bought into the lofty
expectations. The fact that
Stanford had posted a 10-23
record of the last three sea
sons, that Pac-10 opponents
gained an average of nearly
120 yards more than Stanford
last season or that this year's
schedule ranks among the
toughest in the country no
longer merited worry. Even
Stanford marketing capital
ized upon and perpetuated
this sense of unbridled poten
tial, creating the new ad cam
paign "It All Starts Now."
Considering his impressive
track record of turning
around losing teams, Harris is
most likely the right man for
the job, but as the fans found
out last Saturday, there is no
quick fix. Harris said in the
post-game locker room that
perhaps the most striking fact
is that he didn't view the per
formance as an aberration.
Rather, and apparently for
some time now, Harcis has
known the difficulty of the
rebuilding job he was hired to
tackle.
"Nothing surprises me,"
Harris said when asked about
the team's poor play. "It sad
dens me, but it doesn't sur
prise me because I see it in
practice. We didn't get like
this overnight, and we won't
change overnight."
"I think everything was an
uphill struggle," he added.
Shortly thereafter, the
media were escorted out of
the locker room and onto the
ramp heading out of the stadi
um. For both the reporters
heading for their cars and for
the team on their climb back
to respectability, it figures to
be a long, uphill struggle.
