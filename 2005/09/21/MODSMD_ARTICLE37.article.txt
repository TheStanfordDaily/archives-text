# Harris logs a win over Navy in season opener
## 
### ALEX GYR STAFF WRITER 
After nine long months of anticipa
tion, the Walt Harris era finally got
underway Sept. 10 at Navy Marine Corps
Memorial Stadium. It couldn't have start
ed much better for the Cardinal as
Stanford forced Navy to punt on their
first possession of the game and proceed
ed to drive the ball 73 yards fora score on
the ensuing possession.
But from that point on nothing came
easily for the Cardinal, who battled to a
41-38 win in an emotionally and physi
cally charged game.
A 47-yard field goal from the foot of
senior kicker Michael Sgroi proved to be
the difference as Navy fought until the
end, scoring two fourth-quarter touch
downs to cut the Stanford lead to a mere
three points. The Midshipmen couldn't
quite catch the Cardinal as they turned
the ball over on downs with just 53 sec
onds left in the game.
There was no shortage of offense by
either squad, as the teams combined for
nearly 900 yards. Stanford alone gained
416 yards despite the dislocated hip suf
fered by junior receiver Evan Moore late
in the first half.
Moore, who was the Cardinal's lead
ing wide receiver last season and the
recipient of a Trent Edwards' touchdown
pass on Stafford's first drive of the
game, was hurt as he was pulled down
out of bounds after a 33 yard completion
on the last drive of the first half. Moore
was taken to the hospital for treatment,
but was able to fly home with the team
following the game.
Moore wasn't the only member of
the Stanford squad to struggle with
injuries, as senior nose tackle
Babatunde Oshinowo left the game sev
eral times with two sprained ankles.
Senior safety TYevor Hooper and senior
nose tackle Matt McClernan also left
the game with injuries.

But even all that couldn't bring the
Cardinal's spirits down as they celebrat
ed their first win since Oct. 16 of last
year. In the post-game press conference
Harris seemed excited, even giddy, as he
talked about his first win as the Stanford
head coach.
"Last January 4 we blew into town,
and we've been working hard to get
everything together," Harris said. "I
think that there are a lot of outstanding
things going on. There is a lot of excite
ment surrounding our program and
we're 1-0."
While Stanford never had any real
trouble moving the ball, the Cardinal
were forced to overcome some key mis
takes that could have cost them the
game.
With just seven seconds left in the
first half, the score tied at 21 and with no
timeouts remaining, Harris opted to
attempt a quarterback run from the
Navy one-yard line, rather than passing
the ball or kicking a field goal. Edwards
was stopped just short of the goal line
and the game went to the half tied.
"That play right before the half. I
probably should have kicked the field
goal in hindsight, but I called a play that
I thought had a great chance of work
ing," Harris said. "I've got to do a better
job of coaching."
Harris also took responsibility for
another situation in which the Cardinal
could have put the game away. After an
interception by junior Nick Sanchez late
in the fourth quarter. Harris opted to
pass on three straight plays, rather than

running the ball to wind down the clock.
Only 26 seconds elapsed on the drive
and Navy took the ball 80 yards down
the field fora touchdown on the follow
ing possession to cut the Stanford lead
to three.
"The drive after Nick Sanchez inter
cepted the pass, I did a poor job myself,"
Harris said. "I'm just thankful that our
players got me off the hook. I got overly
aggressive."
The ability to fight back and over
come mistakes is part of what made the
game special for the Cardinal. After a
David Marrero fumble on a punt return
was taken in fora touchdown by the
Midshipmen, Stanford answered right
back with a 93-yard kickoff return fora
touchdown by junior T.J. Rushing.
"It was a back and forth football game
and that shows the character of our
team," Harris said. "Our team fought
back and we had to. We had to answer the
call. We had to take the fight to them."
Navy, who runs a unique spread
option offense, was never out of the
game thanks in large part to slotback
Marco Nelson who scored three touch
downs in the contest one on the Marrero
fumble, one rushing and one receiving.
The rushing duties for the Cardinal
were split between two runners who had
only two collegiate carries between them
coming into the game: sophomore
Anthony Kimble and junior Jason
Evans. The two backs combined for 121
of the team's 181 rushing yards. The
biggest run of the game, however, was a
46-yard run on a reverse fora score by
senior wide receiver Gei ren Crochet.
Edwards, who passed for 235 yards,
one score and had no interceptions, led
the aerial attack for the Cardinal.
"Trent Edwards did a lot of great
things," Harris said. "I think the future is
bright for TYent and the Cardinal. We
have to cash in a little bit better, but for
our opening game we won, and that's
what matters the most."

46-yard run on a reverse fora score by
senior wide receiver Gei ren Crochet.
Edwards, who passed for 235 yards,
one score and had no interceptions, led
the aerial attack for the Cardinal.
"Trent Edwards did a lot of great
things," Harris said. "I think the future is
bright for TYent and the Cardinal. We
have to cash in a little bit better, but for
our opening game we won, and that's
what matters the most."
