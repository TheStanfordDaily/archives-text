Anthony Kimble
Class of 2008
Running Back
A strong, elusive runner,
Kimble has taken advan
tage of the open competi
tion for starting roles caused by an
injury-plagued running corps and
the implementation of Walt Harris'
new coaching staff.
A top wide receiver recruit in
2004, the Baton Rouge. La., native
was redshirted during the 2004 cam
paign, leaving him with four
remaining seasons of NCAA eligi
bility. Converted to running back in
spring practice, the 6-foot-1, 195-
pound Kimble rose through the
depth chart.
This season, Kimble has started
the first two games of non-confer
ence play for the Cardinal, amassing
over 100 yards of rushing on only 21
carries and one touchdown.
Currently, he is the all-purpose-yard
leader of the Cardinal offense.
Sharing the ground-game duties
with junior Jason Evans in the early
season, Kimble will no doubt be
counted on to carry a heavy load of
the Stanford offense this season,
and if all goes well, he should be a
well-recognized name in Pac-10
football circles for seasons to come.

Nick Frank
Class of 2007
Fullback
Joining Kimble in the
new-look backfield, the
Cardinal have converted
defensive lineman Frank to
the starting fullback position,
where he has been solid in all
offensive categories during
the first two games of the sea
son.
Another spring-convert by
the Harris staff, the 6-foot-2
260-pound bruiser has shown
that bringing him to the
offensive side of the ball was
not a mistake, as he is current
ly the top receiver for the
Cardinal with six catches on
the season. Frank has shown
to be an effective short
yardage runner, with seven
carries and a touchdown in
the early going.
Coming onto the Stanford
scene from New Orleans,
Frank was rated as one of the
best defensive line prospects,
but in 2005 he has shown he is
just as effective on the offen
sive end and is set to be one
of the top scoring fullback
threats in the conference.

T.J. Rushing
Class of 2006
Cornerback
Playing on a strong defen
sive unit that is expected
to set the tone for
Stanford's time-of-possession.
Rushing plans to step into the
spotlight for the first time as
the key defensive back in the
Stanford secondary.
The 5-foot-11, 180-pound
Rushing has contributed with
eight starts and 99 total tack
les. Rushing is ranked fourth
on the team in tackles with 13.
Beyond his defensive duties,
though, the Oklahoma native
made a name for himself in
the special teams department
last season. This season, he
has already returned one
kickoff for 93 yards resulting
in a touchdown against Navy
and is currently averaging
63.5 yards per return on the
season.
As the Cardinal progress
into conference competition,
Rushing plans to be counted
on to lead the Stanford sec
ondary against some of the
top offensive passing teams in
the nation.

Michael Sgroi
Class of 2006
Kicker
With the kicking game set
to he a large part of the
Cardinal offensive
scheme this season, the degree of
success Stanford could enjoy might
hinge on the experienced fifth-year
senior placekicker.
Sgroi, listed at 5-foot-11, 200-
pounds, brings one of the most
experienced legs in the nation to
the Cardinal contingent this year
as Stanford's primary placekicker.
In his career at Stanford, Sgroi has
made 32 of 52 field goal attempts
and 66 of 69 extra points.
1 lis success proved to he the dif
ference in the Cardinal's season
opener against Navy, as his 40- and
47-yard fourth-quarter field goals
sealed the Stanford win. But
missed and blocked attempts in the
home opener against UC-Davis in
the second and third quarters did
n't help the Cardinal's cause. Ibe
fact that Sgroi has attempted all of
his field goals beyond forty yards
shows that Stanford has confidence
in its placekicker, and Sgroi should
have an opportunity to continue to
prove his skill as the season pro
gresses.
