No. 1 Southern California
The Trojans return nearly all of the offensive
tools from a National Championship team that
humiliated Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Senior
Matt Leinart is looking to become only the second
player to win two Ileisman Trophies in a career.
Look for the backfield tandem of juniors Reggie
Bush and LenDale White to lead USC to the Rose
Bowl and a third-straight national title.
No. 15 California
After starting junior quarterback Nate Longshore
suffered a broken leg in the Bears' opening game
against Sacramento State, there was concern that
backup freshman Joe Ayoob would hurt the Bears
chances in the Pac-10. He answered the critics one
week later, throwing for 271 yards and four touch
downs in Cal's Pacific-10 Conference opener against
Washington. With likely the best offensive line in the
conference, Cal looks poised to once again challenge
USC for the top spot in the Pac-10. Cal faces off
against the Trojans Nov. 12 at Berkeley.
No. 18 Arizona State
The Sun Devils looked good last week
against a fired-up No. 5 Louisiana State team
but couldn't hang on for the win. Junior quarter
back Sam Keller returns after leading ASU to a
stunning fourth-quarter comeback in last sea
son's Sun Bowl against Purdue, his only start of
the 2004 season. The Sun Devils' schedule is
softened by the fact that they don't face off
against Cal or take on USC at home.
Oregon
Oregon will be tested right out of the
gate this season. The Ducks play No. 23
Fresno State, No. 18 Arizona State, and No.
1 USC all within four weeks. Senior run
ning back Terrance Whitehead has big play
ability, but he has picked up only 67 rush
yards in the Ducks' first two games.
UCLA
The Bruins stumbled as a young team to a 6-6
record last season under head coach Karl Dorrell.
This year, UCLA has the experience they need to
stay competitive in the Pac-10. Tailback Maurice
Drew is off to a hot start in two games this season
and has earned a spot in the Heisman conversa
tion. The Bruins had a golden opportunity this past
weekend when they took on No. 21 Oklahoma at
home and won 41-24.
Oregon State
This season the Beavers must go without longtime
starting quarterback Derek Anderson, who graduated
with second place on the career Pac-10 passing yards
list. However, senior Mike Hass remains one of the
conference's premier receivers. The running game is
likely to be the weak point of the offense, as the
Beavers ran for only 71 yards per game last season.
Stanford
The Cardinal looked to ride the momentum of a solid
opening week win over Navy as they took on UC-Davis at
home this weekend. Despite the loss to a school still tran
sitioning into Division 1, new head coach Walt Harris has
the team looking much more competitive than in years
past. Running backs Anthony Kimble, a sophomore, and
Jason Evans, a junior, look to boost a run game that only
averaged 81.2 yards per game last season. The health sta
tus of junior star receiver Evan Moore, who suffered a dis
located hip against Navy, is a huge concern. Look for the
Cardinal to sneak up on some people in the Pac-10.
Washington State
Last seasorHhe Cougars had difficulty at
home, winning just one out of their four Pac
-10 home games. Defense remains an issue
fora team that was ninth in the conference
in points allowed. The Cougars have a dead
ly two week stretch, playing Cal and USC on
back-to-back weeks, both times on the road.
Arizona
The Wildcats are on their way up under sec
ond year head coach Mike Stoops, but it will be
another season or two before Arizona competes
in the Pac-10. The Wildcats do have some of the
best defensive backs in the conference, but an
offense that put up a measly 14.9 points per
game in 2004 remains the limiting factor.
Washington
First year head coach and Pac-10 veteran
Tyrone Willingham plans to do his best to
turn around a team that won only one game
last season. It doesn't look to be an easy
assignment fora squad that finished last in
the Pac-10 in almost every offensive catego
ry last season. The Huskies have already
dropped two home games this season,
including a last second loss to Air Force.
