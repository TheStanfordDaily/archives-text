# University bands together for Katrina relief efforts, helps displaced students
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
Whether it's the Office of Undergraduate Admission
or the Department of Athletics, various University divi
sions have coordinated an extensive relief effort to aid
survivors and recovery from the devastation of
Hurricane Katrina.
The University has been working to contact all
Stanford students from the hurricane-affected areas to
provide assistance. The Registrar's office generated a list
of both undergraduate and graduate students with home
addresses listed for Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana,
totaling 106. Since it includes students from throughout
the three states, it is actually larger than the number of
students who may have been affected by Hurricane
Katrina, according to Lee Connor, special assistant to the
dean of student affairs.
There have been no reported casualties or missing
persons, although "communication in the area has been
very difficult and sporadic," according to Dean of Student
Affairs Greg Boardman.
The President's Office arranged a meeting of several
senior administrators representing different offices short
ly after Katrina struck.
"Stanford is committed to help," began a statement
released by University President John Hennessy in
response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A Web
site, hurricanekatrina.stanford.edu, was also set up to
publicize University initiatives. Below is a sampling of the
Stanford efforts to assist hurricane survivors.
Relief projects
underway

Admission and Financial Aid
Stanford is using an online application
process to admit academically-qualified stu
dents from colleges and universities that have
been closed due to the hurricane as part of a
one-quarter guest program.
The Office of Financial Aid is accepting
requests for assistance from Stanford stu
dents from the Gulf Coast, including those
who have not previously received financial
aid, as well as the non-degree guest students.
"Given the tragedy these young people
have faced, Stanford is being flexible in terms
of working with students and their families to
assess the level of need given the change in
circumstances," said Richard Shaw, dean of
undergraduate admission and financial aid,
who replaced Robin Mamlet in June.
Stanford admitted 36 guest students
before closing the process on Sept. 14. Of the
students who were accepted, 28 will be
enrolling, including three freshmen, seven
sophomores, eight juniors and 10 seniors.
Although priority was given to those from
the Bay Area, Stanford accepted students from
across the nation for the fall quarter. The stu
dents, who are coming from Tulane University,
Loyola University of New Orleans, Dillard
University and Xavier University of Louisiana,
will be able to study tuition free.
"The concept is that those students who
attend Stanford this Fall Quarter will pay
tuition to their home institutions to assist with
the rebuilding efforts," Shaw said. "It seemed
obvious that [reaching out to students from
the Gulf Coast region] is something Stanford
would want to do after such an extraordinary
tragedy."
The guest student program will take effect
for one quarter only, Shaw emphasized.
Students will be expected to return to their
home campuses in the winter. Additionally,
students were evaluated based only on their
test scores and transcripts when offered
admission.
Housing and Residential Education
Current Stanford students from affected
Gulf Coast communities who needed to
return to housing at Stanford early were able
to do so at no charge, including a meal plan.
As of last week, only six to eight continuing
students had expressed interest in returning
to campus early, according to Todd Benson,
director of Housing Assignments Services.
"Resident fellows and college directors
received the names of all of their future resi
dents who were impacted by the hurricane
and the resulting dramatic weather following
it," said Jane Camarillo, director of
Residential Education. "They offered support
and encouragement as well as the early hous
ing if [students] needed it."
Undergraduate and graduate guest stu
dents are eligible to fill vacancies left by
Stanford students who are studying abroad —
45 undergraduate housing openings this fall.
Fifteen of those have been awarded to guest
students, who will have to pay for room and
board. But there are alternatives for those
who are unable to do so.
"There have been some very generous
offers of housing support from local commu
nity members and many local Stanford alum
ni in surrounding areas who have offered
rooms in their homes to hurricane-affected
students coming here as needed," said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing.
New Student Orientation

The Freshman Dean's Office has been
asked to help the visiting students make a
smooth transition to Stanford, and visiting
students have been invited to attend New
Student Orientation, or NSO, which started
yesterday.
"While we realize that most of [the guest
students] have been to orientation at their
home institution, [Stanford NSO] will provide
them with an opportunity to get acquainted
with Stanford's resources and the community
they will be joining," said Krista Zizzo, direc
tor of outreach and assessment in the
Freshman Dean's Office.
Visiting students are encouraged to join
the transfer community events, which would
enable them to meet a smaller group of new
students who are also coming to Stanford
from another university, Zizzo said.
"The Freshman Dean's Office reached out
to incoming freshmen who live in areas that
may have been affected by the hurricane to
make sure they are okay, and to see if they
had any needs we could address," said Jim
Kim, assistant dean of freshmen.
Each guest student will be assigned an
undergraduate advisor through
Undergraduate Advising Programs. The advi
sors of current students affected by the hurri
cane wilJ also be notified of the special cir
cumstances.
Stanford Medical School
Prof. Eric A. Weiss explained on the
Stanford School of Medicine Web site last
week that the Stanford Medical Center and
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital are work
ing with the United States Department of
Health and Human Services to help staff med
ical tents setup for victims of the hurricane.
According to Weiss, over 100 physicians,
nurses and ancillary staff have signed up to
help provide medical support, and the
Medical School plans to eventually provide
"an entire cadre of health care providers and
ancillary help to staff one of these tents" for
two to four weeks.
"I have been very impressed with the
tremendous amount of support and willing
ness to volunteer from all of the staff at

Stanford," Weiss stated.
Stanford Law School
Stanford Law School opened its doors to
five displaced third-year law students from
Hilane University for the fall term. The law
school has waived tuition for these students,
allowing their home schools to keep tuition
already paid to help compensate staff and fac
ulty, all of which are being kept on payroll, in
hopes that work will resume before the end of
the semester.
"Given the scale of the tragedy, our efforts
are small, but we hope not meaningless," said
Larry Kramer, dean of the Law School.
"Students who were working toward their
professional careers at Hilane and Loyola
were about to have those careers disrupted
and delayed, with all the attendant problems.
Hopefully, we can help them avoid that and
enable them to keep their lives on track."
Christian Dallman, one of the visiting stu
dents from TUlane, said he has been "humbled
and amazed" by the outpouring of support.
"Although the circumstances of my arrival
seem dire. I find myself in a better place than
many of those who were affected by
Hurricane Katrina,so I have little to complain
about," Dallman said. "Everyone at Stanford
Law has been incredibly gracious and I look
forward to spending the semester here."
Graduate Schools
The Registrar's Office provided assistance
for graduate degree programs in Earth
Sciences, Education, Engineering and
Humanities and Sciences. The office received
eight applications from affected graduate stu
dents. After reviewing the students' qualifica
tions, it forwarded the applications to the spe
cific departments for decisions, according to
Kate Chesley, associate director of University
communications.
The School of Earth Sciences has heard
from one student from llilane, and they
expect to hear from more. The school is
already housing the chair of the Louisiana
State University Geology Department.
The School of Engineering has not yet
capped the number of graduate students it

will accept from the region, but they will
accept only displaced engineering students
that would normally qualify for admission,
Chesley explained.
Stanford Alumni Association
There are 251 Stanford alumni currently
living in the official disaster zone and 674 liv
ing in the Gulf region, according to Stanford
Alumni Association President Howard Wolf,
class of 1980. The staff at the association has
been trying for the past week to get in touch
with alumni in the area to understand both
their status and needs.
On Thursday, Sept. 9, Wolf sent an e-mail
to over 110,000 Stanford alumni around the
world — the total number for whom they
have e-mail addresses — informing them
both of Stanford's response to Hurricane
Katrina and of an online clearinghouse
designed to help Stanford alumni affected.
The clearinghouse is located on the associ
ation's Web site, www.stanfordalumni.org,
within the InCircle virtual online community.
To date, there have been a multitude of posts
from both those in need and those offering
assistance. These needs have included hous
ing, work and professional clothing.
"In one representative case, a request for
professional women's clothing was met with
eight offers of assistance within minutes of the
original posting," Wolf said. "Similar matches
have occurred for housing."
Department of Athletics
For the first time since 1929, the Stanford
Golf Course was opened for public play on
Monday, Sept. 19. Collections from the capac
ity crowd of 300 players generated an estimat
ed $30,000 that will be donated to the
American Red Cross for the Hurricane
Katrina Relief Effort.
Stanford will also be accepting donations
to relief efforts at women's volleyball, men's
soccer and football games. Boxes will be avail
able at venue entrances to collect public
donations, according to a press release from
the Stanford News Service.
In addition, men's basketball coach TVent
Johnson is auctioning off four premium seats

to the Stanford vs. Denver game on Dec. 19
and will take the winning bidder to breakfast
the next morning. The auction will be run on
the Web site AllCoachesCare.com and pro
ceeds will go to Habitat for Humanity. Last
winter, Stanford basketball and the Sixth Man
Club raised almost $4,000 for tsunami sur
vivors in South and East Asia.
Student Efforts
On Sept. 7, over 45 staff members, students
and faculty met at the Black Community
Services Center (BCSC) to share their stories
of loss and hope and to formulate a plan to
help those in need. The group formed four
committees focusing on immediate needs,
communication, relocation efforts and long
range rebuilding.
"As members of the Stanford family, we
know that we sit in the seat of privilege, and
we felt that we cannot continue to watch [the
relief efforts]; we need to try to make a differ
ence," said Jan Barker, director of the BCSC.
The group has developed an information
al Web site katrinahelp.stanford.edu to help
students learn about how they can volunteer.
In addition, the group's immediate needs
committee is planning its first of a series of
monthly donation drives for personal items
for the week of Sept. 19.
"To the degree possible, we are trying to
make sure that the donations have an imme
diate impact on the families and individuals in
need," said Sally Dickson, associate vice
provost for faculty development and co-chair
of the immediate needs committee. The com
mittee has been working primarily to distrib
ute donations through churches in Texas and
the Gulf Coast.
"It is important to realize that the after
math of Hurricane Katrina is not something
that is going to be cured in a month," Dickson
added. "People should think of this as a long
term project."
Stanford Students for Relief (SSR), which
was originally created to respond to the
tsunami in Asia, will centralize the disaster
relief fundraising process for student groups.
These groups will need to submit all propos
als for benefit fundraisers to SSR before they
are passed to the Office of Student Activities
for approval.
"Currently SSR is in the process of recruit
ing a core group of graduate and undergradu
ate students to help in two key ways," said
Donna Winston, a second-year doctoral stu
dent in the School of Education who is leading
SSR's efforts. "First, a group is needed for
selecting a few 501(c)(3) organizations to be
designated as beneficiaries of Stanford student
initiated fundraisers. Secondly, members of this
core group would review the plans student
groups submitted for proposed fundraisers."
The ASSU is working in conjunction with
SSR leadership to streamline communication
among student groups and the general stu
dent body. In addition, a working team of
Stanford students, Stanford Concert Network
employees and ASSU staff members are
organizing a benefit relief concert.
"We truly sympathize with those whose
family and friends have been affected, and we
are committed to doing whatever is in our
power to provide help," said ASSU President
Melanie Kannokada, a senior. "While we are
still defining our unique role, we've been able
to provide logistical guidance and our connec
tions with staff to help students get the
resources they need."
Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) in
tandem with the ASSU, will collect employee
donations that will be matched up to $15,000
from SSE business income, and the Chief
Executive Officer of SSE, Justin Fishner-
Wolfson, also the ASSU's financial manager,
said he will personally match $5,000. SSE and
the ASSU hope to contribute at least $30,000
to the relief efforts.
University initiatives in progress include
donation drives for items like bedding, toi
letries and diapers. A memorial service was
held last Thursday in Memorial Church for
victims of the hurricane and the Office of
Religious Life is also accepting donations on
behalf of the Red Cross.
University Employees
University employees approved to partici
pate in the disaster relief effort may take up to
one week of paid leave time. Stanford will
match the employee's leave time on a one-for
one basis with up to five days of paid special
leave to be taken at the same time for disaster
relief purposes, according the University's
main Web site.
