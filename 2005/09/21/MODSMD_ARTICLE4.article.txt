Whether it's the Office of Undergraduate Admission
or the Department of Athletics, various University divi
sions have coordinated an extensive relief effort to aid
survivors and recovery from the devastation of
Hurricane Katrina.
The University has been working to contact all
Stanford students from the hurricane-affected areas to
provide assistance. The Registrar's office generated a list
of both undergraduate and graduate students with home
addresses listed for Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana,
totaling 106. Since it includes students from throughout
the three states, it is actually larger than the number of
students who may have been affected by Hurricane
Katrina, according to Lee Connor, special assistant to the
dean of student affairs.
There have been no reported casualties or missing
persons, although "communication in the area has been
very difficult and sporadic," according to Dean of Student
Affairs Greg Boardman.
The President's Office arranged a meeting of several
senior administrators representing different offices short
ly after Katrina struck.
"Stanford is committed to help," began a statement
released by University President John Hennessy in
response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A Web
site, hurricanekatrina.stanford.edu, was also set up to
publicize University initiatives. Below is a sampling of the
Stanford efforts to assist hurricane survivors.
