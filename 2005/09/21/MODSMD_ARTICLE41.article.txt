# Defending champs to face tough Pac-10
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI 
One season removed from win
ning its sixth National Championship
in school history, Stanford women's
volleyball looks to fend off a brutal
Pacific-10 Conference schedule on its
path to title defense.
The Cardinal is off to an 11-1
start, with the team's most recent win
coming against No. 24 UC-Santa
Barbara in the final game of the
Stanford Invitational at Maples
Pavilion. Stanford also collected
impressive 3-0 victories over St.
Mary's and Utah State on the earlier
nights of the Stanford Invitational.
"I think our team is looking really
good as of right now," junior outside
hitter Kristin Richards said. "We're
really young, which is something new.
Our freshmen have really stepped
up, and the dynamic is really awe
some on the court. There's a lot of
energy, a lot of hard work going on,
so I'm excited about our season."
Stanford's only loss so far this sea
son came to top-ranked Nebraska in
the championship match of the
AVCA/NACWAA Showcase in
Omaha. Neb. on Aug. 27. The
Cornhuskers took all three games,
30-23,31-29,33-31, ending Stanford's
16-match winning streak dating back
to last season. Richards led the team
with 13 kills, 10 digs and two blocks.
The evening before falling to the
Huskers, Stanford outlasted No. 5
Penn State in five games in the first

No. 12 USC
September 23

round of the showcase. Playing in her
first collegiate match, freshman out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza notched
22 kills in 47 attempts with a .632 hit
ting percentage.
The Cardinal ended a seven
match. 11-day road trip by winning
the Colorado Invitational with a 3-0
victory over Creighton on Aug. 10.
Freshman middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo raked in 41 kills and six
blocks over three games on her way
to Tournament MVP honors.
Stanford collected wins over
Maine and Syracuse in the Boston
College Invitational. Sophomore set
ter Bryn Kehoe was named tourna
ment MVP. and Akinradewo and
Richards secured All-Tournament
honors.
This season marks the team's
return to the newly-renovated
Maples Pavilion after playing last
season in Burnham Pavilion, which
could give the Cardinal a stronger
home-court advantage.

But Stanford might need more
than the extra roaring fans to earn
hack-to-back championships. Six
Pac-10 teams are nationally ranked,
including No. 2 Washington, No. 11
UCLA, and No. 12 Southern
California. Pac-10 teams have cap
tured the past four national titles.
The Cardinal are scheduled to
battle No. 12 USC (4-4) this Friday at
7 p.m. in Maples. The Women of Troy
split their two-match series with
Stanford in 2004 and finished the
year with a 23-6 record. The Trojans
are led by two-time Ail-American
senior middle blocker Bibiana
Candelas, who notched a career-high
23 kills in USC's 3-0 sweep over
Pepperdine last Friday night.
Saturday afternoon. No. 11
UCLA (7-2) visits Stanford after
dropping both matches to the
Cardinal last season. The Bruins
graduated five seniors in 2004,
including three Ail-Americans. The
young Bruins feature last season's
Pac-10 leading blocker in junior
Nana Meriwether.
With the heart of the conference
season looming, the Cardinal
remains confident, especially with a
talented incoming class.
"Losing [All-American] Oganna
[Nnamani] was a big deal, but our
freshmen have really stepped up,
and the dynamic is really awesome
on the court," Richards said. "We
