# Freshmen squad gives Card a new lease on life
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Anyone watching the Stanford
women's volleyball team over the
first few weeks of the preseason
would not have been able to miss
freshman Foluke Akinradewo —
"Luke" to her teammates. The 6-
foot-3 middle blocker in goggles
— a preventative measure after
she once took a ball in the eye —
is an imposing physical presence.
Long before starting her first
class at Stanford, Akinradewo
stands out on the court by leading
the offensive efforts of the
defending national champion
Cardinal, picking up an All-
Tournament award at the Boston
College Invitational and the MVP
award at the Colorado
Invitational along the way. She
picked up the Pacific-10
Conference Player of the Week
after leading the team to three
sweeps in Colorado with 52 kills
on .578 hitting.
Watching Akinradewo play —
with her incredible athletic ability
and quick, powerful swing — one
would assume that much like

every other player on the Stanford
roster, she spent her middle school
and high school years on elite club
teams. That would be wrong.
Akinradewo only picked up vol
leyball as a high school sopho
more and has never played club
ball.
"My high school coach my
freshman year wanted me to come
in and play, but I said, 'No, I've
never played before,'"
Akinradewo said. "I didn't want to
do it, but she kept bothering me,
and the people on the team kept
bothering me. So I said, 'I'll try it
this one time. If I don't like it, I
won't do it.' But then I ended up
loving it, so I've been playing it
ever since."
At the time, Akinradewo was
playing basketball and running
track for St. Thomas Aquinas High
School in Florida. Her size made
her a star center on the basketball
court and her amazing jumping
ability - she can easily touch
above 10 feet - made her a cham
pion triple jumper for the track
team, for which she also ran
sprints and relays. She was twice
named All-State in basketball and

won state titles in track every
year. Her success in both sports
helped develop her volleyball tal
ent.
"Volleyball is very physical,"
she said. "I didn't think it was
before, but it definitely is; so hav
ing played basketball, where you
have to be quick on your feet, and
running track has helped me a lot
with my game."
It would seem that
Akinradewo, already an athletic
standout, would have been a natu
ral at volleyball, but she claims
that her first days on the court
were not as successful and awe
inspiring as her first weeks in a
Stanford uniform.
"It was really, really ugly when
I first started," she said. "I was
really bad. But I had great coach
es, and I would watch other play
ers and try to do what they'd do
and model myself after them."
Good coaching, her own study
of the game and her athleticism
allowed Akinradewo to improve
quickly. So quickly that she found
herself playing on the USA Youth
National Team that summer, only
months after she first stepped
onto the court. While she has
never played on a club squad, she
has spent every summer since
2003 in the USA Volleyball sys
tem, including playing on the
Junior National Team in 2005
alongside Stanford sophomore
setter Bryn Kehoe.
"It is a big difference [between
high school and college volley
ball]," she said. "But 1 did play with
the Junior National Team, and I
think that's where I learned a lot
about the game. So I carry what I
learned there onto the court here.

If I hadn't done the Junior
National Team, it would have been
really hard because I know from
high school it is a huge step."
Her experiences with elite vol
leyball and previous time on the
court with her Stanford team
mates has helped ease
Akinradewo's transition from
high school star — she received
several Florida Player of the Year
awards as a senior — to a force to
be reckoned with on the national
collegiate scene.
"We adapted pretty quickly,"
Akinradewo said. "The people on
the team help a lot with team
chemistry. Everyone is always
encouraging me, so 1 don't feel
like I'm that new kid, but more
like I have been with them fora
long time."
In addition to playing with

Kehoe this year, she has spent
summers playing with junior
Kristin Richards, sophomore
Franci Girard and fellow fresh
man Cynthia Barboza. The con
nection between Akinradewo and
Kehoe has been especially evident
this season, with the two running
quick and creative attacks in sync.
After the Cardinal's victory
over Saint Mary's on Thursday,
Stanford's 10th match of the sea
son, Akinradewo had already
compiled a team-leading 134 kills
while hitting .421, the highest
number among starters. Her 37
blocks, including eight solo, is also
the best mark on a team with sev
eral strong blockers.
Even Akinradewo herself is
surprised by her immediate suc
cess and starring role on a deep
Stanford roster.

"I just expected to come out
here and support the team any
way I could," she said. "I didn't
expect to go in or anything. It's
been a lot of fun, and I have been
grateful for that opportunity."
Having proved herself on the
court, Akinradewo is ready to
tackle the other part of being a
Stanford student-athlete. An antic
ipated Human Biology major who
eventually wants to practice sports
medicine, Akinradewo is eager for
New Student Orientation and the
beginning of classes.
"I'm really excited for more
people to come and school to
start," she said. "I am a little nerv
ous, but really excited."
If her performance in the class
room is anything like it is on the
court, Akinradewo has nothing to
worry about.
