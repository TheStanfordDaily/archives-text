# Varellas next in long line of distinguished captains

### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
As the No. 4 men's water polo team (3-0.
1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
opens its season in pursuit of the 2005
NCAA title, a number of questions still
remain about the final form this year's
squad will take. After losing five of their
seven starters to graduation last June, the
Cardinal face the difficult challenge of
determining the new role each member of
the squad will fill.
But amidst this sea of uncertainties, the
Cardinal have complete confidence in one
player whose contribution to the team will
be invaluable — senior captain Peter
Varellas.
With a superlative 2004 campaign in
which he notched 56 goals en route to Ail-
American and NCAA All-Tournament
team selections. Varellas proved himself
ready to follow in the rich tradition of the
team's captaincy, which he will share this
season with fellow senior Thomas Hopkins.
It might come as a surprise, though, to learn
that the path Varellas has followed to this
point in his career has contained more than
a few ironic twists and developments.
The irony starts at the very beginning,
with the fact that Varellas grew up right
across the bay in Moraga, Calif. — less than
a two-hour drive from the Farm. As a prod
uct of Northern California, Varellas helps to
debunk the popular myth that high-caliber
water polo players hail only from sunny
southern California and abroad.
But that's not to say that water polo had
a fanatical following around Varellas' home
town — not by any stretch of the imagina
tion. Growing up. Varellas swam in a recre
ational league during the summer, but he
always envisioned himself becoming a two
sport athlete — and neither one of those
sports involved water.
"1 headed into high school thinking 1 was
going to do basketball in the winter and
baseball in the spring," Varellas said.
"Swimming wasn't a w-hole lot more than a
summer thing for me."
That view didn't change even when
Varellas suffered a knee injury while playing
first base for his all-star baseball team as a
seventh grader. After several rounds of sur
gery, Varellas was able to get back into ath
letic competition, but initially his action was
limited to the pool. Still, his knee's condition
wasn't enough to convince Varellas to pur
sue an aquatic sport that would minimize the
amount of stressful impact on his leg.
"The first thing [I was able to doj was to
swim, so I used one leg to push off the walls
in mv first meet back," Varellas said. "But

even so, I wasn't really committed to swim
ming any more after that."
As freshman year of high school
approached, Varellas still intended to go out
for basketball and baseball, and he never
entertained the thought of playing water
polo in the fall — until his father intervened
and completely changed the course of his
son's life.
"The night before fall training started for
water polo I wasn't planning on going out
for the team," Varellas said. "But my dad
convinced me to go try it fora week and
said that if I did it fora week and didn't like
it, fine. So 1 did it and ended up sticking with
it."
The rest is history, as far as the story of
Varellas' development into a collegiate
water polo star is concerned. The irony of
the story is the fact that water polo ultimate
ly landed Varellas here with the Cardinal —
the bitter rivals of his father's California
Golden Bears. Varellas acknowledges the
ironic result of his father's early suggestion,
but he insists that neither of his parents, who
both attended Cal, had any problem at all
with his decision to come to Stanford.
"Actually, I think all along they wanted
me to fcome here]," Varellas said.
Looking back on the path his life has
taken thus far. Varellas attributes much of
the success and many of the opportunites he
has found to his father's guidance.
"[He]'s really made some of the best
decisions for me — whether 1 knew it at the
time or not." Varellas said. "He's had some
good foresight and vision for my future and
he basically saw right away that (water polo)
was something that could help me get into
college."
But early on. the nature of Varellas'
development as a water polo player might
have been enough to cast a shadow t>f doubt
on those expectations. At a point when
many of Varellas' current Stanford team
mates found themselves entering estab
lished water polo programs as high school
freshmen. Varellas found himself jumping
into a low-quality pool at Moraga's
Campolindo High School to practice with a
junior varsity team that didn't even have a
coach.
"Pretty much what happened was the
varsity coach would come over to our pool,
give us a drill to do, then basically leave for
the next two hours," Varellas said. "We'd do
[the drill] for about 35 minutes, realize what
was going on and then just mess around."
Even so. Varellas apparently built up the
necessary basis of fundamental skills that
year and went on to make the varsity squad
as a sophomore — that's when his transfor
mation into a water polo player finally took

place.
"That's when I really started loving
[water polo] ," Varellas said. "Later that year
I did the preseason workouts for basketball.
But I'd been on varsity water polo and had
felt what it was like to really like what 1 was
doing, and then all of a sudden 1 just didn't
enjoy basketball that much."
The decision to quit basketball was fol
lowed shortly by the decision to quit base
ball. which Varellas gave up in order to swim
during the spring. And in combination with
the establishment of a local water polo club
team, Varellas all of a sudden had the
opportunity to pursue his newfound passion
year-round.
Less than a year after closing out his high
school career — tallying 157 points and 118
steals as a senior — Varellas found himself
mixed into the action of the Stanford men's
2002 season, which ultimately culminated
with a victory over California in the NCAA
title game.
But throughout his entire Stanford
career, Varellas has always had a senior
teammate to look up to for advice or inspi
ration — until now. After the departure of
last year's senior class and redshirt junior
Chad Taylor. Varellas — who won't turn 21
until Oct. 2 — finds himself viewed as the
team's seasoned veteran. It's a status, he
admits, to which he hasn't completely
adjusted.
"I am more of a lead by example guy. but
I do have to force myself to realize that I am
that [senior veteran] to some of these other
guys on the team," Varellas said. "I don't
think that way naturally, but I do try to be as
much of a leader as I can be out there.
Hopefully my example speaks more than
anything."
But during his time with the Cardinal,
Varellas has observed Stanford water polo
legends Tony Azevedo. Jeff Ntsmit and
Peter Hudnut fill the same veteran roie, and
it is from their examples that he finds the
perfect model to follow.
"I've gotten to play with some of the best
and I've learned from all of them." Varellas
said. "So my attitude is basically to never be
satisfied — I'm always thinking about what
else I can get done out there and how I can
help my teammates improve and learn from
them, because there's always a new level
you can take it to."
The Cardinal — who have lost the
NCAA title game in overtime the last two
seasons — understand that final sentiment
as well as anyone. So no matter what course
it may take, Varellas and his teammates are
determined to forge their season's path to a
destination literally one level higher — the
NCAA champions' platform.

seven starters to graduation last June, the
Cardinal face the difficult challenge of
determining the new role each member of
the squad will fill.
But amidst this sea of uncertainties, the
Cardinal have complete confidence in one
player whose contribution to the team will
be invaluable — senior captain Peter
Varellas.
With a superlative 2004 campaign in
which he notched 56 goals en route to Ail-
American and NCAA All-Tournament
team selections. Varellas proved himself
ready to follow in the rich tradition of the
team's captaincy, which he will share this
season with fellow senior Thomas Hopkins.
It might come as a surprise, though, to learn
that the path Varellas has followed to this
point in his career has contained more than
a few ironic twists and developments.
The irony starts at the very beginning,
with the fact that Varellas grew up right
across the bay in Moraga, Calif. — less than
a two-hour drive from the Farm. As a prod
uct of Northern California, Varellas helps to
debunk the popular myth that high-caliber
water polo players hail only from sunny
southern California and abroad.
But that's not to say that water polo had
a fanatical following around Varellas' home
town — not by any stretch of the imagina
tion. Growing up. Varellas swam in a recre
ational league during the summer, but he
always envisioned himself becoming a two
sport athlete — and neither one of those
sports involved water.
"1 headed into high school thinking 1 was
going to do basketball in the winter and
baseball in the spring," Varellas said.
"Swimming wasn't a w-hole lot more than a
summer thing for me."
That view didn't change even when
Varellas suffered a knee injury while playing
first base for his all-star baseball team as a
seventh grader. After several rounds of sur
gery, Varellas was able to get back into ath
letic competition, but initially his action was
limited to the pool. Still, his knee's condition
wasn't enough to convince Varellas to pur
sue an aquatic sport that would minimize the
amount of stressful impact on his leg.
"The first thing [I was able to doj was to
swim, so I used one leg to push off the walls
in mv first meet back," Varellas said. "But

even so, I wasn't really committed to swim
ming any more after that."
As freshman year of high school
approached, Varellas still intended to go out
for basketball and baseball, and he never
entertained the thought of playing water
polo in the fall — until his father intervened
and completely changed the course of his
son's life.
"The night before fall training started for
water polo I wasn't planning on going out
for the team," Varellas said. "But my dad
convinced me to go try it fora week and
said that if I did it fora week and didn't like
it, fine. So 1 did it and ended up sticking with
it."
The rest is history, as far as the story of
Varellas' development into a collegiate
water polo star is concerned. The irony of
the story is the fact that water polo ultimate
ly landed Varellas here with the Cardinal —
the bitter rivals of his father's California
Golden Bears. Varellas acknowledges the
ironic result of his father's early suggestion,
but he insists that neither of his parents, who
both attended Cal, had any problem at all
with his decision to come to Stanford.
"Actually, I think all along they wanted
me to fcome here]," Varellas said.
Looking back on the path his life has
taken thus far. Varellas attributes much of
the success and many of the opportunites he
has found to his father's guidance.
"[He]'s really made some of the best
decisions for me — whether 1 knew it at the
time or not." Varellas said. "He's had some
good foresight and vision for my future and
he basically saw right away that (water polo)
was something that could help me get into
college."
But early on. the nature of Varellas'
development as a water polo player might
have been enough to cast a shadow t>f doubt
on those expectations. At a point when
many of Varellas' current Stanford team
mates found themselves entering estab
lished water polo programs as high school
freshmen. Varellas found himself jumping
into a low-quality pool at Moraga's
Campolindo High School to practice with a
junior varsity team that didn't even have a
coach.
"Pretty much what happened was the
varsity coach would come over to our pool,
give us a drill to do, then basically leave for
the next two hours," Varellas said. "We'd do
[the drill] for about 35 minutes, realize what
was going on and then just mess around."
Even so. Varellas apparently built up the
necessary basis of fundamental skills that
year and went on to make the varsity squad
as a sophomore — that's when his transfor
mation into a water polo player finally took

place.
"That's when I really started loving
[water polo] ," Varellas said. "Later that year
I did the preseason workouts for basketball.
But I'd been on varsity water polo and had
felt what it was like to really like what 1 was
doing, and then all of a sudden 1 just didn't
enjoy basketball that much."
The decision to quit basketball was fol
lowed shortly by the decision to quit base
ball. which Varellas gave up in order to swim
during the spring. And in combination with
the establishment of a local water polo club
team, Varellas all of a sudden had the
opportunity to pursue his newfound passion
year-round.
Less than a year after closing out his high
school career — tallying 157 points and 118
steals as a senior — Varellas found himself
mixed into the action of the Stanford men's
2002 season, which ultimately culminated
with a victory over California in the NCAA
title game.
But throughout his entire Stanford
career, Varellas has always had a senior
teammate to look up to for advice or inspi
ration — until now. After the departure of
last year's senior class and redshirt junior
Chad Taylor. Varellas — who won't turn 21
until Oct. 2 — finds himself viewed as the
team's seasoned veteran. It's a status, he
admits, to which he hasn't completely
adjusted.
"I am more of a lead by example guy. but
I do have to force myself to realize that I am
that [senior veteran] to some of these other
guys on the team," Varellas said. "I don't
think that way naturally, but I do try to be as
much of a leader as I can be out there.
Hopefully my example speaks more than
anything."
But during his time with the Cardinal,
Varellas has observed Stanford water polo
legends Tony Azevedo. Jeff Ntsmit and
Peter Hudnut fill the same veteran roie, and
it is from their examples that he finds the
perfect model to follow.
"I've gotten to play with some of the best
and I've learned from all of them." Varellas
said. "So my attitude is basically to never be
satisfied — I'm always thinking about what
else I can get done out there and how I can
help my teammates improve and learn from
them, because there's always a new level
you can take it to."
The Cardinal — who have lost the
NCAA title game in overtime the last two
seasons — understand that final sentiment
as well as anyone. So no matter what course
it may take, Varellas and his teammates are
determined to forge their season's path to a
destination literally one level higher — the
NCAA champions' platform.
As the No. 4 men's water polo team (3-0.
1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
opens its season in pursuit of the 2005
NCAA title, a number of questions still
remain about the final form this year's
squad will take. After losing five of their
seven starters to graduation last June, the
Cardinal face the difficult challenge of
determining the new role each member of
the squad will fill.
But amidst this sea of uncertainties, the
