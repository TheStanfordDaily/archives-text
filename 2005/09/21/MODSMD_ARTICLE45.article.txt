# Men determined to bring back title
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
For the No. 4 men's water polo team (3-
0, 1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation),
the key to success this season may lie in the
most unlikely of places — the squad's col
lective memory of its heart-breaking over
time loss to UCLA in last season's NCAA
title game.
Though the memory of such a dramatic
shortcoming might seem an ironic source of
strength and optimism, the members of this
year's Cardinal squad are approaching
their 2005 campaign fiercely determined to
bring a great positive out of a great nega
tive.
"It's a really bad way to end a season,"
senior captain Peter Varellas said, in refer
ence to the conclusion of his team's 2004
campaign. "But it's actually a pretty good
way to start a season, because it makes you
so much hungrier for the next year."
In a sense, then, the fate of the
Cardinal's coming season hinges upon their
ability to transform that hunger into effec
tive performances against the top teams in
the nation.
Nevertheless, despite losing water polo
legend Tony Azevedo, goalie Chad Taylor
and three other starters to graduation, the
Cardinal feel confident that the lineups
they can put in the water match up to those
of any other team in the nation.
Rising to fill the team's leadership void
are senior captains Thomas Hopkins and
Varellas. Last season, the talented pair of
drivers combined to net 116 goals and fin
ished. respectively, as the team's second and
third leading scorers. But perhaps more
importantly, each player demonstrated the
ability to elevate his game under pressure
— for their efforts in helping the Cardinal
battle to within two goals of the champi
onship. both Hopkins and Varellas were
named NCAA All-Tournament first-team
selections. In their final seasons on the
Farm, both players seek to lead their team
to a repeat of Stanford's NCAA title in 2002
— the year Hopkins and Varellas began
their illustrious careers with the Cardinal.
Rounding out the team's driver corps
are juniors Marcello Pantuliano and Tyler
Drake, redshirt sophomore Ryan Fortune,
sophomore Steven Wright and incoming
freshman Chris Jacobson.The Cardinal will
depend upon Pantuliano to put into action
his experience guiding the offense from the
perimeter, while Fortune and Drake will be
expected to take on increased scoring roles.
Wright and Jacobson will continue to be
worked into the team's offensive schemes
as crucial reserves over the course of the

season. Jacobson. one of three freshmen
playing for the Cardinal squad this season,
has quickly earned the respect of his team
mates for his tenacious style of play.
"He's a grinder and a really scrappy
player who keeps things active," Varellas
said.
The two players who have defined them
selves as essential components of the
Cardinal offensive at the 2-meter mark are
sophomore Michael Bury and freshman
William Hindle-Katel. Both will shoulder
the invaluable responsibilities of battling
opposing teams' big men for position down
low and, along with junior J.J. Garton. will
be called upon to wear down opposing
players with physical play in the defensive
zone. Redshirt sophomore Forrest
Schwartz and sophomores Peter Finlayson,
Michael McCaffery and Andrew Drake will
all help to fill versatile utility roles on the
squad in valuable situations this year.
At this point in the season, the squad's
goaltending situation seems far from
resolved. Sophomore Sandy Hohener has
started two of the team's three games thus
far, but junior Beau Stockstill, redshirt jun
ior David Carlson and freshman Jimmy
Sandman have all contributed minutes and
saves. But according to Hopkins, the goalie
situation is no different than the situation at
any other position at this early point in the
season.
"There's basically an early assessment
going on with all the players on the team."
Hopkins said. "So right now is our time to
get a feel for who it's going be [in the start
ing lineup later this year]."
The Cardinal believe they have the tal
ent to compete at the highest level, so the
true challenge will be to execute with a con
sistency that allows them to realize this
potential. Only with a commitment to prac
tice and preparation can a team expect to
succeed in this respect, and not coinciden
tally that commitment is what Varellas sees
as one of his team's defining points.
"One thing about our team is that we're
really smart out there." Varellas said. "The
guys here are willing and able to think
clearly through fatigue, and make better
decisions because their work ethic is great."
When asked t« comment on his team's
ability to make the adage "third time's a
charm" ring true by bringing home an
NCAA championship for the first time
since 2002, Varellas didn't hesitate with his
response.
"It's absolutely doable." he said. "We
can clearly beat any team on any given day.
Our margin of error is slim — we know that
— but we definitely have the talent and
teamwork to get it done."
