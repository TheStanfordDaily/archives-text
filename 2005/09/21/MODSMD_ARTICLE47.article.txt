The Stanford field hockey squad (2-8)
began its season with an overtime loss
against Miami at home on Aug. 27. The
tough start seems to have led the team down
a rocky road, and the Cardinal have faced
several challenging matches since then.
Nevertheless, the team moves forward,
focusing on the fact that it is making the har
rowing trip as a team that is bonding and
learning.
Among those tough matches was a 0-3
loss against Michigan State, who advanced
deep into NCAA competition last year.
"I think one of our best games was
against Michigan State, a Final Four team,"
sophomore forward / midfielder Jess Zutz
said. "We just had some unlucky breaks but
we really played our hearts out."
Several players indicate that the team
shares a unique bond that is essential in
maintaining unity and working well togeth
er.
"We have amazing team unity," Zutz
said. "We are all very close and get along
very well."
The team continues to look on the bright
side emotionally and physically. Co-captain
senior defenders Lyndsay Erickson and
Tammy Shuer also noted that the Cardinal
have been working hard to stay in shape.
"We have been working really hard in
practice, conditioning and doing drills with a
lot of running," Erickson said. "We look
really good."
In addition, the team has been focusing
on scoring goals (they have been outscored
24-13) and working on basic skills.
"We alwavs focus on playing 'game pace'
or with the speed and intensity that we want
to play within the game," Shuer said.
The squad has several goals this year to
guide their progress through the season, one

Next Scheduled Game:
Pacific
September 25

of which is to qualify for the National
Championship, though they have fallen
short of it the past few seasons.
"We want to beat California and Pacific,
our main rivals," Erickson said. "We also
aim to win our conference, the NorPac con
ference, and go on to the NCAAs."
Though the squad lost to the Golden
Bears 1-0 this past weekend in a frustrating
ly close tilt, there are plenty more games for
the fresh faces to experience a win —
including the next two scheduled games
against Pacific. And despite a losing record,
the rookies have enjoyed the transition
from high school to college.
"The team is great and really welcom
ing," freshman forward/defender Chloe
Bade said. "There are a lot of traditions the
team has, which have been fun and some
times embarrassing to learn. Regardless,
they have helped us all bond."
According to Bade, freshmen have
enjoyed their time with the team both on
and off campus.
"Since we were out there on the 10th of
August, we have spent so much time which
has been really good for the freshmen
because we have had a lot of time to get
adapted to the new campus," Bade said.
"The time away from campus has been good
since it makes me appreciate California
more."
The team has begun the season with high
hopes. With eight starters returning and
eight freshmen, the squad is larger and more
diversely talented this year. Four out of five

top scorers from the 2004 season, including
top scorers Zutz and Robinson, are return
ing to the team. Head coach Lesley Irvine is
returning to the Cardinal squad for her third
season.
The team is looking forward to the fresh
men who have joined this year. According to
Zutz. the challenge from up and coming
freshmen helps motivate upperclassmen to
play harder.
"There are eight freshmen who are all
out there challenging for playing time," Zutz
said. "It's fun and exciting even for the
upperclassmen who are being challenged."

Zutz admits that though the numbers
may not be as good as the team has wanted,
the squad is looking forward to improving.
"While the numbers are a little discour
aging, the important thing is that we are
improving with every- game," Zutz said.
Shuer and Erickson agreed that the team
needs to continue to work hard and make
use of its talent this year.
"We have so much potential and we are
improving every game," Erickson said. "The
tough start to the season, (the losing streak],
has brought our team together and created
a strong desire to play well and win."
