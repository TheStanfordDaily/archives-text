# Eight frosh give field hockey a new look

As the school year begins, the 2005 season
looks promising, or at least better than last sea
son, for the 18 ladies of the Stanford field hockey
team (2-8, 1-1 Northern Pacific Conference).
They constitute a challenging force, in the
NorPac, having already defeated Appalachian
State 2-0 on Sept. 7, but falling 1-0 in a tight
match against cross-bay rival California (4-5,1-0
NorPac).
The Bears outshot the Cardinal 9-3, but the
only score of the match wasn't made until the
65th minute when Cal's Andrea Lo scored off of
a penalty corner. The Cardinal missed opportuni
ties when they failed to score on three penalty
corners in the second half against their NorPac
foe.
However, four more games this season against
NorPac schools have the power to determine
standings for the championship tournament,
which could propel any team into the NCAAs.
Of last year's 11 starters, eight have returned,
including 80 percent of last year's top scorers. A
large class of eight entering students brings fresh
skill to the squad.
Last season, sophomore midfielder/forward
Jess Zutz and junior forward Liz Robinson co-led
the team with 14 points each. Zutz was the
NorPac West Rookie of the Year and a Second
Team All-NorPac selection and has six points so
far this season. Robinson, now with four points,
was selected to the All-Tournament team at the
NorPac Championship.
Senior midfielder Missy Halliday scored 10
points on five goals last season. The team's active
career leader in goals, with 10, she has scored 25
career points and started all 69 games possible.
Defenders Aska Sturdevan, a junior, and
Lyndsay Erickson, a senior, also contribute to the
offense. Last season, Sturdevan had 10 points on
four goals and a pair of assists. Erickson is
Stanford's active leader in both career points and
assists. Junior defender/midfielder Julia Drewes
and junior midfielder Jamie Hais also return.
In goal, sophomore Madison Bell replaces
Ana Kralovec, who will miss her senior year due
to injury. Bell has 35 saves and has maintained a
save percentage of .648 this season.
An experienced defensive crew of Drewes,
Erickson, senior Tammy Shuer and Sturdevan
started all but one possible game last season with
a team goals against average of 2.05. Sturdevan
led with six defensive saves (tied for second in the
NorPac), while Shuer had two. Drewes and
Erickson picked up one each.
A serious, responsible Erickson and a vocal,
hard-working Shuer co-captain the team.
The eight-player freshman class consists of
Chloe Bade, Hillary Braun, Ali Fox, Caroline
Hussey, Simmy Martin, Elizabeth Rabenstine,
Bailey Richardson and Sarah Scheller .
Though a large team of talented players,
Stanford lost a few key players from last season:
First Team All-NorPac choice Eleanor Morgan
and Kralovec, who ranked third among NorPac
goalkeeping leaders in saves.
The ladies faced an arduous set of games
against Miami, Delaware, lowa, Syracuse,
Michigan State, American and Maryland. They
did pick up an impressive shutout win against
Bucknell, schoring six goals. Five of the previous
teams made it to the top 16 in the 2004 NCAA
Division I Championship.
In the match against Bucknell, Richardson
scored the first goal, assisted by Sturdevan and
Erickson. Hussey had an excellent game with
three unassisted goals and one assist. Sturdevan
wrapped up a stellar game with a penalty corner,
assisted by Halliday and Erickson.
The 2005 NorPac Championship is scheduled
at Berkeley Nov. 3 to Nov. 5. For the first time
ever, the winner of this event automatically
advances to the field of 16 for the NCAA
Championship. Stanford, Pacific and Radford
currently lead the conference with one win each.
Stanford was last in the NCAA
Championships in 2000. But with the new post
season format, one may yet see the Cardinal in
the field of 16.
