After a 2004-2005 season packed with
close losses, the Stanford men's tennis
team returns six players from last year
and brings out six new faces. Well, not
completely new.
In addition to four freshmen who plan
to join the sextet of veteran upperclass
men. last year's redshirK have pro
gressed. While senior James Pade and
junior Chris Rasmusscn took last year off.
both look to make an impact once again
when they return and possibly fill the
shoes of two now-departed Stanford
luminaries.
Pie team graduated two seniors in
June — Sam Warburg, the 2005 Pacific-10
Conference singles and doubles champi
on and Phil Sheng. Despite the absence of
two experienced players, the Cardinal
plan to quickly rise to the challenge of fill
ing in the gaps and to have a great
amount of depth throughout their lineup.
"It'll be hard to replace Sam
Warburg." head coach John Whitlinger
said. "But we've got guys who can step
up. It won't be easy because they have
some big shoes to fill, but I believe the
guys are anxious to step up and see what
they can do."
The eager newcomers include incom
ing freshmen Matt Brliich, Ken Kao.
Blake Muller and Jell /cllei.
"We're very excited to have them as a
part of the program." Whitlinger said. "I
think they're going to play a very big role.
They are all hard workers and good play
ers and I think they're going to add a lot
to the team."
Considered one of the top recruits for
his class. Bruich recently competed in the
US Open Juniors and battled in a few
three-set majches before falling in the third
round to the top seed. The freshman won
the first set and was leading at the end of
the second against top-seed Donald
Young;however.a broken string and a cou
ple questionable calls took the match to a

third set, where Bruich ended up cramping.
"I played pretty well and got a little
Unlucky in the second set." Bruich said. "I
had a couple of bad breaks go against me
after winning the first [set]."
Originally from Lake f orest. III., the
freshman also advanced to the third
round of the French Open Juniors where
he fell to the fifth seed, a player from the
Ukraine. Bruich s other notable results
include a seventh place finish at the
under-IS National Championships in
Kalamazoo. Minn., as well as ranking in
the top 75 in the International Tennis
Federation World Junior Tennis
Rankings at the end of August.
"[Bruichj's a smart player who really
hits the ball well." Whitlinger said. "What
he needs the most work on is probably
physical fitness, but he's an excellent play
er and thinks ihrough his matches well.
Me never gives up and I think he's going
to thrive in college tennis."
Bruich is excited about getting started
on his college tennis career and feels that
the biggest difference about college ten
nis will be the team aspect as opposed to
the individual aspect.
"I think [the team atmosphere] is
going to be a positive change" Bruich
said. "All of my life. I've played for myself
— your results are not contingent on
what other people do. But with a team,
there are other guys out there and it's
important for them to win and it's impor
tant for you to win. We've got a good
team and I really like the coaches so I'm
looking forward to it."

Three Stanford players, as well as one
doubles team, checked into the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association's pre
season rankings. Senior KC Corkery. jun
