## Treehouse credit card charges delayed Students puzzled by late bill transactions 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD DESK EDITOR 
For Dee Savery, a $5 charge on his
credit card bill from the Treehouse was
hardly an uncommon occurrence. After
all, Savery, who graduated last spring,
was an avid fan of the Treehouse
nachos. A charge to his account from
the end of July, however, after he had
left campus, came as a surprise.
Savery was not alone in finding
unanticipated credit card charges.
Word spread throughout the Sigma
Nu e-mailing list, with several mem
bers alerting others about suspi
cious charges from the on-campus
eatery.
The charges stemmed from prob
lems with the Treehouse billing sys
tem last May and June, according to
manager Saul Alvarez
"The system was down and we had
to reenter transactions from all of
May and the first weekend of June,"
Alvarez said, dismissing student suspi
cions. "We aren't stealing any money."
Some students weren't so con
vinced.
"Kids thought they were being
charged for purchases they hadn't
made, which might have been the case
anyway judging from their complete
lack of organization over there," said
senior Jake Wachman. "My [credit]
card company resolved the matter
just in case."
One student, who asked not to be
named because the matter is still
being resolved with his bank, said that
he received five charges, all for the
same amount, followed by another for
one cent more. Suspicious, he called
his bank to investigate.
"In the meantime, I'm treating the
Treehouse as cash only," he said.
Other students were concerned
that not all charges from early June
had to be reprocessed and delayed, as
the Treehouse originally claimed. In
fact, sophomore Brent Pirruccello
said his account was correctly charged
on June 7.
"I don't know why they would
have to re-enter only some of the
charges made this week," he said.
"They didn't give any rationale for
it. It doesn't really make any sense
that some charges would slip
through the cracks, but I guess it is
possible."
Alvarez said that the system began
working properly June 7, and that no
problems have been reported since.
"Right now it's fine," he said.
With its reputation in question, the
Treehouse endured some financial
hardship due to the mishap.
"It was really hard for us," Alvarez
said. "We try to collect all we can, but
we did lose some transactions."
Workers at the TYeehouse had to
re-enter more than 6,000 transactions
one-by-one into their system, he
added.
According to Alvarez, the
TVeehouse has been in touch with
local banks such as Wells Fargo, to
explain the situation. Ihe banks, he
said, have largely worked to reassure
customers that the transactions are
nothing to worry about.
To students concerned that eating
at the TYeehouse may put their
finances at risk, Alvarez said he was
apologetic.
"Iliat's not going to happen
again." he said, adding that any stu
dent who wanted proof that their
charge was legitimate could come in
and have their receipts checked with
the TVeehouse records.
