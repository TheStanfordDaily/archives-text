After a return to form last year with its
first NCAA Championship appearance
since 2001, the Cardinal men's golf squad
is looking to continue improving its pro
gram this season.
Head coach Conrad Ray, now entering
his second year, has confidence that the
positive changes that the squad took on
last season will continue to show in
Stanford's 2005-2006 game.
With a focus on the process rather than
the results, Ray wants to tackle the mental
preparation of the golfers and drill the
basics into them, which includes the
Cardinal's short game.
The team has even more talent up its
sleeve than it did last season, as freshmen
Daniel Lim and Dodge Kemmer join the
Cardinal ranks. Lim \Vas the California
Interscholastic Federation state high
school champion last year.
"Daniel Lim is very methodical in his

approach," Ray said. "He has a great short
game, and he's the type of guy that'll very
rarely shoot a high score."
Kemmer. a two-time Kansas Golf
Association amateur champion, brings
characteristic low scores as well as a
strong shot.
The two are different players in Ray's
opinion, but both provide a great advan
tage for the team.
"I'm excited," Ray said. "I think they'll
both play a big role earlv on."
In fact, both already qualified for the
team's first event, the inaugural Tom
Lehman Invitational, in Wayzata, Minn.
Stanford finished eighth in a field of 12 in
the competition.
Sophomore Rob Grube also qualified
for the Minnesota-hosted Invitational.
Grube had a strong performance as a
freshman, and became the NCAA West
Regional champion. He also tied for fifth
individually at the NCAA Championships
in June.

ly hope we have a good showing there."
Mindful of the team's championship
goals, Stanford focused on Minnesota's
Invitational, which proved a good intro
duction to the season. It also provided a
challenge to one of the team's weakness
es: adjusting to wind and elevation. The
weather conditions in Wayzata kept all
but one golfer from an under-par score.
After two rounds on Saturday, the
Cardinal were tied for fifth out of 10
teams. The team had a total score of 604,
19 strokes behind leader and eventual
winner Minnesota. The second day was an
even tougher struggle for Stanford,
despite Grube's 3-over-par performance
— the low score of the day. Grube was the
Cardinal's top individual finisher, taking
10th place overall with a 3 over 219.
Stanford's next challenge features more
familiar weather conditions and an all-too
familiar rival — California. The Golden
Bears host the Mackenzie, beginning Oct.
10.

"My expectations have grown a little bit
this year but they're pretty much the same
as last year," Grube said. "I want to do well
individually because that helps the team. I
think you shoot for the top. and know that
you might not succeed, at least you tried."
The Cardinal also boast two strong vet
erans in seniors Kyle Gentry and Scott
Mac Donald.
"I think that wi\h the addition of our
two freshmen, we're better than we were
last year, which definitely bodes well,"
Grube said. "And there's a really great
chemistry with this team."
Despite the enormous upside to the
Stanford team, nothing is certain in the
competitive Pacific-10 Conference.
"I think I would be disappointed if we
didn't have a good showing in the.tPac-10
conference this year," Grube said. "USC.
UCLA, not to mention Washington, all
have good programs. It's really phenome
nal how stTong our conference is. I think
we have our work cut out for us, but I real-
