# Men's Soccer
## Only a trio remains from College Cup squad 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team
will undoubtedly have many new
faces on the pitch this year, but it
could be the experience from the
more familiar names that can provide
the Cardinal with the edge to win and
mold the squad for years to come.
This year's elder statesmen — sen
iors Bronson McDonald, Cooper
McKee and K.C. Coyne — are the
last players who took part in the
College Cup finals run of 2002 and
the only players with experience in
the postseason. This class intends to
share that knowledge with their
teammates.
"I came in the program when we
were very good," senior fullback
McDonald said. "We went to the
finals freshman year, so I think a per
sonal and team goal would be to leave
the program where 1 found it when 1
came here. 1 want to lead us to a team
that's competitive for the national
title."
McDonald is one of the anchors in
the defense again this year. His solid
play was recognized when he was
named to an All-Tournament team in
Fullerton last year. The wing full
back, who also split time in the mid
field early in his collegiate career,
started every game last season. This
season, the Kingston, Jamaica native
is not only concerned about defend
ing the net but also Maloney Field.

"We need to have a better home
record," McDonald said. "That was
one of the [special] things when I
came in here as a freshman. We rarely
lost here. It was as if our home was
sacred, and the two years after that
we have had our worst record here at
home versus away and neutral sites.
We would like to protect our home
and get a winning record here."
Scheduled to control the midfield
is McKee, a Missouri native. The sen
ior transferred from St. Louis
University to Stanford last year and
has been a key player on both teams.
At St. Louis, McKee started every
game in his freshman campaign and
participated in two Billikens' postsea
sons including a run to the NCAA
quarterfinals in 2003. Relaying his
postseason experience to the rest of
the team has been relatively easy so
far.
"I remember talking to the young
guys and telling them how much fun
it is to get there," McKee said. "All
the hard work they do now is going to
pay off then. [The NCAA
Tournament] is the most fun time
they'll have. I'm trying to show them
what needs to be done to get there.
Hopefully I can use my knowledge of
what we did [at St. Louis] here and
we can get to the same place and then
further."

team All-Pacific-10 Conference
honors. The midfielder, who is
coming off an ankle sprain this
weekend, scored his first goal for
the Cardinal in a 2-2 tie against
Washington and plans to do much
more of that this season.
"I want to improve my offen
sive game," McKee said. "I'd like
to get more assists and more
goals and get involved in the
attack more."
Rounding out the senior class
is striker Coyne, who is currently
injured and has sat out much of
the season. Coyne has played in
37 games as a sub throughout his
career. In his absence, the coach
ing staff has appreciated the
effort of junior defensive mid
fielder Michael Brown.
These upperclassmen have
accepted the growing pains of a
young team, including changing
formations from a 3-5-2 to a 4-4-
2, to most recently a 4-3-3.
"We're just trying to mold,"
McDonald said. "We need to find
the right team to get out on the
field .. . The 4-3-3 formation
suits our team much better. We
have a lot of depth up top at the
forward position. It's just finding
the right formula, and we're defi
nitely on our way to doing that."
Despite the tough task of
teaching while playing, the seniors
have found the year to be enjoy
able so far and think that the
team's potential is extremely high.
"Coming into the year, I was a
little nervous thinking that there
are only three of us, but I think
the team really gelled in presea
son," McKee said. "I feel like
we're kind of all in one-class
together. There's no real hierar
chy or anything like that.
[Because of that] I think the
team's really gelled and we're
ready to make a good run at
everything. We want to win the
Pac-10 and get into the tourna
ment and then hopefully win a
national championship."
If they accomplish any of these
lofty aspirations, the Cardinal's
seniors will have played a huge
role in restoring the program to
the nation's elite.
