# Men's Soccer
## Only a trio remains from College Cup squad 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team
will undoubtedly have many new
faces on the pitch this year, but it
could be the experience from the
more familiar names that can provide
the Cardinal with the edge to win and
mold the squad for years to come.
This year's elder statesmen — sen
iors Bronson McDonald, Cooper
McKee and K.C. Coyne — are the
last players who took part in the
College Cup finals run of 2002 and
the only players with experience in
the postseason. This class intends to
share that knowledge with their
teammates.
"I came in the program when we
were very good," senior fullback
McDonald said. "We went to the
finals freshman year, so I think a per
sonal and team goal would be to leave
the program where 1 found it when 1
came here. 1 want to lead us to a team
that's competitive for the national
title."
McDonald is one of the anchors in
the defense again this year. His solid
play was recognized when he was
named to an All-Tournament team in
Fullerton last year. The wing full
back, who also split time in the mid
field early in his collegiate career,
started every game last season. This
season, the Kingston, Jamaica native
is not only concerned about defend
ing the net but also Maloney Field.

"We need to have a better home
record," McDonald said. "That was
one of the [special] things when I
came in here as a freshman. We rarely
lost here. It was as if our home was
sacred, and the two years after that
we have had our worst record here at
home versus away and neutral sites.
We would like to protect our home
and get a winning record here."
Scheduled to control the midfield
is McKee, a Missouri native. The sen
ior transferred from St. Louis
University to Stanford last year and
has been a key player on both teams.
At St. Louis, McKee started every
game in his freshman campaign and
participated in two Billikens' postsea
sons including a run to the NCAA
quarterfinals in 2003. Relaying his
postseason experience to the rest of
the team has been relatively easy so
far.
"I remember talking to the young
guys and telling them how much fun
it is to get there," McKee said. "All
the hard work they do now is going to
pay off then. [The NCAA
Tournament] is the most fun time
they'll have. I'm trying to show them
what needs to be done to get there.
Hopefully I can use my knowledge of
what we did [at St. Louis] here and
we can get to the same place and then
further."

team last year earned him second
