# Men ousted in pair of Bay Area contests
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
A young and relatively inexperi
enced Stanford men's soccer team (1-
4-1) got a true trial-by-fire test last
Friday when the Cardinal traveled to
meet rival and perennial power No. 7
Santa Gara (4-2-0) at 8 p.m. The
squad fell 2-1 in overtime to the
Broncos before dropping another
game, 1-0, to San Francisco (2-2-1) the
next day.
San Francisco outshot the
Cardinal by 10, and for both teams,
most of the action occurred in the first
half. One highlight for the Cardinal
was freshman goalkeeper Josh Nesbit
playing all 90 minutes. Even with
back-to-back losses, Stanford has
already shown massive improvements
and continues to develop team conti
nuity along with their foot skills
"This team is so young, with only
three returning starters," head coach

Bret Simon said. "But it is also very
talented, athletic and skillful. I see a lot
of progress every day. In one month
we've gone from not knowing each
other's names and really [being] all
over the place... to now coming
together as a group."
The Cardinal, who finished fourth
in the Pacific-10 Conference last sea
son, were once again picked to finish
behind No. 5 UCLA (3-2-0),
Washington (4-0-1) and No. 6
California (5-0-1) in a preseason
coaches poll.
Stanford entered the season with
holes at eight positions vacated by
graduates. Three returning seniors
and a corps of underclassmen -
including Stanford's incoming fresh
man who were ranked 25th in the
country-plan to pick up the slack.
The Cardinal could also get an added
boost from the return of three players
who redshirted due to serious injuries.
Stanford had a strong exhibition

season that included a successful road
trip to the Midwest against Drake (0-
3-1) and No. 15 Creighton (2-0-1).
Freshmen T.J. Novak and Alex
Kozachenko made quick impressions
by scoring a goal a piece to lead a
Stanford 2-1 come-from-behind victo
ry over Drake. In the second game of
the road trip, junior Galen Thompson
fired a bullet from seven yards outside
the penalty area into the twine, silenc
ing a Creighton record crowd on hand
for the Cardinal's 1-0 victory over the
Blue Jays,
"One moment we were looking
kind of out of sorts and the next
moment looking like we could poten
tially take on anyone," Simon said.
"[Since they] tire exhibition games,the
results aren't important. It's a chance
for us to see a lot of players in action
and put them under some hostile situ
ations [We played in front of the]
largest crowd ever fora Drake soccer
game, and then we went to Creighton

and played in front of 5,700 people.
For two exhibition games we got a
real taste of what it's like to be on the
road."
Upon their return, the West Coast
proved less hospitable than the heart
land, as Stanford opened the regular
season with a 0-0 tie against San Jose
State (3-0-2).
"San Jose State has a chance to
make a big jump up this year." Simon
said. "They are going to be particular
ly difficult to play at Spartan Stadium.
The game wasn't very pretty, but it
forced the players to concentrate and
compete for 90 minutes straight."
Stanford, depleted by injuries, then
dropped two close games in a row, 0-1
to UC-Davis (3-2-2) and 0-1 to Cal
State-Northridge (4-1-1), a tourna
ment team from last year. Cardinal
junior keeper Andrew Kartunen, a
member of the Under-20 national
team this summer, missed the games
due to a separated shoulder, and senior
Cooper McKee sat out with a sprained
ankle.
"Our play was not of the consisten
cy I would like, but overall the effort was
good," Simon said. "[We've been)
decent enough to win hut not good
enough that we could guarantee it on an

every time out basis."
Things started to look up for the
Cardinal as they notched their first "W"
of the season 2-0 over Vanderbilt (2-2-0)
last Sunday. Red shirt sophomore
Marcus Ryan factored in both goals,
netting a penalty kick and assisting on
another Thompson goal. Nesbit record
ed five saves, behind a stingy defense to
earn the shutout.
"We expected to have a tough time
in the early stages," McKee said. "But
now I think we're really together look
ing forward to good results against
Santa Clara and going from there."

The Cardinal continued their excep
tionally demanding schedule against
Santa Clara as part of the Bay Area
Classic, which pitted the two Pac-10
schools in the Bay Area against the two
West Coast Conference teams. Santa
Gara had already defeated Pac-10 pow
erhouse UCLA this year, 3-2.
"Before the game [last fall], we were
red-hot," senior fullback Bronson
McDonald said. "We had five wins and
a tie, and [the Broncos] came to
Stanford and beat us 2-0. Looking back,
that was a season changer. It broke our
confidence. We played them in the

spring and I think we played much bet
ter. The score was 0-0, but we had a
bunch of breakaways that we should've
finished. I know our team is ready. This
week we had the best practices we've
had all year. We're ready to make a step
and compete with them."
The Cardinal took an early lead
against the Broncos but Santa Clara
scored in the 87th minute to send the
game into overtime. In overtime, the
ball deflected off a Stanford player for
the win. Playing at home against USF.
the Cardinal couldn't manage to find
the back of the net. About 20 minutes

into the game. USF scored the game
winner. The Dons look to continue a
resurgence to the days of the 1970s -
when they were the elite program in the
nation -by earning a NCAA bid last
year.
On the contrary, the challenges
ahead should bring more clarity to a
tumultuous season for the green
Cardinal.
"The games this [past] weekend
against tough rival teams [told] us a lot
about how far we've come." Simon said.
Not to mention how much more
work there is ahead.
