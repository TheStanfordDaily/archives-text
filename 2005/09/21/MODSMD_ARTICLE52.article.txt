# Men ousted in pair of Bay Area contests

### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
A young and relatively inexperi
enced Stanford men's soccer team (1-
4-1) got a true trial-by-fire test last
Friday when the Cardinal traveled to
meet rival and perennial power No. 7
Santa Gara (4-2-0) at 8 p.m. The
squad fell 2-1 in overtime to the
Broncos before dropping another
game, 1-0, to San Francisco (2-2-1) the
next day.
San Francisco outshot the
Cardinal by 10, and for both teams,
most of the action occurred in the first
half. One highlight for the Cardinal
was freshman goalkeeper Josh Nesbit
playing all 90 minutes. Even with
back-to-back losses, Stanford has
already shown massive improvements
and continues to develop team conti
nuity along with their foot skills
"This team is so young, with only
three returning starters," head coach

Bret Simon said. "But it is also very
talented, athletic and skillful. I see a lot
of progress every day. In one month
we've gone from not knowing each
other's names and really [being] all
over the place... to now coming
together as a group."
The Cardinal, who finished fourth
in the Pacific-10 Conference last sea
son, were once again picked to finish
behind No. 5 UCLA (3-2-0),
Washington (4-0-1) and No. 6
California (5-0-1) in a preseason
coaches poll.
Stanford entered the season with
holes at eight positions vacated by
graduates. Three returning seniors
and a corps of underclassmen -
including Stanford's incoming fresh
man who were ranked 25th in the
country-plan to pick up the slack.
The Cardinal could also get an added
boost from the return of three players
who redshirted due to serious injuries.
Stanford had a strong exhibition

season that included a successful road
trip to the Midwest against Drake (0-
3-1) and No. 15 Creighton (2-0-1).
Freshmen T.J. Novak and Alex
Kozachenko made quick impressions
by scoring a goal a piece to lead a
Stanford 2-1 come-from-behind victo
ry over Drake. In the second game of
the road trip, junior Galen Thompson
fired a bullet from seven yards outside
the penalty area into the twine, silenc
ing a Creighton record crowd on hand
for the Cardinal's 1-0 victory over the
Blue Jays,
"One moment we were looking
kind of out of sorts and the next
moment looking like we could poten
tially take on anyone," Simon said.
"[Since they] tire exhibition games,the
results aren't important. It's a chance
for us to see a lot of players in action
and put them under some hostile situ
ations [We played in front of the]
largest crowd ever fora Drake soccer
game, and then we went to Creighton

and played in front of 5,700 people.
For two exhibition games we got a
real taste of what it's like to be on the
road."
Upon their return, the West Coast
proved less hospitable than the heart
land, as Stanford opened the regular
season with a 0-0 tie against San Jose
State (3-0-2).
"San Jose State has a chance to
make a big jump up this year." Simon
said. "They are going to be particular
ly difficult to play at Spartan Stadium.
The game wasn't very pretty, but it
forced the players to concentrate and
compete for 90 minutes straight."
Stanford, depleted by injuries, then
dropped two close games in a row, 0-1
to UC-Davis (3-2-2) and 0-1 to Cal
State-Northridge (4-1-1), a tourna
ment team from last year. Cardinal
