After the Cardinal's first cross country
meet of the 2005 season, no one doubted
Stanfordis potential to maintain its power
house reputation. At the University of San
Francisco Invitational on Sept. 3, the
women took first place as a team, along
with first and second individual honors.
The men were equally impressive, placing
seven runners among the top 11 finishers.
The USF Invitational included teams
from up and down the West Coast, along
with Arizona and Nevada. Stanford and
Arizona were the only two teams repre
senting the Pacific-10 Conference.
"We didn't run our best team at USF,"
cross country director Edrick Floreal said.
"We just ran the guys that were healthy
and ready to go."
Junior sensation Arianna Lambie took
first place as an individual, finishing the
5,000-meter race in a time of 18:18.3 sec
onds.
Senior Julie Allen was a close second,
with a time of 18:20.7. Sophomores
Lindsay Flacks and Katie Harrington
placed fourth and fifth, respectively.
Meanwhile, the men worked off of each
other from the outset, running as a pack
throughout the 8,000-meter race.
"That was coach [Peter] Tegen's plan; to
have the men running as a group, a single
unit," Floreal said.
Tegen came on board this year after
both women's coach Dena Evans and

men's coach Andrew Gerard resigned this
summer. Tegen is one of the premier dis
tance coaches in the U.S.
"It is going to be a great season,"
Floreal said. "Coach Tegen is a guru of dis
tance running. He'll make a huge positive

impact on the whole team and not only the
distance runners but the entire cross coun
try and track and field program."
The Cardinal strategy would have won a
first-place team title if not for the stacked
Arizona team, whose top four runners

took the first through fourth individual
honors.
The seven Cardinal men who took the
fifth through 11th spots all finished within
two seconds of each other. Sophomore
Hari Mix was the first of the Cardinal to
finish, coming in fifth with a time of
25:34.7.
Mix came to Stanford last year as the
2003 Virginia Cross Country Runner of the
Year and made an immediate impact on
the Cardinal.
Following Mix was senior David Vidal in
a time of 25:34.9. Sophomore Garrett Heath
and junior Jonathan Pierce were the seventh
and eighth place finishers for the Cardinal.
Junior Obed Mutanya of Arizona won
the race in 24:40.7. Mutanya, the junior col
lege national champion last year at Central
Arizona College, hails from Zambia.
Second at USF was the Wildcat's
Mohamed Trafeh, the 2004 Pac-10
Newcomer of the Year and Freshman of
the Year. Me finished in 24:48.0.
On Sept. 24 Stanford is scheduled to
host the 32nd annual Stanford Invitational
on the Stanford Golf Course. There will be
a maximum of 200 runners in the six differ
ent long distance collegiate events, ranging
from 4,000-meters to 8,000.
The Stanford Invite has the distinction
of being the largest cross country meet in
North America, with over 3,000 collegiate
and high school runners participating.
"It is going to be a good meet," Floreal
said. "A great high school meet and really
great college meet."
