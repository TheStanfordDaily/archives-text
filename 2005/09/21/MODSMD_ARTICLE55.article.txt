# Dorm Crazy
## An in-depth look at each type of frosh residence 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
One aspect of this Orientation Week will profoundly affect the incoming fresh
men for the next four years and beyond, and no, it's not any of the countless talks or
plays about life at Stanford. Far more important are the memories you freshmen will
accumulate over the course of this year and the friends you'll make in the dorms.
Thus, from Serra to Schiff, from Branner to Burbank, from Arroyo to Zapata, The
Daily proudly presents a rundown of freshman housing.

Branner Hall

It's no surprise which dorm comes first. Love it
or hate it, Branner is the crown jewel of the fresh
man housing system. It has its own dining hall and
most residents live in two-room triples. With these
features comes a reputation for craziness that res
idents say isn't entirely accurate — yet isn't whol

ly inaccurate either.
"Branner is like a hotel without hotel security,"
said sophomore Alif Khalfan. "On the other hand,
anywhere that has many kids running around is
going to be fun, and all sorts of people have a
great time in Branner, both quieter and crazier."

Roble Hall

As a freshman, current sophomore Mike
Woodward lived in Roble, which houses students
in every class yet still manages to hold more fresh
man than any dorm outside of Branner.
"Being in Roble was great because there were
enough freshmen to live the freshman experience,
but there were also upperclassmen who could
help the freshmen adjust to being students at

Stanford University by doing everything from
helping us pick classes to driving us to pick up
necessities from the store," Woodward said.
In addition to the connection with upperclass
men, students reported they enjoy Roble for its
ample common space, spring barbeques and long
standing tradition of nightly Poker Nights. But they
warn that the C-wing can become socially isolated.

FroSoCo

Other than the SLE, four-class and all-fresh
men dorms, Stanford offers two other special
types of housing. Freshmen and sophomores in
FroSoCo live in either Schiff or Adams in
Governor's Corner during their freshman year
and have the option of returning in years there
after. While students report that FroSoCo's rep
utation as a quieter dorm is accurate, they also
find plenty they enjoy about their lodging.

"FroSoCo is a bit isolated from the rest
of the frosh dorms and thus caters to a
slightly quieter crowd, but the existence of
several 'four-year FroSoCoans' indicates
that this environment is perfect for some,"
said sophomore Sean Arenson. "John
Bravman certainly earns his reputation as
the bad-ass dean, and can you say two room
doubles?"

SLE Dorms

Bradley Heinz, also a sophomore, lived in FloMo's Cardenal as a
freshman, a dorm that hosts freshmen enrolled in the Structured
Liberal Education, or SLE Program. He describes the dorm as intel
lectually vibrant and an exciting place to live.
Alondra and Faisan also house SLE students.

All-Frosh Houses

Stern, Wilbur and Florence Moore Halls

Outside of Branner, the highest concentration of
freshmen lies in Stern, Wilbur and Florence Moore
Halls, which host freshmen in a combined 22 dorms,
mainly in one-room doubles. Nine of these dorms —
Alondra, Gavilan and Paloma in FloMo; Donner
and Larkin in Stern, and Cedro, Junipero, Otero and
Rinconada in Wilbur — exclusively house freshmen.
Each of the halls has its own dining facility, though
FloMo Dining closes on Fridays and Saturdays. Of
the three, most students seem to prefer Wilbur
Dining, though Late Night at Stern is quite popular.
Each of these 22 dorms has a unique feel, and
residents of every house said they take pride in
what makes their dorm stand out.
"I lived in Rinconada last year, and it was amaz
ing," said sophomore and former Rinconada social
chair Annie Kadavy. "We had a dorm ski trip,
Secret Snowflake [a week of outrageous dares and
spectacles at the end of fall quarter], Valentine's
Day rollout by the boys [all the guys wake up all

the girls in the dorm in the wee hours of the morn
ing to give them roses], and midnight finals breaks."
Sophomore Kara Johnson described Paloma as
a very lively place where people were constantly
finding new ways to have fun.
"We also were really into our chat list — it sur
vived the entire summer, and never lost its random
ness," she added.
Some also attest to the friendliness of their resi
dent fellows, or RFs. "Gavin and Judy, the Junipero
RFs, are great and seem to get excellent residential
assistants, or R As, who also make the dorm great,"
said sophomore Sam Lipsick. "J-ro is known for
being a fun dorm every year, and the reputation is
true."
And not only did Otero house Chelsea Ginton,
but its "manwich" — a second floor of men sur
rounded by two floors of women — caused last
year's freshman guys to form an incredibly strong
bond, according to sophomore Mallory Bounds.

Four-Class Dorms

Outside of Branner, the highest concentration of
freshmen lies in Stern, Wilbur and Florence Moore
Halls, which host freshmen in a combined 22 dorms,
mainly in one-room doubles Nine of these dorms —
Alondra, Gavilan and Paloma in FloMo; Donner
and Larkin in Stern, and Cedro, Junipero, Otero and
Rinconada in Wilbur — exclusively house freshmen.
Each of the halls has its own dining facility, though
FloMo Dining closes on Fridays and Saturdays. Of
the three, most students seem to prefer Wilbur
Dining, though Late Night at Stern is quite popular.
Each of these 22 dorms has a unique feel, and
residents of every house said they take pride in
what makes their dorm stand out.
"I lived in PJnconada last year, and it was amaz
ing," said sophomore and former Rinconada social
chair Annie Kadavy. "We had a dorm ski trip,
Secret Snowflake [a week of outrageous dares and
spectacles at the end of fall quarter], Valentine's
Day rollout by the boys [all the guys wake up all

the girls in the dorm in the wee hours of the morn
ing to give them roses], and midnight finals breaks."

RFs, are great and seem to get excellent residential
assistants, or RAs, who also make the dorm great,"
said sophomore Sam Lipsick. "J-ro is known for
being a fun dorm every year, and the reputation is
true."
And not only did Otero house Chelsea Clinton,
but its "manwich" — a second floor of men sur
rounded by two floors of women — caused last
year's freshman guys to form an incredibly strong
bond, according to sophomore Mallory Bounds.

Ethnic Theme Dorms

Finally, the ethnic-themed dorms, Casa
Zapata, Muwekma-Ta-Ruk, Okada and IJjamaa,
attempt to create a strong cultural community,
though they are open to students of all hack
grounds. Students in these dorms said that they
enjoy the relationships they form with their
respective communities.
"I was plunged into the heart of the welcoming,
vibrant and close-knit Chicano-Latino community

in Casa Zapata," said junior Amanda Johnson.
"Stanford students who call Zapata home shaped
a freshman year I will never forget and introduced
me to some of the issues and people who have
helped me make the most out of my time here."
Residents also appreciate Casa Zapata's
murals, chants and links to Latin American histo
ry and culture, added sophomores Takeo Rivera
and Juan Mateos.
