# Advice to keep you happy (and alive) freshman year
## 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Are you new to the Farm and
feeling a bit like the black sheep in
the herd? Are you overwhelmed by
your demotion from high school
senior to naive college freshman?
While you won't be able to develop
that experienced-Stanford-student
gait right away, here are seven help
ful tidbits to get you started.
• So you don't have a car, don't
have any money but you just HAVE
to see that old Clark Gable movie
(that one with Scarlett O'Hara in
it). Where do you go? The basement
of Green Library, of course! The
Media and Microtext section of
Green houses just about every
major DVD and VHS ever released.
: From the second season of "The
Simpsons" to the sequel to "The
Godfather," Green library has it all.
To avoid the chance that your
movie might be checked-out
already, go early in the day and look
the film up on the Web site
socrates.stanford.edu so that you
know it's available before you take
the trip to the library.
• Freshmen aren't allowed to
have cars on campus. If you find
yourself without wheels but still
longing to make that trip to Santa
then look up Enterprise Rent-
A-Car. While most car dealerships
only rent cars to those over 25 years
old, Enterprise rents to Stanford stu
dents over 18. Eighteen through 20
year olds may rent an Economy-size

car for $7 an hour or $40 a day.
Sophomore Nada Boutros used
Enterprise Rent-A Car to facilitate
her freshman-year trip to Los
Angeles.
"My roommate and I were sick
and tired of the campus and wanted
to get out," she said. "When we
found out about the car rental place
that actually rents cars to 18 and
over, we just roadtripped down to
L.A."
All you need is a Stanford ID
card, proof of full coverage car
insurance, a major credit or debit
card and an open road!
• On a sunny Stanford day, many
students find it more appealing to
work on their tans than their
schoolwork and are therefore up
late into the night studying. Late
Night eateries, which provide the
quintessential study break, are
available in Stern Dining as well as
Lakeside (Lagunita and Roble din
ing). Stern Cyber-cafe is open on
week-days until 1 a.m. and Late
Night at Lakeside is open until 2
a.m.
But don't just take my word for
it, the testimonials, like that from
sophomore Gabe Winant, say it all.
"Late Night is a must for the
hours kept by many Stanford stu
dents," said Winant of his nightly pil
grimages to the beloved eatery. "It is
fuel for the trek through the long,
dark night. It's practically a religious
obligation. Every night, we go wor
ship at the temple of Stern dining.
Give us today our daily bread; give

us tonight our nightly chicken ten
ders."
While the food at Late Night din
ing facilities may expedite the
treacherous freshman 15 the greasy
cheese sticks and oh-so-creamy
milkshakes are well worth the
weight.
• It's been likened to a hot dog, a
limousine and even a giant phallus,
but is most commonly known as
"Couchy." This oversize couch in
Durand, an upper Row house,
offers residents a place to study,
sleep and watch some quality televi
sion. If you're willing to make the
hike up Mayfield Avenue (and
make a friend in Durand) then a
visit to Couchy might just provide
you with the most comfortable spot
on campus.
• Hazardous situations are
scarce on our sunny, grassy, heavily
policed campus but there are still
places to look out for. For example,
many students feel as if their lives
are in danger every time they ride
through the five-way intersection
next to the clock tower, otherwise
known as "The Intersection of
Death."
Sophomore Lesley Silverthorn
thought twice before taking the
most convenient route on the way to
IHUM section last year.
"I avoid the intersection of death
at all hours of the day except for
early morning and night," she said.
So beware, because if you ride
through this perilously convenient
intersection right before the hour

strikes (and students are in a rush to
get to class), I can almost guarantee
you that you will get into a near, if
not bone crushing, accident.
• Is your room-mate snoring dur
ing naptime? The kid upstairs mak
ing a little too much use of his new
suhwoofers? The Bender Room at
Green Library is an excellent place
to study. This Hogwarts-like room
complete with overstuffed chairs,
high ceilings and plentiful windows
is so quiet that you may feel nervous
rustling the papers in your binder.
It's on the fifth floor of Green
Library and only accessible through
one elevator in the Bing Wing.
"It's one of my, and most every
one's, favorite places to study," said
Colin Murphy, who graduated last
spring. "Super comfy, warm room
for great reading and falling asleep
while reading."
• While caffeine is a staple of col
lege life, really good coffee is hard to
find around campus. For those cof
fee-addicts among us who are unim
pressed with the CoHo and would
rather not support monster coffee
chains that start with S, Moonbeans
is a cute and convenient place to
pick up that frothy double-nonfat
latte.
Located between Meyer and
Green libraries, it is on the way to
almost every class for residents of
East Campus. Even those who live
farther away appreciate Moonbeans'
relaxed, outside atmosphere, deli
cious and unique pastries and. most
importantly, electrifying espresso.

While the food at Late Night din
ing facilities may expedite the
treacherous freshman 15 the greasy
cheese sticks and oh-so-creamy
milkshakes are well worth the
weight.
• It's been likened to a hot dog, a
limousine and even a giant phallus,
but is most commonly known as
"Couchy." This oversize couch in
Durand, an upper Row house,
offers residents a place to study,
sleep and watch some quality televi
sion. If you're willing to make the
hike up Mayfield Avenue (and
make a friend in Durand) then a
visit to Couchy might just provide
you with the most comfortable spot
on campus.
• Hazardous situations are
scarce on our sunny, grassy, heavily
policed campus but there are still
places to look out for. For example,
many students feel as if their lives
are in danger every time they ride
through the five-way intersection
next to the clock tower, otherwise
known as "The Intersection of
Death."
Sophomore Lesley Silverthorn
thought twice before taking the
most convenient route on the way to
IHUM section last year.
"I avoid the intersection of death
at all hours of the day except for
early morning and night," she said.
So beware, because if you ride
through this perilously convenient
intersection right before the hour

strikes (and students are in a rush to
get to class), I can almost guarantee
you that you will get into a near, if
not bone crushing, accident.
• Is your room-mate snoring dur
ing naptime? The kid upstairs mak
ing a little too much use of his new
suhwoofers? The Bender Room at
Green Library is an excellent place
to study. This Hogwarts-like room
complete with overstuffed chairs,
high ceilings and plentiful windows
is so quiet that you may feel nervous
rustling the papers in your binder.
It's on the fifth floor of Green
Library and only accessible through
one elevator in the Bing Wing.
"It's one of my, and most every
one's, favorite places to study," said
Colin Murphy, who graduated last
spring. "Super comfy, warm room
for great reading and falling asleep
while reading."
• While caffeine is a staple of col
lege life, really good coffee is hard to
find around campus. For those cof
fee-addicts among us who are unim
pressed with the CoHo and would
rather not support monster coffee
chains that start with S, Moonbeans
is a cute and convenient place to
pick up that frothy double-nonfat
latte.
Located between Meyer and
Green libraries, it is on the way to
almost every class for residents of
East Campus. Even those who live
farther away appreciate Moonbeans'
relaxed, outside atmosphere, deli
cious and unique pastries and. most
importantly, electrifying espresso.
