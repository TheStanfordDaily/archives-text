# Exploring will do you good
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER DESK EDITOR 
Whether you're already sick of Wilbur dining, looking to escape
the Flicks masses or just trying to capture an elusive state of
nonconformity, Stanford's campus offers a variety of activi
ties that can give you a much-needed dose of individuality.
Hey, if Stanford's admissions committee could find something special about yet another Jack
Kerouac admirer; then you owe it to yourself to do something that doesn't have a Facebook
interest group devoted to it. So what are you waiting for? Jump off the bandwagon and onto
your high horse faster than you can say "Ohhhh-nine/"

Take in the View

j Where: llie Dish A habitat conservation center
<find home to one of the largest satellite dishes in the
Jiay Area, the Dish is perfect for recreation and
It's also a mere stone's throw away from
•Stanford's own astronomical observatory, located just
north of the Dish on Campus Drive. Enter the Dish at
the intersection of Campus Drive West and Junipero
Serra.near Enchanted Broccoli forest, or at the inter
section of Junipero Serra and Stanford Avenue.
What to Do 'ITiere: Walk the Dish's hilly 3.3-mile
loop and take in scenic views of the foothills, the Bay,
San Francisco — and cows. At night, go up to the
Dish's observatory and get a closer look at the
moon's craters and mountains and sometimes even
the rings of Saturn or cloud-bands of Jupiter.
When to Go: The Dish is open from around sun
rise to sunset, which varies by month. Fora clear view

of San Francisco, it's best to make the trip a day or
two alter a rainstorm. Itie observatory is open to the
public for free Friday nights from 9 to 11 p.m.
Why it's Cool: Walking the Dish "is a really whole
some, California way to not do your work after
brunch on Sunday morning," said sophomore Ruth
Levine. Plus, what's a better way to escape the Friday
frat party scene than to remember how insignificant
your life is to the greater cosmic universe?
Why it's Obscure: There tend to be more fit Palo
Alto moms than Stanford students on the Dish loop,
and you can probably count the number of students
who've even heard of the observatory — let alone
been there on two hands.
For More Info: Check out the observatory's Web
site at: http://astro.stanford.edu/StudObs/desc.html
or the Dish's hours at http://dish.stanford.edu

Cardinal Dollars.
When to Go: Monday through Friday. Hot Meal

a reasonable price." said sophomore Koji Gardiner.
"You can pet a top-class meal there for the same price
you'd pay at Wilbur dining."
Why it's Obscure: Located at 318 Campus Dr.
West across the street from the Gates Computer
Science Building and the Mudd Chemistry Building,
the Clark Center is a bit of a hike from theQuad.

The Cantor Arts Center not only boasts unique exhibits, but also offers night-time viewings
with free food for Stanford students. Perfect fora date!
Whether you're already sick of Wilbur dining, looking to escape
the Flicks masses or just trying to capture an elusive state of
nonconformity, Stanford's campus offers a variety of activi
ties that can give you a much-needed dose of individuality.
Hey, if Stanford's admissions committee could find something special about yet another Jack
Kerouac admirer; then you owe it to yourself to do something that doesn't have a Facebook
interest group devoted to it. So what are you waiting for? Jump off the bandwagon and onto
your high horse faster than you can say "Ohhhh-nine/"

Take in the View

j Where: llie Dish A habitat conservation center
<find home to one of the largest satellite dishes in the
Jiay Area, the Dish is perfect for recreation and
It's also a mere stone's throw away from
•Stanford's own astronomical observatory, located just
north of the Dish on Campus Drive. Enter the Dish at
the intersection of Campus Drive West and Junipero
Serra.near Enchanted Broccoli forest, or at the inter
section of Junipero Serra and Stanford Avenue.
What to Do 'ITiere: Walk the Dish's hilly 3.3-mile
loop and take in scenic views of the foothills, the Bay,
San Francisco — and cows. At night, go up to the
Dish's observatory and get a closer look at the
moon's craters and mountains and sometimes even
the rings of Saturn or cloud-bands of Jupiter.
When to Go: The Dish is open from around sun
rise to sunset, which varies by month. Fora clear view

of San Francisco, it's best to make the trip a day or
two alter a rainstorm. Itie observatory is open to the
public for free Friday nights from 9 to 11 p.m.
Why it's Cool: Walking the Dish "is a really whole
some, California way to not do your work after
brunch on Sunday morning," said sophomore Ruth
Levine. Plus, what's a better way to escape the Friday
frat party scene than to remember how insignificant
your life is to the greater cosmic universe?
Why it's Obscure: There tend to be more fit Palo
Alto moms than Stanford students on the Dish loop,
and you can probably count the number of students
who've even heard of the observatory — let alone
been there on two hands.
For More Info: Check out the observatory's Web
site at: http://astro.stanford.edu/StudObs/desc.html
