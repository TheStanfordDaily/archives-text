# How to stay safe... and sane
## 
### NATALIE RAMOS HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Fresh(wo)men, welcome to the
Farm! At Stanford, you'll learn to
deal with a myriad of health crises
ranging from bicycle accidents to
food poisoning during finals to
breakup woes. Below you will find a
list of useful campus health
resources to help you cope and stay
healthy:
Vaden:lhe official student health
center offers a plethora of health
resources — everything from immu
nizations to primary care check-ups
to confidential HIV testing. Vaden is
also your one-stop shop for birth
control, emergency contraception,
STD diagnosis and pregnancy test
ing. Sexual health services are fre
quently available same-day. More
details concerning individual servic
es can be found online at
http://vaden.stanford.edu.
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS): Located within
Vaden, CAPS offers free counseling
services to all registered Stanford
students. CAPS counselors can
assess your psychological needs and
recommend therapy accordingly.
Services are not typically available
same-day, so try to plan your panic
attack or breakup at least a few days
(or weeks) in advance.
Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SIIPRC):That Stanford ID
card of yours is good fora whopping
12 free condoms each quarter at the
SHPRC.'Ihe math gets a little tricky,
but you can also substitute three
condoms for one lube tube, female
condom or dental dam. Visit the
SIIPRC on the second floor of
Vaden without an appointment or
call 723-3730 (which spells SAFE
SF.X — so very clever). The SHPRC
is also a frequent destination for
freshman dorm fieldtrips and makes
fora great first date. And if you're
ever feeling itchy down there, you
can check out the famous online
STD diagnosis at http://shprc.stan
ford.edu.
5-SURE: So you're drunk at
Mirrielees at 2 a.m. and you live in
FroSoCo. Don't be an ass and try to
drive or bike home — yes, we have
BUIs here and they're taken seri
ously by both the police and the
University. Instead, call 5-SURE

from any campus phone or 650-725-
SURE from a cell phone. Riding on
a 5-SURE golf cart is really fun
when you're plastered, but you do
not have to be drunk to ride with 5-
SURE. You can use 5-SURE, for
instance, if you don't feel comfort
able walking somewhere alone in
the middle of the night or if you're
really lazy — but they'll probably
remember you if you do it twice.
The Bridge: Feeling down and
out? Dial 723-3392 (3-3392 on cam
pus) to reach The Bridge, Stanford's
Peer Counseling Center, where free
counseling is provided 24 hours a
day. You can also visit the Rogers
House (by the Bike Shop) on
Salvatierra Walk to be counseled in
person. Chances are the counselor is
more depressed than you are, so you
may actually leave feeling better
about yourself.
RAs & PHEs: Granted, some
RAs have deep-rooted personal

issues that led them to be a role
model fora huge group of freshmen
(I was never an RA, by the way).
Still, they can offer a warm hug and
a cute smile when you are feeling
blue, or a bottle of water when
you're sloshed. And they have
promised the University that they
won't sleep with you, so it's fairly
safe to go to your RAin a moment
of crisis or vulnerability. PHEs are
similar to RAs but are generally less
creepy and loaded with fancy health
supplies like aspirin and condoms.

Natalie is a senior majoring in
Spanish and leaving the Farm
for greener med school pastures
next year. Or she may move to
Los Angeles to become a rock
star/waitress. To tell her what a
horrible physician she'll make
or to seek her unprofessional
opinion, e-mail her at
n ram os @stan fo rd. edu.
