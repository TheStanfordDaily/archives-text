Today, some 1,600 incoming fresh
men will fervently stumble their
way through campus on their sec
ond official day as Stanford students.
Below, upperclassmen reflect on their
favorite memories from freshman year
and wish their newest Farm-mates simi
lar happy trails.
Many members of the classes of 2008
and 2009 shared expectations fora year
of peerless academic learning, with long
nights invested at Green Library in the
exalted pursuit of knowledge and
growth; others foresaw a year of thirsty,
unfettered merry-making surrounded
by innumerable new friends. Some saw
themselves committing inexhaustible
time and energy to activities and public
service; others planned to await self-dis
covery in a haze of smoke.
The Stanford freshman experience is a
unique combination for each individual,
but few to none know exactly what lies at
their feet as they begin to tread through
their first eight months on the Farm.
Whether these stories calm frayed

nerves or fuel eager anticipation, they
offer important insights, told by those
who have been through it all.
For junior Adam Maenhout, foun
tain hopping was a particularly fantastic
frosh activity — he actually jumped
when he suddenly remembered his first
experience splish-splashing in the pools
in front of MemAud and the Bookstore.
"We did that the first week — it was
awesome," he said, recounting his vivid
memories of the 2003 Roble residents,
then near-strangers, running to all the
fountains on campus shouting their
dorm's cheer. "I think that was the first
time we did something together as a
hall, and at that point we didn't know
each other's names.
"No one had any clue what fountain
hopping was, or why we were doing it,
but it was pretty sweet," Maenhout
added.
Now he regards jumping through a
fountain late at night as perfectly stan
dard Stanford behavior — just another
fun freshman event that helps new stu
dents settle in and upperclassmen blow
off steam.
"I remember it because it's one of
those Stanford traditions," he said. "We
came back soaking wet and tired but we
knew each other's names!"
For others, dorm trips proved to be
their favorite memories as novices on
the Farm. With all the dorm cheers,
dorm themes and scheduled dorm
bonding that take place during New
Student Orientation, you might be feel
ing the need for some time apart from
the whole entity that is your dorm, and
you may not believe that a weekend get
away with all of Branner or Roble could
be fun. Think again. Especially for the
frosh that are new to the area and for all
those without cars, dorm trips are per
fect ways to get off campus and experi
ence California.
The first trip upon which most dorms
embark is the scavenger hunt in San
Francisco. Staffers divide you into
groups, give you disposable cameras and
put you onto a bus or train to the city.
Groups are given until about 5 p.m.
to do "all these crazy things as a team
while barely knowing each other" said
sophomore Silvia Sanchez.
From mooning Larkin Street and
getting a piercing to performing in the
streets, the group that accomplishes the
most tasks on the list — with pictures as
proof — wins some kind of prize.
The scavenger hunt hurdles you into
your new Bay area environment, help
ing you to get a quick look at much of
San Francisco in a short amount of time,
as well as provides ample opportunity
for bonding.
"The San Francisco scavenger hunt
was at that kind of awkward time where
we were all trying to make good impres
sions on one another, so it was such a

relief to be able to run around and look
stupid fora legitimate reason, said soph
omore Kat Lewin. "Plus, although the
people in my group didn't immediately
become long-term friends, every time
we saw each other around we had to
share a secret smile because, hey, we saw
each other run around Lombard Street
naked. That's a bond no one can take
away from you."
Sophomore Christina Mendez has
only fond memories from her freshman
year Scavenger Hunt in San Francisco.
"My favorite parts were when we
convinced some people at the Sir
Francis Drake Hotel to let us take a pic
ture on their bed," she recalled.
"Getting kicked out of the Nike store
was fun too and watching my team
mates David and Nick smear chocolate
all over their faces at the Ghiridhelli
factory was so funny."
If the scavenger hunt sounds like a
day of terrorizing San Francisco with
immensely entertaining, and admittedly
obnoxious, antics — well, it is.
"You have to just lose all shyness in
order to complete the tasks, so you get
to see different sides of people that
rarely come out," Mendez explained.
But it's no lie that the most trying times
bring out the best in people.
Another favorite dorm trip is the ski
trip to Lake Tahoe and the surrounding
areas, which gives frosh the chance to
travel hours from campus and spend a
weekend in the snow.
"I loved ski trip!" Sanchez said. "It
was a huge bonding experience, as well
as a learning experience for those of us
who learned how to ski or snowboard."
And if you don't want to ski or snow
board, you can have a memorable week
end without skiing or snow boarding.
Lots of people hang out and party at the
houses the dorms rent out, as well as go
sledding and ice skating.
Other crazy journeys to look forward
to, depending on your dorm's prefer
ences, are camping trips to Yosemite
National Park, attending professional
sports games and seeing the taping of
"The Price is Right," a game show, in
Los Angeles.
While many Stanford students seem
to love these trips, some said that the
daily hustle and bustle in the dorms
comprises some of the best boiling
with friends on the Farm.
"My favorite dorm activity was just
that: dorm activity, otherwise known as
playing, and avoiding injury from new
games such as 'death frisby,' random
dance parties in tiny rooms and finding
creative ways to procrastinate together
as a family," said sophomore Alana Dong.
Sophomore Terry Hou added, "the
Stanford freshman experience can't be
summed up in a few keystone events.
It's something that is inextricably
yours."

sledding and ice skating.
Other crazy journeys to look forward
to, depending on your dorm's prefer
ences, are camping trips to Yosemite
National Park, attending professional
sports games and seeing the taping of
"The Price is Right," a game show, in
Los Angeles.
While many Stanford students seem
to love these trips, some said that the
daily hustle and bustle in the dorms
comprises some of the best boiling
with friends on the Farm.
"My favorite dorm activity was just
that: dorm activity, otherwise known as
playing, and avoiding injury from new
games such as 'death frisby,' random
dance parties in tiny rooms and finding
creative ways to procrastinate together
as a family," said sophomore Alana Dong.
Sophomore Terry Hou added, "the
Stanford freshman experience can't be
summed up in a few keystone events.
It's something that is inextricably
yours."

Today, some 1,600 incoming fresh
men will fervently stumble their
way through campus on their sec
ond official day as Stanford students.
Below, upperclassmen reflect on their
favorite memories from freshman year
and wish their newest Farm-mates simi
lar happy trails.
Many members of the classes of 2008
and 2009 shared expectations fora year
of peerless academic learning, with long
nights invested at Green Library in the
exalted pursuit of knowledge and
growth; others foresaw a year of thirsty,
unfettered merry-making surrounded
by innumerable new friends. Some saw
themselves committing inexhaustible
time and energy to activities and public
service; others planned to await self-dis
covery in a haze of smoke.
The Stanford freshman experience is a
unique combination for each individual,
but few to none know exactly what lies at
their feet as they begin to tread through
their first eight months on the Farm.
Whether these stories calm frayed

nerves or fuel eager anticipation, they
offer important insights, told by those
who have been through it all.
For junior Adam Maenhout, foun
tain hopping was a particularly fantastic
frosh activity — he actually jumped
when he suddenly remembered his first
experience splish-splashing in the pools
in front of MemAud and the Bookstore.
"We did that the first week — it was
awesome," he said, recounting his vivid
memories of the 2003 Roble residents,
then near-strangers, running to all the
fountains on campus shouting their
dorm's cheer. "I think that was the first
time we did something together as a
hall, and at that point we didn't know
each other's names.
"No one had any clue what fountain
hopping was, or why we were doing it,
but it was pretty sweet," Maenhout
added.
Now he regards jumping through a
fountain late at night as perfectly stan
dard Stanford behavior — just another
fun freshman event that helps new stu
dents settle in and upperclassmen blow
off steam.
"I remember it because it's one of
those Stanford traditions," he said. "We
came back soaking wet and tired but we
knew each other's names!"
For others, dorm trips proved to be
their favorite memories as novices on
the Farm. With all the dorm cheers,
dorm themes and scheduled dorm
bonding that take place during New
Student Orientation, you might be feel
ing the need for some time apart from
the whole entity that is your dorm, and
you may not believe that a weekend get
away with all of Branner or Roble could
be fun. Think again. Especially for the
frosh that are new to the area and for all
those without cars, dorm trips are per
fect ways to get off campus and experi
ence California.
The first trip upon which most dorms
embark is the scavenger hunt in San
Francisco. Staffers divide you into
groups, give you disposable cameras and
put you onto a bus or train to the city.
Groups are given until about 5 p.m.
to do "all these crazy things as a team
while barely knowing each other" said
sophomore Silvia Sanchez.
From mooning Larkin Street and
getting a piercing to performing in the
streets, the group that accomplishes the
most tasks on the list — with pictures as
proof — wins some kind of prize.
The scavenger hunt hurdles you into
your new Bay area environment, help
ing you to get a quick look at much of
San Francisco in a short amount of time,
as well as provides ample opportunity
for bonding.
"The San Francisco scavenger hunt
was at that kind of awkward time where
we were all trying to make good impres
sions on one another, so it was such a

relief to be able to run around and look
stupid fora legitimate reason, said soph
omore Kat Lewin. "Plus, although the
people in my group didn't immediately
become long-term friends, every time
we saw each other around we had to
share a secret smile because, hey, we saw
each other run around Lombard Street
naked. That's a bond no one can take
away from you."
Sophomore Christina Mendez has
only fond memories from her freshman
year Scavenger Hunt in San Francisco.
"My favorite parts were when we
convinced some people at the Sir
Francis Drake Hotel to let us take a pic
ture on their bed," she recalled.
"Getting kicked out of the Nike store
was fun too and watching my team
mates David and Nick smear chocolate
all over their faces at the Ghiridhelli
factory was so funny."
If the scavenger hunt sounds like a
day of terrorizing San Francisco with
immensely entertaining, and admittedly
obnoxious, antics — well, it is.
"You have to just lose all shyness in
order to complete the tasks, so you get
to see different sides of people that
rarely come out," Mendez explained.
But it's no lie that the most trying times
bring out the best in people.
Another favorite dorm trip is the ski
trip to Lake Tahoe and the surrounding
areas, which gives frosh the chance to
travel hours from campus and spend a
weekend in the snow.
"I loved ski trip!" Sanchez said. "It
was a huge bonding experience, as well
as a learning experience for those of us
who learned how to ski or snowboard."
And if you don't want to ski or snow
board, you can have a memorable week
end without skiing or snow boarding.

sledding and ice skating.
