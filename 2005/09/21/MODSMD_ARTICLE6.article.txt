How many jokes about inclement weather can
Stanford administrators and faculty make? At the
115 th Opening Convocation yesterday, relocated to
Memorial Church because of rain, speakers tried to
make the opening ceremony for the incoming class of
2009 memorable fora reason other than the weather.
Organizers for New Student Orientation (NSO) had
planned on holding Convocation in the Main Ouad, its
traditional location, when it began to rain early yester
day afternoon.
"Volunteers had already set up chairs yesterday
morning in the Quad," said sophomore Rishan
Mohamed, who was working at the event. "But there
was already a backup plan when it started raining, even
though I heard it was the first time in years it's rained

during Convocation. Obviously, there were fewer seats
in Memorial Church than there were people, but the
transition was amazingly well organized."
Regardless, Memorial Church was filled to capacity
when the ceremony began 15 minutes late, with parents
and students standing along the sides and in the back.
Several even sat outside and listened to a broadcast of
the proceedings.
Freshman Alex Chu, who was sitting inside, said that
he was amazed that the ceremony had been moved
inside so quickly.
"It was nice that there was seating available inside
already," he said. "Memorial Church is a great building
â€” I think they should consider holding Convocation
inside every year."
