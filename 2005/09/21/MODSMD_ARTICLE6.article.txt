# Convocation carries on despite rain

### JENNIFER LIU DESK EDITOR 
How many jokes about inclement weather can
Stanford administrators and faculty make? At the
115 th Opening Convocation yesterday, relocated to
Memorial Church because of rain, speakers tried to
make the opening ceremony for the incoming class of
2009 memorable fora reason other than the weather.
Organizers for New Student Orientation (NSO) had
planned on holding Convocation in the Main Ouad, its
traditional location, when it began to rain early yester
day afternoon.
"Volunteers had already set up chairs yesterday
morning in the Quad," said sophomore Rishan
Mohamed, who was working at the event. "But there
was already a backup plan when it started raining, even
though I heard it was the first time in years it's rained

during Convocation. Obviously, there were fewer seats
in Memorial Church than there were people, but the
transition was amazingly well organized."
Regardless, Memorial Church was filled to capacity
when the ceremony began 15 minutes late, with parents
and students standing along the sides and in the back.
Several even sat outside and listened to a broadcast of
the proceedings.
Freshman Alex Chu, who was sitting inside, said that
he was amazed that the ceremony had been moved
inside so quickly.
"It was nice that there was seating available inside
already," he said. "Memorial Church is a great building
â€” I think they should consider holding Convocation
inside every year."

Hundreds of freshmen and their families stream into Memorial Church to escape the rain.
Religious Life, and University
President John Hennessy took the
opportunity to mention the recent
devastation along the Gulf Coast
caused by Hurricane Katrina. In
addition to the 1,635 freshmen and
50 transfer students, new arrivals at
Stanford include 28 undergraduate
students from four universities in

New Orleans.
"It's a great day, both rain and
shine," said McLennan in his
speech. "Most days, the California
sun enlivens all of us. The rains
remind us of the national challenges
we are facing."
He reminded students to priori
tize what was important to them
and to stay true to themselves.
Nearly all of the speakers had
advice for the freshmen about mak
ing the most of their Stanford expe
rience. Anna Marie Porras, director
of admission, encouraged students

to embrace whatever "moments of
doubt" they had and stretch outside
their comfort zones.
"Your applications showed that
you are more than ready for
Stanford," she said. "You have been
selected from the largest pool in the
history of Stanford in the most com
petitive admissions process ever."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman asked the
members of the class of 2009 one
question: "Are you ready?"
"We want nothing less than to
fully embrace the privileges and

responsibilities of higher learning,"
he said. "In context, everything is an
important part of your academic
journey, but only if you make it so.
We ask and demand much of you,
but more importantly, ask and
demand much of yourself. Then you
will be truly ready for Stanford."
Both senior Allison Rose, the
NSO coordinator, and Hennessy
stressed the importance of getting
to know faculty members. Hennessy
also encouraged freshmen to get to
know students from different back
grounds.

Freshman Doug Morrison said
that he liked the formality of the
ceremony, during which speakers
donned full regalia.
"It really made me focus on what
I was going to do in this next year,"
he said. "My favorite part would
have to be the horn music, though."
The formality of Convocation
also impressed freshman Boah
Kwon, an international student
from South Korea, who said that
the ceremony reinforced the differ
ences she noticed at an American
university.

"Culturally, it's very different,"
she said. "We don't have these gor
geous churches in South Korea.
Normally, entrance ceremonies at
home are much more casual. 1 liked
how serious the speakers were. I felt
like they were really trying to give
us a message."
The message, however serious,
was often tempered with the cele
bratory mood of NSO.
"Real growth involves risk-tak
ing and overcoming adversity,"
Hennessy said in his speech. "Like
rain in September in California."
