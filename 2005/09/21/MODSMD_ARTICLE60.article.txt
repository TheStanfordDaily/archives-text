# And you think you're embarrassing...

### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
As New Student Orientation
kicks off, a whole new flock of
Stanford students will begin rack
ing up stories about embarrassing,
outrageous experiences they've
had on the Farm. As an incoming
frosh or a perpetually-paranoid
upperclassman, you're probably
nervous about messing up and con
fining yourself to the depths of
campus loser-dom.
Tlie following is a compilation
of humiliating, beyond-awkward
moments submitted by real seniors
who can now laugh as they reflect
on the uncomfortable details of
years gone by — and who still have
social lives. So have yourself a
chuckle and stop worrying, because
even if you do something that
makes you want to die on the spot,
you'll be able to see its humor
sometime soon.
Admit Weekend Surprise
"During Admit Weekend 2002,1
was horrified by the idea of taking a
shower in the public bathroom
where someone could walk in on
me naked at any time. Thus, I wait
ed until the middle of the day when
the dorm was empty to take my first
Stanford shower. I had made it

through the shower, relieved, and
was drying off behind the curtain
when, all of a sudden, my RoHo's
roommate walked in on me! I
screamed and she apologized, say
ing she had heard the faucet drip
ping and was going to turn it off.
Hie rest of Admit Weekend was
uncomfortable and I couldn't wait
to go home to my own private bath
room."
Trans-floor lovin'
"One time, I had sex in the Sweet
Hall elevator. 1 don't think anyone
should be proud of that, 1 mean,
that's where programmers go to
die."
An itchy situation
"Winter quarter sophomore year,
I got shingles, also known as adult
chicken pox. Only members of the
American Association of Retired
Persons should get this. But ever
since tennis star James Blake talked
about it on Sports Center, maybe it's
become trendy. Spun another way,
I'm positively a trendsetter."
Nice to meet you
"I came home at midnight from
the opera one night at the begin
ning of Winter Quarter my sopho

more year. I walked into the room,
flipped on the fluorescent light, and
there was my brand new roommate
— who I had never even seen
before, mind you — having sex with
her boyfriend. But hey, at least she
stepped fora second to introduce
herself."
Bringing new meaning
to going down
"I had a tiny single sophomore
year and had no choice but to loft
my bed in order to fit my desk in the
same room. Getting the heavy metal
mattress frame lofted was a huge
ordeal, and — with only one screw
in each hole — it was not exactly
stable. I was convinced that it would
topple down one day and kill who
ever was sitting under it. One
evening I was having sex with my
boyfriend on the lofted bed when
we heard a metallic clink it sounded
like a screw had fallen out. We
jumped off of the bed, grabbed
clothes and opened the door to the
hall to get out of the way of the
falling bed. It turned out that the
clink was keys and not a screw, but
the mood was ruined."
Unfashionably early
"On the first day of classes

freshman year, I was so paranoid
about being late that I actually
woke up at 5 a.m., and without
checking the clock proceeded to
shower, get dressed, read my e-mail
and walk halfway to building 200
before glancing at my watch only
to discover it was 6:15 a.m. What a
dork. Now if I'm up that early it's
only because I haven't gone to
sleep yet."
That was a close
"Once in Econ 1 lecture, 1 sug
gested that free markets can't solve
all the world's problems. Whew —
big mistake."
See you of office hours
"1 had just hooked up with a
freshman who lived in Branner,
and believe me, as a junior, this
should have been bad enough.
Needless to say I had had a bit to
drink earlier in the night. Of
course, on my trek home I run into
my Humßio professor, out jogging
at an ungodly hour of the morning.
Just play it off, 1 thought to myself
as he stopped to say hi. And it
would have worked too, if I hadn't
been holding my bra in my hand.
Yikes."
