# Chow down at — downtown hot spots
## Places you'll love and the best food to order there 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
It's mid-October and you haven't
been off-campus since your parents
moved you in? Think you can't get
to a fun place off-campus because
you don't have a car or enough
time? It's early November and
you're getting sick of on-campus
food? You want to go out to dinner
with a group of friends and maybe
even ask the guy/girl you've: liked all
year to come along?
Don't give up just because you
don't have a car!
University Avenue is a great
getaway, just a 10-to-lfi minute
bike ride from campus. The
Marguerite also has free shuttles
running from campus every day for
those of you who want a break
from the bike.
Check out some of Stanford's
favorite places to visit in downtown
Palo Alto:
1. Starbucks —
TTiis is a very popular place to
study. It's perfect fora Saturday or
Sunday afternoon. With a few
friends and a latte, reading the
books you've been dreadiing to open
all weekend won't be as bad as you
thought.
2. Pasta? —
If you need a break from dining
hall meals, treat yourself to a nice
dish of pasta at Pasta? This restau
rant has a great atmosphere, with
tables both outside and inside. Even
on a crowded Friday or Saturday
night, you can get a table in at least
20 to 25 minutes. Not to mention,
this restaurant is probably the best
priced Italian place you will find in
Palo Alto, with main pasta dishes

starting at $8 to $10.
3. Gelato Classico —
This local place is a little off
University Avenue, on Emerson
Street. Top your meal off with any
flavor of gelato ranging from
Tiramisu to Strawberry. Gelato
Classico is arguably the most popu
lar ice cream shop in Palo Alto, with
homemade gelato that will beat the
competition's ice cream any day.
Prices are reasonable and if you
show your Stanford ID, you'll even
get a discount!
4. Gordon Biersch —
This restaurant is also off
University Avenue, at the corner of
Forest and Emerson streets. It's a
great brewery, whose burgers and
fries are the best you'll find in the
area. Their delicious dinner-sized
salads are known for hitting the
spot. For those of you 21 or older,
they have free samplers of their five
beers. There is never a wait, even on
a Friday or Saturday night.
5. Border's Books and Music —
If you think all Border's are cre
ated equal, try going to the one on
University Avenue. This Border's is
located in the Old Varsity Theatre,
giving it a unique charm that can
turn anyone who enters into a book
lover. As you enter, you walk
through an outdoor reading area,
with tables near a fountain. The
Border's cafe is just inside the door.
Grab a hot cocoa and browse the
new best sellers.
6. Cheesecake Factory —
This restaurant is right on
University Avenue and is one of the
more popular places to eat in Palo
Alto. You would be hard-pressed to

find any evening or afternoon with
out a wait, but it's never too long —
and the cheesecake alone makes it
worth it. The atmosphere makes this
place perfect for either a group of
friends or a first date. There are 30
different flavors of cheesecake to
choose from, but if you thought this
place was only known for its
desserts, you will be in fora sur
prise. The menu looks more like a
book, offering dishes ranging from
pizzas to cashew chicken to steaks
and burgers.
7. Mivake —
This sushi place is the first restau
rant in sight as you enter Palo Alto
from Palm Drive. On a Friday or
Saturday night you'll often see a
large crowd gathered outside wait
ing to get in. After 7 p.m., only those
over 21 can get in for their famous
sake bombing nights. If you're not of
age and go at 6 p.m. on a weekend
night, you will definitely be able to
get in. It's the perfect place even for
non-experienced sushi eaters. The
prices are reasonable, and the sushi
is superb.
And if you can't make it off cam
pus, there's still a classy option right
here at Stanford.
8. Ciao! —
This Italian Cafe opened last year
in the basement of the Terman
Engineering Center. It's family
owned and gives a unique, cozy
atmosphere that is very hard to find
elsewhere on campus. In addition to
serving foccacia and gelato that are
both homemade, they import cheese
mozzarella for their sandwiches. For
those of you missing the taste of
home-cooked muffins, sandwiches
or even pasta, Ciao! is the perfect
place.
