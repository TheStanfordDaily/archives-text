# Get a Caffeine Jerk... Off Campus
## 
### RICARDO GILB INTERMISSION CAFFEINE ADDICT 
Why study off
campus, you ask? Why
not go to the CoHo,
to the LaIR, to
Meyer, to

Green, to all of the hallowed spots
where such scholars as Tiger Woods
must have studied? Why go out into
the treacherous environment of
Palo Alto only to be lost in
anonymity? For starters there's my ■
usual reason — that you don't want
anyone to know exactly what it is
you're studying, because they would
find out that the reason you are full
of brilliant comments during dinner
is that you spend your days reading
books called, "Hie Complete Idiot's
Guide to American Literature" and
"Classical Music for Dummies." (I
don't even want to imagine the
shame, the terrible shame, of expo
sure! Thank God no one reads this
newspaper.)
Oh, but maybe you don't read
such smut. Maybe you read only
fine works of literature. Well, it's
time you faced the truth: reading
those wonderful IHUM books at

Stanford marks you imme

diately as a freshman,
but off-campus,
reading those

same books
makes you... an
intellectual!

So find a
friend with a car,
or find a friend
l who happens
Ik to drive the

Marguerite, or find a friend who has
a helicopter and who knows how to
park it in the middle of Palo Alto.
We 11... I guess you could just hop on
your bike if faced with no alterna
tives. And point your wheels
(whichever kind they may be)
towards the following places:
Happy Donuts, 3916 El Camino Real.
(650)843-0658
It's not a coffee shop, but a donut
shop, with donuts the way they
ought to be — weighing about a
pound each, unlike those puffed
fluff balls that Krispy Kreme spits
out. It isn't pretty, but it's open 24
hours and serves plenty of coffee,
meaning that this isn't so much the
place to relax on a Saturday as a
place to desperately attempt to keep
yourself awake with chocolate
dclairs and caffeine at 5 a.m. when
your paper is due at 10 (that's a.m.),
and since it has free wireless access,
you can finish at nine 9:59 and still e
mail it in by the deadline.
Printer's Inc. Cafe, 320 California
Ave., across from Antonio's
Nuthouse. (650) 323-3347
California Avenue is the center of
Palo Alto's middle-aged art scene.
The Cafe itself has a gallery of art
produced by locals, and across from it
is a great store for photographers.
Down the block, there are a few
printing presses. Since this is Palo
Alto and not Greenwich Village,
the artistic area is also full of
California spirituality — including
a center for meditation and the
Creative Awareness Project, a non
profit committed to researching
the nature of consciousness.
■ \ Even if you find it all a Uttle
'% silly, the local crowd does
make fora peaceful
\ neighborhood,and

there's plenty of patio space which
is great since there's no rule that
you can't work on your tan while
you work on your problem sets.
The PtoMllc Oven, 550 Waverly
St., just off of University Drive.
(650) 326-8485
You can't count on studying to
cheer you up, so sometimes you
need a delicious piece of cake to do
the trick. That's where the Prolific
Oven comes in, serving a variety of
wonderful desserts that have made
it a local favorite for many years. It
doesn't have a whole lot of person
ality — the decoration is sparse and
the music isn't that great, but it's
usually quiet and easy to get a big
table for several people. There's
really no other place to get a piece
of Chocolate Orange Almond
Cake. And, as the name of the place
suggests... no, to tell you the truth,
I don't know what it means.
Coupa Cafe, 538 Ramona St. (650)
322-6872
The pun in the title is even clev
erer than you might think, since it
actually comes from the name of
the owner, Jean Paul Coupal.
Where so many coffeehouses have
used a Latin American theme to
suggest some kind of Bohemian
sympathy with the poor, Coupal, a
native of Venezuela, has used
knowledge of his own country to
create a wonderfully elegant hang
out. Serving the finest of
Venezuelan chocolates and coffees
is only a bonus. There are plenty of
outlets lining the walls and free
wireless access, so that you can still
check your e-mail between para
graphs of reading. There is even a
Stanford logo in the fireplace's tiles,
just in case you were missing the
Stanford-feel of campus.
