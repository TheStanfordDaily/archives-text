j INTERMISSION VENUE ARTIST
: So you're new to the area. You're set- 1
• tling in to college life — you've adjusted to
I living with a stranger, you know everyone's
• name in your dorm (almost) and dining
hall food actually tastes good. But you feel
• like something's missing ... So you pick up
: Intermission, and realize what your soul so
•desperately needs — live music! You're
j seized with terror ... How do I figure out
• where to attend concerts in a new part of
: the country? How do I get there and
• whose going to be playing when I show
• U P?
• Rest assured, an experienced Bay Area
I concert-goer is here to explain it all:
I Shoreline Amphitheatre
• www.shorelineamp.com
: If you're looking fora large outdoor
• theater to take in big-name concerts and
: festivals, you've hit the jackpot: the
• Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View
: is regarded as the best in the country in this
; category. It also happens to be the closest
: concert venue, located about 5 miles south
•of campus off Shoreline Avenue. With
I 6,500 fixed seats and a lawn that holds up
• to 20,000, its concert season begins in May
: and finishes in October. No doubt you'll
• run into someone you know on the grass at
: a Shoreline concert, and with a little luck
• you'll talk him/her into sharing his/her tarp
: with you (since it's first come-first served).
• Maybe he/she will even let you snuggle
: under his/her blanket with him/her when
• the temperature drops (and it will). Recent
: years have seen a decline in quality and
• quantity of concerts here, although two
: major upcoming shows might help salvage
• the Shoreline's reputation. On Oct. 8. the
: Download Festival brings The Killers,
• Mouse, the Arcade Fire, the Doves and the
: Lovemakers, among others. Neil Young's
• Bridge School Benefit marks the end of
: the concert season at the Shoreline every
• year; this year, on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, the
: concert brings an as-yet-to-be-announced

• cast of acoustic performers

: including Neil Young him-

• self. Past performers

: include Paul McCartney,
• Red Hot Chili Peppers

and Ben Harper, as well as regular Eddie
Vedder.
HP Pavilion at San Jose
www.hppsj.com
The HP Pavilion at San Jose, home to
the San Jose Sharks, is a standard large,
impersonal venue seating 20,000. It's a 20-
minute drive on Interstate 280, but
CalTrain provides a great alternative to the
parking mess (especially for the vehicular
ly-challenged among us. ahem freshman)
— the San Jose stop is across the street.
For the most part, only "big names" sched
ule concerts here and ticket prices are too
expensive. Upcoming shows include the
Eagles on Oct. 10 and Oct. 14, Gwen
Stefani and the Black Eyed Peas on Oct.
18, Paul McCartney on Nov. 7 and Nov. 8
and Depeche Mode and the Raveonettes
on Nov. 18.
Oakland Coliseum
www.coliseum.com
The Oakland Coliseum, seating 19,000,
is farther away than the other big-name
venues — driving, it takes almost an hour,
including the Dumbarton Bridge. The
Coliseum is another popular host for
chart-topping bands but the concrete
d6cor leaves the audience wondering if
they are in a parking garage. On Sept. 30,
Queens of the Stone Age and Nine Inch
Nails will perform. The Mars Volta and
System of a Down perform on Oct. 8 and
Hot Hot Heat, Weezer, and the Foo
Fighters are scheduled for Oct. 28. U2 is
also stopping by during their Vertigo Tour
on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9.
The Fillmore

The Fillmore, on the corner of Fillmore
St.and Geary Blvd. in San Francisco, is
known for presenting the best music of the
day. Sixties legend Bill Graham began his

the careers of Santana, Grateful Dead,
Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and

capacity of just under (
1,200. Upon

Another San Francisco club known for •
its musical history is Bimbo's 365 Club, :
