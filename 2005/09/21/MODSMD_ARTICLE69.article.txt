# Roxy Says Get Your Fill Without The Date
## 
### ROXY SASS FRESHMAN SEX GODDESS 
There is an old myth that Stanford students
don't date. Somehow on The Farm we man
age to go straight from dance floor hookup to
sharing our twin-extra longs with the same
person every night for four years without so
much as a regular date in between.
Some blame it on a shortage of things to
do in Palo Alto or on the fact that freshmen
can't have cars on campus, but Roxy knows
that the majority of us here at Stanford don't
go out on dates because we're too busy hav
ing sex.
Why spend $60 on a dinner at The
Cheesecake Factory when the SHPRC gives
you and your partner enough condoms and
flavored lube to keep you busy (and getting
busy) from now until winter break. Actually
they only give you twelve each but the PHEs
are notorious for being condom goldmines.
Last year, when Roxy started "exclusively
hooking up" with a guy, it was weeks before
we ventured out of our Mirrielees sex shack
and off-campus to a dinner for two.
We had been dating without so much as an
actual date. At Stanford, hooking up is syn
onymous with sharing a milkshake at your

favorite diner or having a moonlit stroll on
the beach — just a little more convenient.
Yes, convenience is key. It's the driving
force behind dormcest — a past time for
freshmen nationwide. Why try to win some

one's heart with your charm, when the
open-door policy of your freshman dorm
means you can walk across the hall fora
romp in the sack without so much as comb
ing your hair first.

In the next few weeks you will learn how
to scope out the darkest corner of the dance
floor at a Kappa Sig party, how to slink into
an empty laundry room for your post-party
exploits, and where that place is in South
Stacks that no one goes looking for books.
IHUM lecture will go from being just anoth
er nap to a meat market of fellow freshmen
who share your aversion to Plato and all
things Republican. And it is only a matter of
time until the first Screw Your Roommate
dances have you pimping your bunkmate out
to the first available water polo player or
gymnast.
In about a month, the campus will be abuzz
about "Full Moon on the Quad" and you'll
find yourself explaining to your friends from
home that there is nothing strange about a
University-sponsored orgy. After all, they do
give out complimentary shots of Listerine.
And by the time midterms roll around, you
will have gotten used to being sex-iled, and
the dorm lounge will be your second home
whenever your roommate hangs the prover
bial white sock on the doorknob.
So what's a freshman to do to prepare for
all that is ahead? Stock up on condoms, buy
lots of chewing gum and try not to be that kid
who gets mono the first week.


Full Moon on the Quad.
Yeah...you'll have a grainy
picture like this one in a month, i
