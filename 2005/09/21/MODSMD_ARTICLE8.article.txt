## London attacks carefully crafted far in advance 
### BETH GARDINER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LONDON (AP) — The suicide bombers who
struck London's transit network did reconnaissance
ahead of time and used peroxide-based explosives that
took skill to assemble, suggesting the deadly attacks
were carefully planned, police said Tuesday.
Closed-circuit television footage taken June 28
shows three of the four bombers following the same
route they took on the day of the bombings, which
killed 56 people including themselves.
"What this told us about these people is that this
was carefully planned," said Peter Clarke, head of
the police anti-terrorist branch. "This is quite typical
of terrorists' methods ... to reconnoiter the layout,
the timings, to check security, to check all those
things that they would feel in their mind they need
ed to get right."
The three men wore T-shirts and baseball caps.T\vo
wore smaller backpacks than the ones believed to have
carried the deadly July 7 bombs. A fourth, alleged bus
bomber Hasib Hussain, was not present.
The pictures show the three bombers entering
Luton train station north of the capital, arriving at
London's King's Cross and entering the Underground
system. Footage was also found showing the three at
the Baker Street subway station, close to one of the
bombing sites.
The images bore striking similarities to television
pictures released earlier showing the suspects entering
Luton station on July 7 and walking inside, with heavy
knapsacks strapped to their backs.
Detectives located the June 28 images after find
ing train tickets and receipts.
Britain's closed-circuit cameras are owned by
many entities _ including private transit companies,
traffic monitors, shops and banks _ so there is no rule
on how long tape must be stored. Police seized about
80,000 recordings after the bombings and are review
ing them.
The suspects _ Mohammad Sidique Khan,Shahzad
Tanweer and Germaine Lindsay _ spent about three

hours in London on June 28 and may have split up dur
ing that time, police said. Investigators were still
searching closed-circuit tapes for more about what the
bombers did in the city.
Clarke also gave the first official confirmation
that the bombs were based on peroxide, as the New
York police said in August without authorization
from London.
He said one of the apartments police had searched
in Leeds, the northern English city that was home to
three of the four bombers, had been a "carefully thought
out and effective (bomb) manufacturing facility."
The attackers carried explosives in coolers the
morning they struck, he said.
Detectives found two unexploded bombs in a
Nissan Micra they left at Luton station, Clarke said.
Those devices were also made of peroxide and were
surrounded by nails, he said.
Clarke said police also found traces of HMTP, a
type of peroxide explosive, in the car.

Andy Oppenheimer, an explosives expert with
Jane's Information Group, said HMTP was one of a
group of explosives made from common, easily avail
able items such as hydrogen peroxide, which can be
used as a hair bleach or antiseptic. The ingredients are
tricky to assemble and can blow up accidentally in
unskilled hands, he said.
Assistant Police Commissioner Andy Hayman said
the investigation was"a colossal undertaking."
Among the 15 sites detectives have examined is a
landfill in West Yorkshire, where forensic searches are
still going on, Clarke said.
Police said they have interviewed more than 3,000
witnesses, and seized nearly 30,000 items from the
sites, which included homes linked to the bombers in
and near Leeds.
More than 1,000 of the seized items came from the
apartment where police believe the bombs were made,
they said. The search of that home took more than six
weeks and ended only recently, the police said.
