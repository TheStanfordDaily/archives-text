### NICOLE WINFIELD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
ROME (AP) — The US. Justice Department has told
a Texas court that a lawsuit accusing Pope Benedict XVI of
conspiring to cover up the sexual molestation of three boys
by a seminarian should be dismissed because the pontiff
enjoys immunity as head of state of the Holy See.
Assistant US. Attorney General Peter Keisler said in
Monday's filing that allowing the lawsuit to proceed
would be "incompatible with the United States' foreign
policy interests.
There was no immediate ruling from Judge Lee
Rosenthal of the US. District Court for the southern dis
trict of Texas in Houston. However, US. courts have been
bound by such "suggestion of immunity" motions submit
ted by the government, Keisler's filing says.
A 1994 lawsuit against Pope John Paul 11, also filed in
Texas, was dismissed after the US. government filed a sim
ilar motion.
Keisler's motion was not unexpected, as the Vatican
Embassy in Washington had asked the US. government to
issue the immunity suggestion and do everything it could to
get the case dismissed.
The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was named as
a defendant in a civil lawsuit by three plaintiffs who allege
that Juan Carlos Patino-Arango, a Colombian-born semi
narian on assignment at St. Francis de Sales church in
Houston, molested them during counseling sessions in the
church in the mid-19905.
Patino-Arango has been indicted in a criminal case
by a grand jury in Harris County, Texas, and is a fugitive
from justice.
The lawsuit alleges Ratzinger, who headed the
Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
before becoming pope, was involved in a conspiracy to hide
Patino-Arango's crimes and help him escape prosecution.
The lawsuit cites a May 18,2001, letter from Ratzinger
written in Latin to bishops around the world, explaining
that "grave" crimes such as the sexual abuse of minors
would be handled by his congregation and that the pro
ceedings of special church tribunals handling the cases
were subject to "pontifical secret."
Daniel Shea, attorney for one of the plaintiffs, has said
such secret proceedings amounted to a conspiracy to cover
up the crimes.
