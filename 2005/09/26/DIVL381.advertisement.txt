What is niylhology and what arc its Jeep meanings in our lives? Why do we still find
ancient myths as touchstones in our metaphor and everyday speech? For example, what
does it mean to he ''between a rock and a hard place"? What is the danger of the "Siren
Song"? What is meant by a "Herculean labor"? Why is understanding mythology so
foundational to history and culture? Why are the "Fates Blind"? How and why <Jo we
understand the "Apple of Discord", the "Arrows of Kros" and power of Aphrodite and the
''Golden Fleece"? These are a few course topic questions.
We examine the role of the Olympian gods and goddesses, great heroes and their ordeals,
such as Herakles (Hercules), Odysseus (Ulysses). Perseus, Jason and Theseus, the central
places of mvth like Mycenae, Thebes, Athens, Troy, as well as monsters like the
Chimaera, Medusa, Sphinxes and Sucns, the glories and tragedies of Circek myths like
Achilles, Oedipus, Orpheus, the Amazons, the Fates, and how myths attempted to explain
nature in the (ireek world. The format of the course will be in slide illustrations of myth
art and the excerpted literary works of Greek poets.
This course fulfills GER: 3a requirements.
