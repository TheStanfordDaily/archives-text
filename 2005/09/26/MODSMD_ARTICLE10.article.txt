GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
— Israel pressed forward with a
broad offensive against Islamic mili
tants on Sunday, killing an Islamic
Jihad commander in a pinpoint
airstrike in the Gaza Strip and
rounding up more than 200 wanted
Palestinians.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
promised to use "all means" against
the militants, and Hamas later said it
would halt rocket fire. Early Mon
day, the Israeli military carried out
two airstrikes in Gaza.
The offensive, coming just two
weeks after Israel withdrew from
Gaza, followed a wave of militant
rocket attacks against Israeli towns
over the weekend. Israel has prom
ised to continue with its airstrikes, ar
rests and a possible ground invasion
until the rocket fire ceases.
"There shall be no restrictions on
the use of all means to hit the terror
ists and the terror organizations,
their equipment and their hideouts,"
Sharon told his Cabinet Sunday.
Despite the pledge from Hamas,
Israeli officials said they would wait
to see if things remained quiet before
calling off the offensive.
The pullout and the recent wave
of fighting have weakened Sharon in
his ruling Likud Party ahead of a cru
cial vote Monday. Sharon walked out
of a stormy Likud meeting Sunday
without delivering his prepared
speech after what appeared to be an
intentional electricity outage pre
vented him from speaking.
Many party members are angry at
Sharon over the pullout, and it ap
peared that his opponents sabotaged
the electric system. Monday's vote

will set a date for party primaries,
and a setback for Sharon could force
him to leave the party he founded
three decades ago, most likely to
form a new centrist party.
Early Monday, an Israeli helicop
ter fired a missile in an attack the
army said was aimed at a road in
Gaza leading to a field used by mili
tants to fire rockets at Israel. In an
other attack early Monday, an Israeli
helicopter fired two missiles at a
workshop the army said was used by
Hamas to make weapons.
That airstrike in Gaza City set the
building on fire, but no casualties were
reported in either Monday attack.
Sunday's airstrike killed Islamic
Jihad's top commander in southern
Gaza, Mohammed Khalil, and his
bodyguard as they drove along a
coastal road in Gaza City.
The airstrike signaled a return to
Israel's policy of targeted killings,
which were halted after a February
cease-fire declaration.
The army said Khalil, 35, was re
sponsible for attacks that killed 17 Is
raelis.
After the airstrike, Mohammed
al-Hindi, Islamic Jihad's top leader in
Gaza and the West Bank, said the
group would no longer honor the
cease-fire. "There is no talk of a
truce, there is only room for talk of
war," he said.
Although the truce has brought a
sharp drop in fighting. Islamic Jihad
has carried out a series of attacks in
recent months, including three sui
cide bombings in Israel.
However, Mahmoud Zahar,
leader of the much larger Hamas
group, said he had ordered an end to
rocket attacks and a halt in military
style celebrations in order to pre
serve the truce.
