## Stanford Singles This quarter, take on five units worth of dating 
### 
They say there's no dating at Stanford/
And I tell you I used to agree/ Then I
found myself a solution/1 found myself
a remedy...? So begins Fleet Street's "Life-
Sized Barbie," a tale of a guy who becomes so
frustrated with the campus social scene he
turns to the plastic embrace of Mattel for
companionship (the song was written by my
ex while we were still together — ouch). It ap
pears that the watchful eyes of the a cappella
community have picked up on the fact that
when it comes to non-platonic interactions,
here on the Farm we do things ... we 11... a lit
tle differently.

Stanford students are by nature in
tense beings. I mean, even our vernacu- Jfe
lar reflects intolerance for inefficiency
(can you imagine actually taking the
time to say Coffee House instead of
CoHo?). So it makes sense that we prune our
social lives with the same reckless abandon
with which we truncate our words.
You see, I've come to believe that a
healthy social environment contains the full
spectrum of romantic exchanges, everything
from casual flirting to semi-serious dating to
exclusive relationships. But for some reason,
we prefer the "CoHo" version of the social
spectrum — the state of existence I call the
hookup-or-marriage phenomenon.
The hookup-or-marriage phenomenon
refers to the idea that students, when pre
sented with the opportunity to pursue some
thing beyond friendship with another indi
vidual, will most likely choose to engage in
either a random hookup or a serious rela
tionship without considering the entire
range of appropriate social options. It's kind
of bizarre when you think about it. I mean,
how many couples do you know who are
simply "dating" as opposed to "hooking up"
or "currently picking out the names of their
children who will be spaced exactly three
years apart"?
There are several potential explanations
for why this is the case. Last year, one of my
friends brought up the interesting point that a
residence-centered social scene on a fairly
small campus makes casual dating especially
difficult. We are most likely to bond with our
neighbors in our dorms, houses and apart
ments, but it puts extra pressure on any rela
tionship-type situation to know that if you
suddenly lose interest in your drawmate,
you're still going to have to see them every
time they walk to the bathroom to exfoliate.
Therefore, it's much easier to be either at
tached to your significant other at the hip or
make out with the cute sophomore down the
hall when you can blame your forward ad
vances on the particularly strong Franzia
served at Cafe Night.
Although this theory definitely has merit,
I think that perhaps the issue runs much
deeper than that. We are a community of go
getters, individuals who are used to setting
goals and then working our butts off to
achieve them. We are defined by our success.
We are the cream of the crop, the best of the
best — and we are deathly afraid of failure. Is
it any wonder then that we seek out the social
interactions that minimize our vulnerability
to rejection?
The problem with this approach to a love
life is that our entire generation risks being
thrown into the real world with a skewed
concept of intimacy. Hookups condition us to
separate the emotional and physical aspects
of romance, while prematurely serious rela
tionships keep us from developing a compre
hensive idea of what qualities we want in a
life partner. Living on the extreme ends of
the spectrum may work for us within the
Bubble, but one day we're going to need to
learn how to interact with each other like
adults — with passion, with respect and. yes,
with failure.
The bottom line is that dating requires the
sort of vulnerability we avoid at all costs but
desperately need in order to learn about the
world of social interaction. It sucks to be
burned — believe me, I know — but what
other choice do we have than to risk every
thing? To live a life played safely, never to ex
perience deep connection with a real person
because we are paralyzed by the prospect of
pain?
Well, I hear that Barbie is single these days.
