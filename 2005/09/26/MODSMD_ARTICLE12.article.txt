"It all starts with education,"says sophomore
Michele Goldman, referring to the challenge in
volved in stopping terrorism. Goldman's own
education entailed traveling to Israel, a country
often afflicted by suicide bombings, where she
learned to fire Ml6s and conversed with con
victed terrorists.
Goldman, along with Nashonme Johnson, a
senior currently participating in the Stanford in
Washington program, traveled to the small Mid
dle Eastern country this August on the first leg of
a year-long fellowship with the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies (FDD), a nonprof
it. nonpartisan think-tank dedicated to fighting
terrorism through education and research.
Goldman, Johnson and 40 other university
students from around the country were awarded
fellowships intended to expose undergraduates
to the terrorist threats facing the I Jnited States.
The fellows will travel to Washington, D.C. later
this year to witness how counter-terrorism oper
ates in this country.
While in Israel, Goldman and Johnson took
graduate-level seminars at Tel Aviv University,
receiving an eye-opening introduction to the
places and politics of terrorism in Israel. Gold
man says she was "constantly in awe" of the peo
ple she met. including ambassadors from Jordan
and the United States, members of the Israeli in
telligence force "the Mossad" and members of
the Israeli counter-terror undercover unit.

The fellows were also taken out on the field
to experience first-hand what it means to fight
terrorism. In a small shack outside Jerusalem,
they trained with undercover anti-terrorism
units, learning to fire M-16s. These undercover
forces speak Arabic and dress accordingly to in
filtrate terrorist cells and prevent attacks, Gold
man says, adding "We got a grasp of the incredi -
ble challenges that undercover units face on a
daily basis."
Goldman confronted these challenges head
on during a visit she took with other fellows to a
high-security prison in Gilboa. Israel, where she
spoke with a young man sentenced to 27 life
terms for plotting terrorist acts with Hamas.The
young man. who, according to Goldman, had no
remorse,said that 1 lamas does not kill the inno
cent because all Israelis are potential soldiers.
"It was disturbing to see the mindset of these
people who have no reverence for human life,"
Goldman says. This attitude, she argues, is prop
agated in schools, which breed the next genera
tion of terrorists at an early age. For example, the
fellows saw footage of Palestinian school chil
dren cheerfully chanting."Let's kill the Jews."
" Iliere is so much hatred, and I don't see how
it could end until this indoctrination stops,"
Goldman comments.
Back on campus,she relates the difficulties to
her peers, who she sees as the future voters and
policy-makers who will inherit the task of fight
ing terrorism. Part of the FDD fellowship in
cludes organizing five campus-wide events

throughout the year to raise awareness on the is
sues of terrorism. The first event will be held in
White Plaza on Oct. 7 in commemoration of the
victims of Sept.l 1.
'Hie goal of these events is to raise students'
awareness about terrorism. Goldman asserts
that some college students tend to adopt a moral
relativity on the issue, empathizing with terror
ists and rationalizing their roles as freedom
fighters.
"It is so necessary to stand in unity on this
issue," she says. "If we cannot agree that human
life has value, and that one cannot kill an inno
cent child in order to prove a cause, then our fu
ture can only be hopeless."
Goldman says the trip to Israel gave faces to
the people fighting terrorism behind the scenes,
turning a controversial political issue into a
human reality. She explains she must now bring
those lessons home, exposing Stanford students
to the stories and people she encountered.
Goldman remarks that she was awed by
standing in places where previous terrorist at
tacks took place and knowing she was safe only
because of the work of people she encountered
during her trip.
"People our age have to go in and do this
every day to save innocent lives," she says, refer
ring to the dangerous work done by undercover
forces.
ITirough the FDD fellowship. Goldman says
she and the other fellows are finding their own
way to help.
