# Group pimps-out golf cart, mentors youngsters

Stanford University prides itself on giv
ing its students the best resources to
reach their full potential. Yet just miles
away, 50 percent of the children do not grad
uate from high school, in part because of re
sources spread too thinly, according to the
Boys and Cxirls Club of Hast Palo Alto.
Here on campus, many students are ad
dressing the issue by volunteering for or cre
ating community outreach programs to help
youth in East Palo Alto excel academically.
One special example is TUTOR 24, de
scribed by Samuel Alemayehu, a sopho
more and co-founder of the group, as an or
ganization created "to find ways to diffuse
resources from higher learning institutions
like Stanford to their adjacent low income

community like Fast Palo Alto."
Alemayehu says he worked with the East
Palo Alto Hoys and (lirls ( lub to implement
fun projects that would encourage students'
interest in math and science - most recently
turning an old golf cart into a partially solar
powered car.
"Inspired by the popular TV-show
"Pimp My Ride." the Ciolf Cart Project at
tempts to pimp a beat up golf cart while
teaching students about basic science skills
and attracting them to engineering fields,"
Alemayehu says. "Features of the golf cart
include a solar powered small refrigerator, a
solar powered stereo system and a barome
ter," he adds.
TIJTOR24 was co-founded by three
other students: sophomores Mike Wood
ward and Michael McDaniels and junior

Marcelo Worsley. It is supported by Teen
Technology TUtoring, or T3, a student com
munity service group on campus founded by
Worsley. Alemayehu says.
"TUTOR 24 matches a group of mentors
with students from the local community," he
explains. "The projects each have a detailed
curriculum and are designed to encourage
students to apply classroom basic math, sci
ence and writing skills."
Alemayehu says he hopes that
TUTOR 24 will help the retention rates of
high school students. "Many kids have so
much potential yet never make it through
high school," he says.
TUTOR 24 is currently teaming up with
the Stanford School of Education to
research project-based learning and group
collaborations in learning.

ITie co-founders of TUTOR 24 have also
gotten Stanford faculty involved in their ef
forts. but the professors say they refuse to
take any of the credit for this student
spurred project.
"I was asked by some students to deliver
a lecture to some of the participants during
the summer, which 1 was happy to do, but I
am not an organizer, just a helper of the
cause," says Mark Godfrey Mungal, a pro
fessor in the Department of Mechanical En
gineering.
Alemayehu. Woodward. Worsley and
McDaniels say they arc interested in areas
of engineering and hope to use their educa
tion to help people, either through re
search or medical studies. Alemayehu adds
they hope to expand TUTOR 24 to differ
ent colleges and universities.
