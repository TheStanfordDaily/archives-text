## Editorial Daily wants you to get up, get out 
### 
College will be the best years of your
life. That's what everyone says,
anyway. Everyone from your par
ents — who still tell the story about
catching the Allman Brothers at some
dive before they got really big — to your
teachers, who might as well be handing
you a Pabst with your diploma. Because
in American culture, this adage has one
meaning — frat party pub crawls, mid
night skinny-dipping, the general "Ani
mal House" way of life.
In the six days of scheduled bonding
since you arrived, you've probably con
ceded that the closest you're going to get
to this ideal are the navy Freshman /
Sophomore College shirts with COL
LEGE branded across the chest a la John
Belushi. But this doesn't have to be the
case — and The Daily can help.
Stanford is a complex place. While
there is a distinct segment of our some
times-too-small community dedicated to
partying and upholding the great bong
crafting traditions of yesteryear, there are
also those who stick like glue to their essay
outlines and 11 p.m. bedtimes. Yet the vast
majority of students here are those who
work hard and wish they could play hard
— if only they had something to do.
I'm speaking to you, the droves of stu
dents lacking both cars and the inclination
to explore outside the rumored Bubble.
Those of you afflicted with the Stanford
dubbed "Duck Syndrome," chill on the
surface and ever-paddling beneath in B
plus-infested waters. Our school may not
have a reputation for much beyond its
masterful sports program and famously
early-closing downtown area, but it's a sit
uation easily remedied.
In the past, editors-in-chief have used
this welcome column to express their ded
ication to responding to the paper's read
ership, journalistic integrity and broad
coverage. Most honorably, my predeces
sor even included her cell phone number
to prove her commitment to never missing
a beat of this campus's pulse. Mine is (650)
387-3104, and I am equally devoted to an
swering your story pitches, comments and
queries — even if it's where to get the best
donuts and free wireless at 5 a.m. (An
swer: Happy Donuts, 3916 El Camino
Real, hands down).
It seems to go without saying that
we're hoping you'll get involved in the
paper, that you'll make it a priority to get
your voice heard. And I will certainly help
you to do so in any way I can (you can e
mail me direct at eic@daily.stanford.edu
or call 725-2100 ext. 501). So when it
comes to the goals I have for this next vol
ume, I've decided to step gingerly into un
charted territory, as I seem to be doing in
several ways already.
Returning students, you might notice
that the face of The Stanford Daily has
been altered to achieve a more traditional
and accessible feel. Layout, graphics and
photo will be taking a leap this year to fol

low professional, rather than college,
trends. In this spirit, the paper's writers
and editors have made it their mission to
cut the wheat from the chaff when it
comes to what Stanford students really
need to know and use.
Last week's Orientation issue, still
available around campus, is a good indica
tion of what we hope to accomplish over
the course of the next four months. We
will keep you updated with what there is
to do, not only within an hour of campus,
but all over Northern California — and
most importantly, how to get there if you
haven't yet befriended the kid down the
hall with the interior-carpeted '70s-style
van. Look for calendar listings and week
end ideas in the Friday Destinations sec
tion on page three, as well as the reinvent
ed Intermission.
Getting away isn't our only tip to find a
good time at Stanford — it's just too often
overlooked in favor of Saturday night
house parties 20 minutes from the comfort
of your dorm room. But hey, if it's Friday
night and you find yourself dressed up
with nowhere to go, we've got a few sug
gestions. Catch Marie Christine Canniz
zaro's Monday column to jumpstart your
love life — followed closely by Natalie
Ramos' Thursday article on how to keep
that love life hot, yet safe, and food critic
Shelby Martin's reviews of the best places
to take your special someone. If web
building is your cup of tea, Andy Leifer's
tech talk on Tuesday is a must, as is Robin
Pam and Miri Hutcherson's column if it's
Stanford's natural beauty and vibrant stu
dent groups that interest you.
News and Sports, the tried-and-true
sections of the paper are also undergoing
a facelift, with less reliance on what we've
always done in the past and more articles
tailored to fit the topics that most in
trigue the Stanford populace today and
every day.
This volume is all about blowing the
whistle and raising eyebrows. To get on
board or simply tip us off, dial any of the
numbers above, or come on down to the
Storke Publications Building any Sunday
through Thursday after 5 p.m. Have some
sesame chicken, stay a while.
