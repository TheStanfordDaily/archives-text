## Why the June rush? 
### CHRISTOPHER R. VAUGHN 
Every other Wednesday of the
school year, students and faculty
gather in Memorial Church to lis
ten to a professor or public figure of
Stanford relate "What Matters to Me and
Why."The value of this exercise, it seems
to me, lies in its thoughtfulness. So far as
our habit is to hurry through, bounce be
tween or plainly ignore our thoughts, it is
useful at least to dwell on a few of them.
If these bi-weekly talks represent the
best of a threatened routine, then we
might stop to ponder a larger question. It
is of equal value and is equally able to es
cape our view: What matters to the Uni
versity and why?
I have often pondered this question
myself, but it came back to me especially
last Commencement Weekend in the
form of a troubling realization — the
sprint from finals week to graduation
threatens to snuff out the final moments
of quality time that students can spend
together at year's end.
Last Commencement Weekend was
the first I've ever spent at Stanford, and
the unfavorable experience has nagged
at me ever since.
Busy with academic obligations
through the close of finals on Wednesday
of that week, I had hoped that the coming
days would afford me some last moments
with my departing friends. But my origi
nal plan to throw a party for my senior
comrades was dashed by the arrival of
their parents. Once Thursday and Friday
had disappeared from view, packing
loomed. I had to vacate my on-campus
housing by Monday, which, due to the
complications of borrowing a car, effec

lively meant Sunday morning.
Unable to arrange a group gathering
on Thursday or Friday, tied up in my
packing Saturday, and then dashing be
tween the concurrently-scheduled de
partmental ceremonies on Sunday, the
Commencement Weekend pipeline
made spending much time with my
friends a pipe dream.
Relatively speaking, I was lucky. 1 have
few belongings and only had to relocate
half a mile off campus. Other students
travel far from Stanford in the summer
— even farther if going abroad in the fall
— and must divide, pack and store ac
cordingly. Moreover, I stayed put the
final weeks of the year; others fly across
the country and back for the high school
and college graduations of friends and
siblings.
Seniors, who most deserve the week of
their lives, seem to be even worse off. For
them, all bags must be packed, all loose
ends tied up, all addresses changed and
all accounts closed. They must likewise
keep their visiting family occupied. When
I graduate next June — luck willing —
however will 1 include my friends in the
events?
As this past June was my first Com
mencement Weekend spent on campus, I
cannot say if the prevailing haste is a
perennial problem. But it seems likely.
Several friends of mine, for whom this
was not the first Stanford graduation,
shared my distaste for the rapid-fire final
week. They did not say that 2(X)5 was an
aberration.
I have spoken to other students who
profess to be unaware of or unfazed by
the commencement rush. Their
views cannot be discounted. In my
own anecdotal judgment, howev
er, the first group greatly outnum
bers the second.
Even if my assessment of grad
uation week is not complete,
though, I think we can all agree
that the menaces of stress and
chaos rear their heads around the
third week of each quarter and
are truly roaring by Dead Week.
These quarterly drives are at best
difficult by themselves; at worst,
they are rehearsals for the mad
dash of graduation.
And yet, it seems tedious to dis
cuss Commencement scheduling;
as I write this, more than a thou
sand individuals have been veri
fied dead, and hundreds of thou
sands wrenched from their
homes, by the ravages of Hurri
cane Katrina. And Houston, so re

cently a makeshift refuge, scurries
to excuse itself from the pending
wrath of Rita.
When a storm has destroyed
human and social existence else
where, do we have any right to
turn our attention inward?
I think we do. For (and I beg
forgiveness for making even this
judgment, coming as it does from
my vantage point of comfort), one
of the surpassing consequences of
Katrina has been the destruction
of meaningful patterns of living.
Families have been separated,
friendships killed, familiar places
drowned and pillaged.
If human connections can be so
instantly shredded anywhere,
then they ought to be honored
and preserved everywhere. What
matters to us, and why?
I don't imagine Stanford in
tends to create barriers to our en
joyment of Commencement
Weekend, but such is the effect of
the graduation hustle. Far from
feeling like a beginning. Com
mencement resembles a heaving
end, not just for many graduates,

but also for their underclass
friends who trail them at their
ceremonies — and this at a uni
versity that touts its "quality of
life."
Perhaps we could push our
move-out date to Tuesday or
Wednesday after Commence
ment. Perhaps department gradu
ations could be scattered across
the afternoon so students could
make the rounds.
The beginning of summer con
ferences would be delayed, of
course, and parents would Jiave to
catch later flights home on Sun
day evening. But these necessary
consequences seem to me a small
price to pay fora sane endgame.
For the sole reason of human con
nection, we can only hope that the
weeks of June — and the quarters
of the year — are a bit more
thoughtfully planned in the fu
ture.
