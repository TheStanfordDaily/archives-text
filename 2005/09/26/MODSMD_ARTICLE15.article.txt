## Why the June rush? 
### CHRISTOPHER R. VAUGHN 
Every other Wednesday of the
school year, students and faculty
gather in Memorial Church to lis
ten to a professor or public figure of
Stanford relate "What Matters to Me and
Why."The value of this exercise, it seems
to me, lies in its thoughtfulness. So far as
our habit is to hurry through, bounce be
tween or plainly ignore our thoughts, it is
useful at least to dwell on a few of them.
If these bi-weekly talks represent the
best of a threatened routine, then we
might stop to ponder a larger question. It
is of equal value and is equally able to es
cape our view: What matters to the Uni
versity and why?
I have often pondered this question
myself, but it came back to me especially
last Commencement Weekend in the
form of a troubling realization — the
sprint from finals week to graduation
threatens to snuff out the final moments
of quality time that students can spend
together at year's end.
Last Commencement Weekend was
the first I've ever spent at Stanford, and
the unfavorable experience has nagged
at me ever since.
Busy with academic obligations
through the close of finals on Wednesday
of that week, I had hoped that the coming
days would afford me some last moments
with my departing friends. But my origi
nal plan to throw a party for my senior
comrades was dashed by the arrival of
their parents. Once Thursday and Friday
had disappeared from view, packing
loomed. I had to vacate my on-campus
housing by Monday, which, due to the
complications of borrowing a car, effec

lively meant Sunday morning.
Unable to arrange a group gathering
on Thursday or Friday, tied up in my
packing Saturday, and then dashing be
tween the concurrently-scheduled de
partmental ceremonies on Sunday, the
Commencement Weekend pipeline
made spending much time with my
friends a pipe dream.
Relatively speaking, I was lucky. 1 have
few belongings and only had to relocate
half a mile off campus. Other students
travel far from Stanford in the summer
— even farther if going abroad in the fall
— and must divide, pack and store ac
cordingly. Moreover, I stayed put the
final weeks of the year; others fly across
the country and back for the high school
and college graduations of friends and
siblings.
Seniors, who most deserve the week of
their lives, seem to be even worse off. For
them, all bags must be packed, all loose
ends tied up, all addresses changed and
all accounts closed. They must likewise
keep their visiting family occupied. When
I graduate next June — luck willing —
however will 1 include my friends in the
events?
As this past June was my first Com
mencement Weekend spent on campus, I
cannot say if the prevailing haste is a
perennial problem. But it seems likely.
Several friends of mine, for whom this
was not the first Stanford graduation,
shared my distaste for the rapid-fire final
week. They did not say that 2(X)5 was an
aberration.
I have spoken to other students who
profess to be unaware of or unfazed by
