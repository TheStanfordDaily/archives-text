## A 						warning from experience: Graduate student version 
### 
You're new here; I can tell. You've not
developed the hardened look of bit
terness that comes after the first few
months of graduate school are over and the
last vestiges of hope die.
Now if that intro has you a little bemused,
not to worry. We all arrive laboring under
the impression that this will be a voyage of
discovery, a continued intellectual adven-

ture, an academic exploration, yadda,
yadda, yadda. Eventually, though, reality
hits, and it's a painful blow.
However, because I'm a cheerful, posi
tive sort of fellow. I'm not going to trouble
you with tales of how life will slowly break
apart around you. leaving nothing behind
but the tattered remnants of your dreams.
Instead, I'm going to warn you of a more
immediate danger.
Despite the University's prowess as a re
search establishment of the very highest
order, there is that one fateful flaw that
plagues Stanford: undergraduates.
I know, you thought that you had left that
sort of thing behind. You're all grown up

now, so what point is there in scurrying
young folk, with their oversized backpacks
and undersized clothing? Why must this
place of learning be contaminated by the
scholarly unfinished?
It's not as if they keep themselves to
themselves either. 1 don't know about you,
but when I was 18,1 didn't run around act
ing like my parents were paying for the
place.
Furthermore, the children are so unrea
sonable about everything. Just because
we're seven years older, have no common
interests and can occasionally appear a little
odd doesn't mean that younger folk should
n't be trying their hardest to be friends with
us.
We ought to be. after all. idols and not
pariahs. We stand at the pinnacle of the stu
dent mountain. If high school is cooler than
middle school, and if college is cooler than
high school, then surely grad students arc to
be looked up to.
However, with a seemingly total disre
gard for our desperate grasping at the rap
idly-receding days of youth, the undergrad
uates mock our neediness. Instead of bring
ing us into the fold, they laugh at our inabil
ity to have fun by ourselves.
What's worse is their pervasive disap
proval of such timeless and innocent activi
ties as staring inappropriately, turning up at
their parties uninvited and lurking suspi
ciously around their hangouts. And it's not a
silent disapproval either.
Literally everywhere you go, you will be
heckled. Cries of "Sketch!" will echo from

all directions. Stones will he thrown. So will
sticks. Bones will break.The words will hurt.
The barrage is relentless.
It's the last acceptable bigotry. Racism,
sexism and a myriad of other "isms" are
now rightly condemned by society, but dis
dain lor graduate students is not only toler
ated, it's expected and encouraged.
In fact, after some reflection it seems
clear to me that there is almost no group in
history that has had to suffer so â€” the
Huguenots had nothing on us.
As it has been through the ages, the per
secution is an invidious process. When you
lirst experience it.it seems merely a minor
annoyance, but eventually the accumulated
weight of scorn is crippling.
Of course, one's perfectly-justified para
noid sense of persecution is never taken se
riously. Instead everyone just accuses you of
having a paranoid sense of persecution.
Well, enough of that; I suppose now
you're probably looking for some advice.
You want to know how to deal with the kids,
how to instill in them an appropriate sense
of discipline and respect.
Sorry, can't help you with that. Some
times you just have face up to intolerance
with a stoic and resolute stance. Remember,
we live in an imperfect world, where igno
rance and discrimination run rife. Face your
tormentors with a smile and a prayer, and
maybe one day we'll live on a fairer planet.

evil? Well, I'll believe when / see it. E-mail
