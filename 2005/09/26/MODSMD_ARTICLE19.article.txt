## Confessions of a music snob 
### 
Ihave a confession to make. I
think I may have downloaded
Tatu's "All the Things She Said"
in the winter of 2002.
Wait, let's rewind. I've been back
in Brooklyn for the past three weeks,
bumming around before heading to
Europe for the fall. So one night last
week, I finally got around to hooking
up my computer, which I had
shipped home from California. I
hadn't quite realized it, but I missed
my music. In the absence of my colle
giate collection, I'd been listening to
whatever was kicking around my
computer from high school. 1 was
shocked, then, to discover that I was
listening to garbage in high school.
Not even uppercase Garbage. Low
ercase. The worst kind.
Sure, there was some Billy Joel
and Tom Petty, but much of it was
crap. As I scrolled through Music
match Jukebox (I'm dating myself
even with that reference), I struggled
to remember what possessed me to
download some of these tracks. Vita
min C? I was probably battling a
bout of ill-advised post-graduation
depression. And what the hell is I
Am the World Trade Center? Some
electronica/jazz fusion band I found
while searching Kazaa for music re
lating to my life's problems. Seven
different songs with "Allison" in the
title? Elvis Costello would be
ashamed.
I'm embarrassed by my underde

veloped, adolescent musical taste of
yesteryear. But as I pour over my old
playlists. I'm starting to suspect that
my palette today may be too refined
for its own good. Take, for example,
my sister Anne, now a freshman in
Junipero. We made a deal. She
bought a Strokes album, and I
bought one by Welcome to Florida.
Who, you ask, is Welcome to Flori
da? Imagine if Jack Johnson and
Pepper had a few tone-deaf chil
dren, fed them lead paint chips and
then ordered them to sing. Sure,
Helen Keller could pick out a better
record than my sister — and I take
every opportunity to note it — but
has my snobbery made me enjoy
music any more than in high school?
I'm not sure.
Lately, it seems like I'm looking
not fora good sound, but the "right"
sound - the kind of music you need a
brown corduroy jacket and ironic
shoes to enjoy (both of which I inci
dentally own). If moods influenced
my music taste in high school, maybe
my music has been influencing my
moods in college.
In high school, 1 listened to The
Beatles's "Here Comes the Sun" at
first light during an all-nighter. But
play "Boys Don't Cry" by The Cure
and I'm transported back to my
room in Toyon Hall, watching the
sunrise through a Red Bull-induced
haze. What the hell does that song
have to do with that moment? Not

much. 1 merely went through a Cure
phase during one finals week, which
probably owed to the fact that a
"Cure phase" seemed like a college
prerequisite.
This isn't a great example, be
cause I love that Beatles song and
still enjoy it, but the question it rais
es remains: In my drive to listen to
"better" music, did I forget why I lis
ten to music in the first place? Yes,
"Graduation" by Vitamin C is senti
mental tacky sludge, but there was a
reason I spent 30 minutes download
ing it on my 56k modem, and it had
nothing to do with elbow patches or
aviator glasses.
It is with this on my mind that I
travel to Berlin this fall. The Ger
mans have never been known for
their musical stylings, so perhaps
some unassuming European pop
will be the sorbet that wipes clean
my cluttered palette. I'll be sure to
keep all of my readers abreast of my
trials and tribulations, both music-re
lated and otherwise.
Oh yeah, and I plan to be drunk
for weeks at a time, so if I'm not
sending back Shakespeare, I hope
you'll understand.
