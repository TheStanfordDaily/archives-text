## SPOT gives taste of California Students take trips to wilderness, Bay Area 
### ZEWDE YERASWORK STAFF WRITER 
"There are probably only a couple
of people on campus that I know as
well as my fellow spotters, and those
relationships took months to build,?
said sophomore Gregory Lee upon
returning from his second experience
with the Stanford Fre-Orientation
Trips (SPOT) as a participant in 2004
and as a student leader in 2005. ?That's
the real strength of this program —
you get to know people in depth in a
very short time."
This year SPOT trips were offered
in two different, yet equally challeng
ing environments — wilderness back
packing in the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains and community service projects.
Lasting five days each, led by two
to three trip leaders and consisting of
groups of six to 10 new students, the
program aims to offer challenging ex
periences for students in preparation
for college life.
SPOT has been offered by the
Freshmen Dean's Office as a comple
ment to the New Student Orientation
program since 2004.This year, the pro
gram collaborated with the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service to develop the
community service trips.
Graduate students Sarah Rubin
feld and Geremy Heitz coordinated
the seven wilderness trips.
"As coordinators our roles vary
with the season." Rubinfeld said. "In
the spring, we begin to plan the trips
and put together the brochures and
mailings that are sent out to the new
students. Over the summer, we receive
and process all of the applications and
correspond with the selected partici
pants to prepare them for their trips."
Coordinators are responsible for
planning, organizing and gathering
necessary equipment for the wilder
ness programs.
The SPOT trip leaders, in charge of
providing information and support to
participants, are all current Stanford
students or recent graduates, and
some were SPOT participants them
selves. All of the SPOT trip leaders re
turned to campus early in the fall to
finish their training and plan for their
trips.
According to Rubinfeld. due to the
small group size and intensity of the
experience, SPOT also gave the par
ticipants a "taste of California" and
the many opportunities surrounding
Stanford.
"When Sarah Shulman. co
founder of SPOT, graduated and
moved on to a full-time job, I stepped
in as the second coordinator," Ileitz
said. "Though 1 sorely miss being a
leader and actually going on the trip,
this side of the program has been a
great experience for me in terms of
teaching and learning to organize and
mobilize groups of people."
Heitz added that the goal of the
trips is to strengthen personal rela
tionships among students, to provide
a challenging experience to incoming
students and to provide "the opportu
nity to develop leadership skills in a
way that's different from many of
their activities."
A freshman from Weston. Mass.,
Rhianon Liu said she "absolutely
loved" participating in one of this
year's wilderness trips, despite not
being particularly fond of the out
doors.

While the elimination of distrac
tions and the ability to share anxieties
and expectations of college life are es
sential to the aims of the program,
many participants are glad to have
simply found the opportunity to
make new friends.
Among the many qualities she saw
in her fellow trip members, Liu said
"they all just have amazing stories to
tell that you would never guess from
their down-to-earth attitudes."
The recent success of the SPOT
program has spawned the possibility
of further expansion.
"I liked being with only East
Coast people; it gave us something in
common to strengthen our bonds,"
said freshman Joachim de Lombaert
from Madison, Conn. "If they do
open it to all freshmen, it might be
nice to keep the groups separate by
large geographical regions."
While the focus will continue to be
on students from the East Coast,
those farthest from home at Stanford,
Rubinfeld said, "Everyone involved
with SPOT is committed to expand
ing the geographic area served until
the program is available to all incom
ing Stanford students."
