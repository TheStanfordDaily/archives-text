### ZEWDE YERASWORK STAFF WRITER 
"There are probably only a couple
of people on campus that I know as
well as my fellow spotters, and those
relationships took months to build,?
said sophomore Gregory Lee upon
returning from his second experience
with the Stanford Fre-Orientation
Trips (SPOT) as a participant in 2004
and as a student leader in 2005. ?That's
the real strength of this program —
you get to know people in depth in a
very short time."
This year SPOT trips were offered
in two different, yet equally challeng
ing environments — wilderness back
packing in the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains and community service projects.
Lasting five days each, led by two
to three trip leaders and consisting of
groups of six to 10 new students, the
program aims to offer challenging ex
periences for students in preparation
for college life.
SPOT has been offered by the
Freshmen Dean's Office as a comple
ment to the New Student Orientation
program since 2004.This year, the pro
gram collaborated with the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service to develop the
community service trips.
Graduate students Sarah Rubin
feld and Geremy Heitz coordinated
the seven wilderness trips.
"As coordinators our roles vary
with the season." Rubinfeld said. "In
the spring, we begin to plan the trips
and put together the brochures and
mailings that are sent out to the new
students. Over the summer, we receive
and process all of the applications and
correspond with the selected partici
pants to prepare them for their trips."
Coordinators are responsible for
planning, organizing and gathering
necessary equipment for the wilder
ness programs.
The SPOT trip leaders, in charge of
providing information and support to
participants, are all current Stanford
students or recent graduates, and
some were SPOT participants them
selves. All of the SPOT trip leaders re
turned to campus early in the fall to
finish their training and plan for their
trips.
According to Rubinfeld. due to the
small group size and intensity of the
experience, SPOT also gave the par
ticipants a "taste of California" and
the many opportunities surrounding
