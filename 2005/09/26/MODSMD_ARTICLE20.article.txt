## Go Robber Barons How the Card got its color 
### 
Freshmen, I know what you're thinking.
We were all thinking it too at one
point. Our mascot is ... a color?
Yeah, it kind of looks like blood, but it's not
a name that exactly inspires opposing defen
sive backs to quake in their cleats either. If
friends and relatives are scratching their
heads about why you are going to a school
that has a color as its mascot, or if your grand
mother stitched you a quilt with a big Cardi-

nal bird in the middle, then you can tell them
this story, and tell it with pride.
The short version: We call ourselves the
Cardinal because we were about a third of a
century ahead of our time.
The long version: Stanford sports teams
were called the Indians from 1930 to 1970, the
logo being a caricature of a small Indian with
a big nose. In 1970, a group of Native Ameri
can students raised objections to dance per
formances before sporting events by a guy
who called himself Prince Lightfoot.
In 1972, a group of about 50 Native Amer
ican students and staff convinced then-Uni
versity President Richard Lyman to remove
the logo, rightly calling it "stereotypical, of
fensive and a mockery of Indian cultures."
They held that an entire race cannot be used
as entertainment.
Lyman agreed to remove the mascot in the
sympathetic, progressive spirit of the Univer
sity — or because he was hearing about stu
dent protests up the bay in Berkeley and
wanted no part of it. In any case, it would
prove to be an enlightened move on Stan
ford's part — the NCAA recently instituted a
policy to ban 18 schools from using nick
names that referenced race beginning in 2006,
but only in NCAA Championship competi
tion. (Hey, Florida State can't be expected to
ship all that Seminole merchandise to Third
World countries, can it?) Fourteen of the 18
schools that fell under the sanctions have
agreed to change their mascots.
As a side-note, Notre Dame was allowed
to keep its mascot, a Fightin' Irishman. Ap
parently Irishmen don't object to being
stereotyped as drunk, fighting bastards. (It's
okay, I can say it. I'm Irish.)
Back to the Farm: The students were al
lowed to vote on the new mascot and chose
Robber Barons, based on how they say Le
land Stanford made his money. That was still
too politically incorrect for the administra
tion, which instead scoured the globe for the
least potentially offensive nickname it could
find, and landed on ... you guessed it: the
color Cardinal. ("Crimson" and "Big Red"
were already taken. And blue, everyone
agreed, would just look silly.)
That, of course, brought on another issue:
How do you represent a color when choosing
a mascot? The student body allegedly reject
ed the idea of letting a guy run up and down
the sidelines with a 5 inch-by-5 inch Cardinal
colored card. Then, a group of students
(namely, the Stanford Band) turned their
backs on the administration's choice, rejected
the stilted convention that a mascot has to
have something, anything, to do with the
school's actual nickname. Also rejected was
the notion that the mascot had to be animate.
Thus was born the Tree, the result of a
tongue-in-cheek halftime show by the Band.
If you haven't seen the band, you should
know that it can hardly be called a marching
band. If you have ever been to a USC game,
you will know that's a good thing. Members
run onto the field in scatter formation and
usually present a skit of some sort. In recent
years, this format has gotten them banned
from Notre Dame, after they imitated the
Irish Potato Famine, as well as BYU, after
they imitated Mormons by performing a
ceremony in which five Dollies all dressed
up as brides and married one of the band
members.
Because the band is not sanctioned by the
University, there are no official statistics on
exactly how many places it is not allowed to
go. But word is the band was forbidden from
riding on several major airlines after band
members tried to make a plane do a barrel
roll by running from side to side, all at once.
There is also a rumor that the band is not al
lowed to enter the People's Republic of
China and is also barred from (nearly?)
every hotel in Los Angeles.
The Tree, for its part, is known to dance
around wildly while the band play and is the
all-but-official mascot so you can go ahead
and tell grandma to use it to replace that
silly-looking bird on your quilt. If for some
crazy reason you want to actually be the
TYee, ehow.com has a great 13-step guide
that focuses mainly on the use of duct tape.
So if sometime during Orientation you
saw spaceships, a guy with a prosthetic penis


Sean
Howell
and / or naked, paint-clad women
(you're guaranteed to have run into
at least two of the three), you can
blame Richard Lyman — or send
him your thanks.
But even if the moniker Cardi
nal leaves a little something to he
desired, rejoice that you're cheer
ing on a real mascot, instead of a
horse that isn't really from Troy or a
bear named Oski whose lameness
has to be seen to be believed — for
starters, he wears a sweater. Or start
a petition in support of "Robber
Barons."
