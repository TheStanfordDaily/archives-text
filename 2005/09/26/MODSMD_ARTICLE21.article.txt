# Women sweep both LA schools
## Junior middle blocker Suiter returns from injury, records eight blocks 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
It would have made sense for the Stanford women's
volleyball team to be nervous when it kicked off confer
ence play against two perennial powerhouses with three
starting freshmen on the floor. That was not the case in
Maples Pavilion this past weekend as the defending na
tional champions played like seasoned veterans and
notched a pair of important home wins in front of a large
and supportive home crowd.
Despite facing tough competition. No. 3 Stanford got
the Pacific-10 Conference season started on the right
foot, rolling to straight-game victories over traditional
conference rivals No. 12 Southern California and No. 13
UCLA. Freshman outside hitter Cynthia Barboza led
the charge for Stanford, setting a new career high in kills
on Friday and nearly matching it Saturday.
"I thought we played marvelous defense both days,"
head coach John Dunning said. "I also thought we
served well and that really helped us. Cynthia in particu
lar did a great job on Friday, and both Cynthia and [jun
ior outside hitter] Kristin [Richards] did well on Satur
day."
Barboza, the two-time Gatorade High School Volley
ball Player of the Year, came into the Stanford program
as the top-ranked recruit of her class. Her performance
Friday left no question that she is the newest in a long
line of elite outside hitters at Stanford.
In a spot vacated by last year's star Ogonna Nna
mani, Barboza tallied 26 kills and hit .511 in three
games against USC, producing nearly a third of Stan
ford's points that night. Against UCLA, Barboza once
again broke the 20-kill barrier, posting 21 while hitting
.279. The Stanford outside hitter tandem of Barboza
and Richards dominated the match, with Richards
chipping in 19 kills. In the third game alone, the two
combined for 15 kills, only one fewer than the entire
UCLA squad could muster.
Stanford's defense controlled both matches. In the
first game against USC, the Cardinal recorded 32 digs.
Richards chipped in 16 digs to lead the defense on Sat
urday, including the I,oooth of her career, putting her in
a select group of players who have reached the 1,000
mark in both digs and kills. Senior libero Courtney
Schultz finished with 13 and 14 digs in the two matches.
Schultz and fellow senior Katie Goldhahn have taken on
central leadership roles as veteran role models to Stan
ford's young roster.
"I think it is a big honor to be out there with the
team and be looked at as a lead figure for them," Gold
hahn said."But when I'm on the court, I'm not thinking
about that. I'm just having fun with my teammates, try
ing to direct them or help them in any way I can on the
court, whether just having fun, being loud and vocal or
helping them with shots or information on other
teams."
Freshman Foluke Akinradewo, already voted MVP of
two tournaments this season, had a relatively quiet week
end, tallying eight kills against USC and 10 against
UCLA. In her return to the starting lineup after a severe
ankle sprain several weeks ago, junior middle blocker
Lizzie Suiter was a force at the net, contributing eight
