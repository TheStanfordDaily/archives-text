### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Not only did the Cardinal host the
Stanford Invitational Saturday, hut they
also dominated it.The Cardinal swept all
four collegiate races and finished in first
place in three of the four competitions.
In the women's 4,000-meter short
course, junior Amanda Trotter was first
to cross the finish line, with a time of
14:03. The Cardinal had a group of cross
country runners, as well as some track
and field athletes, run in the shorter dis
tance race.
"Amanda ran with a bunch of other
Stanford runners for quite a while," head
coach PeterTegen said."Amanda, [soph
omores] Lauren Centrowitz and Lindsay
Allen and [freshman] Alicia Follmar
worked quite well as a group."
Sophomore Shannon Bergstedt also
ran in that group and Tegen was especial
ly impressed with her performance.
"I was very happy to see Shannon
come back after a long break because of
injuries in the past," Tegen said. "She is
making great progress. I'm not always
jumping up and down about the ones
who win â€” the ones who get my atten
tion often are in the middle but have
shown exciting progress."
The Cardinal women won the 4,000-
meter race with 23 points, ahead of
Canadian university Simon Fraser,
which tallied 79 points.
In the women's 6,000-meter race, the
Cardinal won with 31 points, far ahead of
second-place Chico State, which scored
136 points. In a one-two finish, sopho
more Arianna Lambie and junior Katy
TVotter beat out their competition. Lam
bie ran the 6,000 meters in 21:15, while
TYotter finished in 21:19. Tegen had only
good things to say about the perform
ance from one of his All Americans, call
ing Lambie an "ambitious young lady,"
much like her teammates.
Because the Cardinal only had five

runners in the 6,000-meter race, all five
were in scoring position.The added pres
sure worked to ihe Cardinal's favor,
though, as all five scored within the top

12 overall.
"We had talked about some ways to
make things happen and they just
reigned together and worked as a group

in a wonderful way," Tegcn said. "Be
cause there were only five, no one could
have a had day because then we wouldn't
have appeared on the results. But they
worked nicely together, measured their
energy, distributed their energy through
out the race and had a great race."
The men won the 4,000-meter compe
tition in another exciting one-two finish.
Redshirt sophomore Russell Brown won
the race in 11:59, followed closely by red
shirt freshman Hakon DcVries with a
time of 12:01.
Tegen considered how to distribute
the Cardinal's talent evenly when deter
mining whom to place in the shorter and
longer races. He decided Brown would
do well in the shorter race.
"Russell very much likes the shorter
distances,"Tegen said. "We just needed a
few strong, energetic individuals in the
4k and it worked out well."
The Cardinal tallied 23 points, and all
five runners finished within the top nine
overall. Second place A/usa Pacific
racked up 72 points.
The men also won the 8,000-meter
race with 50 points to Chico State's ftft.
Sophomore Garrett I leath was the Car
dinal's top finisher, coming in third with
a time of 23:48. Senior Brett Ootcher was
close behind in fifth place with a time of
23:52.
The results of the Stanford Invite are
evidence that Tegen's training strategy is
working well for the Cardinal thus far.
Tegen is new to the Farm this year and
has the Cardinal cross-country squad
working on all aspects of the race.
"High level training and racing in
cludes a measured approach in the be
ginning of the season,"Tegen said."|That
means] we're not going gang busters and
watching for injuries. It doesn't help to
have a super team and end up with half
the team injured in the second half ol the
season.
