# Stanford women plan for motherhood
## 
### H. WELLS WULSIN STAFF WRITER 
Women at elite universities like Stanford,
groomed for leadership positions in the most com
petitive fields, sometimes decide that parenting re
sponsibilities should take precedence over the
climb up the career ladder.
In a recent New York Times survey of 138 fe
male undergraduates at Yale, 60 percent said they
planned to scale back their work or stop working
completely when they have children. About half
wanted to work part time, and about half wanted to
stop work for at least a few years. The author of the
study suggested that some high-achieving young
women today feel that parenting is a more accept
able life goal.
Cynthia Russett.a professor of American histo
ry at Yale, said she was stunned when she heard the
results of the survey.
"My reaction was one of tremendous dismay,"
she told The Daily. "I thought the battles of aspira
tion had been fought. This signaled to me that
mothers were telling their daughters that if you
want to be a good mother, you can't have a high
powered career. Full-time motherhood is wonder
ful if that's what you want, but not if you're forced
into it."
Still, Russett said she is not convinced that a
trend in women planning to spend more time with
children really exists.
"I would like to see some more sccure sense of
what's going on, and we don't really have that yet,"
she explained. "If anything is clear, it's that we have
not made as many strides toward making things
equal as we hoped to do way back when the femi
nist movement was beginning."
Cindy Pearson, director of alumni programs,
said that the Stanford Alumni Association does not
collect statistics on the percentage of its graduates
who take time off from work to raise children.

I lowever, Laura Harrison, assistant dean and di
rector of the Women's Center, said that in campus
wide needs assessments, graduate and undergradu
ate women consistently rank work-family concerns
as one of the top five most important issues.
"I wasn't surprised by the result, but I thought it
was interesting that even young undergraduates
were anticipating making these difficult decisions."
I larrison said.
Junior Sonia Nagala, who was raised by two full
time doctors, already recognizes that her future
parental responsibilities may interfere with her ca
reer goals.
"My mom was a super mom and 1 think it's great
if you can do that, but 1 need less stress, less pres
sure," she said. "I came in to Stanford thinking that
career came first, but I've changed my mode of
thinking. I want to have a career that will let me
have a family in my late 20s — that's why I'm not
thinking so much about medicine anymore."
Alda Balthrop-Lewis, a senior majoring in Reli
gious Studies, also expects to devote time to her fu
ture children.
"If I have children, it means committing to
spend as much time as I economically can caring for
them." she said. "When they are really young. I
don't want to work at all because I think nursing is
really important."
Not surprisingly, however, many Stanford
women anticipate that they will be able to balance
both an ambitious career and a family life.
"I think I'd try to juggle both work and kids,"
said LinhTran, a sophomore majoring in human bi
ology."! definitely want it to be equal with my hus
band. My parents both worked similar hours, so
they both were home around the same time."
Laura Faulkner, a junior majoring in political
science, said that while she expects to continue
working while raising children, she recognizes the
disadvantages of working too many hours.
"Some of my friends had both parents who

worked, and some missed having them around,"
she said. "That's something to keep in mind."
According to Harrison, managing work and
family is not a question for just women to consider
anymore.
"I hear more about men who want to he home
for their children," she said. "I don't know that it's
so much out of a commitment to feminism, but just
a desire to be with their kids as they're growing up.
Why would you want to miss out on that?"
Philip Henry, a senior majoring in economics,
said he plans to take some time off from his work
along with his wife when the time comes.
"I think kids and family always have the highest
priority," he said."ln a situation where it's family or
job. there's no decision to be made — you have to
choose the family."
Yingyong "Jef'Tanthanapongphan, a first-year
law student, also predicts that he will take some
time off from his career to raise his children.
"I think that I have to divide parenting equally
with my wife," he said."l have to support my fami
ly first and let work come later. In Thailand we have
a tradition that men have to do everything with
their wife, so I'm willing to work part-time to raise
my child at his or her young age."
Harrison said that the difficulties of full-time
work and parenting are now more widely recog
nized.
"The super woman thing from the l X)s is gone,"
she said. "Both women and men are recognizing
that the hours involved in raising kids and working
full-time maybe don't add up to a sane life for
everyone. I get the sense that people are finding
more creative solutions than just women staying at
home — there's paternity leave, family-friendlier
workplaces, flex time — small steps that are by no
means mainstream yet, but still indicative of an ac
knowledgement that the have-it all model may not
work for everyone."

along with his wife when the time comes.
"I think kids and family always have the highest
priority," he said."ln a situation where it's family or
job. there's no decision to be made — you have to
choose the family."
Yingyong "Jef'Tanthanapongphan, a first-year
law student, also predicts that he will take some
time off from his career to raise his children.
"I think that I have to divide parenting equally
with my wife," he said."l have to support my fami
ly first and let work come later. In Thailand we have
a tradition that men have to do everything with
their wife, so I'm willing to work part-time to raise
my child at his or her young age."
Harrison said that the difficulties of full-time
work and parenting are now more widely recog
nized.
"The super woman thing from the l X)s is gone,"
she said. "Both women and men are recognizing
that the hours involved in raising kids and working
full-time maybe don't add up to a sane life for
everyone. I get the sense that people are finding
more creative solutions than just women staying at
home — there's paternity leave, family-friendlier
workplaces, flex time — small steps that are by no
means mainstream yet, but still indicative of an ac
knowledgement that the have-it all model may not
work for everyone."
