# Harbury named 'genius'
## 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford added another genius to its rosters last
Tuesday, namely Pehr Harbury. The associate profes
sor of biochemistry was just named one of this year's
25 recipients of the $500,000 Mac Arthur Fellowship,
often referred to as the "genius" grant.
ITie award's main criteria are "extraordinary orig
inality and dedication in creative pursuits" according
to Mac Arthur's Web site. It is not restricted by field,
and in the past has been awarded to writers, filmmak
ers, poets and social scientists as well as those in the
natural sciences.
The nomination process is highly secret, with
around 100 nominators feeding names to a selection
committee of about a dozen. Everyone in the process
serves anonymously, so as not to bias the results.
"Everyone around the office was really excited,"
Harbury said. "The Chemistry Department is like a
family."
According to Harbury, the grant was most likely
awarded for his work on DNA display.
"It's a way to apply test-tube evolution to synthet
ic combinatory chemistry' libraries, the most obvious
application of which is for drug discovery," he said.
"We've struggled terribly with funding over the past
few years and a lot of people were aware of the work
and were aware of the problems with funding."
Harbury began researching the topic while com
pleting his graduate thesis at Harvard.
"1 tried to predict how an amino acid sequence
would fold up into a three-dimensional fold," he said.
"The specific aspect of the problem 1 was working on
was trying to engineer new sequences that would fold
up into shapes that didn't exist in nature."
After graduate school, Harbury, a native of the
Bay Area, completed his post-doctoral studies at UC-
Berkeley and arrived at Stanford seven years ago.
The head of the Biochemistry Department,
Suzanne Pfeffer praises Harbury's work and accom
plishments.
"Everyone's delighted; there's no one I can think
of who is more deserving," she said. "Pehr is incredi
bly smart, very creative and he's a wonderful citizen
and a really dedicated teacher. He still works in a lab
among his students and post-docs, that's fairly unusu
al in this stage of his career, but it's a part of his suc
cess."
Graduate student Jarret Wrenn, a member of Har
bury's lab, also commended his work ethic.
"His research is striking; it's very different from
any other professor that I've talked to," Wrenn said.
"He had three or four very big high-level projects
that were very cool and out there."
Rebecca Weisinger, another one of Harbury's
graduate students, agreed.

"He's very enthusiastic about everyone's projects
and has great ideas," she said. "He's good at encour
aging everyone to keep plowing ahead with their
project at every stage. When you run into different
problems he's really interested in coming up with
new ways to solve the problem".
The award, paid out over five years, comes with no
expectations.
According to Mac Arthur's Web site, "The Foun
dation does not require or expect specific products or
reports from Mac Arthur Fellows, and does not eval
uate recipients' creativity during the term of the fel
lowship .The Mac Arthur Fellowship is a 'no strings at
tached' award in support of people, not projects."
Harbury said he will probably put his award
money in an unrestricted fund at Stanford to support
the research in his lab.
"Since it doesn't have a timed finish line on it, I can
save it for future rainy days," he said.
Harbury brings the number of Stanford professors
who have been named Mac Arthur fellows up to 23.
