# Stanford ranked No. 5 by U.S. News
## 
### ROHAN KHARA STAFF WRITER 
U.S. News and World Report
has rated Stanford University as
the fifth top school in the nation, a
position it shares with Duke Uni
versity. The University has been
holding steady in the position for
several years, with the top spots
this year going to Harvard and
Princeton, respectively.
Many Stanford students, how
ever, are not worried about the
University's place in the rankings.
"It will make no difference to
me whether we are at No. 5 or No.
2, Stanford is and will always be
outstanding," said Rebecca Duf
fet, a sophomore transfer student
from Oregon who plans to major
in English.
Freshman Ilya Arbatman
agreed that rankings do not al
ways give the complete picture of
a school.
"If the college is in the top 10,
it does not matter," he said. "Al
though the rankings are an impor
tant reference tool, they are not
the end all and say all about the
universities. 1 would not make my
decision based on just the rank
ings."
Robin Maleche, a senior ma
joring in electrical engineering,
concurred.
"Such rankings keep on fluctu

ating and as long as it remains in
the top 10, it actually does not
matter," she said. "Most of the
rankings are skewed and do not
provide a complete representa
tion. If I were to base my decision
on the rankings alone, then I
would look at a decade's rankings
about universities and then de
cide."
Some students, however,
vouched for the rankings' credi
bility.
"These rankings hold a lot of
value for international students
who do not get a chance to visit
the campus and talk to faculty,"
said Kushal Shah, a prospective
student from India. "For me these
rankings serve as a mouthpiece of
the universities in the United
States. When we are spending so
much money for our education,
we might as well go to the best col
leges and most of my friends rely
on these rankings for deciding
upon the universities."
But, freshman Paul Ricketts
said that the rankings do not do
justice to Stanford's atmosphere.
"This place is really cool and al
though I have been here for only a
few days I think it was the right de
cision to come to this university,"
he said. "It is a truly the No. 1 uni
versity for happiest students. I will
always recommend all the new
students to apply to Stanford."
