Stem-cell grant encourages Stanford research
in regenerative medicine
On Sept. 9, Stanford School of Medicine was
granted funding for training in stem cell re
search by the California Institute of Regenera
tive Medicine. The $3.7 million grant provides
support for 16 potential graduate and post
graduate scientists to train in adult and embry
onic stem-cell research, in addition to nine sci
entists who have already been awarded funding
through the National Institutes of Health. The
25 Stanford scientists will seek guidance from
faculty members knowledgeable in a variety of
fields such as ethics and law. I lowever, the time
frame for when the funding will reach the insti
tution remains a major obstacle for the aspiring
scientists. Meanwhile, a weekly seminar will be
held for students and faculty members who are

interested in regenerative medicine. The first
meeting will be located in the Clark Center on
Oct. 6 at 4 p.m.
International Studies Renamed
The Stanford Institute for International Stud
ies was renamed the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies at Stanford (FSI) on Sept. 1.
The $50 million funding, provided by Stanford
alumni Bradford Freeman and Ronald Spogli,
supports the program and the University's multi
disciplinary International Initiative. To increase
the university's role in the world, the initiative en
compasses global obstacles in humanity, govern
ment and international security. During the sum
mer quarter, FSI promoted new programs encour
aging educational and democratic reform in de
veloping countries.
