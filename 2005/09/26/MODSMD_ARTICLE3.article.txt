Senior Katie Swanson passed away in her
sleep Tuesday night due to unknown causes. A
transfer to Stanford from Princeton after her
sophomore year, Swanson was an alumna of
Menlo High School, known for her ease in
making friends.
"She had the presence to walk into a room
and talk to anyone," said junior Casey McDon
ald, Swanson s roommate last year. "She had a
smile that she just radiated."
McDonald, Swanson and senior Sophie

Gassee shared a triple in
Kimball I lall during their jun
ior year. Gasee spoke at
Swanson's memorial service
and recalled the first time
they met.
"At first, I was intimidated
by her beauty, intelligence,
outgoing nature, confidence
and strong sense of self,"
Gassee said."But underneath

this perfect exterior, 1 found much more. 1
found a genuine, loving, caring and compas
sionate soul."

Swanson, a sociology major, spent the sum
mer doing research on campus. As a member of
the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, she served on
the Intersorority Council, and also worked as a
tour guide. She hoped to one day become a
professor.
"I believe that Katie was the most extraor
dinary person that I have ever met," said Swan
son's boyfriend Bobby Fraser, class of 2005.
"After a tragedy like this, it can be easy to
throw around superlatives, but in Katies case,
no compliment could be an exaggeration. She
was simply incredible."
McDonald described Swanson as extremely

dedicated and driven, hut also very thoughtful
and generous.
"She was one of those people who was hap
piest when she was making other people
happy," McDonald said.
Gassee also said that Swanson was con
stantly thinking of others, once staying up all
night working on posters for her younger sis
ter's student body election. In fact, Swanson
would regularly leave bags of candy on
Gassee's desk if she had a tough day.
"Katie was exceptionally generous with her
