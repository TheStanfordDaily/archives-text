### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senior Katie Swanson passed away in her
sleep Tuesday night due to unknown causes. A
transfer to Stanford from Princeton after her
sophomore year, Swanson was an alumna of
Menlo High School, known for her ease in
making friends.
"She had the presence to walk into a room
and talk to anyone," said junior Casey McDon
ald, Swanson s roommate last year. "She had a
smile that she just radiated."
McDonald, Swanson and senior Sophie

Gassee shared a triple in
Kimball I lall during their jun
ior year. Gasee spoke at
Swanson's memorial service
and recalled the first time
they met.
"At first, I was intimidated
by her beauty, intelligence,
outgoing nature, confidence
and strong sense of self,"
Gassee said."But underneath

this perfect exterior, 1 found much more. 1
found a genuine, loving, caring and compas
sionate soul."

Swanson, a sociology major, spent the sum
mer doing research on campus. As a member of
the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, she served on
the Intersorority Council, and also worked as a
tour guide. She hoped to one day become a
professor.
"I believe that Katie was the most extraor
dinary person that I have ever met," said Swan
son's boyfriend Bobby Fraser, class of 2005.
"After a tragedy like this, it can be easy to
throw around superlatives, but in Katies case,
no compliment could be an exaggeration. She
was simply incredible."
McDonald described Swanson as extremely

dedicated and driven, hut also very thoughtful
and generous.
"She was one of those people who was hap
piest when she was making other people
happy," McDonald said.
Gassee also said that Swanson was con
stantly thinking of others, once staying up all
night working on posters for her younger sis
ter's student body election. In fact, Swanson
would regularly leave bags of candy on
Gassee's desk if she had a tough day.
"Katie was exceptionally generous with her

time, her money, her advice and her
comfort," said Fraser. "In the past
year, Katie gave more presents,
wrote more cards, sent more text
messages and made more phone
calls that made people happy than
many people will in an entire life
time."
McDonald, who was abroad this
past summer in London during the
July subway bombings, said that
Swanson was the first to call her

family and make sure that every
thing was all right.
"She cared about her close
friends in a way that no one else
could," Gassee said.
Gassee also transferred to Stan
ford for her junior year, but she and
Katie quickly became best friends.
During her speech at the memorial
service, she explained the bond's sig
nificance.
"I always thought that if some
thing terrible were to happen in my
life. I could at least turn to Katie for
her support, wisdom and strength,"
Gassee said. "She would know what
to say, what to do and how to get me
through it. And now, when the worst

of things has happened, the one per
son 1 need most is no longer here."
Swanson was originally from
Hillsborough. Calif., where she lived
with her mother and younger sister:
her father died when she was young.
Gassee said that Swanson was al
ways very dedicated to her family
and tried to make her father proud
of everything that she did.
"Katie has touched, loved and
been loved by more than a lifetime's
worth of people. And for that, she
will never be forgotten." Gassee
said.
A service will be held in Memor
ial Church on Oct. 20 in Swanson's
memory.
