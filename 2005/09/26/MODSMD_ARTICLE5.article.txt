# Construction abounds on campus
## 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students should consider investing in
a hardhat based on the number of construction
projects happening on campus this year. In addi
tion to a renovation project re-creating a new Old
Union, the University is adding graduate housing,
a fitness center and additional science and engi
neering facilities to its already expansive campus.
"The University has undergone a lot of
changes since I first arrived as a freshman in 1994
and it continues to evolve," said Graduate Stu
dent Council Co-Chair Tom Lee, a fourth-year
electrical engineering graduate student. "In 11

years here, I don't think there's ever been a time
when something wasn't being built or renovat
ed."
Old Union Renovation
The historic building,constructed from 1909 to
1922, is being renovated into a more traditional
student union which will house a new multi-faith
center as well as the offices of the ASSU.
"The Old Union project is currently com
pleting the early phases of design and is estimat
ed to complete construction in late 2006," said
Jack Geary, director of project management at
Stanford.
Geary explained that over the summer the Of-

fice of Undergraduate Admission and Financial
Aid Office moved to permanent locations in the
newly-renovated Bakewell Building. Student Fi
nancial Services, Housing Assignment Services,
Residential Education and the Registrar's Office
will he moved to new modulars next to theToyon
Eating Clubs at the intersection of Arguello Way
and Serra Street later this year. In addition, stu
dent activity programs will be moved to tempo
rary modulars located in the parking lot next to
the Black Community Service Center. Religious
organizations housed in the Old Union Club
house will also move temporarily to Building 60,
the current home of the Archeology
and Scheduling Departments.
Once renovations are completed,
all groups will move back into the
building. The ASSU office will be re
located from Tresidder Memorial
Union to the first floor of Old
Union.
"Since most of our services are
for student groups, this move makes
sense as we will be much more easi
ly accessible to them," said ASSU
President Melanie Kannokada, a
senior, who said she hopes the reno
vated Old Union will become a hub
of student activity. "Ideally, the new
location will also encourage stu
dents to stop in and find ways to get
involved within the ASSU."
Munger Graduate Residences
After receiving a $43.5 million
gift last year from Charles Munger,
the Vice Chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway and founder of the law
firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, and
his wife. Nancy, Stanford has been
making plans to use six acres of
University land behind the Law
School to provide housing to ap
proximately 500 graduate and pro
fessional students. The University
will also add a subterranean park
ing structure under Wilbur Field to
provide necessary parking spaces
to support the building.
"The Munger Graduate Resi
dences are progressing through the
design phase with construction
scheduled to start in mid-2006."
Cleary said. "The construction start
date is contingent on the County of
Santa Clara planning approvals ex
pected in December 2005. Later
this year and into 2006, site prepa
rations will begin for utility work;
relocation of the Owen, Drell,
Rogers. Mariposa and Serra hous
es; and excavation of the under
ground parking structure at Wilbur
Field."
During the summer, the resident
fellow's house at Casa Zapata was
rebuilt in preparation for construc
tion of the new graduate housing
project. Six student rooms in Casa
Zapata were used for the cottage.
"All the people involved were

consulted about the reconstruction
process, working directly with Pro
ject Manager Mark Bonino and his
staff," said Education Prof. Deanne
Perez-Granados, Resident Fellow at
Zapata. "I am very pleased with the
result — a very nice living space for
current and future resident fellows."
Several members of the commu
nity, including faculty, staff and stu
dents living in the surrounding area
were concerned with the effect the
residences will have on the Stanford
campus, including an increase in
traffic and the overpowering size of
the proposed buildings.
Arrillaga Family Recreation
Center
Directly across from the Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center is the
new two-story Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center developed by
donor John Arrillaga. The facility
will feature seven squash courts, a
4,000-square-foot multipurpose
room with wall-to-wall mats, a 24-
foot rock-climbing wall, three bas
ketball courts that can be trans
formed into volleyball and bad
minton courts, space for sports med
icine and tutoring services for stu
dents and a fitness center with a
weight room and workout machines.
The nearly 75,000-square-foot
recreation center is scheduled to
open on Oct. 3, according to Cleary
— right on schedule.
"Non-athletes have been want
ing more options to work out for
years now, so we are extremely glad
to see this need finally being ful
filled," Kannokada said. "Addition
ally, we imagine it will help the over
all wellness of students by providing
an outlet to de-stress.There is a lot of
potential for this space, and we will
want to ensure that students will
have a say in how it is used in the
years to come."
Returning students said they are
looking forward to the recreation
center opening in the near future.
"It looks absolutely gorgeous
from the outside, especially in the
evenings with how you can see in
side from Campus Drive," said Paul
Gurney, a fourth-year electrical en
gineering doctoral student. "I'm re
ally looking forward to using it and
seeing it from the inside next
month — I imagine it will be a real
ly popular place to play pick-up
basketball."

Science and Engineering Quad
(SEQ2)
"The new quad will house four
buildings, two of which are replace
ments for buildings which will be
torn down and two of which will
house new University-wide initia
tives," said Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering, in an inter
view last year. "These initiatives are
the Institute for the Environment
and the new Bioengineering De
partment."
Cleary said that site preparations
and utility work have begun on the
Environment and Energy Building,
the first structure in the new SEQ2.
The building is progressing through
the schematic design phase and is
scheduled for Board of Trustees de
sign approval in April 2006. The
project is proceeding on schedule
with construction on the Environ
ment and Energy Building slated to
start in June 2006.
"The SEQ2 project will be a great
thing for students," Lee said. "It will
replace some aging research buildings
and give students state-of-the-art fa
cilities to work in. It will also beautify
one of the least appealing parts of the
campus. There will be some inconven
iences fora while, but I think the end
product will be worth it."
Impact of Construct ion Projects
Cleary said he anticipates that
the large-scale construction projects
will "cause significant temporary
disruptions to the area around the
construction site."
"As part of the Department of
Project Management's project deliv
ery process, the impacts associated
with the construction of our build
ings on our community are carefully
considered," Cleary added. "Each
Stanford project manager works
with the contractors for their respec
tive projects during the design phase
to identify potential disruptions dur
ing construction and to develop mit
igation measures that reduce their
impact to the general region, neigh
boring building occupants, pedestri
an and bike access and service and
deliveries."

projects in design and construction

Project Management's Web site.

Union, the University is adding graduate housing,
a fitness center and additional science and engi
neering facilities to its already expansive campus.
"The University has undergone a lot of
changes since I first arrived as a freshman in 1994
and it continues to evolve," said Graduate Stu
dent Council Co-Chair Tom Lee, a fourth-year
electrical engineering graduate student. "In 11

years here, I don't think there's ever been a time
when something wasn't being built or renovat
ed."
Old Union Renovation
The historic building,constructed from 1909 to
1922, is being renovated into a more traditional
student union which will house a new multi-faith
center as well as the offices of the ASSU.
"The Old Union project is currently com
pleting the early phases of design and is estimat
ed to complete construction in late 2006," said
Jack Geary, director of project management at
Stanford.
Geary explained that over the summer the Of-

fice of Undergraduate Admission and Financial
Aid Office moved to permanent locations in the
newly-renovated Bakewell Building. Student Fi
nancial Services, Housing Assignment Services,
Residential Education and the Registrar's Office
will he moved to new modulars next to theToyon
Eating Clubs at the intersection of Arguello Way
and Serra Street later this year. In addition, stu
dent activity programs will be moved to tempo
rary modulars located in the parking lot next to
the Black Community Service Center. Religious
organizations housed in the Old Union Club
house will also move temporarily to Building 60,
the current home of the Archeology
and Scheduling Departments.
Once renovations are completed,
all groups will move back into the
building. The ASSU office will be re
located from Tresidder Memorial
Union to the first floor of Old
Union.
"Since most of our services are
for student groups, this move makes
sense as we will be much more easi
ly accessible to them," said ASSU
President Melanie Kannokada, a
senior, who said she hopes the reno
vated Old Union will become a hub
of student activity. "Ideally, the new
location will also encourage stu
dents to stop in and find ways to get
involved within the ASSU."
Munger Graduate Residences
After receiving a $43.5 million
gift last year from Charles Munger,
the Vice Chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway and founder of the law
firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, and
his wife. Nancy, Stanford has been
making plans to use six acres of
University land behind the Law
School to provide housing to ap
proximately 500 graduate and pro
fessional students. The University
will also add a subterranean park
ing structure under Wilbur Field to
provide necessary parking spaces
to support the building.
"The Munger Graduate Resi
dences are progressing through the
design phase with construction
scheduled to start in mid-2006."
Cleary said. "The construction start
date is contingent on the County of
Santa Clara planning approvals ex
pected in December 2005. Later
this year and into 2006, site prepa
rations will begin for utility work;
relocation of the Owen, Drell,
Rogers. Mariposa and Serra hous
es; and excavation of the under
ground parking structure at Wilbur
Field."
During the summer, the resident
fellow's house at Casa Zapata was
rebuilt in preparation for construc
tion of the new graduate housing
project. Six student rooms in Casa
Zapata were used for the cottage.
"All the people involved were

consulted about the reconstruction
process, working directly with Pro
ject Manager Mark Bonino and his
staff," said Education Prof. Deanne
Perez-Granados, Resident Fellow at
Zapata. "I am very pleased with the
result — a very nice living space for
current and future resident fellows."
Several members of the commu
nity, including faculty, staff and stu
dents living in the surrounding area
were concerned with the effect the
residences will have on the Stanford
campus, including an increase in
traffic and the overpowering size of
the proposed buildings.
Arrillaga Family Recreation
Center
Directly across from the Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center is the
new two-story Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center developed by
donor John Arrillaga. The facility
will feature seven squash courts, a
4,000-square-foot multipurpose
room with wall-to-wall mats, a 24-
foot rock-climbing wall, three bas
ketball courts that can be trans
formed into volleyball and bad
minton courts, space for sports med
icine and tutoring services for stu
dents and a fitness center with a
weight room and workout machines.
The nearly 75,000-square-foot
recreation center is scheduled to
open on Oct. 3, according to Cleary
— right on schedule.
"Non-athletes have been want
ing more options to work out for
years now, so we are extremely glad
to see this need finally being ful
filled," Kannokada said. "Addition
ally, we imagine it will help the over
all wellness of students by providing
an outlet to de-stress.There is a lot of
potential for this space, and we will
want to ensure that students will
have a say in how it is used in the
years to come."
Returning students said they are
looking forward to the recreation
center opening in the near future.
"It looks absolutely gorgeous
from the outside, especially in the
evenings with how you can see in
side from Campus Drive," said Paul
Gurney, a fourth-year electrical en
gineering doctoral student. "I'm re
ally looking forward to using it and
seeing it from the inside next
month — I imagine it will be a real
ly popular place to play pick-up
basketball."

Science and Engineering Quad
(SEQ2)
"The new quad will house four
buildings, two of which are replace
ments for buildings which will be
torn down and two of which will
house new University-wide initia
tives," said Jim Plummer, dean of the
School of Engineering, in an inter
view last year. "These initiatives are
the Institute for the Environment
and the new Bioengineering De
partment."
Cleary said that site preparations
and utility work have begun on the
Environment and Energy Building,
the first structure in the new SEQ2.
The building is progressing through
the schematic design phase and is
scheduled for Board of Trustees de
sign approval in April 2006. The
project is proceeding on schedule
with construction on the Environ
ment and Energy Building slated to
start in June 2006.
"The SEQ2 project will be a great
thing for students," Lee said. "It will
replace some aging research buildings
and give students state-of-the-art fa
cilities to work in. It will also beautify
one of the least appealing parts of the
campus. There will be some inconven
iences fora while, but I think the end
product will be worth it."
Impact of Construct ion Projects
Cleary said he anticipates that
the large-scale construction projects
will "cause significant temporary
disruptions to the area around the
construction site."
"As part of the Department of
Project Management's project deliv
ery process, the impacts associated
with the construction of our build
ings on our community are carefully
considered," Cleary added. "Each
Stanford project manager works
with the contractors for their respec
tive projects during the design phase
to identify potential disruptions dur
ing construction and to develop mit
igation measures that reduce their
impact to the general region, neigh
boring building occupants, pedestri
an and bike access and service and
deliveries."

projects in design and construction

Project Management's Web site.
