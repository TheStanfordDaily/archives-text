### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students should consider investing in
a hardhat based on the number of construction
projects happening on campus this year. In addi
tion to a renovation project re-creating a new Old
Union, the University is adding graduate housing,
a fitness center and additional science and engi
neering facilities to its already expansive campus.
"The University has undergone a lot of
changes since I first arrived as a freshman in 1994
and it continues to evolve," said Graduate Stu
dent Council Co-Chair Tom Lee, a fourth-year
electrical engineering graduate student. "In 11

years here, I don't think there's ever been a time
when something wasn't being built or renovat
ed."
Old Union Renovation
The historic building,constructed from 1909 to
1922, is being renovated into a more traditional
student union which will house a new multi-faith
center as well as the offices of the ASSU.
"The Old Union project is currently com
pleting the early phases of design and is estimat
ed to complete construction in late 2006," said
Jack Geary, director of project management at
Stanford.
Geary explained that over the summer the Of-

fice of Undergraduate Admission and Financial
Aid Office moved to permanent locations in the
newly-renovated Bakewell Building. Student Fi
nancial Services, Housing Assignment Services,
Residential Education and the Registrar's Office
will he moved to new modulars next to theToyon
Eating Clubs at the intersection of Arguello Way
and Serra Street later this year. In addition, stu
dent activity programs will be moved to tempo
rary modulars located in the parking lot next to
the Black Community Service Center. Religious
organizations housed in the Old Union Club
house will also move temporarily to Building 60,
