## Roble Gym transforms into studio Gym is now owned and operated by Drama Dept. 
### SOOMIN KIM STAFF WRITER 
Newly dubbed as Roble "Stu
dios," Roble Gym has begun its
transformation into the Drama
Department's performing arts
complex. Hie transition will be car
ried out gradually but all Athletics
Department staff and gym facili
ties will move out by the beginning
weeks of the fall quarter.
Roble Gym was previously
owned and operated by the Athlet
ics Department for almost seven
decades, hosting a variety of athlet
ics and fitness classes. Both the
Athletics and the Drama Depart
ments' need for more and better
facilities resulted in the construc
tion of the Arrillaga Fitness Cen
ter.
The Arrillaga Fitness Center,
which was supposed to open by the
start of the quarter, is currently still
under construction. Athletics
classes which were scheduled to be
held in the Fitness Center will re
main in the Roble Gym during the
first week of classes.
The Staff members in the
Drama Department's Dance Divi
sion said they were delighted by
the change. ITie Dance Division
became part of the Drama Depart
ment seven years ago, and staffers
have been eager to carry out the
programmatic and philosophical
changes that will accompany better
studios and rehearsal spaces.
"We are very excited about this
change because it will now enable
us to carry out our $20 million ren
ovation plans that will transform
Roble into a dynamic performing
arts center," said Tom Kramer, the
director of the Dance Division.
The planned upgrade includes
costume shops, stage shops, the
aters and practice studios for re
hearsals, all of which are in line with
the Dance Division's commitment
to teach world dance and perform
ance techniques.
This fall, the Stanford Alumni
Concert, to be held on Nov. 6, will
invite all Stanford dance alumni
and students to show their talents.
"Zamacueca," which will take
place in Jan. 21 and 22, will show
case the diaspora of the Latin
American dances, with many small
er performances to come through
out the year.
The Drama Department will
also offer several new and special
dance classes this quarter — Muisi-
Kongo Malonga and her brother
Kiazi will teach "Congolese
Dance," a display of Congolese cul
ture played out in dance move
ment; Eliza Shapiro will be teaching
"The Body in Motion," a class
about analyzing dance movement
and its relation to psychological
therapies; and the long-time direc
tor of Stanford dance programs,
Susan Cashion. will be teaching
"Ballet Folklorico" and "Dances of
Latin America," courses for those
who are interested in Latin dances.
The transition, however, has not
been welcomed by everyone. The
Health Improvement Program
(HIP), which offers a variety of
healthy living and fitness classes as
part of a benefits program for Stan
ford employees, had offered most
of its classes in Roble Gym prior to
the renovations.
"The news was a major blow for
many of us," said Jerrie Thurman.
the HIP coordinator. "Our pro
grams, such as circuit weight train
ing or back stability classes, were so
important to many of the partici
pants, but we were left uninformed
about where we would be able to
relocate our classes."
As this uncertainty escalated,
the worried HIP participants filed
and signed a petition to resume
their classes at Roble, which was
eventually turned down.

Although most of the HIP class
es will he accommodated by the Ar
rillaga Fitness Center after an al
most year-long wait.Thurman said
she is still worried that many of the
former HIP participants cannot af
ford the two-hour lunch break that
will be required in order to attend
classes at Arrillaga.
Consequently, this year's HIP
enrollment data shows a general
pattern of decline in relocated car
dio, boot camp and kickboxing
classes.
"All changes have advantages
and disadvantages," Thurman said.
"After all. we were able to relocate
most of our classes to Arrillaga and

we are grateful for the support
given for all HIP programs."
Some students had mixed emo
tions about Roble Gym changing
hands.
"I definitely think that it's bene
ficial to the students to have more
dance classes and more perform
ances, since a lot of dance classes on
campus, especially social dance
classes, fill up incredibly quickly,"
said senior Jessica Lou. "However,
the whole Stanford community
must be taken into account, so un
less Stanford employees are of
fered another venue to work out
during lunch time, this change is
probably not worth it."
