cogent, straight-forward writing style,"

Thompson Jr.. director of the Stanford
Institute for the Environment. "He also
was a terrific human being and a loyal
friend to all of the young lawyers who

favorite law school professor. John Hurl
but. who taught criminal law and evi

Outside of classes, he spent his first
year as a counselor at Menlo Junior Col
lege and his second year as a resident as

sistant at the once all-male dormitory.

tions of federalism is perhaps best
known," he added. "But he also
played a role in focusing greater at
tention on the constitutional protec
tion against takings of property
without compensation, as well as a
variety of other important constitu
tional provisions."
Rehnquist was a terrific human
being and a loyal friend to all the
young lawyers who clerked for him,
Thompson explained.
"Rehnquist was also the ultimate
Renaissance man," he added. "He
was a painter, amateur historian and
exuberant singer â€” author of sever
al books, a lover of games and a true
optimist."

Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, di
rector of the Stanford Criminal Jus
tice Center, clerked fora different
justice on the Supreme Court but
said he and his co-clerks did spend
some time with Rehnquist.
"For all his public image as a se
vere conservative with authoritarian
views, he was a disarmingly affable
and informal man,quite without pre
tense," Weisberg said.
Rehnquist wrote many notable
opinions, including 1995's United
States v. Lopez, which struck down a
federal law as exceeding Congres
sional power under the commerce
clause, 2002's Zelman v. Simmons-
Harris, which approved a school
voucher program that aided
parochial and other private schools,
and a concurring opinion in 2000's
Bush v. Gore, which stopped the
statewide recount in Florida.
