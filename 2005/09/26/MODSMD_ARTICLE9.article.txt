## Iran decries U.N. nuclear policy 
### ALI AKBAR DAREINI ASSOCIATED PRESS 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's
foreign minister called a resolution
by the U.N. nuclear watchdog that
puts it just one step away from possi
ble Security Council sanctions "ille
gal and illogical" and accused the
United States on Sunday of orches
trating the measure.
Separately, in a letter to Iran's ul
traconservative President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, some 180 out of 290
lawmakers called on his government
to cancel Iran's voluntary suspension
of nuclear activities and scale back
cooperation with the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
The resolution passed Saturday
by the lAEA board could lead to
Iran's referral to the U.N. Security
Council for violating the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty _ and possi
ble sanction — unless Tehran eases
suspicions about its nuclear activi
ties. Iran insists its nuclear program is
designed for generating electricity.
Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki called the res
olution "political, illegal and illogi
cal" and threatened unspecified
punitive measures against Britain,
France and Germany — the key
three European countries negotiat
ing with Iran.
"The three European countries
implemented a planned scenario, al
ready determined by the United
States," he said on state-run televi
sion.
"The Foreign Ministry will define
and implement an appropriate re
sponse." he said. "Their motion has
paved the way for creation of a new

situation that will create obstacles
for cooperation."
Tehran had already warned that,
if the resolution was approved, it
could respond by starting uranium
enrichment — a possible path to nu
clear arms — and by reducing lAEA
powers to inspect its activities.
Mottaki said the rotating presi
dency of the European Union "is un
able to manage the situation" and
made decisions under U.S. pressure.
Britain holds the current EU presi
dency.
France, Britain and Germany,
"through rendering this politically
motivated, illegal and illogical reso
lution. removed any final doubts that
they are not committed to their obli
gations under agreements reached
with Iran in the past 20 months,"
Mottaki said.
Diplomats from countries back
ing the resolution said it set Iran up
for possible Security Council referral
as early as November, when the
board next meets in regular session.
To avoid referral, diplomats said,
Iran is being told to suspend all ura
nium enrichment activities, to give
up construction of a heavy water
nuclear reactor and to give agency
experts access to research and de
velopment locations and documen
tation.
The resolution also demands that
Iran immediately ratify an additional
protocol to the NPT that allows more
extensive lAEA inspections of its
nuclear facilities.
Iran has repeatedly said that the
treaty allows it to pursue such activi
ties for peaceful purposes, and that it
will not give up the right to enrich
uranium to produce nuclear fuel.

Parliamentary speaker Gholam
Alj Haddad Adel said parliament
will not ratify the additional NPT
protocol because it is "against the
definite rights of the Iranian nation,"
according to state-run radio.
Russia, one of the countries that
abstained from Saturday's vote,
called on Iran on Sunday to cooper
ate with the agency.
"We exp*.ct that Iran will actively
cooperate with the lAEA with the
purpose of quickly closing all out
standing questions," said a statement
from Russia's Foreign Ministry.
The resolution was approved by
22 of 35 board nations, with 12 ab
stentions and one rejection — by
Venezuela — rather than the usual
consensus. Only twice in the past
decade has the lAEA board voted
on an issue instead of adopting it by
consensus. Both times were on North
Korea for leaving the nonprolifera
tion treaty, first in 1993, then in 2003.
While the U.N. Security Council

could impose sanctions, that is un
likely because of opposition by veto
wielding council members Russia
and China.
The United States had applied
strong pressure on Russia, China,
India and other countries to join in a
"unified message" to Iran. China also
chose to abstain.
Both Russia and China look to
energy-rich Iran as a major trading
partner. Russia is building a nuclear
reactor in Iran and China relies on oil
imports to support its economic
growth.
Iran resumed uranium conver
sion early in August, a step prior to
enrichment, but continues to sus
pend uranium enrichment, the last
stage that can be used to produce nu
clear fuel or nuclear weapons.
The resolution represents a victo
ry for Washington, which had tried
for more than two years to enlist
board support to haul Iran before the
Security Council.
