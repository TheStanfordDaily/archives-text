CREOLE, La. (AP) — Hurri
cane Rita's path of devastation
along the Texas-Louisiana coast be
came shockingly clear yesterday, as
rescuers pulled stranded bayou res
idents out on skiffs and Army heli
copters searched for thousands of
cattle feared drowned.
Crews struggled to clean up the
tangle of smashed homes and
downed trees. The hurricane
slammed low-lying fishing villages,
shrimping ports and ranches with
water up to 9 feet deep. Seawater
pushed as far as 20 miles inland,
drowning acres of rice, sugarcane
fields and pasture.
In coastal Terrebonne Parish,
the count of severely damaged or
destroyed homes stood at nearly
9,900. An estimated 80 percent of
the buildings in the town of
Cameron, population 1,900, were
leveled. Farther inland, half of Cre
ole, population 1,500, was left in
splinters.
"I would use the word de
stroyed," Army Lt. Gen. Russel
Honore said of Cameron.
"Cameron and Creole have been
destroyed except for the court
house, which was built on stilts on
higher ground. Most of the houses
and public buildings no longer exist
or are even in the same location
that they were."
The death toll from the second
devastating hurricane in a month
rose to 10 with the discovery in a

Beaumont, Texas, apartment of five
people — a man, a woman and
three children — who apparently
were killed by carbon monoxide
from a generator they were running
indoors after Rita knocked out the
electricity In Texas, a couple was
confirmed killed by an uprooted
tree that fell on their home, and an
other man was electrocuted as he
tried to connect a generator.
Houses in the marshland be
tween Cameron and Creole were
reduced to piles of bricks, or bare
concrete slabs with steps leading to
nowhere. Walls of an elementary
school gymnasium had been
washed or blown away leaving bas
ketball hoops hanging from the
ceiling. A single-story white home
was propped up against a line of
trees, left there by floodwaters that
ripped it from its foundation. A
bank was open to the air, its vault
still intact.
"We used to call this sportsman's
paradise," said Honore, a Louisiana
native. "But sometimes Mother Na
ture will come back and remind us
that it has power over the land.
That's what this storm did."
While residents of the Texas re
finery towns of Beaumont, Port
Arthur and Orange were blocked
from returning to their homes be
cause of the danger of debris
choked streets and downed power
lines, authorities in Louisiana were
unable to keep bayou residents
from venturing in on their own by
boat to see if Rita wrecked their
homes.
