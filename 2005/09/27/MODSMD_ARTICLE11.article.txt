## Get A Comp Clue Surfing for the overscheduled 
### 
Your computer should be a time-saver, not a
time-sink.
If you are like most Stanford students, then
you're already facing a quarter so full of classes
and commitments that shaving off even a few
seconds of your time will be worthwhile. This
week's column explores techniques for maximiz
ing your time while surfing the Web.
Tabbed browsing, inline searching, book
marks and RSS offer a few under-utilized tech
nologies to make your browsing more efficient.

To tab or not to tab
The unenlightened Web surfer only uses one
window. He or she views one Web site at a time
and with a click of the mouse moves to a site
anew, relegating the old one to the dark depths of
the "Back" button.
Browsing with a single window h> like rock
ing out to an 8-track — it is bulky, old and out
dated. People think sporadically, not in a
straight line. Web surfers need to be able to
refer back to prior information easily, start up
new tangents, explore new ideas and still retain
the paths they left off.
Before tabbed browsing, power users could
surf the Web more naturally by opening up new
windows — either by right-clicking on a link
(Control-clicking for Mac) and choosing "Open
Link in New Window" or by opening a fresh
window entirely with the keyboard command,
Control-N (Command-N). This would allow
them to click on a new link and not lose where
they left off.
Tragically, opening new windows has its limi
tations. After four windows, it is hard to keep
track of them all, and one can flounder amidst a
sea of windows that quickly overwhelms your
task bar.
Tab browsing comes to the rescue. It allows
users to group Web sites inside a single browser
window. In appearance, tabs resemble their
physical counterpart — they rest like notebook
dividers neatly along the top of your browser's
window. Clicking on each tab allows you to
switch amongst them.
Combining different browser windows, each
with their own tabs, allows you to easily keep
track of large number of Web pages. I like to
have one window devoted to tabs from news
sites, like the BBC and The New York Times,
another window for tabs of Google search re
sults and a third for time-killers, like Face
book.com.
Finding the Tabs
Tab browsing comes default with Mozilla Fire
fox, available free at http://mozilla.org.To open a
new tab in Firefox, type "Control+T" or right
click a link (Control-click on Macs). Mac users
can turn tabs on in Safari by going to the "Safari"
menu, clicking "Preferences", clicking the
"Tabs" tab and checking "Enable Tabbed
Browsing."
Internet Explorer users will have to either
switch to Firefox or wait until Microsoft releas
es IE7, which contains tabs but is still in beta
testing.
Inline, Online
Whereas tabbed browsing can revolutionize
your browsing experience, inline searching and
RSS will help streamline it.
Firefox allows users to search within a Web
page without touching the mouse. Simply tap
the "/" key and start typing.The first instance of
the word you type will become highlighted.Tap
"Control-G" and you move on to the next in
stance. This is great for finding a word in a
hurry amidst a long Wikipedia article or list of
names.
Inline searching also works for browsing in
general. When you find a link, you can hit enter
to follow it, thereby browsing the Web without
ever touching the mouse. For those who are fast
with the keyboard, this is a significant speedup
from the old mouse-dependent system. At the
very least, it will impress your friends!
Feed Me RSS
Firefox also allows you to create "live book
marks" with today's news based on Really
Simple Syndicate technology, or RSS. These
"live" bookmarks will take the headlines from
your favorite blog or news site and display it as
a folder in your browser's toolbar. You can
keep headlines from The New York Times,
Boing Boing or Slashdot just a mouse click
away.
In Firefox, go to a site with an RSS feed. Look
for the small orange broadcasting icon in the
lower right hand corner. Click the icon,click sub
scribe and then save in the "Bookmarks Toolbar
Folder."
With news, searching and tabs, you can bring
browsing to a whole new level.
