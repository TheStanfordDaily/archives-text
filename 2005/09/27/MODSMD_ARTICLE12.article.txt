When was the last time you were excit
ed to hear something described as "impos
sibly small"?
Apple, Inc. hopes it was Sept. 7, when
the Cupertino-based company announced
the release of its wafer-thin iPod nano, the
latest and greatest addition to an om
nipresent MP3 player line-up.
The sleek device, which comes in white
or black, weighs just 1.5 ounces and is a
mere 0.27 inches thick. Touted as being
thinner than a standard No. 2 pencil, the
nano squeezes past comparable players
that are more than twice its size.
At the San Francisco press conference,
Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
promised that good things, indeed, come in
small packages.
"iPod nano is the biggest revolution
since the original iPod," Jobs said. "iPod
nano is a full-featured iPod in an impossi
bly small size, and it's going to change the
rules for the entire portable music mar
ket."
Even at an arm's length, the nano's
postage stamp-sized screen gleams, aston
ishingly clear, in its rpillions of colors and
176 by 132 pixel resolution.The 4 GB vari
ety of nano. like its mini sibling, can hold up
to 1,000 songs. But. unlike the mini, which
has a black-and-white display, the nano can
display album art right alongside the
names of its user's tracks.
The color screen also gives users the op
portunity to use the nano as a glitzy photo
storage device, which can carry up to
25,000 pictures.
Nano gives thanks to flash memory for

helping maintain its deceptively waif-like
physique. In the techie world, flash memo
ry is defined as a solid state storage device,
with "solid" referring to its stationary elec
tronic — as opposed to moving, mechani
cal — parts.
In layman's terms, choosing flash mem
ory over a bulkier hard drive translates to
more remaining space inside the nano for
a long-lasting battery. Apple tech specs
highlight the nano's 14 hours of playback
time, just an hour shy of regular iPod en
durance.
Emblazoned with a brilliant display,
Energizer-bunny moxie and innovative
appeal, one might start to believe that
there's nothing impossible about the im
possibly small product.
But before you give Steve Jobs your
undying praise and your local retailer $249
plus tax, consider the tragic testimony of
Matthew Peterson.
Peterson, 26, and creator of the Web site
http://flawedmusicplayer.com, was dis
mayed to find his nano's liquid crystal dis
play (LCD) screen cracked after just four
days of use.
Peterson laments that the durability of
regular iPod screens does not appear to
carry over to the nano line.
"With the regular iPod,the screen cover
doesn't flex — it's a very tough plastic over
the LCD," he tells The Daily.'On the nano,
it's very flexible and when you touch it, it
allows you to touch the LCD underneath."
The independent consultant from De
troit. Mich., lays no claim to his engineer
ing savvy. He does know enough to balk at
a product that fails in less than a week.
"The slightest amount of twisting would
reveal cracks in the screen." Peterson said.

"That leads me to believe that when it was
in my pocket, the slightest amounts of
pressure applied to the nano would be
enough to [severely] damage it."
He suggests that Jobs should put his
money where his mouth — and pocket —
are.
"The iPod nano is not really to be used,"
Peterson states on his website. "Apple mar
ket's [sic] it in a pocket. Hell, Steve Jobs
himself pulls it out of his when he an
nounces it."
"[My nano's screen] shattered. It was in
my pocket as 1 was walking and I sat
down," he adds.
As with many famous-overnight Web
sites, Peterson's published outcry first met
with little support and a barrage of hate
mail. The self-proclaimed "lifelong Mac
fan" was pigeon-holed as the next disgrun
tled ignoramus, trying to harness the inter
net as the instant soapbox and take down
the Man. In this case, the "Think different"
Man.
But in the two weeks following his Web
site's inception, Peterson has received a
constantly growing number of e-mails
from disgruntled consumers with frac
tured nanos. As cautionary tales of the del
icate nano spread, Peterson will continue
to push tor a product recall.
"In the beginning, I'd say it was 80 per
cent hate mail," Peterson says."The web
site has turned into a much larger ordeal.
Apple is replacing my nano in what they
call a 'one-time' exception of warranty, but
that doesn't mean I'm going to wash my
hands of it."
As they say, try before you buy. And if
you do buy the iPod nano, be prepared to
splurge immediately on a protective case.

sites, Peterson's published outcry first met
with little support and a barrage of hate
mail. The self-proclaimed "lifelong Mac
fan" was pigeon-holed as the next disgrun
tled ignoramus, trying to harness the inter
net as the instant soapbox and take down
the Man. In this case, the "Think different"
Man.
But in the two weeks following his Web
site's inception, Peterson has received a
constantly growing number of e-mails
from disgruntled consumers with frac
tured nanos. As cautionary tales of the del
icate nano spread, Peterson will continue
to push tor a product recall.
"In the beginning, I'd say it was 80 per
cent hate mail," Peterson says."The web
site has turned into a much larger ordeal.
Apple is replacing my nano in what they
call a 'one-time' exception of warranty, but
that doesn't mean I'm going to wash my
hands of it."
As they say, try before you buy. And if
you do buy the iPod nano, be prepared to
splurge immediately on a protective case.
