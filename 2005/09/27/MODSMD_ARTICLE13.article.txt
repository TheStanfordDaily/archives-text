# VW Hybrids: On the Distant Horizon
## 
### ERIC FORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After years of skepticism and avoidance,
German automaker giant Volkswagen AG
finally deigned to join the likes of Toyota
and Ford and enter the hybrid vehicle mar
ket. Volkswagen's announcement to intro
duce the vehicle in China stems from the
Chinese government's recent interest in
subsidizing car companies and universities
to conduct research in hybrid systems.
Like other German carmakers, Volkswa
gen is noted for its long-standing reliance
on diesel engines. While in Beijing. VW
spokesman Kai Gr.ber explained that it was
hard to sell diesel-powered cars in China, so
the company had chosen the country as its
first hybrid market.
liie news came earlier this month in
Hong Kong, as the carmaker also an
nounced a joint venture with Shanghai
Automobile Industry to develop a new hy
brid engine that will be outfitted into a
next-generation Volkswagen Touran van.
The hybrid Touran is expected to hit mar
kets before the end of the decade in
China, with current plans for models to be
to built and shown at the 2008 Olympic
Games in Beijing.
According to a statement released by
Shanghai Automotive, their aim is to com

plete 500 hybrid Touran cars and use them
as personal shuttles during the 2008 Games.
"We expect that large-scale production
will start before the 2010 World Expo in
Shanghai," they said.
Although specific information regarding
the hybrid announcement has not been re
leased, the specifications of the hybrid en
gine are expected to meet or exceed present
competition on the market. Current hybrid
models available for sale offer improved
gas mileage over traditional vehicles, such
as a 13 percent increase in the Chevy Silver
ado hybrid truck and a 30 percent improve
ment in the Toyota Prius.
While there has been no official word on
whether the new VW will be released out
side of China, the automotive industry spec
ulates that Volkswagen's hybrid Touran will
expand to the Americas and Europe by the
end of the decade.The recent unveiling of a
hybrid engine by Audi, the sister corpora
tion of Volkswagen, lends credence to these
reports.
The hybrid engine is a combination of a
gasoline internal combustion engine and
some form of an electric motor, which are
used concurrently to power the vehicle.
While traditional gas-powered engines op
erate over a wide range of speed and power,
they're inefficient if they run outside their
narrow range of operation.

Natural resource-sparing engines that
rely solely on battery power have existed
for some time, but their constant charging
requirements have limited their main
stream adoption. Here the hybrid engine
steps in, combining the extended range of a
gasoline-powered engine with the higher
efficiency of an electric engine.
In addition to higher efficiency, hybrid
vehicles typically require much less gaso
line than their non-hybrid relatives,
spurring environmental and financial sav
ings.
However, issues have been raised re
garding the extent of the economic bene
fits of owning a hybrid vehicle. While the
increase in mileage that accompanies
each hybrid can generate over $300 year
in gas money, these vehicles typically cost
an average of $3000 to $6000 more, de
pending on the make and model of the hy
brid vehicle.
The variable cost of insurance on hybrid
cars also poses a quandary. Some insurance
companies, Allstate for example, don't dif
ferentiate their premiums between hybrid
and non-hybrid cars. Other companies, such
as Esurance. actually decrease the cost of
insurance if you purchase an equivalent car
that doesn't have a hybrid engine.
Under the Working Families Tax Relief
Act of 2004, owners of hybrid vehicles can

be eligible fora $2,000 tax cut, but this
change is in place only through 2005.
With details of economic benefits in
question, there remains the hope that hy
brid owners can at least improve their com
mute times. In California, Governor
Schwarzenegger is attempting to push legis
lation through the state assembly that
would give hybrid vehicle owners the abili
ty to drive solo in the carpool lanes
In the Stanford community, it is not yet
known whether hybrid vehicles have con
tributed any meaningful change to the en
vironment. The Department of Parking
and Transportation was not available for
comment in regards to the estimated per
centage of hybrid vehicle owners in the
community, or regarding the impact of such
vehicles on the its current cleaner-commut
ing objectives.
While hybrid vehicles are steadily being
adopted across the nation, their higher ini
tial investment cost remains the main
caveat in gaining explosive popularity. As
more countries mimic China and start sub
sidizing research for hybrid vehicles, the
overall cost of production should fall, low
ering the end price for the consumer.
Volkswagen's decision finally to enter
the hybrid market can only mean one
thing: The hybrid market will not be going
away any time soon.
