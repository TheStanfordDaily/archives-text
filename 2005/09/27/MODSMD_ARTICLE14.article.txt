## Out there A 						city girl faces nature 
### ILENA C GEORGE 
I was born and raised in Manhattan. This
doesn't give you a lot of street cred when
you're road-tripping through the wilder
ness of America's National Parks, even if
you spend your nights sleeping in the back
of your car. Rachel, the Thelma to my
Louise and one of my two best girl friends
from high school, avoided referencing her
Big Apple upbringing entirely; just having
New York plates is apparently bad enough.
More accurately, Rachel was the
Steinbeck to my Charlie, as she has spent a
total of six months working with the
Student Conservation Association —
which basically entailed doing what a Park
Ranger does while getting paid a fraction of
a Ranger's salary. Rachel's a bit of a nature
freak, at home among trees, rocks and gorp
aficionados. I'm at home in loud, crowded
places where people wear a lot of black.
The road trip was her idea; I came along for
the ride. Her plan for much of the summer
was to drive around exploring the different
parks in the west.
My longstanding plan for the summer
was to apply to medical school and take the
MCAT. But there's a reason why that test is
a four-letter word. In addition, I had
applied for an untold number of intern
ships, but despite promises that doors fly
open for you at the mere mention of
"Stanford," none of these came through.
After spending spring quarter in English
major boot camp (sometimes known as
Stanford in Oxford) and churning out near
ly 100 pages worth of essays, I was ready for
a break. So what's a girl to do when she's
unemployed and unwilling to sacrifice
another summer to academic endeavors?
Get in a '91 Taurus GL station wagon with
no air bags and drive.
Since college began for the three of us,
Rachel and I, along with Anita (the third
member of our high school triumvirate)
have had an odd inability to be in the same
place at the same time for more than 24
hours. The plan for the summer was to end
that streak by heading for Seattle, where
Anita was interning.
Our funds were limited and my driving
skills dubious (like many New Yorkers, hit
ting puberty and learning to drive were not
synchronous for me). We began our trip in
Grand Junction, Colo., where Rachel had
spent the past eight weeks working her
geology major magic. Our destination:
Seattle, by way of Utah, Arizona, Utah
again, Idaho and Glacier National Park,
Mont.. After working in Glacier summer
before last, Rachel was still drawn to the
Park like a raccoon to something shiny. Our
mode of transportation: The Hobo Hut, as
the station wagon was later christened.
Our first stop was in Black Canyon of
the Gunnison, a National Park in Colorado,
which, like many of the Parks, had no run
ning water. In fact, all potable water was
bused in 14 miles from Montrose, a neigh
boring town.The fact that the pit toilets had
hand sanitizer Rachel called "luxurious."
That first night, Rachel made me swallow
my toothpaste. That was my first introduc
tion to the ethics of "Leave No Trace" and
the moment I realized how far out of my
league I was. It was the beginning of sever
al weeks of questionable hygiene. (Which
came to a head our last night in Glacier,
when Rachel overheard a woman in the
bathroom trying to get her dog to use the
toilet. Yes, the people toilet.)
At night we folded down the seats and
slept in the back of the car. Besides being
useful as a conversation starter, living in the
Hobo Hut led us to spend the night in

unusual places. One night we found our
selves in a parking lot just outside Glacier,
parked between a school bus and an SUV,
sleeping off an evening of cheap margaritas
consumed in the company of raft guides
who work on the river featured in the
movie "The River Wild" — an experience
bringing me one degree closer to Kevin
Bacon. Rachel also introduced me to the
concept of BLM land, which, besides
sounding vaguely fecal, stands for Bureau
of Land Management; this is land that is not
preserved within the parks, has no ameni
ties and on which we spent various nights
parked on little more than a patch of dirt
not far off the road. In the end, the best
thing about sleeping in the Hut was feeling
a hell of a lot safer inside the car when in
Glacier — famous for its bears (and infa
mous for"The Night of the Grizzlies," a
night in August 1967 when two 19-year-old
girls were killed in separate grizzly bear
attacks in the park) — than 1 would have
felt camping outside it.
The car itself was a miracle of modern
engineering. But it was a grizzled relic, a bit
worse for the wear. As an interminably
blinking orange light on the dash reminded
us, the air bags were long gone. And some
times pieces would just fall off. On our way
to Polebridge, Mont, (population: four in
winter, six in summer) to buy some notori
ously delicious cookies at the general store
there (which were sold to us by a woman
who, without irony or self-consciousness,
claimed she could read minds), we realized
another little piece of the car had broken off
when we could catch a glimpse of the engine
from the front, without popping the hood.
The AC gave up the ghost in Holbrook,
Ariz., a town once deemed "too hard for
women and churches." where the tempera
ture was up to 101. From then on, a tacit
challenge between us added tension to the
heat when in the car. Although sweat visi
bly dripped off of us, we were both too
proud to be the first to complain.
On the road. 1 learned a hard truth
about myself: I love country music. I sub
jected Rachel to long hours of Jeff
Foxworthy's Sunday countdown (and she, a
New York Jew, showed a predilection for
Sunday radio's fire-and-brimstone preach
ers). In my favorite country song, Alan
Jackson describes a formative summer on
the Chattahoochee River saying, "I learned
how to swim and I learned who I was, a lot
about living and a little 'bout love."
Although I learned none of those lessons
this summer, I came away with one feeling
above all others: gratitude. I am grateful 1
had the chance to drop everything and
drive, grateful I had a destination and grate
ful I had someone else in the car with me.
And while I pledge my loyalty to my city
before my country, the road trip taught me
how much America there is out there, and
how unexpectedly beautiful it can be. And
for that, too, I am grateful.
We made it to Seattle, broke the streak
but all too quickly parted ways again. Now
Rachel and Anita are back in school and
I'm back in New York, putting the "temp"
back in "contempt" and figuring out what
to do now. As for the Hobo Hut, it was
inspected and deemed "miserably" unfit to
be driven safely; it awaits the junk man to
come and cart it away.

Ilena is taking fall and winter off but plans
on making her highly anticipated comeback
sometime in the spring. In the meantime, she
makes no apologies for the blatant irrele
vance of this column and is always up for
hearing your road stories at icgeorge@stan
