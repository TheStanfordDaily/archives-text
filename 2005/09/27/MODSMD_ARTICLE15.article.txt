# The 						Crazy Optimist, Redux
## Conversation with an advertisement 
### PETER STAIR 
I was biking to Humßio section
yesterday when I passed a billboard
carrying a gigantic bullhorn. "Hello
Peter," he said to me.
I skidded to a stop and turned
around to face a smiling man wearing
a large cardboard poster with a pic
ture of a candy bar on it. There was
another poster on his back, and all
sorts of logos on his face.
"Did you just say my name?" I
asked.
"Yeah, what's up? You look fit.
lean and hungry. Are you interested
in buying one of those manly choco
late bars you really like?"
"Um, not really. I mean, maybe.
How do you know me?" I said.
"It's my job. I know a lot about
you. I know, for example, that you
once tried one of BMG's buy-one
get-eight free CD deals. Which
reminds me: I'll bet you want to buy
the new Radiohead CD for half price.
Rolling Stone called it, 'excellent."'
He held a copy forward and
smiled nicely. The billboards on his
back transformed from an image of a
candy bar to a picture of the
Radiohead album cover.
"Who are you?"
"I'm your friend. I'm here to let
you know about all the fun you could
be having. I help people find what

they want. I also like girls who wear
Ahercrombie and Fitch."
He smiled again.
"Sounds like you're a product
pusher," I said suspiciously.
"1 prefer to see myself as a story
teller, like Dickens, or Homer, or
even Jesus." I le paused, then told me,
"I encourage people to live their
dreams, and then I show them how
simply they can attain these dreams
by going to the store. People like my
stories."
"You're not like Jesus!" I
exclaimed ridiculously. I wondered
why I was talking to an advertise
ment.
"No, you're right. I'm much more
exciting. Unlike Him, I fill otherwise
drab public spaces with stimulating
pictures and thoughts. I sponsor free
giveaways and sporting events. I even
provide you with free entertainment
on the TV and in the newspaper."
He was a good salesman.
He continued. "And, after all, isn't
life boring when you're happy with
what you already have?"
I paused and thought about all the
ways advertising had improved my
life.
"So, do you want this CD?" he
prodded. "I have friends who say it
changed their lives."
"Wait," I said, still thinking about
story-telling. "Maybe city bus rides

are cheaper because of you, but you
also play on our emotions and stir our
insecurities to create needs."
He looked at me quizzically.
"Like," I continued, "You make
people work 60 hour weeks at jobs
they don't like just so they can pay
fora luxury car."
He nodded thoughtfully, as if he
had heard what I had said before.
"Here's a better way of looking at
it: I help people satisfy needs they
previously didn't even know about."
He enunciated the last few words
with confident enthusiasm. "People
are living with luxuries they wouldn't
even have dreamed of without me."
"But do you think we're all better
off once we find these needs?" I
asked.
"Isn't it self-apparent?" he
gasped, "Humanity is enjoying its
blissful self-actualization! I mean,
we're beyond satisfying merely our
basic material needs. Only now have
we been able to spend so much time
on higher pursuits, like working on
computers or driving cars." As he
spoke, his Nike swoosh mohawk
shook enchantingly.
"I thought we were destroying our
habitat and making ourselves miser
able at the same time."
"Well, I suggest you reconsider
that opinion," he said brusquely. Then
he tried another pitch, "Surely, you'd

at least agree that we help each other
by buying more things."
He looked at me dramatically.
"Yes, if we weren't always wanting
more things, the economy wouldn't
grow fast enough and there wouldn't
be enough jobs. Indeed, without ad
guys like me, society would fall
apart."
"So you're just doing your duty as
a citizen?" I said, catching on.
"Precisely. And you would be too
if you only bought this CD today!"
"No. TTiat can't be right." I resis
ted, "There's got to be a better way."
"Not really. Unless you're willing
to talk about some pretty revolution
ary things..." he tapered off. "So! Do
you want this CD or not?"
I checked my pockets, pretended
they were empty, and shook my head
sadly.
"Sorry," I replied.
"All ri-ight, but don't blame me
when the economy falls apart."
Bewildered, I finished biking to
Humßio section.
