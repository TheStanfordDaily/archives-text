Picking Stanford to finish sev
enth in the Pac-10 ("Ranking the
Pac-10", Sept. 21)? Wow Alex, how
do you spell homer? I'm sorry, hut
Walt Harris doesn't have them
looking better than in past years. In
previous years you went to the
Rose Bowl! Hell, you went some
where other than spiraling down in
the Division 1-AA ranks.
Sports writers are supposed to
be neutral, no matter their affilia
tion. If Stanford keeps playing like
this, they are going to change the
name to the Pac-9.

This article-perspective ("A
responsibility to offend", Sept. 21)
is a joke, right? Why make the dis
tinction "Japanese tourists?" Why
not obnoxious, creepy tourists?
What if this group had been
Nordic? If the writer is going to
particularize, how does he even
know they are Japanese? They
could have been Thai sociologists
studying small group behavior in a
group environment. By "racially
profiling" this poor innocent group
of Asians, the author just created
another "you know how THEY
are..." conversation amongst his ilk.
That's creepy.

A lackluster welcome
As I watch all of the new and
returning students moving back to
campus. I wonder just how many
people can relate to the "Welcome
Home" feeling that Housing cer
tainly failed to create my first day
on campus.
All I knew when I arrived was
that I was living in Escondido
Village. I had no address and no
idea of where to go; at least the
shuttle driver knew to drop me off
at the EV office.
I walked in and asked for my
housing assignment. I didn't have a
student ID yet, much to the disap

pointment of the receptionist, so
my Wisconsin driver's license
would have to suffice. I was handed
a packet and a map and she point
ed a finger and motioned "that
direction." (Later I discovered I
was entitled to a free mug, and I
had to go back and get that little
gift after the fact.)
I couldn't leave my luggage in
the office while I found my apart
ment, so I set off. backpack on my
back and dragging three suitcases
while trying to read the EV map
and actually find my apartment.
Back home, I would have gotten
any number of offers for help drag
ging those suitcases, but here in
friendly California, most souls
seemed annoyed by my presence
blocking their bike path (on the
sidewalk) and were less than will
ing to offer to help the poor, glar
ingly-new student to her apart
ment.
Finally, success! I opened the
door on an apartment tracked with
leaves and mud and smelling like
mildew. Weren't they supposed to
clean these places? The kitchen
window and handles on several
drawers were broken, half of the
lights in the place were burnt out,
and the internet jack was complete
ly missing from my room (appar
ently the previous tenant had
decided to take it with him).
I went to bed wrapped in my
one travel blanket with a balled
jacket as a pillow, only to be awak
ened the next morning at 7:30 a.m.
by the children screaming in the
sandbox outside my window.
To top it off. I got charged an
extra $100 as an "early arrival" fee
when the orientation for my pro
gram started the day after I arrived.
Welcome to Stanford and wel
come "home." we hope you enjoy
your stay (or at least can find some
one else to commiserate with).
