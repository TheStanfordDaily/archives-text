## Card beats streaking Navy squad 
### WENDI GOH 
It was the final match in a series of six
consecutive away games. Along the way to
last Thursdayfs tilt there had been some dif
ficult games, exemplified by the 0-4 loss to
No. 1 North Carolina (10-0), and frustrating
games, such as the Cardinal's 0-1 loss to
Texas A & M (7-1-1). This was their third
match in a week but there were no tired legs
as the Stanford women's soccer team (4-3-1)
scored a convincing 2-1 triumph when visit
ing Navy.
The Stanford line-up had one noticeable
change, as senior keeper Erica Holland
earned her first start of the season after
freshman Alex Gamble suffered an injury.
Gamble had started all of the previous eight
games this season.
"Alex Gamble has a shoulder injury,"
head coach Paul Ratcliffe said before the
match. "[lt's] not serious, and she should be
back for our next game."
Navy, who entered the game on a six
game win streak, was outclassed by a team
that outshot them 13-4. While Stanford
also held an advantage with corner kicks
4-1, it was through open play rather than
set pieces that the Cardinal scored both
their goals.
In the 19th minute, senior Martha West
put Stanford on the scoreboard when her
shot from 25 yards out beat Navy keeper
Haley Crain and connected with the back of
the net. The Cardinal held on to their single
goal lead until halftime, as a hesitant Navy
failed to break through Stanford's defense.
The solid play of the Cardinal defenders pre
vented Navy's offense from attempting even
a single shot in the opening 45 minutes.
After the break, a more aggressive and
determined Navy squad appeared on the
field. Junior midfielder Molly Burd and jun

ior forward Meggie Curran provided Navy
with a chance to equalize, combining to
launch an attack on Stanford's goal. Howev
er, the threat was minimal as Burd's shot
lacked power and enabled Holland to pick
up her only save in the match.
Stanford freshman fullback Marissa
Abegg cemented the Cardinal's victory in
the 60th minute when Abegg's cross from
the left side of the pitch caught the inside of
the right post. This goal marked the start of
Abegg's collegiate scoring career.

"It was definitely a lucky goal," Abegg
said. "[I meant] for it to be a cross, [but] it
was still very exciting and exhilarating to
score my first goal for Cardinal."
Curran pulled one back for Navy just 29
seconds later, scoring from a free kick, bring
ing her season total to six goals. The remain
ing 30 minutes of the match were goalless,
despite each team's continuing effort to
scrore, and the Cardinal ultimately claimed
a well-deserved victory.
"As a team, we have finally really started

to pull it together," Ahegg said. "We've had
trouble finishing, hut we're finally getting it
right."
The victory can serve as a morale booster
for Stanford this weekend, when the squad
plays host to Oakland (3-4-1), Colorado Col
lege (6-2-3) and Santa Clara (7-1-1) for the
Stanford Nike Invitational. Despite a rela
tively shaky start to the season, the influx of
nine new players has finally seemed to en
able the team to work out positioning and
formation problems.
