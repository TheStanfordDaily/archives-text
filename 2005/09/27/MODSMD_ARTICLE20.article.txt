# Men notch back-to-back shutouts over weekend
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team (3-4-1) ex
perienced the growing pains of two excruciat
ing losses in the Bay Area Classic 10 days ago
but turned around and had a coming-of-age
party this weekend in the Stanford-Nike Invita
tional defeating Army 2-0 and then taking
down UAB 1-0.
The trouble started Sept. 16 when Stanford
drove down Route 101 to take on perennial
powerhouse No. 12 Santa Clara (5-2-0). De
spite being outshot 15-2, Stanford held a 1-0
'ead until the 86th minute, when the Broncos
finally struck.
With the scote now knotted at 1 -1. the game
went into an extra-frame, but the momentum
had completely swung in Santa Clara's favor
and the Broncos scored the game winner in the
97th minute.
The near-upset drained the young Cardinal

team for its next match against USF (4-2-1).
San Francisco spoiled Stanford's home opener,
thoroughly outshooting the Cardinal 15-5. The
Dons scored first on and held onto the goal lead
by shutting down Stanford's offense for most of
the 90-minutes.
Evident in both losses was a lack of execu
tion in the attacking half for the Cardinal.
"I don't think we can play |for only| one
goal." head coach Bret Simon said." We need to
be more efficient in our finishing. I'd like to see
us be more purposeful when we get to the at
tacking part of the field. But we've made some
good steps."
Ihe hangover did not last into the next
week, however,as the Stanford offense found
its groove at Maloney Field. The Cardinal
played host to California (7-0-1). Army (1 -8-
0). UAB (5-3-0) and the Stanford Nike Invi
tational.

A Stanford men's soccer player battles for the ball. With strong play all around, the Cardinal
emerged victorious — without allowing a goal in their two matches.
Stanford faced Army first and was
able to take the match to the Golden
Knights peppering the opposing net
— the Cardinal ended up doubling
Army's shot attempts, 8-4.
Stanford scored first when sopho
more midfielder Marcus Ryan re
ceived a ball from sophomore mid
fielder defender Kyle Hency and de
posited it behind the keeper in the
86th minute.The Cardinal then added
late insurance to their lead with an
other goal just more than a minute
later, courtesy of Hency and an assist
by Evan Morgan.
Energized by the return of junior
goalkeeper Andrew Kartunen from a
separated shoulder injury, the Cardi
nal also played stingy defense.
"Having Kartunen back in goal,
he's obviously a great keeper, but he's
also a steadying influence on a young
defense, and that's helpful too,"
Simon said.
Next up was UAB, a first-time op
ponent for the host, under the lights.
Again, young Stanford talent
stepped up. Freshman T.J. Novak
passed a nifty ball down to the cor
ner where Ryan slid across in front
of the goal mouth. Junior midfielder
Galen Thompson was able to con
nect and hit the ball into the net. The
Stanford defense played solidly to
seal the 1-0 victory.
"It's a good start before we go to
conference play," Simon said."! think
we're getting valuable experience."
Stanford and California did not
play each other in that tournament,
but the schools are scheduled to clash
twice in conference play.
The focus now switches to ways
the Stanford offense can get more of
fensive production as the Pacific 10
Conference schedule looms.The Car
dinal are scheduled to face San Diego
State (6-0-1), a newcomer to the con
ference, and then No. 14 UCLA (4-2).
Both Southern California squads
promise to be dialed in after very suc
cessful starts to their seasons.
If the Cardinal want to be in seri
ous contention fora title, they cannot
afford any more "lesson games" in
conference play. Still, as the team de
velops there may be some more
aches, pains and bruises along the
way. But if the Nike Invitational was
any indication, this team is ready to
take on all challenges.
