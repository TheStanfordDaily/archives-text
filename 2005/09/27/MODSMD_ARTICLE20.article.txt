# Men notch back-to-back shutouts over weekend
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team (3-4-1) ex
perienced the growing pains of two excruciat
ing losses in the Bay Area Classic 10 days ago
but turned around and had a coming-of-age
party this weekend in the Stanford-Nike Invita
tional defeating Army 2-0 and then taking
down UAB 1-0.
The trouble started Sept. 16 when Stanford
drove down Route 101 to take on perennial
powerhouse No. 12 Santa Clara (5-2-0). De
spite being outshot 15-2, Stanford held a 1-0
'ead until the 86th minute, when the Broncos
finally struck.
With the scote now knotted at 1 -1. the game
went into an extra-frame, but the momentum
had completely swung in Santa Clara's favor
and the Broncos scored the game winner in the
97th minute.
The near-upset drained the young Cardinal

team for its next match against USF (4-2-1).
San Francisco spoiled Stanford's home opener,
thoroughly outshooting the Cardinal 15-5. The
Dons scored first on and held onto the goal lead
by shutting down Stanford's offense for most of
the 90-minutes.
Evident in both losses was a lack of execu
tion in the attacking half for the Cardinal.
"I don't think we can play |for only| one
goal." head coach Bret Simon said." We need to
be more efficient in our finishing. I'd like to see
us be more purposeful when we get to the at
tacking part of the field. But we've made some
good steps."
Ihe hangover did not last into the next
week, however,as the Stanford offense found
its groove at Maloney Field. The Cardinal
played host to California (7-0-1). Army (1 -8-
0). UAB (5-3-0) and the Stanford Nike Invi
tational.
