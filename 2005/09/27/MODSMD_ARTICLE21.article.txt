# Eternal Optimist
## Mediocrity looms without more wins 
### 
The Stanford Football team's loss to
UC-Davis opened up a Pandora's
box. Actually, in football terms it
was probably much worse than the open
ing of the mythical box.
Before this season, Stanford fans (in
cluding yours truly) optimistically pre
dicted that disciplinarian Walt Harris
would turn around the Cardinal football
program. While most media writers
placed the Cardinal ninth or 10th in the
Pacific 10 Conference, some offered hope
by labeling Stanford with terms such as
"dark horse" or "surprise team."
The Cardinal win against Navy dis
counted those expectations a bit as the
Cardinal struggled with Navy's option of
fense. Still, the offense looked sharp and
crisp, and it looked as if the team was
showing some improvement. If the team
gradually improved throughout the sea
son, a six-win campaign seemed plausible.
However, all of the fears and insecuri
ties Cardinal fans have harbored over the
past three years regarding the football
program were put on display in the ago
nizing loss against Davis. The overreac
tions to the game ranged from the "no
more football games for me this season"
to "Stanford should drop its football pro
gram" to "I knew we should have hired
Norm Chow." And ESPN ranked us as the
fifth worst team in the country. Ouch.
I've heard that this loss was a manifes
tation of all the problems with Stanford
football. That anything from relatively
higher admission standards to the inabili
ty to recruit junior college players and a
reluctance to spend big money on
coaches have left the Cardinal in
capable of fielding a winning pro
gram.
At the risk of ending up face
down at the bottom of Lake Lag,
sleeping with the metaphorical
fishes, I do think this argument
explains why the Cardinal have
failed to become a consistent win
ner over the past two decades but
it does not explain the Davis
game.
My take on the game is that it
was just poorly played by every
one involved. The coaches were
out-coached, the defense missed
tackles, and I won't even get into
the offense. I was impressed by
the way that a dejected coach
Harris took responsibility for the
loss. On the whole, the loss
seemed fluky to me, and I think
the Cardinal can play much better
than they did against the Aggies.
Two possibilities can arise from
the loss: one, the Cardinal lose
confidence and endure another
mediocre season; or two, they get
angry and turn around their sea
son. I'm not even going to consid

er the first option because Stan
ford really can't afford to consid
er it. Nor do I think Walt Harris
will let them.
After thirty lines, I'm finally
getting to the point of this col
umn: the Cardinal need to put to
gether a winning season or at least
be considered a rising program by
the end of this year. The future of
the program depends on it.
With another losing season, the
Cardinal lose even more rele
vance on the national football
scene. Attendance is low and it
would only get worse without a
glimmer of hope. The thought of
Stanford's shining new stadium
receiving the tarp treatment
should scare anyone with a shred
of care for the football program.
Any team with five consecutive
losing seasons can be considered a
bottom basement team. Such
teams and programs tend to be
the butt of cruel jokes and carry
with them the tag of mediocrity.
Think of the Cincinnati Bengals in
the mid-19905. This means Stan
ford needs a winning season soon,
preferably this year to give the
program a strong push into its
new home.
The season essentially starts
this Saturday against Oregon.The
game will give us an insight into
the character of the team and how

it will recover after the Davis fias
co. It will let us know if the team is
actually improving. It may be the
most important game in the sea
son and is certainly winnable.
While Oregon has looked im
pressive early in the season, it has
endured a rough schedule recent
ly. The Ducks played a tough
game against Fresno State and
were demoralized by a USC team
that simply dominated them in the
second half of the game season.
Regardless, Oregon is the
heavy favorite to win, meaning
the Cardinal will need to play
with perfection. It means that the
offensive line will need to contain
the beastly Haloti Ngata. It means
that receivers cannot drop balls. It
means no muffed punts or inter
ceptions in the red zone.
I would also expect the Cardi
nal to need a big run, a deep pass
and an interception or a fumble
recovery to win. I don't care if the
Cardinal play the ugliest game of
their lives and win 13-6 or if they
play a 49-45 shootout.
They just need to find a way to
close Pandora's Box this week
end.
