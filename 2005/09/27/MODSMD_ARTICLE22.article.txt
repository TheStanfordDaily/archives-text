### ELIZABETH AGUILAR MANAGING EDITOR 
With four Pacific-10 Conference
teams taking a bye, the schedule for Pac
-10 schools was light this past weekend.
While four teams are still waiting for
their first conference match-ups. No. 1
Southern California (3-0. 1-0). No. 13
California (4-0,1-0) and No. 18 Arizona
State (3-1, 1-0) took advantage of the
weekend to pump up their records.
ASU rolls over Oregon State, 42-24
The Sun Devils scored four unan

swered touchdowns in the third quarter
to beat the Beavers (2-2, 0-1) Saturday
night in Corvalis. Ore. Junior quarterback
Sam Keller led the charge, throwing for
365 yards and four touchdowns passes,
two which found senior wide receiver
Derek Hagan. Hagan also notched 11 re
ceptions.
Though OSU tallied 525 yards on of
fense to ASU's 475, the Beavers six
turnovers proved costly, and the closest
they came to the Devils was an 11 -point dif
ference in the second and third quarters.
With the win, ASU sits in third place in
league standings while OSU finds itself sec

ond to last.
USC prevails, 45-13, over
No. 24 Oregon
For the thousands of Ducks (3-1,0-1)
fans in Eugune, Ore., ttie first-half of Sat
urday s tilt provided a reason to cheer:
senior quarterback Kellen Clemens and
the offense were up 13-0, and the home
squad went into the locker room leading
13-10.
But USC's senior quarterback Matt
Leinhart made up for his first-half woes to
finish 23-for-39 with 315 yards and
three touchdowns. The Trojans put
up 21 points in the third quarter and
14 more in the fourth, while the
Duck's offense seemed to fade. Ju
nior running back Reggie Bush
caught one touchdown and ran an
other in to help his team towards its
25th consecutive win.
No. 16 Notre Dame beats
Washington, 36-17
Notre Dame (3-1) built an early
lead off a field goal in the first quar
ter and just kept building on it to
beat Washington (1-3,0-1), which re
mains in the cellar of the Pac-10
standings. Junior quarterback Brady
Quinn compiled 327 yards and one
touchdown, while the rush attack
worked just as well for the Fighting
Irish.
Mistakes made early on by the

Huskies — a fumble and end-zone
interception — resulted in two
Notre Dame scores in the first half.
Adding to the frustration, former
Stanford football coach Ty Willing
ham, now with Washington, was de
feated by the squad he coached last
season.
Golden Bears pummel
New Mexico State, 41-13
Though California wasn't com
pletely satisfied with the way it
played against underdog New Mexi
co State (0-4), the Golden Bears left
Las Cruces, N.M., with an unblem
ished record and first-place in the
Pac-10 standings. Junior quarterback
Joe Ayoob ran for three touchdowns
and completed a touchdown pass for
the night
The Aggies narrowed the margin
to 10 points (20-10) at the end of the
first quarter, and a 94-yard kickoff re
turn by freshman runningback Chris
William upset the Golden Bears. But
NMS could only manage a field goal
in the second half and finished with
342 total offense yards to Cal's 595.
