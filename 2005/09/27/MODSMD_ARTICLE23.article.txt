# NCAA champions return to the court

### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
With 11 stellar players on the roster and a record 14
NCAA championship titles, the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team has the expected rosy prospects
for the upcoming season. And the expected chaos.
The transition period between summer break and
extensive fall training presents a perennial challenge for
the Cardinal players, especially those recovering from
an exhaustive post-season run in May. Between work
ing three new teammates into the line-up and preparing
for October's upcoming ITA Ail-American tourna
ment, the tennis mavens strive to stay sane and start the
new season with a clean, injury-free slate.
Senior and two-time NCAA Singles Champion
Amber Liu, expresses the team sentiment that, more
than anything, they simply needed some time to rest and
recover. According to Liu, no one on the team toyed
with a heavy schedule over the summer.
Last season, Liu led the undefeated team to a 4-0
shutout over Texas in the NCAA final but was forced
to retire from the NCAA singles event with a shoulder
injury.
Just as active off the courts as she is on, Liu turned
her attention to academic endeavors, taking a summer
internship at Morgan Stanley.The La Mesa, Calif, native
had plans to compete in World Team Tennis in Turkey
but the two-week venue had to be cancelled after bomb
scares in the area.
But with the change of seasons upon the Cardinal,
veterans like Liu are already shaking the summer slump
and thinking ahead.
"We're excited NCAA's [are] at home this year," Liu
said. "We're all excited to get practicing."
Celia Durkin, a sophomore transfer from Harvard
College, has yet to experience the full impact of a Stan
ford University NCAA affair. She competed in the No.
2 singles slot during the Round of 16 in last year's
championship run. Stanford's Alice Barnes, a senior,
was leading 6-1,4-0. before Durkin was retired. Durkin
ended her collegiate tennis cameo vear, ranked at No.
114.
Stanford head coach Lele Forood is already confi
dent about Durkin's potential.
"She will be playing qualifying singles and doubles in
the upcoming ITA tournament," Forood said. "She
[also] won some awards last year in the Ivy League."

The Stanford women's tennis feom is poised to leap to its fourth national cham
pionship in five years as it opens its season at the All-American.
The prestigious Ail-American
tournament, which takes place in
Pacific Palisades. Calif., places the
season's first national singles and
doubles titles up for grabs.
Jessica Nguyen, a freshman from
Chatsworth, Calif., is also up to the
challenge.
"She's been number one in the
SoCal juniors' [circuit] forever now,
and always top-10 in the US rank
ings in singles," Forood said.
Meghan Doheny, also a fresh
man, is not scheduled to appear at
the Ail-American, saving her debut
for later this year.
For sophomore Lejla Hodzic.the
upcoming weeks are expected to be
a test for her ankle, which she
sprained late last season.
"She wouldn't claim she's 100
percent yet," Forood said. "She's still
playing a little short physically, so
we're just hoping that this thing con
tinues to get better and she can play
at All-American."
Last year Hodzic spent a lot of
time as the seventh player in an im
penetrable six-woman starting line
up. When asked whether she would
move up in the ranks this year,
Forood responded with a blend of
apprehensive optimism.
"I hope so," she said. "But as you
know we've got a lot of people."
