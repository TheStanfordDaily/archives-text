# Students question grade inflation policy
## 
### DAISY CHUNG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A year has passed since Princeton University
launched its initiative to curb grade inflation,
and the figures are in: the number of students
who receive "A+,""A" or "A-" grades has fallen
to 41 percent, stated a release from the college's
Faculty Committee on Grading.
Princeton's success with this policy will in
evitably cause peer institutions, like Stanford,
to examine their own grading policies and pro
cedures.
According to an article published by the
Associated Press, the ultimate goal of the pol
icy at Princeton is to restore the integrity of
the grading system across the university.
Many faculty members were concerned with
the prevalence of "easy A's" and misrepre
sented GPAs. The policy aims to reduce the
number of students who receive A-range
grades to 35 percent.
While no official. University-wide policy is
in place at Stanford, students and faculty have
duly noted that such a measure may not be far
beyond the horizon.
"My own view is that grades should be indi
cators of an absolute, not a relative, level of per
formance," wrote Education Prof. Ed Haertel in
an e-mail to The Daily. "Students who come to
Stanford are extraordinarily talented. A very
high percentage arrives with 4.0 grade point av
erages from their time in high school. 1 don't see
the sense in 'creating an artificial scarcity of suc
cess' by capping the proportion of A grades.
Grade inflation may be viewed as a reflection of
the fact that over the years, students have be
come more efficient knowledge workers."
Many professors at Stanford do not base
their grades on strict percentages and curves.

"Each student's grade
represents my judgment
as to the degree to which
that iridividual's papers,
exams and class contribu
tions have met my expec
tations," Haertel wrote.
The proportion of A's,
B's, etc., is not a consider
ation."
At Princeton, the
grade inflation policy ere

ated a divide in opinion between
the faculty and students. When it
was announced last fall, student leaders op
posed its implementation, arguing that it would
create more academic competition and in
crease the difficulty of finding jobs.
In a statement to the Associated Press,
Nancy Malkiel,the dean of Princeton Universi
ty's undergraduate division, said that the grade
inflation policy had not in fact created any of
these problems. However, the student govern
ment at Princeton has announced that it will be
conducting its own study to determine the poli
cy's consequences.
Senior Jenny Dawson, a double-major in bi
ology and American studies, expressed her con
cerns about grading at Stanford.
"In techie classes where it's more numbers
grading I always feel like it's voodoo magic con
verting your test percentages into grades," she
said. "You never have any idea what the per
centages mean until the letter grades show up in
Axess."
Dawson said she really couldn't say whether
grade inflation was a problem though, because
hardly anyone at Stanford discusses their
grades.
Other students said they feel that many pro

fessors do not frequently give out A's.
"If you do your homework and get above the
average on the midterms and finals, you're not
going to get lower than a B," said senior Dan
Blatnik, an electrical engineering major."But at
the same time, it's really hard to get an A. I don't
think professors mind handing out B's, and I bet
they have a system in place so that the number
of A's comes out roughly the same every time."
The prospect of a grade inflation policy also
raised concerns about possible effects on the
academic atmosphere at Stanford.
"Having a system like that would make stu
dents more competitive with each othersaid
junior Rachel Buehler, a human biology major.
"I've taken chemistry classes where a lot of peo
ple are struggling, and we all try to help each
other out. I don't know if people would still be
as willing to do that if they knew they were com
peting fora limited number of A's."
Sophomore Kevin Choo, a biology major,
agreed that competition would increase if such
a policy were implemented.
"Especially in classes where it's project
based, 1 don't even know how you only give 35
percent of the students A's," he said. "What if
everyone does a great job?"
