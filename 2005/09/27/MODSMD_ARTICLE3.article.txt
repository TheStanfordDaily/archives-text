# Admission dean looks toward future
## Richard Shaw plans broad, national outreach 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO DESK EDITOR 
Stanford University's new Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Richard Shaw has several innova
tive plans in store for the admissions
process, but said he feels it's impor
tant to get acquainted with the Uni
versity before implementing any
major alterations.
"My first intent is to keep my ears
and my eyes open," Shaw said in an
interview with The Daily "My objec
tive, at least initially, is to get a good
sense of the place, to get a strong un
derstanding of all of the things that
Stanford represents."
Shaw, who has 33 years of experi
ence working in undergraduate ad

missions and was previously the
dean of admission and financial aid
at Yale University, took his post
three weeks ago after Robin Mam
let stepped down from the position
at the end of the 2004-2005 academ
ic year.
While Shaw said that time will be
needed for him and his staff to eval
uate what needs improving, he said
he feels that one area that he intends
to work on is national outreach.
"The reality in this is that Stan
ford is an extraordinary institution,"
Shaw said. "The objective is just to
bring the truth about this place to all
of these communities and to take
advantage of all of the exceptional
constituents that we have as far as
carrying the word."
One strategy that Shaw hopes to
implement is to have students take
part in recruiting activities when
they are home on vacation.
"Undergraduates should be in
volved in representing Stanford

both here and in their communi
ties," he said. "There's nobody more
powerful and more convincing than
someone who goes to school here."
Freshman Vivian Chen agreed
with Shaw's approach to outreach.
"There's no substitute for an ac
tual student that people can relate
to," she said.
"Most importantly in all of this is
having a human touch," Shaw
added. "It's a matter of really com
municating effectively, really bring
ing Stanford to people in a human
way with warmth and truth and en
suring they have good information
when they make their final deci
sion."
Shaw further explained that fig
uring out how to promote outreach
also entails sizing up how other uni
versities entice freshmen.
"Part of the goal is to understand
the competition as well, and I have
some opportunity to do that since I
was the competition," he said. "I

think that I have a very strong sense
of the marketplace and that's a clear
asset for Stanford."
Even though more Stanford stu
dents come from California than
any other state, Shaw said that it's
important to continue focusing on
California while still marketing in
less represented areas.
"I don't want to discount in any
way the importance of California,"
he said. "But I do think we can do
some more effective work in other
parts of the country as well, where
we become more of a player relative
to other very competitive institu
tions."
Sophomore Emily Campbell
agreed with Shaw's emphasis on re
cruiting across the country.
"When I was looking at college
on the East Coast, I spoke to people
at Harvard and a lot of them weren't
even considering Stanford," she
said. "While at Stanford, many stu
dents were considering Harvard."

Shaw further explained that he
hopes to revamp the admissions
process by making it high-tech.
"All of our applications will now
be Web-based," he said. "Not only
the demographic information, but
all recommendations."
Nonetheless, Shaw emphasized
that many of the criteria fora stu
dent's admission will stay the same.
"We look for the same things

year-in, year-out," Shaw said.
"Strength of intellectual depth, the
things they do both inside and out
side of the classrooms, the rigor of
the experience they've been in
volved with, the context of where
they learn. All of these things will
continue to be part of our considera
tion."
In addition to placing Stanford's
applications on the internet, Shaw
hopes to place admission decisions
online like many other universities
do.
"1 remember mailing things to
Canada and they never arrived: in
ternationally, there's no other way to
communicate other than electroni
cally," he said. "1 believe that tech
nology is how students communi
cate. 1 get some disagreement about
it, but I think my objective is to have
a delivery system that's pretty imme
diate."
While most students agree that e
mail is one of the fastest and most ef
ficient ways to receive their admis
sions status, some still prefer the tra
ditional. stuffed envelope as their
first indication.
"1 would definitely not like to get
an e-mail instead of a packet," said
junior Ryan Tibshirani. "It's some
thing about receiving tangible

proof."
Campbell agreed with Tibshi
rani's perspective.
"It was really gratifying to get it in
the mail," she said. "I found it more
exciting than checking the ones on
line. But I understand how it'd be
more fair and quicker so that every
one gets their decision at the same
time."
Shaw also discussed the need to
evaluate Stanford's financial aid pol
icy, specifically with regards to Stan
ford's international students.
"Only a few schools in the coun
try are need-blind for international
students," Shaw said. "Stanford un
derstands the value of having a
completely need-blind policy, so
that's on the agenda. We have to
continue to provide opportunity
and not dismiss our responsibility
to a broad spectrum of socioeco
nomic status."
Shaw expressed his optimism
that a lot of hard work will be poured
into making improvements to the
entire admissions system.
"We have a whole new environ
ment," Shaw said, referring to the re
cent move of the Admissions' office
from Old Union to the Bakewell
building."lt maybe is representative
of a renewed interest in the work of
Admissions and Financial Aid and
Visitor Services. We've gotten very
strong support from the President
and the Provost and the Faculty
committee that advised this opera
tion."
