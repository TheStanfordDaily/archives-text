## Co-op restoration confronts delays 
### MARINA LIEBAN STAFF WRITER 
Moving in is never a fun task for
Stanford students. But, this year's
residents of Columbae had more to
deal with than overstuffed boxes
and lofting beds, as the co-op is, of
yet, not fully functional.
This past summer Columbae un
derwent a Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) renovation, in ac
cordance with a long-term housing
restoration project practiced by the
University. While the major con
struction improvements to the
house were completed in time for
the students' scheduled arrival, res
idents have been forced to live
without a fully functioning kitchen.
As part of the CIP renovation
project, Columbae's kitchen re
ceived a complete overhaul, includ

ing a new stove and oven. The new
appliances have yet to be inspected
and approved by the Santa Clara
County, and therefore remain unus
able by the Columbae residents.
Some students are concerned
about the lack of a stove in Colum
bae because the co-op's residents
are responsible for cooking their
own meals.
"This is a major issue because
we cook for ourselves in Colum
bae," said junior Eva Dehlinger, a
veteran Columbae resident. "With
out a stove, some 50 students aie
without a means to prepare most
meals."
Until the stove is approved for
use by the county, students will con
tinue to eat meals that can be
cooked in a microwave or on their

Stoves at Columbae remain unavailable for residential use until approved by Santa Clara County.
