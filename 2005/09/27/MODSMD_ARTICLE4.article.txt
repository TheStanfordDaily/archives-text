## Co-op restoration confronts delays 
### MARINA LIEBAN STAFF WRITER 
Moving in is never a fun task for
Stanford students. But, this year's
residents of Columbae had more to
deal with than overstuffed boxes
and lofting beds, as the co-op is, of
yet, not fully functional.
This past summer Columbae un
derwent a Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) renovation, in ac
cordance with a long-term housing
restoration project practiced by the
University. While the major con
struction improvements to the
house were completed in time for
the students' scheduled arrival, res
idents have been forced to live
without a fully functioning kitchen.
As part of the CIP renovation
project, Columbae's kitchen re
ceived a complete overhaul, includ

ing a new stove and oven. The new
appliances have yet to be inspected
and approved by the Santa Clara
County, and therefore remain unus
able by the Columbae residents.
Some students are concerned
about the lack of a stove in Colum
bae because the co-op's residents
are responsible for cooking their
own meals.
"This is a major issue because
we cook for ourselves in Colum
bae," said junior Eva Dehlinger, a
veteran Columbae resident. "With
out a stove, some 50 students aie
without a means to prepare most
meals."
Until the stove is approved for
use by the county, students will con
tinue to eat meals that can be
cooked in a microwave or on their

new outdoor grill.
"Tonight, we'll cook dinner, like
every other co-op," said junior
Samia Rogers, a Columbae staff
member. "The one difference is
that until the county approves our
stove, our dinners will be mostly
grilled, microwaved or cold. It's an
noying, but there's nothing to be
done except be creative and stay
optimistic."
In addition to the new kitchen,
the CIP renovation in Columbae
included a new laundry room, an
Americans with Disability Act ac
cessible ramp, a new computer
cluster, wireless internet and a new
raised-bed garden area.
"These projects are very ambi
tious and require a huge amount of
intensity to finish on time for stu
dent arrivals in the fall," said Alicia
Restrepo, manager of Housing
CIP. "It is not unusual in older row
houses and even dorms to find hid
den problems that must be correct
ed during a project. We are work
ing hard to complete those as
quickly as possible so as to mini
mize any disruption to this house."
Residents also expressed some
concern about the aesthetic
changes to Columbae.
"Other changes were less well
received for nostalgic reasons,"
Dehlinger said. "Two beautiful
wooden rooms were painted stark
white, the funky bathrooms were
renovated to a much more stan
dard type, there is no longer roof
access and the wooden 'Columbae'
sign was moved from the front of
the house to the south side."
Residents will also be living
without the house's deck, which
had to be ripped out due to a lack
of funds for its renovation.
Despite the problems that have
resulted, many remain respectful
of CIP and how the administrators
of the program tackled the project.
"CIP and the people at Hous
ing have been working amazingly
hard to get this house functioning
for us," Rogers said. "CIP people
have been collaborating with
members of Columbae over the
past several years to create a reno
vation plan that would bring
Columbae up to both legal code
and University standards, while
preserving the house's deeply root
ed history."
' CIP was able to preserve the
majority of murals painted inside
Columbae, as well as plant avoca
dos, rosemary and asparagus in the
new garden area outside of the
house, and not all residents are
concerned about losing the infa
mous Columbae spirit.
"No renovation project is ever
perfect," Rogers said. "But every
one has been trying and bit by bit
students are putting the old
Columbae personality back into
the new building."
