# Freshmen targeted for voter registration
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
In preparation for the upcom
ing California Special Election,
the ASSU has teamed up with the
Stanford Democrats to sponsor
student voter registration drives,
particularly for the freshman
class.
"The goal of the ASSU is to
serve the students," said senior
Aneto Okonkwo, vice president
of the ASSU. "When a group like
the Stanford Democrats wants to
get involved in something like
this, we're here to help them."
Together the two groups co
sponsored a postcard that was in
cluded in the freshman orienta
tion information packet remind
ing students to vote on Nov. 8.
They also gave each new student
a voter registration form, as well
as a Web site for online registra
tion.
Okonkwo pointed out that the
postcard encouraging students to
vote was not specifically connect
ed with any political campus
group.
"The ASSU is a non-partisan
group," he said. "We are not sup
porting a specific political party.
Rather, we're trying to help any
student group that needs it."
The ASSU reached out to the

Stanford Democrats specifically
because of the number of proj
ects planned by the organization,
Okonkwo said.
"The ASSU is giving each po
litical party on campus equal sup
port," said sophomore Margot
Isman. president of the Stanford
Democrats. "They're helping the
Democrats more just because we
are the group that is doing more,
and hence needs more support."
Isman said she approached
the ASSU for help early on.
"We've been planning our
'Get Out the Vote' campaign
since late July," she said. "I feel
that we have a particularly pas
sionate group this year, and we
wanted to get started as soon as
possible. We were willing to sacri
fice the name recognition of the
Stanford Democrats to make
people aware of the election is
sues and get registered."
The ASSU is also supporting
student voter registration sepa
rately from the Democrats in a
variety of ways. They plan to post
Facebook.com advertisements,
use the official ASSU Web site
for centralized registration and
provide voter registration forms
in the ASSU office, among other
information.
"I think it is important for the
ASSU to encourage voting because
it is their job to promote civic en
gagement and interest in quality-of
life issues," Isman said. "Voting is a
huge part of that."
The paperwork provided to
freshmen through their orientation
packets was meant solely to encour
age voter registration, not to en
dorse left-leaning positions on the
propositions in the special election,
Isman said.
Most of the freshmen inter
viewed remembered receiving the
flier reminding them to vote includ
ed in their information packet, but
none knew it was sponsored by the

ASSU and the Stanford Democrats.
Several students have already
registered to vote online through
the voter registration form provided
to them, although one admitted with
a chuckle that he registered as a Re
publican. Another registered to vote
after picking up a form in the Regis
trar's Office.
Some freshmen also remem
bered election fliers being handed
out and posted in White Plaza, al
though many were vague on exactly
what the posters said. Some have
even been approached about their
voting status online.
"I was asked to join the Stanford
Democrats on the Facebook," said
freshman Suzanne King.
Most said they would definitely
register in time to vote, although a
few pointed out that they wouldn't
be voting because they are still un
derage.
