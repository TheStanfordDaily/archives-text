## Facebook attracts employees Increasing number of students choose to drop out to join growing company 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Facebook.com founder
Mark Zuckerberg took some time
off from Harvard back in January
2004, he had no idea what a phe
nomenon his idea would become.
Today, with no plans to go back to
school anytime in the near future,
he is recruiting Stanford students
to follow in his footsteps.
"We're making a bunch of
money, so we're willing to hire as
many smart people as we can
find." Zuckerberg said, as he looks
to expand beyond his current team
of 40 workers.
Big bucks may await Stanford
engineers who want to work for
the Web site full-time, as several
Facebook.com employees are
making over $100,000 annually.
However, students who want to
continue to take classes at Stan
ford can earn $20 an hour, while
Facebook.com pays for their tu
ition.
The Web site's statistics are
staggering, as it breaks new traffic
records daily. Yesterday, the site
had a record 200 million hits by
8:30 p.m. and there were 325,000
users logged in at the same time.
The site has 4.5 million users at
2,027 schools.
Zuckerberg was eager to point
out his site's similarity to the $81-
billion-worth of Google, which he
estimated as receiving 200 to 250
million hits per day.
"People think ofFacebook.com
as a little site run by a couple of
college students, not as a compa
ny," he said.
Zuckerberg has been strolling
around White Plaza and the Gates
Computer Science Building talk to
students by recruiting around their
interests. He will be outside the
building today for the same pur
pose.
"When you join a start-up,
you're not in it for the money —
you're in it for the stock," he em
phasized. "Everyone who works
for us owns a part of the company
and if we ever go public, we could
be worth a lot."
Former Stanford graduate stu
dent Scott Marlette agreed with
this analysis. Marlette was a stu
dent in the Electrical Engineering
Department for nine months when
he decided to leave Stanford to go
work for Facebook.com.
"If I had waited 12 months to
join the company, the opportunity
would not be there," Marlette said.
"I am very happy with my deci
sion."
Among his considerations in
joining the Facebook.com team
were the small size of the company,
the equity, stock options, ability to
make an impact and good money.
Marlette also had offers from Mi
crosoft and Adobe, which were
monetarily comparable to his
Facebook salary, but without the
estimated value of his stock op
tions.
"There wasn't a whole lot moti
vating me to stay in school," Mar
lette said. "I feel like I've learned
more in my three months here
than my nine months at Stanford."
Zuckerberg said he is also
happy in his current school-less
state.
"I'm going to be taking a least a
couple more years off [from col
lege]," he said. "Now 1 have 40
people working for me. I can't real
ly just leave...it wouldn't be fair."
