## Sharon wins key party victory 
### STEVE WEIZMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon survived a
major challenge to his leadership in
the party he helped found, narrowly
claiming victory yesterday in a vote
widely seen as a referendum on his
rule and the recent withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip.
The victory capped a dramatic
comeback for Sharon, who has been
vilified by Likud Party hard-liners
for the Gaza pullout and who had
been trailing in recent opinion polls.
Sharon's supporters said the victory
meant the prime minister would
push forward with his peace efforts.
"The argument over whether or
not Sharon's vision was the Likud's
vision is over with this vote." Roni
Bar-On, a pro-Sharon lawmaker,
told Israel Radio.
Monday's vote by the 3,000-mem
ber Likud central committee was os
tensibly over a procedural issue:
whether to hold elections for party
leader in April, as scheduled, or
move up the primary to November.
But Sharon and his main rival. Ben
jamin Netanyahu, said the ballot
amounted to a vote of confidence in
the prime minister.
Netanyahu, who accused Sharon
of abandoning the hawkish Likud
Party's nationalist roots by carrying
out the withdrawal, pushed for an
early primary to capitalize on anger
against the prime minister. Sharon

opposed any change.
Likud members voted 1.433 to
1.329 — a margin of just 104 votes —
in favor of keeping the schedule in
tact, according to official results an
nounced just after midnight.Turnout
was 91 percent. As the results be
came apparent, Sharon's supporters
at the site of Monday's vote popped
open champagne bottles and danced
in celebration.
Netanyahu, a former prime min
ister, conceded defeat Monday in the
52-48 percent vote, but said he would
continue his campaign to oust
Sharon. He said the close vote
showed that the party remains bit
terly divided, with many members
opposed to Sharon's concessions to
the Palestinians.
"I expect to see this camp with all
its force when it fights for the path of
the Likud in the primaries and I have
no doubt in the second phase we will
win and the Likud will win," Ne
tanyahu said.
Uzi Landau, another prominent
opponent of Sharon, said it was now
up to the prime minister to unify the
party. "If lie wants, it will be unified.
If he continues his past practices, it
will not."
Sharon did not immediately react
to the vote. As he cast his ballot ear
lier Monday, he warned that the
early elections proposal would
"badly harm the Likud."
Sharon confidants said that with a
defeat, he likely would have quit
Likud and competed in general elec

tions as Ihe head of a new centrist
party. Such a run hy Sharon, who is
popular among the Israeli general
public, would strengthen the politi
cal center, pushed Likud to the polit
ical fringe, and likely improve

chances of a Mideast peace deal.
Sharon has expressed hope that
the Gaza withdrawal could lead to a
resumption of peace talks, and he has
voiced support for an independent
Palestinian state.
