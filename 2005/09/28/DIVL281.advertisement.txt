KAONOS TIME REPORTING IN AV€SS
If you have an hourly part-time job(s) on campus,
you'll probably use the Kronos online timecard to report hours worked.
Since reporting hours worked is the way you get paid tor your part-time work, here's the
scoop: in Axess, go to the Employee Intormation Tab. Click the link to login to Kronos.
• If you're on a PC, download Java 1.4.2, 06 (if you don't already have it) from the
Essential Stanford Software site: (http://ess.stanford.edu).
• If you're on a Mac running less than OS 10.3.7, you must do system updates to get the
correct version of Java. Note: Macs must use the Safari browser.
• If you use Unix or Linux, go to a cluster to report hours worked or ask your supervisor
about another work station.
Once you have Java on your computer, login using your SUNet ID and password.
Note: Students who do not work in hourly, part-time jobs do not use Kronos; this
applies to postdoctoral scholars, graduate students with assistantships, and students
receiving financial aid where there is no hourly, part-time job.
To learn about time reporting
• Ask your supervisor how you are expected to report your hours so you can get paid;
if Kronos is not used, perhaps a department system is used that feeds into Kronos.
• Review the FAQs, an online tutorial, or print step-by-step instructions from:
http://kronostraining.stanford.edu
