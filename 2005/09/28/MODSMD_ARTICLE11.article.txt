## The 						Insiders Seniors' brush with NSO 
### ROBIN PAM MIRI HUTCHERSON 
As a cynical, self-preserving senior, it
is perhaps the wisest course to stay
indoors on the first day of New Stu
dent Orientation. Save yourself the embar
rassment of having someone ask you where
Braun Flail is, only to find that you're not
sure which one is Braun Mall and which one
is Braun Auditorium. It has taken you three
years to realize that Stanford really is as con
fusing as it looks.
Last week, on the aberrantly un-sunny
day of Convocation, the freshmen flooded
campus and rapidly embraced it. On the flip
side, we wandered around the freshman-in
fused campus in borrowed rain jackets and
felt old, wet and out of place. A "Welcome to
Stanford" sign dripped red paint in the rain
as if painted in fresh blood.
We're still not sure whether the sign, the
freshmen or the parents made us feel more
morbid. Or maybe we can still taste the bit
terness left over from Stanford's rejection of
our Orientation Volunteer applications. Per
haps that's why we were determined to get
as much as possible out of this year's NSO.
We wandered toward the bike shop.
Mothers spray-painted their daughters'
bikes blue with pink polka dots. "It's so that
the thieves don't steal 'em," one mother ex
plained. The daughters yapped on their cell
phones at a distance. We weren't sure
whether they were avoiding the fumes or
their mothers.
Today's micromanaging parents seem
concerned first and foremost with bicycle
safety. We kept our mouths shut about some
of the more pressing issues they might want
to consider. With 10 quarters in co-ops be
tween us, bike-stealing seems like a minor
issue compared to rats in the kitchen and se
rial gropers. It might be a good sign that as
real as these threats are, they seem more hu
morous than ominous.
Just as we were feeling too tired and judg
mental to go on, the friendly folk at the Of
fice for Religious Life table saved us from
the rain.They proudly displayed their wares,
the only practical bike-safety objects of
fered during the whole day. "Come reflect

with us," begged the pant-leg reflectors.
"Drink deep from the well of the spirit," sug
gested the water bottles, superfluous on a
rainy day. We think they were exaggerating
when they said it took all year to come up
with the slogans; but even if they weren't,
the time was well worth it.
The sky wasn't clearing any, but our
moods were looking up as we ducked out of
the rain and into the closing remarks of the
"Letting Go" panel for parents. We chewed
on Hillel's honey sticks in the back row of
Dinkelspiel Hall. The panelists shared ad
vice and sympathy with the new crop of po
tential donors to The Stanford Fund.
"Don't try too hard to always be in touch
with your young'n...Your child loves getting
mail...Plan a tailgate in LA for your Stan
ford freshman and his friends when Stan
ford plays USC...Get a dog — it's better
than an empty nest."
We're sorry that we ever used the word
cynical, much less meant it. Call your mom.
She loves you. We're not just saying that.
We have sat in the back of a room where
Stanford parents cried and fretted. We're
sure they were glad for the darkness
around the half-empty seats, a place where
they could sniffle without shaming their
children. We were certainly grateful for the
cover as our own eyes began to tear up. It
didn't matter that they were worrying
about things beyond their control. Their
children were already adjusting as the par
ents tried to let go.
All around the campus outside the audi
torium, the new students busily distracted
themselves with maps and registration
forms and contrived circles of storytelling.
Here, inside, their parents had nothing to
distract them from realizing that they had
reached the end of a longjourney,alone.The
advice was practical. It was good. But for us,
and maybe for them, it wasn't about advice.
It was about feeling alone and loved at the
same time. Knowing that the two don't can
cel each other out.
