## First impressions 
### 
When my high school friend Will
Powers, ranked fourth-best de
fensive football player in the na
tion, was admitted to Stanford last January,
I was happy for his fate and the glorious be
ginning of his eventual destiny. The admis
sion ticket from Stanford worked some
thing like a human sieve; it separated the
richer, lyckier, smarter, generally more
competent members of society from the
rest of the masses.
Never did I predict that a couple of
months later. Will and I would end up in the
same lot. I thought that most American col
leges, like those adult-dating Web sites, are
generally more favorable to bulky Cau
casian football-player types than bespecta
cled Asian nerds. But I was wrong; the ad
missions officer, while congratulating me in
a phone call, claimed that he liked my writ
ing. That was the first time that anything
positive was said about me by someone
other than my psychiatrist; it made my day.
People attend Leland Stanford Junior
University for various reasons, almost all of
which can be summarized by the Monetary
Reason. None of that "intellectual ad
vancement and personal growth" crap.

Yeah, yeah, the Farm is full of interesting
personality types: the Covert Overachiev
er, the Slacker-Wannabe, the Universal
Philanthropist, the Political Fanatic, the
Egomaniac, the Dating Freak — but no
one upsets me more than the Faux-Intellec
tual. An intellectual is something that no
one wants to be but everyone pretends to
be. To grad students working their spleens
off in late-night laboratories, the Stanford
diploma promises brilliant futures in the
same way that Communism did for the
Russian proletariat. People want to discov
er Stanford the same way that Abraham
wanted to discover the Promised Land —
promises of earning a six-digit salary, dating
a Carmen Electra look-alike, driving a
Porsche, and becoming the King of the
World. Hey, whether or not the rainbow is a
sign of divine covenant doesn't matter;
what matters more is whether or not there
is a pot of gold at the ends of it. After all,
isn't that why you all chose Stanford over
other colleges? You can get drunk any
where, so why here?
During Orientation, I found myself an-
noyed by the explanation of the
Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code, and then exasperated
by the utterances of regret by viola
tors. In high school, the observation
of our honor code mirrored that of
Hitler's Munich Treaty. Every big
exam, the value of the code depre
ciated drastically — like the Ger
man currency after World War 11.
But here at Stanford, these issues,
as if affected by the Laws of Gravi
ty, apparently take on a more seri
ous twist. The various violators of
the Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard enjoyed the pleasure of
sharing their epitaphs with us:"I am
sorry for driving my car off the cliff
while drunk.""! am sorry for letting
myself get caught while cheating."
"I am sorry for getting myself into a
one-quarter suspension." "I am
sorry for getting myself expelled
from Stanford so that I can't make
tons of dough anymore." Yes, I feel
sorry for you too.

Let's talk about something more
optimistic. For years, I thought that
attractive females at Stanford were
like an endangered species. But on
one of these days of Orientation, a
tall, extremely attractive blonde —
who looked like a mix between
Cameron Diaz and Uma Thurman
— brushed past me, leaving my
mind writhing in a trance. Of
course, I know that the probability
of me ever meeting her can be cal
culated by nanotechnology, and the
reasons are simple: I am neither
ripped nor rich, nor am I connected
to Donald Trump by blood or mar
riage. But this clinging to even the
most miniscule chance, like Jay
Gatsby glancing at the single green
light on Daisy Buchanan's man
sion. lights up the fire of optjmism
on the beacon of life. It is this fire
that has driven mortals onward, for
centuries past and for centuries
ahead, into the exaltation of spiritu
al immortality and the bliss of
human apotheosis.
