## First impressions

When my high school friend Will
Powers, ranked fourth-best de
fensive football player in the na
tion, was admitted to Stanford last January,
I was happy for his fate and the glorious be
ginning of his eventual destiny. The admis
sion ticket from Stanford worked some
thing like a human sieve; it separated the
richer, lyckier, smarter, generally more
competent members of society from the
rest of the masses.
Never did I predict that a couple of
months later. Will and I would end up in the
same lot. I thought that most American col
leges, like those adult-dating Web sites, are
generally more favorable to bulky Cau

People attend Leland Stanford Junior

which can be summarized by the Monetary

be. To grad students working their spleens
off in late-night laboratories, the Stanford
diploma promises brilliant futures in the
same way that Communism did for the
Russian proletariat. People want to discov
er Stanford the same way that Abraham
wanted to discover the Promised Land —
promises of earning a six-digit salary, dating
a Carmen Electra look-alike, driving a
Porsche, and becoming the King of the
World. Hey, whether or not the rainbow is a
sign of divine covenant doesn't matter;
what matters more is whether or not there
is a pot of gold at the ends of it. After all,
isn't that why you all chose Stanford over
other colleges? You can get drunk any
where, so why here?
During Orientation, I found myself an-
