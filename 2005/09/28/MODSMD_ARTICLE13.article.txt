# Joel Stein Weighs In
## Blast from the past: NSO '92 
### 
From the back, they all looked like my high-school
girlfriend. Stonewashed jeans with disturbingly se
ductive mini-zippers at the ankle. Hips swinging so
far they made Big Ben look like a metronome. And make
up. Lots of make-up. Make-up in non-earth tones. Almost
brought tears to my eyes.
But as much as I wanted to ask their best friends to ask
them out for me, I knew something was awry. There was a
queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach that I only remem
bered from King-King's Mu Shu Pork and that one time
when, while masturbating to an "Afterhours" Showtime
movie, I accidentally sat on the remote control, switching
the channel to C-SPAN, and saw Ross Perot at just the
wrong moment.
Stuck somewhere between my worst nightmare and my
most Nabokovian fantasy. I had ambled into some fresh
man Orientation party, staring at two post-adolescents in
size-6X midriff jackets and black lace bras Karaoking to
"Come on Eileen." And with her in that dress, oh. my
thoughts I confess — they were, well, dirty.
As soon as the first horrible, yet enticing thought about
reading one of them entendre-drenched parts of "Oh, the
Places We'll Go" entered my brain, I was filled with self
hatred. Slapping myself furiously — but avoiding the
monkey altogether — I ran out of the sticky, alcohol-free
frosh lair that was Lagunita.
Desperately searching Stern Hall for some sanity, and
maybe a nice slice of vegetarian, I sprinted through the
halls, my surrealistic nightmare continued as segue-des
perate as an episode of "Voyagers."
To my right, a girl stood in her room ironing a shirt.

Tired, confused, and trying to eye up the ironing board
for size and stability, I asked her what she was ironing a
shirt for.
She told me that it was a blouse, that it was for tomor
row, and that it was "wrinkled."
Staring at her, and her blouse, I had a vision. And then
I had another vision....
It was late November. The air was cool. Cool enough
to make my nipples hard. Or anyone's nipples hard, for
that matter. The blouse-girl was standing there in black
pumps, a denim mini-skirt and aqua-green, sparkly eye
shadow. And the two Karaoke girls were there. And they
all looked at each other. And then they looked at them
selves. Then they screamed and ran to the GAP.
Waking up, I realized the taste of bile in my mouth was
from something besides sleeping. It was because I knew that
this was the awful end all my new Forenzaed friends would
face.
Before I knew it, they would be deciding between
cable-knit sweaters in charcoal heather and plum rose.The
irons would be packed away, the sexual tension would be
shot, and we could once again look at each other without
blushing. Or doing anything else for that matter.
Sad, dejected and able to picture nothing but brunettes
in purple turtlenecks, I ambled into Branner Hall. And it
was there that this whole freshman thing got me madder
than that little turban guy who was always foiled by Letter-
Man.
Three freshmen were in the lobby. Bags under their
