Cardinal football needs coaching
that understands intelligence of
its athletes
In recent years, the performances
of some Cardinal teams have seen
precipitous declines after a coaching
change.This may have to do with the
arrival of coaches who are unpre
pared for the athletes they will en
counter here. This all culminated
with the loss to UC-Davis' Division
I-AA football team on Sept. 17. It is
important that the Cardinal coaches
understand the student-athletes

they are coaching, and that the stu
dent-athletes understand what they
need to do in order to win.
High school athletes who want to
attend Stanford face admission re
quirements similar to those of other
applicants. The average freshman
here had a high school CPA of 3.9,
with math and verbal SAT scores
that were each above 70(). One can
say that the average Cardinal is quite
smart. Of course, overall intelligence
has little to do with attributes like
size, speed and strength, and only
about 5 per cent of high school ath

letes in major sports are good
enough to play them at the college
level. Stanford is faced with the
added challenge of finding that rare
high school athlete who is both real
ly good at sports and really smart.
Further, that rare athlete must
also want to come to Stanford. If you
are really good at sports, would you
even want to come to Stanford?
Your odds of being part of a nation
al championship-winning team may
be much better at a school that does
not have the academic requirements
of Stanford, and that can therefore
put together teams composed of stu
dents who are in the 99th-percentile
athletically.
This raises the question: How did
Stanford win the Sears Directors'
Cup year after year? The answer lies
in the coaches who understand how
to get the most out of the academic
and athletic talents of their players.
This strategy also requires that the
Stanford student-athletes under
stand that their intelligence is what
will allow them to win games. A sim
ple game plan is bound to fail. The
other teams will have bigger players.
The other teams will have faster

players. The other teams will have
stronger players. But, this does not
matter if one has properly prepared.
When Stanford's football team lost
to UC-Davis, the student-athletes
and coaching staff looked quite un
prepared. Let us hope that this will
not be the case against Oregon.
