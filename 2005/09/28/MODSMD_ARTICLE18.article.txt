Stanford women's field hockey team last
defeated Pacific in Stockton, so last Sun

er Missy 1 lalliday and freshman midfield
er / forward Caroline Hussev.
According to Halliday, it was a special
victory for the Cardinal seniors because
the team hadn't beaten Pacific in several
seasons on the Tigers' home field.

day was especially important to us he
cause we haven't won against | Pacific] on
their field since [my) freshman year."
Halliday said. "For the team, it's another
game in our conference that we've won."
The Cardinal's win was their second
victory in their last three games. 1 lalliday
scored at 18:53 from a penalty corner with
an assist from junior defender/midfielder
.Aska Sturdevan. About five minutes
later, Hussey tallied the Cardinal's sec
ond goal.
"I was pretty excited about it,"
Richardson said. "When we scored. 1 was
screaming and jumping up and down.
That's true not only of me. but of the en
tire team."
Sophomore midfielder / forward Jes
sica Zutz indicated that the team is start
ing to feel more comfortable with itself
and is back on track after a rough start to
the season.
"As the season has moved on, we've
started to settle down," Zutz said. "We've
created a niche for ourselves, and now
that we know our roles, we're starting to
feel comfortable with ourselves."

a goal at 54:29, but the strong Cardinal de
fense refused to allow another goal. The
Tigers attempted nine shots in the second
half of the game, to no avail.
The members of the Stanford squad

Returning are Sturdevan. junior defend
er/midfielder Julia Drewes, junior mid
fielder Jaime Hais and senior captains
Tammy Shuer and Lyndsay Erickson.
"Both of our captains are defenders,"
Halliday said. "We have a lot of leader
ship in the back field and the bulk of our
defense has returned."
According to freshman midfielder/
defender Bailey Richardson, Sturdevan
was a key player in Sunday's game.
"Defensively, Aska did an excellent
job," Richardson said. "She doesn't let
anything get by her in the circle."
