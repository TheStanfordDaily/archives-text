## Cardinal women settling into a groove 
### ROHAN PURANIK 
It had been three seasons since the
Stanford women's field hockey team last
defeated Pacific in Stockton, so last Sun
day's 2-1 win against the Tigers (4-6) felt
particularly good. The Cardinal (3-8.0-1
Pacific-10Conference) beat their NorPac
rival, 2-1, with goals from senior midfield
er Missy 1 lalliday and freshman midfield
er / forward Caroline Hussev.
According to Halliday, it was a special
victory for the Cardinal seniors because
the team hadn't beaten Pacific in several
seasons on the Tigers' home field.
"Personally, I thought the win yester
day was especially important to us he
cause we haven't won against | Pacific] on
their field since [my) freshman year."
Halliday said. "For the team, it's another
game in our conference that we've won."
The Cardinal's win was their second
victory in their last three games. 1 lalliday
scored at 18:53 from a penalty corner with
an assist from junior defender/midfielder
.Aska Sturdevan. About five minutes
later, Hussey tallied the Cardinal's sec
ond goal.
"I was pretty excited about it,"
Richardson said. "When we scored. 1 was
screaming and jumping up and down.
That's true not only of me. but of the en
tire team."
Sophomore midfielder / forward Jes
sica Zutz indicated that the team is start
ing to feel more comfortable with itself
and is back on track after a rough start to
the season.
"As the season has moved on, we've
started to settle down," Zutz said. "We've
created a niche for ourselves, and now
that we know our roles, we're starting to
feel comfortable with ourselves."

a goal at 54:29, but the strong Cardinal de
fense refused to allow another goal. The
Tigers attempted nine shots in the second
half of the game, to no avail.
The members of the Stanford squad
note that their defense is a strong asset.
Returning are Sturdevan. junior defend
er/midfielder Julia Drewes, junior mid
fielder Jaime Hais and senior captains
Tammy Shuer and Lyndsay Erickson.
"Both of our captains are defenders,"
Halliday said. "We have a lot of leader
ship in the back field and the bulk of our
defense has returned."
According to freshman midfielder/
defender Bailey Richardson, Sturdevan
was a key player in Sunday's game.
"Defensively, Aska did an excellent
job," Richardson said. "She doesn't let
anything get by her in the circle."

tory as a member of the Stanford
squad.
"Sarah played awesome,"
Richardson said. "[She] was just real
ly talented and stepped up."
The team is currently 3-8 but has
recently shown signs of improve
ment, dropping a bO heartbreaker to
California (4-6, 1-1) in between two
wins — with several players taking
on strong roles.
"We started the season out with a
couple of hard games," Richardson
said. "We had tough opponents and
we had some rough losses, but re
cently we're solidifying who we are

as a team. We're coming together as a
team and everything's starting to
click."
And after playing 11 games to
gether this season, the team has
worked together to understand each
other better. According to Halliday,
the team has been focusing on sever
al tactics to improve game play.
"We've been working on the in
and-out play," Halliday said. "Cor
ners have been a huge focus — in
games, we've scored well off of our
corners."
The team looks forward to its up
coming game — a rematch against
Pacific — and hopes to attract stu
dent support for the game this Satur
day.
"Hopefully the student body will
realize that field hockey is the next
best thing to ice hockey, so hopefully
they'll show up and watch," Zutz said.
