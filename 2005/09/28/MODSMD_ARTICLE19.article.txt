# Volleyball cruises to 12th straight win
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI 
With six Pacific-10 Conference schools currently
ranked in the nation's top 25, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team (13-1,2-0 Pac-10) needs any help it can get to
win the team's first league title since 2001.
Therefore, it's good for the squad to know that it next
meets Oregon State (5-3,1 -1), a team that is still adjusting
to a new coaching staff. It's also good to know that the No.
3 Cardinal should be riding the momentum of knocking
out No. 19 Southern California and No. 17 UCLA at
Maples Pavilion this past weekend.
It also won't hurt to keep in mind that the Cardinal's
all-time record against the Beavers stands at 40-0.
But don't bother telling any of that to the players —
they only know that they cannot take this upcoming con
test lightly.
"We've got to take it one match at a time," said fresh
man outside hitter Cynthia Barboza, who notched a ca
reer-high 26 kills in last Friday's match against IJSC. "It's
good to have these first Pac-10 matches under our belt, but
under no circumstances can we just ride off that through
the next few matches."
Hie Cardinal visit Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore. to
morrow evening. The Beavers' most recent victory came
in dramatic fashion last Saturday, when they recovered
from several major deficits to defeat Arizona State 3-2. In
game five of the match, the Beavers registered five kills
and committed no hitting errors.
Leading the charge for Oregon State is junior middle
blocker Brittany Cahoon, who possesses a .349 hitting
percentage and 82 season kills. Sophomore outside hitter
Kristin Murray also adds 74 kills and a .204 hitting per
centage.
The Beavers ranked last in the Pac-10 last season with
just 1.91 blocks per game. But the team has significantly
improved that mark this season by to an average of 2.5 per
game. The Cardinal currently averages 2.53 blocks per
game.
After tying with Arizona State for seventh place in the
Pac-10 last year, the Beavers hired experienced head
coach Taras Liskevych last April to rebuild the program.
I.iskevych coached three U.S. Olympic teams and served
as head coach at the I Jniversity of the Pacific for nine sea
sons.
Liskevych said his team would focus on developing its
own skills for the contest against the Cardinal.
" ITie match against Arizona State was a huge boost."
he said. "Stanford's a great team, and (Stanford head
coach John Dunning| is a good friend, so we look forward
to hosting them."

Richards, and freshman middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo are
once again being depended upon to
deliver several kills. Defense contin
ues to be another strength for the
Cardinal, with senior libero Court

game.
With a balanced team of fresh and
familiar faces, Stanford has been on a
roll as of late. Richards said that she is
adjusting well to the veteran position
on the team.
"Being an upperclassman is fun
and easy because everyone on our
team is so unbelievable and such
good friends with each other," she
said."l'm just trying to fill in the spot

of leader and good friend — whatev
er I can do for the team."
Barboza attributed much of the
team's success so far to good chem
istry. which she said brings contribu
tions from throughout the roster.
"We are all such good friends off
the court that the chemistry trans
lates on the court," she said. "Our
depth is exciting because we have
people coming up with big plays out
of all positions."
