# NSO called a success by frosh, organizers
## Dorm themes and musical performances highlight NSO 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
Over the past few days, students saw
younger versions of themselves running
around campus, looking for the Bookstore,
the bike shop and the closest dining hall.
The new Stanford Class of 2009 is just start
ing to familiarize itself with its new home.
New Student Orientation (NSO) in
cludes an array of activities, icebreakers,
and information sessions designed so Stan
ford's newest students could find their
bearings before beginning their careers on
the Farm.
For many freshmen, NSO seemed to
have done its job.
"My favorite part of NSO was the Band
Run," said freshman Chris Marinelli, a Loro
resident who hails from Massachusetts. "It
was real crazy and the whole atmosphere
was real familiar to me."
"[The best part of NSO was] discovering

and enjoying the benefits of dorm food
aka, eating fried potatoes at every meal,"
joked Rinconada resident Kira Greco, from
New York.
Several students enjoyed the Universi
ty's showcase of its talent.
"I really loved the O Show," Cory
Robinson, a Texas girl who lives in Rin
conada, said. "We didn't have acapella
groups at my high school, so I'm just
amazed at the talent that some of these stu
dents possess."
In particular, she said the Fleet Street
Singers and Everyday People were "just
ridiculously awesome."
While it seemed that most of the new
bies had a great time throughout the week,
some students were less than smitten with
NSO's scheduling.
"Waking up at 7 a.m. for my foreign lan
guage placement test, which I bombed, was
the worst part," said Joseph Arredondo,
from Livingston, California.
"My least favorite part was simply the
fact that it was nonstop," said Marinelli. "I
found myself struggling to go to even half
the events...it was overwhelming."

On the upside, freshman dorm themes
are one of the popular conversation topics
amongst many new students.
"My favorite dorm theme was probably
nearby Palomasaid Loro's Marinelli. "It
adhered to many names: 'Paloma Hilton,'
'Palomaston Kutcher,' etc. Very clever."
Dorm pride was also a perennial ele
ment of freshman year, especially since dor
mitories attended various functions togeth

er, usually bellowing their dorm cheers and
swinging colorful flags.
"We rock," said Otero resident Tommy
Liu, who hails from Ohio. "We are seriously
the best dorm!"
Some of his peers disagreed.
"Basically, Rinconada takes the cake,"
Greco said.
