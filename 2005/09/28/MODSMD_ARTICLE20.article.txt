# Another Perspective
## For some, one rivalry just doesn't cut it 
### 
At Stanford, we can hardly keep our
selves from comparing — comparing
ourselves to those around us, and fur
ther, comparing ourselves, as an institution, to
other schools. With innocent comparison,
though, naturally comes competition, and with
a few more necessary features, comes rivalry.
On the Farm, when we hear the word "ri
valry," we automatically think Cal. We think
of Big Game, then we think of all the Big [in
sert any Cal-Stanford varsity athletic com
petition here] contests that we all love to cel
ebrate when we emerge victorious. At least,
that's what I seem to have been well trained
to think.
But here 1 am standing up to say that while
Big Game is admittedly big and it's just plain
fun to hate on Cal, our sports rivalry for the
modern day could just as well be against USC.
I understand rivalry must have history and the
short commute across the Bay has definitely
allowed our antagonism towards Cal to devel
op in the years since our inception. Still, at a
school of our stature in all aspects, must we
limit ourselves to just one rival?
If I were to ask random Stanford students
who they consider our current academic or
intellectual rival to be, would they not say
Harvard or another Ivy? But, this is a sports
column. Thus, similarly, when it comes to
modern athletic programs — and our rivalry
against Cal is, really, only an athletic rivalry
— I would honestly say that it is our "neigh
bor" to the South in the heart of Los Angeles
that fits the bill.
When I think of attributes necessary for
an institutional rivalry, I think of four fea
tures off hand. First of all, there absolutely
has to be a long-standing relationship be
tween two similar schools and their front
running programs. Considering that the first
football game played between our beloved
Cardinal and USC took place in 1905 and
that there have been 85 games played be
tween the two private university squads
since then, I think this requirement is easily
satisfied.
Secondly, each program should have a
reputation for success on the national stage.
Sure enough, from my observation, when
people around the nation think of collegiate
athletic powers on the West Coast, it's Stan
ford and USC, then UCLA and possibly Cal.
Again. I am not wishing to discount Cal as a
an unworthy foe, I am simply relying on my
gut feeling that Stanford should make more
out of its competition against the men and
women of Troy.
A third essential component of a
rivalry is a consistently even match
between teams from both schools.
While the overall historical football
record between USC and Stanford is
55-27-3 (referring solely to football,
only because it is the flagship sport
of most athletic programs) in favor
of the Trojans, 1 cannot help but be
lieve our 31-27 heart-wrenching de
feat at the hands of the powerful
USC squad a year ago is more in
dicative of recent times.
In fact, Stanford football had a
three-game winning streak against
USC as recently as 1999-2001. To

bring in other sports, Stanford men's
basketball has met the Trojans 226
times in their history, only to have
the series tied at 113 wins apiece. In
women's volleyball, Stanford holds a
commanding 43-17 lead in the all
time series against USC, though the
Trojans have won eight of the last 12
meetings, with most of the games
going back and forth.
The last necessary factor fora ri
valry that immediately comes to
mind is some sort of developed ani
mosity towards each other leading to
a heightened intensity during com
petition. Now, I'll have to admit, 1
don't exactly hate USC. In fact, I
cheered them on during my high
school days in Southern California,
but goodness, don't we all know fel
low students who have come to de
test the institution for any variety of
reasons?

Again, I respect the existing rival
ry between Stanford and Cal and I
don't hesitate fora second when I
have a chance to rub a Cardinal win
in the faces of Berkeleyans I know.
However, the power both USC
and our proud institution exhibit
athletically at the national and even
international levels definitely merits
a heightened sense of import for the
competition between our two
schools. This comparison between
two top athletic programs has all it
needs to constitute a heated rivalry.
But with Big Game already taken,
we just need to come up with a new
name.
