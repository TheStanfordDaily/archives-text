# Another Perspective
## For some, one rivalry just doesn't cut it 
### 
At Stanford, we can hardly keep our
selves from comparing — comparing
ourselves to those around us, and fur
ther, comparing ourselves, as an institution, to
other schools. With innocent comparison,
though, naturally comes competition, and with
a few more necessary features, comes rivalry.
On the Farm, when we hear the word "ri
valry," we automatically think Cal. We think
of Big Game, then we think of all the Big [in
sert any Cal-Stanford varsity athletic com
petition here] contests that we all love to cel
ebrate when we emerge victorious. At least,
that's what I seem to have been well trained
to think.
But here 1 am standing up to say that while
Big Game is admittedly big and it's just plain
fun to hate on Cal, our sports rivalry for the
modern day could just as well be against USC.
I understand rivalry must have history and the
short commute across the Bay has definitely
allowed our antagonism towards Cal to devel
op in the years since our inception. Still, at a
school of our stature in all aspects, must we
limit ourselves to just one rival?
If I were to ask random Stanford students
who they consider our current academic or
intellectual rival to be, would they not say
Harvard or another Ivy? But, this is a sports
column. Thus, similarly, when it comes to
modern athletic programs — and our rivalry
against Cal is, really, only an athletic rivalry
— I would honestly say that it is our "neigh
bor" to the South in the heart of Los Angeles
that fits the bill.
When I think of attributes necessary for
an institutional rivalry, I think of four fea
tures off hand. First of all, there absolutely
has to be a long-standing relationship be
tween two similar schools and their front
running programs. Considering that the first
football game played between our beloved
Cardinal and USC took place in 1905 and
that there have been 85 games played be
tween the two private university squads
since then, I think this requirement is easily
satisfied.
Secondly, each program should have a
reputation for success on the national stage.
Sure enough, from my observation, when
people around the nation think of collegiate
athletic powers on the West Coast, it's Stan
ford and USC, then UCLA and possibly Cal.
Again. I am not wishing to discount Cal as a
an unworthy foe, I am simply relying on my
gut feeling that Stanford should make more
out of its competition against the men and
