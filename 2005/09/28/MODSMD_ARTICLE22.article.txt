Stanford's endowment grew 19.5 percent over the
past fiscal year ending in June 2005, one of the most suc
cessful performances for any university endowment in
the country. Stanford's Merged Endowment Pool,
through which most of the endowment is invested, now
stands at $12.4 billion, a figure among the largest for
American private universities.
The University's endowment is designed similarly to
a mutual fund and includes assets that are invested for
the long-term in order to provide a steady stream of in
come while still maintaining their principal value.
The Stanford endowment provides essential support
in areas such as student financial aid, research and pro
fessorships. Last year, income from the endowment sup
ported 17 percent of the University's operating expens
es.
The endowment is managed by the Stanford Man
agement Company (SMC), an organization created in
1991 and overseen by the University's Board of Trustees.
According to Michael McCaffery, president and
Chief Executive Officer of SMC, this was a positive year
for the endowment chiefly because it will help ensure
the financial health of the University.
"We payout about 5 percent of the endowment value
each year to the University," he said. "We're trying to
keep the purchasing power of the endowment constant.
So any time we make more of the payout rate plus the
rate of inflation, we come ahead of our long-term goal of
maintaining the purchasing power of the endowment."
McCaffery attributed this year's success to a variety
of investments including international stocks, emerging
market stocks, natural resources such as oil and gas and

real estate.
The endowment also benefited from Google's rise to
prominence due to investments made through partner
ships with venture capital firms.
"The most recent year, and three year returns are
attributable to a broadly diversified portfolio," Mc-
Caffery said. "We are today invested in virtually every
asset class in just about every geography in the world.
That provides extremely broad diversification, and we
hire the very best managers in each asset class
throughout the world."
In addition to this year's success, the three year return
rate for the endowment is 15.5 percent while the 10-year
return rate stands at an annualized 15.4 percent, both ex
cellent figures by University standards.
Although he was pleased with SMC's recent per
formance, McCaffery emphasized the need to focus on
the long-term future growth of the endowment and to
remain cautious when predicting future results.
"After the good news, it is now an extremely volatile
and risky investment environment," McCaffery ex
plained.
"You can go back as recently as year end 2001 to
2(X)2, and the Stanford endowment lost money both
years," he said. "While we continue to be one of the top
companies, we lost 2 percent in each of those years."
McCaffery is already focused on the future growth of
the endowment.
"The job is to continually look ahead to maintain the
purchasing power of the endowment and manage the
volatility in investment returns," he said. "The job turns
immediately to what we are doing to create the next
year's, five years? and 10 years? results."
Junior Benny Padilla said he believes that the endow
ment?s growth could help improve the quality of the
Stanford experience for individual students.
"I hope that the growth of the endowment will pro
vide for better housing, more Stanford abroad programs
and an enlargement of the undergraduate research pro
grams," Padilla said.
