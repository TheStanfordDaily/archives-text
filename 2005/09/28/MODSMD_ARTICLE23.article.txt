# Eco-friendly dorm project hires firm
## Green dorm project to be built behind the Row 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Green Dorm Pro
ject, a student group dedicated to
building a new, state-of-the-art sus
tainable living residence at the Uni
versity, has hired an architectural
firm to begin planning construction.
The Green Dorm, the brainchild of
students and faculty in the Depart
ment of Civil and Environmental En
gineering (CEE), selected San Fran
cisco-based EHDD Architects after a
round of presentations and interviews
conducted over the summer.
"We now have commitment from
the provost for the feasibility study,"
said Lauren Dietrich, coordinator of
the Green Dorm Project and a mas
ter's student in the construction man
agement program at CEE.
Although it is too soon to predict
a date for the start of construction,
the group hopes to have the study
completed this winter.
"The group reviewed submittals
from 12 firms," explained master's

student Emily Leslie, a Green Dorm
student representative. "We nar
rowed the list down to four and then
interviewed teams from the four
firms in person."
EHDD specializes in complex, in -
novative building projects for
schools and museums that incorpo
rate environmental concerns. The
firm's past projects include the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium and Stanford's
own Carnegie Building — also an
environment-friendly design —
which was built in 2004.
EHDD Project Manager Brad Ja
cobson, is a Stanford alumnus and
former Synergy resident who also
teaches CEE's green architecture
class.
The Green Dorm has been in the
works since last year, when the proj
ect was greenlighted by University
Provost John Etchemendy. During
the late spring and early summer
some members of the original Green
Dorni project team formed the cur
rent working group charged with the
task of selecting architects for the
next phase.
Several locations for the dorm are
under consideration, but the favored
site is the area behind the Row, which

is now a parking lot for Bob, Xanadu
and Casa Italiana
"'I he University master plan al
ready had three new row houses slat
ed for those sites, so it would be con
venient to make one or all three
green design," Leslie explained.
"We're really excited about thus
project," said Project Designer Scott
Shell. "It is a wonderful opportunity to
advance the state of green building."
Both Dietrich and Shell agreed
that a major selling point for EHDD
was the firm's willingness to work
with students and faculty in CEE.
"We definitely chose EHDD for
their plan for incorporating user in
terest — student and faculty —
throughout the design process," Di
etrich said.
Shell noted climate change and
the maintenance of biodiversity as
two major "challenges for the 21st
century."
"The project has multiple goals,"
he said. "One is to be a site for

demonstration and education about
sustainable living. Another goal is for
the University to showcase environ
ment-friendly design that is econom
ically maintainable."
Shell also said that many pre-ex
isting conservation technologies,
such as solar panels, have well
known sunk costs that can be fac
tored into the cost of adoption. The
Green Dorm group, however, will af
ford a testing ground for experimen
tal technologies,
"Some energy-efficient tech
nologies have quick paybacks, but
with this project, we also have the
opportunity to try some of the new
research out there." he said."During
design and after construction, stu
dents and faculty will use the project
as a test case to develop and evalu
ate some of the most promising in
novations."
Dietrich said that student initia
tive was the driving force behind the
project.
