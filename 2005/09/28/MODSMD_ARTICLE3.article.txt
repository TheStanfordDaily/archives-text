## ASSU debates OSP bill Bill pushed for overseas program in Israel tabled 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate convened for the first time in the
2005-2006 academic year last night
to discuss overseas studies for un
dergraduate students among other
topics. Additionally, the Office of
Religious Life addressed the Senate
to clarify their purpose and clarify
any preconceptions students may
have had about the organization.
Two bills co-authored by sopho
more Senator Danny Arbeiter and
senior Senator Andrew Hendel
were brought before the Senate for
consideration. The first bill, which
was tabled last May due to lack of
background information, specifical
ly resolved to support an overseas
seminar in Israel.
Currently, a curriculum fora
seminar course in Israel has been
created by the Stanford Overseas
Studies Program (OSP), but is not
being offered because undergradu
ate students are prohibited from
traveling in countries where a State
Department Travel Warning has
been issued.
If passed, this bill would allow
the Senate to encourage the OSP
to include this seminar in its pro
gram listings for 2006 and go forth
with administrative procedures in
selecting students for the course.
The purpose of allowing these
preparations is so that if the travel
advisory warning on Israel is lifted,
the program can be launched im
mediately.
Several senators, including soph
omore Kai Lukoff, raised concerns
about allowing students to apply
and then be disappointed if they
find out they cannot go. Further
more, the Senate considered the
OSP's potentially wasteful adminis
trative costs of allowing the pro
gram to be advertised and students
to apply if it is eventually cancelled.
Other senators highlighted the
point that there is no indication that
the travel advisory warning will be
lifted because it is in constant fluctu
ation. Nanci Howe, the associate
dean of students, suggested that the
director of the OSP be brought in to
discuss the issues related to the Sen
ate bill.
The measure was once again
tabled so that more information
could be obtained.
The second bill of the night ad
dressed the fact that Stanford grad
uate students are currently allowed
to study in countries where there
are U.S. traveling advisory warn
ings so long as they sign a waiver,
but undergraduates are not. If
passed, the bill would allow the
Senate to encourage the Office of
the Provost to give upperclassmen
undergraduates the same option as
graduate students.
Hendel stated that there are sev
eral reasons why graduate students
are given this privilege while under
graduates are not. First, undergrad
uates study through specific seminar
courses whereas graduate students
tend to study independently. Addi
tionally. undergraduates are in more
visible groups that could potentially
put them at greater risk.
After further discussion, the bill
was also tabled until the Senate
gathers more details about why the
current policy is in place.
Deans for Religious Life Scotty
McLennan, Joanne Sanders and Pa
tricia Karlin-Neumann discussed
their office's mission with the Sen
ate.
According to a pamphlet entitled
"Live Fully!" the role of the Office

for Religious Life is "to provide
leadership for, nurture and enhance
spiritual, religious and ethical life for
the Stanford University communi
ty."
Sanders detailed the variety of
Stanford-associated religious
groups that they oversee and pro

vide support for, ranging from the
Latter-Day Saints Student Associa
tion to the Religious Society of
Friends, or Quakers. She also spoke
about the many worship opportuni
ties and discussion panels that are
open to everyone on campus to at
tend.
