A $6.25 million grant from the Lymphoma
and Leukemia Society (LLS) will put Stanford
Medical researchers one step closer to quickly
manufacturing individually-tailored vaccines for
people with lymphoma, a cancer that attacks the
immune system.
The grant, announced yesterday, will keep
Ronald Levy, chief of the Medical School's On
cology Division, and his research team on track;
they hope to make available in two years the new
tumor-fighting technology on which his team has
been working.
The team includes professors and researchers
from the Stanford Genome Center and Univer
sity departments including oncology, chemical
engineering and microbiology and immunology.
The team has created a set of three technologies
capable of quickly characterizing a patient's
genes, targeting tumor cells and artificially man
ufacturing the proteins that can fight patients'
lymphoma.
"We've been working on vaccines for lym
phoma fora long time," Levy told The Daily.
"These vaccines are custom-made for each per
son — everyone needs a specific one made for
them, from their tumor. The technology up to
now has been inconvenient and slow
and expensive. The new technology
that [Chemical Engineering Prof.)
Jim Swartz has developed is poten
tially fast and inexpensive."
Such vaccines, specific to a pa
tient's genes, would attack the in
vading cancer cells without damag
ing the person's own immune sys
tem, as chemotherapy does.
The technology currently in use
has proved effective in animals and
is in advanced clinical trials for use
in human beings. The grant money
will allow the team to do further lab
work on the new, faster technology
and demonstrate that a vaccine for
human beings is viable.
"So far it's been very successful
in the mouse testing. We can go
from a gene to a protein in a matter
of a day," Levy said, speaking on the
vaccine-creation process. "We can
make a product custom-made for
each tumor very quickly."
The $6.25 million grant came as
the prize for LLS's annual national
competition for the most promising
advances against lymphoma. After
narrowing the field to a short list of
fewer than 10 research teams, the
Stanford project and two others re
ceived the grant money, which will
be paid out over five years.
