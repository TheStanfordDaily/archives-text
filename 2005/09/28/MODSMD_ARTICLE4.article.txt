A $6.25 million grant from the Lymphoma
and Leukemia Society (LLS) will put Stanford
Medical researchers one step closer to quickly
manufacturing individually-tailored vaccines for
people with lymphoma, a cancer that attacks the
immune system.
The grant, announced yesterday, will keep
Ronald Levy, chief of the Medical School's On
cology Division, and his research team on track;
they hope to make available in two years the new
tumor-fighting technology on which his team has
been working.
The team includes professors and researchers
from the Stanford Genome Center and Univer
sity departments including oncology, chemical
engineering and microbiology and immunology.
The team has created a set of three technologies
capable of quickly characterizing a patient's
genes, targeting tumor cells and artificially man
ufacturing the proteins that can fight patients'
lymphoma.
"We've been working on vaccines for lym
phoma fora long time," Levy told The Daily.
"These vaccines are custom-made for each per
son â€” everyone needs a specific one made for
them, from their tumor. The technology up to
