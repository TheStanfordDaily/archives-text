## Group to aid students affected by hurricane Stanford Students for Relief to provide monetary aid to students hit hard by Katrina 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Senior Lewis TUrner had an easier time mov
ing in than most students. No boxes, no photos, no
books; just three shirts and two pairs of pants —
the only possessions that safely escaped Hurri
cane Katrina.
TUrner was in his father's New Orleans apart
ment when Katrina hit.
"There would be a couple of minutes of lull
and then a pure torrent of rain and wind," he
said."You could literally see this huge gust com
ing toward you. It sounded almost like a train
coming."
While he and his family were able to flee safe
ly from the flooding city, little evidence of their
former lives survived.
"My entire home is under water," he said.
"They got some of it out, but then [Hurricane]
Rita hit. I made it out with only a few clothes. My
family is trying to send something, but they are
scattered across the country and are monetarily
screwed now."
With a little help from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and a lot of cred
it card debt,T\irner is now trying to piece his life
back together. Deep in the red, he is not only try
ing to find the resources to replace what he lost,
but also the funds to pay for Stanford tuition —
which, incidentally, increased this year.
"I was told that in spite of the fact that I'm a
hurricane victim, I'm getting less financial aid than
last year,"TUrner said. "TUition has gone up, so you
would expect that financial aid would
go up, but there is no additional aid.
I'm not asking them fora lot; 1 just
need enough to be able to stay here
this year. 1 need at least a little help."
While it was the University that
sent Turner a letter telling him that
he would receive supplementary aid,
it is a student group that is providing
it. Stanford Students for Relief
(SSR) is working to centralize

fundraising for Katrina victims.
Donna Winston, a core SSR or
ganizer, resigned from her position
as the School of Education represen
tative to the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), in order to devote
more time to SSR and to help fellow
students like Turner.
"At 1 p.m. that Wednesday [of Ka
trina], I just decided I had to do
something," said Winston, a graduate
student in administration and policy
management. "Katrina and Rita
have impacted and displaced so
many people. It's larger than any
thing we've seen domestically. As
current and future leaders we should

do our part and be models in our al
truism."
SSR's goal is to keep Stanford
students conscious of the devasta
tion that remains even as the water
subsides. Specifically, they hope to
recruit more students — undergrad
uate and graduate alike — to spear
head fundraising and aid efforts.
"We're working to raise awareness
about the situation," she said. "You
know now it's been moved from the
front pages, its no longer splashed
across CNN. but it's still there. There
are still broke, homeless people who
have lost everything, but people don't
think about it because it's not in front

of them anymore."
But the living story. Turner, was
sitting right in front of her, talking
about having to leave his grand
mother in a hospital; about passing
people in the street, panicked and
fighting over Styrofoam cups; about
hearing (what was fortunately a
rumor) that his uncle was shot in the
back of the head while trying to
evacuate prisoners, and now, about
facing the impossibility of paying
Stanford tuition.
When Turner finished his story,
Winston jumped up.
"We need to act now," she said.
"That's what we need to do."
