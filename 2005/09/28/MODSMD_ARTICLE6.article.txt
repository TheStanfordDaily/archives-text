# Waking up to a different world

After spending
hours in class,
labs and libraries, a
group of students has recently
gotten the chance to apply
their skills, helping with
tsunami relief efforts in the
Andaman Islands, territories
of India.
Beginning in June, graduate and un
dergraduate students from various
fields, from civil engineering to biologi
cal sciences, traveled to the Andaman Is
lands to create what they had designed in
the civil and environmental engineering

course called "Design fora Sustainable
World" last spring.
Working closely with a non-govern
mental organization in the Andaman Is
lands called Sustainable Environment
and Ecological Development, or
SEEDS, the class was able to obtain ex
tensive information about the communi
ties' needs in the Andaman Islands fol
lowing the tsunami, according to Molly
Morse, the teaching assistant for the class
and a second-year doctoral student in
civil engineering.
After learning that there is typically
abundant water for nine months of the
year followed by a massive drought for
three months, the class designed a rain
water harvesting and cleaning system
that can be placed on rooftops and easi
ly dismantled. Morse says.lbis feature is
important because many residents of the
Islands have been living in temporary'

housing since the tsunami. When they
move to permanent residences, they can
take the devices with them, she adds.
Because governmental designs for
permanent refugee housing in the An
daman Islands needed major improve
ment, the group of students also innovat
ed a permanent housing plan.
"We did a case study and looked into
materials, earthquake design, air quality,
etc. to try and come up with an alternate
solution," Morse says.
An overarching theme for both de
signs was to maintain environmental
friendliness. Morse, who is also project
manager for the Stanford chapter of En
gineers fora Sustainable World (ESW).
comments, "The Andaman Islands have
a pristine rain forest, and we didn't want
a material that would just destroy this


Nearly a year after last December's devastating tsunami, children in the Andaman Islands (above) squat as they drink standing water. Stanford grad
uate and undergraduate students headed to the Islands this summer and fall to help out, newly equipped with skills they acqiured in an engineering
class last spring.
