# Waking up to a different world

After spending
hours in class,
labs and libraries, a
group of students has recently
gotten the chance to apply
their skills, helping with
tsunami relief efforts in the
Andaman Islands, territories
of India.
Beginning in June, graduate and un
dergraduate students from various
fields, from civil engineering to biologi
cal sciences, traveled to the Andaman Is
lands to create what they had designed in
the civil and environmental engineering

course called "Design fora Sustainable
World" last spring.
Working closely with a non-govern
mental organization in the Andaman Is
lands called Sustainable Environment
and Ecological Development, or
SEEDS, the class was able to obtain ex
tensive information about the communi
ties' needs in the Andaman Islands fol
lowing the tsunami, according to Molly
Morse, the teaching assistant for the class
and a second-year doctoral student in
civil engineering.
After learning that there is typically
abundant water for nine months of the
year followed by a massive drought for
three months, the class designed a rain
water harvesting and cleaning system
that can be placed on rooftops and easi
ly dismantled. Morse says.lbis feature is
important because many residents of the
Islands have been living in temporary'

housing since the tsunami. When they
move to permanent residences, they can
take the devices with them, she adds.
Because governmental designs for
permanent refugee housing in the An
daman Islands needed major improve
ment, the group of students also innovat
ed a permanent housing plan.
"We did a case study and looked into
materials, earthquake design, air quality,
etc. to try and come up with an alternate
solution," Morse says.
An overarching theme for both de
signs was to maintain environmental
friendliness. Morse, who is also project
manager for the Stanford chapter of En
gineers fora Sustainable World (ESW).

a pristine rain forest, and we didn't want
a material that would just destroy this


Nearly a year after last December's devastating tsunami, children in the Andaman Islands (above) squat as they drink standing water. Stanford grad
uate and undergraduate students headed to the Islands this summer and fall to help out, newly equipped with skills they acqiured in an engineering
class last spring.

But once the students arrived in the Islands in
June, they reevaluated the situation themselves.
"When we got to the Andamans we did a commu
nity needs assessment," Morse explains. "Through
this, we discovered that fresh water supply was not
the biggest problem, if a problem at all. There were
more pressing issues to be dealt with."
Instead, the students decided to work on the Is
lands' most pressing obstacle: lack of drainage.
There was such a rush after the tsunami to con
struct temporary housing that draining infrastruc
ture was overlooked, Morse says. Standing water
in the islands is a big concern because it can lead to

the proliferation of water borne diseases such as
malaria. Thus, rather than construct rainwater
harvesting devices, the students worked on creat
ing a master drainage plan that is currently being
built by the Indian government's Public Works
Department, according to Morse.
The dedicated group of students also helped con
struct a resource center that educates people about
environmental issues and retrofit women's centers
for earthquakes.
This tsunami relief project would not have been
possible had it not been for the fundraising efforts of
sophomore Grace Hsu, a chemical engineering
major and the director of fundraising for ESW.
"Through the Office of the President, the School
of Engineering, the Department of Civil and Envi
ronmental Engineering, the Department of Mechan
ical Engineering, the Center for Environmental Sci
ence and Policy, Stanford Institute for the Environ
ment and some private contributions from individu
als and corporations, I was eventually able to secure

$30,0001 Isu says. ITie family of James I Isu. the
Stanford student who was killed in the tsunami, also
contributed significantly.
1 lowever, I Isu, who is of no relation to James 1 Isu,
says she did not acquire the money easily. Because
she began fundraising in the spring, many organiza
tions did not have much money to give. Additionally,
since HSW focuses on sustainable development and
not direct tsunami relief, the organization members
decided not to seek donations directly from mem
bers of the Stanford community, who were already
donating to the Red Cross and to other tsunami re
lief efforts.
The students say they gained a great sense of sat
isfaction through traveling to the Islands first-hand.
"I feel good trying to do a part in helping the
tsunami victims," Hsu says."I think it was particular
ly significant that ESW-Stanford was aiding rural
communities that didn't receive as much help from
the government as the urban centers did."
Other than Morse, the graduate students who

conducted relief work in the Andamans were Karim
Al-Khafaji, a doctoral student in biology; Eric Doran
and Alice Ryan,master's students in aeronautics and
astronomies; Whitney 1 lopkins, who graduated from
a mechanical engineering co-term program in 2005;
and Robby Bearman, who graduated from an ener
gy engineering co-term in 2005.
Undergraduates who worked in the Islands this
summer were Binbin Jiang, a civil and environmen
tal engineering co-term;senior Lauren Schneider, an
architectural design major; sophomores Bronwen
Stanford and Bonnie Swift, whose majors are unde
cided; senior Rachel Enslow.a mechanical engineer
ing major; and junior Mike Knuepfel, a mechanical
engineering major.

currently working to make "Design fora Sustainable

Stanford Bulletin as well as looking for more ways to
create environmentally friendly development.

Standing water, which can cause diseases to flare, is common in the Andamans due to poor drainage and destroyed
infrastructure following the tsunami, as well as due to recent heavy rains.
