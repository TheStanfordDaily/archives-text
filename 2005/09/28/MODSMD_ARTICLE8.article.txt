## Al-Qaida leader executed in Iraq 
### THOMAS WAGNER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq — U.S. and
Iraqi authorities said yesterday their
forces had killed the No. 2 official in
the al-Qaida in Iraq organization in a
weekend raid in Baghdad, claiming
to have struck a "painful blow" to the
country's most feared insurgent
group.
Abdullah Abu Azzam led al-
Qaida's operations in Baghdad, plan
ning a brutal wave of suicide bomb
ings in the capital since April, killing
hundreds of people, officials said. Ac
cording to an Associated Press tally,
698 people have been killed and
1,579 have been wounded since April
1 in suicide attacks in Baghdad.
He also controlled the finances
for foreign fighters that flowed into
Iraq to join the insurgency.
Abu Azzam, who a government
spokesman said was an Iraqi, was the
top deputy to Jordanian militant
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Abu Azzam
was on a list of Iraq's 29 most-want
ed insurgents issued by the U.S. mili
tary in February and had a bounty of
$50,000 on his head.
Al-Qaida in Iraq denied that Abu
Azzam was the No. 2 leader of the or
ganization and said "it was not con
firmed" that he was killed. "Abu
Azzam was one of al-Qaida's many
soldiers and is the leader of one of its
battalions operating in Baghdad,"
the group said in an Internet state
ment by its spokesman, Abu
Maysara al-Iraqi.
It called the U.S. and Iraqi claims
that he was the group's top deputy "a
futile attempt ... to raise the morale
of their troops."
A suicide bomber attacked

Iraqis applying for jobs as police
men Tuesday in Baqouba, 30 miles
north of Baghdad, killing nine and
wounding 21.
The U.S. military also said a Ma
rine was killed Monday by a roadside
bomb in the town of Khaldiyah, west
of Baghdad. The death brought to
1,918 the number of U.S. troops who
have died since the Iraq war started
in 2003, according to an A P count.
Police found the bodies of 22
Iraqi men who had been shot to
death in southern Iraq, many of them
bound and blindfolded, said Maj.
Felah Al-Mohammedawi of the In
terior Ministry. Their identities were
not immediately known.
It was not immediately clear what
effect Abu Azzam's death would
have on al-Qaida in Iraq, which has
been one of the deadliest militant
groups, carrying out suicide attacks
that targeted the country's Shiite ma
jority. The U.S. military has claimed to
have killed or captured leading al-
Zarqawi aides in the past and attacks
have continued unabated — al
though Abu Azzam appeared to be a
more significant figure.
Air Force Gen. Richard B.
Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said the killing of Abu
Azzam would force insurgents "to
go to the bench and find somebody
that is probably less knowledgeable
and less qualified."
"It's like fighting the al-Qaida
network. It will have some impact,
but over time they will replace peo
ple," Myers said at the Pentagon.
Iraqi government spokesman
Laith Kubba called the killing of Abu
Azzam a "painful blow" to al-Qaida,
but warned that the group would
likely carry out revenge attacks.

Abu Azzam was killed early Sun
day when U.S. and Iraqi forces raid
ed a high-rise apartment building in
Baghdad, Lt. Col. Steve Boylan. a
U.S. military spokesman, told the AP.
"They went in to capture him, he
did not surrender, and he was killed
in the raid," Boylan said.
Hie Iraqi and U.S. forces targeted
the building after a tip from an Iraqi
citizen, Kubba said. During the raid,
the troops captured another militant
in the apartment with Abu Azzam,
Kubba said.
Abu Azzam, whose real name is
Abdullah Najim Abdullah Mo
hamed Al-Jawari, was the No. 2 fig
ure in al-Qaida in Iraq, Kubba and
Boylan said.
i le had claimed responsibility for
the assassinations of a number of top
politicians, including a car bomb in
May 2004 that killed Izzadine
Saleem.the president of the U.S.-ap
pointed Governing Council, and a
July 2004 attack that killed the gov
ernor of Nineveh province, the mili

tary said.
He was the group's "amir" or
leader in Anbar, the vast western
province that is the heartland of the
insurgency, until spring, when he be
came the amir in Baghdad and led
operations in and around the capi
tal. He was "responsible for the re
cent upsurge in violent attacks in
the city since April 2005," the mili
tary said.
"We continue to decimate the
leadership of the al-Qaeda in Iraq
terrorist network and continue to
disrupt their operations," said Maj.
Gen. Rick Lynch, Multi-National
Force-Iraq spokesman. "By taking
Abu Azzam off the street, another
close associate of al-Zarqawi. we
have dealt another serious blow to
al-Zarqawi's terrorist organization."
Abu Azzam "personally planned
and ordered suicide car bomb at
tacks" in Baghdad and was responsi
ble for financing for the group and its
"international communications,"
Kubba said.
