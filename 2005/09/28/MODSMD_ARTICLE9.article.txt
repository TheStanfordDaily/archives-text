# Cocaine ruining Colombia's environs

### KIM HOUSEGO ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PUERTO ARTURO â€” Cocaine
is killing the great nature parks of
Colombia.
Government spraying of coca
plant killer is driving growers and
traffickers out of their usual territo
ry into national parks where spray
ing is banned. Here they are burn
ing thousands of acres of virgin rain
forest and poisoning rivers with
chemicals.
Now the government faces a
painful dilemma: to spray weedkiller
would be devastating, but the impact
of coca-growing is increasingly de
structive. The question is, which is
worse?
Colombia is home to about 15
percent of all the world's plant
species and one of its most diverse
arrays of amphibians, mammals and
birds. Dozens of species that popu
late its jungles and Andes mountains
exist nowhere else on the planet.
One of the richest is the Sierra
Macarena National Park, where
monkeys clamber across the jungle
canopy and seven species of big cat
prowl in its shadows.
But Sierra Macarena is most
threatened by cocaine. A recent
flight over part of its 1.6 million
acres revealed a trail of ugly gashes
and charred trunks of trees felled by
coca planters. The intruders also
have built dozens of makeshift drug
labs in the park and in the nearby
village of Puerto Arturo, bringing in
tons of gasoline, cement, hydrochlo
ric acid and other toxic chemicals to
process the coca leaves into cocaine.
All of it pollutes the rivers and soil.
So far only a small fraction of
Sierra Macarena has been affected,
but the spread of cocaine operations

is alarming.
The amount of acreage under
coca cultivation has more than
tripled to 9,600 acres since 2003, ac
cording to the Counternarcotics Po
lice. Overall, 28.000 acres are being
cultivated in Colombia's 49 national
parks, compared with 11,(XX) acres
only three years ago. But the de
struction is worse than the figuies
would indicate; for every acre of coca
planted, an average three acres aie
torn down.
"The national parks offer perfect
havens for traffickers," police Col.
Henry Gamboa said as his Black
Hawk helicopter swooped over a co
caine lab in the Sierra Macarena.
"There is virtually nothing we can d< >
about it. Our hands are tied."
The coca is planted by peasant
farmers who process it into paste
and sell it to rebels or right-wing
paramilitary factions, who refine
the paste into cocaine. Both groups
have infiltrated Colombia's nation
al parks.
The government says it is study
ing whether to lift the ban on spray
ing. If it doesn't, growers are bound
to plant more crops in the reserves.
But Indian tribes and environmental
advocates contend that spraying
would be harmful to the animals and
their surroundings.
The United States has provided
billions of dollars over the past five
years for spraying Colombian drug
fields, a move the United Nations
says helped reduced overall cocaine
production in Colombia last year by
13 percent.
Environmentalists insist the solu
tion is for government workers to
destroy the crops with machetes - a
method that has worked in moun
tainous areas beyond the spiny
planes' reach.
