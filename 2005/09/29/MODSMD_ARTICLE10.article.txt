## Sex, stress and other things that start with 'S' 
### NATALIE RAMOS HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Becoming a senior is a lot like having sex for
the first time.
Lots of nerves. So much build up. Endless ex
pectation.
In the end, it's quick, messy and not very satis
fying. You're left with foul body fluids, seemingly
infinite major requirements, used condoms and
missing GERs all over the place.
We spent three years waiting to finally attain
senior status — since this prominent position
means endless drunken fun at Pub Nights, free
champagne at University-sponsored events and
easy classes. Underclassmen are also known to
flirt mercilessly with their eerily sexy and intellec
tually stimulating senior TAs in hope of scoring a
CoHo date or, more likely, an A in the class.
In reality, though, being a senior is not so glam
orous. True, we no longer have to search for the
easiest IHUM or attend tedious five-unit 9 a.m.
core classes or figure out how to safely navigate a
Lag double without cracking our heads open on a
lofted metal bed frame. My earliest class is at 1
p.m. and my Lag single sleeps a family of four,
comfortably. Yet there's an intangible angst lurk
ing in my huge corner closet. "Did I make the best
of my time here?" "What will I do next?" "What if
I disappoint?"
We all came to Stanford with high hopes — to
write the Great American novel, to create the next
Google, to discover an effective treatment for
Alzheimer's. Few of us of will bring these goals to
fruition, but pursuing non-academic interests,
forming new relationships and having a little irre
sponsible fun along the way can make the college
experience worthwhile just the same.
As the quarter picks up speed and the tragic
day when neither food nor gas money is handed to
us creeps closer, we ought to remember that
there's more to life here than academic achieve
ment. Chances are we will remember friends, men
tors and lovers, especially the bad ones, much
more than an A in the Bio core or time spent cen
trifuging cell samples in a fancy Bio-X lab.
So, go outside while it's still warm and sunny.
Take the time to talk to your classmates about
their lives (not the weekly problem set), walk the
Dish (watch out for mountain lions), go to that
TUesday night concert at the Fillmore (don't in
hale though), watch "The OC" with your dorm
(everyone watches it) and make the weekend road
trip to L.A. (don't go to Sunset Blvd at 2 a.m.)
Maybe even cheer on the football team once or
twice. On second thought, once is probably
enough.
Senior year comes on really fast. But, like sex,
the experience gets better with patience and prac
tice.
