# College Nutrition Woes
## Fending off the Freshman Fifteen 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Though images of students playing
frisbee and jogging are standard fare
in Stanford catalogues and Web sites,
maintaining a healthy lifestyle while
on campus is not as easy as it seems.
Many students are plagued by rumors
of the "Freshman Fifteen" and the fear
that love handles may burden their
love lives. Social pressure and stress
from classes lead many a student to
neglect his or her nutrition.
"Students are so incredibly busy
with social lives and with academic
lives that sometimes their health suf
fers." says Vivian Crisman, a nutri
tionist at Vaden Health Center.
"Sometimes eating healthier is on the
wayside. It's good for students to
make it a priority without making it a
fixation."
The transition from home-cooked
meals to dorm food and from healthy
breakfasts to greasy late-night snack
ing contribute to this lack of nutrition
and dreaded weight gain.
"I think everyone is afraid of the
Frosh Fifteen because there's just so
much food," says freshman Jillian
Campbell who lives in Rinconada.
"Especially with all you can eat. And
with the prepared food, you don't re
ally know what's in it."
But Campbell notes that it's possi
ble for those more health-conscious
than she to eat in moderation.
"I think if you're really health con
scious then you can eat more moder
ately," she says.

Others say they believe that the
new all-you-care-to-eat dining sys
tem in Wilbur can contribute to a
healthier lifestyle since students
don't have to pay extra for nutritious
foods.
"At Wilbur last year it was hard to
eat healthy because just getting a lit
tle bit of healthy food costa lot of
extra points," says sophomore Carl
Moore.
Even upperclassmen living in
Row houses worry about the amount
of food available. Sophomore Mark
Shughart, who lives at 717 Dolores,
says he believes that the chef cooks
more nutritious food than the chefs in
his freshman-year dining hall, but
also comments that "the open
kitchen could fuel an all day eating
spree."
For students concerned about
their nutrition, Vaden Health Center
offers free one-on-one nutrition
counseling. About one-third of par
ticipants are self-referred, according
to Crisman. While this service is of
fered for those with eating disorders,
many visit the nutritionist simply to
discuss weight-management issues.
"With the media pressures and the
dating pressures, it can definitely
cause people to over-focus on image
and lose focus on other aspects of
life," Crisman says.
While a busy college life may ob
struct students' idea of nutrition, the
resources on campus still provide stu
dents opportunities to maintain their
health. Remember.your body is your
shrine, so take care of it.
