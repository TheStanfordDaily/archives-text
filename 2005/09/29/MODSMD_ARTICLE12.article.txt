# Surgical prof develops gastric bypass robot

### TINA HAN DESK EDITOR 
A1 Roker got gastric bypass surgery. Sharon
Osbourne and Randy Jackson got it too. These
celebrities were some of the first people who
helped publicize the operation as an alternative
weight-loss option for the morbidly obese. Now
at Stanford, Myriam Curet, an associate profes
sor of surgery has developed the da Vinci robotic
surgical system, an approach to gastric bypass
surgery that utilizes a surgical robot and revolu
tionizes the way in which surgeons perform the
operation.
The da Vinci robotic surgical system is manu
factured by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in Sunnyvale.
"[The robot] was developed to perform mini
mally invasive cardiac surgery and prostate sur
gery— two operations where surgeons do not
have much experience with minimally invasive
techniques," Curet says. "[Stanford University
Medical Center is] the first center to use the
robot for the entire gastric bypass."
According to the National Institute of Dia
betes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, gastric
bypass surgery is used most often to treat mor
bidly obese patients. Possible candidates for the
surgery include people with a body mass index
(BMI) of 40 or more, which translates to 100
pounds overweight for men and 80 pounds over
weight for women. The surgery is recommended
only for those people who cannot lose weight
through the traditional methods of diet and exer
cise.
The standard technique used to perform gas
tric bypass surgery is called laparoscopic surgery,
in which doctors insert surgical tools and small

cameras into a patient's body, and then manually
maneuver the devices. The new robot-assisted
technique allows the surgeon to perform the sur
gery from a control station, giving the surgeon
much more ease and command.
The robot's innovative design further facili
tates the surgical process.
"The robot has 3-D visualization and has
wristed instruments, both of which allow for bet
ter visualization and precision," Curet says."In
addition, the surgeon is in an economically cor
rect position during robotic surgery, thus mini
mizing fatigue, tremor and strain. Finally, the
robot has motion scaling, further improving pre
cision."
All these characteristics permit the robot to
be used specifically for gastric bypass surgery, she
adds.
The surgery can drastically limit the amount
of food the stomach can take in by shrinking the

its volume and bypassing a large section of the
small intestine. And the robot is intended to dra
matically reduce certain risks involved with the
surgery.
"The robot makes the surgery easier to per
form and makes it more likely that we can per
form laparoscopic surgery on bigger patients
|BMI > 60]," Curet explains. "These patients
have a higher risk of converting to open surgery
because of the technical problems associated
with operating on such large patients."
The robot was designed with arms that are
sturdy and durable enough to withstand the
torque of the patient's abdominal wall. This de
creases the chances that an open-cavity surgery
will become necessary once surgery with the
robot has already begun.
Another benefit of the invention is that it short
ens the length of time a surgeon will need to per
form the actual gastric bypass surgery. Using the
robot, the surgery can be 30 minutes shorter than
when the surgeon uses traditional hand tools, ac
cording to the Stanford News Service.
While there is still some uncertainty about the
use of the surgical system, Curet and her collabo
rators say they believe that with more time and
experimental trials, the robotic procedure will
make gastric bypass surgery safer than ever be
fore.
"The surgery can be done safely if patients are
selected carefully and are evaluated fully by a
multidisciplinary team and if the surgical team is
very experienced," Curet explains. "The robot,
we think, will help surgeons get over the learning
curve more quickly and will allow more experi
enced surgeons to operate on very obese patients
who otherwise might have open surgery."
