## Blackman's Back Where have all the indies gone? 
### 
Iwent to the rally to save Kepler's to pick
up girls. 1 brought three books, a dying
iPod, two pairs of headphones and a writ
ing journal with me in a large messenger bag
off which I'd pulled the Kenneth Cole tags,
one thread at a time. I left my camera at
home because I expected everyone else
there would be taking pictures. 1 wore a tight
green and orange T-shirt from a pretentious
independent music store in Manhattan.
1 could barely hear the speakers on stage
explaining how they would negotiate with
the company who owned the property to
lower Kepler's rents,so he could stay in busi
ness for another 50 years. Perhaps there
would be a membership club if — and when
— Clark Kepler reopened his store. People
told stories over and over again of a love for
books and of a store with a helpful staff, a
store that was a family destination, a man
date after Applewood Pizza, a store that you
couldn't walk out of without buying a few
books. They could have been describing a
Barnes & Noble.
Officeworkers in the floors above Ke
pler's looked out in astonishment and amuse
ment at the strange message of the event
please, pwetty pweeze Mr. Tan Group, could
you find it in your heart to lower poor ol' Mr.
Kepler's rent? The demand was an absurd
one. Clearly, the holding company could
make more money, profit, buy-low-sell-high,
benefit to investors if they raised the rent.
They wouldn't have raised the rent if the
space could not support it, and Kepler's could
not support that space. When I could hear
what the speakers were saying — the mayors
and city council members — retired and cur
rent — the owner of Cafe Baronne's — they
talked about how they'd lost so many Menlo
Park landmarks in the past few years —
names of stores I didn't recognize — but not
this one! This was their stand against ...what?
The basic forces and tenets of capitalism?
Being there by myself was lonely. Ihere
was no one there in my 18-25 demographic.
Some people pushing 30. there after work.on
their Treos and RAZRs, telling their friends
it wasn't worth it to come down. Ibe high
schoolers were out in force. Knowing it
would only take an hour, they were also on
their cell phones,planning their next activity.
One guy in black, a neo-goth with a guitar,
was waiting for the hippie spit it to come out.
at which point he'd lead a singalong. It never
happened.
There weren't any girls my age to flirt
with. I scanned the audience. Lots of burnt
out hippies, bleeding ponytails. some of
whom were eying the three cops suspi
ciously, waiting for the fuzz to start trouble.
Lots of seniors — gray hair dominates the
photographs. I guess hippies and senior cit
izens are starting to overlap. I can't recon
cile my grandfather, members of Cream
and the Chicago Seven all being eligible
for discount movie tickets. There was a les
bian couple and lots of families with kids.
The kids were raised the way I wish I had
been — with an early and naive belief in
their parent's left-leaning causes. Saving
the trees and the earth and Kepler's. Shop
ping at Whole Foods and eating organic
salads. Preferring hiking vacations over
trips to Disneyland. I wonder what these
kids are like when they grow up.They held
their homemade signs longer than most of
the adults.
There was one girl with dyed-red high
lights in her hair and a sign made with
sharpie markers: "... but Neil Gaiman was
coming." I smiled at her when she showed up,
and nearly fell down as I awkwardly shuffled
my feet while still wearing Rollerblades. She
opened her mouth to reveal a smile of metal
which made me notice her very-14-year-old
friend. The lesbians were cute in that early
30s-drink-tea-listen-to-Aimee-Mann sort of
way. but clearly outside of my dating pool.
TVvo girls in black "I (heart) Kepler's" T
shirts with "Damn the Man. Save the em

pire" written on the back in red glitter pen. A
line from a 1995 movie that epitomizes why
kids care about saving independent stores —
so we can feel unique. Have our own shithole
underdog overpriced privileged hangout
home. A place to fall in love and feel better
than everyone else. Cheers for 20-some
things. Central Perk for outcasts.
Hie best we can muster is a dated movie
reference? False nostalgia will save us all in
the end. When the chains have driven all the
indies out of business, they'll start faking it,
like a faux-indie label set up by a Big-5.
Ihey'll just give every outlet a different
name and make the owners buy mismatched
furniture from a central distributor in China
and play records picked by the employees.
We won't know whether to be outraged or
overjoyed.
Ihere was a moment of silence fcr the vic
tims and refugees of Hurricane Katrina. A
moment marred by the ladies in the back, the
ones holding up the "Honk if you love Ke
pler's" signs, causing the torrent of traffic
down El Camino Real to honk to show its
support fora non-issue. No one wanted to
see the store close. No local politician would
dream of not paying lip service to the store.
It's people wanting what they aren't willing
to work for.
I have a confession to make — prior to
this rally. I'd never been to Kepler's. I shop
for my books without loyalty, even at Ama
zon and Borders, both very big Republican
supporters. I feel good when I shop at Barnes
& Noble, a Buyßlue-endorsed retailer, even
if it did drive Shakespeare & Co. out of busi
ness. Kepler's was far from campus, and the
books I buy, no matter how obscure I think
them, can almost always be found in any
chain store I walk into, a thought that both
comforts and annoys me.
Someone made the point that if an inde
pendent bookstore can't survive in Menlo
Park, in the heart of Silicon Valley with all
the dot-com millionaires, then indie stores
are done for. Which makes me ask: Aren't
these independent bookstores — hell,
maybe bookstores in general — the provi
dence of rich white kids? Indies definitely
are. as higher prices necessitate a richer
clientele. This is why everyone loves large
chains — they're cheaper and more consis
tent. It's a simple explanation that requires
only the most rudimentary influence of the
invisible hand. Are these rich white kids the
ones who will think the big thoughts? The
ones who will seed the changes that benefit
everyone — the civil rights crusaders who
we so desperately need? Or are these the
kids who will work corporate jobs, drink
wine and enjoy the privilege of paying more
for rice or books so they can feel better
about their spending habits?
"Buy Local!" the politicians urged. Can
we? Is there such a thing as a local clothing
retailer anymore? Even local diners are a
thing of the past in most places. I lived in a
town this summer that was obviously less
than 10 years old — one indoor mall and too
many strip malls to count, a Best Buy, a
Chili's, four Starbucks, a P.F. Chang's, a
Noah's Bagels, an entire development of Mc-
Mansions. A Safeway and an Albertsons and
a Trader Joe's were my options for food.
While Trader Joe's may be warm-organic
fuzzy-hippie.it isn't buying local.
1 don't know how we're going to break
out of it. When the only college student at
tending a rally to save a local independent
bookstore — the one where Jerry Garcia
met Phil Lesh! —is a Jewish liberal who
can't help thinking like a Republican econ
major, the indies are done for.

Iwent to the rally to save Kepler's to pick
up girls. 1 brought three books, a dying
iPod, two pairs of headphones and a writ
ing journal with me in a large messenger bag
off which I'd pulled the Kenneth Cole tags,
one thread at a time. I left my camera at
home because I expected everyone else
there would be taking pictures. 1 wore a tight
green and orange T-shirt from a pretentious
independent music store in Manhattan.
1 could barely hear the speakers on stage
explaining how they would negotiate with
the company who owned the property to
lower Kepler's rents,so he could stay in busi
ness for another 50 years. Perhaps there
would be a membership club if — and when
— Clark Kepler reopened his store. People
told stories over and over again of a love for
books and of a store with a helpful staff, a
store that was a family destination, a man
date after Applewood Pizza, a store that you
couldn't walk out of without buying a few
books. They could have been describing a
Barnes & Noble.
Officeworkers in the floors above Ke
pler's looked out in astonishment and amuse
ment at the strange message of the event
please, pwetty pweeze Mr. Tan Group, could
you find it in your heart to lower poor ol' Mr.
Kepler's rent? The demand was an absurd
one. Clearly, the holding company could
make more money, profit, buy-low-sell-high,
benefit to investors if they raised the rent.
They wouldn't have raised the rent if the
space could not support it, and Kepler's could
not support that space. When I could hear
what the speakers were saying — the mayors
and city council members — retired and cur
rent — the owner of Cafe Baronne's — they
talked about how they'd lost so many Menlo
Park landmarks in the past few years —
names of stores I didn't recognize — but not
this one! This was their stand against ...what?
The basic forces and tenets of capitalism?
Being there by myself was lonely. Ihere
was no one there in my 18-25 demographic.
Some people pushing 30. there after work.on
their Treos and RAZRs, telling their friends
it wasn't worth it to come down. Ibe high
schoolers were out in force. Knowing it
would only take an hour, they were also on
their cell phones,planning their next activity.
One guy in black, a neo-goth with a guitar,
was waiting for the hippie spit it to come out.
at which point he'd lead a singalong. It never
happened.
There weren't any girls my age to flirt
with. I scanned the audience. Lots of burnt
out hippies, bleeding ponytails. some of
whom were eying the three cops suspi
ciously, waiting for the fuzz to start trouble.
Lots of seniors — gray hair dominates the
photographs. I guess hippies and senior cit
izens are starting to overlap. I can't recon
cile my grandfather, members of Cream
and the Chicago Seven all being eligible
for discount movie tickets. There was a les
bian couple and lots of families with kids.
The kids were raised the way I wish I had
been — with an early and naive belief in
their parent's left-leaning causes. Saving
the trees and the earth and Kepler's. Shop
ping at Whole Foods and eating organic
salads. Preferring hiking vacations over
trips to Disneyland. I wonder what these
kids are like when they grow up.They held
their homemade signs longer than most of
the adults.
There was one girl with dyed-red high
lights in her hair and a sign made with
sharpie markers: "... but Neil Gaiman was
coming." I smiled at her when she showed up,
and nearly fell down as I awkwardly shuffled
my feet while still wearing Rollerblades. She
opened her mouth to reveal a smile of metal
which made me notice her very-14-year-old
friend. The lesbians were cute in that early
30s-drink-tea-listen-to-Aimee-Mann sort of
way. but clearly outside of my dating pool.
TVvo girls in black "I (heart) Kepler's" T
shirts with "Damn the Man. Save the em

pire" written on the back in red glitter pen. A
line from a 1995 movie that epitomizes why
kids care about saving independent stores —
so we can feel unique. Have our own shithole
underdog overpriced privileged hangout
home. A place to fall in love and feel better
than everyone else. Cheers for 20-some
things. Central Perk for outcasts.
Hie best we can muster is a dated movie
reference? False nostalgia will save us all in
the end. When the chains have driven all the
indies out of business, they'll start faking it,
like a faux-indie label set up by a Big-5.
Ihey'll just give every outlet a different
name and make the owners buy mismatched
furniture from a central distributor in China
and play records picked by the employees.
We won't know whether to be outraged or
overjoyed.
Ihere was a moment of silence fcr the vic
tims and refugees of Hurricane Katrina. A
moment marred by the ladies in the back, the
ones holding up the "Honk if you love Ke
pler's" signs, causing the torrent of traffic
down El Camino Real to honk to show its
support fora non-issue. No one wanted to
see the store close. No local politician would
dream of not paying lip service to the store.
It's people wanting what they aren't willing
to work for.
I have a confession to make — prior to
this rally. I'd never been to Kepler's. I shop
for my books without loyalty, even at Ama
zon and Borders, both very big Republican
supporters. I feel good when I shop at Barnes
& Noble, a Buyßlue-endorsed retailer, even
if it did drive Shakespeare & Co. out of busi
ness. Kepler's was far from campus, and the
books I buy, no matter how obscure I think
them, can almost always be found in any
chain store I walk into, a thought that both
comforts and annoys me.
Someone made the point that if an inde
pendent bookstore can't survive in Menlo
Park, in the heart of Silicon Valley with all
the dot-com millionaires, then indie stores
are done for. Which makes me ask: Aren't
these independent bookstores — hell,
maybe bookstores in general — the provi
dence of rich white kids? Indies definitely
are. as higher prices necessitate a richer
clientele. This is why everyone loves large
chains — they're cheaper and more consis
tent. It's a simple explanation that requires
only the most rudimentary influence of the
invisible hand. Are these rich white kids the
ones who will think the big thoughts? The
ones who will seed the changes that benefit
everyone — the civil rights crusaders who
we so desperately need? Or are these the
kids who will work corporate jobs, drink
wine and enjoy the privilege of paying more
for rice or books so they can feel better
about their spending habits?
"Buy Local!" the politicians urged. Can
we? Is there such a thing as a local clothing
retailer anymore? Even local diners are a
thing of the past in most places. I lived in a
town this summer that was obviously less
than 10 years old — one indoor mall and too
many strip malls to count, a Best Buy, a
Chili's, four Starbucks, a P.F. Chang's, a
Noah's Bagels, an entire development of Mc-
