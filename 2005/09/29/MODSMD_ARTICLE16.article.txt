# General Edcation Ridiculousness

I do not understand the GERs at all. That
would not he so surprising, except that
I'm a senior. So maybe it's a had thing
that they're changing the system and offer
ing me the option of being part of the hip
and new. That's like offering people on
Medicare the option of voting in modern
elections â€” we should let them just die al
ready. (I'm kidding, Grandma.).
But I do feel very much like an old dog
that can't be taught new tricks. See. back in
my day. there was this requirement for world
cultures. In the new system there is this new
fangled "global community." Now, in the
good ol' days, we didn't have to butter up the
other nations of this world by calling them a
"community." To me, that's a bit of an over
statement. I think it's tough to say theUnit
ed States and Swaziland are both active
members of the "global community."That's
an insult to Swaziland.
"Global community" just seems like a
warmer rephrasing of a vague require
ment. Yet, I think it's amusing that a class 1
took on Korea counts fora GER under the
new system, but not under the old one. Ap
parently. Korea is not considered a "world
culture." Ouch.
Furthermore, as an Eiast Asian History
minor I did not satisfy the world cultures re
quirement under the old system. Mull this
over fora second, if you will. A student who
is focusing on studying a different culture
does not meet the world cultures require
ment. That's like a Fem Studies major not
satisfying the gender studies requirement.
Fve been reassured by my benevolent
administrators that even though I'm an

over-the-hill senior, I can use the old sys
tem or the new system, and it's really easy.
But I still have some questions.
For example, there's this "ethical reason
ing" requirement under the new system. If I
use the old system, does that mean my un
derstanding of the world is limited compared
to the incoming class, who will get an "ethi
cal" education? Will Ibecome a depraved
monster after graduating because I never
took an ethical-themed class, let alone know
what "ethical reasoning" means?
I'm curious to see the thinking that
went into creating this new requirement.
What recent occurrence has necessitated
the need for ethical reasoningtraining? Is
there suddenly proof that Sun Microsys
tem's CEOs are actually crazed villains
bent on world domination? Are there
more than a few Stanford grads beingin
vestigated for shady dealings on Wall
Street? Has evidence surfaced that alumna
Reese Witherspoon sustains herself on
baby meat?
Or is it because we now only have two
Supreme Court justices with a Stanford af
filiation? Maybe that's it: now Stanford

can only claim two-sevenths ofthe body of
arguably the most moral people in the
country. Actually, I'd tally it more as two
sixths; I don't think anybody will blame me
for excluding Clarence "Touch me!"
Thomas.
Perhaps the Stanford administration
wants to build more Supreme Court jus
tices from the current student body. That's
just what I need: More people telling me I
should go to law school. Hey Stanford, did
my parents put you up tothis?
I guess these new changes are for the
better. I mean, you have to take fewerre
quired courses, which is a cause I"ve been
rallying behind for years. And by "rallying
behind," I mean that, like the rest of the
student body, I've just complained to my
dormmates over dinner.
I can't wait for Stanford students to all be
come ethical people. I have a dream that
someday I will be able to walk onto this cam
pus and not be afraid of having my bike
stolen. That's what I'm really looking for
ward to.
I mean, this new requirement just fur
thers what I've always known: Stanford is
known for breeding corrupt, soulless, uneth
ical people. I wouldn't have expected four
years of amazing professors to instill ethical
values in me, nor would I have expected that
level of integrity from my peers. What's an
honor code for anyway?

Chris doesn't understand the GERs and
proves his ignorance by attempts at humor.
