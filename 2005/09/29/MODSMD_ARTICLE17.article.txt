Column constitutes an
empty generalization
Dong Liu's column "l iist Impressions" (Sept. 28) con
tains simplistic generalizations about Stanford students
that fail to communicate anything substantial. His main
tenet — "People attend Leland Stanford Junior Universi
ty for various reasons, almost all of which can be summa
rized by the Monetary Reason" — could be true in some
cases,but there are also people who go to Stanford for their
love of knowledge, as evidenced by the fact that they major
in fields that don't offer practical employment
chances.( Also important to bear in mind is that a great por
tion of Stanford students are on scholarships and financial
aid, hence the emptiness of his lush observations regarding
the monetary wealth of Stanford students.)
I could easily argue that all Stanford people are really
intellectual and love to debate — that they'd rather talk to
you about Noam Chomsky than go to bed. My generaliza
tion would be equally wrong, equally distorting as his. If we
are to preserve a minimal respect for truth, we should
avoid any generalized picture of the student body, for any
such picture would be "an equation of unequal things." as
Nietzsche wrote.
One last note. While the author looks with a cynical
eye at the desire — obviously a construct of capitalist con
sumerism and popular culture — to get material wealth, he
elevates physical attractiveness, which is just another con

struct of pop culture and capitalist consumerism that plays
on desires. If he is so devoid of earthly wishes, why, may I
ask, is he interested in the tall blonde, whose purpose here
is the Monetary Reason? Moreover, how do the contents
of his wallet affect his chances? If, as he claims, "attractive
females [are] like an endangered species," attractive males
(especially ones that are not consumed by a self-contradic
tory cynicism) are a far more-endangered species.
I think it is best to wish Dong Liu good luck with his
psychiatrist, and not be deterred by his harmful and un
founded commentary.

Letter portrayed Netanyahu,
Israelis unfairly
Rachelle Marshall, has published letters concerning
"evil Israel" ("Student fellowship organized by group with
anti-Palestine ties," Sept. 28) since I was at Stanford in the
late 19705. Marshall claims that Binyamin Netanyahu, for
mer Israeli prime minister and future candidate for Israeli
prime minister, opposes making any concessions to the
Palestinians. In truth, Netanyahu voted in favor of the Is
raeli evacuation of its towns in the Gaza Strip, until the
final vote. He also remained part of the government that
implemented evacuation. As prime minister, Netanyahu

implemented the Hebron protocols effecting an Israeli
withdrawal from most of I lebron.
Marshall also argued that Israeli occupation is depriv
ing Palestinians of their "land, their water and their free
dom. and too often their lives." The statement is reminis
cent of anti-Semitism in Poland, where the absence of Jews
has not calmed the ancient passions. (Israelis no longer oc
cupy the Gaza Strip).
In fact. Palestinian terrorists have destroyed liberty on
their own. Besides intimidating political opponents by
means of armed gangs of "masked men." establishing a
death penalty and controlling the press, the terrorists have
shut down the Gaza economy.The terror war has cost Gaza
residents their jobs inside Israel and in Gaza-Israeli indus
trial "peace" parks. Most recently, greenhouses left by Jew
ish residents of Gaza that had employed 14.(XM) Palestinian
Arabs were destroyed by Arabs, thereby resulting in even
more unemployment.
While the fate of the Palestinians is indeed tragic, the
causes and remedies are different than those Marshall sug
gests. I lowever. the solution for Gaza's Arabs lies in going
beyond the traditional tired explanations, and toward
something constructive. Absent terror, the Palestinians
have a state. What kind of state they form constitutes their
own responsibility.
