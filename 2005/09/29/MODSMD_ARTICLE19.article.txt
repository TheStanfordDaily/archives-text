## Rookie on the rise at Stanford 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
He's only been on campus a grand total of nine days,
but freshman two-meter Will Hindle-Katel is already
well on his way to leaving his mark on the Farm.
Having tallied 14 goals in his squad's seven games
thus far, Hindle-Katel looks to factor prominently in
the No. 2 Cardinal's (6-1,1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) NCAA title pursuit. His two goals per
game average trails only the mark of senior captain
Thomas Hopkins, who leads the team with 20 goals.
But you won't hear any of that from Hindle-Katel,
who doesn't track his offensive statistics and who con
veys only a humble perspective of his rookie role on one
of the premier collegiate water polo teams in the nation.
Given his modest disposition, it should come as no
surprise that Hindle-Katel deflects all praise for his of
fensive successes to his fellow Cardinal teammates.
"It's a lot easier to come off the bench and score
goals when [the opposition] is focused on Thomas
[Hopkins], [senior] Peter [Varellas], [junior]
Drake and stopping them," Hindle-Katel said. "So
hopefully 1 can sneak in off the bench and provide a
spark."
It's hard to imagine the lanky 6-foot-6 freshman es
caping the notice of anyone when he dives into the
pool, but it would be utterly ridiculous for opposing
teams to overlook one of the most potent scoring
threats in the Cardinal lineup.
But Hindle-Katel considers himself blessed to have
a talented counterpart at the 2-meter position in soph
omore Michael Bury. The two underclassmen share
the responsibility of taking on some of the biggest,
strongest players in the league — and the nature of the
battle doesn't make things any easier.
As two-meter players, Hindle-Katel and Bury are
required to fight for position in front of the goal in both
ends of the pool, as well as sprint end to end on transi
tions. It's an assignment that takes its toll, and as a high
school star in southern California Hindle-Katel found
himself shouldering that assignment for the majority of
his prep games.
This year, though, he has enjoyed the opportunity to
rotate with Bury — and that opportunity has paid off
well for Hindle-Katel and the Cardinal.
"I've enjoyed the role shift," Hindle-Katel said. "In
high school competitions I had to play a lot more. But
now with fewer minutes, I can be 100 percent effective
all the time."
In the Cardinal's seven games this season, head
coach John Vargas has made it a point to use Bury at
the outset of each quarter. The 6-foot-1 sophomore
gets his work in against the opposition's big men for
several minutes before Vargas calls for the substitution,
and Hindle-Katel enters looking to capitalize on the fa
tigue his mark will inevitably be suffering.
"I have an atypical build for my position," Hindle-
Katel says. "I'm built more like a goalie, so because my
style isn't as physical [as Bury's], I try to be quicker and
to take advantage of my length."
A more selfish player might complain about not
being given the chance to start, but Hindle-Katel un
derstands and accepts his role on the team as well as
anyone could ask. Aware of his status as a rookie mem
ber of a squad that has reached the NCAA title game
three years in a row, Hindle-Katel focuses less on him
self and more on the skills and knowledge of the team
mates around him.
"I definitely try to make an effort to watch guys, be
cause there's a lot of talent and experience in the pool,"
he said. "A lot of [them] are proactive about [teaching
me], so it has really helped."
But the story of Hindle-Katel's education as a water
polo player begins long before Stanford or NCAA
Championships even entered the picture. It was as a
nine-year-old third grader that Hindle-Katel first took
up the sport, inspired by his best friend's older brother,
who was then a star at Harvard-Westlake and went on
to play at California.
Hindle-Katel's coach that year was Eric Mandel —
the same man who would continue to instruct, guide

and mentor Hindle-Katel and his friends all the way
through high school.
During his time at Harvard-Westlake, Hindle-
Katel would be guided by former Olympic coach
Richard Corso and Stanford water polo legend Peter
Hudnut, but it was Mandel who truly taught him how
to play the game.
"He taught me to approach each game like it's the
title game,so when you get there you've already played
it a number of times," I lindle-Katel said.

It's an attitude the freshman carries with him years
later as he begins his career with the Cardinal. And it is
an attitude that has also helped form Hindle-Katel into
the model team player that he is today.
"Right now I'm trying to make as much of an im
pact as I can. to play my role as well as possible," he
said.
And given I lindle-Katel's ability and willingness to
help the team at whatever cost, that impact will only get
bigger in the years to come.
