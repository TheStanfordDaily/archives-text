# Undeclared juniors targeted by administration
## Class registration will be withheld from undeclared juniors 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Juniors, have you declared your majors?
From handing out free ice cream to sending
out warning e-mails, from holding 'Major Dec
laration Day' to withholding class registration,
the University has made a tremendous push to
encourage students to declare their majors

early and no later than the spring quarter of
their sophomore years. Despite the effort, how
ever, more than 40 percent of this year's junior
class remained undeclared as the fall quarter
began.
But this junior class appears no more recep
tive to the idea of declaring majors than did any
previous class. For at least the past half-decade,
the number of undeclared students at the begin
ning of each academic year has hovered around
the 50 percent mark University-wide.
This is a problem that the University has
sought to address. Vice Provost of Undergradu

ate Education John Bravman said. Students
should find few reasons to delay the process of
declaring majors, he noted, because an early
move affords students the genuine benefits of
receiving department-specific advice and re
sources.
"Declaring now with your department or
program undergraduate director gives you ac
cess to research, lectures, program activities and
mentoring opportunities," Bravman said in an e
mail sent recently to all undeclared juniors. "As a
declared major, you formalize your association
with your selected intellectual community at

Stanford and beyond."
In the same statement, Bravman warned that
any juniors who have not declared their majors
by Nov. 18 will see a hold placed on their ac
counts and lose the ability to enroll for the win
ter quarter. The Registrar's Office will release
the hold only if the students submit and receive
department approval for their major applica
tions.
According to University Registrar Roger
Printup, the number of undeclared juniors has
declined slightly, from 43.3 percent
before the distribution of Bravman's
e-mail to 35.7 percent as of TUesday.
Still, the figure remains disap
pointing and presents a situation that
strikes the University administration
and faculty as progressively more
worrisome.
"I know that many of my faculty
colleagues are increasingly concerned
about the change from five or six
years ago, when many fewer juniors
were undeclared," Bravman said in an
interview with The Daily.
The reluctance of many students
to declare majors has prompted the
Faculty Senate Committee on Under
graduate Standards and Policy (C
-USP) to include this issue as part of its
agenda. Although the committee has
yet to meet, and Bravman said he can
not predict if this subject will become
"a priority" of the committee, it is def
initely a priority for him.
For many students, the prospect of
declaring a major — thus digging a
defined academic path that will lead
them through, at the minimum, the
next two years of their undergraduate
career — is frightening, not counting
the fact that they are allowed to switch
majors at a later time.
"For me, I have had trouble be
cause I don't know exactly what I
want to get out of my time at Stanford
and what degree program will best fit
my interests," said Carl Cummings,an
undeclared junior.
Cummings articulated a sentiment
widely shared by similarly-situated
upperclassmen.
"I've never really been all that
committed to a major," said another
undeclared junior, Niran Babalola.
"There was about a week during win
ter quarter of last year when I
[thought], 'I'm so going to declare bi

ology tomorrow.' Thankfully. I never
did. Sometime during that quarter, I
figured out that I didn't like biology
all that much."
Students who have gone through
the declaration process draw differ
ent conclusions regarding whether
the University could further stream
line the procedure. One of the key
obstacles seems to be requiring stu
dents to initiate the search fora fac
ulty adviser.
"The process was not at all cum
bersome," said junior Jessica Bloom
garden, who declared economics as
her major at the end of her sopho
more year. "The econ major is proba
bly one of the simpler ones since they
assign you an adviser, but I've heard
of many majors where you have to re
search and pursue a faculty adviser."
Dennis Adams, a junior majoring
in biology, described the declaration
process as "fairly tedious" precisely
because of the difficulties he en
countered in searching fora faculty
adviser.
"I had a hard time finding an advis
er because many professors were al
ready at their limit of advisees,"
Adams said. "1 had no luck with three
professors before 1 found one that
specialized in a field somewhat relat
ed to my interests and was still taking
advisees."
He suggested that each depait
ment or program should provide an
online list of professors who are still
taking advisees,"so students and pro
fessors can reduce the amount of time
wasted on searching fora match," he
added.
Yet, however time-consuming the
declaration process may be, students
must eventually make a decision and
declare their majors. So for those jun
iors who have yet to declare, when are
they actually going to do it?
"I plan on declaring one of these
days," said Babalola, who now thinks
he wants to major in computer sci
ence. "That probably means I'll put it
off till the last possible moment."
