# Butkus, ESPN make mockery of coaching
## 
### 
Would you be insulted if some half-baked course in
structor posed as a renowned expert? Or if an inexperi
enced manager took over at your company and started
giving ludicrous orders and then congratulating him
self? And would you be doubly offended if you found
out the higher-ups had intentionally orchestrated the
whole thing?
I can't answer these questions for you. but that's
what's going on at Montour High School in Pittsburgh,
a school whose football program has had a string of los
ing seasons. After hiring a successful coach to turn
things around, the school board made a deal with ESPN
to have former Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus
coach the team for the 2005 season.
Reality TV is always a setup, so it shouldn't surprise
anyone that Butkus has never coached a football team
in any way. One would presume that the end product
ESPN was hoping for was a cross between the unmiti
gated rage of Paul Sr. on "American Chopper" and the
hardass persona of John Voight's character in "Varsity
Blues."
I didn't have to watch for long to figure out that Dick
Butkus doesn't know much about coaching (if by
"coaching" you mean "teaching the skills of the game
and motivating a group of players to be confident in
their ability to work together toward a common goal.")
There's a lot of canned talk about "heart" and "play
ing like champions" and "stepping up." Unfortunately I
haven't heard a lot of talk about blocking and tackling,
or minimizing mistakes, or gameplanning or any of the
other ways that most teams attempt to win football
games. I can't even tell which offense the team is run
ning (assuming it even has one).
Nor did I see any coaches studying film of the oppo
nent. If I found out my coach hadn't watched any tape
of the opponent five days before the game, I would have
assumed he was laid up, having an appendectomy
There also seemed to be an untoward amount of pro
fanity. Coaches among other professions, have been
known to use some "adult language" in high-strung sit
uations, but swearing up a storm usually just reveals the
vacuity of your motivational skills.
Presumably that's why Butkus brought in a drill ser
geant to "condition" the team, all of five days before the
first game. (What an Army drill sergeant is doing wear
ing his uniform in the guise of'commanding' a bunch of
civilian kids I have yet to figure out.)
One columnist who happens to be a coach wrote that
"coaches everywhere should be offended." As someone
with more football coaching experience that Butkus, I
have to say that I am offended, if only for the fact that
millions of viewers will get the idea that this candyass is
what real coaches are like.
"Coach" Butkus made a big show of telling the kids
what "winning" was all about and telling the kids about
being "losers." I had nothing against Butkus until he
started in with this. No respectable coach would ever
call his kids losers. Even if they were, a real coach knows
that his job is to make them into winners. Most of the
rank-and-file of the team probably didn't play on the
varsity last year and have little to do with previous los
ing records.
And speaking of losing records, maybe it should be
