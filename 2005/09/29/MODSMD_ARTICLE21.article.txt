# Women host Invitational at Maloney
## 
### WENDI GOH 
After a demanding six-game road stint,
the Stanford women's soccer team (4-3-1) is
relieved to finally return home for just the
second time in one month.The Cardinal are
scheduled to host Oakland (3-4-1), Col
orado College (6-2-3) and Santa Clara (7-1-
1) at the Stanford Nike Invitational this
weekend.
Oakland and Colorado College kick off
the tournament at 5 p.m. Friday, and the
matchup between Stanford and No. 5 Santa
Clara is planned to follow at 7:30. The tour
nament resumes on Sunday with Oakland
facing the Broncos at 11 a.m., and the Car
dinal are scheduled to play their second
contest against Colorado College, with a
kick off time of 1:30 p.m.
The Cardinal enter the tournament rid
ing high from last Thursday's 2-1 win over
Navy (5-5-1). Stanford should benefit from
the momentum of that victory this week
end, which stores its final matches before
the Pacific-10 Conference schedule starts
next week.
Stanford's game against Santa Clara on
Friday marks the 28th meeting between the
teams. A win over the Broncos could con
tribute to Stanford's chances of qualifying
for — and perhaps even hosting — the
NCAA Tournament. Santa Clara has been

in excellent form this season, so Car
dinal head coach Paul Ratcliffe is
cautious not to underestimate the
Broncos ability.
"The Santa Clara game is a huge
rivalry, and the team is improving
more and more as they play this sea
son," Ratcliffe said. "[But] I'm ex
pecting to win; we definitely want to
beat Santa Clara. We beat them in
the spring and I feel we can beat
them now."
Sunday's meeting between Col
orado College and Stanford will be
the first since the Cardinal's 6-0 vic
tory over the Tigers in 1997. The
Tigers are currently on a four-game
win-streak and have suffered only
two losses this season. In particular,
Stanford's defense will need to look
out for sophorrfbre forward Lisa
Balsama who scored twice in the
Tigers' victory over Air Force last
week. Balsama has earned co-Play
er of the Week honors, for the sec
ond consecutive week, among the
nation's Division I independent
programs.
"Colorado College is a strong
team, so we need to make sure we
keep our focus," Ratcliffe said. "A
lot of our energy is focused toward
the Santa Clara matchup, but we
need to make sure we are prepared
for [the Tigers] as well."
Home field advantage will play
an important role in the Cardinal's
matches this weekend. Friday's
game against Santa Clara is only

Stanford's second home game this
season, and the players have been
eagerly anticipating the effect of
playing in front of a home crowd.
"Usually [our games] against
Santa Clara fill up the stadium and
there's always a lot of energy when
you play at home," senior midfield
er Martha West said. "As a team we
get up for the game more...there's
more excitement in the air."
Stanford is also welcoming the
return of freshman goalie Alex
Gamble, who sat out last Thursday's
match due to injury. However, sen
ior midfielder Leah Tapscott's
starter status is questionable, as she
was injured during a tackle in last
week's match.Tapscott is the Cardi
nal's top scorer this season with
three goals. She also scored the win
ner against Santa Clara last spring.
The team is still waiting to hear the
results of an MRI.
"Leah's [fitness] will have to be
day-to-day," Ratcliffe said. "So we
are hoping she can play on Friday or
this weekend."
While Stanford must surely hope
that last week's victory over Navy
will set the tone for the rest of the
season, the Cardinal still have to
work on sustaining the same level of
play for the entire 90 minutes in
each of their matches this weekend.
"I think that things are starting to
come together," West said. "Hope
fully we will start to reach our peak
now and be able to put together two
good halves. We had moments of
good soccer in the other games for
maybe a half here and there but it
hasn't been consistent. We're get
ting there, so we're hoping it will all
come together."
