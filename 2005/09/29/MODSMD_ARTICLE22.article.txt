# Card meet Pac-10's new addition
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Riding the momentum from two wins in
the Stanford-Nike Invitational, Cardinal
men's soccer (3-4-1, 0-0-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) travels to Southern California this
weekend to begin the grueling Pac-10
schedule — with a new twist.
Stanford is not only scheduled to face
No. 23 UCLA (4-2-0,0-0-0) on the road trip
but also to take on the Pac-10's newcomer,
San Diego State (6-0-1,0-0-0), a team the
Cardinal have only beaten once and have
not faced in nearly a decade.
"We will get scouting reports from
[SDSU's] opponents this year, and [since]
they've had a very good start, 1 suspect
they'll continue to do what they've been
doing over the past six or seven games,"
head coach Bret Simon said. "We know
that they're energetic and play a fast, phys
ical game. I don't think they'll be anything
that's a major surprise. They're a very tal
ented team — that's why we wanted them
to join us in the Pac-10."
The undefeated Aztecs are off to their
best start since 1991 and are currently hov
ering just outside the NSCAA top 25. Car
rying them in net so far is junior Tally Hall,
who leads the nation with a .14 GAA. Of
fensively, Pac-10 player of the week, soph
omore Kraig Chiles, has been their key.
The star midfielder tallied three goals this
weekend, including a game winning penal
ty kick against Alabama A&M. Though a
concern, the team's scoring leader with six
goals should not consume the Cardinal's
game plan.
"We don't put any players on the field to
just mark a guy out of the game or encour
age anyone to go out there and kick some

one," Simon said. "Certainly we'll be aware
of him and make sure that the matchups
are such that our midfield knows what he's
up to, but he's a talented player so I'm sure
he'll have his moments. We hope to have
the majority of the ball possession so they'll
have to worry about guarding us."
Instead, the coaching staff has been
stressing increased efficiency in the attack
ing zone. The Cardinal have scored only six
goals in eight games and have already seen
a one-point lead evaporate this season.
"One thing we're trying is putting more
attacking players on the field, which is al
ways a good way to get more goals and
chances," Simon said. "The second thing
we've done in training is a lot of attacking
patterns. We're trying to give the younger
players some ideas about how they can
break down an opponent's defense."
Simon hopes that the players will get to
know each other more quickly and under
stand scoring opportunities in different
situations.
The practice regiment gets a quick test
when the Cardinal face the Bruins. Defend
ers Patrick lanni and Marvell Wynne were
teammates of junior Cardinal keeper An
drew Kartunen on the United States U-20
national team and are professional
prospects. The two other backs also have
some experience in international play and
constitute, arguably, one of the best four
somes in the nation. A telling statistic is that
although UCLA and its opponents have
had comparable shot attempts, the UCLA
defense has allowed far less shots on goal
and only five goals against.
The Bruins were last year's Pac-10
champions and have always proved a
