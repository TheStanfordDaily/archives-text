# Field hockey rematches with Pacific
## 
### ROHAN PURANIK 
Coming off of a memorable victory over Pa
cific (4-6) last Sunday in Stockton, Calif., the
Stanford women's field hockey team (3-8)
looks fora repeat of that performance this Sat
urday when the Tigers pay a visit to the Farm's
Artificial Turf Field.
On Sunday, Pacific's junior star Vianney
Campos was slightly ill and unable to contribute
as significantly as was expected. According to
Stanford freshman midfielder/defender Bailey
Richardson, the squad expects Campos to re
turn with full force.
"[Campos] had a rough game [on Sunday],"
Richardson said. "[But] she's going to come out
full speed this time, so she's probably going to
be more of a threat."
According to Halliday, the team expects that
it will have a slight advantage this game, as it will
be playing on turf, as opposed to grass. TUrf al

lows the team more ball control, giving the Car
dinal the opportunity to employ the strategies
they've been working on during practices.
Sophomore midfielder/forward Jess Zutz
also indicated that the team would be able to
use speed, an integral part of last Sunday's win.
"We're going to have to come back and play
our turf game again," Zutz said."Speed is some
thing that we have up along the forward line.
We're going to use our speed to beat them."
"We're going to try and transfer the ball —
attack from both the right-hand and left-hand
sides," Richardson added. "In the grass you can
throw the ball to spaces, but on turf we're going
to have to do a lot of stick-to-stick passing."
Squad members noted that they will need to
keep up their attitude from last game in order to
beat a hungry-for-revenge UOP team.
"[Because we] just beat UOP, they're going
to be especially aggressive so we're going to
have to keep up the same hustle from the last

time," Richardson said.
According to Zutz, many of the tactics key in
scoring early and maintaining the lead through
out Sunday's game will again be used during the
upcoming match.
"From a forward standpoint, we did a good
job with having a lot of confidence with the rest
of the field," Zutz said. "We confused the de
fenders about what we were going to do."
Richardson is convinced the forwards will
continue their spectacular play from Sunday.
"Our forwards did an excellent job of pass
ing to each other and using fluidity in the of
fense," Richardson said. "They used a lot of tips.
The forwards are definitely going to keep up
their play.
The Cardinal hope to draw energy from the
student support at the game.
"This is our first home game of the season "
Zutz said. "We're hoping to get a lot of support
and put [the Tigers] back in their place."
