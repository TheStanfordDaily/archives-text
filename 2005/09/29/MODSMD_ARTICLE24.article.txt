# New campus Web site lists want ads
## 
### DANIELLE LOSTAUNAU STAFF WRITER 
A Web site has been developed
where students can find jobs, cars,
housing or just the opportunity to
help out in the community. Stan
ford.oodle.com, the first Stanford
based search engine for classifieds
on the web, is a local offshoot of
Oodle.com, a portal to online mar
ketplaces and classified ads. Co
founded by two Stanford alumni, the
Web site compiles local classified
listings from hundreds of local and
national sources such as eßay,
Craigslist and the San Francisco
Chronicle.
"Our goal is to make it really easy
for buyers to find what they want,"
said Saith Sedlin, one of the co
founders of Oodle. "We put every
thing in one place."
On Stanford's Oodle site, stu
dents can find anything from Big
Game Tickets on eßay and
Craigslist to Cookie, a Siamese cat
being given away on Fetfinder.com.
However, the site functions more as
a gateway and doesn't take business
away from any of its sources, said
current employee Zuzana Fedorko
va
"We want to point our users to
listings published on other sites," she
said. "Once they do a search on
Oodle. they can click a link and find
exactly what they are looking for on
that specific Web site."
Oodle was founded in early April
of 2005 by Sedlin and Stanford
alumni Creg Donato and Scott
Kister.
"Creating a Web site with com
plete online classified listings and
making it easy to use is not as
straightforward as it sounds," Sedlin
said. "There is a lot of work behind
the scenes. We have to filter all the
spam,classify all the information the
same way. go through all the data,
take all the right information and
create easy-to-use interfaces.
However, Oodle offers more
than just want ads.
"We believe that a lot of people
want to give away stuff, and some
times it's not easy for them to find

that opportunity," Sedlin explained.
"We had that in mind when creating
this company, so at Oodle we aggre
gate information on jobs, volunteer
ing and charity opportunities
around Stanford or any area."
The feature that immediately sets
Oodle apart from the average classi
fied page is its dedication to commu
nity service. Each Oodle branch wel
comes any kind of information
about local charities or organiza
tions that might need support. The
"Give Locally" tab on the
stanford.oodle.com Web site leads
to San Francisco-area charities as
well as volunteer positions at non
profit organizations around the Bay
Area.
"We're trying to foster communi
ty," Fedorkova said. "We have a per
son who goes out and looks for all
the charities in the area and gathers
information about what the charities
need."
Some students were immediately
drawn to the convenience the site of
fers.
"I think that Oodle seems like a
really cool idea," said sophomore
Laura Holmes. "Sometimes it takes
a lot of time when you're looking for
something through classified ads, so
I would really appreciate a Web site
like that. As a college student, we
don't have as much time to search
for cheap stuff we might need.
However, Albert Chan, a first
year graduate student in manage
ment science and engineering, is not
sure if he would use Oodle over
tried-and-true online marketplaces.
"It doesn't seem like a bad idea,
hut I think it might overlap a bit with
su.market [a newsgroup that allows
Stanford students to buy and sell on
line); I would like to try it out,
though," he said.
Regardless, Oodle is currently
looking to expand its staff.
"We would love it for Stanford
students to tell us about things we
don't have or organizations that
need help," Sedlin said. "Also, if any
Stanford alumni need a job, we have
positions open. In fact, more than
half of our current team graduated
from Stanford."
