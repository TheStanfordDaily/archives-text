# Bike shop claims debunked
## 
### MIKE FLEMING 
Though The Daily was informed
that the campus Bike Shop inten
tionally sold reflector-less bikes and
ineffective locks to new students,
these claims proved to be false, re
ported Krista Zizzo of the Freshman
Dean's Office in an interview with
[lie Daily.
Rather, two years ago, it was the
ASSU's sales of bikes and linens to
new students that were deemed un
acceptable. Complaints about the
delivery of these items came from
both students and parents, and cam
pus administrators eventually nixed
the whole enterprise. All internal
bike sales have become the business
of the campus Bike Shop located on
Salvatierra Walk.
Over 100 students, who bought
bikes at the shop, polled in last year's
New Student Orientation survey
said they were satisfied with their bi
cycles, according to Zizzo. Of the few
who were not satisfied, only the
prices of the bikes were regrettable,
never their quality or durability.
Recently, Stanford's Parking and
Transportation Services division
partnered with the Bike Shop to help
sell more bikes to new students.
Christian Parker, manager of the
Campus Bike Shop, stressed the im
portance of safety and said that, of

more than 700 bike sales over the
past two months, only one customer
returned complaining that the store
had skimped on his reflector. And
even in that case. Parker noted, the
customer's reflector was malfunc
tioning — not missing — and was
promptly fixed on the spot.
Wheel locks, valued at $20, are a
"good tool for discouraging casual
bike theft," Parker said. Hie locks
work by replacing the arm of the
quick-release with an alien bolt,
which is stronger. The Bike Shop is
selling wheel locks in a ready-to pur
chase bundle for $60.
"They have been proven safe and
have been a mainstay for bicycle
shops for the last decade," Parker
said. "There are fancier, more theft
resistant locks, but they are very ex
pensive and have their own draw
backs"
