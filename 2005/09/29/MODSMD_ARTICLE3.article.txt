## Law clinic wins decision against desert landfill Environmental Law Clinic wins decision stopping development of landfill near to national park 
### JENNIFER LIU DESK EDITOR 
The world's largest landfill, 17 years in the
making, would have received 20,000 tons of
garbage a day from Los Angeles County for 117
years. It would have been named the Eagle
Mountain Landfill and Recycling Center Pro
ject, and it would have been located on federal
land bordering Joshua Tree National Park in the
Mojave Desert, disrupting the desert ecosystem
and displacing several endangered species. On
Sept. 20, the Environmental Law Clinic at the
Stanford Law School won a major victory to stop
the development of the Eagle Mountain Land
fill when U.S. District Judge Robert J. Timlin
ruled that the federal land exchange required by
the project was "an abuse of discretion."
The Federal Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) agreed in 1998 to exchange almost 4.000
acres of federal public land with Kaiser Ven
tures and Mine Reclamation Corporation in re
turn for other scattered properties in the Mo
jave. Joshua Tree surrounds the proposed site
on three sides, which raised concerns about the
environmental impact of the dump on desert
species and their habitats.
Law Prof. Deborah Sivas, the director of the
Environmental Law Clinic, began working with
the National Parks Conservation Association
(NPCA) in 1995 and brought the case with her
to campus in late 1997, when she founded the
clinic. Stanford law students have been working
on the case throughout the years, beginning
with an administrative appeal to the Interior
Board of Appeals in 1999, which was ultimately
denied.
In January 2000, the Environmental Law
Clinic officially filed a lawsuit on behalf of the
NPCA. The ruling last Tuesday was a joint deci
sion in response to both the clinic's lawsuit as
well as that of local plaintiffs.
