## Law clinic wins decision against desert landfill Environmental Law Clinic wins decision stopping development of landfill near to national park 
### JENNIFER LIU DESK EDITOR 
The world's largest landfill, 17 years in the
making, would have received 20,000 tons of
garbage a day from Los Angeles County for 117
years. It would have been named the Eagle
Mountain Landfill and Recycling Center Pro
ject, and it would have been located on federal
land bordering Joshua Tree National Park in the
Mojave Desert, disrupting the desert ecosystem
and displacing several endangered species. On
Sept. 20, the Environmental Law Clinic at the
Stanford Law School won a major victory to stop
the development of the Eagle Mountain Land
fill when U.S. District Judge Robert J. Timlin
ruled that the federal land exchange required by
the project was "an abuse of discretion."
The Federal Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) agreed in 1998 to exchange almost 4.000
acres of federal public land with Kaiser Ven
tures and Mine Reclamation Corporation in re
turn for other scattered properties in the Mo
jave. Joshua Tree surrounds the proposed site
on three sides, which raised concerns about the
environmental impact of the dump on desert
species and their habitats.
Law Prof. Deborah Sivas, the director of the
Environmental Law Clinic, began working with
the National Parks Conservation Association
(NPCA) in 1995 and brought the case with her
to campus in late 1997, when she founded the
clinic. Stanford law students have been working
on the case throughout the years, beginning
with an administrative appeal to the Interior
Board of Appeals in 1999, which was ultimately
denied.
In January 2000, the Environmental Law
Clinic officially filed a lawsuit on behalf of the
NPCA. The ruling last Tuesday was a joint deci
sion in response to both the clinic's lawsuit as
well as that of local plaintiffs.
"[The judge has been) sitting on the case for
a long time," Sivas said in an inter
view with The Daily. "Essentially, the
decision affirmed our position and
reversed the Bureau's position and
that of the Interior Board of Ap
peals."
She pointed out that the decision
vindicated all the issues raised by the
clinic's clients, the NPCA, even
though it didn't fully affirm the posi
tions of the other plaintiffs.
"Our three main points were
based on the violation of two laws we
had taken to the Interior Board of
Appeals," Sivas said. "The National
Environmental Policy Act is the fed
eral law that requires environmental

review' for every action taken —
particularly consideration of envi
ronmental impact and alternatives.
The other is the Federal Land Policy
and Management Act, which gov
erns the BLM's general activities
and the way they manage land. We
argued that in this case, the BLM had
not adequately ascertained that this
exchange was in the public interest.
In addition, these exchanges need an
appraisal for equivalent exchange.
TTie Bureau's actions were clearly
inconsistent with these points."
Timlin found that the land ex
change was arbitrary, capricious, an
abuse of discretion and violated the
National Environmental Policy Act
as well as the Federal Land Policy
and Management Act. The exchange
also failed to meet fair market value
for the public land — Kaiser would
have sold the land to the Sanitation

Districts of Los Angeles County for
a reported $41 million; the BLM had
valued the land at about $400,000.
The Environmental Law Clinic is
currently involved in several other
projects in the Mojave Desert, the
biggest of which concerns the protec
tion of the desert tortoise, an endan
gered and rapidly declining species.
Additionally, press reports suggest
that Kaiser is deciding whether or not
to appeal the decision.
"The same judge will retain juris
diction, so it's not going to be easy
for [the company]," Sivas said. "Our
clients believe there's not much of a
demand for landfill space right now,
since a similar one has just opened.
We're hopeful that Los Angeles
County decides that they just don't
need the space."
About half a dozen Stanford law
students have been involved in the

Eagle Mountain Landfill case
through the years, Sivas said.
"We had students work on not
only the administrative appeal but
the case as well," she said "Students
were involved in helping put togeth
er the complaint, which is the docu
ment filed to start the lawsuit, and
many of them went through over
60,000 pages of evidence the BLM
produced. They reviewed the evi
dence and helped write the briefings
for the court. We usually have stu
dents argue, but in this particular
case, the judge didn't allow oral ar
guments."
However, nobody has worked on
the case in the last few years.
"It's been over five years since we
filed the lawsuit," Sivas said. "Stu
dents come and go and graduate and
go on with their lives, but the case
goes on."
