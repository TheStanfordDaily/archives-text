# University bands together to collect donations
## Donations for hurricane victims will be accepted across campus until tomorrow 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
You've probably seen donation boxes
around campus, yet more evidence of Univer
sity-run Katrina relief efforts. The organiza
tion Katrina Relief @ Stanford's immediate
needs committee, in connection with Glide
Memorial Church and the United Parcel Ser
vice, has organized a collection drive that
started Sept. 19 and will run through this Fri
day Sept. 30. Members of the Stanford com
munity are being urged to donate essential
items including toothpaste, toilet paper, infant
diapers, blankets and towels, according to the
Stanford group's website.
The collection drive, originally scheduled
to end on Sept. 23, was extended to Friday
when the group received calls requesting ad
ditional drop off sites, said Associate Vice
Provost for Faculty Development Sally Dick
son.
"What makes this effort successful is that it
has been the Stanford community of staff, stu
dents and faculty working together," said
Dickson, who is also director of the immediate
needs committee for Katrina Relief @ Stan
ford. "I really think it's a reflection of the type
of place Stanford is."
The organization was formed during a
brainstorming session of staff, students and
faculty called by Jan Barker Alexander, direc
tor of the Black Community Services Center.
The group was divided into four committees
— immediate needs, relocation, rebuilding
and communications.
"The immediate needs committee wanted
to provide directly to the families and individ
uals of the Gulf Coast," Dickson said. "The
Red Cross was very active, but we also knew
that there were other organizations working
there."
More than 20 donation points are located
across Stanford's campus, with boxes at the
various community services centers, the en
trance of Memorial Church and the Haas
Center for Public Service. The donated items
will be sent to Glide Memorial's sister church-

es located in Louisiana, Mississippi
and Texas, courtesy of a direct deliv
ery agreement with UPS.
Katrina Relief's merger with
Glide Memorial Church and UPS
was completely by chance. Dickson
explained.
"1 heard on the radio that Glide
Memorial was working on a drive,"
Dickson said. "They were very excit
ed by the fact that Stanford students
and the larger Stanford community
wanted to do something."
But Friday will not mark the end
of Katrina Relief @ Stanford's ef
forts, Dickson said.
"The immediate needs team will
meet soon and we mav decide to

conduct another drive," she said.
"Peoples' lives in the Gulf Coast
have been completely disrupted and
we are committed to the long term
process of rebuilding lives."
Sophomore Genia Begay heard
about the donation boxes through e
mails and decided to give back.
"I donated personal hygiene
products such as toothpaste, tooth
brushes, soap and shampoo," she
said. "As a Stanford student, 1 felt it
was important to give because I
have been provided with so much in
terms of opportunity. I can't imag
ine what it's like to have your home
destroyed and not having the basic
necessities required for everyday
living."
