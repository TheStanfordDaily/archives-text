### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) backed two union rallies
yesterday as symbolic support for
workers of the University and Stan
ford Hospital, who are in the midst of
negotiations with the administration
to renew their employment contracts
or parts of them.
The rallies — organized by Ser
vice Employees International Union
Local 715, the union that represents
workers of both the University and
the hospital, with the support of
SLAC — attracted an estimated total
of 160 students and workers. The
gatherings, each of which lasted for
about 30 minutes, took place peace
fully, with participants chanting that
the administration should reach "a
fair agreement" with the workers.
The White Plaza rally began at
noon, followed by a demonstration in
front of administration offices on
Serra Street around 1 p.m.
Local 715 president Zev Kvitky,
sophomore Matt Seriff-Cullick and a
University gardener spoke at the ral
lies, where the administration was ac
cused of "stalling" the negotiation
process.
Key issues on the table include in
dustry standard wages as well as re
tirement and health benefits,said sen
ior Joseles De La Cruz, a SLAC coor
dinator.
"The purpose of the rallies was to
let Stanford know that these issues
are important to the workers and that
we will not just wait them out," De La
Cruz said in an interview with The
Daily.
He noted that the University has
delayed a scheduled negotiation of
healthcare and retirement terms in
the contracts by saying that it is wait
ing for the release of a retirement
pension report.
"I am not at all surprised by this
stalling tactic " De La Cruz said."Nu
