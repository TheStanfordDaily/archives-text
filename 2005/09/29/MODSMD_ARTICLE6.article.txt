Vaclav Havel Foundation Vision 97 Award
in Prague next week, granted annually to an
individual whose work in science has en
riched culture by drawing attention to lesser
known phenomena.
Former Czech President Havel and his
wife Dagmar established The Vision 97
Foundation in 1999, and Zimbardo is the
seventh recipient of this international honor.
Past award winners include Austrian-born
U.S. neurosurgeon Karl Pribram, Robert

Reich, Secretary of Labor under Bill Clin
ton, Italian writer Umberto Eco, Czech
philosopher and biologist Zdenek Neubauer
and German-born U.S. computer scientist
Joseph Weizenbaum.
Zimbardo was awarded for his extensive
research in numerous psychological fields,
most famously dealing with shyness, mad
ness, violence, hypnosis, prisons and most re
cently, terrorism. Zimbardo also served as
president of the American Psychological As
sociation (APA) in 2002, and is currently
chair of the Council of Scientific Society
Presidents (CSSP).
Zimbardo's most famous projects in
clude the Stanford Prison Experiment, con
ducted at Stanford in 1971, and the Stan
ford Shyness Clinic, which Zimbardo initi
ated in 1975 and has since blossomed into
The Shyness Clinic based in Palo Alto. He
was officially the first man to explore shy
ness, recognize it as a human obstacle and
aim to help cure those who seek treatment.

Those who have taken classes with Zim
bardo are not surprised by his most recent
achievement.
"Dr. Zimbardo is an amazing teacher,"
sophomore Kirby Bumpus explained, hav
ing taken his Psychology 187 class last year.
"It's obvious when listening to him that he
truly cares about the study of human nature,
and goes about his research with creativity
and excitement."
Senior psychology major and former
teaching assistant Sean Bruich said he
thought Zimbardo's greatest strength was
his love of his field of study.
"Some researchers are content to do their
work in a vacuum, but for Dr. Z, it's all about
sharing psychology, whether it be through
his classes, his textbooks or his many public
lectures," Bruich said.
Award notwithstanding, Zimbardo already
has an immense body of work to show for his

he is grateful for the acknowledgement.
When asked about the award, Zim
bardo wrote in an e-mail to The Daily,
"I was totally surprised to discover
that I had won this prestigious award
for my assorted research and writing
over the past decades. I'm honored to
go to Prague next week to receive it

and deliver an acceptance speech."
One former student said she was
glad Zimbardo's work was recog
nized.
"The one thing I can say about Dr.
Z," said 2004 graduate Ellie Martin,
who was both Zimbardo's student
and teaching assistant, "Is that he is
undoubtedly the most vibrant and
dynamic professor I took a class from
or worked with at Stanford. He is
able to inspire fascination in a topic
like no one else can. and truly cares
about the students he teaches. Simply
put, he is a gem."
