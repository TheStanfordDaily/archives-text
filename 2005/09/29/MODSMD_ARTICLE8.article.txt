## DeLay resigns from House post 
### LARRY MARGASAK ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — House Ma
jority Leader Tom DeLay was indict
ed by a Texas grand jury yesterday on
a charge of conspiring to violate polit
ical fundraising laws, forcing him to
temporarily step aside from his GOP
post. He is the highest-ranking mem
ber of Congress to face criminal pros
ecution.
A defiant DeLay said he had done
nothing wrong and denounced the
Democratic prosecutor who pursued
the case as a "partisan fanatic." He
said, "This is one of the weakest, most
baseless indictments in American his
tory. It's a sham."
Nonetheless, DeLay's temporary
departure and the prospect of a crim
inal trial for one of the Republicans'
most visible leaders reverberated
throughout the GOP-run Congress,
which was already struggling with
ethics questions surrounding its Sen
ate leader.
Republicans quickly moved to fill
the void, while voicing polite support
for DeLay. Speaker Dennis Hastert
named Missouri Rep. Roy Blunt to
take over most of DeLay's leadership
duties.
Ronnie Earle, the Democratic
prosecutor in Austin who led the in
vestigation, denied politics was in
volved. "Our job is to prosecute abus
es of power and to bring those abuses
to the public," he said. He has noted
previously that he has prosecuted
many Democrats in the past.
DeLay, 58, was indicted on a single
felony count of conspiring with two
political associates.The two previous
ly had been charged with the same

conspiracy count. They are John
Colyandro, former executive director
of a Texas political action committee
formed by DeLay, and Jim Ellis, who
heads DeLay's national political
committee.
DeLay's successor, Blunt, also has
a connection with Ellis, federal
records show.
Since May 2003, Blunt's political
action committee, the Rely On Your
Beliefs Fund, has paid at least $88,000
to Ellis' firm, the J. W. Ellis Co., for po
litical consulting and fundraising. The
spending figures were compiled from
government records by the nonparti
san Political Money Line, a campaign
finance tracking service.
The indictment stems from a plan
DeLay helped set in motion in 2001
to help Republicans win control of
the Texas House in the 2002 elec
tions for the first time since Recon
struction.
The grand jury accused the men of
conspiring to route corporate dona
tions from DeLay's Texas committee
to the Republican Party in Washing
ton, then returning the money back
to Texas legislative candidates. It was
a scheme intended to evade a state
law outlawing corporate donations
going to candidates, the indictment
• said.
The indictment also mentioned an
other Republican figure, President
Bush's campaign political director
Terry Nelson, though it did not charge
him with any wrongdoing.
The grand jury alleged Nelson re
ceived the money — along with a list
of Texas lawmakers who were to get
donations — from the Texas commit
tee while working at the Republican
National Committee. Nelson did not

return calls to his office seeking com
ment.
DeLay and others conspired to
"engage in conduct that would consti
tute the offense of knowingly making
a political contribution in violation"
of Texas law, the indictment charged.
However, it did not specify how
DeLay was involved.
DeLay, whose conduct on sepa
rate issues was criticized by the
House ethics committee last year, was
unrelenting in his criticism of Earle.
He suggested the district attorney
had promised not to prosecute him
and then changed course under pres
sure from Democrats and criticism
from a newspaper in Texas.
The majority leader derided Earle
as an "unabashed partisan zealot" and
a "rogue district attorney."
However, the grand jury's fore
man, William Gibson, told The Asso
ciated Press that Earle didn't pres
sure members to indict DeLay. "Ron
nie Earle didn't indict him.The grand
jury indicted him," Gibson said in an

interview at his home.
Gibson, 76, a retired sheriff's
deputy, said of DeLay: "He's proba
bly doing a good job. I don't have
anything against him. Just something
happened."
DeLay's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin,
immediately sought to protect the
leader from further embarrassment,
even as they pressed to learn the evi
dence against their client. "What
we're trying to avoid is Ronnie Earle
having him taken down in handcuffs
and fingerprinted and photographed.
That's uncalled-for, and I don't think
that's going to happen," said
DeGuerin said.
DeLay got some polite support
from the White House, where press
secretary Scott McClellan said Bush
still considered DeLay "a good ally, a
leader who we have worked closely
with to get things done for the Amer
ican people."
"I think the president's view is that
we need to let the legal process
work," the spokesman said.
