# Female suicide bomber kills six
## 
### LEE KEATH ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq — A woman
disguised in a man's robes and head
dress slipped into a line of army re
cruits yesterday and detonated ex
plosives strapped to her body, killing
at least six recruits and wounding 35
— the first known suicide attack by
a woman in Iraq's insurgency.
The attack inTal Afar near the Syr
ian border appeared aimed at show
ing that militants could still strike in a
town where U.S. and Iraqi offensives
drove out insurgents only two weeks
ago. A female suicide bomber may
have been chosen because she could
get through checkpoints — at which
women are rarely searched — then
don her disguise to join the line of
men, Iraqi officials said.
Iraq's most notorious insurgent
group, al-Qaida in Iraq, claimed re
sponsibility for the attack in an In
ternet statement, saying it was car
ried out by a "blessed sister."
The bombing came a day after
U.S. and Iraqi officials announced
their forces killed the second-in
command of al-Qaida in Iraq, Ab
dullah Abu Azzam, in a raid in Bagh
dad over the weekend. His death has
not slowed insurgent violence, with
at least 84 people — including seven
U.S. service members — killed in at
tacks since Sunday.
President Bush warned violence
will increase in the days leading up to
a key Oct. 15 referendum on a new
constitution, a document that has
sharply divided Iraq's Shiite Muslim
majority and the Sunni minority that
forms the backbone of the insur
gency.
"We can expect they'll do every
thing in their power to try to stop the

march of freedom," Bush said. "And
our troops are ready for it."
The U.S. military announced
Wednesday that two more American
soldiers and an airman were killed in
violence and a Marine was killed by
a non-combat gunshot. The deaths
brought to 1.929 the number of U.S.
service members who have died
since the Iraq war started in March
2003, according to an Associated
Press count.
In the holy city of Najaf, south of
Baghdad, an attacker set off an ex
plosion in the home of a bodyguard
of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-
Sadr on Wednesday, killing two peo
ple and wounding five, al-Sadr aides
and a hospital official said.
In the attack at the Tal Afar
army recruitment center, the fe
male suicide bomber was wearing a
traditional white "dishdasha" robe
and a checkered kaffiya headscarf
— both worn only by men —to
blend in with the line of Iraqi appli
cants, Maj. Jamil Mohammed Saleh
said.
She detonated explosives packed
with metal balls and hidden under
her clothes, Saleh said. Six recruits
were killed and 35 wounded, said
hospital officials in Tal Afar. 260
miles northwest of Baghdad.
In a photo of the attacker's head
taken by Saleh and shown to AP, the
woman appeared to be in her early
20s with dark eyes, light skin and
brownish hair. Saleh said it was not
known whether she was Iraqi.
U.S. and Iraqi troops swept
through Tal Afar in a Sept. 8-12 of
fensive, with Iraqi authorities claim
ing nearly 200 suspected militants
were killed and 315 captured, though
many of the insurgents in the town
escaped.
