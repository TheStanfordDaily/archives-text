Soon, members of the Stanford community may he
ahle to take advantage of a new music service provided hy
Yahoo! According to Susan Weinstein. the director of
business development at Stanford, the contract is still
being negotiated, but at the very least. Stanford students
will be able to download any song they want on their com
puter, free of charge from the Yahoo! Web site, she said.
"Over the past year, Stanford has been talking with a
number of different music services to see which one pro
vides the best service and value for students," Weinstein
said in an interview with The Daily. "The evaluation and
implementation team at Stanford includes members from
a cross section of the University, including ASSU, Residen
tial Computing, the Office of the Dean of Students, ITS,
Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Vice
Presidents for Business Affairs."
In the future, members of the Stanford community will
be able to choose any song to download onto their Mac or
PC, she said, adding that while the service would be com
patible with most portable devices, it will not work with
the Ã¼biquitous iPod.
"The digital rights management system used in distrib
uting electronic music protects copyright holders from il
legal use of their work," Weinstein said. "The Mac operat
ing system is incompatible with the digital rights manage
ment system used by any of the subscription music servic
es."
According to Weinstein, though the songs are not com
patible with the iPod, Mac users can listen to the music
Yahoo provides on their iTunes just as a PC user could lis
ten to the music on their Windows Media Player. This does
not prevent members of this service from transferring and
listening to these songs on portable devices. Weinstein said
that there are some less commonly known portable de
vices, such as Creative's device, that are compatible with
the music Stanford students will be offered.
Weinstein said she feels that the University has much to
gain from this new deal.
"If launched, of course we hope that students will use
this robust, easy-to-use and inexpensive alternative to ille
gal file sharing, but we also think it is a great service,giving
students access to a compelling music experience which
includes a broad catalogue of music recorded with excel
lent fidelity and an opportunity to share their music with
