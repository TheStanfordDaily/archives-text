## Tutoring program confronts changes Ravenswood Mentors merged into English and reading groups 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Today White Plaza will fill with
hundreds of student groups show
casing the many ways in which stu
dents can not only participate in the
Stanford community, but also give
back to the one that lies just beyond
the Bubble. Yet, students familiar
with Ravenswood TUtors, one of
Stanford's most visible community
volunteering programs, may notice a
change from previous years.
The group, run out of the Haas
Center for Public Service in collabo
ration with the Stanford School of
Education and the Ravenswood
City School District, was once com
prised of three distinct programs —
Ravenswood English, Ravenswood
Reads and Ravenswood Mentors.
According to Savitha Moorthy,
graduate student in the School of
Education, the Ravenswood pro
gram director, the mentoring pro
gram. first started in 2003, has been
discontinued.
"Following from our conversa
tions with the superintendent and
the principals, we have decided to
focus the efforts of Ravenswood TU
tors around supporting the literacy
and language development of chil
dren in the K-2 grades," Moorthy
said. "We also hope to create a
model of volunteer training that will
adequately prepare Stanford under
graduates to work with children who
are academically at risk who have
great needs in the areas of literacy
and language development."
Ravenswood English volunteers
work with kindergarten through sec
ond grade English language learners
at Green Oaks Academy to improve
their oral proficiency; Ravenswood
Reads has tutors work one-on-one
with K-2 students at Costano Ele
mentary School to raise their read
ing comprehension skills and
Ravenswood Mentoring paired
third graders at Costano Elemen
tary School with mentors for after
school homework help, standard
ized test preparation and free activi
ties.
Last year, the mentoring program
served about 25 students, Moorthy
said.
Volunteers for Ravenswood
Mentors enjoyed the opportunity to
interact one-on-one with the chil
dren both academically and socially.
Sophomore Brittney Fraser men
tored a third grade student at
Costano during spring quarter of last
year and noted that their two hours
together included recess, homework
and fun activities and games.
"I enjoyed it a lot because in ad
dition to helping them with their
homework, we got to hang out,"
Fraser said. "They always looked
forward to seeing us."
Those who run the program are
optimistic that the changes will lead
to improvements.
"Not having mentoring this year
will allow Ravenswood Tutors to
focus on the improvements to the
Ravenswood Reads literacy tutor
ing curriculum." said senior Lara
Burenin, a tutor coordinator.
The other two programs within
Ravenswood Tutors — Ravenswood
Reads and Ravenswood English —
will remain. Organizers are aligning
the two programs and expanding to in
clude both Costano School and Green
Oaks Academy. Students and each
school will now have access to support
for beginning, intermediate and ad
vanced English language learners.
Coordinators emphasized that
no one will be adversely affected by
the cut of the mentoring program
and that the mentoring aspects of
the two other programs will remain.
"Children in the elementary
school will continue to be supported
in the areas of their greatest need by
Ravenswood Tutors," said senior
Robert Trevino, also a tutor coordi
nator. "As many volunteers would
happily attest, the nature of the work
carried out by Ravenswood Tutors
includes a strong mentoring compo
nent, as the bond that forms between
a volunteer and his or her child is at
the center of a tutoring interaction."
Ravenswood Tutors is adminis
tered by one program director and
eight undergraduate tutor coordina
tors. There are usually 60 to 75 stu
dent volunteers and their commit
ments range between one to three
quarters.llie programs are support
ed by a number of funds, including
the Peninsula Community Founda
tion and the Stanford Fund and by
several individual donors.
