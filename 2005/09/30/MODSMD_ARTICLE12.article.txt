Taking Action Now: Darfur
(S TAND) spoke at a meeting of the
California Public Employees' Re
tirement System (CaIPERS) in
Sacramento on Sept. 19th to encour
age companies to sever business ties
with the Sudanese government.
Sophomores Nikki Serapio and
ElissaTest were invited by California
State Treasurer and gubernatorial
candidate Phil Angelides to speak at
a press conference preceding the
meeting, during which Angelides an
nounced that he would encourage
the CaIPERS board to compel com
panies— such as automation tech
nologies company ABB Ltd.. com
munications firm Alcatel, oil compa
ny Royal Dutch/Shell Group.electri
cal engineering and electronics
group Siemens AG and French oil
company Total — to discontinue

business activities in Sudan.
According to Serapio, the rev
enue provided by these companies is
used by the Sudanese government to
finance the Janjaweed militias, which
carry out genocide in the Darfur re
gion.
"We have an obligation to do
whatever it takes to prevent another
Rwanda from happening on our
watch." said U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee
(D-9th) at the meeting. "No one
should have to worry that their re
tirement money is, directly or indi
rectly, supporting genocide."
In his speech. Serapio referenced
the Stanford Board of TYustees' June
decision to divest from four compa
nies operating in Sudan, including
ABB Ltd. as well as PetroChina,
Sinopec and Tatneft.
