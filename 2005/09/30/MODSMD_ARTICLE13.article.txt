### 
ZAO Noodle Bar
261 University Avenue, Palo Alto
(650)328-1988
Entrees from $7.99-$ 10.99

This casual, contemporary and cheap
noodle bar is exactly the kind of place
you wish you could find all over Palo
Alto. Its unassuming front makes the place
easy to walk right by, so you feel extra privi
leged to discover it yourself.
The decor is minimalist and clean, with
red floors livening up the dining experience.
Rice paper light fixtures illuminate the din
ers, while wine-bottle lanterns hang over the
bar. On the wall are Warhol-esque shadow
boxes with rows of aluminum cans, rice bags,
decorative fans and Pokemon figures. Jars of
colored chopsticks brighten the tables, and
artists like Jack Johnson sing through the
speakers.
Service is friendly if not speedy. ZAO
boasts all fresh ingredients and no MSG.The
menu has different symbols next to the en
tree titles to clearly mark vegan, vegetarian,
low-carb or extra-spicy dishes.
ZAO serves many varieties of beer and
sake. Those under 21 should try the thai iced
tea: black tea with spices and a splash of
cream. For an appetizer, try the edamame or
chicken satay with peanut sauce. There are
pan-seared noodle dishes like pad thai and
black bean chicken stir fry. There are also
noodles in broth dishes like chicken pho and
ZAO's special chicken in lemongrass co
conut For dessert, I recommend the
mochi ice cream, a dish made up of three fla
vors of ice cream balled-up in gooey rice
paper. Or try the banana spring roll with
chocolate sauce.
The Verdict: ZAO Noodle Bar is the per
fect place for lunch or dinner with friends.
It's classy enough to make you feel like
you've actually 'gone out' to eat, but its
prices are student-friendly.

Max's Opera Cafe
71 1 Stanford Shopping Center
(650) 323-6297
Entrees from $8.95-$22.95

Max's Opera Cafe is a classy deli
catessen with an overwhelming 10-
page menu. There are over a dozen
Max's diners across the Bay Area. This one,
in the Stanford Shopping Center, is just a
stone's throw away from campus.
Diners are greeted by an inviting art deco
interior. Lampposts and artistic light fix
tures softly illuminate the dark wood
booths. Background music is more reminis
cent of a jazz piano bar than an opera house.
While we were there, two servers sang num
bers from Broadway musicals and a six
year-old patron sang "Under the Sea."
Max's service is friendly and attentive, and
you'll never be left with an empty water
glass.
The extensive menu has something for
everyone. For starters, I recommend the bar
becue pork quesadillas. Max's is known for
its Reuben sandwich ("so juicy, it drips," ac
cording to the menu), and other generous
sandwiches with names like "The
Painkiller" and"The Italian Outlaw." There
are also burgers, pasta dishes, steak and
seafood. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich
(complete with pineapple slice) or the
penne with brie and tomato cream sauce.
One of "Max's Laws" printed on the
menu is, "This is a bad place fora diet and a
good place fora diet." For calorie-counters,
the menu contains over a dozen low-carb
entrees, salads with no-oil dressing and veg
etarian options. Dessert, however, is where
Max's becomes a snare for the sweet tooth.
The restaurant offers a selection including
triple chocolate mousse cake, peanut butter
crunch cheesecake and ice cream with
sauces "made by a certified chocoholic who
refuses therapy.'"lVy the macaroon crumble:
ice cream with marshmallow fudge and bits
of macaroon.
The Verdict: The wide selection and good
service make Max's a solid bet. (It's also one
of the few places where servers will sing
"Happy Birthday" to you and sound good.)
Max's is interesting but not quite unique
enough for the prices I plan to go back —
but just for dessert.
