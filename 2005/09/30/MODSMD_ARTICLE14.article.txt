# Stride under the Stars
## Moonlight Race Raises Funds for Palo Alto 
### MAX ROUNDS 
If you enjoyed the ambiance of Band
Run except for the costumes, music
and drunken revelry, trade in your
Darth Vader cape and silver tiara for
shorts and sneakers at The Palo Alto
Weekly's 21st annual Moonlight Run
and Walk.
Set under autumn's harvest moon,
the event, which will take place Friday,
Oct. 14, will begin at 7:30 p.m. with a
five-kilometer walk and run. A 10-kilo
meter run, certified by USA Track and
Field, will begin at 8:45 p.m.

Both courses tour the Palo
Alto Baylands levee and the
marshlands, providing won
derful scenery as motivation

for tired runners.
In addition to offering a
potentially clear evening

I Jo
under the stars, the Moon
light Run and Walk is
timed specifically to

occur during the harvest
moon, giving its con
testants beautiful views
of the once-a-year phe
nomenon which ere-

ates an lllusionary ef
fect of a larger and more
luminous moon.
The goal of the Walk

is to raise money for charity,
specifically for the Palo Alto Hoi-

iday Fund (PAHF). Eleven years ago
Bill Johnson, the publisher of The Palo
Alto Weekly and a Stanford alumnus,
started PAHF. The organization raises
money in the area through a combina
tion of events like the Walk and dona
tions from both private and corporate
sponsors. It then disperses the funds
through grants to nonprofit groups that
serve the area directly.
The Palo Alto Weekly's Promotion
Director Amy Renalds explains how
the Walk plays an important role in
PAHF's annual fundraising efforts.
"After expenses, all funds from the
Moonlight Run and Walk go directly to
the PAHF to help fuel more events and
boost the donations given out," she says.
Last year, the Fund raised $280,000
for the Palo Alto area.

Besides the Stanford Running Club,
which usually sends five to 15 partici
pants to the event, other members of the
Stanford community register for the
Moonlight Run and Walk.
"Many people, including graduate
students and sometimes professors,
often go independently of the club,"
says Adam Sciambi, a graduate student
and president of the Stanford Running
Club. "It's often fun because you see
people there you didn't expect."
In addition to Stanford folk, people
of many different interests and ages
participate in the Run and Walk.
"The 5K walk often draws families,
senior citizens and those looking for
fun," Renalds says."The 5K and 10K
runs often draw people in from as far
away as Los Gatos and even San Franr
cisco. Often, 40 to 50 high schools, as
well as soccer teams, cross country
teams and other athletic organizations
participate."
Sciambi also mentions that "there is
usually a good mixture of freshman, up
perclassmen and graduate students."
The actual event offers perks in ad
dition to runners' and walkers' highs â€”
refreshments, music and a climbing wall
will also be available to participants.
The Palo Alto Weekly will give awards
to the top three winners in each divi
sion.
"One year they gave away glow-in
the-dark sweatshirts," Sciambi says.
For everyone's safety, emergency
medical technicians will be patrolling
from bikes. The Palo Alto Police will
also have 15 to 17 officers out for traffic
control.
Although the Marguerite does not
offer transportation to the event, stu
dents can reach the starting line, located
at the end of Embarcadero and Highway
101, by bike, or they can carpool with
members of the Stanford Running Club.
Those interested can contact Sciambi
at sciambi@stanford.edu. Registration
costs $20 online or $25 the night of the
event. For online registration, visit

Although bright colors are encour
aged, Darth Vader capes and tiaras are
always welcome as well.
