# BEST-KEPT SECRETS
## Literary and culinary jewels of University Ave. 
### JESSAMYN EDRA 
The Stanford experience encompasses much more than a set of classes and a
favorite spot in the library. It goes beyond a roommate or a dorm. An inte
gral part of the Stanford experience is the journey past those palm trees — a
journey that begins on University Avenue.
The busy street is just a bike-or-Marguerite-ride away, thus making its stores and
restaurants accessible to even a earless freshman like myself.
In the Orientation Issue last week, we dished out some University Ave. hot-spots
for those who are new to the campus. Now, we're featuring three lesser-known ven
ues that may just make braving the insane traffic worth your while.

Megabooks
444 University Ave.
(650) 326-4730

Megabooks, which sells new
and used books, may not
look like much in compar
ison to the Borders down the street
or the book store on campus, but
there is something very cozy and
attic-like about its atmosphere.
Okay, so there's no student dis
count, but as the owner, who wished
to remain anonymous, says,"The
books are already cheap but we do
mark down some books at the reg
ister on a case-by-case basis de
pending on the condition of the
book."
The walls at Megabooks are cov
ered with movie posters and shelves
upon shelves of books that cover
topics including anthropology, po
etry and nature writing. Oh, and
don't forget to check out the up
stairs.
"We carry some textbooks —
not everything, but you should al
ways try us," the owner adds.
Megabooks is open Monday
through Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 8
p.m.; Friday and Saturday from 11
a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; and Sunday from
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The book store also
buys used books Tliesday through
Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Do
nations are always welcome.

Krung Siam: Authentic

Bay Leaf Cafe
520 Ramona St.
(650)321-7466
The Bay Leaf Cafe is a vegetarian spot

ety of cuisines including Japanese, Mediter
ranean and California. Additionally, the Bay
Leaf Cafe offers vegan options such as soy
ice cream and the artichoke quesadilla — ar
tichoke, basil, non-dairy mozzarella cheese

For vegetarians craving something other
than a Boca Burger or spaghetti marinara from
the dining hall, the Bay Leaf Cafe is the place
to go, as it converts traditional carnivorous

From po pia sod (fresh spring rolls) to
gai mamong (mango chicken), this
Thai restaurant offers a wide variety of

The restaurant features traditional Thai
decoration and the waitresses wear authen
tic dresses. The napkins and the roof beams
are pink and there are fresh flowers on every
table. They take orders to go and the staff is
friendly and accommodating. Personally, I
am a big fan of the khee mow (spicy flat noo

spiciness. from mild to extra hot.

butter and jelly sandwich or pasta salad, with a
big piece of cheesecake for dessert.
