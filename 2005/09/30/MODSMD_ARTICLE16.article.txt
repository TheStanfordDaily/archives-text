## Musings, circa 1999 Shorter is better 
### MARK SILVER 
Trying to write one of these columns
every week can be a difficult task. I
think, I observe, I discuss, I type; yet
some ideas don't ever make it past a para
graph or two.The lucky ones end up in print,
along with enough crapola to meet the
length requirements.
But sometimes shorter is better. Some
times ideas should stand alone, without any
padding. Sometimes the people just need to
hear. Now is one of those times. Descend
with me into the madness.
Every night I see students sitting around
in the Coffee House; books open, double
mochas steaming, loud background music
blaring in their ears. With serious, studious
looks on their faces, intense individuals con
centrate on pretending that they're working
so much harder than you could ever imagine.
Who are they kidding? You can't work in
the Coffee House. If you're not there getting
drunk, you came for one of two reasons: to
look at people or to have people look at you.
Having a book in front of you is fine, but don't
even act like you're trying to read. Just focus
on your main goal: staring at attractive peo
ple, or unattractive people if you're into that.
I recommend one of the stuffed arm
chairs across from the registers. They give a
commanding view of the entire establish
ment and also allow you to curl up and be
come invisible in case that really annoying
person comes in looking for you.
I have a major problem with students at
Stanford who brag about their sleep depri
vation.They wear it as a badge of honor, as if
they're somehow so much cooler than the
rest of us for having been awake for so long.
You hear these people all the time:
"I only got two hours of sleep in the past
week! I had 27 midterms to study for and 43
papers to write! Thank God for Late Night!"
And everyone else (the 10 or so people who
don't engage in this boastful behavior) encour
ages this kind of talk by sympathizing or prais
ing the lunatics for their impressive work ethics.
People, stop. If someone tells you he hasn't
slept since October,don't sympathize with him.
Say something like,"Boy,you really are stupid.
Have you always been such an idiot?"To really
get your point across, punch him in the face.
What about a cappella CDs? Why do they
exist? I can (barely) understand paying
money to attend a live concert but actually

buying a CD? Although this news may come
as a shock to some, each of those songs was at
one point performed by a real, live recording
artist. This artist usually did it a lot better â€”
can you really top Men At Work's rendition
of "Land Down Under"? The answer is no.
As for the auditory assault 1 endure daily
by walking through White Plaza and hearing
a cacophony of different groups, I just want
to say, keep it up. I absolutely love hearing
three different songs at the same time, and
my love of a cappella increases exponential
ly with every lunch-time barrage.
The other night I was walking by Meyer
when 1 happened to notice a few people
standing outside the 24-hour study room,
taking a cigarette break. Now since we all
know that the only legitimate reason to
smoke is to make yourself look cool, I can
only assume that these individuals were
basking in their self-endowed coolness.
Here's the problem: by actually working
in the 24-hour study room, you've given up
any chance of being cool. Your efforts are fu
tile. Throw those Marlboro Ultra Lights
away and spend your money on better
things, like a social life.
The release of the new "Star Wars"
movie this week has gotten many people
on campus into a tizzy as they eagerly line
up in their Chewbacca costumes fora tick
et. I've got news for you people: this one is
not going to match up to the original. In
fact, I'm willing to bet that it doesn't even
come close. New dazzling special effects
are not going to make the movie awesome;
we all saw how George "I'm a shameless
profiteer" Lucas butchered the first trilogy
with his silly computer animation.
And that horrible name. "The Phantom
Menace"? What is that? Why not call it
"Dennis the Phantom Menace"? Or "The
Phantom Tollbooth Menace"? At least those
would be slight improvements.
It's amazing to me how many students on
campus don't like Bob Dylan.Their ignorance is
inexcusable. I recently read something on a
Dylan Web site (why do work when you can
look at Dylan Web sites?) that sounded like a
revelation from above.The quote said one could
divide all popular music into four categories: 1)
Dylan; 2) Music that influenced Dylan; 3) Music
influenced by Dylan and 4) Crap.
The overwhelming majority of music that
