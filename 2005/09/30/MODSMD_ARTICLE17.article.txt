## Even freshmen can teach lessons sometimes 
### JOSH KIENITZ 
If you've forgotten what it was like to live
without carrying the load of maturity and
wisdom on your shoulders, talk to a fresh
man. You might learn a few things. I did.
The other day 1 went out and played
some Frisbee golf with my dorm. I live in
Soto, a four-class dorm. I'm a junior. Most of
the Frisbee players were frosh.
What was I doing playing Frisbee golf
with a bunch of frosh?The only other junior
on this midnight excursion was the resident
assistant. My mature and wise upperclass
men friends were studying somewhere. The
frosh were bouncing around screaming and
hitting each other with their flying discs.
Was I just a wise old man along for the
ride?
No. I was bouncing around screaming
and hitting other people with my flying disc.
It was great. It was spontaneous. I felt like a
kid. Can you imagine? A weathered and
wizened 20-year-old feeling like a kid?
Frankly, I don't feel like a kid often
enough.
A friend of mine actually asked me,
"How are the children?" referring to my life
with freshman in a four-class dorm. That
seems to be the dominant ethic on campus:

A freshman is an 18-year-old child and a
sophomore is a 19 year-old adult. It seems
like there is an amount of maturity and wis
dom that we, as upperclassmen, possess that
freshman don't.
I'm not so sure.
According to Webster:
Maturity, having completed natural
growth and development.
Wisdom: marked by deep understand
ing, keen discernment and a capacity for
sound judgment.
Are we really blessed with these quali
ties in a way that freshmen aren't?
Surely I haven't completed my natural
growth and development. In fact, I would
argue that President Hennessy hasn't com
pleted his natural growth and development.
Development continues as long as we live.
And as for wisdom, we always think we
get wiser as we get older. Just imagine your
self a year ago. See how much wiser you are
now than you were then? And if you are
wiser now than you were at 18. it follows log
ically that you are wiser than most 18-year
olds.
It all sounds fishy to me. Almost every
one on the planet thinks that he has more
