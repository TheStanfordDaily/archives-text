## Even freshmen can teach lessons sometimes 
### JOSH KIENITZ 
If you've forgotten what it was like to live
without carrying the load of maturity and
wisdom on your shoulders, talk to a fresh
man. You might learn a few things. I did.
The other day 1 went out and played
some Frisbee golf with my dorm. I live in
Soto, a four-class dorm. I'm a junior. Most of
the Frisbee players were frosh.
What was I doing playing Frisbee golf
with a bunch of frosh?The only other junior
on this midnight excursion was the resident
assistant. My mature and wise upperclass
men friends were studying somewhere. The
frosh were bouncing around screaming and
hitting each other with their flying discs.
Was I just a wise old man along for the
ride?
No. I was bouncing around screaming
and hitting other people with my flying disc.
It was great. It was spontaneous. I felt like a
kid. Can you imagine? A weathered and
wizened 20-year-old feeling like a kid?
Frankly, I don't feel like a kid often
enough.
A friend of mine actually asked me,
"How are the children?" referring to my life
with freshman in a four-class dorm. That
seems to be the dominant ethic on campus:

A freshman is an 18-year-old child and a
sophomore is a 19 year-old adult. It seems
like there is an amount of maturity and wis
dom that we, as upperclassmen, possess that
freshman don't.
I'm not so sure.
According to Webster:
Maturity, having completed natural
growth and development.
Wisdom: marked by deep understand
ing, keen discernment and a capacity for
sound judgment.
Are we really blessed with these quali
ties in a way that freshmen aren't?
Surely I haven't completed my natural
growth and development. In fact, I would
argue that President Hennessy hasn't com
pleted his natural growth and development.
Development continues as long as we live.
And as for wisdom, we always think we
get wiser as we get older. Just imagine your
self a year ago. See how much wiser you are
now than you were then? And if you are
wiser now than you were at 18. it follows log
ically that you are wiser than most 18-year
olds.
It all sounds fishy to me. Almost every
one on the planet thinks that he has more
wisdom than he used to.
You might be looking back on
your salad days (green, fresh, new,
youthful) as a freshman. You've
come a long way, baby. I certainly
rest easier at night thinking that
I'm at the pinnacle of my wisdom.
It's a comforting thought that our
levels of wisdom and maturity de
fine an ever-upward-sloping curve.
I've learned to be suspicious of
any set of beliefs so blatantly self
serving.
These definitions can't describe a
curve with any real meaning. How
can we place upperclassmen above
freshmen when we are stuck in the
same predictable activities and they

are having fun and exploring new
possibilities? The only way for us to
secure ourselves a place above
freshmen is to change the meaning
of our terms.
1 propose two new definitions for
wisdom and maturity, ones that jive
with reality:
Maturity: when your life has be
come utterly predictable.
Wisdom: something you had less
of when you were younger and will
have more of when you're older.
Using these two new definitions,
it is now possible to say that upper
classmen are wiser and more mature
than freshmen. Upperclassmen
have majors they are committed to,
a relatively static group of friends
and an entrenched daily routine.
Freshmen do not. Freshmen go out
and play Frisbee golf at midnight.
Spontaneity is the opposite of matu
rity in this sense.

Wisdom, under the new defini
tion, is also clearly present in greater
quantities among upperclassmen.
The way to gain true wisdom, in this
sense, is to get older. Using my defi
nition of wisdom, we upperclassmen
can now truly say we have more of it
than freshmen. Quite an achieve
ment, I would say.
So if you're an upperclassman
(or even older) and you're feeling
like your maturity and wisdom have
eclipsed your youth and zeal for ex
ploration, take a look at the fresh
men.
Maturity? Who needs it.
Wisdom? Maybe tomorrow.

He sometimes acted like a freshman.
