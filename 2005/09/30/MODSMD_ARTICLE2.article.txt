## SOMETHING TO PROVE Young tandem leads Cardinal rush attack Kimble and Evans making most of opportunity 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Last season, running backs Anthony Kimble
and Jason Evans watched their teammates suffer
through a rushing game that could make one
cringe. From the bench, they saw their team
mates put up 893 yards rushing to opponents'
1,577 — an average of 2.5 yards per carry. Un
able to help their teammates, except for two car
ries by Evans the entire season, the tandem felt
the pangs of frustration.
"It was real tough sitting on the sidelines,
watching your teammates lose tough losses and
feeling that I could have contributed," Evans, a
sophomore, said.
"We had so much talent but didn't put it to
gether," Kimble added. "It's disappointing for
the seniors. That we got six of them drafted
shows how much talent we had, and it really hurt
that we were so close in so many games."
Today Kimble and Evans are the one-two
punch in Stanford's much improved backfield.
But it was not an easy road for the two — from

the bench to the playing
field.
The two players
rose quickly under the
tutelage of new head
coach Walt Harris.
Slowly but surely the
team's attitude started
to evolve under his
stern watch, and chang
ing practice habits
were the first step.
"Things are a lot
more disciplined," Kim
ble, a Baton Rouge, La.,
native said. "He's a lot
straight[er] and doesn't
take any nonsense."
With that newfound

discipline came a decreased tolerance for mis
takes.
"Last year, if we didn't do it right, we had a
lot of chances," Evans said. "This year we
know to get it done the first time. It's a whole

lot different."
As the staff expected more out of the players,
they grew to expect more out of themselves.
Eventually, the team started to believe in the
coaching staff, the system, and, most importantly,
in each other.
Perhaps no two players highlight the transi
tion better than Kimble and Evans. After the in
dividual and team disappointment of a year ago,
it would have been all too easy for the duo to
slack in the off-season. Instead, they entered
spring ball as barely-used reserves but worked
hard enough over the next six months to enter
this season as the team's top two running backs.
"We had a lot of practice in the summer so I
came into camp working hard," said Evans, who
has rushed for 80 yards this season. "I worked on
everything I could do. I just had to make the
coaches believe."
It's not just the coaches who believed. Harris
and his staff have helped Evans and Kimble
themselves recognize their potential.
"Coach Harris talks about my natural ability
to slash,cut and make people miss," said Kimble,
who has rushed for 110 yards in two games.
"Both he and [running backs coach Wayne]
Moses really liked that."
Harris has also commented on Evans ability
to get upfield and run the sideline drill, which re
quires the Agworth, Ga., native to get low and
finish runs.
With renewed belief, the paired stormed
through their season-opener against Navy. Kim
ble notched a touchdown and 59 yards on 11 car
ries, while Evans picked up an additional 63
yards. With a final score of 41 -38, the pair recog
nized that their efforts truly made a difference.
"After my first long run against Navy, I real
ized I could have a really good season — well be
yond a'we're improved' season, well beyond'we
did good job,"' Kimble said.
There have been bumps along the way, how
ever. Kimble lost a key fumble in the third quar
ter against Davis and didn't see another play for
the rest of the game. The subsequent loss to the
Aggies left a huge blemish on the Cardinal's
young season. However, with a new coach, new
players and a new attitude, the team's ultimate
goals have not wavered.
"We have to come out with a winning sea
son," Evans said. "We have to set ourselves up
for the future and establish that we're not a soft
team like everyone thinks we are."
