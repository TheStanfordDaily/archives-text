# Blackman's Back
## Groupies and other joys of a column 
### DAVID BLACKMAN 
In a reprise from three years ago, we
thought this one would give all those as
piring columnists (i.e., you!) some lessons
for what to expect if The Daily chooses you.
Or maybe just inspiration to turn out a bet
ter, more creative column.
People often ask me, "What's it like being
a columnist for The Daily?" (Well, people
don't generally ask me this, because 1 make it
loud and clear to those around me how hard
it is to be one.)
Believe it or not, there are downsides to
being a columnist. I'm always worried that
I'm going to hit a dud. One week. I just won't
be able to turn it on. and I'll let everyone
down. I worry about revealing too much, like
telling a story about someone I know who
doesn't want it told, and then souring the re
lationship. Or my friends will all start worry
ing about what they tell me for fear it'll turn
into column fodder. Or telling a story about
myself that shouldn't be in the wild and per
manently affecting how people view me.
My week starts on a Tuesday. By then, the
pain of writing last week's column is merely a
distant memory, and lots of random people
are coming up to me and telling me how much
they enjoyed reading it.This is incredibly cool.
I love getting feedback from my readers —
it's that approval that keeps mc writing pub
licly. I'm never quite sure what to say to these
random people other than "thanks." Don't get
me wrong — I sincerely mean it. So if you've
talked to me and felt put off, don't worry. I re
ally do love hearing from y'all. I'm only a pid
dly freshman columnist fora piddly college
newspaper; I don't have that big of a head yet.
Wednesday is still pretty good. My Satur

day evening column deadline is still a long
way away, and there's enough of a constant
stream of compliments about Tuesday's col
umn making me feel like there's no way I
could do any wrong.
By Thursday I'm starting to worry about
what to write about and the realization has
set in that I've added a virtual two-unit
course to my schedule with the addition of
this stupid column that makes me sign away
my publication rights and doesn't even pay
me. (Editor's note: This is a really counter
productive column.) It's usually around now
that I think about quitting. Then I see a copy
of my column on someone's door, and I re
member that I really love writing, and that
one was so good that I reward myself by put
ting off thinking of a topic until tomorrow.
Friday! Today I get to bitch about not hav
ing a topic and consider using the"I have no
topic and have a column due tomorrow" topic
(I'm saving that one for when I have a six to
eight page paper due the next day, as opposed
to this week's three to four page one). Perhaps
I sit down and start my column. In all proba
bility I do something terribly neurotic instead,
like organizing my MP3s. At some point dur
ing the day, my RA will beg me not to write
anything bad about him — he's a little para
noid. Other Oterans keep asking for shout
outs,and some of them deserve it. I'm thinking
as a way to help pay for late night pizzas, I
should start taking paid advertisements in this
column. Shout outs to Morgan, my reluctant
editor, Minna, my reluctant sounding board,
Nina, my reluctant muse, Sarah and Sarah, my
wholesome groupies (Can you believe I have
groupies? Wholesome ones at that?). (Ed:
See, there are benefits!)
In reality, all my writing gets done at some

point on Saturday. (Ed: Thus, you still have
time to apply.)This is when all my weird writ
ing quirks come out. If I'm writing in my
room, I need to be using my laptop, on my
bed, lying prone. And I can't be wearing jeans;
I need to be wearing O R. scrubs ("Oh. arc
they?" "Rushmore" is a great movie) on my
legs. Music choice is also key — needs to be
something that won't irritate me, doesn't re
quire too much mental effort and is some
what calming. If I'm outside... well. I'm
going to be heading to my room once I realize
how terribly trite and contrived it is to be sit
ting outside with a coffee cup and my laptop.
The only thing that would complete the
image of the young, struggling writer is a
black clamshell Powerbook (like the one
Carrie has on "Sex in the City" — speaking
of which, every week I consider writing about
courtship at the Farm and am then reminded
by my editor that the only restriction on my
column is "stay away from dating." (Ed:
Good advice to all of you aspiring colum
nists.) So I figure I can talk about meeting
members of the opposite gender, and sex. but
nothing in between. (Ed: Read 1995 issues of
The Daily if you want bad, bad sex and dating
columns. Don't send them to us.) Let's just
say there's material to work with in this area.
So by Saturday night (Sunday morning). I
have my 5,000 words. Not that I'm happy
with any of them, or even my topic.
Sunday consists of editing my column by
doubling the length of it. then cutting out all
the original text and significantly changing the
topic and resubmitting it to my editor.
Monday night I copy edit. This is usually
the first time my words get to see a spell
checker. This is the first time I put
any thought into a title or a byline.
See, I love long titles.The Daily gives
me three to four words. I like titles
like "This Column Has No Point OR
How 1 Learned to Stop Worrying
and Write Stream of Conscious
ness." My byline is supposed to be
witty and funny, but since I don't
even think about it until I've finished
butchering my column down to the
5,000-character limit and am feeling
rhetorically drained, it's usually a
painful process. Minor edits at The
Daily, removal of cuss words, and I
have a seven-hour reprieve before
my week starts again.
Oh yeah, and at some point dur

ing the week, I go to class, do my
homework, hang out with my friends
and eat.
I've tried to write columns that
everyone can relate to; I'm sorry if
this one doesn't work. Don't worry,
next week I'll talk about my goals for
the next four years or maybe laun
dry. Yeah. Laundry sounds like a
good topic.

In 2002, before he ever thought we'd
bring him back fora recap (as we
did yesterday), David Blackman
was a freshman. His column should
not be used as an example, and
hopefully you have more original
ideas. You still have time to apply. E
tnail two columns and 15 ideas to
opinions@daily. stanford.edu or e
rnail apologies and plead for an ex
tensions to wsado@stanford.edu.
Your first deadline is tonight, Fri
day, Sept. 30.

ing a topic and consider using the"I have no
topic and have a column due tomorrow" topic
(I'm saving that one for when I have a six to
eight page paper due the next day, as opposed
to this week's three to four page one). Perhaps
I sit down and start my column. In all proba
bility I do something terribly neurotic instead,
like organizing my MP3s. At some point dur
ing the day, my RA will beg me not to write
anything bad about him — he's a little para
noid. Other Oterans keep asking for shout
outs,and some of them deserve it. I'm thinking
as a way to help pay for late night pizzas, I
should start taking paid advertisements in this
column. Shout outs to Morgan, my reluctant
editor, Minna, my reluctant sounding board,
Nina, my reluctant muse, Sarah and Sarah, my
wholesome groupies (Can you believe I have
groupies? Wholesome ones at that?). (Ed:
See, there are benefits!)
In reality, all my writing gets done at some

point on Saturday. (Ed: Thus, you still have
time to apply.)This is when all my weird writ
ing quirks come out. If I'm writing in my
room, I need to be using my laptop, on my
bed, lying prone. And I can't be wearing jeans;
I need to be wearing O R. scrubs ("Oh. arc
they?" "Rushmore" is a great movie) on my
legs. Music choice is also key — needs to be
something that won't irritate me, doesn't re
quire too much mental effort and is some
what calming. If I'm outside... well. I'm
going to be heading to my room once I realize
how terribly trite and contrived it is to be sit
ting outside with a coffee cup and my laptop.
The only thing that would complete the
image of the young, struggling writer is a
black clamshell Powerbook (like the one
Carrie has on "Sex in the City" — speaking
of which, every week I consider writing about
courtship at the Farm and am then reminded
by my editor that the only restriction on my
column is "stay away from dating." (Ed:
Good advice to all of you aspiring colum
nists.) So I figure I can talk about meeting
members of the opposite gender, and sex. but
nothing in between. (Ed: Read 1995 issues of
The Daily if you want bad, bad sex and dating
columns. Don't send them to us.) Let's just
say there's material to work with in this area.
So by Saturday night (Sunday morning). I
have my 5,000 words. Not that I'm happy
with any of them, or even my topic.
Sunday consists of editing my column by
doubling the length of it. then cutting out all
the original text and significantly changing the
topic and resubmitting it to my editor.
Monday night I copy edit. This is usually
the first time my words get to see a spell
checker. This is the first time I put
any thought into a title or a byline.
See, I love long titles.The Daily gives
me three to four words. I like titles
like "This Column Has No Point OR
How 1 Learned to Stop Worrying
and Write Stream of Conscious
ness." My byline is supposed to be
witty and funny, but since I don't
even think about it until I've finished
butchering my column down to the
5,000-character limit and am feeling
rhetorically drained, it's usually a
painful process. Minor edits at The
Daily, removal of cuss words, and I
have a seven-hour reprieve before
my week starts again.
Oh yeah, and at some point dur

ing the week, I go to class, do my
homework, hang out with my friends
and eat.
I've tried to write columns that
everyone can relate to; I'm sorry if
this one doesn't work. Don't worry,
next week I'll talk about my goals for
the next four years or maybe laun
dry. Yeah. Laundry sounds like a
good topic.

In 2002, before he ever thought we'd
bring him back fora recap (as we
did yesterday), David Blackman
was a freshman. His column should
not be used as an example, and
hopefully you have more original
ideas. You still have time to apply. E
tnail two columns and 15 ideas to
opinions@daily. stanford.edu or e
rnail apologies and plead for an ex
tensions to wsado@stanford.edu.
Your first deadline is tonight, Fri
day, Sept. 30.
In a reprise from three years ago, we
thought this one would give all those as
piring columnists (i.e., you!) some lessons
for what to expect if The Daily chooses you.
Or maybe just inspiration to turn out a bet
ter, more creative column.
People often ask me, "What's it like being
a columnist for The Daily?" (Well, people
don't generally ask me this, because 1 make it
loud and clear to those around me how hard
it is to be one.)
Believe it or not, there are downsides to
being a columnist. I'm always worried that
I'm going to hit a dud. One week. I just won't
be able to turn it on. and I'll let everyone
down. I worry about revealing too much, like
telling a story about someone I know who
doesn't want it told, and then souring the re
lationship. Or my friends will all start worry
ing about what they tell me for fear it'll turn
into column fodder. Or telling a story about
myself that shouldn't be in the wild and per
manently affecting how people view me.
My week starts on a Tuesday. By then, the
pain of writing last week's column is merely a
distant memory, and lots of random people
are coming up to me and telling me how much
they enjoyed reading it.This is incredibly cool.
I love getting feedback from my readers —
it's that approval that keeps mc writing pub
licly. I'm never quite sure what to say to these
random people other than "thanks." Don't get
me wrong — I sincerely mean it. So if you've
talked to me and felt put off, don't worry. I re
ally do love hearing from y'all. I'm only a pid
dly freshman columnist fora piddly college
newspaper; I don't have that big of a head yet.
Wednesday is still pretty good. My Satur

day evening column deadline is still a long
way away, and there's enough of a constant
stream of compliments about Tuesday's col
umn making me feel like there's no way I
could do any wrong.
By Thursday I'm starting to worry about
what to write about and the realization has
set in that I've added a virtual two-unit
course to my schedule with the addition of
this stupid column that makes me sign away
my publication rights and doesn't even pay
me. (Editor's note: This is a really counter
productive column.) It's usually around now
that I think about quitting. Then I see a copy
of my column on someone's door, and I re
member that I really love writing, and that
one was so good that I reward myself by put
ting off thinking of a topic until tomorrow.
