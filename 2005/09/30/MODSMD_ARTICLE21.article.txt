Letter is criticism,
not anti-Semitism
Daniel Jacohs's attempt to asso
ciate me with Polish anti-Semitism
("Letter portrayed Netanyahu, Is
raelis unfairly," Sept 29) is con
temptible. I have never used the
term "evil Israel," as he implies. As
it happens, I know what anti-Semi
tism is. My aunt and two cousins
died in the Holocaust. But this is ir
relevant. No country should he im
mune from criticism if it violates
human rights and international law.
especially a country that receives
billions of dollars in U.S. aid every
year. Labeling criticism of Israel as
anti-Semitic is an attempt to stifle

debate, and runs counter to the spir
it of Judaism, which values freedom
of inquiry and openness to ideas, as
well as respect for the dignity of all
human beings.

Another kind of rivalry
I agree with Mr. Chen's con
tention ("For some, one rivalry just
doesn't cut it," Sept. 28) that Stan
ford should consider adding a rival
â€” that Cal isn't enough. However,
my reason is slightly different.
UC Davis should be the new rival.
With some improvement on Stan
ford's part, these teams should play

more evenly in the future.
With Jeff Tedford as coach, UC-
Berkeley is way classier than Stan
ford. Football rivalries are about fun,
and what's the fun of having a rival
who is going to pound you?
