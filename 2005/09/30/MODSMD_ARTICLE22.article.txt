## ANDREW ROGERS Moving beyond the gridiron 
### 
Given the recent display (or
lack thereof) of talent by our
football team, many on cam
pus have become depressed about
the state of athletics on the Farm.
While judgment on the Walt Harris
era is a bit premature, losing to a pro
gram that is still transitioning into D-
I doesn't bode well for the rest of the
season. I'm going to throw some
thing out here at the beginning of
this column, something that may get
me lynched if I were back home:
There is life after football.
I know. I know. Grab the torch
and pitchfork. Well, before you fire
up the chainsaw, hear me out. The
Bay Area is the Death Valley of col
lege and professional football. The
Raiders are a woeful 0-3, the Forty-
Niners have apparently fallen from
grace to the point where Mike Nolan
is beginning to not name names, and
as for the Cardinal, well, we've dis
cussed that.
But have faith, my sports brothers
'and sisters, I have seen the light.
While football may dominate televi
sion, radio and pop culture, we here
at Stanford are blessed with a
plethora of elite sports programs,
right here on campus. So next time
you're wallowing in the pit of sports
despair, take a look at some of the
less publicized teams on campus.
I'm going to start with my favorite
— the Stanford women's volleyball
team. Currently ranked No. 3 in the
country, the team has posted a 13-1
record through Wednesday night,
are on a 12-game win-streak and has
only a solitary, close loss to top
ranked Nebraska.
This team is at the peak of its
game. Matches are best of five and
Stanford hasn't lost more than a sin
gle game in the past 12 tilts. The Car
dinal are scary good; maybe the best
team that I've seen in my four years
here at Stanford. You can catch them
at Maples. Come out on Thursday,
Friday or Saturday night, join the
Block Party and watch the team.
Stay in the same building and
fast forward two months. You've got
two teams that have been top-seeds
in the Big Dance in the past two
years. The Stanford men's and
women's basketball teams are an
nual powerhouses in the Pac-10 and
nationally.
The men's team is already
ranked in the preseason top 10 by
some and the women are fresh off a
season where they went to the re
gional finals. The men are led by a
sensational senior combo of Matt
Haryasz, Chris Hernandez and Dan
Grunfeld. Look for the three to lead
the Cardinal to a Pac-10 champi
onship and a long run in the Big
Dance.
The women are led by their top
two returning scorers. Brooke Smith
and Candace Wiggins. While last
year's team was certainly one of the
best in recent memory, this year's
team, with Wiggins at the helm and a
year under her belt,can go just as far
— if not farther than last year.
Maybe the hard court isn't your
place. Just a hop, skip and a dive
away are Stanford's dominant
water sports. Stanford's swimming
and diving teams are consistently in
the top five each year. The women's
synchronized swimming team is
coming off a national championship
as well.
If you really want to see a brutal
battle, however, check out the men
and women's water polo teams. Both
finished as national runner-ups last
year and are back even stronger. Se
niors Peter Varellas and Thomas

Hopkins lead the men's squad,
whieh currently boasts a 6-1 record
through Wednesday and a No. 2
ranking after defeating top-ranked
UCLA. Look for sophomore Peter
Finlayson to contribute on the de
fensive end. Older and wiser than
the rest of the team by a good two
years, (he left on a Mormon mission
the past two seasons) Finlayson is
the last member of the team to be on
both the 2(X)I and 2002 national
championship team.
As for the ladies, they return four
of their top five scorers, including
Christina Hcwko, Scotti Schafer,
Nancy El-Sakkary and Katie
Hansen. Look for pool action from
them in the spring.
Speaking of spring, let's talk
baseball.The Cardinal,after a some
what disappointing season last year,
come back strong and look to make
a run back to the College World Se
ries, which the team missed for only
the second time in the past eight
years.
So freshmen and friends, don't
despair. Football may be down, but
it will be back.and in the meantime,
there are plenty of winners out
there. The best part of it all — you
can catch most of these games for
the low price of free. Bring your
Stanford ID and smile,you'll go far.
Fd give you more, but I'm off to
catch a men's water polo game
against Pacific.

Andrew Rogers is a senior who saw
the Cardinal spank Pacific last night in
almost-perfect evening weather. E
