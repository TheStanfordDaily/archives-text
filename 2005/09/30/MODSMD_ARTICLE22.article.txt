## ANDREW ROGERS Moving beyond the gridiron

Given the recent display (or
lack thereof) of talent by our
football team, many on cam
pus have become depressed about
the state of athletics on the Farm.
While judgment on the Walt Harris
era is a bit premature, losing to a pro
gram that is still transitioning into D-
I doesn't bode well for the rest of the
season. I'm going to throw some
thing out here at the beginning of
this column, something that may get
me lynched if I were back home:
There is life after football.
I know. I know. Grab the torch
and pitchfork. Well, before you fire
up the chainsaw, hear me out. The
Bay Area is the Death Valley of col

Raiders are a woeful 0-3, the Forty-

record through Wednesday night,
are on a 12-game win-streak and has
only a solitary, close loss to top
ranked Nebraska.
This team is at the peak of its
game. Matches are best of five and
Stanford hasn't lost more than a sin
gle game in the past 12 tilts. The Car
dinal are scary good; maybe the best
team that I've seen in my four years
here at Stanford. You can catch them
at Maples. Come out on Thursday,
Friday or Saturday night, join the
Block Party and watch the team.
Stay in the same building and
fast forward two months. You've got
two teams that have been top-seeds
in the Big Dance in the past two
years. The Stanford men's and
