# Men trounce Pacific — Look forward to California
## Cardinal crush the No. 11 Tigers 14-4 at Avery Center 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In an exaggerated sense, this weekend's
match between No. 3 California (6-1) and
No. 2 Stanford (7-1, 1-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) looks to be a showdown

of youth versus experience.
It is the California squad that boasts the
youth — 16 of the 24 players listed on the
Golden Bears' roster are currently under
classmen. and the team's lone seniors are
goalie Nate Bennett and center Tom Kurth.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, dress
only three freshmen for Saturday after
noon's contest at the Spieker Aquatics Com
plex in Berkeley, Calif.Those three — goalie

Jimmy Sandman, two-meter William Hindle-
Katel and driver Chris Jacobson — are the
only members of the Stanford squad who
have not had first-hand exposure to an
NCAA title game. Not surprisingly, the Car
dinal roster claims the distinction of having
more NCAA tournament experience than
any other team in the nation.
Which side holds the advantage remains
to be seen — the Bears and the Cardinal en

tercd the season ranked as collegiate water
polo's second and fourth best teams, respec
tively, but the Cardinal vaulted ahead in the
rankings by reaching the championship
game of the 2005 Southern California Open
two weekends ago.

ment, hosted by UC-Irvine. As expected, the
Bears and the Cardinal reached the semifi
nal round of competition without incident.
In that round, the Bears hung on to an 8-7
lead against Southern California while the
Cardinal took on the defending national
champion UCLA.
But it was Stanford's semifinal perform
ance that sent a mild shock wave reverberat
ing through the collegiate water polo world.
Behind one goal as the clock ticked down at
the end of the fourth period, the Cardinal
tied the game. After two scoreless overtime
periods, the Stanford men finally drew a
penalty at the four-meter mark, and senior
driver Thomas Hopkins netted the penalty
shot to send his team to the title game
against USC.
The Trojans handed the Cardinal their
first loss of the season in the championship
game, but the Bears pulled off the second
major upset of the day by knocking off a
stunned UCLA squad to take third-place in
the tournament.
According to Cardinal captain Peter
Varellas, his squad's performance at the
SoCal tournament is indicative of the team's
potential this season.
"We established ourselves as one of the
teams to beat," Varellas said. "There has
been a lot of speculation this year about who
the top teams are and how they will finish.
Now we have already proven that we can
play with anyone."
He also added that the players who
stepped up during the tournament are criti
cal to the team's success down the stretch.
"As far as our own team goes, the tourna
ment served to answer some questions
about how our team responds to pressure,"
Varellas said. "We saw some great play out
of Will Hindle-Katel, Chris Jacobson, Ryan
Fortune, Sandy Hohener and Forrest
Schwartz — these are they guys that will
make the difference for us this year."
Yesterday evening the Cardinal regained
their momentum with a thorough disman
tling of No. 11 Pacific, 14-4, under the lights
at Avery Aquatic Center. The Stanford men
quickly took control of the game, pressuring
the Tiger defense early and often to take a 4-
0 lead in the first period of play. By the time
the first half came to a close, seven different
members of the squad had contributed a
goal to make the score 7-2 in favor of the
Cardinal.
Statistically, the second half of the con
test proceeded almost exactly as the first
half did. The relentless Cardinal attack tal
lied three goals in the third period and four
more in the fourth to close out a solid effort
in both ends of the pool. Varellas led the
charge for the Cardinal by notching three
goals on the night, while Hindle-Katel, Hop
kins and sophomore Michael Bury all con
tributed two goals apiece. Junior Beau
Stockstill played the first three periods of
the game in net before being relieved by
freshman Jimmy Sandman before the start
of the fourth period.
Thus the stage is set for the first Big
Splash matchup of the year — the Cardinal
know that they face a tough offensive oppo
nent in the Bears and must execute in the
defensive end to keep themselves in the
game.
"We've been focusing on defense," Varel
las said. "We know our offense will always
be there, so our strategy is that if we can hold
our opposition to five goals or less, we
should be okay."
Leading the California attack is junior
utility John Mann, a first team All-American
in 2004 who racked up 60 goals over the
course of his team's 30 game season. Junior
attackers Andrija Vasiljevic and Brian
Bacharach will also be critical figures the
Cardinal defense hopes to shut down.
In the defensive end, the Golden Bears
are anchored by a rock-solid Bennett in goal
and junior center back Marty Matthies —
two players the Cardinal need to to find
scoring opportunities.
