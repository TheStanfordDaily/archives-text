# Men trounce Pacific — Look forward to California
## Cardinal crush the No. 11 Tigers 14-4 at Avery Center 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In an exaggerated sense, this weekend's
match between No. 3 California (6-1) and
No. 2 Stanford (7-1, 1-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) looks to be a showdown

of youth versus experience.
It is the California squad that boasts the
youth — 16 of the 24 players listed on the
Golden Bears' roster are currently under
classmen. and the team's lone seniors are
goalie Nate Bennett and center Tom Kurth.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, dress
only three freshmen for Saturday after
noon's contest at the Spieker Aquatics Com
plex in Berkeley, Calif.Those three — goalie

Jimmy Sandman, two-meter William Hindle-
Katel and driver Chris Jacobson — are the
only members of the Stanford squad who
have not had first-hand exposure to an
NCAA title game. Not surprisingly, the Car
dinal roster claims the distinction of having
more NCAA tournament experience than
any other team in the nation.
Which side holds the advantage remains
to be seen — the Bears and the Cardinal en

tercd the season ranked as collegiate water
polo's second and fourth best teams, respec
tively, but the Cardinal vaulted ahead in the
rankings by reaching the championship
game of the 2005 Southern California Open
two weekends ago.
Both squads posted notably strong per
formances in the 2005 SoCal Open tourna-
