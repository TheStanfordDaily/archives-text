## No. 3 Card extend win streak to 13 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford 41, Oregon State 0. No, that's not a football score.
That's the number of wins in the head-to-head series between
the No. 3 Cardinal women's volleyball team and the Beavers.
Stanford (14-1, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) began its winning
streak against Oregon State during the 1981 season and continued
it last night, 30-19,30-15,30-28. There is no such thing as a sure
thing in sports. But if there were, a Stanford victory in Corvallis
would be one.
Riding the high of dispatching two nationally ranked confer
ence foes at home last week, the Cardinal breezed by the Beavers
(5-4.1-2) with powerful hitting, tenacious defense, and aggressive
serving. Oregon State never gave up. nearly forcing a fourth game,
but had no answer for the firepower of the Stanford front row.
"I was very impressed with the group," head coach John Dun
ning said. "We only had two days of practice and traveled yester
day, so it was a short week for us. You can sometimes have a let
down after big matches.but we didn't at all.The team showed a lot
of maturity and came in and looked focused and really played
great tonight."
Hie Cardinal had one of their best offensive matches of the
season, spearheaded by the freshman combo of middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo and outside hitter Cynthia Barboza. Akin
radewo notched a match-high 14 kills and hit .650, her second
highest percentage of the season. Her six blocks, including four
solo, led the team as well. Barboza also finished with 14 kills, hit
ting .407, and chipped in six digs and five blocks.
"We are doing a lot of good things and tonight we showed
some signs offensively of adding to our game." Dunning said.
"Cynthia mixed it up well with lots of different shots. [Sophomore
setter] Bryn (Kehoe] was really connecting with [junior middle
blocker] Lizzie [Suiter], [freshman] Erin [Waller] and [freshman]
Foluke Akinradewo]. And [sophomore opposite hitter] Franci
[Girard stepped up and played better than she has in a while."
Senior libero Courtney Schultz. the defensive leader on the
court, played solid defense, leading all players with 12 digs. Girard
had one of her best matches since moving from the middle to the
right side, with seven kills on .400 hitting. Junior outside hitter
Kristin Richards continues to be a consistent all-around force on
the court for Stanford, with nine kills, 11 digs, and two blocks on
the night. Suiter, nearly recovered from a severe ankle sprain in
August, played two of the three games and is nearly back to full
strength.
"Her ankle is doing well right now and she's working back."
