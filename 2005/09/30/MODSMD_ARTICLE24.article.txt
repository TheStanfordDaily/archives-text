# Beavers lose 41st straight to Cardinal
## No. 3 Card extend win streak to 13 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford 41, Oregon State 0. No, that's not a football score.
That's the number of wins in the head-to-head series between
the No. 3 Cardinal women's volleyball team and the Beavers.
Stanford (14-1, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) began its winning
streak against Oregon State during the 1981 season and continued
it last night, 30-19,30-15,30-28. There is no such thing as a sure
thing in sports. But if there were, a Stanford victory in Corvallis
would be one.
Riding the high of dispatching two nationally ranked confer
ence foes at home last week, the Cardinal breezed by the Beavers
(5-4.1-2) with powerful hitting, tenacious defense, and aggressive
serving. Oregon State never gave up. nearly forcing a fourth game,
but had no answer for the firepower of the Stanford front row.
"I was very impressed with the group," head coach John Dun
ning said. "We only had two days of practice and traveled yester
day, so it was a short week for us. You can sometimes have a let
down after big matches.but we didn't at all.The team showed a lot
of maturity and came in and looked focused and really played
great tonight."
Hie Cardinal had one of their best offensive matches of the
season, spearheaded by the freshman combo of middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo and outside hitter Cynthia Barboza. Akin
radewo notched a match-high 14 kills and hit .650, her second
highest percentage of the season. Her six blocks, including four
solo, led the team as well. Barboza also finished with 14 kills, hit
ting .407, and chipped in six digs and five blocks.
"We are doing a lot of good things and tonight we showed
some signs offensively of adding to our game." Dunning said.
"Cynthia mixed it up well with lots of different shots. [Sophomore
setter] Bryn (Kehoe] was really connecting with [junior middle
blocker] Lizzie [Suiter], [freshman] Erin [Waller] and [freshman]
Foluke Akinradewo]. And [sophomore opposite hitter] Franci
[Girard stepped up and played better than she has in a while."
Senior libero Courtney Schultz. the defensive leader on the
court, played solid defense, leading all players with 12 digs. Girard
had one of her best matches since moving from the middle to the
right side, with seven kills on .400 hitting. Junior outside hitter
Kristin Richards continues to be a consistent all-around force on
the court for Stanford, with nine kills, 11 digs, and two blocks on
the night. Suiter, nearly recovered from a severe ankle sprain in
August, played two of the three games and is nearly back to full
strength.
"Her ankle is doing well right now and she's working back."

The No. 3 Cardinal defeated Oregon State for the 41 st straight time last night in Corvallis.
The Beavers have never won in the history of the match-up.
Dunning said. "It's almost impossible
not to lose the physical edge when you
have to sit. Her body is probably com
plaining right now, but she did a nice
job tonight."
The Beavers started off the first
game giving the Cardinal the ball
with a service error. Stanford took
advantage and put together a 5-0 run,
forcing an early OSU timeout. After
the Stanford lead ballooned to 13-3,
the Beavers' blockers came up big to
close the gap to six, but Stanford fin
ished on a four-point run started by
Akinradewo and finished by Bar
boza, to take the game 30-19.
Akinradewo was on fire at the
start of the second game, contribut
ing four of the first five points with
two kills and two blocks. Barboza
chipped in five kills in quick succes
sion as the Stanford built a 10-point
lead at the halfway point of the game.
After the Cardinal led by as much as
14, the Beavers went on a short run of
their own, but Akinradewo put an
end to it with a quick swing from the
middle. Barboza and Akinradewo
continued to hit nearly flawlessly,
powering the Cardinal to a 30-15 win
and 2-0 lead in the match.
With several new players coming
off the bench, the Cardinal got off to a
slower start in the third game but took
the lead early and never looked back.
Stanford led by as much as 10, but
OSU came back to trail by only four,
prompting Stanford's first timeout of

the match. The Beavers kept creeping
closer, and Stanford used its second
timeout, leading 29-27. In a position to
tie the game and force extra points,
OSU was called fora net touch viola
tion to give the Cardinal the 30-28 win.
Stanford dealt well with the late
charge by the Beavers; the players
have also been showing their poise
and maturity in balancing their work
with the first road trip of the academ
ic year.
"I don't know how they do it,"
Dunning said. "I have great respect for
their time management because it is
really hard. 1 know the freshmen want
to get into their classes and not miss
two days in the first week of school.
They spend a lot of time reading in the
airport and they are studying in their
rooms waiting for the games* It's hard
but they are doing well."
The three-game victory over
OSU should keep Stanford at the top
of the Pac-10 rankings and also gives
the team its third straight sweep over
conference opponents. The Cardinal
will try to continue that trend tonight
against Oregon (who fell last night to
No. 14 California), with next Satur
day's match against No. 2 and unde
feated Washington looming on the
horizon.
"We have already played half of
the matches of our season and the
girls are really going after each one,"
Dunning said. "That's a good sign
and something we hope to continue.
We have been really consistent with
passing and serving and setting and
digging. On the offense, we want to
go into practice this week and exe
cute and get into a groove before
Washington."

Stanford takes on Oregon at home this Saturday. The Ducks have beaten the Cardinal in each of the last three meet
ings, including a 16-1 3 win in Palo Alto last year.
Stanford 41, Oregon State 0. No, that's not a football score.
That's the number of wins in the head-to-head series between
the No. 3 Cardinal women's volleyball team and the Beavers.
Stanford (14-1, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) began its winning
streak against Oregon State during the 1981 season and continued
it last night, 30-19,30-15,30-28. There is no such thing as a sure
thing in sports. But if there were, a Stanford victory in Corvallis
would be one.
Riding the high of dispatching two nationally ranked confer
ence foes at home last week, the Cardinal breezed by the Beavers
(5-4.1-2) with powerful hitting, tenacious defense, and aggressive
serving. Oregon State never gave up. nearly forcing a fourth game,
but had no answer for the firepower of the Stanford front row.
"I was very impressed with the group," head coach John Dun
ning said. "We only had two days of practice and traveled yester
day, so it was a short week for us. You can sometimes have a let
down after big matches.but we didn't at all.The team showed a lot
of maturity and came in and looked focused and really played
great tonight."
Hie Cardinal had one of their best offensive matches of the
season, spearheaded by the freshman combo of middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo and outside hitter Cynthia Barboza. Akin
radewo notched a match-high 14 kills and hit .650, her second
highest percentage of the season. Her six blocks, including four
solo, led the team as well. Barboza also finished with 14 kills, hit
ting .407, and chipped in six digs and five blocks.
"We are doing a lot of good things and tonight we showed
some signs offensively of adding to our game." Dunning said.
"Cynthia mixed it up well with lots of different shots. [Sophomore
setter] Bryn (Kehoe] was really connecting with [junior middle
blocker] Lizzie [Suiter], [freshman] Erin [Waller] and [freshman]
Foluke Akinradewo]. And [sophomore opposite hitter] Franci
[Girard stepped up and played better than she has in a while."
Senior libero Courtney Schultz. the defensive leader on the
court, played solid defense, leading all players with 12 digs. Girard
had one of her best matches since moving from the middle to the
right side, with seven kills on .400 hitting. Junior outside hitter
Kristin Richards continues to be a consistent all-around force on
the court for Stanford, with nine kills, 11 digs, and two blocks on
the night. Suiter, nearly recovered from a severe ankle sprain in
August, played two of the three games and is nearly back to full
strength.
"Her ankle is doing well right now and she's working back."

The No. 3 Cardinal defeated Oregon State for the 41 st straight time last night in Corvallis.
The Beavers have never won in the history of the match-up.
Dunning said. "It's almost impossible
not to lose the physical edge when you
have to sit. Her body is probably com
plaining right now, but she did a nice
job tonight."
The Beavers started off the first
game giving the Cardinal the ball
with a service error. Stanford took
advantage and put together a 5-0 run,
forcing an early OSU timeout. After
the Stanford lead ballooned to 13-3,
the Beavers' blockers came up big to
close the gap to six, but Stanford fin
ished on a four-point run started by
Akinradewo and finished by Bar
boza, to take the game 30-19.
Akinradewo was on fire at the
start of the second game, contribut
ing four of the first five points with
two kills and two blocks. Barboza
chipped in five kills in quick succes
sion as the Stanford built a 10-point
lead at the halfway point of the game.
After the Cardinal led by as much as
14, the Beavers went on a short run of
their own, but Akinradewo put an
end to it with a quick swing from the
middle. Barboza and Akinradewo
continued to hit nearly flawlessly,
powering the Cardinal to a 30-15 win
and 2-0 lead in the match.
With several new players coming
off the bench, the Cardinal got off to a
slower start in the third game but took
the lead early and never looked back.
Stanford led by as much as 10, but
OSU came back to trail by only four,
prompting Stanford's first timeout of

the match. The Beavers kept creeping
closer, and Stanford used its second
timeout, leading 29-27. In a position to
tie the game and force extra points,
OSU was called fora net touch viola
tion to give the Cardinal the 30-28 win.
Stanford dealt well with the late
charge by the Beavers; the players
have also been showing their poise
and maturity in balancing their work
with the first road trip of the academ
ic year.
"I don't know how they do it,"
Dunning said. "I have great respect for
their time management because it is
really hard. 1 know the freshmen want
to get into their classes and not miss
two days in the first week of school.
They spend a lot of time reading in the
airport and they are studying in their
rooms waiting for the games* It's hard
but they are doing well."
The three-game victory over
OSU should keep Stanford at the top
of the Pac-10 rankings and also gives
the team its third straight sweep over
conference opponents. The Cardinal
will try to continue that trend tonight
against Oregon (who fell last night to
No. 14 California), with next Satur
day's match against No. 2 and unde
feated Washington looming on the
horizon.
"We have already played half of
the matches of our season and the
girls are really going after each one,"
Dunning said. "That's a good sign
and something we hope to continue.
We have been really consistent with
passing and serving and setting and
digging. On the offense, we want to
go into practice this week and exe
cute and get into a groove before
Washington."
