# PREVIEW
## Stanford faces Oregon in Pac-10 showdown By ANDREW LOMELI 
### 
The Pacific 10 Conference is
known as the "Conference of
Champions," and rightfully so. at
least in women's volleyball. Stan
ford (14-1, 3-0 Pac-10), which trav
els to Oregon tonight, has found a
more-than-suitable niche in that
conference.
The Cardinal have won six na
tional championships, with South
ern California and UCLA each
adding three of their own. Washing
ton is currently ranked No. 2 in the
nation, right ahead of No. 3 Stan
ford. The Huskies and the Cardinal
both began their seasons undefeat
ed in conference play, as did No. 13
Arizona and No. 14 California.
With such talent packed into the
conference, it's easy to see why ex
perienced coaches choose to lead
Pac-10 programs. Tonight at 7 p.m.
the Cardinal face first-year Oregon
coach Jim Moore â€” one of the lat
est additions.
"It's nice to have [Moore] in the
conference." Stanford coach John
Dunning said. "F.very school in the
conference has a great coach, so
we're used to it."
Moore has made a name for him
self by rebuilding programs. Since
1989. he has inherited losing pro
grams at Kansas State, Texas, Chico
State and Northern Michigan and
eventually led each team to a win
ning season. Over the coursc of 16
years, Moore has produced a .693
winning percentage with teams that
had averaged .425 before his ar
rival.
So far this season, Moore has
lived up to his mandate. His 10-1
start with Oregon is the school's
best record fora new coach since
the team's very first season.

climbing to .247 through Thursday
evening, from .172 last season.
Blocking has been another strength
for the Ducks, who are averaging
2.9 blocks per game after averaging
less than two last year.
Oregon can hope to build on
those statistics and ignore past
numbers in its home opener in Eu
gene. The Cardinal swept both
matches in six games against Ore
gon last season.

senior outside hitter Kelly Russell,
who checks in with a .350 hitting av
erage and 4.33 kills per game.
