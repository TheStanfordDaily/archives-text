# ON THE RUN
## Cross country headed for East Coast New coach, Couper, provides valuable experience 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend the men's and women's
cross country squads are scheduled to travel
across the continent to compete at the Mur
ray Keatinge Invitational in Orono, Maine.
Assistant coach Ashley Couper's knowledge
should come in handy for this race and the
rest of the season.
The group represents a portion of the
team that did not compete last week at the
Stanford Invitational. In terms of who could
stand out on the team this weekend, head
coach Peter Tegen says it is still an open book.
"We kind of have an idea," Tegen said.
"Again, some of those who are running this
weekend haven't run yet at all. I'm trying to
find out who is at what point, and who is
ready to go, who will come through. They're
not supposed to hammer quite yet."
The "hammering" will not start until com
petition heats up with the Pre-NCAA's meet
in mid-October, followed by the Pacific-10
Conference Championships, NCAA Region
al and finally the NCAA Championships.
For now, the runners are concentrating on
building their endurance and not overdoing
their training.
"Our focus is at the end of the season,"
added Couper, also new to the Cardinal pro
gram this year. She knows the Maine course
well, as she ran it in 1999 while running for
Vermont.
"It's pretty flat so it will be pretty fast,"
Couper said. "A big chunk of it is in the
woods, on a narrow path, and most likely it
will be pretty chilly."
Although Couper is new to the coaching
staff, she is familiar with Stanford. In 2001,
she spent one year on the Farm earning a
master's degree and using her NCAA eligi
bility to run indoor and outdoor track with
the Cardinal.
Couper was an All-American that year,
placing sixth in the 1,500-meter at the NCAA
Outdoor Championships. Couper also fin
ished the season with Pac-10 All-Academic
honors.
"It was a great year, definitely one of my
best years running wise." Couper said.
Couper plans to travel with the team to
Maine this weekend, in place of Tegen.
"The teams did really well two years ago
[at Maine]," Couper said. "Some of our peo
ple running are freshman so we just want to
let them get out there and get some experi
ence."
The women plan to run a 5,000-meter
course, while the men race on an 8,000-meter
course. Couper hopes the strategy of running
as a group, which seems to be common this
year and years previous for the Cardinal,
works at Maine this weekend.
"Two years ago they went and all the
women finished together," Couper said. "We
are hoping that both the men and women will
stay together throughout the race as much as
they can this time as well."
Though the team tends to work off of each
other and run in small packs, Couper, who is
also just getting to know the team along with
Tegen, has already seen the preeminence of
some of the Cardinal runners.
"I would say on the women's side [sopho
more] Arianna Lambie is a person definitely
to watch throughout the season," Couper
said. "[Sophomore] Teresa McWalters and
the [junior] Trotter twins as well. We have a
great team this year, both the women and the
men."
