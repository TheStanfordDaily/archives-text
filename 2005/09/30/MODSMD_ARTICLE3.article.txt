# Stanford aims for an upset
## Cardinal looking to bounce back after loss to UC-Davis 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Three weeks ago the Cardinal, led by first-year head coach
Walt Harris, were the talk of Palo Alto, having knocked off
Navy in Annapolis. After three long, losing seasons it seemed
as if Harris might be the one to change things for the better on
the Farm. Against the Midshipmen, the Cardinal offense
marched up and down the field, overcame mistakes that could
have cost Stanford the game and the defense did all it had to do
in order to get the victory.
But, as the Cardinal (1-1,0-0 Pacific-10 Conference) take
the field this Saturday at Stanford Stadium to open their Pac-

1U schedule against
the Oregon Ducks (3-
1,0-1), the story is dra
matically different. A
crushing home loss
two weeks ago to UC-
Davis has turned Stan
ford from a team on
the rise to a squad re
sembling one from the
last three seasons.

200 yards. Meanwhile, the Aggies, who had previously lost to
New Hampshire and Portland State, came to Stanford and out
gained the Cardinal with 251 yards.
Despite the fact that Stanford is one of only two Division 1-
A teams to lose to a Division 1-AA team this season, there is
still confidence that the team can build on the loss.
"We have something to prove now — that the UC-Davis
game was a fluke," senior cornerback T.J. Rushing said at a
press conference earlier this week. "It would be easy to fold up
the tents and just say we're horrible,' but we don't believe that
at all. We believe that we're a great football team that's going
to do great things this year."
Oregon will be a difficult opponent for the Cardinal in their
quest to reestablish themselves as a competitor in the Pac-10.
The Ducks, who have been ranked in the top 25 at points this
season, are a team with a potent offense and have had success
against Stanford in the past.
Oregon has won three straight against the Cardinal, includ
ing a heartbreaking 16-13 win at Stanford last season. In that
game, a would-be game-tying 49-yard field goal attempt by
Michael Sgroi fell short as time expired. The Oregon defense
out-muscled Stanford's offensive line, recording 10 sacks, in
cluding one that knocked starting quarterback TVent Edwards

out of the game.
This season, the Ducks have relied
heavily on senior quarterback Kellen
Clemens, who is averaging nearly 300
yards passing per game and has not
thrown a single interception in Ore
gon's first four games. Clemens is also
a threat to run the ball. He is the
team's second leading rusher and has
only 30 yards less than the Duck's
starting tailback Terrance White
head.
"[Clemens] is very efficient and
effective," Harris said. "He throws
the ball well and is good at getting
away from the rush. Anytime, you
have a guy that can run around back
there and hurts you when he runs, it
makes it very challenging fora de
fense."
Clemens led the Ducks last week
to a 13-0 lead over No. 1 USC, before
eventually losing 45-13. Despite the
final outcome, Oregon showed that it
could keep up with the best team in
the country, at least fora little while.

"I thought they looked real good and played hard," Rushing
said of Oregon's effort against USC. "Their offense is going to
present us with some problems. We need to be sound in our de
fensive assignments."
The defense that gave the Cardinal so much trouble last sea-
son is strengthened this year by
the full return of junior defensive
tackle Haloti Ngata. Nagata suf
fered a knee injury early in the
2003 season, and played at partial
strength last year. He is expected
to be back in full health this sea
son, and will present a challenge
for Stanford's offensive line.
"We're up against a big. phys
ical team on both sides of the
ball," Harris said. "Their athletes
have great speed and size. We
have a tall challenge this week,
and we're looking forward to our
opportunity."
It is an opportunity that Stan
ford can hardly afford to waste.
After the Davis loss, a victory over
a solid Oregon team would be a
big step toward a successful sea
son.
"We're playing for the Pac-10
championship and this is the first
opportunity for us to do that,"
Harris said. "We just have a lot of
work to do and a lot of tightening
up to do. But. we have good foot
ball players who care a lot and put
a lot into it. We had a not so proud
weekend, but we're working hard
and are very motivated to change
it."
