# Watch Out, We Don't Bite
## 
### BETSY CONGDON CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION EDITORS 
Welcome to Volume 228 of
The Stanford Review. Oh,
wait, we're not pricks. Nor do
we kill manatees. Sorry. We
hope you enjoy Volume 228 of
The Progressive. Oh, wait, we
actually do stuff. Stop being
progressive and HAVE a pro
gressive, damn it. So, really,
welcome to a new year of The
Chaparral. Oh, wait, we actual
ly leave once we graduate.
Well, except for Brendan. But
he IS "The Man" now so it's
a'ight.
But we digress.
In case you haven't noticed
(and it's okay if you haven't,
we're all about inclusion here
at Intermission) you have now
entered the new era of Inter
mission.
The dynamic Tarn Vo has
been one of the Intermission
editors for the past... what is it
now? Two hundred and twen
ty-seven volumes? We are gen
tly trying to ease her back into
her real life by taking over In
termission. She remains our in
spiration and her help on this
issue has been invaluable. We
strive not to fail you, Tam!
We also could not be writing
this Pulitzer worthy piece if it
weren't for Brendan, Victor,
Joseph and Sam.
Oh, Brendan. We still love
you even though you sold out
to "The Man." You used to be
one of us. and... really, you still

are. We are grateful your soul
remains with Intermission.
Victor has been here since our
conception and watched us
grow from infants to, well, as
this is our first issue, let's go
with 18 (old enough to know
better, but young enough not
to give a shit). He is tireless and
we are envious of his secretari
al skills.
What you see in front of you
came from the imagination
and talent of Joseph Bergen.
You are the sunshine of our
lives and we may name our ille
gitimate children after you.
Maybe.
Sam. Thanks for that email
last week. We literally would
not be here if you had agreed

to take this job. We have yet to
decide who made the wiser
choice.
Our couples therapist recom
mended we say something nice
about The Daily, but really we
only like Camille. She's the
pretty one.
Now that we've thoroughly
lost your attention and made
almost as many inside jokes as
the Chappie, we should men
tion a lil' somethin' about the
actual volume.
In this volume we will strive
to be high-class and low-brow.
We hope to bring you more in
terviews, more themes, possi
bly some pictures of Kenny G
and, if you ask nicely,
coke(aine). But if the cops

stop you, you didn't get it from
us.
If you have any questions,
comments, "concerns." or
food, don't hesitate to call us at
650-725-2100 ex.512 or email
us at intermission@daily.stan
ford.edu. Think before you
type, as we reserve the right to
publish anything we receive
(and if it's especially neat-o we
might publish your name,
too!).
Thanks for reading and we
hope you enjoy what's in store
for you.
Betsy and Caley
P.S. Fuck the manatees. Save
the jumbucks.


JOHN SHEN/The Stanford Daily
Yeah...we are the ones that look stupid on the edges. Don't we look so happy to be starting the
volume?
