### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, BARGAINING EXPERT 
Roxy seems to recall a fashion and style arti
cle that told you kids not to spend all your money
at Ikea last week. What's so sexy about furniture
that doesn't have any vowels in its name? Noth
ing. Unless you're into that sort of thing.
Silly Stanford students, you never listen.
That's why you've had to spend the last three
nights listening to your neighbors have sex on
trampolines. Take a good look around your
room. Chances are, you're living in a one-room

double that doesn't leave much to the imagina
tion. So what's a broke-ass college kid to do?
Craigslist? Nah, Roxy doesn't trust guys named
Craig. They don't get laid that often. Ebay?
Takes too long. Fora cost-effective quick fix,
head to your friendly local garage sale!
Feeling kitschy and kinky? Pick up a few gar
den gnomes and pink plastic flamingos from that
little old lady in Palo Alto. For the sexually ad
venturous, the curves on these lawn decorations
are very, very convenient. Many household ap
pliances such as electric toothbrushes, curling
irons and personal massagers have lesser-known

dual purposes. Sure beats the hell out of that ex
pensive Rabbit vibrator that retails for at least a
hundred dollars. Also, a voluminous muumuu
seem very convenient for those days you want to
walk down the hallway to the coed bathroom but
your hard-on is unrestrained by those flimsy
boxers. It worked for Homer Simpson.
The best days for garage sales are Thursdays,
Fridays and Saturdays. These are also the days
people are more likely to have sex. Use that to
your advantage. Buy your crush the glass vase
she's been looking at, and then persuade her to
hook up with you behind the vintage wardrobe

by the appliances table. Sweeten the deal by
telling her that you'll steal some lingerie for her.
Need a place to fuck but can't pry your gi
gantic nerd roomie away from his desk? Garage
sales have plenty of nooks and crannies with all
the junk on the yard. Try sixty-nine under the
table that's littered with sweaters and vests that
smell of old people, not the silverware/glassware
table - too much clinking and clanking ain't
classy. Throw a shag rug over the concrete to
soften the friction.
