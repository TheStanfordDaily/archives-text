### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, BARGAINING EXPERT 
Roxy seems to recall a fashion and style arti
cle that told you kids not to spend all your money
at Ikea last week. What's so sexy about furniture
that doesn't have any vowels in its name? Noth
ing. Unless you're into that sort of thing.
Silly Stanford students, you never listen.
That's why you've had to spend the last three
nights listening to your neighbors have sex on
trampolines. Take a good look around your
room. Chances are, you're living in a one-room

double that doesn't leave much to the imagina
tion. So what's a broke-ass college kid to do?
Craigslist? Nah, Roxy doesn't trust guys named
Craig. They don't get laid that often. Ebay?
Takes too long. Fora cost-effective quick fix,
head to your friendly local garage sale!
Feeling kitschy and kinky? Pick up a few gar
den gnomes and pink plastic flamingos from that
little old lady in Palo Alto. For the sexually ad
venturous, the curves on these lawn decorations
are very, very convenient. Many household ap
pliances such as electric toothbrushes, curling
irons and personal massagers have lesser-known

dual purposes. Sure beats the hell out of that ex
pensive Rabbit vibrator that retails for at least a
hundred dollars. Also, a voluminous muumuu
seem very convenient for those days you want to
walk down the hallway to the coed bathroom but
your hard-on is unrestrained by those flimsy
boxers. It worked for Homer Simpson.
The best days for garage sales are Thursdays,
Fridays and Saturdays. These are also the days
people are more likely to have sex. Use that to
your advantage. Buy your crush the glass vase
she's been looking at, and then persuade her to
hook up with you behind the vintage wardrobe

by the appliances table. Sweeten the deal by
telling her that you'll steal some lingerie for her.
Need a place to fuck but can't pry your gi
gantic nerd roomie away from his desk? Garage
sales have plenty of nooks and crannies with all
the junk on the yard. Try sixty-nine under the
table that's littered with sweaters and vests that
smell of old people, not the silverware/glassware
table - too much clinking and clanking ain't
classy. Throw a shag rug over the concrete to
soften the friction.
Sells herself cheap on a front lawn

Justify a hook-up session to the
irate owner of the garage by asking
calmly, "Well now, 1 wouldn't buy a
mattress that 1 hadn't tested, would I?
Why would you sell it if it were still
comfort able?" If you're a germ freak
about previously owned mattresses,
think about this: how many years do

you think your
musty, stained
dorm mattress
has been around
for?
Avoid sec
ondhand com
pute; key
boards. Why,
you ask? The
previous user
probably has
carpal tunnel
syndrome, and
not because they
type 150 WPM.
But Roxy, I
don't get it. you
complain.
Cough*
bukkake*
cough. Thank

high-speed internet.
Apparently there are self-pro
claimed "amazing garage sales" that
cause traffic jams and huge crowds.
Take that opportunity and crowd of
bodies to discreetly hump the object
of your affection. 1 112 that only results in
looks of confusion and disgust from
the person you have just humped,
blame the guy standing next to you.
Can't afford that eight-track
you've been eyeing for the last twen
ty minutes? Garage sales are all about

bartering, so offer a blowjob or two to
offset the difference. Then blow the
money you saved on vinyl records at
Amoeba. Mmm. vinyl.
On the flip side of things, perhaps
you have tons of useless crap that
you've accumulated over the years. If
you're tired of being nearly decapitat-

Ed by your toaster oven every time
you open your storage closet, perhaps
it's time to sell it. Dating someone
new but afraid she'll find your mas
sive pom stash and copies of "Back
door Sluts 9"? Just broke up with
someone and you don't want to give
them their sound system and shit
back? Have a garage sale! Doesn't
matter if it's out the back of your car,
you know hard-up SLE kids will buy
it. I don't care if you're dedicated to
the craft of knowledge, no amount of

Schopenhauer will help you when
you're that horny.
Advertise to local high schoolers.
Everyone wants "real college stu
dent" gear, even if it's a bunch of used
snotgfasses and extra-long twin
sheets. If you've just moved into Es
condido Village and realize you don't

need your kegera
tor anymore, con
vince others to
take it away from
you. Just remem
ber when you're
haggling with that
pretty brunette
from Menlo Park
for a blowjob -
she's probably jail
bait.
People also love
stuff that they can't
quite figure out
(we're idiots,
aren't we?). Throw
some shit inside an
intriguing box and
call it the "mystery
gift" box Mark up
the price, explain-

ing that "it's so awesome you'll be
glad you paid for the surprise."
So whether it's a bookshelf made
of real wood, cheap golfclubs, post
modern art, a floor lamp or drugs
(conveniently hidden in a sketchy
mattress) you're looking for, a garage
sale's the place to go. Even if you're
not going to really buy anything, it
sure beats the hell out of hooking up
in the dorm janitorial closet. Roxy
hears those industrial broom handles
leave splinters.

mattress that 1 hadn't tested, would I?
Why would you sell it if it were still
comfort able?" If you're a germ freak
about previously owned mattresses,
think about this: how many years do

you think your
musty, stained
dorm mattress
has been around
for?
Avoid sec

you ask? The

probably has
carpal tunnel

not because they
type 150 WPM.
But Roxy, I
don't get it. you
complain.

high-speed internet.
Apparently there are self-pro
claimed "amazing garage sales" that
cause traffic jams and huge crowds.
Take that opportunity and crowd of
bodies to discreetly hump the object
of your affection. 1 112 that only results in
looks of confusion and disgust from
the person you have just humped,
blame the guy standing next to you.
Can't afford that eight-track
you've been eyeing for the last twen
ty minutes? Garage sales are all about

bartering, so offer a blowjob or two to
offset the difference. Then blow the
money you saved on vinyl records at
Amoeba. Mmm. vinyl.
On the flip side of things, perhaps
you have tons of useless crap that
you've accumulated over the years. If
you're tired of being nearly decapitat-

Ed by your toaster oven every time
you open your storage closet, perhaps
it's time to sell it. Dating someone
new but afraid she'll find your mas
sive pom stash and copies of "Back
door Sluts 9"? Just broke up with
someone and you don't want to give
them their sound system and shit
back? Have a garage sale! Doesn't
matter if it's out the back of your car,
you know hard-up SLE kids will buy
it. I don't care if you're dedicated to
the craft of knowledge, no amount of

Schopenhauer will help you when
you're that horny.
Advertise to local high schoolers.
Everyone wants "real college stu
dent" gear, even if it's a bunch of used
snotgfasses and extra-long twin
sheets. If you've just moved into Es
condido Village and realize you don't

need your kegera
tor anymore, con
vince others to
take it away from
you. Just remem
ber when you're
haggling with that
pretty brunette
from Menlo Park
for a blowjob -
she's probably jail
bait.
People also love
stuff that they can't
quite figure out
(we're idiots,
aren't we?). Throw
some shit inside an
intriguing box and
call it the "mystery
gift" box Mark up
the price, explain-

ing that "it's so awesome you'll be
glad you paid for the surprise."
So whether it's a bookshelf made
of real wood, cheap golfclubs, post
modern art, a floor lamp or drugs
(conveniently hidden in a sketchy
mattress) you're looking for, a garage
sale's the place to go. Even if you're
not going to really buy anything, it
sure beats the hell out of hooking up
in the dorm janitorial closet. Roxy
hears those industrial broom handles
leave splinters.
