## Oliver? I Barely Knew her! Rape charges can't keep a good director down 
### JOSHUA SMITH INTERMISSION STREET URCHIN 
The esteemed director / statutory rapist Roman
Polanski returns to the theme of desperate isola
tion that garnered him an Academy Award for the
devastatingly beautiful "The Pianist" with a new
film adaptation of the Dickens classic "Oliver
Twist." Though a straight-forward literary transla
tion absent seemingly übiquitous hot young movie
stars, the expertly paced 135-minute epic manages
to remain entertaining and suspenseful through
out. never bogging down in stuffiness or self-im
portance.
In Poianski's film, young Oliver, much like the
protagonist in"The Pianist" and the ghetto-es
capee director himself, faces horrors and wicked
ness grotesque almost to the point of sheer absur
dity. Like Adrian Biddy's innocent musician
thrown into survival mode by the Holocaust
around him, Oliver too has no control of his cir
cumstances. Throughout his (mis)adventures,
Oliver is consistently at the mercy of adults, some
good and some malevolent, and not a one in be
tween.
Upon the occasion of his ninth birthday, Oliver
(played, with a tear-streaked sincerity that leaves
little room for anything else, by the London school
boy Barney Clark) is given the boot from the or
phanage he has sadly known his whole life ancs||-
posited in a workhouse with other starving
lads, overseen by an overfed and over facial-hatred
panel of crotchety old men.

After being thrown out of the workhouse due to his au
dacity of asking for more gruel at dinnert ime (personally,
I liked Stewie Griffin's rendition of "Please sir. 1 want
some more" better, but that's-really tough to beat), Oli\-
er bounces from one dehumanizing situation, to another
before setting out for Condon and finding himself mixed
up with a band of young thieves, led by the Artful Dodger,
certainly one of the best character names in the whole of
the English literary canon. Oliver quickly finds himself
caught between two worlds, that of the Dodger. Fagin and
the maniacal Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman) who want to
keep poor Oliver in harm's way, and the one inhabited by
the kindly Mr. Brownlow (Edward llardwicke). who
wishes to bring the boy to safety.
The unifying theme of those entrusted to care for the
orphan is their absolute need for Oliver's gratitude, as all
believe they are somehow doing him a huge favor by sub
jecting him to various forms of misery. In Polanski's vision
the characters are not fleshed out beyond this: either they
want to be thanked for thinking they deserve it of because
they actually do. The only exceptions here are Sykes. who
is very clearly evil incarnate, and Oliver himself, whose
benevolence is never explained, but seems as random as
the short straw he draws, both literally in the workhouse
with the other boys, and figuratively in life altogether.
Instead, in this plot-driven film, motivations (like
Fagin's Jewishness, predictably and perhaps thankfully)
are glossed over. What we are left with is a gloomy, capti
vating bedtime story replete with action and humor. Re
fusing to succumb to the drab Victorian trappings, "Oliv
er Twist" is never so dark as to fall into self-obsession, but
remains instead, for better or worse, just the story of an
ordinary boy in trying times.
