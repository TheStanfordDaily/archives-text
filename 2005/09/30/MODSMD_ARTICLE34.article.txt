Raising Arizona (1987)
Nicolas Cage is a convict with a habit of
robbing convcniencc stores. Holly Hunter is
the policewoman who takes his mug shot
every time he stops by the county jail for his
nine-month stays. It's love at first sight.
They desperately want to have kids, but Ed
(Hunter) Ls baitcn and the criminal record of
H.I. (Cage) prevents them from adopting, so
they do the logical thing — steal a baby. The
first in the black comedy genre that the Cocn
brothers have mastered, "Raising Arizona"
was also their first stab at the modern form of
mangled mythology they perfected in "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" A mythical, ar
chetypal villain, with a Cocn twist — a motor

cyclist from hell, intent on destroying every
thing in his path — descends on banal subur
ban America to reclaim the baby. As in
"Fargo," the savage is more honor tblc —
and well : spoken — than the charae exs hq
encounters from civilization, an astut: com
mentary on a modern world that the Coehs
suggest may be a step backward. The typicai
Coen morality play-with-a-twist alsooj prates
in "Raising Arizona": in the end, th a right
things happen, and the right people g 4 pun
ished —not for the right reasons, but becausc*
of a scries of mistakes and accidents com
pound to create a just result. No one is pun
ished directly for his or her misdeeds, but one
way or the other, they get what's coming to
them.

Wayne's World (1992)
The seminal pop culture comedy of
the early-'9os, "Wayne's World" was
n robably the best movie to emerge out of
tlie Saturday Night Live Factory. Wayne
( ampbell (Mike Meyers) and Garth
V s lgar (Dana Carvcy) host a public access
show in Aurora, Illinois that gets bought
ojt by a larger network station, run by
Aio-smooth producer Benjamin (Rob
■ owe). The entire film is a series of di
fc essions within digressions and pushes
a isurdist comcdy further than any main
si ream movie had before. Wayne, Garth
a id the camera crew sing the bulk of "Bo
nemian Rhapsody" in their car, less than
10 minutes into the movie. They riff on
corporate America: "Contract or no, I

won't bow to any sponsor,"Wayne says, •
as he takes a bite of a Pizza Hut pizza
Garth parodies Jimi Hendrix's "Foxey
Lady" in a dream sequence, and Meyers
is hilariously self-awaro of the movie's
random moments. When Chris Farley in
explicably reveals a major plot point at
the Alice Cooper concert — a digression
in itself — Wayne says, "You know, fora
security guard, he had an awful lot of in
formation, don't you thmk?" At-the end,
the film turns into a parody of the 'multi
ple ending' convention, which is fitting
fora movie about a TV show. As the film
progresses, Wayne loses his show for
making fun of the sponsor, loses ljis girl
friend Cassandra to Benjamin and even
loses Garth, his best friend. But the
humor never lags.

Bottle Rocket (19%)
Wes Anderson's first film showcases
Luke and Owen Wilson as bored suburban
kids who imagine a life of crime for them
selves. Owen's crew-cutted Dignan is the
first and perhaps best example of Ander
son's overly-ambitious character style,
whose imagined lives far outstrip reality.
Dignan, in an attempt to convince Anthony
(Luke) to join in his big heist, says: "Here are

just a few of the key ingredients: dynamite,
pole vaulting, laughing gas, choppers—can
you see how incredible this is going to be?
Hang gliding, come on!" The visuals are col
orful and detailed, the dialogue is honed and
idiosyncratic and, as in every one of Ander
son's films, the minor characters are hilari
ous. It's probably his most nuanced film, and
the subtle comedy holds up better on re
peated viewings than the videotape will.

An off-the-wall love triangle develops

through someone else's eyes and our lust for
eternal life. Plus, it features a talking parrot.

Raising Arizona (1987)
Nicolas Cage is a convict with a habit of
robbing convcniencc stores. Holly Hunter is
the policewoman who takes his mug shot
every time he stops by the county jail for his
nine-month stays. It's love at first sight.
They desperately want to have kids, but Ed
(Hunter) Ls baitcn and the criminal record of
H.I. (Cage) prevents them from adopting, so
they do the logical thing — steal a baby. The
first in the black comedy genre that the Cocn
brothers have mastered, "Raising Arizona"
was also their first stab at the modern form of
mangled mythology they perfected in "O
Brother, Where Art Thou?" A mythical, ar
chetypal villain, with a Cocn twist — a motor

cyclist from hell, intent on destroying every
thing in his path — descends on banal subur
ban America to reclaim the baby. As in
"Fargo," the savage is more honor tblc —
and well : spoken — than the charae exs hq
encounters from civilization, an astut: com
mentary on a modern world that the Coehs
suggest may be a step backward. The typicai
Coen morality play-with-a-twist alsooj prates
in "Raising Arizona": in the end, th a right
things happen, and the right people g 4 pun
ished —not for the right reasons, but becausc*
of a scries of mistakes and accidents com
pound to create a just result. No one is pun
ished directly for his or her misdeeds, but one
way or the other, they get what's coming to
them.

Wayne's World (1992)
The seminal pop culture comedy of
the early-'9os, "Wayne's World" was
n robably the best movie to emerge out of
tlie Saturday Night Live Factory. Wayne
( ampbell (Mike Meyers) and Garth
V s lgar (Dana Carvcy) host a public access
show in Aurora, Illinois that gets bought
ojt by a larger network station, run by
Aio-smooth producer Benjamin (Rob
■ owe). The entire film is a series of di
fc essions within digressions and pushes
a isurdist comcdy further than any main
si ream movie had before. Wayne, Garth
a id the camera crew sing the bulk of "Bo
nemian Rhapsody" in their car, less than
10 minutes into the movie. They riff on
corporate America: "Contract or no, I

won't bow to any sponsor,"Wayne says, •
as he takes a bite of a Pizza Hut pizza
Garth parodies Jimi Hendrix's "Foxey
Lady" in a dream sequence, and Meyers
is hilariously self-awaro of the movie's
random moments. When Chris Farley in
explicably reveals a major plot point at
the Alice Cooper concert — a digression
in itself — Wayne says, "You know, fora
security guard, he had an awful lot of in
formation, don't you thmk?" At-the end,
the film turns into a parody of the 'multi
ple ending' convention, which is fitting
fora movie about a TV show. As the film
progresses, Wayne loses his show for
making fun of the sponsor, loses ljis girl
friend Cassandra to Benjamin and even
loses Garth, his best friend. But the
humor never lags.

Bottle Rocket (19%)
Wes Anderson's first film showcases
Luke and Owen Wilson as bored suburban
kids who imagine a life of crime for them
selves. Owen's crew-cutted Dignan is the
first and perhaps best example of Ander
son's overly-ambitious character style,
whose imagined lives far outstrip reality.
Dignan, in an attempt to convince Anthony
(Luke) to join in his big heist, says: "Here are

just a few of the key ingredients: dynamite,
pole vaulting, laughing gas, choppers—can
you see how incredible this is going to be?
Hang gliding, come on!" The visuals are col
orful and detailed, the dialogue is honed and
idiosyncratic and, as in every one of Ander
son's films, the minor characters are hilari
ous. It's probably his most nuanced film, and
the subtle comedy holds up better on re
peated viewings than the videotape will.
