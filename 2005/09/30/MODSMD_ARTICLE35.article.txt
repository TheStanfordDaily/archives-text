### JULIA BROWN INTERMISSION GARAGE SALE MUSIC GURU 
Garage sales offer you a window into someone's life. In no way is this dear
er than in their music selection. Rifling through people's old CD's can give you
a sense of what type of person they arc, what type of taste they have and what
type of taste they had (and would rather not remember). What experience of
fers more joy than digging through the one-dollar bin and finding the perfect
CP? This week, Intermission let me dig into their garage sale CDs before thy
hit the table and this is a sample of what I found.

Kclda. a pop quintet tryini; to gain
an edge by spelling their name with a

lower case letter, follows in the foot
steps of their predecessors in their
latest "Detour." The hand plays lush
strings, horns and piano arrange
ments. While the background music
flows seamlessly, the lyrics and vo
cals leave something lacking. Most of
kelda's heartfelt lyrics are about los
ing love, gaining love, falling in love,
getting hurt because she's in love, etc.
As each song flows from one theme
to the next, sounding surprisingly
like the previous one, the lead singer
— also named kelda — struggles to
hit the notes that arc written. Her
voice doesn't quite have the range
that she wants it to, but she gets
points for trying.

Jim White's latest album, "Drill a
hole in that substrate and tell me what
you see," was a refreshing sound after
listening to the previous albums. Its di
versity will appeal to any music fan.
Maybe it's because he's been in the
business so long, or maybe it's because
he plays what he likes without caring
what anyone else is doing or has been
doing in the music world, but White's
album produces the familiarity of
reading the newspaper evety morning.
Each song is a lyrical poem. The music
behind his words is trip-hop, funk, al
ternative country, folk, rock and what
ever else he feels like and it swells in all
the right places. Whether looking for
something to space out to while surf
ing the net or driving in your car, or
looking for an intense musical experi

ence, White gives you just what you
need on every track. After 20 years of
work, it is about time that he gets some
recognition.

The Gun Shys, who fiave rcccntly
come out with their self-titled EP,
managed to pull off a more tasteful
album. The band is made up of three
men — Alex Kwenski on drums and
piano, Kyle Krone with vocals and

guitar. Cliff Magreta on bass and
drums — whose indie rocker style
managed to attract the comments on
their web site, such as "You rock and
need to come play NYC NOW!!!",
from the medley of young, adoring
women. Their songs, while relatively
simple, rely on a strong drum beat, lo
fi vocals and driving guitar riffs. Their
influences range from Jack Kerouac
to Bob Dylan to The Chocolate
Watchband to The Clash. With a sur
prising blend of Brit punk, modern
day alternative (they pull a lot of in
fluence from the likes of Franz Ferdi
nand) and even a little bit of folk, the
Gun Shys produce a talented EP.
