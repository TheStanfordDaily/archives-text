### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION VIDEO GAME GURU 
Coming back to the Farm for another long year of classes usually puts a lot of issues on the mind of the average student. Everything from what classes to shop to which side of the room the bed should be
on infiltrates our delicate minds and causes a ler>el of stress that in no way compares to the real world but is felt just as lurnhly nonetheless. The cure? Video games. Forgo the intense rush to get through half
of your quarter's reading in a week arul settle down with these recently released gaming gems.

Ninja Gaiden Black
X-Box

The original "Ninja Gaiden" debuted two years ago to much
acclaim on Microsoft's console. The beautiful graphics, seam
less gameplay and tough-as-nails difficulty mean that you either
enjoyed this game immensely, or you hate the fact that you die
every 10 seconds but come back anyway because it's that good.
Tecmo raises the ante once more with "Black,'" a sort of "spe
cial edition" of the original title. One of the most welcome ad
ditions is the inclusion of an "easy mode" for the gamers out
there that weren't quite up to snuff with the original titles diffi
culty. Also, "Black" includes a separate "Mission Mode" that
charges the player with completing over 50 different scenarios,
which include everything from defeating 100 enemies in a sin
gle rush to taking on different bosses from the game with
unique twists in how they attack. Finally, for those who really
need to die quickly by the sword, "Black" also has an even
tougher difficulty mode option than the original. It's a great
title, for old and new ninja fans.

Advance Wars:
Dual Strike
Nintendo DS

Hailed by many as the first true "must-have" title for the Ninten
do DS," Advance Wars' features classic turn-based strategy action
with a unique twist. The title takes advantage of the DS's dual screen
format and allows players to participate in battles on two fronts (si
multaneously wage a war on dedicated land and sea/air environ
ments, with victory in one area strengthening your troops in the
other).
In addition, this sequel in the portable series features an as
tounding story mode that picks up right after the previous title.
When you're finished with the main single player mode, play on over
70 extra skirmish maps against a tough computer opponent or wire
lessly against other gamers (only one cartridge is needed for simple
play). RPG elements such as being able to level up your command
ing officers with new attributes that can change the structure of an
entire battle add a welcome twist to the clean and simple battle sys
tem. Finally, the ability to create your own maps seals the deal that
this is one of the best strategy tides out there for any portable system.

In The Groove
PS2

Before every one starts whining, "not another DDR game,"
hear me out. "Groove" is a refreshing change of pace from Dance
Dance Revolution with a great selection of (admittedly unknown)
music combinedwith a much better challenge than DDR. Because
all the steps on screen are polygonal instead of sprite-based,

"Groove's" dance steps
can be modified in over
20 different ways. Every
thing from having them
spin around, to accelerat
ing to shaking to the beat
of the song attempts to
distract the dancer from
hitting the right notes. A
great marathon mode
seals the deal for this title.
If you're a dance fan of
any type, check this out.
