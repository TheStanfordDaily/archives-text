## Algerians cast vote on national referendum

SIDI RAIS. Algeria (AP) — The pain remains just
beneath the surface of this dusty town on the doorstep
of the Algerian capital, the scene of one of the bloodi
est massacres in an Islamic insurgency that voters on
yesterday were asked to put behind them.
Few here rushed to cast ballots in the national refer
endum on a peace plan that absolves many of the insur
gents and sidesteps questions about the thousands who
disappeared in more than a decade of violence that left
an estimated 150,000 dead across the North African
country.
By noon, four hours after polls opened, the two
dozen security officers in and around the Sidi Rais pri
mary school voting station far outnumbered the trick
le of voters.
"People who have been so hurt hesitate to pardon,"
said Abdelaziz Bensmail. the head of the station. "It is
so easy to say 'sorry' but in reality, here it is difficult to
swallow."
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika crisscrossed Alge
ria for weeks promoting what he said were the merits
of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation.
He pledged it would definitively end the sporadic
violence and put gas- and oil-rich Algeria to work tack
ling soaring unemployment by offering amnesty to all
but the worst perpetrators of the violence.
Voters received two ballots, one white marked "No"
in Arabic and French — a linguistic legacy of France's
former rule of Algeria — the other blue, marked "Yes."
Voters slipped their choice into an envelope that they
dropped into ballot boxes.
As polls closed, the Interior Minister estimated
that about 80 percent voters nationwide had cast
ballots. Preliminary results had been scheduled to
be released late Thursday but officials delayed
that, saying they would be revealed late Friday
morning.
The insurgency started in 1992 when the army can

celed a second round of voting in Algeria's first multi
party legislative elections to thwart a likely victory by
the now-banned fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front.
Daily beheadings and massacres committed by Is
lamic extremists followed. Tens of thousands of civil
ians were killed. There were also strong accusations
that government security forces had an at least passive
role in some of the bloodshed. Victims' families con
tend that security forces were responsible for many of
the thousands of people who disappeared.
The charter gives amnesty to Islamic extremists and
those who gave them logistical support — as long as
they did not perpetrate massacres, rapes or bomb at
tacks in public places. It leaves the painful question of
the thousands who disappeared — allegedly at the
hands of security forces — to the state, which would
pay reparations.

However, there was no commitment to investiga
tions and officials have said that picking out grains of
truth in what was an anarchic situation is all hut im
possible.
Critics were legion. Some claimed that the presi
dent was looking to consolidate his power with his
bold plan. Others criticized the lack of public debate
and accused the president of trying to whitewash years
of agony by moving too fast, too soon.
The charter is the latest phase of an effort to make
peace with extremists, following a 1999 Civil Concord
Pact that provided partial amnesty for those who
turned themselves in.
Bouteflika said recently that the violence caused
$35 billion in damage and left some 150,000 dead —
raising the estimated death toll which had long hovered
around 120,000. Foreign diplomats in Algeria say there
was no way to know a precise figure.
