# Hurricanes cost less than expected

### ANDREW TAYLOR ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The economic fallout
from the twin hurricanes that hit Gulf Coast may be less
severe than first estimated, the Congressional Budget
Office said yesterday.
The agency's director, Douglas Holtz-Eakin,said in a
letter to congressional leaders that hurricanes Katrina
and Rita may have "more modest" economic conse
quences than the CBO had anticipated.
The CBO estimated that their overall impact on the
economy will be about one-half of a percentage point for
the second half of the year, compared with as much as a
percentage point as seen in a Sept. 6 analysis.
"Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have temporarily re
duced the growth of economic output, but the effects
that rebuilding will have on economic activity may
more than offset the drag by early next year," the CBO
said.
When considering private and government support
for recovery and rebuilding, the storms will not affect
growth in the gross domestic product over the final three
months of 2005, Holtz-Eakin said.
In fact, economic growth "could even be somewhat
higher than was projected before the hurricanes," said
Holtz-Eakin, head of the nonpartisan agency that pro
vides economic and budget data to Congress.
Most of the economic losses — as much as 1.5 per
centage points — would come in the July through Sep
tember period.
Before the hurricane struck, the CBO said the econ
omy would grow at an annual rate of between 3 percent
and 4 percent in the second half of the year. Employ
ment was forecast to grow by 150,000 to 200,000 workers
per month.
The CBO estimates that between 280,000 and
400,000 people lost jobs as a result of Katrina; the impact
of Rita is expected to be much smaller.
"By early next year, the pace of reconstruction will
probably cause the net effect of the hurricanes on jobs
nationwide to be minimal," according to the CBO re
port.
The Sept. 6 report had given only a "ballpark esti
mate."
The CBO said the most recent estimates are uncer
tain because of incomplete information about the hurri
cane damage.
