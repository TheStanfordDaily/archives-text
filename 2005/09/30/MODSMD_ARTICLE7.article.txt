## Commencement looks for new home Frost Amphitheatre, Sunken Diamond among possible substitutes 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
For years, Stanford's commence
ment ceremony has been held in the
85,500-seat Stanford Stadium. But
with the stadium planned to be under
renovation this June, the University
is searching lor another venue to
house its 115 th commencement.
According to Jeff Wachtel, senior
assistant to President John Hen
nessy, the ceremony will definitely
be held on campus but, since the
University is expecting at least
25,000 attendees, the undergraduate
and graduate ceremonies will most
likely be split due to lack of a large
alternative venue.
"We are investigating several op
tions." Wachtel said in an interview
with The Daily. "We're going to pull
together a committee that in-

eludes seniors, faculty and grad stu
dents that will look at the options and
talk about where we might do it."
This committee will form and meet
within the next week, added Wachtel.
Committee members will give their
opinions on the commencement op
tions, but Hennessy and University
Provost John Etchemendy will make
the ultimate decision.
In the past, commencement has
taken place at 7,000-capacity Frost
Amphitheatre and at the 4.000-ca
pacity Sunken Diamond.
"The idea of having commence
ment in the Stadium is relatively
new." Wachtel said. "The longest tra
dition is to have it at Frost and that's
one of the options."
Although Wachtel would not re
lease the names of all the sites in con
sideration. he said that some would
require the University to build a
whole new set of stands for the event.
"We estimate to have over 25.000
[attendees] and there's no place on
campus big enough." he said.
