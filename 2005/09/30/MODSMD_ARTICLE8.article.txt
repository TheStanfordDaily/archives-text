## Hurricane response compared to '06 Quake Lecture series marks centennial of Great San Francisco Earthquake 
### ANDREW BURMON STAFF WRITER 
When, at 5:22 PM on April 18. 1906, the
North American and Pacific Plates slipped
along 300 miles of the San Andreas Fault, a se
ries of shockwaves hit San Francisco, shaking
the city violently for 40 seconds. Facades fell
from people's homes, exposing the fronts like
dollhouses. Buildings collapsed, and fires en
sued. The pre-eminent western city — which
had grown exponentially over the previous
four decades — was nearly leveled.
Last night. Kevin Starr, a former state li
brarian and the author of the recently pub
lished "California: A History," kicked off the
"Historical and Social Perspectives of the 1906
Earthquake" lecture series with an address en
titled "The Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906-
Lessons Learned."The lecture series is organ
ized by the Stanford School of Earth Sciences,
in cooperation with UC-Berkeley,The Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center and the Bill
Lane Center for the Study of the American
West, to commemorate the upcoming centen
nial anniversary of the quake.
History Prof. David Kennedy, who spoke on
behalf of the Bill Lane Center, introducing
Starr by praising his scholarship and that "deep
stentorian voice."
During his speech, Starr listed those Amer
ican cities which have been ravaged by natural
The list included Galveston, Balti
more, Chicago, San Francisco, and, most re
cently. New Orleans. Starr was quick to point
out that applicable knowledge can
be gleaned from such disasters.
He described the mayor of San
Francisco's odd reaction to the dis
aster. Meeting with other govern
ment officials, the mayor demand
ed that looters be shot on sight.
Starr pointed out that his aggres
sion may have been fueled by the
iniquities of the racially and eco
nomically split city and the fear
that the populace would turn on it
self.
Starr did not seek to avoid dis
cussing the obvious parallels be
tween the San Francisco earth
quake and the disaster in New Or
leans; rather he described the phe
nomenon that occurred in both
places as a citywide "nervous
breakdown."
He went on to point out that
most of the destruction of San
Francisco was due to human error,
particularly the decision to dyna
mite buildings to create a fire
break. Starr also stressed the idea
that "we can be even more danger
ous to ourselves than all the
megaforces seething beneath the
geological sea."
The lecture, which was manda
tory for many geological and envi
ronmental Sciences and civil and
environmental engineering stu
dents, was well attended.
"It may not have been earth
shaking," said sophomore Sam
Urmy, an environmental science
major. "But it was interesting and
definitely worth attending."
Starr's speech will be followed by
four other lectures on "Science,
Earthquake Engineering, Pre
paredness and Disaster Response."
Malcolm Barker will deliver the
next presentation in the series,
"Through the Eyes of the Sur
vivors," on Oct. 25 in Kresge Audi
torium.
