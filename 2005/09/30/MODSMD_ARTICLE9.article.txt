# Stanford ranked fifth for community service
## 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this month. Washington
Monthly magazine released its own
version of the U.S. News and World
Report rankings published each
year. Unlike its peer, however, the
D.C.-based magazine's list was based
not on academics but rather on com
munity service.
Stanford came in at No. 5 on the
list, the same spot it holds on the re
cently released 2(XXi U.S. News rank
ing. It joins the usual suspects —
Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, which topped the list.and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania (ninth) as
one of the only three schools in the
top 10 of both the Washington
Monthly and U.S. News rankings.
In its introduction. Washington
Vlonthly wrote that the nation's col
egcs and universities "are the path
to the American dream, the surest

route for hard-working poor kids to
achieve a better life in a changing
economy. And they shape, in pro
found and subtle ways, students'
ideas about American society and
their place in it."
The magazine then explained the
three criteria it used to judge the
schools on the list, stating that "Uni
versities should be engines of social
mobility, they should produce the ac
ademic minds and scientific research
that advance knowledge and drive
economic growth, and they should
inculcate and encourage an ethic of
service."
There were only two Ivy League
schools in the top 10 — University of
Pennsylvania and Cornell (which
was fourth,one spot above Stanford)
— while Yale was number 15 fol
lowed closely by Harvard at 16,
Princeton, however, which tied with
Harvard for first place in this year's
U.S. News rankings, came in at num
ber 44 on Washington Monthly's list,
due in part to the fact that its re
search facilities pale in comparison
to many of its academic peers.
Many Stanford students were not
surprised by the school's position in
the rankings, saying that they have
always known that Stanford does
more for the surrounding communi
ty than many of its East Coast equiv
alents. Moreover, the students rec
ognized the important role that
service plays on and around campus
but insisted that there can always be
more.
Junior Andrew Gay, community
service chairman at Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, said that community service

is a centerpiece of a Stanford stu
dent's education that should not be
sacrificed for any reason.
"To be honest, it's hard to imag
ine any school could do more for the
community than Stanford," he said.
"Service is an essential part of any
Stanford student's education be
cause it offers a unique perspective
unavailable in any classroom. In a
way, community service is like the oil
that keeps Stanford's motor going."
Sophomore Joanna Yang, co-phi
lanthropy chair at Pi Beta Phi. of
fered a different point of view, as
serting that Stanford ranked higher
on Washington Monthly's list in part
due to a distinction between stu
dents at Stanford and those at Ivy
League schools.
"Students here are more idealis
tic than students at other schools of
the same academic caliber, and it is
this idealism that motivates us to get
involved." she said. "Also, because
it's easier to participate in communi

ty service at Stanford than at any of
the Ivies, it seems logical that more
students here take part in some form
of service or another."
Other students expressed delight
about the rankings, but still ques
tioned their legitimacy and worried
about the impact they might have.
Sophomore Andrew Buchan
warned that being highly ranked
could lead to a lethargic attitude
about service.
"It's great that Stanford is so
highly ranked with regards to serv
ice, but we have to make sure we
don't let these rankings go to our
head and encourage a sense of com
placency in the community service
field," he said. "In fact, they should
do just the opposite; they should mo
tivate us to get even more involved
in the community to try to climb fur
ther up the rankings, just as being
ranked behind Harvard, Yale and
Princeton in the U.S. News rankings
motivates us to climb up that list."
