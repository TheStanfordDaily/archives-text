Our competition couldn't beat us.
Now they're joining us.
We felt it's only fair to
warn you-
At Oracle, we're committed to being the dominant player in the
enterprise software business. Our recent decision to purchase
Siebel is just one way we're doing that. Hiring the cream of the
crop at the nation's top schools is another way.
We have opportunities in these areas:
• Software Development
• Product Management
• Technical Writing
rally, v. 1. gather and organize
or inspire anew. 2. corae
to the assistance of a person,
party or cause. 3. come
together for common action
or effort.
If you are as particular about where you work as we are about
who works here, we should talk. Rush resumes to:
