LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Firefighters gained ground
Sunday against three wildfires burning across Southern
California but worried about a forecast for hot winds.
A1,045-acre fire in Burbank was 67 percent contained
after firefighters were aided by cooler, overnight breezes,
said Capt. Ron Bell of the Burbank Fire Department.
Residents returned to about 70 evacuated homes in
Sunset Canyon. But firefighters were concerned about
a forecast for warmer winds that could bring 50 mph
gusts and re-ignite what appeared to be a "cold moun
tain," Bell said.
"A little wind could blow those embers into the green
and then we'd be starting from scratch," Bell said. "Tilings
look excellent today, and we will be very aggressive. But
the wind event is our biggest 'what if right now."
Crews were kept at the scene a little longer and po
sitioned near homes that could be threatened if the
winds kicked up.
Elsewhere, more than 1,000 emergency personnel
battled a blaze in steep, rugged terrain in and around
San Bernardino National Forest, about 70 miles east of
Los Angeles.
The 935-acre fire was 72 percent contained Sunday
but had the potential to flare up in windy conditions be
cause of dead trees and grass in the area, according to the
U.S. Forest Service.
About 1,200 people were evacuated from several
small communities on Friday. Some residents were al
lowed to return late Saturday, but mandatory evacua
tions remained Sunday for Seven Oaks, Barton Flats and
Angelus Oaks.
A wildfire that torched more than 24,000 acres on the
border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties was 85 per
cent contained and cooler weather helped firefighters as
they tried to extinguish hot spots, said Mike Horst, a Ven
tura County fire dispatcher. All evacuation orders and
road closures were lifted on the Topanga Fire, which
raged much of last week.
"Things are looking very good," said Los Angeles
County fire Capt. Mark Savage. "Firefighters are certain
ly aware of the expected wind event that should occur in
the next couple of days, and we are making the effort to
make sure we don't have any hot spots when it arrives."
