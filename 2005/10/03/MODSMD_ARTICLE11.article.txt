## When cute perfect strangers become just strangers — tales of a short-lived infatuation 
### 
If there's one thing you should know
about me, it's that I have an intense infat
uation with office supplies. Pens, scissors,
label makers — there's something about
having all those fancy tools sitting on my
desk that just screams "Possibility!" (or per
haps more accurately,"Mental illness!") So
it was not at all surprising that I found my
self at a wholesale discount store before
work on Wednesday, gleefully clutching my
hanging file folders with the kind of mania
cal enthusiasm typically reserved for cheer
leaders and coke addicts.
What was surprising, however, was that
the guy standing in front of me in the Quick-
Check line was not the sort of individual
who normally frequents these stores — i.e.,
a 40-something, harried mother with seven
children in tow or a confused vagrant who
thinks he's in line for Space Mountain at
Disneyland. This guy was a tall twenty
something, and was wearing a clean shirt
free of sexist/racist/political slogans. I was
intrigued.
But the best part was that the 10-items
or-less in his cart consisted mainly of non
stick pans and — get this — a pasta maker.
Now I can't think of anything sexier than a
guy who likes to cook, except maybe a guy
who likes to cook Italian food and will do so
for his significant other on command at any
time of the day or night despite illness, finan
cial constraints, etc.
1 try to practice what I preach, so al
though my reserved nature typically pre
vents me from hitting on guys at the check
out line, I thought, why not? Who will judge
me if he rejects my advances? Mr. Space
Mountain? He's probably lonely too and
will give me a compassionate nod of under
standing with that head covered in tin foil.
I immediately began to strategize. The
trick to hitting on a complete stranger is to
first find a reason to strike up a conversa
tion. In this situation, my options were limit
ed. Cute Guy was standing with his back to
me, so it would have been extremely awk
ward to tap him on the shoulder and say
something like, "My, those are some nice
pans you have! I also like pans!"
A more appropriate alternative, I decid
ed, was physical assault. If I bumped into
him or, better yet, knocked him upside the
head with my box of hanging file folders, I
could say something along the lines of "Oh
my god, I am so sorry! I tripped on my flip
flop and now you have a concussion!" (I'm
actually just kidding. Assaulting strangers is
not funny).
At this point in the game you have to pay
very close attention to your stranger's reac
tion. If he's interested, he will respond in a
friendly manner and attempt to continue
conversing with you. If he's not, he will offer
a one-word response to your statement and
possibly call the police.
If things seem to be going really well
(several minutes of conversation beyond
simple pleasantries, for example), you
should introduce yourself and consider say
ing something about getting together at an
other point in time. Only you can decide
when it is appropriate to take the conversa
tion to the next level, but a good rule of
thumb is to ask yourself, "Is this person re
ally interested in what I have to say? Based
on this initial interaction, do we have
enough to talk about at a later meeting?"
Another good rule of thumb is to avoid dat
ing identical twin brothers with a penchant
for tomfoolery, but we'll talk about this at
another time.
I regret to inform you that Cute Guy and
I were not meant to be. As I was preparing
to launch myself bodily into his personal
space, he shouted to the person in front of
him, "Come on, is that really 10 items? I
don't think so!"
Now I may be neurotic and occasionally
violent, but I am never rude to people in
line, and I think it's lame when others are.
And so, what could have been a passionate
love affair involving pasta and office sup
plies faded away before it ever really began.
But Mr. Space Mountain, pondering the
pleasures of possibility, gave me a wink, and
I need to believe that one day I might find
that kind of bliss.
