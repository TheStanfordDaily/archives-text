## Is Stanford quake-friendly? 
### CLAY BAVINGER 
This coming April will mark the
100 th anniversary of the 1906 Earth
quake, which leveled nearly half of
San Francisco's buildings and killed
about 5,000 people in the surround
ing areas. The quake also destroyed
much of Stanford's campus —
Memorial Church and the west side
of the Quad sustained the greatest
damages — and two people, includ
ing a student who was trapped in his
Encina Hall dorm room, were killed.
"Stanford University is hit very
hard," said Stanford President David
Starr Jordan in 1906, citing
$2,800,000 in damages, "...our great
ambitions for Stanford as a universi
ty must rest awhile — until we can
save the money for building again
and until our own alumni are old
enough and rich enough to come to
our rescue."
In commemoration of the disas
ter, Stanford's School of Earth Sci
ences, The Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the American West, The
Blume Earthquake Engineering

Center and UC-Berkeley or
ganized the Quake '06 Cen
tennial Alliance lecture se
ries to discuss the effects of
the disaster and comment on
the Bay Area's preparation
for future quakes.
In addition to the lecture se-

ries, senior Laura Surma
worked with the Office of
Campus Planning and Design
to coordinate walking tours
through 12 sites especially af
fected by the earthquake. The
tour will also reveal how the
Stanford campus changed
after both the 1906 earthquake
and the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake. For example, the
tour stops at the old Chemistry
building, which was closed after
the 1989 quake.
The first lecture was deliv-

ered last Thursday by Kevin
Starr, a history professor at the
University of Southern Califor
nia. The series continues
throughout the year and will fea
ture Malcolm E. Barker, a former
reporter and author of several
books about San Francisco, and
Stephen Tobriner, a professor of
architecture at UC-Berkeley.
Starr's lecture focused on
San Francisco's lack of prepara
tion for the 1906 Earthquake, due

to problems with both infrastructure
and city leadership. For example, the
fire chief, who Starr claims was capa
ble and experienced, had petitioned
several times throughout 1904 and

1905 to have the city's water pipes up
dated.The city council and mayor Eu
gene Schmitz, however, rejected him
each time. On the day of the quake,
the water system failed and fire fight
ers were unable to extinguish flames,
which spread throughout the city.
Starr further stressed that the ex
tent to which people prepare for dis
asters and the ways in which they
react to them largely determine how
well they survive them. San Francisco
was not only poorly prepared, and in
a sense "burned down by ineptitude,"
Starr argues.
The purpose of the Quake '06 Cen
tennial Alliance is to help avoid a re
peat of what happened to the Bay
Area during and after the 1906 shaker
by informing those on campus about
the imminent danger of earthquakes.
Studies show that there is a 62 per
cent chance that one or more earth
quakes of a 6.7 magnitude on the
Richter scale will strike the Bay Area
sometime before 2032, according to
the Quake '06 Centennial Alliance.
In other words, either while current
students reside on the Farm, or when
the next generation of students ar
rives, a powerful quake will likely
rock campus.
When this occurs, what how dam
aged will Stanford be? Will the quake
claim any lives or destroy any build
ings? These are the types of questions
being posed and addressed by the
lecture series.
Hurricane Katrina, which devas
tated New Orleans and the Gulf
Coast, has led many to consider the
same question, Starr says. Students
were brought face-to-face, perhaps
for the first time, with the awesome
power of nature.
Stanford is, in regard to the threat
of natural disasters, very similar to
New Orleans. Both are situated in an
area where a disaster is expected
every few decades and the expecta
tions are just about always fulfilled.
Both areas know of the danger and
claim to have plans to prevent large
scale devastation. But New Orleans'
plan fell somewhere between inef
fectual and nonexistent. Is Stanford's
any better?
To its credit, Stanford has certainly
taken every precaution in regard to
architectural safety, Starr claims. After
the Earthquake of 1989, which caused
serious damage to the Geology Cor
ner, the Engineering Corner, Memor
ial Church, the Terman Engineering
building, Encina Hall and various res
idences, Stanford spent millions retro
fitting and strengthening buildings on
campus. These initiatives may protect
Stanford's campus from what hap
pened to it in 1906 and 1989.

$2,800,000 in damages, "...our great
ambitions for Stanford as a universi
ty must rest awhile — until we can
save the money for building again
and until our own alumni are old
enough and rich enough to come to
our rescue."
In commemoration of the disas
ter, Stanford's School of Earth Sci
ences, The Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the American West, The
Blume Earthquake Engineering

Center and UC-Berkeley or
ganized the Quake '06 Cen
tennial Alliance lecture se
ries to discuss the effects of
the disaster and comment on
the Bay Area's preparation
for future quakes.
In addition to the lecture se-

ries, senior Laura Surma
worked with the Office of
Campus Planning and Design
to coordinate walking tours
through 12 sites especially af
fected by the earthquake. The
tour will also reveal how the
Stanford campus changed
after both the 1906 earthquake
and the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake. For example, the
tour stops at the old Chemistry
building, which was closed after
the 1989 quake.
The first lecture was deliv-

ered last Thursday by Kevin
Starr, a history professor at the
University of Southern Califor
nia. The series continues
throughout the year and will fea
ture Malcolm E. Barker, a former
reporter and author of several
books about San Francisco, and
Stephen Tobriner, a professor of
architecture at UC-Berkeley.
Starr's lecture focused on
San Francisco's lack of prepara
tion for the 1906 Earthquake, due

to problems with both infrastructure
and city leadership. For example, the
fire chief, who Starr claims was capa
ble and experienced, had petitioned
several times throughout 1904 and

1905 to have the city's water pipes up
dated.The city council and mayor Eu
gene Schmitz, however, rejected him
each time. On the day of the quake,
the water system failed and fire fight
ers were unable to extinguish flames,
which spread throughout the city.
Starr further stressed that the ex
tent to which people prepare for dis
asters and the ways in which they
react to them largely determine how
well they survive them. San Francisco
was not only poorly prepared, and in
a sense "burned down by ineptitude,"
Starr argues.
The purpose of the Quake '06 Cen
tennial Alliance is to help avoid a re
peat of what happened to the Bay
Area during and after the 1906 shaker
by informing those on campus about
the imminent danger of earthquakes.
Studies show that there is a 62 per
cent chance that one or more earth
quakes of a 6.7 magnitude on the
Richter scale will strike the Bay Area
sometime before 2032, according to
the Quake '06 Centennial Alliance.
In other words, either while current
students reside on the Farm, or when
the next generation of students ar
rives, a powerful quake will likely
rock campus.
When this occurs, what how dam
aged will Stanford be? Will the quake
claim any lives or destroy any build
ings? These are the types of questions
being posed and addressed by the
lecture series.
Hurricane Katrina, which devas
tated New Orleans and the Gulf
Coast, has led many to consider the
same question, Starr says. Students
were brought face-to-face, perhaps
for the first time, with the awesome
power of nature.
Stanford is, in regard to the threat
of natural disasters, very similar to
New Orleans. Both are situated in an
area where a disaster is expected
every few decades and the expecta
tions are just about always fulfilled.
Both areas know of the danger and
claim to have plans to prevent large
scale devastation. But New Orleans'
plan fell somewhere between inef
fectual and nonexistent. Is Stanford's
any better?
To its credit, Stanford has certainly
taken every precaution in regard to
architectural safety, Starr claims. After
the Earthquake of 1989, which caused
serious damage to the Geology Cor
ner, the Engineering Corner, Memor
ial Church, the Terman Engineering
building, Encina Hall and various res
idences, Stanford spent millions retro
fitting and strengthening buildings on
campus. These initiatives may protect
Stanford's campus from what hap
pened to it in 1906 and 1989.

The 1906 Earthquake caused $2,800,000 in damages to the Main Quad, Memorial Church and
other parts of Stanford's campus, according to former University President David Starr Jordan in the
days following the shaker — as printed in a Daily article that appeared after the disaster.
This coming April will mark the
100 th anniversary of the 1906 Earth
quake, which leveled nearly half of
San Francisco's buildings and killed
about 5,000 people in the surround
ing areas. The quake also destroyed
much of Stanford's campus —
Memorial Church and the west side
of the Quad sustained the greatest
damages — and two people, includ
ing a student who was trapped in his
Encina Hall dorm room, were killed.
"Stanford University is hit very
hard," said Stanford President David
Starr Jordan in 1906, citing
