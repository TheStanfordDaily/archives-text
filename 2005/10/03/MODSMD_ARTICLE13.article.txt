# Domestic violence prevention at core of new sorority
## Sigma Psi Zeta networks with West Coast sisters

Sigma Psi Zeta, Stanford's newest soror
ity, is an Asian-interest Greek organization
that works to combat violence against
women.
"By involving this ethic within our sorori
ty, we immediately become involved in a de
mographic that we seek to advocate for —
one of the Asian female," says the national
Sigma Psi Zeta Web site, adding that Asian
females are often portrayed by the media as
weak, emotionally isolated and voiceless.
Examples of their involvement in the
community include Residential Education
programs such as "Dating 101," a popular
sexual assault awareness program that fea
tures speakers from Vaden Health Center
and the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, and "Take Back the Night," a silent,
nighttime rally designed to empower and in
spire individuals to speak out violence to
wards women, says senior Stephanie
Nguyen, president of the Stanford's Sigma
Psi Zeta chapter.
This past weekend. Stanford's Omicron

Charter — launched in 2004 — held its first
West Coast Sisterhood Rally here on cam
pus.
"The primary purpose of the rally was uni
fication," says third-year communication
graduate student Alice Siu, national presi
dent of the sorority.
Because the sorority was originally found
ed at the State University of New York at Al
bany, the majority of the 18 sisterhoods are
located on the east coast. All four of the west
coast sisterships were established within the
past two years, and last weekend's rally
marks the first national conference held in
the west.
Chapters from the University of Washing
ton, the University of Colorado and the Uni
versity of Nebraska came to brainstorm
goals and ideas about the future of the or
ganization.
"Nationally, SYZ is a young sorority —
only 11 years old — but this conference sig
nifies how rapidly we're expanding and
growing across the nation," Nguyen says.
The conference started in the morning
with workshops and a meeting at Roble Hall

to discuss expansion and the progress of
each chapter.
"We wanted to learn from each other's
strengths and weaknesses to each build a
better sisterhood," Siu says.
During the afternoon, the groups head
ed to San Francisco to explore the city.
Many visiting sisters had not previously
been to the Bay Area and had a chance to
look around during a scavenger hunt. Sis
ters toured Union Square and surrounding
areas and shopped at the San Francisco
Shopping Center.
"The rally ended with a ceremony to in
troduce our newest Delta class to the com
munity," Nguyen explains.
The nine novices, all dressed in maroon
tank tops and jeans, seemed a little nervous
before taking the stage, but the tension lift
ed as sincere compliments, jokes and anec
dotes about each one were shared, accord
ing to Nguyen.
Representatives from the West Coast sis
terships then took the stage and congratu
lated the newest Delta class. Other Stanford
sororities and fraternities were present to

offer the sisters their congratulations as
well. Alpha Kappa Delta Phi even presented
the Delta class with cell phone charms as a
reminder that "if you need anything, we're
only a phone call away."
The rally appeared to have a positive im
pact on the newest members of the sorority.
"Meeting girls from all over the country
made me feel empowered since we were all
working towards the same cause — preven
tion of domestic violence," says sophomore
and Sigma Psi Zeta member Jillian Wong. "I
have never attended a national conference
before, so I felt it was a great opportunity for
me to understand the dynamics of the soror
ity from the perspectives of other chapters
and charters."
Despite being a new sorority, Sigma Psi
Zeta's involvement on campus has not been
overlooked by the Stanford community.
"The Stanford chapter was honored to be
recognized by the University this past spring
when we received the Dean of Students
Outstanding Achievement Award for our
work in educating the Stanford community
about sexual assault." Siu says.
