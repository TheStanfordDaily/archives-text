## Zoom In Cool is local 
### LAURE NEGIAR 
Traveling, in my opinion, is the single
best way to become more aware of
your usual surroundings. By leaving
behind things you consider second nature,
you realize that they're not second nature for
everyone. Ways of behaving that you thought
were obvious become much less obvious.
Take, for example, the ways people dress and
what is considered fashionable.
This summer. I went back home to France
before traveling to Costa Rica, and return
ing to Stanford, so I had ample opportunity
to observe what's cool in different places
and get a good laugh out of it — because
when you think about it, nothing is inherent
ly "cool." People have to agree (at least im
plicitly, if not consciously) on what's cool at a
particular time and in a particular place, and
it turns out that they have very different
opinions on the matter.
My grandparents live in one of the
wealthiest neighborhoods in Paris, the 16th
arrondissement (district), which is also con
sidered one of the snobbiest Parisian neigh
borhoods. They invited me to their apart
ment for lunch, and as 1 walked to their place
from the metro station. I realized that half
the women aged fourteen to forty were
wearing cowboy boots with their chic jeans.
How odd, I thought, and certainly quite ugly.
Then I remembered that the last edition
of Madame Figaro (a weekly magazine for
middle-aged women) had claimed that the
"in" thing this fall was cowboy boots, illus
trating their point with pictures of children
going to school dressed as if ready to herd
cattle — or rather, to pretend to herd cattle,
because I don't think those expensive-look
ing red and white-checkered blouses were
meant to get stained with sweat and ma
nure.
Well, there you go. If Madame Figaro says
it, and 16th arrondissement girls wear it.it
must be cool. Except that it only works if
they stay in the 16th. where people implicit
ly agree it's cool. Elsewhere in Paris and
France, these women's outfits would be ludi
crous. Although we are supposedly a global
society, the concept of "cool" is still very lo
cally defined.

Another example to illustrate my point.
When I was in Costa Rica. 1 visited Manuel
Antonio national park, signed up fora tour
and got put in a group with several other
tourists, including some Americans. One
family from Los Angeles especially caught
my attention: mother, father, and two girls,
ages 14 and 16.
The first thing I noticed was that the two
sisters were wearing sweatpants with enor
mous "Hollister" logos on their rear ends. I
had no notion of the "coolness" of this
brand, but from the way they were behaving,
I gathered it was pretty hot stuff in their
area. The rest of their outfits were exactly in
line with their pants: supposed to look ath
letic, but in fact not at all suited for any kind
of serious workout. But that's not the point.
The point is that what is apparently very
trendy where they came from was strange
and out of context elsewhere, especially in
the equatorial forests of Costa Rica.
I don't think I can come up with any other
country besides the U.S. where sweatpants
could be considered cool. Or where big print
on your rear end is not considered complete
ly ridiculous.
Last example: the mythical Louis Vuit
ton. Surprisingly, it's not very popular among
the French, but it's considered the ultimate
chic in other countries, especially Japan. Just
take a look at the enormous line of Japanese
tourists spilling out of the Louis Vuitton
boutique onto the Champs-Elysees. In fact, a
couple years ago, Louis Vuitton had to im
pose a quota of three bags per Japanese
tourist because some were buying huge
stocks of bags and selling them in Japan.
Strange how these things work. But
they're certainly amusing. And comforting,
in a way, because on days when you feel com
pletely unstylish, you can tell yourself that
your mismatched and clashing outfit may be
the ultimate cool in some other place. You
can also tell yourself, when Miss or Mister
Perfect Outfit walks into the room, that in
much of the world their clothes would not be
thought stylish. In Costa Rica, for example.

If you think cowboy boots with designer jeans are
cool and would like to tell Laure about her lack of
fashion sense, e-mail lnegiar@stanford.edu.
