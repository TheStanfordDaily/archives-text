## Why are we tolerating discrimination? 
### MICHAEL ANGELO SPENCER JONES 
In the past several years, Stanford Law
School has not had military recruiters on its
campus. However, today, recruiters from the
Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps will
be on the Law School's campus conducting
interviews. Stanford OUTLAW condemns
both the military's discriminatory policy and
Stanford University's tacit compliance with
the policy.
Stanford OUTLAW objects to the mili
tary's presence on the Law School's campus
given that the military blatantly discrimi
nates against gays, lesbians and bisexuals
under the "Don't Ask. Don't Tell" principle
The military's discriminatory policy violates
Stanford Law School's nondiscrimination
policy which prohibits employers that dis
criminate on various bases, including race,
sex, national origin, and sexual orientation,
from recruiting on the Law School's campus.
However, because of the Solomon Amend
ment, Stanford Law School must either

allow the military to recruit on its campus, or
risk the loss of hundreds of millions of dol
lars of federal funds that the government
provides to every part of the University.
The Solomon Amendment is an uncon
stitutional violation of the Law School's
First Amendment rights. It violates the doc
trine of unconstitutional conditions, the
doctrine of compelled speech, and the
school's right of expressive association. It
forces the Law School to relinquish its
nondiscrimination policy and affirmatively
assist the military in its discriminatory re
cruitment efforts. In a letter to the Law
School community. Dean Larry Kramer
voiced the school's opposition to the mili
tary coming onto our campus stating,
"Given a free choice, we would exclude any
employer-including the military-who dis
criminated in violation of our policy." The
Solomon Amendment does not afford the
school a free choice, but rather tells the
school, "We are coming onto your campus.
