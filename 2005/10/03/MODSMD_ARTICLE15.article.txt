## Why are we tolerating discrimination? 
### MICHAEL ANGELO SPENCER JONES 
In the past several years, Stanford Law
School has not had military recruiters on its
campus. However, today, recruiters from the
Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps will
be on the Law School's campus conducting
interviews. Stanford OUTLAW condemns
both the military's discriminatory policy and
Stanford University's tacit compliance with
the policy.
Stanford OUTLAW objects to the mili
tary's presence on the Law School's campus
given that the military blatantly discrimi
nates against gays, lesbians and bisexuals
under the "Don't Ask. Don't Tell" principle
The military's discriminatory policy violates
Stanford Law School's nondiscrimination
policy which prohibits employers that dis
criminate on various bases, including race,
sex, national origin, and sexual orientation,
from recruiting on the Law School's campus.
However, because of the Solomon Amend
ment, Stanford Law School must either

allow the military to recruit on its campus, or
risk the loss of hundreds of millions of dol
lars of federal funds that the government
provides to every part of the University.
The Solomon Amendment is an uncon
stitutional violation of the Law School's
First Amendment rights. It violates the doc
trine of unconstitutional conditions, the
doctrine of compelled speech, and the
school's right of expressive association. It
forces the Law School to relinquish its
nondiscrimination policy and affirmatively
assist the military in its discriminatory re
cruitment efforts. In a letter to the Law
School community. Dean Larry Kramer
voiced the school's opposition to the mili
tary coming onto our campus stating,
"Given a free choice, we would exclude any
employer-including the military-who dis
criminated in violation of our policy." The
Solomon Amendment does not afford the
school a free choice, but rather tells the
school, "We are coming onto your campus.
We will discriminate against your
students. And you must help us do it
or suffer severe consequences."
While we recognize the financial
stakes of non-compliance, we can
not stand idle while the military
runs roughshod over the Law
School's nondiscrimination policy
and strikes a blow to the equality ef
forts of the LGBT community. And
it is at this point we turn to the Uni
versity and the President's Office.
We wonder why the University has
not taken a stronger stand against
the military. Why didn't the Univer
sity sign on to a "friend of the court"
brief filed by Harvard, Yale, Colum
bia, Cornell, Penn, Chicago, and
NYU in support of FAIR in the case
challenging the Solomon Amend
ment? We wonder why the Univer
sity has not flexed its strength in
support of its LGBT students. Why
does the University maintain a

nondiscrimination policy that pro
hibits recruiters from "unlawfully"
discriminating on the basis of sexu
al orientation, amounting to noth
ing more than a voluntary waiver
for the military to discriminate
against its LGBT students?
The issue of military recruiting
on our campus is part of a much
larger campaign for civil rights, both
at our school and in society. We are
fighting the battle that our minority
peers fought before us in their push
for equality, and we cannot allow
any weakening of our movement. If
the movement falters in our educa
tional institutions, what does that
mean for the movement in society?
We wonder, notwithstanding the
current state of the law, if the mili
tary still maintained a discriminato
ry policy against blacks and exclud
ed them from serving, would Stan
ford still allow the military to re
cruit on its campus? We would hope
not. And if not, then that begs the
question: Why is the prohibition
against sexual orientation discrimi
nation expendable within Stan
ford's nondiscrimination policy?

We ask these questions because
we demand answers. We implore
President Hennessy to issue a state
ment in support of FAIR in its chal
lenge to the Solomon Amendment,
and to tell the community why the
University has not taken a stronger
stand thus far. We urge the President
to initiate discussions with LGBT
student leaders to discuss the Uni
versity's failure to adequately sup
port its LGBT students. We demand
the University change its weak
nondiscrimination policy to align
squarely with the Law School's poli
cy by dropping the "unlawfully"
wording. And we urge the Universi
ty to take other ameliorative meas
ures to lessen the harmful effects
from the military's presence and the
University's silence. To do otherwise
is shameful.
