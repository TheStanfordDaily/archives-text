Free Music Downloads 111-conceived,
Apple Users Get Screwed
In response to Mandy Kovach's article,
"Agreement Nears with Yahoo Music" (Sept.
30), I feel the need to raise some serious is
sues.
Unless the article was discussing features
of an upcoming version of Yahoo's Music
Unlimited service, the current incantation is
incompatible with the Apple operating sys
tem, not just the iPod as the article claims. So,
to all of you running a Macintosh system, this
just isn't for you.
For those iPod owners who happen to he
running Windows XP. You can download
music, you just can't take it with you. The ar
ticle correctly mentions the übiquity of the
iPod device, and while I am skeptical of
Apple's statement that the iPod controls 76
percent of the worldwide market share of
digital personal audio, I would bet it has a
fairly strong hold in the campus community.
What is the point of having music available
for download if most students can't even
transfer songs to their iPods?
Also not addressed is the concept of
"burning" downloaded tracks to CDs. The
Yahoo service requires an additional charge
of $0.79 per track to burn songs to a CD. Is
this something Stanford students will also be
allowed to do for free? Will there be a dis
counted burning price? Will burned CDs
work in normal CD players?

Finally, why haven't students been more
closely brought into the loop in this deci
sion-making process? Important things I
would like to know about the students on
campus who this project is supposedly
"helping": How many students use Apple
computers? How many students use an
iPod? How important is it for students to be
able to take their music with them? Of the
students that currently use paid subscription
music services, how many use Apple's
iTunes versus Yahoo versus Napster, etc.? I
would like to think the University would
take into account student preferences and
tendencies before committing to a service
that may be unusable to a large percentage
of the student community.
Why wasn't a simple, obvious survey dis
tributed to students to get a better idea of the
current landscape of digital music consump
tion on campus? If a high proportion of stu
dents already have iPods, what is the point in
going with a service that is not compatible
with the iPod? I understand the University's
enthusiasm for developing a legal download
ing alternative that will reduce the number of
illegal downloads on campus, but how much
will the presence of a free alternative really
affect illicit downloading? What will the Uni
versity do when students start using tools to
convert songs files that are easily transferred
to iPods or other operating systems such as
Apple or Linux?
Too many unanswered questions remain

regarding the future of digital music for Stan
ford to he locking its students into a system
many of them may not want. Then again, it's
hard to figure out what students may or may
not want when they aren't asked directly, and
the student newspaper fails to take a hard,
objective look as to what exactly the imple
mentation of this free music service may
mean for the students who may, or may not,
be able to use it.

An apology
Rachelle Marshall raised the important
question of how someone, even a Jew. can
criticize Israel without being accused of
anti-Semitism. The question becomes diffi
cult because media images and textbooks
exist throughout the Arab world that cannot
be distinguished from classical European
anti-Semitism; hence the confusion. The
Mamas Charter even advocates killing Jews
on sight. By bringing up anti-Semitism 1 at
tempted to contextualize the debate, not sti
fle it. Nonetheless, criticizing Israel is not by
itself anti-Semitic. I apologize to Ms. Mar
shall.

Kepler's mattered
In "Where Have All the Indies Gone?
(Sept. 29)", David Blackman reflects mean
ingfully on the emptiness that may lie behind
the "Save the Mom and Pop Stores" move
ment. not to mention our struggle with the in
creasing homogenization and corporate in
fluence in our lives.
In many ways I am like Blackman: I'm
also a Stanfordized New York Jewish liberal
— I even have the t-shirt he mentions. I am
different in one major way: I was a huge Ke
pler's fan during my time on the Farm.
My response to his column, briefly, is that
the difference between Kepler's and, say.
Borders, is far from trivial and that pessimism
and ambivalence about what Kepler's end
signifies are equally unwarranted.
Just as surely as economies of scale have
worked in the favor of the major chains for the
past century, the elevation of taste and extra
economic concerns among larger and larger
sections of the American middle class are start
ing to work in favor of the independents.
Indie labels, new-fangled Mom and Pop
stores, boutique brands — these, paradoxi
cally, are the wave of the future and the aspi
ration of an increasing number of people.
What Blackman takes fora questionable
marker of race and class. I take for the
choice that people with resources and
