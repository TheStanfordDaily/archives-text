## Court nominee should believe in privacy 
### PACO TORRES 
By maintaining silence on his views of the
hot-button issues of the day, John Roberts
ensured his confirmation last Thursday as
Chief Justice of the United States. During his
testimony before the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee, he refused to answer questions on
topics that could come before the Court, in
cluding abortion, affirmative action and as
sisted suicide. Hie committee was, however,
able to extract Roberts's view on an equally
important and pressing matter: the right to
privacy.
Roberts admitted that he agreed with the
Court's landmark decision in Griswold v.
Connecticut, which first recognized a consti
tutional right to privacy. Saying that the right

is "protected under the Constitution in vari
ous ways," he specifically stated that "person
al privacy is a component of liberty protected
under the due process clause" of the Fifth
Amendment.
With the top spot on the bench now filled.
President Bush will focus 011 finding a re
placement for outgoing Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor. This nominee should be held to
the same standard as Chief Justice Roberts,
and he or she should candidly state his or her
view on the right to privacy.
While receiving considerably less atten
tion than the oft-mentioned right to an abor
tion, a potential decision on the status of the
right to privacy could be far more profound
in its effects on the lives of Americans.
Tlie Court's enunciation of the rieht to an

abortion in Roe v. Wade is predicated on the
right to privacy. In his majority opinion. Jus
tice Harry Blackmun wrote that the right to
privacy was "broad enough to encompass a
woman's decision whether or not to termi
nate her pregnancy."
Beyond the realm of reproductive rights,
the right to privacy is essential in a world
where advancing technology allows govern
ments increasing capabilities to monitor the
activities of their citizens. An alarmingly Or
wellian system of omnipresent security cam
eras and invasive wire-tapping could emerge
should the Court rule that privacy the Con
stitution does not guarantee privacy.
Some strict constructionists, such as Jus-
tices Clarence Thomas and Antonin
Scalia, argue that the right to privacy
does not exist, as it is not explicitly
guaranteed by the Constitution. In
his dissent of the Court's decision in
Lawrence v. Texas, Justice Thomas
declared that he could find "no gen
eral right to privacy" in the Constitu
tion. Justice Scalia, dissenting in the
same case, went so far as to criticize
the Court for its protection of a "so
called right to privacy."
The Ninth Amendment, which
states that the enumeration of rights
in the Constitution does not pre
clude the existence of other rights,
stands as a reminder that a right
need not be in the text of the Consti
tution to exist. During the Constitu

tional Convention, many delegates
argued that the inclusion of a Bill of
Rights in the Constitution would
have the unfortunate effect of allow
ing some to believe that the only
rights afforded to Americans are
those listed in the document itself.
In a country that prides itself on
the freedom of its citizens, what
could be more vital than the right to
be left alone, to be free from the fear
of government intrusion into every
aspect of life? If the president nomi
nates a candidate who opposes the
right to privacy in the mold of
Thomas and Scalia, every effort to
prevent his or her confirmation
should be mounted. The stakes are
too high to allow anything less.
