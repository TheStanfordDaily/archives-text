# Arrillaga center finished, set to open next week
## Some student groups upset over delayed opening 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Although construction on the Arrillaga Fam
ily Recreation Center is finished, the decision to
the facility to students has yet to be made, ac
cording to project manager Mark Bonino.
He also stated that the 18-month construc
tion project did not experience any significant
delays. An article in the Stanford Report last
February, however, said that the center was

?expected to open sometimes this summer.?
"The scheduled opening date was a realistic
date given the complexities of constructing a
new building," he said. "The project team made
a strong effort to open a week earlier, but there
were too many little things to do before we
could make the facility available."
Assistant Athletic Director Sherry Posthu
mus anticipates that members of the Stanford
community can begin using the space on Mon
day, Oct. 10. All activities planned for the new
space prior to that date, according to Senior
Associate Athletic Director Ray Purpur, will
still be taking place in other campus spaces.
Also, many classes which were scheduled to be

held in the new fitness center are currently
being taught in Roble Gym, preventing the
Drama Department?s full take over of the site.
"I want to apologize for the delay on behalf
of the Athletic Department and extend my
thanks to all those students who 'rolled with the
punches,"' Posthumus said. "The students have
been exceptionally gracious and have done
everything possible to make a smooth transi
tion. Groups have had to meet outside, weight
training classes have taken on a new twist in
curriculum by very creative and competent
coaches and instructors, and we are doing what
ever it takes to make sure programs function."
Even though some campus athletic groups

expressed disappointment at the delay, several
students said they were impressed by the speed
with which the facility was erected.
"1 understand and appreciate that the center
is not to open until every detail is ready," said
junior Sharon Cu, president of the Stanford
Taekwondo Club. "Unfortunately, the delay has
pressured clubs that will train in the new facility
to postpone practice or frantically try to find
temporary practice space. Members of the Taek
wondo Club have had to tell many beginners
that we are working with a to-be-announced
schedule, which I'm sure is a frustrating re-
