## Cardinal fall again at home Stanford football opens the Pac-10 season Saturday with 44-20 loss to Oregon 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The optimism that the hiring of Walt Harris brought to
the football program this past offseason is becoming a distant
memory. In Stanford's Pacific-10 Conference opener on Sat
urday. Oregon (4-1.1-1) called upon an explosive aerial at
tack and a dominant defensive line to explode fora 37-3 run
and power past the Cardinal, 44-20. Stanford could muster
only 15 yards in the second half, while Oregon racked up 463
passing yards in the contest, the third-most Stanford has al
lowed in 114 years.
Almost nothing the Cardinal defense tried appeared to
slow the Oregon offense. The Ducks accumulated 292 pass
ing yards by the halftime whistle and scored touchdowns on
five consecutive possessions to build a 35-13 lead with 4:48
left in the third quarter. A trio of Ducks spearheaded this of
fensive prowess, as senior quarterback Kellen Clemens
passed for 393 yards and three touchdowns, senior wide re
ceiver Demetrius Williams gained 168 yards and a touch
down on just six receptions, and freshman running back
Jonathan Stewart accounted for an additional three touch
downs.
"You don't like to lose to anybody, but we lost to a team
that looks like a good football team," head coach Walt Har
ris said."They got good l(K>king wide receivers and the quar
terback is executing his scheme well."
While an Oregon attack averaging 464 yards per game
deserves credit, a Stanford defense that ranked third-to-last
nationally in yards allowed must also shoulder the blame.
Stanford allowed Oregon to extend its possessions seeming
ly at will, as the Cardinal saw Oregon convert 10 of 15 third

downs while gaining 595 total yards, the seventh-worst mark
in Stanford history.
"I thought we were not very good [defending the pass]."
Harris said. "I think they have some skill, hut we need to he
stride for stride with [their receivers] and make them make
great catches. I don't think that happened all the time."
So glaring were Stanford's weaknesses in pass defense
that Oregon found little need to run. Though the Ducks
gained 132 rushing yards, most of those occurred with the
game well out of reach, with only nine coming in the first half.
"Their game plan was obviously to pass," fifth-year senior
linebacker Kevin Schimmelmann said. "They didn't try to
run it that much, and they were fine with it. Most teams try to
get a good balance, but they stayed with what was working
and it kept working, unfortunately."
If anything.Stanford's defense was fortunate to hold Ore
gon to 44 points,as the Ducks self-imploded repeatedly. Ore
gon's first two drives ended with a turnover on downs and an
interception by Michael Okwo, the Stanford junior line
backer's first in his collegiate career. Further, the Ducks
racked up 170 yards of penalties, a total so high that it
eclipsed the yards Stanford gained rushing or passing.
"We overcame some of our own mistakes," Oregon head
coach Mike Belotti said. "We probably should have scored
60 points. I'm frustrated by that."
The outlook proved no brighter on offense. Stanford's
lone offensive touchdown came on junior quarterback Trent
Edwards' two-yard strike to junior receiver Mark Bradford.
Fifth-year senior linebacker Jon Alston blocked and recov
ered a punt fora touchdown, and kicker Michael Sgroi, also
a fifth-year senior, added two field goals. Edwards was per
haps the only offensive highlight, as his 16 completions and
156 passing yards came in the face of intense pressure by
Oregon's defensive line.

Sophomore defensive end Gustav Rydstedt sits on the
bench with his teammates after Stanford's second
straight loss.
After allowing a season-worst 10
sacks to Oregon last year, the Stan
ford s offensive line again failed to
handle the Ducks' opposing line. Ore
gon allowed the Cardinal only 2.4
yards per carry, recorded five sacks
and hurried Edwards on countless
other passing attempts.
Harris blames many of these prob
lems on a current talent gap.
"They just got some superior peo
ple to some of our people who were
blocking them, and it wasn't a good af
ternoon after awhile," Harris said.
To top it off, Harris adds the offen
sive line's execution was far from per
fect.
"We had some breakdowns as you
can imagine," said Harris, who must
now prepare the Cardinal to face five
ranked opponents in their eight re
maining games. "It was rough out
there."
Stanford must now prepare fora
visit to Washington State this Saturday.
The latter team fell to 3-1 after drop
ping a 44-33 decision at Oregon State
this past weekend. Harris insists his
team's poor performance is behind
now behind them, and he will instead
focus upon bettering the team in antic
ipation of the Cougars.
"As a coach, I'm opportunistically
looking for the bright side," Harris
said. "A coach tries to pull the best out
of his players. Our job is to get our
players to respond; their job is to try to
improve."

urday. Oregon (4-1.1-1) called upon an explosive aerial at
tack and a dominant defensive line to explode fora 37-3 run
and power past the Cardinal, 44-20. Stanford could muster
only 15 yards in the second half, while Oregon racked up 463
passing yards in the contest, the third-most Stanford has al
lowed in 114 years.
Almost nothing the Cardinal defense tried appeared to
slow the Oregon offense. The Ducks accumulated 292 pass
ing yards by the halftime whistle and scored touchdowns on
five consecutive possessions to build a 35-13 lead with 4:48
left in the third quarter. A trio of Ducks spearheaded this of
fensive prowess, as senior quarterback Kellen Clemens
passed for 393 yards and three touchdowns, senior wide re
ceiver Demetrius Williams gained 168 yards and a touch
down on just six receptions, and freshman running back
Jonathan Stewart accounted for an additional three touch
downs.
"You don't like to lose to anybody, but we lost to a team
that looks like a good football team," head coach Walt Har
ris said."They got good l(K>king wide receivers and the quar
terback is executing his scheme well."
While an Oregon attack averaging 464 yards per game
deserves credit, a Stanford defense that ranked third-to-last
nationally in yards allowed must also shoulder the blame.
Stanford allowed Oregon to extend its possessions seeming
ly at will, as the Cardinal saw Oregon convert 10 of 15 third

downs while gaining 595 total yards, the seventh-worst mark
in Stanford history.
"I thought we were not very good [defending the pass]."
Harris said. "I think they have some skill, hut we need to he
stride for stride with [their receivers] and make them make
great catches. I don't think that happened all the time."
So glaring were Stanford's weaknesses in pass defense
that Oregon found little need to run. Though the Ducks
gained 132 rushing yards, most of those occurred with the
game well out of reach, with only nine coming in the first half.
"Their game plan was obviously to pass," fifth-year senior
linebacker Kevin Schimmelmann said. "They didn't try to
run it that much, and they were fine with it. Most teams try to
get a good balance, but they stayed with what was working
and it kept working, unfortunately."
If anything.Stanford's defense was fortunate to hold Ore
gon to 44 points,as the Ducks self-imploded repeatedly. Ore
gon's first two drives ended with a turnover on downs and an
interception by Michael Okwo, the Stanford junior line
backer's first in his collegiate career. Further, the Ducks
racked up 170 yards of penalties, a total so high that it
eclipsed the yards Stanford gained rushing or passing.
"We overcame some of our own mistakes," Oregon head
coach Mike Belotti said. "We probably should have scored
60 points. I'm frustrated by that."
The outlook proved no brighter on offense. Stanford's
lone offensive touchdown came on junior quarterback Trent
Edwards' two-yard strike to junior receiver Mark Bradford.
Fifth-year senior linebacker Jon Alston blocked and recov
ered a punt fora touchdown, and kicker Michael Sgroi, also
a fifth-year senior, added two field goals. Edwards was per
haps the only offensive highlight, as his 16 completions and
156 passing yards came in the face of intense pressure by
Oregon's defensive line.

Sophomore defensive end Gustav Rydstedt sits on the
bench with his teammates after Stanford's second
straight loss.
After allowing a season-worst 10
sacks to Oregon last year, the Stan
ford s offensive line again failed to
handle the Ducks' opposing line. Ore
gon allowed the Cardinal only 2.4
yards per carry, recorded five sacks
and hurried Edwards on countless
other passing attempts.
Harris blames many of these prob
lems on a current talent gap.
"They just got some superior peo
ple to some of our people who were
blocking them, and it wasn't a good af
ternoon after awhile," Harris said.
To top it off, Harris adds the offen
sive line's execution was far from per
fect.
"We had some breakdowns as you
can imagine," said Harris, who must
now prepare the Cardinal to face five
ranked opponents in their eight re
maining games. "It was rough out
there."
Stanford must now prepare fora
visit to Washington State this Saturday.
The latter team fell to 3-1 after drop
ping a 44-33 decision at Oregon State
this past weekend. Harris insists his
team's poor performance is behind
now behind them, and he will instead
focus upon bettering the team in antic
ipation of the Cougars.
"As a coach, I'm opportunistically
looking for the bright side," Harris
said. "A coach tries to pull the best out
of his players. Our job is to get our
players to respond; their job is to try to
improve."
