# Women win twice at Invite
## 
### WENDI GOH 
Excitement was in the air as Stanford women's soc
cer (6-3-1) scored two impressive victories over No. 5
Santa Clara (9-2-1) and Colorado College (6-4-1) at
the Stanford Nike Invitational this weekend.The Car
dinal. returning home after a long run of matches on
the road, delighted their fans with spirited and aggres
sive play with sophomore Rachel Buehler scoring in
both matches.
The fans packed the stands on Friday night as the
unranked Cardinal netted a hard fought victory over
their Bronco rivals. ITie crowd that gathered was the
eighth largest ever at Maloney field and the 1,718 fans,
many who had to stand or sit on the ground, were re
warded by high-quality soccer from a Santa Clara team
that had lost only one match this season.
Stanford entered the match riding high after a con
vincing 2-1 win over Navy just a week ago. However,
this was overshadowed by speculation over the Cardi
nal's top-scorer of the season — senior midfielder
Leah Tapscott — and her ability to play after suffer
ing an injury in that win. In the days prior to the match,
head coach Paul Ratcliffe had been optimistic about
Tapscott s abilities, but this optimism did not translate
into immediate playing time, as she stood on the side
lines on crutches as Cardinal's starting 11 ran onto the
field.
"Tapscott is out fora while," Ratcliffe said after the
match. "We're hoping she can come back [later this
season]."
Despite Tapscott's absence, Stan
ford played a solid game going on
the attack early in the first half. The
Cardinal's only goal came in the 24th
minute of the match as junior de
fender / midfielder Rachel Buehler
scored from eight yards out via an as
sist from freshman defender / mid
fielder Allison Falk.
"It was off a set play," Buehler
said."Haley [Hunt] had played a nice
ball in and [Allison Falk] got on to the
end of it and it just popped down to
wards me, and I just finished it in."
Santa Clara almost equalized at
the end of the first half when junior
Tina Estrada beat Cardinal fresh
man goalie Alex Gamble after con
necting to the end of junior Marian
Dalmy's free kick. However, the ref
eree ruled the goal offside and the
Cardinal finished the first half with
the lead.
Hie second half continued with
the same level of intensity as the
first, and although good chances
were created by both sides, neither
team scored in the final 45 minutes
of the match.
The Broncos defeated Stanford
in the last competitive meeting be
tween the two teams, when a 1-0 de
feat knocked the Cardinal of the
second round of the NCAAs last
season. The fierce rivalry between
the Cardinal and the Broncos was
prominently factored in the match

as five bookings were made during
the game. Three Stanford players
and two Santa Clara were shown
yellow cards, and a total of 55 fouls
were committed throughout the
match.

Ratcliffe was delighted by his
team's performance, calling the win
"significant" and "hard-fought". The
victory over the Broncos should con
tribute to Stanford's plan to host the
early rounds of the NCAA tourna

ment.
On Sunday, Stanford finished off
its tournament with a convincing 2-0
win over Colorado College. In this
game the Cardinal outlasted their
opponents as Gamble picked up her

fourth shutout of the season.
Buehler scored her second goal in
as many games in the eighth minute
when an assist from Haley Hunt en
abled her to head the ball into the
goal. This weekend marked the start
of Buehler's collegiate scoring ca
reer after missing the 2004 season
playing for the U.S. Under-19 team in
Thailand.
The Cardinal continued to domi
nate in the second half as senior
Martha West, freshman defender/
midfielders Kate Manino and
Marisa Abegg, and Buehler all creat
ed good chances to score. Stanford
secured the victory in the 80th
minute when sophomore midfielder
Lizzy George scored her third goal
of the season after heading on a pow
erful cross from sophomore mid
fielder forward April Wall.
"I made so many runs the entire
day," George said. "1 was hoping just
one time the ball would come the
right way, then April came dribbling
across and the ball came towards me,
and there was no one around so 1 just
[headed] it past the goalkeeper. It
was an awesome goal and this came
about from a lot of hard work from
my team."
Stanford's success this weekend
brings its winning streak to three
games after a relatively slow start to
the season.
Ratcliffe noted that it was a great
weekend to lead into Pacific-10 Con
ference play, which starts this Friday.
"It was a great team effort, and
the two goals we scared were superb
headers ...We are creating more and
more opportunities, and we have
high expectations."

vincing 2-1 win over Navy just a week ago. However,
this was overshadowed by speculation over the Cardi
nal's top-scorer of the season — senior midfielder
Leah Tapscott — and her ability to play after suffer
ing an injury in that win. In the days prior to the match,
head coach Paul Ratcliffe had been optimistic about
Tapscott s abilities, but this optimism did not translate
into immediate playing time, as she stood on the side
lines on crutches as Cardinal's starting 11 ran onto the
field.
"Tapscott is out fora while," Ratcliffe said after the
match. "We're hoping she can come back [later this
season]."
Despite Tapscott's absence, Stan
ford played a solid game going on
the attack early in the first half. The
Cardinal's only goal came in the 24th
minute of the match as junior de
fender / midfielder Rachel Buehler
scored from eight yards out via an as
sist from freshman defender / mid
fielder Allison Falk.
"It was off a set play," Buehler
said."Haley [Hunt] had played a nice
ball in and [Allison Falk] got on to the
end of it and it just popped down to
wards me, and I just finished it in."
Santa Clara almost equalized at
the end of the first half when junior
Tina Estrada beat Cardinal fresh
man goalie Alex Gamble after con
necting to the end of junior Marian
Dalmy's free kick. However, the ref
eree ruled the goal offside and the
Cardinal finished the first half with
the lead.
Hie second half continued with
the same level of intensity as the
first, and although good chances
were created by both sides, neither
team scored in the final 45 minutes
of the match.
The Broncos defeated Stanford
in the last competitive meeting be
tween the two teams, when a 1-0 de
feat knocked the Cardinal of the
second round of the NCAAs last
season. The fierce rivalry between
the Cardinal and the Broncos was
prominently factored in the match

as five bookings were made during
the game. Three Stanford players
and two Santa Clara were shown
yellow cards, and a total of 55 fouls
were committed throughout the
match.

Ratcliffe was delighted by his
team's performance, calling the win
"significant" and "hard-fought". The
victory over the Broncos should con
tribute to Stanford's plan to host the
early rounds of the NCAA tourna

ment.
On Sunday, Stanford finished off
its tournament with a convincing 2-0
win over Colorado College. In this
game the Cardinal outlasted their
opponents as Gamble picked up her

fourth shutout of the season.
Buehler scored her second goal in
as many games in the eighth minute
when an assist from Haley Hunt en
abled her to head the ball into the
goal. This weekend marked the start
of Buehler's collegiate scoring ca
reer after missing the 2004 season
playing for the U.S. Under-19 team in
Thailand.
The Cardinal continued to domi
nate in the second half as senior
Martha West, freshman defender/
midfielders Kate Manino and
Marisa Abegg, and Buehler all creat
ed good chances to score. Stanford
secured the victory in the 80th
minute when sophomore midfielder
Lizzy George scored her third goal
of the season after heading on a pow
erful cross from sophomore mid
fielder forward April Wall.
"I made so many runs the entire
day," George said. "1 was hoping just
one time the ball would come the
right way, then April came dribbling
across and the ball came towards me,
and there was no one around so 1 just
[headed] it past the goalkeeper. It
was an awesome goal and this came
about from a lot of hard work from
my team."
Stanford's success this weekend
brings its winning streak to three
games after a relatively slow start to
the season.
Ratcliffe noted that it was a great
weekend to lead into Pacific-10 Con
ference play, which starts this Friday.
"It was a great team effort, and
the two goals we scared were superb
headers ...We are creating more and
more opportunities, and we have
high expectations."
