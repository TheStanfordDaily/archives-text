# Yankee hats and pinstripes are the new black
## 
### 
It's amazing, the range of reactions you get when you
wear a New York Yankees hat around town fora cou
ple of weeks.
But first, as I have had to explain to nearly everyone
who has seen me wearing this damned thing: No, I am
not a Yankees fan. Duh. Rooting for those All-Star
Horders these days is sort of like being a Julius Caesar
fan in ancient Rome: Yeah, he's the best, but you know
what's gonna happen. Watching him conquer empires is
like watching grass grow. You're always sort of rooting
for Brutus to come along with that shiv...
There's nothing more radical you can do these days
than to root for those close-cropped, clean-shaven, pin
striped suits (it's almost as rebellious as being a Repub
lican). Outside of Manhattan, they are universally hated.
When I saw my friend Jeremy, a Cubs fan, in the book
store before school started — mind you, I hadn't seen
this guy since June — he took one look at me, tore the
hat from my head, threw it to the floor and trampled on
it. No hug. No "How was your summer?" Just utter ha
tred towards the most maligned team in sports. His ma
niacal grin showed me just how much pleasure he took
in the whole thing.
Jeremy admitted feeling a bit guilty later on when I
explained that I had the hat because I coached a Little
League team called the Yankees when I was in high
school. But his face still contorts into a pained scowl
whenever he sees me wearing it, and I can tell that he is
straining with every muscle in his body to keep from rip
ping it off my head again.
I'm more of a Red Sox fan (bo-ring), but maybe the
hat is a part of my never-ending quest to go against the
crowd. I tried dying my hair, wearing eye makeup and
streaking, but all to no avail. I really believe that there is
nothing I could do, save maybe killing a man in broad
daylight or praising Walt Harris, that would elicit as
much of a response as the simple 'NY' logo does.
But wearing the much-reviled hat has some benefits. I
haven't come across a single guy who has responded to it
with anything but a sneer and a slur, but it seems as though
every female who is from anywhere within three states of
New York stops to compliment me on my choice and in
quire into my future availability. (Okay, maybe not the
last part but their eyes do light up when 1 drop a line about
the cute Little Leaguers).
My explanation of this gender-biased response is sim
ple. Guys tend to be sports fans and are therefore
ashamed to admit that they root for the Yankees, a team
renowned for taking the sport out of baseball by buying
the best players every off-season. Anyone who enjoys
actual competition is therefore required to loathe the
Dream Stealers, a team that tries its hardest to make
winning automatic. Every time a team knocks the Yanks
off their 'World Series Champs' pedestal, it's vindication
of the integrity of the sport and, by extension, of free en
terprise itself. No monopolies here.
Conversely, women tend to like the Yankees for two
reasons: Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. Even I have
to admit that the Corporate Whores have the most
graceful left side of the infield since Brooks Robinson
manned the hot corner for the Baltimore Orioles with
whoever happened to be playing next to him that day.
How these enraptured female fans can overlook the
physical appearances of Hideki "Godzilla" Matsui and
Randy "Big Bird" Johnson is beyond me. Maybe they
only watch the commercials authored by the former two
instead of the actual games.
It's a funny thing about the Yankees: It seems that
