# Yankee hats and pinstripes are the new black
## 
### 
It's amazing, the range of reactions you get when you
wear a New York Yankees hat around town fora cou
ple of weeks.
But first, as I have had to explain to nearly everyone
who has seen me wearing this damned thing: No, I am
not a Yankees fan. Duh. Rooting for those All-Star
Horders these days is sort of like being a Julius Caesar
fan in ancient Rome: Yeah, he's the best, but you know
what's gonna happen. Watching him conquer empires is
like watching grass grow. You're always sort of rooting
for Brutus to come along with that shiv...
There's nothing more radical you can do these days
than to root for those close-cropped, clean-shaven, pin
striped suits (it's almost as rebellious as being a Repub
lican). Outside of Manhattan, they are universally hated.
When I saw my friend Jeremy, a Cubs fan, in the book
store before school started — mind you, I hadn't seen
this guy since June — he took one look at me, tore the
hat from my head, threw it to the floor and trampled on
it. No hug. No "How was your summer?" Just utter ha
tred towards the most maligned team in sports. His ma
niacal grin showed me just how much pleasure he took
in the whole thing.
Jeremy admitted feeling a bit guilty later on when I
explained that I had the hat because I coached a Little
League team called the Yankees when I was in high
school. But his face still contorts into a pained scowl
whenever he sees me wearing it, and I can tell that he is
straining with every muscle in his body to keep from rip
ping it off my head again.
I'm more of a Red Sox fan (bo-ring), but maybe the
hat is a part of my never-ending quest to go against the
crowd. I tried dying my hair, wearing eye makeup and
streaking, but all to no avail. I really believe that there is
nothing I could do, save maybe killing a man in broad
daylight or praising Walt Harris, that would elicit as
much of a response as the simple 'NY' logo does.
But wearing the much-reviled hat has some benefits. I
haven't come across a single guy who has responded to it
with anything but a sneer and a slur, but it seems as though
every female who is from anywhere within three states of
New York stops to compliment me on my choice and in
quire into my future availability. (Okay, maybe not the
last part but their eyes do light up when 1 drop a line about
the cute Little Leaguers).
My explanation of this gender-biased response is sim
ple. Guys tend to be sports fans and are therefore
ashamed to admit that they root for the Yankees, a team
renowned for taking the sport out of baseball by buying
the best players every off-season. Anyone who enjoys
actual competition is therefore required to loathe the
Dream Stealers, a team that tries its hardest to make
winning automatic. Every time a team knocks the Yanks
off their 'World Series Champs' pedestal, it's vindication
of the integrity of the sport and, by extension, of free en
terprise itself. No monopolies here.
Conversely, women tend to like the Yankees for two
reasons: Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. Even I have
to admit that the Corporate Whores have the most
graceful left side of the infield since Brooks Robinson
manned the hot corner for the Baltimore Orioles with
whoever happened to be playing next to him that day.
How these enraptured female fans can overlook the
physical appearances of Hideki "Godzilla" Matsui and
Randy "Big Bird" Johnson is beyond me. Maybe they
only watch the commercials authored by the former two
instead of the actual games.
It's a funny thing about the Yankees: It seems that


Sean
Howell
Go Robber Barons!
most players sign their names on
Boss Steinbrenner's dotted line in
spite of their instincts. 'Well, the
Yankees suck, but they are offering
me three times as much money as
anyone else, a leg and a torso up on
a shot at a ring, as well as the adora
tion of those tri-state ladies ... fine.
Why not?" the line of thinking
seems to go. Alex Rodriguez des
perately wanted to play in Fenway
after having demanded a trade
from Texas, but no matter how
quickly Boston's phenom GM,
Theo Epstein, crunched the num
bers, he couldn't get the city of
Boston to transfer money from the
Big Dig into A-Rod's account.
Other than angry friends and
adoring hordes of women, there ex
ists another breed of people I have
encountered while wearing the cap:
people who, just like me, wear Yan
kees' gear without having a socially
acceptable explanation. 1 was on
my way to a party on Friday when I
met a freshman who nodded
solemnly when I related my Yankee
hat story. He told me that the pair
of Yankee shorts he wears around
earns him tons of flak from his bud
dies. Others seem embarrassed and
somewhat befuddled about the
Yankee paraphernalia they own.
Are they trendsetters who reject
the Sox's popular hobo look in
favor of the Yanks' corporate one?
Girl chasers? Unwilling bandwag
on-jumpers?
The fact is, somebody has to like
the Yanks these days. It would be a
tragedy to let the best and highest
paid team in baseball become the
biggest underdog in the game as
well. They already have way too
much going for them.
The only way for the Red Sox to
maintain their charm — and their
claim to the title — is if the rest of us
bite the bullet and start rooting for
the Yankees. The Fascist Pigs' own
best player wishes he were wearing
red socks, for goodness' sake. Seems
to me that the odds are stacked
against them. The ghost of Babe
Ruth, who in the past has been wont
to work for the favorites, just might
recall that the Yanks traded him to
the Boston Braves late in his career
and start haunting the House that He
Built.
So please, make the Sox lovable
again. Let Johnny Damon's yeti
look and Manny Ramirez's long
dreads remain the symbols of anar
chy and baseball insurgency against
the icy corporate mentality of the
Imperialists. Even if the very sight of
Jason Giambi makes you gag, try
wearing some Yankee gear. It's like
the superstitious thing Nomar does
with the batting gloves, only this one
will actually work. Do it for the 'id
iots,' as the Sox are so affectionately
dubbed. It might be the only thing
that can stop the Soul Suckers this
playoff season.

Sean Howell is a junior who can
probably think of worse names to
call the Yankees than "Dream Steal
ers. " But then those wouldn 7 be pub
lished. E-mail him at shdwell@stan

Girl chasers? Unwilling bandwag
on-jumpers?
The fact is, somebody has to like
the Yanks these days. It would be a
tragedy to let the best and highest
paid team in baseball become the
biggest underdog in the game as
well. They already have way too
much going for them.
The only way for the Red Sox to
maintain their charm — and their
claim to the title — is if the rest of us
bite the bullet and start rooting for
the Yankees. The Fascist Pigs' own
best player wishes he were wearing
red socks, for goodness' sake. Seems
to me that the odds are stacked
against them. The ghost of Babe
Ruth, who in the past has been wont
to work for the favorites, just might
recall that the Yanks traded him to
the Boston Braves late in his career
and start haunting the House that He
Built.
So please, make the Sox lovable
again. Let Johnny Damon's yeti
look and Manny Ramirez's long
dreads remain the symbols of anar
chy and baseball insurgency against
the icy corporate mentality of the
Imperialists. Even if the very sight of
Jason Giambi makes you gag, try
wearing some Yankee gear. It's like
the superstitious thing Nomar does
with the batting gloves, only this one
will actually work. Do it for the 'id
iots,' as the Sox are so affectionately
dubbed. It might be the only thing
that can stop the Soul Suckers this
playoff season.

probably think of worse names to
call the Yankees than "Dream Steal

It's amazing, the range of reactions you get when you
wear a New York Yankees hat around town fora cou
ple of weeks.
But first, as I have had to explain to nearly everyone
who has seen me wearing this damned thing: No, I am
not a Yankees fan. Duh. Rooting for those All-Star
Horders these days is sort of like being a Julius Caesar
fan in ancient Rome: Yeah, he's the best, but you know
what's gonna happen. Watching him conquer empires is
like watching grass grow. You're always sort of rooting
for Brutus to come along with that shiv...
There's nothing more radical you can do these days
than to root for those close-cropped, clean-shaven, pin
striped suits (it's almost as rebellious as being a Repub
lican). Outside of Manhattan, they are universally hated.
When I saw my friend Jeremy, a Cubs fan, in the book
store before school started — mind you, I hadn't seen
this guy since June — he took one look at me, tore the
hat from my head, threw it to the floor and trampled on
it. No hug. No "How was your summer?" Just utter ha
tred towards the most maligned team in sports. His ma
niacal grin showed me just how much pleasure he took
in the whole thing.
Jeremy admitted feeling a bit guilty later on when I
explained that I had the hat because I coached a Little
League team called the Yankees when I was in high
school. But his face still contorts into a pained scowl
whenever he sees me wearing it, and I can tell that he is
straining with every muscle in his body to keep from rip
ping it off my head again.
I'm more of a Red Sox fan (bo-ring), but maybe the
hat is a part of my never-ending quest to go against the
crowd. I tried dying my hair, wearing eye makeup and
streaking, but all to no avail. I really believe that there is
nothing I could do, save maybe killing a man in broad
daylight or praising Walt Harris, that would elicit as
much of a response as the simple 'NY' logo does.
But wearing the much-reviled hat has some benefits. I
haven't come across a single guy who has responded to it
with anything but a sneer and a slur, but it seems as though
every female who is from anywhere within three states of
New York stops to compliment me on my choice and in
quire into my future availability. (Okay, maybe not the
last part but their eyes do light up when 1 drop a line about
the cute Little Leaguers).
My explanation of this gender-biased response is sim
ple. Guys tend to be sports fans and are therefore
ashamed to admit that they root for the Yankees, a team
renowned for taking the sport out of baseball by buying
the best players every off-season. Anyone who enjoys
actual competition is therefore required to loathe the
Dream Stealers, a team that tries its hardest to make
winning automatic. Every time a team knocks the Yanks
off their 'World Series Champs' pedestal, it's vindication
of the integrity of the sport and, by extension, of free en
terprise itself. No monopolies here.
Conversely, women tend to like the Yankees for two
reasons: Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. Even I have
to admit that the Corporate Whores have the most
graceful left side of the infield since Brooks Robinson
manned the hot corner for the Baltimore Orioles with
whoever happened to be playing next to him that day.
How these enraptured female fans can overlook the
physical appearances of Hideki "Godzilla" Matsui and
Randy "Big Bird" Johnson is beyond me. Maybe they
only watch the commercials authored by the former two
instead of the actual games.
It's a funny thing about the Yankees: It seems that

most players sign their names on
Boss Steinbrenner's dotted line in
spite of their instincts. 'Well, the
Yankees suck, but they are offering
me three times as much money as
anyone else, a leg and a torso up on
a shot at a ring, as well as the adora
tion of those tri-state ladies ... fine.
Why not?" the line of thinking
seems to go. Alex Rodriguez des
perately wanted to play in Fenway

from Texas, but no matter how

people who, just like me, wear Yan

my way to a party on Friday when I
met a freshman who nodded
solemnly when I related my Yankee
hat story. He told me that the pair
of Yankee shorts he wears around

somewhat befuddled about the
Yankee paraphernalia they own.
