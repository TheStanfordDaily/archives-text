# Volleyball scores 3-0 victory
## Junior Kristin Richards leads the Cardinal with 19 kills 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Balance is a key to success in any sport;
in most cases, it means getting every player
to contribute to the team's success.The No.
3 Stanford women's volleyball team (15-1,
4-0 Pacific-10 Conference) is no exception
to that rule.
After the departure of Ogonna Nna
mani. each player on the roster has proven
capable of stepping up and turning in a ca
reer performance. In Stanford's 3-0 win
over the Oregon Ducks (10-5,0-4) Friday
night, it was Kristin Richards's turn.
The junior outside hitter asserted her
self at the net with dominant and nearly
flawless hitting. She posted a match-high
19 kills and committed only one hitting
error during the entire match, leaving her
with a hitting percentage of .529 — more
than double her career average.
Until Richards put together a string of
kills in the third game, it looked to be a
close race with freshman middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo for the best offensive
game. Akinradewo finished second in kills
with 16, keeping her season hitting per
centage well over .400.
"Kristin certainly had some great nights
last year," head coach John Dunning said.
"But this year, having [freshman] Cynthia
[Barboza], Kristin and Foluke, and [junior]

Nji [Nnamani] at times, and [sophomore]
Franci [Girard] — it changes the way that
people are going to play against us. We
know that if we keep getting better and can
get even more people to have big nights the
same night, then we will be very difficult to
deal with."
While Richards was obliterating the
Ducks up front, Akinradewo was the Car
dinal's most potent defensive threat. Of the
10 blocks the team recorded, she was in
volved in seven of them, including five solo
stuffs. Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe com
bined with Akinradewo on two of those
blocks and dished out all of Stanford's 48
assists. Playing her usual solid game in the
libero position, senior Courtney Schultz
collected a match-high 16 digs, most of
them coming in the first two games.
"Oregon had some great hitters and
some great servers," Schultz said. "So we
needed to neutralize their two big hitters
and make it a game about us instead of
them, not letting them dictate how we were
going to play."
Schultz and the rest of the Cardinal de
fense did just that, shutting down the
Ducks offense, especially in the second and
third games. Ouside hitter Mira Djuric tal
lied 18 kills for Oregon but an improved
Stanford defense late in the match held her
to a negative hitting percentage for the last
hour of play.
Aided by some Oregon errors, the Cardi
nal came out strong to start the match 5-1.
After clawing their way back into a tie,
the Ducks won a long rally to take
their first lead at 10-9. Soon after, the
Cardinal found themselves down by
two at 15-13. Stanford caught up, tying
it at 20-20 on a quick kill by Akinrade
wo. A few moments later, Richards
powered three straight balls to the
floor to put the Cardinal back on top
23-21, but Oregon soon tied the game
again.
Richards finally put the game
away, 30-28, with her ninth kill of the
night. She and Akinradewo con
tributed the majority of Stanford's
points, combining for 16 kills on .538
hitting. Schultz tallied 11 digs in the
first game alone, more than half of
the team's defensive output.
"Oregon is really trying to step
up," Dunning said of the closely
matched game. "They had had a
darn close match against Cal the
night before and got confidence
from it ... A great equalizer in
teams is the team that wants it
more. And sometimes when you
win a lot, it doesn't motivate you to
keep winning as much as a team
that has just lost. Once we got it
going, we got lucky and won game
one. Then we stepped up a notch
and they had a hard time matching
us."
The Cardinal shook off their trou
bles from the first game, crushing the
Ducks in the second game. Stanford
again built an early lead, powered by

four kills and a solo block by Akin
radewo. Barboza sparked a Stanford
ran rampant, sealing the 30-15 victo
ry with a kill by freshman middle
Erin Waller, who played the last 10
points of the game. Stanford's of
fense was consistent through the first
two games while the Ducks saw their
hitting percentage plummet from
.373 in the first game to .021 in the
second.
Already posting great numbers,
Richards took it up a notch in the
third game, catapulting the Cardi
nal to a 7-2 lead. After closing to
within three points, the Ducks fell
behind by nine, and took a timeout.
The Oregon offense and service
game picked up the pace, but Stan
ford took the game 30-23 when the
Ducks could not return a serve
from Richards.
"The thing that is amazing about
the Pac-10 is that every year you think
this team won't be as good or that
team won't be as good," Dunning
said. "But "not as good' is still pretty
tremendous and everybody that we
play is very good ...there are so many
teams that are good enough to win
out there that you can really hurt
yourself by not being ready."
The Cardinal are in preparation
for next weekend, when they get the
opportunity to defend their court
against last year's conference cham
pion No. 2 Washington, which is still
undefeated this year.
"I am slightly pessimist[ice] and I
did not expect such a young team to
play this well this early in the sea
son," Schultz said. "1 look forward to
playing Washington. It will be a good
test for us.

Outside hitter freshman Cynthia Barboza proves to be one of many Cardinal
players to step up in the road win against Oregon.
