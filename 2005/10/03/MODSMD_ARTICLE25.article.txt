# Volleyball scores 3-0 victory
## Junior Kristin Richards leads the Cardinal with 19 kills

Balance is a key to success in any sport;
in most cases, it means getting every player
to contribute to the team's success.The No.
3 Stanford women's volleyball team (15-1,
4-0 Pacific-10 Conference) is no exception
to that rule.
After the departure of Ogonna Nna
mani. each player on the roster has proven
capable of stepping up and turning in a ca
reer performance. In Stanford's 3-0 win
over the Oregon Ducks (10-5,0-4) Friday
night, it was Kristin Richards's turn.
The junior outside hitter asserted her
self at the net with dominant and nearly
flawless hitting. She posted a match-high
19 kills and committed only one hitting
error during the entire match, leaving her
with a hitting percentage of .529 — more
than double her career average.
Until Richards put together a string of
kills in the third game, it looked to be a
close race with freshman middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo for the best offensive
game. Akinradewo finished second in kills
with 16, keeping her season hitting per
centage well over .400.
"Kristin certainly had some great nights
last year," head coach John Dunning said.
"But this year, having [freshman] Cynthia
[Barboza], Kristin and Foluke, and [junior]

Nji [Nnamani] at times, and [sophomore]
Franci [Girard] — it changes the way that
people are going to play against us. We
know that if we keep getting better and can
get even more people to have big nights the
same night, then we will be very difficult to
deal with."
While Richards was obliterating the
Ducks up front, Akinradewo was the Car
dinal's most potent defensive threat. Of the
10 blocks the team recorded, she was in
volved in seven of them, including five solo
stuffs. Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe com
bined with Akinradewo on two of those
blocks and dished out all of Stanford's 48
assists. Playing her usual solid game in the
libero position, senior Courtney Schultz
collected a match-high 16 digs, most of
them coming in the first two games.
"Oregon had some great hitters and
some great servers," Schultz said. "So we
needed to neutralize their two big hitters
and make it a game about us instead of
them, not letting them dictate how we were
going to play."
Schultz and the rest of the Cardinal de
fense did just that, shutting down the
Ducks offense, especially in the second and
third games. Ouside hitter Mira Djuric tal
lied 18 kills for Oregon but an improved
Stanford defense late in the match held her
to a negative hitting percentage for the last
hour of play.
Aided by some Oregon errors, the Cardi
nal came out strong to start the match 5-1.
