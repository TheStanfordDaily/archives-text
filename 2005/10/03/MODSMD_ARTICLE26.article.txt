## 
### ROHAN KHARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University relived the lega
cy of nonviolence by celebrating Gand
hi Jayanti, Mahatma Gandhi's birthday,
on Oct. 1 and 2.
The Stanford Indian Association
(SIA) and South Asian American
Leaders of Tomorrow (SAALT) col
laborated to celebrate this occasion on
Saturday. The motto of the event was
Gandhi's famous phrase, "Be the
change you wish to see in the world".
Mahatma Gandhi, a staunch sup
porter of nonviolence, was known for
saying that he would support "violence
only to cowardice." Saturday kicked off
with Gandhi's two favorite bhajans, In
dian hymns — "Vaishnav Jan" and
"Raghu Pati Raghav" — followed by
events like the "Chal Ekala Re,"a
dance performed by graduate student
Aditi Kapoor and others, and "Making
of Gandhi," a presentation by graduate
student Rashmi Raghu in which she
told anecdotes from Gandhi's life.
The second half of the celebration

was held at Lytton Gardens, a senior cit
izens home in Palo Alto, where SLA and
SAALT members performed the same
events for Alzheimer's patients and
other residents.
Susan Englander, assistant editor of
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject at Stanford, spoke about how Mar
tin Luther King considered Gandhi the
"greatest Christian of the 20th century."
The Hindu Student Council (HSC)
coordinated yesterday's events
"We want to reach to undergrads
and graduate students about this event
and spread how Gandhi influenced
people in different cultures," said junior
Deepa Alagesan. the co-president of
HSC."Gandhi's messages are universal
in nature and not specific to any partic
ular culture or religion."
Morghan Vetez Young from The
World Peace Buddhist's said "the show
was fantastic and a great occasion for
discussion of topics like Non Violence."
Young named "Sanctity of life and
internal and social transformations"
as the two things that really intersect
between Gandhi's philosophy and

Buddhism.
Pastor Richard Foster, chaplain to
the Episcopal Lutheran Campus Min
istry, also spoke in honor of Gandhi.
"Gandhi was a bridge builder be
tween different cultures," he said.
"Gandhi was the one who brought to
gether people from different faiths and
that was and still is very important in
today's times. Gandhi was the univer
sal voice of mankind and I sincerely
believe in Gandhi's preaching that 'an
eye for an eye' would make the world
go blind. Retribution is not the solu
tion to pcace."
Foster said he was most influenced
by Gandhi's complete commitment to
the most vulnerable in society — the
untouchables and the poorest of the
poor.
Management Science and Engi
neering Prof Ron Howard discussed
Gandhi's philosophy of a nonviolent
society.
"While a nonviolent society is the ul
timate goal, the first logical step to
achieve is a noncoercive society," he
said. "Peaceful, honest people have the

right to be left alone."
Brandon Hunter, a social science re
search assistant for the Martin Luther
King Jr. Papers Project, commented
that "Gandhi re affirmed Martin
Luther King's faith in the act of nonvio
lence. Loving your enemies is truly the
best means of removing your enemies.
Capacity to love anyone is what was
common between King and Gandhi.
Both were embodied with so much love
for everyone."
Leila Ruhieh Ehsani, a graduate stu
dent from the Stanford Baha'i group,
commented that the whole effort to
convey the message of Gandhi's philos
ophy was wonderful.
"I loved the way in which the arts,
bhajans and dances conveyed so much
about Gandhi's life," she said.
Ehsani said that Gandhi's philoso
phy of only one religion and only one
God is very common in the Baha'i cul
ture.
"The way in which Gandhi lived up
to his words and was consistent with his
deeds is what inspires me the most
about him," she said.

"The way in which Gandhi lived up
to his words and was consistent with his
deeds is what inspires me the most
about him," she said.
Stanford University relived the lega
cy of nonviolence by celebrating Gand
hi Jayanti, Mahatma Gandhi's birthday,
on Oct. 1 and 2.
The Stanford Indian Association
(SIA) and South Asian American
Leaders of Tomorrow (SAALT) col
laborated to celebrate this occasion on
Saturday. The motto of the event was
Gandhi's famous phrase, "Be the
change you wish to see in the world".
Mahatma Gandhi, a staunch sup
porter of nonviolence, was known for
saying that he would support "violence
only to cowardice." Saturday kicked off
with Gandhi's two favorite bhajans, In
dian hymns — "Vaishnav Jan" and
"Raghu Pati Raghav" — followed by
events like the "Chal Ekala Re,"a
dance performed by graduate student
Aditi Kapoor and others, and "Making
of Gandhi," a presentation by graduate
student Rashmi Raghu in which she
told anecdotes from Gandhi's life.
The second half of the celebration

was held at Lytton Gardens, a senior cit
izens home in Palo Alto, where SLA and
SAALT members performed the same
events for Alzheimer's patients and
other residents.
Susan Englander, assistant editor of
the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Pro
ject at Stanford, spoke about how Mar
tin Luther King considered Gandhi the
"greatest Christian of the 20th century."
The Hindu Student Council (HSC)
coordinated yesterday's events
"We want to reach to undergrads
and graduate students about this event
and spread how Gandhi influenced
people in different cultures," said junior
Deepa Alagesan. the co-president of
HSC."Gandhi's messages are universal
in nature and not specific to any partic
ular culture or religion."
Morghan Vetez Young from The
World Peace Buddhist's said "the show
was fantastic and a great occasion for
discussion of topics like Non Violence."
Young named "Sanctity of life and
internal and social transformations"
as the two things that really intersect
between Gandhi's philosophy and

Buddhism.
Pastor Richard Foster, chaplain to
the Episcopal Lutheran Campus Min
istry, also spoke in honor of Gandhi.
"Gandhi was a bridge builder be
tween different cultures," he said.
"Gandhi was the one who brought to
gether people from different faiths and
that was and still is very important in
today's times. Gandhi was the univer
sal voice of mankind and I sincerely
believe in Gandhi's preaching that 'an
eye for an eye' would make the world
go blind. Retribution is not the solu
tion to pcace."
Foster said he was most influenced
by Gandhi's complete commitment to
the most vulnerable in society — the
untouchables and the poorest of the
poor.
Management Science and Engi
neering Prof Ron Howard discussed
Gandhi's philosophy of a nonviolent
society.
"While a nonviolent society is the ul
timate goal, the first logical step to
achieve is a noncoercive society," he
said. "Peaceful, honest people have the

right to be left alone."
Brandon Hunter, a social science re
search assistant for the Martin Luther
King Jr. Papers Project, commented
that "Gandhi re affirmed Martin
Luther King's faith in the act of nonvio
lence. Loving your enemies is truly the
best means of removing your enemies.
Capacity to love anyone is what was
common between King and Gandhi.
Both were embodied with so much love
for everyone."
Leila Ruhieh Ehsani, a graduate stu
dent from the Stanford Baha'i group,
commented that the whole effort to
convey the message of Gandhi's philos
ophy was wonderful.
"I loved the way in which the arts,
bhajans and dances conveyed so much
about Gandhi's life," she said.
Ehsani said that Gandhi's philoso
phy of only one religion and only one
God is very common in the Baha'i cul
ture.
"The way in which Gandhi lived up
to his words and was consistent with his
deeds is what inspires me the most
about him," she said.
