# Web search engine helps students find jobs
## 
### SOOMIN KIM STAFF WRITER 
For job-seeking Stanford stu
dents, finding access to widespread
employment listings and sending re
sumes and cover letters has become a
ritual for any internship, part-time
and full-time work. Pageßites.com, a
new Internet job search engine, how
ever, may make this process easier
and more effective than ever before.
Pageßites, a start-up company lo
cated in downtown Palo Alto, lets job
seekers search for openings and em
ployers search for resumes for free.
The site aggregates thousands of
job listings by searching major em
ployment-search engines and job
boards and posts these findings on its
Web space at no charge. Pageßites
lets employers search its vast resume
database, making the process easier
for small-scale companies.
Once a job seeker registers with
Pageßites, he or she is given space to
upload resumes. Since the resume is

entered online in HTML format,em
ployers do not need to download
cumbersome PDFs.
"I've uploaded my resume to the
site to just see how it works," said
David Menestrina, a second-year
doctoral student in computer sci
ence. "It's easy. I just cut and pasted
stuff from my old resume directly
into the page. It also makes it really
convenient to search job postings on
lots of sites at the same time."
For Stanford students, the pri
mary advantage of using Pageßites is
the resume exposure, llieir informa
tion is easily viewable for companies
in the U.S. and other countries such
as England and Japan.
Traditionally, Stanford students
have used the Cardinal Recruiting
program and Career Development
Center's (CDC) job listings, which
include major leading U.S. compa
nies that register with the CDC and
post their job openings, job lists
from other universities and the
alumni job listing database of about

8,000 openings.
The CDC's job listings, however,
do not include listings from major
job boards such as Craigslist.org,
hotjobs.yahoo.com and
jobsearch.org, all of which are in
cluded on Pageßites.
Since other job and resume search
engines like Monster.com require
employers to pay $500 per two weeks
in order to search the resumes, small
er companies that cannot afford this
price find it hard to compete. Em
ployers from any company, however,
regardless of its size or budget, can
search resumes on Pageßites, con
necting Stanford students with many
more job openings at smaller, easily
overlooked companies.
"Students generally only know
about the Goldman-Sachs and McK
insey, but not other thousands of
small firms that are eagerly seeking
to hire talented students," said Ralph
Harik, the chief executive officer of
Pageßites. "Companies are being
charged a ridiculous amount of

money to just post their job openings
and search for resumes. This should
be done better."
Although many major companies
such as Merrill Lynch, Microsoft and
Gap come to Stanford to conduct in
formation sessions and interviews as a
component of the Cardinal Recruit
ing program, a part of Cardinal Ca
reers through which students can in
terview with employers on campus, it
is not as easy for many medium and
small-sized companies to fund human
and financial resources to get in touch
with Stanford students directly.
"We are trying to reach out to the
media as much as possible to spread
the word," Harik said. "The more
companies know about our free
open job posting services, the better
it is for all the job seekers. In a small
environment where you can get
more attention and have to take on
more responsibilities, students
might be in a better setting to devel
op the necessary skills and learn
about the industry."

Since other job and resume search
engines like Monster.com require
employers to pay $500 per two weeks
in order to search the resumes, small
er companies that cannot afford this
price find it hard to compete. Em
ployers from any company, however,
regardless of its size or budget, can
search resumes on Pageßites, con
necting Stanford students with many
more job openings at smaller, easily
overlooked companies.
"Students generally only know
about the Goldman-Sachs and McK
insey, but not other thousands of
small firms that are eagerly seeking
to hire talented students," said Ralph
Harik, the chief executive officer of
Pageßites. "Companies are being
charged a ridiculous amount of

money to just post their job openings
and search for resumes. This should
be done better."
Although many major companies
such as Merrill Lynch, Microsoft and
Gap come to Stanford to conduct in
formation sessions and interviews as a
component of the Cardinal Recruit
ing program, a part of Cardinal Ca
reers through which students can in
terview with employers on campus, it
is not as easy for many medium and
small-sized companies to fund human
and financial resources to get in touch
with Stanford students directly.
"We are trying to reach out to the
media as much as possible to spread
the word," Harik said. "The more
companies know about our free
open job posting services, the better
it is for all the job seekers. In a small
environment where you can get
more attention and have to take on
more responsibilities, students
might be in a better setting to devel
op the necessary skills and learn
about the industry."
