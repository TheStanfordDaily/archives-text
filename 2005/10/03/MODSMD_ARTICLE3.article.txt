## Bike theft tops list in campus crime report 
### KAT LEWIN 
The Stanford Safety and Security Almanac,
reporting crime statistics for the years 2002-
2004. was posted on Oct. 1 on the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety's Web site. Last year,
according to the Almanac, there were 275 re
ported incidents of burglary on campus, the ma
jority of which involved bike theft.
"I heard there was a lot of bike theft," said
freshman Ilisa Nasol. "That was the rumor on
the streets."
According to Mario Banda, acting sergeant
for the Stanford Department of Public Safety,
there were 353 bikes reported stolen in 2003.
Laptop theft has also been on the rise, he said.
"The majority of laptop and bike theft could
have been prevented by locking doors or put
ting valuable items where they're not visible,"
Banda said in an interview with The Daily.
The Stanford Safety and Security Almanac
included a lengthy list of safety precautions for
students, including leaving doors and bikes
locked, ATM safety tips and steps to take when
walking around campus at night.
Apart from theft, some students said they
worry about their personal safety.
Sophomore Sarah Young said she was con
cerned over a series of break-ins last spring.
"The only thing I've ever worried about
were reports of sexual predators on campus,"
she said. "1 started locking my door at night. My
roommate used to come in late, then 1 starting
telling her to take her keys."
After the break-ins. Young's dorm worked
with the Stanford Department of Public Safety
to reassure its residents.
"Police came to talk to us," Young said.
"They were so sweet and helpful."
Dorm visits are part of the Department of
Public Safety's extensive work in community
outreach programs.
"We put extra effort into working with the
community, showing a presence and making
contact," Banda said. "We're aware if some
thing needs to be brought up. If there's a trend
in laptop theft or if there's an area where bike
theft is going on the rise, we do a lot more ef
forts by contacting either the university staff or
the community by sending out e-mails. We go
out of our way to keep in contact with the com-

mumty.
However, some students still
open themselves up to security risks.
"1 usually lock the door, but I've
left the windows open in my car,"
admitted senior Matt Woodbury.
Other students are lax about per
sonal safety because Stanford's iso
lated campus provides a sense of se
curity.
"Stanford is its own little bub
ble," said freshman Maya Lopuch."l
don't worry about outside people
coming in, and I don't worry about
the people who go here."
This is not necessarily the case
with other universities. Woodbury
transferred to Stanford from Johns
Hopkins University, a more urban
campus.
"At Johns Hopkins they made
the school a fortress," he said.
"They're a little too protective. But
at Stanford, the campus is nice; it's
safe. You can go downtown when it's
dark."
Senior Philip Boone, who trans
ferred from the University of Vir
ginia, agreed. According to Boone,
at his former school, female students
are not allowed to live on the first
floor of any dorm. At Stanford, on
the other hand, he feels more secure.
"My number one concern is get
ting my bike stolen, and when that's
the worst, you're okay," he said.

Another difference Boone noted
was that, unlike at the University of
Virginia, "party security at Stanford
is intense."

Students who want to drink at
University-sponsored parties are re
quired to wear wristbands to show
they are of legal age. Police cars also
patrol the Row on weekends when
parties are taking place. In spite of
this, there were only 47 alcohol-re
lated arrests in 2004, down from 79
the previous year.
Banda suggested this is due to the
new policy banning alcohol in dorms
where the majority of residents are
freshmen. Also, the Department of
Public Safety's stance on underage
drinking is lenient, Banda said.
"We're not the party police," he
said. "We reach out with our pro
grams to discuss party issues. Our re
sponsibility to the citizens is to make
sure they have a good party, but that
preventative safety measures are in
practice. We don't enforce the alco
hol policy because those are Univer
sity rules."
Banda explained that the campus
police are present to maintain stu
dent safety, not monitor their alco
hol consumption.
"The majority of the time, patrol
cars are for student safety," he said.

"The department's biggest concern
is to make contact with the people
who are hosting the party, let them
know we're there to help them in
any way if they're having a problem
with anyone."
The Stanford Safety and Security
Almanac also urged students to
maintain the safety of their resi
dences by keeping an eye out for
possible intruders.
"It seems like the students are
very responsible about dorm securi
ty," said freshman Michael Simpson,
after visiting several dorms. "The
students are as good as formal secu
rity measures."
Other students seemed generally
unconcerned.
"1 don't really worry about it,"
Young said. "I always walk with
someone else around 8:30 or 9 p.m.
at night, but I don't need it to be
some huge dude. 1 feel safe when I'm
with friends."

curity Almanac is published on the
