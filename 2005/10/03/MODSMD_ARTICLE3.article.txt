The Stanford Safety and Security Almanac,
reporting crime statistics for the years 2002-
2004. was posted on Oct. 1 on the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety's Web site. Last year,
according to the Almanac, there were 275 re
ported incidents of burglary on campus, the ma

"I heard there was a lot of bike theft," said
freshman Ilisa Nasol. "That was the rumor on

According to Mario Banda, acting sergeant
for the Stanford Department of Public Safety,

she said. "1 started locking my door at night. My

to reassure its residents.
"Police came to talk to us," Young said.
"They were so sweet and helpful."
Dorm visits are part of the Department of
Public Safety's extensive work in community

"We put extra effort into working with the
community, showing a presence and making
contact," Banda said. "We're aware if some
thing needs to be brought up. If there's a trend
in laptop theft or if there's an area where bike
