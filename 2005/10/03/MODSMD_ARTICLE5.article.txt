# JAG recruiters descend on Law School
## 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Navy Judge Advocate General Corps
will be interviewing students at the Law
School today amid a fog of controversy due to
a philosophical difference between the stu
dents and faculty at the Law School and the
United States Military.
The Law School — which has a non-dis
crimination policy — includes the Navy JAG
Corps in its on-campus interview program re
luctantly, according to Law School Dean
Larry Kramer in a statement issued last week,
because the military openly discriminates

against lesbians, gays and bisexuals.
However, due to a federal statute known as
the Solomon Amendment, which was enacted
by Congress in 1994 and cuts off federal fund
ing to any educational institution that "pro
hibits or in effect prevents" military recruit
ing, the Law School must allow the Navy re
cruiters on campus. Otherwise, the University
might lose critical financial resources for re
search and other university programming in
all schools campus wide.
Some students, including members of the
Stanford Law School OUTLAW group, have
asked the University to protest the Solomon
Amendment by excluding any group affiliat-

Ed with the military from the interview pro
gram. However, if the Law School were to
prohibit the Navy JAG Corps recruiters on
campus, it would risk losing federal funding
not only for the Law School but also for the
entire University — a risk administrators
have made it clear they are not willing to take.
Prior to this year, the Law School was able
to avoid the conflict between its commitment
to non-discrimination and the military's
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy because of a
"student interest" requirement that prevents
employers who have failed to meet a defined
minimum level of student interest
from participating in the on-campus
interview program.
Until this year, the military had
failed to meet that level of student in
terest, but this fall, enough students
expressed a desire to speak to the
Navy JAG Corps to meet the thresh
old, thus forcing the Law School to
allow the military on campus.
The Navy JAG Corps visit comes
soon before a scheduled Dec. 6
Supreme Court hearing that will

challenge the validity of the Solomon
Amendment in FAIR v. Rumsfeld.
Students, meanwhile, have mixed
feelings about the military's visit to
campus. While some care passionately
about the issue, others are apathetic.
Sophomore Josh Dell, a member
of the Stanford Democrats, said that
he was hesitant to come down on one
side of the fence or the other.
"If the students show enough in
terest, I think military recruiters
should be allowed on campus," he
said. "While I don't support the mili
tary's discrimination against gays
and lesbians, I don't think that
should preclude them from inter
viewing students who have ex
pressed interest in the military."

Sophomore Matt Brookby, a
member of the Stanford Republi
cans, had a similar stance on the issue.
"Joining the military is not manda
tory; it is totally optional," he said. "So
if there are enough students who want
more information, then why should
we prevent them from getting it?"
Even some members of
LGBT*casa took a stance in the mid
dle ground, saying that the military
shouldn't be excluded from campus
Amber Baysinger, a sophomore
and member of the LGBT, said that
she opposes the military's "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" policy, but that stu
dents who feel the same way she
does should just ignore the inter
viewers during their visit to campus.

"I don't like the idea of the mili
tary being on campus, but I also don't
think we should exclude them from
campus because of a philosophical
difference," she said. "If you don't
want to speak to them, don't. It's not
like everyone has to talk to them."
There are some students, howev
er, that are vehemently opposed to
the Navy JAG Corps coming to Stan
ford, and members of the Law
School's OUTLAW group are plan
ning an 11:30 a.m. protest in Cooley
Courtyard, outside of the military re
cruiters' interview room.
None of the Law School faculty
members contacted by press time
were able to provide information for
this article.
