## Student suicides increase University tries to investigate the sudden jump in campus suicides 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The sun is always shining and stu
dents are always smiling — this was
the likely rationale for the Princeton
Review's designation of Stanford as
the university with the "Happiest Stu
dents." Unfortunately, a recent string
of student suicides — three between
May and August — suggests that all
may not be so well under the surface.
Meanwhile, the administration is
taking notice. On Oct. 12. Stanford
will be participating in a national on
line "webinar" on best practices for
reducing suicide among college stu
dents. This professional development
activity will focus on critical policy
and law issues associate with college
student suicide.
The issue was touched on by Dean
of Student Affairs Greg Boardman at
Row Manager training and also by
some students during resident assis
tant training at the end of the summer.
Local newspapers have also picked
up the stories.
"Continually addressing and im
plementing how best to reduce col
lege student suicide is a priority for
the dean of student affairs division,"
Boardman said in an interview with
The Daily.
Part of the problem in analyzing
student suicide cases is a lack of infor
mation. The cause of death is often
unknown or kept within a family. Ale
jandro Martinez, director of Stan
ford s Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), said he rarely has
official information to confirm a sui
cide.
"Families don't often disclose
what has happened to students when
they die." he said in an interview with
The Daily when asked about the
three recent cases. "I had the same
impression as you. but 1 don't have
the facts."
There are also few patterns for the
administration to point to. Martinez
has worked at Stanford for over 25
years and recalls going a year or two
without any cases, and then the rela
tive anomaly present by the five
months this year, which saw three stu
dents take their lives in May, July and
August.
Martinez also cited a study of the
Big 10 schools, which found the ap
proximate suicide rates for college
campuses to be between one and
seven annual suicides for every 10,000
students.
"I am guessing we fall within that
norm," Martinez said.
