# Cat Network educates students about pitfalls of pet ownership
## SCN cautions students about adopting and abandoning animals on campus 
### ZEWDE YERASWORK STAFF WRITER 
In 1989 there were about 500 stray cats
roaming Stanford's campus. Today there
are only 50.
The gradual decrease and stabilization
of the cat population at Stanford is primari

ly a result of the creation of the Stanford
Cat Network (SCN) 16 years ago.
The organization emerged in January of
1989 in response to the University's deci
sion to trap and remove the cats on campus.
Fearing that many of the animals were feral
and not viable for adoption, the SCN of
fered what it saw as a humane alternative to
the likely euthanasia of the strays.
As a substitute, SCN began providing
spaying and neutering services, vaccination,
consistent food and adoption of tame cats
and kittens.
Known as TYap-Neuter-Return (TNR),

this alternative was offered by SCN
through an agreement with the University
as a way to manage the population of cam
pus strays.
Beyond the actual process of handling
the animals, the organization attempts to
"promote community awareness of the re
sponsible care and treatment of animals."
The Network also claims to have "a
long-term commitment to the health and
well-being of homeless cats on the Stanford
University Campus," according to SCN's
Web site. Today, other campuses have
begun similar programs, though Stanford

students began the national trend.
Co-founder and Feeding and Trapping
coordinator Carole Miller explained.
"Homeless cats are a diverse population
comprised of lost or abandoned tame strays
and their feral offspring. It is the population
from which we adopt most of our pet cats
and to which we recycle them through igno
rance, neglect, irresponsibility and especial
ly failure to spay or neuter them."
Perhaps the most relevant human short
coming for the SCN is the irresponsibility of
some pet-owning students.
"We adopt more than a dozen
new cats each year, many of them lost
or abandoned by students," Miller
said. "It is a concern on residential
campuses nationwide and beyond."
Tlie SCN recently sent an e-mail
on many dorm chat lists about how
many students, though tempted to
take in strays, are not responsible
enough to be full-time pet owners.
That message, which has circulated
widely in recent weeks, implores stu
dents, "don't adopt" when school
starts and "don't abandon" cats at
the end of the school year.
An adoption coordinator for the
Network and one of its six founders,
Christina Peck insists "we need to
get the message out about not adopt
ing or abandoning pets on campus."
She said in an interview with The
Daily that there have been "quite a
few lost or abandoned cats recently."
Both coordinators see this as the
reason fora recent push for more
volunteers, despite the reduction of
the cat population over the last sev
eral years.
"We need more volunteers to
help feed the cats on campus and to
foster our rescued kittens and cats,"
Peck said.
One sophomore, who asked to
remain anonymous, brought a cat to
his dorm room this year, though he
insisted that he is a responsible and
loving pet owner, who could not
stand being separated from his "best
friend.?
"I didn't adopt, and I won't aban
don," he said having read the circu
lating SCN message. "Maybe there
are some students on campus who
need to be reminded of their re
sponsibilities, but I am not one of
them."
Pointing out that the issue goes
beyond the population of stray cats.
Miller said that for students who
adopt other types of animals, some
end up leaving them in dorm rooms
at the close of school in hopes that
housekeeping will find them.
"The University has tried to ad
dress this, but more humane educa
tion is needed as part of the Stanford
experience," Miller explained.
One anonymous senior ex
plained her reasons for keeping
pets, specifically rats, in her dorm
room as a way to stave off loneliness.
On the issue of responsibility, she
said, "they're pretty easy to care of.
They just need food, water and
cleaning their cage once or twice a
week."
Though some of the interests of
pet owners may conflict with some
of the interests of SCN operators,
neither had any complaints against
University policy, which prohibits
keeping pets of any kind in or
around University residences. Vio
lators of this rule face a $100 per day
fine until the pet is removed, plus
cleaning fees if necessary, and a pos
sible loss of housing privileges.
Meanwhile, as the "TYap-Neuter-
Return" option continues to expand
to other campuses. Miller, among
other colleagues, warned that now is
the time to be "ever more vigilant,"
as the population of strays is shrink
ing, but the number of abandoned
and lost cats may be on its way up.
