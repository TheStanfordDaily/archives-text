# Cat Network educates students about pitfalls of pet ownership
## SCN cautions students about adopting and abandoning animals on campus

In 1989 there were about 500 stray cats
roaming Stanford's campus. Today there
are only 50.
The gradual decrease and stabilization
of the cat population at Stanford is primari

ly a result of the creation of the Stanford
Cat Network (SCN) 16 years ago.
The organization emerged in January of
1989 in response to the University's deci
sion to trap and remove the cats on campus.
Fearing that many of the animals were feral
and not viable for adoption, the SCN of
fered what it saw as a humane alternative to
the likely euthanasia of the strays.
As a substitute, SCN began providing
spaying and neutering services, vaccination,
consistent food and adoption of tame cats
and kittens.
Known as TYap-Neuter-Return (TNR),

this alternative was offered by SCN
through an agreement with the University
as a way to manage the population of cam
pus strays.
Beyond the actual process of handling
the animals, the organization attempts to
"promote community awareness of the re
sponsible care and treatment of animals."
The Network also claims to have "a
long-term commitment to the health and
well-being of homeless cats on the Stanford
University Campus," according to SCN's
Web site. Today, other campuses have
begun similar programs, though Stanford

students began the national trend.
Co-founder and Feeding and Trapping
coordinator Carole Miller explained.
"Homeless cats are a diverse population
comprised of lost or abandoned tame strays
and their feral offspring. It is the population
from which we adopt most of our pet cats
and to which we recycle them through igno
rance, neglect, irresponsibility and especial
ly failure to spay or neuter them."
Perhaps the most relevant human short
coming for the SCN is the irresponsibility of
