## Indonesia on high alert as bombers strike 
### CHRIS BRUMMITT ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BALI, Indonesia (AP) â€” Police raised the alert level
for Indonesia's capital and the president warned of more
attacks yesterday as a chilling video shot the day before
showed a suspected bomber clutching a backpack and
strolling past diners moments before one of three suicide
bombings killed 26 people on Bali.
The near-simultaneous bombings on the resort is
land also injured 101 people, including six Americans.
The attacks apparently were planned by Southeast
Asia's two most-wanted men, who are believed to be
connected to the al-Qaida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah,
said Maj. Gen. Ansyaad Mbai, a top Indonesian anti
terror official.
Fear of more attacks on tourists prompted Israel
to warn its citizens Sunday not to travel to Egypt's
Sinai desert during the upcoming month of Jewish
holidays, saying it has information that Arab mili
tants planning strikes against Israelis already are lo
cated in the resort area.
The alleged masterminds of the Bali attacks were
believed to be Azahari bin Husin and Noordin Mo
hamed Top, both Malaysians who fled to Indonesia
after a crackdown on militants following the Sept. 11
attacks, officials said.
The masterminds were not among the suspected
bombers, whose remains were found at the scenes, offi
cials said. All three bombers were believed to be wear
ing belts of explosives, police said.
Mbai said at least three other people were believed
to be involved in the operation, and suspected they
were still on Bali. He did not say whether they includ
ed the two Malaysian fugitives.
Mbai also said police believe the bombs were deto
nated by mobile phone.
Authorities have enlisted the help Nasir Abbas, a for
mer Jemaah Islamiyah operative working as an inform
ant, to help in the investigation. Abbas arrived on Bali

two hours after the blasts, but it was unclear whether he
had concluded a deal with police.
"Police are using him to help find which group is be
hind this operation, former terrorists can help give de
tails," Mbai told The Associated Press.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono warned that
terrorists could be planning more strikes in the world's
most populous Muslim nation as Jakarta's police chief
put the capital on top alert, with two-thirds of its police
force on standby.
"The terrorists are still looking for soft targets,"
Yudhoyono said at a news conference after viewing the
devastation.
Western and Indonesian intelligence agencies have
warned repeatedly that Jemaah Islamiyah was plotting
more attacks despite a string of arrests.
Last month, Yudhoyono said the extremist network
might strike Jakarta during September or October. He
explained Saturday that his warning was based on in

telligence the terrorists had already prepared the ex
plosives.
There were no claims of responsibility for Satur
day night's coordinated attacks on two packed
seafood cafes in the Jimbaran beach resort and the
Raja Cafe noodle and steakhouse in the bustling
tourist center of Kuta.
Video shot by a vacationer at the three-story Raja
Cafe captured a suspected bomber in a black T-shirt
walking past foreign and local tourists eating dinner,
sipping drinks and chatting at candlelit tables.
The man clutches his backpack, adjusts it slightly,
then walks out of view. Moments later there is an ex
plosion from his direction, followed by gray smoke
and terrified screams. Police said the video, obtained
by Associated Press Television News, was part of the
investigation.
Like 2002, the bombings took place on the busiest
night of the week, just as crowds began to swell.
