## Practice safe password habits: use two to be sure 
### ERIC FORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
AIM viruses, spyware and hard-drive
crashes top many people's list of computer
woes. Yet, regrettably, these techie-night
mares are not the only possible computa
tional disasters.
While Stanford students have the bene
fit of a campus-wide security network that
guards them against the latest hacks and
malicious codes, a final piece of the puzzle
still remains to fully secure a machine â€”
password protection. Unfortunately, this
missing link also happens to be the most
overlooked aspect of computer security.
Passwords serve as the last bastion of de
fense in an increasingly hostile online
world, but for some students, computer and
Internet passwords are more of an incon
venience than anything else.
"Passwords are a hassle," says Laura
Sweeney, a junior at Virginia Tech. "I tell
my computer to store all my passwords for
me because I don't like putting them in
every time."
Current versions of popular internet
browsers such as Mozilla's Firefox have a
feature that allow users to automatically
store passwords within the browser so they
don't have to enter them repeatedly.
"I just have [Firefox] fill in as many
passwords as possible," Laura explains.
Features such as Firefox's auto-pass
word, which fills in one's password from
the start, do add a great deal convenience,
but their gift of expediency can come at the
expense of security if an unauthorized user
gains access to someone else's machine.
So although viruses. Spy-ware and other
similar hacks enjoy the spotlight in the se
curity world, the potential threat of pass
word hacking has never gone away and
should not be taken lightly. In fact, as the
general public gains access to more power
ful computers, the chance of having one's
password hacked are on the rise.
When a password is first created on a
computer, it is run through a security algo
rithm; the algorithm then generates a
unique value called a "hash," which corre
sponds to the password that is created.
These security algorithms have built-in,
fail-safe devices to ensure that no two pass
words will ever result in the creation of the
same hash. When someone enters a pass
word into a computer, the password is con
verted into a hash to see if it matches the
one currently stored on the computer. This
is known as password verification.
Still, it is possible fora password to be
broken by running the system through a
method known as a "brute-force attack."
This occurs when the user trying to break
into the system runs a set of scripts and al
gorithms that attempt to try every possible
combination of hash values until he or she
comes upon the victim's exact password.
The easiest way to guard oneself against a
brute-force attack is to periodically
change passwords and to practice good
password habits.
According to Surajit Bose, cluster oper
ations manager at Residential Computing,
the easiest way to prevent sensitive ac
counts from being accessed by unautho
rized sources is to keep multiple passwords
for different Web sites.
"In general, passwords to secure sites
(such as bank logins) should be different
than [passwords for] other, not-so-impor
tant Web sites that also require registra
tion," Bose says.
Web sites that protect sensitive infor
mation such as credit card accounts incor
porate security measures that make it dif
ficult for passwords to be intercepted and
understood. However, other Web sites
that offer access simply through requiring
a login, such as a small message board or a
news site, may not include such precau
tions. This usually means that when people
send in login and password information,
the data is traveling over the Internet in a
format that can be easily read and
tracked. Hence, it is important to use dif
ferent passwords based on sensitivity of
the information being protected, in case
the password to your favorite chat room is
ever sniffed out.
"Ideally, you should have two separate
security passwords, one for Stanford and
one for other secure sites," Bose advises.
In order to guard against password
theft, most major corporations force their
employees to change their passwords after
a certain period of time. According to
David Hoffman, manager of Information
Security Services at the University's Inter
nal Audit Department, Stanford does not
have such a policy in place for the student
community. Regardless, Hoffman still rec
ommends that students change their
SUNet passwords on occasion.
"A good rule of thumb is when you
change your clock,change your password."
he says.
With daylight savings time ending in
October, isn't it about time you changed
your password?
