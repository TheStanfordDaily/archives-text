# State of the WIRELESS UNION
## Wireless goes a-wanting on West Campus 
### SAGAR BAPAT 
As I walked into Roble Hall nearly two weeks
ago, I expected to be able to access wireless Inter
net from my room on the first floor.
To my dismay, my expectations were not in
sync with reality. My newly purchased Power
book did not receive even one bar of signal.
Since the creation of wireless local access net
works (WLAN) in the late 19905, wireless has
been installed in all major universities, airports
and other prominent public places, and has since
grown into a $1.6 billio industry.
Given the increasing importance of wireless
in everyday life, I wondered if my fellow Stanford
students were experiencing similar wireless
problems and what their reactions might be.
Walking around campus and talking to various
Residential Computing Coordinators (RCCs), I
tried to assess the state of the wireless phenome
non at Stanford. Do students actually use wire
less in their dorms? Do they even use it during
class? For what purpose?
As it turns out. Stanford has very good wire
less service in all academic buildings, but the sig
nals are either spotty or nonexistent in and near

many dorms.
Ram Guerra, an RCC in West Lagunita, says,
"West Lag is one of the few places on campus
that does not have an official Stanford wireless
[connection]."
Lack of wireless service is a big disappoint
ment for freshman. Jenny Arriola who lives in
Eucalipto.
"It really isn't fair that we don't have wireless,"
Arriola says. "Aren't the mini-doubles bad
enough? Had I known that this is what I was going
to expect from Stanford, I would have made sure
not to buy a brand-new expensive laptop."
Governor's Corner does not receive official
Stanford wireless either, but many students who
live there buy their own wireless access points.
"We bought a wireless router which I have set up
myself," says junior Alicia Chen, an RCC in
EAST House.
But student-bought wireless routers do not
provide access to entire residence halls, nor do
they have the ability to carry a high load of wire
less activity.
Chen, who is majoring in computer science,
adds,"The signal is weaker in some corners [of the
house], to the extent that people with weak wire

less cards (like myself) cannot use the wireless."
However, most other residences, including
Branner, Florence Moore and Freshman/Sopho
more College, have very good wireless access.
"There's fantastic reception [in Branner],"
says junior Matt Thomas Smith, a junior and
RCC in Branner. "It's one of the best dorms for
wireless access, actually, with wireless hubs on
each floor and hall, in addition to hubs placed
close to the lawn so Brannerites can access the in
ternet from outside."
All this wireless begs the question: What do
students really do with wireless? Richard Norte,
a junior majoring in physics, says,"I mainly use
it when I take my computer with me to the li
brary to study."
Some students, on the other hand, say they
take their laptops with them to class to pass the
time playing games or to proactively research in
formation that the professor is discussing.
"People do a lot of things with their laptops in
class," says senior Brian Chang. "Most use it for
academic purposes, but a few use it to play poker
or chat [online]."
