# Free pizza is just a filter away

Anyone who has returned from a vaca
tion knows the horror of a swamped
inhox. Irrelevant dorm announce
ments, requests for lofting tools and the occa
sional Nigerian pyramid scheme crowd out
the important stuff — like class assignments
and messages from friends and family
Instead of wading through hundreds of
announcements only to miss a critical e-mail
from your girlfriend (whoops!), your com
puter can sort your mail for you.
In this week's column we'll look at using
folders and filters to organize your incom
ing mail.
How It Works
When you scan through your inbox,you are
subconsciously following rules to figure out
how to react to each e-mail. For example,
you might always open e-mail from your
mother right away but habitually cast aside
e-mail from your dorm list until later.
Almost all e-mail programs today allow
you to create "rules" or "filters" to do the
same thing automatically. Here is how they
work: Each e-mail has its own header, which
includes information about where the mes
sages came from, where they are going and
what the subject is. These are often dis
played as "To," "From," "Cc" and "Subject."
With filters, you tell your computer what
to look for and it then picks out messages
and automatically sorts them in some way.
This can be any variety of methods, from
moving e-mails to a special folder to flag
ging them, trashing them or even playing a
sound for certain messages.

Make it Happen
To automatically sort e-mail from your
dorm list to its own folder, create a rule that
looks in the "To" or "Cc" field for the words
"chat-kimball-2005" (or whatever your
dorm list may he).
Of the different methods to check your
e-mail (see my column from The Daily's
Orientation issue), stand-alone clients offer
the most flexibility in implementing filters.
Conversely. Webmail only allows for basic
filtering.
In this column I always recommend that
PC and Linux users get Mozilla Thunder
bird for their mail (freely available at
http://mozilla.org), and that Mac owners use
Mail.app which already comes free on their
computers. Both programs offer consider
able options for filtering.
In Thunderbird go to "Tools" and then
"Message Filters" and click "New." Or, right
click on a blue hyperlinked e-mail address
and click "Create Filter from Message."
Then, chose one or more actions from the
list displayed.
In Mail.app. go to "Mail." choose "Pref

erences," click on the "Rules" tab and click
"New Rule."
Those who are still using Webmail can
refer to Stanford's filtering help for more in
formation at http://www.stanford.edu/serv
ices/webmail/spamfilter.html
Outlook Express users can go to "Tools,"
choose "Message Rules," go to "Mail" and
click "New." Then, follow the prompts.
Don't Forget Folders
A good filtering system needs folders.
You can create as few or as many folders you
like. In most e-mail programs go to "File,"
the "New" the "Folder" or "Message." Then,
choose "New" in Mail.app. I try to have a few
meta-folders — one for classes, one for per
sonal stuff and one for extracurriculars. At
the beginning of each quarter I filter for
classes and mailing lists and sort them into
their respective locations.
Filter Fun
Each person's filter is a reflection of his or
her own lifestyle and priorities. With time,you
can create an elaborate system of overlapping
filters to satisfy your most eccentric needs. My
roommate, for example, grew tired of missing
announcements about free food from the
dorm list. By the time he checked his mail and
learned of the free pizza down the hall, it
would already be long gone. To guard against
future lapses in food-awareness, he created a
special filter to automatically play a loud
sound anytime an e-mail message arrived
with the words "Free food" or "pizza." This

pizza warning system was a success and our
tummies have been happier ever since.
No More Spam
The best e-mail programs include built-in
filters for junk mail. Both Mozilla Thunder
bird and Mail.app allow you to mark a mes
sage as "Junk." These programs will then
learn to identify junk mail over time based
on your input using a statistical technique
called Bayesian-inference. I've found these
to be the most effective free filtering systems
on the market today. Teaching them takes
only a few weeks and almost no effort. To
turn on junk-mail controls in Thunderbird,
go to "Tools" and then to "Junk Mail Con
trols." In Mail.app, go to "Mail" and then to
"Preferences." Click the "Junk Mail Tab"
and check "Enable Junk Mail Filtering."
Stanford tries to help you out by flagging
what it thinks looks like junk. When Stan
ford's servers find junk e-mail, they place
the word "SPAM" in front of the subject,
which you can then easily filter. Be fore
warned, Stanford's system isn't perfect. Too
often, Stanford thinks valid mail is spam.
Your best bet is to use a program that learns
like Thunderbird or Mail.app.
So the next time your inbox is overflow
ing with mail from the dorm-list, take five
minutes and set up a filter. It will save you
time and help you keep track of what's real
ly important.

The best e-mail programs include built-in
filters for junk mail. Both Mozilla Thunder
bird and Mail.app allow you to mark a mes
sage as "Junk." These programs will then
learn to identify junk mail over time based
on your input using a statistical technique
called Bayesian-inference. I've found these
to be the most effective free filtering systems
on the market today. Teaching them takes
only a few weeks and almost no effort. To
turn on junk-mail controls in Thunderbird,
go to "Tools" and then to "Junk Mail Con
trols." In Mail.app, go to "Mail" and then to
"Preferences." Click the "Junk Mail Tab"
and check "Enable Junk Mail Filtering."
Stanford tries to help you out by flagging
what it thinks looks like junk. When Stan
ford's servers find junk e-mail, they place
the word "SPAM" in front of the subject,
which you can then easily filter. Be fore
warned, Stanford's system isn't perfect. Too
often, Stanford thinks valid mail is spam.
Your best bet is to use a program that learns
like Thunderbird or Mail.app.
So the next time your inbox is overflow
ing with mail from the dorm-list, take five
minutes and set up a filter. It will save you
time and help you keep track of what's real
ly important.

Anyone who has returned from a vaca
tion knows the horror of a swamped
inhox. Irrelevant dorm announce
ments, requests for lofting tools and the occa
sional Nigerian pyramid scheme crowd out
the important stuff — like class assignments
and messages from friends and family
Instead of wading through hundreds of
announcements only to miss a critical e-mail
from your girlfriend (whoops!), your com
puter can sort your mail for you.
In this week's column we'll look at using
folders and filters to organize your incom
ing mail.
How It Works
When you scan through your inbox,you are
subconsciously following rules to figure out
how to react to each e-mail. For example,
you might always open e-mail from your
mother right away but habitually cast aside
e-mail from your dorm list until later.
Almost all e-mail programs today allow
you to create "rules" or "filters" to do the
same thing automatically. Here is how they
work: Each e-mail has its own header, which
includes information about where the mes
sages came from, where they are going and
what the subject is. These are often dis
played as "To," "From," "Cc" and "Subject."
With filters, you tell your computer what
to look for and it then picks out messages
and automatically sorts them in some way.
This can be any variety of methods, from
moving e-mails to a special folder to flag
ging them, trashing them or even playing a
sound for certain messages.

Make it Happen
To automatically sort e-mail from your
dorm list to its own folder, create a rule that
looks in the "To" or "Cc" field for the words
"chat-kimball-2005" (or whatever your
dorm list may he).
Of the different methods to check your
e-mail (see my column from The Daily's
Orientation issue), stand-alone clients offer
the most flexibility in implementing filters.
Conversely. Webmail only allows for basic
filtering.
In this column I always recommend that
PC and Linux users get Mozilla Thunder
bird for their mail (freely available at
http://mozilla.org), and that Mac owners use
Mail.app which already comes free on their
computers. Both programs offer consider
able options for filtering.
In Thunderbird go to "Tools" and then
"Message Filters" and click "New." Or, right
click on a blue hyperlinked e-mail address
and click "Create Filter from Message."
Then, chose one or more actions from the
list displayed.
In Mail.app. go to "Mail." choose "Pref

erences," click on the "Rules" tab and click
"New Rule."
Those who are still using Webmail can
refer to Stanford's filtering help for more in
formation at http://www.stanford.edu/serv
ices/webmail/spamfilter.html
Outlook Express users can go to "Tools,"
choose "Message Rules," go to "Mail" and
click "New." Then, follow the prompts.
Don't Forget Folders
A good filtering system needs folders.
You can create as few or as many folders you
like. In most e-mail programs go to "File,"
the "New" the "Folder" or "Message." Then,
choose "New" in Mail.app. I try to have a few
meta-folders — one for classes, one for per
sonal stuff and one for extracurriculars. At
the beginning of each quarter I filter for
classes and mailing lists and sort them into
their respective locations.
Filter Fun
Each person's filter is a reflection of his or
her own lifestyle and priorities. With time,you
can create an elaborate system of overlapping
filters to satisfy your most eccentric needs. My
roommate, for example, grew tired of missing
announcements about free food from the
dorm list. By the time he checked his mail and
learned of the free pizza down the hall, it
would already be long gone. To guard against
future lapses in food-awareness, he created a
special filter to automatically play a loud
sound anytime an e-mail message arrived
with the words "Free food" or "pizza." This

pizza warning system was a success and our
tummies have been happier ever since.
