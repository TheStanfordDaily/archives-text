## BLACKMAN'S BACK Senior social suppositions 
### 
As a senior, I've developed a number of
theories about life at Stanford and I
will share them with you here.
Dating Theory #1 (modified): Stanford
guys are delusional. Most males on campus
will tell you that Stanford girls are unattrac
tive. These people, me included, are idiots.
We expect females to look and sound like
Marissa Cooper. In the reality distortion
field that surrounds Stanford University (on
loan from Steve Jobs), we forget that these
are the same girls we competed with back
home for valedictorian.The ones we thought
were amazing because they had both breasts
and a command of Russian literature. When
we show up at Stanford, the dissonance is ir
reconcilable. Being the dorks we refuse to
admit we are, we come up with bizarre ra
tionalizations— such as the author's own
original Dating Theory #1, affectionately
called "the ladder theory," in which it is
taken as fact that the hottest males at Stan
ford are hotter than the hottest females (find
me when I'm drunk and I can explain this
with hand motions and bar graphs).
Friendship Theory #1: We are all broken.
Dating Theory #2, Oh god, we are all so hor
ribly broken. Stanford is like a eugenics ex
periment gone horribly wrong. It is what
happens when you take 6,400 kids who spent
their childhoods being overachievers —
kids who were told they'd grow up to be
nothing less than the President — and add
the expectation of being well-adjusted. We
were never well-adjusted. We are all still
competing to be the teacher's pet, because
most of us were, but now we can't admit it.
This new pressure manifests itself in odd
ways, such as an inability for Stanford stu
dents to form meaningful friendships.
Friendship Theory #2: We don't see each
other enough. We learned how to have
friends in high school, when we had manda
tory daily base exposure to each other — in
classes, in the halls and in our innumerable
extracurriculars. That was the basis of the
friendship, everything else was extra. We did
n't need to constantly catch up on what was
happening in each others' lives because we
saw it happening. Here at Stanford, our only
close friends are those who live near us, be
cause they are the people we can have high
schoolesque relationships with. We don't
need to rush in between classes to have meals
with our housemates to catch up on major
events. There is no catching up; there's just
friendship.

Social Theory #1: We don't know what
we're doing. Stanford gives us nerds a clean
slate, upon which we attempt to make a
photographic copy of the high school world
we left behind — but we end up with a sur
realist vision where the actors don't know
their roles and motivations. We know no
other social order, so we recreate it in our
own horribly twisted way. We end up with
CS nerds who drink too much and sorority
girls who are afraid to talk about how much
they love sci-fi. We leave out the undesir
able elements, the punks and the goths, and
marginalize the interesting people into co
ops. because these people discolor the
black-and-white everyone-is-happy Brave-
New-World of Stanford.
Social Corollary #1: We don't know how
to he chill. We're a special breed of "the best
and the brightest," the ones who won our
spot at the chill near-Ivy by being neurotic
and high-strung. We hoped to learn how to
relax,but forgot that the people teaching it to
us would be ourselves.
Dating Theory #3, Stanford is a wasteland.
The prospective freshman asks, "Where is
the student union on campus?"The Stanford
student answers, "What's that?" Exactly.
Iliere is no social place on campus at night.
Late Nite dining doesn't count because it
smells like an interstate truck stop and is lo
cated in dining halls. The CoHo almost
counts, but requires fighting with people who
came there to study, and is so small and clos
es so early that it misses the mark.
Dating Corollary #1, Palo Alto is also a
wasteland. As a freshman you can't have a
car. As a sophomore you realize that having a
car is worthless because everything in Palo
Alto closes at 10 p.m. anyway, with the excep
tion of Safeway.The town (barely even that;
it's five blocks long) is expensive and lacks
anything approaching a student-friendly
hangout. In conclusion, there is nowhere to
go on dates, so no one dates. Let me explain
how normal human beings go about dating.
Two people meet, one asks the other out,
they go out, they decide if they wish to do this
again. If so, they do so; if not, they never see
each other again.This is hard when you can't
leave campus, made worse because there's
no real point to leaving, and completely im
possible when you need to see the person
every day in your dorm.
Party Theory #1: The University is a pur-
