## JAG debate indicates civil rights struggles continue 
### MAHBOD MOGHADAM 
The battle is over; "The Man" has won.
Yesterday, recruiters for the Navy Judge Ad
vocate General's Corp. visited Stanford Law
School's Office of Career Services in order
to interview six homosexuals who wouldn't
work for the military's paltry five-figure
salary even if the Defense Department did
allow it. Seem paradoxical? Republicans
have fought for eight years to interview
these homosexuals — implanting row after
row of teeth in the unloved (and probably
unconstitutional) 1994 Solomon Amend
ment — all as part of an effort to revitalize
the relationship between the military and ac
ademia. Vinegar, it seems, just doesn't attract
bees the way it used to.
Law school homosexuals, while irate
about JAG recruitment flying in the face of
the Law School's non-discrimination policy,
seemed excited to plan a protest. Stanford
has not had JAG recruiters since 2002. Hven
then, the recruiters did not get full access to
Career Services' facilities like they did yes
terday. OUTLAW, the law school's gay-and
lesbian organization, greeted the recruiters
with an information table, camouflage, pur
ple buttons and a roster of pre-emptive gay
law students to interview.
What brings JAG back after so long? Ihe
Law School's former dean. Kathleen Sulli
van, gave a talk to incoming students some
weeks ago, in which she stated that the Law
School has not had to deal with JAG re
cruiters because of insufficient student inter
est; at least five students have to request in
formation about an employer before inter
views are set up. It seems that five students
— possibly inspired by Sullivan's comments
at the talk — made the requisite inquiries
this fall, finally getting JAG onto campus.
Law students are not by any means unan
imously supportive of OUTLAW and
today's protests. Some law students that
have served in the military argue that the
military's de facto treatment of homosexuals
is improving over time. (Apparently, the mil
itary abounds with homosexuals in active
service. A friend reported to me that "You
get more [action) in the Army than in West
Hollywood ") Furthermore, some feel that
re-establishing a good relationship between
the military and academia, especially in our
post-September-11th world, is a concern
that outweighs otherwise-justified worries
over discrimination. A broader category of
law students, who are against discrimination,

nevertheless find OUTLAW'S antics to be
immature. Why not just let the JAG re
cruiters do their job and give information to
interested students?
I find all three objections to be reasoned
and rational. Indeed. I tend to agree. But
what if the military — or any employer —
made it official policy to discriminate against
Jews? As a Jew. my rationality would fly out
the window. I would not even know how to
respond: My whole life, I have been in the
habit of screaming anti-Semite at the slight
est insinuation of discriminatory feelings.
Thankfully, scraps are all I've ever had to
fight over; in major universities in the 21st
century, struggles over civil rights generally
make up our history lessons — only the ves
tigial structure of discrimination against ho
mosexuals is still standing. To call gay rights
the civil rights struggle of our generation is a
misnomer; it is actually a throwback to a
broader series of struggles that reasonable
people already agreed on a generation ago.
What makes the longevity of anti-gay dis
crimination so hard to understand is the triv
iality of the characteristic of being discrimi
nated against. Being a Jew is much worse
than being gay — you say prayers, you have
a Bar Mitzvah, you might even wear a funny
hat. I lomosexuality isn't a race, it isn't a reli
gion, and — in spite of the übiquitous pop
culture portrayal of the limp-wristed queer
it is not a lifestyle. I lomosexuality is noth
ing more than a bedroom preference. Some
people like a good toe-suck, others like a
same-sex partner, and unless you write
about it in the paper, no one has to know
about either.
In this line of thought, there is an implicit
criticism of homosexuals who wear their
gender preference as an identity badge. This
is a practice which I — and the military, it
seems — find tiresome.
Above all else, continued discrimination
against homosexuals is a symbol of the atro
cious behavior we all let the military get
away with.This is the "You Can't Handle the
Truth" intimidation factor at work. But why
expend this hard-earned cultural capital on
discrimination against homosexuals?
Maybe homosexuals are actually more
threatening to powerful white men than
women or minorities are — I mean, Donald
Rumsfeld couldn't secretly be black.

and rational. Indeed. I tend to agree. But
what if the military — or any employer —
made it official policy to discriminate against
Jews? As a Jew. my rationality would fly out
the window. I would not even know how to
respond: My whole life, I have been in the
habit of screaming anti-Semite at the slight
est insinuation of discriminatory feelings.
Thankfully, scraps are all I've ever had to
fight over; in major universities in the 21st
century, struggles over civil rights generally
make up our history lessons — only the ves
tigial structure of discrimination against ho
mosexuals is still standing. To call gay rights
the civil rights struggle of our generation is a
misnomer; it is actually a throwback to a
broader series of struggles that reasonable
people already agreed on a generation ago.
What makes the longevity of anti-gay dis
crimination so hard to understand is the triv
iality of the characteristic of being discrimi
nated against. Being a Jew is much worse
than being gay — you say prayers, you have
a Bar Mitzvah, you might even wear a funny
hat. I lomosexuality isn't a race, it isn't a reli
gion, and — in spite of the übiquitous pop
culture portrayal of the limp-wristed queer
it is not a lifestyle. I lomosexuality is noth
ing more than a bedroom preference. Some
people like a good toe-suck, others like a
same-sex partner, and unless you write
about it in the paper, no one has to know
about either.
In this line of thought, there is an implicit
criticism of homosexuals who wear their
gender preference as an identity badge. This
is a practice which I — and the military, it
seems — find tiresome.
Above all else, continued discrimination
against homosexuals is a symbol of the atro
cious behavior we all let the military get
away with.This is the "You Can't Handle the
Truth" intimidation factor at work. But why
expend this hard-earned cultural capital on
discrimination against homosexuals?
Maybe homosexuals are actually more
threatening to powerful white men than
women or minorities are — I mean, Donald
Rumsfeld couldn't secretly be black.

The battle is over; "The Man" has won.
Yesterday, recruiters for the Navy Judge Ad
vocate General's Corp. visited Stanford Law
School's Office of Career Services in order
to interview six homosexuals who wouldn't
work for the military's paltry five-figure
salary even if the Defense Department did
allow it. Seem paradoxical? Republicans
have fought for eight years to interview
these homosexuals — implanting row after
row of teeth in the unloved (and probably
unconstitutional) 1994 Solomon Amend
ment — all as part of an effort to revitalize
the relationship between the military and ac
ademia. Vinegar, it seems, just doesn't attract
bees the way it used to.
Law school homosexuals, while irate
about JAG recruitment flying in the face of
the Law School's non-discrimination policy,
seemed excited to plan a protest. Stanford
has not had JAG recruiters since 2002. Hven
then, the recruiters did not get full access to
Career Services' facilities like they did yes
terday. OUTLAW, the law school's gay-and
lesbian organization, greeted the recruiters
with an information table, camouflage, pur
ple buttons and a roster of pre-emptive gay
law students to interview.
What brings JAG back after so long? Ihe
Law School's former dean. Kathleen Sulli
van, gave a talk to incoming students some
weeks ago, in which she stated that the Law
School has not had to deal with JAG re
cruiters because of insufficient student inter
est; at least five students have to request in
formation about an employer before inter
views are set up. It seems that five students
— possibly inspired by Sullivan's comments
at the talk — made the requisite inquiries
this fall, finally getting JAG onto campus.
Law students are not by any means unan
imously supportive of OUTLAW and
today's protests. Some law students that
have served in the military argue that the
military's de facto treatment of homosexuals
is improving over time. (Apparently, the mil
itary abounds with homosexuals in active
service. A friend reported to me that "You
get more [action) in the Army than in West
Hollywood ") Furthermore, some feel that
re-establishing a good relationship between
the military and academia, especially in our
post-September-11th world, is a concern
that outweighs otherwise-justified worries
over discrimination. A broader category of
law students, who are against discrimination,

nevertheless find OUTLAW'S antics to be
immature. Why not just let the JAG re
cruiters do their job and give information to
interested students?
