# Commencement locations I'd like to see
## 
### 
With the renovation of Stanford Sta
dium, this year's location for Com
mencement is in question. As a
senior, this issue has some personal impor
tance to me. As someone who has failed to
take an Area 2 GER. though, maybe I'm
counting my chickens before they've
hatched.
It is tough to beat a football stadium in
terms of holding massive amounts of people.
The closest thing nearby is the Googleplex.
located only a few miles away in Mountain
View. It could definitely hold-the amount of
students and parents attending, and since
most grads will end up there anyway, it
seems rather convenient.
Next would be Stanford's own Sterling
Quad, home to FroSoCo, PoCo, and some
other dorm. It sports some nice catering facil
ities, and it would afford Stanford students
and their families the chance to see a part of
campus they would never see otherwise.
But what we really need is some big open
space. What better location, then,is the Stan
ford golf course? We surely could fit several
commencements on the well-kept grounds.
If we had given out diplomas at the Golf
Course, maybe Tiger Woods would have
graduated.
1 know some of the best memories I've
had at Stanford have been watching the
men's and women's water polo teams, so
why not rekindle that passion in our Com
mencement? We could hold it in Avery
Aquatic Center. We'd give I lennessy a float-

ing raft in the middle, and maybe the other
speakers can all have inner tubes. The show
will be stolen, however, when Steve "I Walk
on Water" Jobs walks on water. We'll put the
law school students in the dive tank with
some swimmies or something.
People have suggested Roble Field to me.
It's plenty big,but I'm not really sure how we
are going to expect the student population to
take the ceremony seriously. For most of us,
Roble Field is the sight of sloshball or Ulti
mate Frisbee games. A red plastic cup in one
hand and a Frisbee in the other, I just don't
know how sanctimonious "rights, responsi
bilities and privileges" is going to sound, es
pecially when the speaker tells Dean Board
man to "go long"
Maybe I should be thinking more outside
the box for this one. What with the modern
advances in technology, why not do a com
mencement over the internet? We could call
it"i Commencement." Think of the Com
mencement addresses then! We could get
anybody in the world to do it. We could even

get someone like Strongßad or Lara Croft
or those dancing hamsters to do it. It would
be easy — they would just have to he near
(or made by) a computer, and their message
would be broadcast to the world. And if I get
bored with the Commencement speaker. I
can download naughty pictures of them and
have a good chuckle at their chubby thighs.
The other advantage of this plan is that I
wouldn't have to stumble around wearing
that hot, sweaty graduation robe — a
bathrobe would work just as well.The speak
er will have no problem envisioning his audi
ence in their underpants — I, for one, prob
ably will be.
The drawback of having this option, of
course, is we'd probably have to get Steve
Jobs to hook up the whole Internet-thingy
for us. That would mean two Commence
ments in a row he'd screw up royally.
And speaking of Commencement speak
ers, I've got some really great ideas for this
year. I know it's hard to follow up Steve
"Why Go to College?" Jobs, but here are
some of my picks: Governor Schwarzeneg
ger (only if he wears the Conan costume),
Tyrone Willingham. Zombie Justice Relin
quish. Carrot Top. Reese Witherspoon and
— if we ask really nicely — that born-again
Christian who shouts at us from the bird
cage. Dressed as an Elvis impersonator.

Chris's i Tunes account will probably be mys
teriously cancelled after this. Send complaints
