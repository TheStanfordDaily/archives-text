## WINLESS WEEKEND Men tie with SDSU,lose at UCLA Stanford scores only once in the two contests, now two below .500 
### BLAIR CRTICHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer (3-5-2,0-1-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) and its recent winning ways ran into a familiar
stumbling block this past weekend: No. 23 UCLA (6-2-
0,2-0-0) and its highly touted defense. The Cardinal bat
tled to a come-from-behind 1-1 tie against the Pac-lOfs
newest member, San Diego State on Friday night (7-0-2,
1-0-1) only to fall once again to the Bruins on Sunday,
this time 2-0.
In the first game of the weekend, the Cardinal al
lowed Aztec superstar midfielder Kraig Chiles four
looks at the net including an early shot upon which he
capitalized. Seven minutes into the game, sophomore
Johan Helgasson found Chiles on the left side of the
penalty area. The Aztec leader then deposited the ball
past junior keeper Andrew Kartunen to the far post for
a 1-0 lead. Re-energized after this early setback, the Car
dinal defense then played a stingy second half in which
it allowed only two shots.
"SDSU played a lot of long ball and it really came
down to winning one-on-one battles in the back," said
sophomore midfielder /defender Kyle Hency."[We need
ed] to slow the ball down, keep the ball on the floor, then
we could pass it around them."
Essential to Stanford's comeback was avoiding the
natural tendency to focus solely on Chiles. Instead the
Cardinal aimed at shutting down his supporting cast.The
rest of the Aztecs only had three shots all game.
"When you're playing a good offensive team, you
want to know what they do tactically, which we get in the
scouting report [ahead of time]," sophomore defender
Ryan Oblak said. "But once you play them, I try not to
get too psyched up, and play them honest. You need to
respect everyone's ability on the field."
The 1-0 deficit stood until the 76th minute when soph
omore Dan Shapiro assisted the Cardinal's own dynam
ic offensive force, Marcus Ryan.The sophomore forward
added to his team leading numbers by notching his fourth
goal of the season on a shot that ricocheted off the cross
bar. The goal itself was a feat, as junior Aztec keeper Tally
Hall entered the game with the nation's top goals against
average.
"It was the kind of game where at halftime we were
down 1-0 and if you told me we'd come back to tie it, I
would've been happy," head coach Bret Simon said."But
I think we all felt like we had them on the ropes a little bit
and maybe could have won the game."
The comeback was just an appetizer to Sunday's show
down against UCLA. Stanford has played Tom to the
Bruin's Jerry for years — desperately and fruitlessly trying
to catch and defeat them. Currently, Stanford is mired in a
slump of seven straight losses to the Southern California
squad; the Cardinal last beat UCLA in 2000.
The first half of the match was relatively even. UCLA
forward Jordan Harvey drew first blood with a goal from
just outside the six-yard box. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, missed their best scoring opportunity of the half
when a shot smacked off the post with minutes to go be
fore the intermission.
Things would not remain tightly contested for the
rest of the match. Sloppiness on the Cardinal defense fa
cilitated the second goal as sophomore Kamani Hill
stole a pass in the defense. Hill than initiated a give-and
go play with senior Ramon Manak and after receiving
the ball again, netted his third goal of the year. In spite of
this lapse, the coaching staff was still very pleased with
the overall play of its backs.
"The bad news was that in the second half, they were

just stronger than us," Simon said. "Sometimes that hap
pens on the road, in the second game, but its not a good
excuse. Our team really needs to buckle down and put its
foot on the gas and accelerate in the second half, which
we did against San Diego State, but against UCLA it was
just the opposite."
The insurance goal would be more than enough of
fense, as UCLA played an unusually defensive line-up,
which supplemented an already highly respected full
back line. The Cardinal offense was handcuffed and
could only muster two shots all day, neither of which
were on net.
"We were back on defense 75 percent of the game at
least," Hency said. "You can't win if you don't have the
ball. We tried to keep it compact defensively but it wasn't

happening. They were just a better team on the day."
Next up for Stanford is archrival No. 3 California (7-
2-1, 0-2-0) who lost both games this weekend to the
Aztecs and Bruins and despite its overall impressive
record, is in last place in the conference. Soccer fans
should anticipate a hotly contested battle. Last year, the
Cardinal made up a two-goal deficit to force a double
overtime tie at home and then lost a 3-2 double overtime
classic at Berkeley.
"I think this year we match up better than we did in
the past." Hency said. "We're much more athletic now
which is where 1 thought they beat us last year."
The team hopes for the stands to be packed for some
elite soccer when Maloney Field hosts the newest install
ment of the Bay Area rivalry on Oct. 8 at 7 p.m.

could only muster two shots all day, neither of which
were on net.
"We were back on defense 75 percent of the game at
least," Hency said. "You can't win if you don't have the
ball. We tried to keep it compact defensively but it wasn't

happening. They were just a better team on the day."
Next up for Stanford is archrival No. 3 California (7-
2-1, 0-2-0) who lost both games this weekend to the
Aztecs and Bruins and despite its overall impressive
record, is in last place in the conference. Soccer fans
should anticipate a hotly contested battle. Last year, the
Cardinal made up a two-goal deficit to force a double
overtime tie at home and then lost a 3-2 double overtime
classic at Berkeley.
"I think this year we match up better than we did in
the past." Hency said. "We're much more athletic now
which is where 1 thought they beat us last year."
The team hopes for the stands to be packed for some
elite soccer when Maloney Field hosts the newest install

Sophomore forward Dan Shapiro leaps fora header in a contest held last year. Shapito and the Cardinal look to rebound
from this past weekend when cross-Bay rival Cal visits the Faim on Saturday.
Stanford men's soccer (3-5-2,0-1-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) and its recent winning ways ran into a familiar
stumbling block this past weekend: No. 23 UCLA (6-2-
0,2-0-0) and its highly touted defense. The Cardinal bat
tled to a come-from-behind 1-1 tie against the Pac-lOfs
newest member, San Diego State on Friday night (7-0-2,
1-0-1) only to fall once again to the Bruins on Sunday,
this time 2-0.
In the first game of the weekend, the Cardinal al
lowed Aztec superstar midfielder Kraig Chiles four
looks at the net including an early shot upon which he
capitalized. Seven minutes into the game, sophomore
Johan Helgasson found Chiles on the left side of the
penalty area. The Aztec leader then deposited the ball
past junior keeper Andrew Kartunen to the far post for
a 1-0 lead. Re-energized after this early setback, the Car
dinal defense then played a stingy second half in which
it allowed only two shots.
"SDSU played a lot of long ball and it really came
down to winning one-on-one battles in the back," said
sophomore midfielder /defender Kyle Hency."[We need
ed] to slow the ball down, keep the ball on the floor, then
we could pass it around them."
Essential to Stanford's comeback was avoiding the
natural tendency to focus solely on Chiles. Instead the
Cardinal aimed at shutting down his supporting cast.The
rest of the Aztecs only had three shots all game.
"When you're playing a good offensive team, you
want to know what they do tactically, which we get in the
scouting report [ahead of time]," sophomore defender
Ryan Oblak said. "But once you play them, I try not to
get too psyched up, and play them honest. You need to
respect everyone's ability on the field."
The 1-0 deficit stood until the 76th minute when soph
omore Dan Shapiro assisted the Cardinal's own dynam
ic offensive force, Marcus Ryan.The sophomore forward
added to his team leading numbers by notching his fourth
goal of the season on a shot that ricocheted off the cross
bar. The goal itself was a feat, as junior Aztec keeper Tally
Hall entered the game with the nation's top goals against
average.
"It was the kind of game where at halftime we were
down 1-0 and if you told me we'd come back to tie it, I
would've been happy," head coach Bret Simon said."But
I think we all felt like we had them on the ropes a little bit
and maybe could have won the game."
The comeback was just an appetizer to Sunday's show
down against UCLA. Stanford has played Tom to the
Bruin's Jerry for years — desperately and fruitlessly trying
to catch and defeat them. Currently, Stanford is mired in a
slump of seven straight losses to the Southern California
squad; the Cardinal last beat UCLA in 2000.
The first half of the match was relatively even. UCLA
forward Jordan Harvey drew first blood with a goal from
just outside the six-yard box. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, missed their best scoring opportunity of the half
when a shot smacked off the post with minutes to go be
fore the intermission.
Things would not remain tightly contested for the
rest of the match. Sloppiness on the Cardinal defense fa
cilitated the second goal as sophomore Kamani Hill
stole a pass in the defense. Hill than initiated a give-and
go play with senior Ramon Manak and after receiving
the ball again, netted his third goal of the year. In spite of
this lapse, the coaching staff was still very pleased with
the overall play of its backs.
"The bad news was that in the second half, they were

just stronger than us," Simon said. "Sometimes that hap
pens on the road, in the second game, but its not a good
excuse. Our team really needs to buckle down and put its
foot on the gas and accelerate in the second half, which
we did against San Diego State, but against UCLA it was
just the opposite."
The insurance goal would be more than enough of
fense, as UCLA played an unusually defensive line-up,
which supplemented an already highly respected full
back line. The Cardinal offense was handcuffed and
could only muster two shots all day, neither of which
were on net.
"We were back on defense 75 percent of the game at
least," Hency said. "You can't win if you don't have the
