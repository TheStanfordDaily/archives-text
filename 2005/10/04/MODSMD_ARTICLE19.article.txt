# Men's tennis travels to Tulsa
## Four Cardinal travel to the Sooner State to kick off their seasons early 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
TUlsa, Okla., has been a tennis hotbed of late. The city
hosted a Challenger tournament seven days ago and plans
to welcome an ITF Juniors event next week. This week,
however, the Stanford men's tennis team is visiting for the
Polo Ralph Lauren Men's Ail-American Tennis Champi
onships.
"TUlsa is a pretty good tennis town right now, with three
big tournaments in a row," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "I'm hoping the crowd and people realize the quality
of play that they're going to see this week."
After starting practice just last Wednesday, Stanford is
sending four players to compete in the first tournament of
the season. Senior KC Corkery and junior James Wan are
scheduled to compete in main draw singles action, while
junior James Pade and freshman Matt Bruch compete in
the singles qualifying draw. Corkery and Pade, as well as
Bruch and Wan. plan to partner to compete in the main and
qualifying doubles draws, respectively.
"Lately, we have had some success in this tournament,
and I think we can have success again," Whitlinger said.
"It's just one step towards our goal of getting ready for (the
NCAAs]."
Bruch and Pade competed in opposite halves of the sin
gles draw, and both faced seeded players in the first round.
In his collegiate debut, Bruch defeated Louisiana-
Lafayette's Dusan Tabak. 6-0,6-4, and advances to face Illi-

nois' Pramod Dahir today. The freshman
pairs up with Wan in the first round of the
qualifying draw to face a squad from Air
Force.
Pade was not as fortunate in his first
match, dropping a tight three-setter to
Auburn's Alex Schweizer.
"It's early in the year, so most impor
tant is just playing well and not worrying
about how far you go, who you play and
who does what," Corkery said. "We still
want to do well and show everyone that
we'll be tough to beat this year, but at the
same time — more importantly for me —
I just need to keep trying to improve."
Qualifying rounds of the tournament
began yesterday and will feed into the
main draws, where play is scheduled to
begin on Thursday. The competition is ex
pected to be fierce, as top schools such as
Baylor, Illinois and defending NCAA
Champions UCLA will each be sending
their best players.
"[This tournament] lets me see where
guys are at this point in time," Whitlinger
said."lt's a long season,so one tournament
is not going to make or break it. but it's
nice to get a good start, too."
Whitlinger added that the talent and
depth of the tournament are increasing by
the year. While some players are taking the
fall quarter off, the coach still compares
the quality of the tournament to a mini-
NCAA Championship.

senior Sam Warburg won every set prior to
last year's final.s only to fall to Mississip
pi's Catalin Gard in the championship
match.
Entering the season ranked ninth in
singles, Corkery also earned a 13th place
preseason ranking with his doubles part
ner Pade.
"We played quite a bit together this
summer and did well together,so I'm real
ly looking forward to this year." Corkery
said.
The senior looks to inflict damage in his
fourth appearance at the Ail-Americans.
In 2004, Corkery dropped a second round
decision to Virginia's Doug Stewart in
three sets, and a New Mexico tandem
handed Warburg and Corkery a second
round doubles loss.
Now a senior, Stewart — who was
ranked at No. 6 in the preseason — is mak
ing his third appearance in the tourna
ment. A tough counterpuncher, Stewart
beat Warburg last year in straight sets
when Stanford faced Virginia in the Team
Indoor Championships.
"Doug [Stewart] is a tough competi
tor," Whitlinger said. "It's his final year,
and he seems to be getting better every
year. He didn't finish last year well, but this
guy is a very talented player and could po
tentially win the NCAA Championship."
Although the NCAA tournament is
still months away, Corkery believes his
squad can achieve success throughout the
course of the season.
"I'm really enjoying the team." Corkery
said."Everyone is getting along better than
last year and working hard. We've had a re
ally tough first week of conditioning and
everyone is excited and ready to go."
