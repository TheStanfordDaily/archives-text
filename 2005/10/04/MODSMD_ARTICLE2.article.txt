# Halloween party may return to campus
## Students take initiative to revive discontinued Mausoleum Party 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
After a three-year hiatus, the Mausoleum party
may be returning to campus. If all goes to plan, stu
dents will once again be able to celebrate Halloween
by dancing feet away from the Stanford family's
graves.
This unique Stanford event was discontinued after
2001 due to a lack of funding. Last spring, the ASSU
and other campus groups met to discuss a possible re
vival of the tradition. While plans have not been final
ized, the ASSU has expressed its commitment to
bringing the Mausoleum party back to campus.
"Our aim is to re-establish a Stanford tradition
that has fallen by the wayside, and in doing so, unite
the entire campus in a night of spirited celebration,"
wrote ASSU Executive Cabinet Member Dave San
ford, a senior who is serving as chief project manag
er for the event, in an e-mail to The Daily. "We want
to do everything we can to ensure that all Stanford
students have the chance to fulfill number 19 on

soleum Party."
The event was sponsored in pre
vious years by the Stanford Alumni
Association (SAA). In 2001. the
SAA refocused its resources to bet
ter meet its core mission and objec
tives and funding for the Mau
soleum party was cut.
"We concluded that the Mau
soleum Party could easily be hosted
and organized by another group or
a collaborative effort of multiple
groups,"said Victor Madrigal, direc
tor of student and young alumni
outreach, in an interview with The
Daily. "The beauty of college tradi
tions is that there is always a new
generation of students that will de
cide if they want to keep that tradi
tion alive or not Ultimately, stu
dents uphold traditions and the ap
propriate University staff is there to
help as needed and when needed."
The ASSU rose to the task, and a
committee to revive the tradition
was formed. Numerous campus
groups have seats on the committee
— the senior class presidents, the
undergraduate senate, the Gradu
ate Student Council and the Office
of Student Activities have all pro
vided their support. In addition.
Madrigal is serving as the staff advi
sor to the committee.
"This fall, the ASSU decided to
take on the role of mobilizing the
various campus groups and re
sources to make the Mausoleum
party happen," wrote senior
Melanie Kannokada, ASSU presi
dent, in an e-mail to The Daily. "We
have tremendous support, not just
from within the ASSU but from all
parts of the campus community —
both grad and undergrad — to
bring this event back to Stanford's
social scene. We are looking to hold
the Mausoleum party on the week
end of Oct. 28."
Students agree that the Mau
soleum party would be a great addi
tion to the roster of beloved Stan
ford traditions like Full Moon on
the Quad and Big Game.
"I think the Mausoleum party
would be awesome — I would defi
nitely go," said senior Robyn Smith.
"We need a party like that on Hal
loween because going to the Castro
isn't easy fora lot of students."
Junior Ross D. Porter said he
thought the Mausoleum party
would help diversify the Stanford
social scene.
"Stanford parties are too similar,
but there's not much we can do
without a good venue," he said.
The Mausoleum party promises
a more diverse crowd of attendees
as well as a change of location.
"If the party were well-publi
cized, I'm sure a lot of grad students
would go," said Vishal Arya, a sec
ond-year graduate student in man
agement science and engineering. "1
haven't really heard much about
this event, but I'm sure you'd see a
lot of people checking it out if it
happened."

"This fall, the ASSU decided to
take on the role of mobilizing the
various campus groups and re
sources to make the Mausoleum
party happen," wrote senior
Melanie Kannokada, ASSU presi
dent, in an e-mail to The Daily. "We
have tremendous support, not just
from within the ASSU but from all
parts of the campus community —
both grad and undergrad — to
bring this event back to Stanford's
social scene. We are looking to hold
the Mausoleum party on the week
end of Oct. 28."
Students agree that the Mau

would be awesome — I would defi

"We need a party like that on Hal

Junior Ross D. Porter said he
thought the Mausoleum party
would help diversify the Stanford
social scene.
"Stanford parties are too similar,
but there's not much we can do
without a good venue," he said.
The Mausoleum party promises
a more diverse crowd of attendees
as well as a change of location.
"If the party were well-publi

would go," said Vishal Arya, a sec

haven't really heard much about
this event, but I'm sure you'd see a

both stress that the event has yet to

this Halloween, students will be cel

After a three-year hiatus, the Mausoleum party
may be returning to campus. If all goes to plan, stu
dents will once again be able to celebrate Halloween
by dancing feet away from the Stanford family's
graves.
This unique Stanford event was discontinued after
2001 due to a lack of funding. Last spring, the ASSU
and other campus groups met to discuss a possible re
vival of the tradition. While plans have not been final
ized, the ASSU has expressed its commitment to
bringing the Mausoleum party back to campus.
"Our aim is to re-establish a Stanford tradition
that has fallen by the wayside, and in doing so, unite
the entire campus in a night of spirited celebration,"
wrote ASSU Executive Cabinet Member Dave San
ford, a senior who is serving as chief project manag
er for the event, in an e-mail to The Daily. "We want
to do everything we can to ensure that all Stanford
students have the chance to fulfill number 19 on
Stanford Magazine's list of the '101 Things You
Must Do Before Graduating' — dance at the Mau-

soleum Party."
The event was sponsored in pre
vious years by the Stanford Alumni
Association (SAA). In 2001. the
SAA refocused its resources to bet
ter meet its core mission and objec
tives and funding for the Mau
soleum party was cut.
"We concluded that the Mau
soleum Party could easily be hosted
and organized by another group or
a collaborative effort of multiple
groups,"said Victor Madrigal, direc
tor of student and young alumni
outreach, in an interview with The
Daily. "The beauty of college tradi
tions is that there is always a new
generation of students that will de
cide if they want to keep that tradi
tion alive or not Ultimately, stu
dents uphold traditions and the ap
propriate University staff is there to
help as needed and when needed."
The ASSU rose to the task, and a
committee to revive the tradition
was formed. Numerous campus
groups have seats on the committee
— the senior class presidents, the
undergraduate senate, the Gradu
ate Student Council and the Office
of Student Activities have all pro
vided their support. In addition.
