## From Stanford to the Super Bowl, Raghav reviews 
### 
Let's get started. If you have a deep passion for ran
dom opinions; observations, thoughts and mus
ings, you've come to the right place.
Point Seven: The Pacific-10 Conference
basketball/football curse. Lately, I've noticed a trend
that when a Pac-10 football program rises, its basketball
counterpart tends to fall. Or vice versa.
When USC football had its breakout year (2002-03),
its basketball team slipped from a tournament team to
Pac-10 doorstop. Cal actually had one year of basketball
and football respectability (also 2002-03) but as its foot
ball team became a national power, its men's basketball
team became the poster boy for underachiever. When
Washington basketball rose two years ago, the Huskies
football team declined into oblivion.
Just look at the standings. The top football programs:
USC, Cal, Arizona State, Washington State and Oregon
State all have subpar basketball programs. The top bas
ketball programs: Stanford, Arizona and Washington
have struggling football programs. UCLA is the only ex
ception to the curse, and they're not that spectacular in
either sport. If the football team starts winning, Trent
Johnson should be afraid, very afraid. Speaking of Trent
Johnson...
Point Six: It's just over a month until Maples begins
to rock.The Cardinal men's basketball team is receiving
some major preseason accolades. Stanford is ranked
anywhere from 12-20 by most major national publica
tions, and is the popular pick to win the Pac-10. One
magazine has the Cardinal as a preseason Final Four fa
vorite
Regardless of the hype, this year could be especially
exciting as the Cardinal are likely to run in order to com
pensate for their lack of post depth. (Too bad the Lopez
twins can't matriculate a year early.) Stanford could
have three All Pac-10 selections in a healthy Dan Grun
feld, Matt Haryasz and point guard Chris Hernandez.
Maybe they'll finally get past the first weekend of March
Madness for the first time since 2001.
Point Five: After a pointless yearlong lockout that
alienated the vast majority of its already meager popu
lation of fans, the NHL begins. Sorry, it deserved that
comment for putting this fan through the lockout.
You may ask, who cares? Anyone sick of steroids,
Terrell Owens or millionaire athletes claiming their ex
travagant salaries are incapable of feeding their fami
lies. Or anyone who cares to watch passionate athletes
play a seemingly revamped sport, complete with
shootouts. At least the Canadian population boom can
subside now that people have something else to do Sat
urday night.
Point Four: We're a quarter of the way there. The
NFL just wrapped up week four. New England looks a
little tired, old and injured, so I'll ride the Cincinnati
bandwagon for right now. Carson Palmer for MVP! Se
riously, though, the Bengals have a very potent offense
and a defense that forces turnovers. They still might be
a little baby-faced fora Super Bowl run.
If 1 had to pick now, I would expect them and Indi
anapolis to fight it out in the AFC. The Eagles should
march their way through the NFC, only to achieve their
second straight Super Bowl loss. Am I the only one who
thinks they will never win a Super Bowl?
Point Three: Let's stick with the pros, as we head to
baseball. St. Louis looks like the overwhelming favorite.
All four AL teams look excellent as well. My early pick
is the Angels defeating the Cards.
And now the top two, which are devoted to Stanford
football...
Point 2: A Stanford-Davis rematch unlikely. One en
thusiastic UC-Davis supporter e-mailed me an article
claiming that a Stanford-Davis rematch was not likely to
happen in the future. Good. His article led me to ask the
question: Why did they schedule Davis anyways?
Stanford had nothing to gain and everything to lose
in that match up. A win and no one cares. A loss and well.
