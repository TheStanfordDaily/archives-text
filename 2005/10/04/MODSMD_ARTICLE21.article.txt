# Card sweep at Maine Invite
## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
I"he men's and women's cross-country
squads couldn't have hoped fora better
result this past Saturday at the Murray
Keatinge Invitational in Orono, Maine.
Despite the long trip, both squads won the
team competition, and, on the women's
side, sophomore Arianna Lambie finished
first overall.
At the Invitational, the men placed all
seven runners in the top 10.The women saw
four finish in the top 10, in part due to Lam
bre's first-place finish and sophomore Tere
sa McWalters crossing the line in second.
"I was feeling strong, but I was really ex
cited for the team," Lambie said. "We were
really all in it together. Going to Maine was
nice — I think we were all excited to get
away — and a lot of us are from the East
Coast, so our parents came up to watch."
Both the men and the women had run
the course on Friday, so the athletes knew
what to expect on race day
"Not one person had a bad race," assis
tant coach Ashley Couper said. "They all
ran really tough."
Lambie finished the 5.000-meter course
in 16:38.30. ahead of 91 other runners.
McWalters' 16:51.90 placed her second,
while junior twins Katy and Amanda TVot
ter took fourth and seventh respectively.
The four ran as a pack for most of the race.
Because of the quick initial pace, Lam
bie believed racing alongside teammates
was essential.
"Running with a pack always helps,"
Lambie said. "The race went out very fast

so we were each pressing the pace at differ
ent points. We had to run as individuals to
ward the end of the race, unfortunately, hut
we are learning a lot about using each
other's energy and running as a pack."
Runners from Boston College and Dart
mouth rounded out the rest of the top 10,
but could prove no match for the Cardinal.
"Our girls were pretty close to the front
the whole time," Couper said. "The BC girls
went out really hard in the front, but our
girls are really strong right now. I told them
to stay relaxed until about halfway
through."
Lambie followed that plan to perfec
tion, distancing herself from the pack at the
one and a half mile mark. At that point,
Lambie said, she felt strong, and though she
knew two runners from Boston College
were leading, she found the energy to go
after them and cruise to victory from there
"It was a surprise for other people be
cause the runners are in the woods at that
point, but she came out way to the front,"
Couper said.
McWalters finished just ahead of third
place senior Laurel Burdick of Boston Col
lege, who finished in 16:52.20.
The men, according to senior David
Vidal, were also well prepared both men
tally and physically for the race.
"Before the race the whole team was to
tally relaxed and having fun," Vidal said.
"Being in Maine was great — it is such a
beautiful state. We were focused on our
selves and not the other teams."
Similar to the women's strategy, the men
ran as a unit, feeding off of each
other's energy. The pack of Cardinal
men stayed together for over half of
their 8,000-meter race, splitting up
around the 5,000-meter, or three
mile mark.
"Everything kind of broke up at
about three miles," Vidal said. "But
we were still aware of where every
one else was, though. We all finished
in the top 10 so everyone stayed up
front and some of us»were still run
ning together."
Vidal finished the race in 24 min
utes flat, just behind first-place fin
isher sophomore Ben True of Dart
mouth, who won in 23:59.10.
"The Dartmouth guys started
pushing the pack, and David Vidal
and a couple others went with
them," Couper said. "[Vidal] was in
second-place with 600,400 meters to
go, and I just told him to go for it. He
ran so tough, he really gave it all he
had."
Vidal and True battled it out until
the end, with Vidal pulling ahead on
the track with 150 meters to go on a
track. The two were neck and neck
throughout the final 100 meters but
True barely inched Vidal.
"(Vidal] looked really good,"
Couper said. "I saw him at two miles
and he had a big smile on his face.
He had an amazing race and just ran
so well."
Junior Jonathan Pierce finished
fourth in 24:13.90, while redshirt
freshman Hakon DeVries took fifth
in 24:14. Sophomore Russell Brown
came in seventh in 24:16.60.
"I think we are on the right track
and right where we want to be,"
Vidal said. "We are really happy."

At the Invitational, the men placed all
seven runners in the top 10.The women saw
four finish in the top 10, in part due to Lam
bre's first-place finish and sophomore Tere
sa McWalters crossing the line in second.
"I was feeling strong, but I was really ex
cited for the team," Lambie said. "We were
really all in it together. Going to Maine was
nice — I think we were all excited to get
away — and a lot of us are from the East
Coast, so our parents came up to watch."
Both the men and the women had run
the course on Friday, so the athletes knew
what to expect on race day
"Not one person had a bad race," assis
tant coach Ashley Couper said. "They all
ran really tough."
Lambie finished the 5.000-meter course
in 16:38.30. ahead of 91 other runners.
McWalters' 16:51.90 placed her second,
while junior twins Katy and Amanda TVot
ter took fourth and seventh respectively.
The four ran as a pack for most of the race.
Because of the quick initial pace, Lam
bie believed racing alongside teammates
was essential.
"Running with a pack always helps,"
Lambie said. "The race went out very fast

so we were each pressing the pace at differ
ent points. We had to run as individuals to
ward the end of the race, unfortunately, hut
we are learning a lot about using each
other's energy and running as a pack."
Runners from Boston College and Dart
mouth rounded out the rest of the top 10,
but could prove no match for the Cardinal.
"Our girls were pretty close to the front
the whole time," Couper said. "The BC girls
went out really hard in the front, but our
girls are really strong right now. I told them
to stay relaxed until about halfway
through."
Lambie followed that plan to perfec
tion, distancing herself from the pack at the
one and a half mile mark. At that point,
Lambie said, she felt strong, and though she
knew two runners from Boston College
were leading, she found the energy to go
after them and cruise to victory from there
"It was a surprise for other people be
cause the runners are in the woods at that
point, but she came out way to the front,"
Couper said.
McWalters finished just ahead of third
place senior Laurel Burdick of Boston Col
lege, who finished in 16:52.20.
The men, according to senior David
Vidal, were also well prepared both men
tally and physically for the race.
"Before the race the whole team was to
tally relaxed and having fun," Vidal said.
"Being in Maine was great — it is such a
beautiful state. We were focused on our
selves and not the other teams."
Similar to the women's strategy, the men
ran as a unit, feeding off of each
other's energy. The pack of Cardinal
men stayed together for over half of
their 8,000-meter race, splitting up
around the 5,000-meter, or three
mile mark.
"Everything kind of broke up at
about three miles," Vidal said. "But
we were still aware of where every
one else was, though. We all finished
in the top 10 so everyone stayed up
front and some of us»were still run
ning together."
Vidal finished the race in 24 min
utes flat, just behind first-place fin
isher sophomore Ben True of Dart
mouth, who won in 23:59.10.
"The Dartmouth guys started
pushing the pack, and David Vidal
and a couple others went with
them," Couper said. "[Vidal] was in
second-place with 600,400 meters to
go, and I just told him to go for it. He
ran so tough, he really gave it all he
had."
Vidal and True battled it out until
the end, with Vidal pulling ahead on
the track with 150 meters to go on a
track. The two were neck and neck
throughout the final 100 meters but
True barely inched Vidal.
"(Vidal] looked really good,"
Couper said. "I saw him at two miles
and he had a big smile on his face.
He had an amazing race and just ran
so well."
Junior Jonathan Pierce finished
fourth in 24:13.90, while redshirt
freshman Hakon DeVries took fifth
in 24:14. Sophomore Russell Brown
came in seventh in 24:16.60.
"I think we are on the right track
and right where we want to be,"
Vidal said. "We are really happy."
