# Heartbreak in shootout loss
## Field hockey squanders three-goal lead to Pacific 
### ROHAN PARVANIK 
The Stanford women's field hockey team (3-
9,1-2 Northern Pacific Conference) fell to Nor-
Pac rival Pacific, 4-3, in a double-overtime
shootout this past Sunday. The home contest
was a rematch of the Sept. 25 game that the Car
dinal won 2-1 at Brookside Field in Stockton,
Calif.
"We were disappointed to have let a 3-0 lead
slip, to say the least," freshman midfielder / de
fender Bailey Richardson said. "But we were
proud of how we played in overtime, and we
know that when it really matters [in the confer
ence tournament,] we will take our revenge."
Richardson added that the team was able to
score well from the top of the circle.
"We were able to create opportunities from
just taking shots, either off rebounds or straight
hits," Richardson said.
Sophomore midfielder / forward Jess Zutz
started the team off with a pair of first-half goals.
Zutz scored once at 26:52 and once at 33:53 to
give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead going into halftime.
Freshman midfielder / defender Ali Fox indi
cated that the team greatly admired Zutz's play.
"Jess had an amazing game and I'm so proud
of her," Fox said. "She sparked a lot of offense
and scored two beautiful goals. If she keeps this
kind of play up, we'll definitely see some more
wins."
Senior midfielder Missy Halliday scored at
46:55 to give Stanford a 3-0 cushion, but UOP
star,junior Vianney Campos,scored at 48:29 from
a penalty corner to give the Tigers renewed hope.
The Stanford squad faced difficulties in fac
ing the onslaught from Pacific's offense. UOP
junior Marissa Atilano scored unassisted at
52:39. And at 55:24, Campos scored again from a

penalty corner to tie the score at three all.
According to Richardson, Campos was un
doubtedly UOP's star player during the match.
"Vianney is an incredible player and we
knew that coming in," Richardson said. "We
were able to limit her impact most of the game
and she didn't score during regular play [both of
her goals came off short corners], but she still
controls and starts the entire offense for UOP.
She is their go-to player and makes everyone
around her look better."
The teams seemed evenly matched during
the two overtime periods, with neither scoring.
The game then moved to a shootout, during
which Campos, freshman Danielle Neault and
junior Michelle Manson scored to give the
Tigers the victory.
Freshman goalkeeper Sarah Scheller started
her second college game and saved four shots.
Scheller was recently named NorPac Rookie of
the Week after tallying her first collegiate victo
ry in the Sept. 25 game against Pacific.
According to head coach Lesley Irvine, the
squad played an excellent game but was unable
to hold its substantial lead fora variety of rea
sons, including errors which Pacific capitalized
on. Fox hopes the team uses the loss to its advan
tage.
"We were definitely disappointed with the
loss," Fox said. "To squander a 3-0 lead is diffi
cult to deal with, but hopefully we'll use this
game as a learning experience."
Richardson admitted that the team needed
to better regroup after Pacific began its offen
sive onslaught.
"UOP is famous for their ability to come
back," she said. "We let up and played timidly
for just about 20 minutes, and they came back on
us. I think that we could have just collected our
selves a little bit better after UOP scored their
goals. We need to come together and play less
scared when the momentum of the match begins
to sway."
