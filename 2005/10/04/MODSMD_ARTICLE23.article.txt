# Cardinal fall at Berkeley
## Bears triumph over Stanford water polo, 9-5 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Thus far this season, the play of the No. 2 men's water
polo team (7-2,1 -1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has
been marked by an impressive ability to score early and
often. Going into their Saturday afternoon 9-5 defeat at the
hands of No. 3 California (10-1), the Stanford men had
outscored their opponents 31-7 in the first period of play
and 58-21 during the first half.
However, the Cardinal were unable to replicate that
early success in their contest against the Golden Bears and
found themselves fighting from behind before ultimately
falling.
The Cal offense, led by junior John Mann,came out blaz
ing, tallying two goals within the first three minutes of the
game. Junior Marty Matthies opened the scoring at 6:28 in
the opening period, and soon thereafter Mann capitalized
on the Bear's six-on-five advantage to notch his first goal of
the day.
"It's always tough to play [the Bears] at their pool, and
we made it even harder on ourselves by allowing them jump
to a 2-0 lead early in the first quarter," redshirt sophomore
Forrest Schwartz said.
The Stanford defense then managed to temporarily con
tain the Cal attack, allowing the Bears only one more goal in
the remainder of the first period. During that time, the Car
dinal cut the deficit to one on the strength of tallies from
sophomore Michael Bury and freshman two-meter William
Hindle-Katel.
However, that one-goal deficit was as close as the Stan
ford men would come to catching the Bears for the rest of
the game. Three unanswered goals by the hometown Cal
squad in the second period put the score at 6-2 and left the
Cardinal facing a sizable, and ultimately insurmountable,
hurdle.
The Cardinal looked to pull themselves back into the
game coming out of the half, and a flip-shot from junior
two-meter defender J.J. Garton just over two minutes into
the third period brought them within three goals. But the

Cal defense, anchored by the solid play of senior Nate Ben
nett in goal, shut down Stanford's hopes fora rally and held
the Cardinal scoreless until midway through the final peri
od of play.
Mann almost single-handedly slammed the door on the
Stanford men's comeback attempt. With 2:45 remaining in
the third period, Mann notched his second score of the day
to respond to Garton's goal.Then, in the final period of play,
Mann completed his hat-trick and added yet another tally
for good measure. With his four goals on the day, Mann ce
mented his status as the cornerstone of the high-caliber Cal
attack.
The field day enjoyed by the Bears' offense was particu
larly hard to stomach for the Cardinal, who pride them
selves on the quality of their team-defense.
"Cal has very good shooters on their team, and we didn't
do a good enough job challenging their shooters when they
had the ball," Schwartz said. "We let them get comfortable,
and they were able to pick apart our defense. We feel that
our defense should always be one of our strengths, so it was
disappointing not to perform well defensively."
Stanford captain Peter Varellas netted his only goal of
the game at 3:30 into the fourth period, and Hindle-Katel
found the back of the cage with one second remaining to
wrap up the day's scoring. But it was too little for the Cardi
nal as they fell to the Bears in the rivals' first meeting of the
year.
"[Our] loss against Cal was due to us not coming out
ready to play," junior driver Tyler Drake said. "We played
flat instead of coming out with a lot of energy. We did not
move enough on offense to produce high-quality scoring
opportunities. On defense we were just too slow to the ball."
The Stanford men look to get back on track this coming
weekend when they travel to Stockton, Calif, to take on Pa
cific(7-5). Last Thursday, the Cardinal recorded a dominant
14-4 victory over the visiting Tigers. The contest saw nine
Cardinal score and the defense complemented the offensive
explosion with a similarly solid performance.
Regardless of the recent success they have enjoyed
against the Tigers, the Cardinal promise not to overlook Pa
cific.
"[Pacific] is better than in recent years,and we are taking
them very seriously as an opponent," Varellas said. "[lt's]
likely to be a physical match — hopefully our combination
of strength and speed will help us against our larger oppo
nents."
Saturday's matchup is scheduled to precede a Sunday
scrimmage against an alumni squad.

on the Bear's six-on-five advantage to notch his first goal of
the day.
"It's always tough to play [the Bears] at their pool, and
we made it even harder on ourselves by allowing them jump
to a 2-0 lead early in the first quarter," redshirt sophomore
Forrest Schwartz said.
The Stanford defense then managed to temporarily con
tain the Cal attack, allowing the Bears only one more goal in
the remainder of the first period. During that time, the Car
dinal cut the deficit to one on the strength of tallies from
sophomore Michael Bury and freshman two-meter William
Hindle-Katel.
However, that one-goal deficit was as close as the Stan
ford men would come to catching the Bears for the rest of
the game. Three unanswered goals by the hometown Cal
squad in the second period put the score at 6-2 and left the
Cardinal facing a sizable, and ultimately insurmountable,
hurdle.
The Cardinal looked to pull themselves back into the
game coming out of the half, and a flip-shot from junior
two-meter defender J.J. Garton just over two minutes into
the third period brought them within three goals. But the

Cal defense, anchored by the solid play of senior Nate Ben
nett in goal, shut down Stanford's hopes fora rally and held
the Cardinal scoreless until midway through the final peri
od of play.
Mann almost single-handedly slammed the door on the
Stanford men's comeback attempt. With 2:45 remaining in
the third period, Mann notched his second score of the day
to respond to Garton's goal.Then, in the final period of play,
Mann completed his hat-trick and added yet another tally
for good measure. With his four goals on the day, Mann ce
mented his status as the cornerstone of the high-caliber Cal
attack.
The field day enjoyed by the Bears' offense was particu
larly hard to stomach for the Cardinal, who pride them
selves on the quality of their team-defense.
"Cal has very good shooters on their team, and we didn't
do a good enough job challenging their shooters when they
had the ball," Schwartz said. "We let them get comfortable,
and they were able to pick apart our defense. We feel that
our defense should always be one of our strengths, so it was
disappointing not to perform well defensively."
Stanford captain Peter Varellas netted his only goal of
the game at 3:30 into the fourth period, and Hindle-Katel
found the back of the cage with one second remaining to
wrap up the day's scoring. But it was too little for the Cardi
nal as they fell to the Bears in the rivals' first meeting of the
year.
"[Our] loss against Cal was due to us not coming out
ready to play," junior driver Tyler Drake said. "We played
flat instead of coming out with a lot of energy. We did not
move enough on offense to produce high-quality scoring
opportunities. On defense we were just too slow to the ball."
The Stanford men look to get back on track this coming
weekend when they travel to Stockton, Calif, to take on Pa
cific(7-5). Last Thursday, the Cardinal recorded a dominant
14-4 victory over the visiting Tigers. The contest saw nine
Cardinal score and the defense complemented the offensive
explosion with a similarly solid performance.
Regardless of the recent success they have enjoyed
against the Tigers, the Cardinal promise not to overlook Pa
cific.
"[Pacific] is better than in recent years,and we are taking
them very seriously as an opponent," Varellas said. "[lt's]
likely to be a physical match — hopefully our combination
of strength and speed will help us against our larger oppo
nents."
Saturday's matchup is scheduled to precede a Sunday
scrimmage against an alumni squad.
Thus far this season, the play of the No. 2 men's water
polo team (7-2,1 -1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has
been marked by an impressive ability to score early and
often. Going into their Saturday afternoon 9-5 defeat at the
hands of No. 3 California (10-1), the Stanford men had
outscored their opponents 31-7 in the first period of play
and 58-21 during the first half.
However, the Cardinal were unable to replicate that
early success in their contest against the Golden Bears and
found themselves fighting from behind before ultimately
falling.
The Cal offense, led by junior John Mann,came out blaz
ing, tallying two goals within the first three minutes of the
game. Junior Marty Matthies opened the scoring at 6:28 in
the opening period, and soon thereafter Mann capitalized
on the Bear's six-on-five advantage to notch his first goal of
the day.
