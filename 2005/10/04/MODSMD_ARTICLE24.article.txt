# Design Institute opens doors
## 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a $35 million pledge from
software developer Hasso Plattner,
yesterday the University officially
launched a new, cross-discipline de
sign institute on campus that com
bines intellectual rigor with the am
bition to solve social problems — big
and small — in an elegant and user
friendly fashion.
Consistent with Stanford's long
standing emphasis on interdiscipli
nary teaching and research, the
Hasso Plattner Institute of Design —
fondly nicknamed the d.school —
will bring together students and fac
ulty members from a broad spectrum
of expertise and experience. Mem
bers of the graduate schools of engi
neering, education, business, medi
cine and the humanities will work in
teams and seek to devise solutions
from multifaceted perspectives.
"Design is about meeting human
needs," said Engineering Prof. David
Kelley, who will lead the Institute, in
a press release. "Design thinking is
about bringing together strong, col
laborative teams from engineering,
social sciences and business to dis
cover innovations at the intersec
tions of these disciplines. This type of
radical collaboration has been pow
erful and well received by students
and faculty alike."
The Institute will first help stu
dents identify and understand a
problem — the limitations that
autistic children face at school, for
example. Students will then be sent
to observe their subjects and quickly
attempt to construct a solution
model. The students will continue to
improve upon their first draft in the
problem-solving process.
In a prototype class that began
two years ago, a group of students
and faculty collaborated with the
Light-up the World Foundation to
design LED-based lamps for bright,
low-cost lighting to replace the dan
gerous and expensive kerosene
lamps that are widely used in devel
oping countries.
The d.school is also toying with
such ideas as making air travel and
waiting in line more enjoyable, and is
even designing measures to mini
mize drunk driving. It is also contem
plating what design can do to im
prove K-12 education.

The pledge from Plattner, who co
founded the renowned business soft
ware company SAP, will take place
over three years, meeting more than
half of the University's fundraising
goal for the institute. The donation
will help pay for the complete remod
eling of the 47,000-square-foot Peter
son Building on West campus, re
search and other program expenses
"I'm delighted about the oppor
tunities the Hasso Plattner Institute
of Design will offer our students and

faculty," University President John
Hennessy said in the same press re
lease. "From its earliest days, Stan
ford has encouraged intellectual ex
change between the University and
industry. The institute's emphasis on
meeting human needs through mul
tidisciplinary collaboration contin
ues this tradition. Thanks to the gen
erosity of Hasso Plattner, Stanford
will be able to re-think our approach
to design and explore problems in
new ways."
