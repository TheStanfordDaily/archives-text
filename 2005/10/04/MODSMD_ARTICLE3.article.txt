### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
For the past year, a committee consisting of Stan
ford faculty and students has met to discuss leader
ship opportunities on campus. This committee,
named the Stanford Collaborative Leadership Pro
gram, has just launched its Web site and program â€”
serving as a gateway to on-campus leadership roles.
According to Morris Graves, associate dean of
students and leader of the new program, the past
year was spent evaluating leadership on campus.
"This committee has been meeting for 14 months
and we are nearing the end of Phase I." Graves said
in an interview with The Daily. "Last year was spent
talking to people with vested interest in leadership,
including members of the Athletic Department, the
Graduate Student Council (GSC), the Associated
Students of Stanford University (ASSU), voluntary
student organizations (VSOs), the Haas Center for
Public Service and Vaden Health Center's Peer
Mentor Program."
