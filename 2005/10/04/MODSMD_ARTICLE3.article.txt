## New program encourages leadership Web site will feature leadership opportunities for students 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
For the past year, a committee consisting of Stan
ford faculty and students has met to discuss leader
ship opportunities on campus. This committee,
named the Stanford Collaborative Leadership Pro
gram, has just launched its Web site and program —
serving as a gateway to on-campus leadership roles.
According to Morris Graves, associate dean of
students and leader of the new program, the past
year was spent evaluating leadership on campus.
"This committee has been meeting for 14 months
and we are nearing the end of Phase I." Graves said
in an interview with The Daily. "Last year was spent
talking to people with vested interest in leadership,
including members of the Athletic Department, the
Graduate Student Council (GSC), the Associated
Students of Stanford University (ASSU), voluntary
student organizations (VSOs), the Haas Center for
Public Service and Vaden Health Center's Peer
Mentor Program."
After taking a close look at the
leadership opportunities available
on campus, the committee decided
to divide them into three subdivi
sions, each of which concentrated
on certain aspects of the program.
Carolus Brown, the assistant di
rector of the Black Community
Services Center (BCSC) leads the
subcommittee that focuses on
studying leadership programs at
other universities. Associate Dean
of Students and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe runs the sec
ond committee, which looks into
student activities on campus that
involve leadership. The third sub
committee is led by Graves and
concentrates on leadership within
Stanford's curriculum — both in
discussion and practice.
The ultimate goal of the Stanford
Collaborative Leadership Program
is to develop a student leadership
base that is the envy of every institu
tion in the United States. Graves
said that there are many opportuni
ties for Stanford students to become
involved in leadership positions.
However, students are not taking
advantage of these opportunities.
"There is no centralized location
to access information for training
and development," Graves said.
"This program will provide the
tools for Stanford students to be
come active leaders. Our Web site,
http://leadership.stanford.edu, was
launched last Friday. Although this
site is still evolving, it already con
tains links to the sites of almost all
the programs on campus that pro
vide leadership opportunities."
Throughout the course of this
year, this committee will take a
close look at leadership programs
at universities across the country.
According to Graves, Stanford's
leadership program will continual
ly ask itself the question, "is there
any reason why Stanford should
not be able to develop a student
leadership program that is the top
program in the country?"
TTie committee led by Brown has
already conducted much research in
this area. According to the research,
Georgia Tech, Georgia Southern,
Vanderbilt, the University of South
Carolina and Northwestern Univer

sity are among the top institutions
for leadership programs.
"We are still putting much ef
fort into getting this information
out to the student body," Graves
said. "While we continue to com
pare leadership programs at vari
ous universities, we believe our
preliminary efforts to create a cen
ter for on-campus leadership op
portunities will benefit students
within the first year. We are very
excited, and hope that more stu
dents become aware of the abun
dant leadership opportunities here
at Stanford."
Seniors Kosha Shah and Claire
Schmidt both currently hold lead
ership positions on campus. Shah,
the president of the Basmati Raas
dance team, said that she saw the
program as a good opportunity for
incoming freshman.
"This Web site will provide a
way for students to find out about
activities on campus," she said.
"Other than the Activities Fair,
there are not that many opportuni
ties for freshmen to hear about on
campus programs. However, 1 don't

think the Web site should be
thought of as a way to centralize
leadership positions — a 'job
search' for leadership roles. People
should become leaders because
they have a passion for that partic
ular organization, not because they
found there was an opening in an
other club. True leaders arise in
areas they have a strong interest in
and should be able to find that
place for themselves."
Schmidt, the president of Habi
tat for Humanity, said she felt this
Web site would be very valuable for
organizations like Habitat, where
there are only a few leaders and a
large number of members.
"If a leadership opportunity
does not arise in one particular or
ganization, this gives students with
a passion for leading another
chance," Schmidt said. "At the same
time, clubs like Habitat — where it
is hard to see who is best suited for
leadership because of the high
numbers of people and low num
bers of builds — will be able to find
people that are suited to handle
leadership commitments."
