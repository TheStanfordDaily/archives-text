# Policy under Fire

### ANDREW BURMON 
Yesterday at 11:20 a.m., two
baffled looking Army recruiters
from the Judge Advocate Gener
al's Office of the United States
Navy (JAG) stood in the court
yard of the Stanford Law School.
By 11:45 a.m., the courtyard was
filled with 60 protesters, some in
camouflage, others in collared
shirts, their mouths shut with duct
tape saying "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell. 'The protesters marched in a
wide circle and shouted slogans.
"What do we want?" yelled

one protester.
"Equality," responded the rest.
"When do we want it?"
"Now."
The demonstration, which was
organized by OUTLAW, a group
of law students headed by two sec
ond year students, Spencer Jones
and Michael Angelo, was aimed at
protesting the Army's LGBT pol
icy, the Solomon Amendment and
what they perceive as the Univer
sity's failure to take a stand against
the amendment.
The Solomon Amendment,
which originally passed in Con

gress in 1997, allows the federal
government to withhold funding
from universities that do not
allow the army to recruit. The sit
uation is complicated by the
army's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy, which dictates that open
homosexuality can be grounds for
discharge from the service. At
many institutions of higher learn
ing, including Stanford Law
School, a non-discriminatory re
cruitment policy is in place which
dictates that no employer can re-

cruit on campus if that employer dis
criminates based on "age, religion,
disability, ethnic background, na
tional origin, gender, race, sexual ori
entation or veteran status."
The issue of JAG recruitment did
not come to a head before this year
because of the Law School's policy
that at least five students must show
an interest in a recruiter in order for
that recruiter to interview on cam
pus. Even after obtaining interest
from five students, the recruiters'
presence was only tolerated because
of the Solomon Amendment.
University policy also protested
states that no employer can be "ille
gally" discriminatory. The military's
policy to "discharge members who
engage in homosexual conduct,"
constitutes legal discrimination.
Jones, however, was not interest
ed in issues of legality.

"As we see it."he said,"Discrimi
nation is discrimination."
Junior Bharat Venkat agreed.
"1 wish Stanford would take more
of a stand," he said.
Venkat, Jones and other protest
ers voiced disappointment in Uni
versity President John Hennessy
for not signing a suit challenging
the constitutionality of the amend
ment launched by several other ac
ademic institutions, including Har
vard. Cornell and Columbia. That
case, Rumsfeld v. The Forum for
Academic Rights, or FAIR, should
reach the Supreme Court by mid-
October.
"2-4-6-8," shouted the protesters.
"Stanford should not discriminate "
As the demonstration came to an
end, two speakers were introduced.
The first junior Stephen Funk, a first
year transfer student, served in the
Marine Corps as an openly gay man.
Funk described "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" as an excuse for "intolerance
and hate." Funk, who has yet to be
discharged, rallied the crowd who
cheered loudly for the next speaker.

the Dean of the Law School Prof.
Larry Kramer.
Kramer also condemned "Don't
Ask. Don't Tell," comparing the pol
icy to Jim Crow laws and reminding
the crowd that "history and demo
graphics point inexorably towards
change." Kramer finished by reading
a statement written by Hennessy, a
name which prompted boos and
hisses from the assembled crowd.
The statement conceded that JAG
recruitment was"in contradiction"
with Stanford policy.
"1 am pleased that our students
are making their voices heard on this
issue," said Hennessy in the state
ment.
As the protesters left, they
leaned their picket signs up against
the side of room 172, where the JAG
recruiters were supposed to be con
ducting interviews. "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell. Don't Recruit," read one
sign.
Inside, the lights were off and the
recruiters were nowhere to be
found.The posted schedule for inter
view times was conspicuously empty.
