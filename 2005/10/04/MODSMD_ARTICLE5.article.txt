# CAMPUS LIFE
## Ramadan to kick off tomorrow 
### MARINA LIEBAN STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow marks the start of Ramadan, the ninth
month of the Islamic calendar. Muslims around the
world will abstain from eating or drinking during day
light hours for the entire month, which ends on Nov. 4
this year.
As part of Ramadan, the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University (ISSU) will partner with Stanford
Dining to provide fasting students with free meals in
Tresidder Memorial

Union. The meals,
known as "iftarswill
be served nightly
throughout the month,
following evening
prayers in the Nitery.
Last year was the first
year ISSU worked
with Stanford Dining
to formally organize
the meals.
"Last year's format
worked very well and
was very convenient, so
we will continue work
ing with Stanford Din
ing as they have been
so helpful to us," said
ISSU President Mehdi
Javanmard, a fourth
year graduate student
in electrical engineer
ing. "We really appreci
ate the support they
have given us through
out the years."
Other than provid
ing iftars to fasting stu
dents, ISSU, along with
the Muslim Students
Awareness Network
(MSAN), plans to hold
several other events
throughout Ramadan.

ISSU is holding its annual
fasting event to raise
funds for a Bay Area non
profit organization.

On Oct. 6, ISSU and
MSAN will collaborate with Students Taking Action
Now: Darfur (STAND) to coordinate the Darfur Fast.
Participating students will fast for one day in order to
raise money for the displaced people and refugees in
the Darfur region of Sudan.
On Saturday, Oct. 15, ISSU and MSAN will bring
an interfaith panel discussion titled "Jesus Across
Faiths" to campus. The Christian, Jewish and Muslim
perspectives of Jesus are the focus of the discussion
with the goal being to increase communication and
understanding between the three religions.
The final event for the month will be the annual
Fastathon inTresidder Union on Oct. 23. Besides rais
ing money for local charities, the purpose of the Fas
tathon also includes increasing general awareness
about Islam.
"We'll be holding our annual Fas
tathon with the goal of not only rais
ing money," Javanmard said. "But
also with the aim of sharing the Ra
madan experience with the local
community in order to create more
awareness regarding the religion of
Islam, which is so often misunder
stood by people in this country."
All Ramadan events are open to
the entire Stanford community and
both Muslim and non-Muslim stu
dents are encouraged to attend.
"This year, we are doing our best
to share the wonderful experience of

Ramadan with the whole Stanford
community," Javanmard said. "We
hope that by joining us in this fast
during the month of Ramadan, we
will have taken a step towards unify
ing the local community to not only
fight poverty and hunger, but also ig
norance towards each other's reli
gions and ways of life."
If non-Muslim students or stu
dents who choose not to fast would
like to join an iftar. they may get a
ticket from an ISSU officer.
"Ideally, we'd love to provide free
meals for the entire Stanford com
munity during Ramadan, but be
cause of budgeting constraints, we're
not able to every day of the month,"
said sophomore Sanah Parvez, the
ISSU treasurer. "But we'd love to
have evervone come break fast with

us at our events, especially during the
FastaThon, because we really want
to share the message and spirit of
Ramadan with the Stanford commu
nity."
The other three events are open
to the public. To learn more about
Ramadan events and how to partici
pate, students can e-mail issu-offi
