# CAMPUS LIFE
## Ramadan to kick off tomorrow 
### MARINA LIEBAN STAFF WRITER 
Tomorrow marks the start of Ramadan, the ninth
month of the Islamic calendar. Muslims around the
world will abstain from eating or drinking during day
light hours for the entire month, which ends on Nov. 4
this year.
As part of Ramadan, the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University (ISSU) will partner with Stanford
Dining to provide fasting students with free meals in
Tresidder Memorial

Union. The meals,
known as "iftarswill
be served nightly
throughout the month,
following evening
prayers in the Nitery.
Last year was the first
year ISSU worked
with Stanford Dining
to formally organize
the meals.
"Last year's format
worked very well and
was very convenient, so
we will continue work
ing with Stanford Din
ing as they have been
so helpful to us," said
ISSU President Mehdi
Javanmard, a fourth
year graduate student
in electrical engineer
ing. "We really appreci
ate the support they
have given us through
out the years."
Other than provid
ing iftars to fasting stu
dents, ISSU, along with
the Muslim Students
Awareness Network
(MSAN), plans to hold
several other events
throughout Ramadan.
