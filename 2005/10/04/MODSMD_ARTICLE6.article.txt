# SigEp remains on alcohol suspension

### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Sigma Phi Epsilon fraterni
ty remains on alcohol suspension this fall,
following an incident that involved drink
ing in White Plaza last spring.
The suspension resulted from the be
havior of two fraternity members who
have since graduated from Stanford, ac
cording to SigEp President Ryan Denny,
Class of 2005.
"The actions of the two gentlemen in
question do not reflect the culture of our
fraternity," Denny said. "We're working
with the University to make sure this
doesn't happen again. The suspension is
not a punishment, but a precautionary
measure on the part of the administration
until it can verify that SigEp does not con
done such careless behavior."
Alcohol and drinking games are pro
hibited in the University's public spaces.
But SigEp's alcohol suspension is one
step beyond the University's alcohol pro
bation policy. An organization under alco

hoi probation can still hold parties where
alcohol is served, but they are under
stricter surveillance and subject to harsh
er penalties if rules are violated.
An alcohol suspension prohibits alco
hol at gatherings of more than five stu
dents.
Sigma Epsilon's alcohol-policy woes
are not unusual for Greek organizations
on campus. Several serious incidents in re
cent years have led to high-profile alcohol
probations, suspensions and the revoca

tion of housing charters for many sorori
ties and fraternities.
The Delta Delta Delta sorority was
also on alcohol suspension until last June,
following allegations of binge drinking
and sexual assault at a pledge event in
May 2004. In 2003, the fraternity Sigma
Alpha Epsilon was placed on alcohol sus
pension fora quarter and alcohol proba
tion fora year after a pledge was sent to
the hospital for alcohol abuse.
However, the situation between Greek

Life and University administrators has
shown improvement in recent years. The
number of Judicial Affairs hearings
brought before the Organizational Con
duct Board involving Greek organiza
tions has dropped from a high in the 2002-
2003 school year, due to what Associate
Dean of Students Morris Graves last
spring called "good-faith efforts" and an
increased respect for health and safety.
Graves declined to speak to The Daily
about SigEp's status.
