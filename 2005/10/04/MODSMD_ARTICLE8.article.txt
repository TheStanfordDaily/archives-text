WASHINGTON — President
Bush nominated White House coun
sel Harriet Miers to the Supreme
Court yesterday, turning to a lawyer
who has never been a judge to re
place Sandra Day O'Connor and
help reshape the nation's judiciary.
"She has devoted her life to the
rule of law and the cause of justice,"
Bush said as his first Supreme Court
pick. Chief Justice John Roberts,
took the bench for the first time just
a few blocks from the White House.
If confirmed by the Republican
controlled Senate, Miers, 60, would
join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as
the second woman on the nation's
highest court and the third to serve
there. Miers was the first woman to
serve as president of the Texas State
Bar and the Dallas Bar Association.
Senate Majority Leader Bill
Frist outlined a timetable calling
for confirmation by Thanksgiving
— a tight timetable by recent stan
dards that allowed less than eight
weeks for lawmakers to review her
record, hold hearings and vote. Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee,
made no commitment, saying he
wanted a thorough confirmation
proceeding.
O'Connor has been the court's
majority maker in dozens of contro
versial cases in recent years, casting
deciding votes that upheld the 1973
ruling that established the constitu
tional right to an abortion, sustaining
affirmative action programs and lim
iting the application of the death
penalty.
Within hours of Bush's announce

ment in the Oval Office, Miers trav
elled to the Capitol to begin courtesy
calls on the senators who will vote on
her nomination.
Frist, R-Tenn., was first on the list.
His welcome was a statement in
praise. "With this selection, the pres
ident has chosen another outstand
ing nominee to sit on our nation's
highest court,"it said.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry
Reid was complimentary, issuing a
statement that said he likes Miers
and adding "the Supreme Court
would benefit from the addition of a
justice who has real experience as a
practicing lawyer."
At the same time, he said he
looked forward to the "process
which will help the American people
learn more about Harriet Miers, and
help the Senate determine whether
she deserves a lifetime seat on the
Supreme Court."
Reid had personally recom
mended that Bush consider Miers
for nomination, according to several
sources familiar with the president's
consultations with individual sena
tors. Of equal importance as the
White House maps its confirmation
campaign is that the Nevada Demo
crat had warned Bush that the selec
tion of any of several other con
tenders could trigger a bruising par
tisan struggle.
Other Democrats sounded any
thing but conciliatory. "The presi
dent has selected a loyal political ally
without a judicial record to sit on the
highest court in the land," said Sen.
Barbara Boxer. D-Calif.
Republican strategists who spoke
on condition of anonymity said they
would have to work hard to assure
the support of some of the more con

servative Republicans in the Senate,
particularly on the issue of abortion.
All 55 GOP senators voted to con
firm Roberts.
Little is known publicly about
Miers' position on abortion, an issue
of surpassing importance to outside
groups on both ends of the political
spectrum.
When delegates to a national

American Bar Association conven
tion adopted a position in favor of
abortion rights in 1992, she worked
as head of the Texas state bar to force
a reconsideration of the issue by sub
mitting it to a referendum by the
360,000-membership. "This issue has
brought on tremendous divisiveness
and loss of membership..." she said in
early 1993.
