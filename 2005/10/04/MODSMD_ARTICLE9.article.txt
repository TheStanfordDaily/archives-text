STOCKHOLM, Sweden â€” Australians Barry J. Marshall and Robin
Warren won the 2005 Nobel Prize in medicine yesterday for showing that
bacterial infection, not stress, was to blame for painful ulcers in the stom
ach and intestine.
The 1982 discovery transformed peptic ulcer disease from a chronic,
frequently disabling condition to one that can be cured by a short regimen
of antibiotics and other medicines, the Nobel Prize committee said.
Thanks to their work, it has now been established that the bacterium
Helicobacter pylori, which the new Nobel winners discovered, is the most
common cause of peptic ulcers.
After proposing that idea, Marshall and Warren had to persevere in
the face of skepticism. Marshall even deliberately infected himself with
the bacterium in 1985 and showed it caused stomach inflammation, a po
tential precursor of an ulcer.
The Australians' idea was "very much against prevailing knowledge
and dogma because it was thought that peptic ulcer disease was the result
of stress and lifestyle," Staffan Normark, a member of the Nobel Assem
bly at the Karolinska institute, said at a news conference.
Warren told The Associated Press that it took a decade for others to
accept their findings.
"For about a hundred years, or a thousand years, the standard teach
ing in medicine was that... the stomach was sterile and nothing grew there
because of corrosive gastric juices," he said. "So everybody believed there
were no bacteria in the stomach."
"When I said they were there, no one believed it,"he added.
Marshall said the pair began working together in 1981. "After about three
years we were pretty convinced that these bacteria were important in ul
cers and it was a frustrating time for the next 10 years though because no
body believed us," he said.
"The idea of stress and things like that was just so entrenched nobody
could really believe that it was bacteria. It had to come from some weird
place like Perth, Western Australia because I think nobody else would
have even considered it."
Marshall, 54, and Warren, 68, celebrated their new honor with cham
pagne and beer.
"Obviously, it's the best thing that can ever happen to somebody in
medical research. It's just incredible," Marshall told said by telephone
from the Western Australia state capital. Perth, where the pair were cele
brating with family members.
Warren said he was "very excited also a little overcome," at the honor.
The discovery has stimulated research into microbes as possible rea
sons for other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease,
ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis, the assembly
said in its citation.
