Sextons and the City?
Well, no, not exactly.
How about Sextons and Stanford Memorial Church? It may not be the latest TV craze, but it is an opportunity to make
some extra cash and hang out in one of the most beautiful spots on campus!

Sextons work in Stanford Memorial Church ensuring that church programs, including Sunday morning University Public worship, weddings,
memorial services, Sunday evening Compline, and concerts run smoothly. Responsibilities include setting up the church, roping off pews,
lighting candles, asking tourists to honor any program in progress by returning after its conclusion, and locking and securing the church
following services, etc.
But wait, there's more!
This is a paying gig, plus you get to eat fresh, buttery cookies and wear a cool maroon robe! If this sounds like the right opportunity for you,
please call for more information: 650-723-1762.
