A Conversation
with
The Rev. Joanne Sanders
Associate Dean for Religious Life
Wednesday, October 5, 6:00-7:00 pm,
LGBT Community Resources Center
An "out" Episcopal priest, Joanne discusses what it means to live at
this intersection of faith and identity, which so many consider a paradox.
Join this exploration of issues concerning Queer spirituality, including:
how to live a life that's true to sexual identity, as well as faith-based
identity; understanding the scriptural texts so often used to persecute
and exclude homosexuals; and how to enact change within the broad
er LGBTQ and faith communities to which we belong.
Students only; please.
