## Sketchy and nice—not mutually exclusive 
### 
Last year I went through a bit of a
"Freshman 15" experience when I
dated a freshman for about 15 days. It
wasn't an entirely negative experience, but as
a first-year graduate student, I slowly began
to discover that his fellow undergraduate
friends thought I was a bit...well, sketchy.
And 1 was, so that's okay.
But once the relationship was over (trans
lation: he broke up with me on Instant Mes
senger), I began to hear whispers of other
sketchy graduate students before I discov
ered that, on the whole, the term "sketchy" is
often used to describe the graduate student
population by non-sketchy undergraduates.
Now, 1 fully admit to my sketch-factor. In
fact, I've long since embraced it. However, 1
don't know that the term adequately de
scribes some of the friends I've made in grad
uate school at Stanford, many of whom are
completely sketch-free (and top scholars in
their fields).
As far as I can tell, the term is often — but
not always — used endearingly. An endearing
example would be something like, "Oh, that
sketchy graduate student looks so cute in his
bike helmet. I also admire his matching pock
et protector; what a delightful little accessory!"
A less-endearing example would be
something like, "Oh, that sketchy graduate
student just looked at me. I feel superior to
him merely because of the fact that I'm
younger. I wish they would go away and be
sketchy somewhere else — me and my
friends are young and without any sketch of
which to speak!"
Thankfully, with the opening of The 750
(side note: the lame name of the pub in the
Graduate Community Center doesn't help
my anti-sketch argument, I know this), we
have a place to go. Why then, when I go
there, am I surrounded by undergraduates?
The reason: "Sketchy" as we may be, we
have a good place to drink.
Now, if we go under the assumption that
the undergraduates at The 750 are all of
drinking age and thus are there for the alco
hol alone, isn't it unfortunate that they would
have to stoop so low that they would actual
ly have to endure our company just to get
some booze? Yet 1 see them there enjoying
themselves harmoniously with the sketchiest
of booze-guzzling graduate students. Ho
mosaywhat's up with that?
The truth is, I don't think our age, degrees
or turf (living areas, community centers, etc.)
are what separates the undergraduate and
graduate student populations. In my opinion,
our sketch-divided attitudes come from the
fact that there are very few places on the Stan
ford campus where all students feel comfort
able getting a beer and making new friends.
So, to the undergraduates at Stanford I
say, "Welcome." Come to The 750 and have
a beer. All we ask is that when you speak of
us as sketchy, that you remember that we
treat you nicely when you're at our pub.
Maybe one of us sketchy grad students
will even try to get you drunk and take you
back to our luxurious Escondido Village low
rise apartments.

If you want to get a beer at The 750, e-mail bad
wound@stanford.edu any time, just leave the
anti-sketch spray at home.
