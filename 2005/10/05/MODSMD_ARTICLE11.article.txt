# Grads Get Their Groove On
## Graduate dance group facilitates communication, camaraderie 
### ILENA C GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During his undergraduate career at UC-Berkeley,
Ryan Louie, a San Francisco-native and current
sixth-year medical student in Stanford's MD-
Phl) program, tried to pimp out science — he helped es
tablish "SHM:Simple Harmonix in Motion," a rap group
dedicated to belting out chemistry-related tunes.
"By creating raps about chemical reactions and sci
ence wonders, we at SUM feel that our music has more to
offer in the sense of letting people know that "science is
cool," Louie wrote in a letter to the journal Science in
1999."With the production of our first chemistry rap sin
gle, "Drop da Base (And PUMP UP da pH!),"our audi
ences not only get an introduction to acid-base chemistry
but also an open invitation to engage in the world of sci
ence that is so much a part of our everyday lives."
To SUM's chagrin, however, a peer reviewer of one of
the group's rap videos complained that it "lacked mo
tion," Louie says. Thus, Louie and his friends decided to
delve into the world of hip-hop dance, and Louie's inter
est in rockiir' to the beat has continued through to his
graduate career — he is among the four founders of
Soul'd Out, Stanford's grad-student-oriented hip-hop
dance group, which kicked off in February 2005. The other
founding members are medical students Sarah Ratana
sopa, Kelly Thong and Dustin Bermudez.
While Soul'd Out does not include techie-rap in its
repertoire. Louie says he sees connections between the
group and SUM.
"Science and also music, including hip-hop, both involve
forms of communication which transcend boundaries," he
remarks. "Hip-hop is about innovation, about developing
new styles and new moves. As grad students, we always want
to show what's new. to take it to the next level. That's how

science should be. That's how hip-hop should be."
There are roughly 20 active members of Soul'd Out.
but anyone can participate, according to Louie.The group
debuted at last year's An Art Affair. Although the actual
group of performers currently consists of only seven
members — mostly medical students — more than 100
students subscribe to the group's e-mail list, and grad stu
dents of all disciplines attend Soul'd Out's open dance
sessions, Louie says.
He explains that Soul'd Out's main purpose is to pro
vide a fun and flexible way for graduate students to enjoy
hip-hop dance, while also having the opportunity to exer
cise and perform.
"We have no auditions and people are free to come by
our dance sessions to meet students from other depart
ments and learn some dance moves," he adds.
Sarah Ratansopa — who originally came up with the
idea for the group then brought the other three founders
on board — further explains that Soul'd Out has three
main tenets: that the group should be open to all graduate
students, that participation in the group means a lower
level of commitment than other groups (so that more stu
dents are able to take part) and that group members
would contribute their own choreography to the group.
Louie elaborates on the last part of the group's philoso
phy.saying,"ln learning new procedures in medical school,
there is the classic mantra of'see one, do one, teach one.' It
is with this same philosophy that we encourage students to
contribute and share their ideas for Soul'd Out I lip-I lop."
The group practices on weekends, and each practice
teaches participants a new set of moves. As members are
familiar with many different styles of hip-hop, the group
has a wide variety of styles from which to draw material.
If you'd like to see the group for yourself. Soul'd Out's
next performance will be Thursday, Oct. 6 at Cantor's
Partv on the Edue.

"We have no auditions and people are free to come by
our dance sessions to meet students from other depart
ments and learn some dance moves," he adds.
Sarah Ratansopa — who originally came up with the
idea for the group then brought the other three founders
on board — further explains that Soul'd Out has three
main tenets: that the group should be open to all graduate
students, that participation in the group means a lower
level of commitment than other groups (so that more stu
dents are able to take part) and that group members
would contribute their own choreography to the group.
Louie elaborates on the last part of the group's philoso
phy.saying,"ln learning new procedures in medical school,
there is the classic mantra of'see one, do one, teach one.' It
is with this same philosophy that we encourage students to
contribute and share their ideas for Soul'd Out I lip-I lop."
The group practices on weekends, and each practice
teaches participants a new set of moves. As members are
familiar with many different styles of hip-hop, the group
has a wide variety of styles from which to draw material.
If you'd like to see the group for yourself. Soul'd Out's
next performance will be Thursday, Oct. 6 at Cantor's
Partv on the Edue.

Soul'd Out, above, is a grad-student-oriented hip-hop group, launched in February 2005. Pictured in the back iow (left to right) are: Jen Erhart, James Chu, Kelly Thong, Jenise Wong, Dustin Bermudez and
Ryan Louie. Pictured in the front row (left to right) are Qi Liao, Jennifer Shieh, Rajiv Agarwal, Shu-An Lin, Ashwini Doshi and Sarah Ratanasopa.
During his undergraduate career at UC-Berkeley,
Ryan Louie, a San Francisco-native and current
sixth-year medical student in Stanford's MD-
Phl) program, tried to pimp out science — he helped es
tablish "SHM:Simple Harmonix in Motion," a rap group
dedicated to belting out chemistry-related tunes.
"By creating raps about chemical reactions and sci
ence wonders, we at SUM feel that our music has more to
offer in the sense of letting people know that "science is
cool," Louie wrote in a letter to the journal Science in
1999."With the production of our first chemistry rap sin
gle, "Drop da Base (And PUMP UP da pH!),"our audi
ences not only get an introduction to acid-base chemistry
but also an open invitation to engage in the world of sci
ence that is so much a part of our everyday lives."
To SUM's chagrin, however, a peer reviewer of one of
the group's rap videos complained that it "lacked mo
tion," Louie says. Thus, Louie and his friends decided to
delve into the world of hip-hop dance, and Louie's inter
est in rockiir' to the beat has continued through to his
graduate career — he is among the four founders of
Soul'd Out, Stanford's grad-student-oriented hip-hop
dance group, which kicked off in February 2005. The other
founding members are medical students Sarah Ratana
sopa, Kelly Thong and Dustin Bermudez.
While Soul'd Out does not include techie-rap in its
repertoire. Louie says he sees connections between the
group and SUM.
"Science and also music, including hip-hop, both involve
forms of communication which transcend boundaries," he
remarks. "Hip-hop is about innovation, about developing
new styles and new moves. As grad students, we always want
to show what's new. to take it to the next level. That's how

science should be. That's how hip-hop should be."
There are roughly 20 active members of Soul'd Out.
but anyone can participate, according to Louie.The group
debuted at last year's An Art Affair. Although the actual
group of performers currently consists of only seven
members — mostly medical students — more than 100
students subscribe to the group's e-mail list, and grad stu
dents of all disciplines attend Soul'd Out's open dance
sessions, Louie says.
He explains that Soul'd Out's main purpose is to pro
vide a fun and flexible way for graduate students to enjoy
hip-hop dance, while also having the opportunity to exer
cise and perform.
"We have no auditions and people are free to come by
our dance sessions to meet students from other depart
ments and learn some dance moves," he adds.
