# STAR PROFILE
## RYAN LOUIE 
### 
Louie's interests transcend science, music and
dance. In addition to studying the sciences as
an undergraduate, he majored in East Asian
Languages at Berkeley.
Following his graduation from Cal. Louie spent
a year with the Fulbright Program doing cell biol
ogy research at Kobe University's Biosignal Re
search Center in Japan.
"It was a wonderful experience to learn not just
the science itself, but also to learn about working
together with different people in a culture outside
of our own," he comments. "I feel very thankful for
these opportunities, and I hope that I can someday
provide similar experiences to new groups of stu
dents and their communities."
Louie now conducts most of his studies in Stan
ford's Department of Molecular and Cellular Phys
iology'. He says he is studying "the architecture of
cells," which is commonly known as the cytoskele
ton. More specifically, Louie is observing the ways in
which certain microscopic proteins work within the
cytoskeleton to cause cell migration or movement.
In the future. Louie says he hopes to pursue a ca
reer in academic medicine, which would allow him to
participate in both clinical and research endeavors.
"I would like to see multi-disciplinary fields
come together, integrating areas such as medicine,
cell biology and nano-scale science," he says.
