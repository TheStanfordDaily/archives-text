# The 						two Silicon Valleys — Life at Stanford vs. Bangalore
## 
### 
While oceans and continents separate
my master's studies from my bach
elor's, the two are nevertheless
linked by location — 1 pursued both in a so
called Silicon Valley. I attained my bachelor's
degree in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of
India, and I just began working towards a
Management Science and Engineering mas
ter's degree here in the true Silicon Valley
But one month into my time here, 1 cannot
help but notice the differences (or are they
similarities?) between the two experiences.
FOOD
In my dorm's mess hall in India, we used
to get food like Chapattis (Indian bread),
whose Young's Modulus could be measured,
curry whose hardness could be quantified
and vegetables of extraterrestrial origin
(Spielberg would love it).
At Stanford, the picture is not very differ
ent. Neither I nor my roommate knows how
to make Chapattis, so we modestly attempt
ed to cook curry and rice for ourselves. I can
not testify to the greatness of our cooking
skills, but one thing's for sure — both of us
are excellent firefighters. We have doused
many-a-fire that erupted during our culinary

adventures. Inspired by this, we did not at
tempt to make any vegetables. Subway and
theTreehouse atTresidder Union have been
a dining haven since. (I hope someone reads
this and invites us for dinner or lunch!)
CULTURE
You would be the talk of the town if you
came to my college in Bangalore wearing
shorts. Your parents would be called to meet
the dean and you would be looked down
upon as a social deviant or someone who
generally disrespects the value of education.
I don't understand, however, how the length
of your attire is proportional to your respect
and dedication. If you are a girl and have
committed this shorts-donning blunder, you

may be reprimanded, hut at least your male
classmates would support your decision and
encourage you to wear shorts more frequent
ly!
At Stanford, people do not care, nor do
they bother, to notice what their classmates
are wearing. As long as it is not vulgar, most
people on the Farm are very tolerant of oth
ers' fashion sense and the backgrounds from
which they hail.
EDUCATION SYSTEM
While I went to college in Bangalore, East
India is my native home, a good 36-hour train
journey from Bangalore. Despite the dis
tance, I have been home a miraculous 36
times in the past four years, averaging nine
times per year and once every 40 days —
each visit lasting about a fortnight. This
speaks volumes about my attendance in
classes and I still managed to bag the "Best
Outgoing Student" award for my batch. My
friends and I rarely attended classes, so my
only "extracurricular activity" consisted of
finishing assignments (Oops...copying as
signments. At my college. I redefined the
honor code a bit.). A few professors were re
ally legendary, but my belief that self-educa

tion is the best form of learning, prevented
me from attending classes.
Professors at Stanford are exceptional in
their fields and a lot of stress is placed on pro
viding practical examples and applications of
their work. Everything is related to real-life
experiences, making the education process
very intuitive. I lere,people religiously attend
classes and jot down a professor's every
word. But thanks to the concept of video
recording, people like me retain their faith in
the concept of self help and bunk classes/The
other day 1 asked someone to let me have a
look at their homework fora jiffy. Their
stares made me feel that 1 had committed
murder. That person gave me a long lecture
on the Stanford Honor Code and had me
vow that I shall never ever do this in my en
tire stay at Stanford. People do not under
stand that if I do not violate the I lonor Code,
my grades would strip me of my honor.
RELATIONSHIPS
If you are caught with your boyfriend or
girlfriend at an Indian college, the whole stu
dent body will know about it within an hour
(and likely e-mail the news to a local daily
newspaper). People will pass secret glances

at you and make you feel so embarrassed
that you might even second-guess your
choice to become involved in the relation
ship to begin with. I know many friends who
claimed they didn't have a girlfriend just be
cause they couldn't tolerate back-biting
about their significant others. Actually, they
never managed to get a girlfriend, hence the
justification.
But at Stanford, people are extremely
open-minded about relationships. To be hon
est. many of my Indian friends have ditched
their single status within a month of coming
to the United States. They have asked girls
out for dates and have formed loving cou
ples, which I am sure they would have never
been able to do in India.
The whole newspaper is not big enough to
hold the differences between the two sys
tems. I 'm not trying to compare them or rank
one against the other. I may have given you a
conservative view of the Indian education
system, but one thing that will always remain
true to me is that it was my undergraduate
education in India that prepared me for Stan
ford. I really miss my days on the other side
of the Pacific, but I also look forward to my
years on the Farm.

At Stanford, the picture is not very differ
ent. Neither I nor my roommate knows how
to make Chapattis, so we modestly attempt
ed to cook curry and rice for ourselves. I can
not testify to the greatness of our cooking
skills, but one thing's for sure — both of us
are excellent firefighters. We have doused
many-a-fire that erupted during our culinary

adventures. Inspired by this, we did not at
tempt to make any vegetables. Subway and
theTreehouse atTresidder Union have been
a dining haven since. (I hope someone reads
this and invites us for dinner or lunch!)
CULTURE
You would be the talk of the town if you
came to my college in Bangalore wearing
shorts. Your parents would be called to meet
the dean and you would be looked down
upon as a social deviant or someone who
generally disrespects the value of education.
I don't understand, however, how the length
of your attire is proportional to your respect
and dedication. If you are a girl and have
committed this shorts-donning blunder, you

may be reprimanded, hut at least your male
classmates would support your decision and
encourage you to wear shorts more frequent
ly!
At Stanford, people do not care, nor do
they bother, to notice what their classmates
are wearing. As long as it is not vulgar, most
people on the Farm are very tolerant of oth
ers' fashion sense and the backgrounds from
which they hail.
EDUCATION SYSTEM
While I went to college in Bangalore, East
India is my native home, a good 36-hour train
journey from Bangalore. Despite the dis
tance, I have been home a miraculous 36
times in the past four years, averaging nine
times per year and once every 40 days —
each visit lasting about a fortnight. This
speaks volumes about my attendance in
classes and I still managed to bag the "Best
Outgoing Student" award for my batch. My
friends and I rarely attended classes, so my
only "extracurricular activity" consisted of
finishing assignments (Oops...copying as
signments. At my college. I redefined the
honor code a bit.). A few professors were re
ally legendary, but my belief that self-educa

tion is the best form of learning, prevented
me from attending classes.
Professors at Stanford are exceptional in
their fields and a lot of stress is placed on pro
viding practical examples and applications of
their work. Everything is related to real-life
experiences, making the education process
very intuitive. I lere,people religiously attend
classes and jot down a professor's every
word. But thanks to the concept of video
recording, people like me retain their faith in
the concept of self help and bunk classes/The
other day 1 asked someone to let me have a
look at their homework fora jiffy. Their
stares made me feel that 1 had committed
murder. That person gave me a long lecture
on the Stanford Honor Code and had me
vow that I shall never ever do this in my en
tire stay at Stanford. People do not under
stand that if I do not violate the I lonor Code,
my grades would strip me of my honor.
RELATIONSHIPS
If you are caught with your boyfriend or
girlfriend at an Indian college, the whole stu
dent body will know about it within an hour
(and likely e-mail the news to a local daily
newspaper). People will pass secret glances

at you and make you feel so embarrassed
that you might even second-guess your
choice to become involved in the relation
ship to begin with. I know many friends who
claimed they didn't have a girlfriend just be
cause they couldn't tolerate back-biting
about their significant others. Actually, they
never managed to get a girlfriend, hence the
justification.
But at Stanford, people are extremely
open-minded about relationships. To be hon
est. many of my Indian friends have ditched
their single status within a month of coming
to the United States. They have asked girls
out for dates and have formed loving cou
ples, which I am sure they would have never
been able to do in India.
The whole newspaper is not big enough to
hold the differences between the two sys
tems. I 'm not trying to compare them or rank
one against the other. I may have given you a
conservative view of the Indian education
system, but one thing that will always remain
true to me is that it was my undergraduate
education in India that prepared me for Stan
ford. I really miss my days on the other side
of the Pacific, but I also look forward to my
years on the Farm.

While oceans and continents separate
my master's studies from my bach
elor's, the two are nevertheless
linked by location — 1 pursued both in a so
called Silicon Valley. I attained my bachelor's
degree in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of
India, and I just began working towards a
Management Science and Engineering mas
ter's degree here in the true Silicon Valley
But one month into my time here, 1 cannot
help but notice the differences (or are they
similarities?) between the two experiences.
FOOD
In my dorm's mess hall in India, we used
to get food like Chapattis (Indian bread),
whose Young's Modulus could be measured,
curry whose hardness could be quantified
and vegetables of extraterrestrial origin
(Spielberg would love it).
