## Reality drifts away with the a cappella 
### 
To call Stanford a bubble would be un
fair to surface tension — the discon
nect from reality on the Farm is an im
pressive thing. Far away, and viewed
through well-frosted glass, the rest of hu
manity appears to struggle through a very
different game than the one we're playing.
Of course, most of the time, you happily
get on with your life on campus without re
alizing just how far removed you are. Most
of the time.
Occasionally, however, there are mo
ments of clarity when the absurdity of the
Wonderland surrounding you is depressing
ly apparent. For example, now.
Like a scab that's been picked too early,
the opening of the University's doors at the
start of the season exposes its bilious in
nards. And all kinds of unsavoury things
start oozing out.
Now, most you have been well indoctri
nated in the Stanford mindset, so you may
not recognize said ooze; luckily, I'm here to
help.
Enthusiasm is a terrible thing in the
wrong hands. It's blinding, and it rips
through everything in its path, tearing away
nuance and subtlety. It also comes in surpris
ingly innocuous forms. Like chalk.
I never realised chalk was a dangerous
item, a source of much mischief and sorrow.
Little, though, did I appreciate the ingenuity
of the Cardinal undergraduate.
Regular readers (who am I kidding) will
recall that I've lambasted you people about
this before. Nevertheless, this egregious
abuse of the arte de graffiti at this time of
year irritates me enough that I will repeat
myself.
Scrawling on the sidewalk has a storied
history (there are few better ways to convey
a message than allowing the world to walk
all over it), but what gets scratched onto the
campus pavement at this time of year is an
insult to that history.
"I Heart (insert dorm name here)" is the
single most pathetic thing I can imagine a
chalk-enabled young lad or lass bending
over to write. Or to put it in more youthful
language: It's lame. You should be
ashamed.

Actually, I'm being a little unfair. I saw
one mildly entertaining, if crude, piece
about a "manwich" drawn onto the Main
Quad. Sadly the artist seemed unaware of
the appropriate male/female ratio for such a
thing. Still, bonus points for effort.
Hie rest of you young'uns, however, are
either morons or busy applying your cre
ative "skills" to other things. Like a cappella.
There's a lot of singing at Stanford. In
fact, there's a quite frightening amount.
Aliens wandering around White Plaza last
week would have probably assumed that the
University was home to a many-factioned
tribal war. Complete with chanting.
In fact, it seems that every fringe group
around here prefers to do it in harmony.
Well, it's either that or people really do pre
fer singing to having fun.
Now, I'm not completely immune to the
charms of the voice, but I'm still puzzled by
just how much a cappella can exist in one
place.
What draws you all to singing? Shouldn't
you be taking drugs or something? I mean,
it's not like we're talking a rock band here;
there are no million-dollar record deals or
fawning groupies in this gig.
Perhaps I've missed out on some dramat
ic social phenomenon. Maybe, when I wasn't
looking, group singing suddenly became the
thing to do. Hey, I know I'm no longer au fait
with all the trends coursing through college
life;conceivably a good chant could be what
all the kids are after these days.
Then again, the 912 different singing
posses do seem a little excessive. Are these
groups any different? Do they just pick, like,
a different octave each? Or is it something
else that ensures that Stanford's musical
menagerie lives on?
In the end, though, whatever lies beneath
the continuing popularity, at least we can be
grateful that the often oppressed harmo
nious-but-socially-awkward-in-high-school
minority has a voice (or 10) here on the
Farm.
So vocalizing and inane chalking —it
doesn't seem like much to complain about.
They're both obviously bubbilicious, but
even so, I suppose, it could seem like I'm
pushing it.
After all, out in the real world, who
would even take the time to complain about
something so trivial? It's almost like I'm
commenting from some kind of sealed
spherical enclosure...

Like to teach the world to sing? E-mail
navins@stanford.edu to have it pointed out
that the world is tone deaf and has better things
to do.
