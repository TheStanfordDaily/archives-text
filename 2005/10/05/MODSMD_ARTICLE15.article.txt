Military policy should be debated, not
censored
In their recent Op-Ed "Why are we toler
ating discrimination?", (Oct. 3) Michael An
gelo and Spencer Jones of OUTLAW, an
LGBT support group in the Law School,
suggest that allowing military recruiters on
campus amounts to endorsing discrimina
tion.
Yet, at the same time, they speak out in
favor of a much more perniciously discrimi
natory practice: censorship.
Although many people on campus and
around the country may consider the mili
tary's practices blatantly discriminator), oth
ers, including Democratic and Republican
presidents, do not.There is a legitimate poli
cy debate to be had on the merits and costs of
gays in the military. By barring military re
cruiters from campus, the LJniversity would
shut itself out from this debate, and it would
shed its self-proclaimed mission of seeking
truth in favor of partisan fervor.
Barring military recruiters also hurts stu
dents. Bear in mind that the Navy Judge Ad
vocate General is recruiting on campus be
cause of demonstrated student interest. Whv

should the University have the prerogative
to impede its students? careers?
Ultimately, Stanford should allow re
cruiters even if the law does not demand it to,
for how can we have a free debate if every
one, including the government and voters, is
not allowed to speak his or her mind?

Antidepressants and suicide

ed Stanford grad. Class of 1999, who lost her
life to an antidepressant-induced suicide in
2002,1 wish to respond to your article on the
increase in suicides on the Stanford campus
("Student suicides increase," Oct. 3). Since
my beloved daughter's death 1 have been on
a chilling journey of discovery about the in
creased risk of suicide that occurs on antide
pressants and other psychiatric drugs.
All other means should be exhausted be
fore turning to these mind-altering drugs.
Stanford students are part of a demographic
group that has ready access to psychotropic
