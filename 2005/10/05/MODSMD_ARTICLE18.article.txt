# East Coast on the West Coast
## 
### 
I knew I was in trouble on my first day at
Stanford when, of the 90 people living in
my freshman dorm, only three admitted
to being Red Sox fans. In New England, en
tire college campuses — hell, entire cities —
go crazy each fall as the postseason ap
proaches and the Sox prepare to break our
hearts once again. Here at Stanford, though.
I can only assume that my classmates think
Johnny, Manny, Varitek and Ortiz are a
bunch of my high school buddies to whom I
am obsessively attached.
Poor judgment in sports aside, California
has been good to me in the two weeks since I
arrived. Gone are the days of making excus
es like, "But it's raining!" or,"lt's too cold!"
when I plan to go jogging. Instead, I'm actu
ally excited to lace up my sneakers fora run
among the palm trees and mission-style ar
chitecture, the bright sun on my face remind
ing me that I am now a California girl, so I
had better start acting like one.
But I've still got a long way to go. Com
pared to all the West Coast natives here, it
couldn't be more obvious that I have no clue
what it even means to be a California girl (ex
cept that the Beach Boys seem to prefer
them over girls from any other locale). But
back east, just the fact that I go to school in
California is an instant boost to my coolness
factor. To the people in my hometown, the
West Coast is clouded by an exotic mystique
that many dream of but few actually witness

firsthand. So instead, they live vicariously
through those who do — in this case, me.
And I don't blame them in the slightest; if
I weren't here myself, I'd be somewhere back
east dreaming about being out west.
Anyone who has ever lived through a
New England winter can sympathize with
what I'm saying. No, winter in the Northeast
is not like the serene pictures on postcards —
it's frigid, vicious, violent and longer than a
"Lord of the Rings" marathon. "Oh," you
may be thinking, "but with snow all winter
you can surely go skiing or snowboarding or
[insert name of winter sport here] every
day!" Well, sure, if you enjoy below-zero
wind chills and frostbitten appendages. I,
personally, do not. By the time the last snow
is melting away in late April, everybody is
cranky and irritable from spending six
months trapped inside by the snowdrifts on
their front porches.
Or it could just be that we're cantanker

ous all the time. After all, the weather's not
the only thing that's warmer here; the stereo
typical Californian is laid back and easygo
ing, which is more than can be said for us
Easterners. Fierce but aloof New Yorkers
give their city its unique attitude, and thick
skinned Bostonians distinguish Beantown as
a hard, resilient place, but, short of Disney
land, Northern California is quite possibly
the happiest place on earth. Even the Prince
ton Review recognized this when it dubbed
Stanford home of the happiest college stu
dents in the country. And it's not only the
people; everyone has seen the "Happy cows
come from California" commercials.
Maybe the sun and the palm trees really
do have an intoxicating effect on East Coast
transplants that makes us never want to go
back to our gray, dismal native coast. Or
maybe "California cool" is just a self-fulfill
ing prophecy, making everyone who comes
here feel that, in order to avoid getting the
"Oh, you must be from the East Coast" eye
roll, they have to fit the stereotypically re
laxed California attitude. But before long,
they discover that what used to be a facade
has now become a way of life, and then
there's no turning back.
Unless, of course, the Red Sox make the
playoffs. Then it's back to Boston.

Moment of Zen
I knew I was in trouble on my first day at
Stanford when, of the 90 people living in
my freshman dorm, only three admitted
to being Red Sox fans. In New England, en
tire college campuses — hell, entire cities —
go crazy each fall as the postseason ap
proaches and the Sox prepare to break our
hearts once again. Here at Stanford, though.
I can only assume that my classmates think
Johnny, Manny, Varitek and Ortiz are a
bunch of my high school buddies to whom I
am obsessively attached.
Poor judgment in sports aside, California
has been good to me in the two weeks since I
arrived. Gone are the days of making excus
es like, "But it's raining!" or,"lt's too cold!"
when I plan to go jogging. Instead, I'm actu
ally excited to lace up my sneakers fora run
among the palm trees and mission-style ar
chitecture, the bright sun on my face remind
ing me that I am now a California girl, so I
had better start acting like one.
But I've still got a long way to go. Com
pared to all the West Coast natives here, it
couldn't be more obvious that I have no clue
what it even means to be a California girl (ex
cept that the Beach Boys seem to prefer
them over girls from any other locale). But
back east, just the fact that I go to school in
California is an instant boost to my coolness
factor. To the people in my hometown, the
West Coast is clouded by an exotic mystique
that many dream of but few actually witness

firsthand. So instead, they live vicariously
through those who do — in this case, me.
And I don't blame them in the slightest; if
I weren't here myself, I'd be somewhere back
east dreaming about being out west.
Anyone who has ever lived through a
New England winter can sympathize with
what I'm saying. No, winter in the Northeast
is not like the serene pictures on postcards —
it's frigid, vicious, violent and longer than a
"Lord of the Rings" marathon. "Oh," you
may be thinking, "but with snow all winter
you can surely go skiing or snowboarding or
[insert name of winter sport here] every
day!" Well, sure, if you enjoy below-zero
wind chills and frostbitten appendages. I,
personally, do not. By the time the last snow
is melting away in late April, everybody is
cranky and irritable from spending six
months trapped inside by the snowdrifts on
their front porches.
Or it could just be that we're cantanker

ous all the time. After all, the weather's not
the only thing that's warmer here; the stereo
typical Californian is laid back and easygo
ing, which is more than can be said for us
Easterners. Fierce but aloof New Yorkers
give their city its unique attitude, and thick
skinned Bostonians distinguish Beantown as
a hard, resilient place, but, short of Disney
land, Northern California is quite possibly
the happiest place on earth. Even the Prince
ton Review recognized this when it dubbed
Stanford home of the happiest college stu
dents in the country. And it's not only the
people; everyone has seen the "Happy cows
come from California" commercials.
Maybe the sun and the palm trees really
do have an intoxicating effect on East Coast
transplants that makes us never want to go
back to our gray, dismal native coast. Or
maybe "California cool" is just a self-fulfill
ing prophecy, making everyone who comes
here feel that, in order to avoid getting the
"Oh, you must be from the East Coast" eye
roll, they have to fit the stereotypically re
laxed California attitude. But before long,
they discover that what used to be a facade
has now become a way of life, and then
there's no turning back.
Unless, of course, the Red Sox make the
playoffs. Then it's back to Boston.
