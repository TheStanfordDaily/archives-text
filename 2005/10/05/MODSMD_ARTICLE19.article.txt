## STAND asks for renewed commitment: Fast for Darfur 
### BEN ELBERGER SETH SILVERMAN 
Last spring, the Stanford community
stood together in remarkable solidarity with
the people of Darfur (a western region of
Sudan) by saying that Stanford's endowment
cannot support genocide. Tomorrow. Oct. 6,
we. Students Taking Action Now: Darfur
(STAND), are once again asking the commu
nity to stand up. STAND will be hosting Dar
fur Fast, an event designed to demonstrate
unity with the people of Darfur, raise aware
ness of the genocide, and fundraise for relief
efforts.
Prior to June 9, 2005, Stanford Universi
ty's endowment was known to be financing a
genocide that had taken the lives of almost
400,000 people, left 2.5 million homeless and
terrorized countless women and children in a
brutal campaign of rape and violence. In

Darfur. militias and the government have
ruthlessly prosecuted a campaign against
African tribes whose only crime was their
ethnicity. The U.S. Congress, the president,
the European Union and numerous human
rights groups have declared the situation in
Darfur to be genocide, and UN. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan has called the situation
the "worst humanitarian crisis" of our time.
Last June. Stanford courageously became
only the second university to divest from
companies that do business in Sudan and
support the Sudanese government. This bold
decision came on the heals of a campaign in
which more than 2000 students, the Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibility, the
ASSU Senate, the Daily Editorial Board, nu
merous faculty and alumni and many student
groups supported and lobbied for divest
ment.
To all of those groups who stood with us

and. most of all, to the concerned and active
students who joined the campaign, we extend
our sincerest thanks for your support. Stan
ford's decision to divest from four companies
involved in the development of oil resources
in Sudan has spurred action on divestment
campaigns at Amherst, Brown, Cornell,
Georgetown. George Washington Universi
ty, Pennsylvania State University, and the
University of North Carolina. Progress has
also been made towards greater shareholder
action at the California Public Employees
Retirement System (CaIPERS) and the Cal
ifornia State Teachers Retirement System
(CaISTRS), two of the country's largest pub
lic pension funds. T\vo weeks ago. California
State Treasurer and gubernatorial candidate.
Phil Angelides, declared publicly that
CaIPERS should make Sudan its number
one priority, and that it should apply share
holder pressure with possible threats of di

vestment.
The purpose of this letter is not merely to
say thank you. Our work has begun, but, in a
time of worsening crisis in Darfur, it is not
done. After a temporary cessation of vio
lence during the rainy season, Arab militias
and the Sudanese government have contin
ued to murder, rape and terrorize Darfuri
civilians, even those within refugee cainps.
Thousands of refugees live a harsh life in
camps where the next meal is not guaran
teed, where countless children's educations
have been interrupted and where mere tasks
such as collecting firewood carry the risk of
death or rape.
After a tremendously successful and uni
fied campaign for divestment last year, we
know what this community can do. Tomor
row we at STAND are encouraging the en
tire Stanford community to join us again in
ameliorating the suffering in Darfur by fast

ing or donating. The Pierre and Pam Omid
yar Fund, a local philanthropic group, will do
nate $5 to the World Food Program and Doc
tors Without Borders for each individual
from the Stanford community who commits
to fasting. Additionally, any donation to the
World Food Program or Doctors Without
Borders by a Stanford student, staff member
or faculty member and their friends and fam
ily will be matched dollar for dollar by the
same generous fund.
Darfuri men, women and children who
have escaped the violence in their villages
face the possibility of hunger in refugee
camps because of a lack of funds and sup
plies. Preventing fleeing refugees from ob
taining access to food, water and medical
care has been just one part of an intentional
campaign against the people of Darfur. For
