## Leland leaves the Farm after 15 years 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Le
land announced his resignation yester
day, after holding the position for nearly
15 years. Under Leland's tenure, Stan
ford captured 50 national champi
onships, more than any other school in
the nation, and 11 consecutive Directors'
Cups, awarded annually to the most suc
cessful collegiate athletic program in the
country.
Leland will become vice president for
university advancement at his alma
mater and hometown school, the Univer
sity of Pacific, on Jan. 1,2006, giving the
University three months time to form a
search committee and find a replace
ment.
"It's been a privilege to be the Athlet
ic Director at Stanford," Leland said. "It's
been fun to work with some incredible
coaches and athletes. I can look at each
and every coach in the face and remem
ber a great contest that I was privileged
to watch that they participated in."
Hired as Andy Geiger's successor in
June 1991, Leland ushered in a period of

unrivaled athletic success at Stanford.
The University claimed 173 conference
crowns in the Leland era and won an
NCAA record six national titles in one
school year (1996-1997).
Coaches report that much of the rea
son for Leland's success was his willing
ness to trust them with their teams.
"He's not a micromanager," said
women's basketball head coach Tara
VanDerveer, who won 11 conference
championships and the 1992 national
title with Leland at the helm. "In a good
way, he was very hands-off. He allowed
me to do my job and other coaches to do
theirs."
Not only has Leland overseen the
tremendous successes of the past 14
years, but he leaves today's Athletic De
partment in arguably its best shape ever.
Last year alone, all but nine of the Cardi
nal's 35 varsity programs finished in the
top 25, while women's tennis and syn
chronized swimming won NCAA
crowns. The department is similarly fis
cally sound, as under Leland, assets have
grown more than seven-fold to $375 mil-
