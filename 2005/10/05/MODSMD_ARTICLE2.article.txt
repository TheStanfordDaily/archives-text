## Leland leaves the Farm after 15 years 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Le
land announced his resignation yester
day, after holding the position for nearly
15 years. Under Leland's tenure, Stan
ford captured 50 national champi
onships, more than any other school in
the nation, and 11 consecutive Directors'
Cups, awarded annually to the most suc
cessful collegiate athletic program in the
country.
Leland will become vice president for
university advancement at his alma
mater and hometown school, the Univer
sity of Pacific, on Jan. 1,2006, giving the
University three months time to form a
search committee and find a replace
ment.
"It's been a privilege to be the Athlet
ic Director at Stanford," Leland said. "It's
been fun to work with some incredible
coaches and athletes. I can look at each
and every coach in the face and remem
ber a great contest that I was privileged
to watch that they participated in."
Hired as Andy Geiger's successor in
June 1991, Leland ushered in a period of

unrivaled athletic success at Stanford.
The University claimed 173 conference
crowns in the Leland era and won an
NCAA record six national titles in one
school year (1996-1997).
Coaches report that much of the rea
son for Leland's success was his willing
ness to trust them with their teams.
"He's not a micromanager," said
women's basketball head coach Tara
VanDerveer, who won 11 conference
championships and the 1992 national
title with Leland at the helm. "In a good
way, he was very hands-off. He allowed
me to do my job and other coaches to do
theirs."
Not only has Leland overseen the
tremendous successes of the past 14
years, but he leaves today's Athletic De
partment in arguably its best shape ever.
Last year alone, all but nine of the Cardi
nal's 35 varsity programs finished in the
top 25, while women's tennis and syn
chronized swimming won NCAA
crowns. The department is similarly fis
cally sound, as under Leland, assets have
grown more than seven-fold to $375 mil-

lion, and $185 million has been spent
solely upon athletic facility up
grades and construction.
Indeed, one of Leland's last goals
before his departure is to oversee
the $85 million renovation of Stan
ford stadium.
"I'll stay here [to ensure] that we
work with the president and provost
to fund the football stadium appro
priately, that we develop a construc
tion schedule that makes sense, and
that we figure out a way to reseat the
Stadium in a way that works," Le
land said. "I've got some fun tasks to
take on."
That Leland's last accomplish
ment will be football-related is a
touch ironic, because the football

program's lack of constant success is
the most notable blemish on an oth
erwise stellar record. The squad is
only 11-25 since the 2001 season, and
Leland expressed disappointment
that Stanford has spent only three
weeks in top-10 since his hire.
"Consistency in football is one of
the things we're missing," Leland
said. "It's hard on everyone, includ
ing the students, coaches and even
the Athletic Director."
Though he explicitly denied the
recent struggles of the football
team affected the timing of his deci
sion, Leland acknowledged that a
new athletic director may find more
success on the gridiron than he
could.
"If there are any ideas or talent
that I haven't been able to bring to
the task in Stanford Athletics, where
is it?" said Leland, who saw the foot
ball team fare a combined 80-82-1
under his watch. "It's better for

someone else to come in with their
own new energy and bring us from
the level where we are to the next.
We need some fresh leadership here
in Stanford Athletics."
Leland moves on to become the
vice president for university ad
vancement at the University of Pa
cific (UOP), where his chief roles
will be fundraising and cultivating
alumni relations. Leland received
his bachelors' and masters' degrees
from the Stockton, Calif, college,
and he, his wife and his two children
consider Stockton home. Perhaps
then, it came as no surprise when
Leland called his new position a
dream job.
"Returning to Stockton and
UOP is a special opportunity for me,
and my family and I felt it was the
right time in my career to make this
move," Leland said.
President John Hennessy stated
he hopes the to-be-formed search

committee finds the best person
available, regardless of whether or
not they are currently affiliated with
the University.
"We will start the search process
immediately," Hennessy said. "I am
going to ask [Provost John
Etchemendy] to chair the search
committee, and of course, we will
have representation from the stu
dent body, as well as from the Ath
letic Department. We have also tra
ditionally included some of our
alumni."
Two names that have surfaced as
possible replacements are Van-
Derveer and baseball head coach
Mark Marquess, two of Stanford's
most senior and successful coaches.
However, each denied interest in the
position.
"I like coaching too much," Van-
Derveer said. "I don't know that I
have the paper shuffling skills. I
like being right on the floor with

the team."
Marquess was glib, deflecting
speculation that he might be Le
land's successor.
"I have enough problems coach
ing, let alone having to deal with 34
[other] sports," Marquess said.
Above any accolade or awe-in
spiring statistic, those close to Le
land report they will remember him
as a good friend.
"I'm going to miss Ted because I
think we have a lot of common belief
about how to get the job done," foot
ball head coach Walt Harris said.
"But I'm a Ted Leland fan and a
friend of Ted's. 1 can put my job sec
ond and my friendship first."
Hennessy and several coaches
emphasized that Leland valued the
welfare of Stanford's student-ath
letes more highly than any award or
recognition.
"His legacy is that every single
person he ran across knows how

much he cares about them," volley
ball head coach John Dunning
said.
Many students said they will also
remember Leland's legacy.
"I'm really sad to hear that Le
land is going," said basketball player
Rob Little, ( lass of 2005."0ne thing
is for certain, whenever I needed to
talk to Ted about anything, I did not
have to wait long. That says a lot for
the head of the nation's greatest ath
letic department. I have no idea who
is going to replace Ted. Personally, I
would like to see Stanford continue
its commitment to diversity and field
a comprehensive nationwide search,
while paying close attention to our
assistant Athletic Directors who are
very capable individuals. I hear
Condi Rice is a big sports fan, but I
think George Bush would be unwill
ing to give her up!"
