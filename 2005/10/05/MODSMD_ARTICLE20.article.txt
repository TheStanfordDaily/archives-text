## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Senior anchors Cardinal defense 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"And in the contrasting libero jersey, a 6-foot-1 senior from Pacific Palis
Calif., Courtney Schultz!" It is an introduction which raises eyebrows amonj
leyball fans: "Your libero is how tall?"
But in her four years on the Farm, Schultz has fully thrown herself into h<
fensive role, becoming as good a collegiate libero as she was a high school m
blocker. This season, Schultz — who is more than a few inches taller than th
erage libero — is putting up her best numbers ever while leading the way oi
of the best defensive teams Stanford has seen in years.
"I haven't played on a great defensive team in a really long time," Schultz
"It's nice with [junior outside hitter] Kristin Richards and [freshman outsidi
ter] Cynthia Barboza and [senior setter] Katie Goldhahn and [sophomore i
terj Bryn Kehoe all being so great at defense. I'm surprised almost every tin
a ball gets up because I'm not used to it. I love that about our team, that w<
can keep rallies going this year whereas in the past we have relied more on
our hitters."
When she arrived on the Farm, Schultz intended to be one of those hit
ters herself; in fact she had rarely played defense during her years with
Harvard-Westlake High School and Sports Shack Volleyball Club. She
had been an overpowering middle and assumed to continue in that
role.
"She was a very aggressive, hard-hitting, I-want-to-hit-you-in-the
face-with-the-ball kind of attacker, which is tremendous," said head
coach John Dunning, who had tried to recruit Schultz to his Pacific
squad before taking over at Stanford. "She had a very fast arm and
that was my expectation when she came to college, for her to be attack
ing in the middle or someplace else if we had to move her."
At the beginning of her freshman year, it became obvious that
Schultz, fourth on the depth chart at the middle blocker position, would
probably spend most of the year on the bench.
"I came in and we had really great middles," she recalled. "We had Jen
Harvey, Sara McGee. and Sara Dukes who were all above me. When I came
in as a freshman middle, I was just not as good as them."
It was an NCAA rule change that ultimately gave Schultz a way to get on
the court. Her rookie season marked the introduction of the libero position
to collegiate volleyball. Previously used in club and international competi
tion, the libero is a purely defensive player who can play only in the back
row but is unrestricted by substitution rules.

The libero, usually the best passer on the team, often plays every point
of a match. Though the average libero is several inches shorter than
Schultz - it is a position that values quickness over size - she does not see

her height as a drawback.
"You can look at it both ways "she said."l'm not as fast as some liberos
out there because I 'm so tall and kind of goofy. I do have to work harder
than a lot of smaller girls to get close to the floor and dive more. But i am

tall and can reach balls that a lot of people wouldn't be able to."
With that mindset, Schultz and her coaches decided that she would
make the transition from blocker to digger. She jumped at the opportu-

nity to play, despite her inexperience with back row defense.
"I could not play defense to save my life," she said. "We needed
someone to go in to pass because they were not going to serve any
balls to Logan [Tom. class of 20()2J. So I just had to fill in that gap. I

slowly learned to play defense. It was John [Dunning] saying' Hey,
you can play if you play libero' and I said 'Alright, if I can get on
the court I'll play anything, I'll play setter.'"
It took time for the coaches to teach Schultz the physical and
mental aspects of the position, but she was naturally talented and
a disciplined, hard worker. According to Dunning, Scultz needed
to learn the mentality of a great defense the importance of a great
serve. Now the head coach puts her in a small category of elite
passers. In addition, the position change might have saved
Schultz' career by moving her out of the way of injuries.
Schultz has a chronic back injury which could have shortened
her career if she had remained a middle blocker. At the libero po
sition, her body is happier, and mentally, she has accepted the
change as well.

"Just this year it started to hit me that I won't ever hit again,"
Schultz said. "But I love playing defense. Even though I'm not a
star player or the one getting kills, I've grown to love it, which is

Senior Courfney Schultz finally began to see consistent playing time after the establishment of the libero position in
collegiate volleyball. Since then, Schultz has gone on to establish herself as a key member of the Stanford defense.
amazing for me to say because I
never thought I would.This year was
the first year where I actually came
in with the mindset of being a libero.
Every other year has been 'libero for
now until I can get a hitting position.'
This mindset has made be better be
cause it isn't just waiting for some
thing to kill the time. It is actually
something that I want to do."
She may not be scoring kills, but
Schultz has been the defensive
leader for the Cardinal this year, tal
lying 205 digs in the team's first 16
matches of 2005. At her current pace,
she is only a few weeks away from
the magical 1000-dig mark and
should crack the top-10 list in Stan
ford historv before the season is out.

In addition to her anchoring role
on the court, Schultz and Goldhahn,
a setter and defensive specialist, are
in the position of veteran leaders on
a team that boasts five freshmen.
"Courtney is serious about what
she is doing," Dunning said of his
senior captain. "She wants to be
good, she wants to be competitive,
she wants to do things right. So, she
just does it and leads by example."
When her senior season and col
legiate career come to an end this
December, Schultz plans to focus on
finishing her degree in Human Biol
ogy and to prepare to leave Stanford
and competitive volleyball behind.
"I'm hoping to get a job. then do
more school," she said. "Whether it
be a master's, PhD, or business
school, I'm undecided right now. I
want to continue playing volleyball
as a rec sport, but no pro volleyball,
no overseas volleyball. This is going
to be it for me."
