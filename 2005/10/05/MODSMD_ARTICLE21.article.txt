## A
						Stanford fan's lament for a fallen Cardinal 
### 
On Aug. 31, the last day before the
mandatory NFL roster cutdown to
65 players, Stanford alum Chad
Hutchinson was cut from the Chicago
Bears. This was not entirely unanticipated
following rumors in the days before, but to
me, this is not an occurrence that merits dis
cussion or even an extra look. The athletic
community is not a workplace familiar with
the phrase, job-security.
But for those whose eyes aren't general
ly glued to ESPN's Sports Center, and whose
eyes I hope will glance through the Sports
section of the Daily, this column is meant to
enlighten you about the amazing athletes
out there in the world, who aren't named
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods or have the
last name Manning.
In contrast, for those of you, like me, who
frequent about six different prominent sports
Web sites and are to some degree in-the
know about the happenings in the big four
American sports, this column is geared to
ward discussing stories you may have heard
about but which no one dug into deeper.
Chad was before most of our times on the
Farm, but some Stanford traditionalists
should recognize the name. Two-timing for
both the Stanford baseball and football
teams in the mid-to-late nineties, as the Car
dinal's ace and star quarterback, "Vanilla
Vick," as he was dubbed by Bears 10-year
veteran wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad,
made a name for himself on campus.
Drafted out of high school in the first
round of the MLB draft, he turned down
more than a million dollars to grace us with
his presence. Following a degree in political
science, Chad was again drafted and his
dream of making it to the big leagues was
lived out, albeit briefly, as a starting pitcher
for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2001.
But his heart landed him back in football,
and in 2002, he agreed to a seven-year NFL
contract with the Dallas Cowboys that in
cluded a $3.1 million dollar signing bonus.
Hutchinson ended up starting nine games
that year. He was let go in 2003, resurfacing
with the Bears' organization the next sea
son. In 2004, after a season-ending injury to
rookie and first-round-pick Rex Grossman,
Hutchinson rose from his third-string role to
start the final five games for the Bears.
This year, training camp ended with the
heralded Grossman named the starter with
Hutchinson serving as the primary backup.
As Chad's luck would have it (or maybe
Rex's unfortunate luck), Grossman broke
his ankle in Chicago's first preseason game,
keeping him on crutches and off the game
turf no sooner than Thanksgiving.
Yet again, this was Chad's time. This was
his opportunity to show the Bears' coaching
staff and the rest of the NFL that he was a
bona fide professional starter.
Making a short story shorter, two games,
zero touchdowns and four interceptions
later, Kyle Orton, a rookie fourth-round
draft pick from Purdue, was named the
starter and Hutchinson was out.
This would be a quarterback controversy
