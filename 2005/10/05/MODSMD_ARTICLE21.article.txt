## A 						Stanford fan's lament for a fallen Cardinal 
### 
On Aug. 31, the last day before the
mandatory NFL roster cutdown to
65 players, Stanford alum Chad
Hutchinson was cut from the Chicago
Bears. This was not entirely unanticipated
following rumors in the days before, but to
me, this is not an occurrence that merits dis
cussion or even an extra look. The athletic
community is not a workplace familiar with
the phrase, job-security.
But for those whose eyes aren't general
ly glued to ESPN's Sports Center, and whose
eyes I hope will glance through the Sports
section of the Daily, this column is meant to
enlighten you about the amazing athletes
out there in the world, who aren't named
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods or have the
last name Manning.
In contrast, for those of you, like me, who
frequent about six different prominent sports
Web sites and are to some degree in-the
know about the happenings in the big four
American sports, this column is geared to
ward discussing stories you may have heard
about but which no one dug into deeper.
Chad was before most of our times on the
Farm, but some Stanford traditionalists
should recognize the name. Two-timing for
both the Stanford baseball and football
teams in the mid-to-late nineties, as the Car
dinal's ace and star quarterback, "Vanilla
Vick," as he was dubbed by Bears 10-year
veteran wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad,
made a name for himself on campus.
Drafted out of high school in the first
round of the MLB draft, he turned down
more than a million dollars to grace us with
his presence. Following a degree in political
science, Chad was again drafted and his
dream of making it to the big leagues was
lived out, albeit briefly, as a starting pitcher
for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2001.
But his heart landed him back in football,
and in 2002, he agreed to a seven-year NFL
contract with the Dallas Cowboys that in
cluded a $3.1 million dollar signing bonus.
Hutchinson ended up starting nine games
that year. He was let go in 2003, resurfacing
with the Bears' organization the next sea
son. In 2004, after a season-ending injury to
rookie and first-round-pick Rex Grossman,
Hutchinson rose from his third-string role to
start the final five games for the Bears.
This year, training camp ended with the
heralded Grossman named the starter with
Hutchinson serving as the primary backup.
As Chad's luck would have it (or maybe
Rex's unfortunate luck), Grossman broke
his ankle in Chicago's first preseason game,
keeping him on crutches and off the game
turf no sooner than Thanksgiving.
Yet again, this was Chad's time. This was
his opportunity to show the Bears' coaching
staff and the rest of the NFL that he was a
bona fide professional starter.
Making a short story shorter, two games,
zero touchdowns and four interceptions
later, Kyle Orton, a rookie fourth-round
draft pick from Purdue, was named the
starter and Hutchinson was out.
This would be a quarterback controversy
that I cared about. But, no, as I con
tinued to read the news brief and
look at the updated Bears' depth
chart, there was Orton as the starter.
Under him was Jeff Blake at number
two, and Kurt "Have-you-heard-of
me?" Kittner at number three with
Chad in the fourth slot.
From first to fourth in less than
five days.
Keeping in mind that teams gen
erally keep only three quarterbacks
on their roster for the season, this
was rather disconcerting. Your luck
can turn that quickly when you're in.
But here is something to think about.
Would this have happened to a big
name guy? A recent first-round draft
pick? Even third-round? Well, with
third-round rogue running back
Maurice Clarett hitting the waiver
wire, too, let's just stop there.
Seriously, though, where would
you draw the line?
For example, Alex Smith, the
2005 first-pick quarterback from
Utah. His statistics weren't much
better than Chad's in his first games
as a starter. Ignoring how much
money they invested in Smith, why
was he only demoted only to No. 2?
After all, the All-everything Miami
product Ken Dorsey and former
UDubb throwing machine Cody
Pickett are the two men behind him.
Is it because of the recently coined
word that has successfully infiltrated
the parlance of professional sports in
recent years: upside?
Recent former first round picks
Ryan Leaf, Cade McNown and Akili
Smith (who? That's right) can attest
to the fact that "upside" doesn't do
much to keep a household name
from simply becoming a great col
lege quarterback who flamed out on
the big show. But I digress.
My discontent lies in the follow
ing question. If Chad was good
enough to start all but one of the
NFL games he played as a fourth
year veteran, after two admittedly

miserable performances in games
fans don't even particularly care
about (yes, this is an entertainment
business), could he really be a worse
signal caller than the two quarter
backs behind him? One who is 35
years old, and the other who hasn't
thrown a pass since the 2003 season,
and has a career passer rating of
32.5?
There's a business in this league.
A player becomes more expendable
if you're not paying him a ton of
money or if you're paying too much
money. This is also a PR-driven
league. In a recent wasteland for
quarterbacks — quick, name the
starter of the opening game for the
Bears for the past five years — does
anyone care that a man like Chad
Hutchinson gets released? It's a not
so-surprising fact that the Bears
used four different starting quarter
backs last year and have used at least
three different starters in six of the
last seven years.
In mid-August, the Bears' own
Web site released an article about
Hutchinson, noting that he was ex
pected to make a smooth transition
and praised his promise and still-un
tapped potential.
I don't want to make this all neg
ative, though. I think Chad should,
and perhaps he will,get another shot
at the big show, despite the fact that
Foxsports.com mentioned that "he is
unlikely to get another chance in the
NFL." It is reasonable, though,
right? This is a starter with experi
ence, smarts and legitimate NFL
size. The potential's still there, and at
28. he's only entering what most con
sider his prime playing days.
While the NFL is a mix between
inflated egos and inept administra
tion (really, why is there still no fran
chise in LA?), I believe Chad still has
something good to bring to the table.
So Chad, on behalf of all Stanford
affiliates who enjoy seeing the suc
cess of former students, when you hit
the field again, you'll have to prove
yourself again — but we'll be watch
ing and I'll be cheering.
