# Equestrians return home

### ANGELA CHENG 
Last weekend there was more commotion than
normal on the idyllic west (far west) side of cam
pus. From the bustle of team members carrying
tack into a long-empty Red Barn, to animated
horses galloping across open spaces, the Stanford
Equestrian Team (SET) was a spectacle of motion.
One horse in particular was "rolling so emphat
ically that his feet were slamming against the sides
of the stalls," said sophomore Caroline Feinberg.
"That's how happy he was to be home."
Chili, the "grouchy old man of the team," has
been with Stanford Equestrian for 15 years and is
the team's most experienced horse. Formerly a
jumping horse, Chili now has lessons with begin
ners in walk/trot.
In 1876, 15 years before the founding of the
University, Leland Stanford Sr. purchased the first
650 acres for his Palo Alto Stock Farm. Over the
next decade, he amassed 8,800 acres and estab
lished a world-class farm for the breeding and
training of trotting horses. How many Stanford stu
dents have seen the bronze statue of Electioneer,
the father of nine world champions during Mr.
Stanford's time,called the "world champion sire of
world champions?" The statue sits in front of the
historical Red Barn, nestled on the far side of the
tennis courts from campus.
There were still horses on the Farm when the
University opened its doors to students in 1891 —
it's a wonder sports teams here aren't known as the
Stanford Stallions.
Since then, the facilities had fallen into disre
pair. When co-term Sarah Willeman (2000 Junior
Equestrian of the Year) came to Stanford, the
quality of the Red Barn did not meet higher horse
manship standards. It was apparent that it needed

to be improved.
So on Sept. 1,2004, the Athletic Department ini
tiated a $4 million dollar renovation of Stanford's
equestrian facilities — namely the Red Barn, the
adjacent School Barn, other small buildings and
the outdoor riding complex.
As one of only two remaining buildings from
the original Farm, the Red Barn is protected as a
historic monument of the University. Outfitted in a
coat of deep cardinal walls and gleaming white
beams, the Victorian architecture of the Red Barn
has in no way been structurally altered.
"Though still the same barn as it was 1 00 years
ago, it is still one of the nicest barns I have ever
seen" head coach Vanessa Bartsch said.
Bartsch, a former four-year member of SET,
oversaw the restoration and is considered the rock
that keeps the team together.
Of the old School Barn, only the roof is left. In
dividual stall divides are built out of Brazilian
Cherry, the second hardest wood in the world. It
was chosen to prevent the horses from chewing
through their stalls. Feinberg said that the team
"will have to worry more about the horses than the
wood."

But the improvements were not limited to the
two main buildings. Outside the Barn is a Eurosiz
er machine which automatically walks horses at a
chosen pace.
lliree open arenas have been raised above their
original elevation. The covered arena has fences
that give, but do not break.This way, the horses are
safer and the University does not need to continu
ally purchase materials for new fences.
ITie work on the Red Barn temporarily moved
the team out of its quarters. During this time, SET
relocated to a large circus tent bordering the reno
vation. It observed the progress on the Barn
throughout the year and practiced in anticipation
of the renewal of its facility.
Junior Shawn Chen, who only joined the team
last year, has never experienced stabling at Red
Barn. But already he can see marked improve
ments.
"I love the team." he said."Everyone helps each
other and the more experienced members serve as
coaches. But since we have a limited number of
horses, we don't always practice together."
