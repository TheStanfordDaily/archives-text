## Cardinal look to break SoCal slump 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
And then there were three.
Senior Alice Barnes and juniors Theresa Logar and Anne
Yelsey won't start their runs at the Riviera/ITA Ail-American
Women's Tennis Championships until Thursday afternoon, but
already Stanford has suffered its first loss at the hard court gath
ering.
Recently transferred from Harvard, sophomore Celia
Durkin played her first match under the Cardinal banner yes
terday. Durkin lost her opening-round, qualifying match to
Florida's own sophomore hopeful, Diana Srebovic.
The showdown was quick — painless, even — with Durkin
notching just three games in a straight-set loss to Srebovic, 6-0,
6-3. But in a tournament in which elite players are hand-picked
to compete in 64-member qualifying and pre-qualifying rounds,
Durkin's early exit is hardly grounds for disappointment
Durkin shakes off the upset to continue play in the consola
tion bracket, where she is seeded fifth. She next takes on Rice's
Blair DiSesa.
Since the tournament's debut in 1983, the Cardinal have
racked up a record eight singles and doubles champions at the
event in Pacific Palisades, Calif. The most recent of these cham
pionship victories was sparked by the deft play of doubles team
mates Lauren Kalvaria and Gabriela Lastra, who clinched their
title in 2000.
As of late, however, the Cardinal have come up short in the
lengthy competition. In 2003, then-junior Erin Burdette mount
ed a three-set comeback over her top-seeded semifinal oppo
nent to reach the title match. But she ultimately proved to be
too drained to pull through in the final, in which she lost to Cal
ifornia's Raquel Kops-Jones in straight sets, 6-2,6-3.
Barnes is making her third appearance at All-American and
rounds out the field of the nation's top-10 players. Still, Barnes
has yet to survive beyond the
round of 16.
Logar went on a 17-match
winning streak last season and
broke through to the third round
in the NCAA Singles Champi
onship, earning a No. 13 ranking
for the 2005 preseason. But for
all of her landmark successes last
year, the 5'9" baseliner from
Rochester Hills, Mich., still lost
in the second round at the 2004
All-American.
Part of the Cardinal's sluggish
ness at this premier event can be
attributed to player injury and
burnout from the previous relent
less year.
Sophomore Lejla Hodzic
capped a perfect 27-0 result last
year, but she suffered a sprained
ankle in the process. Consequent
ly, after being tapped for the quali
fying draw at this year's All-Amer
ican, Hodzic opted out to continue
her healing process.
But regardless of whether its
players are healthy or injured, the
Stanford squad focuses as much
on academics as it does on aces.
Freshmen Meghan Doheny and
Jessica Nguyen stayed out of the
pre-qualifying rounds of play,
which began Saturday, to focus on
their classes.
"Freshmen [often] have to play
pre-qualifying at All-American,
and we don't go because they'd
miss too much class," explained
Stanford head coach Lele Forood.
Just the same, sending three
players to the main draw gives
Stanford a leg up on other schools.
Northwestern, which produced
2004 singles champion Audra
Cohen, enters just one player this
year — Cristelle Grier. it is there
fore with optimistic expectations
that the Cardinal look to send a
message to the rest of the NCAA
as they open this 2005 campaign.

Senior Alice Barnes returns to lead the Cardinal in their pursuit of a repeat NCAA title. In this week's ITA All-American tournament, Barnes
looks to improve upon her finish of last year by advancing to the quarterfinals — at the very least.
