# PAC-10 WRAP-UP
## Dramatic weekend around league 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Three dramatic comebacks
highlighted the Pacific-10 Confer
ence slate this past weekend, with
Oregon and California emerging as
the only blowout winners. Though
the national media often bash the
conference, this week's AP Top-25
field includes half of the teams in
the Pac-10. No other conference
has a higher proportion of ranked
members.
No. 1 Southern California runs
by No. 14 Arizona State, 38-28
For the second straight week,
the visiting USC (4-0, 2-0 Pac-10)
squad fell behind its ranked Pac-10
opponent early, only to see its of
fense explode in the second half.
Two weeks ago, the Trojans spotted
Oregon a 13-point lead before ral
lying for 45 unanswered points to
put the final margin at 45-13. This
week, Arizona State (3-2, 1-1) led
the Trojans 21 -3 at the half, but a 35-
7 second half run gave the Men of
Troy the 38-28 victory.
USC's running backs carried
the offensive load, as juniors
LenDale White and Reggie Bush
scored two touchdowns apiece and

combined for 355 rushing yards.
Despite passing for 258 yards, de
fending Heisman champion and
senior quarterback Matt Leinart
finished without an aerial touch
down for only the second game in
his career. Leinart still outper
formed Sun Devil junior quarter
back Sam Keller, whose five inter
ceptions allowed the Trojans to
complete their comeback.
No. 20 UCLA rallies past Wash
ington, 21-17
With a 17-7 lead over UCLA (4-
0,1-0) heading into the fourth quar
ter. the visiting Huskies (1-4, 0-2)
appeared on the verge of snapping
their nine-game conference losing
streak. However, Bruin senior
quarterback Drew Olson fired a
one-yard strike to sophomore run
ning back Michael Pitre to start the
fourth, and UCLA junior running
back Maurice Drew rushed for the
one-yard game-winner with 1:08 to
play.
Despite picking up the loss,
Washington actually outgained
UCLA 401 yards to 352. Washing
ton's ground game inflicted much
of the damage, racking up over five
yards per carry en route to 213
yards and two touchdowns against

a questionable Bruin defensive
front.
Oregon State outlasts Washing
ton State, 44-33
Up 30-16 at halftime,the visiting
Cougars (3-1,0-1) looked primed to
push their then-unblemished
record to 4-0. However, Oregon
State senior wide receiver Mike
I lass - yet to haul in fewer than 150
receiving yards in a game this sea
son - spearheaded a Beaver (3-2,1-
1) attack that proved too much for
Washington State to handle.
Junior all-star safety Sabby Pas
cilleti's interception return fora
touchdown started the fourth quar
ter scoring and knotted the contest
at 30. A 23-yard field goal gave the
Cougars the lead one final time, but
Oregon State pulled ahead 37-33
on junior quarterback Matt
Moore's 68-yard strike to Hass.
Beaver sophomore running back
Yvenson Bernard rushed fora
three-yard insurance touchdown
with 56 seconds remaining.
No. 12 California trounces Ari
zona, 28-0
Usual faces led the charge for
the Bears (5-0, 2-0), who scored a
touchdown every quarter in their
steady undressing of the Wildcats

(1-3,0-1). Though he only attempt
ed 20 passes, junior quarterback
Joseph Ayoob tallied three touch
downs, two with his arm and one on
his feet. Meanwhile, freshman phe
nom running back Marshawn
Lynch rushed for 107 yards and the
final California score.
On a day when Arizona held Cal
to a season-low 331 total yards, per
haps the Bears' best performance
came on the defensive side of the
ball. A stingy Cal defense frustrated
Arizona sophomore quarterback
Richard Kovalchek into three in
terceptions, held the Wildcats to
206 yards of total offense, and. most
importantly, pitched a shutout.
Through five games, the Bears are
now allowing just 10.6 points per
contest.

Oregon a 13-point lead before ral
lying for 45 unanswered points to
put the final margin at 45-13. This
week, Arizona State (3-2, 1-1) led

ington, 21-17
With a 17-7 lead over UCLA (4-
0,1-0) heading into the fourth quar
ter. the visiting Huskies (1-4, 0-2)
appeared on the verge of snapping
their nine-game conference losing
streak. However, Bruin senior
quarterback Drew Olson fired a
one-yard strike to sophomore run
ning back Michael Pitre to start the
fourth, and UCLA junior running
back Maurice Drew rushed for the
one-yard game-winner with 1:08 to

Despite picking up the loss,
Washington actually outgained
UCLA 401 yards to 352. Washing
ton's ground game inflicted much
of the damage, racking up over five
yards per carry en route to 213
yards and two touchdowns against

a questionable Bruin defensive
front.
Oregon State outlasts Washing
ton State, 44-33
Up 30-16 at halftime,the visiting
Cougars (3-1,0-1) looked primed to
push their then-unblemished
record to 4-0. However, Oregon
State senior wide receiver Mike
I lass - yet to haul in fewer than 150
receiving yards in a game this sea
son - spearheaded a Beaver (3-2,1-
1) attack that proved too much for
Washington State to handle.
Junior all-star safety Sabby Pas
cilleti's interception return fora
touchdown started the fourth quar
ter scoring and knotted the contest
at 30. A 23-yard field goal gave the
Cougars the lead one final time, but

No. 12 California trounces Ari
zona, 28-0
Usual faces led the charge for
the Bears (5-0, 2-0), who scored a
touchdown every quarter in their
steady undressing of the Wildcats

(1-3,0-1). Though he only attempt
ed 20 passes, junior quarterback
Joseph Ayoob tallied three touch
downs, two with his arm and one on
his feet. Meanwhile, freshman phe
nom running back Marshawn
Lynch rushed for 107 yards and the
final California score.
On a day when Arizona held Cal
to a season-low 331 total yards, per

terceptions, held the Wildcats to
206 yards of total offense, and. most
importantly, pitched a shutout.
Through five games, the Bears are
now allowing just 10.6 points per
contest.
