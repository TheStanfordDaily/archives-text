Once again, Stanford can claim
some bragging rights fora Nobel
Prize winner. Theodor W. Haensch,
one of this year's three laureates for
physics, received one-fourth of the
prestigious award on TUesday. Haen
sch spent 16 years at Stanford be
tween 1970 and 1986.
Haensch received the prize for his
"contributions to the development of
laser-based precision spectroscopy,
including the optical frequency comb
technique," according to the Nobel
Prize Web site.
Haensch spent 16 years at Stan
ford, initially as a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization postdoctoral
fellow and visiting scholar from 1970
to 1972 in the Nobel-prize-winning
Arthur L. Schawlow lab. Haensch
was an associate professor in 1972
and became a professor from 1975 to
1986. He was also thesis adviser to
one of the 2001 Nobel physics win
ners, Carl E. Wieman, who is now a
Distinguished Professor of Physics at
the University of Colorado.
"Stanford has long had a leading
faculty in atomic and optical physics,"
said Applied Physics and Materials
Science and Engineering Prof. Emer
itus Theodore Geballe. "[Haensch]
was attracted to come here as a
young scientist by Arthur Schawlow.
He and Art did some ingenious and
exciting experiments at Stanford and
laid the groundwork for his Prize."
Haensch returned to his native
Germany in 1986 to direct the Max-
Planck-Institut fur Quantenoptik
and become a professor at the Lud
wig-Maximilians-Universitat. He has
written more than 460 papers and
holds about 20 patents.
"He continued to develop new
ideas and expand the research after
Art died," Geballe said. "We tried
hard to keep Ted here, but he got an
offer back in Germany that we
couldn't match."
Haensch's work has contributed
to the development of extremely ac
curate clocks and improved global
positioning system (GPS) technolo
gy. It's also made possible the meas
urement of frequencies with an ac
curacy of 15 digits.
His portion of the prize money is
2.5 million Swedish Kronor, approx
imately $320,000.
"I am so delighted to learn that
Ted Haensch has won this year's
Nobel Prize based on work which
had its roots in the 16 years he
spent at Stanford,'" said Natural
Science Prof. Richard N. Zare in an
interview with the Stanford News
Service.
