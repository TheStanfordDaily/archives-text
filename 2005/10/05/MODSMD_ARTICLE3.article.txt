"Stanford has long had a leading
faculty in atomic and optical physics,"
said Applied Physics and Materials
Science and Engineering Prof. Emer
itus Theodore Geballe. "[Haensch]
was attracted to come here as a
young scientist by Arthur Schawlow.
He and Art did some ingenious and
exciting experiments at Stanford and
laid the groundwork for his Prize."
