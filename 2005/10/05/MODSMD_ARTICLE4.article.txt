## Smaller dishes to be torn down 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has recently announced
a proposal to tear down five rusting
telescope dishes surrounding the be
hemoth known as the Dish in the
foothills behind campus.The Univer
sity plans to transform the new land,
known as Site 515, into a nature pre
serve, but some members of Stan
ford's community are protesting the
decision.
The telescope dishes were erected
in the 1950s by Professor Emeritus of
Electrical Engineering Professor
Emeritus Ronald Bracewell as a part
of Stanford's Space, Telecommunic
ations and Radioscience Laboratory
to map microwaves emitted from the
sun.
The dishes played a role in
NASA's space exploration program
through the 1960s and 1970s but have
been used rarely since.
Last fall, however. David Con
rod, a University fire inspector, dis
covered weed-choked meadows, di
lapidated sheds and rusting equip
ment on his visit to the site. Conrod
declared the site unsafe and man
dated that it be either restored or
demolished. Friends of the
Bracewell Observatory Association
