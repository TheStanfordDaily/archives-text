## Smaller dishes to be torn down 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has recently announced
a proposal to tear down five rusting
telescope dishes surrounding the be
hemoth known as the Dish in the
foothills behind campus.The Univer
sity plans to transform the new land,
known as Site 515, into a nature pre
serve, but some members of Stan
ford's community are protesting the
decision.
The telescope dishes were erected
in the 1950s by Professor Emeritus of
Electrical Engineering Professor
Emeritus Ronald Bracewell as a part
of Stanford's Space, Telecommunic
ations and Radioscience Laboratory
to map microwaves emitted from the
sun.
The dishes played a role in
NASA's space exploration program
through the 1960s and 1970s but have
been used rarely since.
Last fall, however. David Con
rod, a University fire inspector, dis
covered weed-choked meadows, di
lapidated sheds and rusting equip
ment on his visit to the site. Conrod
declared the site unsafe and man
dated that it be either restored or
demolished. Friends of the

The University recently announced a plan to tear down the five minor dishes surrounding the main Dish.
(FBOA), a non-profit organization
dedicated to the dishes' preserva
tion, began a campaign to save the
relics.
"It would be a tragedy for this
large scale radio astronomy obser
vatory to be completely demolished
simply because dry brush and plant
overgrowth at the site was deemed a
fire hazard," said Bob Lash, presi
dent of FBOA. "The brush and de
bris can be cleared, and our restora
tion work can bring the observatory
back into operation for the benefit
of both Stanford University and the
public."
FBOA has developed a proposal
in conjunction with the director of
Stanford's Space, Telecommunica
tions and Radio Science Laborato
ry and the director of Stanford's
Space Systems Development Labo
ratory to combine Stanford aca
demic and research use with its
planned activities.
In an open letter to University
President John Hennessy, Lash ex
plained that his association "offers
to provide long-term funding and
expert maintenance for restoration
and subsequent academic use" of the
dishes and calls upon the president

to "rescind the demolition order to
allow time fora carefully considered
decision, to gather all the facts first
hand by convening a meeting so all
parties can be heard and to accept
our funding and maintenance pro
posal."
Currently, the group has re
ceived no answer from Hennessy.
In an interview with The San Jose
Mercury News, University
spokesman Alan Acosta said Hen
nessy was taking the group's opin
ions under advisement but doesn't
need to meet with members per
sonally because he's "been here
nearly 30 years and has an under
standing of the issues involved."
FBOA has already collected 803
signatures in support of saving the
telescope dishes.
Several students also support
FBOA's efforts to save the dishes.
"They have been there fora long
time and they add to the beauty of
our campus," said senior Vivian
Chang. "They don't take up too
much land and they aren't doing any
harm. I think it will do more harm to
pull them down and disrupt what is
already there."
Other students, however, said
they were apathetic about the out
come of this conflict.
"I have no particular attachment
to the dishes," said freshman Ben
Hsieh. "The outcome means noth
ing to me either wav."
