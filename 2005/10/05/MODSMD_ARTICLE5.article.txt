## ASSU sets goals for new year ASSU Senate to rein in expenditures this year 
### GERRY SHIH DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate convened last night for the sec
ond time this quarter to establish its
main objectives and identify key is
sues for the 2005-2006 academic
year. In addition, the Senate ap
proved over $8,000 to be trans
ferred to student group funding.
The ASSU Legislative Branch,
composed of Undergraduate Sen
ate Chair Chris Nguyen, a junior,
and Graduate Student Council Co
chairs Jenny Allen and Tom Lee,
presented the student governing
body's goals for this year.
"The main issue of this year is
trying to get graduate students to
interact with other graduate stu
dents," Lee reported to the Senate,
on behalf of the GSC. "Grad stu
dents tend to stick to their own de
partment-law students interact only
with law students, business students
interact only with business students
â€” we want to empower grad stu
dents and make them more con
nected to Stanford as whole."
Allen said that there are efforts
underway to get more graduate stu
dents involved in the Council and
make the Graduate Community
Center behind Mirrielees a more
visible component in graduate stu
dent life.
Furthermore, the GSC will work
closely with a commission delegat
ed by University President Hen
nessy in the evaluation and possible
overhaul of Stanford's graduate ed
ucation. Such a move would mirror
former President Gerhardt
Casper's face-lift of the undergrad
uate curriculum 10 years ago which
brought about significant additions
such as the Freshman-Sophomore
Introductory Seminars and Intro
duction to the Humanities pro
grams.
Nguyen also stated what he fore
saw to be the four most likely major
issues of the year: Senate communi
cation, student group funding, hous
ing and student space changes and
constitutional and joint by-law re
forms.
"The biggest thing this year will
probably be the housing and stu
dent space issues," Nguyen said.
"There are still a lot of things in the
air, and there are still decisions to be
made that will affect every single
Stanford student."
Tresidder Memorial Union,
Nguyen pointed out, remains unal
located for student use and much of
the space inside Old Union has not
yet been assigned. Meanwhile,
many students do not feel fully com
fortable with the sweeping changes
in housing proposed by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman last year, which
would include transforming Wilbur,
Stern and Florence Moore into all
freshmen complexes and eliminat
