# Natural disaster would be catastrophic to IT system

A catastrophic regional disaster like an
earthquake or terrorist attack is one of the few
things capable of disrupting Stanford's exten
sive computer networking system according to
an external analysis conducted over the sum
mer by IBM. The report recommended that
Stanford invest in a new data storage site far
enough away to be unaffected by the most se

vere disaster possible.
Forsythe flail, a large white building near
the steam-generation plant on west campus, is
the backbone of the University's Information
Technology system and where all the hardware
necessary to run Axess, People Soft, Oracle and
other systems is stored.
"If some kind of a thing were to happen —
and I can't imagine what it would be — and this
building were to disappear, we would be in a
world of hurt." said Steve Loving, a project

manager at Information Technology Services
(ITS)."We don't have a redundant ability for all
services."
And while a calamity large enough to crip
ple the building's sophisticated backup systems,
which include gas generators, is an unlikely sce
nario, it's still a possibility — something that
universities in the New Orleans area learned
the hard way.
The IBM study,entitled the Disaster Recov
ery Project, focused on the University's elec-

Tronic financial systems, which regulate payroll,
research grants, student financial aid and more.
A survey of administrators of these services "in
dicated any interruption to Financial Systems
longer than two days is a disaster."
"The big one — a big earthquake — could
cause that." Loving said."lf a plane crashed into
the data center, that could certainly do it. If for
some reason we lost electricity and none of the
