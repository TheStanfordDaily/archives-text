# Natural disaster would be catastrophic to IT system

A catastrophic regional disaster like an
earthquake or terrorist attack is one of the few
things capable of disrupting Stanford's exten
sive computer networking system according to
an external analysis conducted over the sum
mer by IBM. The report recommended that
Stanford invest in a new data storage site far
enough away to be unaffected by the most se

vere disaster possible.
Forsythe flail, a large white building near
the steam-generation plant on west campus, is
the backbone of the University's Information
Technology system and where all the hardware
necessary to run Axess, People Soft, Oracle and
other systems is stored.
"If some kind of a thing were to happen —
and I can't imagine what it would be — and this
building were to disappear, we would be in a
world of hurt." said Steve Loving, a project

manager at Information Technology Services
(ITS)."We don't have a redundant ability for all
services."
And while a calamity large enough to crip
ple the building's sophisticated backup systems,
which include gas generators, is an unlikely sce
nario, it's still a possibility — something that
universities in the New Orleans area learned
the hard way.
The IBM study,entitled the Disaster Recov
ery Project, focused on the University's elec-

Tronic financial systems, which regulate payroll,
research grants, student financial aid and more.
A survey of administrators of these services "in
dicated any interruption to Financial Systems
longer than two days is a disaster."
"The big one — a big earthquake — could
cause that." Loving said."lf a plane crashed into
the data center, that could certainly do it. If for
some reason we lost electricity and none of the
generators worked and none of the
batteries worked — there's a whole
range of things, but in general, to have
everything down for two days, we're
looking at some kind of big natural
disaster or big horrible event like a
terrorist or disgruntled employee."
IBM proposed additional safe
guards to quickly restore service to
the financial systems in the event of a
major catastrophe. The most secure
way is through the construction of a
miirored data storage site well out
side the Bay Area, capable of updat
ing data in real time.
"You can imagine a regional disas
ter that is so catastrophic that nothing
on campus or nearby would survive,"
Loving said. "So do we need some
thing down in Colorado Springs or
Scottsdale to help us get back in busi
ness?"
But the proposals are still under
consideration, and further studies are
needed before a final decision can be

made.
"We clearly have a goal of making
our IT systems more disaster-resistant
or more fault-tolerant and to have a
better recovery plan in place if we
were to have a disaster strike the cam
pus," said Randy Livingston, the vice
president for business affairs and Uni
versity chief financial officer. "1 have
quite a bit of work left to do to identi
fy the alternatives and see what the
costs associated with the different al
ternatives are."
The study did not, however, exam
ine ways to safeguard non-electronic
information, like lab notebooks or ex
periments involving living organisms,
which creates a major deficiency in
the University's disaster prepared
ness, according to Steve Jung, director
of internal audits.
"A lot of very valuable informa
tion at Stanford is not contained in
our electronic information systems,"
Jung said. "What we noted in the uni
versities that suffered the results of
Hurricane Katrina flooding in
Louisiana is that many of these irre
placeable documents and research
substances may have been lost for all
time."
