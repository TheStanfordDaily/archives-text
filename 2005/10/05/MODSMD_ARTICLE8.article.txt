NEW ORLEANS â€” Officials ended their door-to
door sweep for corpses and some schoolchildren re
turned to classes as New Orleans revved up efforts to
recover from Hurricane Katrina. Meanwhile, former
President Clinton met with evacuees in Baton Rouge.
The search for Katrina victims ended in Louisiana
with a death toll substantially less than the 10,000 vic
tims some officials feared. A private company hired by
the state to remove bodies was on call if any others
were found. The toll Tuesday stood at 972, eight more
than Monday, the state health department said. Missis
sippi's death toll remained at 221.
The death toll probably will continue to rise, but
authorities have said sweeps yielded fewer bodies
than feared, and that the toll was likely to be well
below the dire projections. Mayor Ray Nagin said
soon after Katrina struck that New Orleans alone
could have 10,000 dead.
On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton met with
several dozen New Orleans-area residents who are
staying in a shelter in Baton Rouge's convention cen
ter. The evacuees, many of whom have been sleeping
on cots in the Rivercenter's vast concrete hall for more
than a month, complained of lack of showers, clean
clothes, privacy and medical care.
Clinton, working with former President Bush to
raise money for victims, toured the sleeping area, shak
ing hands, hugging and chatting.
"My concern is to listen to you ... and learn the best
way to spend this money we've got," said Clinton, who
was to visit the city itself later in the day.
Robert Warner, 51, of New Orleans said he and oth
ers have struggled to get private housing set up
through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
"We've been mired in the bureaucratic red tape
since Day One," he said.

There were signs of normality in New Orleans
on Monday. St. Andrew the Apostle elementary
school in the reopened Algiers neighborhood was
the first Roman Catholic school to resume in New
Orleans.
"My heart is just bursting," said teacher Jewell Mc-
Cartney, fighting back tears as she welcomed her class
of sixth-graders. "I just want to give them all a hug."
Archdiocese officials said their schools also were re
opening in areas outside the city. Some public schools
in nearby parishes also opened Monday, but public

schools in New Orleans remain closed. Some may re
sume by November.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues pump
ing water out of the lower Ninth Ward and efforts to re
build the levees that breached, causing water to cas
cade into the city, remained under way.
Two canals near the area were closed Monday as a
precaution, because of stronger-than-normal winds
and higher tides, spokesman Alan Dooley said. As of
late Monday afternoon, a steady stream of water
leaked through the repaired levees.
