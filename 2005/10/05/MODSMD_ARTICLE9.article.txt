## Physics Nobel recipients named 
### MATT MOORE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
STOCKHOLM. Sweden â€” Americans John L. Hall and
Roy J. Glauber and German Theodor W. Haensch won the
2005 Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for work that could lead
to better long-distance communication and more precise nav
igation worldwide and beyond.
The prize was given to the three for their work in applying
modern quantum physics to the study of optics. Engineers
have used their observations to improve lasers. Global Posi
tioning System technology and other instruments.
Glauber, 80, of Harvard University, took half of this year's
Nobel for showing how the particle nature of light affects its
behavior under certain circumstances. Although those condi
tions are rarely observed in nature, they are often relevant in
sophisticated optical instruments.
Hall, 71, of the University of Colorado, and Haensch. 63, of
the Ludwig-Maximilian-Universitaet in Munich, won "for
their contributions to the development of laser-based preci
sion spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb tech
nique."
Hall and Haensch will split one half of the $1.3 million
prize, with Glauber receiving the remainder.
"It's a huge surprises great pleasure," Hall said,noting that
the work was a team effort.
Speaking from his office in Munich, Haensch called the
award a high point of his career.
"I was speechless but of course very happy, exuberant," he
said. "Now, I am trying to get used to this."
He said the fruits of their work could eventually be applied
to improving communication across the globe and beyond.
The research could also be useful in helping spacecraft navi
gate more accurately on long journeys, or creating better dig
ital animation.
"Eventually, we may be able to enjoy three-dimensional
holographic movies," Haensch said.
"The important contributions by John Hall and Theodor
Haensch have made it possible to measure frequencies with
an accuracy of 15 digits," the academy noted. "Lasers with ex
tremely sharp colors can now be constructed, and with the fre
quency comb technique precise readings can be made of light
of all colors.
