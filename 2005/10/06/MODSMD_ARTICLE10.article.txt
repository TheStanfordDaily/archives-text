### MARK SHERMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
FBI is investigating whether a for
mer Marine took classified informa
tion from the White House when he
worked in the vice president's office
and passed it to Filipino officials, U.S.
government officials said yesterday.
Leandro Aragoncillo, 46, a 21-
year Marine veteran who became an
FBI intelligence analyst last year, al
ready has been charged in New Jer
sey with passing classified informa
tion about Filipino leaders to current
and former officials of that nation.
Aragoncillo worked at the White
House from 1999 to 2001 and was as
signed to the vice president's office
under both A1 Gore and Dick Ch
eney.
White House officials said they
were aware of the investigation but
would provide no details.
"It is an ongoing investigation
and as such all questions should be
directed to the FBI," White House
press secretary Scott McClellan said.
"We are cooperating fully with the
investigation."
Justice Department spokesman
Brian Roehrkasse said the depart
ment would not comment on an on
going investigation, first reported
Wednesday evening by ABC.
A law enforcement official,
speaking on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitivity of the case,
said investigators were examining all
of Aragoncillo's postings where he
had access to classified information,
including the White House.
Aragoncillo was hired to work at
the Army's Fort Monmouth, N.J., in
July 2004 and began sending classi

fied information and documents in
January, according to an FBI com
plaint made public last month. The
documents' contents have not been
made public.
From May to Aug. 15 of this year,
he printed or downloaded 101 classi
fied documents relating to the
Philippines, of which 37 were classi
fied "secret," according to the crimi
nal complaint.
He sent some of the material to
Michael Ray Aquino, a former
deputy director of the Philippines
national police who lives in New
York City, the complaint said.
Both men were arrested Sept. 10
at their homes and ordered held
without bail following an appear
ance before a federal magistrate.
After his arrest, Aragoncillo "es
sentially admitted that he took clas
sified information," Assistant U.S.
Attorney Karl H. Buch told the
magistrate.
A Philippine opposition senator
has acknowledged that he received
information from Aquino. Sen. Pan
filo Lacson, a former national police
chief under whom Aquino served,
said he and "many others" received
information passed by Aquino, but
he played down the value of the re
ports, describing them as "shallow
information."
Last month, Newark U.S. Attor
ney Christopher J. Christie said there
was no evidence that the administra
tion of Philippine President Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo was involved, but
he would not say if the suspects were
in contact with opposition factions.
The Asian nation has been beset by
persistent coup rumors since Arroyo
was accused of rigging last year's
elections.
