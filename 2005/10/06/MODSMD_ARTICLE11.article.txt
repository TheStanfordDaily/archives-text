## OPEN EARS 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK Bridge Center offers refreshing peer counseling 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Word to freshmen: It's not so bad.
This is sophomore Laura Mesa's con
tention as she reminisces about her past
days as a Stanford freshman. According to
Mesa, "Everyone makes freshman year
seem so daunting, but it's not scary at all."
It seems intimidating, all right, not just
for freshmen, but for upperclassmen as
well. Roommate tensions, dormcest and
spring quarter's housing Draw can make
dorm-life difficult and dramatic. Extracur
ricular activities can consume as much
time as energy. And of course, there is the
academic pressure built up by advisors,
professors, fellow classmates, parents and
even yourself.
But let's reiterate: It's not so bad. Stan
ford is a unique university in that it seeks
to enhance its students' lives outside of ac
ademics and athletics as well as invests in
the emotional and mental health of its
community.
Ryan Rennaker. former resident assis
tant (RA) in Otero and current RAin
Xanadu, asserts that RAs have been
trained to deal with issues ranging from
eating disorders to roommate conflicts.
" RAs have to assess each situation indi
vidually," Rennaker says. "They know
which resources to bring into play. Some
situations may require involvement from
the residence dean. Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) or the Stan
ford Police."
Perhaps the most refreshing resource on
campus is the Bridge Peer Counseling Cen
ter. which is run for students by students.

The Bridge began in 1971 as a drug
counseling center in Grove House on
Mayfield Avenue under the supervision of
psychiatrist Vince D'Andrea. Now sta
tioned at Rogers House on Salvatierra
Walk next to the Campus Bike Shop, the
Bridge offers peer counseling to people
who walk in or phone in on its 24-hour hot
line. Those who stop by the center are
guaranteed confidential sessions, and
phone consultations are kept anonymous.
Each fall, the Bridge counselors see up
to 80 undergraduates and graduate stu
dents. A session can cover a diversity of is
sues, from eating disorders to substance
abuse, sexuality, relationships, depression
and grief. Many students, freshmen and
seniors alike, are facing such difficulties on
their own for the first time.
So who are these counselors?
They are students themselves. To be
come a Bridge Peer Counselor, interested
students must complete Education 193 A, a
two-unit course offered every quarter.The
class, run by CAPS psychologist Mary
Mendoza-Newman, educates its prospec
tive counselors about the issues that Stan
ford students typically deal with and teach
es them how to approach the problems in
productive ways.
According to co-terminal student
Shirin Golkar, a live-in counselor at the
Bridge, counseling sessions strive to give
the counselee a sense of control.
"The main goal of the Bridge method is
to offer empathetic listening, acknowl
edgement of the distress that the counse
lee is experiencing and empowerment by
helping the counselees develop their own
solutions," Golkar says.

While there are approximately 20
Bridge counselors, only Golkar and three of
her fellow colleagues — seniors Shameel
Ahmad and Vedita Bipat, and co-terminal
student Alex Rivas — are live-ins at Rogers
House. These three keep The Bridge run
ning 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Aside from counseling, the Bridge also
runs various programs for dorms, includ
ing massage and depression workshops.
Each year, the Bridge also organizes
Spring Faire as a fundraiser for its efforts.
ITie Bridge brings in nearly $30,000 in rev
enue each year through the Faire, approxi
mately half of which goes into running the
event and half of which goes into the
Bridge's counseling, education and public
ity campaigns.
While the main goal of the Bridge is to
counsel students, those who become in
volved take on other responsibilities as
well. During the day, the live-ins and the
out-of-house counselors schedule three
hour shifts, taking turns conducting ses
sions, answering the phones and working
on the logistics of the center. At night, the
live-ins keep phones close by their beds
and take shifts manning the hotline.
"It's a good community of people,"
Ahmad says.
Golkar adds, "We offer a very warm
community that freshmen and upperclass
men can become a part of [both as coun
selors and counselees]."

Word to freshmen: It's not so bad.
This is sophomore Laura Mesa's con
tention as she reminisces about her past
days as a Stanford freshman. According to
Mesa, "Everyone makes freshman year
seem so daunting, but it's not scary at all."
It seems intimidating, all right, not just
for freshmen, but for upperclassmen as
well. Roommate tensions, dormcest and
spring quarter's housing Draw can make
dorm-life difficult and dramatic. Extracur
ricular activities can consume as much
time as energy. And of course, there is the
academic pressure built up by advisors,
professors, fellow classmates, parents and
even yourself.
But let's reiterate: It's not so bad. Stan
ford is a unique university in that it seeks
to enhance its students' lives outside of ac
ademics and athletics as well as invests in
the emotional and mental health of its
community.
Ryan Rennaker. former resident assis
tant (RA) in Otero and current RAin
Xanadu, asserts that RAs have been
trained to deal with issues ranging from
eating disorders to roommate conflicts.
" RAs have to assess each situation indi
vidually," Rennaker says. "They know
which resources to bring into play. Some
situations may require involvement from
the residence dean. Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) or the Stan
ford Police."
Perhaps the most refreshing resource on
campus is the Bridge Peer Counseling Cen
ter. which is run for students by students.

The Bridge began in 1971 as a drug
counseling center in Grove House on
Mayfield Avenue under the supervision of
psychiatrist Vince D'Andrea. Now sta
tioned at Rogers House on Salvatierra
Walk next to the Campus Bike Shop, the
Bridge offers peer counseling to people
who walk in or phone in on its 24-hour hot
line. Those who stop by the center are
guaranteed confidential sessions, and
phone consultations are kept anonymous.
Each fall, the Bridge counselors see up
to 80 undergraduates and graduate stu
dents. A session can cover a diversity of is
sues, from eating disorders to substance
abuse, sexuality, relationships, depression
and grief. Many students, freshmen and
seniors alike, are facing such difficulties on
their own for the first time.
So who are these counselors?
They are students themselves. To be
come a Bridge Peer Counselor, interested
students must complete Education 193 A, a
two-unit course offered every quarter.The
class, run by CAPS psychologist Mary
Mendoza-Newman, educates its prospec
tive counselors about the issues that Stan
ford students typically deal with and teach
es them how to approach the problems in
productive ways.
According to co-terminal student
Shirin Golkar, a live-in counselor at the
Bridge, counseling sessions strive to give
the counselee a sense of control.
"The main goal of the Bridge method is
to offer empathetic listening, acknowl
edgement of the distress that the counse
lee is experiencing and empowerment by
helping the counselees develop their own
solutions," Golkar says.

While there are approximately 20
Bridge counselors, only Golkar and three of
her fellow colleagues — seniors Shameel
Ahmad and Vedita Bipat, and co-terminal
student Alex Rivas — are live-ins at Rogers
House. These three keep The Bridge run
ning 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Aside from counseling, the Bridge also
runs various programs for dorms, includ
ing massage and depression workshops.
Each year, the Bridge also organizes
Spring Faire as a fundraiser for its efforts.
ITie Bridge brings in nearly $30,000 in rev
enue each year through the Faire, approxi
mately half of which goes into running the
event and half of which goes into the
Bridge's counseling, education and public
ity campaigns.
