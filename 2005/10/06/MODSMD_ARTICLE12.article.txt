# Staying Sane
## Walking the talk—Daily staffers go wild, stay safe 
### NATALIE RAMOS HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Ihad every intention of working hard this weekend
without having any fun. But, it just wasn't meant to
be, as this Daily column mandates that 1 must oc
casionally leave my single in search of wild adventures
to discuss in my next column.
My friends' pleas for me to go out with them were
also too persuasive to deny. I couldn't resist my visit
ing gay guy friend's request fora fabulous night out in
San Francisco, and I didn't have a hot gay RA to pawn
him off on this time, so 1 was stuck taking him to the
Castro myself. So, against better judgment, 1 skipped
off fora full Saturday night of drinking and dancing,
rather than prepare for my earth-shattering upcoming
med school interview. Peer pressure is a bitch.
Fortunately, I got the Daily editor in chief to come
along for moral support and navigational assistance.
Of course, she was easily persuaded since she usually
can't turn down either dancing or a free drink. We de
cided to be good Daily staffers and practice party safe
ty techniques along the way. Walk your talk.
Not wanting to end up completely plastered and
foolish as I usually do at bars, I did a little preemptive
eating: a hearty, scrumptious dinner at Lag Dining ear
lier in the evening, followed by three espresso shots, a
lot of water, a bowl of cereal and a granola bar shortly
before heading out. Don't knock the carbs — they're
great for holding down liquor. And don't forget to
drink water — lots.
En route to our destination, we got lost in the city, as
usual. Afraid to ask for directions on a dark street, we
relied on our poor sense of direction. We accidentally
drove a few blocks on one-way O'Farrell Street — in
the wrong direction — but finally found our guest and
whisked him off to the Castro for some good, safe fun.
Our gorgeous boy immediately charmed the bar
tender at The Cafe (a popular gay bar at 2367 Market
Street) into giving us free drinks. Obeying good club
practices, we kept the drinks with us. despite being sur
rounded by a sea of beautiful gay men who probably
had no intention of date-raping us. In no time, we were
all over the dance floor with hundreds of sweaty,
rowdy, half-naked young men, including a group of re
cent Stanford grads. The venue was completely
packed, so we held hands to stay together and set a
meeting-up spot near the exit just in case someone got
separated in the masses.
Cosmo #2 got lost in the crowd (actually, I clumsily
dropped it on Camille's shoe), so I was only mildly
drunk by the time we departed. Although neither of us
showed any signs of inebriation — no altered moods,
loud speech, overly animated hands or actions, sleepi
ness or slurred speech, to name a few — we decided to
play it safe anyway and sober up at Baghdad Cafe
(open 24 hours at 2295 Market Street).
Roughly speaking, alcohol is eliminated from the
body at a rate of about one drink per hour (1 beer, 1
glass of wine or 1 oz. of hard liquor). After an hour of
sharing sexcapades and tiramisu, we drove safely back
home to the Farm. And I ended up doing homework
all day Sunday.
The moral of the story is to party hard but party
safe. Oh, and study hard, too.
