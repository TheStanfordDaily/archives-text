# Control emotions
## AND... rake in the dough 
### TINA HAN DESK EDITOR 
Have you ever struggled with picking the right stock
options, investing in new ventures or even just deciding
how much to bet when playing Texas I lold'em with friends
in the dorm? These financial decisions are the basis of a
study conducted by Assistant Psychology professor Brian
Knutson and Camelia Kuhnen, a doctoral candidate at the
Graduate School of Business. Through specifically exam
ining the brain. Knutson and Kuhnen were able show a
link between the activation of two brain areas related to
excitement and anxiety with financial decision-making.
The study, entitled "The Neural Basis of Financial
Risk-Taking," is one of the first pairings of economic and
neuroscience fields. The collaboration shows that emo
tion significantly influences judgment, especially in the
context of business. When it comes to making a financial
ly motivated decision, emotions become a huge factor
that can greatly affect the evaluator.
"The findings show that two areas of the brain in
volved in affect processing — the nucleus accumbens
and the anterior insula — play a role in the way investors
make financial choices," Kuhnen says.
Previous studies have shown that the nucleus accum
bens — linked to excitement — and the anterior insula
— linked to anxiety — are activated by external cues in
dicating potential gains and losses, respectively. Knutson
and Kuhnens most recent research goes even further.
"Our study shows that when the nucleus accumbens
is highly activated, people switch to more risk-seeking

behavior, while when the

insula is highly activat
ed, people switch to

more risk-averse
behavior," Kuh-

nen says.
"Thus, our
findings in
dicate that
it is possi
ble that the
external
cues irrele
vant to the
financial deci

sion at hand

could influence our
financial choices by ac
tivating the accumbens

or the insula."
The study instructed 19
Stanford doctoral students
to carry out an investment
task while having their
brains scanned with func
tional magnetic resonance

imaging (fMRI) at the Richard M. Lucas Center for Mag
netic Resonance Spectroscopy which is a part of Stan
ford's medical complex.
The goal that the subjects were to keep in mind was
earning as much money as possible from dividends paid

by three financial assets —
two different stocks and a
W bond. One stock was

deemed the "good"
stock which allowed the
subject to make
money while the

other was a "bad"
stock which lost
money for the

player. The bond
paid the same
amount of

money during
each trial.
Each subject

particpated in 200
separate trials. Each

person had to pick one
asset for his or her portfo
lio. Once the trial was com
pleted, the experimenter

would determine investment
errors made by the subject when

compared to an optimal strategy used
by a hypothetical rational, risk-neutral in-

dividual.
T\vo types of errors were common. "Risk-averse mis
takes" were made when people chose the bond even
when one of the stocks was a better option. "Risk-seek
ing mistakes" were also committed when a stock was cho

sen where the bond was a better strategy for the game.
"We found that activationn in the nucleus accumbens
two seconds before the choice was correlated with the
likelihood of the subject switching from picking the bond
to picking one of the stocks and with the likelihood of
making a risk-seeking mistake," Kuhnen notes. A similar
activation of the insula occurred two seconds right before
the subject made a risk-averse mistake. All in all, the
findings of the study showed a 75 percent probability of
subjects making rational and optimal choices."
The nucleus accumbens is an area in the brain that is
activated when someone anticipates a reward that satis
fies a primary need. An example used by Khunen de
scribes the nucleus accumbens as the area that comes
into play when a thirsty person expects water or when a
drug addict expects the next fix. The insula, on the other
hand, becomes active when someone sees something
completely revolting — possibly triggering anxiety.
Knutson and Kuhnen's study demonstrate how ex
ternal cues can affect their emotions and moods, leading
either to risky or to careful decision-making. Khunen
uses the example of a casino as a cue that encourages a
risk-seeking choice. She comments that the very nature
and atmosphere of a casino promotes risk-taking with
prizes and rewards galore. An insurance companion the
other hand, is an example of a cue that encourages a risk
averse choice, as its very business is to scare people into
being careful.
"Since we all have to make financial choices, the find
ings benefit individuals in addition to different econom
ic institutions," Kuhnen says.
