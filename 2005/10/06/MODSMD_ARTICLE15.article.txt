## The
						Insiders Meet Robin and Miri: Non-opinions columnists 
### 
Printed words can he misleading. They
look so authoritative, so removed and
objective. So we'll forgive you for
being taken in and thinking that this is an
opinions column. They have put us on the
opinions page after all. Or you might have
read our previous column and taken us for
advice columnists. It doesn't get much more
baldfaced than "Stay indoors during Orien
tation, and call your mom."
Don't be fooled. Miri only gives advice on
alternate Thursdays. Robin is too busy being
an RA at Synergy to bother much with coun
seling the rest of Stanford. (Neither of them
knows what pronoun should be used when
writing a column with another person, much
less whether third person is appropriate.)
Part anecdote, part ribald bragging, part self
referential musing, there's a lot of room in
our words to misunderestimate our purpos
es. Rest assured, we plan to confuse a few
people. As you read this, we are hatching
schemes to embellish the truth. But before
we give you the wrong impression entirely,
perhaps it is time we introduced ourselves.
We met our sophomore year, living in
Synergy. You may have heard of the place as
the meat-hating, vegetarian co-op where
everyone runs around naked all the time. For
us, it was a place of painfully long consensus
meetings about bagels, with meals of fresh
tomatoes and basil from the garden and a
spring afternoon spent tied to a Maypole as
mock sacrificial virgins.
Despite the Druidic rite, the bloodiest mo
ment in our history happened at the decided
ly civilized Cantor Arts Center. Miri valiantly
defended an enormous block of gouged out
wood, while Robin trumpeted the virtues of a
garishly painted Hockney. The stalemate
quickly degenerated into insults, threats and
general profanity. Needless to say, our aes
thetic senses are as opposed as Tofurkey is to
Tbrducken â€” though similar in sound, they
taste vastly different under the surface.
As different as our artistic sensibilities
mav be, we are both word nerds. With seven

different journals between us at any one
time, a column comes pretty naturally.
What's one more string of thoughts in a jum
ble of to-do lists, snatches of poetry, recipes,
dream logs and drafts of monologues? This
column is just the tip of an embarrassing ice
berg. Under the surface you'll find many
diary entries in which we spill our hearts like
12-year-old girls who have secret crushes on
everyone at school.
We read over the columns we've written,
and we hardly recognize ourselves. Who are
these distanced, experienced, even-toned,
sometimes cynical women? They are just en
listees in an illusory army dedicated to build
ing Robin's carefully crafted cult following.
As for Miri, she only hopes she won't be hor
ribly misunderstood. People are always mis
taking her poems about them for confes
sions of love, mistaking her confessions of
love for descriptions of weather.
It sounds like in all this we're advising
you not to trust us. We didn't mean to give
advice. Thursday is not advice day. And this
is not an advice column. If you're willing to
believe us, it's not really an opinions column
either. Our only shared opinion is that we
don't belong on the editorial page.
We set out at first to write a column ex
ploring the less-traveled roads of Stanford
life. The weddings at Memorial Church, the
late nights at KZSU. the most obscure Elec
trical Engineering lectures. We set out to find
another excuse to muse, alliterate, spout
aphorisms we don't believe in and pretend
to be hopelessly cooler than we actually are.
What we found were more reasons to be
lieve in that age-old maxim that one should
never let the truth stand in the way of a good
story. So if you want opinions, facts, advice or
information, you should probably be look
ing elsewhere.

If you really do need advice, or just want to
express your support for our growing cult fol
lowing, e-mail Robin at robinp@stanford.edu
or Miri at mhutcher@stanford.edu.
