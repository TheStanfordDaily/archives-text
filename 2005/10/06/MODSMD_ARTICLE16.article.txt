In defense of Yahoo! Music Unlimited
I wanted to take this opportunity to re
spond to Woody Glier's letter ("Free music
downloads ill-conceived, Apple users get
screwed." Oct. 3), and explain in fuller de
tail the pilot which we hope to launch with
Yahoo! Music Unlimited over the next few
weeks.
First, a little background: Stanford is in
the process of negotiating fora free pilot of
Yahoo! Music Unlimited for students. This
pilot is funded entirely by an anonymous
donor and Yahoo!, so no tuition or other
student fees are being used to support this
initiative. After the free pilot, students will
pay a discounted rate directly to Yahoo!.
Stanford's goal in exploring the possibil
ity of bringing an on-line subscription
music service to students was to give them
the chance to experience the service with
no financial risk. Unfortunately, because of
a strategic decision by Apple, there is no
subscription music service that may be

used with Macs or iPods.
A survey last year by Residential Com
puting indicated that 78 percent of the un
dergraduate students and 87 percent of the
graduate students who responded to the
survey own Windows-compatible comput
ers. So our choice was to do nothing for
everyone, or to do something for the rough
ly 80 percent of students who own a PC and
the increasing number of students who use
a portable music device other than an iPod.
Since there is no requirement that stu
dents enroll in the service, and since no Uni
versity funding is going towards supporting
the free pilot or discounted subscription
rates, the University decided to make the
Yahoo! service available to those who
choose to use it. This service is available to
all students who have the equipment and the
interest to use it â€” which, if you think about
it. is no different than any other service or
activity available on campus.
