In defense of Yahoo! Music Unlimited
I wanted to take this opportunity to re
spond to Woody Glier's letter ("Free music
downloads ill-conceived, Apple users get
screwed." Oct. 3), and explain in fuller de
tail the pilot which we hope to launch with
Yahoo! Music Unlimited over the next few
weeks.
First, a little background: Stanford is in
the process of negotiating fora free pilot of
Yahoo! Music Unlimited for students. This
pilot is funded entirely by an anonymous
donor and Yahoo!, so no tuition or other
student fees are being used to support this
initiative. After the free pilot, students will
pay a discounted rate directly to Yahoo!.
Stanford's goal in exploring the possibil
ity of bringing an on-line subscription
music service to students was to give them
the chance to experience the service with
no financial risk. Unfortunately, because of
a strategic decision by Apple, there is no
subscription music service that may be

used with Macs or iPods.
A survey last year by Residential Com
puting indicated that 78 percent of the un
dergraduate students and 87 percent of the
graduate students who responded to the
survey own Windows-compatible comput
ers. So our choice was to do nothing for
everyone, or to do something for the rough
ly 80 percent of students who own a PC and
the increasing number of students who use
a portable music device other than an iPod.
Since there is no requirement that stu
dents enroll in the service, and since no Uni
versity funding is going towards supporting
the free pilot or discounted subscription
rates, the University decided to make the
Yahoo! service available to those who
choose to use it. This service is available to
all students who have the equipment and the
interest to use it — which, if you think about
it. is no different than any other service or
activity available on campus.
Student opinion was both sought
and valued during every step of the
evaluation and implementation
process. 1 spoke with last year's
ASSU president and vice president
before we invited any music service
to submit a proposal. They nominat
ed two students to be on the evalua
tion committee. We also had a stu
dent resident computer coordinator
on the committee. The viewpoints of
these important members of the
evaluation team were key, both in the
decision to move forward with the

initiative and in the selection of
Yahoo! from among the available
providers of subscription music serv
ices.
1 hope students will see that, while
maybe not perfect for everyone, this
is a great opportunity for students to
check out a very robust music service
for free. Think of it like receiving a
discount coupon fora product or
service. Not everyone likes pizza.
And not everyone needs their
clothes dry cleaned. But for those
who do, it is nice to have a coupon
I hope this helps to clarify our
thinking and decision-making
process.
