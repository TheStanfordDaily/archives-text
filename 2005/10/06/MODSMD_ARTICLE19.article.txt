## Confused intuitions about happiness 
### 
We have been wrong about happiness.
Here is my solution.Take the follow
ing thought experiment by Robert
Nozick: Imagine you are given the choice be
tween your life and a complicated nerve appa
ratus that will feed you with semi-erotic pleas
ure waves and make you believe that you
have accomplished your every purpose.
Which choice would you accept? It is natural
to expect most people to choose their lives.
On the other hand, suppose a friend of
yours is upset because she didn't do well on
her test. I think most people's intuition would
be to console her and tell her that she could
still make up for it. Suppose your friend failed
all her classes. Again, most people would try to
console her — "You'll do better next year."
The friend herself would expect consolation.
Suppose your friend started thinking that she
is a failure, and maybe she should consider
suicide. Again, most people would try to con
vince her otherwise. Suppose your friend at
tempted suicide... You get the idea. There
seem to be a point where we feel the
need to admit that things are bad, and that's
all there is to it.
We all strive for happiness — that's a
given. What I believe to be a confusion of (or
a contradiction in) our basic intuitions about
happiness is (a) our investment in truth and

our consequent antagonism toward self-de
ception (as exemplified by Nozick's thought
experiment) and (b) our endeavor to avoid
suffering and unhappiness at all costs and al
ways to maximize happiness (as in the in
stance of the suicidal friend). I think that (a)
and (b) are incompatible and that we must
forego one.
The argument is rather simple. If we are
going to cut back on losses and try to maxi
mize happiness no matter what the reality is,
why are we interested in the truth in the first
place? The investment in truth seems extra
neous, and self-deception should be the
norm.
Some might try to argue that self-decep
tion is a permissible way to attain happiness,
but that self-deception becomes impossible
after a degree. Hence, since no Nozickian
nerve apparatus exists, we need reality. After
all. who could believe that 2+2=5? However,
I believe that, by definition, rational powers
involve the capacity to be irrational, and that
with sufficient mental discipline, anyone can
believe that 2+2=5.
Truth is an end in itself. Even if someone
were to reject this conclusion and engage in
self-deception to be happy, she would only be
doing this because she thought this was the
right psychological and/or epistemological

position. The first rejection of truth and the
subsequent attempt to adopt the correct
mindset is in tension, if not in overt contra
diction. For this reason. I am led to choose (a)
commitment to truth, and forego (b) indis
criminate maximization of happiness.
My conviction is very simple — if we
value truth and want to avoid self-deception,
we must acknowledge at times that it is JUS
TIFIED to be unhappy, and that we should
therefore at these times feel unhappy. A de
fault, consolatory attitude offends the re
spect for truth. Correct as though it may
seem, I have never had anyone tell me. "Yes,
it is okay to feel bad. Yes, you have screwed
up, so feel free to feel bad."
1 think as a society we have an unjustifi
able hysteria against suffering, against ac
knowledging that sometimes the reality dic
tates unhappiness. Nietzsche's critique of
Christian morality deserves examination for
a lot of reasons, but one thing he pointed out
(rightly so) was that the zeal against suffering
was actually detrimental to humanity's de
velopment. If ignorance is bliss, wisdom is ac
cepting misery.

Suppose your friend started thinking that she
is a failure, and maybe she should consider
suicide. Again, most people would try to con
vince her otherwise. Suppose your friend at
tempted suicide... You get the idea. There
seem to be a point where we feel the
need to admit that things are bad, and that's
all there is to it.
We all strive for happiness — that's a
given. What I believe to be a confusion of (or
a contradiction in) our basic intuitions about
happiness is (a) our investment in truth and

our consequent antagonism toward self-de
ception (as exemplified by Nozick's thought
experiment) and (b) our endeavor to avoid
suffering and unhappiness at all costs and al
ways to maximize happiness (as in the in
stance of the suicidal friend). I think that (a)
and (b) are incompatible and that we must
forego one.
The argument is rather simple. If we are
going to cut back on losses and try to maxi
mize happiness no matter what the reality is,
why are we interested in the truth in the first
place? The investment in truth seems extra
neous, and self-deception should be the
norm.
Some might try to argue that self-decep
tion is a permissible way to attain happiness,
but that self-deception becomes impossible
after a degree. Hence, since no Nozickian
nerve apparatus exists, we need reality. After
all. who could believe that 2+2=5? However,
I believe that, by definition, rational powers
involve the capacity to be irrational, and that
with sufficient mental discipline, anyone can
believe that 2+2=5.
Truth is an end in itself. Even if someone
were to reject this conclusion and engage in
self-deception to be happy, she would only be
doing this because she thought this was the
right psychological and/or epistemological

position. The first rejection of truth and the
subsequent attempt to adopt the correct
mindset is in tension, if not in overt contra
diction. For this reason. I am led to choose (a)
commitment to truth, and forego (b) indis
criminate maximization of happiness.
My conviction is very simple — if we
value truth and want to avoid self-deception,
we must acknowledge at times that it is JUS
TIFIED to be unhappy, and that we should
therefore at these times feel unhappy. A de
fault, consolatory attitude offends the re
spect for truth. Correct as though it may
seem, I have never had anyone tell me. "Yes,
it is okay to feel bad. Yes, you have screwed
up, so feel free to feel bad."
1 think as a society we have an unjustifi
able hysteria against suffering, against ac
knowledging that sometimes the reality dic
tates unhappiness. Nietzsche's critique of
Christian morality deserves examination for
a lot of reasons, but one thing he pointed out
(rightly so) was that the zeal against suffering
was actually detrimental to humanity's de
velopment. If ignorance is bliss, wisdom is ac
cepting misery.
