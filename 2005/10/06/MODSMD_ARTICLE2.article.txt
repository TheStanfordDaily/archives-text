# Panel eyes Tibetan peace
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD DESK EDITOR 
Not solely for students whose cars
feature "Free Tibet" bumper stickers
nor for those who camped out to be first
in line to acquire tickets for November's
sold out appearance of His Holiness the
Dalai Lama,last night's panel discussion
on "Peace, Non-violence and Human
Rights" kicked off a series of talks de
signed to educate those looking for the
deeper meaning behind *he Tibetan
Freedom movement.

Hosted by the Stanford Friends of
Tibet (SFOT) in Cubberley Auditorium,
the panel featured Tenzin Tethong, for
mer cabinet member of the Tibetan Gov
ernment-in-exile, Chris McKenna, execu
tive director of the Tibet Justice Center;
and Kim Morris of the Trace Foundation.
Moderating the discussion was Giovanni
Vasallo. president of the Bay Area
Friends of Tibet.
"We're try ing to educate the Stanford
community on issues related to Tibet so
they might appreciate the visit of the
Dalai Lama more," said Star Lee. a grad

uate student in neuroscience and SFOT
secretary. "I don't think the Stanford
community is aware of all the issues sur
rounding Tibet."
The panelists focused on issues includ
ing China's human rights violations in
Tibet as well as the Tibetan commitment
to nonviolent resistance.
"I think there's a shift in trying uman
rights in a much broader context, includ
ing looking at the way people are actual
ly living," McKenna told the audience.

Panelists discuss Tibet last night at Cubberlev Auditorium.
"The political prisoner (issue) is always
going to be there."
According to Tethong, no real de
velopment has taken place over the last
50 years, and there is no guarantee li
betans will continue their practice of
nonviolence.
"Simply to have ;tn image (>f I Ibetans
as peaceful and nonviolent is not quite
correct," he said. "The vast majority of
Tibetans are on a nonviolent course, but
many have absolutely no resources or
abilities to resist with violence."
McKenna concurred.
"Tibetans aren't the only group fo
cused on destabilizing one-party rule in
China; rural areas everywhere are pret
ty bad,"he said. "The level of dissatisfac
tion in China is very high, and under-re
portedly high."
Morris pointed out that while much
of the world focuses on individual cases,
collective rights — such as health care,
education, housing and employment
— are just as important, adding that po
tential inroads in health care and
tourism are a double-edged sword.
"We need to be preserving tradi
tional medical practices." she said. " I lie
style of tourism is often not very envi
ronmentally friendly and may not give
people a true picture of the culture."
For concerned students such as Lee,
Tibetan culture — not politics — de
serves the spotlight.
"We don't want to make this seem
very political." she said." 1 used to think
this was a lost cause. It still might be the
case, but there is a culture that's being

lost."
Lee doesn't have to look far to find
a situation that compares.
"It would be a great tragedy if Ti
betan culture ended up like Native
American culture here," she said.
SFOT plans to continue the lecture
series each Wednesday leading up to
the Dalai Lama's visit. Next week's
theme features "Impermanence, Em
pathy and Compassion," and will be
led by Arjia Rinpoche, Abbot of the
Kumbum Monastery in Tibet.
