Not solely for students whose cars
feature "Free Tibet" bumper stickers
nor for those who camped out to be first
in line to acquire tickets for November's
sold out appearance of His Holiness the
Dalai Lama,last night's panel discussion
on "Peace, Non-violence and Human
Rights" kicked off a series of talks de
signed to educate those looking for the
deeper meaning behind *he Tibetan
Freedom movement.

Hosted by the Stanford Friends of
Tibet (SFOT) in Cubberley Auditorium,
the panel featured Tenzin Tethong, for
mer cabinet member of the Tibetan Gov
ernment-in-exile, Chris McKenna, execu
tive director of the Tibet Justice Center;
and Kim Morris of the Trace Foundation.
Moderating the discussion was Giovanni
Vasallo. president of the Bay Area
Friends of Tibet.
"We're try ing to educate the Stanford
community on issues related to Tibet so
they might appreciate the visit of the
Dalai Lama more," said Star Lee. a grad

uate student in neuroscience and SFOT
secretary. "I don't think the Stanford
community is aware of all the issues sur
rounding Tibet."
The panelists focused on issues includ
ing China's human rights violations in
Tibet as well as the Tibetan commitment
to nonviolent resistance.
"I think there's a shift in trying uman
rights in a much broader context, includ
ing looking at the way people are actual
ly living," McKenna told the audience.
