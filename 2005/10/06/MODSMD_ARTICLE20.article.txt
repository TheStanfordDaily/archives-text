## Cancer as a college issue: How young adults are waging the war 
### THOMAS G. BURISH 
Oh, the excitement of college traditions.
For me, one of the best of these happens at
my alma mater, the University of Notre
Dame, where I am provost. At every Notre
Dame basketball game, a throng of more
than 3,000 frenzied students takes over an
entire section of Joyce Center Stadium.They
call themselves the Leprechaun Legion and
you can't miss them.
I love taking in that sight, and not just out
of alumni pride. It stirs my heart knowing
that while they wear their school spirit on
their sleeve, these Fighting Irish are also
fighting fora lifesaving cause. These student
fans donate sales proceeds from every lep
rechaun Legion shirt to the Coaches vs. Can
cer program, contributing to the more than
$22 million the initiative has raised for the

American Cancer Society nationwide. I be
lieve college faculty and staff should do all
we can to build on this growing ground swell
of student support in the fight against cancer.
In the cancer world, we are at a turning
point of massive potential. Scientific projec
tions give us every reason to believe that the
falling rates of cancer incidence and death
will continue to drop if we act on what we
have learned about the disease to date. The
people who will take that turn are the young
adults preparing to enter fields such as med
icine, science, law, education and business,
and who will become the next generation of
community leaders, volunteers and parents.
Though cancer might seem an unlikely
health concern for young people — cancer
affects most people after middle age — no
one of any age can escape being touched by
the disease in some way.

I talk to students every year who have suf
fered the loss of a parent or grandparent to
the disease. And with survival rates of child
hood cancers now higher than 70 percent,
there are more than 10,000 cancer survivors
enrolled at colleges around the country.
The widespread effects of this disease ex
plain, in part, the motivation behind groups
such as the 25 college students who made the
4.000-mile bicycle trek from Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore to the Golden Gate
Bridge in San Francisco this summer. Origi
nally founded to memorialize a student's fa
ther, the Hopkins 4K for Cancer has become
a fundraising and educational phenomenon.
The Hopkins 4K riders' mission reflects
their energy and ambition: "We will educate
ourselves on the issue of cancer and remem
ber those who have been affected by the dis
ease. We will draw on our idealism and help

spread awareness about cancer across the
country."
With that kind of spirit, events like these
hold great promise for developing a base of
committed, educated fighters in the war on
cancer. Already the American Cancer Soci
ety counts young adults as its fastest-growing
volunteer segment. In fact, money raised by
young volunteers doubled in 2004.1 think the
time is right to capitalize on that support and
help our nation's youth reach one another
with important health messages.
Consider the fact that nearly two-thirds of
cancers are caused by preventable lifestyle
factors. When leaving their homes and enter
ing college, many young people get their first
taste of freedom. They can eat what they
want, behave how they want, smoke if they
want. They have the newfound power —
without parental restrictions — to take their

behavior in any direction. Habits formed in
college and earlier often stick fora lifetime.
There is not a more critical time to start
thinking about unhealthy behaviors than be
fore they become ingrained habits.
We know, for example, that cancers
caused by cigarette smoking could be pre
vented completely. In 2005, more than
175,000 cancer deaths are expected to be
caused by tobacco use — yet approximately
30 percent of college students are current to
bacco users.
We know that regular screening tests can
result in the prevention or early detection of
many cancers, such as cervical, colon, breast,
prostate and skin cancers. Routine health
checkups beginning at an early age are im
portant for monitoring medical histories and
