## Bruch advances at All-American Main draw scheduled to begin today in Oklahoma 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, before many of us had
risen for morning classes, freshman
Matt Bruch had already handily won
his third-round match to advance to
the Round of 16 at the Polo Ralph
Lauren All-American Tennis Cham
pionships in Tulsa, Okla.
In the previous round on Tues
day, Pramod Dabir, a senior from
Illinois, put forth a valiant effort
and battled Bruch in two tight sets,
including a tiebreaker in the second
set. Yesterday, however, Bruch took
care of Oklahoma's Tommy Garri
son quickly, giving up only two
games in the first set and none in
the second.
The Tulsa tournament marked
Bruch's Stanford debut but the
rookie hardly showed his lack of col
legiate experience on the court.
"Matt has played some big-time
tennis before and has been in pretty
major situations," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "College is a little
different, but the guy is a heck of a
tennis player. He's handled it well so
far."
Bruch also teamed with junior
James Wan to collect an 8-4 win
over Air Force on Tuesday. Howev
er, in the following round, the pair
couldn't quite get into a rhythm
and was defeated by a team from
New Mexico.The Lobos have given
the Cardinal trouble in past All-
American tournaments; in 2004,
New Mexico's Ryan Stotland and
David Kowalski handed senior KC
Corkery and recent graduate Sam
Warburg a defeat in the Round of
16.
"[New Mexico] played very well,
and our guys couldn't quite get into
the match," Whitlinger said. "They
made us pay for every mistake we
made."
Players who advance to the
Round of 16 of the qualifying sin

gles draw will now have the oppor
tunity to compete in the main draw.
The tournament's first rounds of
main draw singles and doubles are
scheduled to begin today and con
tinue through Sunday at the Uni
versity ofTlilsa.
As the eighth seed for the singles
tournament, Corkery finds himself
in the top half of the main draw
while Wan prepares to face a qualifi
er in his first round match in the bot
tom half of the draw. In main draw
doubles action, Corkery teams up
with junior James Pade to take on
Rice's Ben Harknett and Robert
Searle, two experienced players
from England.
The Cardinal players not compet
ing in the All-American are sched
uled to travel to Santa Clara, Calif.,
with assistant coach Dave Hodge
and volunteer coach J.J. Whitlinger.
There, the players plan to enter the
Bronco Classic, which consists of
three flights: A. Band C.
In 2004, senior Jon Wong cap
tured the C-Flight singles title by de
feating a player from Washington in
the finals. The Los Altos native ulti
mately clinched the match in a third
set tiebreaker.
Although the next tournament of
the season won't be fora couple of
weeks, Whitlinger looks forward to
the Bronco Classic so that he can
gauge where members of the team
stand as the 2005 season kicks off. He
plans to use this tournament to eval
uate incoming freshmen as well as
returning players before the ITA
Regionals, which are scheduled for
Oct. 21 in Santa Clara.
"I hope our guys play each other
this weekend," Whitlinger said. "I
hope we get to the semis and the fi
nals and play each other. That will
tell me a little bit about what might
go on later on down the road, lineup
wise.
"It's early fora tournament, but
it's good to get guys in the tourna
ment setting and see what they do
well and what they need to work on,"
Whitlinger added. "I can't wait to see
what goes on in Santa Clara."

"I hope our guys play each other
this weekend," Whitlinger said. "I
hope we get to the semis and the fi
nals and play each other. That will
tell me a little bit about what might
go on later on down the road, lineup

"It's early fora tournament, but
it's good to get guys in the tourna

Whitlinger added. "I can't wait to see

Senior KC Corkery, the eighth seed at the All-American, begins singles match play today. He
will also team up with junior James Pade in the doubles draw.
Yesterday, before many of us had
risen for morning classes, freshman
Matt Bruch had already handily won
his third-round match to advance to
the Round of 16 at the Polo Ralph
Lauren All-American Tennis Cham
pionships in Tulsa, Okla.
In the previous round on Tues
day, Pramod Dabir, a senior from
Illinois, put forth a valiant effort
and battled Bruch in two tight sets,
including a tiebreaker in the second
set. Yesterday, however, Bruch took
care of Oklahoma's Tommy Garri
son quickly, giving up only two
games in the first set and none in
the second.
The Tulsa tournament marked
Bruch's Stanford debut but the
rookie hardly showed his lack of col
legiate experience on the court.
"Matt has played some big-time
tennis before and has been in pretty
major situations," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "College is a little
different, but the guy is a heck of a
tennis player. He's handled it well so
far."
Bruch also teamed with junior
James Wan to collect an 8-4 win
over Air Force on Tuesday. Howev
er, in the following round, the pair
couldn't quite get into a rhythm
and was defeated by a team from
New Mexico.The Lobos have given
the Cardinal trouble in past All-
American tournaments; in 2004,
New Mexico's Ryan Stotland and
David Kowalski handed senior KC
Corkery and recent graduate Sam
Warburg a defeat in the Round of
16.
"[New Mexico] played very well,
and our guys couldn't quite get into
the match," Whitlinger said. "They
made us pay for every mistake we
made."
Players who advance to the
Round of 16 of the qualifying sin

gles draw will now have the oppor
tunity to compete in the main draw.
The tournament's first rounds of
main draw singles and doubles are
scheduled to begin today and con
tinue through Sunday at the Uni
versity ofTlilsa.
As the eighth seed for the singles
tournament, Corkery finds himself
in the top half of the main draw
while Wan prepares to face a qualifi
er in his first round match in the bot
tom half of the draw. In main draw
doubles action, Corkery teams up
with junior James Pade to take on
Rice's Ben Harknett and Robert
Searle, two experienced players
from England.
The Cardinal players not compet
ing in the All-American are sched
uled to travel to Santa Clara, Calif.,
with assistant coach Dave Hodge
and volunteer coach J.J. Whitlinger.
There, the players plan to enter the
Bronco Classic, which consists of
three flights: A. Band C.
In 2004, senior Jon Wong cap
tured the C-Flight singles title by de
feating a player from Washington in
the finals. The Los Altos native ulti
mately clinched the match in a third
set tiebreaker.
Although the next tournament of
the season won't be fora couple of
weeks, Whitlinger looks forward to
the Bronco Classic so that he can
gauge where members of the team
stand as the 2005 season kicks off. He
plans to use this tournament to eval
uate incoming freshmen as well as
returning players before the ITA
Regionals, which are scheduled for
Oct. 21 in Santa Clara.
"I hope our guys play each other
this weekend," Whitlinger said. "I
hope we get to the semis and the fi
nals and play each other. That will
tell me a little bit about what might
go on later on down the road, lineup
wise.
"It's early fora tournament, but
it's good to get guys in the tourna
ment setting and see what they do
well and what they need to work on,"
Whitlinger added. "I can't wait to see
what goes on in Santa Clara."
