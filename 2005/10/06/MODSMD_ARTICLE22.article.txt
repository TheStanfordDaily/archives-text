## Ice Hockey squad gets fresh start under new leadership

With so much intensity filling the crowded stadiums
that host top-notch NCAA competition, it's easy to be
drawn to the big-name sports events on campus. But out
side the spotlight of the University's stellar varsity
teams, Stanford is fortunate enough to find this same en
joyment in a less publicized, yet equally, exciting area of
the sports scene.
Along with Maples Pavilion and the Stanford Stadi
um, the Belmont Iceland — home to Stanford's ice
hockey club team - turns out to be another site for Car

dinal-style competition, talent and athletic success.
A member of the American College Hockey Associ
ation, the ice hockey team holds practice twice a week
and competes almost every weekend — including two
games this weekend — between the months of Septem
ber and February. The ice hockey squad's schedule fea
tures Pacific-8 Conference competition (against every
Pac-10 school except Arizona and Oregon State) as well
as matchups against other teams from across the nation.
After firing its previous coach at the end of a frustrat
ing losing season last year. Stanford's ice hockey team is
ready fora new start. Current coach Howard Neckowitz
could be just what the team needs to turn over a streak
of disappointing seasons marked by losses and a lack of
commitment.
Team captain Taku Ide, a Stanford undergraduate
alumnus, is highly optimistic about this year's revamped

hockey program.
"[Coach Neckowitz] seems like the one who can pull
us together and increase the level of commitment," Ide
said. "His focus is primarily on teamwork, skating and
developing aspects that Stanford hockey has lacked in
the past. He is a very level-headed guy and knows what
to do."
Stanford hopes Neckowitz's debut as head coach
marks a turnaround in the club ice hockey program.
Over the past six years, the team has been hindered by
an inability to find a coach willing to stick with the squad
for more than a year and a half.The team has had to work
with a new coach every season, a problem Ide claims
could be attributed to the lack of commitment on the
players' part.
This year, however, it's different.
More than 20 players showed up for
the team's first official practice this
week, a definite improvement over
the average of 10 players who com
peted last year. Along with the
hopeful attitude regarding the new
coach, there is also reason to be op
timistic about the talent of this
year's group. Incoming players have
a lot of potential — freshman Max
Guise, in particular, is showing great
promise.
After several preseason meetings
and its first practice yesterday, there
already appears to be a noticeable
change in the attitude of this team
compared to those of recent years.
But what has sparked this drastic
turnaround?
In the past, the>team had-issues
with commitment, as well as with
publicizing the club. This year, mem
bers of the club hockey program —
including sophomore team president
Andy Meyerson, grad student Toyo
Shimano, sophomore Bobby Borek
and sophomore Zach Klurfeld —
have invested a lot of effort into in
creasing awareness of and enthusi
asm for the sport at Stanford.Though
the team is larger than it has been, the
club is still open to anyone interested
in participating.
In a league in which the skills of
the different teams tend generally to
be well-matched, success is all about
a team's attitude. And if all goes well,
this year's team could go far with a
winning mentality.
Ide is confident that the squad has
a shot at the Pac-8 title, which would
then pave the way to the Western Re
gionals.The team travels to Washing
ton this weekend to take on the
Huskies in its first two games of the
season.
But whatever happens, this sea
son deserves some attention;
whether it's to check out players, hav
ing some fun before a party or to just
witness good hockey and great Stan
ford competition.
