# Ozzie & Co. respect game rather than rest

Even if they are cursed for throwing the 1919
World Series, sports fans everywhere should
give the Chicago White Sox a high-five for
maintaining some semblance of integrity last week
end. With the team's playoff berth locked up, the
White Sox didn't really have to play their stars in the
season-ending series with the Cleveland Indians.
But for the most part, they did, not succumbing to
the temptation to "rest" the stars for this week's
playoff action. With the tone thus set, the White Sox
went out and swept the would-be wild-card Cleve
land Indians.
Who cares? Actually, a lot of people. Cleveland
and Boston were locked in a tense race for the wild
card playoff spot, and the way Chicago played
against the Indians figured prominently in sorting
out the myriad permutations.
Though criticized fora "patchwork" lineup on
Friday night, the White Sox nonetheless gave
plenty of play to A.J. Pierzynski, Scott Podsednik
and Paul Konerko. They also declined to rest their
pitching lineup, showcasing Mark Buehrle, 18-
game winner John Garland and Orlando Hernan
dez.
Manager Ozzie Guillen rolled out the competi
tive spirit: "I want to sweep these guys." His will be
came the way, and the Mistake on the Lake went
home empty after Boston took two games from the
New York Yankees.
Chicago, for its part, didn't look tired on Tuesday,
dismantling the Red Sox 14-2 in the ALDS opener.
It could have been worse. Mike Shanahan could
have been Chicago's manager.
With a playoff spot locked up in late 2003, the
Denver Broncos coach benched ("rested") quarter
back Jake Plummer and tight end Shannon Sharpe
for their season-ending game at Green Bay.
The most deservedly pissed people were the
Minnesota Vikings and their fans. A Green Bay loss
would have sent the Vikings into the postseason —
but Green Bay wasn't playing the same Broncos
that the rest of the NFL had to play. As a result, the
Packers won going away, 31-3.
As for the Vikings, they handed the Packers the
playoff berth when they allowed the woeful Cardi
nals a game-winning touchdown pass with no time
left. I'm not making excuses for the Vikings, but they
certainly were not playing on a level field when it
came to the playoff scenarios.
The Broncos wouldn't dare pull this scheme at
home — the faithful Denver season ticket holders
would explode. But they didn't have any problem
playing out their farce in front of the Cheeseheads
at Lambeau Field.
TV commentators defended the move with logic
like,"they have to do this; it will make them stronger
for the playoffs." Hmm, maybe not — the next week
Denver went into Indy and got hammered. 41-10,
despite having beaten the Colts earlier in the sea
son.3l-17.
At least someone had some sense that weekend.
Ravens coach Brian Billick left his starters in, even
after the Cleveland-Cincinnati result had clinched
Baltimore's division title. Tailback Jamal Lewis was

able to chase the single-season rush
ing record right to the end of the
overtime game against the Steelers.
When asked why he took the in
jury risk when the playoff spot had
been decided, Billick said, "You
can't cheat the game,you can't cheat
the fans."
Sounds like a plan to me.
Another story to learn from: the
2001-2002 Detroit Red Wings (for
those who remember the NHL)
loafed their lineups after clinching
the President's Cup for the best
NHL record.The strategy from Hall
of Fame coach Scotty Bowman
turned out to be disastrous come
playoff time, as the Wings went limp
in two home losses to Vancouver be
fore righting the ship. Detroit went
on to survive a seven-game series
with the hated Colorado Avalanche
and hoisted the Stanley Cup after
five games against Carolina.
So the White Sox earned some
sports karma, in my book at least,
and are now butting heads with the
team they helped put into the post
season. Whatever the result, we'll
know they always played hard —
even when they didn't really have to.
