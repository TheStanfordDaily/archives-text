### ROHAN PURANIK 
After a tough loss against Nor-
Pac rival Pacific in conference play
last Sunday, the Stanford women's
field hockey team (3-9, 1-2) hopes
to get back on track against David
son and continue the potential suc
cess through the upcoming road
trip.
"We'll go into [the Davidson
game] with the same outlook as for
all our other games," said head coach
Lesley Irvine of Friday's match. "We
take care of our own game. We take a
look at Davidson's strengths and
weaknesses. We'd like to come out of
there with a win."
The team started off well against
Pacific in a rematch of a contest held
two weeks ago. Sophomore mid
fielder/forward Jess Zutz scored
twice in the first half on Sunday, but
the squad failed to maintain the lead
and fell to Pacific's offensive on
slaught toward the end of the game.
"After a disappointing loss
against UOP, we're hoping to do
more in this game," Irvine said.
"We're trying to be really consistent
in the way we play. I think it's really
about playing 70 minutes of good
hockey."
Irvine indicated that despite the
squad's high hopes for this weekend,
the Cardinal are having problems
with consistency.
"We have periods of good play.

not continuous solid play," Irvine
said. "We're getting punished for
that."
Davidson is the first of three op
ponents that Stanford is scheduled
to face on its East Coast tour this
weekend. The Cardinal plan to take
on No. 3 North Carolina (8-2) and
top-ranked Wake Forest (10-0) in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
Davidson (2-6,0-2) comes off of a
victory over Catawba in which the
Wildcats' sophomore midfielder/
forward Catherine Ransone scored
three goals in the second half to take
the lopsided victory, 10-1.
Meanwhile, the Wake Forest
squad blanked the Tar Heels 2-0 last
week to continue its unbeaten sea
son. The Demon Deacons' freshman
midfield/forward Christine Suggs
and midfielder/back Maeke Boreel
both scored to capture the win.
The Cardinal are scheduled to
face the Tar Heels at 1 p.m. ET on
Sunday and Wake Forest at 4 p.m.
ET on Monday.
Irvine admitted that the team
does face tough competition but that
facing some of the nation's best is
crucial to Stanford's development
this season.
"It's important to play at this
level," Irvine said. "It's a very chal
lenging level, and it should help us
improve our play."
Friday's match in North Carolina
is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. ET.
