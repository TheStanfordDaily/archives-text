# Cardinal meet potent UW squad
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI 
The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team will meet a
number of challenges this season, but few can compare to
those the squad faces this weekend.
Before winning last season's national championship, the
Cardinal met then-top-ranked Washington in an unforget
table November match at Burnham Pavilion. After dropping
the first two games to the I luskies,the Cardinal mounted an
explosive comeback, eventually taking the final game into
overtime before a thunderous crowd. Stanford would go on
defeat to the Huskies again in the semifinals of the NCAA
Tournament.
Many consider the Washington contest to be the confi
dence boost that drove the Cardinal through the end of the
regular season and playoffs.
"It was definitely one of the best matches I've ever seen,"
head coach John Dunning said. "Confidence isn't something
you can create or wish for. but those kinds of close situations
really give you confidence."
The No. 2 Huskies (12-0,3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) ar
rive at Maples Pavilion this Saturday to battle Stanford (15-
1,4-0) at 7 p.m. And if this year's encounter between the top
Pac-10 teams is anything like last season's epic, then both the
Cardinal and the 1 luskies are in for one long Saturday night.
The defending Pac-10 champion Huskies enter Satur
day's contest as a favorite to win the conference as well as a
major contender for the national championship. One season
removed from its best season in school history, Washington
remains the only team in the nation that has yet to drop a
game in 2005.
Washington features an explosive offense responsible
for the nation's best hitting percentage (.423). At the helm is
sophomore middle blocker Alesha Deesing, who owns a
.540 percentage. Other major threats include sophomore
outside hitter Christal Morrison and senior middle blocker
Darla Myhre, with hitting percentages of .412 and .4 l X). re
spectively.
According to Dunning, stopping the Huskies' offense
should provide a formidable challenge.
"Like last year. Washington is very efficient and does not
make mistakes," he said. "For us, it's all about starting with
the fundamentals. If you serve and pass well, you can defend
the other team better."
Equally threatening is the Huskies' defense, which has
limited opponents to a conference-best .084 hitting percent
age. Senior libero Candace Lee leads the charge with more
than four digs per game.
Before taking on the Huskies, the Cardinal must fend off
Washington State (8-8,1-2 Pac-10) Friday at 7 p.m. in Maples.
The Cougars are fresh off their first Pac-10 victory of the
year, which came against Arizona State last Saturday in Pull
man, Wash.
Junior middle blocker Jen Barcus highlights Washington
State's offense with a .315 hitting percentage. Overall, the
team is hitting .169 and averaging just under 17 digs per
game.
"Washington State is different this year," Dunning said.
"They have a lot of new players, and they are much better
than we thought. We need to give credit where credit is due,
and we are interested and excited to play with them."
The Cardinal counter with a .289 hitting percentage and
are led by freshman middle blocker Foluke Akinradewtt
(.415) and freshman outside hitter Cynthia Barboza (.327).
Senior libero Courtney Schultz and junior outside hitter
Kristin Richards have set the tempo for the Cardinal de
fense, each averaging more than three digs per game.
Dunning commented that many players have stepped up
throughout the season but that a win against the second
best team in the country would require a more balanced
team effort.
"Certain players have carried us on different days," Dun
ning said. "We played a lot of matches well, but...we need to
be on all cylinders. It's going to require that to beat a team
like Washington."

team effort.
"Certain players have carried us on different days," Dun
ning said. "We played a lot of matches well, but...we need to
be on all cylinders. It's going to require that to beat a team
like Washington."

The Cardinal face No. 2 Washington on Friday in a rematch of last season's NCAA Tournament semifinals. The Huskies are predict
ed to repeat as Pacific-10 Conference champions this season.

The No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team will meet a
number of challenges this season, but few can compare to
those the squad faces this weekend.
Before winning last season's national championship, the
Cardinal met then-top-ranked Washington in an unforget
table November match at Burnham Pavilion. After dropping
the first two games to the I luskies,the Cardinal mounted an
explosive comeback, eventually taking the final game into
overtime before a thunderous crowd. Stanford would go on
defeat to the Huskies again in the semifinals of the NCAA
Tournament.
Many consider the Washington contest to be the confi
dence boost that drove the Cardinal through the end of the
regular season and playoffs.
"It was definitely one of the best matches I've ever seen,"
head coach John Dunning said. "Confidence isn't something
you can create or wish for. but those kinds of close situations
really give you confidence."
The No. 2 Huskies (12-0,3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) ar
rive at Maples Pavilion this Saturday to battle Stanford (15-
1,4-0) at 7 p.m. And if this year's encounter between the top
Pac-10 teams is anything like last season's epic, then both the
Cardinal and the 1 luskies are in for one long Saturday night.
The defending Pac-10 champion Huskies enter Satur
day's contest as a favorite to win the conference as well as a
major contender for the national championship. One season
removed from its best season in school history, Washington
remains the only team in the nation that has yet to drop a
game in 2005.
Washington features an explosive offense responsible
for the nation's best hitting percentage (.423). At the helm is
sophomore middle blocker Alesha Deesing, who owns a
.540 percentage. Other major threats include sophomore
outside hitter Christal Morrison and senior middle blocker
Darla Myhre, with hitting percentages of .412 and .4 l X). re
spectively.
According to Dunning, stopping the Huskies' offense
should provide a formidable challenge.
"Like last year. Washington is very efficient and does not
make mistakes," he said. "For us, it's all about starting with
the fundamentals. If you serve and pass well, you can defend
the other team better."
Equally threatening is the Huskies' defense, which has
limited opponents to a conference-best .084 hitting percent
age. Senior libero Candace Lee leads the charge with more
than four digs per game.
Before taking on the Huskies, the Cardinal must fend off
Washington State (8-8,1-2 Pac-10) Friday at 7 p.m. in Maples.
The Cougars are fresh off their first Pac-10 victory of the
year, which came against Arizona State last Saturday in Pull
man, Wash.
Junior middle blocker Jen Barcus highlights Washington
State's offense with a .315 hitting percentage. Overall, the
team is hitting .169 and averaging just under 17 digs per
game.
"Washington State is different this year," Dunning said.
"They have a lot of new players, and they are much better
than we thought. We need to give credit where credit is due,
and we are interested and excited to play with them."
The Cardinal counter with a .289 hitting percentage and
are led by freshman middle blocker Foluke Akinradewtt
(.415) and freshman outside hitter Cynthia Barboza (.327).
Senior libero Courtney Schultz and junior outside hitter
Kristin Richards have set the tempo for the Cardinal de
fense, each averaging more than three digs per game.
Dunning commented that many players have stepped up
throughout the season but that a win against the second
best team in the country would require a more balanced
team effort.
"Certain players have carried us on different days," Dun
ning said. "We played a lot of matches well, but...we need to
be on all cylinders. It's going to require that to beat a team
like Washington."
