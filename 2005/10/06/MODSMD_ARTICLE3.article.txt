ing facility, in which professors can hold
lectures or discussions that can be
viewed at the main Stanford campus in

conferencing," Jamieson said. "With the
new system, we can share our speakers

have courses team-taught by two profes

planned for SIW will be similar to that

Jamieson declined to state how
much the entire project would cost, re-
