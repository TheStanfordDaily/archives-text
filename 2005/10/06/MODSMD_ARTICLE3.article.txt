## Stanford in Washington program to expand Changes include more classrooms, technology 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
Aside from sightseeing at the Lin
coln Memorial and the White House,
students spending the 2006-2007 school
year at Stanford's campus in Washing
ton, D.C., will benefit from major expan
sions to the Stanford in Washington pro
gram planned for the next 14 months.
As part of a movement to allow more
room for classes, Stanford in Washing
ton will be building additional class
rooms and library space for student and
teacher use.
"We have gotten to the point where
we are offering more night classes than
we have space for," said Adrienne
Jamieson, director of the SIW program,
in an interview with The Daily. "This will
allow us to expand our program even
more."
Another major overhaul intended
for the SIW campus is a distance-learn
ing facility, in which professors can hold
lectures or discussions that can be
viewed at the main Stanford campus in
California through information tech
nologies.
"Basically, it is a fancy version of tele
conferencing," Jamieson said. "With the
new system, we can share our speakers
with the West Coast. Students in Palo
Alto can ask questions of lecturers clear
across the country. This also allows us to
have courses team-taught by two profes
sors 3,000 miles away from each other."
The distance-learning facility
planned for SIW will be similar to that
in Stanford's overseas campus in Berlin.
Jamieson declined to state how
much the entire project would cost, re-
marking that the University Board
of Trustees is still discussing expens
es.
"I'm afraid that if 1 tried to guess,
by the time the project started, my
figures would be wrong." she said.
The SI W administrators intend to

begin construction later this fall,
completing approximately 14
months later. Jamieson said they are
hoping to have the new facilities
ready for the winter quarter of 2007.
Student alumni of the SIW pro
gram were intrigued by the possibili
ty of expansion but stressed that
their D.C. experience could hardly
be better.
"ITie expansion sounds really in
teresting." said senior Louis Vertiz,
who attended SI Win the fall of 2004.

"1 don't know if it could improve the
program that is already there."
Vertiz said he thought SIW stu
dents could appreciate the added
flexibility of having an extra building
and praised Jamieson for taking the
necessary steps to expand the pro
gram.
"Adrienne worked very hard to
get the neighborhood association to
go along with the plan," he said. "She
did an extraordinaray job in terms of
getting the deal through."
