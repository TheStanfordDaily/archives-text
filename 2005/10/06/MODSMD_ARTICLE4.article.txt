### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
met last night for the second time this quar
ter to handle regular funding requests, to
discuss upcoming celebrations and to lay
out plans for the new academic year.
Early in the meeting, second-year law
student and GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen ex
tended praise to University Provost John
Etchemendy for providing $40,000 fora
Thanksgiving dinner that the GSC is organ
izing.
"We're very grateful to the provost for
providing additional funding for this historic

4
event, which has been well attended by grad
students," Allen said.
The council is also planning an Oct. 28
Halloween party.
"The GSC looks forward to continuing
this Halloween tradition and giving the
graduate students one of the best parties of
all time," Allen said.
In light of the highly anticipated Hal
loween and Thanksgiving events, the GSC
handled the more serious matters of stu
dent group funding and discussed ambi
tious plans for the new school year.
The GSC approved funds for the student
group World Peace Buddhists, who are
sponsoring a "Victory Over Violence" cam
paign aimed at encouraging nonviolence in
all areas of humanity.
The GSC also granted funds to
Shaking the Foundations, an annual
conference held at Stanford Law
School, which is dedicated to "progres
sive lawyering," according to the
group's Web site.
Late in the meeting, the GSC dis
cussed possible Web site upgrades
with the new GSC Web master,
fourth-year electrical engineering
doctoral student Paul Gurney. They
hope the upgrades will allow them to
better reach out to the graduate stu

dent community.
"We plan to keep the Web site up to
date," Gurney said. "We also want to
offer a calendar so people can easily
find out what is happening in the grad
uate community."
Also in attendance were ASSU
Undergraduate Senate Chair Chris
Nguyen, a junior, and ASSU Presi
dent and Vice President, Melanie
Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo,
both seniors.
. Nguyen showed up to describe the
goals of this year's undergraduate
senate.
"When there's an issue that af
fects both the undergraduate and
graduate student populations we try
to form an advocacy committee,"

Nguyen said. "That way we can work
together to lobby the administration
on the issues."
Current issues that affect all Stan
ford students include changes to Old
Union and student housing, Nguyen
said.
Allen agreed with him on the im
portance of undergraduate and gradu
ate leadership working together this
year. She added that this partnership
will prove especially necessary with re
gard to by-laws and other changes as
needed.
"It is going to be increasingly im
portant for the two groups to work to
gether," Allen said. "And we look for
ward to working with the undergrads
more than we have in the past."
