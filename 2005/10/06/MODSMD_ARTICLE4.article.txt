Early in the meeting, second-year law

"We're very grateful to the provost for
providing additional funding for this historic

event, which has been well attended by grad
students," Allen said.
The council is also planning an Oct. 28
Halloween party.
"The GSC looks forward to continuing
this Halloween tradition and giving the
graduate students one of the best parties of
all time," Allen said.
In light of the highly anticipated Hal
loween and Thanksgiving events, the GSC

The GSC approved funds for the student
group World Peace Buddhists, who are
sponsoring a "Victory Over Violence" cam
