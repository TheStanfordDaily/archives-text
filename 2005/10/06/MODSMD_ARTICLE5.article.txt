# 'It is the granddaddy of school spirit'
## Students, administration look to increase football game attendance 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
With the Stanford football team opening
the year with a 1-2 record, attending football
games is no longer the number-one priority
for most students, a sentiment student leaders
and administrators hope will change by Big
Game Week.
Bob Carruesco, assistant athletic director

—Danny Arbeiter, on Big Game Week

and director of marketing, estimates that
about 1,500 students attended last weekend's
game against the I Jniversity of Oregon,
About 1,500 student All AXE-cess passes
have been sold so far, he said.
Carruesco notes that it is still early in the
year and more tickets will be purchased as Big
Game nears. When the match-up is held at Cal
he reports that about 2,500 student football
tickets are sold,and when the game is at home.

they'll sell between 3,000 to 3,500 tickets.
During New Student Orientation, the Ath
letic Department held "Cardinal Fan 101" in
the Stanford Stadium. About 1,000 students
attended the event — which included appear
ances by members of the football team, the
Dollies and the Band — to learn the impor
tance of supporting student athletics.

"It is very important to us to mobi
lize student interest in all Stanford
athletics," Carruesco said.
Students who purchased the All
AXE-cess pass also received free T
shirts from the Red Zone, the new stu
dent football fan section.
"The Red Zone is a great idea and
a lot of people are optimistic about
this season," said senior Chris Holt,
public relations manager for the
Band.
However, junior Katie Fogelsong,
head yell leader, said she sees room
for improvement.
"In comparison to previous years,
student attendance is always high dur

ing the beginning of the football sea
son," she said. "Few freshmen have
ever been to a Stanford game, so it's
new and exciting for them. But we've
got nothing on the good old days
when students could bring kegs into
the Stadium. Back then, filling the
stands was never a problem."
Holt reported that the Band has
been doing its part and notes this
year's exceptional recruiting class for
the Band and yell leaders.
"The Band is the embodiment of
student spirit," I lolt said. "We take it
upon ourselves to rock out as much as
we can. By increasing the number of
people who are crazy and passionate,
we will benefit every one."
In order to further address the
issue of student attendance and schtK)l
spirit, the Freshman Dean's Office
formed the Big Game Week Commit
tee in 2004. According to Krista Zizzo,

the director of outieach and assess
ment, the committee is a collection of
about 30 students representing vari
ous groups around campus with ties to
Big Game events, such as the Axe
Committee, Ram's Head Theatrical
Society and members of the ASSU.
"These groups already do a num
ber of things related to Big Game."
Zizzo said. "The goal was to get all
these groups around one table to talk
about what they do and to coordinate
their efforts."
Last year, the committee focused
on improving attendance at the Big
Game Bonfire. Through their efforts,
attendance jumped more than ten
fold, from about 100 to 1.300 people.
The committee met yesterday
evening to discuss plans for the week
long festivities. Their major concern is
ensuring that students will be on cam
pus and will attend the 108 th Big

Game, which falls the Saturday before
the week-long Thanksgiving Break.
Among the attendees were sopho
more Danny Arbeiter, Axe Commit
tee financial manager and ASSU Sen
ator, and junior Troy Steinmetz, a stu
dent staff member in the Freshman
Dean's Office. Both said they saw Big
Game as the cornerstone of school
spirit.
"There are a lot of football fans on
campus and a lot of people who could
be fans," Steinmetz said. "If we give
students the resources and tools to be
good fans, it will improve the culture
and make people want to go to
games."
The committee discussed a num
ber of themes and ideas to energize
students for Big Game during the pre
ceding week. Ideas included increas
ing the amount of red around campus,
not just in Stanford clothing, but also

possibly by dying fountains, temporar
ily painting structures around campus
and convincing people to dye their
hair red.
"We want people to wake up the
Monday morning of Big Game week
and see a physical transformation on
campus," Steinmetz said. "This way.
they'll know for sure that something is
different that week."
The committee looks forward to
the renovation of the Stanford Stadi
um next year which will make the
games more intimate and bring fans
closer to the playing field. They said
they are optimistic that their efforts
• will pay off in the end and increase
overall school spirit.
"Big Game stands on its own." Ar
beiter said. "It is the grand daddy of
school spirit. Even if we don't win
every game in the regular season and
win Big Game, we're still a winner."

With the Stanford football team opening
the year with a 1-2 record, attending football

Bob Carruesco, assistant athletic director

—Danny Arbeiter, on Big Game Week

and director of marketing, estimates that
about 1,500 students attended last weekend's
game against the I Jniversity of Oregon,
About 1,500 student All AXE-cess passes
have been sold so far, he said.
Carruesco notes that it is still early in the
year and more tickets will be purchased as Big
Game nears. When the match-up is held at Cal
he reports that about 2,500 student football
tickets are sold,and when the game is at home.

they'll sell between 3,000 to 3,500 tickets.
During New Student Orientation, the Ath
letic Department held "Cardinal Fan 101" in
the Stanford Stadium. About 1,000 students
attended the event — which included appear
ances by members of the football team, the
Dollies and the Band — to learn the impor
tance of supporting student athletics.

"It is very important to us to mobi
lize student interest in all Stanford
athletics," Carruesco said.
Students who purchased the All
AXE-cess pass also received free T
shirts from the Red Zone, the new stu
dent football fan section.
"The Red Zone is a great idea and
a lot of people are optimistic about
this season," said senior Chris Holt,
public relations manager for the
Band.
However, junior Katie Fogelsong,
head yell leader, said she sees room
for improvement.
"In comparison to previous years,
student attendance is always high dur

ing the beginning of the football sea
son," she said. "Few freshmen have
ever been to a Stanford game, so it's
new and exciting for them. But we've
got nothing on the good old days
when students could bring kegs into
the Stadium. Back then, filling the
stands was never a problem."
Holt reported that the Band has
been doing its part and notes this
year's exceptional recruiting class for
the Band and yell leaders.
"The Band is the embodiment of
student spirit," I lolt said. "We take it
upon ourselves to rock out as much as
we can. By increasing the number of
people who are crazy and passionate,
we will benefit every one."
In order to further address the
issue of student attendance and schtK)l
spirit, the Freshman Dean's Office
formed the Big Game Week Commit
tee in 2004. According to Krista Zizzo,

the director of outieach and assess
ment, the committee is a collection of
about 30 students representing vari
ous groups around campus with ties to
Big Game events, such as the Axe
Committee, Ram's Head Theatrical
Society and members of the ASSU.
"These groups already do a num
ber of things related to Big Game."
Zizzo said. "The goal was to get all
these groups around one table to talk
about what they do and to coordinate
their efforts."
Last year, the committee focused
on improving attendance at the Big
Game Bonfire. Through their efforts,
attendance jumped more than ten
fold, from about 100 to 1.300 people.
The committee met yesterday
evening to discuss plans for the week
long festivities. Their major concern is
ensuring that students will be on cam
pus and will attend the 108 th Big

Game, which falls the Saturday before
the week-long Thanksgiving Break.
Among the attendees were sopho
more Danny Arbeiter, Axe Commit
tee financial manager and ASSU Sen
ator, and junior Troy Steinmetz, a stu
dent staff member in the Freshman
Dean's Office. Both said they saw Big
Game as the cornerstone of school
spirit.
"There are a lot of football fans on
campus and a lot of people who could
be fans," Steinmetz said. "If we give
students the resources and tools to be
good fans, it will improve the culture
and make people want to go to
games."
The committee discussed a num
ber of themes and ideas to energize
students for Big Game during the pre
ceding week. Ideas included increas
ing the amount of red around campus,
not just in Stanford clothing, but also

possibly by dying fountains, temporar
ily painting structures around campus
and convincing people to dye their
hair red.
"We want people to wake up the
Monday morning of Big Game week
and see a physical transformation on
campus," Steinmetz said. "This way.
they'll know for sure that something is
different that week."
