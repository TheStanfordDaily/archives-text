## Stanford trio nabs NIH honors Researchers from School of Medicine among 13 winners 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On the heels of an ex-professor win
ning a Nobel Prize and a researcher
nabbing a "genius grant," Stanford con
tinued its academic prowess, boasting
more National Institutes of Health
Award winners than any other universi
ty this year. Of the 13 Pioneer Awards
that were distributed, three went to
Stanford researchers.
Shortly after the awards were an
nounced on Sept. 29, Philip Pizzo, dean
of the School of Medicine, told the Busi
ness News, "Having three pioneer
award winners is simply remarkable."
The three award winners were
Thomas Rando, assistant professor of
neurology and neurological science;
Pehr Harbury, assistant professor of
biochemistry; and Karl Deisseroth, as
sistant professor of bioenginnering,psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences.
The award seeks out researchers
who take on major challenges that have
a high probability of failure, but if suc
cessful, could cause a sea change in their
fields.
Though begun as recently as 2004,
Pizzo calls the Pioneer Awards "one of
the most prestigious and important
recognitions by the NIH."
Rando, Harbury and Deisseroth
commented extensively on their re
search in a Sept. 29 article in Business
News.
Rando called the reward "both an
honor and a challenge," adding that he
plans to use the money to help research
ways to enhance the potential of stem
cells to repair damaged tissue in the eld
erly.
If fruitful, Rando could help those
who suffer from degenerative diseases
like muscular dystrophy.
In addition to the Pioneer Award,
Harbury also received a 2005
Mac Arthur Fellowship, sometimes
nicknamed the "genius" award. His re
search plan is to use DNA molecules as
blueprints to help synthesize small
chemical compounds, which would be
extremely useful in drug design.
"We're trying to put the magic in the
magic bullet of drug design." Harbury
said.
His approach to designing drugs
would be much quicker and cheaper
than the techniques that are currently
used, he said.
Deisseroth's research deals closely
with the electric circuitry of the brain.
He will be examining those mental ill
nesses which are the result of circuit
glitches rather than chemical imbal
ances.
