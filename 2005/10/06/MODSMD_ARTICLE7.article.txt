## CEO addresses audience while employees protest 
### ROHAN KHARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ongoing labor negotiations between Stanford Hospital
and its employees continued yesterday as Hospital Chief Ex
ecutive Officer Martha Marsh addressed an audience of stu
dents and employees at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal about the future of the hospital's workers. Students rallied
outside during the speech, arguing that the University needs to
treat workers fairly as it lays out plans for the future.
The rally was reminiscent of similar events weeks ago, when
University and Hospital workers marched from Sand Hill
Field to the main entrance of the Stanford Hospital on Sept. 5
