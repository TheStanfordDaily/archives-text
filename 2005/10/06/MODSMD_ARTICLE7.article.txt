## CEO addresses audience while employees protest 
### ROHAN KHARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ongoing labor negotiations between Stanford Hospital
and its employees continued yesterday as Hospital Chief Ex
ecutive Officer Martha Marsh addressed an audience of stu
dents and employees at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal about the future of the hospital's workers. Students rallied
outside during the speech, arguing that the University needs to
treat workers fairly as it lays out plans for the future.
The rally was reminiscent of similar events weeks ago, when
University and Hospital workers marched from Sand Hill
Field to the main entrance of the Stanford Hospital on Sept. 5
to protest the Hospital's treatment
of employees.
Representatives from the Hospi
tal could not comment extensively
on the details of the process by press
time.
"We are in the middle of the ne
gotiation," said Andrea Smith, media
relations manager for Stanford Hos
pital and Clinics. "We value the con
tribution of the employees and we
hope fora positive outcome."
Other officials at Stanford Hospi

tal declined to comment.
Students said they hoped that the
rally would cause University officials
to take notice.
According to sophomore Matt
Seriff-Cullick, a member of the Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC), many people attended the
rally and numerous flyers were dis
tributed but no official reply has
been received from the administra
tion.
"The union will continue to co
ordinate to get the message to the
decision-making people and the ad
ministrative officials," he said. "We
will demonstrate the unity of Stan
ford University workers and the sol
idarity of the community of work

ers."
Hospital employees have listed
their demands: "better health care,
retiree health benefits and a better
retirement."
Protesters say that Hospital prof
its have increased, but the workers
are not being treated fairly because
no proper investments are being
made to improve the facilities pro
vided to the employees.
"We are serious about organizing
goals that the workers are fighting
for and the whole student body is be
hind the worker community." Seriff-
Cullick said. "We support the Stan
ford workers and we will give our
100 percent until the workers get a
fair contract."
