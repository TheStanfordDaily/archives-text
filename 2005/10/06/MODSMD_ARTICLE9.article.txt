## WORLD Hurricane Stan's death toll tops 135

SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador
(AP) — Heavy rains pounded Cen
tral America fora fourth day yes
terday, pushing rivers over their
banks, flooding communities and
unleashing at least two deadly mud
slides as the region's death toll sur
passed 135.
Hurricane Stan, which had
helped spawn rainstorms in Central
America, weakened to a depression
over the southern state of Oaxaca
on Wednesday, a day after making
landfall along Mexico's Gulf coast.
But punishing rains continued in
parts of Central America and
southern Mexico.
In Guatemala, a mudslide near
the internationally popular tourist
destination of Lake Atitlan, about 60
miles west of the capital. Guatemala
City, buried several houses. It was not
clear how many people were caught
in the earth and debris, said Carlos
Santizo, chief of the Solola volunteer
fire department.
An AP photographer on site
said he saw at least 12 bodies recov
ered, bringing the death toll in
Guatemala alone to at least 50, and
the total number of confirmed vic
tims to more than 120 throughout
the region.
Flooding in scores of
Guatemalan communities forced the

evacuation of more than 6,000 resi
dents. Nearly all of the country's
rivers overflowed, while landslides
and fallen trees blocked at least 30
roadways. Most of the victims were
killed in landslides, national disaster
agency officials said.
Guatemalan President Oscar
Berger called on Congress to de
clare a national state of emergency,
allowing the government to force
evacuations of dangerous areas, set
prices on emergency supplies and
provide federal coordination of re
lief efforts.
"But we're only going to do all of
this if it is absolutely necessary,"
Berger said.

In El Salvador, President Tony
Saca said late Wednesday night that
62 people had been killed, mostly
by landslides following days of non
stop rain throughout the country.
Nearly 41,000 others fled their
homes for 360 shelters set up na
tionwide.
Among those evacuated were
residents of Santa Tecla, outside
the capital. San Salvador, where a
strong earthquake caused a mas
sive landslide in January 2001.
Officials have worried the moun
tain running alongside the neigh
borhood might collapse again
with heavy rains or another
quake.

Nine people died in storm-re
lated storms in Nicaragua, includ
ing six migrants believed to be
Ecuadoreans killed in a boat
wreck. Four deaths were reported
in Honduras and one in Costa
Rica.
In the Chiapas city of Tapachula,
near Mexico's border with
Guatemala, three people were
killed when an overflowing river
roared through the city, also carry
ing homes of wood and metal, civil
protection officials said Wednes
day.
Three other Chiapas residents
were confirmed dead, as flooding
forced hundreds of evacuations.
