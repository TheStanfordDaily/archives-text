You've probably seen the ad for the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo — and
if youre any sort of man, you've no doubt purchased one. In case
youmlssed it, here's the rundown: a jet plane screams by; a
beJutiful woman strokes a,man's smooth-shaven face. It cuts back
and forth*several t Knesset plane! Woman! Je+ ptane! Woman! In
terms of pathos, it's right there with Antigone. So my hands were
all aquiver as I cracked mine open, lathered up and began to
shave. Oh, I could hardly feel it as it glided across my skin,
II snaglessly slicing follicles. Armed with gleaming cheeks, I ventured
out into the campus. When my outthrust chin failed to attract
I attention, I started throwing out hints. "Hey," I said to a brunette
| hanging outside Tressider, "My face is quite smooth, wouldn't you
E say?" v Yeah, I guess," she said. "Like a baby's bottom," I added,
i Still, she didn't get naked. In fact she had to run off just then, to
t wash her hair, she said.
Other conversations went much the same way.
I'm starting to wonder if I'm using this thing wrong. I never did
see the jet plane. I guess it's sold separately or something.

Who doesn't love that special feeling you when you
can't for the life of you find the magazine article you
want to read, but instead spend an hour looking at
ads for printer cartridges and clothing you can't
buy? Or when the person next to you on the bus says
into their cell phone, "Can you hear me now?" Ad
vertisements really only add joy to our lives here at
Intermission, and this issue celebrates our love.
