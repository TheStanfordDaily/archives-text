Many ads tell you lies... dirty, dirty lies - like chat
Blockbuster one which claims there are no more
late fees when really the video ohaln Is just playing
dictionary and re-terming the charges to be
"service fees" or "purchases." But then, there are
the ads with claims that are harder to invalidate.
You know, the vague ones, that offer a lot of
potential but little In the way of concrete
assertions. Take Geiko, for example: "Fifteen
minutes could save you 15 percent or more on car
Insurance." Yeah, it could. Potentially. But what is
this worth to the everyman. who doesn't have time
to live in a world of maybes? Not much. Now. I
have to admit that when I myself called Oeiko. I
was quoted a rate some SO percent lower than the
competition. But what If that was a fluke? Or,
worse, what if I'm the ONLY person who the
â€¢'could" even applies to? Meaning, everyone else
who calls Is destined to get the shaft and doesn't
save 15 percent or more? Man, that would suck.
Maybe Oelko should stick with Its "I just saved a
lot of money on my oar Insurance" campaign. At
least those ads are funny... except when they make
light of the untimely death of spawning salmon.
