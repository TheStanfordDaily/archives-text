## STUDENT LIFE Darfur fast raises funds to fight genocide 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hundreds of students gathered at Tresidder Union
last night fora Break-the-Fast Dinner that marked
the end of a day dedicated to protesting the genocide
in Darfur, and supporting the survivors.
Yesterday, people from around the world joined
together to support the people of Darfur by fasting or
forfeiting a luxury item, in an effort to raise awareness
about the genocide.
In all, close to 1,100 Stanford students — more
than one-sixth of the undergraduate student body —
participated in the fast, and the event raised over
$13,000.
The money raised by students who participated
in the fast will be donated to humanitarian relief
work in Darfur. In addition, the Peninsula Commu
nity Foundation, a charitable organization in the
greater San Francisco area, agreed to donate an ad
ditional $5 to relief efforts in Darfur for every stu
dent who fasted.
The highlight of the dinner was a speech delivered
by Justin Arana, an international medical organiza
tion volunteer who was imprisoned by the Sudanese
government for crimes against the state after an offi
cial discovered a camera in his backpack and accused
him of taking pictures.
After explaining to the audience the history be
hind the conflict in Sudan, Arana spoke about the
atrocities he witnessed during his own experience in
the war-torn country.
"When they raid a village, the government sol
diers kill every man and throw their bodies in wells
to contaminate the water sources," Arana said.
"Then they rape all the women, and they beat all the
children. The survivors are left in the desert with no
water and no food. When they do reach places where
they can get help, they are on the fringes of death,
and the levels of malnourishment and dehydration
are truly unbelievable."
Toward the end of his speech, Arana explained the
attitude of the oppressed people in Darfur and issued
a call to action.
"The people of Darfur survive on hope; every
white person they see is their symbol of freedom,"
Arana said. "Thousands of people's
lives depend on us doing more than
just shedding a tear: we need a revo
lution of compassion to save Darfur.
Every emotion we have about this
issue, every tear we shed, all the
anger means nothing if we don't put
some action behind our feelings. It is
a sin against humanity if we don't do
anything."
The event's organizers were very
excited after the event, calling the
whole day an overwhelming success.
Senior Ben Elberger, who heads
up the group Students Taking Action
Now: Darfur (STAND) and who or
ganized the fast and the dinner, said
that the event wildly exceeded his
expectations.
"Both the fast and the dinner
were tremendously successful; we
had more people than we ever ex
pected could have happened," El
berger said. "1 think everyone was
really inspired by Justin, and it was
clear that people enjoyed the com
munal aspect of the fast."
Another organizer, Cassidy De
line, a sophomore and a staff writer
for The Daily, agreed with Elberger.
"We've been trying to mobilize
the campus fora long time," Deline
said. "1 think today proved that
we've really gotten through to peo
ple on campus. We definitely didn't
expect to raise this much money.This
is a good precedent to set for the rest
of the year."
The dinner was a joint breaking
of-the-fast hosted with Stanford's
Muslim Student Awareness Net

work (MSAN), which gave a brief
presentation on the Muslim holy
month of Ramadan before Arana's
speech.
After the event, several members
of MSAN were upset with some of
the content of Arana's speech.
MSAN President Omar Shakir. a
junior, said that while he loved the
event, he was troubled by a few of
Arana's comments.
"We felt the speaker said a few
things that were both untrue and un
necessary when talking about the
subject," Shakir said. "For the most
part, we were very happy with the
way the event turned out, but some
of the things the speaker said made
some members of our audience a lit
tle uncomfortable. A lot of the rhet
oric used tonight and used in gener
al makes it seem as if the conflict in
Darfur is the Africans versus the
Muslims. But many of the victims of
the genocide are Muslims — and, re
ally, the situation in Darfur is two
groups with the same skin color
fighting against each other."
STAND leader Nikki Serapio, a
junior, clarified Arana's position in
response to several students' reac
tions to his speech.
"We appreciated MSAN and
ISSU's support of this event and our
success would not have been possible
without them," Serapio said. "Justin
Arana did state in his talk that Sudan
lies at the border of the Islamic and
African worlds, a factual reality. The
genocide in Sudan, however, is largely
being perpetrated by Arab Muslims
in northern Sudan against African
Muslims in Darfur. Justin stated that
the conflict is not one between Mus
lims and Africans numerous times,
but we apologize for any misunder
standing that may have resulted."
