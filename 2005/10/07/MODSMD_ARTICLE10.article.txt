## STUDENT LIFE Darfur fast raises funds to fight genocide 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hundreds of students gathered at Tresidder Union
last night fora Break-the-Fast Dinner that marked
the end of a day dedicated to protesting the genocide
in Darfur, and supporting the survivors.
Yesterday, people from around the world joined
together to support the people of Darfur by fasting or
forfeiting a luxury item, in an effort to raise awareness
about the genocide.
In all, close to 1,100 Stanford students — more
than one-sixth of the undergraduate student body —
participated in the fast, and the event raised over
$13,000.
The money raised by students who participated
in the fast will be donated to humanitarian relief
work in Darfur. In addition, the Peninsula Commu
nity Foundation, a charitable organization in the
greater San Francisco area, agreed to donate an ad
ditional $5 to relief efforts in Darfur for every stu
dent who fasted.
The highlight of the dinner was a speech delivered
by Justin Arana, an international medical organiza
tion volunteer who was imprisoned by the Sudanese
government for crimes against the state after an offi
cial discovered a camera in his backpack and accused
him of taking pictures.
After explaining to the audience the history be
hind the conflict in Sudan, Arana spoke about the
atrocities he witnessed during his own experience in
the war-torn country.
"When they raid a village, the government sol
diers kill every man and throw their bodies in wells
to contaminate the water sources," Arana said.
"Then they rape all the women, and they beat all the
children. The survivors are left in the desert with no
water and no food. When they do reach places where
they can get help, they are on the fringes of death,
and the levels of malnourishment and dehydration
are truly unbelievable."
Toward the end of his speech, Arana explained the
attitude of the oppressed people in Darfur and issued
a call to action.
"The people of Darfur survive on hope; every
white person they see is their symbol of freedom,"
