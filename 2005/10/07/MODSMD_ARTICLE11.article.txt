## 9/11 memorial honors victims of attacks 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WRITER 
In the midst of the chaos of White Plaza
at lunchtime, a moment of peace emerged
yesterday. Members of the Stanford com
munity met to remember the victims of the
Sept. 11.2001 terrorist attacks.
The event,"In Memory of the Fallen,"
was organized by sophomore Michele Go
labek Goldman and sponsored by the Of
fice for Religious Life. Featuring key
speakers, musical performances by Talis
man a cappella and sophomore violinist
Henry Liao and an emotional candle
lighting ceremony, the event culminated
with the ringing of the Clock Tower in
honor of those affected by the tragedy
Reverend Joanne Sanders, associate
dean of religious life, opened the obser
vance with a heartfelt invocation. She ad
vised the audience to look for"the sense of
holiness" in its midst and to strive to attain
wisdom, candor and hope.
Goldman spoke next, declaring,
"Today we defiantly tell the terrorists that
human life has value." In an interview with
The Daily before the event, Goldman ex
pressed her hopes for the memorial.
"1 hope that even if it is just fora few
moments, students will take the time to
think about the innocent individuals who
perished," she said. "Many just happened
to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time. It is so important to keep their
memories alive."
The crowd of students and faculty had
grown to 50 members by the time Marie
Mitchell, the sister of a Sept. 11 victim,
spoke. She told of the life of her brother,
Lt. Paul Mitchell of the New York City Fire
Department, and of the community that
has risen from the ashes of the World
Trade Center.
"On Sept. 11,3,000 people did not die;
one person died 3,000 times," she said, par
aphrasing the words of a rabbi who had
spoken to the relatives of victims.
Mitchell has returned to the site of the
World for each anniversary
of the attack and said that though "the
healing journey for all of us continues to
unfold," she has noticed a change in the be
havior of the relatives at the ceremony.
This past Sept. 11, smiles were more fre
quent and humor more freely expressed
than in previous years. However, she said.

"the damage done is irreparable. My
mother's son is dead."
The attacks forced people across the
globe to question the meaning of life in
light of such horror. Mitchell urged stu
dents to ask themselves, "What is my life
about?" and told them to "dare to be com
passionate. Dare to be wise."
The former chief of the San Francisco
Fire Department, Eric Casper, paid hom
age to the heroism inherent in the profes
sion. The 343 firefighters who died in New
York City on Sept. 11 "were just doing
what firefighters do nationwide," he said.
His speech highlighted the life of Chris
tian Regenhard, a 28-year-old firefighter
who lost his life in the towers' collapse and
the Skyscraper Safety Campaign. Created
in Regenhard's memory, the Skyscraper
Safety Campaign seeks to ensure compli
ance with building and fire codes in order
to prevent future building collapses.
Casper also stressed the importance of
ceremonies like the one held yesterday.
"On every Sept. 11, let's keep their
memories in our hearts, minds and
prayers," he said.
Audience members were asked to
stand in a circle while candles were lit for
each of the twin towers, the Pentagon,
Pittsburgh, the firefighters, the police
forces, the ill-fated airline flights and all
the men and women affected by the at
tacks. A moment of silence was held dur
ing which the bells of the clock tower
chimed in remembrance.
Junior Nathania Reid witnessed the
memorial.
"It was very well put together," she
said. "It was a nice ceremony. 1 think that
bringing community members who have
been directly impacted [by Sept. 11] to
speak made it very effective."
The memorial, held almost one month
after Sept. 11 due to Stanford's quarter
system schedule, benefited the speakers as
much as the audience.
"We as Stanford students go on living
our lives, and many of us can forget the
events of 9/11, but for the family members
and friends of those who perished, they
feel their losses on a daily basis," Goldman
said. "When I contacted family members
to tell them about the ceremony and see if
they wanted to participate â€” they were
just so grateful that people wanted to take
the time to remember."
