### WELLS WULSIN STAFF WRITER 
Rocky, a 14-year-old who broke
the world record in bareback high
jumping, will be on display tomorrow
with his stable-mates at the 16th an
nual Red Barn Festival. The show
case will feature a variety of equestri
an demonstrations and prize-winning
horses from the region, as well as the
facility's newly renovated buildings
and grounds.
Senior Alex Herbert is president
of the Stanford Equestrian Team and
sits on the organizing committee for
the event.
"This festival will be a great op
portunity for anyone without a lot of
exposure to horses to see a wide vari
ety of disciplines of riding," she said.
"To see all these professional horse
men demonstrate the highest level of
their discipline in such a remarkable
facility is really a rare opportunity."

According to a press release on
the Department of Athletics' Web
site, the theme of this year's festival is
"The Legacy Continues," in recogni
tion of University and donor-led ef
forts to refurbish and update the fa
cility. The festival will mark the first
time the Stanford Equestrian Center
opens its doors to the public since its
year-long, $4 million renovation was
completed last Saturday.
TTie historic Red Barn, which pre
dates the incorporation of the Uni
versity in 1891, was fitted with thera
peutic stall mats and a new ventila
tion system. In addition, the student
barn received identical mats, custom
hardwood stalls, yoked windows and
automatic water troughs.
"The facility has gotten a tremen
dous facelift and the caliber of the
Barn is completely different." Her
bert said.
