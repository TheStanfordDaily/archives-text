# Renovated Red Barn opens, hosts festival
## 
### WELLS WULSIN STAFF WRITER 
Rocky, a 14-year-old who broke
the world record in bareback high
jumping, will be on display tomorrow
with his stable-mates at the 16th an
nual Red Barn Festival. The show
case will feature a variety of equestri
an demonstrations and prize-winning
horses from the region, as well as the
facility's newly renovated buildings
and grounds.
Senior Alex Herbert is president
of the Stanford Equestrian Team and
sits on the organizing committee for
the event.
"This festival will be a great op
portunity for anyone without a lot of
exposure to horses to see a wide vari
ety of disciplines of riding," she said.
"To see all these professional horse
men demonstrate the highest level of
their discipline in such a remarkable
facility is really a rare opportunity."

According to a press release on
the Department of Athletics' Web
site, the theme of this year's festival is
"The Legacy Continues," in recogni
tion of University and donor-led ef
forts to refurbish and update the fa
cility. The festival will mark the first
time the Stanford Equestrian Center
opens its doors to the public since its
year-long, $4 million renovation was
completed last Saturday.
TTie historic Red Barn, which pre
dates the incorporation of the Uni
versity in 1891, was fitted with thera
peutic stall mats and a new ventila
tion system. In addition, the student
barn received identical mats, custom
hardwood stalls, yoked windows and
automatic water troughs.
"The facility has gotten a tremen
dous facelift and the caliber of the
Barn is completely different." Her
bert said.
The festival's daytime events in
clude performances by the Los Altos
Hounds, a local fox-hunting team,
and the Woodside Vaulters, a group
that performs acrobatic stunts on
trotting horses. A children's area will
feature pony rides, a petting zoo and
face-painting.
Additionally, various horses will
be on display, including some that
trace their lineage directly to Elec
tioneer, Leland Stanford Sr.'s cham
pion racer that sired nine of the 13
world champions produced on the
Palo Alto Stock Farm.
The evening program will feature
the Stanford Farm Day Invitational, a
team show-jumping competition that
will include some of the Peninsula's
top professional and amateur riders.
This is the first Red Barn Festival
for which the barn is under manage
ment by the University.The Barn was
previously leased to a private firm for
20 years, but the University declined
to renew the lease when it expired
last August. Instead, the Athletics
Department has assumed manage
ment of the Barn, and surrounding
facilities.
The makeover of the Barn comes
at a time of significant growth for the
Stanford Equestrian Team. This
year's team of 50 members — up
from 36 last year — is the largest
since the team was founded in 1984.
Vanessa Bartsch, Class of 1999, is
coach of the Stanford Equestrian
Team and general manager of the
Red Barn. She said she feels the
change in barn management and im

proved facilities will shift its focus to
ward the Stanford community.
"The idea was to put the students
first," Bartsch said. "We still cater to
faculty, staff and the community, but
now students are becoming much
more involved."
Herbert agreed that the change in
management will benefit student rid
ers.
"It's a wonderful transition for the

team," she said. ''Under the manage
ment of the Athletics Department, the
team receives priority for lesson times,
more stalls and horses and board rates
that are dramatically decreased."
Proceeds from the Red Barn Fes
tival will benefit Stanford Equestrian
Center programs offered for athletes,
students in physical education classes
and local community members.
In past years the festival has raised

between $20,000 and $30,000.
Bartsch hopes that by holding the
festival during the fall when more
students are on campus, attendance
will be greater than in previous years.
"We're hoping to have a lot of stu
dents this year," Bartsch said. "This is
truly the heritage of the University.
Without the Palo Alto Stock Farm,
we would never have had Stanford
University."
