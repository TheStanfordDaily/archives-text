### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Daniel Pearl, a slain Wall Street Journal re
porter and Stanford alumnus, was remembered
last night in a memorial service entitled "The An
nual Daniel Pearl Music Day" held at Memorial
Church.
The memorial was the fourth Daniel Pearl
Music Day that has taken place at Stanford since
the journalist was kidnapped and murdered in
Pakistan in 2002. The concert was a tribute to the
life and mission of Daniel Pearl, whose birthday
falls on Oct. 10.
The memorial concert is part of a worldwide
Music Day representing a united stand for toler
ance, humanity and friendship.
Pearl,an avid violinist,fiddler and mandolinist,
found himself playing with musicians from across
the world during his travels for the Wall Street
Journal.
"Danny was always playing music — today, all
around the world, performances are being given
for Daniel Pearl Music Day," said Michelle Pearl,
a relative of Daniel Pearl, at the service.
In every town he lived. Pearl joined a band, or
chestra or chamber group and formed new con
nections through his passion for music and friend
ship. He leaves behind a long list of musician
friends stretching from Los Angeles to Hong
Kong, and many other locations in Europe, Asia
and the United States.
Pearl, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1985
with a bachelor's degree in communications, was
kidnapped Jan. 23, 2002 in Karachi, Pakistan,
while researching a story on Islamic militants for
the Wall Street Journal.
On Jan. 25, The National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty sent an e
mail to several news organizations claiming that
the group had captured Pearl because he was a
CIA officer posing as a journalist. The e-mail
made several demands for Pearl's release, includ
ing the return of Pakistani prisoners being held by
the United States in Guantanamo Bay. Cuba.
An e-mail dated Jan. 30 was the last known
message from his captors. It reiterated the de
mands and threatened to kill Pearl in 24 hours if
the demands were not met. The U.S. State De
partment later announced that it had received
videotaped evidence showing that Pearl had
been stabbed and decapitated, on or around Jan.
