October is the perfect month to get outdoors.
The rainy season has yet to start and finals are still
to come. Fortunately, the surrounding area is filled
with campgrounds and parks for those looking to
escape campus and enjoy a breath of fresh air.
"fin October], the weather is still nice, the
tourist crowds are gone, the fall foliage is the most
beautiful there is and people aren't too stressed
out with school yet," says Diederik Marius, a doc
toral student in electrical engineering and former
president of the Redwood Outdoor Club — a stu
dent-run group that plans monthly wilderness ex
cursions.
For students looking to meet fellow adventur
ers or hesitant about planning their own outdoor
journeys, there are a number of clubs on campus
that organize day and weekend trips. Below are a
few of the organizations eager to get students out
side this month.
Redwood Outdoors Club
The Redwood Outdoors Club plans backpack
ing and climbing trips during the school year that
range both in difficulty and in length.The club also
encourages students to plan their own trips and
rents out backpacking and climbing gear.
Redwood trips are open to the entire student
body and there are four to choose from this
month.This weekend, the club is hiking to Mission
Peak, a nearby summit to the southeast with great
views of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Bay
Area. Next up is an Oct. 15 weekend trip to
Yosemite National Park, famous for its waterfalls.
From Oct. 22 to 23, the Redwood Outdoors Club
plans to venture to Desolation, a federal nature
area located West of Lake Tahoe. The final outing
of the month is a beginners' backpacking trip to
Point Reyes National Seashore, about an hour's
drive north of San Francisco. The trip will take
place Oct. 29 to 30.
Anyone in need of a loaner backpack or sleep
ing bag should send an e-mail to redwood
gear@lists.stanford.edu. The Club rents out gear
every Wednesday night from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. For
more information,e-mail group president, Mater
ials Science and Engineering graduate student Al
bert Chan, at alby@stanford.edu.
Stanford Outing Club
The Outing Club offers trips and activities for
crunchy backcountry-types as well as for the more
pampered folk who prefer clean sheets to damp
sleeping bags and pestering niosquitos.The club is
run mostly by Stanford graduate students and by
young professionals
in the surrounding areas. Thus, participating in the
Outing Club's activities can be a great way to ex
pand your social circle.
The club's most common activities are day
hikes, but it also plans a number of canoeing, back
packing and cycling trips. It also offers a number of
getaway options every weekend, so it is easy to
find something to suit every type of outdoorsy
palate.
This month's outings include, among others, a

weekend trip to Silver Lake, located in central
California's Eastern Sierras (Oct. 8 to 9); a week
end trip to the Sespe Wilderness and hot springs,
located about 30 miles northeast of Santa Bar
bara, Calif. (Oct. 14 to 16); a day trip to Angel Is
land (Oct. 8); and a day hike along the North
Shore of San Francisco from Fort Mason to the
Golden Gate Bridge (Oct. 15).
"[This walk in San Francisco] is arguably one of
the most beautiful urban hikes in the United
States, if not the world," says the Club's Web site.
"Spectacular views of San Francisco Bay, the
Marin Headlands, the city of San Francisco, the
Golden Gate Bridge or the Pacific Ocean are most
evident at every turn."
There are also two ice skating evenings to sat
isfy your inner Kristi Yamaguchi (Oct. 8 and 12 at
the Winter Lodge Ice Rink, 3009 Middlefield Rd.,
Palo Alto).
"I thought I would start throwing in something
cold for those who are from the East Coast and
start missing the change of season by now," says
Ken Chang, the trip's organizer. Chang is not en
rolled at Stanford.

Alpine Club
Although The Stanford Alpine Club admits to
being "dormant" during the 1980s and 19905, it has
regained its role since 2002 as a haven for Stanford
climbers.
Besides encouraging members of the Stanford
Community to make full use of the on-campus
climbing wall (which will be located in the new Ar
rillaga Family Sports Center starting in late Octo
ber), the Alpine Club also plans climbing trips and
lessons.
To gain club membership, people must
"demonstrate competence with basic safety skills
(belaying and rappelling)," according to the
group's Web site. The Alpine Club offers various
instructional trips to teach skills to people who are
interested in joining. Members must also pay $60
in dues per year, which funds new gear, first aid
training for instructors, and more.
There will be two ventures to Yosemite this month
— a day trip on Oct. 9 and a two-day trip from Oct.
22 to 23. Some of the club's members also plan to
go climbing at Handley Rock, a 35-foot sandstone
rock located in northwest Redwood City, on Oct.
12,19 and 26 from 5 p.m. to nightfall.
Additionally, there will be three climbing class
es for beginners at Castle Rock, located in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, on Saturday, Oct. 23 and
Saturday or Sunday, Oct. 29 or 30 (plans still pend
ing).

With a large number of outdoor clubs and a
plethora of places to explore, there is no excuse for
staying indoors. So break out those backpacks,
take advantage of the warm weather and enjoy the
Golden State.
