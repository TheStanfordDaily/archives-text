# Raves revisited: Birth of a new culture?
## 
### MAX ROUNDS 
Cultural time capsules from the 1990s
— such as "Dawson's Creek" depict rave
scenes thick with dangerous drugs,sensuous
fun and sensory overload. While these de
bauchery-filled mob scenes still abound, a
new branch of more accessible, music-fo
cused raves seems to be on the rise.
This September. San Francisco hosted
Loveparade — an enormous rave that was
held outdoors rather than inside an obscure,
smoke-veiled club.
Loveparade San Francisco is actually an
extension of the original 1989 Loveparade
in Berlin, Germany This event was the
brainchild of a German DJ who wanted to
bring together musicians in order to pro
mote "tolerance, respect and understanding
between nations," according to Lovepa
rade's Website.
While the German version of the event
has been cancelled for the past two years,
Loveparade has spread to a variety of loca
tions, including Tel Aviv, Santiago and Mex
ico City.
Sophomore Gregg Goldgof says he re
cently went to a rave at the Fabric club in
London, a venue he describes as "very
posh...and famous," adding that while there
were nearly 1.000 people in the building, it
was completely under control.
"In London they have an institutional
ized rave scene," he explains.
And Junior Christina Ward, who co

taught a class in FroSoCo last year about
modern dance and culture, says that the
rave scene has become more organized than
it has been in years.
"You can pick up a flier instead of only
being able to hear it word-of-mouth," she
says."It is less of a subculture than it used to
be."
Finally, although drugs — specifically ec
stasy — are sometimes stereotyped as in
trinsically connected to the underground
party culture, a Sept. 23 article in the San
Jose Mercury News titled "Wild Raves Go
Mainstream" reported that drugs have be
come less and less central to the rave scene.
"...raves synonymous with drugs died
two years ago." Ross Ivika, a dance concert

promoter, told The Mercury.
Ward, however, disagrees, asserting that
both types of raves abound.
"It's not the majority of people that are
doing ecstasy...and there are lots of drug
free raves...but there is still a strong nega
tive stereotype about the levels of drug
usage."
Goldgof would agree, recalling drugs
being present at Fabric.
"There were people outside selling pills
which I think were probably ecstasy," he re
marks. "There were some [dealers] inside,
too [and] alcohol was everywhere."
Oftentimes, authorities hesitate to allow
planned raves in their cities due to the po
tential for illegal substance abuse, according

to the article in the Mercury.
"San Jose, which was a hot spot for such
gatherings, used to bring tens of thousands
of devotees to the Santa Clara fairgrounds
to hear dance music from around the
world," the article reports. "But increased
attention to the scene — which was often
associated with the drug 'ecstasy,' or 'E' —
made local officials wary and sent the par
ties packing to Fresno in 2000. Since then,
the scene primarily has been in San Francis
co and Oakland."
San Francisco, indeed. Loveparade San
Francisco hosted around 50,000 partygoers
this year, according to an article published
on Sept. 25 in the San Francisco Chronicle.
While Stanford is a far cry from the city
— and Goldgof says he knows few people
on the Farm who are interested in raves —
this type of event can be a refreshing
change from the weekend frat parties on
campus that can grow monotonous come
winter quarter.
Sophomore Riaz Rahim says that the
raves near his Los Angeles high school
"were a lot more social and a lot less physi
cal" than frat parties.
So if you want a new way to de-stress this
October, why not gather your friends and
head up north for some crazy (but drug
free, of course) escapades?

Oftentimes, authorities hesitate to allow
planned raves in their cities due to the po
tential for illegal substance abuse, according

to the article in the Mercury.
"San Jose, which was a hot spot for such
gatherings, used to bring tens of thousands
of devotees to the Santa Clara fairgrounds
to hear dance music from around the
world," the article reports. "But increased
attention to the scene — which was often
associated with the drug 'ecstasy,' or 'E' —
made local officials wary and sent the par
ties packing to Fresno in 2000. Since then,
the scene primarily has been in San Francis
co and Oakland."
San Francisco, indeed. Loveparade San
Francisco hosted around 50,000 partygoers
this year, according to an article published
on Sept. 25 in the San Francisco Chronicle.
While Stanford is a far cry from the city
— and Goldgof says he knows few people
on the Farm who are interested in raves —
this type of event can be a refreshing
change from the weekend frat parties on
campus that can grow monotonous come
winter quarter.
Sophomore Riaz Rahim says that the
raves near his Los Angeles high school
"were a lot more social and a lot less physi
cal" than frat parties.
So if you want a new way to de-stress this
October, why not gather your friends and
head up north for some crazy (but drug
free, of course) escapades?

Cultural time capsules from the 1990s
— such as "Dawson's Creek" depict rave
scenes thick with dangerous drugs,sensuous
fun and sensory overload. While these de
bauchery-filled mob scenes still abound, a
new branch of more accessible, music-fo
cused raves seems to be on the rise.
This September. San Francisco hosted
Loveparade — an enormous rave that was
held outdoors rather than inside an obscure,
smoke-veiled club.
Loveparade San Francisco is actually an
extension of the original 1989 Loveparade
in Berlin, Germany This event was the
brainchild of a German DJ who wanted to
bring together musicians in order to pro
mote "tolerance, respect and understanding
between nations," according to Lovepa
rade's Website.
While the German version of the event
has been cancelled for the past two years,
Loveparade has spread to a variety of loca
tions, including Tel Aviv, Santiago and Mex
ico City.
Sophomore Gregg Goldgof says he re
cently went to a rave at the Fabric club in
London, a venue he describes as "very
posh...and famous," adding that while there
were nearly 1.000 people in the building, it
was completely under control.
"In London they have an institutional
ized rave scene," he explains.
And Junior Christina Ward, who co

taught a class in FroSoCo last year about
modern dance and culture, says that the
rave scene has become more organized than
it has been in years.
"You can pick up a flier instead of only
being able to hear it word-of-mouth," she
says."It is less of a subculture than it used to
be."
Finally, although drugs — specifically ec
stasy — are sometimes stereotyped as in
trinsically connected to the underground
party culture, a Sept. 23 article in the San
Jose Mercury News titled "Wild Raves Go
Mainstream" reported that drugs have be
come less and less central to the rave scene.
"...raves synonymous with drugs died
two years ago." Ross Ivika, a dance concert

promoter, told The Mercury.
Ward, however, disagrees, asserting that
both types of raves abound.
"It's not the majority of people that are
doing ecstasy...and there are lots of drug
free raves...but there is still a strong nega
tive stereotype about the levels of drug
usage."
Goldgof would agree, recalling drugs
being present at Fabric.
"There were people outside selling pills
which I think were probably ecstasy," he re
marks. "There were some [dealers] inside,
too [and] alcohol was everywhere."
Oftentimes, authorities hesitate to allow
planned raves in their cities due to the po
tential for illegal substance abuse, according

to the article in the Mercury.
"San Jose, which was a hot spot for such
gatherings, used to bring tens of thousands
