Heading south on El Camino, my
roommate's car is packed to capaci
ty. Ricky is discussing the Native
American frat he wants to start. (He's going
to call it Nu Delta Nu,or NDN for short).
The other passengers in the car are dis
cussing reasons we should or should not be
part of the frat.
"I should be in your frat," says my lily
white roommate. "If it weren't for my peo
ple, it would be pointless. I mean, you'd own
the continent. So why have a Native Amer
ican theme fraternity?"
Ricky, for some reason, seems uncon
vinced by this argument.
Then our friend Debz chimes in:"I
should be in your frat," he says. "My people
are the Indians that Columbus was actually
looking for!"
Luckily, we reach Los Charros before
any more political incorrectness can tran
spire. The savory smell of sizzling Mexican
food is apparent all the way up the block.
At the door, the waiter greets us in Span
ish, and we are escorted to a table for cinco.
Los Charros is a bustling, cozy, family
restaurant. We watch a college-aged couple
trying to have a conversation while the kids
at the next table sprinkle each other with
pepper and use the Tapatio hot sauce as a
club.
Los Charros looks like a stereotypical
Mexican restaurant, from the soccer game
on TV to the sombreros on the wall to the
decor by Corona. But there's no phoniness
here — this restaurant is what it is — and
what it is is good, fresh food.
The menu is built around burritos, tacos
and other standard Mexican fare. Comple
mentary chips and pico de gallo salsa whet
your appetite. For starters, get a giant que
sadilla with sour cream and guac to share
with friends. If you order a burrito, ask for it
"wet style" — smothered with green chili
sauce and extra cheese.
If you want to be adventurous, there are
entrees beyond tacos and tostadas. Menudo
(tripe and hominy soup) is available Fridays
and Saturdays. But If you're not in the
mood for sheep stomach, try the shrimp fa
jitas or eggs with chorizo.
No matter which entree you order, be
sure to choose a drink more exotic than
Diet Coke. Make your meal even more au
thentic with Corona or Tecate, or try fresh
squeezed carrot or orange juice. Best of all,
Los Charros has Mexican Jarritos sodas. If
you've never had horchata (rice milk with
vanilla and cinnamon), order it. Now.
Only a few minutes after I place my
order, my burrito arrives and the table sags
under its weight. This burrito could feed a
family of four fora week. If your housing
doesn't provide meals on the weekends,
order one of these babies and take your left
overs home. I dig in.
We're sitting at the bar and I have a per
fect view of the kitchen. I watch one of the
cooks chopping avocadoes with a terrify
ingly large cleaver, while another fries up
chicken fajitas.
Meanwhile, Debz is watching the soccer
game.
"They don't have names on their jer
seys!" he observes. "Every one says Corona.
I guess if Corona sponsors your team,
everyone has to change their name."
He laughs. "Corona passes to Corona,
Corona up the middle — Corona scores!
The crowd goes wild!"
We were tipped off about Los Charros
by a Mountain View resident, and she knew
what she was talking about. When the check
comes, it arrives with an after-dinner pep
permint for each of us. What's not to like
about this place?
The Verdict
Los Charros is perfect student fare. This
hole-in-the-wall taqueria is cheap, authen
tic and unpretentious.Take your friends this
weekend.
