## Editorial Strong stance needed with JAG 
### 
On Monday, the Navy Judge Advocate
General (JAG) Corps arrived at
Stanford Law School to recruit,
prompting student protests and a heated de
bate.
Law School policy currently prohibits em
ployers with discriminatory hiring practices
from recruiting students on campus. The mil
itary clearly falls into this prohibited catego
ry because its "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy
with regard to sexual orientation excludes
openly gay and lesbian students.
However, due to recent changes in the
regulations interpreting the Solomon
Amendment, educational institutions that
deny access to military recruiters now risk
losing all their funding from the federal gov
ernment. According to several sources, Stan
ford's federal funding totals around $700 mil
lion.Thus, to prevent a crippling financial loss
to the entire University, the Law School was
forced to allow JAG to recruit.
The Solomon Amendment is a troubling
infringement of academic institutions' free
dom of speech. The Law School's policy of
denying access to employers, such as the mil
itary, which discriminate on the basis of sexu
al orientation is more than just an arbitrary
rule. The policy also expresses the school's
view that such group-based discrimination is
harmful and stigmatizing.
Moreover, the Solomon Amendment
does not merely require the Law School to
tolerate the presence of the JAG recruiters,
but actually requires the school to offer JAG
the same access to students and assistance
from career services as other employers re
ceive. Thus, the amendment essentially com
pels the Law School to stifle its anti-discrim
inator)' message.
JAG's visit comes at a particularly impor
tant time in the battle to strike down the
Solomon Amendment. In 2003, a coalition of
law school faculty members filed suit against
the Department of Defense to challenge the
Solomon Amendment, and a federal appel
late court held that the Solomon Amend
ment was unconstitutional on the grounds
that it violated schools' right of expressive as
sociation and right against compelled
speech. However, the Supreme Court has
agreed to hear the case and arguments are
currently scheduled for Dec. 6.
Despite the significance of the Solomon
Amendment, University officials have
failed to respond sufficiently either to the
pending litigation or to recruiters' presence
on campus.

Notably, the University failed to sign on to
an amicus (friend-of-the-court) brief that was
joined by Cornell University, Yale University,
Harvard University, New York University,
University of Pennsylvania and the Universi
ty of Chicago. This omission displays a trou
bling lack of commitment both to the aca
demic freedoms that the Solomon Amend
ment implicates and to the anti-discriminato
ry views that the schools wish to express.
Although the amicus brief has already
been filed, the University can and should
publicly express its support for the briefs po
sition. In response to a petition from OUT
LAW, the Law School's LGBT organization.
University President John Hennessy issued a
brief statement on Monday that reads: "Al
though the Solomon Amendment is current
ly the law, that does not make it a good law. I
am pleased that our students are making
their voices heard on this issue and that the
Stanford law faculty are supporting a legal
challenge to the Solomon Amendment."
While Hennessy's praise of law students and
faculty is encouraging, this statement of ap
proval nonetheless falls short of joining other
top universities in asserting outright that the
Solomon Amendment is unconstitutional
and should be struck down.
The University has also failed to address
the inconsistency between the Law School's
recruiting policy — which denies access to
employers that discriminate on the basis of
race, ethnic background, national origin, gen
der, religion, age, disability, veteran status or
sexual orientation — and the University's
policy, which only prohibits those employers
that discriminate "unlawfully." Under this
wording, the military would be allowed to re
cruit at Stanford LJniversity, because the
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy is permitted
under current law. So far the University has
not defended the discrepancy between its
policy and that of the Law School, and the
Stanford community deserves an explana
tion.
Hennessy's recent statement of support is
laudable, but a much stronger response is
needed. Such cautious agreement under
mines current efforts to protect academic in
stitutions' First Amendment rights through
litigation and does nothing to reaffirm the
University's commitment to ending discrimi
nation based on sexual orientation. The LJni
versity should join its peer institutions and
issue a statement unequivocally expressing
support for the legal challenge to the
Solomon Amendment.
