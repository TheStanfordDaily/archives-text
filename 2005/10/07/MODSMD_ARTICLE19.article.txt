Resistance, not just debate, necessary in
dealing with military recruiters
In a letter on Wednesday (Military policy
should be debated, not censored, Oct. 5),
Luukas lives stated his disagreement with the
student group OUTLAW, which is actively
opposed to the presence of military recruiters
at the Law School. If the University were to
satisfy OUTLAW'S immediate concern by
challenging the constitutionality or presence
of such recruitment, lives writes that it will
"shut itself out from"the debate over the
"merits and costs of gays in the military."
In the discussion that OUTLAW has
helped prompt and lives has joined, there are
some key points that I think we ought not to
forget.
First, the issue of censorship. Speaking
roughly, one view in the current debate is that
gays constitute an undesirable presence and
should therefore be removed. The opposing
view holds that gays should not be singled out
and discriminated against for their orientation.
Rather than being "shut out" from the de
bate, those who wish to ban gays have ex
pressed their preference in one of the clearest
ways possible: Army policy. And this policy, it
should be added, is back by enshrinement in
U.S. law, in the form of the Solomon Amend
ment. Even if every campus in the nation
banned the presence of the military, the Army's
view on gays would still be heard and felt.
On the other side, resisters to the Solomon
Amendment claim that the "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell" policy is discriminatory. If this de

bate point is true, then there is a logical con
flict between the military's promulgation of
discrimination and the University's repudia
tion of it. Protesting students are simply try
ing to hold external recruiters accountable to
Stanford policy.
Far from censoring debate, therefore,
OUTLAW and other like-minded organiza
tions are actually maintaining one side of the
debate. If law students simply gave a silent
and unquestioning welcome to military re
cruiters, they wouldn't be allowing debate to
flourish — they would be withholding from it
altogether.
Second, lives fears that a ban on military
recruiters would "hurt students" by "imped
ing" their expressed interest in military ca
reers. Do students' well-being and our future
careers matter? Of course. But these person
al concerns don't exist in a vacuum where
they are defended at all costs. Instead, they
must be weighed against our sacrosanct prin
ciples of liberty and freedom from discrimi
nation.
The thousands of brave individuals who
risked the law by sitting at lunch counters, or
risked their meals by marching for farmwork
er protections, caused more than a little anxi
ety for this country, and probably messed up a
few careers along the way. And, for the sake of
the nation, thank goodness. Sometimes resist
ance, and the unapologetic maintenance of
principle, gives us the best debate we could
hope for.
