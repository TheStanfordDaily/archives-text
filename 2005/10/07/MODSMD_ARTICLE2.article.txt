Conference. In
stead, in three
plus years on
the Farm, Ed
wards has been
a member of a
program that
has mustered
only 11 wins.
By no
means are the
program's
struggles solely
a reflection of
Edwards' abili
ties as a player.
He has shown
that he can be
one of the best
quarterbacks in
the Pac-10 on
any given week,
but struggles
with injuries
and an often
depleted run
ning game have
limited his pro
duction.
Out of
high school, Ed
wards looked
like he was
going to be the
perfect quarter
back to contin
ue the good
times that the

Stanford program was enjoying under then head
coach Tyrone Willingham. He was a Bay Area prospect
out of Los Gatos High School and one of the top rated
quarterbacks in the nation. Some prominent publica
tions had Edwards as high as the No. 1 high school
quarterback in the nation. In the years before his ar
rival, the Cardinal were having some of their best
years, making it to two bowls in three years, including
the Rose Bowl in 2000.
But before Edwards had a chance to make one
play under center, Willingham bolted for Notre
Dame, and the team was headed fora 2-9 season.

Stanford heads to Pullman, Wash, for the first of two straight road games. The Cardinal scored a
23-17 victory over Washington State last season.
Edwards must assume team leadership

a bowl game and you see the incredi
ble players that came before you,"
Edwards said. "There have been
some incredible players who I've
played with here, but we haven't
made it to a game in December, and
that's kind of hard. That's one of the
goals you set for yourself in the be
ginning in each season.That's just the
way football goes."
As a redshirt freshman, in year
two of the Buddy Teevens era, Ed
wards looked like he could be the one
to pull the team out of its losing ways.
In his first game, after starter
Chris Lewis struggled in his first two
series, Edwards came into the game
and threw for 278 yards and two
touchdowns against San Jose State.
He earned the start and led the team
to a tough 18-14 win in front of a hos
tile crowd of more than 61,000 in
Provo, Utah against Brigham Young
University. He was the first redshirt
freshman quarterback to lead Stan
ford to a victory since 1991.
But that year, like his next, was cut
short by injury. He suffered a shoul
der contusion against Washington
State and did not start another game
for the rest of the season.
Now with another season and 16
total starts under his belt, Edwards is
no longer the young gun who would
take the helm of a successful team and
keep it on course but rather an expe
rienced leader who must bring a
struggling team back to respectability.
"I've played with some pretty
good leaders — some guys who have
stepped up as team leaders and
taken on those responsibilities," Ed
wards said. "So I've learned what to
say, how to say it, when to say things
and how to motivate guys. Definitely
as a quarterback you deal with that
responsibility on a daily basis, and
whether it's on the field or off the
field you've got to be the guy that the
team can look to."
That responsibility is something
that Edwards is eager to take on.

FADING IN THE FOURTH
While Stanford has outscored its opponents early, deficits late in
the game have been too much to overcome.

"That's kind of why you play the
quarterback position," Edwards
said. "You touch the ball on every of
fensive snap, you have the most re
sponsibility; you have to understand
everyone's job and their role. I enjoy
that. It's why I play the game of foot
ball. You get the most credit when
you win and you get the most credit
when you lose."
Yet Stanford's current losing
record has made Edwards' starting
role a little less certain. The quarter
back — who once looked to be a
sure thing, was forced to compete for
his starting spot this off-season with
sophomore T.C. Ostrander. Edwards
wasn't named the starter until Aug.
2fl, only two weeks before Stanford's
opening game at Navy.
"We both have the opportunity
and the skills to play the position,"
Edwards said." Whoever's starting at
the quarterback position, you're only
one snap away. Injuries happen a lot
and we've had our share of those
over the years."
Injuries certainly have been dam
aging to Edwards over the last three
seasons. Other than the shoulder in
jury he sustained in 2003, he missed
two starts last season and was
knocked out of two others. Already
this season, he was pulled out of the
Davis game with a hand injury.
The lack of a running game hasn't
helped Edwards in his quest to stay
injury-free. Last season the team av

eraged only 2.5 yards per carry and
ran for under 900 total yards. This al
lows defenses to focus in on the pass
rush and allows members of oppos
ing secondaries to more closely
guard the pass. As a result, Edwards
has had to get more comfortable
moving around in the pocket.
"When you're in those critical sit
uations when a play needs to be
made, you start to become more and
more comfortable because you've
been there before, you've seen it be
fore and you've studied film on it,"
Edwards said. "That's a good thing to
become more comfortable, but we
need to be able to pick up those
blitzes and handle those guys coming
through the gaps."
Now, in his third year as a starter,
Edwards must take his leadership
abilities to another level, while at the
same time, he must live up to the ex
pectations that were placed on him
out of high school. He has attempted
to do that, in large part, by not giving
up faith in his teammates and contin
uing to play hard every week.
"1 think that it's all there; it just
comes down to guys believing," Ed
wards said. "Any team can be beaten
in this league every

week, and this

team can
win each
week, re
gardless."

MATT COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior Trent Edwards has done his share of scrambling this season, something he has been forced to get used to,
despite his reputation as a passing quarterback.
