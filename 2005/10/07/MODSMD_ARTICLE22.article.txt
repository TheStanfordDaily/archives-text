# Adventures in Deutschland
## A 						funny thing happened on the way to the bathroom 
### 
1 arrived here with the theory that European women are a dazzling
and exotic breed, but ultimately a simple one, found in abundance
at bars and in clubs, and charmed by a smile and some quick
American wit. After three weeks in London, Munich and Berlin, the
empirical evidence collected leads me to say one word about my as
sumption: erroneous.
OK, so these women are definitely attractive, and there are cer
tainly lots of them, but they are still puzzling creatures. Half-naked
women abound — in television ads, newspapers, billboards and on
the covers of the copious amounts of pornography lining the Conti
nent's newsstands. But despite the overt sexuality that flourishes
throughout the land, actually meeting these women is quite a feat.
They are everywhere and nowhere at the same time, like al Qaeda,
Big Brother or John Bravman.
And when you finally do snare one with your North American
charm — or, as my high school history teacher called it, your imperi
al web of lies — you sometimes just end up just plain confused.
For Exhibit A, I reluctantly cite my first European hookup, appro
priately (or perhaps inappropriately) in a London hostel. I'm talking
to my friend Will and sipping a Red Bull and Vodka when this girl sit
ting with her friends nearby starts giving me the eye. I, of course,
saunter over and introduce myself.
"Is that a band?" she asks of my Modest Mouse t-shirt.
"Yes."
"Are you in it?"
"Umm,no."
I know what you're thinking. 1 should have lied to this British
chick. But since she didn't know who Modest Mouse are, she would
n't have been impressed by my lie. Plus it was karaoke night at the hos
tel, and 1 couldn't pull that shit off. Long story short, we end up hook
ing up on the dance floor. But here's where it gets all confusing. After
a while, her friends want to go, so she turns, gives me a coy smile and
extends her palm fora handshake. "It was very nice to meet you," she
says,and then ducks out the back door. I'm still debating whether she
was being smarmy or if she was actually just being really polite and

completely British. In any event, I was left completely flabbergasted.
Now, I've taken Stat 60 — or at least mostly passed the quizzes for
it — so I know that this is not a large-enough sample to prove any
thing. I've also read enough of those free STD pamphlets at Vaden to
know that if I conducted a proper survey, my venereal complications
could bankrupt Cardinal Care, And yet, I am reminded of the immor
tal words of Bono, who spoke of one woman — probably European
— who "moves in mysterious ways." Sure, I forget your name and I'm
never going to see you again, but a handshake? You just killed every
thing cool about that situation.
On the other hand, the gay community of Berlin is much more
easily found, though no less mysterious. TTie other night I went out
with some friends to the trendy Berlin neighborhood of Kreuzberg.
Walking around, we spot a cool-looking bar/lounge and decide to
check it out. After grabbing a table, we are surprised to find the walls
blanketed in homoerotic cartoon paintings, all for sale. No matter, we
say. Just a regular old gay bar.
We order some drinks, and then Kelsey and I ask the waiter where
the toilets are. He motions toward the back. We head through some
double doors to find a long line of men handing over 10 euro each to
go down to the bar's basement.
Oh yeah, and they each get a plastic bag after paying. Confused
and somewhat terrified, we dart out the back and take turns holding
the door open while we pee behind a dumpster in the alley. (Note:
Public urination is not illegal, but in fact widely-practiced in Berlin.)
To top it off, as I'm zipping up, a guy approaches and asks, in Eng
lish, "Where is the bar schwul?" Translation: Where's the gay bar?
So after a hardy laugh, we all get the hell out of there. But the man
in the alley has stuck with me. Perhaps Europeans, men and women
alike, are just really forward. Maybe my problem is that I'm not ap
proaching strange men in alleys and asking them where the straight
bar is. And what's wrong with a little shake-of-the-hand after a harm
less make-out session? I'll test this new tack and see how far it takes
me. And if all else fails, I can always hit on my sister's friends in Ju
nipero when I return to campus this winter — they appear to range,
according to the Facebook, from hot to very hot.
As an aside, after trashing the band Welcome to Florida in my last
column, I got an e-mail this week from who else but the drummer for
Welcome to Florida. He writes (all sic):"david herbert — i was google
searching my band (welcome to florida) and found your article,
thanks for ripping on us, its good to get some bad press once and a
while, plus it was hilarious. Have fun in berlin,that city sucks ass jzm."
So there, more free press for your sucky band.
David Herbert hopes his most meaningful correspondence while in
Berlin won't be that note from the drummer of Welcome to Florida —
but, just in case, he invites the lovely ladies of Junipero to e-mail him at
dherbert@stanford. edu.

tainly lots of them, but they are still puzzling creatures. Half-naked
women abound — in television ads, newspapers, billboards and on
the covers of the copious amounts of pornography lining the Conti
nent's newsstands. But despite the overt sexuality that flourishes
throughout the land, actually meeting these women is quite a feat.
They are everywhere and nowhere at the same time, like al Qaeda,
Big Brother or John Bravman.
And when you finally do snare one with your North American
charm — or, as my high school history teacher called it, your imperi
al web of lies — you sometimes just end up just plain confused.
For Exhibit A, I reluctantly cite my first European hookup, appro
priately (or perhaps inappropriately) in a London hostel. I'm talking
to my friend Will and sipping a Red Bull and Vodka when this girl sit
ting with her friends nearby starts giving me the eye. I, of course,
saunter over and introduce myself.
"Is that a band?" she asks of my Modest Mouse t-shirt.
"Yes."
"Are you in it?"
"Umm,no."
I know what you're thinking. 1 should have lied to this British
chick. But since she didn't know who Modest Mouse are, she would
n't have been impressed by my lie. Plus it was karaoke night at the hos
tel, and 1 couldn't pull that shit off. Long story short, we end up hook
ing up on the dance floor. But here's where it gets all confusing. After
a while, her friends want to go, so she turns, gives me a coy smile and
extends her palm fora handshake. "It was very nice to meet you," she
says,and then ducks out the back door. I'm still debating whether she
was being smarmy or if she was actually just being really polite and

completely British. In any event, I was left completely flabbergasted.
Now, I've taken Stat 60 — or at least mostly passed the quizzes for
it — so I know that this is not a large-enough sample to prove any
thing. I've also read enough of those free STD pamphlets at Vaden to
know that if I conducted a proper survey, my venereal complications
could bankrupt Cardinal Care, And yet, I am reminded of the immor
tal words of Bono, who spoke of one woman — probably European
— who "moves in mysterious ways." Sure, I forget your name and I'm
never going to see you again, but a handshake? You just killed every
thing cool about that situation.
On the other hand, the gay community of Berlin is much more
easily found, though no less mysterious. TTie other night I went out
with some friends to the trendy Berlin neighborhood of Kreuzberg.
Walking around, we spot a cool-looking bar/lounge and decide to
check it out. After grabbing a table, we are surprised to find the walls
blanketed in homoerotic cartoon paintings, all for sale. No matter, we
say. Just a regular old gay bar.
We order some drinks, and then Kelsey and I ask the waiter where
the toilets are. He motions toward the back. We head through some
double doors to find a long line of men handing over 10 euro each to
go down to the bar's basement.
Oh yeah, and they each get a plastic bag after paying. Confused
and somewhat terrified, we dart out the back and take turns holding
the door open while we pee behind a dumpster in the alley. (Note:
Public urination is not illegal, but in fact widely-practiced in Berlin.)
To top it off, as I'm zipping up, a guy approaches and asks, in Eng
lish, "Where is the bar schwul?" Translation: Where's the gay bar?
So after a hardy laugh, we all get the hell out of there. But the man
in the alley has stuck with me. Perhaps Europeans, men and women
alike, are just really forward. Maybe my problem is that I'm not ap
proaching strange men in alleys and asking them where the straight
bar is. And what's wrong with a little shake-of-the-hand after a harm
less make-out session? I'll test this new tack and see how far it takes
me. And if all else fails, I can always hit on my sister's friends in Ju
nipero when I return to campus this winter — they appear to range,
according to the Facebook, from hot to very hot.
As an aside, after trashing the band Welcome to Florida in my last
column, I got an e-mail this week from who else but the drummer for
Welcome to Florida. He writes (all sic):"david herbert — i was google
searching my band (welcome to florida) and found your article,
thanks for ripping on us, its good to get some bad press once and a
while, plus it was hilarious. Have fun in berlin,that city sucks ass jzm."
So there, more free press for your sucky band.
David Herbert hopes his most meaningful correspondence while in
Berlin won't be that note from the drummer of Welcome to Florida —
but, just in case, he invites the lovely ladies of Junipero to e-mail him at
dherbert@stanford. edu.
1 arrived here with the theory that European women are a dazzling
and exotic breed, but ultimately a simple one, found in abundance
at bars and in clubs, and charmed by a smile and some quick
American wit. After three weeks in London, Munich and Berlin, the
empirical evidence collected leads me to say one word about my as
sumption: erroneous.
