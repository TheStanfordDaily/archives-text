## Anti-athlete paranoia runs rampant 
### 
There's a new athletic complex on cam
pus, and it's not that fancy building be
hind the Ford Center. It's actually
more like what we'd call a "Paranoid non
athletic complex." A secret, underground
anti-athlete movement. Don't think we don't
hear you talking. "The athletes get this, the

athletes get that...the athletes are trying to
take over the school... the athletes already
have taken over the 5ch001..." We have spies
in the dining halls, the bathrooms and even
the Mudd Chemistry Building. Bet you did
n't think we could hear you there, did you?
Oh, but we can. We've heard you kids grum
bling in the halls about preferential athlete
treatment, and believe me, we know how
you've been spouting your whacked out ath
lete conspiracy theories.
"I hear they're allowed to miss all sorts of
classes without making up work."
"I hear they didn't have to go through ad
missions at all."
"Yeah, well someone told me they have a
special club room in a basement somewhere
where they can print for free."

"All the pages they want?"
"All the pages they want."
Well we're here to tell you a few things.
First, let us just say that your shoddy con
spiracy theories — while cunning and inven
tive — are nowhere near the level of Jeff
Goldblum. And since you'll never get to
smoke a stogie with Will Smith in a fighter
jet, that's no compliment.
We do all the same work that you do, and
don't let anyone tell you differently.The only
proven way to get out of problem sets is to
offer sexual favors to the professor or TA,
and while it's widely accepted that athletes
are better in bed than normal people, not
even the prospect of an A-minus in Math 19
is enough to make us consider tapping any
one with a unibrow that thick and pants that

high. (Actually, we'd better qualify that with
a "usually,"...we can't speak for the fencing
team; that might be their style).
As far as admissions is concerned, do you
really think, if we could drag in just any jock
with peas for brains but a rocket on his arm,
that we would have to witness our football
team being demolished by a bunch of straw
chewing farmers? And as for the secret print
ing club, we don't... well, ah... we do, but you
didn't hear it from us.
So hopefully we've dispelled the conspir
acy for now, but we need to get to the under
lying problem. This hostility — this cliquey
pitting of athlete against non-athlete and
jock against nerd — has got to stop.
OK, so we get the pleasure of seeing the
sun rise over the weight room several morn

ings a week and you don't. But why harp on
the differences? Deep down, we're just like
you. Just like you, we slaved away at 12th
grade pre-algebra, and just like you, we
sometimes worried that our 860 SAT com
posite might not be enough to get us into this
joint. We put our fancy Stanford-issue athlet
ic wear on one leg at a time, just as you do.
We understand if this is hard for you to
grasp. We realize that you've spent a long
time fixating on this non-athlete discrimina
tion. But Jeff, you've got to move on.

What are we going to do next week, Kevin ? Same
thing we do every week, Cassidy: try to take over
the Quad. If you would like to assist in their sin
ister diver plans, e-nuiil them at kmclean@stan
ford.edu and ckrug(&stanford.edu.
