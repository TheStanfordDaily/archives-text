## Keep Bonds out of the Hall 
### 
Bold Statement of the Week:
Barry Bonds has no place in
the Hall of Fame.
I don't care if he's going to end up
with the major league record for
most career home runs; he's a cheat.
If Pete Rose has no business in the
Hall of Fame because of his off-field
shenanigans, then Bonds certainly is
disqualified for the way he cheated
while playing the game.
Let's rewind a year or two. The
rise in muscle mass, head size and
home runs, combined with the de
crease in genital mass, led someone
in the MLB front office to pull his or

Rafael Palmeiro and Mark McGuire.
The three sluggers quickly became
See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No
Evil. Palmeiro emphatically wiggled
his finger at Congress, claiming he'd
never used steroids, only to test posi

spending more than 20years in Amer
ica, suddenly had problems under
standing English. And Big Mac re
fused to even use the word steroids.
The only refreshing breath of honesty
in the whole ordeal was Jose Canseco,
a man best known for his current affil
iation with the reality TV show The
Surreal Life. Surreal indeed...
While the three at the hearing
were disgraced, noticeably missing
from the whole ordeal was the home
