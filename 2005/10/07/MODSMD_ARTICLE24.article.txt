## Keep Bonds out of the Hall 
### 
Bold Statement of the Week:
Barry Bonds has no place in
the Hall of Fame.
I don't care if he's going to end up
with the major league record for
most career home runs; he's a cheat.
If Pete Rose has no business in the
Hall of Fame because of his off-field
shenanigans, then Bonds certainly is
disqualified for the way he cheated
while playing the game.
Let's rewind a year or two. The
rise in muscle mass, head size and
home runs, combined with the de
crease in genital mass, led someone
in the MLB front office to pull his or
her head out of the sand and finally
put a stop to the Steroid Era of base
ball. As a result, there was a giant
brew-hah-hah involving players, pri
vate supplement companies, the
courts and eventually Congress.
Everyone was concerned about
the effects that steroids were having
on the game. Not only wertf the record
books turning into one giant asterisk
but there was a justified concern that
young athletes were being implicitly
encouraged to take performance en

hancing drugs that have damaging ef
fects on long-term health.
Because MLB seemed incapable
of policing the problem itself, a spe
cial session of Congress was called
(Yeah, we've got two wars ongoing.
So what?). Players were subpoenaed
for testimony, including Sammy Sosa,
Rafael Palmeiro and Mark McGuire.
The three sluggers quickly became
See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No
Evil. Palmeiro emphatically wiggled
his finger at Congress, claiming he'd
never used steroids, only to test posi
tive two months later. Sosa. after
spending more than 20years in Amer
ica, suddenly had problems under
standing English. And Big Mac re
fused to even use the word steroids.
The only refreshing breath of honesty
in the whole ordeal was Jose Canseco,
a man best known for his current affil
iation with the reality TV show The
Surreal Life. Surreal indeed...
While the three at the hearing
were disgraced, noticeably missing
from the whole ordeal was the home
run prince himself, Barry Bonds. We
were told at the time that just be
cause Bonds had not been called to
testify there was no guarantee that
he would never testify.
Why wouldn't we call Barry to
begin with, though? Is he not on track
to be the most prolific home-run hit
ter of all time? Was he too busy in
February, sorting out lawsuits from
his mistress and denying his own
steroid use in grand jury testimony?
In December 2004, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle leaked grand jury
testimony that Barry Bonds was un
aware that substances provided by

his trainer, Greg Anderson, were
steroids. Anderson, who has now
been indicted in a steroid ring along
with BALCO exec Victor Conte,
gave Bonds substances that Barry
claimed he thought were "flaxseed
oil" and claimed he never knew he
was taking steroids.
Take a minute to look at that
claim. Barry Bonds is a marvelous
physical specimen. At 41. he's in bet
ter shape than most major league
players — in large part because of
his meticulous training regiment.
The man works hard to be what he is,
and that's one of the best players in
the game today, possibly ever.
The thing about Barry that I find
hard to believe is that he had no idea
what the substance he took had in it.
This is a man who has a personal chef
prepare all his meals to his exact di

etary specifications. He could proba
bly tell you the caloric content of his
last meal. How. all of a sudden, does a
man so attentive to his body, his
modus viviendi,turn into Mr. Magoo?
Setting aside the incredible na
ture of that denial, I'd like someone
to explain to me how we can take
BALCO Bonds as a serious candi
date for the Hall of Fame.
Palmeiro — a man with similar if
not equally impressive numbers —
has fallen from grace. One of only
four men to have 500 home runs and
3,000 hits, Palmeiro has a large con
tingent of detractors who are
staunchly set against putting him in
the Hall because of his steroid use.
Why is Bonds any different?
Okay, so Bonds has 200 more
home runs than Palmeiro and looks
to eventually overtake Aaron as the
home run king. Does this justify his
exemption from scrutiny?
Sorry Raffy, but you didn't cheat
hard enough. If you'd only started
steroids earlier in your career,
maybe you'd be number one and
above the law. Give me a break.
This brings me back to my original
point. Rose, the all time hit king, re

mains banned from baseball as a re
sult of his gambling habit off the field.
Bonds, the soon to be all time home
run king, deserves the same treat
ment. If anything. Rose is the lesser of
two evils, committing his crimes off
the field. Bonds cheated while he was
a player. It may not be a corked bat,
but the steroids do help the ball go
farther and keep Bonds playing, day
in and day out.
I'm not saying that Bonds isn't a
fantastic player. He's one of the best
ever, with maybe the purest swing of
all time. According to the standards
given to voters for the Hall, "Voting
shall be based upon the player's
record, playing ability, integrity,
sportsmanship, character and contri
butions to the team(s) on which the
player played."
1 don't get a vote and I'm not qual
ified to do so, but let's get a little con
sistency here. Ilie terms may be vague,
but surely one sin is no less than an
other. Bonds must go as Rose goes.

testify there was no guarantee that
he would never testify.
Why wouldn't we call Barry to
begin with, though? Is he not on track
to be the most prolific home-run hit
ter of all time? Was he too busy in
February, sorting out lawsuits from
his mistress and denying his own
steroid use in grand jury testimony?
In December 2004, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle leaked grand jury
testimony that Barry Bonds was un
aware that substances provided by

his trainer, Greg Anderson, were
steroids. Anderson, who has now
been indicted in a steroid ring along
with BALCO exec Victor Conte,
gave Bonds substances that Barry
claimed he thought were "flaxseed
oil" and claimed he never knew he
was taking steroids.
Take a minute to look at that
claim. Barry Bonds is a marvelous
physical specimen. At 41. he's in bet
ter shape than most major league
players — in large part because of
his meticulous training regiment.
The man works hard to be what he is,
and that's one of the best players in
the game today, possibly ever.
The thing about Barry that I find
hard to believe is that he had no idea
what the substance he took had in it.
This is a man who has a personal chef
prepare all his meals to his exact di

etary specifications. He could proba
bly tell you the caloric content of his
last meal. How. all of a sudden, does a
man so attentive to his body, his
modus viviendi,turn into Mr. Magoo?
Setting aside the incredible na
ture of that denial, I'd like someone
to explain to me how we can take
BALCO Bonds as a serious candi
date for the Hall of Fame.
Palmeiro — a man with similar if
not equally impressive numbers —
has fallen from grace. One of only
four men to have 500 home runs and
3,000 hits, Palmeiro has a large con
tingent of detractors who are
staunchly set against putting him in
the Hall because of his steroid use.
Why is Bonds any different?
Okay, so Bonds has 200 more
home runs than Palmeiro and looks
to eventually overtake Aaron as the
home run king. Does this justify his
exemption from scrutiny?
Sorry Raffy, but you didn't cheat
hard enough. If you'd only started
steroids earlier in your career,
maybe you'd be number one and
above the law. Give me a break.
This brings me back to my original
point. Rose, the all time hit king, re

mains banned from baseball as a re
sult of his gambling habit off the field.
Bonds, the soon to be all time home
run king, deserves the same treat
ment. If anything. Rose is the lesser of
two evils, committing his crimes off
the field. Bonds cheated while he was
a player. It may not be a corked bat,
but the steroids do help the ball go
farther and keep Bonds playing, day
in and day out.
I'm not saying that Bonds isn't a
fantastic player. He's one of the best
ever, with maybe the purest swing of
all time. According to the standards
given to voters for the Hall, "Voting
shall be based upon the player's
record, playing ability, integrity,
sportsmanship, character and contri
butions to the team(s) on which the
player played."
1 don't get a vote and I'm not qual
ified to do so, but let's get a little con
sistency here. Ilie terms may be vague,
but surely one sin is no less than an
other. Bonds must go as Rose goes.

Bold Statement of the Week:
Barry Bonds has no place in
the Hall of Fame.
I don't care if he's going to end up
with the major league record for
most career home runs; he's a cheat.
If Pete Rose has no business in the
Hall of Fame because of his off-field
shenanigans, then Bonds certainly is
disqualified for the way he cheated
while playing the game.
Let's rewind a year or two. The
rise in muscle mass, head size and
home runs, combined with the de
crease in genital mass, led someone
in the MLB front office to pull his or
her head out of the sand and finally
put a stop to the Steroid Era of base
ball. As a result, there was a giant
brew-hah-hah involving players, pri
vate supplement companies, the
courts and eventually Congress.
Everyone was concerned about
the effects that steroids were having
on the game. Not only wertf the record
books turning into one giant asterisk
but there was a justified concern that
young athletes were being implicitly
encouraged to take performance en

hancing drugs that have damaging ef
fects on long-term health.
Because MLB seemed incapable
of policing the problem itself, a spe
cial session of Congress was called
(Yeah, we've got two wars ongoing.
So what?). Players were subpoenaed
for testimony, including Sammy Sosa,
Rafael Palmeiro and Mark McGuire.
The three sluggers quickly became
See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No
Evil. Palmeiro emphatically wiggled
his finger at Congress, claiming he'd
never used steroids, only to test posi
tive two months later. Sosa. after
spending more than 20years in Amer
ica, suddenly had problems under
standing English. And Big Mac re
fused to even use the word steroids.
The only refreshing breath of honesty
in the whole ordeal was Jose Canseco,
a man best known for his current affil
iation with the reality TV show The
Surreal Life. Surreal indeed...
While the three at the hearing
were disgraced, noticeably missing
from the whole ordeal was the home
run prince himself, Barry Bonds. We
were told at the time that just be
cause Bonds had not been called to
testify there was no guarantee that
he would never testify.
