### DAVID BLACKMAN INTERMISSION DUFF LOVER 
My 10-year-old sister asked me to take
her to see Hilary Duff in concert, since I'm
so much cooler than our fa-

ther. Why this mattered

to her I will never un-

derstand. The con
cert audience was

easily 90 percent
female. The pri-

Mary attendees
were 10-to- 14-

year-old ado
lescent girls

chaperoned
by their moth
ers, aunts and
grandmoth
ers.

The concert had two openers. Both
seemed like they were there on the good
graces of Hil's band. The first sounded like
Phil Collins covering John Mayer. The au
dience didn't notice that this band wasn't

Hilary. They didn't even recognize
it as distinct from the subdued

background music in be
tween sets (most bizarre
part of the night: Radio-

head's "The Bends"
playing barely audibly
before and after each
set).

The kids in
the audience all
had glow sticks
and attempted to

wave them dur
ing the open-

ers, seem
ingly at

ran
dom,
look
ing like
20,000
spastic
chil
dren
going
into in
sul i n
shock. I

couldn't
catch the
bands'

names be
cause as
soon as the

lights dimmed
and they said
We are ..." the

audicnce went
completely fucking

bonkers, nearly
deafening me. As

soon as they realized
there was no estrogen
on stage, the audi
ence lost interest

and resumed talking. The low roar of fe
male voices was hard to distinguish from
the bands' inexpert use of guitar feedback.
At this point I noticed how many plat
inum blond mothers were nursing large
cups of Budweiser, and began worrying
about how 1 was going to get out of the
parking lot in my father's Camry with
hyper-tense steering. The fat girl next to
me had such a severe case of rhythm-defi
cient-disorder that her mother made her
stop clapping. The audience went silent
when the bands were replaced by Hilary
Duff commercials for Kohl's and Ice
Breakers gum.
The audience reminded me of Data try
ing to learn humor by performing stand-up
comedy on the holodeck, but failed when
he programmed the audience to laugh at
all of his jokes. The arena erupted in an
other ear-splitting roar when it was an
nounced that there were 25 minutes to Hi
lary. They chanted "Hill-ar-ee Hill-ar-ee"
at least seven times during this interval.
The girl next to me wet herself when a
spotlight illuminated a stage hand.
With three minutes to go, the screens
switched from a pre-recorded unfunny
"backstage live" with Hil to a countdown
with 1/100 second intervals. At 1:00:00 the
estrogen and screaming was too much for
me, and 1 closed my eyes and escaped to
my happy place.
Hilary's show was forgettable as well.
She could mostly sing, and her songs were
catchy enough — which will happen when
you lift your riffs from Aerosmith and the
Ying Yang Twins — but she had no stage
presence. The girls in the audience would
be happy to chant 'Death to the Infidels' if
she asked them to. But she does not.
Her backing band was three tattooed
emo guys who wanted nothing more than
to break into a power solo in the middle a
song. This made for an odd tension be
tween musicianship and nothingness dur
ing her show.
In the later part of her set, she an
nounced they were going to play "I Am,"

Hilary Duff has five main top
ics for songs, each one more
vapid than the last.
1. "I am special/You are special"—
It's good that Hilary is charting the
same territory explored by TLC and
Christina Aguilera, because we need a
few mine songs to play during com
mercials about anorexia. But I find Hi
lary's persona irreconcilable with
songs about self-doubt. As long as she
continues to cultivate an image of
being a Plastic, these songs will ring
false with me.
2. "I don't care that you broke up with
me, you suck"— Why on earth is she
singing these songs when her target
audience has yet to develop secondary
sexual characteristics?
3."Love is a vehicle for terrible
metaphors"—Apparently Hilary runs
into guys all the time in bars/Tokyo/al
leyways who fail to notice her. She
must appeal to these men the only way
she knows how — through the power
of song. Unless this guy thinks he's as
cool as James Dean. Hil is very explic
it on this —you do not fuck with
James Dean.
4. "I'm lost/My life is hard/You don't
know me/I am so fucking rich"—
Again with the hollow self-doubt. Hi
lary worries about "Haters" and peo
ple who think they know her, but don't
really. Man, I can really identify with
being propelled into prefab stardom
and feeling adrift. Maybe if she picked
up a coke habit I'd find this argument
more compelling.
5. "RAWK"—It is very important
that her audience understand that
"girl can rock," because apparently
there has been much debate over
whether ovaries prevent one from
being able to rock. Equally important
is Hilary laying out her modus operan
di — she is here for one purpose, to
"rock this world." She asserts that girls
do not want glitter, only RAWK. I find
this sentiment hard to stomach

a song they had only been performing fora week, so they might
screw it up — which I think is awesome, because usually when a
performer says this, they end up getting about six bars in, scream
ing FUCK and starting over into an even more aggressive groove.
Hilary did not show this level of musicianship. This was the worst
song of the night because the visuals were so low budget.
All of her other songs were accompanied by painfully literal
video footage or abstract lava visualizations projected by a five
story light matrix behind her, which would've made a pointillist
weep with joy. "I Am" is instead accompanied by video on small
screens off-stage, with the lyrics highlighted sing-a-long style over
a cloudscape. The chorus encouraged "I am special/I am beauti
ful/1 am wonderful/And powerful/Unstoppable..." The footage
made me feel like I was at a cult initiation. It was very repetitive
and oddly soothing.
At this point, Hil stopped with all of the sensitive songs and got
down to business: songs about rocking and being awesome. I
looked over at my sister, who seemed disinterested by the whole
affair, and decided that I was going to make up for her lack of en
thusiasm by doubling mine. 1 threw my devil horns in the air and
sang and felt, I really feel, like Hil and I connected. We both con
firmed that "Girl. Can. Rock."
