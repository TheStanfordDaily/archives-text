### DAVID BLACKMAN INTERMISSION DUFF LOVER 
My 10-year-old sister asked me to take
her to see Hilary Duff in concert, since I'm
so much cooler than our fa-

ther. Why this mattered

to her I will never un-

derstand. The con
cert audience was

easily 90 percent
female. The pri-

Mary attendees
were 10-to- 14-

year-old ado
lescent girls

chaperoned
by their moth
ers, aunts and
grandmoth
ers.

The concert had two openers. Both
seemed like they were there on the good
graces of Hil's band. The first sounded like
Phil Collins covering John Mayer. The au
dience didn't notice that this band wasn't

Hilary. They didn't even recognize
it as distinct from the subdued

background music in be
tween sets (most bizarre
part of the night: Radio-

head's "The Bends"
playing barely audibly
before and after each
set).

The kids in
the audience all
had glow sticks
and attempted to

wave them dur
ing the open-

ers, seem
ingly at

ran
dom,
look
ing like
20,000
spastic
chil
dren
going
into in
sul i n
shock. I

couldn't
catch the
bands'

names be
cause as
soon as the

lights dimmed
and they said
We are ..." the

audicnce went
completely fucking

bonkers, nearly
deafening me. As

soon as they realized
there was no estrogen
on stage, the audi
ence lost interest

and resumed talking. The low roar of fe
male voices was hard to distinguish from
the bands' inexpert use of guitar feedback.
At this point I noticed how many plat
inum blond mothers were nursing large
cups of Budweiser, and began worrying
about how 1 was going to get out of the
parking lot in my father's Camry with
hyper-tense steering. The fat girl next to
me had such a severe case of rhythm-defi
cient-disorder that her mother made her
stop clapping. The audience went silent
when the bands were replaced by Hilary
Duff commercials for Kohl's and Ice
Breakers gum.
The audience reminded me of Data try
ing to learn humor by performing stand-up
comedy on the holodeck, but failed when
he programmed the audience to laugh at
all of his jokes. The arena erupted in an
other ear-splitting roar when it was an
nounced that there were 25 minutes to Hi
lary. They chanted "Hill-ar-ee Hill-ar-ee"
at least seven times during this interval.
The girl next to me wet herself when a
spotlight illuminated a stage hand.
With three minutes to go, the screens
switched from a pre-recorded unfunny
"backstage live" with Hil to a countdown
with 1/100 second intervals. At 1:00:00 the
estrogen and screaming was too much for
me, and 1 closed my eyes and escaped to
my happy place.
Hilary's show was forgettable as well.
She could mostly sing, and her songs were
catchy enough — which will happen when
you lift your riffs from Aerosmith and the
Ying Yang Twins — but she had no stage
presence. The girls in the audience would
be happy to chant 'Death to the Infidels' if
she asked them to. But she does not.
Her backing band was three tattooed
emo guys who wanted nothing more than
to break into a power solo in the middle a
song. This made for an odd tension be
tween musicianship and nothingness dur
ing her show.
In the later part of her set, she an
nounced they were going to play "I Am,"
