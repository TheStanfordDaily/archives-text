# Don't Hate the Man...
## He pays for our gas money and beer 
### CALEY ANDERSON BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION SELLER-OUTERS 
We know that some of you were furious when you opened In
termission today. You thought, "How dare Intermission expand
to twelve pages? Not since the days of Commumission has Inter
mission dared to go so big."
We understand your apprehension.
If Intermission goes bigger, it might forget the little people who
got it to the place it is today. If our little tabloid bloated into a 12
page "real paper" then what would come of the stylin' graphics
and smokin' layout? Am 1 going to open up Intermission next
week and see, instead, a mini-Daily?
The answer is no. We hear your concerns, dear Intermission
readers, and we are here to assure you that we are not selling out
to The Man; we just expanded.

You may have noticed a few more ads in Intermission last
week than usual. The increased readership over the past year has
brought more (legitimate A&E) advertising to us. and in order to
accommodate the myriad articles (FYI: there isn't supposed to be
an 'of,' check your style guide, suckas) and ads we had no choice
but to go big (or go home). And for better or for worse, nobody
puts Intermission in the corner.
The big ads contract that Intermission just signed
doesn't mean that we will compromise our creative vision.
You can always trust us to give you a fair and balanced
look at arts, style and entertainment here at Stanford Uni
versity.

Intermission prides itself on cutting-edge content and our
change in size and advertisement amount will have no effect upon
our articles. No matter how hard adside may try, there is no price
high enough to buy Intermission. Miss Roxy Sass is still advocat
ing for every day to become "Hump Day"and we think after this
issue we may not be welcome in the fine arts community anymore.
(When were we ever a part of the fine arts community you ask?
Roxy Sass says suck it.)
So sit back, drink your low-carb beer (less sugar doesn't mean
your liver still doesn't hate you) and take a moment to appreciate
Intermission's new heft. And then go see "Sound of Music" or
one of those other movies advertised on page nine.
