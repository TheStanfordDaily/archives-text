# Cardinal face high-flying Cougars
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Last season the Cardinal went to Pullman,
Wash, to face Washington State in a mid-October
battle and came out with a victory — their last of
the season. Tomorrow, Stanford is hoping fora
repeat performance against the Cougars, but this
time the team is trying to use the game as a step
ping stone, rather than a final hurrah.

Heading into this week's matchup, both the
Cardinal (1-2,0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) and the
Cougars (3-1,0-1) are coming off of a demoraliz
ing loss — though both in very different fashions.
Stanford was humiliated at home by Oregon,
44-20, in a game which the Ducks (4-1,1-1) dom
inated. The Cardinal allowed more than 300 total
yards in the first half, and on the offensive side
could only muster one first down in
the final two periods.
Washington State, on the other
hand, lost a hearthreaker to Oregon
State, 44-33.The Cougars accumulat
ed over 630 yards of total offense,
and sophomore quarterback Alex
Brink set a new school record pass
ing for 531 yards in the loss.
The question this week for Stan
ford is whether it will be able to keep
up with Washington State's high
powered offense as well as Oregon
State did.
"In order for us to be successful,
we have to get better at the things
we're not doing very well right now
— which are tackling, keeping the
ball in front of us and getting pressure
on the passer," head coach Walt Har
ris said in a press conference earlier
this week. "Offensively, our line
needs to become much more consis
tent in protecting the passer. We've
got to find a way to score touch
downs."
Scoring touchdowns, especially
on offense, is something that Stan
ford has struggled to do this season.
After a powerful offensive perform
ance in the opening game against
Navy, the Cardinal have scored just

one offensive touchdown in the last
two games.
Some of the lack of offensive pro
duction can be attributed to injury
problems. Junior quarterback Trent
Edwards missed most of the Davis
game with an injured hand and star
receiver Evan Moore, a junior, hasn't
played since dislocating his hip
against Navy.
"Any time you lose a guy like
[Evan Moore] that is extremely diffi
cult," Edwards said. "Both on the
field and off the field he's a player
that brings a lot of intensity to the
game — he plays with a lot of heart.
It hurts us a little in the running game
because a lot of the defenses, second
ary-wise, will double up on Evan and
that opens up the running holes for
Anthony [Kimble], Jason [Evans],
and J.R. [Lemon]."
There is no room for excuses
against a Washington State offense
that has exceeded most predictions
coming into this season.
"They have an outstanding runner
and their quarterback has put up big
numbers," Harris said. "They also
have a couple of highly rafriked re
ceivers, so right now all those things
scare us. It presents a big problem.

We're not scoring a lot of points on of
fense, so we've got to really slow them
down on defense, get off the field on
third down and make it happen."
Defending the Cougars receivers
does present a major challenge for the
Cardinal. Last week, Oregon racked
up 463 passing yards among three
quarterbacks and the Ducks' number
one receiver, Demetrius Williams, was
able to catch for 168 yards.
"We have a lot of young players in
the secondary' that are playing for the

first time — I'm one of them," junior
safety David Lofton said. "There are
definitely some things th.it we can
sharpen up on, and that will come
with experience. We just need to exe
cute our assignments a little better.
There were a lot of mental errors out
there on Saturday [against Oregon]
that if they hadn't occurred, the out
come might have been a little bit dif
ferent."
Washington State brings a potent
offense, headed by its quarterback.

to the field. Brink's main target this
season has been Jason Hill, who has
already caught for 521 yards and
seven scores in just three games.
Jerome Harrison, who is averag
ing over 130 yards per game, leads
the rushing attack. The team has
combined for an average of over 500
yards per game this season.
Last season it was clutch defensive
play and big plays on offense that
helped Stanford to a victory in Pull
man. A 67-yard touchdown reception

by Moore proved to be the winning
score. This year, without Moore and
with a defense that struggled to stop
Oregon offensively, Pullman looks as
difficult a place to play as ever.
"It's always tough playing up at
Pullman," Edwards said. "Last year it
was really loud and really cold, and I
expect it to be that way this year.The
thing that they have is that they play
down hill. They have a lot of intensi
ty. We'll have our hands full, but I
think we can get the job done."
