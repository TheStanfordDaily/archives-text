## More shoes than a sweatshop

If it has Cameron Diaz in

a bikini (and, oh yes, it has

Cameron in a kini), it must
be a romantic comedy. Yet

"In Her Shoes," however
funny it may be at times, is no

romcom — the official Stan
ford term. It is not romantic

in either sense of the word.
The love affair is not the key

plot point, nor is the film chock-full of
idealism or fictitious folly.
Instead, the film begins with sta
ples of a student's life here at Stanford
— a drunk woman throwing up in the
bathroom stall, workaholics, that

dorky cute guy with whom no one

will go out, cheating boyfriends

and an awkward voice-of-God
narration that thankfully

j
only lasts through the open
ing credits.

With the introductory
voice-over, the two main
characters pigeon-hole them

selves into the only female
stereotypes on earth: whore/vir
gin, fun/serious, whore/lawyer,
whore/uglier. If they had kept

to these stereotypes, the movie would
have ended after five minutes and
been exceedingly crappy, consisting
only of the above-mentioned voice
over and several shots of Diaz's
breasts and thighs.
Fortunately for the moviegoer,
these stereotypes prove useless as
compasses for character (even as the
camera remains a useful compass for
locating Diaz's breasts and thighs).
That these characters are believable
as human beings makes the film ac
ceptable and even quite good. 1 offer
Reese Witherspoon in "Legally
Blonde 11: Red, White and Blonde" as
an example of the unacceptable and
the even quite bad.
The story revolves around Rose
(Toni Collette), a single 30-something
lawyer who kicks her younger, irre
sponsible, dissolute and barely liter
ate sister Maggie (Diaz) out of her
apartment and her life. Maggie then
leaves Philadelphia for sunny Florida
and her long-lost grandmother's re
tirement community.
The plot stretches here and there
at times. But here's what makes the
less-than-believable parts bearable:
they're not soap opera unbelievable.
They're this-used-to-be-a-novel-and

when-we-turned-it-into-a-film-we-
had-to-cut-stuff unbelievable.
And there are no jerky plot twists
for the sake of convenience. Nothing
is sudden about the movie at all. It
takes its time in revealing characters,
solving conflict and even in capturing
the priceless facial expressions of its
talented cast. Collette, though breast
and thigh-less for the purposes of this
movie, is incredible as always.
After a somewhat onerous begin
ning, the happiness factor picks up
upon Maggie's arrival in Florida. The
reason? Geriatrics. More than just
eye candy, these active seniors add
humor and wisdom to an already
funny and perceptive film.
With Collette and Diaz as the lead
ing women and Shirley MacLaine as
their grandmother, this would seem to
be one of those chick flick things. I
can't help you there. I liked it. The

(manly) guy sitting next to me liked it.
Until he went home and thought
about it. And decided the part when
Collette starts a dog-walking business
was just weird. But he still liked it at
the time. Diaz's breasts and thighs
may have had something to do with it.
Plus, Curtis Hanson is the director.
He did "8 Mile," "Wonder Boys" and
"L.A. Confidential," so he's not into
the whole chick flick thing so much as
the realistic and good movie thing.
With him is an enjoyable cast — in
cluding Mark Feuerstein, Cliff Calley
from"The West Wing" — and an oh
so-tricky makeup artist (Collette
grows increasingly beautiful through
out the film, and Diaz's thighs look
the same as they did 15 years ago).
You don't have to have a sister
who is an opposite to enjoy this movie
— although 1 have one — and you
don't have to like old people humor
— even though I quite do. Sure, it's
slightly long of two hours, which is
usually unacceptable unless you're
shooting all of the Civil War and most
of Reconstruction. But "In Her
Shoes" creates a dream world that
truly engages. It manages to entertain
the moviegoer without moralizing at
or requiring suspension of reason.
