"Jaws" is celebrating its 30th Anniversary this year. If
you don't find "In Her Shoes" appealing, consider re
visiting the film that propelled director Steven Spielberg
to Hollywood stardom.

Late in 1974, two movie producers were fran
tically contemplating their futures. Richard D.

Zanuck and David Brown were working on

a new film with a bright young director
named Steven Spielberg, and things were
not going well. The mechanical shark used
in the movie, affectionately known to the
crew as "Bruce," was not working. In fact.

the first time they tried using the shark, it
sank. The two producers thought that
their careers, together with Spielberg's,
l were sinking along with it.

Of course, this would not be the
case. "Jaws" would become the high
est-grossing movie up to that time

and would change the structure of
Hollywood forever. Prior to 1975,

studios would release B movies
and exploitation pictures during
summer. Today, summer is dom

inated by big budget f/x movies like "The Island"
and "Fantastic Four." For better or worse, the suc
cess of "Jaws" was pivotal in this transformation.
Though "Jaws" was responsible for ushering
in an era of brainless f/x action pictures, it is cer
tainly not one of them. A seamless mix of charac
ter driven moments and thrilling shark attack
scenes, "Jaws" is a bona fide classic. No monster
movie since 1975 has come close to matching the
tension generated by "Jaws" (... well, "Alien"
comes close).
There are many wonderful moments in
"Jaws." The film's opening scene, a moonlight
swim that ends in tragedy, is terrifying. A daylight
attack on a young rafter is similarly horrific. The
first unclouded glimpse of the shark (accompa
nied by the infamous "You're gonna need a bigger
boat!" line) is classic. Spielberg's skill as a director
is undeniable. John Williams's iconic score is un
touchable.
But it's the quieter moments that set "Jaws"
apart from the myriad clones. Quint recounting
the disturbing fate of the USS Indianapolis crew.

Brody's son mimicking his tired father. A shell
shocked mayor acknowledging his part in the is
land's tragedies. Such character-driven move
ments are crucial to "Jaws." Actually, they're cru
cial to any movie interested in developing three di
mensional characters.
"Jaws" was followed by three sequels and nu
merous copycat movies. "Jaws 2," released in
1978, is surprisingly good. It has much of the orig
inal's thrill but is not interested in its characters.
"Jaws 3-D" and "Jaws: The Revenge" are both
forgettable. "Piranha," a movie about killer fish
terrorizing a school camp, is fast-paced but silly.
"Deep Blue Sea," a movie about genetically en
gineered 'smart sharks,' is fun and violent but
also trashy.
Earlier this year, fans from all over the world
marked the 30th anniversary of Spielberg's thriller
by attending a weekend-long celebration at
Martha's Vineyard (where the film was shot). The
festival was called "Jawsfest." 1 somehow doubt
moviegoers will be Attending an "Anacondafest"
in 22 years.
