## You! With the book! Put it down and turn on the TV 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION COUCH POTATO 
With more and more shows debuting and a greater emphasis on quality over reality, its a good time for television — a darn
good one. But since there is only so much time available for the boob tube, how do you chose what to watch? Here are
some must-see showp to get you started.

Desperate Housewives (ABC)-
It feels a hit cliche to he putting the most
popular show in America on the list, hut it
seems like there are still those who see ABC's
suburban comedy drama as little more than a
hyped-up, gossip-laden soap opera. But any
one who gave the show a chance last year was
treated to so much more, as "Housewives" pro
vided a skewed look at the goings on behind
closed doors that never failed to intrigue and
bewilder viewers. Brimming with personality
and always quick on its delivery, "House
wive's" cultural saturation alone should be
enough incentive to watch. Get your finger on
the pulse, people.

Veronica Mars (UPN)- • , . 'srjg, <
"Mars" airs onlJPN and is billed primarily as a'ktfm
dard teen-drama, which is probably why you've never
heard of it. But those lucky enough to catch the show
about a private investigator's daughter's crime-solving
adventures in the fictional town of Neptune were treat
ed to overarching, mature storylines dealing with serial

killers, class struggle, rape, incest and
the murder of a software tycoon's
daughter. Plus, bottom line, Mars was
probably the most well-written, well
acted program of last year.
The second season started jff with
a startling bang as a school bus of

Veronica's classmates toppled off a cliff, killing all those
inside and, as Veronica notes in her oft-charming nar
ration, nothing happens in Neptune without a reason.
There's no excuse toi mining "Mars" tlm tune around.

Supernatural (WB)-
Don't let the lazy title and some
what unoriginal premise fool you: the
WB's new show about two brothers
who fight the "supernatural" on a
quest to solve the mystery of their
mother's murder 22 years before is
often genuinely scary and has perhaps
the greatest potential of any new show
this fall. "Hie dialogue is at times clum
sy, and the stories so far haven't shined
with creativity, but the chemistry be
tween the two leads and well-drawn
suspense thus far certainly make up for
it.

Lost (ABC)-
u Lost" was originally advertised as an ensemble show about
the struggle of a group of plane crash survivors on a deserted
island. Hie premiere gave viewers something they didn't ex

pect: a mysterious transmission that had been repeating for the
past 16 years, a gigantic unseen monster and a clash with a polar
bear. "Lost" blended every survivor story of the past with a

touch of the supernatural to create one of the most original, excit

ing and refreshing shows of recent memory. A show where one plot

revelation per show just doesn't cut it, "Lost" is filled with
twists and turns, which never fail to shock and surprise

(and sometimes confuse).
As the second season begins, no longer are

viewers merely wondering where the survivors
are. hut why they all seem connected to one an

other, what exactly the "numbers" are and
whether or not those shipwrecked on the is

land are, in fact, all dead. There's a bit of a
learning curve in jumping into the show at
this point, but those willing to put some ef- *
fort into it will be welJ-rewarded.

Wild Card-
Truth is, it's too difficult to pick just one show as the fifth to watch, as
none seems to stand out above the rest at this point. "Everybody Hates
Chris" and "How I Met Your Mother" show great potential in the comedy
category but don't quite seem to have hit their stride. "Invasion" and
"Threshold" could turn out to be the suspenseful thrillers they aspire to be
but just aren't there yet. "Entourage" is good but inaccessible to those not
shelling out cash for pay-cable channels. Lastly, there's no real point in
mentioning "The 0.C." because you'll all be watching that anyway.
Either way, TV appears to have officially pulled out of its reality phase,
and an abundance of shows striving for high quality rather than shock
value are readily available for viewing. No matter what program you
choose to occupy your television, odds are it'll already be infinitely better
than "Temptation Island."
