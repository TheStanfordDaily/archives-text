## The
						one thing Cal and Stanford can agree on: Hilary Duff is not good people 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION DITCH DIGGER 
After a summer of intensely
watching television, reading Rolling
Stone and listening to Top 40 radio, I
was worried that three weeks without
Internet, television, mail or radio
(not to mention limited phone ser
vice) was going to, basically, end me.
Pop culture fed my soul for three
months and I was just going to aban
don it?
Magically, I survived. I com
muned with nature. I sat and stared at
a wall for 45 minutes at six in the
morning and then dug ditches in the
afternoon. I experienced Mike Jones.
I was clueless to the content of "The
O.C.'s" premiere, and I didn't mind.
When I emerged from the woods
three weeks later, I had a renewed
optimism about the world. Yes, there
are still bad people that steal from
book drives; yes, our president still
resembles a monkey; and yes, the

polar bears are begin
ning to use SPF 30 (al
though I recommend
45) because of global
warming. But the
world is still spin- j

ning, gosh darn it!
And then my
best friend (who
goes to Cal, but this
is another issue we
have worked
through) called me.
"HAVE YOU

SEEN THE MUSIC CHARTS?"
she literally screamed over the
phone. Apparently this travesty
eclipsed pleasantries.
"No," I replied, in a voice that I
hoped was soothing, but could have
just as easily been a creepy impres
sion of that guy at that party that you
can't escape, "1 have been in the mid
dle of nowhere."
"HILLARY DUFFS GREAT
EST HITS ALBUM DEBUTED
AT NUMBER ONE."
And just like that, eight words
crushed my balloon of joy like the
wildebeests that stampeded Mufasa
to death in "Hie Lion King."
The conversation continued on
like this for quite awhile, moving
from "How can someone with two al
bums have enough singles to compile
a list of greatest hits? It took No
Doubt ten years!" to "Where has the
respect for history gone?" to "This is
what is wrong with society in a nut
shell."

Who could have known my
foray back into the "real
world" would be met with

one of the major signs of
the apocalypse? Forget
comets and illiteracy, it

may just be pop culture that
ends us.
On a happier note, my in-room

cable request went through
this morning. It's the little

things.
