### RACHEL LIN INTERMISSION APPLE SAUCER 
Fiona Apple has never been one for conven
tionality. When the singer-pianist emerged on the
music scene in 1996, at the age of 18, with her bril
liant debut "Tidal," she quickly became famous not
only for her superb, tortured song writing, but also
for her dramatic outbursts and bizarre behavior.
During her 1997 Video Music Awards accep
tance speech for her underwear-clad role in the
highly popular "Criminal" video, Apple declared
that "this world is bull****" and that she had been
successful because she had an eating disorder. Yet
somehow, the drama queen antics and Apple's
seemingly troubled mental state never muddled
her talent. Her 1999 follow-up, "When the Pawn ...
was a similarly well-inspired and beautiful piece
of work; it can be said that it is precisely Apple's
unconventionally, along with her forceful piano
arrangements and emotive lyrics, that draws such a
loyal fanbase.
Apple has not been heard from since 1999, and
the story behind her latest release. "Extraordinary
Machine." is as tortured as the singer herself. The
album was originally completed in 2003, but was
reportedly scrapped by Apple's bosses at Sony
Music because they felt it lacked potential hit sin
gles. Fiona's dedicated fans petitioned for release
of the album however, and earlier this year 11
tracks from the original sessions were leaked on
the Internet.
The tracks were reportedly poorly arranged
and far from Apple's potential, however. A trip
back to the studio earlier this year to re-work nine
of the songs with producers Brian Kehew and Mike
Elizondo (the latter of whom co-wrote such hip
hop anthems as 50 Cent's "In Da Club"and Em
inem's "The Real Slim Shady") resulted in the cur
rent CD, which is once again highly creative and
extraordinary, indeed.
"Machine" opens with the title track, a song that
finds Apple's voice laid over a simple orchestral

about
Apple, and when taken together with
"Waltz" (easily one of the album's strongest
tracks) represents the most innovative material on
the record.
"Machine" then launches into the energetic,
piano-driven revenge fantasy "Get Him Back,"
which finds Apple at her infuriated best, and every
subsequent song is just as successful.
Stand out tracks include "O'Sailor," in which
Apple's soaring voice in the final chorus is easily
one of the most beautiful melodies I have heard re
cently, and "Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song)."
The latter bears Elizondo's mark, as Apple sings
over a snappy beat about an ex she can't get over,
spewing lyrics such as "I'm either so sick in the
head/1 need to be bled dry, to quit/Or I just really
used to love him/I sure hope that's it,"in her signa
ture smoky voice.
As always, Apple's lyrics are clever and overrid
den with stories of broken relationships (most of
the album was written in the aftermath of Apple's
break-up with director Paul Thomas Anderson).
However, as with her previous albums, the out
come is a set of songs that are powerful emotional
ly and musically. Despite her penchant for drama,
the pop world can perhaps forgive Miss Apple her
eccentricities, so long as she continues to deliver
records that are this innovative, melodic and lovely.
