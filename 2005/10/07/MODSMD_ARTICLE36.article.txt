## Weird-ass game, straight from Japan 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION ROLLING BALL OF DEATH 
In the gaming dark ages of se
quels and non-innovative rehashes,
it's always a refreshing change of
pace to discover a title that is truly
unique and, most importantly, fun.

"Katamari Damaci," hailed as one

of the most original and hilari

ously enjoyable games

of the year,
showed the

gaming
community
that it was still
possible to cre
ate an entirely

*5®

new game that
was not only different, but also suc-

cessful.
When a sequel to "Katamari
Damaci" was announced, gamers
met the news with skepticism. How
could this sequel possibly trump the
ingenious originality of the first
one? Thankfully, the sequel, appro
priately titled "We Love Katamari,"
decides to take a completely differ
ent and refreshing route down the
sequel road with a game that is just
as hilarious, just as fun and even
more convoluted than the previous
one.
It is extremely hard to describe
the nature of "We Love Katamari"
on paper. Essentially, the game is
about a tiny prince who rolls a huge
sticky ball—called a katamari —
that picks up items inside the world.
The more items that are picked

up, the bigger the kata

mari becomes

which al

lows

you to
pick up even

bigger items.
Also, the game compen

sates for your katamari becoming
bigger by zooming out so you can
see more of the game world at the
same time. You can start out in the
room of a house and get big enough

to move outdoors, and eventually
your katamari could become huge
enough to pick up the house that
you started with.
The object of the game then be
comes a race against time to get
your katamari as big as possible so
you can pick up houses, cities, land
masses and even clouds. "We Love
Katamari" takes the addicting
gameplay of the first title and adds
more levels, more stuff to roll up
and a great co-op mode that has two
players trying to control one kata
mari.
The story from "We Love Kata

mari" is one of the
most self

serv-
i n g

tales
I've

ever

heard. The

whole premise of the

game is that the fans loved

the first game so much, that the
characters from it have decided to
appease the fans by doing more of
what made the first game great. The
amount of meta references in the
game boggles the mind and just
makes the experience extremely fun
and

lighthearted.
The soundtrack, which was defi
nitely the greatest aspect of the first
title, falters a bit with some of the
new and remixed songs, but on the
whole it still provides a great musi
cal experience.
Again, 1 know fora fact this small
article on "We Love Katamari" will

never do it justice. If you have a
spare $30 (or $20 for the original) go
out and buy this game now. Even if
it turns out to be too weird or eccen
tric for your gaming tastes, at least
you'll have tried out one of the most
original titles to hit the gaming
world in years. 1 know 1 still love
Katamari.
