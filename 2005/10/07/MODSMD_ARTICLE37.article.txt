## Never fear, kiddies, Roxy's integrity is here to stay 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Everyone knows that Halle Barry could
have played any role in the business after
winning that Oscar. But instead of going for
Shakespeare, she decided maybe she just
wanted money. Thus, "Catwoman" hap
pened. Many people blamed Halle for sell
ing out, but when it comes down to econom
ics and personal integrity, if someone was
paying you enough to sell out. wouldn't you?
If someone happened to pay Roxy
enough for her stories and columns, she
might consider doing a book-turned-movie
deal, as long as it entailed full creativocpn
trol and a few poolside cabana boys atfpe
Palms Hotel. So she plugs a specific kindof
lube once in a while or includes the phrase
"Fora good time, Roxy insists on Acme
brand edible lingerie" in every column, but

that's not compromising ber integrity,
right? There's nothing wrong with "sell
ing out" it it means you have a roof over
your head and a tanned, toned body un
derneath you. Or is there?
For one who isn't connected to the In
dustry like this sex goddess, there are still

infinite possibilities for selling out. For ex
ample, you could stop writing decent lyrics
and begin marketing yourselves to 14-year
old girls, trading musicianship for the
chance to see barely pubescent breasts.
Those cutesy boys of Blink 182 have made a
career out of selling out.

There are dozens of other similar exam
ples, many of them related to MTV's
"TRL." But for those looking for some

thing less explicitly evil, 1 recommend

using the search engine Google to do
a search of "sellout." The top re

sult sends you to a site with

resources for "Hu
manities PhDs

considering careers beyond the university."
A little disconcerting for English and Histo
ry majors, to be sure. Roxy's pretty sure a
few of those careers include "Escort who
specializes in Shakespearean and Renais
sance-era fetishes" and "Literate gigolo, ex
pert on postmodern poetry and French Al
giers." Of course, the
irony

the name isn't lost, but you know there are
highly-educated people turning tricks out
there to pay off massive student loans.
Freshmen, fre Roxy knows you've only
been on the farm fora few weeks, but you
are probably already agonizing over your
IHUM or Math 51 grades. Well, young
grasshoppers, try out this motto fora
change: "Rent your lips fora GER." One of
Roxy's colleagues recently coined it, and it
applies to all sorts of classes and TA's, be

cause we know from Craigslist personals
how horny grad students are. Even with

the recent revamping of the GER sys
tem, Roxy is positive you'll inflate

your grade (and some other things.

too) if you just open your mouth and
ask.

And why limit the term "sellout" to
purely monetary means? Like
Roxv, the term "sellout" is flexible.

Let me explain. Could your rela
tionship he a sellout? I don't mean
he pieks you up at eight and you're
on the clock till midnight. I mean.

are you dating someone you know
is an asshole, boring and has the

personality of mulch? But can you

overlook those things because he has a
nice car, a terrific ability to pay for din
ner and is absolutely fuckable when he

doesn't talk? Well you, too, might be sell
ing out.
Roxy isn't quitting her day job and sign
ing the dotted line quite yet. The year is

young, my dears, and until that
"offer you simply can't refuse"'

comes along, she's still free
lance. But if Acme lingerie

wants a sprightly vixen as

their spokeswoman.

well, we can do
lunch.
