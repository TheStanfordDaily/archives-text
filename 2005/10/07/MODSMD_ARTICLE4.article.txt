# Schwartz an unlikely hero
## Team's only non-Californian brings a different attitude 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In some ways, it's hard to envision junior Forrest Schwartz as
a member of the Stanford men's water polo team. It's even hard

er to envision him playing at
the two-meter mark, where
players do just anything
short of drowning their op
ponent to get position on
the ball. With an unimpos
ing build, a soft-spoken dis
position and a laidback atti
tude that only a childhood
in Hawaii could produce,
Schwartz just doesn't seem
to have the intense, fire
breathing killer instinct to
fit the part.
Nevertheless, here he is
â€” taking on some of the
toughest assignments in col
legiate water polo and play
ing a key role for the No. 3
Cardinal (7-2,1-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
as they pursue a win against
Pacific tomorrow and, more
importantly, their fifth
NCAA title game appear
ance in five years.
Given the fact that this
season is the first year
Schwartz has received regu
lar playing time, it might be
easy to overlook the threat
he poses in the pool. Top
ranked UCLA was certain
ly guilty of making this mis
take three weeks ago in
their semifinal matchup
against the Cardinal at the
Southern California Open
tournament.
The score stood at 8-7 in
favor of the Bruins with the
clock running down in the
fourth period. After earning
a six-on-five advantage with
enough time remaining for
one more offensive drive,
the Cardinal broke out on
the counterattack, desper
ately looking to pull even
with the Bruins any way
possible.
As the Cardinal moved
into the UCLA defensive
zone, it was Schwartz who
found himself open to take
the outlet pass from sopho
more goalie Sandy Hohen
er. The memory of what
happened next will not fade
from Schwartz's mind.
