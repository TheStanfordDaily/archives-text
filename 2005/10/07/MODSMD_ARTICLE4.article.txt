# Schwartz an unlikely hero
## Team's only non-Californian brings a different attitude 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In some ways, it's hard to envision junior Forrest Schwartz as
a member of the Stanford men's water polo team. It's even hard

er to envision him playing at
the two-meter mark, where
players do just anything
short of drowning their op
ponent to get position on
the ball. With an unimpos
ing build, a soft-spoken dis
position and a laidback atti
tude that only a childhood
in Hawaii could produce,
Schwartz just doesn't seem
to have the intense, fire
breathing killer instinct to
fit the part.
Nevertheless, here he is
— taking on some of the
toughest assignments in col
legiate water polo and play
ing a key role for the No. 3
Cardinal (7-2,1-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
as they pursue a win against
Pacific tomorrow and, more
importantly, their fifth
NCAA title game appear
ance in five years.
Given the fact that this
season is the first year
Schwartz has received regu
lar playing time, it might be
easy to overlook the threat
he poses in the pool. Top
ranked UCLA was certain
ly guilty of making this mis
take three weeks ago in
their semifinal matchup
against the Cardinal at the
Southern California Open
tournament.
The score stood at 8-7 in
favor of the Bruins with the
clock running down in the
fourth period. After earning
a six-on-five advantage with
enough time remaining for
one more offensive drive,
the Cardinal broke out on
the counterattack, desper
ately looking to pull even
with the Bruins any way
possible.
As the Cardinal moved
into the UCLA defensive
zone, it was Schwartz who
found himself open to take
the outlet pass from sopho
more goalie Sandy Hohen
er. The memory of what
happened next will not fade
from Schwartz's mind.

"We were coming down on the counterattack, hut [UCLA
defenders] were guarding [senior] Peter [Varellas], [senior]


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior Forrest Schwartz scored
the game tying goal against
then No. 1 UCLA to send the
match into overtime.
Thomas [Hopkins] and [freshman]
Will [Hindle-Katel]," Schwartz said.
"I was looking for them, but 1 real
ized with five seconds left that it was
going to be me."
Faking Bruins' goalie Will
Didinger out of position, Schwartz
sent up a lob that floated into the
back of the cage and sent the then-
No. 4 Cardinal into overtime against
the defending national champions.
Two periods and four and a half min
utes of sudden-death later, the Car
dinal walked away with the win.
"It was definitely the highlight of
my athletic life," Schwartz said, in
reference to the improbable role he
played against the Bruins. "I
dropped a double fist-pump, 1 was
pointing to the crowd—just ab
solutely going nuts."
But according to Schwartz, his
fleeting moment of emotional out
burst was completely inconsistent
with the perspective he tries to main

tain.
"I didn't mean to do it,"he said.
"My coach in high school always said
to act like I'd done it before whenev
er I scored a goal. [So] once I realized
what I was doing, I felt kind of em
barrassed by it."
Indeed, a more subdued reaction
might have been exactly what
Schwartz's teammates expected.
Born and raised on the island of
Oahu, Schwartz played and starred
at athletic powerhouse Punahou
School before coming to the Farm.
He carries with him today the same
easygoing Hawaiian spirit that he
carried when he first showed up at
Avery Aquatic Center two years ago.
As the only non-Californian
member on this year's squad,
Schwartz stands out from everyone
else — and his teammates won't let
him forget it.
"A lot of times they'll joke that I
run on 'Hawaii-time,'" said
Schwartz, perceived by his team
mates to be one of the most relaxed
people on the squad. "They even ac
cuse me of being too slow on the
transition — their nickname for me
would probably be 'Schwarzz,' with a

couple of z's tacked on at the end."
Varellas and junior goalie Beau
Stockstill, one of Schwartz's room
mates this year in Kappa Alpha, had
similar evaluations of their island
teammate's hang-loose approach to
everything in life.
"We joke about him because it
kind of seems like he carries this
Hawaiian attitude that things will get
done when they get done, sort of in
their own time," Varellas said. "It
definitely sort of seems like his heart
beats at a different rate."
"He's always complaining about
morning workouts and how painful
they are," Stockstill added. "Coming
from Hawaii, he probably never had
a cold pool to dive into in the morn
ings."
But beneath all the joking criti
cism lies a strong bond between
Schwartz and his teammates, which
has made the junior's experience
here at Stanford everything he
hoped it would be.
"[We've] talked about [how] it
would be really hard to imagine
[ourselves] playing at any school but
here," Schwartz said. "There's really
no other 15 guys I'd want to be hang

ing out with."
"Stanford's a much better ap
proximation of Hawaii than any
other place," he added.
So even though nothing can truly
compare to his home in the Pacific,
Schwartz has most likely come as
close to finding paradise away from
the islands as he ever will — and for
the easygoing Hawaiian, that's all he
needs.
Schwartz and the No. 3 Cardinal
travel to Stockton on Saturday to
take on No. 10 Pacific, whom they
beat 14-4 on Sept. 30, and return to
face the alumni on Sunday at 11 a.m.
