# No. 19 Stanford welcomes WSU, UW in Pac-10 openers
## 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 19 Stanford women's soc
cer team is just playing its first con
ference tilt this weekend, but that
hasn't prevented the team from eye
ing the league title already. Stanford
(6-3-1) is scheduled to play host to
Washington State (7-3-1) and Wash
ington (0-8-3) as the Pacific-10 Con
ference season gets underway today.
The Cardinal kick off the weekend
with a match against the Cougars
tonight before facing the Huskies on
Sunday.
Stanford begins its conference
play after capturing two wins and
claiming the Stanford Nike Invita
tional title last weekend. The Cardi

nal are currently on a three game
win-streak, including a prominent
victory over No. 5 Santa Clara, which
moved them back into the NSCAA
rankings this week. Sophomore mid
fielder / defender Lizzy George, who
scored last weekend, feels that the
team's recent success has established
a strong feeling of confidence among
the players.
"The win on Friday [over Santa
Clara] has really boosted our confi
dence," George said. "I think the
team is ready and looking forward to
overcoming the challenges of the
Pac-10 and [hopefully] will come out
with the title."
The Cardinal enter their match
against the Cougars with a distinct
11-2-1 edge in previous meetings.
However, Washington State could
still be riding high after scoring two
victories last weekend, beating San
Francisco,4-0. and Montana. 2-1 .The
Cougars sophomore goalie Brynn
Bemis presents a difficult obstacle
for the Cardinal attack to overcome,
as she leads the conference in
shutouts per game this season.
"Washington State is a strong
side," Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe noted. "We have great heading
ability so we need to work on the
quality of our crossing, so we get
more opportunities."
Washington begins its conference
play with California today, before its
matchup against the Cardinal on
Sunday. The Huskies suffered a loss
to No. 2 Portland last weekend be
fore coming back to draw 2-2 with
San Francisco in double overtime.
The draw marked the end of a seven
match losing streak for Washington,
who is winless this season. Despite
Washington's disappointing per
formance inn on-con fere nee games,
Raticliffe is still cautious and does
not underestimate the Huskies.

"Washington has had a rough
time in the regular season," Ratcliffe
said. "Now that they're going into
Pac-10 play, they [are] going to put a
lot of effort into it."
Despite an injury to this season's
top scorer, senior Leah Tapscott,
Stanford still has a whole host of op
tions to look to for goals. Sophomore
captain Rachel Buehler asserted her
return to the team with authority
after being named Pac-10 Player of
the Week for Sept.27-Oct. 3.
Buehler, who missed last season
playing for the U.S. under-19 team,
scored twice over the weekend â€”
including the game-winner against
Santa Clara.
Prior to the start of the season,
the Pac-10 coaches voted Stanford
to finish fourth overall, but the
squad received one vote for first
place. And as the team appears to be
going from strength to strength as
the season continues, Ratcliffe is
confident the Cardinal still have
more to offer.
"I still think we have a way to go,"
Ratcliffe said. "We're still a young
team and we're still getting better
and better each game. All the teams
in the Pac-10 are strong but we're
hoping to win Pac-10 or finish very
high."
Today's and Sunday's matches
are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. and
1 p.m., respectively.
