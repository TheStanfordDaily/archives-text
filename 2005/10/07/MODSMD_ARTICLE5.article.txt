### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 19 Stanford women's soc
cer team is just playing its first con
ference tilt this weekend, but that
hasn't prevented the team from eye
ing the league title already. Stanford
(6-3-1) is scheduled to play host to
Washington State (7-3-1) and Wash
ington (0-8-3) as the Pacific-10 Con
ference season gets underway today.
The Cardinal kick off the weekend
with a match against the Cougars
tonight before facing the Huskies on
Sunday.
Stanford begins its conference
play after capturing two wins and
claiming the Stanford Nike Invita
tional title last weekend. The Cardi

nal are currently on a three game
win-streak, including a prominent
victory over No. 5 Santa Clara, which
moved them back into the NSCAA
rankings this week. Sophomore mid
fielder / defender Lizzy George, who
scored last weekend, feels that the
team's recent success has established
a strong feeling of confidence among
the players.
"The win on Friday [over Santa
Clara] has really boosted our confi
dence," George said. "I think the
team is ready and looking forward to
overcoming the challenges of the
Pac-10 and [hopefully] will come out
with the title."
