# Men look for revenge against Bears
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Members of Stanford men's soccer (3-5-
2, 0-1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) left a sun
baked Maloney Field after a long Wednes
day afternoon practice — not to relax in
their rooms or take a nap — but to hit the
weights. Even the team's newcomers did
not have to scrape deep for the motivation
to grind out a few extra reps as the reward
for their toil is in sight — a Saturday night
home showdown with archrival No. 15 Cal
ifornia (7-2-1.0-2-0).
The Cardinal are hoping that the work
in the weight room and on the track will
give them an upper hand when they take
the field at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
"We stepped up big this year athletical
ly, which is where I thought they beat us last
year," sophomore midfielder Kyle Hency
said. "I think this year we match up better
than we did in the past, so if we just play our

game and come out hard, hopefully we can
come out ahead and get a good crowd out
there."
Along with conditioning, Stanford has
spent a large portion of this season's prac
tices working on attacking as a team and
scoring goals. Extended sessions around
the net have not only refined the skill of
Stanford's attack, but also strengthened its
goalkeeping core, which could pay divi
dends soon.
"I don't remember the last time 1 had to
make this many saves in a practice here at
Stanford," junior goalkeeper Andrew Kar
tunen said. "It's nice because it will help in
crease scoring and also prepare myself to
come up with the big save that could be the
difference between winning and losing a
match."

two-game slide — their only two losses of

the season — and are hungry fora
chance to climb up the conference
ladder.
"Pac-10 games are always huge,
but with Cal it is even bigger, espe
cially because they beat us last year
in the game we had to win to make
the playoffs," junior midfielder
Galen Thompson said. "This is one of
those games that makes college soc
cer great; Saturday night, two teams
that need a win and are always out
for blood anyway. It is perfect."
Thompson referred to a 3-2 over
time thriller, which effectively elimi
nated the Cardinal from postseason
contention. Maloney Field played
host to a come-from-behind 2-2 tie in
the teams' first match, which was one
of the most exciting of 2004. The
squads are once again evenly
matched and are likely headed for
more tight contests. The Cardinal
players feel fan support could make

the difference.
"Our fans are huge with the
stands right on the field — the crowd
noise makes a big difference,"
Thompson said. "Nothing gives the
game that extra buzz like a big
crowd, and our fans have always
been the best for getting in the other
guy's heads."
Unique to this weekend's game is
that Cal has played many times on
Maloney Field this year — twice this
year at the Nike Stanford Invitation
al, to the point where the cross-Bay
rival knows Stanford's turf nearly as
well as the Cardinal do.
"I think it'll be kind of remark
able in that it won't be a very re
markable environment for either
team," Stanford head coach Bret
Simon said. "They've been here
many times so I don't think they'll be
thrown off their game if the crowd is
loud, but I'd like to find out."
The Bears are predominately a
passing- and possession-oriented
team with a dynamic scorer in senior
forward Calen Carr — and since
Stanford is not known as a counter
attack team, success may depend not

only on athleticism but on each
team's ability to control the ball.
"The nice thing about such a big
rivalry is that we actually do know a
lot about Cal's team," Kartunen said.
"Cal's always an organized team in
the back, and they always show a lot
of pace up top. We'll have to look out
for Calen Carr up top because he's
shown that he is a scoring threat with
speed and good positioning. We've
also got to be cautious about giving
up free kicks because they've always
been dangerous on corners and free
kicks around the box."
The Cardinal also looks to com
bine through the middle of the field
and get the ball wide to break down
Cal's defense.
Tactics aside, this match comes
down to pride and whichever team
channels the emotion of the rivalry,
which has so far fueled their prepa
rations, most effectively on the field.
In that respect, the Cardinal are con
fident.
"They need to worry about how
they are going to match our intensi
ty,"Thompson said. "We don't let Cal
set the bar in anything."

the season — and are hungry fora
chance to climb up the conference
ladder.
"Pac-10 games are always huge,
but with Cal it is even bigger, espe
cially because they beat us last year
in the game we had to win to make
the playoffs," junior midfielder
Galen Thompson said. "This is one of
those games that makes college soc
cer great; Saturday night, two teams
that need a win and are always out
for blood anyway. It is perfect."
Thompson referred to a 3-2 over
time thriller, which effectively elimi
nated the Cardinal from postseason
contention. Maloney Field played
host to a come-from-behind 2-2 tie in
the teams' first match, which was one
of the most exciting of 2004. The
squads are once again evenly
matched and are likely headed for
more tight contests. The Cardinal
players feel fan support could make

the difference.
"Our fans are huge with the
stands right on the field — the crowd
noise makes a big difference,"
Thompson said. "Nothing gives the
game that extra buzz like a big
crowd, and our fans have always
been the best for getting in the other
guy's heads."
Unique to this weekend's game is
that Cal has played many times on
Maloney Field this year — twice this
year at the Nike Stanford Invitation
al, to the point where the cross-Bay
rival knows Stanford's turf nearly as
well as the Cardinal do.
"I think it'll be kind of remark
able in that it won't be a very re
markable environment for either
team," Stanford head coach Bret
Simon said. "They've been here
many times so I don't think they'll be
thrown off their game if the crowd is
loud, but I'd like to find out."
The Bears are predominately a
passing- and possession-oriented
team with a dynamic scorer in senior
forward Calen Carr — and since
Stanford is not known as a counter
attack team, success may depend not

only on athleticism but on each
team's ability to control the ball.
"The nice thing about such a big
rivalry is that we actually do know a
lot about Cal's team," Kartunen said.
"Cal's always an organized team in
the back, and they always show a lot
of pace up top. We'll have to look out
for Calen Carr up top because he's
shown that he is a scoring threat with
speed and good positioning. We've
also got to be cautious about giving
up free kicks because they've always
been dangerous on corners and free
kicks around the box."
The Cardinal also looks to com
bine through the middle of the field
and get the ball wide to break down
Cal's defense.
Tactics aside, this match comes
down to pride and whichever team
channels the emotion of the rivalry,
which has so far fueled their prepa
rations, most effectively on the field.
In that respect, the Cardinal are con
fident.
"They need to worry about how
they are going to match our intensi
ty,"Thompson said. "We don't let Cal
set the bar in anything."
Members of Stanford men's soccer (3-5-
2, 0-1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) left a sun
baked Maloney Field after a long Wednes
day afternoon practice — not to relax in
their rooms or take a nap — but to hit the
weights. Even the team's newcomers did
not have to scrape deep for the motivation
to grind out a few extra reps as the reward
for their toil is in sight — a Saturday night
home showdown with archrival No. 15 Cal
ifornia (7-2-1.0-2-0).
The Cardinal are hoping that the work
in the weight room and on the track will
give them an upper hand when they take
the field at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
"We stepped up big this year athletical
ly, which is where I thought they beat us last
year," sophomore midfielder Kyle Hency
said. "I think this year we match up better
than we did in the past, so if we just play our

game and come out hard, hopefully we can
come out ahead and get a good crowd out
there."
Along with conditioning, Stanford has
spent a large portion of this season's prac
tices working on attacking as a team and
scoring goals. Extended sessions around
the net have not only refined the skill of
Stanford's attack, but also strengthened its
goalkeeping core, which could pay divi
dends soon.
"I don't remember the last time 1 had to
make this many saves in a practice here at
Stanford," junior goalkeeper Andrew Kar
tunen said. "It's nice because it will help in
crease scoring and also prepare myself to
come up with the big save that could be the
difference between winning and losing a
match."
