# Men look for revenge against Bears

### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Members of Stanford men's soccer (3-5-
2, 0-1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) left a sun
baked Maloney Field after a long Wednes
day afternoon practice — not to relax in
their rooms or take a nap — but to hit the
weights. Even the team's newcomers did
not have to scrape deep for the motivation
to grind out a few extra reps as the reward
for their toil is in sight — a Saturday night
home showdown with archrival No. 15 Cal
ifornia (7-2-1.0-2-0).
The Cardinal are hoping that the work
in the weight room and on the track will
give them an upper hand when they take
the field at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
"We stepped up big this year athletical
ly, which is where I thought they beat us last
year," sophomore midfielder Kyle Hency
said. "I think this year we match up better
than we did in the past, so if we just play our

game and come out hard, hopefully we can
come out ahead and get a good crowd out
there."
Along with conditioning, Stanford has
spent a large portion of this season's prac
tices working on attacking as a team and
scoring goals. Extended sessions around
the net have not only refined the skill of
Stanford's attack, but also strengthened its
goalkeeping core, which could pay divi
dends soon.
"I don't remember the last time 1 had to
make this many saves in a practice here at
Stanford," junior goalkeeper Andrew Kar
tunen said. "It's nice because it will help in
crease scoring and also prepare myself to
come up with the big save that could be the
difference between winning and losing a
match."
The Golden Bears enter the contest on a
two-game slide — their only two losses of
