### JUAN CARLOS LLORCA ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) â€” Res
cuers pulled at least 40 more bodies
from a muddy landslide in Guatemala
yesterday as the death toll from five
days of storms in Central America and
Mexico jumped to more than 200.
Crews unearth the remains of the vil
lages from the avalanche in Solola, a
town near Lake Atitlan, about 60 miles
west of the capital, Guatemala City. But
the toll could rise amid fears that as
many as 150 people are still buried at
the site.
"We took out 40 to 45 bodies today,"
said Pedro Mendoza, 25, one of numer
ous area residents participating in the
recovery. "The landslide was Wednes
day but because the roads are blocked,
no one can get through to help us."
Disaster agency spokesman Benedic
to Giron said the Solola governor's of
fice confirmed that at least 40 more bod
ies were recovered.
Five days of bad weather, exacerbat
ed by Hurricane Stan sweeping ashore
on Tuesday, have contributed to the mis
ery in the region.
The recovery of the bodies pushed the
death toll in the entire region to 211 .The
figure includes 14 people killed earlier
this week in Nicaragua, Honduras and
Costa Rica, and 13 people who died in
three Mexican states, 65 in El Salvador
with the remainder in Guatemala.
For the first time since the weekend,
the weather cleared Thursday and al

lowed Guatemala President Oscar
Berger to fly over devastated areas and
evaluate damage.
He declared a state of emergency as
rescuers in Solola reported that two
other villages had been buried by land
slides, including Las Giraldas, 55 miles
west of Guatemala City. More than a
dozen people there were digging out
houses buried when a second hillside
collapsed.
In Quetzaltenango, Guatemala's sec
ond-most important city about 125
miles west of the capital, floodwaters

rose 6 1/2 feet high,destroying hundreds
of homes, businesses and public build
ings, firefighters said.
More than 24,000 people from 270
communities took refuge in shelters
throughout Guatemala, but they were
suffering from the cold and a lack of
food and water, according to radio re
ports. Quetzaltenango residents report
ed similar conditions.
"It was complicated arriving with new
shipments of food" because of the bad
weather, said Agriculture Minister Al
varo Aguilar. "Today, we are making an

effort" to reach the areas by air.
Guatemalan rescue workers also
were trying to restore access to 300
roads blocked by fallen trees, flooding
and landslides.
In El Salvador, where 65 people were
killed, rescuers also stepped up aid
flights and flyovers as the sun emerged
from behind the clouds.
Officials said nearly 54,000 people
had been evacuated to 370 shelters
throughout the country, while nearly 80
percent of its roads had been affected by
the rains.
