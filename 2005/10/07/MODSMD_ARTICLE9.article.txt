## Cervical cancer vaccine found 
### LINDA A. JOHNSON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) â€” An experimental vaccine to prevent the most
common forms of cervical cancer proved 100 percent ef
fective in a two-year test on more than 10,000 girls and
women, drug maker Merck & Co. says.
Merck is hoping to win Food and Drug Administration
approval for the vaccine, Gardasil, and put it on the mar
ket as soon as late 2006. It would be the first vaccine to
prevent cervical cancer, a disease caused almost exclu
sively by a highly common sexually transmitted virus
called the human papilloma virus, or HPV.
Doctors expect the vaccine to be routinely offered to
girls -and boys, too, because they can spread the virus to
their partners - before they become sexually active,
though the practice is certain to run into opposition from
conservatives and religious groups.
"I see this as a phenomenal breakthrough," said Dr.
Gloria Bachmann, director of the Women's Health Insti
tute at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New
Brunswick, N.J.
Worldwide, cervical cancer is one of the most com
mon cancers among women. It kills nearly 300,000 a
year, including about 3,700 in the United States.
About 20 million Americans have some form of HPV,
which in addition to cervical cancer can cause painful
genital warts.
The genetically engineered vaccine prevents cer
vical cancer by blocking infection from the two
strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of all cases of
the disease.
The study included 10,559 sexually active women ages
16 to 26 in the United States and 12 other countries who
were not infected with either of the two virus strains,
called HPV 16 and 18. Half got three vaccine doses over
six months; half got dummy shots.
Among those still virus-free after the six months,
none of those who received the vaccine developed ei
ther cervical cancer or precancerous lesions during two
years of follow-up, compared with 21 of those who got
dummy shots.
"To have 100 percent efficacy is something that you
have very rarely," said Dr. Eliav Barr, Merck's head of
clinical development for the vaccine. "We're breaking
out the champagne."
