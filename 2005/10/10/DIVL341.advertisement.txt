It isn't always clear to people at first that they're right for
the D. E. Shaw group. Like the poet we hired to head an
automated block trading unit. Or the woman who designs
solar-powered race cars; we hired her to help launch a new
venture in computational chemistry. They didn't think of
themselves as "financial types," and neither did we. We
thought of them as people with extraordinary talent.
The D. E. Shaw group is a highly successful investment
and technology development firm with an international
reputation for financial innovation and technological
leadership. Since 1988 we've grown into a number of
closely related entities with approximately US Sl7 billion
in aggregate capital by hiring unusually smart people
from a wide range of backgrounds. A robotics guru. A

nationally ranked blackjack player. An operatic mezzo
soprano. And a lot of people who are just exceptionally
strong in CS, EE, math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis,
software development, information technology, computer
istry, accounting, finance, and trading. We're looking for
creative but pragmatic people: articulate, curious, and
driven. Our working environment is intense but surprisingly
casual. We provide unusual opportunities for growth. And
we compensate extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will be attending the
Fall Career Fair on October 11 from 11:00 am
to 3:00 pm outside at White Plaza. We will
also host an information session on Monday,
October 10 at 6:00 pm in the Packard EE
Building, Room 202. On-campus interviews
will take place October 31. To apply for an
interview, log on to http://cardinalrecruiting.
stanford.edu/intent2oo3/. If this isn't pos
sible, please send a resume and cover letter
stating your CPA and standardized test scores,
broken down by section where applicable, to
jobs@deshaw.com. All applications must be
received by October 12.
Members of the D. Â£ Shaw group do not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital
