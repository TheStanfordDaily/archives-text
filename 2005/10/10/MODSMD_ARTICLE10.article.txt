## Would you like some sprinkles with that DTR? 
### 
Isat down to lunch the other day in the
midst of a fascinating conversation
among several residents in my house.
They were discussing something they
termed the "Coldstone Effect" — that is,
when a person decides to break the unan
ticipated news that they no longer want to
see the other person over a delicious
dessert at Coldstone Creamery (I've also
heard this called the "one-day-180" — the
name comes from the fact that it appears
the individual has done a complete 180
with their affection over the course of a
single day). A large number of women at
the table had experienced this situation
first-hand, which made me wonder if this
was a strange coincidence or some kind of
sick trend.
My immediate reaction was to call every
man who had ever wronged me and
scream. "WHERE THE HELL IS MY
ICE CREAM, YOU HEARTLESS BAS
TARD?!" Some were confused, but most
were just frightened. One of them cried.
I have yet to receive confirmation as to
whether or not "Let's go get Coldstone" is
code for"I am going to mash your heart
into a pulp on a frigid slab of marble." But
the discussion made me think about how
our generation approaches difficult con
versations with the ones we love ... or
stopped loving several days ago.
TTiere is perhaps no acronym in the
Stanford student vocabulary more dread
ed than "DTR." For those of you who
have successfully avoided social interac
tion since puberty, DTR refers to a con
versation where you must "Define The
Relationship" between yourself and a sig
nificant other. These interactions are by
nature somewhat uncomfortable, so most
people think about them in the same way
they think about colonoscopies — a nec
essary evil, but one that should be avoided
at all costs.
DTRs embody everything that Stanford
students hate about dating — the vulnera
bility, the awkwardness and the possibility
of rejection. It's no wonder then that we
tend to leave this sort of discussion for "ter
minating the intimacy"-type situations,
such as after hookups or when a long-term
relationship begins to turn sour.
But the reality is that a lot of heartache
could be avoided if we simply learned how
to communicate with our quasi-significant
others on a regular basis, and not only when
things go awry. Imagine saying something
along these lines to that hottie you occa
sionally take to the movies — "I really like
hanging out with you casually like this; I'm
not ready to take things to the next level
but I just want you to know that I enjoy
your company."
Okay,so that sounds really corny,but it's
so much better than Hottie thinking you're
way more into him or her than you actual
ly are and then getting really confused
when you don't feel comfortable express
ing the same level of intimacy or talking
about upping the commitment. With said
corny statement you a) compliment Hottie,
which gets you major points b) successfully
communicate your feelings in a straightfor
ward manner and c) avoid the Coldstone
Effect.
This is not to say that every aspect of our
non-platonic interactions must be quanti
fied into discrete categories with tidy
names and clean boundaries. Much of the
thrill of the chase comes from that which is
unknown, from playing a largely arbitrary
but completely necessary game that could
dissolve in disaster one moment as easily as
it could morph into some sort of euphoric
Utopia the next.
I think the answer lies in adjusting the
working definition of a DTR. As opposed
to thinking about DTRs in terms of tying a
relationship down to a specific label with
all its associated connotations, think about
the DTR as a forum for communication. In
other words, we need to be less concerned
about asking,"What is the name for what is
going on between us. and am I comfortable
with that name?" and more routinely won
der, "Am I effectively expressing how I'm
feeling about this relationship right now?"
As for me, I've got to DTR with some
Sinless Sweet Cream and Butterfinger beat
into submission by a Paly overachiever.
And I can tell you that what me and my
Sweet Cream have is nothing short of true
love.
