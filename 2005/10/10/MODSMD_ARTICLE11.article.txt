"Each of us has his or her own story to tell," says soph
omore Michele Goldman, referring to the victims of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and their families.
Last Friday in White Plaza,Goldman attempted to ex
pose the Stanford community to some of these stories in
an hour-long memorial she organized through the Foun
dation for Defense of Democracies, or FDD.
The FDD is a non-partisan organization whose Website
states that "terrorism-intentional violence directed against
non-combatants to achieve a political objective is always
wrong and should never be condoned."
FDD combats terrorism largely through educational
campaigns. Its Undergraduate Fellowship program gives
students the chance to inform their peers about terrorism
and its threat to the innocent through a variety of stu
dent-run events such as documentary film screenings
and discussion groups.
College undergraduates interested in the fellowship
must be entering their sophomore, junior or senior years
and must be on-campus for the full year, according to the
Web site. A record of academic excellence is also crucial.
Once accepted, the students participate in a two-week
summer program in Tel Aviv that includes lectures from
politicians, diplomats and military officials.
"[While in Tel Aviv], I attended graduate-level semi

nars on terrorism and counterterrorism," Goldman says.
"There were lectures by Boaz Ganor, a distinguished Is
raeli expert on terrorism, members of the Israeli intelli
gence group Mossad and former military generals."
Goldman and her peers also met with members of the
underground counterterrorist movement and convicted
terrorists in prison, she adds.
When the fellows return to their college campuses, they
must organize at least five pro-democracy anti-terror
events, one of which must be a Sept. 11 memorial.
But these obligations were not Goldman's sole moti
vation for holding the event.
"Michele went out of her way to make this event a
success," notes sophomore Marissa Cramer, a friend of
Goldman. "She really connects and empathizes with
other people. As you could tell during her speech at the
ceremony, she's just a sincere person."
Sophomore Di Dang echoes this sentiment.
"There was clearly a lot of love and effort put into this
event,"she remarks."lt was a very well-assembled group
of speakers and performers. 1 just think it was everything
we could've asked for."
Recently, anything having to do with terrorism or
Sept. 11 has had the potential to become politically
charged. Yet the event transcended partisanship with its
inclusion of both the President of the Stanford Republi
cans, junior Donald Stevens, and Vice President of the

Stanford Democrats, sophomore Gabe Winant.
"1 wanted to be as apolitical as possible," Goldman ex
plains. "People always worry that if an event is associat
ed with an institute against terrorism, it's going to be an
event run by a conservative, right-wing organization, but
that's simply not true. Over the summer, we always got
lectures from both sides of the political spectrum. The
fact that terrorism poses a global threat to humankind is
something we could all agree upon."
Through Friday's memorial, Goldman says she also
wanted to bring the reality of terrorist attacks to the
sometimes sheltered Stanford community.
"I feel that so many students are isolated from acts of
terrorism, yet this is such a pivotal topic and a threat to
all of our lives," Goldman says."The reason the program
was held in Israel was because Israel is a case-study of
how democracies fight terrorism. I met with people
whose lives have been ruined because of terrorism and it
awakened me."
And Mitchell adds that "Sept. 11 continues to happen
daily for too many people in too many places."
Goldman is one of the first fellows from the West
Coast, and she says she learned about the FDD through
the Stanford Israeli Alliance.
This winter. Goldman plans to attend a four-day con
ference in Washington, D.C., with the FDD's Undergrad
uate Fellowship program. â€¢
