In North Korea, people's key to survival
is learning to open their throats just wide
enough to slip a live salamander down he
fore it releases its poison. In North Korea,
people's flesh withers in the most different
ways imaginable — it is burnt, hit, frozen,
gashed by mud slings from caving mines. In
North Korea, living is a luxury.
Though the rest of the world lives in
2005, North Korea today seems stuck in Or
well's "1984." When a severe economic de
pression in 1993 led to a life-threatening
dearth of food supply, many citizens fled to
neighboring China in search of nourish
ment. Scores of these escapees were cap
tured, however, and many were either sent
to concentration camps or faced the not-so
lesser evil of fatal starvation.
But only recently has the humanitarian
crisis of North Korea drawn extensive pub
lic and political attention — in the past
decade, a pool of successful defectors have
shared haunting stories of the political gu
lags and inhumane systems reminiscent of
the Nazi regime.
This summer, Kang-Cheol Hwan. defec
tor and author of "The Aquariums of
Pyeongyang," was invited by President
George W. Bush to help make hunianitari
anism the top priority of his political agenda
towards North Korea. "People before poli
tics" has finally become North Korea's new
political mantra.
The fledgling Stanford organization NK
Focus heralds the same message. The year
old group has hosted a stream of key events
that have attracted not only Koreans, but
also students of all backgrounds who are
united by their universal empathy for hu
manitarian issues.
NK Focus originally began as the Stan
ford Committee for North Korean Human
Rights, which convened only for one week in
May. Last year, seniors Anna Cho and Glo
ria Kim built this organization into a year
round campaign to promote consciousness
about North Korea's plight.
Kim says she was worried that last year's

successful passing of the North Korean
Human Rights Act would result in political
complacency.
"I was afraid that because something was
done, people would inversely lose interest,"
she explains."Making NK Focus a year-long
project would sustain continuous interest in
the issue."
While the North Korean Human Rights
Act included several provisions such as au
thorizing financial aid to help North Korean
refugees and granting a United Nations

envoy position for North Korean human
rights, securing human rights in the North
still has a long political road ahead.
By inviting North Korean defector Soon
Ok Lee to its annual NK Human Rights
Week display in White Plan, NK FoCUS
hopes to establish a sturdy foundation of
support within the Stanford community.
Soomin Kim. a junior who currently
spearheads NK Focus,says education is cru
cial to the group's mission.
"Our first and primary goal is to increase

awareness of the problem," she says."For
too long, North Korea has played its politi
cal card of the nuclear dilemma. People are
dying, starving, receiving below-human
treatment in the political gulags and the
problem is that the rest of the world doesn't
know enough about it."
Nk Focus updates the public at weekly
Tuesday sessions with recent news from
North Korea, according to Soomin Kim.The
group's Web site also offers visitors 24-hour
access to a forum where students can read,
post and converse. Through direct interac
tion with the community, the group aims to
bring down human rights from a political
pedestal and make it a more tangible issu.
The second branch of the group's mission
statement is political activism. While the
word ctivism may produce images of rau
cous rallies and massive demonstrations,
NK Focus members hold a different view.
"We're a student community," Gloria
Kim says. "Hence we want to promote a
form of activism that is accessible to stu
dents."
Currently, NK Focus is drafting a letter to
the Chinese Embassy in San Francisco, urg
ing the Chinese government to grant asylum
to North Korean refugees in China. The let
ter disputes interpretation of a law passed in
1951 at the UN Convention on Refugee Sta
tus. claiming that North Korean defectors
have due rights as political refugees. Be
cause China does not grant defectors legiti
mate refugee status, defectors are returned
to North Korea and immediately sentenced
to concentration camps or other forms of
punishment.
"Hopefully, we can get many of the facul
ty and other human rights groups on campus
to support it as well." Soomin Kim says.
"We're doing a lot of research to refine it."
Research, however, is by no means the
only element that has led to NK Focus's rapid
growth. After missing the ASSU funds dead
line first quarter, the group's officers used
their personal money to host initial events.
Fortunately. NK Focus' keynote speaker,
NK Dave, an activist from the NGO NK
Missions, spoke for free.
