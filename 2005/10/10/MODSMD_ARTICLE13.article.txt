## Editorial University needs to budget for construction delays 
### 
Today marks the official opening of
Stanford's newest athletic facilii), the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center.
The complex features nearly a dozen new
treadmills, ellipticals and stationary hikes, a
weight room with a complete line of anaero
bic equipment, a large mat room and squash
courts — significantly expanding Stanford's
athletic equipment offerings. Fora school
with the top Division-I athletic program 11
years running, the new facility is well-de
served.
Hie center also frees up space in Roble
C3ym so that it may be converted into "Roble
Studios," a performing arts complex for the
Drama Department.Though this renovation
will take time, Roble Studios will eventually
house costume shops, stage shops, theaters
and practice studios for rehearsals.
I lowever. due to last minute work and a
fire inspection that delayed the opening of
the Recreation Center, the Drama Depart
ment has yet to move into the space. In addi
tion. many recreation classes scheduled to
meet in Arrillaga Family Recreation Center
were forced to temporarily relocate to
Roble Gym, resulting in confusion on the
first day of classes, since both Axess and the
Time Schedule listed the meeting place for
classes incorrectly. Fortunately,and to every
one's credit, students, faculty and the Drama
and Athletics Departments were accommo
dating of the last-minute changes.
It's generally a given that most construc
tion projects run behind schedule. One
miraculous exception was Maples Pavilion,
lliat renovation finished ahead of time, re
sulting in unnecessarily-relocated basketball
games at Santa Clara University.
Fhat. however, is certainly an exception,
rather than a rule. According to Sherry
I'ostlnimus. assistant athletic director, the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center was
scheduled to open on Sept. 26. just in time
for activities classes to begin meeting in the
new facility. That schedule allowed for no
wiggle room for last minute delays, despite
the fact that such wiggle room is very often

needed when dealing with construction proj
ects.
In this case. Stanford was able to accom
modate the delay and relocate meeting
places. However, the University is anticipat
ing several large construction projects in the
next several years, and it would be wise to ac
knowledge in the construction schedule that
delays are a realistic part of the process.
While some projects — such as the con
version of Old Union into a student union
with meeting space for multi-faith organiza
tions and the ASSU — are not extremely
time-sensitive, others are.
The refurbishment of the Stanford Stadi
um is one such project.The University antic
ipates that construction will begin on the
Stadium immediately following the Notre
Dame game at the end of November. That
gives the project a little over nine months to
be completed if it is to be ready in time for
the 2006 football season, leaving very little
room for error,time delays or unforeseen
setbacks. And while, in the case of the Arril
laga Family Recreation Center, athletics
classes could be relocated to Roble Gym for
several weeks to accommodate the open
ing's postponement, Stanford football
games certainly cannot.
The Munger Graduate Residence is an
other pending project. The complex will
eventually house approximately 500 gradu
ate and professional students, while
Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls will
be converted into undergraduate housing.
These new residences will need to be open in
time for the beginning of the 2006-2007
school year, or both the graduate and under
graduate housing situations will be negative
ly impacted and the University will face a
housing crunch.
For now, Stanford students, faculty and
employees can enjoy the opening of a pre
miere collegiate recreational and athletic fa
cility. Yet for future projects, it would be pru
dent for the administration to anticipate that
most construction projects, like this one, are
likely to run behind schedule.

Today marks the official opening of
Stanford's newest athletic facilii), the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center.
The complex features nearly a dozen new
treadmills, ellipticals and stationary hikes, a
weight room with a complete line of anaero
bic equipment, a large mat room and squash
courts — significantly expanding Stanford's
athletic equipment offerings. Fora school
with the top Division-I athletic program 11
years running, the new facility is well-de
served.
Hie center also frees up space in Roble
C3ym so that it may be converted into "Roble
Studios," a performing arts complex for the
Drama Department.Though this renovation
will take time, Roble Studios will eventually
house costume shops, stage shops, theaters
and practice studios for rehearsals.
I lowever. due to last minute work and a
fire inspection that delayed the opening of
the Recreation Center, the Drama Depart
ment has yet to move into the space. In addi
tion. many recreation classes scheduled to
meet in Arrillaga Family Recreation Center
were forced to temporarily relocate to
Roble Gym, resulting in confusion on the
first day of classes, since both Axess and the
Time Schedule listed the meeting place for
classes incorrectly. Fortunately,and to every
one's credit, students, faculty and the Drama
and Athletics Departments were accommo
dating of the last-minute changes.
It's generally a given that most construc
tion projects run behind schedule. One
miraculous exception was Maples Pavilion,
lliat renovation finished ahead of time, re
sulting in unnecessarily-relocated basketball
games at Santa Clara University.
Fhat. however, is certainly an exception,
rather than a rule. According to Sherry
I'ostlnimus. assistant athletic director, the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center was
scheduled to open on Sept. 26. just in time
for activities classes to begin meeting in the
new facility. That schedule allowed for no
wiggle room for last minute delays, despite
the fact that such wiggle room is very often

needed when dealing with construction proj
ects.
In this case. Stanford was able to accom
modate the delay and relocate meeting
places. However, the University is anticipat
ing several large construction projects in the
next several years, and it would be wise to ac
knowledge in the construction schedule that
delays are a realistic part of the process.
While some projects — such as the con
version of Old Union into a student union
with meeting space for multi-faith organiza
tions and the ASSU — are not extremely
time-sensitive, others are.
The refurbishment of the Stanford Stadi
um is one such project.The University antic
ipates that construction will begin on the
Stadium immediately following the Notre
Dame game at the end of November. That
gives the project a little over nine months to
be completed if it is to be ready in time for
the 2006 football season, leaving very little
room for error,time delays or unforeseen
setbacks. And while, in the case of the Arril
laga Family Recreation Center, athletics
classes could be relocated to Roble Gym for
several weeks to accommodate the open
ing's postponement, Stanford football
games certainly cannot.
The Munger Graduate Residence is an
other pending project. The complex will
eventually house approximately 500 gradu
ate and professional students, while
Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls will
be converted into undergraduate housing.
These new residences will need to be open in
time for the beginning of the 2006-2007
school year, or both the graduate and under
graduate housing situations will be negative
ly impacted and the University will face a
housing crunch.
For now, Stanford students, faculty and
employees can enjoy the opening of a pre
miere collegiate recreational and athletic fa
cility. Yet for future projects, it would be pru
dent for the administration to anticipate that
most construction projects, like this one, are
likely to run behind schedule.
