# Ending the recruitment debate
## 
### 
After recent press on the subject, I'm
dismayed that Stanford students
have not taken a stronger stand. I've
seen the recruiters myself — they're always
wearing uniforms that are silly in this cli
mate, and they are more than a bit pushy.
There have been many times I've wished I
could replace their pamphlets with some
thing ridiculous — like good press for
ABC's "Commander-in-Chief."
Stanford students must take a stand
against a cappella recruitment on campus.
Stanford finds itself in an odd predicament.
By denying a cappella recruiters at Stan
ford. the University runs the risk of losing
valuable federal funding for the arts. On the
other hand, Stanford's commitment to
equal rights demands that a cappella groups
not be allowed on campus. A cappella
groups are clearly discriminatory:The good
ones are made up of men or women only —
representing sexual discrimination — and
only accept those who can sing and under
stand Western-style musical scales,obvious
ly discriminating against those who are
tone-deaf. Yes, the "Don't Ask. Don't Tell in
a Non-harmonized Manner" policy is very
disci iminatory.
I've been frustrated with the recent let
ters toThe Daily discussing this subject. Peo
ple fail to realize that although a cappella
groups are discriminatory by nature, there
are still those who want to participate. The
San I rancisco Chronicle recently reported
on the strong hold that a cappella groups
have on this campus. Some people even call
the a cappella phenomenon a "scene." If by
"scene" they mean "cult without the suicide
pact," then yes, it is a scene. Except Everyday
People, they have the pact.
Still, the University is dedicated to up
holding tolerance and equal opportunities
for all of its students. Many argue it is within
the University's rights to ban those organi
zations that discriminate. But recent inter
pretations of the Salmon Amendment, so
called because that is the smell Congress as
sociates with a cappella performances, have
stated that the federal government can deny
funding to universities that kick a cappella
recruiters off campus. Once again, the hawk
ish Republican government is forcing its art
friendly agenda down our throats.
Many universities have challenged this in
terpretation of the Salmon Amendment,and

people have wondered why Stanford has not
raised its angry fins in defiance. Even Yale,
(he President's alma mater, and historically
an a cappella mecca, has rallied to challenge
the Salmon Amendment. Many people are
pushing for Stanford to do the same.
If I can get personal fora second: I've
spent some considerable time in New Eng
land. I can say firsthand that a cappella
groups aren't just fringe scenes, they are
prevalent in the culture. A small liberal arts
college of about 2,000 students can have
more than ten separate a cappella groups. I
know it's hard to imagine you need that
many different versions of "Brown Eyed
Girl," but you could probably also wonder
why there are so many versions of CSI when
the same thing happens every damn episode.
Putting my feelings aside, I have a friend
who is a member of an a cappella group at
Bowdoin College called the Meddiebemp
sters. While it is discriminatory against
women (it is men only) and seems to target a
certain socioeconomic group that vacations
in the I lamptons, he finds that it is his niche.
And although I disagree with his decision to
join an a cappella group, and fear for his
safety in these dangerous times, I wish him
the best of luck on his recent tour.
Because those who choose to join a cap
pella are people too. While I personally be
lieve that this University should join other
universities' challenge of the Salmon
Amendment and therefore ban a cappella
recruiters on campus, 1 think we should also
pause and recognize that we are kicking off
a discriminatory body, and are not being dis
criminatory against singers themselves. Of
tentimes in these debates, we can lose sight
of what we really stand for: being politically
apathetic Frisbee hippies.

Holt's Harangue
After recent press on the subject, I'm
dismayed that Stanford students
have not taken a stronger stand. I've
seen the recruiters myself — they're always
wearing uniforms that are silly in this cli
mate, and they are more than a bit pushy.
There have been many times I've wished I
could replace their pamphlets with some
thing ridiculous — like good press for
ABC's "Commander-in-Chief."
Stanford students must take a stand
against a cappella recruitment on campus.
Stanford finds itself in an odd predicament.
By denying a cappella recruiters at Stan
ford. the University runs the risk of losing
valuable federal funding for the arts. On the
other hand, Stanford's commitment to
equal rights demands that a cappella groups
not be allowed on campus. A cappella
groups are clearly discriminatory:The good
ones are made up of men or women only —
representing sexual discrimination — and
only accept those who can sing and under
stand Western-style musical scales,obvious
ly discriminating against those who are
tone-deaf. Yes, the "Don't Ask. Don't Tell in
a Non-harmonized Manner" policy is very
disci iminatory.
I've been frustrated with the recent let
ters toThe Daily discussing this subject. Peo
ple fail to realize that although a cappella
groups are discriminatory by nature, there
are still those who want to participate. The
San I rancisco Chronicle recently reported
on the strong hold that a cappella groups
have on this campus. Some people even call
the a cappella phenomenon a "scene." If by
"scene" they mean "cult without the suicide
pact," then yes, it is a scene. Except Everyday
People, they have the pact.
Still, the University is dedicated to up
holding tolerance and equal opportunities
for all of its students. Many argue it is within
the University's rights to ban those organi
zations that discriminate. But recent inter
pretations of the Salmon Amendment, so
called because that is the smell Congress as
sociates with a cappella performances, have
stated that the federal government can deny
funding to universities that kick a cappella
recruiters off campus. Once again, the hawk
ish Republican government is forcing its art
friendly agenda down our throats.
Many universities have challenged this in
terpretation of the Salmon Amendment,and

people have wondered why Stanford has not
raised its angry fins in defiance. Even Yale,
(he President's alma mater, and historically
an a cappella mecca, has rallied to challenge
the Salmon Amendment. Many people are
pushing for Stanford to do the same.
If I can get personal fora second: I've
spent some considerable time in New Eng
land. I can say firsthand that a cappella
groups aren't just fringe scenes, they are
prevalent in the culture. A small liberal arts
college of about 2,000 students can have
more than ten separate a cappella groups. I
know it's hard to imagine you need that
many different versions of "Brown Eyed
Girl," but you could probably also wonder
why there are so many versions of CSI when
the same thing happens every damn episode.
Putting my feelings aside, I have a friend
who is a member of an a cappella group at
