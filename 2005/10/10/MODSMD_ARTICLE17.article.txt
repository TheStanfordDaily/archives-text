# Food and the body: A French girl's perspective
## 
### 
When I came to Stanford two years
ago from France — where I had
lived all my life — 1 expected to be
surprised by differences in the culture,
lifestyle and way of thinking. But I certainly
didn't think that I would encounter such dif
ferences in attitude towards food and the
body. What exactly do I mean?
Well, first of all, I was horrified to see more
than a few girls looking so frail and thin they
could have come from famine-stricken Dar
fur. I learned to spot them in the dining hall
and on campus: They're the ones who pile
heaps of salad and broccoli and nothing else
— except maybe a few tiny pieces of tofu —
on their plates, run around campus maniacal
ly at all hours of the day or night.rain or shine,
and make me wonder how they get through
the day without collapsing.
Then there are the people who go to the
gym religiously. Guys must be super-buff, girls
must be skinny and toned; those are the rules.
The idea is that only by shaping and re-shap
ing your body will you be attractive and sexy.
In a third category, there are the people
— women especially — who are completely
lost on matters of food and the body, and no
wonder. The American media, more than
any other media I know, associate desserts
and other so-called "unhealthy" foods with
guilt and sin: "Indulge in this guilty pleas
ure," chocolate cake ads allure us. A new diet

is invented every week: no carbs (I digress,
but when I first saw low-carb bread in a su
permarket — which, when you think about
it, is like low-protein chicken — and com
pared this ugly, tasteless, industrially-pro
duced mass to the real stuff, 1 almost cried),
"good" carbs, no fat, grapefruit only, leek
soup only, just to name a few. New dieting
books are constantly being published, weight
loss pills and other related medications
abound. The idea of exercising and eating in
moderation just hasn't caught on. No won
der: It doesn't sell.
The result is that a lot of Stanford stu
dents — again, women especially — feel
guilty when they eat "unhealthy" foods, so
they try to restrict their consumption. But
that only makes them want to binge on these
foods, and that's the surest way to gain
weight. Bingo, the media have won the battle
— they've made you gain weight and now
you'll probably buy weight-loss pills, or at

least a book on "Why French Women Don't
Get Fat." (The secret behind that phenome
non, by the way, is because they eat in mod
eration — which doesn't mean they deprive
themselves of cake, cheese, foie gras, etc. —
and exercise regularly — which doesn't
mean they run ten miles a day.)
Now the real question is, why do we, as
smart Stanford students, not see through all
this? Why do we adopt the behavior that ads
encourage us to adopt? I think it's because
we want to be accepted, loved and envied.
Because we know, consciously or uncon
sciously, that people will judge us on our
looks. In most Western countries, the rules
look something like this: Thin = has things
under control, sexy, active, dynamic; Over
weight = no willpower, lazy, undisciplined.
Exercising, paying attention to how you
look and eating in a way that will keep you
healthy are very good things, and I am by no
means saying that we should stop doing
them. But let's act in moderation — and
most of all, let's not promote the dangerous
standards the media are encouraging us to
unquestioningly embrace. Finally, let's re
member to judge people for who they are,
not what they look like.

If you think low-carb bread is best invention
since the cell phone, you can tell Laure about it
