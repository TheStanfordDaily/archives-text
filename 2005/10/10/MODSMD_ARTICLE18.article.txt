Alum extends congratulations to Stanford Racing Team
I would like to congratulate the Stanford Racing Team for their
success in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Grand
Challenge. In my opinion, the team's accomplishment is on par with
Charles Lindbergh flying over the Atlantic or Burt Rutan capturing
the X Prize. The team's car, Stanley, is the pioneer of automated and
computer-assisted vehicles that will one day he übiquitous in our
world. And, in the spirit of competition, 1 would like to say great job
beating Carnegie-Mellon and showing off the innovation of Stan
ford Engineering.

Intermission's "Jaws" coverage is extremely commendable
Thank God, Ryan Lampe has finally filled the biggest void in The
Daily's coverage. At last, there is an Intermission article about the
movie "Jaws" ("Jaws. Oct. 7) — the single greatest movie, ever. It has
great characters, great action, great direction. It is as close to flawless
as movies come. I don't know why the article was included, but no
issue of Intermission would be complete without "Jaws." zombies.

Asian jokes or a piece of broccoli lifting weights. Communists do
well too.

Sept. 11 Memorial proves students are tomorrow's leaders
I read the Oct. 7 article "9/11 memorial honors victims of at
tacks" with much interest and pride. Stanford not only provides a
great education of the intellect, it also provides a wonderful educa
tion of the heart. It is of paramount importance that Americans re
member the victims of atrocious terror attacks, and provide sup
port to their families. We must constantly remind the world that
human life has value and that terror accomplishes nothing in the
pursuit of justice.
The loss of innocent lives, be they of the Christian, Jewish. Mus
lim or other faiths, must be sanctified and remembered. I com
mend event organizer Michele Golabek-Goldman for her efforts
to fight terror and encourage remembrance. Once again, Stanford
students provide leadership in an increasingly complex and tragic
world.
