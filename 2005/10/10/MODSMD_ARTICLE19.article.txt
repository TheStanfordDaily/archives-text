### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Pullman, Wash. â€” Stanford football (2-2,1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) faced tall odds at Washington State (3-2,0-2
Pac-10).The Cardinal had not won in nearly a month and
traveled 700 miles to a noisy Martin Stadium as 13-point
underdogs. Further, Stanford had already lost many key
players to injury this young season, most recently star jun
ior linebacker Michael Okwo (ankle).
Nonetheless, senior quarterback Trent Edwards threw
for 257 yards and three scores in arguably the finest game
