## FOOTBALL Cardinal prevail on the field Stanford earns its first conference win in front of hostile Washington State crowd 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Pullman, Wash. — Stanford football (2-2,1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) faced tall odds at Washington State (3-2,0-2
Pac-10).The Cardinal had not won in nearly a month and
traveled 700 miles to a noisy Martin Stadium as 13-point
underdogs. Further, Stanford had already lost many key
players to injury this young season, most recently star jun
ior linebacker Michael Okwo (ankle).
Nonetheless, senior quarterback Trent Edwards threw
for 257 yards and three scores in arguably the finest game

of his career. In addition, a passing de
fense that had hemorrhaged yards in
previous games bent but did not
break, and junior cornerback Nick
Sanchez' interception with 32 seconds
remaining iced a 24-21 victory over an
injury-depleted Cougar squad.
"It was a great win," said senior
flanker Justin McCullum, who fin
ished the contest with 67 receiving
yards, including a 19-yard touchdown
reception in the third quarter. "All
sides of the ball —offensive, defensive
and special teams — played great. It
was great to have a real team win."
With only 4:01 to play and a 24-21
lead, Stanford needed to gain just two
or three first downs to run out the
clock and ice the victory. Edwards
picked up one first down on a 17-yard
scramble, part of a team-leading 92-
yard rushing performance, but senior
receiver Gerren Crochet could not
handle Edwards' pass on the ensuing
third down.That forced Stanford's de
fense to take the field with 1:01 to play
and the ball on Washington State's 14
yard-line.
"I was yelling at them on the side
lines to make a play for me," Edwards
said. "I know Nick Sanchez heard me.
I've thrown plenty of interceptions to
that guy in practice, and I wanted
some other person [for] Nick Sanchez
to pick off."
Sure enough, after senior Cougar
running back Jerome Harrison car
ried the ball to the Washington State
39 as part of a 218-yard day on the
ground,sophomore quarterback Alex

Brink aimed downfield to lead his
squad into field goal range. Sanchez,
however, cemented the victory with
his third career interception.
"1 think we had a good pass rush
because the ball came out quick,"
Sanchez said. "1 just dropped to my
zone and the ball was there so I
grabbed it."
All three Cardinal touchdowns
came off Edwards' arm. The Los
Gatos, Calif, native fired a 17-yard
strike to junior flanker Mark Brad
ford in the first quarter, added a 19-
yard laser to McCullum in the third
quarter and again found Bradford for
a six-yard touchdown with 16 seconds
remaining in the third. After a miss
and a block in his two previous at
tempts, senior kicker Michael Sgroi
added a 34-yard field goal with 7:16 re
maining in the fourth quarter.
Not only did Edwards rally the
Cardinal with his arm, but his scram
bling ability proved essential to the
Cardinal's victory. On a day when the
other Stanford backs netted only 120
rushing yards, Edwards' 92 yards
forced the Cougar defense to respect
the run, opening up passing lanes.
According to Edwards, Stanford
head coach Walt Harris encouraged
his quarterback to scramble — even
calling designed draws throughout the
contest.
"The game plan was a little bit dif
ferent," Edwards said. "They played a
lot of cover two-man, cover zero
bracket, where the middle was wide
open. If the first receiver wasn't open.

I was told all week to take off and
run."
Much of Stanford's success came
against a depleted Cougar squad, as
Washington State's leading receiver,
junior Jason Hill, and leading tackier,
linebacker Will Derting, both missed
the game with injuries. While Cougar
head coach Bill Doba admitted the
losses were difficult, he refused to use
them as an excuse for the loss.
"Losing Derting hurts," he said.
"Obviously, it doesn't take a genius to
see a freshman at tackle and a fresh
man [Derting's replacement, Greg
Trent] at linebacker, right there in the
middle, and they ran the ball in there
pretty we 11.... But that is football. You
are going to have injuries, and the next
guy in line has to be able to step up."
Stanford had to deal not only with
injuries of its own but also with a raii
cous Martin Stadium crowd. Students
packed many of the sections closest to
the field, as the 33,442 Cougar faithful
created an intimidating atmosphere
for the visiting Cardinal.
"It's a really tough place to play,"
Edwards said. "The Washington State
fans were all yelling UC-Davis at us
before the game, and that kind of got
me going."
Stanford now heads to Tucson to
face Arizona (0-2, 1-4), a team that
may represent one of the Cardinal's
easiest contests left on the schedule.
After the Wildcats, all six of Stanford's
remaining opponents made bowl
games last season, and currently stand
a combined 25-7.

a six-yard touchdown with 16 seconds
remaining in the third. After a miss
and a block in his two previous at
tempts, senior kicker Michael Sgroi
added a 34-yard field goal with 7:16 re
maining in the fourth quarter.
Not only did Edwards rally the
Cardinal with his arm, but his scram
bling ability proved essential to the
Cardinal's victory. On a day when the
other Stanford backs netted only 120
rushing yards, Edwards' 92 yards
forced the Cougar defense to respect
the run, opening up passing lanes.
According to Edwards, Stanford
head coach Walt Harris encouraged
his quarterback to scramble — even
calling designed draws throughout the
contest.
"The game plan was a little bit dif
ferent," Edwards said. "They played a
lot of cover two-man, cover zero
bracket, where the middle was wide
open. If the first receiver wasn't open.

I was told all week to take off and
run."
Much of Stanford's success came
against a depleted Cougar squad, as
Washington State's leading receiver,
junior Jason Hill, and leading tackier,
linebacker Will Derting, both missed
the game with injuries. While Cougar
head coach Bill Doba admitted the
losses were difficult, he refused to use
them as an excuse for the loss.
"Losing Derting hurts," he said.
"Obviously, it doesn't take a genius to
see a freshman at tackle and a fresh
man [Derting's replacement, Greg
Trent] at linebacker, right there in the
middle, and they ran the ball in there
pretty we 11.... But that is football. You
are going to have injuries, and the next
guy in line has to be able to step up."
Stanford had to deal not only with
injuries of its own but also with a raii
cous Martin Stadium crowd. Students
packed many of the sections closest to
the field, as the 33,442 Cougar faithful
created an intimidating atmosphere
for the visiting Cardinal.
"It's a really tough place to play,"
Edwards said. "The Washington State
fans were all yelling UC-Davis at us
before the game, and that kind of got
me going."
Stanford now heads to Tucson to
face Arizona (0-2, 1-4), a team that
may represent one of the Cardinal's
easiest contests left on the schedule.
After the Wildcats, all six of Stanford's
remaining opponents made bowl
games last season, and currently stand
a combined 25-7.

Pullman, Wash. — Stanford football (2-2,1-1 Pacific-10
Conference) faced tall odds at Washington State (3-2,0-2
Pac-10).The Cardinal had not won in nearly a month and
traveled 700 miles to a noisy Martin Stadium as 13-point
underdogs. Further, Stanford had already lost many key
players to injury this young season, most recently star jun
ior linebacker Michael Okwo (ankle).

for 257 yards and three scores in arguably the finest game

of his career. In addition, a passing de
fense that had hemorrhaged yards in
previous games bent but did not
break, and junior cornerback Nick
Sanchez' interception with 32 seconds
remaining iced a 24-21 victory over an
injury-depleted Cougar squad.
"It was a great win," said senior
flanker Justin McCullum, who fin
ished the contest with 67 receiving
yards, including a 19-yard touchdown
reception in the third quarter. "All
sides of the ball —offensive, defensive
and special teams — played great. It
was great to have a real team win."
With only 4:01 to play and a 24-21
lead, Stanford needed to gain just two
or three first downs to run out the
clock and ice the victory. Edwards
picked up one first down on a 17-yard
scramble, part of a team-leading 92-
yard rushing performance, but senior
receiver Gerren Crochet could not
handle Edwards' pass on the ensuing
third down.That forced Stanford's de
fense to take the field with 1:01 to play
and the ball on Washington State's 14
yard-line.
"I was yelling at them on the side
lines to make a play for me," Edwards
said. "I know Nick Sanchez heard me.
I've thrown plenty of interceptions to
that guy in practice, and I wanted
some other person [for] Nick Sanchez
to pick off."
Sure enough, after senior Cougar
running back Jerome Harrison car
ried the ball to the Washington State
39 as part of a 218-yard day on the
ground,sophomore quarterback Alex

Brink aimed downfield to lead his
squad into field goal range. Sanchez,
however, cemented the victory with
his third career interception.
"1 think we had a good pass rush
because the ball came out quick,"
Sanchez said. "1 just dropped to my
zone and the ball was there so I
grabbed it."
All three Cardinal touchdowns
came off Edwards' arm. The Los
Gatos, Calif, native fired a 17-yard
strike to junior flanker Mark Brad
ford in the first quarter, added a 19-
yard laser to McCullum in the third
quarter and again found Bradford for
a six-yard touchdown with 16 seconds
remaining in the third. After a miss
