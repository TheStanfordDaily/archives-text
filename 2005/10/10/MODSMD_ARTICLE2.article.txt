## Students forced to wait while Fire Department investigated complaint 
### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
Residents of 680 Lomita found them
selves temporarily homeless early yester
day morning after gaseous fumes detected
in the house warranted a complete evacua
tion of the building, according to junior
Kirk McConnell, the house's manager. As
residents waited outside from 12:45 a.m. to
1:20 a.m. for firefighters to arrive on the
scene, students huddled for warmth and
broke out their cell phones, calling friends
to solicit alternate sleeping quarters for the
night.
Fortunately, the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment determined that the building was'safe
to occupy,and,around 2 a.m., told residents
that they could re-enter the house. No gas
leak was identified, said Battalion Chief
Niles Broussard of the Fire Department.
"It was a false alarm, basically," he said
in an interview with The Daily.
Sophomore Sherie Gertler, a resident of
680, said she and her friends first smelled
gas in the house's second-floor hallway
around 12 a.m. After Gertler went down
stairs to see if people on the first-floor
smelled anything, she said she began to feel
lightheaded and decided to inform house
staff members of the situation.
Staffers acknowledged the smell and
noticed a suspicious hissing noise, so they
cleared residents out of the house, opened
all windows and doors to vent the fumes
and called the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment between 12:30 and 12:45 a.m., Mc-
Connell said.The sheriff arrived almost im
mediately, but the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment reached the premises about 45 min
utes after the call was placed.
Once the firefighters were on the scene,
they "spent about 25 minutes in the house
and did a very thorough search," Mc-
Connell said. "They said they heard the
hissing noise, but because we had opened
the windows, they could not smell the gas."
Broussard said that the Fire Depart
ment does not know what caused the
smells.
"We investigated the house, but the
smells had dissipated [by the time we ar
rived] and we were not able to locate their
source," he said.
Firefighters told the staff that a number
