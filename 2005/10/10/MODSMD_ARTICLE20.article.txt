# Respect due for mascot ‘Prince Lightfoot’
## 
### 
I always saw the issue of Native American mas
cots in pretty much cut-and-dried terms: that
they are racist representations and sports teams
should do away with them.The responses I received
after expressing a similar view in my first column, in
which I explained how Stanford changed its nick
name from the 'Indians' to the 'Cardinal,' have
taught me that the subject is a bit more nuanced
than I firsit supposed.
One objected to my comparison of a nickname
like 'India ns' to Notre Dame's 'Fighting Irish,' as the
Native American nicknames is especially offensive
because of this country's history of violence toward
them. Another came from A1 Kirkland, a defensive
tackle on the 1952 Stanford football team. He was
offended by my reference to the former Stanford
Indians n iascot,Timm Williams, as "a guy who called
himself' Prince Lightfoot.'" Kirkland called the ref
erence "egregious" and said that Williams "never
did anything that brought any discredit or dishonor
to himself, his tribe, to Indians or to Stanford."
But the comment that really made me think
twice came from one reader who offered to come
down to The Daily and "string this jackass [me] up"
for wha>i I wrote about Williams. After learning
more about him, I can sort of see where that reader
was coming from.
Williams, or 'Prince Lightfoot,' acted as Stan
ford's unofficial mascot for 20 some years until
1972, when a group of 55 Stanford Native American
students, and staff succeeded in convincing then-
Presidernt Dr. Richard Lyman to drop the moniker
'Indians.'
In tlhe 20 years that preceded that decision,
Williams attended nearly every Stanford football
game, hiome and away. At each game he performed
traditional Yurok tribal dances in traditional regalia
— with out taking a break.
The Stanford American Indian Organization pe
titioned for Williams' removal as early as 1970, call
ing his performances unnecessary, inappropriate
and"a mockery of Indian religious practices."
Rom Eadie, a defensive end on that 1952 Rose
Bowl football team, was one student who felt proud
to have Williams representing the school.
"He was a warrior, and we were all damned glad
to be Indians," Eadie said.
Eaclie's son-in-law, William Rodden, met
Williams in 1980 at the Williams' family campsite
(Dad's camp) and formed a strong bond with
Williams.
Rodden said that Williams danced out of a love
for Stanford and a desire to teach Native American
culture. He cited Williams' tireless work for the Na
tive American community, which included frequent
appearances before Congress on behalf of Native
American rights and his role in helping to found a
privately-funded health care service for Native
Americans. Williams also struggled for Native
American civil rights in the early 1960'5, actions for
which he received death threats for the rest of his
life.
