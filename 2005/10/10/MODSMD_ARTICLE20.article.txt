# Respect due for mascot ‘Prince Lightfoot’
## 
### 
I always saw the issue of Native American mas
cots in pretty much cut-and-dried terms: that
they are racist representations and sports teams
should do away with them.The responses I received
after expressing a similar view in my first column, in
which I explained how Stanford changed its nick
name from the 'Indians' to the 'Cardinal,' have
taught me that the subject is a bit more nuanced
than I firsit supposed.
One objected to my comparison of a nickname
like 'India ns' to Notre Dame's 'Fighting Irish,' as the
Native American nicknames is especially offensive
because of this country's history of violence toward
them. Another came from A1 Kirkland, a defensive
tackle on the 1952 Stanford football team. He was
offended by my reference to the former Stanford
Indians n iascot,Timm Williams, as "a guy who called
himself' Prince Lightfoot.'" Kirkland called the ref
erence "egregious" and said that Williams "never
did anything that brought any discredit or dishonor
to himself, his tribe, to Indians or to Stanford."
But the comment that really made me think
twice came from one reader who offered to come
down to The Daily and "string this jackass [me] up"
for wha>i I wrote about Williams. After learning
more about him, I can sort of see where that reader
was coming from.
Williams, or 'Prince Lightfoot,' acted as Stan
ford's unofficial mascot for 20 some years until
1972, when a group of 55 Stanford Native American
students, and staff succeeded in convincing then-
Presidernt Dr. Richard Lyman to drop the moniker
'Indians.'
In tlhe 20 years that preceded that decision,
Williams attended nearly every Stanford football
game, hiome and away. At each game he performed
traditional Yurok tribal dances in traditional regalia
— with out taking a break.
The Stanford American Indian Organization pe
titioned for Williams' removal as early as 1970, call
ing his performances unnecessary, inappropriate
and"a mockery of Indian religious practices."
Rom Eadie, a defensive end on that 1952 Rose
Bowl football team, was one student who felt proud
to have Williams representing the school.
"He was a warrior, and we were all damned glad
to be Indians," Eadie said.
Eaclie's son-in-law, William Rodden, met
Williams in 1980 at the Williams' family campsite
(Dad's camp) and formed a strong bond with
Williams.
Rodden said that Williams danced out of a love
for Stanford and a desire to teach Native American
culture. He cited Williams' tireless work for the Na
tive American community, which included frequent
appearances before Congress on behalf of Native
American rights and his role in helping to found a
privately-funded health care service for Native
Americans. Williams also struggled for Native
American civil rights in the early 1960'5, actions for
which he received death threats for the rest of his
life.

bigoted people.Timm's attitude was,
'If he doesn't walk away, I'll keep
talking,'" Rodden recalled.
Williams claimed that, despite his
years of service, the administration
refused to meet with him when the
nickname was changed. He told
Eadie that he approached them with
a proclamation in his favor signed by
the chiefs of a number of different
Indian tribes nationwide, but was
turned away.
After the Tree took over as Stan
ford's unofficial mascot, Williams
continued to educate informally and
work for Indian rights under the
Reagan gubernatorial and presiden
tial administrations, serving in the
cabinet of the former. He also con
tinued to make the eight-hour drive
from his hometown of Crescent City
to attend Stanford football games
until his death in a car accident in
1987.
"In the proclamation he tried to
present to Dr. Lyman, the Indian
chiefs wrote something to the effect
of, 'We think it's not only an honor
for our culture to represent Stan
ford, but for Stanford to be repre
sented by [Timm],'" said Eadie, re
ferring to a conversation he had with
Williams years after the mascot was
changed.
Williams' treatment raises the
question of whether the University
was steering closer towards cultural
understanding or just toeing a line of
political correctness. Stanford did
away with the 'Indians' nickname
because of the perceived insensitivi
ty of everything surrounding the
name, but in hindsight the adminis
tration's purported treatment of
Williams may have been short on

sympathy towards him.
To be sure, some Native Ameri
cans had legitimate concerns about
Stanford's use of the Indians name,
the logo (a caricature of a small Indi
an with a bulbous nose) and
Williams' performances.
"A football field is a mighty
strange place for any real or tradition
al Native American dance or religious
ceremony to be performed," said
Denni Diane Woodward, the Assis
tant Director of the Stanford Ameri
can Indian, Alaska Native and Native
Hawaiian Progam."lt's not only inap
propriate; it's disrespectful."
With the NCAA's recent decision
to bar 17 schools from using Native
American nicknames in postseason
tournaments, the question of who
deserves input on such matters is be
coming increasingly unclear.
Florida State was granted an ex
ception to call itself the 'Seminoles'
in postseason play after the Semi
nole Tribe of Florida declared its
support for the University's use of
the name. However, in Woodward's
opinion, FSU's mascot more resem
bles a Plains Indian, raising ques
tions over who should be consulted
in such decisions.
It is harder to see the issue of Na
tive American mascots in black-and
white terms when it's colored by the
people who are actually wrapped up
in each individual controversy. Iron
ically, Williams, who prided himself
as an educator of Native American
culture, was a casualty of a move
ment to increase cultural sensitivity.
There is more to cultural aware
ness than simply changing a name —
it also entails trying to understand
and interact with our Native Ameri
can roots and supporting those who
make contributions to our apprecia
tion of them.
