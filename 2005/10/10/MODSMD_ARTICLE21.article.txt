## Men suffer one-goal loss to rival Bears 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
After weathering a 10-minute assault by Califor
nia forwards in the second half, the Stanford men's
sOccer team (3-6-2, Pacific-10 Conference 0-2-1) was
too drained to dodge its rival's final bullet.
In the 78th minute, Call's senior forward Pieter
Berger scored off a ball that bounced around in the
box after sophomore Luke Sassano crossed it into the
penalty area. After this,the Cardinal could not recov
er against the No. 15 Golden Bears (8-2-1. 1-2-1). It
was Berger's first game-winning goal of the year, and
if handed Stanford its second home loss, 1-0, in front
rif nearly 1,500 fans.
"We exerted a lot *of emotional and physical ener
gy in the first half and I think that took its toll," Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon said. "Cal played very
well, and they're top 15 to 20 and maybe even a top
five to 10 team. From that perspective there was some
good.but it's small consolation when you lose a tough
game."
â€¢ The Cardinal played step for step with the Bears
for much of the first half and even held a 4-3 edge in
shots at the break. Stanford was able to keep posses
sion of the ball for most of the first half, while sopho
more defender Scott Bolkan and reshirt sophomore
midfielder Marcus Ryan tried to penetrate the box.
