## Men suffer one-goal loss to rival Bears 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
After weathering a 10-minute assault by Califor
nia forwards in the second half, the Stanford men's
sOccer team (3-6-2, Pacific-10 Conference 0-2-1) was
too drained to dodge its rival's final bullet.
In the 78th minute, Call's senior forward Pieter
Berger scored off a ball that bounced around in the
box after sophomore Luke Sassano crossed it into the
penalty area. After this,the Cardinal could not recov
er against the No. 15 Golden Bears (8-2-1. 1-2-1). It
was Berger's first game-winning goal of the year, and
if handed Stanford its second home loss, 1-0, in front
rif nearly 1,500 fans.
"We exerted a lot *of emotional and physical ener
gy in the first half and I think that took its toll," Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon said. "Cal played very
well, and they're top 15 to 20 and maybe even a top
five to 10 team. From that perspective there was some
good.but it's small consolation when you lose a tough
game."
â€¢ The Cardinal played step for step with the Bears
for much of the first half and even held a 4-3 edge in
shots at the break. Stanford was able to keep posses
sion of the ball for most of the first half, while sopho
more defender Scott Bolkan and reshirt sophomore
midfielder Marcus Ryan tried to penetrate the box.

the strong efforts of several Cardinal players, Stanford fell in four games.
A horrific injury in the 18th minute si
lenced the crowd and took an emotional toll
on everyone at Maloney Field. Freshman
midfielder / forward T.J. Novak went in fora
tackle midway through the first half, and an
audible crack could he heard through the
stands as a Cal player slid into his leg.The im
mediate word was that he broke his leg and
was sent to the hospital, but the extent of the
injury will be better known in the next few
days.
"Its demoralizing for both teams when
someone goes down with a serious injury,"
Simon said. "No one wants to see it happen."
Even though the Cardinal had looked
fresh and sharp up until the injury timeout,
there were early indications that the Bears
had control, including a goal by senior for
ward Calen Carr that was called back due to
an offside call.
The halftime intermission was a tipping
point, as Cal came out of the break a step
ahead of Stanford and began to pepper the
net consistently. The Bears recorded nine
shots in the second half, many of which came
right out of the gate. The Cardinal were able
to wiggle out of trouble through good goal
keeping by junior Andrew Kartunen and a
fair amount of luck as the Bears missed a
couple of rockets and a rebound put-back.
"After both [TV timeouts] I think we
looked great because we had time to get a
breather and relax," sophomore midfielder /
defender Ryan Oblak said."But we got tired
out and couldn't keep up. Our trailing play
ers, on both offensive and defensive transi
tions, had a tough time getting into the play"
As the game got choppier, the Cardinal
could not effectively keep the ball on the
ground. Stanford could not play the posses
sion-passing game, which had been effective
in the first half. This gave the Bears a distinct
advantage. The 18-yard box began to resem
ble a popcorn popper and, in the end, Stan
ford was one clearing ball short of overtime.
"I think we were good when we kept the
ball on the ground and found the forwardis
feet who could then lay it off to have runs
going through." Bolkan said. "When it got a
little sloppy with some long ball and a lot of
balls in the air. we kind of faded out of the
match."
Despite its struggles, Stanford was very
close to knotting the game up again in the
last two minutes as it was able to once again
penetrate into the penalty area. A crossing
ball found Bolkan and Ryan, but neither was
able to make solid contact. As time expired,
a frustrated Cardinal player threw the ball
into the turf in disgust.
Next up for the Cardinal is Washington
(6-3-0,0-2-0) and red-hot Oregon State (7-2-
4,3-0-0) at Maloney Field. Rebounding from
such a tiring, emotional and physical loss
could be hard, but the young Cardinal have
shown resiliency and signs that they can only
improve.
