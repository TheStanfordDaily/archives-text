# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Women experience rare defeat 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Faced with an opponent that had something to
prove, the No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team
(16-2, Pacific-10 Conference 5-1) fought valiantly
hut fell apart late Saturday night, losing for the
first time since late August to still-undefeated No.
2 Washington (14-0,5-0).
The Cardinal had blown by unranked Wash
ington State (8-10,1-4) in three games on Friday
but lost a four-game match to the 1 luskies, whom
Stanford defeated in the 2004 national semifinal.
"Maybe my team forgot that the team we beat
last year [ in the Final Four] to end their seasen was
Washington," head coach John Dunning said.
"They have six seniors on their team who are pret
ty darn motivated to reverse that result."
The Huskies were out looking for revenge,
focus that showed on the court. Washington out
hit, out-served and out-blocked the Cardinal en
route to the 30-24,30-28,32-34,30-I.') victory.
"We fought hard, but 1 don't think we're there
yet," junior outside hitter Kristin Richards said.
"And that's exciting because we have a lot of po
tential: our potential is scary."
Providing one of the few Stanford highlights
was freshman middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo. While the Washington blockers were shutting
down the Cardinal's outside attack. Akinradewo
scored a team- and career-high 20 kills from the
middle, hitting .545. But the 13-7 Washington ad
vantage at the net was telling. The Huskies frus
trated Stanford's outside hitters all night, while the
Cardinal struggled against a qu.ick and versatile
offense. Stanford was missing the presence of in
jured junior middle blocker Lizzie Suiter who fell
victim this week to a freak accident in practice. A
ball hit her in the eye, bruising her retina and

sidelining her indefinitely.
With Suiter on the bench, the Cardinal starting
lineup featured three freshmen. Washington start
ed the match with five seniors on the floor and
their experience and chemistry showed.
"Our youth is experienced enough that we can
win," Dunning said. "But age is different in terms
of how had you want something. There's no ques
tion that the juniors and seniors who haven't had
it are very motivated to get it.This is the best era in
Washington's history and they have a chance to
make it happen."
The Huskies preserved their perfect record,
though this weekend, they needed to play more
than three games to win a match for the first time
this season.
On Friday, Stanford overpowered a weak
Washington State team, which could find no an
swer for the Cardinal's powerful hitters. Stanford
put together several long runs to cruise to a 30-12
win.
The Cougars responded slightly better in the
second game but still could not stop the Stanford
hitting machine, losing 30-16 on a hitting error. In
the third game, Stanford held off a late Washing
ton State rally, which closed the deficit to two, tak
ing the victory 30-24 on Richards' 20th kill of the
night.
Stanford tallied twice as many kills as Washing
ton State and held them to a negative hitting per
centage through the first two games. Freshman
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza chipped in 12 kills
on .429 hitting. The Cardinal service game tallied
eight aces.
After a quick victory Friday, Stanford faced a
much tougher challenge in Washington the fol
lowing night. The Cardinal held a four-point lead
at the midpoint of the first game, but
Washington put together a string of
points to overtake the lead. The
Huskies pulled away and closed the
30-24 win with a kill.
Both teams came out strong in
game two. Washington led by as much
as four, but Stanford kept clawing
back into a tie, knotting the score at
28-28. But a kill from the right side
gave the Huskies the game 30-28 and

put them up by two heading into the
locker room.
The Cardinal carried some of their
second game momentum into the
third game, fighting back from a
deficit to score a late tie. An attack
error at 28-28 gave the Huskies match
point, but the Stanford defense buck
led down, refusing to let the ball hit
the floor. Barboza scored a kill to give
the Cardinal its first game point of the
night, and a setting error by Washing
ton gave Stanford the game 34-32.
The momentum which had
buoyed the Cardinal to victory in the
third game dissipated in the fourth
game. The Huskies again took an

early lead, but for the first time, Stan
ford had no answer. A lackluster Car
dinal squad was frustrated by the
block and its own inability to find the
floor. The exciting match had an anti
climactic end. with Washington
rolling to a 30-15 win. A shocked and
disappointed Stanford squad had no
explanation for its sudden loss of mo
mentum.
"1 wish 1 could answer that ques
tion. but 1 just don't know," Richards
said. "I think [Washington] felt
threatened after game three, and they
came out fighting out of their heads. 1
don't think that we handled that very
well."

"For the first three games, even
though we lost the first two, it still felt
like we were winning," sophomore
setter Bryn Kehoe said. "We always,
had the momentum. In the fourth
game, people got tired."
When they return to practice
Monday, the Cardinal face the chal
lenge of moving on and learning from
the devastating loss.
"We're definitely going to work on
our blocking and serving tougher,"
Kehoe said. "I thought our serving
was a little passive tonight. I think we
need to have an attitude change in
practice. Once that happens, who
knows how good we'll be."

"Our youth is experienced enough that we can
win," Dunning said. "But age is different in terms
of how had you want something. There's no ques
tion that the juniors and seniors who haven't had
it are very motivated to get it.This is the best era in
Washington's history and they have a chance to
make it happen."
The Huskies preserved their perfect record,
though this weekend, they needed to play more
than three games to win a match for the first time
this season.
On Friday, Stanford overpowered a weak
Washington State team, which could find no an
swer for the Cardinal's powerful hitters. Stanford
put together several long runs to cruise to a 30-12
win.
The Cougars responded slightly better in the
second game but still could not stop the Stanford
hitting machine, losing 30-16 on a hitting error. In
the third game, Stanford held off a late Washing
ton State rally, which closed the deficit to two, tak
ing the victory 30-24 on Richards' 20th kill of the
night.
Stanford tallied twice as many kills as Washing
ton State and held them to a negative hitting per
centage through the first two games. Freshman
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza chipped in 12 kills
on .429 hitting. The Cardinal service game tallied
eight aces.
After a quick victory Friday, Stanford faced a
much tougher challenge in Washington the fol
lowing night. The Cardinal held a four-point lead
at the midpoint of the first game, but
Washington put together a string of
points to overtake the lead. The
Huskies pulled away and closed the
30-24 win with a kill.
Both teams came out strong in
game two. Washington led by as much
as four, but Stanford kept clawing
back into a tie, knotting the score at
28-28. But a kill from the right side
gave the Huskies the game 30-28 and

put them up by two heading into the
locker room.
The Cardinal carried some of their
second game momentum into the
third game, fighting back from a
deficit to score a late tie. An attack
error at 28-28 gave the Huskies match
point, but the Stanford defense buck
led down, refusing to let the ball hit
the floor. Barboza scored a kill to give
the Cardinal its first game point of the
night, and a setting error by Washing
ton gave Stanford the game 34-32.
The momentum which had
buoyed the Cardinal to victory in the
third game dissipated in the fourth
game. The Huskies again took an

early lead, but for the first time, Stan
ford had no answer. A lackluster Car
dinal squad was frustrated by the
block and its own inability to find the
floor. The exciting match had an anti
climactic end. with Washington
rolling to a 30-15 win. A shocked and
disappointed Stanford squad had no
explanation for its sudden loss of mo
mentum.
"1 wish 1 could answer that ques
tion. but 1 just don't know," Richards
said. "I think [Washington] felt
threatened after game three, and they
came out fighting out of their heads. 1
don't think that we handled that very
well."

"For the first three games, even
though we lost the first two, it still felt
like we were winning," sophomore
setter Bryn Kehoe said. "We always,
had the momentum. In the fourth
game, people got tired."
When they return to practice
Monday, the Cardinal face the chal
lenge of moving on and learning from
the devastating loss.
"We're definitely going to work on
our blocking and serving tougher,"
Kehoe said. "I thought our serving
was a little passive tonight. I think we
need to have an attitude change in
practice. Once that happens, who
knows how good we'll be."
Faced with an opponent that had something to
prove, the No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team
(16-2, Pacific-10 Conference 5-1) fought valiantly
hut fell apart late Saturday night, losing for the
first time since late August to still-undefeated No.
2 Washington (14-0,5-0).
The Cardinal had blown by unranked Wash
ington State (8-10,1-4) in three games on Friday
but lost a four-game match to the 1 luskies, whom
Stanford defeated in the 2004 national semifinal.
"Maybe my team forgot that the team we beat
last year [ in the Final Four] to end their seasen was
Washington," head coach John Dunning said.
"They have six seniors on their team who are pret
ty darn motivated to reverse that result."
The Huskies were out looking for revenge,
focus that showed on the court. Washington out
hit, out-served and out-blocked the Cardinal en
route to the 30-24,30-28,32-34,30-I.') victory.
"We fought hard, but 1 don't think we're there
yet," junior outside hitter Kristin Richards said.
"And that's exciting because we have a lot of po
tential: our potential is scary."
Providing one of the few Stanford highlights
was freshman middle blocker Foluke Akinrade
wo. While the Washington blockers were shutting
down the Cardinal's outside attack. Akinradewo
scored a team- and career-high 20 kills from the
middle, hitting .545. But the 13-7 Washington ad
vantage at the net was telling. The Huskies frus
trated Stanford's outside hitters all night, while the
Cardinal struggled against a qu.ick and versatile
offense. Stanford was missing the presence of in
jured junior middle blocker Lizzie Suiter who fell
victim this week to a freak accident in practice. A
ball hit her in the eye, bruising her retina and

sidelining her indefinitely.
With Suiter on the bench, the Cardinal starting
lineup featured three freshmen. Washington start
ed the match with five seniors on the floor and
their experience and chemistry showed.
"Our youth is experienced enough that we can
win," Dunning said. "But age is different in terms
