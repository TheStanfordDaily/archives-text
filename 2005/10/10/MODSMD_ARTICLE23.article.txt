## Cardinal perform well at All-American 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
When Cardinal junior Anne
Yelsey (2-1) sent Florida's top
ranked Jennifer Magley packing in
the first round of the Riviera/ITA
Women's All-American Champi
onships, the No. 1 Stanford women's
tennis team was off to a brilliant
start.
When senior Alice Barnes (3-1)
dispatched last year's runner-up at
the All-American Championships,
No. 11 Cristelle Grier (3-1) of North
western. in the first round, Stanford
quickly began to gain momentum at
the top-notch tournament.
Then junior Theresa Logar
stepped on the courts, completing the

Bercek at one point in
the second set trailed 3-0, appeared
sluggish and no match for Leim
bach's speed and concise moves
around the court. Earlier in the
week, however, Bercek competed in
top form, breezing past Yelsey in the
quarterfinal and Barnes in the semi
final.
In that game, Bercek thwarted
Barnes' final run at All-American,
handing her a 6-2, 6-2 loss. Despite
what the modest straight-set score
might suggest, Barnes said she wasn't
"too disappointed" with her efforts
in southern California.
"In any match, if [your oppo
nent's] playing well, you've got to
keep [the score] tight, otherwise
they're going to pull away," Barnes
said. "I played all right, and she was
playing really well. Things were just a
little bit off for me."
Barnes noted that she would have
