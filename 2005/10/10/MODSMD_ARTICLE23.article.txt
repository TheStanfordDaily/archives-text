# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Cardinal perform well at All-American 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
When Cardinal junior Anne
Yelsey (2-1) sent Florida's top
ranked Jennifer Magley packing in
the first round of the Riviera/ITA
Women's All-American Champi
onships, the No. 1 Stanford women's
tennis team was off to a brilliant
start.
When senior Alice Barnes (3-1)
dispatched last year's runner-up at
the All-American Championships,
No. 11 Cristelle Grier (3-1) of North
western. in the first round, Stanford
quickly began to gain momentum at
the top-notch tournament.
Then junior Theresa Logar
stepped on the courts, completing the
trifecta of Cardinal players to make
the main draw in the Pacific Pal
isades, Calif., event. Logar dropped
the first round on a tiebreak against
her opening-round opponent, Geor
gia's No. 6 Shadisha Robinson (0-1),
but rallied back ferociously to claim a
three-set win, 6-7 (5), 6-1.6-2.
But in the end, a one-day-at-a
time mentality got the best of Stan
ford. In subsequent rounds, the Car

dinal tired out and were nowhere to
be found when Texas Christian's
Nicole Leimbach defeated Duke's
Daniela Bercek in two straight sets
(6-3,6-4) for Sundayfs final.
Bercek at one point in
the second set trailed 3-0, appeared
sluggish and no match for Leim
bach's speed and concise moves
around the court. Earlier in the
week, however, Bercek competed in
top form, breezing past Yelsey in the
quarterfinal and Barnes in the semi
final.
In that game, Bercek thwarted
Barnes' final run at All-American,
handing her a 6-2, 6-2 loss. Despite
what the modest straight-set score
might suggest, Barnes said she wasn't
"too disappointed" with her efforts
in southern California.
"In any match, if [your oppo
nent's] playing well, you've got to
keep [the score] tight, otherwise
they're going to pull away," Barnes
said. "I played all right, and she was
playing really well. Things were just a
little bit off for me."
Barnes noted that she would have
liked a better first serve percentage.
She has increasing opportunities to
improve this aspect of her offensive
game as team practices get fully un
derway.
"We've only been practicing fora
week, but I think I played the best 1
ever have at this tournament,"
Barnes said.
Yelsey echoed Barnes' senti
ments regarding the team's nascent
stages of development.
"We care so much about the team
event, so for us, our season starts in
January," Yelsey said. "I would agree
that this tournament doesn't mean a
lot to our season, so any good results
are just icing on the cake."
Yelsey fell to Bercek, 7-5, 6-0,
after pulling out a three-set battle
against the Horned Frogs' Helena
Besovic (1-1) in the second round. It
took Yelsey two-and-a-half hours to
defeat Besovic, posting a give-and
take, 6-3,4-6,7-6 (8), win which left
her drained for Friday's showdown
with Bercek.
"Our team knew it was going to
be a tough match," Yelsey said. "Our
team knows [Bercek] really well be
cause she used to play for UCLA. I
was up 5-3 in the first set when over
all fatigue set in, and it just kind of
spiraled downhill after that."
Yelsey added that she and Barnes

could "hardly move" after eight
straight hours on the courts.The pair
also lost its doubles match on Friday,
deferring to Christina and Christian
Thompson (3-0) of Norte Dame, 9-7.
Despite bowing out early, Yelsey
had already taken the cake on Thurs
day, rising to a victorious 6-2,6-2 oc
casion over Floridai's Jennifer Ma
gley (2-2).
Magley, a senior, reached the
semifinals in last year's NCAA Sin
gles Championship.Therefore,
Yelsey considers the win a substan
tial confidence booster.
"I was stringing points together
really well," she said."(Magley) was
n't serving her best, and 1 definitely
got a bunch of free points."
Win or lose, Barnes and Yelsey
both agree that last week's match
play equaled one of Stanford's
strongest showings in recent Ail-
American history. They are happy to
lay to rest some opponents' perenni
al speculations that Stanford makes
a spotty showing at the cameo tour
nament â€” a weak effort opponents
hope carries over into the regular
season.
"In past years, after All-Ameri
can, people [think],'Oh, we're going
to beat Stanford this year,"' Barnes
said. "I hope people are a little bit
[more) worried this time around."
