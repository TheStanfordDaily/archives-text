# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Men open conference play with win 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 3 Stanford men's water polo
team (8-2,1 -0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), Saturday's matchup against the No. 10
Pacific Tigers (7-6, 0-1) marked the official
opening of 2005 conference play. When the
final whistle sounded at the end of the game,
the Stanford men had demonstrated their
readiness for the season with a decisive 9-2 win.
Coming off a difficult loss to top-ranked
California a week ago, the Cardinal offense
sent a strong message by posting three goals in
the first two periods of play against the Tigers.
On the defensive end, Stanford held the high
powered Pacific attack in check for the entire
first half of the contest. Led by redshirt senior
center back Will McLaughlin (16 goals) and
junior driver Kenny Yamamoto (15 goals), the
Tigers entered the contest against the Cardinal
boasting a lineup of six players already in pos
session of double-digit goal totals.
As a result of their effective play in both
ends of the pool, the Cardinal managed to take
a commanding 6-0 lead into the half. With 5:26
remaining in the third period, the Tigers were
finally able to put themselves on the board,
when senior Adam Zobler capitalized on a Pa
cific scoring drive to notch his first goal of the
day.
The Cardinal refused to relent in the inten
sity of their attack and answered with three
goals of their own to put the game convincing
ly out of reach.
Senior captain Peter Varellas highlighted
the Cardinal offensive field-day. single-hand
edly outscoring the entire Pacific squad with
four goals. Senior Thomas Hopkins, juniors J.J.
Garton and Tyler Drake, redshirt sophomore
Ryan Fortune and freshman Will Hindle-Katel
rounded out the Stanford scoring and effec
tively demonstrated the wide range of threats
opponents will be forced to face when taking
on the Cardinal offense.
But it was the Stanford defensive stand that
was perhaps of greatest significance. With eight
saves, junior goalie Beau Stockstill anchored
an effort that consistently stifled the Pacific
game plan. And after the squad's 9-5 loss to the
Bears a week ago, the Cardinal handled the Pa
cific lineup nearly flawlessly for the entire
game.
The varsity squad couldn't reach the same
level of success in their annual showdown
against the alumni squad yesterday morning at
Avery Aquatic Center. The alumni came in to
win the match in impressive fashion, building
an 11 -8 lead midway through the final period of
play and holding the Stanford varsity scoreless
the rest of the way.
Despite their unofficial setback at the hands
of Stanford stars of the past, the Cardinal look
to build on the momentum they built in their
defeat of Pacific.This Friday, they take on No. 9
Loyola Marymount at home. The matchup
serves as a final tuneup before the Cardinal's
appearance at the 2005 NorCal Tournament
being held across the bay at Berkeley's Spiek
er Aquatics Complex this weekend.
