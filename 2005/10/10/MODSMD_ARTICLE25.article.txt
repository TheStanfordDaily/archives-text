### SOOMIN KIM STAFF WRITER 
University Provost John
Etchemendy agreed, last Wednes
day, to a contribution of $40,000
every year to the annual Thanksgiv
ing Dinner, an event organized by
the ASSU and the Graduate School
Council (GSC) for students staying
on campus during the holiday. His
annual financial commitment to the
event will spare the ASSU and GSC
members from soliciting funds from
multiple sources on campus.
"Last year, when $45,000 were
needed, we had to get funds from
various locations, including the
Deans of all of the Schools on cam

the Graduate Student Programming
Board, Dining Services, the GSC and
the Undergraduate Senate," said
Hannah Scherer, a doctoral student
in geological and environmental sci

GSC Co-Chair Tom Lee, a gradu

also praised Etchemendy's pledge.

Now that we have the guaranteed
funding, the organizers can focus on

planning more and ensuring that this
significant event continues to be held
in the future."
On the night of Nov. 24, the GSC's
annual Thanksgiving Dinner will cel
ebrate its eighth anniversary. For
mostly international and other stu

Thanksgiving Dinner has provided
stuffed-turkey, potatoes and squash
and pumpkin pies right on campus.
Last year, held in the Wilbur Din
ing Hall, the dinner attracted 1,500
students who chose to stay on cam
pus for the four-day break.
"The dinner serves the graduate
population that has always been less
likely to leave campus during the
