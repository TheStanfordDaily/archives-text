# Provost gives Thanksgiving support
## 
### SOOMIN KIM STAFF WRITER 
University Provost John
Etchemendy agreed, last Wednes
day, to a contribution of $40,000
every year to the annual Thanksgiv
ing Dinner, an event organized by
the ASSU and the Graduate School
Council (GSC) for students staying
on campus during the holiday. His
annual financial commitment to the
event will spare the ASSU and GSC
members from soliciting funds from
multiple sources on campus.
"Last year, when $45,000 were
needed, we had to get funds from
various locations, including the
Deans of all of the Schools on cam
pus, the President and Provost's Of

fice, the VPS A, the Dean of Students,
the Graduate Student Programming
Board, Dining Services, the GSC and
the Undergraduate Senate," said
Hannah Scherer, a doctoral student
in geological and environmental sci
ences and the Thanksgiving fundrais
ing coordinator.
GSC Co-Chair Tom Lee, a gradu
ate student in electrical engineering,
also praised Etchemendy's pledge.
"The provost's generous offer of
funds is definitely great news," he
said. "Worrying about whether we
would meet the budget was a lot of
stress on the organizers, and we used
to have one person go to every de
partment to ask for funds all year.
Now that we have the guaranteed
funding, the organizers can focus on

planning more and ensuring that this
significant event continues to be held
in the future."
On the night of Nov. 24, the GSC's
annual Thanksgiving Dinner will cel
ebrate its eighth anniversary. For
mostly international and other stu
dents who cannot fly home, the
Thanksgiving Dinner has provided
stuffed-turkey, potatoes and squash
and pumpkin pies right on campus.
Last year, held in the Wilbur Din
ing Hall, the dinner attracted 1,500
students who chose to stay on cam
pus for the four-day break.
"The dinner serves the graduate
population that has always been less
likely to leave campus during the
break, driven by the strong interna
tional student population," said sen
ior Aneto Okonkwo, ASSU vice
president.
But, last year the Faculty Senate
and the provost had also decided to
lengthen Thanksgiving from four
days to a week-long vacation, raising
speculation about the negative im
pact on the dinner's attendance, es
pecially from the undergraduate
population.
"The attendance this year may be
a bit different with the longer break,
but we still expect it to be a success,"
Lee said.
Kate Dinh, a junior from New
York, said that she will be going
home this year for Thanksgiving
whereas last year she stayed in her
friend's house in California.
"The problem before was that we
East Coasters would be spending
more time on an airplane and in the
airport than actually at home," Dinh
said. "Now that's no longer true, I
don't see why people wouldn't go

home for the break."
Paul Gurney, a graduate student
from Canada who attended the
Thanksgiving Dinner last year said
that he doubted many graduate in
ternational students will fly home.
"They will probably use the time
to catch up on studying and re
search," Gurney said. "Many PhD
students probably will not even no
tice that there is a longer break since
they are not taking classes."
GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen, a sec
ond-year law student, said that
"some law school students are also
not taking classes, and they do not
have a week-long break; they will
most likely be able to attend the
event."
The GSC Thanksgiving Dinner
team explained that they are now in
the process of planning the event. As
soon as they secure a venue, the
RSVP system will be available on
line for interested students to sign
up.
"In about two weeks, we will have
the students RSVP for the Thanksgiv
ing Dinner so we have enough turkey
and all the fixings available," Allen
said. "If the numbers are significantly
lower than in the past, we will need to
reevaluate our purchases."
