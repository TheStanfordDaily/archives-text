### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Society of Black
Scientists and Engineers (SBSE) re
cently won the National Distin
guished Chapter of the Year award
for the National Society of Black En
gineers (NSBE). This is the second
year in a row the group has won the
award, a success that many attribute
to the organization's dedicated
members and outstanding programs.
The NSBE, founded in 1975, con
sists of over 270 chapters on different
college campuses. The organization
aims to encourage student interest in
engineering and the sciences at both
undergraduate and graduate levels.
It also serves as a representative
body on issues affecting black engi
neers and scientists.
"NSBE is uplifting the black com
munity and fostering a network of
success in the black community on a
huge scale," said SBSE Programs
Chair John Norris, a junior.

The Stanford Chapter of NSBE
includes over 100 students, both un
dergraduate and graduate, of all
races. Students in the group have ma
jors ranging from product design to
anthropological sciences.
Members of the group maintain
that SBSE won the Distinguished

Chapter award for the second year in
a row due to its dedication to the
NSBE mission: "To increase the
number of culturally responsible
Black engineers who excel academi
cally, succeed professionally and pos
itively impact the community."
Junior Marcelo Worsley, presi

dent of the SBSE, explained that the
SBSE strives to accomplish this mis
sion through its numerous programs.
"The programs that SBSE has in
place are aligned to execute this mis
sion, and more importantly, the ef
fort that is put into ensuring that
these programs are effective are

what set Stanford apart," Worsley
said.
The organization offers a wide va
riety of on and off-campus programs
ranging from resume-writing work
shops to corporate mentorship expe
riences. It also provides various re
sources for its members, such as
scholarships, summer internships
and research opportunities.
One main activity is the weekly
SBSE meetings, during which suc
cessful scientists and engineers from
Silicon Valley discuss the opportuni
ties available in their fields today.
Additionally. SBSE furthers its
mission by tutoring local middle
school and high school students.
These programs are designed not
only to help younger students excel in
science, math and computer skills, but
also to provide students with confi
dence and encouragement for apply
ing to universities like Stanford.
"After they get to know us. they
begin to see that they are fully capa
ble of being Stanford students, and I
think that might be one of the most
important things SBSE does," Wors
ley said. "It gives some of these high
school and middle school students a
Stanford figure that they can identify
and relate with."
Worsley also pointed out that the
group's success would not be possi

ble without its dedicated members
and outstanding advisors. Mechani
cal Engineering Prof. Reginald
Mitchell and Associate Dean of Stu
dents and Diversity Affairs Noe
Lonazo.
"Whether it is through volunteer
ing, participating in the date auction,
mentoring students at Eastside Prep
or interacting with professional engi
neers and scientists, our members
take it to the next level," Worsley
said.
Senior Chris Hartfield said that
he believes that the people in SBSE
have worked hard and earned the
award.
"1 think that the reason for that
high honor is the amount of hard
work and dedication that the mem
bers and officers of Stanford SBSE
put in on a daily basis," he said.
Members of SBSE say that the or
ganization will continue to dedicate
itself to its mission and provide a net
work for students interested in sci
ence and engineering.
"1 am in SBSE to use this incredi
ble network to maximize the success
of the chapter members, including
myself." Norris said. "As much as the
chapter has done, we can do even
more.That's what is great â€” it seems
like we're only getting started with
what we can do."
