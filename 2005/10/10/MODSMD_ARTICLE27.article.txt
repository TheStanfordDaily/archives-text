## Approximately 7,500 Stanford alums and their families will arrive for annual Homecoming 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
In less than two weeks the Farm
will get another horde of starry eyed
visitors in addition to the typical visit
ing high school students and interna
tional tourists.
These 7,500 guests, both young
and old, will be trying to relive, in the
space of one weekend, the four years
they spent at Stanford long ago.They
will be attending the Reunion
I lomecoming Weekend, where grad
uating classes from as recently as
2000 and as long ago as 1950 will be
coming together again.
The reunion kicks off on October
20 with events designed to get the

alumni reacquainted with campus.
There will be campus walking tours, a
sculpture tour and what the Alumni
Center calls "Classes Without
Quizzes," which are classes by a vari
ety of Stanford professors.
The day culminates in "Dinner on
the Quad," where the Main Quad is
lighted and the alumni are seated by
class fora dinner under the stars.
Moses Pound, class of '04 and a
registrar at the Alumni Center, com
mented on the alumni's reaction to
seeing the campus again for the first
time in years.
"You hear stories about buildings
that have moved from where they
used to be," Pound said. "Not demol
ished and rebuilt, just picked up and
moved. It's interesting to see the cam
pus through the eyes of someone else
and see how different campus was."
In these four days there will be a
plethora of other events like the foot
ball tailgates, events sponsored by the
cultural centers, parties and panels for
each class and dorm mini-reunions.

"When I was a freshman, living in
Branner, my roommates were just
sitting around in our room during the
reunion and some folks came by and
said 'we lived here twenty years ago,"
said Pound.
"They started to talk about the
first time someone in their dorm got
a personal computer and how excit
ing it was,"he said. "No one had ever
seen a desktop personal computer
before. They put it out in the hallway
and ran extension cords out and it
was just blowing their minds how
cool it was."
Patricia Knoll,class of'6s, who is
one of the alumni volunteers, re
called her experiences at previous re
unions.
"It tends to be a lot of fun times,"
Knoll said. "Not people banding to
gether like they did in school but
going out to find new people. So it
tends to be a nice mix."
According to Leslie Winick,event
director, the reunions have experi
enced a huge surge in attendance in

recent years. This year the organizers
expect nearly 35% of the included
classes to attend.
"If you look at attendance over
the last ten years, we used to get
about 23% of a class, which is what a
lot of universities get," said Winick.
"But over the last teh years the Uni
versity has really put some energy
into this, and now we get about a
third of the class back."
Winick also encouraged current
students to take part in Reunion
Homecoming activities.
"We do tailgates for all the class
es 0f'06,'07,'08, and '09 amidst all the
other alumni," she said. "That's one
way we can build a sense amongst
students that, even when they leave,
there will be a time of year when they
can come back."
When asked if he would consider
coming back to his future reunions,
senior Anthony Viola said,"l'd really
like to. I think it'd be really great to
come back and see everyone. I'd like
to go to all of them I think, ideally."

unions.
"It tends to be a lot of fun times,"
Knoll said. "Not people banding to
gether like they did in school but
going out to find new people. So it
tends to be a nice mix."
According to Leslie Winick,event
director, the reunions have experi
enced a huge surge in attendance in

recent years. This year the organizers
expect nearly 35% of the included
classes to attend.
"If you look at attendance over
the last ten years, we used to get
about 23% of a class, which is what a
lot of universities get," said Winick.
"But over the last teh years the Uni
versity has really put some energy
into this, and now we get about a
third of the class back."
Winick also encouraged current
students to take part in Reunion
Homecoming activities.
"We do tailgates for all the class
es 0f'06,'07,'08, and '09 amidst all the
other alumni," she said. "That's one
way we can build a sense amongst
students that, even when they leave,
there will be a time of year when they
can come back."
When asked if he would consider
coming back to his future reunions,
senior Anthony Viola said,"l'd really
like to. I think it'd be really great to
come back and see everyone. I'd like
to go to all of them I think, ideally."
