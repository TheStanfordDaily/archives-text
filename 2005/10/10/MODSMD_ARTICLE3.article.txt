The Stanford Racing Team's driverless
Volkswagen Touareg, fondly dubbed Stan
ley, braved the harsh terrain of the Mojave
Desert, winning the Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand
Challenge, a race to develop fully au
tonomous vehicles, this past Saturday. Stan
ley completed the 132-mile course with a
time of 6:53:08 — averaging over 19 miles
per hour on the course — and bringing
home the $2 million prize.
According to Computer Science Prof. Se
bastian Thrun, the racing team's project
leader, this success not only means a lot in
terms of defense technology, but it also
changes the face of modern transportation.
"Cars will eventually drive themselves,"
Thrun said in an interview with The Daily.
"Over 43,000 people die in automobile acci
dents a year. Many lives will be saved with
the future of autonomous vehicles. 1 think
that within 50 years — maybe even 30 — we
will see this new technology in our everyday
