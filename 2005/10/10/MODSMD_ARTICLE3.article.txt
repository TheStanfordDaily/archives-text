# Race to the future
## Autonomous car comes in first place 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Racing Team's driverless
Volkswagen Touareg, fondly dubbed Stan
ley, braved the harsh terrain of the Mojave
Desert, winning the Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand
Challenge, a race to develop fully au
tonomous vehicles, this past Saturday. Stan
ley completed the 132-mile course with a
time of 6:53:08 — averaging over 19 miles
per hour on the course — and bringing
home the $2 million prize.
According to Computer Science Prof. Se
bastian Thrun, the racing team's project
leader, this success not only means a lot in
terms of defense technology, but it also
changes the face of modern transportation.
"Cars will eventually drive themselves,"
Thrun said in an interview with The Daily.
"Over 43,000 people die in automobile acci
dents a year. Many lives will be saved with
the future of autonomous vehicles. 1 think
that within 50 years — maybe even 30 — we
will see this new technology in our everyday

The driverless Volkswagen Touareg, Stanley, may foreshadow the future of automobiles.
lives."
DARPA has sponsored the
Grand Challenge since the first race
— held in 2004 — with the goal of
accelerating the development of au
tonomous vehicles. It is DARPA's
hope that this challenge will catalyze
the research needed to meet a con
gressional mandate of converting 30

percent of the military's vehicles into
robots by 2015.
Already, drastic improvements
have been made. Last year's compe
tition saw no car complete the
course. This year, of the 23 finalists
competing Saturday, five crossed the
finish line. Carnegie Mellon's Sand
storm Humvee finished in second
place, almost 11 minutes behind
Stanford's vehicle,
Mike Montemerlo, in charge of
Stanley's software package, told The
Los Angeles Times that what sepa
rated Stanford's vehicle from the rest

was both testing experience and soft
ware that gave Stanley the ability to
make good spontaneous decisions.
"We spent the last two months in
the desert in Arizona," said Monte
merlo, who is also a research associ
ate working in the Stanford Artificial
Intelligence Lab, said. He earned his
Ph.D. in robotics at Carnegie Mellon
University in 2003 and was cheering
on CMU at the Grand Challenge last
year.
"The team started the project
here at Stanford last July," Thrun
said. Stanley operates using Global
Positioning System sensors, a radar
system, cameras and other features

to help it detect its surroundings and
maneuver around obstacles.
While Stanley will find a new
home in a museum in Germany, re
search will certainly continue here at
Stanford.
"Stanford is a top-notch engi
neering school, and this success will
bring a lot to this university. It brings
inspiration and excitement," Thrun
said. "We're at a point in time similar
to the first flight. No one thought it
was possible. Challenging things can
be done. And as an educator, I am
eager to see this put into course ma
terials, and used in the classroom.
This is a very exciting time."
