# CAMPUS LIFE
## Group organizes earthquake relief effort 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pakistanis at Stanford (PAS) will
hold a meeting today with the Office
of Student Activities in hopes of start
ing a campus-wide drive to raise
money for victims of the worst earth
quake in Pakistan's history that struck
near the Pakistan-India border on
Saturday, Oct. 8 with a magnitude
measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale.
Junior Uzair Nasim, a member of
PAS, has taken charge of coordinat
ing relief efforts throughout the
campus. A meeting took place Satur
day where members shared initial
ideas about how to structure and
carry out the drive, but Nasim said
he expects today's meeting to be
much more formal.
"It is all at a very preliminary
stage," he said.
Several of the organizations that
Nasim hopes to get in contact with
are the Haas center for Public Ser
vice, the Muslim Students Aware
ness Network, the Islamic Society of
Stanford University and the Hidaya
Foundation.
Nasim plans to model his efforts
after the tsunami relief drive that
took place last year. He will be ask
ing for donations and collaborating
with other student groups with the
aim of eventually receiving match
ing grants from the University
Provost's Office.
For now, the main goal is to raise
as much money as possible. Nasim
said that he is working on setting up
a Web site where students can obtain
information about making fiscal
contributions or helping out in other
ways. Later on, he hopes to go from
dorm to dorm and set up a booth in
White Plaza. Once more specif
ic needs are known, Nasim and oth
ers will be taking donations such as
books, medicine, clothes and other
supplies â€” but there is currently a
lack of information about exactly
what people need most.
"Most of the relief efforts are
being hampered by the fact that the
majority of the area hit by the quake is
rural," said sophomore Muzammal
Ashraf, a PAS member. "The terrain
isn't very easy for relief efforts either."
Ashraf. who is from Lahore, Pak
istan, said that downed communica
tion systems are also causing many
problems. One friend of his, who is
from Mansera but lives in Lahore,
was unable to reach his family and
decided to head straight for the vil
lage. Telephone lines are down in
most northern areas, and he still does
not know whether his family is safe.
Nasim emphasized that right
now there is no actual relief effort
on campus, and that his plans are still
fairly tentative. He is confident,
however, that the effort will be
arranged and active very soon.
"If it looks disorganized that's
only because people are still trying
to put things together," he said. "It
will just take a few days to organize
everything."
