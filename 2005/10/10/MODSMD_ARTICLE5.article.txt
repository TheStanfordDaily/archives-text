### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
In February 2005, the Faculty Senate ap
proved changes to the General Education
Requirements (GERs) for undergraduates,
which became effective this Fall Quarter.
According to an e-mail sent last week, stu
dents matriculating in the Fall 2004-2005 or
later — primarily freshmen and sophomores
— will be subject to the new GERs effective
Fall Quarter 2005; students matriculating Fall
2003-2004 or earlier — primarily juniors and
seniors — will be subject to the old GERs, un
less they file a permanent decision to change
to the new system with the Office of the Uni
versity Registrar.
Transfer students are subject to the same
GERs as students who entered as freshmen,
according to University Registrar Roger
Printup.
"A transfer student who entered Stanford
in Fall 2004-2005 will be subject to the new
GERs," Printup said in an interview with The
Daily. "TVansfer students admitted prior to

Fall 2004-2005 are subject to the old require
ments hut have the option to switch to the
new requirements."
Under the old GERs, students were re
quired to complete courses in four areas: In
troduction to the Humanities (IHUM); Nat
ural Sciences, Applied Science and Technolo
gy and Mathematics; Humanities and Social
Sciences; and World Cultures, American Cul
tures and Gender Studies.The new GERs are
in three subject areas: Introduction to the Hu
manities; Disciplinary Breadth (Engineering
and Applied Sciences. Humanities. Mathe
matics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences);
and Education for Citizenship (Ethical Rea
soning. the Global Community. American
Cultures, and Gender Studies).
Students under the new system are al
lowed to double-count courses in Education
for Citizenship with those offered in the Hu
manities and Social Sciences subject areas of
Disciplinary Breadth.
"The new requirements have one more
option that students may use to fulfill the Ed
ucation for Citizenship requirement — the

Ethical Reasoning option," Printup said.
"Currently, there are only a few courses of
fered that fulfill the Ethical Reasoning op
tion. but I expect that the number of courses
