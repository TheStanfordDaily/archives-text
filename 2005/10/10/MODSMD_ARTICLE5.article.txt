# New GER changes take effect this fall
## 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
In February 2005, the Faculty Senate ap
proved changes to the General Education
Requirements (GERs) for undergraduates,
which became effective this Fall Quarter.
According to an e-mail sent last week, stu
dents matriculating in the Fall 2004-2005 or
later — primarily freshmen and sophomores
— will be subject to the new GERs effective
Fall Quarter 2005; students matriculating Fall
2003-2004 or earlier — primarily juniors and
seniors — will be subject to the old GERs, un
less they file a permanent decision to change
to the new system with the Office of the Uni
versity Registrar.
Transfer students are subject to the same
GERs as students who entered as freshmen,
according to University Registrar Roger
Printup.
"A transfer student who entered Stanford
in Fall 2004-2005 will be subject to the new
GERs," Printup said in an interview with The
Daily. "TVansfer students admitted prior to

Fall 2004-2005 are subject to the old require
ments hut have the option to switch to the
new requirements."
Under the old GERs, students were re
quired to complete courses in four areas: In
troduction to the Humanities (IHUM); Nat
ural Sciences, Applied Science and Technolo
gy and Mathematics; Humanities and Social
Sciences; and World Cultures, American Cul
tures and Gender Studies.The new GERs are
in three subject areas: Introduction to the Hu
manities; Disciplinary Breadth (Engineering
and Applied Sciences. Humanities. Mathe
matics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences);
and Education for Citizenship (Ethical Rea
soning. the Global Community. American
Cultures, and Gender Studies).
Students under the new system are al
lowed to double-count courses in Education
for Citizenship with those offered in the Hu
manities and Social Sciences subject areas of
Disciplinary Breadth.
"The new requirements have one more
option that students may use to fulfill the Ed
ucation for Citizenship requirement — the

Ethical Reasoning option," Printup said.
"Currently, there are only a few courses of
fered that fulfill the Ethical Reasoning op
tion. but I expect that the number of courses

The General Education Requirements have
changed for the Class of 2008 and onwards
available will increase over the
next few years."
Moreover, the new system re
duces the GERs by one course. Phi
losophy Prof. Christopher
Bobonich, chair of the Subcommit
tee on GERs for the Faculty Sen
ate, believes that this change will
provide greater freedom of choice
for students, especially those with
majors having high numbers of re
quired units.
The undergraduate Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) re
quirement is not affected by the
changes to the GERs. According to
Geophysics Prof. Rosemary
Knight, the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion will be reviewing all GERs
along with IHUM and PWR over

the next two years.
Printup also stated that the Uni
versity will not be moving toward a
policy requiring that every class of
fered should fit a GER.
"To be used as a GER, a course
must be offered fora minimum of
three units," Printup said. "In ad
dition, students must take courses
fora regular letter grade, not for
Credit/No credit or
Satisfactory/No credit grades. De
partments retain the option of not
having their courses be used to
ward a GER requirement if they
so choose."
Some students, such as sopho
more Kathryn Ludwig. are not di
rectly affected by the changes,
since they have only taken one or
two areas of the four requirements
from the old system.
"I don't really understand why
they even made the change," Lud
wig said. "The new categories are
kind of confusing, and they didn't
really change the actual require

ments very much at all. It's annoy
ing to have to refer to the bulletin
to figure out which of the old re
quirements DB-Hum or EC-
Global Com refers to. 2a, 3c and
4b were just easier to remember."
Knight, who serves as the chair
of the Committee on Undergradu
ate Standards and Policy for the
Faculty Senate, fully supports the
changes to the GERs.
•'These changes were needed to
simplify the system and make
clearer to students the academic
rationale for the inclusion of spe
cific requirements or courses,"
Knight said. "My hope is that stu
dents will now better understand
why we have these general educa
tion requirements. One of the most
important things we do, as a univer
sity, is to define our general educa
tion requirements. Our choice of
these core requirements communi
cates to our students, and to the
world, what we consider to be es
sential to education."

changes to the GERs. According to
Geophysics Prof. Rosemary
Knight, the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion will be reviewing all GERs
along with IHUM and PWR over

the next two years.
Printup also stated that the Uni
versity will not be moving toward a
policy requiring that every class of
fered should fit a GER.
"To be used as a GER, a course
must be offered fora minimum of
three units," Printup said. "In ad
dition, students must take courses
fora regular letter grade, not for
Credit/No credit or
Satisfactory/No credit grades. De
partments retain the option of not
having their courses be used to
ward a GER requirement if they
so choose."
Some students, such as sopho
more Kathryn Ludwig. are not di
rectly affected by the changes,
since they have only taken one or
two areas of the four requirements
from the old system.
"I don't really understand why
they even made the change," Lud
wig said. "The new categories are
kind of confusing, and they didn't
really change the actual require

ments very much at all. It's annoy
ing to have to refer to the bulletin
to figure out which of the old re
quirements DB-Hum or EC-
Global Com refers to. 2a, 3c and
4b were just easier to remember."
Knight, who serves as the chair
of the Committee on Undergradu
ate Standards and Policy for the
Faculty Senate, fully supports the
changes to the GERs.
•'These changes were needed to
simplify the system and make
clearer to students the academic
rationale for the inclusion of spe
cific requirements or courses,"
Knight said. "My hope is that stu
dents will now better understand
why we have these general educa
tion requirements. One of the most
important things we do, as a univer
sity, is to define our general educa
tion requirements. Our choice of
these core requirements communi
cates to our students, and to the
world, what we consider to be es
sential to education."
In February 2005, the Faculty Senate ap
proved changes to the General Education
Requirements (GERs) for undergraduates,
which became effective this Fall Quarter.
According to an e-mail sent last week, stu
dents matriculating in the Fall 2004-2005 or
later — primarily freshmen and sophomores
— will be subject to the new GERs effective
Fall Quarter 2005; students matriculating Fall
2003-2004 or earlier — primarily juniors and
seniors — will be subject to the old GERs, un
less they file a permanent decision to change
to the new system with the Office of the Uni
versity Registrar.
Transfer students are subject to the same
GERs as students who entered as freshmen,
according to University Registrar Roger
Printup.
"A transfer student who entered Stanford
in Fall 2004-2005 will be subject to the new
GERs," Printup said in an interview with The
Daily. "TVansfer students admitted prior to

Fall 2004-2005 are subject to the old require
ments hut have the option to switch to the
new requirements."
Under the old GERs, students were re
quired to complete courses in four areas: In
troduction to the Humanities (IHUM); Nat
ural Sciences, Applied Science and Technolo
gy and Mathematics; Humanities and Social
Sciences; and World Cultures, American Cul
tures and Gender Studies.The new GERs are
in three subject areas: Introduction to the Hu
manities; Disciplinary Breadth (Engineering
and Applied Sciences. Humanities. Mathe
matics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences);
and Education for Citizenship (Ethical Rea
soning. the Global Community. American
Cultures, and Gender Studies).
Students under the new system are al
lowed to double-count courses in Education
for Citizenship with those offered in the Hu
manities and Social Sciences subject areas of
Disciplinary Breadth.
"The new requirements have one more
option that students may use to fulfill the Ed
ucation for Citizenship requirement — the

Ethical Reasoning option," Printup said.
"Currently, there are only a few courses of
fered that fulfill the Ethical Reasoning op
tion. but I expect that the number of courses

changed for the Class of 2008 and onwards
available will increase over the
next few years."
Moreover, the new system re
duces the GERs by one course. Phi
losophy Prof. Christopher
Bobonich, chair of the Subcommit
tee on GERs for the Faculty Sen
ate, believes that this change will
provide greater freedom of choice
for students, especially those with
majors having high numbers of re
quired units.
