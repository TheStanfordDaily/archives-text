## ASSU plans to improve Course Guide Web site, solicit student class surveys 
### ANDREW BURMON 
"This was the best class," reads an
anonymous student evaluation of a history
course posted on the ASSU Course

Guide Web site.
"The material is'
very interesting and
Prof. Holloway is in
credibly kind and
knows so much about
nuclear weapons!"

Prof. David Hol
loway's class, "The

Challenge of Nuclear

Weapons," is one of only four class

es in the History Department reviewed
on the ASSU Course Guide site. Set up
years ago as a tool for confused students
looking for suggestions on courses to
take, the Course Guide has a legacy of

being "atrocious and inaccurate," said
sophomore Kai Lukoff.an ASSU senator
who has been involved with the upcom
ing revamp of the Web site.
The site, http://courseguide.stanford.edu,
currently presents users with an inconsis

tently functional and com

plicated search engine
under the banner
"Course Guide Beta."

Some new students sav

the site is poorly publicized.
"To be honest," said freshman Danny
Kane.'T had no idea it existed."
According to the ASSU, however, the
Web site is in the process of being over
hauled.
Lukoff, who described updating the
guide as one of his major goals for the

ASSU, promised that the site would
soon be "reliable, correct and cur
rent."
"The Course Guide should be the
online Oxford English Dictionary
for students shopping courses â€” a
definitive source of information,"
Lukoff said.
The new Web site will be de
signed by CollegeNET, the company
that created Stanford's online sched
uling system.
The Registrar's office will be tak
ing over the job of maintaining com
ments on the site from Tau Beta Pi,
an electrical engineering fraternity
that had used the job as a means of
fundraising. According to University
Registrar Roger Printup, the new
site will hopefully be operational
during winter quarter.
Printup explained that the student
questionnaire forms passed out at the
end of courses will "not be changing,"
but students will have access to the
"exact same information as faculty."
According to Lukoff, the new
Web site will allow students un
precedented access to qualitative

data collected during the end of the
year evaluations, but its success will
hinge on student's willingness to ac
tually fill out the evaluations. With
out filled-out surveys, the Course
Guide will remain incomprehensive
and outdated.
Lukoff said he hopes that having
a functional Course Guide will pro
vide students with incentive to accu
rately review their classes. Other
wise, the site will fail to achieve legit
imacy and garner credibility from
the faculty.
Many students, however, said
they will still continue to appraise
classes by attending them during the
shopping period, rather than relying
on the Course Guide.
"I evaluate on my own opinion,"
said sophomore Sam Shrank. "I'm
more interested in what I think
about a class than what previous stu
dents thought."
