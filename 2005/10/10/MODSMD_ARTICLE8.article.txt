## WORLD Hurricane hits Central America 
### SERGIO DE LEON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GUATEMALA CITY —With
food and water running out, gov
ernments in Central America and
Mexico scrambled Friday to reach
isolated areas devastated by a week
of intense rain, with residents say
ing panic was starting to grow
among survivors.
Mudslides and flooding exacer
bated by Hurricane Stan killed 277
people across the region, with
Guatemala bearing the brunt of the
damage and deaths.
Officials pulled 67 bodies from a
mountain of mud that buried sev
eral towns near Lake Atitlan, an
area popular with tourists 100
miles west of the capital,
Guatemala City, and expected to
find many more despite search ef
forts marred by continued rains.
Increasing fears Friday was a
strong earthquake that shuddered
through Guatemala and El Sal
vador. The quake caused a rain
damaged highway bridge to col
lapse in Guatemala and sent thou
sands of frightened Salvadoran res
idents into the streets.
There were no immediate re
ports of injuries from the quake,
with a preliminary magnitude of
5.8. Telephone service was cut off
briefly in some areas of El Sal
vador, and Interior Minister Rene
Figueroa urged residents to obey

evacuation orders for high-risk
areas.
The quake also forced officials
to suspend their search for two cof
fee workers missing since Saturday
when the Ilamatepec volcano
erupted about 40 miles west of the
capital, San Salvador.
The earthquake struck before
residents had even begun to recov
er from five days of heavy rains,
which included Hurricane Stan's
landfall on Tuesday in Mexico's
Gulf Coast state of Veracruz before
it weakened into a tropical depres
sion.
"We need food, clothing, medi
cine and help," said Lucas Ajpus, a
former firefighter coordinating res
cue efforts in Santiago Atitlan, the

Guatemalan city near landslides
that hit four villages.
A total of 177 people have been
confirmed killed in Guatemala, but
Benedicto Giron, a spokesman for
the National Agency for Disaster
Reduction, said villagers reported
"200 or 300 people buried."
In Pathulul, 30 miles away from
Santiago Atitlan, creeks that nor
mally stream down from the high
lands had turned into raging rivers,
cluttered with rocks, branches and
chunks of debris.
Guatemalan officials organized
an air-rescue squad of their own
helicopters as well as those lent by
the United States and neighboring
Mexico, but poor weather prevent
ed them from taking off until Fri

day.
Residents and tourists in Pana
jachel, on the banks of Lake Atit
lan, said they needed aid.
"Water is running out, food is
running out and looters are coming
now," said Stephanie Jolluck, a 32-
year-old businesswoman from At
lanta who was reached by tele
phone.
Jolluck, who has traveled to
Guatemala for work since 1999, de
scribed watching rivers grow from
their usual width of 6 feet to more
than 50 feet.
In the western province of San
Marcos, on the border with Mexico,
residents cut off by floods have
been pleading for help in telephone
calls to radio stations.
