## New Orleans police face criminal investigation 
### MARY FOSTER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — At
least one police officer repeatedly
punched a 64-year-old man accused
of public intoxication, and another
officer assaulted an Associated Press
Television News producer as a cam
eraman taped the confrontations.
There will be a criminal investiga
tion, and three New Orleans Police
Department officers will be sus
pended yesterday, arrested and
charged with simple battery, Capt.
Marlon Defillo said.
"We have great concern with
what we saw this morning," Defillo
said after he and about a dozen other
high-ranking police department offi
cials watched the APTN footage
Sunday. "It's a troubling tape, no
doubt about it. This department will
take immediate action."
The assaults come as the depart
ment, long plagued by allegations of
brutality and corruption, struggles
with the aftermath of Hurricane Ka
trina and the resignation last month
of Police Superintendent Eddie
Compass.
The APTN tape shows an officer
hitting the man at least four times in
the head Saturday night as he stood
outside a bar. The suspect, Robert
Davis, appeared to resist, twisting
and flailing as he was dragged to the
ground by four officers. Another of
ficer then kneed Davis and punched
him twice. Davis was face-down on
the sidewalk with blood streaming
down his arm and into the gutter.
Meanwhile, an officer ordered
APTN producer Rich Matthews and
the cameraman to stop recording.
When Matthews held up his creden

tials and explained he was working,
the officer grabbed the producer,
leaned him backward over a car,
jabbed him in the stomach and un
leashed a profanity-laced tirade.
"I've been here for six weeks try
ing to keep alive. Go home!" shout
ed the officer, who later identified
himself as S.M. Smith.
Police said Davis, 64, of New Or
leans, was booked on public intoxica
tion, resisting arrest, battery on a po
lice officer and public intimidation.
Davis, who is black, was subdued
at the intersection of Conti and
Bourbon streets. Three of the offi
cers appeared to be white, and the
other was light skinned. Defillo said
race was not an issue.
Three of the five officers involved
were New Orleans officers, and two
others appeared to be federal offi
cers. Numerous agencies have sent
police to help with patrols in the af
termath of Katrina.
Under normal circumstances, it
takes unusually offensive behavior
to trigger an arrest on Bourbon
Street. But New Orleans police have
been working under stressful condi
tions since the hurricane.
Officers slept in their cars and
worked 24-hour shifts after the
storm. Three-quarters lost their
homes and their families are scat
tered across the country.
Many officers deserted their
posts in the days after Katrina, and
some were accused of joining in the
looting that broke out. At least two
committed suicide.
Conditions have improved — of
ficers now have beds on a cruise Ship
— but they don't have private rooms
and are still working five, 12-hour
days.
