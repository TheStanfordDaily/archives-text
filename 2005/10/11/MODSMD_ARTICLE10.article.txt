## New Intel chip allows faster server processing 
### MATTHEW FORDAHL ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN JOSE, Calif. — Months ear
lier than expected but still half a year
behind its competition, Intel Corp.
has started shipping server multi
processors that have two computing
engines on a single chip.
The new dual-core Xeon chips for
two-processor servers promise up to
a 50 percent improvement over sys
tems with two single-core proces
sors, said Shannon Poulin, director of
product marketing at Intel's Server
Platform Group.
Both Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. launched dual-core
chips this year as a way of gaining
performance while controlling
power consumption. AMD initially
focused on servers while Intel
started with chips for desktop com
puters.
As a result, the new Xeon is arriving
about six months after AMD's dual
core Opteron chip made its debut.
"We are very committed to en
abling the industry for dual- and
multi-core, and that's why we were
taking a very measured approach to
getting these out there and putting
them in platforms," Poulin said.
But Intel's hand was forced when
it decided to switch from releasing
higher-frequency chips to those with
two or more computing engines, said
Gordon Haff, an analyst at the re
search firm Illuminata.
"Intel did not sit back and inten
tionally plan to roll out first a dual
core desktop and then a server," he
said. "It's what their technology
forced them to do when Intel decided
to accelerate dual-core develop
ment."

AMD has managed to make in
roads in servers, which are used for
Web sites, applications and storage.
Its market share jumped from 7.4
percent in the first quarter to 11.2
percent in the second, according to
Mercury' Research.
Intel still dominates with an 88.8
percent share in so-called xB6
servers. It also plans to price its
chips aggressively — at or lower
than single-core server chips. The
new Xeons cost $1,043 each when
bought in volume.
Intel originally intended to
launch the dual-core Xeon early
next year but was able to move earli
er than expected. Poulin credited
"exquisite engineering," though
AMD said its larger rival rushed be
cause of the stiff competition.
"We've been keeping the chair
warm and we welcome them to the
party we started back in April,"
said Patrick Patla, AMD's director
of server and workstation market
ing.
As has been the case with Intel's
desktop dual-core processors, AMD
claims its chips were designed from
the start with dual-core use in mind.
Intel, AMD claims, took existing
chips and bolted them together.
"It's pretty much a no-show from
a performance and technology per
spective," Patla said. "Intel is talking
a good story about next-generation
architectures, but they haven't really
done anything about it."
Intel's chips will benefit from an
ability to handle two tasks, or
threads, at once using a technology
called Hyper-Threading. As a result,
a two-core Xeon chip in a two
processor server can execute eight
threads.
