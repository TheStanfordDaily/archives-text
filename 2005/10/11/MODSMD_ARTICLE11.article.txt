## ResComp and ITSS strive for balance 
### MATTHEW GRIBBLE 
Several aspects of the Information
Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS) and Residential Computing

(ResComp) departments have changed
this year, and many students say they are dis
satisfied with the new policies — in particular,
the introduction of an automatic telecommu
nications fee on the student bill.
Academic Computing personnel stand be
hind their decision, reasoning that they con
sulted with students as they reviewed the sys
tem.
"Ninety-eight percent of students sub
scribed to the network in the residences," says
Lois Brooks, director of Academic Comput
ing. "When we wanted to change the way we
did it, what we did was go out to the students,
work with the ASSU and hold town halls."
Brooks adds that "it worked really well as a
collaborative process."
But sophomore Craig Harbick falls in the
other two percent and expresses his exaspera
tion with the change.
"I end up paying money now that 1 never
paid before, because I don't own a computer,"
Harbick says. "Now that IT charges are auto
matically added to tuition, my bills have gone
up, yet I don't subscribe to the internet service,
nor do I ever use the land-line phone. So what
am I paying for?"
While students like Harbick may be justi
fied in feeling duped, ResComp insists that the
new policy is reasonable and that little extra
money is flowing into the departments.
"ResComp is funded almost entirely by stu
dents' board bills and telecommunication
fees," Brooks says, adding that printing
charges incurred in computing clusters barely
cover the cost of paper and toner.
"How much we charge is calculated from
how much it costs, so I think it's safe to say that
the costs are appropriate," Brooks asserts.
Funding for ResComp and ITSS is a tricky
subject because it is unclear which goods and
services are essential and which are necessary.
"Once the basic needs like printing have
been covered, then interests become different,"
Brooks explains. "Students aren't generic."
And generic or otherwise, satisfying the
constant demands of students has drawn at
tention away from taking on new projects.
I think we're getting it all done," says Ethan
Rikleen. network and systems administrator
for ResComp. "But [as a result] we don't have
time to experiment with cool new things."
"We're worrying about the cluster of the
present, not the clusters of the future," he
adds.
Rikleen alsp remarks that increased fund
ing for ResComp would be much appreciated.
"No, our funding isn't sufficient," he says.
"The role of technology in student life has
grown considerably and we're having trouble
keeping pace."
Stanford often hires student workers to
help shoulder the burdens of keeping the
school's multi-million-dollar tech sector
afloat. Academic Computing, which manages
ResComp, currently employs 160 students —
usually as Resident Computing Consultants
(RCCs).
In light of Stanford's tight budget. Rikleen
says he wishes the RCCs could be paid more.
"I think we should pay them what they
have to turn around and pay in rent [and other
living costs]," Rikleen says.
Furthermore, he suggests that if given
more money, Academic Computing would
immediately hire two more full-time em
ployees.
"Right now we've got one staff member
managing five hundred devices in seventy
seven locations," he explains."lt would be bet
ter to have one person managing the hard
ware and spaces (the actual computer cluster
rooms) and another handling the software
image."
In addition to complaints about the new
telecommunications bill, a number of students
— particularly graduate students — have
raised concerns about recent system perform
ance. Most of their qualms have related to se
curity issues, such as major virus outbreaks.
"Responses vary by concern, but we do try
to respond," Brooks says.
And Bill Clebsch, executive director of
ITSS, assures us its major services — includ
ing the omnipresent Axess — are nearly fool
proof.
"At this point, system-up time is 99.9 per
cent for almost all of the systems and I think
that's adequate." Clebsch says."The phones
and network are even better."
Meanwhile, a lingering area of concern is
the compatibility of Mac-Leland with Tiger,
the latest version of Mac OS X. Clebsch him
self runs both Tiger and Mac-Leland.
He concedes that one vital piece is missing
from the otherwise functional program —
Andrew File System (AFS) support.
"There's never going to be sufficient staff
to handle everything," he says. "Stanford's ap
petite for IT is large, as is true of any presti
gious university. In the long run, the Universi
ty will find the right balance amongst the com
peting priorities to deliver these services. It's
an interesting dance right now."

more money, Academic Computing would
immediately hire two more full-time em
ployees.
"Right now we've got one staff member
managing five hundred devices in seventy
seven locations," he explains."lt would be bet
ter to have one person managing the hard
ware and spaces (the actual computer cluster
rooms) and another handling the software
image."
In addition to complaints about the new
telecommunications bill, a number of students
— particularly graduate students — have
raised concerns about recent system perform
ance. Most of their qualms have related to se
curity issues, such as major virus outbreaks.
"Responses vary by concern, but we do try
to respond," Brooks says.
And Bill Clebsch, executive director of
ITSS, assures us its major services — includ
ing the omnipresent Axess — are nearly fool
proof.
"At this point, system-up time is 99.9 per
cent for almost all of the systems and I think
that's adequate." Clebsch says."The phones
and network are even better."
Meanwhile, a lingering area of concern is
the compatibility of Mac-Leland with Tiger,
the latest version of Mac OS X. Clebsch him
self runs both Tiger and Mac-Leland.
He concedes that one vital piece is missing
from the otherwise functional program —
Andrew File System (AFS) support.
"There's never going to be sufficient staff
to handle everything," he says. "Stanford's ap
petite for IT is large, as is true of any presti
gious university. In the long run, the Universi
ty will find the right balance amongst the com
peting priorities to deliver these services. It's
an interesting dance right now."
Several aspects of the Information
Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS) and Residential Computing

(ResComp) departments have changed
this year, and many students say they are dis
satisfied with the new policies — in particular,
the introduction of an automatic telecommu
nications fee on the student bill.
Academic Computing personnel stand be
hind their decision, reasoning that they con
sulted with students as they reviewed the sys
tem.
"Ninety-eight percent of students sub
scribed to the network in the residences," says
Lois Brooks, director of Academic Comput
ing. "When we wanted to change the way we
did it, what we did was go out to the students,
work with the ASSU and hold town halls."
Brooks adds that "it worked really well as a
collaborative process."
But sophomore Craig Harbick falls in the
other two percent and expresses his exaspera
tion with the change.
"I end up paying money now that 1 never
paid before, because I don't own a computer,"
Harbick says. "Now that IT charges are auto
matically added to tuition, my bills have gone
up, yet I don't subscribe to the internet service,
nor do I ever use the land-line phone. So what
am I paying for?"
While students like Harbick may be justi
fied in feeling duped, ResComp insists that the
new policy is reasonable and that little extra
money is flowing into the departments.
"ResComp is funded almost entirely by stu
dents' board bills and telecommunication
fees," Brooks says, adding that printing
charges incurred in computing clusters barely
cover the cost of paper and toner.
"How much we charge is calculated from
how much it costs, so I think it's safe to say that
the costs are appropriate," Brooks asserts.
Funding for ResComp and ITSS is a tricky
subject because it is unclear which goods and
services are essential and which are necessary.
"Once the basic needs like printing have
been covered, then interests become different,"
Brooks explains. "Students aren't generic."
And generic or otherwise, satisfying the
constant demands of students has drawn at
tention away from taking on new projects.
I think we're getting it all done," says Ethan
Rikleen. network and systems administrator
for ResComp. "But [as a result] we don't have
time to experiment with cool new things."
"We're worrying about the cluster of the
present, not the clusters of the future," he
adds.
Rikleen alsp remarks that increased fund
ing for ResComp would be much appreciated.
"No, our funding isn't sufficient," he says.
"The role of technology in student life has
grown considerably and we're having trouble
keeping pace."
Stanford often hires student workers to
help shoulder the burdens of keeping the
school's multi-million-dollar tech sector
afloat. Academic Computing, which manages
ResComp, currently employs 160 students —
usually as Resident Computing Consultants
(RCCs).
In light of Stanford's tight budget. Rikleen
says he wishes the RCCs could be paid more.
"I think we should pay them what they
have to turn around and pay in rent [and other
living costs]," Rikleen says.
Furthermore, he suggests that if given
more money, Academic Computing would
immediately hire two more full-time em
ployees.
