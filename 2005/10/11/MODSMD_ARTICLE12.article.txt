# 360 degrees of perfection
## Upcoming Xbox system set to dazzle diehard gamers 
### SAGAR BAPAT 
Forget Halo — the newest generation of video games
and gaming consoles is on its way here. On Nov 22, Mi
crosoft will launch its Xbox 360, following a wildly success
ful run by the original Xbox.
Microsoft's new system, along with similar innovations
from Nintendo and Sony, is expected to rejuvenate the
gaming industry. Schelley Olhava, a games analyst for the
research firm IDC,says he believes that Microsoft and Sony
will compete for the largest market share in North Ameri
ca, according to ZDNet.com. Software titan Mi
crosoft showed a preview of the Xbox 360 earlier in the year
on MTV. creating substantial buzz about the new product
and its improvements.
"The most anticipated feature among the Xbox 360's
specifications is its high-definition picture display." Olhava
said on the Web site. "They put more thought into every
thing down to the controller, which feels more natural in
your hand."
And that's not all that's new about the Xbox 360.
According to the official Xbox Web site,
http://www.xbox.com, the Xbox 360 will have the ability to
connect to the Xbox Live marketplace using built-in Ether
net and broadband Internet access. It will also be able to

play DVDs with its built-in progressive scan DVD technol
ogy as well as stream music and digital pictures from vari
ous music players and digital cameras.
However, Olhava tells ZDnet.com that the games will
have more of an impact on sales than the console itself.
Many highly anticipated games — as many as 15 to 20 —
are already scheduled for release with the new Xbox 360.
The lineup includes the action-adventure game "Kameo:
Elements of Power" and the highly-rated shooting game
"Perfect Dark Zero." Both were developed by the Mi
crosoft-owned company Rare.
Many games from third-party developers are also set to
be released on the heels of Xbox 360.These include "Project
Gotham Racing 3," from Blizzard Creations and many sports
games such as "NBA Live'o6," "Tiger Woods PGA Tour'o6"
and "Madden NFL '06" from Electronic Arts.
I low will this new system affect Stanford gamers?
Junior Jeremy Hoffman, a computer science major and
member of the Stanford I lalo Society on facebook.com. says
he hopes Microsoft will keep in touch with its old favorites.
"I like first-person shooter games — games that are
fast-paced and offer instant gratification," Hoffman says."I
hope that there will be some Xbox 2 games like Halo."
Both "Halo: Combat Evolved" and "Halo 2" seem to be
the most popular amongst Stanford video game fans. Hoff-

man offers some insight into the
Cardinal-wide craving.

"I used to play very intensive
strategy-based games, but when I got to

wv.* " wwi. *
college there just wasn't time for that," he
says. "Halo and Halo 2 are fun from the very
fiist second you start to play."

As of June 2005, "Halo 2" had sold 6.3 millior
copies, making it Microsoft's top-selling game.

Despite their deep affection for the hot commodi
ty that is Halo, some Stanford gamers do not seem in
clined to buy the new Xbox 360 when it comes out in No
vember.
"I probably won't buy one,"says senior Aton Gutierrez,an
other member of the Stanford Halo Society. "I do not even
have an Xbox right now. I just play on friends' systems,"
Gutierrez claims that plenty of students on campus fol
low in his console-less footsteps.
"Most gamers at Stanford do not own an Xbox them
selves," he remarks. "Normally, one or two people bring an
Xbox with them to college, and everyone plays with those."
1 loffman adds that he does not even own a television, so
buying the new system would be "pointless."
Whether the volume of video-gaming ruckus increases
in dormitory hallways, then, remains to be seen.
