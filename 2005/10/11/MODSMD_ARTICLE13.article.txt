# Finding inner peace, one server at a time

Placing documents on the Web isn't just
for computer geeks.
Here at Stanford, each student has his or
her own plot of cyberspace, so everyone can
back up work, transfer large files or set up a
Web site. This week's column shows you
how to take advantage of this Stanford serv
er space.
You Got Served
When you surf the Web. you are actually
connecting to hundreds of different com
puters across the world. Each time you visit
a Web site, a computer on the other end
grumbles, spins its hard drive and coughs up
the Web page you requested .These comput
ers are called servers and their job is to host
files, both public and private.
Servers provide a home for your data
that is more reliable and more accessible
than a finicky desktop. Everyone would be
using servers if it weren't for their cost.
While companies like godaddy.com sell
server space — called "hosting" — starting
at about $10a month. Stanford students can
use University servers for free.
Stanford's servers lie deep within the re
cesses of Sweet Hall's second floor. They
stay on day and night, amidst bleary-eyed
computer science majors and leftover cans
of Mountain Dew. These servers have
names like "elaine," "cardinal" and "fire
bird" and they share the load of Stanford's

distributed file system, known as Andrew
File System (AFS).
Hook Me Up
All students have 200 megabytes of free
space waiting for them on AFS.and they can
access their space by downloading a free file
transfer client.
For Windows, download either Secure-
FX (go to http://ess.stanford.edu) or Win-
SCP (visit http://winscp.net).
Mac users should get either Fetch (free
— visit http://ess.stanford.edu) or Fugu
from the University of Michigan. Fugu is
available at http://rsug.itd.umich.ed/soft
woare/fugu/.
All four programs are similar and allow
you to drag files back and forth between
your local computer and your server space.
SecureFX and Fetch are nice because they
are preconfigured to work on Stanford's
servers. Although WinSCP and Fugu must
be manually configured, I recommend them

because they come with more bells and
whistles.
When using any of these programs, look
for the "Host:" prompt and enter "cardi
nal.stanford.edu." At the "User:" prompt
enter your SUNet ID. Be sure to select ei
ther the "SCP", "SFTP" or "SSH" option.
This guarantees that you will use a secure
protocol to transfer your files instead of the
obsolete and insecure "FTP" protocol.
See http://ess.stanford.edu for more spe
cific instructions.
Dude, Where's My Data?
Once you have connected, you will see a
window with the files in your remote folder.
You can make new folders, drag items over
or delete items. Everyone starts with a
WWW folder. Anything placed in this fold
er will automatically show up online at
http://www.stanford.edu/~YourSUNetID/,
where it can be downloaded from any Web
browser.
Stanford also provides Mac-Leland and
PC-Leland. which are designed to mount
your server space locally. I recommend
sticking to a file-transfer client, as they are
less buggy and more versatile.
A word of caution: Stanford servers are a
bad place for private documents. Don't up
load sensitive data, or, at the very least,
place it in the "Private" folder.
Lastly, while you're on campus, your
server space follows you. Any computer

cluster on campus will give you direct access
to your server space, even without a client.
Live the Good Life
Now it is time to put that server space to
good use. Back up important essays or proj
ects to the Web as you compose them. This
way, should your computer spontaneously
hurst into flames, at least your grades won't
suffer.
Instead of e-mailing massive photos to
your friends, put them on your Weh space.
Adobe Photoshop will even generate a photo
gallery that you can place in your "WWW"
folder, as junior Adam Sadovsky demon
strates at http://stanford.edu/~sadovsky/pho
tography.
Next time you're giving a PowerPoint
presentation in class, play it safe and back it
up online. Now. if something goes wrong in
class, you can download another copy from
the Web.
And if you're working from a computer
cluster, always save your work online so you
can continue where you left off.
200 megabytes is ample space to suit
your needs. Take advantage of the comput
er resources that Stanford has to offer and
never be without your data again.
