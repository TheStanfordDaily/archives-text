## Editorial University should do better job promoting Door King 
### 
When students moved into their
rooms at the beginning of the year,
they were greeted by one notice
able difference: landline phones. Having a
landline is now mandatory, and the line and
phone are automatically included in every
room. Students are now required to sub
scribe to both phone and Internet services
through the University, and are charged for
these services via one lump telecommunica
tions fee in their University bill.
Although some students are unhappy
about having to pay fora phone they rarely
use, requiring students to have landlines has
several advantages. Chief among them is
that it has restored the utility of the Door
King system that grants visitors access to res
idences.
The formerly-antiquated system that al
lows a visitor to call a friend inside his or her
dorm room. Door King fell into disuse in re
cent years as fewer and fewer students
signed up for landlines. Now that they are a
mandatory part of the general telecommuni
cations fee, every room has one.
As a result, Door King's can now be used
effectively. Unfortunately, few students are
aware that Door King is functioning proper
ly, and many others have no idea what Door
King is — let alone how to use it. Because it

has been several years since Door King has
had any significant use, the majority of stu
dents have had no experience using the sys
tem to visit friends.
Information on how to use Door King
was included in the "Welcome Home" pack
ets distributed to students when they moved
in. However, most probably did not pay
close attention to the many pamphlets,flyers
and how-to sheets when they were busy un
packing.
The University should work to spread
knowledge of how Door King works. One easy
way to get students to use the system is to work
through the extensive Office of Residential
Education network. An e-mailcampaign.com
bined with residence staff announcements
about the Door King system at house meet
ings, could significantly increase its usage.
Avoiding the safety risks involved in
propping doors open, and the hassle of
knocking at a dorm's door while waiting to
be let in by a resident. Door King offers an
easy and viable alternative to the methods
students have been forced to rely on when
seeking access to friend's residences — but
students must first know that this technolo
gy exists. We encourage the University to do
a better job communicating with students
about Door King.
