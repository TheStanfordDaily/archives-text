# Thanks for the memories, Ted Leland

Athletics Director Ted Leland's recent
announcement that he will leave his
position on the Farm to become vice
president for university advancement at the
University of the Pacific shocked most and
dismayed almost as many. Leland's 15-year
tenure at Stanford has been incredibly suc
cessful, lucrative and prestigious, both for
him and the University as a whole.
Leland has led a sports program that has
won 11 Directors' Cups, 50 national team
championships and 173 conference champi
onships. During the 1996-1997 academic
year, Stanford set an NCAA record — win
ning six national titles. Overall during Le
land's time here, Stanford has won more
NCAA championships than any other
school in the nation. Very few would dis
agree with the assertion that Stanford has
the top overall athletic program in the Unit
ed States.
Leland has also been instrumental in rais
ing money for the Athletics Department.
Endowments and assets have grown seven
fold, hundreds of millions of dollars of pri
vate donations have been raised and the
funding for new and renovated athletic facil
ities has been secured.

Leland headed a department that rose
significantly in national prominence, becom
ing an undeniable powerhouse. He will be
greatly missed — not just for these hard and
fast statistical reasons, but also for the less
tangible benefits he brought to the program.
He has been widely praised for his encour
agement of sportsmanship and scholarship
and his emphasis on the importance of
women's sports. 1 le is popular with Stanford
athletes, students and alumni alike.
Some talk has been made of the Stanford
football team's lack of success under Ice
land's direction. He himself has expressed
regret regarding this situation. But we be
lieve that the sum of Iceland's assets far out
weighs the problems the football program
has suffered. Yes, football is the most visible
and widely-followed college sport, but we at
Stanford fortunately have a wealth of other
world-class teams to follow and cheer for
and watch win national championships. And
for that, we would like to thank Ted Leland
and all the coaches and players he has skill
fully led and managed during the past 15
years. We wish him all the best at the Univer
sity of the Pacific and in all his future en
deavors.
