# 'Til graduation do us part: Ready to marry your major?

UC°' what's your major?" As a pick-
line, it ranks just above "How
doin'?" Among freshmen, it
pries at the awkward silences between in
quiries about hometowns, hobbies and
IHUM. But, as those shameless pick-up
artists can attest, it's a futile question, be
cause freshmen who haven't taken a single
college class can't possibly know what they
want to do with the rest of their lives. And
frankly, they shouldn't.
Choosing a major is like getting mar
ried. There are some decisions which can
be solidified only by experience, whether
that experience is in the classroom or in a
singles bar. One day you may think you're
in love, but the next morning, the only rem
nant of the ecstasy that once lit up your en
tire being is a single smoldering thought:
"What was I thinking?" And then it's back
to square one.
It may take years of searching and count
less heartbreaks, but when that perfect one
comes along — the one that you don't mind
waking up next to every morning, whose
morning breath and bedhead, rather than se
riously grossing you out, puts a delirious
smile on your face — you know you've
found something special. So you plan the
whole ceremony, pick out the perfect dress
and the perfect band and the perfect cake —
and you live happily ever after, right?
Well, sometimes. But not everyone is so
lucky. In a country where the divorce rate
hovers somewhere around 50 percent, how
can people expect that any decision they
make now will still be relevant in five, 10,20
years? Britney Spears couldn't even make it

to 48 hours.
So, in a sort of backlash against this soci
etal shift. Americans are balking at the mere
concept of matrimony. It has become the
norm for people to put off tying the knot
until well into their 30s or 40s, avoiding the
kind of premature decision that could trig
ger divorce down the road.
Yet, as it grows increasingly rare for 18-
year-olds to march down the aisle for fear of
divorce, where are the analysts warning
them about intellectual divorce? Where are
the studies telling them to wait before mak
ing a commitment to a career that may not
hold their interest beyond next month?
Countless incoming college freshmen are
deciding on majors before ever stepping on
campus — a practice encouraged by appli
cations that ask prospective students to de
clare a major on the sole basis of their limit
ed high-school experience. They are labeling
themselves as "pre-med" or "engineering
track," often before they are even old
enough to vote. But nobody seems to find it
odd that — while the government believes
them incapable of choosing a president who

will he in power for only four years
— society somehow expects them to
be able to choose a major that will
essentially pave the path they will
follow for the rest of their lives.
Maybe this entire column is an
excuse for not having any idea what
I want to do with my own hfe. Maybe
I'm as bad as the singles who crack
jokes about their sickeningly blissful
married friends because it's the only
way to justify the fact that they are
still alone. But then again, maybe I
— like those purportedly lonely sin
gles— am just not ready to settle
down yet.
College is not the time for
monogamy. It's a time to explore
your options, to find out what you

like and don't like. You may think
that you want to marry a tall, dark,
handsome man someday, but, in the
meantime, there's no harm in check
ing out that cute surfer boy in your
psych class. You never know; you
may discover that what you always
thought was your ideal type is really
only second best.
While it may be true that Stan
ford's dating scene is a bit slow,
there's definitely no shortage when
it comes to academics. So there's no
excuse for not shopping around. Try
a few random hookups in drama, re
ligious studies or whatever you've
always admired from afar but have
been afraid to approach. You never
know; you may just find your perfect
match.
