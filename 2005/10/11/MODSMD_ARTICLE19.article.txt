# Narrative arc of my drinking career
## 
### 
High School: I somehow failed to start
drinking alcohol during high school.
My friends started drinking at the be
ginning of senior year, progressing steadily to
wards the stylish alcoholism that comes only
with being a private school kid. I was too busy
studying for SAT lis and writing college es
says in order to get into a good school where I
could begin drinking.
Unfortunately by the time the Big Enve
lope showed up from Stanford, my friends had
long surpassed me in the substance abuse cur
riculum, making it all the way to experimental
unnamed drugs purchased over the Internet
and delivered in boxes with no return address
es. Seeing no chance of catching up with them,
I started hanging out with a bunch of straight
edge theater dorks.
The first drink I ever had was liquid co
caine — vodka and red bull — a lethal con
coction that had me grabbing a friend's boob
in front of her conservative Indian mother by
the end of the night. When I came home that

night, my parents asked me, "Of all the things
to drink, what possessed you to drink that?"
Freshman Year: I made one of the worst
mistakes of my already regret-filled life. I did
n't touch alcohol for the entire year. Four
years ago. when fun was still holding on
thanks to an iron lung financed jointly by
Kappa Sig and Synergy, it was tradition for
sophomore alums from all-frosh dorms to
show up completely trashed, smash a few
lounge windows and roll in a keg.
These kids scared the crap out of me. I
thought they were going to eat me. I locked

myself in my room and when the previous
year's occupants knocked, I told them I didn't
live there and slammed the door. I was a
sniveling loser and an idiot.
Freshmen, if you are planning on drinking
at any point during your Stanford career,
learn to do it as a freshman. Surprisingly
enough, many of the people around you did
n't drink much in high school either and need
to learn to hold their liquor like everyone
else.This education usually involves showing
up to intimidating parties, watching beer
trickle out of a keg until some6ne older and
wiser pumps the tap, getting lost near the
GSB, pissing behind a tree (guys), wishing
you could piss behind a tree (girls), running
from the PoPo and puking. These are all
much more pleasant and forgivable offenses
if done in groups as a bonding activity.
Sophomore Yean I learned to drink. This
momentous occasion occurred during Full


David
Blackman
Blackmail's Back
Moon on the Quad. In my drunken
state, I was convinced that my old
opinions editor was try ing to hook up
with me. I believed this because that
night, she told every member of Ilie
Daily's staff that she was looking for
me. When I was unable to find her, I
ran around telling people that my
roommate was try ing to hook up with
another Daily chick, which was only
partially true, and everyone ended
the night sad and lonely. Days later,
when I finally did find her. she told me
she was just messing with my head.
This set a tone for the rest of the year.
Junior Year: I was staff in an all
frosh dorm, so of course, in an effort
to set an example for my residents 1
didn't touch the sauce all year.
Which is a lie, but it sounds nice.
This year included the most awkward
experience I've ever had involving al
cohol, and occurred, oddly enough,
with my mother. Since my father
stopped drinking decades ago, my
mother has been without a drinking
buddy in the family — so she was ex
cited at the prospect of try ing new fla
vors and brands of hard alcohol with
me, after she'd gotten over her initial
fit of laughter during which she called
my liquor cabinet a collection of "old

man drinks." Around New Year's, we
bought a bunch of airplane bottles of
liquor and went home to mix drinks.
College binge drinking does not pre
pare you for nursing a Rum and Coke
with your mother. Worse, when she
poured a shot of Grey Goose vodka,
she began to sip it, and then handed it
to me. At which point I took the shot.
"Why did you do that?" she asked.
"What else did you expect me to
do?" I replied.
"I don't know, but not that."
Then I went out clubbing.
Summer Interlude: During my
summer internship a few months ago,
I attempted to party on work nights
and still show up coherent the next
day. I would quit work at 6 p.m.. drive
to Santa Clara, drink gin and tonics
while watching "Family Guy," crash
on a couch, sleep five hours, wake up,
drive home, shower, change and go to
work. When I observed that this ex
periment was failing. I compensated
by picking up an addiction to incredi
bly acidic, burnt coffee. 1 discovered
that the brown stuff gives me fierce
jitters, but it was better than falling
asleep in meetings with senior vice
presidents. By the end of the summer,
1 was so exhausted that I was inca
pable of having fun. Some would
argue these two things had nothing to
do with each other.
Senior Year: I began to worry that
perhaps I was an alcoholic, not that
there's anvthina wrone with that —

it's not alcoholism until you graduate,
and its not unacceptable until you're
pushing 30. To test if this was the case,
a friend and I devised a test. It went
like this — one Saturday, both our
houses were throwing progressives,
and we resolved not to drink at either
of them. 1 baked cookies for mine,
drank some orange juice and said a
short prayer to Ralph Castro, thank
ing him for pointing out that vodka
doesn't make a Screwdriver taste
good (though I don't believe he has
ever attempted to make a Mojito sans
rum). This led to many holier-than
thou conversations in which I was of
fered a drink and had to say "Nope,
testing to see if I'm an alcoholic."
making fora terrible Saturday night
— which isn't to say one can't have
fun when one isn't drinking, just that
one can't have fun sober when every
else is rowdy and drunk. (See "Fresh
man Year"). But, we proved to our
selves we weren't alcoholics, which
has given us carte blanche to drink as
much and as absurdly as we've want
ed since then. The highlight of this so
far has been nursing Amaretto Sours
over a broken heart and cheese sticks
at Stern's Cyber Cafe late one Tues
day night, an informal re-induction of
my friend into the Sad Men's Club.

Dear Mom, I'm not an alcoholic. Love,
Dave. PS. If you're really concerned,
