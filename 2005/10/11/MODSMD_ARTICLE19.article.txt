# Narrative arc of my drinking career
## 
### 
High School: I somehow failed to start
drinking alcohol during high school.
My friends started drinking at the be
ginning of senior year, progressing steadily to
wards the stylish alcoholism that comes only
with being a private school kid. I was too busy
studying for SAT lis and writing college es
says in order to get into a good school where I
could begin drinking.
Unfortunately by the time the Big Enve
lope showed up from Stanford, my friends had
long surpassed me in the substance abuse cur
riculum, making it all the way to experimental
unnamed drugs purchased over the Internet
and delivered in boxes with no return address
es. Seeing no chance of catching up with them,
I started hanging out with a bunch of straight
edge theater dorks.
The first drink I ever had was liquid co
caine — vodka and red bull — a lethal con
coction that had me grabbing a friend's boob
in front of her conservative Indian mother by
the end of the night. When I came home that

night, my parents asked me, "Of all the things
to drink, what possessed you to drink that?"
Freshman Year: I made one of the worst
mistakes of my already regret-filled life. I did
n't touch alcohol for the entire year. Four
years ago. when fun was still holding on
thanks to an iron lung financed jointly by
Kappa Sig and Synergy, it was tradition for
sophomore alums from all-frosh dorms to
show up completely trashed, smash a few
lounge windows and roll in a keg.
These kids scared the crap out of me. I
thought they were going to eat me. I locked

myself in my room and when the previous
year's occupants knocked, I told them I didn't
live there and slammed the door. I was a
sniveling loser and an idiot.
Freshmen, if you are planning on drinking
at any point during your Stanford career,
learn to do it as a freshman. Surprisingly
enough, many of the people around you did
n't drink much in high school either and need
to learn to hold their liquor like everyone
else.This education usually involves showing
up to intimidating parties, watching beer
trickle out of a keg until some6ne older and
wiser pumps the tap, getting lost near the
GSB, pissing behind a tree (guys), wishing
you could piss behind a tree (girls), running
from the PoPo and puking. These are all
much more pleasant and forgivable offenses
if done in groups as a bonding activity.

momentous occasion occurred during Full
