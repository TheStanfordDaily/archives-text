# What can Brown do for you?
## 
### 
Iwas pleasantly surprised earlier this
week when the editor of The Daily in
formed me via e-mail that I had been se
lected as a columnist. After all, I'd always
wanted to sit on my ass writing nonsensical
musings, and then see them habitually im
posed upon the masses. Important questions
immediately came to mind. What would I do
as an unregulated member of the press?
Would I discuss what people really care
about — booze — or what they wished they
cared about — issues? Would it be possible
to locate and notify, while sneering obnox
iously, the IHUMTF who'd once given me a
B-minus? More importantly, would I be re
ceiving a congratulatory phone call from
Michael Crichton, and if so, could I defer
him to the people in housing while I busily
signed the various book deals dancing imp
ishly in my delusional mind?
My moment of euphoria was. unfortu
nately, short-lived. I read on to discover that
the staff wanted to publish one of my sample
columns in the next day's Daily. That obvi
ously wasn't going to happen. Oh no. I had
written two sample columns. X and Y, on the
most interesting topics known to man —
beer and Las Vegas — to win the column,
but these stories didn't convey a personali
ty.a public face, facade, character, guise, or,
more specifically, a Tyson-punch political
view, Casanova-caliber sex tip, Hawking-cu
rious musing or just the general freakishly
hyperbolic caricature of the self — you
know, a persona.
Everybody out there writing or commen
tating has a persona. They have to. Nobody
opens the paper or turns on the television to
see their run-of-the-mill Mommy, Bobby or
Johnny Colleague force-feeding them the

same every-day, prosaic gossip. They want
hot-headed political squawk-talk so they
can envision themselves drop-kicking
Bush's third-grade ass back to the playpen,
or they want romantic tips so they can lure
that special someone into a lifelong relation
ship of sweet, sweet cable television...eter
nally washing over them in a tranquil peace
— or they want stimulating analysis that can
later be repeated in an impressive manner
— along with a sexually ambiguous head
nod at the water cooler.
Take, for example, two notable persona,
Bill O'Reilly and Oprah. Here we have the
most intractably, certifiably Republican man
on Earth,someone who somehow — tongue
lashing, right-wing flapping into the strato
sphere — jabber-stepped his way out of the
insane asylum onto a news set. And we have
the nicest, sweetest little book-reading daisy
of a lady in Breadbasket, US A. Do you know
anybody like these people? In real life?
Probably not. They're caricatures. We're
attracted to them like Jacko to his own face.
Arnold, Conan, Georgie-Boy-W, Teddy K.,
Jon Stewart. Dave Barry, Anne Coulter,
TUcker Carlson and, of course, good old Bill,
to name a few. They each epitomize some
identity, cause, motive or belief — some
thing simple we can love, hate or aspire to.

They impassion audiences in a way that the
average Joe can't. And we switch on the box
to access a zoo-full of these clowns every
night to relieve ourselves of the mundane.
So I began to wonder. What can Brown
do for you? Just what is my persona?
Looking for some divine insight, I fired
an e-mail off to some of my buddies. I imme
diately received a batch of responses, all of
them useless, most of them scathing —
"New York banking asshole who tends to
tell it like it is in 10 colloquial words or less,
but sometimes shows his softer (pansy)
side" — and none particularly compelling.
Worse yet, one of my female friends report
ed that she began reading a certain guy's col
umn one year and loved it so much that she
pursued him, and eventually, well, uh, you
know the rest... Immediately the issue had
reached Defcon 5: Potential Ass Alert.
I thought back to some of the Daily
columns I'd read regularly in the past. There
were the Sex-and-the-City girls constantly
imposing their independent, designer-shoe
obsessed opinions on the Stanford commu
nity. There was the gay fellow with the spec
tacular tips, ironically, for wooing the oppo
site sex. And there was the hilarious guy with
no agenda other than the comically mal
nourished analysis of otherwise serious top
ics. I had quite a challenge ahead of me to
match these folks.
Ultimately, though, I concluded that a
persona, like anything, evolves. Bill
O'Reilly didn't begin his career spitting
fiery balls of death at his opponents. He
waited a while, bided his time. Similarly,
Conan began his talk-show career as him-

Brown
B-School Business
self — a bashful geek, sarcastic
and well-timed. Only now has he
become the irreverent, flailing
gonzo we've come to know and
love. The same' goes for just about
all the personalities out there.
And so, I decided, with a little
time, just maybe we'll find out what
it is that Brown can do for you.

were the Sex-and-the-City girls constantly
imposing their independent, designer-shoe
obsessed opinions on the Stanford commu
nity. There was the gay fellow with the spec
tacular tips, ironically, for wooing the oppo
site sex. And there was the hilarious guy with
no agenda other than the comically mal
nourished analysis of otherwise serious top
ics. I had quite a challenge ahead of me to
match these folks.
Ultimately, though, I concluded that a
persona, like anything, evolves. Bill
O'Reilly didn't begin his career spitting
fiery balls of death at his opponents. He
waited a while, bided his time. Similarly,
Conan began his talk-show career as him-


Clayton
Brown
B-School Business
self — a bashful geek, sarcastic
and well-timed. Only now has he
become the irreverent, flailing
gonzo we've come to know and
love. The same' goes for just about
all the personalities out there.
And so, I decided, with a little
time, just maybe we'll find out what
it is that Brown can do for you.

Clayton Brown has no association
whatsoever with the United Parcel
Service, with the possible exception
of utterly excessive package delivery
to Schwab. Such packages contain
countless unspecified objects from
numerous undisclosed Web sites. E

Iwas pleasantly surprised earlier this
week when the editor of The Daily in
formed me via e-mail that I had been se
lected as a columnist. After all, I'd always
wanted to sit on my ass writing nonsensical
musings, and then see them habitually im
posed upon the masses. Important questions
immediately came to mind. What would I do
as an unregulated member of the press?
Would I discuss what people really care
about — booze — or what they wished they
cared about — issues? Would it be possible
to locate and notify, while sneering obnox
iously, the IHUMTF who'd once given me a
B-minus? More importantly, would I be re
ceiving a congratulatory phone call from
Michael Crichton, and if so, could I defer
him to the people in housing while I busily
signed the various book deals dancing imp
ishly in my delusional mind?
My moment of euphoria was. unfortu
nately, short-lived. I read on to discover that
the staff wanted to publish one of my sample
columns in the next day's Daily. That obvi
ously wasn't going to happen. Oh no. I had
written two sample columns. X and Y, on the
most interesting topics known to man —
beer and Las Vegas — to win the column,
but these stories didn't convey a personali
ty.a public face, facade, character, guise, or,
more specifically, a Tyson-punch political
view, Casanova-caliber sex tip, Hawking-cu
rious musing or just the general freakishly
hyperbolic caricature of the self — you
know, a persona.
Everybody out there writing or commen
tating has a persona. They have to. Nobody
opens the paper or turns on the television to
see their run-of-the-mill Mommy, Bobby or
Johnny Colleague force-feeding them the

same every-day, prosaic gossip. They want
hot-headed political squawk-talk so they
can envision themselves drop-kicking
Bush's third-grade ass back to the playpen,
or they want romantic tips so they can lure
that special someone into a lifelong relation
ship of sweet, sweet cable television...eter
nally washing over them in a tranquil peace
— or they want stimulating analysis that can
later be repeated in an impressive manner
— along with a sexually ambiguous head
nod at the water cooler.
Take, for example, two notable persona,
Bill O'Reilly and Oprah. Here we have the
most intractably, certifiably Republican man
on Earth,someone who somehow — tongue
lashing, right-wing flapping into the strato
sphere — jabber-stepped his way out of the
insane asylum onto a news set. And we have
the nicest, sweetest little book-reading daisy
of a lady in Breadbasket, US A. Do you know
anybody like these people? In real life?
Probably not. They're caricatures. We're
attracted to them like Jacko to his own face.
Arnold, Conan, Georgie-Boy-W, Teddy K.,
Jon Stewart. Dave Barry, Anne Coulter,
TUcker Carlson and, of course, good old Bill,
to name a few. They each epitomize some
identity, cause, motive or belief — some
thing simple we can love, hate or aspire to.

They impassion audiences in a way that the
average Joe can't. And we switch on the box
to access a zoo-full of these clowns every
night to relieve ourselves of the mundane.
So I began to wonder. What can Brown
do for you? Just what is my persona?
Looking for some divine insight, I fired
an e-mail off to some of my buddies. I imme
diately received a batch of responses, all of
them useless, most of them scathing —
"New York banking asshole who tends to
tell it like it is in 10 colloquial words or less,
but sometimes shows his softer (pansy)
side" — and none particularly compelling.
Worse yet, one of my female friends report
ed that she began reading a certain guy's col
umn one year and loved it so much that she
pursued him, and eventually, well, uh, you
know the rest... Immediately the issue had
reached Defcon 5: Potential Ass Alert.
