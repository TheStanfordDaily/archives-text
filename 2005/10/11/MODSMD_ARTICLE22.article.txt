## Foes tower over men's tennis in Tulsa Several Cardinal also compete in Santa Clara's Bronco Classic 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Three men towering at 6-foot-9 proved insurmountable
obstacles for the Stanford men's tennis team this past
weekend at the Polo Ralph Lauren All-American Tennis
Championships in Tiilsa, Okla.
Freshman Matt Bruch won seven matches without
dropping a set in his collegiate debut. He made an impres
sive run at the singles title, but he was defeated by an op
ponent who was nine inches taller. After advancing from
the qualifying draw to the main draw, Bruch extended his
undefeated streak into the semifinals, where he fell — 7-6,
6-4 —to eventual champion. Georgia's 6-foot-9 John
Isner.
"John [Isner] played a good match and came up with
the big shots at the right time," Stanford head coach John
Whitlinger said."l was very proud of Matt. Fora freshman,
the wins that he had were incredible. I'm really excited
about his future and what he's going to bring to Stanford
tennis."
Height continued to provide a slight advantage as the
weekend progressed, as the doubles champions consisted
of a pair of 6-foot-9 players from Middle Tennessee State
University. The duo of European natives eliminated the
Stanford's doubles tandem of senior KC Corkery and jun
ior James Pade in the semifinals, 8-4.
On his path to the semifinals, Bruch played with poise
beyond his years. In the main draw's second round. Bruch
knocked out No. 2 seed Ludovic Walter of Duke. After
jumping to a 4-2 first-set lead, Bruch closed out the open
ing set, 6-4.The Lake Forest, 111. native then took control of
the second set, 4-2, and cruised to the Round of 32 victory.
In other main draw singles action, Corkery defeated
Virginia's Marko Miklo before suffering a tight loss to
North Carolina's Raian Luchici, 2-6,6-4,6-3. Corkery had
his chances against Luchici, as he won the first set and
snagged an early break in the third. However, the senior
could not close out the Thursday afternoon contest.
Junior James Wan suffered a pair of losses, dropping a
decision to Virginia's Treat Huey before losing to serve
and-volley specialist Jonathan Stokke of Duke, 7-5,6-4 in
the consolation draw.
"James needed to make a couple more [returns] and a
couple more passing shots and he would have been fine
[against Stokke]," Whitlinger said. "But he really compet
ed well and that's what I really like seeing out of James.
There was fight the whole time."
After a first-round 9-8 win over a Rice duo, Corkery
and Pade earned an lopsided victory over the fourth-seed
ed Arkansas squad. The duo then picked up an 8-2 win
over a Baylor pair before falling in the semifinals to the
towering Tennessee tandem. A strong service game
proved to be an asset to Middle Tennessee, as the duo
never dropped its serve throughout the entire tournament.
"It was just a very difficult match to play because the
[Middle Tennessee team was] so big and they hit big
serves," Whitlinger said. "The ball is bouncing a little dif
ferently than you're used to seeing."
Because they reached the semifinals, Corkery and Pade
earned a doubles berth in the National Indoor Champi
onships, to be held the first weekend in November. In sin
gles, Bruch also qualified for the event that Whitlinger
called "the second Grand Slam of college tennis."
While their teammates traveled to TUlsa, the remaining
Stanford players entered the Bronco Classic. In Santa
Clara, the Cardinal gained valuable experience, participat
ing in 34 matches over the course of the weekend.
Experience provided the edge when sophomore Phil
Kao defeated freshman Blake Muller 6-4, 6-3 in the A
flight singles draw finals. Kao came back from first-set
deficits in the quarterfinals and semifinals to win both

matches in three sets.
"Phil played definitely the best tennis that I've seen him
play," assistant coach Dave Hodge said. "He's improved a
lot in the summer and showed a lot of maturity fora soph
omore."
In doubles action, senior Jon Wong teamed with sopho
more Chris Rasmussen to advance to the A-flight draw
semifinals, before falling 8-4.
Stanford got off to a slow start in some of its matches.

but quickly made up for lost time in the consolation draws.
Muller and junior Eric McKean won the finals of one con
solation doubles draw while Kao and freshman Jeff Zeller
earned a victory in another consolation draw final.
"On the first day, a lot of the new guys were getting a
feel for how quick a pro-set really is," Hodge said. "You re
ally have to get a quick start and be really aggressive in

they quite understood that coming
into the tournament.
Zeller also advanced to a conso
lation singles draw final, before los
ing in two tight sets. Freshman Ken
Kao fell in the semifinals of the C
flight singles draw.
"[John Whitlinger and I] are still
trying to get a feel for what type of
game those new guys have and how
they deal with certain situations,"

this weekend with a lot of things to
work on, but we're definitely excit
ed about the future for those fresh
men."
