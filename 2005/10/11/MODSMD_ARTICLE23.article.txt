midfielder / forward Caroline Hussey
and midfielders / defenders junior

back after a 4-3 shootout loss against
Pacific, scoring three early goals and
giving all team members a chance to
play. The team scored early in the
game with a Hais tally at 1:22. Erick
son notched her first goal about four
minutes later. Richardson netted an
other at 8:11 and the rout was on.The
Cardinal offense recorded 22 shots
on the day, while Davidson managed
only six.

the sole bright spot for the Wildcats,
as the sophomore forward scored
during a scramble near the cage
48:08 minutes into the 70-minute
contest. Ransone's goal came against
freshman goalkeeper Sarah Scheller,
who made her third career start for
Stanford.
Stanford reclaimed a three-goal

lead when Erickson notched her sec
ond score less than three minutes
into the second half. Hussey capped
the Stanford offensive bonanza at
52:18.
Two days later, the Cardinal fell 4-
0 to the North Carolina Tar Heels
(10-2), who scored early in the first
half and continued strong defense to
hold off the Cardinal.

/ back Rachel Dawson kicked off the
scoring at 2:04, and sophomore mid
fielder/forwards Heather Kendell
and Liz Morris also added first-half
scores at 24:18 and 27:46 respective
ly-
Stanford's defense regained some
momentum in the second half, yield
ing the Tar Heels only one score in
the final period, but Sunday's contest
nevertheless marked the Tar Heels'
eighth shutout of the season.
Scheller was particularly effective
during the match, notching eight
saves. The Tar Heels out-shot Stan
ford 18 to six, and junior defender /
midfielder Aska Sturdevan recorded
the Cardinal's only shot during the
first half.
The Stanford women capped the
road trip with a visit to the Demon
Deacons (12-0) yesterday. As the
rankings would have predicted,

margin.

Demon Deacons an early lead with
