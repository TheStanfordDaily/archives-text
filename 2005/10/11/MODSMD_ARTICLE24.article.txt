# Monty faces critical year across the bay
## 
### 
Every time I watch a Golden State War
riors' basketball game, I get a slight
chill up my spine — and not only be
cause the Warriors have symbolized medioc
rity for the last decade. (That just explains the
nausea.) No, what makes me rub my eyes in
disbelief is the sight of the pioneer of Stanford
basketball, the man who made Maples rock,
coaching a team across the bay with blue and
gold team colors.
I guess I can't let go of my own vision of
Mike Montgomery: the former Stanford
coach roaming the bench at an intimate, yet
ear-shattering Maples Pavilion, barking at the
referees with a graceful fury and kicking the
advertisement panel affixed to the scorer's
table.
When he announced his resignation after a
30-2 season in 2004, I remember gathering
around the TV with friends, waiting for ESPN
to confirm or deny what we thought was an
unfunny joke played by some Cal dropout.
Even today, I still don't fully fathom why he
left. Maybe he just needed a new challenge, or
he feared he would never national
championship with a tightening admissions
policy. Was it the money, or could it have been
his frustration following the Cardinal's second
round exit to Alabama that year?
Fortunately for the fans of Stanford bas
ketball, Monty bequeathed Trent Johnson
with a team sailing in relatively smooth water.
The program is an entrenched national power,
consistently appearing in the NCAA tourna
ment, and attracting plenty of potential re
cruits. However, as we check in on good ole
Monty, we see the water may be a bit choppi
er on his side of the bay.
Right now, Montgomery is soaking up the
sun in Hawaii, directing his second NBA train
ing camp. But the honeymoon will end soon
enough. The man who led Stanford to the
Final Four in 1998 will face more media scruti
ny this season than he ever faced on the Farm.
For Coach Mike, there is no more grace pe
riod. After all-star point guard Baron Davis'
acquisition fueled a 14-4 Warrior run that
closed last year's otherwise mediocre season,
many experts expect Golden State to finally
end its decade-long playoff drought.
Of course, when he was first hired, Mont
gomery faced similar media attention — but
more for his astonishing decision to leave the
comfort of Stanford, than for actual expecta
tions to win. Few felt that the Warriors were a
capable playoff team, yet even in his first year
on the job, the media did not expect Mont
gomery to succeed.
Glenn Dickey, then a prominent columnist
for the San Francisco Chronicle (and a self
proclaimed Cal homer), wrote at the time that
Montgomery was the wrong man for the job.
Dickey has since changed his mind following
last year's campaign. Several other national
writers expressed similar doubts about Mont
gomery's ability to replicate his collegiate suc
cess at the professional level.
Montgomery admitted to initial struggles,
as he was taken aback by the sheer difficulty
of gaining an NBA player's attention. He also
made tactical mistakes that cost the Warriors
several contests. However, once the team ac
quired Davis, Monty looked like he was back
in Maples.
Still, most Warriors fans believed the
team's turnaround at the end of last season
was due more to Davis' arrival than Mont
gomery's coaching maturation. Last month,
one local beat writer flatly asserted that Mont
gomery was not going to make it as an NBA
coach.
All told, you get the sense that if the team
starts to struggle, the fans will put Monty on
the hot seat. There's even a chance that if the
team really struggles, Monty could be outright
fired. If that happens, let's hope he doesn't end
up coaching for that other squad cross the bay,
another team that dons the Blue and Gold.
However, fans have plenty of reason to be
lieve Monty will finally breakthrough this sea
son. For one, he has the respect and support of
his players, who busted their tails in the off
season. In fact, Davis even asked Mont
gomery to be more vocal in critiquing his play.
Monty also has the support of his front office,
a key for any coach in today's NBA.
Above all else, what Monty really has in his
corner are a year of NBA experience, knowl
edge of his team and a track-record of success
in the face of tall odds. Monty was told he was
n't going to win at Stanford. Instead, he mere
ly rolled to 26 consecutive victories in his final
season. I wholeheartedly believe Mont
gomery makes a team fundamentally better,
and that with a little help, he can help snap the
NBA's longest playoff drought.
