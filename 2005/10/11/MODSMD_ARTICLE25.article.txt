Armed with sophomore midfielder
Rachel Buehler.last week's Pac-10 Player of
the Week, and senior defender Hayley Hunt,
a MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List candi
date. No. 19 Stanford women's soccer had
one thought in its mind this weekend: victo
ry The Cardinal (8-3-1,2-0-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) displayed excellent form as they
kicked off conference play with authority,
scoring two impressive 1-0 victories against
Washington State (7-5-1,0-2-0 Pac-10) and
Washington(o-10-3,0-2-0 Pac-10).
In the first match of the weekend, Stan
ford relentlessly launched attack after at
tack on Washington State's goal, testing the
mettle of Cougar senior keeper Katie
Hultin. The Cardinal finally broke through
in the 70th minute, when junior midfielder
Shari Summers' rocketed a shot into the
back of the net. Hunt garnered her second
assist in as many games on the play
"Hayley crossed it in," Summers said. "It
was just a loose ball that came to me, and
luckily I was there."
On the other side of the field, an entirely
different, but still impressive, story was un
folding. Stanford's defense was rock-solid as
it restricted the Cougars to only three shots
on the match. Freshman goalie Alex Gamble
was largely unchallenged, needing to make
only a single save in the entire match en
route to her fourth shutout on the season.
Another energetic crowd attended Sun
day's home contest against the Huskies, fill
ing Maloney Field with enthusiastic cries of
"Go Stanford". The Cardinal once again
played at a high level, attacking in numbers
and advancing the ball wide from both sides
of the field.
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe de
ployed an aggressive strategy against Wash
ington. Senior defender Lindsey Hunt con

stantly played further up the field than
usual, serving as an additional attacker at
times. Lindsey Hunt displayed offensive
prowess in the match, repeatedly making
strong runs and crosses.
"We pushed Lindsey up a little bit be
cause they were playing up at times," Rat
cliffe said. "We wanted more playmaking
and speed out of the back, and Lindsey is re
ally fast. [She] was getting behind them and
getting some good crosses in, so she really
helped us today."
But it was a brilliant play from freshman
forward Hillary Heath that allowed the Car
dinal to strike pay dirt. Just two minutes
after entering the game in a first-half substi
tution, Heath struck the ball hard past
Huskies'junior keeper Kelsey Rasmussen.
"Heath scored a magnificent goal, and it
was the first of her career," Ratcliffe said.
"[At other times], we created some good
chances but were unfortunate not to finish
them."
Indeed, bad luck may have played a role,
as crisp passes and skillful runs failed to pro
duce another Stanford goal. Summers, fresh
man Marissa Abegg and Lindsey Hunt were
all denied by Rasmussen.
"Their goalkeeper is a very strong play
er." Ratcliffe said. "She is probably one of
the best in the Pac-10, and I was impressed
with her. She made some great saves."
Stanford extended its win streak to five, a
strong indication that the influx of young
new talent and experienced veterans are
meshing and learning to play as a cohesive
unit. Despite coming out of the weekend
with a perfect conference record, the Cardi
nal are far from satisfied.
"It's a great start to the Pac-10 whenever
you can get two wins, but we still have a lot
more work to do" Ratcliffe said. "The team
wants to get better and better. They are dis
appointed by winning 1-0 — they want to
win by two or three."

Armed with sophomore midfielder
Rachel Buehler.last week's Pac-10 Player of
the Week, and senior defender Hayley Hunt,
a MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List candi
date. No. 19 Stanford women's soccer had
one thought in its mind this weekend: victo
ry The Cardinal (8-3-1,2-0-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) displayed excellent form as they
kicked off conference play with authority,
scoring two impressive 1-0 victories against
Washington State (7-5-1,0-2-0 Pac-10) and
Washington(o-10-3,0-2-0 Pac-10).
In the first match of the weekend, Stan
ford relentlessly launched attack after at
tack on Washington State's goal, testing the
mettle of Cougar senior keeper Katie
Hultin. The Cardinal finally broke through
in the 70th minute, when junior midfielder
Shari Summers' rocketed a shot into the
back of the net. Hunt garnered her second
assist in as many games on the play
"Hayley crossed it in," Summers said. "It
was just a loose ball that came to me, and
luckily I was there."
On the other side of the field, an entirely
different, but still impressive, story was un
folding. Stanford's defense was rock-solid as
it restricted the Cougars to only three shots
on the match. Freshman goalie Alex Gamble
was largely unchallenged, needing to make
only a single save in the entire match en
route to her fourth shutout on the season.
Another energetic crowd attended Sun
day's home contest against the Huskies, fill
ing Maloney Field with enthusiastic cries of
"Go Stanford". The Cardinal once again
played at a high level, attacking in numbers
and advancing the ball wide from both sides
of the field.
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe de
ployed an aggressive strategy against Wash
ington. Senior defender Lindsey Hunt con

stantly played further up the field than
usual, serving as an additional attacker at
times. Lindsey Hunt displayed offensive
prowess in the match, repeatedly making
strong runs and crosses.
"We pushed Lindsey up a little bit be
cause they were playing up at times," Rat
cliffe said. "We wanted more playmaking
and speed out of the back, and Lindsey is re
ally fast. [She] was getting behind them and
getting some good crosses in, so she really
helped us today."
But it was a brilliant play from freshman
forward Hillary Heath that allowed the Car
dinal to strike pay dirt. Just two minutes
after entering the game in a first-half substi
tution, Heath struck the ball hard past
Huskies'junior keeper Kelsey Rasmussen.
"Heath scored a magnificent goal, and it
was the first of her career," Ratcliffe said.
"[At other times], we created some good
chances but were unfortunate not to finish
them."
Indeed, bad luck may have played a role,
as crisp passes and skillful runs failed to pro
duce another Stanford goal. Summers, fresh
man Marissa Abegg and Lindsey Hunt were
all denied by Rasmussen.
"Their goalkeeper is a very strong play
er." Ratcliffe said. "She is probably one of
the best in the Pac-10, and I was impressed
with her. She made some great saves."
Stanford extended its win streak to five, a
strong indication that the influx of young
new talent and experienced veterans are
meshing and learning to play as a cohesive
unit. Despite coming out of the weekend
with a perfect conference record, the Cardi
nal are far from satisfied.
"It's a great start to the Pac-10 whenever
you can get two wins, but we still have a lot
more work to do" Ratcliffe said. "The team
wants to get better and better. They are dis
appointed by winning 1-0 — they want to
win by two or three."
