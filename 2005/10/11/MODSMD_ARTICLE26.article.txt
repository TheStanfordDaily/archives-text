## Stanford drops in rankings 
### STEPHANIE CHAPARRO 
Admit Weekend is arguably the best time of year to
discover why students choose to attend Stanford. Facul
ty, staff and students make an extra effort to represent
the University as more than the percent of applicants ad
mitted or the amount of alumni donations received. In
stead, prospective students get to experience life on cam
pus, the (usually) gorgeous weather and the academic en
vironment.
The recently-released 2006 version of the U.S. News
and World Reports' college-ranking guide had no such
ambitions. Instead, Stanford slid down the rankings from
fourth in the nation to fifth, behind perennial front-run
ners Harvard. Princeton and Yale — but also below the
University of Pennsylvania. It tied with Duke.
According to a spokesperson for U.S. News, the
process of ranking schools begins by sorting them ac
cording to missions and regions. Then, 15 indicators of ac
ademic excellence are assigned, none of which are ex
plained on the U.S. News Web site. Magazine representa
tives declined to comment on these indicators.
Each college receives a composite score based on
peer assessment (25 percent), retention (20 percent),
faculty resources (20 percent), student selectivity (15
percent), financial resources (10 percent), graduation
rate (5 percent) and alumni giving rate (5 percent). The
top school in each category is assigned a value of 100,
and the other schools' scores are calculated as a propor
tion of the top score.
After the 1997 publication of U.S. News' "America's

Best Colleges," Stanford joined several other universities
in protest against parts of the ranking process, deeming
them subjective and inconclusive. The University took
particular issue with the reputational survey, which asks
school officials to rank all the national universities in four
tiers. After deciding that this task was highly biased —
especially considering it accounted for 25 percent of an
individual university's ranking — Stanford decided to no
longer complete the survey.
In an effort to keep prospective students connected to
information that may impact their college decisions,
Stanford created its own Web site, which includes statis
tics of the number of faculty who are members of nation
al academies — a statistic bypassed by the magazine
rankings. The University continues to participate in the
ranking program but refuses to complete the survey.
Some students and parents, however, find U.S. News'
rankings paramount in deciding whether a school is wor
thy of the cost of tuition and a move to California.
According to sophomore Marisa Richetta, the rank
ings played a large part in her decision to come to Stan
ford.
"My father would only let me leave Texas and in
state tuition if I went to a top 10 school according to the
rankings published in the U.S. News magazine," she
said. "Stanford was my first choice and at the time was
ranked fourth in the nation. I can't believe we dropped
in the rankings."
Others question the magazine's system.
"The U.S. News' algorithms are whack," said sopho
more Adam Knepp.
