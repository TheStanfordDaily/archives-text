## Choices for women complex after school 
### MEREDITH BOWEN DAILY ORANGE 
(U-WIRE) SYRACUSE, N Y. â€”
The choice between being a stay-at
home mother or a working woman
may be a far more complex decision
for middle-class college women than
recent surveys of graduates and cur
rent students seem to make it.
Surveys of past and current Yale
University women show nearly half of
women name mothering as their pri
mary occupation by age 40. Subse
quent surveys of current students
showed that nearly 30 percent plan to
stop working to raise their children.
The same decision for Syracuse
University women is not as black and
white, reflecting constantly changing
attitudes about a woman's role at
home and the workplace, as well as
economic differences.
"There's still kind of a judgment
on both sides," said sophomore busi

ness major Elizabeth Swanson.
"Some women in business look down
on women who stay home, but then
there's also that guilt about leaving
the kids home with a stranger."
Interviews with 18 current female
students showed a desire to experi
ence both the hearth and the board
room and a realization that most
marriages do not end in white picket
fences and happily ever after.
Fifteen said they would consider
being stay-at-home mothers only after
working fora few years, many adding
they would stay at home only if it was
financially easy to do so and only until
their children were ready for school.
None said they want to have chil
dren right after college. Many hoped
to work fora few years, gaining expe
rience in their fields and enjoying
their youth before taking a few years
off to raise their children. Most said
they plan on returning to work part
time after their children start school.
