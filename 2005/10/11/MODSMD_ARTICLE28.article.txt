## New publication brings arts to campus Black Ink Review aims to foster 'intellectual community,' liberal arts appreciation 
### KAT LEWIN 
Most students at Stanford have
probably never heard of Black Ink
Review. The publication, focused on
creating an intellectual community
through publishing reviews of books
and events in the arts, officially start
ed last spring, but its first issue came
out in extremely limited release this
summer.
"We made 13 copies," said Ameri
can Studies major Ricardo Gilb,
Black Ink Review's co-founder. "I
had to make it limited so it would be
a collector's item."
This year, according to Black Ink
Review's founders, the publication is
expanding its operations and plan
ning to release issues in the middle of
every quarter.
The magazine is entirely student
run, featuring lengthy reviews of liter
ature, non-fiction publications, poet
ry and art exhibits around the Bay
Area. It is also the only publication of
this nature on campus.
"The only college publication like
this in the nation is the Yale Review
of Books," Gilb said. "Last year I
complained that every other school
had liberal arts magazines, then I
looked around and schools don't
have reviews of books or art maga
zines."
As well as providing a written out
let for discussion of the arts. Black Ink
Review also strives to create intellec
tual dialogue between its members.
Students are encouraged to choose
books to review and attend local per
formances — then discuss them in a
round-table forum.
"We want this to be not just a mag
azine, but a place where you can
make friends with your intellectual

interests, where we can bring people
into our circle," said sophomore
Sarah Nahm, fellow co-founder. "It
goes beyond the words on the page."
Initially, according to Gilb, the
idea was born out of frustration for
the lack of a liberal arts presence on
campus.
"We thought this would be a re
bellious activity, where fuzzies' got
together and hated Stanford because
there are too many engineers," Gilb
explained. "But everyone was excited
about it. You're writing? Great."
One of the publication's primary
objectives is to strengthen the visibil
ity of liberal arts on campus, accord
ing to its founders. Although there
are several student publications on
campus, Nahm and Gilb are not par
ticularly worried about fighting to
build an audience.
"Our goal isn't to publish to create
an audience — our goal is to publish
to create a community," Nahm said.
"This is more of a manifesto that
comes out in issues. This is a magazine
we want to stand for something to its
writers."
Nick Casey, a co-terminal student
who wrote for Black Ink Review's
first issue, agreed that the magazine
would not get lost in the shuffle.
"I don't think there are enough
publications," he said. "I think there
are too few, in fact. Anything that gets
people reading is good. This publica
tion has carved its own niche as being
a very beautiful magazine, in terms of
layout."
Layout is one of the magazine's
key interests. As well as literary and
cultural reviews. Black Ink Review
staff plans on featuring illustrations
and a center spread of photography
in every issue.
"1 love the magazine as a media
that can be pulled, stretched, expand
ed — it's so versatile, yet so fleeting,"
Nahm said "We are in the age of dig
italization. I look at a magazine as
something extraordinary. The reason
you pick up and buy a magazine in
stead of looking it up on the Internet
is because it has something different
to offer."
Ultimately, Gilb and Nahm said
they are confident that this focus will
help draw in readership.
"I think our paper is going to look
better than anything out there," Gilb
said. "And it's doing something com
pletely different.The audience is any
one who's simply interested in what
other Stanford students are thinking.
You can pick it up and see the deep
est thoughts of your classmates."
Several students expressed inter
est in this type of publication.
"I'm bored with just doing aca
demic writing," said freshman Jack
Browning. "I wanted to broaden my
experience as a writer. I'm not both
ered who reads it — if three people
read it, great. If one person reads it,
great."

The publication has also been very
supported by University employees,
according to Gilb and Nahm.
"Professors are happy to hear
about it," Gilb said. "You tell them
you're doing non-academic writing
and reading out of class and they hug
you."
But, the magazine is unaffiliated
with specific academic depart
ments. The staff has applied for
funding from the ASSU Publica
tions Board, the result of which
they will find out today. Aside from
this, the magazine plans to gain
much of its funding through adver
tisements about the local arts com
munity. The San Francisco Sym
phony has already bought an ad
vertisement in the next issue.
"It's kind of an experiment to see
if we can live off of money from the
San Francisco community," Gilb said.
Because of this, the next issue,
which will come out in November,
will be published on a limited release.
"We're going to make higher qual
ity issues, at the risk of a smaller run
— get your hands on 'em quick!"
Nahm said.
