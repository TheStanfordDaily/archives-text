(U-WIRE) MORGANTOWN, W.Va. —
Representatives from www.google.com shared
"tips and tricks" to help college students in their
everyday searches during a nationwide confer
ence call with college newspapers from around
the country.
According to Mayoni Matsuno, a Google rep
resentative, the worldwide Internet search en
gine first began in September of 1998 and since
then has been striving to make users' lives easier.
"Our goal is to make your life as easy as we can,"
Matsuno said. "Google is truly dedicated about
helping students."
During Thursday's 45-minute conference call,
Debbie Jaffe, Google's Group Project Market
ing Manager, said Google has many other uses
besides just being a convenient search engine.
Jaffe noted that if a mathematical equation is
typed into the normal search engine, the Google

Calculator will answer the equation. Also, Jaffe
said the search can translate basic Chinese, Kore
an, Spanish, Japanese and many other languages.
Some of the other tips and tricks included
word definitions and the ability to answer ques
tions typed into the search engine. According to
Jaffe, if a Google user wants to find out Albert
Einstein's Birthday, all they need to do is type in
"Birthday Albert Einstein" and the date is
brought up.
Jaffe also spoke about other program sand
features Google has been developing. Along
with the normal Internet search engine, Jaffe
spoke about their new program "Google Talk."
"The downloadable Windows application al
lows users to speak to each other around the
world for free," Jaffe said. Besides free online call
ing to anywhere in the world, Jaffe said Google
Talk also allows a free Instant Messenger service.
According to Jaffe, Google Talk users can
speak to anyone with an Internet connection and
a headset. Jaffe said this feature will save people

money on long-distance calling.
"Google's passion is helping university stu
dents," Matsuno said. Because the initial Google
Web site was started by two Stanford University
students, Jaffe said many of their programs are
focused toward students.
"Google Scholar" allows students to search
scholarly texts online. Each book, reprint and
peer-reviewed paper has the number of individ
uals who cited the text in their work. Jaffe said
the texts with higher citing numbers are shown to
be more reliable Although Google has expanded
many new programs and search engine capabili
ties, Jaffe said one of their biggest achievements
is the free offering of "Gmail."
When Gmail was first launched, Jaffe said
users needed to be invited by other users before
signing up fora free email account.
"Historically (users) needed to get an invite,"
Jaffe said "When we first launched (Gmail), it
was to gauge the system and our capabilities;
now Gmail is free."
