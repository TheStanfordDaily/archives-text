## Dining changes reviewed 
### SARAH BROUDY STAFF WRITER 
In preparation for the 2005-2006
academic year, Stanford Dining un
derwent several controversial
changes involving meal plans and
dining hall themes. In previous
years, dining halls such as Wilbur
and Manzanita gave students the
option of buying a certain number
of points per term to purchase food,
whereas Stern, Florence Moore,
Lakeside and Ricker Dining Halls
used a meal plan with a fixed num
ber of meals per week.
But starting this year, students
living in undergraduate dorms must
choose one of three meal plans: 19
meals per week, 14 meals per week
with 420 Cardinal Dollars or 10
meals per week with 750 Cardinal
dollars.
Rafi Taherian, director of Stan

ford Dining, explained in an e-mail
that many found the points system
confusing.
"We worked together with the
ASSU and other student represen
tations to develop the current meal
plan which provides additional flex
ibility, simplicity and choice for stu
dents," he said.
The points-to-meals switch drew
praise from many students. Nishma
Sachedina, a freshman living in Ju
nipero,said she appreciates the new
meal system.
"Because the points are rationed
out for you, you don't have to worry
about points each time you eat," she
said.
A freshman who wished to re
main anonymous also pointed out
that she was able to take entire
loaves of bread with this system,
while an unnamed sophomore
agreed that she liked not having to

weigh her salads every time she
checked out.
On the other hand, sophomore
Yaron, who eats at Stern, com
plained that his unused meals don't
roll over to the next week as his
points in Wilbur used to, which he
called "ridiculous."
Taherian defended the change.
"The dining halls that have the
highest satisfaction as determined
by student surveys are in the all you
care to eat facilities," he said. "ITie
plans with the lowest satisfaction
levels were the plans with the low
est number of meal choices."
Another major change is what
Taherian calls "Destination Din
ing," in which each dining hall has a
specific type of cuisine in addition
to their regular menu offerings.
"We have started with a Latin

concept at Stern, Southeast Asian at
Manzanita and Branner, Middle
Eastern at Florence Moore, Italian
at Lakeside, Mediterranean at Rick
er and Chinese at Wilbur," Taherian
said.
Several students reported liking
the theme dining, but noticed that
they were already starting to become
sick of them at the end of the second
week of school.

A resident fellow who eats at
Wilbur said that "numerous people
(feel) that while quality hasn't de
clined, variety has diminished, which
leads to a tendency for undergrads to
seek dining options elsewhere."
He added, "It would he nice to
have variety in each dining hall
rather than students trying to create
it by moving."
Yaron in Stern agreed.
"The problem with themes is that
it requires you to go further away for
good food," he said.
In Wilbur, Amit Vasudev agreed
that the food was good, but that
"Chinese food is going to get boring

soon, they should add more variety."
Brandon Wilson, who also lives in
Wilbur, vocalized the need for more
fresh produce, one of the major com
plaints about Wilbur food.
Taherian affirmed Stanford Min
ing's commitment to providing the
best food and emphasized the role
students can play in shaping the din
ing hall options in his plans for how
to improve Stanford Dining in up
coming years.
"[We will] continue to work with
the students in developing the best
program that meets all our students,
parents and other stakeholders," he
said.
