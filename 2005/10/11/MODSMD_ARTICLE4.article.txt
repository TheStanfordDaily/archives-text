# Wireless networks spread on campus
## Row houses equipped with wireless connections

Ethernet cords may soon he an
endangered species on Stanford's
campus. All 36 row houses, as well as
the five houses in the Cowell Clus
ter, are now equipped for wireless
networking. Residents have wireless
internet access in their rooms, com
mon areas and in some cases the
outdoor areas immediately sur
rounding their houses.
"Doing a building properly re
quires a whole lot of money, some
thing we didn't have," said Ethan Rik
leen, the networking and systems ad
ministrator for Residential Comput
ing (ResComp). "For the Row, we
gave the Residential Computing Con
sultants (RCCs) three wireless access
points per house and gave them flexi
bility in placing them. This isn't a per
manent solution, but it gave us imme
diate coverage for 1,600 students."
In addition to the Row, residential
wireless networking is provided in
Branner, Manzanita Park, Sterling
Quad, Florence Moore, Stern. Wilbur
and parts of Roble and Escondido
Village. Ideally, all on-campus hous
ing would have wireless capabilities;

however, funding has kept ResComp
and IT Services from realizing this
goal.
"Unfortunately a good chunk of
on-campus housing still has no official
wireless coverage," Rikleen said. "We
think it would take about one million
dollars to properly provide wireless in
all of the residences, hut thus far that
money has not been forthcoming."
However, there are ways students
can circumvent a lack of official wire
less in their residence. One option is
for residents or their RCC to pur
chase a wireless access point and set
up their own networks. There is noth
ing in university policy which pro
hibits students from setting up their
own wireless networks. The
ResComp Web site even offers infor
mation for students interested in set
ting up their own residential wireless
networks.
Setting up unofficial wireless net
works does pose some problems, as
students and RCCs may run into
monetary constraints or a limited net
work capacity.
