# Wireless networks spread on campus
## Row houses equipped with wireless connections 
### MARINA LIEBAN STAFF WRITER 
Ethernet cords may soon he an
endangered species on Stanford's
campus. All 36 row houses, as well as
the five houses in the Cowell Clus
ter, are now equipped for wireless
networking. Residents have wireless
internet access in their rooms, com
mon areas and in some cases the
outdoor areas immediately sur
rounding their houses.
"Doing a building properly re
quires a whole lot of money, some
thing we didn't have," said Ethan Rik
leen, the networking and systems ad
ministrator for Residential Comput
ing (ResComp). "For the Row, we
gave the Residential Computing Con
sultants (RCCs) three wireless access
points per house and gave them flexi
bility in placing them. This isn't a per
manent solution, but it gave us imme
diate coverage for 1,600 students."
In addition to the Row, residential
wireless networking is provided in
Branner, Manzanita Park, Sterling
Quad, Florence Moore, Stern. Wilbur
and parts of Roble and Escondido
Village. Ideally, all on-campus hous
ing would have wireless capabilities;

however, funding has kept ResComp
and IT Services from realizing this
goal.
"Unfortunately a good chunk of
on-campus housing still has no official
wireless coverage," Rikleen said. "We
think it would take about one million
dollars to properly provide wireless in
all of the residences, hut thus far that
money has not been forthcoming."
However, there are ways students
can circumvent a lack of official wire
less in their residence. One option is
for residents or their RCC to pur
chase a wireless access point and set
up their own networks. There is noth
ing in university policy which pro
hibits students from setting up their
own wireless networks. The
ResComp Web site even offers infor
mation for students interested in set
ting up their own residential wireless
networks.
Setting up unofficial wireless net
works does pose some problems, as
students and RCCs may run into
monetary constraints or a limited net
work capacity.
year budgetary restrictions
on the quality of hardware I was able
to afford out of pocket combined with
an idiosyncrasy of the residential net
work made it impossible to provide
usable-quality, reasonably reliable
wireless access in a house of fifty plus peo
ple "said Diana Gentry, the RCC in Colum
bae. "This year 1 haven't seen any problems
like that, and so everyone who wants to is
able to connect."
Wireless internet access is something
students have come to expect on college
campuses across the country, both in pub
lic areas and in their residences. Prospec
tive freshmen are even taking schools'
wireless capabilities into account when se
lecting a college.
"With most students bringing laptops |to
school), wireless coverage has become a
factor for ProFros picking which school to
attend," Rikleen said. "That may seem silly,
since data jacks are everywhere, but people
are coming to expect wireless coverage."

Wireless connections abound on campus

Some RCCs agreed that there is a rising
expectation of universal wireless coverage
on campus.
"Residents generally take wireless ac
cess for granted," said senior Fred Chang,
the RCC in Hammarskjold. "They as
sume that it exists and it shocked them
when it wasn't set up when they arrived
early this year."
Residents in Columbae experienced
similar disappointment when their wireless
connections were not fully functional at the
start of the year.
"There was a week at the start of the
quarter before our WAPs were installed
during which I got almost constant com
plaints about the lack of wireless access,"
Gentry said.

So far, the wireless network on the Row
has been running smoothly and residents'
responses have been positive.
"The connection's been great so far,"
said senior Vinay Mahagaokar, a resident in
Xanadu."l think it's very important to have
wireless,especially when I host group meet
ings in Xanadu. My group members gener
ally bring their laptops, and need to connect
to the Internet."
I laving wireless internet access has even
helped maintain feelings of community
within residences.
"Particularly in a co-op, which depends
on an atmosphere of openness, having peo
ple tied to their own desks in their own
rooms is a damper," Gentry said. "When
people c;in work or idle around on the In-

temet in the lounge, the cluster, or someone
else's room, it fosters the feeling of group
ownership of the house that is vital to unify
ing the community."
While wireless coverage has been fairly
reliable on campus so far, that does not
mean problems will not arise in the future.
Wireless connections in general tend to be
slower and less secure than traditional Eth
ernet connections.
"Wireless is still a new technology, and
it's evolving constantly," Rikleen said. "Ten
years ago we still had a few different kinds
of wired Ethernet around campus, and se
curity wasn't very good.That stabilized, and
wireless will too, but it's going to take a
while. So enjoy it, but accept it for what it is
â€” a work in progress."
