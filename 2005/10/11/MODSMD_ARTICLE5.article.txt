## Golf cart policy reinforced Only students with disabilities qualify 
### ZEWDE YERASWORK STAFF WRITER 
The overabundance of golf carts
on campus has moved the Universi
ty to take action to communicate
the proper policy on these vehicles
to the student body. As it stands,
only students with disabilities are
allowed to use golf carts on campus.
Over the summer, a number of
meetings were held to review the
existing policy on golf carts and to
ensure that it was better explained
to the entire campus.
According to Associate Vice
Provost for Environmental Health
and Safety Larry Gibbs, the major
modifications made to the policy
this summer involve the issuing au

thority — essentially, the people
who have the authority to distribute
golf carts on campus.
The policy provides guidance re
garding the acquisition and valid
business use of golf cart-type vehi
cles on the Stanford campus. It es
tablishes a method for the Universi
ty to track the registration of golf
cart-type vehicles, limits the valid
business use and addresses the asso
ciated risk management issues.
However, there has been no
change to the Authorized Use sec
tion of the policy that prohibits stu
dent use of golf-cart type vehicles
for personal transportation, other
than for disability-related needs or
for SURE Escort Services.
As Stanford begins enforcing a
modified version of its golf cart use
policy, the Student Disabilities Re
sources Center (SDRC) insists its
main concern with golf-carts is their

widespread proliferation on campus.
Director of SDRC Joan Bisagno
explained that Stanford buys its golf
carts from several vendors.
"Prices vary according to the
make, model, degree of customiza
tion and whether a new or used cart is
purchased," she said. "New carts can
cost as much as $7,500 and upward."
Though the cost may seem high,
one student, who wishes to remain
anonymous, claims that despite hav
ing violated the policy, it is worth in
vesting in a golf cart.
"Its value doesn't depreciate
much over your college career," he
said. "You can sell it again after four
years for almost the same price."
Despite the übiquity of the carts
on campus, according to Bisagno
there are approximately three stu
dents per year who are registered

with the SDRC who use golf carts.
"There may be other students
with disability-related needs who
are not registered with the SDRC
who do own carts and use them.This
number is also likely to be very low,"
she said. "The SDRC has not insti
tuted any policy at all other than
University policy."
1 lowever, she admits there is con
cern about the increasing numbers
of carts being used on campus. The
SDRC does not give out golf carts to
the students — it operates the
DisGo service, which "transports
Stanford community members with
mobility problems door to door."
Sophomore Brad Bachelder,
who broke his leg during rugby
practice last year, said that he hopes
the SDRC will be able to help in
jured students acquire golf carts
more directly.
"They didn't really help last
year," he said. "They just gave me
the number fora cart company."
Although athletes have a higher
incidence of injury than the average
student, Gibbs said that the existing
policy applies to the entire student
body.
"The Department of Athletics is
also communicating and reinforcing
the existing policy to all student ath
letes," said Gibbs.
Bisagno agreed.
"If the athlete has a temporary or
permanent disability, he or she
would qualify as an authorized
user," she said. "Unless the student
has a disability there is no need to
use a cart.This is not a new policy."
Sophomore Sam Fankuchen,one
of the students who had his cart ap
proved by the SDRC, believes that
some students will be angry about
the policy.
"Only a few people have gotten
their carts approved with the
SDRC," he said. "The policy has al
ways been this way, but it was just
never really enforced."
Fankuchen believes that the
"crackdown" on student golf carts is
mainly clarification of the SDRC
policy."
"The SDRC has accomplished
what they're trying to accomplish,"
he said.
