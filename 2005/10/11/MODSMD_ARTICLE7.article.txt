# AFTER STANFORD
## Bachelor's degrees open doors Liberal arts majors explore post-graduation options 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
The school year has just begun, but
seniors have already started to think
about graduation. The prospect of
gainful employment has inspired many
to start exploring their options.
Whether that involves standardized
tests, multiple interviews or panicked
soul-searching, students are well aware
that finding a job may be an arduous
process.
But for the senior who plans to
leave Stanford with a bachelor of arts
degree, the job search may take on a
slightly different tone. While their
peers in the computer science depart
ment may already have prospective
employers calling with offers, most lib
eral arts majors do not always have
clear post-graduation plans.
"I'm really interested in foster care.
so I'm planning on working fora
foster care organization or a non
governmental organization (NGO)
for two years and then writing a
grant for non-profits," said senior
Laura Adams, an English major. "1
haven't really started looking fora
job yet though."
Many seniors majoring in the hu
manities and social sciences have
taken a similarly flexible approach
to the job search.
"I think I'd like to go into man
agement consulting or work for an
NGO in Cambodia," said senior

Naree Chan, a public policy major.
"I have a few connections in Cam
bodia that I will look into — I want
to do international health stuff, but I
have an interest in business too."
While their futures may not be as
secure, liberal arts majors at Stan
ford for the most part have no re
grets about their decision.
"Of course we have a great engi
neering school, but I think to a cer
tain extent, you benefit more from
having majored in the humanities at
Stanford," Adams said. "A humani
ties major is a lot about gaining in
tellectual capacity, and interacting
with other people who are as deeply
involved in the same thing is a huge
part of the experience."
In addition to the experiential
benefits, the value of a bachelor of

arts degree from Stanford may ben
efit from the prestige of certain de
partments.
"Being a Stanford graduate defi
nitely helps in the job search," said
Lance Choy, director of the Career
Development Center. "People
know that we have some top-notch
students here, of course. There is
also a halo effect — I think there's
definitely an edge for the Stanford
student simply because we have
great departments."
Adams said that she is not con
cerned about finding work.
"In the foster care area you have
such a high turnover rate, so I don't
think it'll be that hard to find a job,"
she said. "I just need to gather more
information on the possibilities."
According to Choy, the panic

that some students experience
while looking for jobs is normal.
"There's always a certain degree
of anxiety when you're making a
change. Of course there are some
students who are just starting to
think about what they want to do,
and they're feeling very anxious
about their futures," said Choy."But
I think that's very common when
you're making a transition, and not
necessarily a result of poor job
prospects for people in the liberal
arts."
Choy offered reassurance.
"There are plenty of jobs avail
able to liberal arts majors in a range
of areas," he said. "Students go into
education, government, the busi
ness sector, to name a few. There are
so many options."
