### SADAQAT JAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan
— Rescuers struggled to reach re
mote, mountainous areas Sunday
after Pakistan's worst-ever earth
quake wiped out entire villages,
buried roads in rubble and knocked
out electricity and water supplies.
The death toll stood at 20,000 and
was expected to rise.
In this devastated Himalayan
city, wounded covered by shawls lay
in the street, and villagers used
sledgehammers to break through
the rubble of flattened schools and
homes seeking survivors.
The quake collapsed the city's
Islamabad Public School. Soldiers
with white cloth tied around their
mouths and noses pulled a small
girl's dust-covered body from the
ruins, while the body of a boy re
mained pinned between heavy
slabs of concrete.
The United Nations said more
than 2.5 million people need shelter
after the magnitude-7.6 earthquake
along the Pakistan-India border.
The Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Relief said it urgent
ly needed 200,000 winterized tents.
President Gen. Pervez Mushar
raf complained of a shortage of hel
icopters needed to ferry in relief
workers, food and medical supplies,
and appealed for international help.
In Washington, President Bush

said eight U.S. military choppers
were being moved to help in rescue
efforts, and he promised financial
assistance. India, which has fought
three wars with Pakistan, also of
fered assistance, as did Israel, which
has no relations with the Muslim
nation.
"We are handling the worst dis
aster in Pakistan's history." chief
army spokesman Maj. Gen.
Shaukat Sultan said.
The quake was felt across a wide
swath of South Asia from central
Afghanistan to western
Bangladesh. It swayed buildings in
the capitals of three nations, with
the damage spanning at least 250

miles from Jalalabad in
Afghanistan to Srinagar in north
ern Indian territory. In Islamabad, a
10-story building collapsed, killing
at least 24 people.
Late Sunday, helmeted rescuers
found a survivor after hearing his
cries for help.The thin man in a blue
shirt, looking dazed, emerged on his
own with little help and stood in
front of a crowd of cheering on
lookers. One rescuer patted his
head, and the man waved and
pumped his fist in the air.
Pakistan said the death toll ranged
between 20.000 and 30.000. India re
ported more than 600 dead, and
Afghanistan said four were killed.

"We have enough manpower
but we need financial support... to
cope with the tragedy," Musharraf
said in Rawalpindi, according to the
state-run news agency Associated
Press of Pakistan.
He also appealed for medicine
and tents.
Musharraf told the British
Broadcasting Corp. he knew of as
many as 20.000 people killed, and
Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz told
CNN about 43,000 people were in
jured.
Musharraf said the only way to
reach many far-flung areas was by
helicopter because roads were im
passable.
