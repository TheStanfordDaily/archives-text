In the article. "Stanford drops in
rankings," published on Oct. 11
2(H)5.The Daily inaccurately report
ed that Stanford had dropped from
the number four position to numbei
five in the US. News & World Re
port annual college rankings. In fact
Stanford has been tied for number
five since 2(K)4.1 , he story also stated
that Stanford does not respond to
the reputational survey sent out by
the magazine. In actuality, the Uni
versity does respond and has not
protested the practice since 1998.
