## Tales of the City 
### 
Occasionally, when I write these
columns, people actually read them.
And even more infrequently they
send me e-mails.
Last week's masterpiece elicited two re
sponses. One was from someone involved in
the CAS A (check out www.casa.org, they even
posted my article), which appears to be some
kind of support group for harmony addicts.
Apparently, they're not socially awkward
at all and their music is complex and non-bar
bershoppy. So, having been shamed into it, let
me offer my humblest and umm... heartfelt
apologies for any offense taken by Stanford's
singers. Sorry.
But enough about that lot and on to busi
ness. I've been in the City fora few weeks
now and I figure it's about time to share my
crazy, fun-packed life with all of you.
TTiey're filming a movie a block away from
my house. Some Will Smith feature, apparent
ly. It's pretty exciting, I'm hoping that this is my
chance to befriend the stars and escape from
the humdrum world of theoretical physics.
Should that plan fail, though, San Francis
can life may have enough going for it to alle
viate the ennui of existence without the need
for Hollywood's millions.
Before waxing lyrical about my various
city "antics" I suppose I should take the op
portunity to fill up my word limit with some
background.
While my little house on York Street is
starting to feel like home, the process of find
ing the place was horribly traumatic. Answer
ing craigslist ads for roommates is a surpris
ingly good way to destroy any vestiges of self
respect you have left after a couple of years in
grad school.
The process is a little like Internet dating
both in the desired result (a place to sleep)
and in the mechanics. You start by replying to
postings with e-mails that convey (or hide if
you're a failing budding physicist) the full
force of your personality.
Next, if you make it past the first round fil
ter. you get to meet your prospective living
partners in person. Under the cold, hard
scrutiny of ordinary folks I had serious trou -
ble holding up. All those little quirks I had
spent years developing were suddenly less
charming — I think muttering to myself may
have worked against me.
Luckily, I eventually found a house (the
fools) that would take me, and here 1 am, liv
ing the dream.
Actually, I mean that sincerely. I've wanted
to live in San Francisco fora very long time. I
read Armistead Maupin's "Tales of the City"
books when I was around 16, and I was hooked.
I see myself as a Mary-Ann Singleton type
(only in spirit — I've yet to immerse myself
that much in City life),a young innocent start
ing on an adventure in a brand new city.
Even better, at first blush it seemed as if my
housemates might fill out the rest of the Ma
condray Lane cast. There's definitely a poten
tial Brian, Mona and Michael somewhere with
in Gene, Hilary, Colleen and Eric. I just know it.
Moreover, even aside from their potential
as characters in my personal novel, the new
housemates serve a valuable purpose. They're
real people (well mostly, anyway). This is a
dramatic change from campus where every
one I met was like me: odd, very, very odd.
Now, I have no problems with oddness. In
fact, I'm a huge fan and I've been cultivating
it for years (more about that some other
time). However, the lack of variety was sti
fling, and eventually you want to prove to
yourself that just because you fit the profile
of a serial killer, it doesn't necessarily mean
that you are.
Sadly (if not surprisingly) my new life is
not without its problems. Much like my
would be avatar. I have found the first few
weeks here a little bewildering. And, in many
ways, a touch sobering.
Despite my seemingly endless complaints
about the torturous nature of graduate stu
dent life and its many, many deficiencies,
there are a few things going for it.
You see, whilst we don't really go out, have
fun and meet people as much as we should, at
least there are ready mechanisms to do so.
When the umbilical cord has been
stretched almost to breaking, however, those
mechanisms are hard to access. Out in the city
there's no GCC,no Rains parties, no CAs and
no classes. You are (sort of) on your own.
That's a serious shock to the system and
it's a brutal leap forward in the growing-up
process to find myself in the position of hav
ing to build up friendships without help.
Still, the challenge is easily commensurate
with the reward. Eventually you have to go
out and face the world without parents,
schools or colleges to do the hard work for
you, and now seems as good a time as any.
Plus, when it all goes horribly wrong I'll have
enough material to fill up another half dozen
of these columns...

Have you recently escaped the bubble and are
you looking for people to hang out with in the
city. If so, don 't e-mail navins@stanford.edu;
he's trying to find people whose addresses don't
end in .edu.

at all and their music is complex and non-bar
bershoppy. So, having been shamed into it, let
me offer my humblest and umm... heartfelt
apologies for any offense taken by Stanford's
singers. Sorry.
But enough about that lot and on to busi
ness. I've been in the City fora few weeks
now and I figure it's about time to share my
crazy, fun-packed life with all of you.
TTiey're filming a movie a block away from
my house. Some Will Smith feature, apparent
ly. It's pretty exciting, I'm hoping that this is my
chance to befriend the stars and escape from
the humdrum world of theoretical physics.
Should that plan fail, though, San Francis
can life may have enough going for it to alle
viate the ennui of existence without the need
for Hollywood's millions.
Before waxing lyrical about my various
city "antics" I suppose I should take the op
portunity to fill up my word limit with some
background.
While my little house on York Street is
starting to feel like home, the process of find
ing the place was horribly traumatic. Answer
ing craigslist ads for roommates is a surpris
ingly good way to destroy any vestiges of self
respect you have left after a couple of years in
grad school.
The process is a little like Internet dating
both in the desired result (a place to sleep)
and in the mechanics. You start by replying to
postings with e-mails that convey (or hide if
you're a failing budding physicist) the full
force of your personality.
Next, if you make it past the first round fil
ter. you get to meet your prospective living
partners in person. Under the cold, hard
scrutiny of ordinary folks I had serious trou -
ble holding up. All those little quirks I had
spent years developing were suddenly less
charming — I think muttering to myself may
have worked against me.
Luckily, I eventually found a house (the
fools) that would take me, and here 1 am, liv
ing the dream.
Actually, I mean that sincerely. I've wanted
to live in San Francisco fora very long time. I
read Armistead Maupin's "Tales of the City"
books when I was around 16, and I was hooked.
I see myself as a Mary-Ann Singleton type
(only in spirit — I've yet to immerse myself
that much in City life),a young innocent start
ing on an adventure in a brand new city.
Even better, at first blush it seemed as if my
housemates might fill out the rest of the Ma
condray Lane cast. There's definitely a poten
tial Brian, Mona and Michael somewhere with
in Gene, Hilary, Colleen and Eric. I just know it.
Moreover, even aside from their potential
as characters in my personal novel, the new
housemates serve a valuable purpose. They're
real people (well mostly, anyway). This is a
dramatic change from campus where every
one I met was like me: odd, very, very odd.
Now, I have no problems with oddness. In
fact, I'm a huge fan and I've been cultivating
it for years (more about that some other
time). However, the lack of variety was sti
fling, and eventually you want to prove to
yourself that just because you fit the profile
of a serial killer, it doesn't necessarily mean
that you are.
Sadly (if not surprisingly) my new life is
not without its problems. Much like my
would be avatar. I have found the first few
weeks here a little bewildering. And, in many
ways, a touch sobering.
Despite my seemingly endless complaints
about the torturous nature of graduate stu
dent life and its many, many deficiencies,
there are a few things going for it.
You see, whilst we don't really go out, have
fun and meet people as much as we should, at
least there are ready mechanisms to do so.
When the umbilical cord has been
stretched almost to breaking, however, those
mechanisms are hard to access. Out in the city
there's no GCC,no Rains parties, no CAs and
no classes. You are (sort of) on your own.
That's a serious shock to the system and
it's a brutal leap forward in the growing-up
process to find myself in the position of hav
ing to build up friendships without help.
Still, the challenge is easily commensurate
with the reward. Eventually you have to go
out and face the world without parents,
schools or colleges to do the hard work for
you, and now seems as good a time as any.
Plus, when it all goes horribly wrong I'll have
enough material to fill up another half dozen
of these columns...

Have you recently escaped the bubble and are
you looking for people to hang out with in the
city. If so, don 't e-mail navins@stanford.edu;
he's trying to find people whose addresses don't
end in .edu.

And even more infrequently they
send me e-mails.
Last week's masterpiece elicited two re

the CAS A (check out www.casa.org, they even
