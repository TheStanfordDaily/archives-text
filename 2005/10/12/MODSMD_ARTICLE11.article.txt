tanford students y.
are undoubted
ly a dedicated
bunch, filling
their days with
classes, jobs, parties and
other activities. (Sleep?
What?) While the commit
ments can be overwhelm
ing, most people seem capa
ble of rising to the challenge.
But when students add
marriage and child-rearing
to the list of things that com
pete for their time, they say
the challenge is brought to a
whole new level.

} "I constantly find myself torn between family
and school," says Kevin Swan, a first-year master's
student in mechanical engineering from Alberta.
Canada. He lives on campus with his wife of four years,
TVish, and a 10-week-old son, Nigel. "Your family is number
one on your priority list. I know that I will never be able to
devote as much to my studies as others [without families]."
The need to strike a good balance between academic
commitments and family obligations is far from the only
difficulty confronting students with spouses and children.
Finance is another, more practical concern for many —
the cost of living fora family, particularly with healthcare
and insurance expenses, can be staggering.
Some students' spouses and partners who are not en
rolled at Stanford also say they face considerable difficul
ties. Many sacrifice their careers and leave behind friends
and family to join their spouses on the Farm, and once they
arrive, some find that they don't have as much opportuni
ty to socialize as the majority of students do.
"[Trish] doesn't have the option of meeting people in
classes or other school events that I would." Swan says.
"Also, with such a youngchild.it is hard for her to just take
off somewhere."
Fortunately, support services for students with families
abound on campus.The Graduate Life Office (GLO).a di
vision of the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, is a cen
tral source of information and advice regarding graduate
student life. According to Andy Hernandez, an assistant
dean of students at the GLO, the University provides
many support services that specifically cater to the needs
of married or partnered students.
"We have a very active residential program for graduate
student families at Escondido Village," Hernandez says.
"The GLO associate dean and two assistant deans are avail
able for personal consultation and support if difficulties
arise."
The Work Life Office, part of the University's human re
sources division, is perhaps the most comprehensive par
enting and family resource center on campus. For students.

faculty and staff, it
offers parenting classes and
counseling, support groups for
single parents and families of
children with special needs, a
backup childcare program and
~

even adoption assistance.
Although the University has sought to make Stanford a
welcoming place to be a married and partnered student with
family, many newly-arrived parents seem to find the provi
sion of campus daycare services surprisingly insufficient.
While the Work Life Office lists at least six on-campus chil
dren's programs that accommodate the various needs of
working parents, some parents complain that it can take as
long as a year for their kids to receive spaces.
"Upon admittance to Stanford and receiving the infor
mation in the mail about having a family, I thought we
would be set with daycare," says Amber Beth Pfefferkorn,
a master's student in education who lives with her hus
band and five-month-old daughter. "I dreamed of being
able to walk over during a break and see her.The reality is
that there is a waiting list of a year to get your kid into a
program. Not really very helpful, especially when my pro
gram is only nine months."
On top of these issues, international students and their
families face a unique category of challenges — raising a
family while attending school in an unfamiliar cultural and
linguistic environment can be rather harsh.
"The main difficulty spouses or partners face is loneliness,"
says Ines Barbosa, a community associate at Escondido Vil
lage who came to Stanford from Portugal as a spouse. Barbosa
is now an adviser and event organizer for graduate students.
"It is very easy to stay at home isolated, particularly if you are
a foreigner and have difficulty speaking English."
