Students feasted Monday night at the
Bechtel International Center on turkey,
stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce
and loads of pumpkin pie. Candles burned
brightly on tables and friends clinked their
glasses in toasts of gratitude, mingling amidst
cheerful music. It was the delectable, quin
tessential, warming Thanksgiving dinner —

Indeed, Oct. 10 marked the Canadian
holiday, and due to the efforts of the Stan
ford Canadian Club, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center hosted more than 120 Stan
ford students who couldn't venture north
for the occasion.
Kiri Heel, a doctoral student in musicol
ogy from Victoria, and sophomore Rosie
Warren, who hails from Calgary, both say
they look forward to Thanksgiving each
year because it means good food and good
company.
"I just loved having dinner with my fam
ily," Warren says of the Thanksgivings she
spent at home.
Thus, both believe that staying connect

ed with fellow Canadians at Stanford as the
holiday season begins is important — a sen
timent echoed by the 300 students involved
with the Canadian Club at Stanford.
According to Canadian Club Prime
Minister Michael Dolphin, a Canada native
and graduate student in aeronautics and as
tronautics. "Like any nationality in a for
eign country, Canadians like to meet other
Canadians here at Stanford. It helps them
feel a little more at home."
Canadian Thanksgiving is one of the
Stanford Canadian Club's biggest events of
the year, Dolphin says. And the concept be
hind the holiday is essentially the same as
that behind the occasion in the United
States. Both are celebrations of the harvest,
he explains, but since Canada's harvest
comes earlier. Canadians plan their feast
for the second Monday in October.
As in the United States, students in
Canada get the day off. But the Canadian
holiday weekend lasts three days, not four,
and unlike American families, Canadians
tend to limit this holiday gathering to im
mediate family.
While Mondav is the official holidav.

many families prepare dinner on Sunday
night, and each person delivers a short mes
sage of gratitude for the past year.

Stanford Canadian Club
Ilie Stanford Canadian Club is current
ly run by Dolphin and Jeff Shragge, also of
Canada, who is a graduate student in the
Geophysics Department. The club was
founded in 1994 bv a group of students hop
ing to strengthen ties within the Canadian
community on the Farm. Currently, under
graduates, graduate students and faculty
members are involved with the group,
Shragge says.
"It's nice to occasionally meet up with
other Canadians who shared similar experi
ences in their years before coming to Stan
ford," he remarks.
Each year, the club organizes cultural

events for its members such as the Thanks
giving feast and Remembrance Day — a
holiday on Nov. 11 that honors more than
100,000 Canadians who have died in mili
tary service.
Club leaders also bring high-profile
Canadians to speak on campus and coordi
nate events with the Canadian Embassy
and consulates so that Canadians from the
Bay Area can also participate in the group's
activities, according to Shragge. And the
Stanford Canadian community also plans
random, fun activities like "oh so cliche
"Hockey Nights,"" he says.
Canadians comprise the third-largest in
ternational group on campus with approxi
mately 500 students. For them, being Cana
dian is not unlike being American.
"The big differences come with respect
to things like healthcare and politics." Dol
phin says, adding that he is shocked by the
amount of money he has to spend on health
care each vear.

Students feasted Monday night at the
Bechtel International Center on turkey,
stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce
and loads of pumpkin pie. Candles burned
brightly on tables and friends clinked their
glasses in toasts of gratitude, mingling amidst
cheerful music. It was the delectable, quin
tessential, warming Thanksgiving dinner —
Canadian Thanksgiving dinner, that is
Indeed, Oct. 10 marked the Canadian
holiday, and due to the efforts of the Stan
ford Canadian Club, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center hosted more than 120 Stan
ford students who couldn't venture north
for the occasion.
Kiri Heel, a doctoral student in musicol
ogy from Victoria, and sophomore Rosie
Warren, who hails from Calgary, both say
they look forward to Thanksgiving each
year because it means good food and good
company.
"I just loved having dinner with my fam
ily," Warren says of the Thanksgivings she
spent at home.
Thus, both believe that staying connect

ed with fellow Canadians at Stanford as the
holiday season begins is important — a sen
timent echoed by the 300 students involved
with the Canadian Club at Stanford.
According to Canadian Club Prime
Minister Michael Dolphin, a Canada native
and graduate student in aeronautics and as
tronautics. "Like any nationality in a for
eign country, Canadians like to meet other
Canadians here at Stanford. It helps them
feel a little more at home."
Canadian Thanksgiving is one of the
Stanford Canadian Club's biggest events of
the year, Dolphin says. And the concept be
hind the holiday is essentially the same as
that behind the occasion in the United
States. Both are celebrations of the harvest,
he explains, but since Canada's harvest
comes earlier. Canadians plan their feast
for the second Monday in October.
As in the United States, students in
Canada get the day off. But the Canadian
holiday weekend lasts three days, not four,
and unlike American families, Canadians
tend to limit this holiday gathering to im
mediate family.
While Mondav is the official holidav.

many families prepare dinner on Sunday
night, and each person delivers a short mes
sage of gratitude for the past year.
Sophomore Erica Holland, who is not
Canadian, attended Monday's event at Stan
ford with her former Canadian roommate.
"I'm excited to celebrate Canadian
Thanksgiving," she says."From what I can
tell.it looks like American Thanksgiving."
Stanford Canadian Club
Ilie Stanford Canadian Club is current
ly run by Dolphin and Jeff Shragge, also of
Canada, who is a graduate student in the
Geophysics Department. The club was
founded in 1994 bv a group of students hop
ing to strengthen ties within the Canadian
community on the Farm. Currently, under
graduates, graduate students and faculty
members are involved with the group,
Shragge says.
"It's nice to occasionally meet up with
other Canadians who shared similar experi
ences in their years before coming to Stan
ford," he remarks.
Each year, the club organizes cultural

events for its members such as the Thanks
giving feast and Remembrance Day — a
holiday on Nov. 11 that honors more than
100,000 Canadians who have died in mili
tary service.
Club leaders also bring high-profile
Canadians to speak on campus and coordi
nate events with the Canadian Embassy
and consulates so that Canadians from the
Bay Area can also participate in the group's
activities, according to Shragge. And the
Stanford Canadian community also plans
random, fun activities like "oh so cliche
"Hockey Nights,"" he says.
Canadians comprise the third-largest in
ternational group on campus with approxi
mately 500 students. For them, being Cana
dian is not unlike being American.
"The big differences come with respect
to things like healthcare and politics." Dol
phin says, adding that he is shocked by the
amount of money he has to spend on health
care each vear.
