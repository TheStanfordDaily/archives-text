## Editorial Mausoleum party back from the dead? 
### 
As Halloween rolls around, students
are haunted by the rumor that there
will be a Mausoleum Party this fall. If
successfully reinstated, this year's Mau
soleum Party would mark the resurrection
of a tradition that died unceremoniously
three years ago. It would be a new experi
ence for most Stanford students, as well as
the first and last time the graduating seniors
of the class of'os would get to attend.
The annual Mausoleum Party was to be
funded by the Stanford Alumni Association
(SAA) until 2001, when the association de
cided that it was simply not worth the cost
to continue funding the event. Three years
after the fact, we are still perplexed by the
Alumni Association's decision to cut fund
ing.
Like many of the best Stanford traditions,
the Mausoleum Party acknowledges the his
tory of our University, albeit in an irreverent
way. One could argue that dancing in front of
our founders' graves on Halloween is our
way of reconciling our glorious past with our
uncertain future. Traditions like these are
what make Stanford unique. Distinctive
events like the Mausoleum Party help at
tract enrollment decisions from incoming
freshmen.They also forge a stronger senseof
school identity and attract donations from
nostalgic alumni members.
This is not the first time that the student
community has called for efforts to reinstate
the Mausoleum Party. The Daily ran a simi
lar editorial a year ago that bears a spooky
resemblance to this one, calling on student
groups to revive this dead tradition.

So until the Alumni Association decides
to reinstate funding for the Mausoleum
Party, we encourage the Absolute Fun com
mittee foot the bill for this event. The Ab
solute Fun committee is well poised to or
ganize this party, having successfully organ
ized many similar events in the last two
years. Also, the costs of organizing the party
should not be excessively burdensome, espe
cially given the outdoor venue of the party.
Most of the money will pay for hiring securi
ty personnel.
If the plans are successful, the Mau
soleum Party will be held a mere two weeks
after Full Moon on the Quad, which takes
place Oct. 17. At first, having Absolute Fun
sponsor two events in such close proximity
to each other may seem wasteful. It may
seem more cost-effective for Absolute Fun
to fund a spring event instead of two back
to-back parties in the fall. However, we feel
that there ought to be more events this
quarter to consolidate school spirit among
the incoming freshmen. Exotic Erotic,
Cowabunga and other parties provide
enough entertainment for students in the
spring.
But with Halloween less than a month
away, we have yet to see any definite plans
for the Mausoleum Party. This is a pressing
issue; the ASSU needs to get on the ball. Ab
solute Fun needs to ensure that the event is
adequately funded, invite guest performers,
hire security personnel and begin its publici
ty campaign. But ultimately, it will take the
collective effort of the entire student com
munity to get this party started.
