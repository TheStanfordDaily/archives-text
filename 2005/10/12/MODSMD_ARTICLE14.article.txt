## Forgetting campus and seeing life

ao eeing is forgetting what you see,"
said found music artist Joe Craven,
playing music on an angel food
cake pan this past Thursday. It was obviously
advice that the headlining guitarist sharing
the stage with Craven had taken to heart.
This headliner was 22-year-old Stanford
drop-out David Jacobs-Strain. But that isn't
the word we want; he had forgotten he had
become a dropout. On the stage we could all
see that he had become something else.
Jacobs-Strain's pursuit of blues super-star
dom falls somewhere between a fantasy and a
cautionary tale. Perhaps this helps to explain
the gaggle of Stanford students who crowded
the back rows of The Freight and Salvage on
Thursday Fora night we could forget what we
see every morning: students studying the
world instead of living in it. Still, course-read
ers peeked out of abandoned tote bags as we
danced in the aisle.The aging hippies cheered
his politics, but we were cheering his audacity.
We coveted his ability to walk away from
Stanford and onto a stage.
Everything we knew about him changed
when he performed. His Jewish Oregonian
speech rolled with a Southern lilt, and famil
iar stories took on epic proportions coming
through the microphone. We had seen this
man covered with curry powder in a kitchen
not so long ago. We had seen the fool that Se
cret Snowflake had made out of him. Or
maybe this musician was someone else, not
the boy who used to play guitar in the
acoustically superlative Roble bathrooms.
We too might have groupies if we had
dropped out two years ago.
We are not the only Stanford students to

have occasionally thought that the smartest
thing we could possibly do would be to leave.
The real world is waiting out there for us.
Everyone says it. It's the empty space after
every mention of the "Stanford Bubble." Out
there, we could dedicate our lives to bettering
the fortunes of Russian orphans. Out there,
we could bring the arts to culturally impover
ished Midwestern counties. Out there, we
could lift feminism to new heights by building
a multinational homemaking empire from
the ground up. Out there, we could be writers.
But inside the Stanford Bubble, we're just
weekly columnists. It's far from real journal
ism, just like Stanford is far from real life.
Still, we don't want to feel like Stanford is
a prerequisite to our lives. So much of college
is put in terms of biding your time and paying
your dues. But for nerds like us, the things we
do here are not incidental passions. We do not
see writing, discussing and learning as dis
tasteful side effects of a diploma-producing
drug.This is it. If this isn't real, well, then we're
paying real money for nothing.
We forget that at any moment we could
log in to Axess for the last time and withdraw
from all our classes. We could pack our bags
and start walking toward the ocean. At any
moment a recruiter from the New Yorker
might appear at our door, contract in hand,
begging for our mad columnist skillz. We
would hear her out, of course. But for us.
dropping out of Stanford would be like run
ning away to join the circus when we already
live in one.
