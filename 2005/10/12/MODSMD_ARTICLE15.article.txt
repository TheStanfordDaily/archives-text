Meal plan prices matter
I was excited to pick up The
Daily yesterday and see a front page
article about this year's meal plan
changes ("Dining Changes Re
viewed," Oct. 11), since it has been a
topic of discussion among myself
and some friends recently. Howev
er, I was very disappointed after
reading Sarah Broudy's piece be
cause, while she made a point of out
lining the meal plan choices at the
beginning of the article, she failed to
address a major issue associated
with the new system: a complete
lack of variety in price.
Starting this year, undergrads liv
ing in dorms are not only forced to
buy a meal plan, but are also forced
to spend a set amount on that meal
plan ($1,691 for the fall, $4,656 for

the entire year), since the differences
in the number of meals offered by
each plan are supposedly "made up
for" by varying levels of Cardinal
Dollars. This price is higher than
even the most expensive meal plans
last year and provides no lower-cost
options.
Maybe the author of that article
and the students she chose to inter
view arc living in a world where
money is not an issue, but for myself
and other Stanford students this is
not the case. The disregard this new
University policy seems to have for
those of us who relied on meal plan
variation to budget ourselves is
something that should have been a
focal issue in yesterday's piece â€”
rather than heated debates over
"Destination Dining," and the con
fessions of freshmen who "wish to re

main anonymous" about hoarding
whole loaves of bread under the all
you-can-eat system.
And, while I acknowledge Stan
ford Dining Director RafiTaherian's
explanation that the points system
was confusing and inflexible, I'm a
little skeptical to believe that a new
system that results in more money
for Stanford and less choice for me is
really in my best interest. Unfortu
nately, yesterday's article didn't ad
dress those issues. As an independ
ent student newspaper, I would ex
pect The Daily to do more to investi
gate and represent student interests,
and less to simply echo those of the
administration.
