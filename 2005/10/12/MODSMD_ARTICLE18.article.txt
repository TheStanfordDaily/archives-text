Let me just get things started by saying
that I had no intentions of making this
a gossip column, but the recent an
nouncement that Tom and Katie have pro
duced spawn forced me to take action.
Now, I can't say I really blame them. The
desire to have a child is a pretty basic element
of humanity. And since I don't know either of
them that well (I thought I knew Tom fairly
well back in late 19905, but as it turns out I was
just really bored and they were showing
"Jerry McGuire" pretty much non-stop on
TBS), 1 probably shouldn't make judgments
about their decision to have a child.
Maybe they sat down and had a rational
conversation about it. Maybe Tom was so ex
cited that he called Oprah to schedule anoth
er sofa/trampoline performance. Maybe Tom
realized that "I got a woman pregnant" is a
pretty convincing argument for the case that
he, in fact, likes women (thanks for the re
minder, again, Tom). Or, maybe Katie decid
ed that since Tom is over a decade-and-a-half
older than she is, he'll make a much better fa
ther than her previous boyfriend who was ac
tually a year younger.
Who knows? But if we are to believe that
this child is a product of their beautiful het
erosexual union (and not just a freak turkey
baster accident).shouldn't we all be happy for
them?
Yet, I confess that when I heard the news,
my reaction was to announce out loud to
everyone else in the CHRAS computer lab
that "I hope — for their child's sake — that
'crazy' isn't genetic."
For the longest time I couldn't figure out

why it bothered me so much that they were
having a baby. Then, as I sat shoveling a hot
dog down my gullet at last week's LGBT grad
student barbeque, it hit me: I'm jealous.
You see, contrary to popular belief, the life
of a Ph.D. student at Stanford isn't as "ooh la
la" and glamorous as it might seem. Not only
was I at the LG BT barbeque for the free food,
but I was also hopeful that maybe my life of
solitude and loneliness would disappear with
the arrival of a hot new grad student. My plan
was perfect: 1 would meet the man of my
dreams there among the beef patties and Diet
Cokes.
Other than the obvious fact that Hayden
Christensen is not a graduate student at Stan
ford (and thus was not at the barbeque), 1
came to the realization that it's pretty foolish
of me to go to these social events expecting to
find the domestic partner of my dreams.
Why? Not because Stanford doesn't have tal
ent, but because I'm in not in much of a place
to have things like celebrity husbands, chil
dren or even a pet at the moment.
So at the risk of sounding bitter and jaded.
I came to the conclusion that I'm jealous of
Tom and Katie for at least two reasons. The

first is that they just make it look so easy.
Poof! They've met and they're happily dating
and couch-jumping. Poof! They're engaged.
Poof! She's pregnant! I can barely manage my
relationship with Netflix, and they're already
making plans for when little Holmes-Cruise
pops out of the proverbial oven.
But the second reason why I'm jealous of
them is a little more personal. Let's just pre
tend that Hayden Christensen loved me as
much as I love him and together we were
jumping on couches and happily in love.
Thanks to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, gay
marriage is still not an option in California.
And, try as we might. I don't know how prob
able it will be that I can impregnate Hayden
and produce a little baby Christensen-Bad
Wound.
So, as all you pop culture junkies continue
to read about Tom and Katie, Nick and Jessi
ca, Ashton and Demi... and the many other
celebrity and non-celebrity couples that you
know, keep in mind that there are people like
me with real obstacles in the way of such hap
piness.
Now, I don't mean to rain on anyone's gay
pride parade. I think Tom and Katie deserve
the same sort of support that 1 would want if
Hayden and 1 defied the laws of nature and
California. So, for that reason, I'd like to per
sonally apologize to Tom and Katie. Congrat
ulations. May the god(s) of Scientology bless
you — and your offspring — abundantly!

Katie and Tom can send a note to Adam at
badwound@stanford.edu to accept his
apology.
