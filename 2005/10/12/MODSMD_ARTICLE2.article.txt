# Dept. of Labor reopens Univ. discrimination case
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In 1998, U.S. Department of
Labor investigators began looking
for evidence of discrimination at
Stanford in response to complaints
by 32 female and minority staff
members. Then, a year-and-a-half
later, they abruptly left — empty
handed. The case remained open,

and many of the complaints lingered.
Now, five years after the case dried
up, the investigators are back, looking
for evidence that Stanford, a recipi
ent of federal aid money, violated
federal anti-discrimination laws in
their hiring and tenure processes.
No reason was ever given for the
lengthy hiatus. Some of the original
complainants have said they believe
that the Bush administration —

which took office around the time
that the investigation petered out —
used its political clout to take pres
sure off the University.
"We know the investigation at
Stanford was put on hold," said
Colleen Crangle, a former re
searcher at the School of Medicine
and a member of the group com
plaint. "We're not sure why, but we
suspect that it had something to do

with the administration in Washing
ton. But we knew it would come
back. It will not be dropped. It never
has been summarily closed."
Although the federal govern
ment never completed the case, the
fallout from the original investiga
tion resulted in the departure of sev
eral prominent researchers and fac
ulty members. In 1999 Karen Sawis
lak, a former assistant professor of

history and member of the group
complaint, departed for UC-Berke
ley,claiming she could "not get a fair
hearing at the University." Other
complainants, ostensibly fearing a
similar fate, withdrew their names
after the Department of Labor
agreed to the University's request to
release complainant names.
Crangle, the former researcher,
won a $545,000 settlement from the

University after a jury determined
she had been wrongly dismissed for
speaking out about gender discrimi
nation. The verdict was appealed by
the University and settled out of
court in 2001.
"The minute you Ving up a com
plaint, you will become the enemy,"
said Crangle — who now runs a bioin
