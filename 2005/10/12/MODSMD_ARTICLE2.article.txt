# Dept. of Labor reopens Univ. discrimination case
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In 1998, U.S. Department of
Labor investigators began looking
for evidence of discrimination at
Stanford in response to complaints
by 32 female and minority staff
members. Then, a year-and-a-half
later, they abruptly left — empty
handed. The case remained open,

and many of the complaints lingered.
Now, five years after the case dried
up, the investigators are back, looking
for evidence that Stanford, a recipi
ent of federal aid money, violated
federal anti-discrimination laws in
their hiring and tenure processes.
No reason was ever given for the
lengthy hiatus. Some of the original
complainants have said they believe
that the Bush administration —

which took office around the time
that the investigation petered out —
used its political clout to take pres
sure off the University.
"We know the investigation at
Stanford was put on hold," said
Colleen Crangle, a former re
searcher at the School of Medicine
and a member of the group com
plaint. "We're not sure why, but we
suspect that it had something to do

with the administration in Washing
ton. But we knew it would come
back. It will not be dropped. It never
has been summarily closed."
Although the federal govern
ment never completed the case, the
fallout from the original investiga
tion resulted in the departure of sev
eral prominent researchers and fac
ulty members. In 1999 Karen Sawis
lak, a former assistant professor of

history and member of the group
complaint, departed for UC-Berke
ley,claiming she could "not get a fair
hearing at the University." Other
complainants, ostensibly fearing a
similar fate, withdrew their names
after the Department of Labor
agreed to the University's request to
release complainant names.
Crangle, the former researcher,
won a $545,000 settlement from the

University after a jury determined
she had been wrongly dismissed for
speaking out about gender discrimi
nation. The verdict was appealed by
the University and settled out of
court in 2001.
"The minute you Ving up a com
plaint, you will become the enemy,"
said Crangle — who now runs a bioin

formatics business — in an interview
with The Daily last night. "You can
never step down from that — you've
identified yourself as a troublemaker.

The whole idea that if you speak up
you're being courageous and can help
improve things — that's not even in
the lexicon of responses."
"I think that's the academic
game — that's what happens," said
one member of the original com
plaint who is no longer at Stanford
and asked not to be identified.
"You'd have to be naive to think

that it doesn't."
This perception leads many of the
complainants still at Stanford to
avoid speaking out publicly about
their allegations for fear of retalia
tion. One faculty member, in an
anonymous phone call to The Daily,
said that people that voice com
plaints or consider making com
plaints are threatened with possible

pay cuts or job loss.
University officials denied such
claims.
"We encourage people to speak
out about any kind of thing that's
going on," said Debra Zumwalt.gen
eral counsel to the University. "We
want to encourage that and we will
do whatever is necessary to protect
them. We view that as a service to the

University."
She also denied any wrongdoing
on the part of the University in con
nection with the Department of
Labor investigation.
"There was no evidence of any
discrimination or any improper be
havior," she said. "That was true then
and it's true today."
Discrimination cases apart from

the Department of Labor investiga
tion have continued to crop up since
then. In one prominent instance ear
lier this year, the University's only
female African-American surgeon
claimed she had been paid less than
her white male counterparts, passed
over for promotions and required to
submit to random drug screenings.
The University denied all claims.

formatics business — in an interview
with The Daily last night. "You can
never step down from that — you've
identified yourself as a troublemaker.

The whole idea that if you speak up
you're being courageous and can help
improve things — that's not even in
the lexicon of responses."
"I think that's the academic
game — that's what happens," said
one member of the original com
plaint who is no longer at Stanford
and asked not to be identified.
"You'd have to be naive to think

that it doesn't."
This perception leads many of the
complainants still at Stanford to
avoid speaking out publicly about
their allegations for fear of retalia
tion. One faculty member, in an
anonymous phone call to The Daily,
said that people that voice com
plaints or consider making com
plaints are threatened with possible

pay cuts or job loss.
University officials denied such
claims.
"We encourage people to speak
out about any kind of thing that's
going on," said Debra Zumwalt.gen
eral counsel to the University. "We
want to encourage that and we will
do whatever is necessary to protect
them. We view that as a service to the

University."
She also denied any wrongdoing
on the part of the University in con
nection with the Department of
Labor investigation.
"There was no evidence of any
discrimination or any improper be
havior," she said. "That was true then
and it's true today."
Discrimination cases apart from

the Department of Labor investiga
tion have continued to crop up since
then. In one prominent instance ear
lier this year, the University's only
female African-American surgeon
claimed she had been paid less than
her white male counterparts, passed
over for promotions and required to
submit to random drug screenings.
The University denied all claims.
In 1998, U.S. Department of
Labor investigators began looking
for evidence of discrimination at
Stanford in response to complaints
by 32 female and minority staff
members. Then, a year-and-a-half
later, they abruptly left — empty
handed. The case remained open,

and many of the complaints lingered.
Now, five years after the case dried
up, the investigators are back, looking
for evidence that Stanford, a recipi
ent of federal aid money, violated
federal anti-discrimination laws in
their hiring and tenure processes.
No reason was ever given for the
lengthy hiatus. Some of the original
complainants have said they believe
that the Bush administration —

which took office around the time
that the investigation petered out —
used its political clout to take pres
sure off the University.
"We know the investigation at
Stanford was put on hold," said
Colleen Crangle, a former re
searcher at the School of Medicine
and a member of the group com
plaint. "We're not sure why, but we
suspect that it had something to do

with the administration in Washing
ton. But we knew it would come
back. It will not be dropped. It never
has been summarily closed."
Although the federal govern
ment never completed the case, the
fallout from the original investiga
tion resulted in the departure of sev
eral prominent researchers and fac
ulty members. In 1999 Karen Sawis
lak, a former assistant professor of

history and member of the group
complaint, departed for UC-Berke
ley,claiming she could "not get a fair
hearing at the University." Other
complainants, ostensibly fearing a
similar fate, withdrew their names
after the Department of Labor
agreed to the University's request to
release complainant names.
Crangle, the former researcher,
won a $545,000 settlement from the

University after a jury determined
she had been wrongly dismissed for
speaking out about gender discrimi
nation. The verdict was appealed by
the University and settled out of
court in 2001.
