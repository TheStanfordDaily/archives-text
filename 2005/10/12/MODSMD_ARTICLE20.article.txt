It's not uncommon to find national and regional
champions on Stanford's athletic teams, but it is rare
when those champions realize their potential as
early as their freshman year. Redshirt sophomore
Arianna Lambie did just that as a freshman two
years ago when she finished third for the Pacific-10
Conference cross country title and then 24th at the
2003 NCAA Championships.
In her rookie year of outdoor track and field,
Lambie was the top-ranked 1,500-meter cross coun
try freshman in the country and finished eighth in
her heat at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.
Lambie,ever composed and focused, handled her
immediate success with maturity.
"It just got me excited," Lambie said."To realize
I could enter the college competition world right up
there made me set my sights high. But I also knew 1
had more potential than that."
The Harvard Mass., native went on to finish third in
the 1,500 meters at the NCAA Outdoor Track and
Field Championship last year and began this year's
cross country season with a win at the Stanford Invi
tational — setting the bar high for this season.
"I do feel pressure this year," Lambie said.
"There are expectations to not let anyone down. I
really want to just be that consistent runner that
people believe me to be."
Like many cross country runners, Lambie started
as a soccer player. In seventh grade she went out for
track and field, and the rest is history. But her expo
sure to running took place even earlier in her life.
"My dad has always been a recreational runner,
and he took me to a track meet when I was in fifth
grade just for fun," Lambie said. "I ran a road race
once when I was in second grade as well."
It was not until 11th grade that the All-American
took up cross country. By the time she graduated,
Lambie had won eight Massachusetts state champi
onships in cross country and indoor and outdoor
track and held the third fastest time in U.S. history
— 4:37.23 — by a high school miler.
"I prefer track and field," Lambie said. "But I'm
coming to love cross country more. I just love the
fast feeling of the 1,500, but I also know how helpful
cross country can be to that race."
As with many cross country runners, the sacri
fices she had to make in order to become a serious
runner have been challenging.
"Giving up soccer was a huge challenge," Lambie
said. "The other big challenge is injuries. Trying to
stay healthy, thinking you're doing everything right

After growing up a soccer and track and field athlete, redshirt sophomore Arianna Lambie has found a new passion in
cross country. Last year, Lambie took ninth place in the mile event at the NCAA Indoor Championships.
and then facing injury — it's very
difficult. I was out twice freshman
year, and it's hard to stay motivated
when you're on the bike or in the
pool. But you realize how much you
like running and how much you want
to get back to it."
But Lambie has enough motiva
tion, though, that injuries do not
hold her back. After redshirting last
year's cross country season due to
injury, she was back in full force for
both the indoor and outdoor track
and field seasons. At the 2004
NCAA Indoor Championship, Lam
bie took ninth in the mile race.
"I think the curiosity of how much
your body and mind together can ac
complish is what motivates me most,"
Lambie said. "Seeing that you can do
amazing things that you weren't sure
you could do and then wondering
what will be the next thing. And being
close to the top and wondering how
close to the top you can get."
While Lambie is determined to
reach a pinnacle this year, her goals
are realistic.
"I want to feel like I'm in con
tention for the [NCAA Cross Coun
try] national title this year," Lambie
said. "Beyond Stanford, I go back
and forth. Part of me really wants to
try the professional world. Right
now I am shooting for 2008
Olympics, although I don't like to
commit to long term goals."
For now, the Earth Systems major
is focusing on co-captaining the
women's cross country squad, along

with redshirt sophomore Teresa
McWalters. It has been a test this
year with the resignation of head
women's cross country coach Dena
Evans, who had been a part of the
cross country and track and field
coaching staff for the past seven
years.
"It was a challenge to lead the
team through that, being captain and
an upperclassmen," Lambie said.
"But the team members really em
braced the change so it wasn't too
difficult to make sure that it would
n't be a negative transition. Teresa
and I were trying to do everything in
our power to keep the team pumped
up and looking up to the positive
things about the situation."
According to Lambie, Peter
Tegen — Evans replacement — has
made the transition smooth and en
joyable for the team. The new coach
has even cracked jokes to show how
much confidence he has in the team,
and he is working towards gaining
his athletes' trust.
The Stanford women's squad is
on the right path to defending its
10th straight Pac-10 Championship
title, and the women are once again
in contention for the national title.
According to Lambie, Arizona State
is the biggest rival at the conference
level for the Cardinal.
While the All-Academic thrives
on pushing her mind and body,
against squads such as the Sun Dev
ils, the team aspect of cross country is
equally motivating.
"I love seeing people who love
running," Lambie said. "And to be
on a team at Stanford where every
one wants to do their best, and
everyone wants the team to do its
best, is extremely motivating."
