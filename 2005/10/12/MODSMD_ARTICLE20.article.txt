It's not uncommon to find national and regional
champions on Stanford's athletic teams, but it is rare
when those champions realize their potential as
early as their freshman year. Redshirt sophomore
Arianna Lambie did just that as a freshman two
years ago when she finished third for the Pacific-10
Conference cross country title and then 24th at the
2003 NCAA Championships.
In her rookie year of outdoor track and field,
Lambie was the top-ranked 1,500-meter cross coun
try freshman in the country and finished eighth in
her heat at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.
Lambie,ever composed and focused, handled her
immediate success with maturity.
"It just got me excited," Lambie said."To realize
I could enter the college competition world right up
there made me set my sights high. But I also knew 1
had more potential than that."
The Harvard Mass., native went on to finish third in
the 1,500 meters at the NCAA Outdoor Track and
Field Championship last year and began this year's
cross country season with a win at the Stanford Invi
tational — setting the bar high for this season.
"I do feel pressure this year," Lambie said.
"There are expectations to not let anyone down. I
really want to just be that consistent runner that
people believe me to be."
Like many cross country runners, Lambie started
as a soccer player. In seventh grade she went out for
track and field, and the rest is history. But her expo
sure to running took place even earlier in her life.
"My dad has always been a recreational runner,
and he took me to a track meet when I was in fifth
grade just for fun," Lambie said. "I ran a road race
once when I was in second grade as well."
It was not until 11th grade that the All-American
took up cross country. By the time she graduated,
Lambie had won eight Massachusetts state champi
onships in cross country and indoor and outdoor
track and held the third fastest time in U.S. history
— 4:37.23 — by a high school miler.
"I prefer track and field," Lambie said. "But I'm
coming to love cross country more. I just love the
fast feeling of the 1,500, but I also know how helpful
cross country can be to that race."
As with many cross country runners, the sacri
fices she had to make in order to become a serious
runner have been challenging.
"Giving up soccer was a huge challenge," Lambie
said. "The other big challenge is injuries. Trying to
stay healthy, thinking you're doing everything right

After growing up a soccer and track and field athlete, redshirt sophomore Arianna Lambie has found a new passion in
