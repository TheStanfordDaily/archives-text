# Sophomore posts second-place finish to pace Cardinal
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES 
In a repeat of last year, the men's
golf team was unable to triumph on
the Golden Bear's home turf at the
Alister MacKenzie Invitational.
Sophomore Rob Grube, however,
represented well by placing second in
dividually in the field on the par-71
course.
The Cardinal overall placed sixth
out of 16 teams with a combined score
of 853 (280-278-295). California
placed first with a 844 (276-281-287),
followed by Fresno State (847) and
Purdue (848). Last year, Stanford
placed 10th with a score of 884, but
this year's finish was still a disappoint
ment for the team nonetheless.
"We struggled today on the green
and with our third score," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "We had a couple
guys that struggled, and that made the
difference. But we were right there in
contention."
Ray added that it's always tough to
lose to Cal or any other local team.
"I feel like on a good day we can
definitely compete with those schools
and perform well against them," he
said. "So we definitely have some
work to do as we get back to campus
this week."
Looking to improve as well is
Grube. who placed second individual
ly, just one stroke behind Fresno
State's John Resa, with a score of 206
(66-67-73). Grube tied for 27th last
year, but still believes he can do bet
ter.
"It is obviously a marked improve
ment from last year," he said. "It is re
warding to see the improvement in
my game over the past year in light of
the team's hard work. I struggled the
last day with my putter — if I had
putted decently I would have picked
up the few extra strokes needed to
notch a victory."
Another strong individual per
former was freshman Dodge Kem
mer. After being tied for 42nd after
two rounds, he shot one over par in
the third round to move up into a tie
for 32nd with a three-over-par total of
216.
Representing the team's corps of
juniors. Matt Savage placed in the

top-20 with an even 213, Matt Shin
tied for 46th (220) and Zack Miller
tied for 60th (223).
The Cardinal's sixth-place finish
overall was also frustrating given the
squad's triumph over its local rivals in
last season's Pacific-10 Conference
Championship. But Ray focused in
stead on the challenge posed by The
Meadow Club — the course on which
this year's Alister MacKenzie Invita
tional was held.
"We were trying to play the course
today, and that's really what beat us,"
Ray said. "1 think we wasted a few
shots on the greens and ultimately
could've done a better job with our
short game."
The Meadow Club, located in Fair
fax, Calif., is known as a difficult
course. According to Ray, its large, un
dulating and fast greens were able to
slip up the players. The third round of
play was especially challenging and
was a partial cause for the Cardinal's
drop in the tournament rankings.
"We need to figure out how to play
three solid rounds instead of two
great rounds and a poor one," Grube
said. "The course became more diffi
cult as the tournament progressed.
The last day, especially, the pins were
located in inaccessible spots, which
made it very difficult to make
birdies."
Ray agreed that the third round
was one of the team's weaknesses.
"I think one thing that was notice
able was that the course setup was
more difficult today," he said, speak
ing in reference to the final day's pin
placements. "There were some
tougher hole locations, so we had dif
ficulty getting enough opportuni
ties."
But the Cardinal's competition, in
cluding Cal, overcame these obstacles
in all three rounds and picked up crit
ical strokes in the process.
"I think we are as good if not bet
ter than all of the local teams, espe
cially Cal," Grube said. "Our problem
is that we have not figured out how to
channel our talent into wins, which, in
the end. is all that matters. I expect to
see a hotly contested region, similar to

ment winner John Resa of Fresno State. Grube fired a three-round score of 206.
