# A 						week of sports made for the ages

### 
What an awesome week for sports.
During the past seven days, even the
most sport-specific fans have gotten
their fill, while the more generalized connois
seur of great athletic performance has had
more great storylines to watch unfold than
time could possibly allow.
The NHL season kicked off a week ago
today, starting the league on the long road
back to national prominence since the work
stoppage cancelled last season.
But hardly anything could top the drama of
America's pastime that has played out on the
baseball diamond. First it was the sight of the
defending world champion Red Sox being
knocked off by the "other" Sox in a cold, clean
sweep. Then there was the Houston Astros'
18-inning, six-hour long, series-clinching win
over the Atlanta Braves — a landmark con
test, the game reached an unreal level of ab
surdity when 43-year old Roger Clemens
worked the last three innings on just two days
of rest to earn the win. These amazing stories
injected a few shots of added excitement and
energy into the October ball-and-stick experi
ence of 2005.
And of course, who could forget the five
game series victory that my "hometown's" Los
Angeles Angels of Anaheim posted over base
ball's $203 million dollar-payroll empire —
the New York Yankees? Perhaps most impres
sive was the fact that the Angels accomplished
their feat despite losing ace and legitimate Cy
Young contender Bartolo Colon early on in
the penultimate fifth game of the series. But it
was rookie hurler Ervin Santana who came on
to provide five solid innings of relief in the
pressure-packed situation.
But why stop there? In golfing news. Tiger
Woods emerged from the weekend with yet
another victory that pushed his 2005 tourna
ment winnings total to over nine million dol
lars. Meanwhile, nearly-16 year old Michelle
Wie upstaged that amount by turning pro on
the golf circuit late last week. Though only in
her junior year of high school, Wie signed en
dorsements that are said to exceed the $10 mil
lion mark.
I know a whole lot more happened in the
world of sports this past week, including the
third-straight, seemingly incomprehensible
come-from-behind blowout by the USC foot
ball squad. But speaking of Saturday football,
what made this an "awesome" week was the
win our own Cardinal pulled off while No. 18
Golden Bears fell in defeat. Yes, we won and
they lost. Though Stanford hasn't yet played
Cal head-to-head, I can't help but take joy in
this "feat".
Still, my thought lingers: How many more
good weeks will be turned into awesome
weeks by great weekend results? Without tak
ing too much thunder from the football cover
age that you will surely encounter by reading
Friday and Monday editions of the Daily
(though I still encourage you to read them all),
let's take a look at the remaining weeks of the
football season.
This Saturday, Stanford visits Arizona to
take on the Wildcats inTUscon. While I have to
admit that Stanford isn't a tremendous team
(yet), I will predict that Arizona, still winless in
the Pac-10 and owner of an anemic offense, is
beatable. That same day, though, Cal will be
taking on a pass-happy, no-defense Oregon
State, who I expect the Bears will handle easi
ly. Thus, a smile and a good feeling this week
end, but no bouncing-off-the-wall celebration.
The next three weeks may get ugly, but who
knows? My faith in our Cardinal may prove
well-placed, if they can get going offensively
against Arizona State, UCLA and USC in the
next three weeks The Sun Devils are a team
that is much better than its record suggests,
and the contest against the defending national
champs will be played in a packed coliseum in
Los Angeles. During these three weeks, Cal
has a bye between Washington State and Ore
gon. I would predict (with an evil grin) that the
Bears will come away with a win and a loss —
the loss will come in front of a hostile crowd in
Eugene, Ore. at the hands of the Ducks, who
even rattled the powerfulTVojans.
Finally, in the week before Big Game, we go
on the road to take on Oregon State — whom
I believe can be beaten given the right condi
tions. Meanwhile,l expect Cal to get pum
meled when the Trojans come to visit. With
one and possibly even two losses entering Big
Game for Cal, who knows what can happen in
the rivalry game for the axe? Surely a win in
Walt Harris' first Big Game would make both
the weekend, and season, more than just "awe
some".
Following Big Game, Cal's regular season
will be complete. But we will be taking on a
powerful Notre Dame squad with the oppor
tunity. in all optimistic likelihood, to pull out a
bowl bid on the line. If even half of my win/loss
predictions prove correct, it would be entirely
fine with me.

Anything Goes
I had a conversation with a friend
this summer about how she could ob
serve the world of athletic competi
tion and appreciate the talent in
volved without being intrigued and
drawn into the exciting atmosphere
that exists for even the most casual of
fans. I explained to her that sports
offer parallels to life in so many ways
— only shortened into 40-, 48-, 60-
minute competitions over the course
of larger scale seasons. In these peri
ods, it is the drama and positive story
lines that occur that make sports an
appealing pastime.
In the past seven days, the sports
world justified my position. There
were a plethora of storylines, but the
best was the Cardinal win and the
Bears' loss. Let's see if we can keep it
up.
