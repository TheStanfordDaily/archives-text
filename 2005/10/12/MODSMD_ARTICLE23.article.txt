Though the season won't officially be underway until January, the Stanford men's volleyball team plans to visit the country's northern neighbor
this weekend for an early warm-up. Stanford plays in Calgary's Dino Cup this Friday, Saturday and Sunday despite just having started practice two
weeks ago. Because Canada's volleyball season is already in progress, the Cardinal and other U.S. collegiate teams have the opportunity to test their
skills early in the season. An exhibition game against California is scheduled in November, and the squad is on a break until the traditional schedule
starts up next vear.
