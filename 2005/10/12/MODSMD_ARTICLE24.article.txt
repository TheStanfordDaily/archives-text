# New nanotechnology lab opens

### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
University researchers unveiled
the newly renovated Stanford
Nanocharacterization Laboratory
(SNL) on Oct. 5, located in the
Geballe Laboratory for Advanced
Features. A ceremony was held to
dedicate the laboratory after a $2
million reconstruction.
The money required to renovate
the SNL came from the Taiwan
Semiconductor Company, its Chief
Executive Officer Morris Chang and
from gifts to the University from
Craig and Barbara Barrett.
According to Robert Sinclair, di
rector of the new SNL and chair of
the Materials Science and Engineer
ing Department, Stanford faculty will
use the lab to investigate and deter
mine structures on the nano scale,
often as small as billionths of a meter.
"To develop new materials for
nano-technology, it is increasingly

important to determine the structure
of what has been made as this influ
ences the properties and perform
ance," Sinclair said. "This informa
tion is fed back to the processing, in
order to perfect synthesis steps."
The SNL will work together with
the larger Stanford Nanofabrication
Laboratory, also located in Geballe,
said Arthur Bienenstock, dean of re
search and graduate policy.
"The two laboratories are com
plementary," he said. "In the
Nan#fabrication Laboratory, devices
with nanoscale features are fabricat
ed. In the Stanford Nanocharacteri
zation Laboratory, these devices and
other nano-sized objects are charac
terized to determine their sizes and
shapes, as well as their chemical and
atomic compositions."
Bienenstock added that the SNL
is exciting to the nanotechnology
community not only for its new high
quality nanocharacterization equip
ment but also for the rich working at-

mosphere it should provide for re
searchers. While the lab will contain
scientific wonders like a dual-beam
focused ion beam instrument, a scan
ning electron microscope and an X
ray diffraction system, Bienenstock
noted that the most important bene
fit of the new lab may be the ability of
its layout to foster interaction among
researchers.
"[The SNL's layout] encourages dis
cussions between faculty and students
from different groups," Bienenstock
said. "These discussions often lead to
new collaborations in my experience."
So, what types of projects will be
characterized in the new SNL?
According to Sinclair, research in
Stanford's nano-labs will analyze the
tiniest parts of a number of sciences.
"Typical projects include carbon
nanotubes, silicon and germanium
nanowires for nano-electronics, mag
netic metallic nanoparticles for cancer
detection, fuel cell materials for future
energy conversion, etc." he said.
