# Indian law class offered in spring
## 
### ANDREW BURMON 
Last March, Colin Sampson, now
a third-year law student, walked into
the office of Marcus Cole, the Law
School's dean of curriculum, to push
the administration to create an Indi
an law course for this academic year.
Sampson, a member of North Caroli
na's Lumbee tribe and then-presi
dent of the Native American Law
Students Association (NALSA), of
fered NALS As services in the search
fora professor.
"I passed up law degrees from
other schools on the stipulation that
Stanford would be teaching Indian
law classes, so I was intent to make it
happen," Sampson said.
Come July, Sampson received the
course catalogue for the new aca
demic year, but no Indian law course
could be found. He immediately
called the dean and discovered, to his
relief and joy, that the Law School
was in the process of looking fora
professor to teach the course.
The Law School has recently an
nounced that a course entitled Fed
eral Indian Law will be offered be
ginning next semester. It will be

taught by adjunct professor Judge
Joe Flies-Away.
Colin Sampson will be in the class,
and a casual poll of law students
showed that at least 25 other stu
dents had an interest in studying In
dian law, according to Sampson. The
class will include subjects such as
tribal sovereignty, tribal property
rights and jurisdiction in Indian
Country.
For his part, Tim Sanders, the cur
rent NALSA president, hopes that
the class will encourage law students
interested in Native American issues
to consider Stanford. NALSA is cur
rently formulating a strategy in order
to "reach out to Native undergrads to
encourage them to apply to law
school."
NALSA itself has expanded
greatly,tripling in size in the last year.
As more students become active in
the Indian law field, the question of
whether or not the University is
doing enough to tackle this topic has
come to the forefront.
NALSA member Jenny Montoya
Tansey, a second-year law student,
said she believes that the University
has far to go.

"Given the high level of student
interest, Stanford Law School should
have a tenured, full-time faculty line
devoted," Tansey said. She also
pointed out that students interested
in Indian law cannot obtain any guid
ance for their research.
Nonetheless, the presence of an
Indian Law class in the school cur
riculum has been labeled a good
start.
"This class sends a signal to the
greater student community that the
issues that affect Native Americans
are interesting and timely," Sampson
said.
While it remains to be seen
whether or not the Law School will
eventually decide to hire a perma
nent Indian law professor, or
whether the Indian law class will be
open to undergraduates, NALSA
has already begun working to make
sure that another course will be
taught on Indian law next year.
Members of NALSA and other
members of the Native American
community on Stanford's campus will
be in White Plaza today presenting in
formation about their cultures in cele
bration of Indigenous People's Day.
