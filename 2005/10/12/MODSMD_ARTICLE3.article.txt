### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford University Board of
Trustees held its first of five sessions
for the year on Monday and Tuesday
of this week. Five new trustees were
present at the meeting, four of which
came through the Alumni Trustee se
lection process while the fifth was
Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo.
In a press conference following
the session on Monday, Burton J. Mc-
Murtry, chairman of the Board, sum
marized the key points discussed by
the Board.
"A major focal point of the meet
ing was President John Hennessy's
summary of his first five years as pres
ident," McMurtry said. 'This report
presented the things that went right
and the things that went wrong during
this time and focused on changes in
the student body, such as statistics on
the ethnic and gender mix."
The Board also focused on a num
ber of campus construction projects.
McMurtry explained that there are
four steps to approval of any land de
velopment project â€” concept and
site approval, detailed concept ap
proval, project approval and con
struction approval.
The Board granted concept and
site approval fora new Learning and
Knowledge Center for the Medical
School. The center will be situated
relatively close to the Clark Center
and will require the demolition of
Fairchild Auditorium.
"The center will have three floors
and a penthouse and will be used as a
teaching space," McMurtry said. "It
will be configured in a flexible way and
will allow us to conduct medical teach
ing in a way we couldn't do before."
The Land and Building Committee
and the Medical Center Committee
also focused on more long-term trans
formations in the Medical Center.
"The main part of Stanford's hospi
tal opened in 1959, so a lot of facilities
have to be renovated and new facilities
have to be built," McMurtry said.
"There are a lot of constraints in the
Medical Center and these two commit
tees focused on how and where to do
the expansions. We will get a detailed
report at our December meetings."
The renovation and expansion of
Stanford Stadium as well as the con
struction of the Munger Residences
both received project approval from
the Board. The Board granted con
struction approval to the Stanford in

Washington renovation project and
the Barnum Family Center, an ex
tension of the School of Education
that will be located in the empty
building near the clock tower.
Another key focus of the Board
meeting, according to McMurtry,
was a report from the co-chairs of
the commission on graduate educa
tion, Graduate School of Business
Prof. Emeritus Charles Holloway
and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Mark Horowitz.
"President Hennessy decided
that if you look at our graduate edu
cation, by in large, we are doing
things the same way we have been
doing them for the last 50 years or
more," McMurtry said.
The Ph.D. program is currently de
signed to generate the next generation of
academics, McMurtry explained. How
ever, fewer than half of Stanford's Ph.D.
students actually go into academia.
"If the world has changed this
much, we should change our outlook
on graduate education," he said.
Holloway and Horowitz present
ed the Board with a preliminary re
port, which included a list of things
Stanford could do to broaden the ed
ucation of its graduate students. The
full report will be completed within
the next two months.
"This is very similar to the under

graduate education initiative which
was started several years ago and led
to a number of positive changes, in
cluding giving freshmen and sopho
mores more access to seminar class
es and higher-level faculty," Mc-
Murtry said. "Like that initiative, the
changes to Stanford's graduate edu
cation will take a long time and will
require a lot of experimentation and
faculty leadership."
The Board also discussed the
Stanford Management Company's
performance in generating a 19.5
percent return on the Stanford
Merged Endowment Pool (MEP).
"The Stanford Management Com
pany's performance was really good,
second only to that of Yale," Mc-
Murtry said. "Each year we take about
5 percent of the endowment and that
covers about 20 percent of our budget.
This means that we are still highly de
pendent on federal funds and this cre
ates a high sense of urgency about try
ing to build the endowment."
Finally, increasing the Universi
ty's earthquake preparedness was
another one of the Board's goals.
"President Hennessy is very fo
cused on risk assessment at Stan
ford," McMurtry said. "Now, we are
in good shape to accommodate dam
age that would occur from an earth
quake of magnitude seven."
