# Roosevelt Institution welcomes new recruits
## Senator Hillary Clinton’s video address opens reception 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Hoping to inspire a new crop of stu
dents to engage in policy discourse, mem
bers of the Roosevelt Institution hosted a
"welcome back" reception in Tresidder
Union last night to laud the Institution's
recent accomplishments and outline its
sweeping agenda for the organization's
role at Stanford and beyond.

The event, led by ceremony host and
Stanford chapter President Amol
Helekar, a junior, began with a twist — a
surprise video appearance by Senator
Hillary Clinton — which energized the
audience of over 100 students that
packed Oak East lounge. In her video
taped speech, Clinton spoke warmly
about the Roosevelt Institution and
praised students for their active involve
ment in the policy process.

"Organizations like the Roosevelt Insti
tution make me more optimistic," Clinton
said. "Now is a time to think big, and that's
what I think organizations like the Roo
sevelt Institution allow students to do."
Extending Clinton's optimistic tone,
Helekar contrasted Roosevelt founders'
initial anxieties with the organization's
present confidence and clout.
