# Roosevelt Institution welcomes new recruits
## Senator Hillary Clinton’s video address opens reception 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Hoping to inspire a new crop of stu
dents to engage in policy discourse, mem
bers of the Roosevelt Institution hosted a
"welcome back" reception in Tresidder
Union last night to laud the Institution's
recent accomplishments and outline its
sweeping agenda for the organization's
role at Stanford and beyond.

The event, led by ceremony host and
Stanford chapter President Amol
Helekar, a junior, began with a twist — a
surprise video appearance by Senator
Hillary Clinton — which energized the
audience of over 100 students that
packed Oak East lounge. In her video
taped speech, Clinton spoke warmly
about the Roosevelt Institution and
praised students for their active involve
ment in the policy process.

"Organizations like the Roosevelt Insti
tution make me more optimistic," Clinton
said. "Now is a time to think big, and that's
what I think organizations like the Roo
sevelt Institution allow students to do."
Extending Clinton's optimistic tone,
Helekar contrasted Roosevelt founders'
initial anxieties with the organization's
present confidence and clout.

Students check in to the Roosevelt Institution Reception, held in Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge last night.
"While everyone thought it was a
promising notion to organize a poli
cy think tank made up entirely of
college students, the logistics of
bringing together thousands of
bright young minds seemed daunt
ing," Helekar said. "Eight months
later, we can already call it an un
equivocal success."
Within those eight months, the
Roosevelt think tank concept spread
to 160 colleges and universities na
tionwide and even across the At
lantic, Helekar said. He noted the ac
complishments of Roosevelt fellow
and alumna Jenny Tolan, whose the
sis on AIDS policy is currently being
read by nearly every Congressional
office in Washington, D.C.
Stanford students excited by the
think tank concept are also devising a
new Special Center on Emergency
Planning and Relief (SCEPR), which
Helekar said will work with profes
sors, policymakers and community
leaders to suggest improved ways of
handling national emergencies.
The rapid expansion of the Roo
sevelt Institution was due in part to
the efforts of its founders junior
Quinn Wilhelmi and political science
graduate student Kai Stinchcombe, a
graduate student in political science,
who now act as advisers to the Stan
ford chapter. They first devised the
Roosevelt model after realizing that
University students were already
writing papers that resembled policy
briefs produced by professional
think tanks. Rather than "waste intel
lectual capital," Stinchcombe be
lieved that a student-led think tank
that facilitated working relationships

between students and academics that
produce policy ideas would better
engage students in policy discourse.
"A research university is effec
tively a think tank, just an ineffective
one without the mechanism of an or
ganization like the Roosevelt Institu
tion," Stinchcombe said. "We already
talk about issues, we do research, and
we write papers. We tell the politi
cians that we're already doing this
stuff, so why not give us a chance?"
Leaders of the Institution pointed
out recent developments that prove
Roosevelt's policymaking potential.
Most notably, Helekar touted the re
cent publication of the Roosevelt
Review, the organization's first poli
cy journal, which compiles the insti
tution's best policy papers and pub
lishes them for policymakers to read
and evaluate.
Senior Ben Grant, Stanford chap
ter director for the Center on Envi
ronment and Energy, said that he is
proud of his involvement with the
Roosevelt Institution and how far
his center has progressed since its

start. He noted that several of his
center's fellows have had their Roo
sevelt work published in The New
York Times, The Roosevelt Review
and The Stanford Daily. The center
was also able to sponsor two town
hall meetings last spring with envi
ronmental activists Adam Werbach
and Michael Shellenberger.
"I hope that we can simply accom
plish more of what we accomplished
last year, which means having our
work published and getting involved
in the community," Grant said.
After attending the event, fresh
man Ling Shao said that he felt moti
vated to join the Roosevelt Institution.
"I was really impressed by how
many people actually came in for the
reception," Shao said. "They seem to
be doing a lot of important stuff, and
I'd love to contribute my ideas."
Freshman Aman Kumar called
the event a "test bed of creativity and
ideas," adding that he found the clip
featuring Sen. Clinton especially en
couraging.
"It shows that important people
and policymakers actually do care
about what this program does, and it
makes me want to take part in it more
because I know it's going somewhere,"
he said. "This is an incredibly empow
ering concept because it's a platform
for large scale social change."

tion," Stinchcombe said. "We already
talk about issues, we do research, and
we write papers. We tell the politi
cians that we're already doing this
stuff, so why not give us a chance?"
Leaders of the Institution pointed
out recent developments that prove
Roosevelt's policymaking potential.
Most notably, Helekar touted the re
cent publication of the Roosevelt
Review, the organization's first poli
cy journal, which compiles the insti
tution's best policy papers and pub
lishes them for policymakers to read
and evaluate.
Senior Ben Grant, Stanford chap
ter director for the Center on Envi
ronment and Energy, said that he is
proud of his involvement with the
Roosevelt Institution and how far
his center has progressed since its

start. He noted that several of his
center's fellows have had their Roo
sevelt work published in The New
York Times, The Roosevelt Review
and The Stanford Daily. The center
was also able to sponsor two town
hall meetings last spring with envi
ronmental activists Adam Werbach
and Michael Shellenberger.
"I hope that we can simply accom
plish more of what we accomplished
last year, which means having our
work published and getting involved
in the community," Grant said.
After attending the event, fresh
man Ling Shao said that he felt moti
vated to join the Roosevelt Institution.
"I was really impressed by how
many people actually came in for the
reception," Shao said. "They seem to
be doing a lot of important stuff, and
I'd love to contribute my ideas."
Freshman Aman Kumar called
the event a "test bed of creativity and
ideas," adding that he found the clip
featuring Sen. Clinton especially en
couraging.
"It shows that important people
and policymakers actually do care
about what this program does, and it
makes me want to take part in it more
because I know it's going somewhere,"
he said. "This is an incredibly empow
ering concept because it's a platform
for large scale social change."
Hoping to inspire a new crop of stu
dents to engage in policy discourse, mem
bers of the Roosevelt Institution hosted a
"welcome back" reception in Tresidder
Union last night to laud the Institution's
recent accomplishments and outline its
sweeping agenda for the organization's
role at Stanford and beyond.

The event, led by ceremony host and
Stanford chapter President Amol
Helekar, a junior, began with a twist — a
surprise video appearance by Senator
Hillary Clinton — which energized the
audience of over 100 students that
packed Oak East lounge. In her video
taped speech, Clinton spoke warmly
about the Roosevelt Institution and
praised students for their active involve
ment in the policy process.

"Organizations like the Roosevelt Insti
tution make me more optimistic," Clinton
said. "Now is a time to think big, and that's
what I think organizations like the Roo
sevelt Institution allow students to do."
Extending Clinton's optimistic tone,
Helekar contrasted Roosevelt founders'
initial anxieties with the organization's
present confidence and clout.

"While everyone thought it was a
promising notion to organize a poli
cy think tank made up entirely of
college students, the logistics of
bringing together thousands of
bright young minds seemed daunt
ing," Helekar said. "Eight months
later, we can already call it an un
equivocal success."
Within those eight months, the
Roosevelt think tank concept spread
to 160 colleges and universities na
tionwide and even across the At
lantic, Helekar said. He noted the ac
complishments of Roosevelt fellow
and alumna Jenny Tolan, whose the
sis on AIDS policy is currently being
read by nearly every Congressional
office in Washington, D.C.
Stanford students excited by the
think tank concept are also devising a
new Special Center on Emergency
Planning and Relief (SCEPR), which
Helekar said will work with profes
sors, policymakers and community
leaders to suggest improved ways of
handling national emergencies.
The rapid expansion of the Roo
sevelt Institution was due in part to
the efforts of its founders junior
Quinn Wilhelmi and political science
graduate student Kai Stinchcombe, a
graduate student in political science,
who now act as advisers to the Stan
ford chapter. They first devised the
Roosevelt model after realizing that
University students were already
writing papers that resembled policy
briefs produced by professional
think tanks. Rather than "waste intel
lectual capital," Stinchcombe be
lieved that a student-led think tank
that facilitated working relationships

between students and academics that
produce policy ideas would better
engage students in policy discourse.
"A research university is effec
tively a think tank, just an ineffective
one without the mechanism of an or
ganization like the Roosevelt Institu
tion," Stinchcombe said. "We already
talk about issues, we do research, and
we write papers. We tell the politi
cians that we're already doing this
