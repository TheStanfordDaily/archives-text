# DEVELOPMENTS
## New film studies program launched 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Whether they are chic artists experimenting in a
small, modish studio or Oscar-winning Hollywood
directors managing their millionaire stars, filmmak
ers today are carrying on a tradition born out of the
dust and hay of the Stanford Barn. Ever since Leland
Stanford Sr. made a bet about the kinetics of a horse's
stride and conceived a way to capture a stallion's
movement frame-by-frame, the moving picture has
inundated, inspired and influenced modern culture.
"For the last 40 years I've had students in and out
of my office asking why they can't major in film,"
said Communication Prof. "Emeritus Henry Bre
itrose. "1 think that they are fascinated by films be
cause they are so frequently stimulated to think by
all matter of movies."
No longer does he have to turn them away.Today,
he can send students interested in film studies to its
new home in the Art and Art History Department.
As the newborn program sees out its inaugural
weeks, more than 10 students have already signed up
for the major. Kristine Samuelson,an award-winning
filmmaker and director of the Film and Media Stud
ies Program, expects to eventually graduate 15 to 20
students from the program per year.
"But we're not putting a cap on it," she said.
Although students majoring in film and media
studies must take an introductory film production
course as part of the core curriculum, the curriculum
will emphasize academic — not production — skills.
"We felt that we should work with Stanford
strengths as a liberal arts school," Samuelson said.
"We felt that we shouldn't focus on the craft skills, but

the conceptual skills needed to un
derstand and pursue moving media."
Upon completion of a nine
course core that combines the histo
ry of cinema with theory, techniques,
ethics and compositional skills, stu
dents will pursue a concentration to
personalize the major. The avant
garde story teller may concentrate
on composition, while the journalist
may focus on how film affects media,
and those with a more techie bent
may spotlight the technological is
sues encasing film production.
Regardless of the concentration,
Samuelson insists that students will
walk away with a better sense of the
world around them.
"Any time you are studying liber
al arts — be it film, art, classics or po
litical science — you are trying to
understand how the world works,"
she said. "In this way, the study of

film is so influential because it is the
study of people. It has this enormous
tentacle into everyday lives and the
cultures and sub-cultures that we
live in."
To further connect film to the real
world, Samuelson and her col
leagues hope to offer an internship
program for students majoring in the
field.
On top of the 65-unit minimum
course load, students will be encour
aged to pursue internships with a va
riety of film-based organizations in
cluding Los Angeles and New York
studios, Sundance summer film festi
vals and archiving projects. There is
also the option to write a film studies
honors thesis.
"We've tried to set up a creative,
challenging, rigorous discipline of
study that is academic at its core,"
said Art History Prof. Scott Bukat
man, who earned a doctorate in cin
ema studies at New York University
and has taught film courses at Stan
ford since 1997, in a May interview
with the Stanford Report. "It re
wards textual analysis; it rewards the

study of the artist; it rewards the
study of film as a cultural document;
and it rewards the study of film as a
contested cultural document, creat
ed by multiple voices with different
agendas and seen by different audi
ences with different agendas."
When film studies first made its
way from the race track to the quad
in 1927, it was located in the Psychol
ogy Department. Since then, film
classes have been scattered across
the English, communication and art
and art history majors.
Housing the program in the De
partment of Art and Art History is
ideal, according to Samuelson. Not
only does a home at Cummings give
students the ability to network
throughout the department and with
graduate students, but it also allows
students to consider the medium it
self.
ITiis quarter, there are five classes
asking students to consider the field:
an impressive spread fora burgeon
ing department.
But then again, as Samuelson
said, "Everyone loves the movies."

will emphasize academic — not production — skills.
"We felt that we should work with Stanford
strengths as a liberal arts school," Samuelson said.
"We felt that we shouldn't focus on the craft skills, but

the conceptual skills needed to un
derstand and pursue moving media."
Upon completion of a nine
course core that combines the histo
ry of cinema with theory, techniques,
ethics and compositional skills, stu
dents will pursue a concentration to
personalize the major. The avant
garde story teller may concentrate
on composition, while the journalist
may focus on how film affects media,
and those with a more techie bent
may spotlight the technological is
sues encasing film production.
Regardless of the concentration,
Samuelson insists that students will
walk away with a better sense of the
world around them.
"Any time you are studying liber
al arts — be it film, art, classics or po
litical science — you are trying to
understand how the world works,"
she said. "In this way, the study of

film is so influential because it is the
study of people. It has this enormous
tentacle into everyday lives and the
cultures and sub-cultures that we
live in."
To further connect film to the real
world, Samuelson and her col
leagues hope to offer an internship
program for students majoring in the
field.
On top of the 65-unit minimum
course load, students will be encour
aged to pursue internships with a va
riety of film-based organizations in
cluding Los Angeles and New York
studios, Sundance summer film festi
vals and archiving projects. There is
also the option to write a film studies
honors thesis.
"We've tried to set up a creative,
challenging, rigorous discipline of
study that is academic at its core,"
said Art History Prof. Scott Bukat
man, who earned a doctorate in cin
ema studies at New York University
and has taught film courses at Stan
ford since 1997, in a May interview
with the Stanford Report. "It re
wards textual analysis; it rewards the

study of the artist; it rewards the
study of film as a cultural document;
and it rewards the study of film as a
contested cultural document, creat
ed by multiple voices with different
agendas and seen by different audi
ences with different agendas."
When film studies first made its
way from the race track to the quad
in 1927, it was located in the Psychol
ogy Department. Since then, film
classes have been scattered across
the English, communication and art
and art history majors.
Housing the program in the De
partment of Art and Art History is
ideal, according to Samuelson. Not
only does a home at Cummings give
students the ability to network
throughout the department and with
graduate students, but it also allows
students to consider the medium it
self.
ITiis quarter, there are five classes
asking students to consider the field:
an impressive spread fora burgeon
ing department.
But then again, as Samuelson
said, "Everyone loves the movies."
Whether they are chic artists experimenting in a
small, modish studio or Oscar-winning Hollywood
directors managing their millionaire stars, filmmak
ers today are carrying on a tradition born out of the
dust and hay of the Stanford Barn. Ever since Leland
Stanford Sr. made a bet about the kinetics of a horse's
stride and conceived a way to capture a stallion's
movement frame-by-frame, the moving picture has
inundated, inspired and influenced modern culture.
"For the last 40 years I've had students in and out
of my office asking why they can't major in film,"
said Communication Prof. "Emeritus Henry Bre
itrose. "1 think that they are fascinated by films be
cause they are so frequently stimulated to think by
all matter of movies."
No longer does he have to turn them away.Today,
he can send students interested in film studies to its
new home in the Art and Art History Department.
As the newborn program sees out its inaugural
weeks, more than 10 students have already signed up
for the major. Kristine Samuelson,an award-winning
filmmaker and director of the Film and Media Stud
ies Program, expects to eventually graduate 15 to 20
students from the program per year.
"But we're not putting a cap on it," she said.
Although students majoring in film and media
studies must take an introductory film production
course as part of the core curriculum, the curriculum
will emphasize academic — not production — skills.
"We felt that we should work with Stanford
strengths as a liberal arts school," Samuelson said.
"We felt that we shouldn't focus on the craft skills, but

the conceptual skills needed to un
derstand and pursue moving media."
