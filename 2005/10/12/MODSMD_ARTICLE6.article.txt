# ASSU Senate debates dorm door-to-door flyering policy
## Group urges ASSU to provide relief to Pakistan 
### ANURADHA SIVARAM 
The "business-casual" atmosphere
of last night's ASSU Senate meeting
became increasingly businesslike as
Senators discussed and debated issues
concerning dorm flyering policies and
student group funding.
Senior Senator Andrew Hendel
and sophomore Senator Hershey
Avula, representatives to the Council
of Resident Fellows, broached the
controversial issue of flyering on cam

pus and expressed concern on behalf
of University Resident Fellows that
off-campus businesses and other or
ganizations are flooding the campus
with advertisements and promotional
material.
Members of the Senate were hesi
tant to discuss a stricter policy against
flyering as the debate became more
heated. Some pointed out that adopt
ing such a policy would penalize legit
imate campus organizations instead of
solely targeting off-campus vendors.
"Most bad flyering comes from
businesses who are not covered under
University policy" said Chief Execu
tive Officer of Stanford Student En
terprises, graduate student Justin Fish

ner-Wolfson.
According to Avula, the issue arose
because of room-to-room distribution
of periodicals by The Stanford Re
view.
Current flyering policies are deter
mined on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Orig
inally,campus policies required dorms
to "opt-in" for in-dorm flyering. mean
ing that dorms would receive fliers
only if it was decided by a dorm vote.
However, during elections last year, a
referendum changing the dorm "opt
in" flyering policy to a default "opt
out" policy passed by a slim margin.
Avula explained that the Senate
chose not to enforce the "opt-out" pol
icy because the vote was so close. The

issue arose again, he said, due to the
concerns of RFs The Senate proceed
ed to debate University flyering poli
cies. but did not come to any conclu
sions about amending or enforcing
current rules; instead, the student gov
erning body agreed to postpone fur
ther discussion fora later date.
Following the flyering debate, jun
ior Uzair Nasim spoke about efforts to
aid victims of the Pakistan earth
quake, asking the ASSU for help with
organization and publicity.

site as of tomorrow or the day after be

He further explained that the
group Pakistanis at Stanford plans
to work as a coalition with other or
ganizations.
"We're working together for
this,"he said. "We don't want to di
vide along national lines at all."
Nasim also mentioned plans to ad
vertise in dorms and in White Plaza.
The Senate pledged its support
for earthquake aid but could not
vote to appropriate funds.
ASSU Vice President Aneto Ok
wonkwo, a senior, also reported
budget changes that will allocate
more money to Club Sports. He em
phasized that funding for intramu
rals is now much greater than it has
been in previous years.
Lastly, the Senate moved to its
action items and approved a funding
bill for the Queer Straight Alliance
for $3,160 and one for Pakistanis at
Stanford totaling $505.86.
In addition, the Senate approved
a budget modification bill submitted
by the Black Student Union and
also approved reserve transfer bills
for the Stanford Scientific Review
for $5,455.32, the Black Student
Union for $630 and for the Stanford
Undergraduate Research Journal
for $7065.30.
