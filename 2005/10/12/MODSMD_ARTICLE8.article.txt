MUZAFFARABAD. Pakistan —
Earthquake victims scuffled over badly
needed food that arrived yesterday in the
first aid convoys to reach this devastated
city. An army official said the government
estimated that more than 35,000 people
died, a stark assessment that almost dou
bled the official death toll.
That toll remained at around 20,000
people, but a senior army official close to
the rescue operations said government
officials were estimating that between
35,000 and 40,000 died.The official asked
not to be identified because he wasn't au
thorized to disclose the estimate to jour
nalists.
In the northern town of Balakot, a
French team on Monday rescued at least
five children buried in a collapsed school,
Eric Supara, an official at the French em
bassy in Islamabad, said TUesday.
U.S. military helicopters, diverted from
neighboring Afghanistan, helped ferry
wounded people from the wrecked city of
Muzaffarabad, while international rescue
teams joined searches during the waning
days of hope for finding survivors.
About 10 trucks brought by Pakistani
charities and volunteers rumbled into that
city, where efforts by relief workers to dis
tribute aid turned chaotic as residents
scrambled for handouts of cooking oil,
sugar, rice, blankets and tents.
It was the first major influx of aid since
the monster 7.6-magnitude quake struck

Saturday morning, destroying most
homes and all government buildings in
this city, and leaving its 600,000 people
without power or water. Most have spent
three cold nights without shelter.
Two or three police looked on help
lessly as more than 200 people raided a
stock of food arranged by relief workers
at a soccer field near Muzaffarabad's
center — one of six designated aid distri
bution points. One man made off with a
big sack of sugar, another left on a motor
ized rickshaw with a big crate of drinking
water.
"Relief activity has started on a mas
sive level," said deputy city commissioner
Masood-ur Rehman. He said two army
brigades would start clearing roads and

debris in the city on TUesday.
With winter just six weeks away, the
United Nations said 2.5 million people in
the worst-hit areas near the mountainous
Pakistan-India border need shelter. The
U.N. World Food Program began a major
airlift of emergency supplies.
Pakistan army spokesman Maj. Gen.
Shaukat Sultan said a total of 30 helicop
ters, including eight U.S. military choppers
diverted from the war in Afghanistan,
would be supplying food, water, medicine
and other items to quake victims. Two
more German and four Afghan helicop
ters would arrive later Tuesday, he said.
Even longtime rival India planned to
send a planeload of food, tents and medi
cine after Pakistan set aside its often-bit

ter rivalry with its nuclear neighbor and
said that it would accept New Delhi's aid.
Islamabad, however, declined an offer of
Indian helicopters.
On the Indian side, the toll rose Tues
day to 1 ,(X)5.
Rescue teams, including Britons, Ger
mans and TUrks, used high-tech cameras
and lilting gear to search for survivors
under piles of concrete, steel and wood.
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf said
his government was doing its best to re
spond to the crisis.
"We are doing whatever is humanly
possible," Musharraf said. "There should
not be any blame game. We are trying to
reach all those areas where people need
our help."
