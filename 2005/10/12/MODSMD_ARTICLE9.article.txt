## New devices help elderly balance 
### CARLA K. JOHNSON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CHICAGO — Months after a drug reaction ru
ined her sense of balance, Barbara Doyle took a
trip to Europe. She had taught herself to walk
again, but she still fell — once in every country.
"I fell in Budapest, I fell in Prague and I fell in
Vienna," she said, remembering the 1999 trip.
Doyle, 72, and others like her with damaged
inner ears are helping researchers study the body's
balance system and how vision, the touch of one's
feet on the ground and the ear's fluid-filled inner
labyrinth work together to determine which end is
up.
Doyle's contribution may one day help the esti
mated six million people dealing with chronic
dizziness and balance disorders. As the nation's
population ages, their ranks are expected to swell
because the motion-detecting cells of the inner ear
can lose sensitivity with age.
While some researchers focus on the ancient
Chinese practice of tai chi to help people feel more
confident about their balance, others are more fu
turistic: building prototypes of devices from inner
ear implants to vibrating belts.
"Imagine a bunch of vibrating elements like in a
pager or cell phone," said Conrad Wall of the Mass
achusetts Ear and Eye Infirmary, who has a $2.5
million federal grant to develop a balance-enhanc
ing vest or belt or — as some female study partici
pants suggested — a balance bra.
"The motion sensor detects which way your
body is leaning," Wall said. "If you lean toward
your right, the vibrations give you a cue that you
have to straighten back up to vertical."
At least several years away from the market, the
device has tested well with fall-prone people trying
to stand up in shaky lab settings. Whether it will
help people walk with better balance is yet to be
thoroughly studied. Wall said.
Balance problems have a wide range of causes
including migraines, aging, 812 deficiency, small
strokes and calcium debris that breaks off and
floats in the inner ear where it sends jumbled sig
nals to the brain.
