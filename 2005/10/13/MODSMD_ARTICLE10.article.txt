## Maybe helmets aren't so bad? 
### 
Three accident-free years of campus
biking came to a dramatic end last
week when I took a nasty spill on my
way to drama class. Late for lecture, I was
hurriedly making my way through the con
gested lane on the east side of the Quad.
Swerving to avoid an annoying student me
andering down the street in zigzag patterns,
I caught the edge of a fancy Stanford man
hole cover and went down hard. Actually,
my tumble was almost graceful, until my
book bag smacked me on the back of the
head and drove my face into the ground.
Except fora minor neck strain, I escaped
uninjured, though you would have been
fooled by the attention I got. About 25 girls
rushed over to inquire, "Are you okay!?" I
had to tell all of them that I was indeed
"Fine, thanks" about 10 times before the
crowd dispersed. 1 started to wonder if
there was a major gash on my body that I
was unaware of, before remembering I was,
still, late for class. I was touched by my
peers' concern for my well-being, but, real
ly, the questions just added insult to my lack
of injury.
I was unsure about what to do at that
point. Remount the bike? I couldn't risk
falling off again in front of the same collec
tion of people, so I ended up walking my
bike to class. Actually, I wound up walking
my bike for the rest of the day. A week
later, I'm still a bit afraid to ride, but lucki
ly the psychological trauma is slowly wear
ing off.
Always the over-analyzer, I immediately
began to examine the cause of my embar
rassing misfortune. Clearly, it was that ass
hole's fault for walking in stupid irregular
patterns in the middle of a busy traffic
route. Who does that? I mean, really, is it
that hard to walk in a straight line? Then
again, had I not left late for class, been in a
rush, and been completely distracted by
thoughts of relationships, grad school and
homework, I wouldn't have been com
pelled to carelessly swerve around him in
the first place. Still, it was his fault.
Besides, my very public spill next to the
History Corner is not at all uncommon on
campus. It's almost a rite of passage — you
aren't really a Stanford student until you've
been in a biking accident of some sort.
On that note, you also aren't really a
Stanford student if you wear a helmet. Why
do we perpetuate the notion that wearing a
helmet makes you so un-cool and un-date
able? I do own one, after all. It has been
resting peacefully in a corner of my closet
(which I could really use for more shoe
space) since my very first day on campus. I
suspect that you have one stashed some
where, too. And yet no one on campus actu
ally wears a helmet, except for the group we
categorically lump into "grad students."
Undergrads usually only wear them on Hal
loween when they dress up as grad students.
A popular freshman year joke in Wilbur
was, "How can you tell who's a grad stu
dent?" "By the helmet they're always wear
ing!" Stupid joke, but then again freshman
year was pretty bad too.
Although envisioning a campus full of
helmet-wearing bikers is a lot like wishing
for world peace with Bush still in the White
House, there are definitely a few things that
can be done to improve bike safety on cam
pus. First, a few hand signals never killed
anyone. You can do it nonchalantly too and
make it look almost like you're just waving
to a friend. Put out that arm, bend an elbow,
and signal.
Second, stay to the right. When someone
else is coming towards you, casually move
to the right. I once saw a grad student (la
beled appropriately by his helmet) scream
at some kid, "this is Ping America! STAY
TO THE RIGHT." Politically incorrect,
sure, but I bet that freshman never biked to
the left again.
Third, don't bike when there's weather.
Countless students have broken their arms
and/or legs biking in the rain. It's really not
a good idea to bike on the slick campus
roads, even if you are wearing that helmet.
Lastly, just use common sense. You don't
really need to speed through the Intersec
tion of Death chatting on your cell phone
with one hand and carrying your latte in the
other. We can all stand to be a little more
considerate of our fellow bikers and pedes
trians. They're all just like you — busy and
late for class.

anyone. You can do it nonchalantly too and
make it look almost like you're just waving
to a friend. Put out that arm, bend an elbow,
and signal.
Second, stay to the right. When someone
else is coming towards you, casually move
to the right. I once saw a grad student (la
beled appropriately by his helmet) scream
at some kid, "this is Ping America! STAY
TO THE RIGHT." Politically incorrect,
sure, but I bet that freshman never biked to
the left again.
Third, don't bike when there's weather.
Countless students have broken their arms
and/or legs biking in the rain. It's really not
a good idea to bike on the slick campus
roads, even if you are wearing that helmet.
Lastly, just use common sense. You don't
really need to speed through the Intersec
tion of Death chatting on your cell phone
with one hand and carrying your latte in the
other. We can all stand to be a little more
considerate of our fellow bikers and pedes
trians. They're all just like you — busy and
late for class.

Do you wear a helmet? E-mail nramos@stan
ford.edu to educate me about bike safety.
Grad students preferred.

Three accident-free years of campus
biking came to a dramatic end last
week when I took a nasty spill on my
way to drama class. Late for lecture, I was
hurriedly making my way through the con
gested lane on the east side of the Quad.
Swerving to avoid an annoying student me
andering down the street in zigzag patterns,
I caught the edge of a fancy Stanford man
hole cover and went down hard. Actually,
my tumble was almost graceful, until my
book bag smacked me on the back of the
head and drove my face into the ground.
Except fora minor neck strain, I escaped
uninjured, though you would have been
fooled by the attention I got. About 25 girls
rushed over to inquire, "Are you okay!?" I
had to tell all of them that I was indeed
"Fine, thanks" about 10 times before the
crowd dispersed. 1 started to wonder if
there was a major gash on my body that I
was unaware of, before remembering I was,
still, late for class. I was touched by my
peers' concern for my well-being, but, real
ly, the questions just added insult to my lack
of injury.
I was unsure about what to do at that
point. Remount the bike? I couldn't risk
falling off again in front of the same collec
tion of people, so I ended up walking my
bike to class. Actually, I wound up walking
my bike for the rest of the day. A week
later, I'm still a bit afraid to ride, but lucki
ly the psychological trauma is slowly wear
ing off.
Always the over-analyzer, I immediately
began to examine the cause of my embar
rassing misfortune. Clearly, it was that ass
hole's fault for walking in stupid irregular
patterns in the middle of a busy traffic
route. Who does that? I mean, really, is it
that hard to walk in a straight line? Then
again, had I not left late for class, been in a
rush, and been completely distracted by
thoughts of relationships, grad school and
homework, I wouldn't have been com
pelled to carelessly swerve around him in
the first place. Still, it was his fault.
Besides, my very public spill next to the
History Corner is not at all uncommon on
campus. It's almost a rite of passage — you
aren't really a Stanford student until you've
been in a biking accident of some sort.
On that note, you also aren't really a
Stanford student if you wear a helmet. Why
do we perpetuate the notion that wearing a
helmet makes you so un-cool and un-date
able? I do own one, after all. It has been
resting peacefully in a corner of my closet
(which I could really use for more shoe
space) since my very first day on campus. I
suspect that you have one stashed some
where, too. And yet no one on campus actu
ally wears a helmet, except for the group we
categorically lump into "grad students."
Undergrads usually only wear them on Hal
loween when they dress up as grad students.
A popular freshman year joke in Wilbur
was, "How can you tell who's a grad stu
dent?" "By the helmet they're always wear
ing!" Stupid joke, but then again freshman
year was pretty bad too.
Although envisioning a campus full of
helmet-wearing bikers is a lot like wishing
for world peace with Bush still in the White
House, there are definitely a few things that
can be done to improve bike safety on cam
pus. First, a few hand signals never killed
anyone. You can do it nonchalantly too and
make it look almost like you're just waving
to a friend. Put out that arm, bend an elbow,
and signal.
