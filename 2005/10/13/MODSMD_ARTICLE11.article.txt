With the full moon on Oct. 17 drawing near,
freshmen and seniors (and those undercover in-be
tween-ers) should spend some time contemplating
an oft forgotten issue — the potential health risks of
Monday's Full Moon on the Quad.
"Sketchy, drunken, senior guys with diseases?"
says freshman Diana Willard. "That might be a con
cern."
While some freshmen share Willard's uneasiness
and cite the threat of infection as a potential deter
rent front participating in the Stanford rite of pas
sage, many students do choose to take part in the an
nual tradition, and peer health educators (PHEs)
have been busy making preparations to assure that
the event stays fun and safe.
"The spread of disease, alcohol-related emergen
cies and unwanted advances are the Big Three prob
lems," says junior John Shen, a PHE in
Freshman/Sophomore College (FroSoCo) and a
photographer for The Daily.
Mononucleosis (mono), more commonly known
as the "kissing disease," is transmitted through sali
va or blood. Contracting the disease is thus an obvi
ous concern at Full Moon, which revolves around
swapping spit. Some freshmen say they may choose
only to observe on Monday night due to their fear of
catching the disease.

But despite alarmist rumors, the spread of mono
is not actually a frequently-reported consequence.
"Yes, it is possible to transmit mono from kissing,
but I think it is a very small risk," says Kate Bedford,
peer health coordinator at Vaden Health Center.
This message is echoed by PHFs, who also offer
tips for those who want to be careful and are serious
about avoiding possible infection. They caution that
although it may seem counterintuitive, participants
should not brush their teeth just before the event.
"Brushing can open up little tears that spread dis
ease more easily," Shen says."The PHEs have a Lis
terine booth set up |at the event] instead."
And senior Stephanie Nguyen, former PHE in
Soto, has more suggestions.
"If you are concerned about contracting mono, I
would suggest either opting to observe or to sticking
to kisses on the cheek," she says."(But] I actually
think that this problem is definitely overblown."
Besides expressing concern over the possible
spread of disease, the University forecasts the po
tential for alcohol-related mishaps. Students have
been known to "prc-gamc" by drinking before they
arrive to loosen inhibitions in order to have more
fun. This can lead to cases of assault, arrest or hospi
talization due to alcohol poisoning. Two alcohol poi
soning occurrences were reported in 2004, down
from the five in 2003.
"Full Moon is designated as an alcohol-free event,"
says Ralph Castro, manager of the Substance Abuse

Prevention Program of Vaden's Health Promotion Ser
vice. "If students are visibly drunk and/or are displaying
problematic behavior, then they will be asked to leave.
The vast majority of students who attend have a great
time without experiencing any problems."
Risks notwithstanding, most students believe
that Full Moon is an essential Stanford tradition that
should not be missed. And because event coordina
tors are so focused on safety, some students feel it is
less risky than many campus parties.
"There can't be any greater risk than at an aver
age frat party," says sophomore Katy McCown.
PHEs and counselors from the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center (SHPRC) will be stationed at
tables in Main Quad to provide necessary health es
sentials like mouthwash and condoms. Student mon
itors, University staff and police will also be present
to ensure that students are not engaging in danger
ous and risky behaviors. The university suggests that
students attend Full Moon with groups of friends and
remain aware of their surroundings. Being cautious is
the best way to alleviate worries when participating.
"Full Moon is a really fun event and a great op
portunity to play and enjoy a silly Stanford tradi
tion," Bedford remarks. "Be smart; know your per
sonal limits and stick to them. Just because it is Full
Moon doesn't mean you need to do something you
don't feel comfortable doing. If you want to kiss
folks — kiss. If not, that is cool too. Just make your
intentions known."

With the full moon on Oct. 17 drawing near,
freshmen and seniors (and those undercover in-be
tween-ers) should spend some time contemplating
an oft forgotten issue — the potential health risks of
Monday's Full Moon on the Quad.
"Sketchy, drunken, senior guys with diseases?"
says freshman Diana Willard. "That might be a con
cern."
While some freshmen share Willard's uneasiness
and cite the threat of infection as a potential deter
rent front participating in the Stanford rite of pas
sage, many students do choose to take part in the an
nual tradition, and peer health educators (PHEs)
have been busy making preparations to assure that
the event stays fun and safe.
"The spread of disease, alcohol-related emergen
cies and unwanted advances are the Big Three prob
lems," says junior John Shen, a PHE in
Freshman/Sophomore College (FroSoCo) and a
photographer for The Daily.
Mononucleosis (mono), more commonly known
as the "kissing disease," is transmitted through sali
va or blood. Contracting the disease is thus an obvi
ous concern at Full Moon, which revolves around
swapping spit. Some freshmen say they may choose
only to observe on Monday night due to their fear of
catching the disease.

But despite alarmist rumors, the spread of mono
is not actually a frequently-reported consequence.
"Yes, it is possible to transmit mono from kissing,
but I think it is a very small risk," says Kate Bedford,
peer health coordinator at Vaden Health Center.
This message is echoed by PHFs, who also offer
tips for those who want to be careful and are serious
about avoiding possible infection. They caution that
although it may seem counterintuitive, participants
should not brush their teeth just before the event.
"Brushing can open up little tears that spread dis
ease more easily," Shen says."The PHEs have a Lis
terine booth set up |at the event] instead."
And senior Stephanie Nguyen, former PHE in
Soto, has more suggestions.
"If you are concerned about contracting mono, I
would suggest either opting to observe or to sticking
to kisses on the cheek," she says."(But] I actually
think that this problem is definitely overblown."
Besides expressing concern over the possible
spread of disease, the University forecasts the po
tential for alcohol-related mishaps. Students have
been known to "prc-gamc" by drinking before they
arrive to loosen inhibitions in order to have more
fun. This can lead to cases of assault, arrest or hospi
talization due to alcohol poisoning. Two alcohol poi
soning occurrences were reported in 2004, down
from the five in 2003.
"Full Moon is designated as an alcohol-free event,"
says Ralph Castro, manager of the Substance Abuse

Prevention Program of Vaden's Health Promotion Ser
vice. "If students are visibly drunk and/or are displaying
problematic behavior, then they will be asked to leave.
The vast majority of students who attend have a great
time without experiencing any problems."
Risks notwithstanding, most students believe
that Full Moon is an essential Stanford tradition that
should not be missed. And because event coordina
tors are so focused on safety, some students feel it is
less risky than many campus parties.
"There can't be any greater risk than at an aver
age frat party," says sophomore Katy McCown.

Peer Resource Center (SHPRC) will be stationed at

sentials like mouthwash and condoms. Student mon
