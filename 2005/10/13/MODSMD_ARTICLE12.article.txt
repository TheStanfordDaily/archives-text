# Family therapy: trends in eating disorder treatment
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students with eating disorders are not an un
common sight at Stanford, as Laure Negiar
notes in "Food and the body: A French girls per
spective" — her column in this Monday's Daily.
According to the National Association
of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Dis
orders (ANAD), approximately 7 million
women and 1 million men nationwide suf
fer from eating disorders. With treatment.
60 percent recover from their disorders. 20
percent partially recover and the last 20
percent do not improve at all.
To increase these low rates of recupera
tion, some medical experts, including James
Lock, associate professor of child psychia
try and pediatrics at Stanford University
School of Medicine, have experimented
with a family-based approach to eating dis
order treatment. The method, sometimes
called the Maudsley Approach, was origi
nally developed in London in 2001, accord
ing to the Oct. 2001 edition of The Journal
of Psychotherapy Practice and Research.
Lock, along with Daniel le Grange, asso
ciate professor of psychiatry at the Univer
sity of Chicago. W. Stewart Agras. professor
of psychiatry and behavioral sciences emer
itus at Stanford, and Christopher Dare,
reader in psychotherapy at King's College

in London, published a hook ahout this
method in 2001 called "Treatment Manual
for Anorexia Nervosa: A Family-Based Ap
proach." The book outlines specific steps
that families can take in order to implement
the Maudsley Approach.
On Oct. 3, the Los Angeles Times print
ed a story ahout an upward national trend
in using the family-based method and said
that the book "has become a bible for ther
apists who want to try the method."
Lock tells The Daily, "It's not that the
widely-used treatments aren't good. It's
hard to study anorexia, so there just isn't a
lot of data to support the claim that these
traditional treatments work."
Traditional methods include placing
blame for the disorder, in a sense, on bad
family relationships and using psychothera
py to attempt to identify factors which may
have triggered the disease, says the article
in the Los Angeles Times.
The family-based Maudsley Approach,
on the other hand, deemphasizes the role of
blame. Instead, it "incorporates elements of a
variety of treatment methods developed by
other clinicians," says The Journal of Psy
chotherapy Practice and Research. These in
clude "the use of family meals; specific tech
niques for family empowerment; a non-au
thoritarian therapeutic stance; and external
izing the illness from the patient and family."

In particular. Lock and his colleagues
tout the importance of eating meals togeth
er as a family to help an eating-disordered
individual recover, according to the Los
Angeles Times. Through doing so. families
can ensure that the anorexic child or teen
eats. Parents plan his or her meals and the
family sits at the dinner table together until
he or she eats an adequate amount of food.
Often, this can take hours, the article says.
After the meal, the family keeps a close
eye on the eating-disordered individual to
prevent other unhealthy behaviors. For ex
ample. many patients are not allowed to
close the door to the bathroom in case they
decide to purge their food. Others are
barred from exercising.
If a patient refuses to eat. the family out
lines consequences. Parents may cease al
lowing their child to attend school or to go
out with friends. In some cases, no one —
neither the patient nor any other family
member — is allowed to leave the table until
the patient has consumed enough calories.
In addition. Lock says he thinks it is fu
tile to attempt to establish blame in an
anorexic's diagnosis.
"The family dynamic is confusing and
frustrating when family members find out
about the disorder." he says."Parents get anx
ious. There are fights. Family troubles may be
the result of the problem, not the cause."

Critics of the family-based approach
find the treatment too harsh or inadequate
in pinpointing the true causes of the prob
lem. but Lock and le Grange conducted a
study with 45 patients, published in The
Journal of the American Academy of Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry in January 2005,
that showed the majority of patients who
are treated through the family-based ap
proach do improve significantly. After par
ticipating in 17 family-based treatment ses
sions, 56 percent of anorexic patients in the
study "had a good outcome, 33 percent had
an intermediate outcome and 11 percent
had a poor outcome," says the article in the
Los Angeles Times.
But the family-based approach would
clearly be difficult to implement for people
who have already moved out of their child
hood homes — and that includes many
Stanford students.
"Ann." a student on the Farm who wishes
to remain unidentified, says she developed
bulimia four years ago. Although she sought
counseling and gained weight fora period of
time, the improvements did not last: she still
falls in and out of disordered eating cycles.
I lopefully, eating disorder experts will
soon develop recovery approaches for peo
ple like "Ann" — perhaps centered on in
tense peer support rather than family inter
vention.

nally developed in London in 2001, accord
ing to the Oct. 2001 edition of The Journal
of Psychotherapy Practice and Research.
Lock, along with Daniel le Grange, asso
ciate professor of psychiatry at the Univer
sity of Chicago. W. Stewart Agras. professor
of psychiatry and behavioral sciences emer
itus at Stanford, and Christopher Dare,
reader in psychotherapy at King's College

in London, published a hook ahout this
method in 2001 called "Treatment Manual
for Anorexia Nervosa: A Family-Based Ap
proach." The book outlines specific steps
that families can take in order to implement
the Maudsley Approach.
On Oct. 3, the Los Angeles Times print
ed a story ahout an upward national trend
in using the family-based method and said
that the book "has become a bible for ther
apists who want to try the method."
Lock tells The Daily, "It's not that the
widely-used treatments aren't good. It's
hard to study anorexia, so there just isn't a
lot of data to support the claim that these
traditional treatments work."
Traditional methods include placing
blame for the disorder, in a sense, on bad
family relationships and using psychothera
py to attempt to identify factors which may
have triggered the disease, says the article
in the Los Angeles Times.
The family-based Maudsley Approach,
on the other hand, deemphasizes the role of
blame. Instead, it "incorporates elements of a
variety of treatment methods developed by
other clinicians," says The Journal of Psy
chotherapy Practice and Research. These in
clude "the use of family meals; specific tech
niques for family empowerment; a non-au
thoritarian therapeutic stance; and external
izing the illness from the patient and family."

In particular. Lock and his colleagues
tout the importance of eating meals togeth
er as a family to help an eating-disordered
individual recover, according to the Los
Angeles Times. Through doing so. families
can ensure that the anorexic child or teen
eats. Parents plan his or her meals and the
family sits at the dinner table together until
he or she eats an adequate amount of food.
Often, this can take hours, the article says.
After the meal, the family keeps a close
eye on the eating-disordered individual to
prevent other unhealthy behaviors. For ex
ample. many patients are not allowed to
close the door to the bathroom in case they
decide to purge their food. Others are
barred from exercising.
If a patient refuses to eat. the family out
lines consequences. Parents may cease al
lowing their child to attend school or to go
out with friends. In some cases, no one —
neither the patient nor any other family
member — is allowed to leave the table until
the patient has consumed enough calories.
In addition. Lock says he thinks it is fu
tile to attempt to establish blame in an
anorexic's diagnosis.
"The family dynamic is confusing and
frustrating when family members find out
about the disorder." he says."Parents get anx
ious. There are fights. Family troubles may be
the result of the problem, not the cause."

Critics of the family-based approach
find the treatment too harsh or inadequate
in pinpointing the true causes of the prob
lem. but Lock and le Grange conducted a
study with 45 patients, published in The
Journal of the American Academy of Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry in January 2005,
that showed the majority of patients who
are treated through the family-based ap
proach do improve significantly. After par
ticipating in 17 family-based treatment ses
sions, 56 percent of anorexic patients in the
study "had a good outcome, 33 percent had
an intermediate outcome and 11 percent
had a poor outcome," says the article in the
Los Angeles Times.
But the family-based approach would
clearly be difficult to implement for people
who have already moved out of their child
hood homes — and that includes many
Stanford students.
"Ann." a student on the Farm who wishes
to remain unidentified, says she developed
bulimia four years ago. Although she sought
counseling and gained weight fora period of
time, the improvements did not last: she still
falls in and out of disordered eating cycles.
I lopefully, eating disorder experts will
soon develop recovery approaches for peo
ple like "Ann" — perhaps centered on in
tense peer support rather than family inter
vention.
Students with eating disorders are not an un
common sight at Stanford, as Laure Negiar
notes in "Food and the body: A French girls per
spective" — her column in this Monday's Daily.
According to the National Association
of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Dis
orders (ANAD), approximately 7 million
women and 1 million men nationwide suf
fer from eating disorders. With treatment.
60 percent recover from their disorders. 20
percent partially recover and the last 20
percent do not improve at all.
To increase these low rates of recupera
tion, some medical experts, including James
Lock, associate professor of child psychia
try and pediatrics at Stanford University
School of Medicine, have experimented
with a family-based approach to eating dis
order treatment. The method, sometimes
called the Maudsley Approach, was origi
nally developed in London in 2001, accord
