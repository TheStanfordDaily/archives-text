## Editorial Suggestions and guidelines for Commencement 2006 
### 
Until last spring, seniors could look for
ward to Commencement as a distant
but certain eventuality. Right now,
however, June's graduation ceremony re
mains shrouded in mystery. With the renova
tion of the Stanford Stadium — the venue for
Commencement for the last 21 years — plans
are still vague as to where Commencement
will be held and how it will be organized.
We support the renovation of the Stan
ford Stadium, even if this means that Com
mencement has to be displaced. But we
know that the Class of 2006 only has one op
portunity to graduate, and many graduate
students have been working the better part
of a decade for this achievement. Planners of
this year's Commencement need to ac
knowledge that. After all, we will be the only
class in over two decades to finish our Stan
ford careers outside that stadium.
We also acknowledge that there will be
no satisfactory solution. Departmental cere
monies will trump a big final ceremony, as
most of us will be without grandparents, sib
lings and good friends when officially gradu
ating in Frost Amphitheatre — or whatever
venue is finally chosen.
Still, putting 25,000 people anywhere but
in the Stadium is a challenge not even the
most ambitious Stanford grad would want to
face. There are some simple solutions which
we hope are being considered, such as split
ting the ceremonies up between graduate
students and undergraduates, and having
one speaker give two speeches. In the
process, everyone needs to feel that they are
valued equally and that no one is being
placed in the third-choice venue, or listening
to a second-choice speaker. The University
should focus on fairness and impressions as
much as it does on logistics.
A new way to look at things
We sympathize with those making deci
sions because we know that cries of outrage
will greet any proposal, however fair and
balanced. But if we start out by looking at
Commencement as a preordained disap
pointment, no one will be satisfied with the
outcome.
Instead, we'll start out by suggesting two
better ways to approach the change. In one

sense, the new graduation could spark new
graduation customs. Graduate students
often feel less-than-satisfied with a gradua
tion prepared largely for undergraduates,
and the speaker is often chosen for under
graduates alone. Graduation can feel imper
sonal, especially for those who also come
from large departments to begin with. Per
haps a move to Frost, a separation of cere
monies and a change in format could be ap
proached as a trial run for new Commence
ment traditions, instead of lowly substitutes
for past Commencement traditions. If
enough other open events can be conjured,
— opening up and promoting Class Day
might be an option, as could designing an
other ceremony in the Quad — maybe the
Commencement ceremony could succeed as
a smaller, more student-focused program,
rather than a grand spectacle that draws as
many fans as one of our football games.
A second and complementary option is to
approach Commencement with vigor equal
to that of the stadium renovation. Clearly,
Commencement was not the first thing on the
minds of those designing the $85-million ren
ovation plan. That fact can be treated as an
asset, however. Instead of sacrificing this
year's graduation as a loss, the renewed Com
mencement can be viewed as part of the ren
ovation plan. We're not calling for outrageous
sums of money, but clearly coordinating and
preparing Frost, organizing a simulcast, de
signing new events for those who cannot at
tend the ceremony and perhaps paying a sec
ond Commencement speaker should be
rolled into the costs of renovation. These are
budget items that have a specific cause, and a
specific source of capital. This year's senior
class, and this year's students in general,
should not have to bear the burden of a huge
capital project that will benefit the University
for another 75 years.
And some guidelines
The key, we think, is not specifics, but the
approach. Accordingly, we have some guide
lines:
First of all, encourage everyone to attend.

have traditionally been open and
inviting, and even if tickets are re
quired for some portions, care
should be taken that graduation
does not become an exclusive event.
Second, design the facilities with
a focus not just on logistics, but also
on aesthetics. Frost is a wonderful
venue for Commencement, and it
was specifically designed for that
purpose. When it was originally land
scaped, for Commencement in 1937,
red and white roses were planted
such that they bloomed each June.
Similar attention should be focused
to this year's planning, so that by the
time June 2006 rolls around, gradu

ates are raving and not complaining.
Third, separate undergraduate
and graduate ceremonies, and con
sider that it might be better to allow
both to graduate in Frost at different
times, rather than relegating one sec
tion to the Sunken Diamond or an
other improvised venue. No one
should feel secondary at Com
mencement, a momentous occasion
for everyone involved.
Fourth, consider the option of
using the same big-name speaker for
both graduate students and under
graduates, and encourage the speak
er to speak twice, at two separate
ceremonies, if necessary. In this way,
neither graduating class will feel in
ferior. Or use this unique opportuni
ty to target the Commencement
speakers more directly, looking not
just fora big name, but for someone
who can actually give a relevant.

member for its message, not for its
gaffes. Graduate students should be
involved more thoroughly in this se
lection process, both in nominating
speakers and in picking the final
ones. As the University focuses on
creating more of a graduate-student
community, it should keep the focus
on graduate-student participation in
University life all the way through
Commencement.
Finally, and probably most impor

be a typical Commencement; it will
be whatever the students make of it.

If Commencement changes for the
better.as we genuinely believe it can,
it can be just as much a legacy as any
new stadium.
Until last spring, seniors could look for
ward to Commencement as a distant
but certain eventuality. Right now,
however, June's graduation ceremony re
mains shrouded in mystery. With the renova
tion of the Stanford Stadium — the venue for
Commencement for the last 21 years — plans
are still vague as to where Commencement
will be held and how it will be organized.
We support the renovation of the Stan
ford Stadium, even if this means that Com
mencement has to be displaced. But we
know that the Class of 2006 only has one op
portunity to graduate, and many graduate
students have been working the better part
of a decade for this achievement. Planners of
this year's Commencement need to ac
knowledge that. After all, we will be the only
class in over two decades to finish our Stan
ford careers outside that stadium.
We also acknowledge that there will be
no satisfactory solution. Departmental cere
monies will trump a big final ceremony, as
most of us will be without grandparents, sib
lings and good friends when officially gradu
ating in Frost Amphitheatre — or whatever
venue is finally chosen.
Still, putting 25,000 people anywhere but
in the Stadium is a challenge not even the
most ambitious Stanford grad would want to
face. There are some simple solutions which
we hope are being considered, such as split
ting the ceremonies up between graduate
students and undergraduates, and having
one speaker give two speeches. In the
process, everyone needs to feel that they are
valued equally and that no one is being
placed in the third-choice venue, or listening
to a second-choice speaker. The University
should focus on fairness and impressions as
much as it does on logistics.
A new way to look at things
We sympathize with those making deci
sions because we know that cries of outrage
will greet any proposal, however fair and
balanced. But if we start out by looking at
Commencement as a preordained disap
pointment, no one will be satisfied with the
outcome.
Instead, we'll start out by suggesting two
better ways to approach the change. In one

sense, the new graduation could spark new
graduation customs. Graduate students
often feel less-than-satisfied with a gradua
tion prepared largely for undergraduates,
and the speaker is often chosen for under
graduates alone. Graduation can feel imper
sonal, especially for those who also come
from large departments to begin with. Per
haps a move to Frost, a separation of cere
monies and a change in format could be ap
proached as a trial run for new Commence
ment traditions, instead of lowly substitutes
for past Commencement traditions. If
enough other open events can be conjured,
— opening up and promoting Class Day
might be an option, as could designing an
other ceremony in the Quad — maybe the
Commencement ceremony could succeed as
a smaller, more student-focused program,
rather than a grand spectacle that draws as
many fans as one of our football games.
A second and complementary option is to
approach Commencement with vigor equal
to that of the stadium renovation. Clearly,
Commencement was not the first thing on the
minds of those designing the $85-million ren
ovation plan. That fact can be treated as an
asset, however. Instead of sacrificing this
year's graduation as a loss, the renewed Com
mencement can be viewed as part of the ren
ovation plan. We're not calling for outrageous
sums of money, but clearly coordinating and
preparing Frost, organizing a simulcast, de
signing new events for those who cannot at
tend the ceremony and perhaps paying a sec
ond Commencement speaker should be
rolled into the costs of renovation. These are
budget items that have a specific cause, and a
specific source of capital. This year's senior
class, and this year's students in general,
should not have to bear the burden of a huge
capital project that will benefit the University
for another 75 years.
And some guidelines
The key, we think, is not specifics, but the
approach. Accordingly, we have some guide
lines:
First of all, encourage everyone to attend.

have traditionally been open and
inviting, and even if tickets are re
quired for some portions, care
should be taken that graduation
does not become an exclusive event.
Second, design the facilities with
a focus not just on logistics, but also
on aesthetics. Frost is a wonderful
venue for Commencement, and it
was specifically designed for that
purpose. When it was originally land
scaped, for Commencement in 1937,
red and white roses were planted
such that they bloomed each June.
Similar attention should be focused
to this year's planning, so that by the
time June 2006 rolls around, gradu

ates are raving and not complaining.
Third, separate undergraduate
and graduate ceremonies, and con
sider that it might be better to allow
both to graduate in Frost at different
times, rather than relegating one sec
tion to the Sunken Diamond or an
other improvised venue. No one
should feel secondary at Com
mencement, a momentous occasion
for everyone involved.
Fourth, consider the option of
using the same big-name speaker for
both graduate students and under
graduates, and encourage the speak
er to speak twice, at two separate
ceremonies, if necessary. In this way,
neither graduating class will feel in
ferior. Or use this unique opportuni
ty to target the Commencement
speakers more directly, looking not
just fora big name, but for someone
who can actually give a relevant.

moving speech that students will re
member for its message, not for its
gaffes. Graduate students should be
involved more thoroughly in this se
lection process, both in nominating
speakers and in picking the final
ones. As the University focuses on
creating more of a graduate-student
community, it should keep the focus
on graduate-student participation in
University life all the way through
Commencement.
Finally, and probably most impor
tantly, solicit student input more
thoroughly and encourage the senior
class and final-year graduate stu
dents to join the effort. This will not
be a typical Commencement; it will
