## Editorial Suggestions and guidelines for Commencement 2006 
### 
Until last spring, seniors could look for
ward to Commencement as a distant
but certain eventuality. Right now,
however, June's graduation ceremony re
mains shrouded in mystery. With the renova
tion of the Stanford Stadium — the venue for
Commencement for the last 21 years — plans
are still vague as to where Commencement
will be held and how it will be organized.
We support the renovation of the Stan
ford Stadium, even if this means that Com
mencement has to be displaced. But we
know that the Class of 2006 only has one op
portunity to graduate, and many graduate
students have been working the better part
of a decade for this achievement. Planners of
this year's Commencement need to ac
knowledge that. After all, we will be the only
class in over two decades to finish our Stan
ford careers outside that stadium.
We also acknowledge that there will be
no satisfactory solution. Departmental cere
monies will trump a big final ceremony, as
most of us will be without grandparents, sib
lings and good friends when officially gradu
ating in Frost Amphitheatre — or whatever
venue is finally chosen.
Still, putting 25,000 people anywhere but
in the Stadium is a challenge not even the
most ambitious Stanford grad would want to
face. There are some simple solutions which
we hope are being considered, such as split
ting the ceremonies up between graduate
students and undergraduates, and having
one speaker give two speeches. In the
process, everyone needs to feel that they are
valued equally and that no one is being
placed in the third-choice venue, or listening
to a second-choice speaker. The University
should focus on fairness and impressions as
much as it does on logistics.
A new way to look at things
We sympathize with those making deci
sions because we know that cries of outrage
will greet any proposal, however fair and
balanced. But if we start out by looking at
Commencement as a preordained disap
pointment, no one will be satisfied with the
outcome.
Instead, we'll start out by suggesting two
better ways to approach the change. In one

sense, the new graduation could spark new
graduation customs. Graduate students
often feel less-than-satisfied with a gradua
tion prepared largely for undergraduates,
and the speaker is often chosen for under
graduates alone. Graduation can feel imper
sonal, especially for those who also come
from large departments to begin with. Per
haps a move to Frost, a separation of cere
monies and a change in format could be ap
proached as a trial run for new Commence
ment traditions, instead of lowly substitutes
for past Commencement traditions. If
enough other open events can be conjured,
— opening up and promoting Class Day
might be an option, as could designing an
other ceremony in the Quad — maybe the
Commencement ceremony could succeed as
a smaller, more student-focused program,
rather than a grand spectacle that draws as
many fans as one of our football games.
A second and complementary option is to
approach Commencement with vigor equal
to that of the stadium renovation. Clearly,
Commencement was not the first thing on the
minds of those designing the $85-million ren
ovation plan. That fact can be treated as an
asset, however. Instead of sacrificing this
year's graduation as a loss, the renewed Com
mencement can be viewed as part of the ren
ovation plan. We're not calling for outrageous
sums of money, but clearly coordinating and
preparing Frost, organizing a simulcast, de
signing new events for those who cannot at
tend the ceremony and perhaps paying a sec
ond Commencement speaker should be
rolled into the costs of renovation. These are
budget items that have a specific cause, and a
specific source of capital. This year's senior
class, and this year's students in general,
should not have to bear the burden of a huge
capital project that will benefit the University
for another 75 years.
And some guidelines
The key, we think, is not specifics, but the
approach. Accordingly, we have some guide
lines:
First of all, encourage everyone to attend.
