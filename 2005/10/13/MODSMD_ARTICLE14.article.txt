A. ▼ JLFunny accents, like the above
quote from"The Princess Bride," are a hilar
ious byproduct of living in a society as di
verse as ours. Southerners, immigrants and
the deaf all mangle the English language, but
at the same time provide us with great com
edy — albeit at their own expense. But what
happens when the tables are turned?
As an American in Europe, opening my
mouth is like telling people at a party that
you're in SLE. The gawks, the awkward
questions, the mistrust and the ultimate re
jection are all the same. Well, maybe it's not
as bad as being a SLE kid, but still, being on
the Continent can often be a difficult experi

accent sounds just plain annoying, but it's
mostly because America elicits lots of asso

Europeans. My friends and I get plenty of
cock-eyed glances and quiet sneers on buses,
trains and on the street, but most of the time
it goes no further.
One exception that stands out in my mind

occurred last week. My friend Kelsey and I
were lost on a dark Berlin street on the way
to our Bing dinner, when a few TUrkish
youths approached us and asked what time
it was. We answered partly in English, catch

"English?" they asked.
"No. American."
"Where?"
"New York."
"Haha, New York," one said while mak
ing an up-and-down motion with his hands
and saying something in German.
"What did he say?" I asked his friend.
"World Trade Center ist kaput," he said
before they all broke into laughter.
This is definitely an isolated incident, and
the overwhelming majority of Europeans
have been pretty nice to me. But an under
tone of annoyance and wariness on the faces
of those I meet is still perceptible, so much so
that I am often reluctant to talk at all.

a few weeks ago, has taken to putting on a
