## Avoiding an American accent and adopting Aussie aliases

A. ▼ JLFunny accents, like the above
quote from"The Princess Bride," are a hilar
ious byproduct of living in a society as di
verse as ours. Southerners, immigrants and
the deaf all mangle the English language, but
at the same time provide us with great com
edy — albeit at their own expense. But what
happens when the tables are turned?
As an American in Europe, opening my
mouth is like telling people at a party that
you're in SLE. The gawks, the awkward
questions, the mistrust and the ultimate re
jection are all the same. Well, maybe it's not
as bad as being a SLE kid, but still, being on
the Continent can often be a difficult experi
ence. Part of this is because our American
accent sounds just plain annoying, but it's
mostly because America elicits lots of asso
ciations — both positive and negative — for
Europeans. My friends and I get plenty of
cock-eyed glances and quiet sneers on buses,
trains and on the street, but most of the time
it goes no further.
One exception that stands out in my mind

occurred last week. My friend Kelsey and I
were lost on a dark Berlin street on the way
to our Bing dinner, when a few TUrkish
youths approached us and asked what time
it was. We answered partly in English, catch
ing their attention.
"English?" they asked.
"No. American."
"Where?"
"New York."
"Haha, New York," one said while mak
ing an up-and-down motion with his hands
and saying something in German.
"What did he say?" I asked his friend.
"World Trade Center ist kaput," he said
before they all broke into laughter.
This is definitely an isolated incident, and
the overwhelming majority of Europeans
have been pretty nice to me. But an under
tone of annoyance and wariness on the faces
of those I meet is still perceptible, so much so
that I am often reluctant to talk at all.
My friend Will, whom I visited in London
a few weeks ago, has taken to putting on a
slight British inflection when talking
in public, to avoid immediately stick
ing out as an American. Usually peo
ple mistake him as South African,
Canadian or mildly retarded, but he
still gets by without the American
stigma. Initially, I dismissed this as
silly and possibly unpatriotic, but
after just three weeks in Europe, I
have come to see its attraction.
Last week, 1 was sitting outside a
train station pre-gaming with my
friends Joanna and Chris before
going out. when I had the hot idea
that we should put on British ac
cents. I'll admit that my first motiva
tion was in the interest of picking-up
chicks, but a secondary concern was
leaving behind my American per
sona fora few hours. In practice, I
ended up sounding like an Aus
tralian chimney sweep with really
poor pronunciation, but we were
able to roll with it.
"I'm from Syd-nay, but ee's from
Purr-th," I shouted repeatedly as our
wild band of Aussie rabblerousers

traipsed from one bar to the next. We
got more dirty looks than I care to re
member. but the accent freed us from
our embarassment; as Australians, we
didn't give a damn what passersby
thought of us, and the end result was
an endless chorus of Chris, kelsey
and I yelling "Oi!" Even Joanna, who
normally talks as loud as most people
whisper, became loud and belliger
ent. We did eventually meet some
German girls, but the greatest success
was escaping our nationality for one
night and partially cutting loose (as
opposed to completely cutting loose,
like when I tried to jump over a
garbage can in Weimar on Sunday,
and ended up limping home with a
b':dly bruised arm and leg).
In oilier news, the Welcome to
Florida saga continues. For those of
you who missed it. 1 trashed this
band two weeks ago in a column and
have been recieving correspondance
from members of the band and their
fans since. The guys from the band
have actually been really nice, but
one New York University student,
who claims to be a friend of theirs, e
mailed me and promised to write the
following about me in his next col
umn for NYU's rag, er, paper:
' My friend is the lead singer fora

New Hampshire-based band named
Welcome to Florida. They have a
promising sound and are close to a
record deal. In his profile was a link
to a column done in The Stanford
Daily online edition. 1 read the arti
cle. It was a column. Imagine if Dave
Barry and an Eskimo had illicet (sic)
sex and their love child wrote a gos
sip column. In it he smashed Wel
come to Florida's album, and in his
next column, after receiving an ami
able email from the drummer,
trashed them again saying, 'So there,
more press for your sucky band.' His
e-mail is dherbert@stanford.edu. If
you find him as humiliatingly cheesy
and trite as I do please e-mail him
and let him know."
My first response was to tell this
guy to fuck off. But instead, I have
decided to let the people decide for
themselves. So, I am including his
comments in my column, allowing
his opinion be printed where it might
actually be read.

Where do you stand in the ongoing
Welcome to Florida feud? Send David
Herbert your expressions of solidarity
(though preferably not in poor imita
tions of an Australian accent) at dher
bert@stanford. edu.
