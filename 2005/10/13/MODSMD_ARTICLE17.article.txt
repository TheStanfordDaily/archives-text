Those lips redder than b100d... That
breath sweeter than honey... Hair so
flourishing, bright and strong that any
man to strangle himself with it would die, in
the words of Camus,"a happy death"..."! am
giving into despair — I am, after all, going to
Full Moon on The Quad," I said casually at
the end of last summer. My friend aban
doned his jovial ways and assumed a serious
mode. "You and I, pal, don't do such things.
Even if you do, you know you will cringe in
fits of regret afterwards," he said before re
suming his flippancy again. The friend knew
me well enough. It now only remains to
demonstrate my moral motivations for re
fraining from this year's Full Moon on The
Quad.
Consequentialism is (roughly) the moral
view that judges an action's worth by how
much good an act brings — good being
pleasure, happiness or welfare. In any conse
quentialist account, a practice such as Full
Moon on The Quad is likely to score highly.
After all. Full Moon on The Quad brings im
mediate gratification to its participants, with
minimal health costs — we are clean people,
after all. But, despite this inclination, a more
reasonable, if indirect, consequentialist ac
count shows that this is not the case. Further,
a more important deontological account
shows that the practice is immoral. (Deon
tology is the moral view that judges an ac
tion's worth in accordance with principles
and duties).
Full Moon on the Quad only offers us a

brief respite from the dogma-pervaded and
risk-averse dating scene at Stanford. I think a
truly consequentialist account would deem
the permanent and easy access to dating far
better than a temporary and limited semi
sexual dabbling. By indulging ourselves in
activities such as Full Moon on the Quad (or
Full Moon on the Quad-esque activities such
as random hook-ups), we give ourselves a
temporary break from the risks of dating.
Such temporary deviations serve to cajole us
into thinking we are satisfied, and to obliter
ate any motivation for meaningful relation
ships. These activities trivially satisfy the sex
ual and emotional instincts that should en
courage us to date, to form deep ties and to
find more permanent satisfaction. It is as if a
man were fasting all his life, and, to help him
fast, he periodically sates his hunger. The
point is not to be content with occasional
nourishment, but to end the fast. In a direct
ly consequentialist account. Full Moon on
the Quad may seem like a pleasure-maxi
mization phenomenon, but a deeper look
shows that it is only an act of desperation to

put our instincts to slumber so that they do
not worry us. It is a self-crippling act that of
fers illusory pleasure.
"So then," the cynic might ask, "If these
temporary alleviations are detrimental, why
can't we just have Full Moon on the Quad
every week, to provide constant satisfaction?
Is that what you propose?"The question is, in
fact, relevant. To make a final judgment, we
should look at a deontological interpreta
tion.
Immanuel Kant based his morality on the
autonomy of rational agents. He thought
that, if I highly value my self-directed ration
ality — that is, my conscious self that is able
to make decisions autonomously — then I
should highly value the same self-directed
rationality in others. As Allen Wood wrote,
"Kant thinks that we cannot employ reason
in making decisions without according a spe
cial and primary value to rational nature in
ourselves, and therefore, if we are consistent,
equally in others also."
We all see ourselves as "ends" due to our
rational capacities. ("End" here means for
the sake of which one acts. For instance, in a
football game, completing a pass is "a mean"
to get a touchdown, which is an "end"). Con
sequently, since I see myself as an end due to
my rational capacities, and since other peo
ple also employ the same rational capacities,
I must see also other persons as "ends," and
not as means. This constitutes Kant's Hu-
