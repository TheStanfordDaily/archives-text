## In terms of "in terms of"— Just say no 
### JAKE WACHMAN 
In terms of "in terms of," I just wanted to put this in
terms that you might understand. In terms of "in terms
of," everything is so much in terms of "in terms or these
days, that the terms have stopped making sense. "In
terms of this random idea," people often think, "this
other random thought fragment will sound relevant and
insightful." In terms of right and wrong, they are quite
often wrong.
"In terms of," I think, should be terminated.
In terms of time, at least this term and last term, the
use of "in terms or has gotten out of control. In terms
of historical perspective, "in terms or is the new "like"
— or, for the Northern Californians among us, the new
"hella." Except that this phrase is far more insidious in
terms of people so affected, having crept into the orato

ry of professors and students alike.
"In terms of office hours," I recently heard a teaching
assistant say, "they are from two until four." In terms of
better ways to express that same thought, he could have
said,"Office hours are from two until four."That would
have half as many words, four fewer syllables and a
much better sound to boot.
In terms of questions, how many times do you hear
"in terms of' each day? How many times do you your
self say it? Imagine a day without it. In terms of another
rhetorical question, would that be possible? Try it some
time. In terms of practice, it makes perfect.
May I also suggest, in terms of constructive criticism,
some additional ways to avoid the phrase. First, in terms
of things that are difficult to do: Speak in complete sen-
tences. Start with a subject, and
then a verb, and in terms of how
you finish it, an object. In real
terms, this might mean thinking be
fore you speak. In terms of the im
possible (though potentially de
lightful), for those especially afflict
ed by "in terms of," consider not
speaking at all.
In terms of Residential Educa
tion and coddling its undergradu
ates. Stanford should already have
a program for this.
But in terms of what you can do
right now to help. stop. Just stop.
