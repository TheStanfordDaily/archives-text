Health care costs overwhelm other
family-friendly benefits
I read with equal parts interest and incredulity
Ronald Chan's article on Stanford's attempts to meet the
needs of its graduate students who have children ("Spot
light on grad families," Oct. 12). Before we give Stanford
undue credit for being sensitive to these students' needs,
perhaps the University should revisit its policy of requir
ing graduate students with families to devote half of their
stipends to health insurance — approximately $890 per
month fora student, spouse and one child at the subsi
dized rate. Three years ago, Stanford attained national
notoriety for suggesting that its graduate students go on
public assistance to insure their families. Its new strategy
appears to be to drive them into bankruptcy instead.
Not exactly what I would call a family-friendly insti
tution.

American Indians need
more than a class
Regarding the recent article "Indian law class to be of
fered next semester" (Oct. 12), I ask. What good is an In
dian law class at Stanford, when out of every one hun
dred American Indian people who reach college age,
fewer than ten of them will ever graduate with a four
year degree?
Getting into college is tough, staying there is even
tougher and graduating from a prestigious university like
Stanford would take a miracle for the average American
Indian on the street.
The American Indians who have done all of the crow
ing lately about the Federal Indian Law class at Stanford
have lost sight of the struggle being waged by their own
people back home.
TTie Stanford students who are poised to take advan
tage of the new Indian law class represent only a minis-
cule fraction of the total Indian pop
ulation. They represent the extreme
ly fortunate few among us who just
happen to be at the right place at
precisely the right time in order to
take advantage of the privileges of
fered by the higher-education gravy
train.
But what about the rest of the

American Indian people? What
about the thousands of bright, de
serving young Indian men and
women still in high school who may
never have the chance to go to col
lege? These are the kinds of issues on
which we, as American Indians, need
to be directing our energies.
It is good that the Federal Indian
Law class may be offered at Stanford
in the near future. At the same time,
however, we must never forget the
following as a native people: There is
still plenty of suffering and sacrific
ing left to be done on the local level,

before the American Indian students
at Stanford ask the people still in the
trenches to celebrate their good for
tune with them.
I don't mean to bring the idea for
a federal Indian law class down, all I
am saying is give common sense a
chance. Statistically speaking, only a
small percentage of American Indi
ans will ever have a chance to par
take of the opportunity that this new
class offers.
