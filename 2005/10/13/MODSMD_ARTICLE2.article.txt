## Yom Kippur activities mark Day of Atonement 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
If the auditorium your 9 a.m. statistics lec
ture is held in seems a bit sparsely populated
today,don't worry — there's no killer flu bug
going around or some crazy party you
missed last night from which the rest of your
class is recovering. Instead, many students
are taking the day off from school today be
cause of Yom Kippur,one of the most impor
tant Jewish holidays of the year.
"Yom Kippur literally means 'Day of
Atonement,'" said Adina Danzig, executive
director of Hillel, the most prominent Jewish
student organization on campus. "It is a day
when [Jews] atone for wrongdoings, seek for
giveness from God and engage in self-reflec
tion that enables us to return to the sense of
self and purpose that guides our daily lives."
Yom Kippur traditionally falls 10 days
after Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the
10 Days of Awe, during which Jews reflect
upon themselves and ask forgiveness from
the people in their lives they may have
wronged.
"The liturgy emphasizes that prayer will
atone for sins between you and God, not sins
between you and other people," said sopho
more Annie Schiff, president of the Jewish
Leadership Council. "To repair other rela
tionships, one needs to apologize and seek
forgiveness."
Most consider Yom Kippur the most im
portant day of the Jewish year.
"Even Jews who are not observant or who
do not see themselves as religious often ob
serve Yom Kippur in some way, whether it is
refraining from regular work, fasting or re
flecting on the year past and their renewed
commitments for the year ahead," Danzig
said.
Fasting is a major part of the holiday —
Jews are expected to abstain from food from
sundown the day before Yom Kippur to sun
down on the actual day.They also try to keep
from doing any work, thus many students
will not be attending class today.
"This is the holiday Jewish students are
most likely to observe," Danzig said. "I know
it is challenging for the kids because they feel
the academic pressure here of missing class
es and that most of them would prefer if pro
fessors made it as easy as possible for them."
To take the place of classes, Hillel is or
ganizing many activities for participants in
the holiday. Last night a pre-fast dinner was
held at the Ziff Center for Jewish Life.
Evening services (called Kol Nidre) were
also held for three different groups — Re
form, Conservative and Orthodox Jews. Re
form Jewish services are being held in
Memorial Auditorium, while Conservative
Jewish services are in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. Hillel is partnering with Chabad and the
Jewish Study Network to offer Orthodox
services at other locations.
There will also be two services today for
each group, one in the morning (called
Shacharit) and one from the late afternoon
until Yom Kippur ends at sundown (called
Neilah). Between the two services today,
there will be discussion groups, class
es and workshops offered for stu
dents. At the conclusion of Yom Kip
pur, a break-fast dinner will be held,
also at Ziff.
"All of the services are open to
anyone," Schiff said. "In fact, many
community members attend our
services in addition to Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff."
Schiff said that the events Hillel is
holding for Yom Kippur will not be
very different from those last year.
"Yom Kippur is a very traditional
holiday, and the way it's observed at
Stanford doesn't change much from
year to year," she said. "The only
major change from last year is our
new building at the Ziff Center,
which makes the dinners feel much
more homey. Last year, dinners were
held in the ballroom at Old Union."
According to Schiff, Hillel publi
cizes the High Holidays (Rosh

Hashanah and Yom Kippur) togeth
er, since most students attend both.
This year, the events were an
nounced through mailings to new
students over the summer,
brochures at Hillel's kick-off barbe
cue, flyers at the Activities Fair and
handouts at the Ziff Center. E-mails
were also sent out through Jewish
list-serves and the complete holiday
schedule is available on Hillel's Web
site, http://hillel.stanford.edu.
This Yom Kippur will mark senior
Dina Wallin's last year celebrating
with Hillel at Stanford.
"1 really like Hillel services be
cause, even though a lot of people
from the greater community attend,
[the services] are really student
geared, with all of the readers being
Stanford students," she said. "It's a
lot more comfortable than custom
ary temple, where the majority of the
audience is adults, old people and
small children."
Wallin appreciates Yom Kippur
for the annual introspection it al
lows.
"Even though it's so somber, it's
one of my favorite holidays because

it really forces me to take a step back
and reflect on the past year — mis
takes I've made, things I've done that
weren't so nice and ways 1 can make
this year better," she said. "Fasting
and going to services helps to for
malize this reflection and makes it
real for me."
Sophomore Alina Lantsberg said
she values Yom Kippur greatly be
cause she feels a deep connection to
the holiday with the traditions and
meaning it holds for her.
"We always celebrated the holi
days at home, so the dinners are real
ly important to me because they are
so symbolic," Lantsberg said. "There
are a lot of customs that I miss being
away from my family for. But since
my parents never pushed me into
doing anything religious, although
they fasted as well, 1 feel like it was
my own personal choice, so I contin
ue doing it."
Wallin has only one regret about
celebrating Yom Kippur with Hillel
this year — that it will be her last.
"I love the community here," she
said. "I don't even want to think
about next Yom Kippur! Boo."

serve Yom Kippur in some way, whether it is
refraining from regular work, fasting or re
flecting on the year past and their renewed
commitments for the year ahead," Danzig
said.
Fasting is a major part of the holiday —
Jews are expected to abstain from food from
sundown the day before Yom Kippur to sun
down on the actual day.They also try to keep
from doing any work, thus many students
will not be attending class today.
"This is the holiday Jewish students are
most likely to observe," Danzig said. "I know
it is challenging for the kids because they feel
the academic pressure here of missing class
es and that most of them would prefer if pro
fessors made it as easy as possible for them."
To take the place of classes, Hillel is or
ganizing many activities for participants in
the holiday. Last night a pre-fast dinner was
held at the Ziff Center for Jewish Life.
Evening services (called Kol Nidre) were
also held for three different groups — Re
form, Conservative and Orthodox Jews. Re
form Jewish services are being held in
Memorial Auditorium, while Conservative
Jewish services are in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. Hillel is partnering with Chabad and the
Jewish Study Network to offer Orthodox
services at other locations.
There will also be two services today for
each group, one in the morning (called
Shacharit) and one from the late afternoon
until Yom Kippur ends at sundown (called
Neilah). Between the two services today,
there will be discussion groups, class
es and workshops offered for stu
dents. At the conclusion of Yom Kip
pur, a break-fast dinner will be held,
also at Ziff.
"All of the services are open to
anyone," Schiff said. "In fact, many
community members attend our
services in addition to Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff."
Schiff said that the events Hillel is
holding for Yom Kippur will not be
very different from those last year.
"Yom Kippur is a very traditional
holiday, and the way it's observed at
Stanford doesn't change much from
year to year," she said. "The only
major change from last year is our
new building at the Ziff Center,
which makes the dinners feel much
more homey. Last year, dinners were
held in the ballroom at Old Union."
According to Schiff, Hillel publi
cizes the High Holidays (Rosh

Hashanah and Yom Kippur) togeth
er, since most students attend both.
This year, the events were an
nounced through mailings to new
students over the summer,
brochures at Hillel's kick-off barbe
cue, flyers at the Activities Fair and
handouts at the Ziff Center. E-mails
were also sent out through Jewish
list-serves and the complete holiday
schedule is available on Hillel's Web
site, http://hillel.stanford.edu.
This Yom Kippur will mark senior
Dina Wallin's last year celebrating
with Hillel at Stanford.
"1 really like Hillel services be
cause, even though a lot of people
from the greater community attend,
[the services] are really student
geared, with all of the readers being
Stanford students," she said. "It's a
lot more comfortable than custom
ary temple, where the majority of the
audience is adults, old people and
small children."
Wallin appreciates Yom Kippur
for the annual introspection it al
lows.
"Even though it's so somber, it's
one of my favorite holidays because

it really forces me to take a step back
and reflect on the past year — mis
takes I've made, things I've done that
weren't so nice and ways 1 can make
this year better," she said. "Fasting
and going to services helps to for
malize this reflection and makes it
real for me."
Sophomore Alina Lantsberg said
she values Yom Kippur greatly be
cause she feels a deep connection to
the holiday with the traditions and
meaning it holds for her.
"We always celebrated the holi
days at home, so the dinners are real
ly important to me because they are
so symbolic," Lantsberg said. "There
are a lot of customs that I miss being
away from my family for. But since
my parents never pushed me into
doing anything religious, although
they fasted as well, 1 feel like it was
my own personal choice, so I contin
ue doing it."
Wallin has only one regret about
celebrating Yom Kippur with Hillel
this year — that it will be her last.
"I love the community here," she
said. "I don't even want to think
about next Yom Kippur! Boo."
If the auditorium your 9 a.m. statistics lec
ture is held in seems a bit sparsely populated
today,don't worry — there's no killer flu bug
going around or some crazy party you
missed last night from which the rest of your
class is recovering. Instead, many students
are taking the day off from school today be
cause of Yom Kippur,one of the most impor
tant Jewish holidays of the year.
"Yom Kippur literally means 'Day of
Atonement,'" said Adina Danzig, executive
director of Hillel, the most prominent Jewish
student organization on campus. "It is a day
when [Jews] atone for wrongdoings, seek for
giveness from God and engage in self-reflec
tion that enables us to return to the sense of
self and purpose that guides our daily lives."
Yom Kippur traditionally falls 10 days
after Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the
10 Days of Awe, during which Jews reflect
upon themselves and ask forgiveness from
the people in their lives they may have
wronged.
"The liturgy emphasizes that prayer will
atone for sins between you and God, not sins
between you and other people," said sopho
more Annie Schiff, president of the Jewish
Leadership Council. "To repair other rela
tionships, one needs to apologize and seek
forgiveness."
Most consider Yom Kippur the most im
portant day of the Jewish year.
"Even Jews who are not observant or who
do not see themselves as religious often ob
serve Yom Kippur in some way, whether it is
refraining from regular work, fasting or re
flecting on the year past and their renewed
