## Yom Kippur activities mark Day of Atonement 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
If the auditorium your 9 a.m. statistics lec
ture is held in seems a bit sparsely populated
today,don't worry — there's no killer flu bug
going around or some crazy party you
missed last night from which the rest of your
class is recovering. Instead, many students
are taking the day off from school today be
cause of Yom Kippur,one of the most impor
tant Jewish holidays of the year.
"Yom Kippur literally means 'Day of
Atonement,'" said Adina Danzig, executive
director of Hillel, the most prominent Jewish
student organization on campus. "It is a day
when [Jews] atone for wrongdoings, seek for
giveness from God and engage in self-reflec
tion that enables us to return to the sense of
self and purpose that guides our daily lives."
Yom Kippur traditionally falls 10 days
after Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the
10 Days of Awe, during which Jews reflect
upon themselves and ask forgiveness from
the people in their lives they may have
wronged.
"The liturgy emphasizes that prayer will
atone for sins between you and God, not sins
between you and other people," said sopho
more Annie Schiff, president of the Jewish
Leadership Council. "To repair other rela
tionships, one needs to apologize and seek
forgiveness."
Most consider Yom Kippur the most im
portant day of the Jewish year.
"Even Jews who are not observant or who
do not see themselves as religious often ob
serve Yom Kippur in some way, whether it is
refraining from regular work, fasting or re
flecting on the year past and their renewed
commitments for the year ahead," Danzig
said.
Fasting is a major part of the holiday —
Jews are expected to abstain from food from
sundown the day before Yom Kippur to sun
down on the actual day.They also try to keep
from doing any work, thus many students
will not be attending class today.
"This is the holiday Jewish students are
most likely to observe," Danzig said. "I know
it is challenging for the kids because they feel
the academic pressure here of missing class
es and that most of them would prefer if pro
fessors made it as easy as possible for them."
To take the place of classes, Hillel is or
ganizing many activities for participants in
the holiday. Last night a pre-fast dinner was
held at the Ziff Center for Jewish Life.
Evening services (called Kol Nidre) were
also held for three different groups — Re
form, Conservative and Orthodox Jews. Re
form Jewish services are being held in
Memorial Auditorium, while Conservative
Jewish services are in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. Hillel is partnering with Chabad and the
Jewish Study Network to offer Orthodox
services at other locations.
There will also be two services today for
each group, one in the morning (called
Shacharit) and one from the late afternoon
until Yom Kippur ends at sundown (called
Neilah). Between the two services today,
