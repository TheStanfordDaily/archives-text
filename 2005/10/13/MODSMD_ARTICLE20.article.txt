## Swimmers begin year against Huskies Team hopes to earn 25th straight Pac-10 championship 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES 
In the upcoming season that kicks off
tomorrow, the Stanford men's swimming
squad is hoping to continue its run of 24
consecutive Pacific-10 Conference cham
pionships, while its diving counterpoint
hopes to begin its own successful streak
with new talent.
"Our team goals revolve around keep
ing our streak alive and winning NCAAs,"
junior swimming captain Ben Wildman-
Tobriner said.
Last year, the NCAA Championships
eluded the Cardinal, and they placed sec
ond to Auburn. With the longest champi
onship streak of any team in any sport in
Pac-10 history, not being able to conquer
the NCAA Championship was frustrat
ing.
But, changing those future results
aren't the only thing on the teams mind as
it begins the season.
"As is the case with every season, this
year's team is beginning to form its own
identity," Wildman-Tobriner said. "Out of
the 27 swimmers on this year's roster, 11 of
them are freshmen. With such a large
number of freshmen, the team has incred
ible potential for growth and improve
ment."
Wildman-Tobriner found room for im
provements of his own over the summer,
after competing in the World Champi
onships in August. There, he helped the
U.S. team toward a gold medal in the 400-
meter freestyle relay, but took third in the
50 and 100 free trials.
"I was a little disappointed with my
performance at the World Champi
onships," he said. "I felt that I was pre
pared to swim faster than I did. Nonethe
less, going to the meet itself provided in
valuable experience at the highest level of
the sport. I think what I learned showed it
self immediately at the Summer Nation
als."
At the ConocoPhillips Summer Senior
National Championships in August, Wild
man-Tobriner placed fifth in the 100 free
with a time of 53.52 seconds. He also
earned first in the 50 free, defeating world
champion Roland Schoeman and captur
ing his first career national title with a per
sonal best, 22.13.

"I was much happier about my show
ing at that meet," Wildman-Tobriner said.
"I want to stay confident and carry my
momentum right over into this NCAA
season."
For this season, he hopes to win an
NCAA Championship and break the
American record of 21.76 for the 50 free,
held by Gary Hall, Jr. Wildman-Tobriner's
opportunities for success, as well as the
opportunities for his team and its fresh
men, begin tomorrow in a meet at Wash
ington.
"This Friday's meet will be the first col
legiate dual meet for our freshmen — a
potentially nerve-racking experience,"
Wildman-Tobriner said. "My expectations
are for us to learn from our races, to have
fun and to start off our season strongly.

This meet really isn't about the times —
it's about getting used to swimming in col
lege."
Two members of the men's diving team
are also working on the transition to col
lege competition — freshmen Dwight
Dumais and Casey Weston. Along with
junior Kevin McLean and sophomore
Nathan Kim, they make up the four mem
ber team.
"Our goals are the highest they've ever
been and we expect big things." head
coach Rick Schavone said.
Schavone hopes to see a Pac-10 title
for his squad and hopes to have at least
two individuals qualify for the NCAA
Championships. Much of this optimism
stems from the young talent of Dumais
and Weston.

Dumais comes from a diving family
and is the top recruit in the country, ac
cording to Schavone, and the Ventura,
Calif., native is one to watch, as he is ex
pected to step up his diving his rookie
year.
On the other hand, Weston is a walk-on
but he is turning into a huge surprise for
Schavone.
"1 le's definitely going to make a major
contribution on the Pac-10 level." he said.
"I'm ecstatic at his present level of ability
and I think he'll do well this year."
Coming off a good year, Kim and
McLean should also be very competitive
in the Pac-10, Schavone said.
The divers' season begins with the Big
West Shootout in Irvine. Calif., Nov. 4
and 5.
