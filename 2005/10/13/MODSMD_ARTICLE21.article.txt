# Volleyball heads for desert to face No. 12 Wildcats
## Arizona currently undefeated in Pacific-10 contests at its homey the McKale Center, in Tucson 
### ANDREW LOMELI 
Monday afternoon's practice for
the No. 3 Stanford women's volley
ball team was unlike any the team
had experienced all season. Coming
into their first practice after falling to
No. 2 Washington last Saturday, the
Cardinal had an extra chip on their
shoulder. Stanford had fought re
siliently through the first three
games against the Huskies before
suffering a disappointing 30-15 loss
in game four.
The 15-point collapse ended one
of the season's most anticipated
matches, a possible NCAA Champi
onship preview, as well as the Cardi-

nal's 15-match
winning streak.
But Stanford
(16-2, 5-1 Pacific
10 Conference)
has no choice but
to look ahead as
the team travels
toTUcson tonight
to battle No. 12
Arizona (12-2,4-
1) at 7 p.m.
"Losing is a
great motiva-

tor," head coach
John Dunning said. "If you don't
take it that way, then you're never
going to get where you want to be.
We're not worrying about the past.
We're looking ahead now."
The Cardinal have won every
meeting against the Wildcats since
2002. One perfect record looks to
vanish; Stanford is undefeated on the
road, while Arizona remains flawless
at the McKale Center thus far in the
Pac-10 season.
The Wildcats hit .310 in their most
recent victory, a sweep against rival
Arizona State last Friday. Arizona
collected 10 blocks and held the Sun
Devils to an abysmal .099 hitting per
centage. For the season, the Wildcats
are hitting .287 with more than 15
kills per game.
Arizona's Kim Glass, a senior out
side hitter, is registering 4.62 kills per
game while hitting .267. Senior out
side hitter Jennifer Abernathy helps
to reinforce the offense with about
four kills per game. The two seniors

"Losing is something
you need to have an
emotional response to,
but we need to be
rational "
— John Dunning
head coach

each recorded a double-double in
the ASU contest.
Glass and Abernathy are also
threats on the other side of the net,
each averaging above three digs per
game.The Wildcats' freshman libero,
Brittany Leonard, adds 3.51 digs per
game. As a team, Arizona averages
2.84 blocks and 15 digs per game.
Stanford counters with a .288 hit
ting percentage. Freshman middle
blocker Foluke Akinradewo plans
to ride the momentum of a career
high 20 kills in the Washington
match. Led by senior libero Court
ney Schultz — who has just under
four digs per game — the Cardinal
defense is averaging nearly 17 digs

per match.
Dunning said
his squad has fo
cused on blocking,
serving and pass
ing, which will all
be critical skills
against the Wild
cats.
"Arizona is a
very physical team,"
he said. "Three of
their best players
are seniors who
have had success

there, though not as much as they wish.
This year is their last chance. So Ari
zona is going to be tough, partly be
cause they're more motivated than
they have to be."
Dunning said the Washington loss
has not led to a loss of confidence for
the Cardinal. Rather, the athletes
have learned a valuable lesson that
may come in handy in the likely cir
cumstance that the Cardinal meet
the Huskies again in the NCAA
Tournament.
"Losing is something you need to
have an emotional response to, but
we need to be rational," Dunning
said. "Washington didn't get what
they wanted when we beat them in
the Final Four last year, so they were
hungry to beat us."
"The freshmen now know more
about college play," he added. "I
could have told them how great
Washington was, but they really
don't know how good the team is
until they play them."
