# What you can tell at football's midseason
## 
### 
With half of the college football season in
the books, the sporting public can begin
to draw some conclusions — and begin to
plan which teams might be traveling to bowl
games.
The first thing that becomes apparent is that the
Year of the Little Guys is long gone. Last season,
two teams outside of the Bowl Championship Se
ries conferences (Utah and Boise State) had unde
feated regular seasons and a third (Louisville)
could make a strong argument that it was better
than Pitt, the Big East's BCS representative.
This year, all the wannabe BCS-busters were
out of the race before September ended. TCU
scored a big win at Oklahoma, which had an unde
feated regular season in 2004, but then lost to
doormat Southern Methodist. Utah, Bowling
Green and Boise State made like the European
ruling dynasties after World War I and fell flat on
their faces as well.
There haven't even been any good games of un
derappreciated teams taking down powerhouses
who overlooked them. The only contest that has
come close is Stanford's home loss to Division l-
AA UC-Davis, which was called by Sports Illustrat
ed's Stewart Mandel "the most baffling score of the
season." A former Cardinal player was more direct,
saying the loss was"the most *bleeping* embar
rassing * bleep* in the history of sport."
The media has quite a gaffe to explain them
selves, after predicting the Big Ten would be top
heavy with Ohio State, Michigan, lowa and Pur
due. The four teams are a combined 12-10, with all
of them looking downright pitiful at various points
in the season and their supposed superstars disap
pearing for games at a time.
Another storyline has been the resurgence of
old — as in early 1980's — powers. Notre Dame
had downright sucked every other year since Lou
Holtz's departure in 1996, but new coach Charlie
Weis has the Fighting Irish playing like a confident,
complete top-10 team. (And the Domers said Ty
rone Willingham couldn't recruit.)
Further east, Penn State and Alabama still wear
the same uniform styles from their heydays.
They're playing like it too. It makes me want to
break out my LP of Michael Jackson's "Thriller."
Penn State entered the Top 10 after out
muscling Ohio State last weekend, with the Beaver
Stadium student section numbering a reported
20,000. Forty-year-tenured Nittany Lion coach Joe
Paterno, who many said was washed out, showed
he can still coach 'em up. He deployed a modern
and dynamic offense with some sensational fresh
men ballcarriers and a defense with toughness
we've come to expect from the sons of Pennsylva
nia.
When reporter Lynn Swann asked Joe Pa if he
was "comfortable playing all these freshmen," Pa
terno, caught off-guard, laughed and said "Not re
ally! But they're the best I got."
The Southeastern Conference champion is au
tomatically berthed to the Sugar Bowl (played in
Atlanta this season due to Hurricane Katrina's
damage to the Superdome.)The Rose Bowl is des
ignated for the "National Championship" game, so
the Big Ten champion will likely not be going to the
Granddaddy.
Here's hoping fora Sugar Bowl rematch of the
1979 classic between Alabama and Penn State, one
of the great games in college football history. With
the game tense in the closing minutes, coach Bear
Bryant's defense stopped Penn State tailback Matt
Guman on fourth and goal inside the one, giving
the Tide the ball, the 14-7 win and the national
championship.
Something tells me neither of those teams in
2005 would mind putting the pads to one another.
And down in our neck of the woods, the Pac-10
looks like two different conferences — there are
five strong teams and five teams with more ques
tions than answers (Unfortunately, Stanford ap
pears to be in the latter half.)
UCLA coach Karl Dorrell had been chided for
underachievement — especially after losing to a
6-5 Wyoming team in a bowl game, but the Bruins
look like they are playing with purpose. Bruin tail
back Maurice Drew and Reggie Bush, the multi
threat sparkplug for top-ranked USC, head a sta
ble of electrifying West Coast running backs. It re
mains to be seen who will make it out alive but the
shakeout will not be without smoke and fire.
In short, the weak teams are weak this season
and the strong teams look really strong. That's bad
news for most fans, since disappointment might
abound for those outside the top 10.
But for those who appreciate the game of col
lege football, buy some cold ones because there
is going to be some serious head-butting before
the season is over. And who's to say lowly teams
won't throw a few monkey-wrenches on Rivalry
Weekend?
Stanford plays Cal and Notre Dame back-to
back in November. It sure would be nice to mess up
the latters' dream seasons. It may be a year for the
Goliaths. but if you're carrying a slingshot, you at
least have to believe.
