# Rugby kicks off 2005-06
## Women seek preseason competition from squads at Chico, Berkeley 
### TERESA MOLINA 
Last year, rugby coach Jonathan Griffin man
aged to achieve in four months what most coach
es don't achieve in a lifetime. After arriving at
Stanford in January to coach the women's rugby
team, he succeeded in leading the squad to the
national championship title by the end of April.
And now, with a new team to organize, games to
win and a title to defend. Griffin looks forward to
a year that promises excitement and victory.
Since its founding in 1976, the Stanford
women's rugby team has had its share of success.
The squad has reached the Final Four six times
since 1992 and went on to claim the national title
for the first time in 1999.
While women's rugby is not a varsity sport at
the moment, this could change in the next
decade, as it is currently on the NCAA list of
emerging varsity sports.
The team's status as a club sport doesn't fool
anyone, though. The girls sweat bullets year
round — practice begins in the first month of fall
quarter even though competitive league play
doesn't begin until after winter break.
Rigorous preseason competition should be
more than enough to keep this team busy during
the months ahead. While Stanford won't be fac
ing any rivals from its league, the ladies have no
trouble finding good competition elsewhere.
In addition to matches against the Bay Area
She Hawks rugby club and the senior women's
teams from CSU-Chico and California, presea
son games against Stanford alumni are also
scheduled. Alumni teams in the past have proved
to be tough opponents, which shouldn't come as
a surprise considering that many alumni have
played rugby at the international level after
graduating from the Farm.
Last Thursday's practice was the first of the
year for returnees, many of whom have been
training diligently over the summer. For some,
this meant individual physical conditioning and
for others, participation in regional or national

seven-a-side rugby competitions.
"The returnees are very enthusiastic, and they
look really good," Griffin said. "All of them
worked hard over the summer, and the benefits
are definitely showing."
Griffin — "Griff' to his players — began his
career as a Stanford rugby coach last January,
right before the women's competitive league
play kicked off. Before then, he was working with
the formidable rugby teams of Loughborough
University, which has proud claim to one of the
most successful athletic programs in Britain.
Perhaps the key to Griffin's success lies in his
years of experience, not only as a coach but also
as a serious rugby player. He has actively partic
ipated in high-level rugby competition ever since
his years as a student. He quit only three years
ago, after a career that included seven seasons as
a semi-professional athlete in the years before
rugby became a professional sport in Britain.
Now entering his ninth year of coaching, Grif
fin is extremely confident about the Stanford
women's squad. Admittedly, some adjustments
are necessary, as the squad has lost three of its
starters from last year's national champion team.
Griffin mentioned graduate and former co-pres
ident Katie Hills in particular, describing her as
an "incredible person" who will be especially dif
ficult to "try and replace as a character."
While Griffin does not plan to make any dras
tic changes to the currently thriving rugby pro
gram, he made it clear that in terms of team strat
egy, some alterations have to be made.
"We need to modify how we play to keep two
steps ahead of the opponent," he said. "As the
team naturally evolves, it makes the game more
exciting."
When asked about which teams he antici
pates to be Stanford's main competition this
year, Griffin named Penn State, Virginia and
Princeton, but also pointed out that any team
could take this role. Only seven months can re
veal who can put up a fight against the solid Stan
ford team.
But until then, keep an eye open for this squad
of committed and talented female athletes as
they start off a year that, according to Griffin,
"could be more exciting than last year.The enthu
siasm emanating from April's victorious finale
and the determination to defend a title are sure to
push Stanford women's rugby to new heights.
