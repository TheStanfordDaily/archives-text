# Conference leader OSU rolls onto Farm
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Maloney Field gets a unique glimpse
into the possible future of the Stanford
men's soccer program when one of the na
tion's hottest teams, Oregon State (7-2-4,
3-0-0 Pacific-10 Conference), arrives on
the Farm.The Beavers, who reloaded with
a talented recruiting class and missed the
NCAA Tournament last year, have ma
tured and are currently on a 10-game win
streak, including three straight wins over
ranked conference opponents.
Meanwhile, the Stanford men (3-6-2,0-
2-1), who so far have struggled with their
youth, strive fora similar breakout in the
near future — hopefully, this weekend.
"OSU had a very young team last year
that was very close to winning a lot of
games but didn't get the results because
they needed experience," Stanford head
coach Bret Simon said. "To some extent. I
think I see some of the same things with us
this year. Oregon State made a good jump
this season, and I think that their success is
very legitimate."
The Cardinal's first scheduled oppo
nent of the weekend, however, is Washing
ton (6-3-1,0-2-I).The Huskies are limping
into the match on a three-game skid and
currently share the conference cellar with
Stanford despite coming into the season
highly-touted as a Pac-10 title contender.
"Washington has had trouble scoring
in the last couple games," Simon said. "I'm
sure their emphasis in practice has been to
create more chances and score more

goals. That may mean moving a few play
ers around or pressing more players for
ward or just trying to be a little hit sharp
er."
Despite the recent struggles, the Husky
squad that plans to take the field on Friday
night at 7 p.m. is still loaded with a lot of
the talent from a year ago, including last
year's Pac-10 newcomer of the year, soph
omore forward Ely Allen. Scouting re
ports point to the Huskies defensive play
and their ability to pass effectively as
strengths — a report which is very similar
to the way teams described No. 15 Califor
nia (8-2-1,1-2-0), whom the Cardinal lost
to last weekend.
Oregon State, the conference's top
team, is then scheduled to play Sunday af
ternoon at 1 p.m. The Beavers are led by
their dynamic forward duo made up by
senior Robbie Findley and junior Ryan
Johnson. Both are extremely versatile and
athletic players and can generate offense
not only for themselves, but also for their
teammates.
Also key to the Beavers' success has
been the play of their freshman goalkeep
er and Pac-10 player of the week, Packy
Deenihan, along with the team's flexibility
to play multiple formations and styles.The
team has been switching formations re
peatedly, sometimes on a game-to-game
basis.
In preparation for their opponents.
Cardinal practices have changed focus
this week from the attacking zone to de
fensive organization and discipline. In last
week's loss, Stanford played a stretched

out defense that negated the speed of the
Cal forwards but opened up the Bears'
passing game, and that ultimately proved
to be the difference. This weekend. Stan
ford faces both an athletic attack in Ore
gon State and a passing attack in Washing
ton, so training has concentrated on when
to play tight defense and when to play
with depth.
"You really play into any team's hands
when you allow the space [in the defensive
half] to be that big," Simon said. "It's just
too much room to play, and a good team
will be able to take you apart and get good
chances."
While ironing out its strategy, the team
got a morale boost yesterday when fresh
man T.J. Novak returned from the hospital
to watch practice after surgery on his bro
ken right leg. Novak was injured in a
freakish play last weekend. The total re
covery time until he can run again is pre
dicted to be 10 to 14 weeks. Until then, his
presence on the sideline should help gal
vanize the squad.
"The whole team's been great to me,"
Novak said."lf the injury is what it takes
and we start winning some games, then
that's great to get something positive
out of it. I think we'll bounce back for
sure. Our team has so many good play
ers that hopefully we can muster up
some wins."
With one of their rising players gone for
the season, the Cardinal again face a steep
learning curve this weekend and are ready
to see whether they can seize their future
sooner rather than later.
