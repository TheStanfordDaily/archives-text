# Old Union ready to start renovations
## Student groups temporarily displaced 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
You probably can't tell by walk
ing or biking through White Plaza
today, but work is set to begin on
the $24 million Old Union facelift.
The construction project to convert
the current administrative and stu
dent center into a student hub is
still on schedule and is expected to
be finished when classes begin next
fall.
The Old Union conversion proj
ect has already led to the permanent
relocation of the Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Office to its new home in
the Bakewell Building. The project
will also temporarily displace nu
merous student organizations in
cluding the Asian American Activi
ties Center, the Native American
Cultural Center and El Centro Chi
cano, all of which are currently locat
ed in Old Union. These groups will
soon be housed in modulars in the
parking lot near the Black Commu
nity Services Center on Santa Teresa
Street.
Despite the temporary moves
that some groups and organizations
will face, ASSU President and senior
Melanie Kannokada said that stu
dent reaction to the project has been
largely encouraging.
"Generally there has been a lot of
positive feedback," Kannokada said.
"The student groups that will be dis
placed have been consulted and they
are willing to sacrifice the time in the
modulars fora greater venue in
which they can meet and practice."
Kannokada also added that the
Old Union project has not worsened
past issues of student space and that
all current occupants of Old Union
should be moved out by the end of
December when construction be
gins.
According to the Interim Dean of
Student Affairs Greg Boardman, the
purpose for the late fall construction
startup was to limit the inconven
ience faced by Old Union staff and
student groups.
"We wanted to avoid moving
them in the beginning of the aca
demic year," he said.

Boardman is also tackling the
issue of what to do with the open
space in Tresidder Union that will
exist once the ASSU and Office of
Student Activities move to Old
Union next fall.
"I have asked a consultant who
has studied many campus unions to
help us begin the process of deciding
how Tresidder might change with the
new space," he said.
Students may be able to get in
volved in this conversation as soon
as Wednesday, Oct. 26 when the stu
dent space consultant will hold sev
eral focus groups with current Old
Union occupants.
"There will certainly be many op
portunities for student involvement
and input but it would be very help
ful to get a good student turnout for
the focus groups." Boardman said.
ASSU Senator Vang Kou Khang,
a sophomore, agreed with the need
for student involvement in the Old
Union project and Tresidder space
issues, adding that the Senate is al
ready taking actions to contact
group leaders.
"We will be e-mailing club lead

ers to see if they have interest in the
new space that will be created in
Tresidderhe said. "I'm advocating
for more student space and as soon
as we know more about specific
plans we will contact all of them."
One organization that looks for
ward to the completion of the Old
Union project is the Office for Reli
gious Life and Stanford Associated
Religions. Dean for Religious Life
Scotty McLennan expressed his in
terest in the project that is taking
place.
"All of us at the Office for Reli
gious Life are very excited by this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
develop a new interfaith center on
the third floor of Old Union," he
said. "At a time when religious dis
sension seems to be behind many of
the world's problems, we want to see
Stanford students graduate with
deep, respectful understanding of
each others' traditions, both reli
gious and secular. We hope pro
gramming together and rubbing el
bows in the new interfaith center
will go a long way toward achieving
that goal."

Student groups, administrators look forward to finding a remodeled home in
Old Union sometime by the start of the next academic year.
You probably can't tell by walk
ing or biking through White Plaza
today, but work is set to begin on
the $24 million Old Union facelift.
The construction project to convert
the current administrative and stu
dent center into a student hub is
still on schedule and is expected to
be finished when classes begin next
fall.
The Old Union conversion proj
ect has already led to the permanent
relocation of the Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Office to its new home in
the Bakewell Building. The project
will also temporarily displace nu
merous student organizations in
cluding the Asian American Activi
ties Center, the Native American
Cultural Center and El Centro Chi
cano, all of which are currently locat
ed in Old Union. These groups will
soon be housed in modulars in the
parking lot near the Black Commu
nity Services Center on Santa Teresa
Street.
Despite the temporary moves
that some groups and organizations
will face, ASSU President and senior
Melanie Kannokada said that stu
dent reaction to the project has been
largely encouraging.
"Generally there has been a lot of
positive feedback," Kannokada said.
"The student groups that will be dis
placed have been consulted and they
are willing to sacrifice the time in the
modulars fora greater venue in
which they can meet and practice."
Kannokada also added that the
Old Union project has not worsened
past issues of student space and that
all current occupants of Old Union
should be moved out by the end of
December when construction be
gins.
According to the Interim Dean of
Student Affairs Greg Boardman, the
purpose for the late fall construction
startup was to limit the inconven
ience faced by Old Union staff and
student groups.
"We wanted to avoid moving
them in the beginning of the aca
demic year," he said.

Boardman is also tackling the
issue of what to do with the open
space in Tresidder Union that will
exist once the ASSU and Office of
Student Activities move to Old
Union next fall.
"I have asked a consultant who
has studied many campus unions to
help us begin the process of deciding
how Tresidder might change with the
new space," he said.
Students may be able to get in
volved in this conversation as soon
as Wednesday, Oct. 26 when the stu
dent space consultant will hold sev
eral focus groups with current Old
Union occupants.
"There will certainly be many op
portunities for student involvement
and input but it would be very help
ful to get a good student turnout for
the focus groups." Boardman said.
ASSU Senator Vang Kou Khang,
a sophomore, agreed with the need
for student involvement in the Old
Union project and Tresidder space
issues, adding that the Senate is al
ready taking actions to contact
group leaders.
"We will be e-mailing club lead

ers to see if they have interest in the
new space that will be created in
Tresidderhe said. "I'm advocating
for more student space and as soon
as we know more about specific
plans we will contact all of them."
One organization that looks for
ward to the completion of the Old
Union project is the Office for Reli
gious Life and Stanford Associated
Religions. Dean for Religious Life
Scotty McLennan expressed his in
terest in the project that is taking
place.
"All of us at the Office for Reli
gious Life are very excited by this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
develop a new interfaith center on
the third floor of Old Union," he
said. "At a time when religious dis
sension seems to be behind many of
the world's problems, we want to see
Stanford students graduate with
deep, respectful understanding of
each others' traditions, both reli
gious and secular. We hope pro
gramming together and rubbing el
bows in the new interfaith center
will go a long way toward achieving
that goal."
