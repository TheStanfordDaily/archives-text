## Four Seasons brings luxury to E. Palo Alto At least 270 new jobs expected for local population 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was a visual oxymoron — a luxury hotel blanketed
with dust, wood planks and wet paint. But it was to be ex
pected,since the hotel was still under construction. In a few
months' time, the contradiction will become a thing of the
past.
Perhaps the bigger irony, though, was the setting — a
luxury hotel located in East Palo Alto, an underprivileged
community almost hidden by its glamorous Silicon Valley
neighbors. But that paradox, too, will hopefully become
obsolete — not in a few months' time, but soon.
The upscale Four Seasons Hotel, sitting centrally in
East Palo Alto's University Circle complexes at the heart
of a redevelopment effort aimed to revitalize a neglected
city that has long been known for its crime.
The Four Seasons, renowned amongst corporate busi
ness travelers for its unrivaled level of services and atten
tion to detail, truly extended its warm welcome to guests
before it was even open.
As this reporter and a photographer approached the
entrance to the construction site fora tour and an inter
view, two hotel representatives were already waiting in
earnest for our arrival. After the customary greetings and
handshakes, one of them presented to us a white, nicely
decorated paper bag imprinted with the logo of Four Sea
sons.
"We brought you two bottles of water," said Pamela
Hild, the hotel's director of marketing."Just in case you get
thirsty."
When completed in early 2006, this 190,000-square
foot, 10-story building will become what Hild called "the
first full-service luxury hotel in the area." No other hotels
in the vicinity can tout the provision of facilities like a 24-
hour concierge, a rooftop lap pool and spas for men and
women, she said.
On the outside, the curved glass facade, covering all 10
stories, fits elegantly into Silicon Valley's sleek design. Not
unlike the Palm Drive at Stanford, the hotel's external
boulevard will be guarded by palm trees on the sides and
dead end at an oval fountain where guests will find atten
dants ready to offer assistance with their luggage.
Inside, each of the 200 guest rooms will feature a host of
facilities designed to keep the technology-sawy bunch
busy and productive: two flat-screen televisions — one in
the bedroom, one in the bathroom — a DVD/CD player,
high speed Internet connection and, with those floor-to
ceiling windows, unblocked views of nearby neighbor
hoods, mountains and even the San Francisco Bay.
For most ordinary folks, particularly students, spending
a night at the Four Seasons is no doubt far beyond their fi-

nancial reach. But Hild noted the
hotel's target customers include not
only the hundreds of thousands of Sil
icon Valley visitors every year,but also
residents of nearby communities who
desire an occasional weekend get
away.
"We'll certainly work with the
communities here to see how we can
accommodate local events," she said.
"And Stanford is the driver of many of
those events."
City officials in East Palo Alto are
already thrilled to see the potential
economic benefits of this multimil
lion-dollar project, a major element of
the local government's plan to rein
vent the city. It is estimated that the
Four Seasons will eventually become
East Palo Alto's largest revenue gen
erator, adding more than $3 million to
the treasury every year in occupancy
tax alone.

At a minimum, the five-star hotel
will generate some 270 new jobs,
most of which will be hired locally.
There will be myriad career opportu
nities for workers with little skill as
well as college graduates and senior
managers.
According to Jeff Knollmiller, a
public relations representative for
the hotel, the average salary offered
by the Four Seasons is probably the
highest in the city.
When the hotel and the city's rede
velopment agency jointly heid infor
mation sessions back in August, more
than 30() residents attended, inquiring
about potential employment oppor
tunities.
To fully reap the benefit that re
sults from the establishment of Tour
Seasons, East Palo Alto has launched
an initiative through the redevelop
ment agency.The "First Source Hiring
Program" was set up to ensure that
East Palo Alto residents have the best
advantage for the new jobs created by
Four Seasons.
Last month, 22 year old Jannie
Parker who has lived in East Palo Alto

her entire life, became the first city
resident hired by the hotel through
the initiative.
"I first learned about plans for the
hotel years ago from my mother, who
worked for the city," Parker said, now
the sales administrator at Four Sea
sons. "After 1 graduated from Menlo-
Atherton High School, while working
at other hotels, I followed the progress
and made up my mind that 1 would
land a job with Four Seasons in my
hometown."
The extent to which the luxury
hotel will revive East Palo Alto will re
main unclear until it officially opens
next year. At the very least, however,
the construction of the Four Seasons
represents progress toward greater
economic vitality — and, perhaps
more importantly, a whole new way
for outsiders to perceive the city of
East Palo Alto.
"The hotel is really the crown
jewel of the redevelopment proj
ect," Knollmiller said. "Its exciting
to be a part of that effort, and we
look forward to helping the local
community."

jewel of the redevelopment proj

to be a part of that effort, and we
look forward to helping the local
community."
It was a visual oxymoron — a luxury hotel blanketed
with dust, wood planks and wet paint. But it was to be ex
pected,since the hotel was still under construction. In a few
months' time, the contradiction will become a thing of the
past.
Perhaps the bigger irony, though, was the setting — a
luxury hotel located in East Palo Alto, an underprivileged
community almost hidden by its glamorous Silicon Valley
neighbors. But that paradox, too, will hopefully become
obsolete — not in a few months' time, but soon.
The upscale Four Seasons Hotel, sitting centrally in
East Palo Alto's University Circle complexes at the heart
of a redevelopment effort aimed to revitalize a neglected
city that has long been known for its crime.
The Four Seasons, renowned amongst corporate busi
ness travelers for its unrivaled level of services and atten
tion to detail, truly extended its warm welcome to guests
before it was even open.
As this reporter and a photographer approached the
entrance to the construction site fora tour and an inter
view, two hotel representatives were already waiting in
earnest for our arrival. After the customary greetings and
handshakes, one of them presented to us a white, nicely
decorated paper bag imprinted with the logo of Four Sea
sons.
"We brought you two bottles of water," said Pamela
Hild, the hotel's director of marketing."Just in case you get
thirsty."
When completed in early 2006, this 190,000-square
foot, 10-story building will become what Hild called "the
first full-service luxury hotel in the area." No other hotels
in the vicinity can tout the provision of facilities like a 24-
hour concierge, a rooftop lap pool and spas for men and
women, she said.
On the outside, the curved glass facade, covering all 10
stories, fits elegantly into Silicon Valley's sleek design. Not
unlike the Palm Drive at Stanford, the hotel's external
boulevard will be guarded by palm trees on the sides and
dead end at an oval fountain where guests will find atten
dants ready to offer assistance with their luggage.
Inside, each of the 200 guest rooms will feature a host of
facilities designed to keep the technology-sawy bunch
busy and productive: two flat-screen televisions — one in
the bedroom, one in the bathroom — a DVD/CD player,
high speed Internet connection and, with those floor-to
ceiling windows, unblocked views of nearby neighbor
hoods, mountains and even the San Francisco Bay.
For most ordinary folks, particularly students, spending
a night at the Four Seasons is no doubt far beyond their fi-

nancial reach. But Hild noted the
hotel's target customers include not
only the hundreds of thousands of Sil
icon Valley visitors every year,but also
residents of nearby communities who
desire an occasional weekend get
away.
"We'll certainly work with the
communities here to see how we can
accommodate local events," she said.
"And Stanford is the driver of many of
those events."
City officials in East Palo Alto are
already thrilled to see the potential
economic benefits of this multimil
lion-dollar project, a major element of
the local government's plan to rein
vent the city. It is estimated that the
Four Seasons will eventually become
East Palo Alto's largest revenue gen
erator, adding more than $3 million to
the treasury every year in occupancy
tax alone.

At a minimum, the five-star hotel
will generate some 270 new jobs,
most of which will be hired locally.
There will be myriad career opportu
nities for workers with little skill as
well as college graduates and senior
managers.
According to Jeff Knollmiller, a
public relations representative for
the hotel, the average salary offered
by the Four Seasons is probably the
highest in the city.
When the hotel and the city's rede
velopment agency jointly heid infor
mation sessions back in August, more
than 30() residents attended, inquiring
about potential employment oppor
tunities.
To fully reap the benefit that re
sults from the establishment of Tour
Seasons, East Palo Alto has launched
an initiative through the redevelop
ment agency.The "First Source Hiring
Program" was set up to ensure that
East Palo Alto residents have the best
advantage for the new jobs created by
Four Seasons.
Last month, 22 year old Jannie
Parker who has lived in East Palo Alto

her entire life, became the first city
resident hired by the hotel through
the initiative.
"I first learned about plans for the
hotel years ago from my mother, who
worked for the city," Parker said, now
the sales administrator at Four Sea
sons. "After 1 graduated from Menlo-
Atherton High School, while working
at other hotels, I followed the progress
and made up my mind that 1 would
land a job with Four Seasons in my
hometown."
The extent to which the luxury
hotel will revive East Palo Alto will re
main unclear until it officially opens
next year. At the very least, however,
the construction of the Four Seasons
represents progress toward greater
economic vitality — and, perhaps
more importantly, a whole new way
for outsiders to perceive the city of
East Palo Alto.
