## Four Seasons brings luxury to E. Palo Alto At least 270 new jobs expected for local population 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was a visual oxymoron — a luxury hotel blanketed
with dust, wood planks and wet paint. But it was to be ex
pected,since the hotel was still under construction. In a few
months' time, the contradiction will become a thing of the
past.
Perhaps the bigger irony, though, was the setting — a
luxury hotel located in East Palo Alto, an underprivileged
community almost hidden by its glamorous Silicon Valley
neighbors. But that paradox, too, will hopefully become
obsolete — not in a few months' time, but soon.
The upscale Four Seasons Hotel, sitting centrally in
East Palo Alto's University Circle complexes at the heart
of a redevelopment effort aimed to revitalize a neglected
city that has long been known for its crime.
The Four Seasons, renowned amongst corporate busi
ness travelers for its unrivaled level of services and atten
tion to detail, truly extended its warm welcome to guests
before it was even open.
As this reporter and a photographer approached the
entrance to the construction site fora tour and an inter
view, two hotel representatives were already waiting in
earnest for our arrival. After the customary greetings and
handshakes, one of them presented to us a white, nicely
decorated paper bag imprinted with the logo of Four Sea
sons.
"We brought you two bottles of water," said Pamela
Hild, the hotel's director of marketing."Just in case you get
thirsty."
When completed in early 2006, this 190,000-square
foot, 10-story building will become what Hild called "the
first full-service luxury hotel in the area." No other hotels
in the vicinity can tout the provision of facilities like a 24-
hour concierge, a rooftop lap pool and spas for men and
women, she said.
On the outside, the curved glass facade, covering all 10
stories, fits elegantly into Silicon Valley's sleek design. Not
unlike the Palm Drive at Stanford, the hotel's external
boulevard will be guarded by palm trees on the sides and
dead end at an oval fountain where guests will find atten
dants ready to offer assistance with their luggage.
Inside, each of the 200 guest rooms will feature a host of
facilities designed to keep the technology-sawy bunch
busy and productive: two flat-screen televisions — one in
the bedroom, one in the bathroom — a DVD/CD player,
high speed Internet connection and, with those floor-to
ceiling windows, unblocked views of nearby neighbor
hoods, mountains and even the San Francisco Bay.
For most ordinary folks, particularly students, spending
a night at the Four Seasons is no doubt far beyond their fi-
