## Download service set to begin 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
Yahoo! and Stanford announced the plans yester
day fora new music download service that will he of
fered to Stanford students beginning next TUesday.
According to Susan Weinstein, the director of busi
ness development at Stanford, discussions with
Yahoo! started last May.
"Last year, representatives from Yahoo! ap
proached Stanford with a great product," she said in
an interview with The Daily. "We had many people
from Stanford — including faculty and students —

working together to find the best way to provide this
type of service. At the time, our committee had been
in discussion with other providers. We began to talk
exclusively with Yahoo! last May."
Members of the committee came from many dif
ferent campus organizations, including the ASSU,
the Office of the Dean of Students, Residential Com
puting and Information Technology Systems and
Services, among others. The committee came to a
unanimous agreement to select Yahoo! based on the
features and prices the company offered.
" lne most important thing to me
was what the students wanted to do
when it came to this new service,"
said Weinstein."The idea for the sub
scription music service started be
cause we wanted to provide students
here with something new, and felt
that music played such a big role in
their lives. It worked out very well be
cause the students working with us
liked the features and look of
Yahoo's services the best. It turned
out they were the ones that also of
fered the best price."
This is the first time Yahoo! has
offered a subscription music service
to any university. The program will
be launched as a pilot, lasting
through Sept. 30 of next year. Dur
ing this period, the service will be
offered free to all Stanford students
— both graduates and undergradu
ates — courtesy of an anonymous
donor. With this pilot, students will
be able to download songs to a Win
dows-based computer free of
charge from a library of over 1.5
million sones.

After the yearlong pilot trial, stu
dents will be given the opportunity to
continue the service at a discount
rate. According to Weinstein, two dif
ferent types of services are available
through Yahoo!
"At the end of next September,
Yahoo! will notify students that the
pilot trial has ended," she said. "Stu
dents will have a choice as to whether
they would like to continue with the
service in either of two forms — the
Basic and the Portable."
With the Basic service, students will
be able to download any song onto a
PC. The Portable service gives students
the ability to use the subscription music
service on a portable device.
While this new music service is
compatible with all Windows-based
computers, it is not compatible with
the Mac operating system. In addi
tion, students who own Windows
based computers will not be able to
transfer their subscription music onto
an iPod. However, other portable de
vices are compatible with this service.
These limitations are not unique
to Yahoo's music service. Apple does
not allow any subscription music
service to be compatible with both its
operating system and its portable de
vice — the iPod.
According to a survey conducted

last year by Residential Computing, 78
percent of undergraduate students who
responded and 87 percent of graduate
students who responded said they own
Windows-compatible computers.
As a result of the differences in
compatibility, some students remain
more enthusiastic than others.
Sophomore Beth Keolanui is a
Windows user.
"1 like the idea of being able to
download free music," Keolanui said.
"I think it's a great way for Stanford to
help solve issues of copyright infringe
ment that still exist on campus."
Sophomore Molly Butcher, a Mac
user, agreed but said she couldn't
help feeling a bit excluded.
"I understand that it's Apple s de
cision to now allow their users to sub
scribe to this type of music service."
she said. "But I still can't help feeling
gypped. I'm really happy for all the
Windows users. 1 think that overall,it
will be a positive thing for Stanford
students."
Weinstein and others working
with the committee feel that this pro
gram still remains a great opportuni
ty. While Apple's decision to decline
compatibility to its customers is out
of the committee's control, Weinstein
feels that the decision to use this pilot
trial will yield a positive result.

ing this period, the service will be
offered free to all Stanford students
— both graduates and undergradu
ates — courtesy of an anonymous
donor. With this pilot, students will
be able to download songs to a Win
dows-based computer free of
charge from a library of over 1.5
million sones.

After the yearlong pilot trial, stu
dents will be given the opportunity to
continue the service at a discount
rate. According to Weinstein, two dif
ferent types of services are available
through Yahoo!
"At the end of next September,
Yahoo! will notify students that the
pilot trial has ended," she said. "Stu
dents will have a choice as to whether
they would like to continue with the
service in either of two forms — the
Basic and the Portable."
With the Basic service, students will
be able to download any song onto a
PC. The Portable service gives students
the ability to use the subscription music
service on a portable device.
While this new music service is
compatible with all Windows-based
computers, it is not compatible with
the Mac operating system. In addi
tion, students who own Windows
based computers will not be able to
transfer their subscription music onto
an iPod. However, other portable de
vices are compatible with this service.
These limitations are not unique
to Yahoo's music service. Apple does
not allow any subscription music
service to be compatible with both its
operating system and its portable de
vice — the iPod.
According to a survey conducted

last year by Residential Computing, 78
percent of undergraduate students who
responded and 87 percent of graduate
students who responded said they own
Windows-compatible computers.
As a result of the differences in
compatibility, some students remain
more enthusiastic than others.
Sophomore Beth Keolanui is a
Windows user.
"1 like the idea of being able to
download free music," Keolanui said.
"I think it's a great way for Stanford to
help solve issues of copyright infringe
ment that still exist on campus."
Sophomore Molly Butcher, a Mac
user, agreed but said she couldn't
help feeling a bit excluded.
"I understand that it's Apple s de
cision to now allow their users to sub
scribe to this type of music service."
she said. "But I still can't help feeling
gypped. I'm really happy for all the
Windows users. 1 think that overall,it
will be a positive thing for Stanford
students."
Weinstein and others working
with the committee feel that this pro
gram still remains a great opportuni
ty. While Apple's decision to decline
compatibility to its customers is out
of the committee's control, Weinstein
feels that the decision to use this pilot
trial will yield a positive result.
Yahoo! and Stanford announced the plans yester
day fora new music download service that will he of
fered to Stanford students beginning next TUesday.
According to Susan Weinstein, the director of busi
ness development at Stanford, discussions with
Yahoo! started last May.
"Last year, representatives from Yahoo! ap
proached Stanford with a great product," she said in
an interview with The Daily. "We had many people
from Stanford — including faculty and students —

working together to find the best way to provide this
type of service. At the time, our committee had been
in discussion with other providers. We began to talk
exclusively with Yahoo! last May."
Members of the committee came from many dif
ferent campus organizations, including the ASSU,
the Office of the Dean of Students, Residential Com
puting and Information Technology Systems and
Services, among others. The committee came to a
unanimous agreement to select Yahoo! based on the
features and prices the company offered.
" lne most important thing to me
was what the students wanted to do
when it came to this new service,"
said Weinstein."The idea for the sub
scription music service started be
cause we wanted to provide students
here with something new, and felt
that music played such a big role in
their lives. It worked out very well be
cause the students working with us
liked the features and look of
Yahoo's services the best. It turned
out they were the ones that also of
fered the best price."
This is the first time Yahoo! has
offered a subscription music service
to any university. The program will
be launched as a pilot, lasting
through Sept. 30 of next year. Dur
ing this period, the service will be
offered free to all Stanford students
— both graduates and undergradu
ates — courtesy of an anonymous
donor. With this pilot, students will
be able to download songs to a Win
dows-based computer free of
