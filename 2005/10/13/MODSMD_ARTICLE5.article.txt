# ASSU looks to retool loose finance regulations
## Committee pushes for stricter practices and alternative funding 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU operates on a budget larger than many
can imagine. Keeping all these finances in order is a
difficult task and last year, the ASSU had some trou
ble keeping pace with the money it promised to stu
dent groups.
According to Justin Fishner-Wolfson, ASSU fi

nancial manager and chief executive Officer of Stan
ford Student Enterprises, the organization not only
encompasses nine different businesses but also has an
operating budget of $200,000 per year. An additional
job for the organization is managing the student activ
ities fee as it gets distributed out to hundreds of stu
dent groups.
Senior Chris Nguyen, ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate chairperson and a former member of the appro
priations committee, said the student activities fee ac
cumulated about $243,000 for the general fee last
year. However, $401,000 was given out to student or
ganizations from the general fee.

"Last year's funding policies were too loose to
be sustainable," he said. "On top of that, the Senate
appropriations committee did not adhere to fund
ing policies and granted exceptions to numerous
groups with special needs. As a result, appropria
tions had to stop funding student groups in Febru
ary due to the deficit spending reaching an unsafe
level."
To remedy this gross overspending, Nguyen au
thored Measure A, which allowed the Senate to move
money around from various places to sustain student
group funding.
"Measure A was a bandage that
cannot be repeated as there are no
more places to move money from,"
Nguyen explained. "This year, the new
Senate Appropriations Committee has
implemented stricter funding policies
that will prevent the system from going
bankrupt."
However, to avoid such indiscretion
this year, junior Faris Mohiuddin,
chairperson for the ASSU appropria
tions committee said he has a number
of ideas to keep finances on track.
Some of his promises include a clos
er working relationship with the banks
and Stanford Student Enterprises
Capital Group, which directly manages
the money and can update the commit
tee weekly on how much has been
spent, as well as trends over time. Cur
rently, the ASSU has distributed 15
percent of the general fees, which, ac
cording to Mohiuddin is right on track
for this time of year.
Mohiuddin is also dedicated to hav
ing the committee strictly adhere to its

funding policy to avoid making excep
tions for funding special projects.
"When 1 look at funding requests, I
don't just think about the dollar
amount, 1 also want to keep precedents
in mind," he said.
The committee will also make a
push for more cost mandates and re
search into cheaper alternatives. Mo
hiuddin explained that the commit
tee will be mindful of where groups
get typical expenses, such as copies
and meeting services. They will then
compile a list of these lower rates and
where to obtain them and provide it
as a resource to student organiza
tions.
"As a general rule, the committee
wants to try to be more of a solution
to student groups to get funding, and
not an obstacle," he said. "If there's
only so much money, we want to also
provide groups with alternative
sources of money, such as fundrais
ers, the Stanford Fund and specific
departments."
Sophomore Chris Elmore, the
ASSU funding coordinator, reported
that the ASSU funded a total of 236
groups last year. Money for student
groups comes from the student activi
ties fee and is allocated to groups
through special fees and general fees

The ASSU Web site details the nu
ances of student organization funding.
According to the Web site, special fees
are allocated to groups that "have a
broad mission and wide-reaching im
pact on the Stanford community."
These groups apply in the winter for
money and appear on the spring ASSU
ballot.
This year, 41 student groups are re
ceiving special fees, ranging from
$6,000 for the Society for International
Affairs at Stanford ($0.37 per under
graduate) to $154,552.10 for Club
Sports ($9.49 per undergraduate).
Since there is a discrete amount of
money specifically allocated to each
group, there is little risk of over-allocat
ing monies.
The general fee, which the ASSU
struggled to fund, pays out to the ma
jority of student groups each year
through discretionary funding. These
groups must be registered through
the Office of Student Affairs and or
ganize activities related to either pro
gramming or community service. De
pending on the type of group, they
can receive up to $6,000 or $8,000.
This includes wide-ranging groups
such as the Axe Committee, Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center and
Wind Ensemble.

broad mission and wide-reaching im
pact on the Stanford community."
These groups apply in the winter for
money and appear on the spring ASSU
ballot.
This year, 41 student groups are re
ceiving special fees, ranging from
$6,000 for the Society for International
Affairs at Stanford ($0.37 per under
graduate) to $154,552.10 for Club
Sports ($9.49 per undergraduate).
Since there is a discrete amount of
money specifically allocated to each
group, there is little risk of over-allocat
ing monies.
The general fee, which the ASSU
struggled to fund, pays out to the ma
jority of student groups each year
through discretionary funding. These
groups must be registered through
the Office of Student Affairs and or
ganize activities related to either pro
gramming or community service. De
pending on the type of group, they
can receive up to $6,000 or $8,000.
This includes wide-ranging groups
such as the Axe Committee, Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center and
Wind Ensemble.
The ASSU operates on a budget larger than many
can imagine. Keeping all these finances in order is a
difficult task and last year, the ASSU had some trou
ble keeping pace with the money it promised to stu
dent groups.
According to Justin Fishner-Wolfson, ASSU fi

nancial manager and chief executive Officer of Stan
ford Student Enterprises, the organization not only
encompasses nine different businesses but also has an
operating budget of $200,000 per year. An additional
job for the organization is managing the student activ
ities fee as it gets distributed out to hundreds of stu
dent groups.
Senior Chris Nguyen, ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate chairperson and a former member of the appro
priations committee, said the student activities fee ac
cumulated about $243,000 for the general fee last
year. However, $401,000 was given out to student or
ganizations from the general fee.

"Last year's funding policies were too loose to
be sustainable," he said. "On top of that, the Senate
appropriations committee did not adhere to fund
ing policies and granted exceptions to numerous
groups with special needs. As a result, appropria
tions had to stop funding student groups in Febru
ary due to the deficit spending reaching an unsafe
level."
To remedy this gross overspending, Nguyen au
thored Measure A, which allowed the Senate to move
money around from various places to sustain student
group funding.
"Measure A was a bandage that
cannot be repeated as there are no
more places to move money from,"
Nguyen explained. "This year, the new
Senate Appropriations Committee has
implemented stricter funding policies
that will prevent the system from going
bankrupt."
However, to avoid such indiscretion
this year, junior Faris Mohiuddin,
chairperson for the ASSU appropria
tions committee said he has a number
of ideas to keep finances on track.
Some of his promises include a clos
er working relationship with the banks
and Stanford Student Enterprises
Capital Group, which directly manages
the money and can update the commit
tee weekly on how much has been
spent, as well as trends over time. Cur
rently, the ASSU has distributed 15
percent of the general fees, which, ac
cording to Mohiuddin is right on track
for this time of year.
Mohiuddin is also dedicated to hav
ing the committee strictly adhere to its

funding policy to avoid making excep
tions for funding special projects.
"When 1 look at funding requests, I
don't just think about the dollar
amount, 1 also want to keep precedents
in mind," he said.
The committee will also make a
push for more cost mandates and re
search into cheaper alternatives. Mo
hiuddin explained that the commit
tee will be mindful of where groups
get typical expenses, such as copies
and meeting services. They will then
compile a list of these lower rates and
where to obtain them and provide it
as a resource to student organiza
tions.
"As a general rule, the committee
wants to try to be more of a solution
to student groups to get funding, and
not an obstacle," he said. "If there's
only so much money, we want to also
provide groups with alternative
sources of money, such as fundrais
ers, the Stanford Fund and specific
departments."
Sophomore Chris Elmore, the
ASSU funding coordinator, reported
that the ASSU funded a total of 236
groups last year. Money for student
groups comes from the student activi
ties fee and is allocated to groups
through special fees and general fees
