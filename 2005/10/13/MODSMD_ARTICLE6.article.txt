## GSC hears student proposals Graduate students continue to work side by side with ASSU 
### MATTHEW BOYD 
Thrilled over great food, al
ways a popular incentive for all
Stanford students, about 25 gradu
ate students calmly took their
places for last night's meeting of
the Graduate Student Council
(GSC).
The GSC briefly announced is
sues like grad student involve
ment in future Voluntary Student
Organization events as well an up
coming visit from Deputy Harris
Coon of the Stanford Sheriff s De
partment.
After quickly accepting a fund
ing request of $1,920.00 from a
first-year graduate student group,
Women in Electrical Engineering,
the spotlight shifted to the ASSU
executive slate.
ASSU President Melanie Kan

nokada and Vice President Aneto
Okonkwo, both seniors, outlined
their principles, challenges and
goals, including increased collabo
ration with graduate students and
the GSC.
Okonkwo said that ASSU and
GSC cooperation was, "Critical to
[the ASSU] mission because of
tentimes graduate life is under
served."
GSC co-chair and second year
law student Jenny Allen said that
the ASSU and GSC collaboration
was going well.
"The GSC is pleased to contin
ue working with the ASSU execu
tive and feels that all branches are
working well together fora lasting
positive impact." she said.
Kannokada and Okonkwo
outlined the ASSU's recent action
items for the year, including the
revival of the Halloween Mau
soleum Party and the Ujamaa
working group, which will discuss
the issue of moving the location of
Ujamaa.
The Council also deliberated
over a bill to change the joint bylaws.
The same bill was proposed last
night to the ASSU Senate. The pro
posed bill would change the process
of selecting the chief executive offi
cer of the Stanford Student Enter
prises/ASSU financial manager in
cases where the current CEO want
ed to reapply.
"The way the bylaw is currently
written allows for the possibility of a
conflict of interest when the CEO of

SSE wants to reapply," said GSC Co
chair Tom Lee., a fourth-year electri
cal engineering grad student. "The
purpose of the bill is to fix that."
To round out the night, the GSC
listened to a presentation about the
formation of a GCEP Student Advi
sory Committee. GCEP (Global Cli
mate and Energy Project) was
formed in November. 2002 at Stan
ford in collaboration with Exxon-
Mobil and General Electric, among
other companies. The mission of the
program, as outlined in the presenta
tion, is to foster the development of
a global energy system with low
greenhouse gas emissions. The con
tributing companies give $225 mil
lion in funding over 10 years for the
development.
The presentation was given by

Albert Liu, a management science
and engineering graduate student
who felt that students should be
more involved in the decision-mak
ing process of GCEP as they are in a
similar program at MIT.
Lee said that while he was happy
to hear the presentation, the GSC's
involvement in GCEP has yet to be
determined.
"I think we want to encourage
students to bring issues to the GSC,"
Lee said. "This presentation came
about because this student [Liu]
came to last weeks meeting and we
encouraged him to come up with a
plan to address his own concerns."
Lee added that the GSC is in "lis
tening mode" and is willing to hear
input from students and faculty on
this issue.
