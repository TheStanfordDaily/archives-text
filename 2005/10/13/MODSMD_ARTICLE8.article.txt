## WORLD Further aid pledged to Pakistan 
### ANNE GEARAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
KABUL, Afghanistan â€” The top
U.S diplomat said the United States
will probably provide more financial
aid to help Pakistan recover from a
killer earthquake, and said she will
break away from her scheduled trip to
Central Asia and Afghanistan to visit
Islamabad.
"I do want to simply say to the Pak
istani people and confirm with them
that the international community and
the United States and the people of
the United States are with them in this
terrible time," Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice said yesterday.
Rice also praised political progress
in Afghanistan four years after a U.S.-
led invasion toppled the repressive
Taliban regime, and she brushed off
rocket attacks near the US. Embassy
in downtown Kabul that occurred
overnight just hours before her ar
rival.
"It happens from time to time, so it
doesn't change our plans," Rice said of
the attacks, which wounded two peo
ple.
Afghanistan has seen more war
then peace in recent decades, and
much of the country is still in ruins. It
also has installed a new and relatively
stable democratic government and
saw more than 6 million vote in large
ly smooth elections last month.

At the same time, rampant drug
trafficking and rising insurgent vio
lence imperils some of the democratic
gains of U.S. ally, President Hamid
Karzai.
"Violence is going to continue, but
this is a place that has come a very
long way," Rice told reporters travel
ing with her from Kyrgyzstan.
At a news conference with Karzai,
Rice said U.S. troops will remain in
Afghanistan "as long as they are need
ed and in whatever numbers they are
needed" and added that the United
States learned a lesson from allowing
Afghanistan to become a haven for
terrorists before Sept. 11,2001.
"We cannot simply defend our
selves," she said. "We have to be on the
offense."
What could determine success or
failure in the long term is
Afghanistan's response to drug traf

ficking on its soil, Karzai said.
"That will determine Afghanistan's
future as a state that stands on its own
feet, a state that has the respect of the
international community. ... or as a
state that will collapse and fail and fall
back into the hands of terrorism," he
said.
Neither Rice nor Karzai directly
addressed whether they had privately
discussed allegations that Karzai's
own government includes drug traf
fickers.
Rice met Karzai and others in
Kabul before flying to Pakistan's cap
ital, Islamabad.
Her route into Kabul from the air
port took her past newly repaired
buildings but also through a slalom
course or heavy barricades, razor wire
and gun towers that revealed the daily
threat of bombings and rocket attacks.
About 1,400 people have been

killed in Afghanistan since March in a
campaign of violence that authorities
blame on a resurgent Taliban.
On Monday, the U.S. military an
nounced its 201st fatality in and
around Afghanistan since U.S.-led
forces invaded in late 2001 to oust the
Taliban for harboring al-Qaida leader
Osama bin Laden. This year has been
the deadliest yet for the 21,000-strong,
U.S.-led coalition force, with 85 sol
diers killed.
Before meeting with Afghan offi
cials, Rice said NATO and the United
States will review military plans in
light of Afghanistan's political devel
opment, "but they'll be reviewed with
an eye to what remains to be done."
In Pakistan, Rice did not plan to
tour the heavily damaged Kashmir re
gion. Her visit was to be confined to
the capital, in part to avoid getting in
the way of relief efforts.
