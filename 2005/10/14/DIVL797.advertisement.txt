In the kitchen and laundry:
• Report dripping faucets or other water leak to your
Housing Supervisor or by colling V2281 tor academic

• Fill a basin rather than leave the water running while
washing dishes or produce, or defrosting food

possible) adjust the water level setting to match vow
load.
• Minimize use of garbage disposals.
• Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator
rather than running tap water to cool it.
