Hailed as the Thomas Edison and Henry Ford of Silicon Valley, Robert Noyce
co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel and also co-invented the inte
grated circuit. He was a brilliant inventor, a leading entrepreneur, and a dar
ing risk taker. Leslie Berlin spent nearly a decade studying Noyce's life, and
her recently published biography, The Man Behind the Microchip: Robert
Noyce and the Invention of Silicon Valley (http://www.themanbehindthemi
crochip.com) has received praise from engineers, business people, and aca
demics alike. In this talk based on her research, Berlin captures not only
Noyce's work but also the vibrant interplay of technology, business, money,
politics, and culture that defines Silicon Valley
Leslie Berlin is working to find and preserve key papers and artifacts pertaining to the histo
ry of Silicon Valley. A former speechwriter fora Fortune 500 CKO, Berlin holds a Ph.D. in
History from Stanford and a B.A. in American Studies from Yale.
