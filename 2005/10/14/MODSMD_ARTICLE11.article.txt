### H. WELLS WULSIN STAFF WRITER 
This Stanford junior political science major and var
sity tennis player recently competed fora top prize of
$100,000 on 'College Jeopardy.'
Correct answer — who is Nico Martinez?
Martinez, a member of Stanford's Quiz Bowl team,
knows the only nationality that is a palindrome (Naru
ran). the only flag besides the U.S. to add a star for every
state (Brazil) and the only freshwater lake home to
sharks (Lake Nicaragua). He put his encyclopedic
knowledge of trivia to practical use in the game show's
perennial battle of wits.
Martinez competed against 14 other college stu
dents from around the country, representing schools
such as Princeton, Duke, New York University, Purdue
and others.
The tournament pitted three contestants against
each other at a time, with five quarter-final rounds,
three semi-finals and a cumulative two-day final round.
The overall winner of the competition takes home
$ 100,000, and the other contestants receive prizes rang
ing from $5,000 to $50,000.
Jeopardy selects contestants for the show through
preliminary competitions held in a few cities around
the country. Martinez thought his chances were dashed
after his Detroit application was denied, but when he

found out about another screening in
Raleigh, N.C., he decided to walk in
on a whim.
"I just happened to be there, drop
ping my friend off at college," he said.
"1 didn't even know if 1 was going to
be able to try out. But I figured, let's
give it a shot."
After taking two written tests and
answering live questions in a mock-
Jeopardy format, Martinez was select
ed as one of the two students from the
Raleigh location to appear on College
Jeopardy.
"I was floored," Martinez said.
However, this won't be Martinez's
first game show appearance. In June
2004, he competed on 'Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.' Although he won
just $ 1,000 on that show, he said that it
built up his confidence under pres
sure.
"I had the experience of being on
national TV before, so 1 felt pretty
poised doing Jeopardy," he said.
"While the game was going on I didn't
feel nervous. But definitely before
hand you get some butterflies."
Martinez studied in preparation
for the show, especially less-familiar
subjects.

"1 felt pretty comfortable about ac
ademic stuff," he said. "Pop culture
I'm a lot weaker in. My sister and girl
friend bought me US Weekly, Enter
tainment, Star, other magazines like
that. My sister made me a cheat sheet
of best albums of the year, Grammy
and Oscar winners, bigTV shows, stuff
she knows but that's not really my
thing."
Even some last-minute prepara
tion proved helpful.
"I walked out of the hotel room on
the morning of the taping, and then
came back in, looked at a certain sec
tion of this book [The Cultural Litera
cy Trivia Guide]," Martinez said. "Lo
and behold, it came up on a big ques
tion of the show. That's how I ap
proach school in general. I'm a big
crammer."
In this battle of brains, knowledge
is not all that counts.
"The buzzer is the single-most im
portant factor," Martinez said. "All
the kids there knew the answers to 80
percent or more of the questions.
ITiese kids are really freaking smart.
But you can't buzz in till Alex is done
reading the question, or else you get
locked out fora fraction of a second.
Everyone's trying to get the timing
right."
Martinez found at an early age that
he could collect facts and recall them
with ease.
"I have a photographic memory.so

1 can remember things in terms of pic
tures," he said. "When 1 think about a
piece of information, I'll think about
where it was on the page, or on a map
or where I wrote it down."
Last year, he and teammates Eric
Smith, a senior and current captain of
the Quiz Bowl team, and Yogesh
Raut, Class of 2(X)s,placed third at the
College Bowl National Champi
onship Tournament.
Martinez also won first place at the
Stanford Intramural Quiz Bowl tour
nament last year, competing with two
fellow Sigma Alpha Epsilon mem
bers, Ari Neumann and Andrew Gay,
both juniors.
Gay said that Martinez brought in
the bulk of the points for the team.
"I would compare him to a ball
hog, but still a good player; maybe an
Allen Iverson "Gay said.
What would Martinez do if he won
the grand prize?
"Well, I've taken Portuguese for
two years, so I'd want to go to Rio for
Carnaval, for sure," he said.
All 10 shows were taped on Oct. 1
and 2,in Raleigh, N.C., but contestants
cannot reveal the results of the com
petition until the show airs on televi
sion, beginning Nov. 7. Martinez first
appears in the quarter-final round on
Nov. 11.
"It's tearing me up," Martinez said.
"There are so many stories I want to
tell, but I can't."

hog, but still a good player; maybe an
Allen Iverson "Gay said.
What would Martinez do if he won
the grand prize?
"Well, I've taken Portuguese for
two years, so I'd want to go to Rio for
Carnaval, for sure," he said.

Correct answer — who is Nico Martinez?
Martinez, a member of Stanford's Quiz Bowl team,
knows the only nationality that is a palindrome (Naru
ran). the only flag besides the U.S. to add a star for every
state (Brazil) and the only freshwater lake home to
sharks (Lake Nicaragua). He put his encyclopedic
knowledge of trivia to practical use in the game show's
perennial battle of wits.
Martinez competed against 14 other college stu
dents from around the country, representing schools
such as Princeton, Duke, New York University, Purdue
and others.
The tournament pitted three contestants against
each other at a time, with five quarter-final rounds,
three semi-finals and a cumulative two-day final round.
The overall winner of the competition takes home
$ 100,000, and the other contestants receive prizes rang
ing from $5,000 to $50,000.

preliminary competitions held in a few cities around
the country. Martinez thought his chances were dashed
after his Detroit application was denied, but when he

found out about another screening in
Raleigh, N.C., he decided to walk in
on a whim.
"I just happened to be there, drop
ping my friend off at college," he said.
"1 didn't even know if 1 was going to
be able to try out. But I figured, let's
give it a shot."
After taking two written tests and
answering live questions in a mock-
Jeopardy format, Martinez was select
ed as one of the two students from the
Raleigh location to appear on College
Jeopardy.
"I was floored," Martinez said.
However, this won't be Martinez's
first game show appearance. In June
2004, he competed on 'Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.' Although he won
just $ 1,000 on that show, he said that it
built up his confidence under pres
sure.
"I had the experience of being on
national TV before, so 1 felt pretty
poised doing Jeopardy," he said.
"While the game was going on I didn't
feel nervous. But definitely before
hand you get some butterflies."
Martinez studied in preparation
for the show, especially less-familiar
subjects.

"1 felt pretty comfortable about ac
ademic stuff," he said. "Pop culture
I'm a lot weaker in. My sister and girl
friend bought me US Weekly, Enter
tainment, Star, other magazines like
that. My sister made me a cheat sheet
of best albums of the year, Grammy
and Oscar winners, bigTV shows, stuff
she knows but that's not really my
thing."
Even some last-minute prepara
tion proved helpful.
"I walked out of the hotel room on
the morning of the taping, and then
came back in, looked at a certain sec
tion of this book [The Cultural Litera
cy Trivia Guide]," Martinez said. "Lo
and behold, it came up on a big ques
tion of the show. That's how I ap
proach school in general. I'm a big
crammer."
In this battle of brains, knowledge
is not all that counts.
"The buzzer is the single-most im
portant factor," Martinez said. "All
the kids there knew the answers to 80
percent or more of the questions.
ITiese kids are really freaking smart.
But you can't buzz in till Alex is done
reading the question, or else you get
locked out fora fraction of a second.
Everyone's trying to get the timing
right."
Martinez found at an early age that
he could collect facts and recall them
with ease.
"I have a photographic memory.so

1 can remember things in terms of pic
tures," he said. "When 1 think about a
piece of information, I'll think about
where it was on the page, or on a map
or where I wrote it down."
Last year, he and teammates Eric
Smith, a senior and current captain of
the Quiz Bowl team, and Yogesh
Raut, Class of 2(X)s,placed third at the
College Bowl National Champi
onship Tournament.
