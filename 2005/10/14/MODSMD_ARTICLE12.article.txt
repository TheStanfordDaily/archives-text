### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
With a new name and a new director, Stan
ford's Overseas Studies Program has made
changes to its curriculum. The Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP). as it is now called,
has upgraded the Chile program, reduced the
number of students in the Paris program and
may open a new campus in Spain.
"Fundamentally. 1 became the director of a

very vibrant and successful program, which
needs constant attention and hard work to
maintain," said new BOSP Director Norman
Naimark.
lTie name has been changed in honor and
recognition of Peter and Helen Bing who do
nated $25 million to the Overseas Study Pro
gram.
Hie Chile abroad location has been updat
ed to "accommodate a greater number of stu
dents in more pleasant and effective facili
ties," according to Outreach and Student Re
lations manager Shannon Marimon.The pro
gram now accommodates 50 students, and
Stanford is leasing a new, slightly larger space
in Santiago.

"In Santiago we felt comfortable [upgrad
ing] because the staff there felt comfortable
taking on other students," Marimon said.
Paris, on the other hand, was downsized so
as not to overcrowd the facilities.
Since there is high student demand fora
program in Spain, the Bing Overseas Studies
Program is now working on the possibility of
creating a new campus. The program is also
considering expanding overseas study options
in developing countries.
The previous director, Amos Nur, left the
program this year because "it's expected to be
a fixed term position so over time it rotates in
terms of who is holding the actual
position," said Marimon.
Naimark is a professor in the His
tory Department who attended
Stanford's Overseas Program in
Germany as a student in the 19605.

He went on to teach at the Overseas
Studies Program in Krakow in the
early 90s and in Moscow in 2001,
both of which he describes as spec
tacular teaching experiences.
He has also worked on commit
tees associated with overseas studies
and his daughter attended the Flo
rence program.
"From these experiences, 1 be
came very devoted to the program,"
Naimark said. "I also believe it is es

sential for our students to study
abroad and learn to be citizens of the
world."
Throughout these changes, the
most important aspect of Stanford's
overseas studies program remains
unique.
"First and foremost is the time
and effort Stanford puts into making
sure the overseas experience is aca
demically challenging and culturally
enriching," Naimark said.
