## Confronting Katrina class analyzes race 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
The failures of Hurricane Katrina recovery ef
forts began long before the chance that a Category
Four or Five hurricane would strike New Orleans.
They continued with an inadequate evacuation plan
and culminated in a relief program hampered by
lack of planning, supplies and manpower and a
breakdown in communications.
In an effort to understand some of the complex
societal issues that surfaced with Hurricane Katrina,
the faculty leadership of the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) has or
ganized a class entitled "Confronting Katrina â€”
Race, Class, and Disaster in American Society." Ac
cording to the course syllabus, the goal of this class is
to explore matters of race and class disadvantage
that were laid bare by the hurricane and its conse
quences.
"The idea for the 'Confronting Katrina: Race,
Class, and Disaster in America' course grew out of
our regular Center for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity leadership meeting," said Sociology
Prof. Larry Bobo. "The faculty involved, which in
cludes Professors A1 Camarillo, Hazel Markus,
Paula Moya, Matt Snipp, Dorothy Steele and myself,
believed that CCSRE is unusually well-equipped
and indeed positively obligated to speak to the is
sues raised by events in New Orleans following Hur
ricane Katrina."
This one-time only course provides one unit of
credit and is open to undergraduate and graduate
students. The class is taught by various faculty affili
ated with CSRE; the first class took place Oct. 10 in
Braun Hall. The panel was moderated by Sociology
Prof. Matt Snipp with Bobo, History Prof. A1 Camar
illo and Political Science Prof Luis Fraga speaking
on various issues.
The course will be organized around four panel
presentations scheduled for Monday evenings dur
ing the autumn quarter, featuring panelists from a
wide variety of fields. The course is comprised of ses
sions taught by Stanford faculty and distinguished
outside guests.
According to Bobo,the themes for
each of the four sessions are as fol
lows: (1) The Foundations of Neglect;
(2) Media, Culture, and the Politics of
Representation: Viewing a Racialized
Disaster; (3) Organizations as the So
lution and the Problem; and (4)
Lessons from Katrina.
"For us it was not a question of
whether to treat recent events as a
learning opportunity," Bobo said.
"But what venue would provide the
best platform for engaging our stu
dents, fellow faculty and staff and the
larger community. We collectively
brainstormed to design the course and
immediately began the work of put
ting it together."
Several students attending the lec

ture were taken aback by the wealth
of information presented by the pan
elists.
"It was impressive to see how the
three panelists amassed such a great
amount of information in the limited
time they had," said sophomore Mari
bel Diaz, who is enrolled in the course.
"I thought the graphs of the poverty
concentration in New Orleans during
Professor Larry Bobo's lecture were
striking. It really put things into per
spective."
The first session addressed some
key foundations of the neglect seen in
the wake of Katrina. Demographic,
sociological, historical and political
underpinnings of what was wrong
were discussed. The class ended in a
question-and-answer session during
which audience members tried to gain
a clearer view of what should be done
in the future.
"We were delighted with Provost
[John] Etchemendy's almost instanta
neous decision to provide support for

staging the course and that Charlie
Junkerman from Continuing Studies
responded immediately with support
as well," Bobo said.
Confronting Katrina is co-spon
sored by Stanford Continuing Studies,
the Office of the Provost, the Program
in African and African American
Studies and the Institute for'Rfefcearch
in the Social Sciences.
"As a resident of the Gulf Coast,
I've experienced many tropical
storms and floods, but never a natural
disaster as severe as a hurricane," said
sophomore Olga Medina who is also
enrolled in Confronting Katrina.
"After witnessing the effects of Katri
na from my hometown. 1 sympathized
with the people of New Orleans, espe
cially those who did not have a means
to evacuate before the storm hit the
area. I decided to enroll in the course,
because it provides students with an
opportunity to understand the role
that the University community in gen
eral plays in response efforts."
