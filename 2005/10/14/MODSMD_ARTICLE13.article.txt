## Confronting Katrina class analyzes race 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
The failures of Hurricane Katrina recovery ef
forts began long before the chance that a Category
Four or Five hurricane would strike New Orleans.
They continued with an inadequate evacuation plan
and culminated in a relief program hampered by
lack of planning, supplies and manpower and a
breakdown in communications.
In an effort to understand some of the complex
societal issues that surfaced with Hurricane Katrina,
the faculty leadership of the Center for Compara

ganized a class entitled "Confronting Katrina â€”

cording to the course syllabus, the goal of this class is
to explore matters of race and class disadvantage
that were laid bare by the hurricane and its conse

"The idea for the 'Confronting Katrina: Race,
Class, and Disaster in America' course grew out of

Prof. Larry Bobo. "The faculty involved, which in

believed that CCSRE is unusually well-equipped
and indeed positively obligated to speak to the is
sues raised by events in New Orleans following Hur
ricane Katrina."
This one-time only course provides one unit of
credit and is open to undergraduate and graduate
students. The class is taught by various faculty affili

Braun Hall. The panel was moderated by Sociology
Prof. Matt Snipp with Bobo, History Prof. A1 Camar
illo and Political Science Prof Luis Fraga speaking
on various issues.
The course will be organized around four panel
presentations scheduled for Monday evenings dur
ing the autumn quarter, featuring panelists from a
wide variety of fields. The course is comprised of ses
sions taught by Stanford faculty and distinguished
