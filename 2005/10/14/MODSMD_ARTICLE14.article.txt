I feel like I'm eating at an elegant wedding
reception. We're sitting in the overflow sec
tion of Straits Cafe, a high-class Singapore
an restaurant. Space heaters warm the can
vas-partitioned patio area. Fountains,
plants and sculpted Buddhas complete the
greenhouse/wedding tent feel. The red
lighting makes shadow puppets out of the
vine-covered trellises and paper lanterns. It
feels clean and understated.
Be sure to make reservations at this
popular restaurant. The menu offers a fu
sion of various Asian cuisines. According to
Straits' Web site, Singapore is the cross
roads of Southeast Asia and its food is in
spired by Indonesian, Chinese and Indian
cuisines. We're eager to try it out.
There are seven of us, but our waiter says
we can only split the check four ways. Sud
denly, the math becomes very complicated.
"I'm not sharing a check with you," Ros
abelle says to Ricky. "You already owe me
money!"
"Hey," Ricky replies. "As long as I owe
you money, you'll never be broke."
Our long-suffering server waits until we
stop bickering and decide on an appetizer.
We go for crispy calamari with lime aioli
and roti prata (grilled Indian flatbread)
with curry dipping sauce. The roti is fantas
tic and disappears in seconds. Attention
then turns to the calamari, and it takes less
than a minute to wipe the plate clean.
If you eat at Straits (and you should),
choose a drink that adds to the experience.
Mango lemonade is both glamorous and
delicious. There is also an exotic yogurt
drink in flavors like rose, black currant and
passion fruit. In addition, Straits has an ex
tensive list of cocktails, which I will be legal
ly able to review in 1 year and 5 months.
Waiting to order our food, the conversa
tion turns to the pros and cons of the phrase
"comparing apples to oranges."
"It's very logical to compare apples and
oranges," Debz claims. "They're both
round, juicy fruits."
"We should say, 'That's like comparing
apples to the Empire State Building,'" Matt
opines.
Comparing food at Straits Cafe to
"food" at Lag dining would really be com
paring apples to the Empire State Building.
It takes several minutes to decide between
the many appealing dishes on the menu.
You can dine family style and share several
dishes between your friends.
The chicken pad thai in tamarind sauce
is tasty, and the spicy basil chicken is incred
ible. Our friend Armando proved his man
hood by ordering potong kari ayam — an
entire half a chicken with yellow curry and
potatoes.
Matt's lamb korma comes in a glass
bowl with a pastry shell baked over the top
of it. My roommate recommends the laksa
paella, a spicy coconut risotto with abalone,
shrimp, scallops and vegetables.
No one has room for dessert, but we
order it anyway. Straits has the kind of
desserts you want to paint pictures of be
fore eating, and I can hardly bring myself to
take a bite and ruin the aesthetics of my last
course. I order kueh nagasari, or Singa
porean banana pudding, and it comes in a
cone shape and wrapped in a banana leaf.
The leaf looks like a sail, and my pudding is
in a sea of artistically swirled strawberry
and mango juice. I finally dig in and find
that it tastes even better than it looks. I also
recommend trying the sago pudding, which
is sticky rice topped with palm sugar and
coconut milk.
My roommate's car only seats five, but
we stage our own miniature circus by piling
seven people into it. Sitting on Armando's
lap with my face in Debz' armpit, I'm think
ing about the next time I'll go to Straits. I
need a sugar daddy, I decide. Or, hey,
there's always parents' weekend.

we stage our own miniature circus by piling
seven people into it. Sitting on Armando's
lap with my face in Debz' armpit, I'm think
ing about the next time I'll go to Straits. I
need a sugar daddy, I decide. Or, hey,
there's always parents' weekend.

I feel like I'm eating at an elegant wedding
reception. We're sitting in the overflow sec
tion of Straits Cafe, a high-class Singapore
an restaurant. Space heaters warm the can
vas-partitioned patio area. Fountains,
plants and sculpted Buddhas complete the
greenhouse/wedding tent feel. The red
lighting makes shadow puppets out of the
vine-covered trellises and paper lanterns. It
feels clean and understated.
Be sure to make reservations at this
popular restaurant. The menu offers a fu
sion of various Asian cuisines. According to
Straits' Web site, Singapore is the cross
roads of Southeast Asia and its food is in
spired by Indonesian, Chinese and Indian
cuisines. We're eager to try it out.
There are seven of us, but our waiter says
we can only split the check four ways. Sud
denly, the math becomes very complicated.
"I'm not sharing a check with you," Ros
abelle says to Ricky. "You already owe me
money!"
"Hey," Ricky replies. "As long as I owe
you money, you'll never be broke."
Our long-suffering server waits until we
stop bickering and decide on an appetizer.
We go for crispy calamari with lime aioli
and roti prata (grilled Indian flatbread)
with curry dipping sauce. The roti is fantas
tic and disappears in seconds. Attention
then turns to the calamari, and it takes less
than a minute to wipe the plate clean.
If you eat at Straits (and you should),
choose a drink that adds to the experience.
Mango lemonade is both glamorous and
delicious. There is also an exotic yogurt
drink in flavors like rose, black currant and
passion fruit. In addition, Straits has an ex
tensive list of cocktails, which I will be legal
ly able to review in 1 year and 5 months.
Waiting to order our food, the conversa
tion turns to the pros and cons of the phrase
"comparing apples to oranges."
"It's very logical to compare apples and
oranges," Debz claims. "They're both
round, juicy fruits."
"We should say, 'That's like comparing
apples to the Empire State Building,'" Matt
opines.
Comparing food at Straits Cafe to
"food" at Lag dining would really be com
paring apples to the Empire State Building.
It takes several minutes to decide between
the many appealing dishes on the menu.
You can dine family style and share several
dishes between your friends.
The chicken pad thai in tamarind sauce
is tasty, and the spicy basil chicken is incred
ible. Our friend Armando proved his man
hood by ordering potong kari ayam — an
entire half a chicken with yellow curry and
potatoes.
Matt's lamb korma comes in a glass
bowl with a pastry shell baked over the top
of it. My roommate recommends the laksa
paella, a spicy coconut risotto with abalone,
shrimp, scallops and vegetables.
No one has room for dessert, but we
order it anyway. Straits has the kind of
desserts you want to paint pictures of be
fore eating, and I can hardly bring myself to
take a bite and ruin the aesthetics of my last
course. I order kueh nagasari, or Singa
porean banana pudding, and it comes in a
cone shape and wrapped in a banana leaf.
The leaf looks like a sail, and my pudding is
in a sea of artistically swirled strawberry
and mango juice. I finally dig in and find
that it tastes even better than it looks. I also
recommend trying the sago pudding, which
is sticky rice topped with palm sugar and
coconut milk.
My roommate's car only seats five, but
we stage our own miniature circus by piling
seven people into it. Sitting on Armando's
lap with my face in Debz' armpit, I'm think
ing about the next time I'll go to Straits. I
need a sugar daddy, I decide. Or, hey,
there's always parents' weekend.
