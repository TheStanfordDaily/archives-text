You think your problem sets are hard? Try
"Raising a Multidimensional Star Child in a
Changing World," like Ann Andrews. Or
"Crossing the Boundary into Cosmic Citizenship,"
like her son Jason.
Ann and Jason, whose family has experienced
more than just the typical growing pains, plan to ap
pear as guest speakers at the seventh annual Bay
Area UFO Expo in Santa Gara. The Expo will be
held at the Westin Hotel on Oct. 15 and 16 from 7:30
a.m. to about 9 p.m. each day.
According to the event's Web site —

http://www.thebayareaufoexpo.com — the
Andrews family has experienced paranor
mal events, government interference and
alien abductions for about 12 years, even
though the family appears to be normal.
The site adds that today, the Andrews-

es have become accustomed to the unusu
al occurrences and know "without a shad
ow of a doubt that Jason is a multiple alien
abductee and a star child of Extraterrestrial

(ET) origin."
Nevertheless, they are mere plebeians of the
extraterrestrial community when compared with
some of the other guests who plan to attend the
conference, such as the first man to run for Congress
on the UFO ticket and Jordan Maxwell, the "Godfa
ther of Culticism and Secret Societies," according to
Expo Associate Producer Brian Hall.
Dannion Brinkley will also be one of the crowd.
He claims to have traveled to "the other side" while
being pronounced dead for half-an-hour in 1975.
That was the first of Brinkley's three deaths to date.
The Bay Area UFO Expo, a series of lectures and
workshops, is the largest exposition of its kind and
usually draws a crowd of more than 1,000. The Expo
was first held in 1999 as a means for Executive Pro
ducer Victoria Jacks to commemorate the life of "her
loving father and UFO eyewitness, Roy Fortner," ac
cording to the program's Web site.
Fortner's UFO sightings during his long trips as a
truck driver led to his spiritual transformation, but
not all extraterrestrial encounters are as positive.
Hall says that although some "encounters are
friendly, benevolent and very spiritual," others, such
as alien abductions, have a "darker side."
Many who believe in extraterrestrials tend to
blame abductions on "little greys" — the most com
monly sighted alien species.
Described by Hall as "the size of children with
grey skin, oversized heads, slits fora mouth and nose
and very large black almond shaped eyes," little greys
are also purported by some to be merely "manufac
tured biological entities" working to fulfill a greater
"reptilian hierarchy," he says.
Though the conference will address UFO sight
ings and alien encounters, it will also delve into
broader issues such as government conspiracies and
the discovery of new dimensions.
"We can't think linearly, two-dimensionally, or
even three-dimensionally," Hall explains."The short
est distance between two points is not a straight line
— it's no line at all."
It is mind-boggling concepts like these which
make Hall, among others, wonder if we can possibly
be alone.
"We may be part of some kind of experiment and
planet Earth may be nothing more than a petri dish,"
he surmises.
Hall also suggests that the government and mass
media have much more evidence of the existence of
extraterrestrial life than they let on.
"I'm aware of the sinister forces at work in this
country," he says. "My personal opinion is that our
news is highly controlled by multi-nationalistic secret
societies, many of which are destined to horde eso
teric knowledge away from the masses."
He proposes, however, that the government may
be trying to indoctrinate us with "the truth" through
science-fiction documentaries and movies so that
"when the government can't hide [the truth] any
more, it won't come as a shock to society."
Hall also argues that the government has substan
tial knowledge regarding weather-modification,
backing his belief by referring to a 1977 internation

al agreement from the Environmental Modification
Convention prohibiting international powers' hos
tile use of weather modification.
While a handful of Stanford professors and affili
ates are involved in extraterrestrial research, most re
main skeptical.
Ron Bracewell, professor emeritus in the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering, says that he was "not
particularly impressed" with the Expo, judging from
its Web site.
"Many [UFO sightings] are reported every day
and for the most part there arc some simple explana
tions," he adds.
Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) —
a 20-year-old, nonprofit research organization in
Mountain View — echoes Bracewells doubts, not
ing the ambiguity of photos and word-of-mouth.
"If you're going to say they're here, give me some
good evidence," Shostak says. "Otherwise it's like
telling me about [the existence of] leprechauns."
Hall, however, asks skeptics to examine the cor
roboration of different sightings across the globe
from groups of people who would have had no
means of communicating.
"Children in South Africa are engaging with crea
tures who look and act exactly the same as the ones
the grandmothers in Hoboken are seeing." he says.

While Bracewell and Shostak be
lieve that there is a high possibility
of extraterrestrial life existing.

both note a distinction between the scientific commu
nity and the "extremist believers," as Bracewell calls
them.
"As far as whether aliens exist, I absolutely think
they do," Shostak says. "On the other hand, half of
the American public thinks they're here and ab
ducting people from Queens for unauthorized ex
periments. The evidence is unfortunately not very
good."
Shostak also refutes the international or national
conspiracy that Hall alleges, claiming that the public
could handle the news of extraterrestrial life since
"half of the public thinks they're here and they're not
rioting in the streets."
Furthermore, he notes that such conspiracies
would require a secret international collaboration
between all the major foreign powers.
"I'm not convinced [U.S. government officials]
could keep something secret like this for 55 years." he
says. "They can barely run the post office."
Bu Hall admonishes, just the same, "Watch the
sky, but also watch your backs."
The Westin Hotel is located at 5101 Great Ameri
ca Parkway. The exhibit room, which features the
speakers and extraterrestrial-related products, is
open to the public for free. All-access passes are
available for $40 a day, or $70 for the full two-day
weekend. $25 workshops last for approximately an
hour and a half, and longer ones are available for $35.
