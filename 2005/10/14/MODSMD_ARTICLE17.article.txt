# Get thee to the theater—Bay Area offers free shows
## 
### AMIN EL GAMAL 
"I'm free, are you?"
So goes the tagline for Theatre Bay
Area's (TBA) National Free Night of The
atre campaign. It's also a question TBA
hopes Bay Area residents will ask each
other on Thursday, Oct. 20 when 85 of the
area's theaters open their doors to audi
ences at no cost.
"We're asking patrons to try a theater
they've never gone to before," says TBA Ex
ecutive Director Brad Erickson. "If some
one never attends theater, then any of the
[shows] would be perfect. If someone al
ready attends one theater regularly, we're
hoping they'll try something different."
As the third largest theater district in the
country, the Bay Area has more theater
troupes per capita than any other metropol
itan area excluding New York City, accord
ing to Erickson. TBA hopes the pilot free
theater program will boost a consciousness
of the vibrant theater scene that the area has
to offer.
"There's a lot out there," Erickson says.
"We want to build awareness of theater in
our region, encourage risk-taking by audi

enccs and foster a theater-going habit in all
our diverse communities."
According to Erickson. the response to
the event has been "enthusiastic." The TBA
Web site received 10(),()0() hits within an
hour of the tickets' release, he says.
But Rachel Anderson, a graduate stu
dent in drama at Stanford, questions the
program's long-term effectiveness.
"In my experience, offering free tickets
doesn't necessarily get bodies in seats," An
derson says. "But if it is cost that keeps
would-be patrons away rather than artistic
complacency, 1 think it's an excellent idea."
She continues, "I like it as a gateway
strategy for building audiences. But I like it
more when tickets stay affordable and audi
ences make life-long, rather than evening
long, commitments to the arts."
Iliough most of the shows are sold out,
some tickets remain available for shows
such as "Menopause the Musical," which In
diana's Frankfurt Times reviewed as a "joy
ous. rollicking celebration of sisterhood."
The musical is playing at San Francisco's
Theatre 39. located at Fisherman's Wharf. If
you can't make it to the free performance on
Oct. 20, regular performances cost $46.50

and are on TUesday through Saturday at 8
p.m.. Wednesday and Sunday at 2 p.m. and
Saturday at 4 p.m. For further information,
call (415) 433-3939.
Another production with tickets avail
able is "Drake's Drum," a play depicting an
imagined meeting between Sir Francis
Drake and Sir Thomas Doughty — a friend
whom Drake sentenced to death. It is show
ing at the Sonoma County Repertory The
atre, located an hour-and-a-half north of
Stanford. Prior the free performance on
Oct. 20 — which is the last date the show
will run — there are showings Thursday
through Saturday at 8 p.m. and a Sunday
matinee Oct. 16 at 2 p.m. Prices range from
$15 to $20. For further information, call
(707)-823-0177.
Other notable shows that will be free on
Oct. 20 include a revue of Mercer songs:
"Moon River: A Johnny Mercer Cabaret" at
CTA Crossroads, an hour northeast of cam
pus. and "Splittin' the Raft," a highly-styl
ized retelling of "Huckleberry Finn" as in
terpreted by Frederick Douglass. "Splittin"'
is showing at the Marin Theatre Company in
Mill Valley, which is an hour north of Stan
ford. It is also near the Ross Valley Players,

which features "Wait Until Dark" — a
thriller depicting a blind woman's travails
with heroin-dealing thugs.
Be it to see post-menstrual women or
Huck Finn,"The best way to get into theater
is to actually go!" Erickson says.

The Thick House (http://www.thickde
scription.org) located on 18th Street in San
Francisco "tends to produce fairly cutting
edge stuff," according to sophomore Paz
Hilfinger-Pardo. "Their previews are usual
ly either pay-what-you-can or sometimes
[the theatre will] pay you a dollar to see the
show."
Hilfinger-Pardo also recommends Bay
Area Theatre Sports (http://www.improv.org)
which presents weekly, completely impro
vised shows in San Francisco.
Sophomore Tara Laidlaw promotes The
atre Works (www.theatreworks.org).
"They do a lot of things most people
haven't heard of. but they're always fantas
tic." she says. "An added bonus is you can
bike to their Palo Alto venue from campus."
"I'm free, are you?"
So goes the tagline for Theatre Bay
Area's (TBA) National Free Night of The
atre campaign. It's also a question TBA
hopes Bay Area residents will ask each
other on Thursday, Oct. 20 when 85 of the
area's theaters open their doors to audi
ences at no cost.
"We're asking patrons to try a theater
they've never gone to before," says TBA Ex
ecutive Director Brad Erickson. "If some
one never attends theater, then any of the
[shows] would be perfect. If someone al
ready attends one theater regularly, we're
hoping they'll try something different."
As the third largest theater district in the
country, the Bay Area has more theater
troupes per capita than any other metropol
itan area excluding New York City, accord
ing to Erickson. TBA hopes the pilot free
theater program will boost a consciousness
of the vibrant theater scene that the area has
to offer.
"There's a lot out there," Erickson says.
"We want to build awareness of theater in
our region, encourage risk-taking by audi

enccs and foster a theater-going habit in all
our diverse communities."
According to Erickson. the response to
the event has been "enthusiastic." The TBA
Web site received 10(),()0() hits within an
hour of the tickets' release, he says.
But Rachel Anderson, a graduate stu
dent in drama at Stanford, questions the
program's long-term effectiveness.
"In my experience, offering free tickets
doesn't necessarily get bodies in seats," An
derson says. "But if it is cost that keeps
would-be patrons away rather than artistic
complacency, 1 think it's an excellent idea."
She continues, "I like it as a gateway
strategy for building audiences. But I like it
more when tickets stay affordable and audi
ences make life-long, rather than evening
long, commitments to the arts."
