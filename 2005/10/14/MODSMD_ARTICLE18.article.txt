## Editorial Think elections were last year? Not in California 
### 
While this year doesn't end in an
even number, Californians will be
going to the polls on Nov. 8 to vote
on eight propositions in a special statewide
election. You should vote. And if you don't
— probably because you want to stay regis
tered in your home state — it should be a
conscious decision
As you probably know, college students
who qualify to vote (are 18 and U.S. citi
zens) may cast their ballots either at their
home residence or in the county in which
they attend college. In keeping with prece
dent, we strongly recommend that all stu
dents register to vote and cast their ballots
on Election Day. We would also like to rec
ommend that students seriously and con
sciously decide whether to vote absentee in
their home elections or at Stanford.
Why, you may ask, would you want to
vote at home? If you are from New Jersey
or Virginia, voters in your state are casting
votes for the governor's office. In both of
these races, polls show a close contest be
tween the Democratic and Republican can
didates. While the voter registration dead
lines for New Jersey and Virginia have
passed, you may still request absentee bal
lots from your county if you are already
registered in either state.
There are other reasons that you may
want to consider voting at home. Your town
or county may be holding important munic
ipal elections. In some states, registering to
vote and voting at your home residence will
also help you to establish residency for in
state tuition at state universities. In any
case, a quick Google search will help you
determine whether you can vote at your
home residence and, if so, how.
And in California
This year, there are eight propositions
before California voters in the special elec
tion. These aren't just suggestions for law
makers; propositions are either legal
statutes or constitutional amendments, and
they give voters the fairly unique opportu
nity to directly decide on laws. You should
vote here because, whatever your political
leanings, your vote will have a direct impact
on people's lives. It may affect abortion, po
litical contributions, Congressional districts
and prescription drugs. Here are a few ways
your voice will matter.
On Nov. 8, the ballot will contain a state
constitutional amendment that mandates a
waiting period and parental notification for
minors seeking an abortion. Currently, Cal
ifornia's constitution treats minors similar
to adults with respect to abortion services.
Prop. 73, a proposed amendment, would
change the treatment of minors with re
spect to abortion services and, because the
proposition is an amendment, neither the
state legislature nor the courts could coun
teract the policy. Whether in support of, or
in opposition to, parental notification for
minors and mandatory waiting periods,
your vote will matter.
The ballot also contains two hallmarks
of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's plan to

reform California.
Prop. 74 extends from two years to five
years the period teachers must wait before
acquiring tenure. This proposition would
also make dismissal of teachers who re
ceive unsatisfactory performance evalua
tions easier. Prop. 75, another
Schwarzenegger proposition, requires writ
ten consent from government-employee
union members to use individual dues to
ward political contributions.
Currently, the California state legisla
ture draws the boundaries of electoral dis
tricts and the governor approves them
every 10 years. Prop. 77 alters this process
by requiring that legislative leaders appoint
three retired judges to draw electoral dis
tricts. This proposition would take effect
immediately and would redistrict Califor
nia in 2005, and then again following each
census.
Props. 78 and 79 tackle the issue of state
discounts on prescription drugs. While dif
ferent in their coverage, both plans attempt
to create prescription discounts for people
who are not covered by employer-provided
or government health insurance. Prop. 80
deals with the issue of regulation of elec
tricity providers. Perhaps this last proposi
tion seems unworthy of your time. But con
sider fora second how many appliances
you have plugged into the wall sockets of
your room. Now raise your hand if you like
rolling blackouts.
It Does Matter
You might think that redistricting or
how a union can use money in politics is a
minor issue and is too technical to care.
These issues are actually surprisingly sim
ple to understand, and they have wide
ranging effects. For example, if the redis
tricting process changes, it may change the
ratio of Democrats and Republicans from
California in the House of Representatives,
and it may reshape the California political
landscape for decades. Will you allow oth
ers to make that choice for you?
And.finally, if none of these issues get
you going but you don't want to vote at
home, there is a practical reason to register
to vote in California. Hypothetically (and
only hypothetically), you may eventually
be interested in attending graduate school
at Cal. Registering to vote and voting in
California will help you establish Califor
nia residency.
The Daily editorial board will analyze
all these issues more thoroughly as the elec
tion nears, so turn back here if the jargon
confuses you. But you can't wait until two
days before the election to decide to vote,
you have to register now.
If you plan to vote at home, research
your state's last day to register (it's an easy
Google search), and contact your county
for an absentee ballot immediately. If you
plan to vote in California, register to vote
by Oct. 24, a week from Monday, by picking
up a registration form in Old Union. Above
all, make your voice heard on Nov. 8. This
election does matter.
