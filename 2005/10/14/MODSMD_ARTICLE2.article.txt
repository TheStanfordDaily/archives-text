## The 						Rundown BATTLE IN THE DESERT Cardinal look to keep things rolling at Arizona 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford (2-2,1-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) takes the field in TUscon tomorrow
to face Arizona (1-4,0-2), the question for
head coach Walt Harris and the Cardinal
will be: which Stanford team is going to
show up?
Will it be the squad that picked up road
victories against Navy and Washington
State and easily moved the ball up and down
the field? Or will it be the team that scored
just one offensive touchdown in two home
losses against UC-Davis and Oregon?
Clearly, the Cardinal are hoping to ride
the success of last week's 24-21 victory over
the Cougars in Pullman, Wash. Senior quar
terback Trent Edwards had arguably one of
the best performances of the year, throwing
for 257 yards, three touchdowns and no in
terceptions. He also led the team in rushing
with 92 yards.
Stanford's offensive performance was
stunning considering the two previous
games. In their two home losses, the Cardinal
struggled to move the ball, picking up just
412 yards of total offense combined in the
two contests.The offense enjoyed more than
that in the Washington State game alone.
While the offense showed much im
provement against Washington State, the
defense also stepped up its game. One week
after setting a new school record by throw
ing for 531 yards against Oregon State, the
Cardinal defense held Washington State
quarterback Alex Brink to only 161 yards.
"We had a good week of practice and fo
cused really hard," junior cornerback Nick
Sanchez said earlier this week. "The Oregon
game was an eye-opener that we needed to
work on certain things and work hard. We
needed to focus if we wanted to win in this
league. We played a lot better against Wash
ington State than we did against Oregon."
Stanford needs to have another strong
offensive showing if it wants any success
against the Wildcats. Arizona, a team the
Cardinal haven't faced since 2(K)2, has one
of the best pass defenses in the Pac-10 and
the Wildcats put it on display last weekend
against No. 1 USC. Despite dropping the
game 42-21, the Wildcats were just one score
down heading into the fourth quarter.
"When you watch the tape [of last Satur
day's USC-Arizona game] and you see the
score 28-21 [in favor of USC], you say
'Whoa'. Obviously, Arizona has good per
sonnel on defense," Harris said. "They make
you drive it; they hardly give up any big
plays. Even as explosive of a team that USC
is, they made them drive it."
While Arizona has yet to pick up its first
Pac-10 win of the season, the Wildcats look to
be a team on the rise. Second year head coach
Mike Stoops, brother of Oklahoma coach
Bob Stoops, is looking to turn around a team
that hasn't made a bowl since 1998 and has
finished as one of the bottom three teams in
the conference for the last four years.
Leading the charge offensively for the
Wildcats is sophomore Richard Kovalcheck.
He set a new career high against USC,
throwing for three touchdowns. On the sea
son he has already thrown for 10 scores.
"Their quarterback [Kovalcheck] has
some good size with experience under his
belt," Harris said.
Despite the talk of the Wildcats' im-

Junior receiver Mark Bradford has been the Cardinal's most reliable threat this season, reeling in 110 yards and
two touchdown in Stanford's 24-21 win over Vyashington State last weekend.

Wildcats a team on the rise

provements, Arizona is still a team
that is likely finish near the bottom
of the league. The Wildcats one win
this season came over a non-Dl-A
opponent in Northern Arizona, and
they were shut out by California.
Arizona has also had difficulty
running the ball this season. As a

team, it averages just 81 yards per
game on the ground. Meanwhile, the
defense is giving up well over 200
yards per game in the same category.
While Arizona has struggled, the
Cardinal know that they can't let up
their guard against any team in the
Pac-10.

"This conference is almost unbe
lievable," Sanchez said. "Every
body's got great running backs, a
good quarterback, a few good re
ceivers and a tight punt returner.The
talent in this league is amazing. It's
fun to get out there and compete
with these guys."
