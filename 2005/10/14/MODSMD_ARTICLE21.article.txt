# Athletes? Well, probably
## 
### 
Everyone's got a smartass friend these
days. Ours was being particularly fresh
this weekend. But this time, instead of
sticking with her usual topics, ripping new
cracks for blondes, fat people and your mom.
she decided to focus on a new and complete
ly undeserving target: Us.
"So," she said. "Y'all are the new athlete
voice around here."
"Sure."
There's no doubt we deserved what came
next. We'd been wearing our cocky "we're
the ones with the Daily column even though
you're the smartass friend," smiles around all
week. We were cruisin'. Fora bruisin', that is.
She struck first. "That's crazy! You guys
aren't even real athletes."
At this point, we walked into the Cruise
Inn Cafe, sat on bar stools, put our hands in
our pockets and ordered a Bruisin sandwich,
extra ketchup, with a heaping side of Shoul
da-seen-this-coming.
"Sure we are," we replied. She gave us the
patented smartass friend eye-roll. We could
n't resist. We had to ask. "Ok, so what do ath
letes have that we don't have?"
"Oh, I don't know... Skills?" She proceed
ed to make her case, presenting us with a
laundry list of our coordination woes. It was
n't pretty.

Exhibit A: Football, basketball, baseball,
Softball, tennis, water polo, land polo, rugby
and chess players can catch. Cassidy can't.
Throw something at her and one of two
things could happen. One, she misses it com
pletely and takes one to the nose. Two, she
sees it. ducks, stands up, squints, cringes, flails
her arms around, misses it completely and
takes one to the nose.
Exhibit B: Real athletes have barbaric
manly injuries. Headlining Kevin's list of
most serious injuries is one fairly traumatic
walking accident which left him with a
bruised ego and a broken toe. In a close sec
ond comes the head-on bike collision with
the Stanford Post Office that was only a few
plastic explosives short of a federal offense.
Notice that neither of these injuries has any
thing to do with sports.
Exhibit C: We're gonna go ahead and skip

Exhibits C through W. (If you really want the
play-by-play, we'll have you know that after
taking a hit on A, Band C, our conversation
al wizardry kicked in at D, carrying us to a
solid finish and fully convincing smartass
friend that divers are athletes too. Go team.)
We are athletes. We go without sleep,
showers and spring break in order to do
what we love. Some of us can catch. Some of
us can't. Some of us run fast. Some of us
don't. Some of us hold our breaths for
ridiculous amounts of time and splash
around in the pool while smiling like
Cheshire cats. Some of us think that's crazy.
But the thing is, we're all athletes. We do the
hard work and the early mornings. We play
for love of the game. Pain is temporary,
pride is forever. There's no crying in base
ball. If you build it they will come. Feel the
rhythm, feel the rhyme, come on Jamaica,
it's bobsled time. Aaaadriannn!
Besides, who other than two athletes
would spend their Friday night watching
sports movies to research for this
column...and still get chills six hours later
when Air Bud saves the day?

We caught you a delicious bass. Wanna play
