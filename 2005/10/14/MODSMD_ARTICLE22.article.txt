## Prop. 73 would have dire consequences 
### LYNNE ROSEN 
Although abortion was legalized in the
United States over 30 years ago, this by no
means ensures that all Americans have ac
cess to safe, legal abortions. This Novem
ber, Proposition 73 will be on California's
ballot and, if passed, could have dire conse
quences for California's teenagers. Prop. 73
would mandate that health care providers
contact the parents of women under the
age of 18 before providing abortion servic
es. Additionally, Prop. 73 would require a
48-hour waiting period after talking to the
teen's parents before an abortion could be
performed.
On the surface, Prop. 73 might sound
reasonable. Everyone, of course, would
hope that teens could confide in their par
ents and get advice in all situations, includ
ing that of an unintended pregnancy. Re
search shows that the majority of teens do,
in fact, talk to their parents when faced
with this situation. However, it is the teens
who are most vulnerable that don't have
this option — those teens who live in abu
sive situations, are pregnant due to rape or
incest or fear that telling their parents
about their situation would result in get
ting beaten or thrown out of their home.
For this group of teens. Prop. 73 could re
sult in delayed medical care or could cause
teens to turn to the Internet or friends to
find unsafe ways to end their pregnancies.
One must only look at the multitude of

dangerous abortions already being at
tempted in the United States due to lack of
access to see what could happen if Prop. 73
were to pass. In 2005, in Lufkin,Tex„ a 17-
year-old woman asked her boyfriend to
help her end her pregnancy by jumping on
her stomach and punching her. The preg
nancy was "successfully" terminated. Simi
lar tragic situations most certainly will
occur if teens are robbed of the right to a
confidential abortion.
Second-year Stanford medical student
and Med Students for Choice student
leader Kate Pettit worked for Planned Par
enthood this past summer. There, she en
countered many teens that Prop. 73 would
impact. One such teen's story is here relat
ed in Pettit's words:
"She sat nervously on the edge of her
seat in the counseling room, wrapped in a
sweatshirt despite the warm temperatures
in the office. She carried a wad of $20 bills
in her pocket with which to pay for her pro
cedure that day. She could have been my
little sister — blond hair, summer shorts
and a tank top. She had come alone and
had sat in the corner of the waiting room
throughout the morning. She had obvious
ly made a conscious decision to make this
day a private one.
"In my role as a pre-abortion counselor,
I discussed with her the procedure that she
had chosen. Some questions were simple.
She wanted to know how big the needle
was for the anesthetic. I pulled an example

from a drawer to show her. Some questions
were not so simple, because of the weight
behind them. She wanted to know if any
one would be able tell later on that she had
had this procedure done. When 1 asked her
if she had told her parents of her decision,
a question we were required to ask all
teens, her eyes grew wide.
"'There is no way I can do that,' she
said. They will kill me.'
"Despite her strong words, I encour
aged her to speak to her family at some
point, even if just for support. But 1 made
clear that our time together and the
records at our clinic were completely con
fidential by law and that her decision to in
volve her family was her choice. As part of
the providing team, I cannot imagine tak
ing that choice away from young women.
"Later, in the recovery room. I helped
the same woman to locate and call a local
shelter where she could stay for several
days, to recover on her own. She did not feel
comfortable going back to her family's
home until she felt completely well, and I re
spected her decisions. I cannot fathom how
voters who do not know this woman or her
situation could force her to share her expe
rience with her parents. She is not these vot
ers' daughter, nor their sister, nor their
friend. The only person that should be able
to make that choice is the woman herself."
The American Civil Liberties Union
and many medical organizations such as
the American Medical Association, the

American Academy of Family Physicians
and the American C ollege of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists have opposed Prop. 73
due to the negative impact it would have
on teens' health. The American Academy
of Pediatries has issued a statement which
says that "mandating parental notification
does not achieve the intended benefit of
promoting family communication, but it
does increase the risk of harm to the ado
lescent by delaying access to appropriate
care."The academy's statement is based on
research conducted in states where similar
restrictive laws have been enacted. For ex
ample, after a parental notification law was
passed in Minnesota, second-trimester
abortions increased by 27 percent. After
the first eight weeks of pregnancy, the risk
of major complications from abortion in
creases 15 to 30 percent with each week of
delay. Parental consent laws are putting
teens in jeopardy

due to the negative impact it would have
on teens' health. The American Academy
of Pediatries has issued a statement which
says that "mandating parental notification
does not achieve the intended benefit of
promoting family communication, but it
does increase the risk of harm to the ado
lescent by delaying access to appropriate
care."The academy's statement is based on
research conducted in states where similar
restrictive laws have been enacted. For ex
ample, after a parental notification law was
passed in Minnesota, second-trimester
abortions increased by 27 percent. After
the first eight weeks of pregnancy, the risk
of major complications from abortion in

Although abortion was legalized in the
United States over 30 years ago, this by no
means ensures that all Americans have ac
cess to safe, legal abortions. This Novem
ber, Proposition 73 will be on California's
ballot and, if passed, could have dire conse
quences for California's teenagers. Prop. 73
would mandate that health care providers
contact the parents of women under the
age of 18 before providing abortion servic
es. Additionally, Prop. 73 would require a
48-hour waiting period after talking to the
teen's parents before an abortion could be
performed.
On the surface, Prop. 73 might sound
reasonable. Everyone, of course, would
hope that teens could confide in their par
ents and get advice in all situations, includ
ing that of an unintended pregnancy. Re
search shows that the majority of teens do,
in fact, talk to their parents when faced
with this situation. However, it is the teens
who are most vulnerable that don't have
this option — those teens who live in abu
sive situations, are pregnant due to rape or
incest or fear that telling their parents
about their situation would result in get
ting beaten or thrown out of their home.
For this group of teens. Prop. 73 could re
sult in delayed medical care or could cause
teens to turn to the Internet or friends to
find unsafe ways to end their pregnancies.
One must only look at the multitude of

dangerous abortions already being at
tempted in the United States due to lack of
access to see what could happen if Prop. 73
were to pass. In 2005, in Lufkin,Tex„ a 17-
year-old woman asked her boyfriend to
help her end her pregnancy by jumping on
her stomach and punching her. The preg
nancy was "successfully" terminated. Simi
lar tragic situations most certainly will
occur if teens are robbed of the right to a
confidential abortion.
Second-year Stanford medical student
and Med Students for Choice student
leader Kate Pettit worked for Planned Par
enthood this past summer. There, she en
countered many teens that Prop. 73 would
impact. One such teen's story is here relat
ed in Pettit's words:
"She sat nervously on the edge of her
seat in the counseling room, wrapped in a
sweatshirt despite the warm temperatures
in the office. She carried a wad of $20 bills
in her pocket with which to pay for her pro
cedure that day. She could have been my
little sister — blond hair, summer shorts
and a tank top. She had come alone and
had sat in the corner of the waiting room
throughout the morning. She had obvious
ly made a conscious decision to make this
day a private one.
"In my role as a pre-abortion counselor,
I discussed with her the procedure that she
had chosen. Some questions were simple.
She wanted to know how big the needle
was for the anesthetic. I pulled an example

from a drawer to show her. Some questions
were not so simple, because of the weight
behind them. She wanted to know if any
one would be able tell later on that she had
had this procedure done. When 1 asked her
if she had told her parents of her decision,
a question we were required to ask all
teens, her eyes grew wide.
"'There is no way I can do that,' she
said. They will kill me.'
"Despite her strong words, I encour
aged her to speak to her family at some
point, even if just for support. But 1 made
clear that our time together and the

fidential by law and that her decision to in
