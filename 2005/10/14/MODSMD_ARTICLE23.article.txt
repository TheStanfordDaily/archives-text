"I don't get no respect!"
"I don't get no respect!" In the words of Rodney
Dangerfield, that's exactly how I feel every time I pick
up The Stanford Daily and read yet another under
graduate's commentary about Stanford's graduate
students. I don't pick up The Daily very often, but
whenever I do, descriptions such as "shady," "sketchy"
and, most recently, "un-cool" for wearing helmets
around campus seem to litter your pages (see "Maybe
helmets aren't so bad", Oct. 13).
If the undergraduates took a few seconds to think
before stereotyping a large proportion of this cam
pus, perhaps they'd realize a few things. Like shady
graduate students were once shady undergrads
(don't tell me you all haven't encountered that
sketchy girl or guy in your dorm, class or bar). And
although we realize that wearing a bike helmet isn't
the most fashionable thing to do, many graduate stu
dents commute from that far away land known as
"off-campus," unlike the undergrads who only ride
from one side of the Stanford Bubble to the other.
While your greatest risk commuting each day is sim
ply falling off of your bike, mine is falling off of my
bike and then getting run over by a car. I shouldn't
have to defend myself or the actions of my fellow
graduate students. But when I'm dealing with class
es, labwork, teaching and maintaining my sanity in
Palo Alto, the last thing I need is being made fun of
by some undergraduate.
To be fair, I've gotten to know some great under
graduates in my short time here. If you even tried, you
might meet some great graduate students as well. And
the next time you're so quick to judge, just remember:
for all you undergraduates thinking about graduate
school, karma is a bitch.
