## ESPN: It's not just sports 
### 
So I was watching ESPN the other day, and at
the end of Sportscenter, the programming
changed to the World Series of Poker. For
those of you not familiar with the event, it's the most
reputed poker tournament in the world. I'm not
here to talk about the game of poker, though. I only
bring it up because of something one of the an
nouncers for the show said.
In speaking about the length of time that the
players spend sitting at the table and the extreme
concentration it takes to win. there was a comment
that "these players are at the peak of their mental
abilities. You've really got to bring it to compete in
this sport."
You've got to be kidding me. Poker, a sport! For
Pete's sake, Steven Hawking can play poker. The
only motion required is moving your hand. You can
be so disgustingly obese (and many players are) that
Tony Siragusa thinks you should go on a diet.
I'm not angry at ESPN for showing poker. It is,
after all, the Entertainment AND Sports Program
ming Network. I happen to play poker, and I find it
enjoyable and exciting. However, we've got to work
on this misconception that everything shown on
ESPN is a sport. What follows is a small list of things
I've seen on ESPN that clearly belong in the "enter
tainment" category.
Atop the list: auto racing. Any activity that re
quires the use of an internal combustion engine to
compete is simply not a sport. I'm sorry, but the
power has to come from the competitor. These are
my rules, you're free to disagree, but I really don't
see the sporting nature of Chevy vs. Ford. Don't get
me wrong, I think the drivers are extremely compe
tent at what they do, and that's the use of a highly
developed set of skills. America clearly finds it en
tertaining, however, as it's more popular than ever.
Still, I don't see the entertainment in watching 40
cars make left turns for 400 miles. Honorable men
tion goes out to dirt bike racing, drag racing and
horse racing.
Next: ice dancing. Please don't misconstrue my
words as critical of the extreme dedication and tal
ent possessed by the individuals who choose to
wreck their childhoods starting at 4 a.m. on the day
of their fifth birthday. Ice dancing is entertainment
because there's no standard rule or goal to obtain.
The judging, while mostly consistent (see: French
judge, Olympics 2002), is completely subjective.
Sure, baseball has balls and strikes, football has
penalties and basketball has fouls but these are all
ancillary to the goal of scoring points. In ice dancing,
there is no absolute way to get ahead or fall behind
in the competition. Not a sport.
At least the athletes in these first two maintain
their bodies in some semblance of shape. From here
on out, though, you can fail your physical by not
being able to get the blood pressure cuff around
your arm and still be the best in the world in the fol
lowing activities
The National Spelling Bee. Do I really even need
to explain this one? T\vo years ago, some kid
blacked out on stage and still managed to spell the
word correctly. Impressive, yes. Respectable, yes.
Sport, no. While some may find
spelling wildly entertaining (ooh.did
you see how sharp little Joey was on
that silent "e"?), spelling is a skill.
You don't even have to move for this
one. If your mouth works, you're a
competitor. Why don't we just teach
an ape sign language and sign her
up? (Insert obligatory stupid ape
movie featuring Matt Le Blanc
here.) Honorable mention goes out
to chess, which for essentially the
same reason, belongs not as a sport,
but as a battle of wits.
Fishing...wow. What a fierce war
this is. When the goal of your activity
is to outsmart a species whose brain
is one tenth the size of your own and
you fail most of the time, it makes for
poor entertainment, much less a
sport. Most of the time, the camera is
panning around looking for some
thing, ANYTHING, to move. Not
only is this not sporting, it's down

right dull. If you want fishing to be a
sport, someone should change the
rules so that the fish can get even.
Honorable mention, here, of course,
to any sort of hunting and rodeo
events.
Finally, the one that really puts
the "ra!" in crappy â€” cheerleading.
When did we decide that speaking in
unison to a beat was competitive?
For the same reason that ice dancing
falls short, cheerleading is not a
sport. Additionally, the fact that you
cannot keep individual statistics on a
competitor makes this even stupid
er. Calling competitive cheering a
sport is like giving your mother a
medal for yelling the loudest at any
high school contest in which you've
ever participated. They're in great
shape and show a lot of coordination
and highly developed body control,
but it's still not a sport.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to
go warm up for IM Beirut.
