If any game is a must-see match fora Car
dinal fan, it's Stanford against California. It
should be no different this Saturday at Mal
oney Field, where fans are expected to pack
the stands as No. 19 Stanford (8-3-1,2-0-0 Pa
cific-10 Conference) faces long-time rival No.
11 California (9-2-1,2-0-0).
The home crowd has been an influential
factor in motivating the Cardinal this season,
as Stanford notched its last four victories at
home. In particular, Stanford's recent upset
of No. 5 Santa Clara (11-2-1) this season saw
the eighth largest crowd ever at Maloney
Field. The players are hoping fora similar
turnout to encourage them this weekend.
"There's always a lot of energy when
you're playing at home," senior midfielder
Martha West said. "I think as a team we get up
for the game more; there's more excitement
in air."
ITiough Stanford currently holds these

rics lead with a record of 12-8-3 against its
cross-Bay rivals,there Is very little to separate
the two teams this season. Along with almost
identical win-loss records, the Golden Bears
and the Cardinal enter the match atop the
Pac-10, after each swept the Washington
schools over the weekend. Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe is anticipating a tough
match ahead.
"[Our game] against Cal will be a battle,"
Ratcliffe said. "[lt is] always an emotional
game, very physical. |but] we're going to set
tle the ball down and make it our game where
we play good possession soccer and try to
break them down and not get into a fight."
While the fans are expecting to witness a
high-intensity, grueling match, it is unlikely
for Saturday's game to be a goal-fest. Both
Cal's and Stanford's goalies have been in out
standing form this season.The Bears' keeper,
senior Ashley Sulprizio, and Cardinal fresh
man Alex Gamble are leading the conference
with six shutouts a-picce.
And while the Cardinal are currently on a

five-game win-streak and playing in excellent
form, they are still striving to improve their
finishing and score more goals, especially
against the solid Cal defense.
"I still think we have a long way to go,"
Ratcliffe noted." We have a lot of progress we
could make.The team wants to get better and
better.They want to win by two or three now,
so that's a good sign for the future."
Stanford looks to sophomore
defender/midfielder Rachel Buehler, last
week's Pac-10 player of the week, and co-cap
tain defender Haley Hunt, who was named to
the Top Drawer Soccer National Team of the
Week, to lead the charge against the Bears.
However the team's young new talents, in
cluding freshman Kate Mannino — who
played an influential role in the previous
weekend's victories — are also excited and
rearing to play against their bitter rivals.
"We're just going to keep doing the same
thing," Mannino, a midfielder/forward, said.
"Definitely keep possession, get a lot of balls
wide and definitely trv to finish them."
