# Card at NCAA tune-up
## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
One month from now the Cardi
nal cross country squads are sched
uled to compete for the three top
spots at the NCAA West Regional
Championship in order to earn auto
matic entry to the NCAA Champi
onship. The outlook appears good,
which is why the team has been invit
ed to the Pre-NCAA Invitational
this weekend to run on the same
course as the Nov. 21 Championship.
Tomorrow's meet inTcrre Haute.
Ind., serves as a preview of the na
tional championship and matches all
of the top-ranked teams in the na
tion. Representing the western re
gion, the Cardinal are joined by
Washington. Arizona, Arizona State
and UCLA
"This is an important meet,"
Hdrick Floreal, director of cross coun
try. said. "Anyone that has a chance to
win nationals will try it out this week
end to see what they can do."
While teams like UCLA doubt to
earn an automatic bid at Regionals,
and must perform well this weekend
in pursuit of an at-largc bid, the Car
dinal can focus on learning the
course in preparation for November.
"Barring something really bad
happening we should advance auto
matically," Floreal said.
Last year, both squads won the re
gional championship, and with this
season's record to date, a repeat of
last year is on the horizon.
The women are undefeated in
team competition, while the men
have earned first-place finishes at
every meet except the USF Invita

tional. where Arizona finished 11
points ahead.
According to Floreal. in the west
region, Arizona State and Arizona
are potential threats to both the men
and women's squads. But he added
that it is always difficult to predict
who will give the Cardinal the most
competition.
"We have so many good athletes
that we can prepare them for what
ever the course is," Floreal said. "But
sometimes having a good team does
n't mean anything. Some teams do
terrible on flat courses and some do
terrible on hilly courses."
The race site tomorrow is the offi
cial NCAA-approved LaVern Gib
son Championship Course at Indi
ana University - it comes with all of
the nuances of a classic cross country
course.
"We don't know what the weath
er will be like," Floreal said. "If it's
cold the grass will be hard, making
the course faster. If it's damp, it will
make the grass damp and the course
slower."
For the women, sophomores Ari
anna Lambie and Teresa McWalters
look to lead the team to a strong fin
ish. Junior twins Katy and Amanda
TYotter have both had winning sea
sons so far, and should be at the front
of the pack on Saturday.
On the men's side, senior David
Vidal plans to be in contention for
the meet title. Juniors Jonathan
Pierce and Jacob Gomez, along with
sophomore Russell Brown — who
all finished in the top eight last
weekend at the Murray Keatinge In
vitational — plan to run tomorrow
as well.
