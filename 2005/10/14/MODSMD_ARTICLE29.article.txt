### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend, the Stanford field
hockey team (4-11) lost two tough
games against No. 1 Wake Forest and
No. 3 North Carolina. This week, the
Cardinal are looking to reverse their
fortune and do it with authority
against Northern Pacific Conference
rival Longwood (4-8).
"We're in the mood to crush a team
right now," freshman forward/mid
fielder Caroline Hussey said.
The team fell 6-1 to the Demon
Deacons and 4-0 to the Tar Heels last
weekend, with senior midfielder
Missy Halliday providing the sole
goal. The Cardinal were able to pick
up a victory on their trip to the East
Coast, easily handling the Davidson
Wildcats, 5-1.
According to head coach Lesley
Irvine, the team isn't particularly dis
appointed by its performance against
the Wake Forest and UNC teams.
"Despite the outcomes, we really

made a lot of improvements," Irvine
said. 'Tn both games, our second half
performance indicated that we can
play at that level."
Hussey also remains optimistic
regarding the tough games.
"Besides the scores, we did com
pete and held our own against them,"
Hussey said. "We did get experience.
And it was a positive experience that
will carry over against Longwood."
Hussey leads the team offense
with 13 points this season (six goals
and one assist) and attributes her
success to being unfazed about play
ing a varsity college sport.
"I told myself that I couldn't let
inexperience not let me perform,"
Hussey said."l expect to play as I did
my senior year of high school and
score as much as I can."
Hussey also fares well among the
entire NorPac conference, placing
seventh in points earned and eighth
in goals scored. California junior for
ward Valentina Godfrid tops the
NorPac list with 49 points.

Senior midfielder Alexis Ramey.
who has garnered seven goals and
one assist this season, leads Long
wood's offense. Also on the roster is
NorPac co-defensive player of the
week, junior defender Katie Mur
phy. Murphy made two defensive
saves for the Lancers in their confer
ence win over Appalachian State.
The Cardinal currently have a win
percentage of .S(H) in the NorPac
conference, tying them for fourth
with Longwood. Stanford has a
league record of 2-2, while Long
wood is 1-1.
As the season draws to a close,
freshman forward/midfielder Chloe
Bade hopes the squad elevates its
level of play and succeeds during up
coming tough conference play.
"It is sad that this season is com
ing to an end." Bade said. "The team
has been amazing and this has been a
great experience. Luckily, we still
have some intense conference games
coming up, and 1 expect us to do real
ly well."
