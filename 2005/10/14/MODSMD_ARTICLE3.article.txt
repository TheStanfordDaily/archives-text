# Bradford answers critics
## Injuries thrust junior receiver into a critical role in the Cardinal passing offense 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Before this year's football
season kicked off, naysayers
claimed Stanford lacked explo
sive playmakers at skill posi
tions and predicted the Cardinal
would finish dead last in the con
ference. After star 6-foot-7 wide
receiver Evan Moore injured his
hip the first game of the season,
the pessimists only doubled in
volume. Stanford's next oppo
nent was UC-Davis, and soon
after that meltdown, many na
tional media agreed Stanford
football had no shot at compet
ing in the Pacific-10 Conference,
let alone winning a game.
Naysayers, meet Mark Brad
ford.
The negativity only grew as
Bradford's 2005 campaign start
ed slowly. The junior receiver
caught only four balls for 51
yards in his first two contests this

season. Despite the criticism,
Bradford knew he had better
performances inside of him.
"Early on, I wasn't doing as
well as I thought I should have
been," Bradford said. "Lately
though, I've been playing the
way I want to play."
Indeed, the last two games
have seen Bradford return to the
stellar form of his earlier playing
days. First came a visit from Ore
gon, where Bradford caught
seven passes from senior quar
terback TYent Edwards for 110
yards, including a two-yard
touchdown reception in the first
quarter.
"The touchdown was a fade
route in the end zone," Bradford
said. "It's one of those passes
we've been working on in prac
tice a lot, so I kind of was ready
for it. When I got there, I was
looking at the defender and he
was playing me inside. Trent just
threw the ball on a really perfect
throw that made it look easy."
Despite Bradford's individual ef
fort, Stanford lost to Oregon by 24
points, leaving a sour taste in the re
ceiver's mouth. However, the Los
Angeles native would not have to
wait long for redemption.
One week later, Stanford trav
eled to Washington State as a 13-
point underdog, in large part be
cause of questions about the passing
game. Three Edwards touchdown
passes and 257 aerial yards later,
Stanford left Washington State as
three-point victors, 24-21.
Bradford only caught four balls in
the narrow victory, but he made
those catches count, as two of his re
ceptions went for first- and third
quarter scores.
"The first touchdown was on an

option route," said Bradford, who
leads the squad with 199 receiving
yards and three touchdowns this sea
son. "The defender was playing man
to-man and the guy kind of over
played me, so I went to the out route.
It was another perfect throw by
Trent. The last touchdown was also
an out route."
Surprising fora receiver of Brad
ford's acumen, the contest against
the Cougars marked the first multi
touchdown game of Bradford's
Stanford career.
"It was really exciting to score
twice, especially the first touchdown
and the last touchdown of the game,"
said Bradford, who has racked up
1,321 yards and seven touchdowns in
his two-plus years at Stanford. "It
was really special."
Ever humble, Bradford was quick
to praise his quarterback for his
strong arm, accuracy and composure
in the pocket.
"A lot of guys would shy away
from the hits that he's taken and go
into a shell, but he still goes out there
and is accurate," Bradford said.

Despite lining up at wide receiver
on the gridiron, Bradford knows a
little bit about how to pass accurate
ly. He played guard on Stanford's
varsity basketball team his freshman
year. Although he dropped basket
ball this past winter in order to focus
on football and schoolwork, Brad
ford still draws comparisons be
tween the two sports.
"'[Tie biggest similarity to me is
it's all hard work," Bradford said.
"That's the little difference that
causes a team to be on the winning or
on the losing side. Also, a lot of the
things like zone offenses or defenses
in basketball can relate to football,
especially at my position of wide re
ceiver."
For now, Bradford is focusing
solely upon Stanford football. As far
as his future is concerned, though, he
still clings to his ultimate dream â€”
catching passes in the NFL.
"I'd really like to play with the In
dianapolis Colts," Bradford said.
"They get the balls to a lot of re
ceivers, and I think it would be good
playing with Peyton Manning."
