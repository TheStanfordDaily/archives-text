BETSY CONGDON and CALEY ANDERSON
INTERMISSION'S AWESOME EDITORS
Caley: So, uh, Betsy, we were supposed to interview everyone
this issue. Why haven't we interviewed ourselves? Obviously
our lives are way more interesting than high-profile celebrities
like Cameron Crowe. I mean, really, being a part of that in
terview wasn't the highlight of my week or anything. It's not
like he's on my list of the top 10 coolest people of all-time.
Betsy: Fuck you. I only got to run to the Bookstore and buy a
tape recorder so you could transcribe the stupid interview.
...And it still was the highlight of my week.
C: The highlight of your week could have been going to Sky
walker Ranch. Only you gave the assignment to Josh.
B: Damn it.
G Sometimes being a good person sucks. That's why I try to
limit my good deeds t0... [begins to count on fingers] three?
B: Three? That doesn't even make sense. Now you're just
making shit up.
C: Dude, lying is a sin.
B: You don't go to church.
C: Solid point. Let's move on. How was your week?
B: Well, I only slept through half of my classes. My attendance
is definitely up from the one-fourth attendance of last year.
C: I, for one, couldn't be prouder. There's nothing like the
feeling of achieving a goal.
B: It was pretty tight to be in the Bunnies on Wednesday.
C: Hmm. I didn't read the Bunnies. Let's move on to topics
that I can relate to.
B: The rest of the week was spent here at Intermission. Well, I
did go to Happy Donuts. And the Dorm Gov meeting was,
like, wow.
C: Oh. That's not quite the same as being married to Nancy
Wilson and directing some pretty sweet movies. I've never
even heard of Happy Donuts.
B: Do you live in a cave?
C: No, Toyon. I spent my week here, too. Though, yesterday

Vanessa and Cara actually came to the Daily's office to do
chemistry with me. I have some pretty amazing friends. And
my roommates definitely put up with not seeing me. Oh! And
I did go to Theta Delt for special dinner. There was some pret
ty shitty karaoke, but I did learn how to count to seven in
Japanese.
B: Theta Delt is a very educational place.
C: They're all pretty awesome. I talked to one of my best
friends from home this afternoon.
B: Awww, that's sweet. How is she?
C: Her dad had a pulmonary embolism on Monday and his left
lung collapsed, so she was actually pretty bummed.
B: (silence)
C: I mean, he's doing better now. Shit. I ruined the interview.
Umm... umm... I talked to my mother today and our new fire
place was installed?
B: I'm still kinda bummed.
C: I finally used the collapsible Tupperware that my mom gave
me for my birthday. It is bright green and can either be com
pletely flat or a large storage container for food.
B: Tupperware?
C: You should come by and see it. It's pretty mind-blowing.
[Answers phone and has a short conversation] Sorry. I bet
George Lucas doesn't get drunk-dialed by his friends. The guy
that just called me bought a 'C is for Crunk' shirt for his PWR
teacher. How tight is that?
B: Wow. Maybe our week wasn't as interesting as a celebrity's.
C: I took a nap today. Unintentionally.
B: Yeah, no.
C: Well, that's all I got for you.
B: 1 fixed the printers in Tresidder today.
C: Yeah, we're done.
