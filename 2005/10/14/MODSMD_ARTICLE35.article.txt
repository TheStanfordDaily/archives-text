## Because McCarthy was a dick 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION COMMIE 
Shot in black, white and cigarette
smoke, George Clooney's "Good
Night, and Good Luck" gives vivid
life to a newsman's fight against Sena
tor Joseph McCarthy's witch-hunt
tactics in what must be the smartest
movie in this pre-Oscar Season year.
More than a staid and placid retelling
of the well-known story of Mc-
Carthy's malevolent anti-Communist
purges, "Good Night" sheds light on
the human drama within the CBS
newsroom of the era while sending a
subtle cautionary tale to today's tele
vision news producers and viewers.
David Strathairn gives an excel
lent performance as Edward Murrow.
his diction and facial mannerisms set
in the buttoned-down syncopation of
the 19505. Thankfully, Strathairn
never allows trite emotionalism to slip
though Murrow's stern facade. Just as
his viewers in 1953 would have, we in
the audience prefer our newsmen to
exude impartiality.
Clooney's direction transfers the
'50s vibe to the screen with expert
skill. With sharp-talking characters
who insist on trampling on one anoth
er's dialogue and frequent breaks in

the action for sultry jazz songs and dis
tasteful cigarette commercials, we are
reminded at all times that we are
watching 1953 television.
The story begins as Murrow, with
the aid of his producer, the aptly
named Fred Friendly (Clooney), and
colleagues (Robert Downey Jr., Patri
cia Clarkson and Ray Wise among
them) air an editorial on the popular
news program "See It Now" chastis
ing McCarthy's bullying and untruth
ful tactics. The fallout of this initial re
port is swift, as corporate sponsors
balk and Murrow's and Friendly's
boss loudly disapproves of this display
of partisanship. Murrow, undaunted,
keeps the heat on McCarthy, who
predictably accuses the newsman of
being a Communist sympathizer. The
newsroom becomes a breeding
ground for fear of governmental retri
bution that Murrow must navigate
successfully.
Though McCarthy's story has
been told numerous times, "Good
Luck" makes two supremely intelli
gent decisions, allowing it to steer
clear of unoriginality. First, it inserts
actual footage of McCarthy, ensuring
that the audience never feels that the
on-screen senator is ridiculous to the
Doint of disbelief. Secondly, and

more importantly, the action stays en

newsroom. This narrowing of focus
enables the film to display the tangi
ble difficulties faced by McCarthy's
enemies and encourages the applica
tion of the film's lessons to today.
Indeed, in a flash-forward se
quence in which Murrow receives an
award, he reminds his audience that
TV must do more than "en
