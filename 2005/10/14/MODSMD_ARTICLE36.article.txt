In the opening frame of "Domino," director Tony Scott ("Tirue
Romance," "Man on Fire") informs as that "This is based on a true
story...sort of." The reason he added the "sort of," apparently, is
that Domino Harvey's life was not actually a music video.
Don't get me wrong, to its credit, the movie — practically an
index of every camera movement and effect possible — would
make a good music video if its first five and last five minutes were
spliced together. Everything in between could have been left on
the cutting room floor.
"Domino" becomes little more than an advertisement for it
self starting at the opening credits when sequences from the
movie you're about to see play behind the characters' names.
Throughout, Scott (Ridley's brother) overplays the strengths
that he demonstrated in "Tine Romance": creating short, emo
tionally impacting, violent scenes while simultaneously convey
ing their absurdity.
This film is just absurd.
The real Domino Harvey, daughter of actor Har

come a bounty hunter in the late 1980's. She had been involved
with the project for 12 years until her death last September from
an "accidental" drug overdose. Reports that Harvey wasn't
happy with the final product come as no surprise; fora film about

a character trying to escape her movie star lifestyle, "Domino"
is chock full of Hollywood conventions.
It includes the übiquitous confusing mob involvement, gra
tuitous explosions and cutesy one-liners. Domino herself,
played by the monotonously aloof and sullen Keira Knightley,
seems to be taking off her shirt in every other scene. On her first
bounty-hunting mission, she defuses a standoff with LA gang
bangers by giving one of them a lap dance. In the next, she's rid
ing a mechanical bull. The only real suspense in the film is
whether Knightley will go completely topless (she does). This
portrayal of Domino's life as a bounty hunter includes every
thing she was trying to get away from.
It adds up to the feel of a movie you've seen before. In addition to
the I lollvwiKxl cliches, lines are literally repeated, either with an echo
or a different camera angle. Entire scenes reappear later in the film to
remind you of what you've seen in the previous hour. You get the
sense that Scott gagged screenwriter Richard Kelly ("Donnie
Darko") and bound him to a chair, then proceeded to cut out every
