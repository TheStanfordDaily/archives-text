'Domino'
Dir. Tony Scott
L -

In the opening frame of "Domino," director Tony Scott ("Tirue
Romance," "Man on Fire") informs as that "This is based on a true
story...sort of." The reason he added the "sort of," apparently, is
that Domino Harvey's life was not actually a music video.
Don't get me wrong, to its credit, the movie — practically an
index of every camera movement and effect possible — would
make a good music video if its first five and last five minutes were
spliced together. Everything in between could have been left on
the cutting room floor.
"Domino" becomes little more than an advertisement for it
self starting at the opening credits when sequences from the
movie you're about to see play behind the characters' names.
Throughout, Scott (Ridley's brother) overplays the strengths
that he demonstrated in "Tine Romance": creating short, emo
tionally impacting, violent scenes while simultaneously convey
ing their absurdity.
This film is just absurd.
The real Domino Harvey, daughter of actor Har
vey, eschewed her privileged Beverly Hills background to be
come a bounty hunter in the late 1980's. She had been involved
with the project for 12 years until her death last September from
an "accidental" drug overdose. Reports that Harvey wasn't
happy with the final product come as no surprise; fora film about

a character trying to escape her movie star lifestyle, "Domino"
is chock full of Hollywood conventions.
It includes the übiquitous confusing mob involvement, gra
tuitous explosions and cutesy one-liners. Domino herself,
played by the monotonously aloof and sullen Keira Knightley,
seems to be taking off her shirt in every other scene. On her first
bounty-hunting mission, she defuses a standoff with LA gang
bangers by giving one of them a lap dance. In the next, she's rid
ing a mechanical bull. The only real suspense in the film is
whether Knightley will go completely topless (she does). This
portrayal of Domino's life as a bounty hunter includes every
thing she was trying to get away from.
It adds up to the feel of a movie you've seen before. In addition to
the I lollvwiKxl cliches, lines are literally repeated, either with an echo
or a different camera angle. Entire scenes reappear later in the film to
remind you of what you've seen in the previous hour. You get the
sense that Scott gagged screenwriter Richard Kelly ("Donnie
Darko") and bound him to a chair, then proceeded to cut out every


line of the script, mix them up, throw half of them out and repeat
the other half.
"I'm Domino Harvey." Knightly says, six times in the preview
and countless more in the movie. Unfortunately, that's about as
well as we get to know her. "My agenda is to kick ass and get the
bounty." This is about as deep as she gets.
We don't get to know anybody else, either. Every time a char
acter is introduced his name is emblazoned in white next to his
face, along with overdone "Snatch' Mike clips of that character.
But these function more as bad jokes than exposition.
It begins with Domino in an interrogation room with a detec
tive (Lucy Liu), and the rest of the story unfolds the convoluted
plot that got her there. Luckily, we have Knightly's narration to
describe what's going on. She repeats things characters have al
ready said, sometimes summarizing scenes that we have just
been shown. The filmmakers even resort to a flow chart of char
acters to explain what is happening in a plot that eventually caves
in on itself. The predictable climax is inexplicably given away by
a seer who resembles Metallica's James Hetfield.
It is appropriate that the movie is about bounty hunters: In
stead of asking you to come along with it.the film hits you over
the head and drags your carcass along. In one sequence. Knight
ly licks her lips as one of her associates. Choco (Edgar Ramirez),
undresses in a Laundromat. Scott zooms in on Choco's abs eight
separate times. Uh, Tony? We get it.

Christopher Walken, playing a
TV producer whose secretary
describes him as a "ferret on
crystal method," is
the only saving
grace.
It's en- _
tertaining
just listening >- Jfci
to him say
words like *3lkV|'
ICi

On the plus side, she gets naked

sponds, "that
doesn't make
any sense." Of
the 90210 boys,
a mob boss asks,
"What the fuck
are they doing
here?" Good
question.
Domino cuts off
a man's right
arm because a
part of her boss'

makes him even harder to understand than usual.
The score is more frenetic, alternating between raps with
lyrics like "I don't want to love you, I just want to fuck you" and
sappy strings sections, making it seem like Scott is trying to play
our emotions like a cheap whore.
The strangest thing about "Domino," though, is its attempt to
provide social commentary, in the form of a clip from "Springer,"
the presence of two 90210 actors and the smashing of numerous
televisions. But the movie is a product of the attention deficit cul
ture it is trying to satirize.
The best part about the movie is that it points out its own
flaws. Domino explains a plot point, then agrees when Liu re

repeated directive is cut off by cell phone static. (Don't worry,
I'm not ruining anything — I already mentioned Keira's nude
scene). Maybe Scott repeats everything because he believes
there is static between him and his audience. We hear you fine,
Tony. We just have no idea what you're trying to say.
"If you're wondering what's true and what's not, fuck off, be
cause 1 won't tell you," Domino says at end of movie. But she
tells us everything, down to the smallest plot point.
A more fitting epitaph comes from Liu.
"You have no one to blame but yourself." she tells Domino.
The same will be true of you if you see this movie.

bangers by giving one of them a lap dance. In the next, she's rid
ing a mechanical bull. The only real suspense in the film is
whether Knightley will go completely topless (she does). This
portrayal of Domino's life as a bounty hunter includes every
thing she was trying to get away from.
It adds up to the feel of a movie you've seen before. In addition to
the I lollvwiKxl cliches, lines are literally repeated, either with an echo
or a different camera angle. Entire scenes reappear later in the film to
remind you of what you've seen in the previous hour. You get the
sense that Scott gagged screenwriter Richard Kelly ("Donnie
Darko") and bound him to a chair, then proceeded to cut out every


line of the script, mix them up, throw half of them out and repeat
the other half.
"I'm Domino Harvey." Knightly says, six times in the preview
and countless more in the movie. Unfortunately, that's about as
well as we get to know her. "My agenda is to kick ass and get the
bounty." This is about as deep as she gets.
We don't get to know anybody else, either. Every time a char
acter is introduced his name is emblazoned in white next to his
face, along with overdone "Snatch' Mike clips of that character.
But these function more as bad jokes than exposition.
It begins with Domino in an interrogation room with a detec
tive (Lucy Liu), and the rest of the story unfolds the convoluted
plot that got her there. Luckily, we have Knightly's narration to
describe what's going on. She repeats things characters have al
ready said, sometimes summarizing scenes that we have just
been shown. The filmmakers even resort to a flow chart of char
acters to explain what is happening in a plot that eventually caves
in on itself. The predictable climax is inexplicably given away by
a seer who resembles Metallica's James Hetfield.
It is appropriate that the movie is about bounty hunters: In
stead of asking you to come along with it.the film hits you over
the head and drags your carcass along. In one sequence. Knight
ly licks her lips as one of her associates. Choco (Edgar Ramirez),
undresses in a Laundromat. Scott zooms in on Choco's abs eight
separate times. Uh, Tony? We get it.

Christopher Walken, playing a
TV producer whose secretary
describes him as a "ferret on
crystal method," is
the only saving
grace.
It's en- _
tertaining
just listening >- Jfci
to him say
words like *3lkV|'
ICi

On the plus side, she gets naked

sponds, "that
doesn't make
any sense." Of
the 90210 boys,
a mob boss asks,
"What the fuck
are they doing
here?" Good
question.
Domino cuts off
a man's right
arm because a
part of her boss'

makes him even harder to understand than usual.
The score is more frenetic, alternating between raps with
lyrics like "I don't want to love you, I just want to fuck you" and
sappy strings sections, making it seem like Scott is trying to play
our emotions like a cheap whore.
The strangest thing about "Domino," though, is its attempt to
provide social commentary, in the form of a clip from "Springer,"
the presence of two 90210 actors and the smashing of numerous
televisions. But the movie is a product of the attention deficit cul
ture it is trying to satirize.
The best part about the movie is that it points out its own
flaws. Domino explains a plot point, then agrees when Liu re

repeated directive is cut off by cell phone static. (Don't worry,
I'm not ruining anything — I already mentioned Keira's nude
scene). Maybe Scott repeats everything because he believes
there is static between him and his audience. We hear you fine,
Tony. We just have no idea what you're trying to say.
"If you're wondering what's true and what's not, fuck off, be
cause 1 won't tell you," Domino says at end of movie. But she
tells us everything, down to the smallest plot point.
A more fitting epitaph comes from Liu.
"You have no one to blame but yourself." she tells Domino.
The same will be true of you if you see this movie.

'Domino'
Dir. Tony Scott
L -

In the opening frame of "Domino," director Tony Scott ("Tirue
Romance," "Man on Fire") informs as that "This is based on a true
story...sort of." The reason he added the "sort of," apparently, is
that Domino Harvey's life was not actually a music video.
Don't get me wrong, to its credit, the movie — practically an
index of every camera movement and effect possible — would
make a good music video if its first five and last five minutes were
spliced together. Everything in between could have been left on
the cutting room floor.
"Domino" becomes little more than an advertisement for it
self starting at the opening credits when sequences from the
movie you're about to see play behind the characters' names.
Throughout, Scott (Ridley's brother) overplays the strengths
that he demonstrated in "Tine Romance": creating short, emo
tionally impacting, violent scenes while simultaneously convey
ing their absurdity.
This film is just absurd.
The real Domino Harvey, daughter of actor Har
vey, eschewed her privileged Beverly Hills background to be
come a bounty hunter in the late 1980's. She had been involved
with the project for 12 years until her death last September from
an "accidental" drug overdose. Reports that Harvey wasn't
happy with the final product come as no surprise; fora film about

a character trying to escape her movie star lifestyle, "Domino"
is chock full of Hollywood conventions.
It includes the übiquitous confusing mob involvement, gra
tuitous explosions and cutesy one-liners. Domino herself,
played by the monotonously aloof and sullen Keira Knightley,
seems to be taking off her shirt in every other scene. On her first
bounty-hunting mission, she defuses a standoff with LA gang
bangers by giving one of them a lap dance. In the next, she's rid
