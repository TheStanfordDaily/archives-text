## Your life is not complete without the joyous sounds of Jeezie 
### ADAM HAHN INTERMISSION GOOLGER 
This past week, I had the opportunity to sit
down with Roble freshman Tim Fleming, aka
Tim-Jeezie. For those of you who don't know
why interviewing a Roble freshman is rele
vant, perhaps you recall an email that may
have been sent to your dorm s chatlist around
Admit Weekend proclaiming the arrival of
"Tim-Jeezie," an up-and-coming hip-hop
lyricist. Or maybe just a kid who downloaded
some instrumental off Kazaa, Googled some
lyrics and recorded into his computer's mic.
This was not the first time I had met Tim, ei
ther. No, for Tim-Jeezie was my Pro Fro from
Admit Weekend 2(X)5. I was the one who
spammed the list. And once again, I'm sorry,
Tim.
INT: Thanks for sitting down with me, Tim.
Tell me, what's an average day like for an un
derground superstar?
TJ: Hmm, 1 guess it's mainly just hanging out
in 1C... See, you didn't want to do this. I'm
actually a really boring person.
INT: Ah, I disagree. The public loves your

six releases. Do you have any plans for future
singles? An album?
TJ: See, I feel bad. You're writing about all
old stuff. If I make a new song, it'll just hap
pen. 1 don't even listen to rap any more.
INT: How did a kid like you, starting with so
little in his upper-middle class SoCal neigh
borhood achieve the underground medioc
rity that literally dozens love today?
TJ: What? Dude, you filled that up with so
much bullshit, I missed the question.
INT: Sorry. How did you get to where you
are today? How did your friends react?
TJ: Let 's see...lt all started with me covering
"Lose Yourself." 1 sent it to my friend (who's
now a crazy bitch), and things just exploded.
My friends sent it to their friends. I knew it
was pretty bad when my math teacher played
it in class. I still remember the day I put out
"Get Low." That was a good day.
INT: Technically, your recordings have in
creased in quality over time. Tell me about
that.
TJ: Yeah, for "Disco Inferno" I got a new
recording program. All of them were done in
one take.
INT: Somehow, this does not surprise me.

TJ: I have a question for you though: how did
you find all this stuff before I even came to
Stanford?
INT: Well, I think I Googled "Tim Fleming"
and found your persona "Tim-Jeezie" men
tioned somewhere. The rest is fairly boring
history.
TJ: That's so creepy that you found that. So
creepy.
INT: Yeah, sorry about all that... How do
you feel about performing live?
TJ: 1 don't do concerts. If I did. then I might
start receiving some heavy criticism. There's
a big difference between recording and per
forming. This is a pretty diverse
campus...and my high school had like 10
black people in it.
INT: Well, once again, thanks for talking.
Your story will inspire generations...of
karaoke thugs.
TJ: Ha. hell yes. I wouldn't want it any other
way.
Tim's music can be found at

not Googling ProFros, he can he reached at

The mean streets of Escondido, CA were hard on young
Jeezie: the three bullets he has taken are a constant re
minder of the thug life.

INT: Well, I think I Googled "Tim Fleming"
and found your persona "Tim-Jeezie" men
tioned somewhere. The rest is fairly boring
history.
TJ: That's so creepy that you found that. So
creepy.
INT: Yeah, sorry about all that... How do
you feel about performing live?
TJ: 1 don't do concerts. If I did. then I might
start receiving some heavy criticism. There's
a big difference between recording and per
forming. This is a pretty diverse
campus...and my high school had like 10
black people in it.
INT: Well, once again, thanks for talking.
Your story will inspire generations...of
karaoke thugs.
TJ: Ha. hell yes. I wouldn't want it any other
way.
Tim's music can be found at
http://jcezie.does.il. To catch Adam when he's
not Googling ProFros, he can he reached at
adamhahn@stan ford. edu.


The mean streets of Escondido, CA were hard on young
Jeezie: the three bullets he has taken are a constant re
minder of the thug life.
