### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION DOWN LOADER 
As this is the issue where Intermis
sion interviews everyone, I set out at
the Download Music Festival last Sat
urday to interview as many random
people as possible about, well, con
certs. And I really meant to. As my
friends who accompanied me to the
show can attest to, I wrote out a long
list of questions, some insightful, a
few funny and most not really funny
at all. I even brought my trusty re
porter's notebook and a pen with a lot
of ink left.
And then I remembered how
much I hate people who drink at con
certs.
Now, before you get on your high
horse and throw around words like
"hypocrite" or "who do you think you
are: Sister Mary-alcohol-kills-pup

pies-and-rainbows?" â€” I don't hate
drunken people. Just those who
choose to do it at a concert. This is
equal-opportunity hatred, too, and
therefore not limited to just alcohol. I
hate anyone who gets fucked-up on
any substance at a show.
Live music is my happy place (al
though 1 have never been to a Hilary
Duff show, so I cannot attest that it
exists there, too), and someone
drunkenly spilling beer on my sweat
shirt or elbowing me in the face as he
stumbles down the lawn is, frankly,
unacceptable. As is screaming at the
top of your lungs words that are not
only not part of the song, but proba
bly not English. You know who you
are.
Maybe someone can explain to me
the merits of imbibing large quanti
ties of $14margaritas, $9 shots and $5
beers at an amphitheatre, because as

of right now, I don't get it. Usually I
am able to clearly see both sides of an
issue, but I am having trouble under
standing why getting trashed and
then starting a mosh pit in the lawn
seating area and bumping into other
people and stepping on others' hands
is considered a good time. If 1 had
wanted to go to a frat party, I would
have stayed on campus and saved my
self $30.
The audience members were defi
nitely not the only ones who chose to
ingest substances Saturday night. I
feel 1 can say with some confidence
that just about every band playing
was on one drug or another. How else
do you explain the keyboardist from
British Sea Power running around the
amphitheatre playing a tom-tom
while wearing a white knit hat with a
pom-pom that made him look like a
i . newborn baby and a palm-frond

stuck down his shirt? The song ending
didn't stop him, either. He kept play
ing long after the rest of the band had
left the stage.
1 did see a teenager wearing a
matching hat. Coincidence? Conspir
acy? Idiocy? You decide.
The fashion choices made by
British Sea Power were so atrocious it
distracted from the music. This isn't
to say their set was good. The high
light of the hour was the bass line on
the very first song. It was all downhill
after that. Only adding insult to injur)'
was their clothes. The lead singer's
(white) pants appeared to be bleed
ing, and the guitarist's shirt should be
a crime against humanity.
The Doves, apparently, were quite
good. I missed most of their set be
cause I attempted to buy an extra
small shirt fora friend and not only
managed to strike out at every vendor

in the stadium, but was cut in front of
by two large drunk men. I bet you can
guess how that made me feel. Howev
er, my friends did hit the jackpot at
the Trojan condom wheel, and if you
ever need a Mint Tingle condom,
there are about 50 in my drawmate's
room.
What I saw of The Doves was nice,
but not memorable. They all had
scraggly, unkempt, long stringy hair,
but it wasn't nearly as distracting as
the previous band's attire.
The Arcade Fire's entire goal, on
the other hand, was to be as distract
ing as possible. It was at this point that
I witnessed one of the worst concert
etiquette faux pas of my life: people
ran down to the edge of the lawn and
stood in front of everyone else for

Don't be a drunk asshole

about two songs, and then sat down as
if they had been there all along. I pret
ty much hated all of them, too. I did no
tice. however, a direct correlation be
tween blood-alcohol level and the need
to run in front of everyone and block
any view they could have had at the
stage. Go figure.
The lead singer of The Arcade Fire
was the only thing I liked about their
set. He was intense, professional and
the only member who seemed to have
his shit together. The rest of the band

pretended to beat each other up. ran
around, interpretively played the tam
bourine and fostered a general sense of
creepiness. They also continually
switched instruments, which I actually
think is awesome, but will hate them
for because I decided when I was 15
that if I were to start a band we would
all play each other's instruments
throughout the set. Copy cats.
I really enjoyed Modest Mouse.
Their set was more melodic and con
tained a few mellow jam sessions,

which was surprising considering when
I saw them in August it was all scream
ing-headache-inducing-pounding
music. It was during this set, however,
that a group of drunk, lost yuppies in
their thirties invaded my personal bub
ble and spent half of the set loudly talk
ing. Why are you here? Obviously you
have no desire to listen to the show. Yet
another thing I do not understand.
Then came the highlight of the
evening: The Killers. I am not that fa
miliar with their music or have any real

knowledge of the band, so I will freely
admit that when Brandon Flowers
walked out on stage I swooned a little.
The man is beautiful. And the entire
band was completely smashed. Flowers
knocked over the drummer's mics mul
tiple times and the guitarist had to be
picked up off the ground a few times
and then led off-stage at the end. Their
drunken antics were amusing, however,
because the music they produced was
lively and engaging. I respect anyone
who can effectively wield a guitar or
keyboard at that level of drunkenness,
because I sure as helTcouldn't.
They put on quite a show and were
definitely the right band to end the all
day festival. And then everyone on the
lawn decided it would be really fun to
throw their seat cushions towards the
front section, as we all love being pelt
ed by plastic squares of foam. Well,
maybe you do. But, please, don't go to
any show I do, because 1 don't want to
hate you, too.
