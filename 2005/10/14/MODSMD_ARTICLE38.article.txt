### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION DOWN LOADER 
As this is the issue where Intermis
sion interviews everyone, I set out at
the Download Music Festival last Sat
urday to interview as many random
people as possible about, well, con
certs. And I really meant to. As my
friends who accompanied me to the
show can attest to, I wrote out a long
list of questions, some insightful, a
few funny and most not really funny
at all. I even brought my trusty re
porter's notebook and a pen with a lot
of ink left.
And then I remembered how
much I hate people who drink at con
certs.
Now, before you get on your high
horse and throw around words like
"hypocrite" or "who do you think you
are: Sister Mary-alcohol-kills-pup

pies-and-rainbows?" â€” I don't hate
drunken people. Just those who
choose to do it at a concert. This is
equal-opportunity hatred, too, and
therefore not limited to just alcohol. I
hate anyone who gets fucked-up on
any substance at a show.
Live music is my happy place (al
though 1 have never been to a Hilary
Duff show, so I cannot attest that it
exists there, too), and someone
drunkenly spilling beer on my sweat
shirt or elbowing me in the face as he
stumbles down the lawn is, frankly,
unacceptable. As is screaming at the
top of your lungs words that are not
only not part of the song, but proba
bly not English. You know who you
are.
Maybe someone can explain to me
the merits of imbibing large quanti
ties of $14margaritas, $9 shots and $5
beers at an amphitheatre, because as

of right now, I don't get it. Usually I
am able to clearly see both sides of an
issue, but I am having trouble under
standing why getting trashed and
then starting a mosh pit in the lawn
seating area and bumping into other
people and stepping on others' hands
is considered a good time. If 1 had
wanted to go to a frat party, I would
have stayed on campus and saved my
self $30.
The audience members were defi
nitely not the only ones who chose to
ingest substances Saturday night. I
feel 1 can say with some confidence
that just about every band playing
was on one drug or another. How else
do you explain the keyboardist from
British Sea Power running around the
amphitheatre playing a tom-tom
while wearing a white knit hat with a
pom-pom that made him look like a
i . newborn baby and a palm-frond

stuck down his shirt? The song ending
didn't stop him, either. He kept play
ing long after the rest of the band had
left the stage.
1 did see a teenager wearing a
matching hat. Coincidence? Conspir
acy? Idiocy? You decide.
The fashion choices made by
British Sea Power were so atrocious it
distracted from the music. This isn't
to say their set was good. The high
light of the hour was the bass line on
the very first song. It was all downhill
after that. Only adding insult to injur)'
was their clothes. The lead singer's
(white) pants appeared to be bleed
ing, and the guitarist's shirt should be
a crime against humanity.
The Doves, apparently, were quite
good. I missed most of their set be
cause I attempted to buy an extra
small shirt fora friend and not only
managed to strike out at every vendor

in the stadium, but was cut in front of
by two large drunk men. I bet you can
guess how that made me feel. Howev
er, my friends did hit the jackpot at
the Trojan condom wheel, and if you
ever need a Mint Tingle condom,
there are about 50 in my drawmate's
room.
What I saw of The Doves was nice,
but not memorable. They all had
scraggly, unkempt, long stringy hair,
but it wasn't nearly as distracting as
the previous band's attire.
The Arcade Fire's entire goal, on
the other hand, was to be as distract
ing as possible. It was at this point that
I witnessed one of the worst concert
etiquette faux pas of my life: people
ran down to the edge of the lawn and
stood in front of everyone else for
