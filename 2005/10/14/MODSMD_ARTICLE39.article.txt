## You're never too old to play with legos... or call your mom 
### ANDREW BURMON INTERMISSION INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER 
I'd been trying to put together an interview with
Brendan Powell Smith, the creator of The Brick Tes
tament — a biblical illustration series done entirely
in Legos — for almost two weeks. He seemed recep
tive. His e-mails were friendly. Unfortunately, I have
no car, so 1 couldn't get to his home in Mountain
View. I bided my time until Wednesday, when an
editor could drive me. I sent him an e-mail saying 1
would try to come by this evening. Alas, he wasn't
going to be around.

It wasn't
anybody's fault,
unless you
want to pin

the blame
on me,
which I
think
seems rea
sonable
because
I'm fairly
disorga
nized. Ei
ther way,
them-

terview wasoi't going to
happeoi. So I was a little
on edge when I got a call
from Caley. my editor
and friend, because I
was going to have to tell
her that a page of her
magazine would end up
empty.
"Hey." she
said."How are you?"
She really meant it
too; she is a very decent
sort of person.
"I'm fine," I feigned
casual. "About the in
terview..." Jjjd
That is actually not
the real dialogue, but
she did call and it went
something like that and
we did decide that in
stead of actually inter
viewing Brendan Powell
Smith, I could hypothet-j
ically interview him. By
doing both sides of the

interview, I could eliminate any need for an actual in
terviewee*
My friend Joel pointed out that this might stretch
the bounds of journalistic integrity.

"That's fucking ridiculous," Joel said.
He made a good point. So I thought about
it and decided that certainly there might be
other people I would rather hypothetically in
terview: God, Jesus, Woody Allen or that kid
I was friends with fora week in middle
school who showed me how to use a cross
bow. These would all make for good hypo
thetical interviews.
But, as Joel puts it, it's ridiculous. So I de
cided that because Intermission is an arts

and culture magazine. I would interview
the painter who has had the most effect on
my life and on my outlook.
Intermission: Hey Mom, how are you?
Monu I'm tired. I got up at 4:30 a.m. to
take dad to the airport. He's in Colorado.
INT: Why are you still awake?
Mom: Because the phone rang. I was

wouldn't go
well. But
there have
to be some
women to
interview.
Maybe
Queen Vic
toria, but I'd
probably
r«e
with her too
much.
INT: I think
it would be
cool to in
terview the
dog.
Mom: I in-

just getting in bed. What's
up?
INT: Well remember that
mterview 1 said 1 was going
to do? It fell through ami
now I have to do a creative
hypothetical interview of.
well, anyone.
Mom: What?
INT: It's exactly what it
sounds like.
Mom: Oh. (pause) You
could say that you once fan
tasized about interviewing
Hemingway in a bar in
Idaho and it went poorly
and he punched you. That
was the Carleton applica
tion essay right?
INT: Right, but I'd rather
not revisit that. Who would
you interview?
Mom: Who would I inter
view? Oh ray god. Of course
1 would interview Jesus, but I
wouldn't go there. It would
take too much care and it

would be too easy to screw up. I actually would like to
interview Van Gogh. God, I'm so tired I can't even
think straight. Maybe Copernicus, or Da Vinci. Da
Vinci would be awesome to interview. I'd like to in
terview Thomas Edison, but he doesn't hear. That

You know you wish you'd thought of this first. Just
think of the fame, glory and riches that could be
yours if only you liked Legos or the Bible.

terview him all the time and he just says the same
thing every time. He's looking at me. There go the
eyebrows. And his eyes are shutting. He's getting fun
nier as he gets older.
INT: 1 could interview you.
Mom: How boring, "I'm going to interview my moth
er." That's ridiculous. 1 can't even begin to think
straight. You could interview Manny Ramirez. You
wouldn't have to write much. Is this supposed to be a
serious interview?
INT: It's not supposed to be serious, but it shouldn't
be too ridiculous.
Mom: I'm trying to think of someone admirable who
is alive. So many celebrities are such jerks. It's really
slim pickings, isn't it. There is someone I was thinking
about the other day, but I can't remember who it was.
Now I'll be awake trying to think of who you could in
terview.
INT: I actually came up with a good idea; I could in
terview somebody about who I should interview with
out telling them that it was the interview.
Mom: Oh that would work. Yeah that would work re
ally well. And if it doesn't work I think you could write
something fun and interesting and make people think
about who they would interview. I still think that
would make a very nice article. It's a very interesting
thought.
INT: Who do you think Dad would interview?
Mom: Probably a lot of baseball guys and maybe au
thors too. Maybe Dos Passos or MLK. Oh I know
who I'd like to interview: Watterson who wrote
Calvin and Hobbes; he just seems so deep somehow.

Anyway as far as Dad goes... I don't
know.
INT: Actually its fine. I'm done with my
interview
Mom: OOOOOOOH! You were inter
viewing me without my knowing.
Shows how tired 1 am.You are such a lit
tle shit. I didn't even catch on.
[Phone Beeps]
Mom: Must be Grandma Jean.
Grandma: Oh hello David.
Mom: It's not David.
INT: It's Andrew.
(>randma: Oh Mazel Tov, I heard you
wrote an article. Well, I'll use the phone
later.
[Hangs Up]
Mom: There you go. That is an end for
your article.

straight. You could interview Manny Ramirez. You
wouldn't have to write much. Is this supposed to be a
serious interview?
INT: It's not supposed to be serious, but it shouldn't
be too ridiculous.
Mom: I'm trying to think of someone admirable who
is alive. So many celebrities are such jerks. It's really
slim pickings, isn't it. There is someone I was thinking
about the other day, but I can't remember who it was.
Now I'll be awake trying to think of who you could in
terview.
INT: I actually came up with a good idea; I could in
terview somebody about who I should interview with
out telling them that it was the interview.
Mom: Oh that would work. Yeah that would work re
ally well. And if it doesn't work I think you could write
something fun and interesting and make people think
about who they would interview. I still think that
would make a very nice article. It's a very interesting
thought.
INT: Who do you think Dad would interview?
Mom: Probably a lot of baseball guys and maybe au
thors too. Maybe Dos Passos or MLK. Oh I know
who I'd like to interview: Watterson who wrote
Calvin and Hobbes; he just seems so deep somehow.

Anyway as far as Dad goes... I don't
know.
INT: Actually its fine. I'm done with my
interview
Mom: OOOOOOOH! You were inter
viewing me without my knowing.
Shows how tired 1 am.You are such a lit
tle shit. I didn't even catch on.
[Phone Beeps]
Mom: Must be Grandma Jean.
Grandma: Oh hello David.
Mom: It's not David.
INT: It's Andrew.

wrote an article. Well, I'll use the phone
later.

Mom: There you go. That is an end for
your article.




I'd been trying to put together an interview with
Brendan Powell Smith, the creator of The Brick Tes
tament — a biblical illustration series done entirely
in Legos — for almost two weeks. He seemed recep
tive. His e-mails were friendly. Unfortunately, I have
no car, so 1 couldn't get to his home in Mountain
View. I bided my time until Wednesday, when an
editor could drive me. I sent him an e-mail saying 1
would try to come by this evening. Alas, he wasn't
going to be around.

It wasn't
anybody's fault,
unless you
want to pin

the blame
on me,
which I
think
seems rea
sonable
because
I'm fairly
disorga
nized. Ei
ther way,
them-

terview wasoi't going to
happeoi. So I was a little
on edge when I got a call
from Caley. my editor
and friend, because I
was going to have to tell
her that a page of her
magazine would end up
empty.
"Hey." she
said."How are you?"
She really meant it
too; she is a very decent
sort of person.
"I'm fine," I feigned
casual. "About the in
terview..." Jjjd
That is actually not
the real dialogue, but
she did call and it went
something like that and
we did decide that in
stead of actually inter
viewing Brendan Powell
Smith, I could hypothet-j
ically interview him. By
doing both sides of the

interview, I could eliminate any need for an actual in
terviewee*
My friend Joel pointed out that this might stretch
the bounds of journalistic integrity.

"That's fucking ridiculous," Joel said.
He made a good point. So I thought about
it and decided that certainly there might be
other people I would rather hypothetically in
terview: God, Jesus, Woody Allen or that kid
I was friends with fora week in middle
school who showed me how to use a cross
bow. These would all make for good hypo
thetical interviews.
But, as Joel puts it, it's ridiculous. So I de
cided that because Intermission is an arts

and culture magazine. I would interview
the painter who has had the most effect on
my life and on my outlook.
Intermission: Hey Mom, how are you?
Monu I'm tired. I got up at 4:30 a.m. to
take dad to the airport. He's in Colorado.

Mom: Because the phone rang. I was

could say that you once fan

Hemingway in a bar in
Idaho and it went poorly
and he punched you. That
was the Carleton applica
tion essay right?
INT: Right, but I'd rather
not revisit that. Who would
you interview?
Mom: Who would I inter
view? Oh ray god. Of course
1 would interview Jesus, but I
wouldn't go there. It would
take too much care and it

would be too easy to screw up. I actually would like to
interview Van Gogh. God, I'm so tired I can't even
think straight. Maybe Copernicus, or Da Vinci. Da
Vinci would be awesome to interview. I'd like to in
