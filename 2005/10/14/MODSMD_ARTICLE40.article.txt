## Elizabthtown': it's no 'Say Anything,' but it isn't 'Vanilla Sky' 
### DI DANG INTERMISSION ELIZABETHAN 
Following upon his critically acclaimed,
though commercially unsuccessful, "Almost Fa
mous," Cameron Crowe has created another
semi-autobiographical film, "Elizabethtown."
However, the film has completed the film festi
val circuit to lackluster reviews, forcing Crowe
to frantically re-edit the film to increase its main
stream audience appeal.
As a result, "Elizabethtown" sabotages its
ability to effectively convey some kind of deep
er philosophical meaning about life, for the
aforementioned critics, nor impart upon the au
dience any sense of emotional fulfillment. This
does not necessarily translate into a "bad"
movie though, since despite this conflict, "Eliza
bethtown" still manages to both enlighten and
entertain.
In the movie Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom)
has just suffered a devastating fall from his orig
inal enviable status as the young and rising star
of a successful shoe company. Having designed
"Spasmotica" a sneaker that was supposed to
"revolutionize the shoe industry" but instead re
sulted in an utter debacle,(for surely, any athlet
ic shoe that sounds like a pathogenic microor
ganism with the word "spasm" in its name is a
sure winner) Drew has caused the company to
lose $972 million.
This is a figure so monumentally phenome
nal that it is repeated several times throughout
the film, in an effort to evoke a few laughs. "How
can 1 best explain this to you?" Phil (Alec Bald
win), Drew's boss and the CEO, tells him before
firing him, "It's so much that it might as well be
$1 billion." Though the opening scenes are
meant to establish the full extent to which Drew
has completely and utterly failed, they overstay
their welcome as caricatures of soulless corpora-

tions and quickly
exhaust any inher
ent coniedic value.
Drew returns to
his apartment and
proceeds to assem
ble a most inventive
contraption of sui
cide comprised of a
huge knife and a
stationary' cycle. As
he prepares to liter
ally bike himself to
death, his cell
phone fatefully in
tervenes — his sis
ter, Heather (Judy
Greer), has called
to inform him that
their father has un
expectedly died of a
heart attack in the
eponymous title
town and asks him
to travel to Ken
tucky to retrieve his
body.
Drew reluctant
ly agrees and extri
cates himself from
his bike of death,
but not before vow
ing to finish his mis-

sion upon returning. However, while on a sur
prisingly empty red-eye flight to Louisville.
Drew meets Claire Colburn (Kirsten Duust), an
irrepressiblv cheerful and persistent flight atten
dant. Despite his taciturnity, Claire perkily initi
ates a conversation with Drew anyway and
draws him a map outlining the intricate roads to
Elizabethtown. The next morning, as Drew exits

the flight, he discov
ers Claire's number
on the back.
Upon arriving in
Elizabethtown, Drew
is instantly enveloped
by the community
and his relatives. De
spite having never
met Drew before, the
familial connection is
there — "This is your
blood" — and that is
all the Baylors re
quire before welcom
ing him so completely
as a part of that
strangely honest and
sincere unit. Having
been so busy for the
>ast two years with his

career. Drew experiences a culture shock from
being thrust wholly into an entirely different
world.
Faced with such an inundation of love and
concern. Drew begins to realize the extent of his
prior loneliness, and he calls everyone whom he
believed cared for htm before. The one person
available, of course, is Claire, and they begin a
conversation that stretches over the course of
several hours, illustrated through a cliched mon
tage of inaudible epiphanies and the classic line
"1 can't believe I'm telling you this!"
It is obvious from the moment Claire appears
in the film, putting on her uniform and straight
ening her hair, that she will play a significant role
in Drew's life. However, "Elizabethtown" is not
the type of film you watch exclusively for the
ending, as it is fairly apparent from the begin
ning how it will end — it is the type of film that
you watch for the moments of true clarity in be
tween the beginning and the end.
With "Elizabethtown," Crowe endeavors to
encapsulate life in its most humblest terms, not
in the grand cosmic definition of "Life," but life
as the, perhaps paradoxical, intricate simplicity
of day-to-day living. Crowe, who excels in both
understanding and conveying humans in all
their greatness and failure, recognizes that al
though there is some merit to analyzing the uni
versal concept of "Life/ there is a greater beau :

ty in just living.
Crowe has a talent for capturing these mo
ments and interactions and presenting them to
the audience as the true substance of life. Pay at
tention to the scene in which Drew and Claire al
most kiss at the gas station and to the entire re
ception scene at the hotel the night of the funer
al. When Hollie (Susan Sarandon), performs a
soft shoe routine to the tinny, almost trembling,
instrumental version of "Moon River" as a trib
ute to her late husband, Crowe imbues a scene
that could have easily been ridiculous with a
poignant realism.
It is scenes like these throughout the film that
resonate most deeply and come so close to com
pletely redeeming the film from some of its
shortcomings. The ending of the film wildlv
spins out into its own ridiculous tangent, suc
cumbing to implausible plot points. The charac
ter of Claire also is a contrived cliche in itself.
Although Dunst is a revelation as Claire, she
cannot overcome the material. However, she
does create an intricate and attractive character
as a result of idiosyncrasies, kindness and pcr
ceptiveness, making it easy for the audience to
understand how Drew can so quickly fall in love
with her. How Claire can fall in love with the
woodenly passive Drew though, is unknown.
Despite Dunst's commendable perfor
mance, the character is inherently flawed in that
she is not believable as a real human, especially
considering that the principle strength of the
film itself is its foundation in the earthly reality
of life, not in the too perfect movie world where
Qaire would belong. Claire conflicts with the
essence of the film to the extent that she seems
to have been inserted into the plot as a Beatrice
to Drew's Dante.
Thus "Elizabethtowir is a conflicted film.
Does it target critics or mainstream audiences?
Should it present life with an extraordinary clar
ity or pander to the typical expectations of how
a movie should make you feel?
Crowe is actually quite adept at combining
these seemingly disparate objectives, and the re
sult can be magnificent when he strikes a perfect
balance, as he did in "Almost Famous." Unfor
tunately. the pervasive schism here between re
alness and forced reality prevents "Elizabeth
town" from being as good as it could be.

sincere unit. Having
been so busy for the
>ast two years with his

career. Drew experiences a culture shock from
being thrust wholly into an entirely different
world.
Faced with such an inundation of love and
concern. Drew begins to realize the extent of his
prior loneliness, and he calls everyone whom he
believed cared for htm before. The one person
available, of course, is Claire, and they begin a
conversation that stretches over the course of
several hours, illustrated through a cliched mon
tage of inaudible epiphanies and the classic line
"1 can't believe I'm telling you this!"
It is obvious from the moment Claire appears
in the film, putting on her uniform and straight
ening her hair, that she will play a significant role
in Drew's life. However, "Elizabethtown" is not
the type of film you watch exclusively for the
ending, as it is fairly apparent from the begin
ning how it will end — it is the type of film that
you watch for the moments of true clarity in be
tween the beginning and the end.
With "Elizabethtown," Crowe endeavors to
encapsulate life in its most humblest terms, not
in the grand cosmic definition of "Life," but life
as the, perhaps paradoxical, intricate simplicity
of day-to-day living. Crowe, who excels in both
understanding and conveying humans in all
their greatness and failure, recognizes that al
though there is some merit to analyzing the uni
versal concept of "Life/ there is a greater beau :

ty in just living.
Crowe has a talent for capturing these mo
ments and interactions and presenting them to
the audience as the true substance of life. Pay at
tention to the scene in which Drew and Claire al
most kiss at the gas station and to the entire re
ception scene at the hotel the night of the funer
al. When Hollie (Susan Sarandon), performs a
soft shoe routine to the tinny, almost trembling,
instrumental version of "Moon River" as a trib
ute to her late husband, Crowe imbues a scene
that could have easily been ridiculous with a
poignant realism.
It is scenes like these throughout the film that
resonate most deeply and come so close to com
pletely redeeming the film from some of its
shortcomings. The ending of the film wildlv
spins out into its own ridiculous tangent, suc
cumbing to implausible plot points. The charac
ter of Claire also is a contrived cliche in itself.
Although Dunst is a revelation as Claire, she
cannot overcome the material. However, she
does create an intricate and attractive character
as a result of idiosyncrasies, kindness and pcr
ceptiveness, making it easy for the audience to
understand how Drew can so quickly fall in love
with her. How Claire can fall in love with the
woodenly passive Drew though, is unknown.
Despite Dunst's commendable perfor
mance, the character is inherently flawed in that
she is not believable as a real human, especially
considering that the principle strength of the
film itself is its foundation in the earthly reality
of life, not in the too perfect movie world where
Qaire would belong. Claire conflicts with the
essence of the film to the extent that she seems
to have been inserted into the plot as a Beatrice
to Drew's Dante.
Thus "Elizabethtowir is a conflicted film.
Does it target critics or mainstream audiences?
Should it present life with an extraordinary clar
ity or pander to the typical expectations of how
a movie should make you feel?
Crowe is actually quite adept at combining
these seemingly disparate objectives, and the re
sult can be magnificent when he strikes a perfect
balance, as he did in "Almost Famous." Unfor
tunately. the pervasive schism here between re
alness and forced reality prevents "Elizabeth
town" from being as good as it could be.

I'm so glad this isn't my family

Following upon his critically acclaimed,
though commercially unsuccessful, "Almost Fa
mous," Cameron Crowe has created another
semi-autobiographical film, "Elizabethtown."
However, the film has completed the film festi
val circuit to lackluster reviews, forcing Crowe
to frantically re-edit the film to increase its main
stream audience appeal.
As a result, "Elizabethtown" sabotages its
ability to effectively convey some kind of deep
er philosophical meaning about life, for the
aforementioned critics, nor impart upon the au
dience any sense of emotional fulfillment. This
does not necessarily translate into a "bad"
movie though, since despite this conflict, "Eliza
bethtown" still manages to both enlighten and
entertain.
In the movie Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom)
has just suffered a devastating fall from his orig
inal enviable status as the young and rising star
of a successful shoe company. Having designed
"Spasmotica" a sneaker that was supposed to
"revolutionize the shoe industry" but instead re
sulted in an utter debacle,(for surely, any athlet
ic shoe that sounds like a pathogenic microor
ganism with the word "spasm" in its name is a
sure winner) Drew has caused the company to
lose $972 million.
This is a figure so monumentally phenome
nal that it is repeated several times throughout
the film, in an effort to evoke a few laughs. "How
can 1 best explain this to you?" Phil (Alec Bald
win), Drew's boss and the CEO, tells him before
firing him, "It's so much that it might as well be
$1 billion." Though the opening scenes are
meant to establish the full extent to which Drew
has completely and utterly failed, they overstay
their welcome as caricatures of soulless corpora-

tions and quickly
exhaust any inher
ent coniedic value.
Drew returns to
his apartment and
proceeds to assem
ble a most inventive
contraption of sui
cide comprised of a
huge knife and a
stationary' cycle. As
he prepares to liter
ally bike himself to
death, his cell
phone fatefully in
tervenes — his sis
ter, Heather (Judy
Greer), has called
to inform him that
their father has un
expectedly died of a
heart attack in the
eponymous title
town and asks him
to travel to Ken
tucky to retrieve his
body.
Drew reluctant
ly agrees and extri
cates himself from
his bike of death,
but not before vow
ing to finish his mis-

sion upon returning. However, while on a sur
prisingly empty red-eye flight to Louisville.
Drew meets Claire Colburn (Kirsten Duust), an
irrepressiblv cheerful and persistent flight atten
dant. Despite his taciturnity, Claire perkily initi
ates a conversation with Drew anyway and
draws him a map outlining the intricate roads to
Elizabethtown. The next morning, as Drew exits

the flight, he discov
ers Claire's number
on the back.
Upon arriving in
Elizabethtown, Drew
is instantly enveloped
by the community
and his relatives. De
spite having never
met Drew before, the
familial connection is
there — "This is your
blood" — and that is
all the Baylors re
quire before welcom
ing him so completely

alness and forced reality prevents "Elizabeth
town" from being as good as it could be.
