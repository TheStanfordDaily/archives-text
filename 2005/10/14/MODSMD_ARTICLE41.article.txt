## Cameron Crowe: is he the coolest person ever? 
### DI DANG OTHER LESS SMART PEOPLE INTERMISSION TAPE RECORDER 
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.
Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.

talks with him about what

Cameron be de

somebody

I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would

Q:Okay, so basically you are

mysterious. I don't know if I am

Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.

pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.

Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

whereas William Miller in "Almost

t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you

always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.

Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.

Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the

way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.

Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it

is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did

not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.

But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.



Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in

experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.

way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid

the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.

But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.



Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female

Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.

Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
Crowe until dawn

Q: Do you consider "Elizabethtown" your
baby?
CC: Well, they all are. Particularly if you spent
years working on it and you don't do it for any
other reason other than you have to and you
want it to mean something to people. The best
way to do that is to just work from your heart,
which I have always done. It allows you to deal
with people loving something or not loving it or
just being able to respect people's opinions but
knowing that you followed your own instincts,
cts.
The thing about Zach's movie and our movie
is I know they are not easy to get made. It is much
easier to make a heist movie or a slasher movie.
Those are easier to sell and market. You really
have to fight to make a move like "Elizabeth
town" even if you think a track record would
allow you to make it easily, you don't. You can
not. So you are fighting for your baby in a way.
Once you get a chance to make it then it is about
making it right and casting it right and getting all
the details right. Then it becomes really fun.
Q: Your films are often centered on young men

who overcome the odds of being too sensitive for
the world in which they live. How does this film
fit into that idea?
CC: 1 look at it more as a revisit to a character
that is trying to be a warrior for optimism in a
sometimes brutal and often cynical world. 1 think
that is a hero, particularly now, because it is often
pretty dark out there. It is just more of somebody
that chooses that positivism often when it is
much easier to surrender to the Dark Side. It is a
tough fight but a satisfying fight to push through
to the other side. So that has been a character I
have returned to for sure. But, the next movie
will probably be different.
Q:You were pretty close friends with Billy
Wilder and I was wondering how he influenced
your films?
CC: He influences me in professional ways and I
think he was one of the greatest writer/directors
ever. If you could believe that he was actually
even better at being a human being, he was that.
That was maybe even his greater lesson was how
to be a person in your late 80's or early 90's at the
end of your life. How are you going to be if you

live to be that age?
He made such a statement with his life. He
was endlessly curious and generous with his
friends and curious about the world... He was just
a soulful guy as well as being professionally prob
ably the king of writing great characters that just
drew you in and made you feel like they were real
people that you would laugh a lot with and
maybe cry a little bit with, and I loved that about
his work. I loved him even more as a guy.
Q: How did you learn how to make films, and
why did you become interested in that?
CC: 1 started as a journalist and basically loved
how people talk and learned about how people
talk by transcribing all the interviews that I had
done. I become interested in film because I loved
movies and put the two together.
1 think you just kind of soak up stuff from
watching movies and studying the movies that
you love. As you write your own visualizations of
the stories you want to tell sometimes you have
picked up the tools on how to do it. The best
thing I would say to anybody who wants to be

come a better director, and it is a lifelong craft, is
just to study and get lost in the movies that move
you and study the masters.
Q: Your dialogue is amazing and you said you
were always entranced by people talking. Is that
where you draw a lot of your inspiration, from
your own conversions? Or from conversations
you wish you had?
CC: Really conversations I wish I had. Or
sometimes you hear things in life. I remember
as early as "Fast Times [at Ridgemont High],"'
when I was researching it I overheard this con
versation where the girl said to her boyfriend,
"I don't want to use sex as a tool." 1 just thought
that was so funny and I built a whole scene in
the book around it and then it ended up in the
movie, too. I thought it cannot be real life; the
way people really talk is often as poetic or more
poetic than the things that you make up. So that
is being a fan of real life. Keep a note book, you
know? It is so good to just write things down as
you overhear them or you might hear yourself
say something and go, "Wow, I just said that.
That might be good for the scene I want to
write."
