## Cameron Crowe: is he the coolest person ever? 
### DI DANG OTHER LESS SMART PEOPLE INTERMISSION TAPE RECORDER 
INT: How do you view music in film
as the medium of human emotions?
What does music do that film cannot?
What does film do that music cannot?
How do you decide what certain inde
finable things through expressive
music instead of films or with film in
stead of music?
CC: Wow, that is a smoking question!
I just have to say that loving music is
constantly surprising and viable to me
as kind of a background for making
movies because when you can match
the right piece of music with the right
piece of film both get stronger. It is
not easy because a lot of the great

pieces of music don't

need film. They
are a better

movie on
their own
and it

plays in
their

mind. So it is a powerful imprint that
music can make on you.
But every once in a while the right
piece of music can really match some
thing you filmed and scratch at your
soul in a way that, as a music fan and a
film fan, you feel like both are en
hanced. So I probably spend the most
time in the editing room kind of chas
ing that marriage because as a music
lover you know that it is out there.
You also don't want to overuse or
lean on music too much. It is a finicky
kind of relationship that music and
film have. Sometimes you just want to
capture the way music can arrive in
your real life with serendipity and real
power.
There are many gifts that music
can give to a film. It often is best when
it kind of paints a subconscious pic
ture of what the character is feeling.
You connect emotionally and sud
denly you feel like you are in synch
with what the character is feeling and
that is when a movie music moment
can really galvanize you.

Q: In the film, Claire [Kirsten Dunst],

when she meets Drew [Orlan
do Bloom] on the plane,

talks with him about what
she believes names

mean. I was wondering
what you would say
about your name?

What would a
Cameron be de
scribed as?

CC: Hopefully
somebody
that...(Laughing)
I don't know.
The only other
Cameron that I
really met be
sides Cameron
Diaz, who seems

really different from
me, is a girl that I really

Cameron description really. But
I am honored by the question. As
far as I am concerned, I would
hope it would just be someone
who is trying to follow their in
stincts. That is sort of what 1 am
always trying to do in life or in the
pursuit of making a movie.
Q:Okay, so basically you are
saying that although you have
something you would like a
Cameron to stand for it is not
necessarily one name stands for
one personality trait?
CC: No, you know what? It is
probably true of all Camerons,
just unfortunately one of their in
stincts said not to go out with me,
and she followed it. With
Cameron Diaz, I had a great time
with her, but she is kind of mer
curial and really talented and
mysterious. I don't know if I am
as mysterious as she is.
Q: What inspires you to do the movies
you do and was there any personal ex
periences that you put into your films
besides "Almost Famous?"
CC: This movie, "Elizabethtown," is a
tribute to my dad. It is somewhat of a
love letter to his home state, Ken
tucky, and that came from personal
experience in knowing how much that
was a part of our family heritage.
But I found pretty early on that for
better or worse some of the times
when 1 would write the most personal
things almost to a degree where I
would plan on cutting them out later
but did not, as that would be the thing
that people would respond to the
most. So sometimes that stuff comes
from personal life and sometimes it
doesn't.
Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything" is
a completely fictional character...
whereas William Miller in "Almost
Famous" is pretty close to my own ex
t of quest .after the
way related to something you had to
go through after the somewhat tepid
reception to "Vanilla Sky?"
CC: No. It is funny, I get asked about
"Vanilla Sky" more than any other
movie probably except "Almost Fa
mous" at this point. It seems like over
time that movie has become a little
more understood. So that is a good
thing. But really I had not gone
through a fiasco of that magnitude I
am happy to say.
But looking back, one of the
themes of the movie is just when you
think that your life is over... I wanted
one of the themes to be just wait —
don't give up. If this incredible failure
hits on a Wednesday, give yourself
Thursday and maybe Friday and
watch what destiny might put on your
doorstep.
Looking back on things that have
happened to me, I remember really
believing in "Almost Famous" and
people really loved the movie when
we first started showing it and a lot of
people had high hopes for it being suc
cessful in the theater, but it bombed.
Really nobody showed up to see that
movie. I remember getting a call on
the Friday that it opened about 6 pm
and it was 9 pm already in New York
and it was this guy on the phone
telling me, "Well, pack up your tent, it
is over, nobody showed up." I re
member calling home and talking
to some people and just saying,
"Wow, it is a big dud."
But 1 loved the movie and it
never felt like the end of the
world to me because I loved the
movie so much. Sure enough that
movie found its audience. But if it
was going to be your whole world
and your whole world was de
pending on what somebody told
you about it, yes, that Friday was
not a good Friday.
Q: Nowadays it seems like every
body is trying to compare every
thing to another piece. A recent
one is "Elizabethtown" to "Gar
den State." How does that make
you feel when your products are
compared to other filmmakers?
CC: I loved "Garden State." Did
not see it until we were pretty
much finished with the basic edit of
the movie. I guess I knew I would
probably love it because I had read
enough about the inspiration for the
movie and that Zach Braff was a real
music lover and was doing kind of a
dark character comedy about love
and loss. That kind of movie I have al
ways loved and I knew "Elizabeth
town" certainly dealt with some of
those themes. To me there was more
kinship to Mike Nichols' "The Grad
uate." I really loved "Garden State"
and loved how different they were
and how different a movie like that is
from a lot of the other movies being
made.
But yes, I think the world is big
enough for two movies about loss and
a journey back home fora funeral, es
pecially two movies as different as
that. 1 later met Zach Braff and had a
great talk with him. He thought the
same thing — the movies are really
different. He said, "You know, you
should use The Shins in your movie."
I was like no; I think you got the copy
right on The Shins (laughter) though I
have been playing The Shins on the
set of "Elizabethtown." That was the
biggest similarity 1 saw: we both like
The Shins.
Cameron Crowe is married to one of the best female
guitarists of our time. Why did no one ask about that?
