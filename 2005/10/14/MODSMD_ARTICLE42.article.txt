# WELCOME TO NERD-VANA

### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION LUCKIEST-BASTARD-EVER 
■ lam no "Star Wars" dork. Sure, I used to have a "Star Wars" sleep
ing bag I would take with me to swim meets as a 6 and under, have

seen the Holy Trilogy an uncontainable number
of times and almost share the view of an anony
mous Post Secret writer who "cried for Anakin
Skywalker in Star Wars Episode 111 but not for the
tsunami victims," but I am no "Star Wars' dork.
Still, when asked to participate in a press junket
for the DVD release of "Star Wars Episode III: Re
venge of the Sith" (to be released November 1)
at Skywalker Ranch in Marin County for this
noble publication, I nearly wet myself. The fol
lowing are excerpts of a perfect day.
\ That's No Moon. It's a Space Station
J Located alongside ambling Lucas Valley Road
r (a name apparently unrelated to the Ranch's pro
prietor), Skywalker Ranch consists of 7,000
acres upon which is situated a building for Sky
walker Sound, a ginormous ranch house inhabit
ed by George Lucas and his family, vineyards and
a manmade lake, dubbed Lake Ewok, there to be
used by the Skywalker Ranch Fire Dept. in case of
an emergency.

Upon arrival at this supreme palace ot nerd-dom, I was ushered
into a small screening room replete with journalists from such publi
cations as "Entertainment Weekly," movieweb.com and"The Daily
lowan." The screening room was meant to replicate a normal home
viewing experience fora DVD, but with a flat-panel high-definition

television, uncompromising THX surround sound and cushy
seats, the experience was anything but normal. Jim Ward,
the Senior Vice President of LucasFilam and President of Lucas Arts

(the video game arm of the "Star Wars" empire), was on hand
to guide us through the ins and outs of the "Episode III" on DVD.

Captured digitally and transferred to DVD digitally, the movie
looks fantastic. Jim gladly showed us two scenes, the flick's

opening space battle and the climactic light saber dual
between Anakin and Obi Wan. The visual and aural

clarity is like whoa.
Next up (after some of Industrial Light and

Magic's computer wizards filmed me in front of a
green screen talking to General Grievous) was a
tour of the Ranch's main house, a 50,000 square

foot, three-story monument to all things awe
some. With a Steinway piano from the 1800s
in the foyer, a 40 seat movie theater in the base-

ment and Indiana Jones's whip in a glass case in
the entryway, Lucas's abode is anything but humble. Also situated in
the main house, under a stained glass dome, lies Lucasfilm's gor-%
geous research library. It was upon seeing this room that I over-

heard a fellow journalist mutter, "Now I can die."
Looking? Found Someone, You Have
Next up was an in-depth look at the spankin' new DVD (in what

amounted to a full-size movie theater), with further com
mentary from Jim Ward and Rick McCallum, the pro
ducer of "Episode III" who showed us some of the rad
bonus footage tacked onto the DVD. The most badass of
the bonus material is a one-hour documentary delving
into every step of the creation of the battle between
Anakin and Obi Wan, which comprises under a minute
of screen time. There's also an Easter Egg on the DVD of
Yoda rapping with Storm Troopers backing him as if they
were his Funky Bunch. Awesome. Also demoed for the
press was the newest "Star Wars" video game, "Battle
front II," sequel to a game that has sold 3.5 million
copies. With 50 playable characters and the ability to
hijack X-wings, the new game is surely the dopest thing
on the street.
After the demo, the Lucas people trotted out the big
guns for Q and A, led by lan McDiarmid (better known
as The Emperor), who looked a lot less like the Pope in
real life than he does on screen. McDiarmid's response
to playing the epitome of evil in four different "Star Wars"
movies is that his "relationship with Satan is closer than
even I hastened it to be." He also continually scares little

kids in public, which is a shame fora man with such a regal sound
ing English accent. Overall, he treasured his experience in the role:
"It's easy to play a hypocritical politician with a smirking face. Grati
fying too."

Frank Oz, the voice of Yoda (and
Miss Piggy), took the hot seat. After out-

right refusing to give us a
sample of the Yoda voice
("I'm not that easy"), the disap-

* / i* ----- - I
pointingly average-voiced Oz stat
ed, "I love Jar-Jar. He was terrif-

ic." I think he was a little of his
A-game. He was, however,
heartened at the lack of effort
playing the newly digitized
Yoda required: "I do half a
day, [the animators] do a
year. It's a delight."

Certainly the high
light of the day was pretty-boy
/ evil incarnate Hayden "I

have my own action figure -
how cool is that?" Christensen;
he just exuded a cool in his
mismatched slacks and
i J-

trousers and mussed
hair that was

very Bay Area chic. Chris
tensen was obviously enam
ored at finally becoming Darth
Vader at the end of "Episode
III." On how he felt when final
ly becoming Darth: "Great
glee. It was orgasmic." He also
spoke of the physical hard
ships he endured putting on the
Vader suit: "It was like wearing
20-pound shoulder pads and
high-heeled shoes... Not that I
practiced that way."
May the Force Be With
You
Before nerd time was up for
the day, we journalists crossed
the Golden Gate Bridge and
were able to tour the Letterman
Digital Arts Center, Lucasfilm's
new campus located at the Pre
sidio on the site of a former

Army base. 1,500 employees from Lucasfilm, Lu
cas Arts and ILM work in ideal conditions at the new

campus which just opened this summer. From the
lunchroom, programmers, developers and mar-

keting gurus have a panoramic view that en
compasses the Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace
of Fine Arts and the skvscraoers of the Financial

u i i iiic niio umu II ic upci o ui iiic i iiiuii^i
District. Because the $350 million facility is
located on a national park, no signage is al
lowed advertising the name of the build-

ings' tenants, only a fountain with a statue
of Yoda atop gives passersby a clue of who
works inside these lovely, iight and airy build
ings.

■■•a—
After having finally completed the serene new
facility, what's next for George Lucas and the

"Star Wars" galaxy? Apparently, a hell of a lot. Two
new "Star Wars" television shows, one animated and one live
action, are in the coffer. Plans to release the "Star Wars"

movies in 3-D are also in the works. ILM, in some kind of part
nership with Stanford I was told I wasn't supposed to know
about, is working on "Poseidon," a remake of a 1972 dis-

aster flick. Most intriguing is the next Indiana Jones movie
(supposedly starring Harrison Ford and directed by Steven
Spielberg), whose script Lucas was scheduled to complete
this past weekend.

In summation, my trek to Skywalker Ranch was dork par
adise. So go and get your copy of "Episode III" on DVD on
November 1; we here at the Intermission want to ensure
good relations with the Lucas folk.



The first decent 'Star Wars' flick in
more than two decades. Buy it Nov.

Still, when asked to participate in a press junket
for the DVD release of "Star Wars Episode III: Re
venge of the Sith" (to be released November 1)
at Skywalker Ranch in Marin County for this
noble publication, I nearly wet myself. The fol
lowing are excerpts of a perfect day.
\ That's No Moon. It's a Space Station
J Located alongside ambling Lucas Valley Road
r (a name apparently unrelated to the Ranch's pro
prietor), Skywalker Ranch consists of 7,000
acres upon which is situated a building for Sky
walker Sound, a ginormous ranch house inhabit
ed by George Lucas and his family, vineyards and
a manmade lake, dubbed Lake Ewok, there to be
used by the Skywalker Ranch Fire Dept. in case of
an emergency.

Upon arrival at this supreme palace ot nerd-dom, I was ushered
into a small screening room replete with journalists from such publi
cations as "Entertainment Weekly," movieweb.com and"The Daily
lowan." The screening room was meant to replicate a normal home
viewing experience fora DVD, but with a flat-panel high-definition

television, uncompromising THX surround sound and cushy
seats, the experience was anything but normal. Jim Ward,
the Senior Vice President of LucasFilam and President of Lucas Arts

(the video game arm of the "Star Wars" empire), was on hand
to guide us through the ins and outs of the "Episode III" on DVD.

Captured digitally and transferred to DVD digitally, the movie
looks fantastic. Jim gladly showed us two scenes, the flick's

opening space battle and the climactic light saber dual
between Anakin and Obi Wan. The visual and aural

clarity is like whoa.
Next up (after some of Industrial Light and

Magic's computer wizards filmed me in front of a
green screen talking to General Grievous) was a
tour of the Ranch's main house, a 50,000 square

foot, three-story monument to all things awe
some. With a Steinway piano from the 1800s
in the foyer, a 40 seat movie theater in the base-

ment and Indiana Jones's whip in a glass case in
the entryway, Lucas's abode is anything but humble. Also situated in
the main house, under a stained glass dome, lies Lucasfilm's gor-%
geous research library. It was upon seeing this room that I over-

heard a fellow journalist mutter, "Now I can die."
Looking? Found Someone, You Have
Next up was an in-depth look at the spankin' new DVD (in what

amounted to a full-size movie theater), with further com
mentary from Jim Ward and Rick McCallum, the pro
ducer of "Episode III" who showed us some of the rad
bonus footage tacked onto the DVD. The most badass of
the bonus material is a one-hour documentary delving
into every step of the creation of the battle between
Anakin and Obi Wan, which comprises under a minute
of screen time. There's also an Easter Egg on the DVD of
Yoda rapping with Storm Troopers backing him as if they
were his Funky Bunch. Awesome. Also demoed for the
press was the newest "Star Wars" video game, "Battle
front II," sequel to a game that has sold 3.5 million
copies. With 50 playable characters and the ability to
hijack X-wings, the new game is surely the dopest thing
on the street.
After the demo, the Lucas people trotted out the big
guns for Q and A, led by lan McDiarmid (better known
as The Emperor), who looked a lot less like the Pope in
real life than he does on screen. McDiarmid's response
to playing the epitome of evil in four different "Star Wars"
movies is that his "relationship with Satan is closer than
even I hastened it to be." He also continually scares little

kids in public, which is a shame fora man with such a regal sound
ing English accent. Overall, he treasured his experience in the role:
"It's easy to play a hypocritical politician with a smirking face. Grati
fying too."

Frank Oz, the voice of Yoda (and
Miss Piggy), took the hot seat. After out-

right refusing to give us a
sample of the Yoda voice
("I'm not that easy"), the disap-

* / i* ----- - I
pointingly average-voiced Oz stat
ed, "I love Jar-Jar. He was terrif-

day, [the animators] do a

he just exuded a cool in his

tensen was obviously enam
ored at finally becoming Darth
Vader at the end of "Episode
III." On how he felt when final
ly becoming Darth: "Great
glee. It was orgasmic." He also
spoke of the physical hard
ships he endured putting on the
Vader suit: "It was like wearing
20-pound shoulder pads and
high-heeled shoes... Not that I
practiced that way."

Before nerd time was up for
the day, we journalists crossed
the Golden Gate Bridge and
were able to tour the Letterman
Digital Arts Center, Lucasfilm's
new campus located at the Pre
sidio on the site of a former

Army base. 1,500 employees from Lucasfilm, Lu
cas Arts and ILM work in ideal conditions at the new

campus which just opened this summer. From the
lunchroom, programmers, developers and mar-

keting gurus have a panoramic view that en
compasses the Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace
of Fine Arts and the skvscraoers of the Financial

located on a national park, no signage is al
lowed advertising the name of the build-

ings' tenants, only a fountain with a statue
of Yoda atop gives passersby a clue of who
works inside these lovely, iight and airy build
ings.

■■•a—
After having finally completed the serene new
facility, what's next for George Lucas and the

"Star Wars" galaxy? Apparently, a hell of a lot. Two
new "Star Wars" television shows, one animated and one live
action, are in the coffer. Plans to release the "Star Wars"

movies in 3-D are also in the works. ILM, in some kind of part
nership with Stanford I was told I wasn't supposed to know
about, is working on "Poseidon," a remake of a 1972 dis-

aster flick. Most intriguing is the next Indiana Jones movie
(supposedly starring Harrison Ford and directed by Steven
Spielberg), whose script Lucas was scheduled to complete
this past weekend.

In summation, my trek to Skywalker Ranch was dork par

November 1; we here at the Intermission want to ensure
good relations with the Lucas folk.

lowing are excerpts of a perfect day.
\ That's No Moon. It's a Space Station
J Located alongside ambling Lucas Valley Road
r (a name apparently unrelated to the Ranch's pro
prietor), Skywalker Ranch consists of 7,000
acres upon which is situated a building for Sky
walker Sound, a ginormous ranch house inhabit
ed by George Lucas and his family, vineyards and
a manmade lake, dubbed Lake Ewok, there to be
used by the Skywalker Ranch Fire Dept. in case of
an emergency.

Upon arrival at this supreme palace ot nerd-dom, I was ushered
into a small screening room replete with journalists from such publi
cations as "Entertainment Weekly," movieweb.com and"The Daily
lowan." The screening room was meant to replicate a normal home
viewing experience fora DVD, but with a flat-panel high-definition

television, uncompromising THX surround sound and cushy
seats, the experience was anything but normal. Jim Ward,
the Senior Vice President of LucasFilam and President of Lucas Arts

(the video game arm of the "Star Wars" empire), was on hand
to guide us through the ins and outs of the "Episode III" on DVD.

Captured digitally and transferred to DVD digitally, the movie
looks fantastic. Jim gladly showed us two scenes, the flick's

opening space battle and the climactic light saber dual
between Anakin and Obi Wan. The visual and aural

clarity is like whoa.
Next up (after some of Industrial Light and

Magic's computer wizards filmed me in front of a
green screen talking to General Grievous) was a
tour of the Ranch's main house, a 50,000 square

foot, three-story monument to all things awe
some. With a Steinway piano from the 1800s
in the foyer, a 40 seat movie theater in the base-

ment and Indiana Jones's whip in a glass case in
the entryway, Lucas's abode is anything but humble. Also situated in
the main house, under a stained glass dome, lies Lucasfilm's gor-%
geous research library. It was upon seeing this room that I over-

heard a fellow journalist mutter, "Now I can die."
Looking? Found Someone, You Have
Next up was an in-depth look at the spankin' new DVD (in what

amounted to a full-size movie theater), with further com
mentary from Jim Ward and Rick McCallum, the pro
ducer of "Episode III" who showed us some of the rad
bonus footage tacked onto the DVD. The most badass of
the bonus material is a one-hour documentary delving
into every step of the creation of the battle between
Anakin and Obi Wan, which comprises under a minute
of screen time. There's also an Easter Egg on the DVD of
Yoda rapping with Storm Troopers backing him as if they
were his Funky Bunch. Awesome. Also demoed for the
press was the newest "Star Wars" video game, "Battle
front II," sequel to a game that has sold 3.5 million
copies. With 50 playable characters and the ability to
hijack X-wings, the new game is surely the dopest thing
on the street.
After the demo, the Lucas people trotted out the big
guns for Q and A, led by lan McDiarmid (better known
as The Emperor), who looked a lot less like the Pope in
real life than he does on screen. McDiarmid's response
to playing the epitome of evil in four different "Star Wars"
movies is that his "relationship with Satan is closer than
even I hastened it to be." He also continually scares little

kids in public, which is a shame fora man with such a regal sound
ing English accent. Overall, he treasured his experience in the role:
"It's easy to play a hypocritical politician with a smirking face. Grati
fying too."

Frank Oz, the voice of Yoda (and
Miss Piggy), took the hot seat. After out-

right refusing to give us a
sample of the Yoda voice
("I'm not that easy"), the disap-

* / i* ----- - I
pointingly average-voiced Oz stat
ed, "I love Jar-Jar. He was terrif-

ic." I think he was a little of his
A-game. He was, however,
heartened at the lack of effort
playing the newly digitized
Yoda required: "I do half a
day, [the animators] do a
year. It's a delight."

Certainly the high
light of the day was pretty-boy
/ evil incarnate Hayden "I

have my own action figure -
how cool is that?" Christensen;
he just exuded a cool in his
mismatched slacks and
i J-

trousers and mussed
hair that was

very Bay Area chic. Chris
tensen was obviously enam
ored at finally becoming Darth
Vader at the end of "Episode
III." On how he felt when final
ly becoming Darth: "Great
glee. It was orgasmic." He also
spoke of the physical hard
ships he endured putting on the
Vader suit: "It was like wearing
20-pound shoulder pads and
high-heeled shoes... Not that I
practiced that way."
May the Force Be With
You
Before nerd time was up for
the day, we journalists crossed
the Golden Gate Bridge and
were able to tour the Letterman
Digital Arts Center, Lucasfilm's
new campus located at the Pre
sidio on the site of a former

Army base. 1,500 employees from Lucasfilm, Lu
cas Arts and ILM work in ideal conditions at the new

campus which just opened this summer. From the
lunchroom, programmers, developers and mar-

keting gurus have a panoramic view that en
compasses the Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace
of Fine Arts and the skvscraoers of the Financial

u i i iiic niio umu II ic upci o ui iiic i iiiuii^i
District. Because the $350 million facility is
located on a national park, no signage is al
lowed advertising the name of the build-

ings' tenants, only a fountain with a statue
of Yoda atop gives passersby a clue of who
works inside these lovely, iight and airy build
ings.

■■•a—
After having finally completed the serene new
facility, what's next for George Lucas and the

"Star Wars" galaxy? Apparently, a hell of a lot. Two
new "Star Wars" television shows, one animated and one live
action, are in the coffer. Plans to release the "Star Wars"

movies in 3-D are also in the works. ILM, in some kind of part
nership with Stanford I was told I wasn't supposed to know
about, is working on "Poseidon," a remake of a 1972 dis-

aster flick. Most intriguing is the next Indiana Jones movie
(supposedly starring Harrison Ford and directed by Steven
Spielberg), whose script Lucas was scheduled to complete
this past weekend.

In summation, my trek to Skywalker Ranch was dork par
adise. So go and get your copy of "Episode III" on DVD on
November 1; we here at the Intermission want to ensure
good relations with the Lucas folk.



The first decent 'Star Wars' flick in
more than two decades. Buy it Nov.
1 or the dark side wins.
