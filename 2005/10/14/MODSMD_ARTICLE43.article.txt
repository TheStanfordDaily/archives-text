"Shakespeare" by Another Name: The Life of
Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, the Man who
was Shakespeare by Mark Anderson
(Gotham Books 2005,598page5)
The true identity of Shakespeare has long

been a mystery. The well-known and worldly
have been known to throw in their two cents
on the matter: Orson Welles and Henry
James made it known that they did not be
lieve Shakespeare to be an actor from Strat
ford upon Avon. I even left my library to cry
out to the world "Shakespeare was the Earl of
Oxford!" in the rough and tumble world of
assigned literary debate. Being remarkable, I

won millions of rabid supporters, but Mark
Anderson's new book, "'Shakespeare' by
Another Name" will surely convince more
people that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Ox
ford, was the playwright we know as Shake
speare.
With a freshly minted master's degree in
physics, Anderson descended upon the
Shakespeare debate. Originally, he imagined
his work as a series of articles. "The subject
of my first story," he recalled, "was about a
scholar [at the Folger Shakespeare Library]
who was studying de Vere's Bible. The con
nections between de Vere's notes and un
derlines and Shakespeare's biblical refer
ences are amazing." As Anderson traveled
deeper into the de Vere theory, he decided
that "this is one of the greatest mysteries,
historical mysteries, of all time. I just felt
that what was needed was a book that just
told a story." And his new book does indeed
tell the story of Edward de Vere. Chroni
cling the life of the Earl of Oxford from his
academically rigorous youth to his troubled
and lonely old age, Anderson skillfully puts
together the pieces of de Vere's life.
But "'Shakespeare' by Another Name" is
not a purely biographical work. Within the
fabric of de Vere's life, Anderson inserts
often persuasive parallels between de Vere
and the Shakespearean canon. While still
unmarried, Susan de Vere, the Earl's
youngest daughter, was given a short poem
to recite as part of masque which read
"Nothing's your lot. That's more than can be

told. / For Nothing is more precious than
gold." Anyone who has read "King Lear"
recognizes immediately the eerie similarity
between Susan's epigram and Cordelia's re
sponse to her father's query as to how much
she loves him. Not all of Anderson's exam
ples are as convincing as the Susan-Cordelia
parallel and Anderson's book fails to engage
when it doesn't make such startling compar
isons between the man who was Shakespeare
and his work.
"'Shakespeare" by Another Name" sits
precariously on the border between biogra
phy and literary criticism, an unenviable
position. Anderson does his best to navi
gate the world of Edward de Vere as
chronologically as possible, but since one's
work draws from the whole of one's life,
what should be a momentary stop to discuss
a parallel between life and work becomes a
month long detour.
In the end, though, those with a few hours
and an interest in Shakespeare or the Eliza
bethan age, will find themselves richly re
warded by the decade-long detective work
Anderson undertook to take his interest in
the Shakespeare question from an article to a
very long book. Without a piece of paper
from de Vere that reads "I am Shakespeare,"
all evidence in "'Shakespeare' by Another
Name" is circumstantial. But those with open
minds will find themselves stepping out of
their dorm rooms and shouting "De Vere!" in
the middle of the night.


Can YOU tell which is the real Shakespeare? Is there a real Shakespeare? What IS real? Are you
real? Where am I?
