# Catching up with The Daily's finest: Asshole, revisted.
## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION OLD-TIMER 
Tim Lipus, Asshole, quickly became a notorious
campus personality after writing a weekly column
this past spring in Intermission entitled "Brief Inter
views with Tim Lipus, Asshole." Intermission got
back in touch with its former writer to get the dish on
his past, present and apparent lack of a promising or
productive future.
INT: So how'd you become an asshole?
TL: I guess I was just sort of drunk and started act
ing like an asshole. But, uh, yeah, you know. What
was the question? Oh, how did 1 become an ass
hole? I was hanging out and started messing with
people. Sam, one of the editors of Intermission at
the time, was like, "Hey, you're being kind of an
asshole. Let's put this in a campus publication that
will be read by 10,000 people."
INT: What has your background contributed in
terms of your being an asshole?

TL: Well, I didn't have any formal training. So, you
know, it just took some practice. But really, my
general dislike for people kind of gave me that raw
talent and edge that I needed.
INT: You grew up in Boise, Idaho. How did that
treat you, and why did you grow up there?
TL: The second part of the question, well, that's
where my parents lived. So I didn't have too much
of an option. I liked living at home while I was still
in high school. But, uh, how that treated me... junior
high was hard for me. People were mean to me.
And then I was like, "Hey, if I am an asshole to
other people, I can tell myself that I am a better per
son than they are even though I am really an empty
shell of a human being inside," or, you know, some
thing like that. I don't even know if it makes sense
to say I'm an "empty shell" but, uh, yeah.
INT: I see you are a Libertarian â€” they have a rep
utation for being assholes according to some. What
is your take on that?

TL: 1 don't really know how to answer that ques
tion. Let me think... uh, 1 guess the perspective is
"Hey, leave us the hell alone," and then we don't
get left the hell alone, and then we try... I don't
know, 1 don't know. I don't have a real great re
sponse to that question. But please go ahead and
bring up the next element of my Facebook pro
file... not that that is where you are getting all of my
information.
INT: Of course not. Err, hold on.
TL: Okay... [A long pause ensues.]
INT: Damn. 1 was going to look at your personnel
record to get some really good stuff, but then I re
membered you haven't been paid yet so you
haven't completed any of those forms
TL: Haha. Do people have personnel files with in-
