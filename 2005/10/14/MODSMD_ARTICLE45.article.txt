### DAVID BLACKMAN INTERMISSION HIPSTER 
Intermission is not hip. We have
not reviewed or even name checked
the indie blog-induced sensation that
is Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! We
apologize. We will rectify this.
A quick CYHSY bio and review
before the actual concert review. They
are an indie band, mostly from Brook
lyn, New York who managed to hit it
so big in the music blogging communi
ty that they sold 20,000 copies of their
self-titled self-released album. These
guys are that good. As far as I'm con
cerned, it's the best album of the year.
Talking Heads meet Bob Dylan and
decide to form an indie band. That's
all you need to know.
CYHSY, like many people I know.

make terrible first impressions. The
album opens with a two-minute ob
noxious atonal affair that sounds like a
chorus of souls in hell singing over a
carousel organ. It's only saved by the
next track: "The Skin of My Yellow
Country Teeth." It opens with a riff
that makes me think they're about to
launch into a cover of "Mr. Bright
side." Another track, "In This Home
On Ice," reminds me of every song
Maximo Park has recorded.
I didn't expect to make it into this
show. The club was 21+, and I, sadly,
do not turn 21 for another month. But
I had to see this show. I'd missed too
many shows in the past month and my
indie cred was suffering because of it.
The bouncer looked at my ID for an
uncomfortably long time and then let
me in. Success.

Birdmonster opened the show.
Their lead singer conies from the Jack
White school of singing, where songs
start out as tender ballads and end
with whiskey-throated singing over
power chords. Not that this is a bad
thing. He also vaguely resembles a guy
at Stanford named Baiju. The best
part of their set was the pure joy radi
ating from the band. They had clearly
never played a gig this large (500 peo
ple?) and the lead singer had such a
large grin on his face that he occasion
ally had trouble forcing his mouth to
curve around the words he was
singing.
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!
played next. The scene: Alec, the lead
singer, was so strung out he could
barely keep his eyes open and looked
at the microphone with unbridled dis

gust. Three other members of the
band, all amazingly old for their genre,
stayed mute and immobile for the rest
of the show. The last and youngest
member of the band, one of two multi
instrumentalists, and the only one
wearing a t-shirt with the band's
whimsical line art drawings was smil
ing a clenched teeth smile that looked
like he'd been forced into it at gun
point. He kept looking over at Alec to
make sure he was still standing upright
and was singing at least vaguely into
the microphone. I got the sense that if
that guy had stopped smiling the band
would instantaneously fall apart,
dropping their instruments to the
ground and walking away from music
forever.
Alec looked and sounded like he
hated singing these songs and was

bored as hell on stage. To him I say:
You're a national sensation, the best
hope for independent self-distributed
music and everyone loves you — your
life isn't that fucking hard. I predict
he'll be dead from a heroin overdose
in six months.
Even with that disclaimer, the band
sounded great.
The National was the headliner,
but half the club left after CYHSY. I
only stayed for five songs (hey, it was a
school night), but they were great.
Very glam rock. Imagine huskyvoiced
Bowie if he were more French and
more fey. The band has been around
since 2001 and as a result their show
was a lot more polished than either of
the openers, coming in as a happy
medium between the joy and bore
dom of the prior two.

the indie blog-induced sensation that
is Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! We
apologize. We will rectify this.
A quick CYHSY bio and review
before the actual concert review. They
are an indie band, mostly from Brook
lyn, New York who managed to hit it
so big in the music blogging communi
ty that they sold 20,000 copies of their
self-titled self-released album. These
guys are that good. As far as I'm con
cerned, it's the best album of the year.
Talking Heads meet Bob Dylan and
decide to form an indie band. That's
all you need to know.
CYHSY, like many people I know.

make terrible first impressions. The
album opens with a two-minute ob
noxious atonal affair that sounds like a
chorus of souls in hell singing over a
carousel organ. It's only saved by the
next track: "The Skin of My Yellow
Country Teeth." It opens with a riff
that makes me think they're about to
launch into a cover of "Mr. Bright
side." Another track, "In This Home
On Ice," reminds me of every song
Maximo Park has recorded.
I didn't expect to make it into this
show. The club was 21+, and I, sadly,
do not turn 21 for another month. But
I had to see this show. I'd missed too
many shows in the past month and my
indie cred was suffering because of it.
The bouncer looked at my ID for an
uncomfortably long time and then let
me in. Success.

Birdmonster opened the show.
Their lead singer conies from the Jack
White school of singing, where songs
start out as tender ballads and end
with whiskey-throated singing over
power chords. Not that this is a bad
thing. He also vaguely resembles a guy
at Stanford named Baiju. The best
part of their set was the pure joy radi
ating from the band. They had clearly
never played a gig this large (500 peo
ple?) and the lead singer had such a
large grin on his face that he occasion
ally had trouble forcing his mouth to
curve around the words he was
singing.
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!
played next. The scene: Alec, the lead
singer, was so strung out he could
barely keep his eyes open and looked
at the microphone with unbridled dis

gust. Three other members of the
band, all amazingly old for their genre,
stayed mute and immobile for the rest
of the show. The last and youngest
member of the band, one of two multi
instrumentalists, and the only one
wearing a t-shirt with the band's
whimsical line art drawings was smil
ing a clenched teeth smile that looked
like he'd been forced into it at gun
point. He kept looking over at Alec to
make sure he was still standing upright
and was singing at least vaguely into
the microphone. I got the sense that if
that guy had stopped smiling the band
would instantaneously fall apart,
dropping their instruments to the
ground and walking away from music
forever.
Alec looked and sounded like he
hated singing these songs and was

bored as hell on stage. To him I say:
You're a national sensation, the best
hope for independent self-distributed
music and everyone loves you — your
life isn't that fucking hard. I predict
he'll be dead from a heroin overdose
in six months.
Even with that disclaimer, the band
sounded great.
The National was the headliner,
but half the club left after CYHSY. I
only stayed for five songs (hey, it was a
school night), but they were great.
Very glam rock. Imagine huskyvoiced
Bowie if he were more French and
more fey. The band has been around
since 2001 and as a result their show
was a lot more polished than either of
the openers, coming in as a happy
medium between the joy and bore
dom of the prior two.
