## TAs, RAs, HPACs and PHEs: Roxy knows staff are where it's at. 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS A.K.A. NINE INCHES OF SEXUAL PROWESS 
For years now, my loyal following of readers has been telling me res
ident-staff relations were a hot-button topic. They should have seen in
side my panties Saturday night. The pulsing and the throbbing and the
oh, oh, OH ... oh sorry, Roxy digresses.
Roxy realizes though that far too many have never experienced the
pleasure of tapping the tutor, rimming the RA or fingering the PHE.
Therefore, and to fulfill her court-ordered community service for
Michael Jackson-like acts of sexual depravity, Roxy proudly presents

these juicy tidbits on how to sleep with your staff.
Like underage drinking, sneaking up to the nearest roof or
smuggling silverware out of Stern Dining, these relation
ships may technically be illegal, but they are virtual necessi- j

ties to surviving life at Stanford. Nonetheless, hiding the \
fling takes effort and can prove highly risky — so the ques-

tion remains: why hump the HP AC?
Finding a fuck-buddy is like searching for real estate

it's all about location, location, location. Roxy
posits, why would a boy from Burbank ask for ass

in Adelfa? You can't see her but three days a
week and, let's not lie, your sexual urges are far
more frequent than that. We both know

you're going to cheat with the girl from Bran
ner, and if Roxy knows anything, she knows

Branner girls give the best brain anyways.
Hell, even Branner's octogenarian Resi
dent Fellow Kennell Jackson knows that.
Roxy said it here first: next year's theme
should be ...

" BRAIN-
ner. How much fun-
Y n i er would it be when peo
ple chant "Branner sucks?"
But Roxy digresses...

So your target staff member I
lives in a single, likely within three I
hallways of your sleeping quarters.
You've got the whole setup in your
' a~ r J
favor. Now, just consider the
potential rewards.
First and A
foremost,
your
staff member is probably older and therefore likely has more sexual ex
perience. Not that Roxy would know or anything, but fucking a part
ner with sexual knowledge under his belt (get it? Roxy sure does...)
means you should be cumming early and often.
Second of all, and contrary to rumor, staff have sexual urges. Just
ask Roxy. Or Kennell. Why do you think he's on oxygen? Oh god,
Roxy digresses again-
Staff members aren't merely vessels of trapped sexual desire, how
ever, for they also have powers. No, not superpowers like the Pink
Power Ranger, or even Napoleon Dynamite and his numchuck skills,
but the far more important powers to change the little shit in your life.
Who sets you up with a cute (not-so-) secret snowflake date at the dorm
dance? Who decides whether the rich, flavorful scent of Honey Nut
Cheerios entices you into the house kitchen every morning? Who
gave you the Internet access that allows a great many of you to read
this right now? Basically, the staff is your pimp and you are their
bitch, so if you fulfill their wishes, the sky's the limit. Who said
Roxy couldn't fuck her way to the top?
Finally, the staff is selected and hired specifically to fix your prob-
lems. Best as Roxy understands, this situation best comes into play
when lonely, horny you sneaks into their room late at night,
closing the door behind you. Here, you are certainly not
coming on too strong, you're merely helping them fulfill
their contractual obligations. After all, when you awoke the
next morning in his bed, were you still lonely and horny?
Didn't think so. However, if you're not in Pi Phi (umm...
Roxy means, if that's not your style) you can always go for
the sweet, sensitive seduction. Sure, an RA's job is to care
about your problems, but who's
there to care about his? Stuck in a single and often sur
rounded by students two or three years younger, Roxy
knows the staff must feel all alone. Show you care — lis
ten to your RA, empathize with his problems and, above
all else, suck up to him. Play your cards right, gain his
trust, and you might just get to eliminate the "up to."
As part of her community service, Roxy would like SLE
kids, CS majors, grad students, Ujamaa
(oh wait, no need, '
you guys invented the terms)
and all you other poor souls out
there to know that "brain" means
"head" and "rimming" means, well, download my video. Apply to be
my tutor: blow your wad to EMAIL.
