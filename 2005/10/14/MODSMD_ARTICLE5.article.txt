tonight, he'll bring with him a clearly defined sense of pur
pose. The objectives that purpose encompasses differ in
scope, but each one plays a critical role in motivating Drake

to be the player he is today.
From a position perspec

transition player. Since his
Stanford debut two years
ago, Drake's role in pressur
ing the opposition's defense
following turnovers has re
mained effectively the same.
"What I contribute to the
team is speed," Drake said.
"That's my focal point. My
role hasn't changed that
much over the years — I'm
still responsible fora lot of
counterattacks and driving,
but now [head coach John
Vargas] has given me more
responsibility and more free

years on the Farm.

Junior driver Tyler Drake has taken a key role in the Cardi
nal's transition game this season.
year. Drake also learned that his pri
mary function would not be lighting
up the back of the cage as he had
done during his prep career —
rather, he would be asked to leave
the bulk of the scoring to Stanford
water polo legends Tony Acevedo
and Greg Crum (class of 2(K)4) and
current seniors Peter Varellas and
Thomas Hopkins.
"Vargas and 1 had some issues
about [my scoring role] early on,"
Drake said. "I was all fired up after
senior year and was ready to go
when 1 got here, and he was like,
'You're redshirting.' So 1 had a little
bit of an attitude problem when I
first came here."
Drake has since come to terms
with the nature of his game-day as
signment and has markedly im
proved his overall effectiveness as a
member of the Cardinal squad.

"My game is movement," Drake
said. "It's been the same ever since
I've been here. [And] it's great with
Vargas now — I respect him a lot."
But it's the attitude and commit
ment to discipline that offer the truest
characterization of Drake. Every time
he enters the game, Drake knows he
has something to prove — it is with
this knowledge that he strives to push
his limits and elevate his game every
time he dives into the water.
"[Before games] 1 find myself
thinking about my high school pro
gram and coach a lot," Drake said. "I
know they're really proud of me for
reaching this point, so it makes me
feel like every time I go out there 1
need to prove myself in order to
prove that my program is legitimate."
At times, that drive to prove him
self manifests into a highly competi
tive and aggressive style of play.
Though some may perceive his will
ingness to take shots at opposing play
ers as a mark of dishonor. Drake firm
ly believes in standing up for himself.
"1 tend to start stuff more often
than 1 come to realize," he said. "If

I'm getting close to a guy and he's
pulling on my suit or something. I'm
not going to hesitate to throw that
elbow. As soon as someone hits me.
[I'm] just sort of like,if you're going
to play like that, I'm going to treat
you like that.'"
Taking care of his game is exactly
what the rest of the Cardinal squad
wants Drake to keep doing. Bui
Drake made it a point to acknowl
edge his Kappa Alpha fraternity
brothers and the rest of the Cardi
nal's fan base as critical to his
squad's success this season.
"[ I ] attribute a lot of the team's en
ergy coming from the support of the
guys on the bench as well as from the
K.A guys up in the stands." he said.

Junior driver Tyler Drake has taken a key role in the Cardi
nal's transition game this season.
year. Drake also learned that his pri
mary function would not be lighting
up the back of the cage as he had
done during his prep career —
rather, he would be asked to leave
the bulk of the scoring to Stanford
water polo legends Tony Acevedo
and Greg Crum (class of 2(K)4) and
current seniors Peter Varellas and
Thomas Hopkins.
"Vargas and 1 had some issues
about [my scoring role] early on,"
Drake said. "I was all fired up after
senior year and was ready to go
when 1 got here, and he was like,
'You're redshirting.' So 1 had a little
bit of an attitude problem when I
first came here."
Drake has since come to terms
with the nature of his game-day as
signment and has markedly im
proved his overall effectiveness as a
member of the Cardinal squad.

"My game is movement," Drake
said. "It's been the same ever since
I've been here. [And] it's great with
Vargas now — I respect him a lot."
But it's the attitude and commit
ment to discipline that offer the truest
characterization of Drake. Every time
he enters the game, Drake knows he
has something to prove — it is with
this knowledge that he strives to push
his limits and elevate his game every
time he dives into the water.
"[Before games] 1 find myself
thinking about my high school pro
gram and coach a lot," Drake said. "I
know they're really proud of me for
reaching this point, so it makes me
feel like every time I go out there 1
need to prove myself in order to
prove that my program is legitimate."
At times, that drive to prove him
self manifests into a highly competi
tive and aggressive style of play.
Though some may perceive his will
ingness to take shots at opposing play
ers as a mark of dishonor. Drake firm
ly believes in standing up for himself.
"1 tend to start stuff more often
than 1 come to realize," he said. "If

I'm getting close to a guy and he's
pulling on my suit or something. I'm
not going to hesitate to throw that
elbow. As soon as someone hits me.
[I'm] just sort of like,if you're going
to play like that, I'm going to treat
you like that.'"
Taking care of his game is exactly
what the rest of the Cardinal squad
wants Drake to keep doing. Bui
Drake made it a point to acknowl
edge his Kappa Alpha fraternity
brothers and the rest of the Cardi
nal's fan base as critical to his
squad's success this season.
"[ I ] attribute a lot of the team's en
ergy coming from the support of the
guys on the bench as well as from the
K.A guys up in the stands." he said.
