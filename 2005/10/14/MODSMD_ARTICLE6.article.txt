### MARIAM FAM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Ousted Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein will likely face charges of
premeditated murder, torture and forced ex
pulsion and disappearances when he goes on
trial next week fora 1982 massacre of Shi
ites,a court official said yesterday.
Saddam and seven other defendants are
accused of killing 143 Shiites in the village of
Dujail, north of Baghdad, after a failed as
sassination attempt against Saddam.
Prosecutors have not announced the
exact charges, which are expected when the
trial opens on Wednesday. Investigating
judge Raid Juhi told reporters in Baghdad
that the charges would focus on the areas of
"crimes of premeditated murder, forced ex
pulsion of residents, torture and forced dis
appearances of individuals."
Saddam could face the death penalty if
convicted.
Juhi also reaffirmed that there would be
no postponement of the trial's start, which
Saddam's attorneys had sought to review
documents they received on Sept. 25.
"The Special Tribunal has enabled the
representatives of the defense through all
legal means to completely review all the ev
idence, documents and investigation pa
pers," he said.
The trial is expected to be the first of
about a dozen involving crimes against hu
manity committed by Saddam and his
regime's henchmen during his 23-year rule.
These include the 1988 gassing of up to S,(XX)
Kurds in Halabja and the bloody 1991 sup
pression of a Shiite uprising in the south
after a U.S.-led coalition drove the Iraqi
army out of Kuwait.
Some of those cases "are about to be con
cluded in a few days" and will then be hand
ed over to the Iraqi Special Tribunal for trial.

Juhi said. He did not specify which cases or
whether Saddam would be a defendant in all
of them.
It is not known when the next trial would
start. It has taken three months between the
time the Dujail case was presented to the
court and the trial's start.
Saddam, 68, has been jailed under Amer
ican control at a U.S. military detention com
plex since his December 2003 capture near
his hometown.Tikrit.
The Dujail case is being tried first be
cause it was the easiest case to prepare, court
officials have said. There will be no jury. The
court's five judges will question witnesses
and render the verdicts.
Due to Iraq's precarious security, the
judge's identities have not been revealed
and may remain concealed during the trial.
Juhi will not be among them. Also, witnesses
are likely to testify from behind a screen to
protect their identities.
The massacres were in response to a July
8,1982. assassination attempt staged by vil
lagers at the height of Saddam's power, court
officials said. Gunmen opened fire on Sad
dam's motorcade as he passed through
town, but he was unhurt. In swift retaliation,
Iraqi army helicopters fired on villagers, and
troops rounded up and imprisoned resi
dents. Some are still missing.
The seven other defendants in the Dujail
trial includes Saddam's then-intelligence
chief, Barazan Ibrahim; his vice president
Taha Yassin Ramadan; Awad Hamed al-
Bandar, the head of the Revolutionary
court; and four senior Baath Party officials
in the Dujail region, Abdullah Kazim
Ruwayyid, Ali Dayim Ali, Mohammed
Azawi Ali and Mizhar Abdullah Ruwayyid.
The Iraqi Special Tribunal was created
during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, which
began in April 2003 and formally ended 14
months later.
