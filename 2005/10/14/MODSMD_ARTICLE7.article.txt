## Feds nab east coast drug traffickers in trade 
### JEFFREY McMURRAY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON â€”Federal agents ar
rested 28 suspects and seized 592 kilograms
of cocaine during an overnight raid in At
lanta that dismantled one of the largest drug
trafficking cells on the East Coast, the Drug
Enforcement Administration said yesterday.
The raid, known as Operation Long
Whine, also netted 40 pounds of metham
phetamines and $8 million in cash. It was the
second major seizure in the agency's four
month-old "Money Trail" initiative to moni

tor drug money that passes between the
United States and Mexico; The first came
through arrests made in Denver and Detroit.
Among those arrested late Wednesday
and early Thursday was the suspected
leader of the Atlanta organization, known
to law enforcement officials only as
"Gotti." DEA accuses him of orchestrating
shipments from major East Coast cities to
Atlanta, then back to Mexico.
Nearly $5 million in cocaine was be
lieved to have changed hands each week,
usually in small containers to avoid detec
tion. In at least one case, DEA said, the

drugs were hidden in a tractor trailer carry
ing pork and livestock portions.
"For drug traffickers, it's all about the
money," DEA Administrator Karen P.
Tandy said in a statement. "To decimate the
drug trade, we are following drug money
back to its sources, targeting the laundering
networks and eliminating the profits that
fuel drug trafficking gangs."
The suspects were arrested throughout
the Atlanta area, but the agency didn't im
mediately disclose where. Nineteen of
them were illegal Mexican immgriants.
DEA said.
