## ON CAMPUS Displaced students settle on the Farm 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford welcomed 38 guest non-ma
triculating students — 26 undergraduate
and 12 graduate — displaced by Hurri
cane Katrina for fall quarter, according to
Interim Dean of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman.
Krista Zizzo, director of outreach and
assessment in the Freshman Dean's Of
fice, said that the 26 undergraduates are
from Dillard, Loyola, TUlane and Xavier
Universities.These students include three
freshmen, seven sophomores, eight jun
iors and eight seniors from eight states
and Mexico. Almost half of the guest stu
dents are from California, but five are
from Louisiana.
"I think all of the departments and ad
ministrators involved in this project were
happy to do whatever it took to make the
transition smooth for these students,"
Zizzo said. "We are lucky that as a private
institution we have some flexibility in ac
commodating these students in this
unique situation. I know if the Bay Area
ever faced a natural disaster of this magni
tude, I would want other universities to do
the same for our students, should they be
displaced fora quarter."
The New Student Orientation (NSO)
Office waived the mandatory fee for all
new incoming undergraduates and pro
vided guest students with accommoda
tions and activities during Orientation
Week.
"Speakers from many campus depart
ments were on hand to answer questions
about campus resources, registering for
classes and other issues like health insur
ance," Zizzo said. "The orientation also
gave the students a chance to see who else
from their university was coming to Stan
ford and several reunions took place. For
example, three students who were evacu
ated from T\ilane to Memphis, Tennessee,
met up again here at Stanford."
The Undergraduate Advising Pro
grams Office assigned each guest student
an advisor to navigate Stanford's academ
ic offerings.
"Most students are enrolling for class
es that were similar to those they would
have taken this term, and others are using
the quarter to explore subjects that are
not taught at their home institution,"
Zizzo said. "Some students have experi
enced frustrations — finding three classes
of interest that all meet at the same time
or falling in love with an IHUM class that

is not open for
them to take
because they
are not fresh
men or being a
business major
and not having
the opportuni
ty to take busi
ness classes
here because
we don't have
undergraduate
offerings in the
field. For the
most part, the

students are happy for the opportunity
Stanford is providing them."
Zizzo explained that one initial chal
lenge was making the online class regis
tration system, Axess, available to the
non-matriculating students. The Office
of the Registrar quickly figured out a
method to manually register students
for autumn courses using registration
cards.
Another challenge was finding enough
housing for guest students; 19 are living on
campus this quarter. These students were
assigned vacant rooms throughout the
housing system, according to Todd Ben
son, director of Housing Assignment Ser
vices.
"Greg Boardman will be overseeing
planning in concert with Shirley Everett,
associate vice provost of Residential and
Dining Enterprises, if it becomes neces
sary to look at housing guest students dur
ing winter or spring," Benson said.
As a result of the administration's ef
forts, guest students like sophomore
Jamie Caplan fromTulane University feel
that they have been treated like any other
Stanford student. Caplan noted that she
received an academic advisor, peer men
tor, her choice of housing, a special new
student orientation and numerous e
mails from Zizzo answering specific ques
tions.
"The greatest help to me at Stanford
has been that there are many different
people that I can contact whenever I have
a problem," Caplan said. "I also find that
when 1 say that 1 am a visiting student
from TUlane, almost everybody I've en
countered is interested in my situation
and wants to help me acclimate to life at
Stanford in any way they can. I feel very
lucky to be here."

Another Tulanian, junior Aimee
Custis, said that Stanford has made
the temporary displacement as pain
less as she could have hoped or
imagined.
"From providing for our needs of
on-campus housing to the program
ming offered at New Student Orien
tation to being treated as equals
rather than charity cases' on campus.
I couldn't have asked for better,"
Custis said. "The housing depart
ment, my academic advisor and most

importantly the company and ac
ceptance of my friends here — both
Tlilanians and Stanfordites — has
been the greatest help to me."
Stanford students from the Gulf
Coast region also received support
from the University. For example,
junior Julia Saladino appreciated the
fact that the University allowed her to
move into her residence early free of
charge. Since returning to campus,
Saladino has tried to regain a sense of
normalcy.
"My year has been kind of crazy
even apart from Katrina, so it was
nice to get back to a familiar place
and do something normal like go to
classes and see my friends around,"
Saladino said. "I think it's great that

the University is being so active with
relief efforts and awareness. The fact
that Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity is offering a class
about the disaster called Con
fronting Katrina is honestly a lot
more than 1 think any universities in
Louisiana are doing much less
around the country."
Junior Zataia Richburg, who hails
from New Orleans, said she appreci
ated the offer of early housing by the
University, but opted to stay with her
family in Cincinnati, Ohio until
school started.
"The greatest help to me has been
my family, my friends and Christina
Mesa, my resident fellow in Potter,"
Richburg said.
