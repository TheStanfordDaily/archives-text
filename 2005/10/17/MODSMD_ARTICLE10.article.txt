# Veils of Cheddar Call Out to Vegetarians
## RAs embark on protein quest for the herbivore 
### DAVID LOUK CHRISTINA LIEBNER 
So you showed up on campus several weeks ago,
moved into your Lag mini-double across the hall from
that annoyingly high-achieving frosh (what do you mean
you already read all the IHUM books?), convinced
yourself that your buddies' open kitchens on the Row
weren't really that awesome and succumbed to a year of
Stanford dining hall cuisine.
Let your pals have their never-ending supply of Red
vines and Arizona Teas and other Costco bulk favorites.
But do not despair — you have Destination Dining!
Suddenly, you find yourself overwhelmed with choices.
Feel like lasagna? Head over to Lakeside and experi
ence the Italian Destination Dining Concept. Want a
killer kebob? Then FloMo's Middle Eastern eatery may
tickle your taste buds. Want to use a guest meal for that
special someone but don't know where to go? Our guess
is that someone won't stay special for long unless you
hop on your bike and get off campus.
But what if you're hankering for a thick, juicy slab of
grilled eggplant? Or succulent seitan — a high-protein,
low-fat meat substitute made from wheat gluten? Or
even a melt-in-your-mouth garbanzo curry?
What's cookin' if you're an herbivore? For senior
Christina Liebner, a residential assistant (RA) in
Wilbur, who in the past has chomped down on the gour
met eats in veggie havens Synergy and Columbae, and
for senior David Louk, another RA who was practically
breastfed in Hippieville, Ore. and now swears by his
honey-roasted soynuts,the deep-fried tofu at the Wilbur
Marketplace just doesn't satisfy.
They had to venture out and try someplace new (And
we admit it — we were eager to gossip about our resi
dents away from their prying ears). Dust off your Cha
cos, dig out your campus map and follow culinary cru
saders Liebner and Louk as they navigate the eateries
on campus in search of the ultimate meatless meal.
To kick off the inaugural guide to Stanford's Desti
nation Dining, the dynamic duo decided to go where the
food is promised to be "fresh and organic" (not to men
tion peanut-free) — Ricker Dining in the Sterling
Quad. Reasonable enough place to start, right?
Organizationally, Ricker Dining is not designed for
high traffic. The architect must have known few students
would brave the long trek out to the land of Governorfs
Corner between classes. Confusingly, it features a single
line that winds throughout the entire "servery" (a word
we picked up during the meal plan portion of RA train
ing and have since fallen in love with).
What this means is that if you are sheep like us, un
sure of what may lie ahead and fearful of not getting
enough to eat, you start putting whatever is in front of

your campus map and follow

you on your plate. Only as you get to the end of the line
do you realize that you have no protein sources and way
too many simple carbohydrates. But who could really re
sist that focaccia?
LJndaunted, we ventured forth again, this time select
ing highlights such as the "steamed cauliflower with veils
of cheddar." We're still try ing to figure out what a "veil
of cheddar" is. All we know is Louk liked it and went
back for seconds.
But neither of us wanted seconds of the mysterious
grilled peach featured in the salad bar. Wonder what
grilled peach tastes like? Just bend over and lick the bar
becue grill after an all-Wilbur barbecue and you pretty
much have your answer. Exactly whose idea was "peach
au grill juice?"
Perhaps the true highlight of the meal was Ricker's
extensive cereal bar. With twelve selections ranging

from granola and All-Bran to Frosted Flakes and Gold
en Grahams, Ricker has by far the best cereal choices of
any "servery" on campus.
A discerning reader might intuit that this discovery,
made at dinner, highlights that our experience was not
all it could be. Vegetarian protein options were limited
— just the "veils of cheddar." No tofu. No gardenburgers
ready to eat. Liebner couldn't even find yummy bean
dishes full of protein and non-soluble fiber!
Though Ricker was enjoyable, we ended up running
into residents anyway — hardly the escape we had
planned. So what did we learn from our excursion to
Ricker? Besides the fact that cheddar can be veiled, if
you really want to gossip about your residents, get in a
car and head off campus!
(Food quality is rated in bowls of cereal: the number of
bowls of cereal that we, combined, consumed at the
meal. The more bowls of cereal, the less good the food is.
Vegetarian options are measured in blocks of tofu, with
one being very little and five being a full tofu bar com
plete with tofu dipping sauces and tofu-flavored fro-yo)
Ricker Dining: 5 bowls of cereal, one block of tofu

If you want to take pity on Christina and David ancl you
live in a Row house with awesome food, email them at
cliebner@stanford.edu or dlouk@stanford.edu and invite
them over! They promise they won't talk smack about
your food.

is that someone won't stay special for long unless you
hop on your bike and get off campus.
But what if you're hankering for a thick, juicy slab of
grilled eggplant? Or succulent seitan — a high-protein,
low-fat meat substitute made from wheat gluten? Or
even a melt-in-your-mouth garbanzo curry?
What's cookin' if you're an herbivore? For senior
Christina Liebner, a residential assistant (RA) in
Wilbur, who in the past has chomped down on the gour
met eats in veggie havens Synergy and Columbae, and
for senior David Louk, another RA who was practically
breastfed in Hippieville, Ore. and now swears by his
honey-roasted soynuts,the deep-fried tofu at the Wilbur
Marketplace just doesn't satisfy.
They had to venture out and try someplace new (And
we admit it — we were eager to gossip about our resi
dents away from their prying ears). Dust off your Cha
cos, dig out your campus map and follow culinary cru
saders Liebner and Louk as they navigate the eateries
on campus in search of the ultimate meatless meal.
To kick off the inaugural guide to Stanford's Desti
nation Dining, the dynamic duo decided to go where the
food is promised to be "fresh and organic" (not to men
tion peanut-free) — Ricker Dining in the Sterling
Quad. Reasonable enough place to start, right?
Organizationally, Ricker Dining is not designed for
high traffic. The architect must have known few students
would brave the long trek out to the land of Governorfs
Corner between classes. Confusingly, it features a single
line that winds throughout the entire "servery" (a word
we picked up during the meal plan portion of RA train
ing and have since fallen in love with).
What this means is that if you are sheep like us, un
sure of what may lie ahead and fearful of not getting
enough to eat, you start putting whatever is in front of

you on your plate. Only as you get to the end of the line
do you realize that you have no protein sources and way
too many simple carbohydrates. But who could really re
sist that focaccia?
LJndaunted, we ventured forth again, this time select
ing highlights such as the "steamed cauliflower with veils
of cheddar." We're still try ing to figure out what a "veil
of cheddar" is. All we know is Louk liked it and went
back for seconds.
But neither of us wanted seconds of the mysterious
grilled peach featured in the salad bar. Wonder what
grilled peach tastes like? Just bend over and lick the bar
becue grill after an all-Wilbur barbecue and you pretty
much have your answer. Exactly whose idea was "peach
au grill juice?"
Perhaps the true highlight of the meal was Ricker's
extensive cereal bar. With twelve selections ranging

from granola and All-Bran to Frosted Flakes and Gold
en Grahams, Ricker has by far the best cereal choices of
any "servery" on campus.
A discerning reader might intuit that this discovery,
made at dinner, highlights that our experience was not
all it could be. Vegetarian protein options were limited
— just the "veils of cheddar." No tofu. No gardenburgers
ready to eat. Liebner couldn't even find yummy bean
dishes full of protein and non-soluble fiber!
Though Ricker was enjoyable, we ended up running
into residents anyway — hardly the escape we had
planned. So what did we learn from our excursion to
Ricker? Besides the fact that cheddar can be veiled, if
you really want to gossip about your residents, get in a
car and head off campus!
(Food quality is rated in bowls of cereal: the number of
bowls of cereal that we, combined, consumed at the
meal. The more bowls of cereal, the less good the food is.
Vegetarian options are measured in blocks of tofu, with
one being very little and five being a full tofu bar com
plete with tofu dipping sauces and tofu-flavored fro-yo)
Ricker Dining: 5 bowls of cereal, one block of tofu

If you want to take pity on Christina and David ancl you
live in a Row house with awesome food, email them at
cliebner@stanford.edu or dlouk@stanford.edu and invite
them over! They promise they won't talk smack about
your food.

So you showed up on campus several weeks ago,
moved into your Lag mini-double across the hall from
that annoyingly high-achieving frosh (what do you mean
you already read all the IHUM books?), convinced
yourself that your buddies' open kitchens on the Row
weren't really that awesome and succumbed to a year of
Stanford dining hall cuisine.
Let your pals have their never-ending supply of Red
vines and Arizona Teas and other Costco bulk favorites.
But do not despair — you have Destination Dining!
Suddenly, you find yourself overwhelmed with choices.
Feel like lasagna? Head over to Lakeside and experi
ence the Italian Destination Dining Concept. Want a
killer kebob? Then FloMo's Middle Eastern eatery may
tickle your taste buds. Want to use a guest meal for that
special someone but don't know where to go? Our guess
is that someone won't stay special for long unless you
hop on your bike and get off campus.
