University President John Hennessy re
cently released a report entitled "Looking
Backward, Thinking Forward," which re
flects on his time served from 2000 to 2005.
The report included such sections as Acad
emic Issues and Students,The Faculty, New
Academic Directions, Internationalizing
the University, Physical Infrastructure and
Development.
In the report. Hennessy praises an im
provement in the undergraduate experi
ence, evidenced by the formation of over
200 freshman and sophomore seminars,
new courses in writing and rhetoric and "a
vibrant and varied humanities core."
Hennessy also writes of the $1 billion
Campaign for Undergraduate Education
launched in 2000. He notes that no other
university has attempted to raise $1 billion
exclusively for undergraduate research.
Stanford not only attempted, but succeed
ed.
On the administrative side of things,
Hennessy views the switch to the single
choice early action admission program as a
success, citing an average of 2,000 more
early applicants per year.
However, Hennessy mainly focuses on
financial aid. He states that Stanford has
done a good job reducing the burden for
U.S. students from low and middle-income
families without increasing average stu
dent debt. He also says that Stanford has
made its first significant progress toward
endowing financial aid for international
students.
At the same time, financial aid is an
arena in which Hennessy says he sees
room for improvement.
According to the report, though it has
raised nearly $300 million for undergradu
ate financial aid, Stanford still strains to
meet financial aid obligations eveiy year
and reverts to relying on annual giving and
operating funds to reach required aid lev
els.
Hennessy concedes that "without the
scholarship of CUE [Campaign for Under
graduate Education], it is unclear whether
we would have been able to maintain our
historic commitment to a competitive,
need-blind admissions program."
In order to improve the financial aid of

ferings, Hennessy proposes two long-term
goals. He suggests that over the next five
years Stanford should try to eliminate any
current financial payment for families with
incomes below $45,000. He also recom
mends that Stanford should move toward
need-blind admissions for international
students. With the support of alumni and
friends around the world, these goals are
achievable, Hennessy says.
He also looks beyond the Stanford
Bubble in his report, and says he seeks to
define Stanford's place in the world. He
speaks of human activities that put the
planet's ecosystems at risk. Consequently,
he concludes that Stanford must be on the
front lines when it comes to addressing en
vironmental problems.
"Stanford, as one of the great research
institutions, has a responsibility to help ad
dress these challenges," Hennessy writes.
"The scale and complexity of the issues de
mand collaboration across disciplines. We
realize that if we are to be a leader in ad
dressing these issues, we must transform
our approach to research."
During the 2000-2001 school year, Hen
nessy acknowledged three high-priority
opportunities for Stanford â€” multidisci
plinary biosciences and bioengineering;
environmental science, engineering and
policy; and international affairs. In the re
port, Hennessy points out that Stanford
has progressed in each of these three fields.
The completed James H. Clark Center
presently houses the "first University-wide
initiative in biosciences, bioengineering
and biomedicine." The environmental ini
tiative launched in April, 2004 with the cre
ation of the Stanford Institute for the En
vironment. which was awarded $2 million
for innovative multidisciplinary research.
And, in May 2005 the initiative on interna
tional affairs got underway, and has re
ceived gift commitments totaling almost
$100 million.
Hennessy also highlights a need for in
ternationalization, especially after the
events of Sept. 11. At the undergraduate
level, two new overseas campuses have
been added in Australia and Beijing. Addi
tionally, Stanford has started a number of
multidisciplinary research programs
linked to the international initiative with
agendas that "manifestly global."
Moving on to campus infrastructure,

Hennessy states that in the last five years,
there have been over $770 million of capi
tal projects, resulting in the Clark Center,
Lokey Laboratory, the Mechanical Engi
neering Research Laboratory and Wallen
berg Hall.
For the future, Hennessy proposes a sci
ence, engineering and medicine campus,
four buildings forming a new quadrangle
adjacent to the existing Hewlett-Packard
quadrangle, renovations to the knoll and a
new stadium. In terms of housing, Hen
nessy states that the new Munger Gradu
ate Residence will create new housing,
which will allow more than 350 spaces now
being used for graduate students to be
used for undergraduates. Hennessy also
briefly mentions Vice President for Under
graduate Education John Bravman's plan
for an undergraduate housing overhaul.
Most students' opinions of Hennessy's
work as president over the past five years
are generally approving.
Senior Robbie Cahill says he likes Hen
nessy right now because "he helped out
with Club Sports, giving $75,(KX) to the
Club Sports program."
Senior Brian K. Goodman says he ap
preciates Hennessy's commitment to the
internationalization of the University
"One of the great advantages of coming
to Stanford is that the University is willing
to provide lots of money to students to
conduct their own undergraduate re
search," he says. "I've personally benefited
from this money, having the opportunity to
conduct research in Prague for several
months last fall. My time in Prague was the
best time of my life so far, and it might not
have been possible without Stanford's
funding."
Senior Michael Zell also says he is
pleased with the construction changes that
are in the works.
"I'm glad that the Engineering Depart
ment will have a new quadrangle," he says.
Goodman has only one suggestion for
improvement.
"It's great that Hennessy is emphasiz
ing development on international rela
tions, but we're lacking an interdisciplinary
center for human rights," he says. "Several
peer institutions have one.but we don't. I'd
like to see Hennessy take a larger leader
ship role in getting funding and faculty to
start [such a program]."

"One of the great advantages of coming
to Stanford is that the University is willing
to provide lots of money to students to
conduct their own undergraduate re
search," he says. "I've personally benefited
from this money, having the opportunity to
conduct research in Prague for several
months last fall. My time in Prague was the
best time of my life so far, and it might not
have been possible without Stanford's
funding."
Senior Michael Zell also says he is
pleased with the construction changes that
are in the works.
"I'm glad that the Engineering Depart
ment will have a new quadrangle," he says.
Goodman has only one suggestion for
improvement.
"It's great that Hennessy is emphasiz
ing development on international rela
tions, but we're lacking an interdisciplinary
center for human rights," he says. "Several
peer institutions have one.but we don't. I'd
like to see Hennessy take a larger leader
ship role in getting funding and faculty to
start [such a program]."

University President John Hennessy re
cently released a report entitled "Looking
Backward, Thinking Forward," which re
flects on his time served from 2000 to 2005.
The report included such sections as Acad
emic Issues and Students,The Faculty, New
Academic Directions, Internationalizing
the University, Physical Infrastructure and
Development.
In the report. Hennessy praises an im
provement in the undergraduate experi
ence, evidenced by the formation of over
200 freshman and sophomore seminars,
new courses in writing and rhetoric and "a
vibrant and varied humanities core."
Hennessy also writes of the $1 billion
Campaign for Undergraduate Education
launched in 2000. He notes that no other
university has attempted to raise $1 billion
exclusively for undergraduate research.
Stanford not only attempted, but succeed
ed.
On the administrative side of things,
Hennessy views the switch to the single
choice early action admission program as a
success, citing an average of 2,000 more
early applicants per year.
However, Hennessy mainly focuses on
financial aid. He states that Stanford has
done a good job reducing the burden for
U.S. students from low and middle-income
families without increasing average stu
dent debt. He also says that Stanford has
made its first significant progress toward
endowing financial aid for international
students.
At the same time, financial aid is an
arena in which Hennessy says he sees
room for improvement.
According to the report, though it has
raised nearly $300 million for undergradu
ate financial aid, Stanford still strains to
meet financial aid obligations eveiy year
and reverts to relying on annual giving and
operating funds to reach required aid lev
els.
Hennessy concedes that "without the
scholarship of CUE [Campaign for Under
graduate Education], it is unclear whether
we would have been able to maintain our
historic commitment to a competitive,
need-blind admissions program."
In order to improve the financial aid of

ferings, Hennessy proposes two long-term
goals. He suggests that over the next five
years Stanford should try to eliminate any
current financial payment for families with
incomes below $45,000. He also recom
mends that Stanford should move toward
need-blind admissions for international
students. With the support of alumni and
friends around the world, these goals are
achievable, Hennessy says.
He also looks beyond the Stanford
Bubble in his report, and says he seeks to
define Stanford's place in the world. He
speaks of human activities that put the
planet's ecosystems at risk. Consequently,
he concludes that Stanford must be on the
front lines when it comes to addressing en
vironmental problems.
"Stanford, as one of the great research
institutions, has a responsibility to help ad
dress these challenges," Hennessy writes.
"The scale and complexity of the issues de
mand collaboration across disciplines. We
realize that if we are to be a leader in ad
dressing these issues, we must transform
our approach to research."
During the 2000-2001 school year, Hen
nessy acknowledged three high-priority
opportunities for Stanford â€” multidisci
plinary biosciences and bioengineering;
environmental science, engineering and
policy; and international affairs. In the re
port, Hennessy points out that Stanford
has progressed in each of these three fields.
The completed James H. Clark Center
presently houses the "first University-wide
initiative in biosciences, bioengineering
and biomedicine." The environmental ini
tiative launched in April, 2004 with the cre
ation of the Stanford Institute for the En
vironment. which was awarded $2 million
for innovative multidisciplinary research.
And, in May 2005 the initiative on interna
tional affairs got underway, and has re
ceived gift commitments totaling almost
$100 million.
Hennessy also highlights a need for in
ternationalization, especially after the
events of Sept. 11. At the undergraduate
level, two new overseas campuses have
been added in Australia and Beijing. Addi
tionally, Stanford has started a number of
multidisciplinary research programs
linked to the international initiative with
agendas that "manifestly global."
Moving on to campus infrastructure,

Hennessy states that in the last five years,
there have been over $770 million of capi
tal projects, resulting in the Clark Center,
Lokey Laboratory, the Mechanical Engi
neering Research Laboratory and Wallen
berg Hall.
For the future, Hennessy proposes a sci
ence, engineering and medicine campus,
four buildings forming a new quadrangle
adjacent to the existing Hewlett-Packard
quadrangle, renovations to the knoll and a
new stadium. In terms of housing, Hen
nessy states that the new Munger Gradu
ate Residence will create new housing,
which will allow more than 350 spaces now
being used for graduate students to be
used for undergraduates. Hennessy also
briefly mentions Vice President for Under
graduate Education John Bravman's plan
for an undergraduate housing overhaul.
Most students' opinions of Hennessy's
work as president over the past five years
are generally approving.
Senior Robbie Cahill says he likes Hen
nessy right now because "he helped out
with Club Sports, giving $75,(KX) to the
Club Sports program."
Senior Brian K. Goodman says he ap
preciates Hennessy's commitment to the
internationalization of the University
"One of the great advantages of coming

to provide lots of money to students to
