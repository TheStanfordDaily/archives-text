## Editorial Disaster relief: Don't stop now 
### 
The Stanford community should be
proud of its recent response to disas
ters. In the last two years the world has
faced the tsunami in Asia, Hurricane Katri
na at home and genocide in Darfur. Stanford
has risen to each challenge admirably. Just
last week, over 1,100 Stanford students
helped raise $25,000 for relief in Darfur.
Nor have efforts been limited to the un
dergraduate student body. All elements of
Stanford contributed, from the administra
tion's admitting displaced Katrina victims, to
the Stanford Federal Credit Union's match
ing donations.
But we cannot delude ourselves into
thinking we have done enough. A disaster
only starts with a bang. The bang is decep
tive; the suffering continues long after the
storm dies down. It has been two months
since Hurricane Katrina struck and there are
still hundreds of thousands of refugees Even
those who returned often arrived home to
find their property in ruins. The hurricane's
end does not mean the caring should end.
But even if somehow we could know that
we donated enough to Katrina, that would
not be the end. There is no such thing as the
final disaster, and therefore there is no such
thing as the final relief effort. We must con
stantly be ready to respond to any disaster,
near or far — even if it occurs during
midterms.
Indeed, within days of the fast for Darfur,
an earthquake struck Pakistan — the
biggest to hit Pakistan this century. While
fewer than a thousand people died in Katri
na, already over 40.000 people are believed
to have died in Pakistan alone.

Yet, despite the massive scale of the ca
tastrophe, all signs point toward a growing
fatigue. According to the Washington Post,
the American Red Cross raised an impres
sive $1.2 billion for Katrina relief and over
$500 million for the tsunami victims, while it
has raised only $1.6 million for the Pakistan
earthquake response as of Saturday. That's
less that half of 1 percent of the response to
the tsunami. Responding to two disasters is
not enough if three disasters have occurred.
The earthquake in Pakistan is quite far
away, and some would argue that we
should care more about those closer to us.
But we hope that Stanford students, of all
people, will go above and beyond what is
expected.
And so far that seems to be happening.
With the relief effort still getting started,
over $4,000 has been collected for earth
quake victims. This has been done in an ad
mirably nonpartisan manner, with all types
of groups interested in the region working
together. You can also donate at
http://pas.stanford.edu. a Web site run by
Pakistanis at Stanford; donations will go to
groups such as UNICEF and the Red Cres
cent/Red Cross.
Still, much remains to be done. Home
lessness after the earthquake may be as bad
as after the tsunami, and the American's
have not nearly taken the lead that they
should in providing aid. That America as a
whole is lagging behind in disaster relief is all
the more reason for the Stanford communi
ty to contribute. Let us make our recent im
pressive display of generosity a habit and a
point of pride.
