## The 						U.S. â€” land of extremes 
### LAURE NEGIAR 
Extra-large Diet Cokes. Small decaf soy
vanilla lattes. All-you-can-eat buffets. Huge
open spaces. Giant corporations. Bustling
cities that never sleep. So many options. The
best and the worst, side-by-side. The US. re
ally is the land of extremes.
All countries offer contrasts, be they geo
graphic, social, or cultural. But of all the
places I've been to, the U.S. presents the
most vivid contrasts and the most pro
nounced extremes. The size of the country
probably accounts for part of these extreme
contrasts. But that can't be the whole story.
Before I get into possible explanations,
though, let me give a few examples.
In the U.S., extreme wealth and extreme
poverty coexist. Bill Gates is American, but
then so are the poor people of New Orleans
who were left homeless and penniless as a
result of hurricane Katrina. The U.S. has
some of the worst high schools in the devel
oped world, but it also has some excellent
high schools, and eight out of the top 10 uni
versities in the world are American, accord
ing to the ranking of Shanghai's Jiao Tong
University. The U.S. has one of the worst
obesity problems in the world, but it also has
a large share of fitness fans (not to say mani
acs) and health gurus.
On a superficial level. 1 think the impres
sion of extremes is created by the over
whelming number of options there are for
anything in this country, as well as the size of
everything, which is always larger than
everywhere else. The U.S. has the biggest
firms. The biggest cars. The most religions
(think about it: As a Christian in this country,
you can be Catholic. Episcopalian, Baptist.
Mormon, etc. In Europe, you're either

Protestant or Catholic). And then there's the
number of things you can do to coffee or ice
cream: almond, hazelnut or vanilla syrup in
your coffee, non-fat. one- or two-percent
milk, decaf, vegan ice cream, chocolate
dipped cones-in most other places, you just
get to choose what flavor of ice cream you
want, and whether you want an espresso or a
cappuccino.
On a more fundamental level, I think the
extremes can partly be explained by the role
of government and individualism in the U.S.
In countries where the government inter
venes more (Ran in the U.S., differences are
reduced and inequalities are corrected.
Where society is more regulated, there are
also stronger norms, and people might feel
more pressure to behave in a way consistent
with these norms. But in the U.S., where the
majority of people think the government
should play a relatively small role in people's
lives, individuals are pretty much left to their
own devices, and that creates extremes.
Charter schools are my personal favorite
example of American laissez-faire. I still
can't believe that in some states, if you're dis
satisfied with your local public school but
don't want to or can't afford to put your child
in a private school, you can receive govern
ment funds to create your own school. While
some charter schools have relatively con
ventional focuses (languages, high-tech, in
ternational relations), others are much more
eccentric-like a California charter school
where all classes happen on a boat. Compare
that with your traditional government-regu
lated European public school, and you're
naturally going to think that the U.S. is a
strange, strange place.
In the global arena, the U.S.'s re
lation is more than a little ambigu
ous. For most countries, it's a love
hate relationship with the U.S.
American wealth, power and oppor
tunities fascinate. But the extremes
puzzle and unsettle. Katrina is just
the latest example. How can such a
rich and powerful country deal so
poorly with a crisis situation? And
how can it harbor such extreme
poverty? The extremes are the per
fect starting point for myths and
stereotypes: the fat, uncultured
American; the money-obsessed
American; the workaholic Ameri
can. Maybe those who want to un
derstand the U.S.'s relations with the
rest of the world should try to ana
lyze the extremes in American soci
ety and how those extremes are per
ceived by the rest of the world. It's
not just the immediate geopolitical
situation that matters.
