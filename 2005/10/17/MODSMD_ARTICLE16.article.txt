# Bombing smurfs for the children
## 
### 
The United Nations Childrens Fund
(UNICEF) recently unveiled an ad
campaign that you may or may not
have seen. It features a panoramic view of
those lovable smurfs. a Belgian cartoon pop
ular in the 80s. (Yes, they're really Belgian.)
The smurf village is pictured with all the
smurfs singing happily and dancing. Then, it
cuts to scenes of bombers blowing those little
mushroom-topped homes to smithereens.
After that cheery picture, they show Baby
Smurf crying his eyes out as the other smurfs
run around in the rubble. Fun! Then the
image flashes on the screen: "Don't let wars
affect the lives of children."
1 was more concerned with Belgian com
mercials affecting children. Because in all
honesty, that'll fuck you up. I'm trying to fig
ure out what exactly prompted this commer
cial. Who wants to bomb the smurfs? I mean,
did Gargamel finally get the nuclear option?
Are the Keebler Elves trying to muscle in on
smurfdom? Was Rainbow Brite pissed she
got canceled in an 80's ratings war?
I know the producers were trying to get
some message across, something stupid
about children. I don't know what it is,
though; I'm too busy trying to figure out who
was seeking to off the smurfs. Now that I
think about it, why are smurfs being killed re
lated to children? If I don't donate to
UNICEF, will they bomb the happy land of
My Little Ponies? Will they put a gun to
Benji's head next time?
So UNICEF was finding that their normal
commercials were not getting the desired
funding. That's sad that images of children
being affected by war didn't tug enough at
the heart strings. And I guess I see the pro
gression: "well, what's cuter than children
suffering? Oh I know, dead smurfs!" Or
maybe it would be something like: "you
know what I really enjoy seeing more than
children crying? Smurfs getting blown to
smurfereens!" There were a lot of drugs at

this meeting; it's Belgium.
The reason why this whole fiasco went
down was, of course, for the children. Never
mind the children who actually saw this com
mercial will be seeking therapy for the next
twenty years scared that toadstools will sud
denly burst into flames. Society does some
weird things to protect children.Take, for ex
ample, the governor's latest crusade against
video games.
Recently, Governor Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger signed into law a bill that would make it il
legal to rent or sell ultraviolent video games
to those under 18. A 81179 also tacks on a
$ 1 (XX) fine for any retailer who sells a game to
a minor. But let's back up here for a second:
Arnold Schwarzenegger, star of Predator,
Total Recall, and the Terminator series is
fighting a campaign against violence? That's
like getting Wilt Chamberlain to give talks
about abstinence.
I worked jn a video game store for a year.
And as an evil clerk of a heartless, money
grubbing violence-loving video game indus
try, we routinely advertised the most violent
games to children. We'd often say "you there
young impressionable six-year-old, put down
that game about unicorns and buy this game
about throwing knifes." I personally got a
sick glee while explaining to the children that
the "A" button lets you use the chainsaw to
disembowel the gremlin.
Again, this bill Governor Schwarzenegger
(star of End of Days, Collateral Damage, and
True Lies) signed into law is really necessary.

Without it, children under the age of 18
would be allowed to buy violent video games
at stores. It's not like my former employer,
the largest video game retail chain in the
world, has had a policy prohibiting the sale of
violent video games for five years. Governor
Schwarzenegger, star of Red Heat, Running
Man, and The Last Action Hero, is taking a
strong stance against violence. In no way is
that akin to having Tom DeLay head the
House Ethics committee.
Well, I'm just thankful we have so many
people taking the initiative- for the children.
I'm thankful for the UN and it's UNICEF's
advertising campaign. I'm thankful that peo
ple are taking a strong stand against violence
for children using the less damaging medium
of cartoon characters. What's next, getting
Scooby Doo to explain oil for food?
I'm also thankful our governor is taking on
the violent video game industry. Without his
law, video game stores, like my evil one that
killed poodles in the back every TUesday, are
going to corrupt children. If Gov.
Schwarzenegger (star of such films as Com
mando, Conan the Barbarian, and the 6th
Day) doesn't take the initiative, who willâ€”the
parents who actually buy the video games and
don't read the warnings? Our governor,
thankfully, is taking the moral high ground
and not using this as a ploy for re-election.
It's not like current American culture, in a
post-Columbine world, is blaming everyone
but themselves. We should regulate and re
strict and put up as many barriers to these
things as we can. Because if we don't, then
maybe people would actually have to parent.
And if we say it's"for the children" we can
be cleansed Qf any accusations of political
pandering, hypocrisy or smurf genocide.

The last words of Papa Smurf were: "Holy
smurf! My smurf got blown off! How am I
going to smurf now!?" Send complaints to
