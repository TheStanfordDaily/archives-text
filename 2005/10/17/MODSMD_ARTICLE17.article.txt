ASSU budget unimaginable?
I nope not.
Yesterday's article ("ASSU looks
to retool finance policies," Oct. 13)
began with the following description
of that august body's particular
predicament: "The ASSU operates
on a budget larger than many can
imagine." It is so large, in fact, that
despite tantalizing us with the idea of
a number so large, Ms. Lin spares us
the blowing of our minds by never
actually revealing what the budget is.
From the various numbers intro
duced, if I had to guess. I'd say the an
nual figure is on the order of a mil
lion dollars. A million dollars is a lot
of money. But is it truly more than I
can imagine? Is it truly more than
many can imagine? If so. that is a dis

credit to the University and as an ed
ucational institution.
Allow me to put this number into
perspective. If every dollar were a
second, the ASSU budget would last
for 11 days. If every dollar were a
koala, then the ASSU would be
somewhere between even with Aus
tralia in terms of marsupial popula
tion or have approximately 10 times
as many faux ursines. depending on
whose statistic you believe.
But a million dollars? Unimagin
able?
Now. maybe it was more than a
million. I've been known to eyeball
poorly in the past. Still, are we really
creating graduates so focused on
Milton or Donne or Heisenberg that
they cannot even contemplate own
ership of the house their thesis advi

sor lives in? A life of ramen and
rental is not what I want my fellow
alumni to aspire to.
Sometimes reporters are assigned
to issues that interest few readers. In
cases such as these, a hook sentence at
the beginning of a paragraph is the
only way to prevent the induced nar
colepsy that, let's be honest, the ASSU
so often causes. But please, reread the
hook to make sure that it's not only in
teresting, but also makes sense.

What about iPods?
While The Daily cited statistics
showing 78 percent of undergradu
ate and 87 percent of graduate sur

vey respondents own Windows PCs
in their article about Yahoo!'s new
music partnership with Stanford, it
didn't cite any numbers relating to
what percentage of students own
portable music players and what per
centage of those portable music play
ers are iPods. One would think that
would be an important considera
tion. Apple owns 75 percent of the
overall portable-player market and
84 percent of the music download
market. Those are big numbers.
From my experience at the gym, a
sizable portion of students already
own digital music devices — and
they're iPods.
If Stanford, and whoever else
worked out the deal, hopes this serv
ice will be a natural fit for students,
they're wrong. As long as Stanford

was going to pick a service that works
with only 80 percent of the computers
on campus, they could have just as
easily picked a service that would
work with only 80 percent of the
portable music devices on campus.
And if they had picked Apple's plat
form, they would have had universal
computer compatibility, too.
If Yahoo! is using Stanford as a
wedge to drive students to their
music store, they are doing students a
disservice. And if Stanford thinks this
partnership will keep students from
pirating music, they had better con
sider that pirated music is still free, is
still something students can keep for
ever and is still something that will
play on an iPod.

What about iPods?
While The Daily cited statistics
showing 78 percent of undergradu
ate and 87 percent of graduate sur

vey respondents own Windows PCs
in their article about Yahoo!'s new
music partnership with Stanford, it
didn't cite any numbers relating to
what percentage of students own
portable music players and what per
centage of those portable music play
ers are iPods. One would think that
would be an important considera
tion. Apple owns 75 percent of the
overall portable-player market and
84 percent of the music download
market. Those are big numbers.
From my experience at the gym, a
sizable portion of students already
own digital music devices — and
they're iPods.
If Stanford, and whoever else
worked out the deal, hopes this serv
ice will be a natural fit for students,
they're wrong. As long as Stanford

was going to pick a service that works
with only 80 percent of the computers
on campus, they could have just as
easily picked a service that would
work with only 80 percent of the
portable music devices on campus.
And if they had picked Apple's plat
form, they would have had universal
computer compatibility, too.
If Yahoo! is using Stanford as a
wedge to drive students to their
music store, they are doing students a
disservice. And if Stanford thinks this
partnership will keep students from
pirating music, they had better con
sider that pirated music is still free, is
still something students can keep for
ever and is still something that will
play on an iPod.
