In the article "Download service
set to begin," which appeared in The
Daily on October 13, there is a typo
in sophomore Molly Butcher's
quote. Her correct statement was,"I
understand that it's Apple's decision
to not allow their users to subscribe
to this type of music service."
On Wednesday, Oct. 5 the photos
accompanying the article "Equestri
ans return home" were mistakenly
credited to the Stanford equestrian
team. Both photos were taken by
photographer Sasha Mitelman.
