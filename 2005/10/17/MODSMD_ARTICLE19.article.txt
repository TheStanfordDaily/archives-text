## Football rides five turnovers to a 20-16 victory Despite being outplayed statistically, Stanford wins its second-straight contest 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
TUCSON, Ariz. — For the first
six minutes in Saturday's visit to Ari
zona, the Cardinal appeared to be in
big trouble.
After receiving the opening kick
off, the Wildcats methodically
marched 80 yards on 15 plays for a
touchdown on their longest scoring
drive of the season. Arizona convert
ed five third downs on the touchdown
march and looked like it would have
no trouble moving the ball against an
injury-plagued Stanford defense.
But Arizona (1-5, 0-3 Pacific-10
Conference) soon reverted to form,
demonstrating why the Pac-10 cellar
has been all but a legal residence for
the squad in recent years. The Wild
cats turned the ball over five times —
often killing would-be scoring drives
in the process — and Stanford's (3-2,
2-1) offense did just enough to en
sure the 20-16 victory.
Junior quarterback Trent Ed
wards' second-quarter 10-yard
screen pass to sophomore tailback
Anthony Kimble and 10-yard third
quarter dart to junior tight end
Michael Horgan marked Stanford's
only touchdowns of the contest. Se
nior kicker Michael Sgroi's 37- and
34-yard field goals accounted for the
remainder of Stanford's scoring. Ed
wards passed for 137 yards, two
touchdowns and. most importantly,
no interceptions.
"The thing I'm preaching about is
turning the ball over and how you
have to hold on to the ball with
painstaking attention to detail,"
Stanford head coach Walt Harris
said. "I think we're getting our guys
to buy into it, and that was an obvi
ous difference in this game."
Indeed, although the Wildcats
outgained the Cardinal, 271 yards to
195, Stanford's defense managed to
force a season-high five turnovers in
the contest. Despite the low yardage
total. Stanford's offense did com
plete the game turnover-free and
also successfully capitalized on Ari

zona's turnovers. Thirteen of Stan
ford's 20 points came off three Wild
cat turnovers.
Stanford did not fare as well on
the ground, posting only 58 yards on
32 carries. Edwards' 32 rushing yards
on nine carries paced the anemic

rushing attack for the second straight
week.
"Offensively, I think we struggled,
but did enough of the good things
that we had to do," Harris said. "We
didn't do everything that we were
supposed to do or have to do, but we
didn't beat ourselves, and that's a
good formula."
Because of the Cardinal's offen
sive struggles, Arizona was never out
of the game, but smart play and smart
coaching down the stretch sealed the
victory for Stanford.
With a 20-14 lead and only 1:06
left in the fourth quarter, Stanford
offense faced third-and-eight from
its own 22. Rather than attempt a
pass, as an incompletion would have
stopped the clock, Harris called for

Edwards to take a knee, allowing the
game clock to run down to 17 sec
onds before the next play.
On the next play, after draining
every possible second off the clock
and even taking a delay of game
penalty in the process, Stanford jun
ior punter Jay Ottevegio ran out of
the back of the end zone for a safety,
in order to give the Wildcats worse
field position for their ensuing drive.
The tactic worked, and with the aid
of a 15-yard late hit penalty, Arizona
was unable to reach the end zone on
a last-second desperation heave.
"I thought we managed the clock
about as well as we could," Harris
said. "With their timeouts, we could
n't run the clock out. I thought we
handled it and gave Arizona very lit-

tie opportunity with the long field."
The loss was the fourth in a row
for the Wildcats, who failed to build
upon their strong offensive perform
ance against No. 1 Southern Califor
nia the week previous. Arizona has
not posted a winning season since
1998, and that streak could continue
this season unless the Wildcats can
somehow win every remaining game.
"This was a must-win game, and
we didn't come out with the win,"
Arizona running back Mike Bell said
after the game.
Bell led the rush attack for the
Wildcats, rushing for 88 yards and
one touchdown. Bell's 88-yard total
was higher than Arizona's team
rushing average entering Saturday's
game.
Richard Kovalcheck threw for
161 yards for Arizona but also
coughed up two interceptions and
two fumbles.
Undoubtedly, Wildcat mistakes
contributed to Arizona's offensive
failure. However, the Stanford de
fense played noticeably better as the
game wore on, allowing Arizona

only 83 total yards in the second half.
"I thought that our defense was
n't very good early, but boy, they
changed later in the game and played
tremendous the whole second half,"
Harris said. "Arizona has weapons
and they were playing at home —
they had the crowd."
Stanford senior linebacker Jon
Alston played particularly well, sack
ing Kovalcheck three times and forc
ing a fumble.
"I'm just trying to play like I ex
pect myself to play," Alston said. "It's
my last year, and as a senior I want to
lead. In order to elevate the way this
team plays, I'm going to have to ele
vate the way I play. Guys respond to
leaders who not only talk, but also
show action, and that's what I tried to
do today. Hopefully we get better
week-by-week."
Saturday's contest continued a
trend of close victories, as all of Stan
ford's wins this season have been by
fewer than five points. The game also
marked the first time that Stanford
has won three straight road games
since 1996.
