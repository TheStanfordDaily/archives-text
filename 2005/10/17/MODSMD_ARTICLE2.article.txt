# Earthquake relief effort gains momentum
## 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WRITER 
Members of the student group Pakistanis
at Stanford (PAS) launched a formal relief ef
fort Wednesday night to benefit the victims of
the Oct. 8 earthquake in Pakistan-adminis
tered Kashmir. The 7.6 quake killed an esti
mated 38,000 people, leaving at least 62,000
others injured.
The relief effort, which can be accessed at
the PAS Web site — http://pas.stanford.edu
— has already generated over $4,(KK) in dona
tions, according to PAS member and relief or
ganizer Uzair Nasim, a junior.
"Nearly $1,400 has been donated online.

sl,ooo was collected from various dorms the
very night we launched our effort, $1,000 was
donated by members of the Islamic Society
and the rest was given by people to our mem
bers over the last few days," he said.
Sohail Razzaq, a freshman PAS member
and relief organizer from Karachi, Pakistan,
commented on the University community's
reaction to the fundraiser.
"The response from the student body and
faculty has been thoroughly encouraging," he
said.
The group has collaborated with the ASSU
and the Office of Student Activities to make
the relief effort a reality. Other student organ
izations, including Stanford Students for Re

lief (SSR) — which organized similar
fundraisers to benefit victims of the tsunami
and Hurricane Katrina — the Islamic Society
of Stanford University, Sanskriti, the Stanford
India Association, the Muslim Students
Awareness Network, the Bechtel Internation
al Center and the Society for International
Affairs at Stanford support the cause.
"Right now, the structure of the relief is
such that the members of PAS do most of the
planning since we meet every evening anyway
because of Ramadan and then our liaison of
ficer sends an update to other groups to get
feedback from them," Nasim explained.
The contributions will be forwarded to the
aid groups that PAS believes benefit the vie-

Tims the most.
"We plan to give to NGOs (non-govern
mental organizations) on a rolling basis so
that the money doesn't just sit idle in our ac
count," Nasim said. "We are only giving to or
ganizations that are federally registered in the
U.S. We aim to donate to the Edhi Foundation,
which is probably the NGO with the widest
impact in Pakistan, the Red Cross/Red Cres
cent, Unicef and the President's Fund."
According to Razzaq, even the smallest
contribution can have a huge impact. One U.S.
dollar equals almost 60 Pakistan Rupees,
which is enough to buy clean drinking water
for one person for five days. Similar
ly, $2 can feed a person for a day, $3
can buy sanitary amenities for one
victim and $4 buys one blanket. Just
$10 can provide basic medical atten
tion to one earthquake victim.
In addition to the announce
ments that PAS made at house meet
ings last week, the group plans to set
up a table in White Plaza where
group members can educate the
community about the devastation
and where students can donate via
cash or check. PAS members also
plan to contact alumni and would
like to appeal to corporate and social
organizations beyond the Stanford
community for help.
According to Nasim, none of the
group members' relatives were
killed or injured in the quake.
"Thankfully my family is safe,"
said Razzaq. "However, I have emo

tionally felt the pain of the earth
quake victims as my best friend has
lost four members of his family."
Nasim said he shared Razzaq's
concern.
"The situation now is just really
depressing," he said. "The death toll
has risen to 38,0(X) and more people
have been rendered homeless than
they were following the tsunami.The
whole region is mountainous and the
extreme climate just compounds the
misery. As hard as it may be to be
lieve, most of the homeless are prob
ably still fasting to observe the holy
month of Ramadan."
PAS is currently taking steps to
extend its scope beyond White Plaza.
The group set up a table at the Hindu
Student Council-organized Navratri
event on Saturday night and wants to
target audiences at sporting events
for donations.
"We just went to an event spon
sored by the Hindus Student Council
last night and we aim to be present at
a lot of similar shows to collect
funds," Nasim said.
"I think that the relief effort is a

great idea," said sophomore Katie
Ostrager. "1 think that most students
will want to help in any way they can,
so it's important that PAS makes its
cause and presence well-known."
Students interested in helping out
are highly encouraged to visit the
PAS Web site.
"This fundraiser will go on for at
least another two weeks, and we urge
all members of the Stanford commu
nity to please open their hearts and
help humanity in any way they can,"
Razzaq said. "Every penny counts."
