# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## No. 3 volleyball splits Pac-10 desert road swing 
### ANDREW LOMELI 
No one said the road to a second-straight
NCAA championship would be easy for the
No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball team (17-3,
7-2 Pacific-10 Conference). Indeed, the Cardi
nal ran into a five-game heartbreaking road
block at No. 12 Arizona (14-2,6-1) on Thurs
day, before rebounding with a three-game
sweep of Arizona State (6-11,1-6) on Friday.
Going into Thursday night's match, Stan
ford had not dropped a match to the Wildcats
since 2002. A hungry Arizona team, deter
mined to make a statement in the competi
tive Pac-10, made sure that streak stopped
this season.
The Cardinal took the Wildcats to the
limit in five games but eventually fell 24-30,
30-26,31-29,32-34, and 8-15.
"It was a matter of them being very psy
ched up for the match," Stanford head coach
John Dunning said. "They showed us they
were very excited, and they had a very good
crowd. They just did a good job against us."
Game one saw the teams struggle for con
trol during the first 10 points, before Arizona's
blocking befuddled the Cardinal attack. Stan
ford did not advance its own cause by record
ing several costly serving errors during the
game. The Cardinal pulled within two but
could not respond to Arizona's explosive of
fense, which led the way to the win, 30-24.
The Cardinal responded in the second
game with their own blocking game, some
thing they had lacked in game one. The third
game saw Arizona rally back from a late 27-
21 deficit to a 29-29 tie, before a failed Ari
zona block — off a kill from junior outside
hitter Kristin Richards — ended the game.
Both teams exchanged the lead several
times in game four. Stanford jumped to the
early 10-5 lead, but Arizona would not sur
render. After numerous tense game and
match points, Arizona's senior outside
hitter Kim Glass forced a fifth game with a
game-winning kill.
Ironically, the fifth and decisive game
proved anti-climactic. The Wildcats took an
early 4-1 edge, before Dunning called a time
out to stem the Arizona surge. The strategy
worked briefly, as freshman middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo recorded a kill after the
break. However, Arizona answered right
back with a 6-2 run, and Stanford could not
recover. The Cardinal closed to within four
before Arizona's offense led the hometown
Wildcats to the 15-8 win.
The Cardinal faced a major scare toward
the end of the fifth game, as star sophomore
setter Bryn Kehoe limped off the court in
tears, grabbing her right leg in pain after an
Arizona kill. Kehoe immediately shook off
the pain to rejoin the team huddle in time for

the Wildcats to score their final two points in
their win.
Dunning said Stanford learned a valuable
lesson in humility from the match.
"I think the players have gotten to see that
it isn't just the number one and the number
two team in the country that we have had bat
tles with and lost," he said. "Going into Ari
zona, we thought they were good; we weren't
sure but now we have more information. We
know that there are other teams in the coun
try that can play with us, and we know there
are things that we have to get better at and
there is no excuse. You either do it or you
don't, and our team knows that now."
The Wildcats dominated the blocking game,
collecting 16 blocks compared to the Cardinal's
five on the match. Arizona also outhit Stanford
.274 to .232 in the contest. Richards led the Car
dinal's offense with 20 kills while Arizona's
Glass collected 27 of her own.
One bright spot for Stanford in the Ari
zona contest was the performance of junior
outside hitter Nji Nnanami, who registered a
career-high 15 kills.
The following night, the Cardinal
trounced Arizona State in Tempe in three
games. The match was the Sun Devils' sixth
straight loss.
The Sun Devils kept the first game tight
early on before Stanford blew open the con
test with a 29-21 lead. Barboza ended the
game with a kill, one of her 14 for the night,
for a 30-22 game one final.
After falling behind early in game two, the
Cardinal rallied from a 16-18 deficit with a 9-
0 run and cruised to the 30-23 victory. Stan
ford held Arizona State to a .095 hitting per
centage in the game.
After tying the third game at 6-6, the Car
dinal never again trailed in the match. A Sun
Devil service error ultimately handed Stan
ford the 30-19 win.
"I thought that after Thursday's loss, we
played with a lot more fight and energy,"
Nnamani said. "Losing isn't fun, but you al
ways want to learn from your losses. We
wanted to improve upon what we did
(against Arizona] and try to have a good start
on Friday to the rest of our season."
Dunning added that despite Stanford's
two Pac-10 losses, the conference title is still
within grasp.
"There are still three or four teams that are
right there and that are going to determine the
second half," Dunning said. "We are clearly
one of them. It's going to be difficult for any
body to catch Washington but it's possible."
Nnamani echoed Dunning's sentiments.
"No matter where you go, everyone wants
to fight hard and do their best to try to take a
share of the Pac-10," she said. "We have to be
ready to fight every weekend."
