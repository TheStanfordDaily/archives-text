# "If it looks weird, don't go near": 23 tips for Full Moon enjoyment
## 
### 
Full Moon on the Quad is here again, and
you're probably asking yourself if you really
want to participate in something so immature,
so jejune, so trite. How you say in America...? Total
ly iame.
I have an answer: Just say "no" to any impulse
that drives you to stay in your dorm room, huddled
under blankets. This is a Stanford tradition, proba
bly thought up by some craven senior boy who
wanted an excuse to stick his tongue down the gul
lets of innocent freshman girls.
I say, let's find that man and proclaim him king
for inventing the idea. Without him, Stanford guys
would get no play at all.
But don't take it from me. I have never actually
kissed anyone at Full Moon. But I have tried. And
have been slapped.
That, however, does not have to be your fate. In
the hope that you learn from my mistakes, I have
prepared the following list of 23 rules and regula
tions for Full Moon. (23, by the way, is the average
age of the seniors you frosh will be kissing.)
1. It is against University rules to drink.
2. It is only fun if you're drunk. Unfortunately,
everyone else is drunk, too. Prepare for the lapping
dog kiss.
3. Hit the showers today (that means you, SLE
kids).
4. As your PHE will gladly tell you, don't brush
your teeth — use mouthwash. Brushing your teeth
opens up the pores of your gums, bringing mono —
the dreaded foe of all hardworking Stanford stu
dents — that much closer. Which brings me to my
next point.
5. If it looks weird, don't go near. This includes
naked people and people who have open sores.
Also, anyone from the band (they're the ones
dressed up like characters from Where the Wild
Things Are).
6. But you can and should kiss the tree. It's a free
bielTake it!
7. Kisses on the cheek from Dollies are also worth-
