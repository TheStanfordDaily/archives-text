# "If it looks weird, don't go near": 23 tips for Full Moon enjoyment
## 
### 
Full Moon on the Quad is here again, and
you're probably asking yourself if you really
want to participate in something so immature,
so jejune, so trite. How you say in America...? Total
ly iame.
I have an answer: Just say "no" to any impulse
that drives you to stay in your dorm room, huddled
under blankets. This is a Stanford tradition, proba
bly thought up by some craven senior boy who
wanted an excuse to stick his tongue down the gul
lets of innocent freshman girls.
I say, let's find that man and proclaim him king
for inventing the idea. Without him, Stanford guys
would get no play at all.
But don't take it from me. I have never actually
kissed anyone at Full Moon. But I have tried. And
have been slapped.
That, however, does not have to be your fate. In
the hope that you learn from my mistakes, I have
prepared the following list of 23 rules and regula
tions for Full Moon. (23, by the way, is the average
age of the seniors you frosh will be kissing.)
1. It is against University rules to drink.
2. It is only fun if you're drunk. Unfortunately,
everyone else is drunk, too. Prepare for the lapping
dog kiss.
3. Hit the showers today (that means you, SLE
kids).
4. As your PHE will gladly tell you, don't brush
your teeth — use mouthwash. Brushing your teeth
opens up the pores of your gums, bringing mono —
the dreaded foe of all hardworking Stanford stu
dents — that much closer. Which brings me to my
next point.
5. If it looks weird, don't go near. This includes
naked people and people who have open sores.
Also, anyone from the band (they're the ones
dressed up like characters from Where the Wild
Things Are).
6. But you can and should kiss the tree. It's a free
bielTake it!
7. Kisses on the cheek from Dollies are also worth-

while.
8. But forget about the Pi Phi girls.
Don't even try. It's a trap to make you
look silly. They don't really want to
kiss anyone. Especially the ones
wearing shirts that read Kiss a Pi Phi.'
They have sentries out there, making
sure that you don't come within 10
feet of one of them. Sorry, I don't
mean to rant. It's not like I'm speak
ing from experience or anything...
9. In general, he ready for rejection.
It happens. Roll with it. And tomor
row, if you've had enough to drink,
you won't remember it anyways.
10. Be efficient. If you spend your
time looking for the perfect date, you
won't find it. Which segues nicely

into point 11.
11. The people you want to kiss?
They won't want to kiss you. And the
people who want to kiss you. you
don't even want to sit next to in
Ilium.This is a time-honored truth.
Deal with it.
12. No. 11 applies to naked people as
well.
13. There will be kisses that you just
don't want to receive. You could be
blindsided in the open field, hit by a
sneak attack. But there are no refer
ees to call personal fouls, so be pre
pared to cover your mouth and
scream,"l have herpes!"
14. Watch out for the Paly High girls
(they're underage!). They will usual
ly break down and reveal themselves
under close questioning. They will
also say things like, "I just want to
kiss a college guy!"
15. If you've been rejected a lot, look
'or high-school-aged kids. They'll

kiss you! They don't know any bet
ter! They're underage!
16. Stay in the middle of the field and
hold your ground. That's where you
will get the most action.
17. Stay with a teammate or two. It
strips your target of the "1 want to
kiss you, but what about my friend?"
excuse. Also, people won't think
you're as much of a loser. You will
probably also want to make sure that
your friend is less attractive than
Clint Howard (look him up on
IMDB).
18. Wear a jersey that reads "Senior."
Works every time. I don't care if
you're a freshman, your chances are
still better with girls in your class
than with bored seniors.
19. It's easy to tell the actual seniors.
They are the ones not wearing shirts
that read "Senior."
20. Watch out for the Boot-and-
Rally. That is, the person who boots

— throws up on the edge of the quad
— then decides to rally — head back
in and stick their tongue down some
one's mouth. You can usually tell
these people by the spittle hanging
from their chins.
21. Talking only makes it more awk
ward.
22. Spit out your gum, for God's sake.
23. Write a column about kissing peo
ple at Full Moon and make people
feel sorry for you by saying you've
never kissed anyone. Although it
could backfire and make people
think that you're a loser and that you
don't deserve to be kissed. Damn.

11. The people you want to kiss?
They won't want to kiss you. And the
people who want to kiss you. you
don't even want to sit next to in
Ilium.This is a time-honored truth.
Deal with it.
12. No. 11 applies to naked people as
well.
13. There will be kisses that you just
don't want to receive. You could be
blindsided in the open field, hit by a
sneak attack. But there are no refer
ees to call personal fouls, so be pre
pared to cover your mouth and
scream,"l have herpes!"
14. Watch out for the Paly High girls
(they're underage!). They will usual
ly break down and reveal themselves
under close questioning. They will
also say things like, "I just want to
kiss a college guy!"
15. If you've been rejected a lot, look
'or high-school-aged kids. They'll

kiss you! They don't know any bet
ter! They're underage!
16. Stay in the middle of the field and
hold your ground. That's where you
will get the most action.
17. Stay with a teammate or two. It
strips your target of the "1 want to
kiss you, but what about my friend?"
excuse. Also, people won't think
you're as much of a loser. You will
probably also want to make sure that
your friend is less attractive than
Clint Howard (look him up on
IMDB).
18. Wear a jersey that reads "Senior."
Works every time. I don't care if
you're a freshman, your chances are
still better with girls in your class
than with bored seniors.
19. It's easy to tell the actual seniors.
They are the ones not wearing shirts
that read "Senior."
20. Watch out for the Boot-and-
Rally. That is, the person who boots

— throws up on the edge of the quad
— then decides to rally — head back
in and stick their tongue down some
one's mouth. You can usually tell
these people by the spittle hanging
from their chins.
21. Talking only makes it more awk
ward.
22. Spit out your gum, for God's sake.
23. Write a column about kissing peo
ple at Full Moon and make people
feel sorry for you by saying you've
never kissed anyone. Although it
could backfire and make people
think that you're a loser and that you
don't deserve to be kissed. Damn.

Full Moon on the Quad is here again, and
you're probably asking yourself if you really
want to participate in something so immature,
so jejune, so trite. How you say in America...? Total
ly iame.
I have an answer: Just say "no" to any impulse
that drives you to stay in your dorm room, huddled
under blankets. This is a Stanford tradition, proba
bly thought up by some craven senior boy who
wanted an excuse to stick his tongue down the gul
lets of innocent freshman girls.
I say, let's find that man and proclaim him king
for inventing the idea. Without him, Stanford guys
would get no play at all.
But don't take it from me. I have never actually
kissed anyone at Full Moon. But I have tried. And
have been slapped.
That, however, does not have to be your fate. In
the hope that you learn from my mistakes, I have
prepared the following list of 23 rules and regula
tions for Full Moon. (23, by the way, is the average
age of the seniors you frosh will be kissing.)
1. It is against University rules to drink.
2. It is only fun if you're drunk. Unfortunately,
everyone else is drunk, too. Prepare for the lapping
dog kiss.
3. Hit the showers today (that means you, SLE
kids).
4. As your PHE will gladly tell you, don't brush
your teeth — use mouthwash. Brushing your teeth
opens up the pores of your gums, bringing mono —
the dreaded foe of all hardworking Stanford stu
dents — that much closer. Which brings me to my
next point.
5. If it looks weird, don't go near. This includes
naked people and people who have open sores.
Also, anyone from the band (they're the ones
dressed up like characters from Where the Wild
Things Are).
6. But you can and should kiss the tree. It's a free
bielTake it!
7. Kisses on the cheek from Dollies are also worth-

Howell

while.
8. But forget about the Pi Phi girls.
Don't even try. It's a trap to make you
look silly. They don't really want to
kiss anyone. Especially the ones
wearing shirts that read Kiss a Pi Phi.'
They have sentries out there, making
sure that you don't come within 10
feet of one of them. Sorry, I don't
mean to rant. It's not like I'm speak
ing from experience or anything...
9. In general, he ready for rejection.
It happens. Roll with it. And tomor
row, if you've had enough to drink,
you won't remember it anyways.
10. Be efficient. If you spend your
time looking for the perfect date, you
won't find it. Which segues nicely

into point 11.
