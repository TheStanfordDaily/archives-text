# Swimming notches "W" in opener
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES 
Men's swimming eased into its season-opener Fri
day at Washington, focusing more on bringing less-ex
perienced freshmen into the fold than on scoring
points and breaking records. Even using this'tactic,
though, the Cardinal still managed to trump the
Huskies 111-94.
The dual meet was the first collegiate competition
for eight of Stanford's 11 freshmen, who comprise
nearly half of the squad. In order to introduce them to
college-level competition and to gauge their poten
tial, the coaches included the freshmen as much as
possible in Friday's meet.
"We had the ability to swim many different line
ups, and with the lineup we swam, that was the type of
win we're looking for," assistant coach Ted Knapp
said. "We could've done some things with our lineup
to make the meet a lot closer, and we could've swum
people in their stronger events, which would've made
us win by even more."
As is, however, the team — particularly freshman
Nate Cass — pulled through with good showings.
Cass won the 200-yard IM with a time of 1:53:91 and
followed that victory with a fourth-place finish in the
200 backstroke (1:53.93).
"Cass really had a great swim in that 200 IM,"
Knapp said. "It really helped build some momentum
for freshmen to stand up and win that event in an
away meet. I thought that was wonderful."
Freshman Paul Kornfeld also stood out, placing
second in the 200 breaststroke (2:07.16), and swim
ming the second leg of a 400 medley relay that placed
second in 3:29.36.
Kornfeld stated he was slightly disappointed with
his times but admitted to feeling pressure in his first
college dual meet.
"The intensity was so much higher than I am used
to, especially at this point in the season," Kornfeld
said. "It was very nerve-wracking for me because I
could feel a lot of pressure on my shoulders to do well.
I'm not used to having this intense and nerve-wrack
ing of a meet so early on in the season. It will have to
be something to get used to in the coming years."
However, with the rest of the season still to come,
Kornfeld feels the experience should spur him to
even greater future success.
"I think having one meet under my belt now
should be a huge confidence-booster for upcoming
meets," Kornfeld said. "The upperclassmen did a very
good job of trying to take the pressure off some of the

freshmen and helping us out."
One upperclassman who made a big impression
was junior Shaun Philips, who placed first in the 2(M)
freestyle (1:41.91).
"I was just happy to put some fire under our
team," Phillips said. "We lost the first relay and the
I,(XX) free, so we needed the boost. After the 2(K). we
began to get back on track."
Phillips also won the S(H) free in a time of 4:35.97.
"That was another chance to show our guys, espe
cially the freshmen, that we had things under control
and were more than capable of winning the meet,"
Phillips said.
Nonetheless, Phillips called his times irrelevant, in
stead stressing the importance of giving the freshmen
experience.
"We asked a lot of them and pushed the stress fac
tors to the limit," Phillips said, "ITiat they pushed
through, helped us win the meet and got invaluable
experience is exactly what we wanted from them. We
weren't asking for record-breaking times, only for

them to give an honest effort, learn from their mis
takes and learn from upperclassmen examples. They
did those things, so we're proud of them for that."
Based on the efforts from Phillips and juniors Ben
Wildman-Tobriner and Hongzhe Sun — who placed
first in the KM) free (45.93) and 2(X) butterfly (48.45),
respectively — the Cardinal are optimistic about fu
ture prospects for its upperclassmen. But the squad
can also now be confident in the potential of its fresh
men class.
"Overall, I think the freshmen contributed the
best they could, but there is a lot of room for improve
ment," Kornfeld said. "For Stanford to really excel
this year, it is going to be up to the freshmen to really
step up and help contribute to this team, hopefully in
a large way. We have potential — we just have to fol
low through, and I think we will."
The men's next meet is an exhibition against alum
ni this Saturday at home. Competitive swimming re
sumes Nov. 9 when cross-bay rival Cal visits for a dual
meet.
