# Water polo falls to USC, tops UCLA, places third at NorPac
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Going into this weekend's competi
tion, the No. 4 Cardinal (11-3, 1-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
knew that they would be facing a gruel
ing midseason challenge. After starting
the weekend with a 10-3 victory over
No. 12 Loyola Marymount Friday
evening, men's water polo concluded
their weekend with a 6-5 victory over
UCLA to place third at the 2005 Nor-
Cal Open tournament.
The Cardinal opened the weekend
on a positive note, overwhelming the
visiting Lions 10-3. The early stages of
the game developed similarly to Stan
ford's other victories this season.
Senior captain Peter Varellas put
the Cardinal on the board first, and
freshman two-meter Will Hindle-Katel
and junior driver Marcello Pantuliano
built the Stanford lead to 3-0 with goals
in the closing minutes of the first peri
od.
Senior captain Thomas Hopkins
opened the second period by outma
neuvering LMU goalie lan Elliot to
sneak in another goal.The Cardinal de
fense, meanwhile, continued to stifle
the Lion offense until junior driver Ben
Easton broke the shutout in the final
seconds of the first half, bringing the
halftime score to 4-1.
The Stanford men effectively put
the game out of reach with a rejuvenat
ed attack that produced three more
goals in the third period. When the
clock ran down on regulation, the
scoreboard read 10-3 in favor of the
Cardinal. Both Varellas and Hopkins
managed to complete their hat tricks,
and Hindle-Katel and freshman driver
Chris Jacobsen rounded out the scor
ing. Sophomore Sandy Hohener and
junior Beau Stockstill split the goal
keeping duties for the game and posted
a combined six saves on the day.
Riding the momentum of their sec

ond consecutive seven-goal victory, the
Cardinal traveled to Berkeley for their
first two scheduled matches of the 2005
NorCal Open. After finishing tourna
ment runners-up a month ago at the
2005 SoCal Open despite a No. 4 seed
in the tournament, the Cardinal had
high hopes for a similarly inspired per
formance this weekend.
First, Stanford uneventfully dis
patched of the No. 16 Air Force Falcons
15-5 in its tournament opener.
Seven different Stanford players
contributed scores,and freshman goalie
Jimmy Sandman posted 10 saves in the
victory.
In the Cardinal's second contest of
the day, it was Hohener's chance to rise
to the occasion in net. Taking on No. 5
UC-San Diego, the Cardinal found

themselves battling for every edge they
could find. After the squads ended the
first period tied 2-2, the Tritons surged
to take a 5-3 halftime lead. However,
junior two-meter defender J. J. Garton
whizzed in two-goals on the contest,
propelling the Cardinal to a 6-6 tie at
the end of regulation.
During the two periods of standard
overtime play, the Cardinal and the Tri
tons each produced a goal apiece, and
the game headed for sudden-death with
the score knotted 7-7. Hohener and the
Stanford defense were able to fend off
the San Diego attack just long enough
for Hopkins to break away on a coun
terattack to bury the game-winner.
Launched into Sunday's semifinals
in dramatic fashion, Stanford found it
self facing rival Southern California —

the tournament's No. 2 seed. The TYo
jans exploded for five goals in the
opening period of play, though the Car
dinal caught up in the second half,
outscoring USC 4-3, it was too late as
the Trojans held on for a 10-9 win.
Despite the final result, the Cardinal
did not walk away from the game total
ly demoralized.
"Even though we ended up losing
by a goal, we played a pretty solid
game," Hindle-Katel said. "We were
down by a lot early, but we ended up
coming back to the point that we had a
chance to send it into overtime."
The Cardinal squad again demon
strated that resilience in the third-place
game Sunday afternoon against the
top-ranked UCLA Bruins. For the sec
ond game in a row, the Cardinal found
themselves facing an early deficit —
but this time, they battled back for a
hard-fought 6-5 victory, their second
upset of the Bruins in less than a
month.
"We didn't change anything, be
cause we had a good game plan," Hin
dle-Katel said. "We knew that if we just
kept chipping away, we were going to
get it."
Sure enough, trailing 4-1 midway
through the third period, the Cardinal
tallied three unanswered goals to tie
the contest at four apiece heading into
the final period.
The Stanford squad then pulled out
the victory with two goals and an effec
tive defensive effort that limited the
Bruins to a single tally in the closing
minutes of the contest.
"We were really tired but played
tough defense throughout the game."
redshirt junior Tyler Drake said.
"Throughout the weekend we played
really tough five-on-six defense. Al
though we were not in the champi
onship game, we felt the weekend was
successful to the extent that it showed
us that we could continue to play tough
after a lone weekend."
