## Cal, Sulprizio top Stanford, 2-0, in a heartwrenching loss 
### WENDI GOH 
A sea of dejected faces looked on as the final whistle blew at
Maloney Field on Saturday. The Cardinal players, many with
light tears in their eyes, applauded half-heartedly to their fans be
fore slumping off. On the other side of the field, triumphant play
ers and fans in blue and yellow celebrated their short trip across
the Bay Area, which had resulted in a California (10-2-1,3-0-0
Pacific-10 Conference) 2-0 victory over Stanford (8-4-1,2-1-0).
For most of the match, little separated the Bay Area rivals.
The ball streaked up and down the field as the Golden Bears
and the Cardinal each struggled for possession. Both squads
displayed moments of brilliance, and threatened with scoring
chances. Despite the offensive fireworks, Stanford's freshman
keeper Alex Gamble and Cal's senior goalie Ashley Sulprizio,
kept the game scoreless for the majority of the contest, combin
ing to record 11 saves.
In the 71st minute, however, Cal broke the stalemate. Gam
ble deflected a Cal rocket wide of the net but conceded a cor
ner to the Golden Bears in the process. Junior forward Kate
Ratican coolly floated the corner in front of the Cardinal goal,
and sophomore Caroline Lea finished the play with a header
for Cal's game-winner.
Although the Cardinal continued to fight for the remainder of
the game, the Bears cemented their victory less than 10 minutes
later when sophomore Stephanie Wieger knocked in another
Ratican corner. Ratican now leads the Bears in assists this season.
"It was a tough loss," Stanford co-captain Hayley Hunt said.
"I think we played pretty well, and it could have gone either
way... It was just a mental breakdown a little bit on corners, but
we fought hard, especially in the second half. We came out and
fought physically."
With Cal only barely outshooting Stanford, 11-8, Stanford
head coach Paul Ratcliffe adamantly believed the Cardinal
played as well as the Bears.
"I thought it was a very even game," Ratcliffe said. "I
thought we dominated at times, and they had other spells that
were just as positive.The difference in the game was two corner
kicks where I think they just pushed our players out of the way.
They have some tall players, so physically they were just
stronger in the box."
Both squads credited Sulprizio for the Cal victory.The Bears'
keeper played an outstanding game, denying the Cardinal a goal
by snagging six saves. The contest marked Sulprizio's seventh
shutout this season, and the senior now leads the conference
with seven shutouts, though Gamble is just one mark behind.
"I think their goalie played really well," Ratcliffe said. "We
came out with a few good chances. Cal's keeper came out with
a few key saves."
While Stanford's attack created dangerous advances on the
Cal goal, the home team's failure to score reminded the Cardi
nal of the need to work on finishing.
"We need to continue to get better up front" Ratcliffe
noted. "We obviously need to keep working on our physical
presence in the box and just being a lot tougher."
The loss snaps the Cardinal's five-game win streak, but with
six games remaining in the conference. Hunt is determined not
to let the defeat dictate the rest of the team's season.
"We'll learn from it and move on to the next Pac-10 game,"
Hunt said. "Finishing is always something our team can work
on, and I think we'll be working on some of that this week. I
think we've been playing well and our possession is outstand
ing, so hopefully we'll carry our previous momentum into the
next game."

stronger in the box."
Both squads credited Sulprizio for the Cal victory.The Bears'
keeper played an outstanding game, denying the Cardinal a goal
by snagging six saves. The contest marked Sulprizio's seventh
shutout this season, and the senior now leads the conference
with seven shutouts, though Gamble is just one mark behind.
"I think their goalie played really well," Ratcliffe said. "We
came out with a few good chances. Cal's keeper came out with
a few key saves."
While Stanford's attack created dangerous advances on the
Cal goal, the home team's failure to score reminded the Cardi
nal of the need to work on finishing.
"We need to continue to get better up front" Ratcliffe
noted. "We obviously need to keep working on our physical
presence in the box and just being a lot tougher."
The loss snaps the Cardinal's five-game win streak, but with
six games remaining in the conference. Hunt is determined not
to let the defeat dictate the rest of the team's season.
"We'll learn from it and move on to the next Pac-10 game,"
Hunt said. "Finishing is always something our team can work
on, and I think we'll be working on some of that this week. I
think we've been playing well and our possession is outstand
ing, so hopefully we'll carry our previous momentum into the
next game."

Freshman midfielder/defender Marisa Abegg looks for an
opening, but openings came few and far between for Abegg
and the Cardinal against the Bears.
