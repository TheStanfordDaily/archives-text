# Editorial questions Beinin's political stance
## 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
History Prof. Joel Beinin was harshly criticized
in The Stanford Review last week for a supposed
pro-Palestinian bias in teaching his courses.
The editorial, entitled "Joel Beinin Does Not
Deserve Tenure," was written by Daniel J. Jacobs,
a professor in the Department of Neurology at the
University of Florida and a member of the Stan
ford Class of 1982.
Jacobs saw articles that Beinin sent to The Daily
and posted on the Internet and read an unfavor
able review on Amazon.com of Beinin's book,
"The Dispersion of Egyptian Jewry: Culture, Poli
tics, and the Formation of a Modern Diaspora."
Last spring. Jacobs took Beinin's online course,
"Palestine. Zionism and the Arab-Israeli Con
flict," which is sponsored by a consortium com
posed of Stanford, Yale and Oxford.
"I am not a Middle East scholar," Jacobs said."l
took the class because I had read many of the major
sources through 1985 and needed an update."
Jacob's editorial focused mainly on points of mis
information in lecture and in a video narrative dis
tributed to the class. One of the cited errors caused
the video tape to be recalled and edited. Beinin

claimed that the United States had spent about a tril
lion dollars on aid to the Jewish State since 1948,
when in reality the number is closer to $80 billion.
"The issue is not Beinin's position in favor of
Palestinian claims over Israeli ones, but of his
mediocrity as a historian," Jacobs wrote.
In an interview with The Daily, Professor
Beinin said,"The one correct thing in Dr. Jacobs's
article is that I confused 100 million and one bil
lion. I wrote to him over a year ago apologizing for
this error, and I asked that it be corrected in subse
quent versions of the course."
Jacobs also drew attention to Beinin's involve
ment with several different activist causes, most
notably his defense of Sami Ali-Arian, whom Ja
cobs called an "alleged Jihad terrorist."
One student, who asked to remain anonymous,
attended several sessions of Beinin's course this
quarter and said that he was disturbed by Beinin's
obvious pro-Palestinian stance.
"Even though I agree with Beinin politically, I
felt that his political stance hampered his ability to
teach the class objectively," said the student.
Sophomore Tim Caflisch, who is currently en
rolled in Beinin's course, was quick to jump to his
professor's defense.
"Jacobs' editorial does not affect my view of

the class at all because he was factually incorrect
on a lot of his attacks toward Prof. Beinin,"
Caflisch said. "By taking Beinin's comments out of
context, Jacobs' article begins to look more like a
witch hunt than anything else."
One of the examples that Caflisch cited was Ja
cobs' claim that Beinin said that the modern Pales
tinians are descendants of the Canaanites. Caflisch
said that less than an hour before he read the arti
cle, Beinin explicitly claimed that the modern
Palestinians are not descendants of the Canaan
ites or the Philistines.
Jacobs did not suggest any specific solutions,
but did say that the problem of biased professors
goes far beyond Stanford.
"Beinin states that he presents a narrative, not
a balanced or fair history in his lecture," Jacobs
said. "On the Internet he is quoted as stating that
he considers himself an activist. Beinin and many
historians see no contradiction between the two.
That is decidedly not true."
In response, Beinin told The Daily, "Everyone
who deals with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has
a point of view. Mine is that I favor peaceful coex
istence of the two peoples on the basis of equality
and a solution to the conflict based on the princi
ples of human rights and international law."
