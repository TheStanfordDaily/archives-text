## Prof plans to put human cells in mouse brains 
### DIANNA BAI 
Can the cure to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and a long
list of other fatal genetic diseases be found in the mind
of a mouse? It just might be possible with recent, but

controversial, developments in stem
cell research.
Irving Weissman, director of
Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Bi
ology and Regenerative Medicine,
has worked with the transfer of
human neurons to the brains of mice
for several years now. He has already
bred mice whose brains are com
posed of 1 percent human neurons,
finding that transplanted human

brain cells could successfully connect to a mouse brain.
"Remarkably, even though humans and mice are
separated by millions of years of evolution, human neu
rons responded to the mouse signals," Weissman said.
Now, he wants to initiate a new experiment by trans
planting human brain-stem cells to an inbred strain of
mice whose natural brain cells die before the mice's
birth. Human brain cells would then replace the mice's
own, creating a breed of mice whose brains are com
posed entirely of human neurons.
Although Weissman acknowledged that the exper
iment "may not even work at all" â€” if it were to be
successful, scientists would have a way to study living
human-brain cells in a lab animal. Researchers, ac
cording to Weissman, would then be able to experi
ment on diseased human neurons in lab animals in
ways that they could not with human subjects due to
the high risks.
But even with the potential benefits, blurring the
line between species has always brought up many ethi
cal concerns in the scientific community, as well as neg
ative reactions from the public.
As part of an ethics committee gathered together by
Weissman, Stanford Law Prof. Henry Greely has iden
tified four ethical questions concerning the project.
They include the use of stem cells from aborted fetuses,
the inappropriate use of human tissue and the pain and
suffering of the laboratory mice.
However, the main concern, Greely said, is "running
