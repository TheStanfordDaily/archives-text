## Prof plans to put human cells in mouse brains 
### DIANNA BAI 
Can the cure to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and a long
list of other fatal genetic diseases be found in the mind
of a mouse? It just might be possible with recent, but

controversial, developments in stem
cell research.
Irving Weissman, director of
Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Bi
ology and Regenerative Medicine,
has worked with the transfer of
human neurons to the brains of mice
for several years now. He has already
bred mice whose brains are com
posed of 1 percent human neurons,
finding that transplanted human

brain cells could successfully connect to a mouse brain.
"Remarkably, even though humans and mice are
separated by millions of years of evolution, human neu
rons responded to the mouse signals," Weissman said.
Now, he wants to initiate a new experiment by trans
planting human brain-stem cells to an inbred strain of
mice whose natural brain cells die before the mice's
birth. Human brain cells would then replace the mice's
own, creating a breed of mice whose brains are com
posed entirely of human neurons.
Although Weissman acknowledged that the exper
iment "may not even work at all" — if it were to be
successful, scientists would have a way to study living
human-brain cells in a lab animal. Researchers, ac
cording to Weissman, would then be able to experi
ment on diseased human neurons in lab animals in
ways that they could not with human subjects due to
the high risks.
But even with the potential benefits, blurring the
line between species has always brought up many ethi
cal concerns in the scientific community, as well as neg
ative reactions from the public.
As part of an ethics committee gathered together by
Weissman, Stanford Law Prof. Henry Greely has iden
tified four ethical questions concerning the project.
They include the use of stem cells from aborted fetuses,
the inappropriate use of human tissue and the pain and
suffering of the laboratory mice.
However, the main concern, Greely said, is "running

the risk of conferring aspects of hu
manness in the mice."
In other words, the creation of a
human chimera — a mouse with
human consciousness.
In Greek mythology, chimeras
were hybrid creatures with bodies of
goats, heads of lions and tails of
snakes. But both Weissman and
Greely agreed that the project in
question is nowhere near so sensa
tional.
This past July, Sen. Sam Brown
back (R-Kan.) introduced a bill to
prohibit the creation of human
chimeras. If passed, the new legisla
tion would ban experiments like
Weissman's, even making them sub
ject to criminal penalty.
"If passed, the legislation might

make it a 10-year prison sentence to
conduct experiments like these,"
Greely said.
He also mentioned that the
strongest reaction from the public to
human chimeras is usually the "vuck
factor."
"People have talked about giving
this mouse a human brain, but that
would not be true" Greely said. "It
would be unlikely to truly impossible
for these mice to exhibit human abili
ty"
He stressed that neurons only
comprise about 10 percent of the
brain, while the connections between
neurons are what scientist believe de
termine consciousness. Greely de
scribed neurons as the bricks that
make up the brain.
"A church built with red bricks in
stead of gray will still be a church be
cause the framework has not changed,
just as the structure of the mouse's
brain has not changed," he said.
"What's important is the architecture.

not the bricks."
Stanford students surveyed also
doubted the possibility of someone
creating a "Stuart Little."
"I'd be interested to see the results
of the experiment, but I don't think
the mouse is going to get up and start
talking." said freshman Jonathan
Scrafford. "But if it did. then it would
raise some issues."
Others said they did not believe
the experiment raised any serious eth
ical questions.
"It doesn't bother me that much,"
said junior Daniel Jacobs. "Even if the
worst thing happened and all the
human behavior was transferred to a
mouse, it wouldn't be that bad."
Junior Andrew Liefer, the technol
ogy columnist for The Daily, said he
had mixed feelings about the experi
ment.
"All this research is good because
it's helping solve a lot of problems, but
it'd be nice if people thought about the
ethical concerns a little more," he said.

Greely's recommendation to
Weissman was to forge ahead step-by
step and to look for humanness in the
structure of the mouse brain before
proceeding further.
"If everything looks mouse-like,go
forward. If anything looks un-mouse
like.stop," he said.
But at the moment, Weissman's
proposed mouse project still has not
begun as he waits for the scientific
community's approval after reviewing
the ethical concerns raised by the ex
periment.
"This project will test human neu
ronal cells in a mouse brain micro-en
vironment as a prelude to studying
stem cells that have human genetic
diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
Lou Gehrig's, and cerebral palsy."
Weissman said.
Weissman emphasized the ur
gency of his project as he asked.
"Which of these diseases should we
not be working on as fast as we
can?"
