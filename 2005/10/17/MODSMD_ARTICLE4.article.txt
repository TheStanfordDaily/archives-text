## Students question distribution policy 
### KAT LEWIN 
"A number of organizations, student
publications and local businesses distrib
uted their materials in violation of some of
the houses' policies," said Jane Camarillo,
director of Residential Education.
These violations fueled recent contro
versy over dorms' publication distribution
policies.The current policy is opt-in, requir
ing dorms to post notices if they would like
to allow periodicals to be distributed door
to door. However, according to senior An
drew Hendel. ASSU Senate advocacv com

mittee chair, some people are frustrated by
the current policy.
"Student publications are not allowed to dis
tribute their materials as widely as they would
like," Hendel said in a statement sent toThe Daily.
Last spring, however, an ASSU Senate
bill proposing that the policy be switched to
make door-to-door distribution the default
passed by a 6 percent margin. In an e-mail to
The Daily, Camarillo cited a letter that the
ASSU Senate advocacy committee sent to
resident fellows, urging them to consider
putting the question of door to door distri
bution to an in-house vote.

Some RFs did not consider this a neces
sary precaution. Christine Gabali, an RF in
Roble, chose not to alter the dorm's current
ban on door-to-door distribution.
"Voting is wonderful," Gabali said."lt's a
great right we're given. But sometimes vot
ing is unnecessary — like, let's vote if we
should eat or not — it's common sense.
What's the point of voting for something
that says students can choose for them
selves what publications they want to read?"

„ Publications lay outside of Muwekma-Tah-Ruk days after they were originally distributed. The house does not allow door-to-door distribution.
One of the reasons resident fellows are opposed to unrestricted distribution is the litter and clutter problem it creates.
