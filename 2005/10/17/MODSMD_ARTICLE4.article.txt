## Students question distribution policy 
### KAT LEWIN 
"A number of organizations, student
publications and local businesses distrib
uted their materials in violation of some of
the houses' policies," said Jane Camarillo,
director of Residential Education.
These violations fueled recent contro
versy over dorms' publication distribution
policies.The current policy is opt-in, requir
ing dorms to post notices if they would like
to allow periodicals to be distributed door
to door. However, according to senior An
drew Hendel. ASSU Senate advocacv com

mittee chair, some people are frustrated by
the current policy.
"Student publications are not allowed to dis
tribute their materials as widely as they would
like," Hendel said in a statement sent toThe Daily.
Last spring, however, an ASSU Senate
bill proposing that the policy be switched to
make door-to-door distribution the default
passed by a 6 percent margin. In an e-mail to
The Daily, Camarillo cited a letter that the
ASSU Senate advocacy committee sent to
resident fellows, urging them to consider
putting the question of door to door distri
bution to an in-house vote.

Some RFs did not consider this a neces
sary precaution. Christine Gabali, an RF in
Roble, chose not to alter the dorm's current
ban on door-to-door distribution.
"Voting is wonderful," Gabali said."lt's a
great right we're given. But sometimes vot
ing is unnecessary — like, let's vote if we
should eat or not — it's common sense.
What's the point of voting for something
that says students can choose for them
selves what publications they want to read?"

tribution, according to Camarillo, are
expected to make student publica
tions available in designated spaces in
their first-floor lounges.
Some proponents of door to door
distribution feel this method does
not give publications enough visibili
ty. Junior Alex Medearis, editor-in
chief of The Stanford Review, said
delivering his publication to Roble is
a difficult task.
"There was kind of a free-speech
zone on the side of the lounge,"
Medearis said. "It was a table with
Sports Illustrated and God knows
what else. People don't want to sort
through that to find The Review or
The Progressive."
The Stanford Review is one of the
publications that violated distribu
tion policy this year. Residents of
Soto and Trancos complained of re
ceiving the magazine door to door on
two occasions, Medearis explained.
"I feel it's more annoying than
anything," said Soto resident Jen
nifer Lee, a sophomore. "If both The
Review and The Progressive distrib
uted door to door, it'd make sense,
but the fact that only The Review
does makes me raise an eyebrow."
Material in The Stanford Review
has sparked distribution controversy
in the past. After the magazine pub
lished an editorial comparing the cam
pus group MEChA to the Ku Klux
Klan in 2003. according to Gabali,
some Roble residents had complaints.
"We're in an intellectual environ
ment, so we have to exercise free speech
in a constructive way, a way that exercis
es critical thinking, a way that protects
our students," Gabali said. "Roble is a
very diverse four-class dorm,so we need
to respect everybody."
However, some advocates of door
to door delivery assert that wide dis
tribution promotes freedom of
speech on campus.
"People get offended from time
to time," said junior Jeremy Hoffman
who lives in Roble. "There are many
people in the world who have incred
ibly offensive opinions. It's a part of
life. You deal with it. I think banning
door to door distribution hurts free
speech. It's a bit heavy-handed."
Medearis maintained that the
contents of The Stanford Review fall
under the banner of free speech and

should be protected.
"If we're a campus that supposedly
prides itself on intellectual discourse,
the current policy doesn't really
square with that," Medearis said. "The
current policy stifles dialog, effectively
forcing people to seek out free speech
rather than promoting it internally."
Some students agree that the mul
titude of publications available on
campus makes it difficult to locate
those that are of interest.
"I think that the magazines could
do a better job advertising them
selves," said freshman Stuart Cole
man. "I'm sure there are countless
publications. I could graduate after
four years and find out about a pub
lication I've never heard of that 1
might have liked to read."
Others, however, said they believe
allowing door to door distribution
would not solve this problem.
"If every publication were al
lowed to distribute door to door, it'd
be annoying," Lee said. "If you're
bombarded with stuff, you can't pick
out the ones that are important to
you. You'll just have a huge pile of re
cyclables in your bin."

bill proposing that the policy be switched to
make door-to-door distribution the default
passed by a 6 percent margin. In an e-mail to
The Daily, Camarillo cited a letter that the
ASSU Senate advocacy committee sent to
resident fellows, urging them to consider
putting the question of door to door distri

Some RFs did not consider this a neces

Roble, chose not to alter the dorm's current
ban on door-to-door distribution.

One of the reasons resident fellows are opposed to unrestricted distribution is the litter and clutter problem it creates.
tribution, according to Camarillo, are
expected to make student publica
tions available in designated spaces in
their first-floor lounges.
Some proponents of door to door
distribution feel this method does
not give publications enough visibili
ty. Junior Alex Medearis, editor-in
chief of The Stanford Review, said
delivering his publication to Roble is
a difficult task.
"There was kind of a free-speech
zone on the side of the lounge,"
Medearis said. "It was a table with
Sports Illustrated and God knows
what else. People don't want to sort
through that to find The Review or
The Progressive."
The Stanford Review is one of the
publications that violated distribu
tion policy this year. Residents of
Soto and Trancos complained of re
ceiving the magazine door to door on
two occasions, Medearis explained.
"I feel it's more annoying than
anything," said Soto resident Jen
nifer Lee, a sophomore. "If both The
Review and The Progressive distrib
uted door to door, it'd make sense,
but the fact that only The Review
does makes me raise an eyebrow."
Material in The Stanford Review
has sparked distribution controversy
in the past. After the magazine pub
lished an editorial comparing the cam
pus group MEChA to the Ku Klux
Klan in 2003. according to Gabali,
some Roble residents had complaints.
"We're in an intellectual environ
ment, so we have to exercise free speech
in a constructive way, a way that exercis
es critical thinking, a way that protects
our students," Gabali said. "Roble is a
very diverse four-class dorm,so we need
to respect everybody."
However, some advocates of door
to door delivery assert that wide dis
tribution promotes freedom of
speech on campus.
"People get offended from time
to time," said junior Jeremy Hoffman
who lives in Roble. "There are many
people in the world who have incred
ibly offensive opinions. It's a part of
life. You deal with it. I think banning
door to door distribution hurts free
speech. It's a bit heavy-handed."
Medearis maintained that the
contents of The Stanford Review fall
under the banner of free speech and

should be protected.
"If we're a campus that supposedly
prides itself on intellectual discourse,
the current policy doesn't really
square with that," Medearis said. "The
current policy stifles dialog, effectively
forcing people to seek out free speech
rather than promoting it internally."
Some students agree that the mul
titude of publications available on
campus makes it difficult to locate
those that are of interest.
"I think that the magazines could
do a better job advertising them
selves," said freshman Stuart Cole
man. "I'm sure there are countless
publications. I could graduate after
four years and find out about a pub
lication I've never heard of that 1
might have liked to read."
Others, however, said they believe
allowing door to door distribution
would not solve this problem.
"If every publication were al
lowed to distribute door to door, it'd
be annoying," Lee said. "If you're
bombarded with stuff, you can't pick
out the ones that are important to
you. You'll just have a huge pile of re
cyclables in your bin."
"A number of organizations, student
publications and local businesses distrib
uted their materials in violation of some of
the houses' policies," said Jane Camarillo,
director of Residential Education.
These violations fueled recent contro
versy over dorms' publication distribution
policies.The current policy is opt-in, requir
ing dorms to post notices if they would like
to allow periodicals to be distributed door
to door. However, according to senior An
drew Hendel. ASSU Senate advocacv com

mittee chair, some people are frustrated by
the current policy.
"Student publications are not allowed to dis
tribute their materials as widely as they would
like," Hendel said in a statement sent toThe Daily.
