## President helps fund Club Sports President's Office gives $75,000 to Club Sports 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
"Aim. Shoot. Score!" came the cheers
from Stanford Club Sports and the ASSU
after the President's Office agreed to fund
Club Sports financial aid and postseason
expenses of $75,000 for each of the next
three years.
The additional funding, which will
begin this year, was needed as a result of
Gub Sports not receiving special fees from
graduate students. In order to obtain these
fees, Gub Sports needed support from
both a majority of voters and at least 15
percent of the relevant student population.
Ust April, less than 15 percent of the grad
uate population voted, resulting in Gub
Sports losing around $45,000 in special fees
â€” about 25 percent of its annual budget.
With only 75 percent of its normal fund
ing remaining and the addition of archery,
Club Sports went into crisis mode. It had
only secured funds from the undergradu
ate special fee.
"'We told the clubs to expect substan
tially less funding this year and worked
hard to find additional fundraising oppor
tunities to alleviate the shortfall," said Club
Sports Co-Chair Chris Fesenmaier, an
electrical engineering graduate student.
The ASSU, through the efforts of Exec
utive Cabinet Member David Sanford, a
senior, helped secure the $75,000 in funds
by working closely With Gub Sports lead
ership and the President's Office to devel
op a proposal that addressed all sides of the
issue and fulfilled the expectations of both
parties.
Jeff Wachtcl, as the senior assistant to
University President John Hennessy, re
viewed the proposal, and said he was im
pressed by the ASSU and Gub Sports ini
tiative.
"Gub Sports are an important part of
the lives of many Stanford students," Wach
tel said in an interview with The Daily. "Stu
dents involved with Club Sports spend
considerable time and effort to raise the
bulk of the funding for their activities and
we wanted to ease the burden, at least a lit
tle. We were particularly attracted to the
proposal because it emphasizes an effort to
make this activity available to more stu
dents"
Fesenmaier described himself as "over
joyed and relieved" after learning that
Club Sports had received funding from the
President's Office.
"We had already brought our proposal
to the Athletic Department and were told
that they did not have the funds to spare,"
Fesenmaier said. "When we met with the
President's Office and heard that they
