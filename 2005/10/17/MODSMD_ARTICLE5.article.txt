## President helps fund Club Sports President's Office gives $75,000 to Club Sports 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
"Aim. Shoot. Score!" came the cheers
from Stanford Club Sports and the ASSU
after the President's Office agreed to fund
Club Sports financial aid and postseason
expenses of $75,000 for each of the next
three years.
The additional funding, which will
begin this year, was needed as a result of
Gub Sports not receiving special fees from
graduate students. In order to obtain these
fees, Gub Sports needed support from
both a majority of voters and at least 15
percent of the relevant student population.
Ust April, less than 15 percent of the grad
uate population voted, resulting in Gub
Sports losing around $45,000 in special fees
â€” about 25 percent of its annual budget.
With only 75 percent of its normal fund
ing remaining and the addition of archery,
Club Sports went into crisis mode. It had
only secured funds from the undergradu
ate special fee.
"'We told the clubs to expect substan
tially less funding this year and worked
hard to find additional fundraising oppor
tunities to alleviate the shortfall," said Club
Sports Co-Chair Chris Fesenmaier, an
electrical engineering graduate student.
The ASSU, through the efforts of Exec
utive Cabinet Member David Sanford, a
senior, helped secure the $75,000 in funds
by working closely With Gub Sports lead
ership and the President's Office to devel
op a proposal that addressed all sides of the
issue and fulfilled the expectations of both
parties.
Jeff Wachtcl, as the senior assistant to
University President John Hennessy, re
viewed the proposal, and said he was im
pressed by the ASSU and Gub Sports ini
tiative.
"Gub Sports are an important part of
the lives of many Stanford students," Wach
tel said in an interview with The Daily. "Stu
dents involved with Club Sports spend
considerable time and effort to raise the
bulk of the funding for their activities and
we wanted to ease the burden, at least a lit
tle. We were particularly attracted to the
proposal because it emphasizes an effort to
make this activity available to more stu
dents"
Fesenmaier described himself as "over
joyed and relieved" after learning that
Club Sports had received funding from the
President's Office.
"We had already brought our proposal
to the Athletic Department and were told
that they did not have the funds to spare,"
Fesenmaier said. "When we met with the
President's Office and heard that they
were committed to the vision we had
laid down in the proposal, we were very
excited for the future possibilities."
Sanford was similarly pleased to
leam of the new source of support.
"It's great to know that University
leaders recognize the value of Club
Sports, one of many programs that con
tributes to the overall quality of life for
a wide cross-section of Stanford stu
dents," he said.
The funding from the Presidents
Office will be used to maintain and ex
pand a financial aid program to assist
athletes who need help with dues as
well as to pay for postseason expenses
as teams compete in regional and na
tional championships, according to Fes
enmaier.
The ASSU Executive Cabinet will
further contribute financial resources
to Club Sports this year and hopes that
the Undergraduate Senate and Gradu
ate Student Council (GSC) will also
pledge monetary support.
"Since Club Sports did not receive
a graduate special fee this year. Club
Sports teams with substantial gradu
ate participation are eligible for fund
ing from the general fee through the
Graduate Student Council," said GSC
Co-Chair and electrical engineering

doctoral student Thomas Lee. "I en
courage Club Sports team presidents
and financial officers to review the
GSC funding criteria on the GSC Web
site and submit an application for
funding."
In addition. Club Sports will be eligi
ble for special fees in Spring 2(X)6 as
long as it remains a registered student
group, according to sophomore and
ASSU Funding Coordinator Chris El
more.
Club Sports used to be funded
through the Athletics Department and
more recently by special fees to serve
over 1 .(XX) students.
"Ideally,Club Sports would be com
pletely self-sufficient through in
creased fundraising and an endow
ment, but it will take some time to
reach that point." Fesenmaier said.
"Until then, we will continue to depend
on special fees and explore other
fundraising opportunities such as con
cessions and vending."
Leaders within the ASSU have been
working with Club Sports leadership
since spring quarter to build a more sus
tainable financial plan for the program,
which offers Stanford students 16 Club
Sports options.
"The ASSU is working with Club
Sports to develop an endowment pro
gram and alumni network," said senior
and ASSU Vice President Aneto
Okonkwo. "We are also working with
Club Sports to strengthen their alterna
tive sources of funding and fundraising

activities.
Lee emphasized the importance of
finding a long-term solution to the Gub
Sports funding problem that would not
require use of a special fee.
"One of the most important princi
ples held by the GSC is that the only
real solutions to the problems faced by
the student body are those that can be
sustained for the long term," Lee said.
"This is why the GSC pursued stable
funding for Thanksgiving from the
Provost's office and why we worked
with Club Sports and other ASSLI lead
ers to put together a long-term plan to
fill their funding needs."
The ASSU, according to Okonkwo,
served lis the access and advocacy point
for Club Sports, which would have
found it difficult to navigate the Univer
sity system to achieve its goals.
"We were ecstatic when we learned
that Club Sports received the funding,
and we are extremely grateful to the
President's Office for their generosity
and understanding," Okonkwo said.
"The resolution of this issue is a big win
for the ASSU and Club Sports. The un
paralleled success of the project
demonstrates the ability of coalition
building between the ASSU and stu
dent groups and partnership with the
administration to make change at this
University."
Sanford expressed hope that the
Club Sports success will spur additional
collaboration between the ASSU and
student groups.

"We feel that this early success ex
emplifies the amazing potential for fu
ture collaboration between student
leaders, the ASSU and the University
administration," Sanford said. "The
ASSU Is committed to working with
many more groups and individuals this
year to ensure that all students have a
valuable and memorable Stanford ex
perience."
Okonkwo also emphasized that stu
dents that participate in Gub Sports
will now be able to participate with
more equal opportunity than ever be
fore because of the support for financial
aid.
Lee said that "in the short term, stu
dents participating in Gub Sports will
have the financial resources to train and
compete, and in the long term, students
will see their student activities fee go
down because Gub Sports will not be
part of the fee."
Sanford noted that a wide variety of
Stanford students will benefit from the
Club Sports funding initiative.
"We specifically targeted funding
for the financial aid program to pro
mote student participation in Club
Sports and hope that more students
will take advantage of this outstanding
program," Sanford said. "From bad
minton and ice hockey to rugby and ul
timate Frisbee and everything in be
tween, Club Sports will continue to en
sure that non-varsity athletes at Stan
ford have the opportunity to pursue
their athletic passions."
