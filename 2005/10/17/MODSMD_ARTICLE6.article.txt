### LI TAO STAFF WRITER 
lecturer Hisham Mahmoud, a doctoral candidate
of Islamic Studies at UCLA, spoke last Saturday af
ternoon about the role of Jesus in Islam to an audi
ence of approximately 50 Stanford students and
members of the surrounding community.
The event, titled "Jesus in Islam: The Gospel of
Jesus According to Prophet Muhammad," was spon
sored by the Islamic Society of Stanford University
and the Muslim Students Awareness Network.
Stanford junior Shelley Cheung, one of the coordi
nators, explained that the event was intended to high
light the similarities between Islam and other faiths
and show students how much they have in common.
Beginning his lecture with a prayer of Moses, Mah
moud emphasized this similarity throughout his talk.
Both Muslims and Christians "believe in Jesus as
the Messiah and accept that he was born of a virgin,
that he never sinned," he said."There is more in com
mon than there are differences between us."
Mahmoud also spoke about an early event in the

history of Islam, when a group of Muslims pursued by
enemies sought refuge with a Christian Ethiopian
king. After hearing an account in the Quran about the
birth of Jesus, the king drew a line in the sand and said
"the difference between you and me is no thicker
than this line" and proceeded to guarantee protection
to the Muslims.
"Such was the first interfaith dialogue between
Islam and Christianity," Mahmoud said.
Jesus' teachings are revered in Islam as the "word
of God," and are quoted by the Prophet Mohammed
in various books, Mahmoud added.
"The Muslims of old used to advise each other by
the statements of Jesus' teachings," he said.
Mahmoud explained that several of Jesus' sayings
present themes common to both religions â€”
"Blessed is he who sees with his heart, but his heart is
not the one he sees; forgive those who will not forgive
you. visit the sick who will not visit you, lend money to
those who you know will not pay you back; Cross this
bridge [of life] but do not build anything on it."
TTie lecture was followed by a question and answer
session, which partly dealt with differences between

the Christian and Islamic view of Jesus.
One important difference between the two reli
gions was the Christian idea of Jesus being crucified
for the sins of mankind. Mahmoud explained that Is
lamic doctrine states that "each soul bears its own
burden" and "no human can be accountable for the
actions of another."
Another difference Mahmoud explained was the
idea of the Holy Trinity. Although Muslims accept
Jesus as the Messiah, they do not believe Jesus is the
son of God.
"It is not fitting for the majesty of God to have the
same physical needs as a human," he explained. "God
is not a father other than in the metaphorical sense
that he is the father to all of us."
After the event, junior Nasser Khan said that the
material presented was "not too different" from what
he had learned previously, but the speech was clear
and easy to follow, especially for those with no back
ground knowledge on the subject.
For senior Mohammed Subeh. the event awak
ened an interest in the subject.
"It left me wanting to learn more," he said.
