BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) — Iraq's land
mark constitution seemed assured of
passage yesterday after initial results
showed minority Sunni Arabs had fall
en short in an effort to veto it at the
polls. The apparent acceptance was a
major step in the attempt to establish a
democratic government that could
lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
Opponents failed to secure the nec
essary two-thirds "no" vote in any
three of Iraqi's 18 provinces, according
to counts that local officials provided
to The Associated Press. In the crucial
central provinces with mixed ethnic
and religious populations, enough Shi
ites and Kurds voted to stymie the
Sunni bid to reject the constitution.
Iraqi President JalalTalabani issued
a decree setting Dec. 15 for Iraqis to
vote again, this time to elect a new par
liament. If the constitution indeed
passed, the first full-term parliament
since Saddam Hussein's fall in 2003 will

install a new government by Dec. 31. If
the charter has failed, the parliament
will be temporary, tasked with drawing
up a new draft on which to vote.
But the outcome could further di
vide the nation, with many Sunnis fear
ing the new decentralized government
will deprive them of their fair share in
the country's vast oil wealth. Large
numbers of Sunnis voted "no," and
some of their leaders were already re
jecting the apparent result.
While a strong Sunni turnout in Sat
urday's referendum suggested a desire
among many to participate in Iraq's new
political system, there were fears that
anger at being ruled under a constitution
they oppose could push some into sup
porting the Sunni-led insurgency.
"If the constitution was passed, the
attacks will definitely rise against the
occupation forces, and the security sit
uation is going to be worse," said Sheik
Abdul-Salam al-Kubaisi, a prominent
cleric with the influential Sunni Associ
ation of Muslim Scholars, which gov
ernment officials accuse of links to the

insurgency.
In a sign of the relentless danger,
five US. soldiers were killed Saturday
by a bomb in Ramadi, a hotbed of mil
itants west of Baghdad, the military an
nounced. It was the deadliest attack on
US. troops since a Sept. 29 bomb blast
in the same town also killed five sol
diers. A Marine was also killed by a
bomb Saturday in the town of
Saqlawiyah, the military said.
The most recent deaths brought to at
least 1,976 the number of US. service
members who have died since the war
began in 2003, according to an AP count.
President Bush congratulated
Iraqis on the referendum, which across
the country saw few attacks and no
deaths of voters in violence.
"The vote today in Iraq is in stark
contrast to the attitude, the philosophy
and strategy of al-Qaida, their terrorist
friends and killers," Bush said.
The constitution is a crucial step in
Iraq's transition to democracy after
two decades of dictatorship under
Saddam.

BEIJING (AP) — Two astronauts on China's
second manned space flight landed before dawn
Monday, shown live on state television as they
emerged from their capsule smiling and waving at
the end of a five-day mission meant to burnish
China's global standing and rouse public support
for its communist leaders. Astronauts Fei Junlong

Shenzhou 6 capsule touched down by parachute
at 4:32 a.m. local time in China's northern grass
lands, just a half-mile from its target, the official
Xinhua News Agency said. They were met by
crews who rushed to the site in helicopters and

Questions over Libby
contacts with Miller camp

WASHINGTON (AP) — New details about Judith Miller's
decision to cooperate in the CIA leak probe are raising
questions about whether Vice President Dick Cheney's
chief of staff and his defense lawyer tried to steer the New
York Times reporter's testimony The dispute arose as the
newspaper yesterday detailed three conversations that
Miller had with the Cheney aide, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby,
in the summer of 2003 about Bush administration critic
Joseph Wilson and Wilson's wife, covert CIA officer Valerie
Plame.
The issue over the contacts between Miller, Libby and
their representatives has arisen even though Libby's lawyer
insists his client granted an unconditional waiver of confi
dentiality more than a year ago for the reporter to testify.

Pakistan ups quake death
toll to 54,000 and above

BALAKOT. Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani officials pre
dicted yesterday that many more thousands of dead
would be found in earthquake-ravaged Kashmir as
heavy rains in the Himalayan region drenched homeless
survivors in mud and misery.
The latest estimate would raise the death toll from
the magnitude-7.6 quake in the mountains of northern
Pakistan and India to at least 54,000, a jump of more
than 13,000 from the official count of known dead.
A spokesman for the prime minister of the region
warned that the cold and wet could cause further deaths
among the 2 million or so people believed to be home
less, although the rains receded early Monday, bringing
hope that efforts could resumeto bring aid to the region.

Iraqi soldiers carry ballot boxes before shipping them for vote counting

ballots from Iraq's constitutional referendum on Sunday as U.S. Secre
tary of State Condoleezza Rice said the draft was probably approved

BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) — Iraq's land
mark constitution seemed assured of
passage yesterday after initial results
showed minority Sunni Arabs had fall
en short in an effort to veto it at the
polls. The apparent acceptance was a
major step in the attempt to establish a
democratic government that could
lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
Opponents failed to secure the nec
essary two-thirds "no" vote in any
three of Iraqi's 18 provinces, according
to counts that local officials provided
to The Associated Press. In the crucial
central provinces with mixed ethnic
and religious populations, enough Shi
ites and Kurds voted to stymie the
Sunni bid to reject the constitution.
Iraqi President JalalTalabani issued
a decree setting Dec. 15 for Iraqis to
vote again, this time to elect a new par
liament. If the constitution indeed
passed, the first full-term parliament
since Saddam Hussein's fall in 2003 will

install a new government by Dec. 31. If
the charter has failed, the parliament
will be temporary, tasked with drawing
up a new draft on which to vote.
But the outcome could further di
vide the nation, with many Sunnis fear
ing the new decentralized government
will deprive them of their fair share in
the country's vast oil wealth. Large
numbers of Sunnis voted "no," and
some of their leaders were already re
jecting the apparent result.
While a strong Sunni turnout in Sat
urday's referendum suggested a desire
among many to participate in Iraq's new
political system, there were fears that
anger at being ruled under a constitution
they oppose could push some into sup
porting the Sunni-led insurgency.
"If the constitution was passed, the
attacks will definitely rise against the
occupation forces, and the security sit
uation is going to be worse," said Sheik
Abdul-Salam al-Kubaisi, a prominent
cleric with the influential Sunni Associ
ation of Muslim Scholars, which gov
ernment officials accuse of links to the

insurgency.
In a sign of the relentless danger,
five US. soldiers were killed Saturday
by a bomb in Ramadi, a hotbed of mil
itants west of Baghdad, the military an
nounced. It was the deadliest attack on
US. troops since a Sept. 29 bomb blast
in the same town also killed five sol
diers. A Marine was also killed by a
bomb Saturday in the town of
Saqlawiyah, the military said.
The most recent deaths brought to at
least 1,976 the number of US. service
members who have died since the war
began in 2003, according to an AP count.
President Bush congratulated
Iraqis on the referendum, which across
the country saw few attacks and no
deaths of voters in violence.
"The vote today in Iraq is in stark
contrast to the attitude, the philosophy
and strategy of al-Qaida, their terrorist
friends and killers," Bush said.
The constitution is a crucial step in
Iraq's transition to democracy after
two decades of dictatorship under
Saddam.

Monday, shown live on state television as they
emerged from their capsule smiling and waving at

Questions over Libby
contacts with Miller camp

WASHINGTON (AP) — New details about Judith Miller's
decision to cooperate in the CIA leak probe are raising
questions about whether Vice President Dick Cheney's
chief of staff and his defense lawyer tried to steer the New
York Times reporter's testimony The dispute arose as the
newspaper yesterday detailed three conversations that
Miller had with the Cheney aide, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby,
in the summer of 2003 about Bush administration critic
Joseph Wilson and Wilson's wife, covert CIA officer Valerie
Plame.
The issue over the contacts between Miller, Libby and
their representatives has arisen even though Libby's lawyer
insists his client granted an unconditional waiver of confi
