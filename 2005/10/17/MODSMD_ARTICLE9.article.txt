## I Cardinal Recruited Your Mom Last Night 
### 
There's really no delicate way to say
this: the Fall Career Fair gave me
terrible diarrhea (just kidding —
everyone knows that girls don't have
such bodily functions). There I was, walk
ing through Braun archway on my way to
class, when all of a sudden I see White
Plaza swarming with eager students and
power-tripping recruiters like ants infest
ing an animal carcass.
I should have known it was coming: I
receive updates from the Career Devel
opment Center with the same frequency
I receive emails with the subject line,
"GIT YOU'RE FREE PENIS EN
LARGER!!!" — about every seven sec
onds. But nothing can prepare you for
that feeling of inadequacy as you watch
your classmates push the limits of "busi
ness casual," desperately trying to woo
the lackeys of Prestigious Organization
X.
Nothing, that is, except maybe fre
quenting frat parties all weekend.
They have a lot of things in common,
career fairs and frat parties. Both events
involve lots of people in fairly close quar
ters. Everyone there is dressed to impress
and prepared to sell themselves (figura
tively) over the course of a brief interac
tion. But in my mind, the most interesting
similarity is the overwhelming sense of
groupthink, the pervasive sentiment that
"this is what we're supposed to be doing
— if you're not part of this, you're not
part of us."
And what reason do you have to opt
out of the collective? The Career Fair is a
great way to find a high-paying job in fi
nance., which might as well be Buying,
Selling and Eating Orphaned Babies for
all most of us actually know about the in
dustry. And frat parties can be fun, as
suming you are drunk enough to forget
that the teeming masses are emitting an
odor strong enough to knock the wind
out of a moose.
There's nothing inherently wrong with
either event. Which is why I was surprised
at the amount of guilt I felt when I admit
ted to myself that I don't particularly like
either of them.
Acknowledging that you don't like ca
reer fairs isn't really that big of a deal. It's
like announcing that you don't like Hel
vetica font — unless you're talking to
someone who just LOVES Helvetica —
I mean really gets off on Helvetica —
people probably won't judge you explic
itly or otherwise.
But admitting that you're not a huge
fan of the frat scene is kind of an issue, es
pecially if you're a member of the Greek
community. I mean, how else are you
going to meet cute boys? And what are
you going to do on a Friday night when all
of your friends are at Sigma Epsilon Chi?
I can't really answer either of those
questions, but I can say that the way frat
parties are structured does not allow me
to interact with the opposite sex respect
fully, and occasionally that weirds me out.
Let's be honest —on that dance floor
you're a piece of meat, I'm a piece of
meat, we're all little meat pieces doing a
sweaty meat-jig. And that's cool if that's
what you want, and sometimes that scene
sounds pretty hot.
But sometimes that doesn't appeal to me
at all. A few years down the line, I don't
want my children to ask how Mommy
and Daddy met, and I have to say "Well,
Johnny ... Mommy was coked out of her
mind when Daddy danced up against her
with his no-no private parts. Mommy
doesn't remember what happened after
that, but nine months later you came
along!"
For me, one of the most pivotal as
pects of my college career has been real
izing that there may be a difference be
tween what I think I should be doing and
what I actually want to do. I don't want to
go into investment banking; I want to be
a writer. I don't want to feel like occasion
ally blowing off a frat party for a more in
timate soiree will make me less cool. I
want acceptance. I want respect. I want
men who will softly kiss my neck and
laugh at my obscenely dumb jokes.
And I don't want to feel particularly
bad about burning down the career fair
either.
