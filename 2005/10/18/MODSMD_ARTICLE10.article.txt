# WATCH WHILE YOU ROCK
## THE 						UMPTEETH GENERATION OF IPOD 
### JAMES CHAN 
Just when everyone thought it couldn't get any better
than the iPod nano, Steve Jobs and his team at Apple pull
yet another rabbit out of their hat — another updated ver
sion of the original iPod.
But apart from sharing a similar coat of white, one will
be hard-pressed to pass off the new iPod as the usual magi
cian's rabbit.
Unveiled Oct. 12 at the California Theater in San Jose,
Calif., in front of an exclusive invite-only crowd, the new
iPod was just one show-stopper in Steve Jobs' three-part
act.The CEO of Apple also ushered in the new iMac G5 and
iTlines 6.
Similar to the iPod nano, the new iPod will be available
in white and black. Improvements to Apple's flagship prod
uct include extra features such as a world clock, stopwatch
and screen lock, larger storage capacities and longer battery
life. The new 30-gigabyte iPod is 30 percent slimmer than
the 20-gigabyte iPod it replaces, while the 60-gigabyte iPod
is 10 percent thinner.
"It's really very beautiful and very thin," Jobs said at the
highly anticipated news conference.
Perhaps the most significant update to the new iPod is its
ability to play H. 264 and MPEG-4 videos. Users can load
their encoded or purchased videos into the new iPod using

iHmes 6.0 and play them back on the iPod's 2.5-inch LCD or
a television set using the iPod's now-familiar nested menus.
To ensure that the video-playing appetites of iPod-toting
consumers will be indulged, Apple announced a deal with
ABC Television Group to sell episodes of hit shows "Des
perate I lousewives" and "Lost" through illmes, along with
short films from Pixar Animation Studios and about 2,(XX)
music videos for $ 1.99 apiece.
While few discount Jobs' shrewdness in deciding to in
corporate video playback capability into Apple's hugely
popular iPod, some were quick to question the limited se
lection of videos available on the iTtines store compared to
the wide range of music offered on iTunes upon the iPod's
initial launch. Nevertheless, Apple's shareholders can
heave a sigh of relief as the corporation enters uncharted
waters, considering that the iPod commands 75 percent of
the market share of all MP3 players.
"The new iPod is the best music player ever — it's 30
percent thinner and has 50 percent more storage than its
predecessor — yet it sells for the same price and plays stun
ning videos on its 2.5-inch color screen," Jobs said." Because
millions of people around the world will buy this new iPod
to play music, it will quickly become the most popular
portable video player in history."
Despite Jobs' proclamation, management science and
engineering graduate student Sean Wat — who does not

own an MP3 player — says he expects to sit out of the lat
est iPod revolution. Admittedly more smitten by the iPod
nano, Wat says he does not see any need for portable videos,
at least for the time being.
"You're out there and all these awesome products start
popping out," Wat says. "You're wondering maybe if you
wait fora bit, the next better thing might come along."
Sophomore Jose Benchimol, who owns a third-genera
tion 40-gigabyte iPod, shares similar sentiments.
"My main utility from the iPod is music and not video,"
Benchimol says. "While the improvements to the new iPod
are great, there is just not a sufficiently compelling case for
me to switch to the new iPod. The iPod that I have plays
music as well as the new iPod does."
Despite these concerns, many believe that Apple has
once again released an iPod worthy of its top-selling name.
And in what can be seen as a lesson learnt from the iPod
nano, Steve Jobs revealed to the amused conference crowd,
"they also come with a nice carrying case, [to] keep them all
perfect."
At least consumers can now buy with one less worry on
their minds.
Two new iPods, a wireless remote control and the new
iMac G5 in under a month — have we seen the last rabbit
come out of Steve Jobs' hat for now? Your guess is as good
as mine.

at least for the time being.
"You're out there and all these awesome products start
popping out," Wat says. "You're wondering maybe if you
wait fora bit, the next better thing might come along."
Sophomore Jose Benchimol, who owns a third-genera
tion 40-gigabyte iPod, shares similar sentiments.
"My main utility from the iPod is music and not video,"
Benchimol says. "While the improvements to the new iPod
are great, there is just not a sufficiently compelling case for
me to switch to the new iPod. The iPod that I have plays
music as well as the new iPod does."
Despite these concerns, many believe that Apple has
once again released an iPod worthy of its top-selling name.
And in what can be seen as a lesson learnt from the iPod
nano, Steve Jobs revealed to the amused conference crowd,
"they also come with a nice carrying case, [to] keep them all
perfect."
At least consumers can now buy with one less worry on
their minds.
Two new iPods, a wireless remote control and the new
iMac G5 in under a month — have we seen the last rabbit
come out of Steve Jobs' hat for now? Your guess is as good
as mine.

Just when everyone thought it couldn't get any better
than the iPod nano, Steve Jobs and his team at Apple pull
yet another rabbit out of their hat — another updated ver
sion of the original iPod.
But apart from sharing a similar coat of white, one will
be hard-pressed to pass off the new iPod as the usual magi
cian's rabbit.
Unveiled Oct. 12 at the California Theater in San Jose,
Calif., in front of an exclusive invite-only crowd, the new
iPod was just one show-stopper in Steve Jobs' three-part
act.The CEO of Apple also ushered in the new iMac G5 and
iTlines 6.
Similar to the iPod nano, the new iPod will be available
in white and black. Improvements to Apple's flagship prod
uct include extra features such as a world clock, stopwatch
and screen lock, larger storage capacities and longer battery
life. The new 30-gigabyte iPod is 30 percent slimmer than
the 20-gigabyte iPod it replaces, while the 60-gigabyte iPod
is 10 percent thinner.
"It's really very beautiful and very thin," Jobs said at the
highly anticipated news conference.
Perhaps the most significant update to the new iPod is its
ability to play H. 264 and MPEG-4 videos. Users can load
their encoded or purchased videos into the new iPod using

iHmes 6.0 and play them back on the iPod's 2.5-inch LCD or
a television set using the iPod's now-familiar nested menus.
To ensure that the video-playing appetites of iPod-toting
consumers will be indulged, Apple announced a deal with
ABC Television Group to sell episodes of hit shows "Des
perate I lousewives" and "Lost" through illmes, along with
short films from Pixar Animation Studios and about 2,(XX)
music videos for $ 1.99 apiece.
While few discount Jobs' shrewdness in deciding to in
corporate video playback capability into Apple's hugely
popular iPod, some were quick to question the limited se
lection of videos available on the iTtines store compared to
the wide range of music offered on iTunes upon the iPod's
initial launch. Nevertheless, Apple's shareholders can
heave a sigh of relief as the corporation enters uncharted
waters, considering that the iPod commands 75 percent of
the market share of all MP3 players.
"The new iPod is the best music player ever — it's 30
percent thinner and has 50 percent more storage than its
predecessor — yet it sells for the same price and plays stun
ning videos on its 2.5-inch color screen," Jobs said." Because
millions of people around the world will buy this new iPod
to play music, it will quickly become the most popular
portable video player in history."
Despite Jobs' proclamation, management science and
engineering graduate student Sean Wat — who does not

own an MP3 player — says he expects to sit out of the lat
est iPod revolution. Admittedly more smitten by the iPod
nano, Wat says he does not see any need for portable videos,
at least for the time being.
"You're out there and all these awesome products start
popping out," Wat says. "You're wondering maybe if you
wait fora bit, the next better thing might come along."

tion 40-gigabyte iPod, shares similar sentiments.
