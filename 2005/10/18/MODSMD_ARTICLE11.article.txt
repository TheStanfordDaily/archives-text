# Spam pushes 'Manifest Destiny' to new frontier
## 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
And you thought hearing the uncannily
cheerful proclamation, "You've got mail!"
warble through your computer speakers
was annoying.
Across the United States, we might as
well switch out the infernal America Online
siren song and treat ourselves instead to the
likes of "You've got spam." As of Oct. 12,
Sophos, an enterprise security software
company, has pegged the United States as
the top spam offender in the world fora sec
ond consecutive year.
The United States is to blame for 26.5
percent of all the spam detected by Sophos
from April to September 2(X)5. Sophos, a
privately-owned enterprise based near Ox
ford, UK, set up spam filters in its extensive
network to determine the top 12 interna
tional offenders.
In an identical study conducted in 2(M)4,
Sophos found the United States responsible
fora whopping 41.5 percent of unsolicited
bulk e-mail (ÜBE) — what everyday users
term spam.
Senior technology consultant for Sophos
Graham Cluley explains to the up-and
coming tech magazine. Red Herring, steps
the United States has taken to reduce its
overwhelming amount of spam.
"Efforts such as ISPs [Internet service
providers] sharing knowledge on how to
crack down on spammers and authorities
enforcing CAN-SPAM legislation have
helped North America thwart the efforts of
spammers on their doorsteps," Cluley told
Red Herring. "Some of the most prolific
sparrfmers have been forced to either quit
their business or relocate overseas as a re
sult "
Enacted in 2(X)3, the Controlling the As
sault of Non-Solicited Pornography and
Marketing Act — CAN-SPAM for short —
asserts that spam offenders can face up to
five years in prison and up to 20 years in the
slammer under traditional United States
mail fraud laws.
In the face of tougher legislation, spam
perpetrators have cropped up in nations such
as South Korea and Pakistan. Since last year's
Sophos survey. South Korea has nearly dou

bled its spam production, ratcheting up to
19.73 percent from a more palatable 11.63.
Pakistan, newcomer to the 2005 "Dirty
Dozen," is responsible for 1.42 percent of
the world's ÜBE.
While Japan, Canada and Brazil have
slimmed their spam margins, the seven re
maining top-12 offenders have increased
their unwanted output to fill in the United
States' noticeable deficit.
Granted, fewer spam messages across
the globe arc waving stars and stripes next
to their misspelled promises of prescription
drugs, bootleg software and weight loss
ointments. But taking into account the re
doubled efforts of South Korea and China
— China jumped from 8.9 to 15.97 percent
— the overall burden on e-mail users has
mostly remained static.
Cluley also told Red Herring that C'AN
SPAM misses some key points in eradicat
ing spam. While CAN-SPAM targets direct

senders of spam, it glosses over spammers
who team up with virus writers and hackers
to send spam from unwitting, unprotected
computers.
"By taking control of unprotected PCs,
hackers can relay spam, launch denial-of
scrvice attacks or steal user information
without computer owners being any the
wiser." Cluley says.
So what does the big bad ÜBE wolf have
in store Stanford? The University's Infor
mation and Technology Systems and Ser
vices (ITSS) group acknowledges that Stan
ford, like the rest of the world, has seen a
marked increase in spam since 2001.
Consequently, ITSS offers some com
mon-sense pointers to the Stanford popu
lace. including warnings not to reply to
spam or spread chain letters (come on guys,
you know that's only for Facebook walls).
F 7 riendly ITSS neighbor, the Leland Sys
tems Group, has assembled a three-pronged

weapon to send ÜBE down the tube. Its
multi-faceted tool is available at
http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/an
tispam and enables users to configure a
spam filter that marks suspect messages
with a varying number of pound signs in the
subject lines.
Stanford users can then set a threshold
level for trashing spam with the "Spam
Deletion Tool."
Though ITSS promises these anti-spam
results will rid your computer of approxi
mately 40 to 60 percent of all spam, many
students report that the amount of spam
clogging their inboxes is greater than ever.
"[During freshman year] 1 never used to
get spam," says Nina Qi. a senior. "Now I get
a lot of ads for Viagra."
Qi. who is majoring in economics, admits
that she has never heard of Stanford's anti
spam tools. She also worries that some of
the spam running rampant on campus is be
coming increasingly menacing.
"I have to say. spam nowadays can be
sort of convincing." Qi says. "Like the ones
from Ebay in which the e-mail address list
ed is support@ebay.com. It would have had
me fooled except I never use my Stanford e
mail address [outside of Stanford]."
Mark Kilgore, a senior majoring in com
puter science, notes that Stanford's [SPAM:
#] tags have helped his cause, but that he re
lies on outside clients to finish the job.
"I get about 20 to 30 pieces of spam a
day," Kilgore says."l use Mozilla's Thunder
bird e-mail client, which has built in junk fil
ters."
Senior Da Pan laments that her set of fil
ters can also screen out important e-mails.
"A lot of my legit mail gets sorted as
spam and I can't afford to delete, say, a
profs e-mail," Pan says.
Other Cardinal affiliates have aban
doned Stanford altogether in their quest to
stop spam.
Chris Khamphoune, who graduated last
year and currently conducts research at Cen
ter for Ginical Sciences Research, swears by
Google's massive-storage client, Gmail.
"I just forward my Stanford e-mail to my
Gmail account," khamphoune says."I
haven't dealt with Stanford servers in a long
time."
