## Editorial New download service is music to our ears 
### 
Starting today, Yahoo! will be offering a
music download service to Stanford
students. And like some of the best
things in life, this music service is completely
free. During the course of a one-year pilot
program, the service will be offered at no
cost to Stanford students, courtesy of an
anonymous donor.
Music lovers all over campus have reason
to rejoice over this new program, although
some may rejoice more than others. For one,
music downloaded from Yahoo! cannot be
uploaded to iPods. Consequently, iPod users
can only listen to downloaded music from
their computers.
To make matters worse, music from
Yahoo's subscription service is incompatible
with Macintosh operating systems. This
means that about 20 percent of the student
population will not be able to download
music through this free service. To be fair, al
ternatives to Yahoo's services, such as Nap
ster and Rhapsody, also have compatibility
issues with Macs, and no subscription service
exists that works with the iPod. Additionally,
it is disingenuous of us to complain about a
free gift, albeit one that only 80 percent of
Stanford students can enjoy.
Granted, the University's motives are not
entirely altruistic. It is not that the adminis
tration is necessarily keen on expanding the
musical tastes of the general Stanford popu
lation; rather, Stanford is ostensibly curbing
the possible legal ramifications of illegal file
sharing, an activity that would proliferate in
the absence of a free, legitimate music down
loading service.
Subscribing to Yahoo's services also
means that the University can control, and
possibly even reduce, the heavy load on ex
isting bandwidth. Music downloads will
mainly be routed through one channel
which the University can monitor more ef

fectively.
As such, we are thoroughly impressed by
the collective efforts of representatives from
the ASSU, Residential Computing, the Of
fice of the Dean of Students, ITSS, the Office
of the General Counsel, the Office of the
Vice Presidents for Business Affairs and
other organizations. By carefully balancing
student welfare and business interests, they
have set the example for similar cooperative
initiatives in the future.
For now, neither the University nor indi
vidual students are paying for this service.
This means that students who choose not to
use this service will not be subsidizing those
who do. But this may change once the trial
period ends next September. While the
music download service is free this year,stu
dents will probably have to pay to renew
their subscriptions in subsequent years.
This opens the question of how the pro
gram will continue to be funded in future
years. One solution would be to package the
subscription fee into tuition or room
charges, like the telecommunications fee.
However, such an option would be indulgent
and difficult to justify. Students could pay for
an opt-in service, although few would pay for
a legal music downloading service when ille
gal alternatives abound.
We believe that the music downloading
service offers an excellent test case for open
dialogue between students and the Universi
ty administration. It is a non-divisive issue
that does not involve race, religion or politics,
but one that would thrive on a wealth of stu
dent input. The University administration
should seize this opportunity to practice talk
ing with and listening to the student commu
nity at large.The administration should make
this a public issue, publish the results from
user satisfaction surveys and possibly consid
er putting it on the spring ballot.
