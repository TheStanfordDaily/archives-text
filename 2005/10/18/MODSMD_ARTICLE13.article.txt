# So, staff
## 
### 
I should have written a piece
about Full Moon on the Quad
for this Tuesday. But I didn't. If
you've been following my column,
you'll have read my best Full Moon
story, and my theories on why Stan
ford students are unable to have
meaningful relationships. Where a
Full Moon column would go is too
predictable.

However, as a senior, I will have hopefully kissed
many freshmen last night — preferably kissed them with
tongue. Freshmen are something I know a great deal
about, due to an engagement as the RCC in Rinconada
last year. What follows are my recollections and advice
(in which I mention Full Moon on the Quad only once),
based on a very, very blurry year:
So, you've decided you want to staff in a freshman
dorm? You just loved your frosh staff and thought that
they helped craft the best year of your life, and you'd be
honored to be a part of a house that has the same kind of
environment? Very good, you've practiced the speech,
RFs will love you.
First, consider why you are actually signing up to be a
freshman staffer. Is it because you'd really, really like a
single? Acceptable. Is it because you have a porcupine
complex or were in a demoralizing codependent relation
ship that shut you off from all your other friends, and as a
result have no one to draw with? Excellent, you're hired!
Is it because you regret how you spent your freshman
year and are going to creepily and vicariously relive it by
molding freshmen in your own image? Perfect! Is it be
cause you can't imagine getting laid except by being in a
position of authority over barely-legal teenagers? Well,
just don't tell anyone.
You have a number of possible choices. Being an RA
is a drag — if a resident dies from alcohol poisoning,
they're responsible. If a water balloon mysteriously sets

off a fire alarm, if a couple of
skanks from Paly High show up
to an unofficial dorm party,
they're responsible. They have
the thankless task of balancing
what to tell the RFs. RFs need to
be told just enough to know
what's going on, but at the same
time need to have a level of plau
sible deniability about the semi-

illegal activities the frosh are participating in. RAs need
to magically divine just how many students in a common
area constitutes a "gathering" that must be regulated —
a number somewhere between three and 50. At least RAs
get paid the most for taking on this liability.
A PHE is just a pre-med nerd who isn't allowed to
drink for an entire year. They get paid such an infinitesi
mal amount that it is not even worth discussing.'lhey give
out condoms to the one kid in the dorm brave enough to
ask and make dangerous, ill-informed decisions about
when kids need to go to the ER.This frightens the hell out
of me, but as an RCC, I appreciated them being there to
take the fall for medical matters.
HPACs are the kids who think that Stanford has
something to do with academics and who believe that red
folders, PMs,OCTs,OVs.and PAAs are all going to make
the Stanford experience a whoop-de-do fun time of
learning and discovery.
RCCs are arguably the most useful staff members
(not that I'm biased),but on the whole know nearly noth
ing about computers. Most people survive their RCC's
criminally small amount of knowledge in the only reason
able way — by calling me. However, a good RCC, regard
less of his or her competency, has the most special job —
the job of being subversive. RCCs have the fewest rules
— don't give the frosh alcohol (they can provide their

own very well, thank you, and the
guidelines say nothing about drink
ing their alcohol, or drinking yours
while they drink theirs) and don't
hook up with them. 1 cannot stress
this enough.
There are other staff positions too.
FroSoCo will continue adding new
staff positions so long as there are res
idents who are too scared by the rest
of Stanford to leave the dorm — last
year they had mo Resident Bike Co
ordinators. Writing liitors will forev
er be holding office hours that no
body shows up to and excusing them
selves from the dorm the night before
IHUM papers are due. Cultural
Awareness Associates will ensure
that "Boys Don't Cry" will be peren
nially checked out of Green, locus
Assistants let the University pretend
that Lantana residents are really ex
cited about community service, giving
quiet Asian economics majors an
easy way to lie to get priority. (ResEd
claims Toyon is the "Sophomore Pri
ority" Focus House — by this logic,
they should probably have an FA
who holds shotgunning workshops).

Any staff member can be subver
sive, and I encourage you all to do it
— it is your job to explain that Full
Moon is a sad, desperate affair for all
men involved, with the exception of
those who will go on to illustrious ca
reers in our Greek system. Tell the
girls, hell, tell the guys too, that frat
parties are dumb and that they
should concentrate on making real
friends with whom they can live
sophomore year. Make all the pre
meds reconsider their chosen career
paths. Suggest that the CS majors
pursue classics degrees. Get all the
closet symbolic systems majors in the
open. Take your residents to EBF
Happy Hours. Openly mock the
other staff members. Explain how to
get As in IHUM without doing the
reading. Download "The OC" for
them. Encourage them to skip class
and go to the beach. Introduce them
to sophomores who will buy them
parking permits, juniors who will
sleep with them and seniors who will
get them illicit alcohol. Lead them on
a steam-tunneling expedition. Pick
sides in internal dorm conflicts and
stick to them vigorously — unless
you find playing both sides to be
more amusing. Tell them all the infi
nitely-better theme ideas that the
Philistines on staff shot down.
As a staffer, people will caution

you not to lose touch with your
friends and not to fall in love with a
freshman.These warnings are nice to
hear but ultimately useless. If you are
committed to the dorm, you will lose
touch with most of your friends (ex
cept for those staffing in other
dorms) and you will forget how to
conduct yourself around grown-ups.
You shouldn't try to combat this by
going MIA in the dorm, because
then your residents will hate you
(unless you actually are M 1.A., the
artist, in which case you should con
tact KZSU or any of the residents of
Kairos to organize a totally awesome
concert that will show Stanford what
a real house party should be like).
You will fall in love with a freshman,
just as you'd fall in love with anyone
you live with fora year — it's just
that, as a frosh staffer, your fellow
residents will idolize you. It's surpris
ingly attractive.Try not to act on this,
though, as it will endanger your job
and, more importantly, your hard
won single.

David Blackmail is still ambivalent
about whether or not staffing in Rinc
was the best year of his life, but he defi
nitely thinks that you should listen to
KZSU more. Also, that you should
date him. Interested? E-mail him at

sides in internal dorm conflicts and
stick to them vigorously — unless
you find playing both sides to be
more amusing. Tell them all the infi

As a staffer, people will caution

you not to lose touch with your
friends and not to fall in love with a
freshman.These warnings are nice to
hear but ultimately useless. If you are
committed to the dorm, you will lose
touch with most of your friends (ex
cept for those staffing in other
dorms) and you will forget how to
conduct yourself around grown-ups.
You shouldn't try to combat this by
going MIA in the dorm, because
then your residents will hate you

tact KZSU or any of the residents of
Kairos to organize a totally awesome
concert that will show Stanford what
a real house party should be like).
You will fall in love with a freshman,
just as you'd fall in love with anyone
you live with fora year — it's just
that, as a frosh staffer, your fellow
residents will idolize you. It's surpris
ingly attractive.Try not to act on this,
though, as it will endanger your job
and, more importantly, your hard
won single.

about whether or not staffing in Rinc

I should have written a piece
about Full Moon on the Quad
for this Tuesday. But I didn't. If
you've been following my column,
you'll have read my best Full Moon
story, and my theories on why Stan
ford students are unable to have
meaningful relationships. Where a
Full Moon column would go is too
predictable.

However, as a senior, I will have hopefully kissed
many freshmen last night — preferably kissed them with
tongue. Freshmen are something I know a great deal
about, due to an engagement as the RCC in Rinconada
last year. What follows are my recollections and advice
(in which I mention Full Moon on the Quad only once),
based on a very, very blurry year:
So, you've decided you want to staff in a freshman
dorm? You just loved your frosh staff and thought that
they helped craft the best year of your life, and you'd be
honored to be a part of a house that has the same kind of
environment? Very good, you've practiced the speech,
RFs will love you.
First, consider why you are actually signing up to be a
freshman staffer. Is it because you'd really, really like a
single? Acceptable. Is it because you have a porcupine
complex or were in a demoralizing codependent relation
ship that shut you off from all your other friends, and as a
result have no one to draw with? Excellent, you're hired!
Is it because you regret how you spent your freshman
year and are going to creepily and vicariously relive it by
molding freshmen in your own image? Perfect! Is it be
cause you can't imagine getting laid except by being in a
position of authority over barely-legal teenagers? Well,
just don't tell anyone.
You have a number of possible choices. Being an RA
is a drag — if a resident dies from alcohol poisoning,
they're responsible. If a water balloon mysteriously sets

off a fire alarm, if a couple of
skanks from Paly High show up
to an unofficial dorm party,
they're responsible. They have
the thankless task of balancing
what to tell the RFs. RFs need to
be told just enough to know
what's going on, but at the same
time need to have a level of plau
sible deniability about the semi-

illegal activities the frosh are participating in. RAs need
to magically divine just how many students in a common
area constitutes a "gathering" that must be regulated —
a number somewhere between three and 50. At least RAs
get paid the most for taking on this liability.

cited about community service, giving
quiet Asian economics majors an
easy way to lie to get priority. (ResEd
claims Toyon is the "Sophomore Pri
ority" Focus House — by this logic,
they should probably have an FA
who holds shotgunning workshops).

Any staff member can be subver
sive, and I encourage you all to do it
— it is your job to explain that Full
Moon is a sad, desperate affair for all
men involved, with the exception of
those who will go on to illustrious ca
reers in our Greek system. Tell the
girls, hell, tell the guys too, that frat
parties are dumb and that they
should concentrate on making real
friends with whom they can live
sophomore year. Make all the pre
meds reconsider their chosen career
paths. Suggest that the CS majors
pursue classics degrees. Get all the
closet symbolic systems majors in the
open. Take your residents to EBF
Happy Hours. Openly mock the
other staff members. Explain how to
get As in IHUM without doing the
reading. Download "The OC" for
them. Encourage them to skip class
and go to the beach. Introduce them
to sophomores who will buy them
parking permits, juniors who will
sleep with them and seniors who will
get them illicit alcohol. Lead them on
a steam-tunneling expedition. Pick
sides in internal dorm conflicts and
stick to them vigorously — unless
you find playing both sides to be
more amusing. Tell them all the infi
nitely-better theme ideas that the
Philistines on staff shot down.
As a staffer, people will caution

you not to lose touch with your
friends and not to fall in love with a
freshman.These warnings are nice to
hear but ultimately useless. If you are
committed to the dorm, you will lose
touch with most of your friends (ex
cept for those staffing in other
dorms) and you will forget how to
conduct yourself around grown-ups.
You shouldn't try to combat this by
going MIA in the dorm, because
then your residents will hate you
(unless you actually are M 1.A., the
artist, in which case you should con
tact KZSU or any of the residents of
Kairos to organize a totally awesome
concert that will show Stanford what
a real house party should be like).
You will fall in love with a freshman,
just as you'd fall in love with anyone
you live with fora year — it's just
that, as a frosh staffer, your fellow
residents will idolize you. It's surpris
ingly attractive.Try not to act on this,
though, as it will endanger your job
and, more importantly, your hard
won single.

David Blackmail is still ambivalent
about whether or not staffing in Rinc
was the best year of his life, but he defi
nitely thinks that you should listen to
KZSU more. Also, that you should
date him. Interested? E-mail him at
