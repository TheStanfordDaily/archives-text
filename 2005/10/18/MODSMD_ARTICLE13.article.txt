# So, staff
## 
### 
I should have written a piece
about Full Moon on the Quad
for this Tuesday. But I didn't. If
you've been following my column,
you'll have read my best Full Moon
story, and my theories on why Stan
ford students are unable to have
meaningful relationships. Where a
Full Moon column would go is too
predictable.

However, as a senior, I will have hopefully kissed
many freshmen last night — preferably kissed them with
tongue. Freshmen are something I know a great deal
about, due to an engagement as the RCC in Rinconada
last year. What follows are my recollections and advice
(in which I mention Full Moon on the Quad only once),
based on a very, very blurry year:
So, you've decided you want to staff in a freshman
dorm? You just loved your frosh staff and thought that
they helped craft the best year of your life, and you'd be
honored to be a part of a house that has the same kind of
environment? Very good, you've practiced the speech,
RFs will love you.
First, consider why you are actually signing up to be a
freshman staffer. Is it because you'd really, really like a
single? Acceptable. Is it because you have a porcupine
complex or were in a demoralizing codependent relation
ship that shut you off from all your other friends, and as a
result have no one to draw with? Excellent, you're hired!
Is it because you regret how you spent your freshman
year and are going to creepily and vicariously relive it by
molding freshmen in your own image? Perfect! Is it be
cause you can't imagine getting laid except by being in a
position of authority over barely-legal teenagers? Well,
just don't tell anyone.
You have a number of possible choices. Being an RA
is a drag — if a resident dies from alcohol poisoning,
they're responsible. If a water balloon mysteriously sets

off a fire alarm, if a couple of
skanks from Paly High show up
to an unofficial dorm party,
they're responsible. They have
the thankless task of balancing
what to tell the RFs. RFs need to
be told just enough to know
what's going on, but at the same
time need to have a level of plau
sible deniability about the semi-

illegal activities the frosh are participating in. RAs need
to magically divine just how many students in a common
area constitutes a "gathering" that must be regulated —
a number somewhere between three and 50. At least RAs
get paid the most for taking on this liability.
A PHE is just a pre-med nerd who isn't allowed to
drink for an entire year. They get paid such an infinitesi
mal amount that it is not even worth discussing.'lhey give
out condoms to the one kid in the dorm brave enough to
ask and make dangerous, ill-informed decisions about
when kids need to go to the ER.This frightens the hell out
of me, but as an RCC, I appreciated them being there to
take the fall for medical matters.
HPACs are the kids who think that Stanford has
something to do with academics and who believe that red
folders, PMs,OCTs,OVs.and PAAs are all going to make
the Stanford experience a whoop-de-do fun time of
learning and discovery.
RCCs are arguably the most useful staff members
(not that I'm biased),but on the whole know nearly noth
ing about computers. Most people survive their RCC's
criminally small amount of knowledge in the only reason
able way — by calling me. However, a good RCC, regard
less of his or her competency, has the most special job —
the job of being subversive. RCCs have the fewest rules
— don't give the frosh alcohol (they can provide their
