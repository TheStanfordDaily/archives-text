## Waiting for justice in Haiti 
### SASHA KRAMER 
On Jan. 29,2005. Father Gerard Jean Juste
spoke to a crowded room at Stanford. Now
he sits behind bars with five other inmates,
entering his 90th day as an Amnesty Interna
tional prisoner of conscience in the Pacot
Penitentiary in Port au Prince, Haiti.
Juste, a beloved Catholic priest in Port au
Prince and a close friend of exiled Haitian
President Jean Bertrand Aristide, was arrest
ed on July 21 after being assaulted by a mob
at the funeral of well known journalist
Jaques Roche. After being removed from the
church and taken to the police station "for
his own safety," Juste was placed behind bars
and later accused of killing Roche, a baseless
accusation given that the priest was in Miami
at the time the journalist was murdered.
For those who know Juste, it is not the
alibi that proves his innocence; it is his char
acter. For decades. Juste has struggled along

side the Haitian poor in the tradition of liber
ation theology. In addition to empowering
thousands of parishioners with his sermons.
Juste puts his words into action. His parish of
St. Claire hosts numerous community pro
grams, from a feeding program that provides
four meals per week to 1.000 children, to a
vocational summer camp. Juste is one of
Haiti's most outspoken advocates for nonvi

human rights advocates and religious leaders
across the world.
TXventy months after the overthrow of
Haiti's democratically-elected government
in February 2004, thousands of community
organizers remain in hiding and in exile, po
lice violence and impunity are rampant in
poor neighborhoods in Port au Prince, social
programs have been dismantled, the price of
basic goods has skyrocketed and the prisons
are overflowing with Aristide supporters.
Last Tuesday, the unclcctcd interim gov

ernment announced that the upcoming pres
idential elections, scheduled for Nov. 20, will
be postponed for at least one month. Only
623 sites to register voters have been estab
lished throughout the country â€” contrast
this to the 11,238 polling stations in Haiti
during the elections in 2(XX). The base of the
nation's largest political party. Lavalas, is
threatening to boycott the elections if the
current climate of repression persists.
In this atmosphere of political persecu
tion and electoral chaos, Condoleezza Rice
made a surprise visit to Haiti on Sept. 27. her
first trip there since becoming secretary of
state. She stated repeatedly that "the most
important issue here is that the elections be
free and fair and inclusive."
Meanwhile, just miles from the heavily
fortified National Palace where Rice passed
most of her several hours in Haiti, Juste,
