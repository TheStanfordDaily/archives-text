## Waiting for justice in Haiti 
### SASHA KRAMER 
On Jan. 29,2005. Father Gerard Jean Juste
spoke to a crowded room at Stanford. Now
he sits behind bars with five other inmates,
entering his 90th day as an Amnesty Interna
tional prisoner of conscience in the Pacot
Penitentiary in Port au Prince, Haiti.
Juste, a beloved Catholic priest in Port au
Prince and a close friend of exiled Haitian
President Jean Bertrand Aristide, was arrest
ed on July 21 after being assaulted by a mob
at the funeral of well known journalist
Jaques Roche. After being removed from the
church and taken to the police station "for
his own safety," Juste was placed behind bars
and later accused of killing Roche, a baseless
accusation given that the priest was in Miami
at the time the journalist was murdered.
For those who know Juste, it is not the
alibi that proves his innocence; it is his char
acter. For decades. Juste has struggled along

side the Haitian poor in the tradition of liber
ation theology. In addition to empowering
thousands of parishioners with his sermons.
Juste puts his words into action. His parish of
St. Claire hosts numerous community pro
grams, from a feeding program that provides
four meals per week to 1.000 children, to a
vocational summer camp. Juste is one of
Haiti's most outspoken advocates for nonvi
olent resistance and his arrest has alarmed
human rights advocates and religious leaders
across the world.
TXventy months after the overthrow of
Haiti's democratically-elected government
in February 2004, thousands of community
organizers remain in hiding and in exile, po
lice violence and impunity are rampant in
poor neighborhoods in Port au Prince, social
programs have been dismantled, the price of
basic goods has skyrocketed and the prisons
are overflowing with Aristide supporters.
Last Tuesday, the unclcctcd interim gov

ernment announced that the upcoming pres
idential elections, scheduled for Nov. 20, will
be postponed for at least one month. Only
623 sites to register voters have been estab
lished throughout the country — contrast
this to the 11,238 polling stations in Haiti
during the elections in 2(XX). The base of the
nation's largest political party. Lavalas, is
threatening to boycott the elections if the
current climate of repression persists.
In this atmosphere of political persecu
tion and electoral chaos, Condoleezza Rice
made a surprise visit to Haiti on Sept. 27. her
first trip there since becoming secretary of
state. She stated repeatedly that "the most
important issue here is that the elections be
free and fair and inclusive."
Meanwhile, just miles from the heavily
fortified National Palace where Rice passed
most of her several hours in Haiti, Juste,
Yvon Neptune, Annette Auguste (So
Anne) and dozens of other political
prisoners and potential candidates
continue to sit behind bars, unable to
participate in the upcoming elections.
Last week — in yet another blow
to Haiti's constitution — the Haitian
Supreme Court ruled that Dumersais
Simeus, a Haitian-born Texas busi
nessman with close ties to the Bush
administration, is eligible to run for
president.This is in flagrant violation
of the country's constitution, which
states that all candidates for political
office must hold Haitian citizenship
and have lived in the country for at
least the past five years. Simeus has
lived in Texas for the past 25 years
and holds an American passport;
1 iaiti does not recognize dual citizen
ship.
1 low is it that a Texas businessman

is permitted to run for president of
Haiti, when the legitimate president.
Aristide, is in exile in South Africa
and Juste and other potential candi
dates are behind bars? Why are regis
tration numbers so low, with only 2.5
of 4.5 million eligible voters regis
tered as of mid-October? Why do
tens of thousands of people continue
to take to the streets calling for the re
turn of their elected president? How
can these elections possibly be con
sidered "free and fair and inclusive"?
To learn more about the U.S. role
in Haiti's coup — from financing op
position groups to forcibly removing
the elected president from the coun
try — come see the new documen
tary "Aristide and the Endless Revo
lution," premiering tomorrow at the
United Nations Association Film Fes
tival, held at Stanford. The film
screening is at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. Also, in November,
Brian Concannon and Mario Joseph,
two lawyers representing many of
Haiti's political prisoners, including
Juste, will be speaking at Stanford

about the current human rights crisis.
In a letter from prison addressed
to "Brothers and sisters around the
world." Juste sends a message of
hope: "I now have discovered so
much support for the I laitian people
and me from people all over the
world. 1 am in awe. I add my strength
to those who stand for the rights of
everyone, whatever color, whatever
creed, whatever nationality. Our spir
its are uplifted when we hear about
your work for I laiti. because we hear
hope coming." Our presence at these
events will nourish this hope: I en
courage people to attend.

On Jan. 29,2005. Father Gerard Jean Juste
spoke to a crowded room at Stanford. Now
he sits behind bars with five other inmates,
entering his 90th day as an Amnesty Interna
tional prisoner of conscience in the Pacot
Penitentiary in Port au Prince, Haiti.
Juste, a beloved Catholic priest in Port au
Prince and a close friend of exiled Haitian
President Jean Bertrand Aristide, was arrest
ed on July 21 after being assaulted by a mob
at the funeral of well known journalist
Jaques Roche. After being removed from the
church and taken to the police station "for
his own safety," Juste was placed behind bars
and later accused of killing Roche, a baseless
accusation given that the priest was in Miami
at the time the journalist was murdered.
For those who know Juste, it is not the
alibi that proves his innocence; it is his char
acter. For decades. Juste has struggled along

side the Haitian poor in the tradition of liber
ation theology. In addition to empowering
thousands of parishioners with his sermons.
Juste puts his words into action. His parish of
St. Claire hosts numerous community pro
grams, from a feeding program that provides
four meals per week to 1.000 children, to a
vocational summer camp. Juste is one of
Haiti's most outspoken advocates for nonvi
olent resistance and his arrest has alarmed
human rights advocates and religious leaders
across the world.
TXventy months after the overthrow of
Haiti's democratically-elected government
in February 2004, thousands of community
organizers remain in hiding and in exile, po
lice violence and impunity are rampant in
poor neighborhoods in Port au Prince, social
programs have been dismantled, the price of
basic goods has skyrocketed and the prisons
are overflowing with Aristide supporters.
Last Tuesday, the unclcctcd interim gov

ernment announced that the upcoming pres
idential elections, scheduled for Nov. 20, will
be postponed for at least one month. Only
623 sites to register voters have been estab
lished throughout the country — contrast
this to the 11,238 polling stations in Haiti
during the elections in 2(XX). The base of the
nation's largest political party. Lavalas, is
threatening to boycott the elections if the
current climate of repression persists.
In this atmosphere of political persecu
tion and electoral chaos, Condoleezza Rice
made a surprise visit to Haiti on Sept. 27. her
first trip there since becoming secretary of
state. She stated repeatedly that "the most
important issue here is that the elections be
free and fair and inclusive."
Meanwhile, just miles from the heavily
fortified National Palace where Rice passed
most of her several hours in Haiti, Juste,
Yvon Neptune, Annette Auguste (So
Anne) and dozens of other political
prisoners and potential candidates
continue to sit behind bars, unable to
participate in the upcoming elections.
Last week — in yet another blow
to Haiti's constitution — the Haitian
Supreme Court ruled that Dumersais
Simeus, a Haitian-born Texas busi
nessman with close ties to the Bush
administration, is eligible to run for
president.This is in flagrant violation
of the country's constitution, which
states that all candidates for political
office must hold Haitian citizenship
and have lived in the country for at
least the past five years. Simeus has
lived in Texas for the past 25 years
and holds an American passport;
1 iaiti does not recognize dual citizen
ship.
1 low is it that a Texas businessman

is permitted to run for president of
Haiti, when the legitimate president.
Aristide, is in exile in South Africa
and Juste and other potential candi
dates are behind bars? Why are regis
tration numbers so low, with only 2.5
of 4.5 million eligible voters regis
tered as of mid-October? Why do
tens of thousands of people continue
to take to the streets calling for the re
turn of their elected president? How
can these elections possibly be con
sidered "free and fair and inclusive"?
To learn more about the U.S. role
in Haiti's coup — from financing op
position groups to forcibly removing
the elected president from the coun
try — come see the new documen
tary "Aristide and the Endless Revo
lution," premiering tomorrow at the
United Nations Association Film Fes
tival, held at Stanford. The film
screening is at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. Also, in November,
Brian Concannon and Mario Joseph,
two lawyers representing many of
Haiti's political prisoners, including
Juste, will be speaking at Stanford

about the current human rights crisis.
In a letter from prison addressed
to "Brothers and sisters around the
world." Juste sends a message of
hope: "I now have discovered so
much support for the I laitian people
and me from people all over the
world. 1 am in awe. I add my strength
to those who stand for the rights of
everyone, whatever color, whatever
creed, whatever nationality. Our spir
its are uplifted when we hear about
your work for I laiti. because we hear
hope coming." Our presence at these
events will nourish this hope: I en
courage people to attend.
