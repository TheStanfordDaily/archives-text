# Yo mama so cool...
## 
### 
A woman I barely knew
asked me point-blank
this summer, "I'm a cool
mom. right?" I contemplated the
question fora moment. She was
laid-back, fun, well-dressed and
an all-around cool person. But a
cool mom? I didn't have to know
her at all to answer that question.

No matter how many shop
ping trips, heart-to-hearts or home-cooked meals you
share with her, your mother by definition can never be
cool. For the same reasons that you should never grow up
to marry the kid you used to baby-sit, you should not be
best friends with your mother. One of the first lessons
they teach in middle-school health class is that a balanced
relationship requires that all parties treat each other as
equals. That is to say there is a balance of power between
you and your friends. And lets face it; your mom has
more power over you than anybody on the planet.
All the mothers reading this right now are probably
thinking, "So what if I have power over my kids? They
still talk to me about their lives.They still ask me for ad
vice and keep me up-to-date on what's going on with
them. Who are you to say I'm not a good mother?"
1 must clarify here: A good mother is not equivalent
to a cool mother. Parent-child relationships can be some
of the closest, most fulfilling relationships that many of
us will ever have — but they neither can, nor should,
transcend the restrictions that take form the first time
your mom changes your diaper or your dad shovels
mashed carrots off of your chin and into your mouth.
While dependability is a vital characteristic of any
friendship, the dependence you have on your parents
has its roots at your newborn state of utter vulnerabili
ty; that is the difference between the circle of friends
that you are a part of and the family that is a part of you.
So what do you do when — after years of feeding

you,cleaning up after you (if you
were lucky) and yelling at you
for dropping your little brother
on his head — all of a sudden
your mom wants to be your best
friend? Maybe she not-so-subtly
tries to slip some hip lingo into
her vocabulary, or maybe she is
suddenly fascinated by your
friends and wants to chill with

you and your peeps, yo.
One 40-year-old woman from Colorado took this fas
cination to the extreme. She was recently arrested for
supplying alcohol and drugs to her teenage daughter and
friends at the parties she threw for them, and she even se
duced several boys — who were less than half her age.
Ick factor and illegality aside, this is a sad example of how
badly some mothers long to be accepted by their chil
dren. She claims that her only motivation was to be a
"cool mom," and that she desperately needed to be pop
ular among her daughter's friends because she was de
cidedly unpopular during her own high school years.
I'm glad that my mom never tried to be cool; 1 don't
think I could have dealt with that. As embarrassing as it
may be to admit that your middle-aged mother has dec
orated the living room with baskets of dried floral
arrangements and pictures of cats saying witty things,
it's a million times worse if she dresses in halter tops and
miniskirts and has an obsession with Justin Timberlake.
It's just not cool to be a cool mom. You may think that
you want a mother who will giggle and gossip with you
about boys or who will buy you beer and smoke pot with
you, but, while you may be gaining a friend, you are los
ing a mother.
I would rather have a mother.
