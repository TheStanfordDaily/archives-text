Responses to Beinin's defense
of his doss and viewpoints
I have read criticism of Joel Beinin in the
Stanford Review and would like to comment
on the recent Daily article "Editorial ques
tions Beinin's political stance" (Oct. 17).
As has been mentioned on many occasions,
Beinin 's pro-Palestinian bias is obvious, but he
is certainly right in saying that "everyone who
deals with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has a
point of view." More than that, he has every
right to express his views on this subject. How
ever, if he chooses to do so in the class that he
teaches, a more appropriate title of the class
would be "The Palestinian Point of View:
Palestine, Zionism, and the Arab-Israeli Con
flict," so that students know what perspective
they will be receiving in the classroom.
Currently, many students assume that they
will get an unbiased view of the conflict, yet
that is very far from what Beinin is actually pre
senting. His bias is well-known; I have seen him
in the pro-Palestinian protest in White Plaza
on Nakba Day. I respect Beinin's right to voice
his opinion; however, I find it troublesome that

a Stanford professor would stand in support of
a demonstrator who carries a "Zionism =
Nazism sign and then attempt to teach an ob
jective view of the Arab-Israeli conllict.

Contrary to Beinin's assertion in 'ITie Daily
article "Editorial questions Beinin's political
stance (Oct. 17), Beinin never apologized to
me or had e-mail contact regarding his incor
rect videotape. Moreover, Beinin's math woes
continue to add up. Beinin states that he mis
took "one hundred million and a billion." Ac
tually, the original error was between 80 bil
lion dollars (the true amount of aid given to Is
rael since 1948) and a trillion dollars (the
amount Beinin claimed Israel received). I
stand by my Stanford Review editorial, and
have the transcripts of the lectures to support
the particulars of the other criticisms that were
published.
