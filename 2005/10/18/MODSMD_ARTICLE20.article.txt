## MEN'S SOCCER Men drop two in Pac-10 competition 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF" WRITER 
Defensive vulnerability and a long scoring drought
left a black eye on a young Stanford men's soccer team
in a pair of frustrating losses, 1-0 and 3-1 respectively, to
Washington and Oregon State this weekend.
On Friday night, Stanford (3-8-2, 0-4-1 Pacific-10
Conference) took on Washington — a team hungry for
its first conference win.The Huskies (8-3-2,2-2-1) came
out swiftly with exceptional midfield play, which be
stowed early rewards. In the 12th minute, sophomore
Brett Hite made a perfect run behind the Cardinal de
fense and was able to pop the ball back to streaking sen
ior forward Leo Totev. Totev then hit a one timer past
junior keeper Andrew Kartunen.
"Our backs weren't quite in a line to hold an offside
line, and he slipped a beautiful ball across fora great first
time finish." Stanford head coach Bret Simon said. "As
much as I could nit-pick about what we did on that, you
have to give them some credit. 1 think it was a pretty
classy goal."
Down early, the Cardinal had to carry a heavy weight
on top of the pressure from a three-game scoreless
streak and season-long offensive struggles.
"If you're scoring two to three goals a game,you think
'all right we messed up, but we'll come back and we'll get
it,'" Simon said. "1 know it sounds too simple to be true,
but if you score a few goals you feel like you could do it
at any moment. When you're struggling to score, that
first goal is always a killer if it's not on your side."
The early goal also allowed Washington, a strong de
fensive club, to focus solely on stifling Stanford's offense.
"They pulled their guys back and had everybody sit
in," freshman defender Michael Alexander said. "It's a
lot harder to break a team that way."
However, a set of halftime adjustments really opened
the game up for the Cardinal as they varied their forma
tion and came out with added intensity and purpose.
Three minutes into the half, sophomore forward Marcus
Ryan had a free kick outside the 18-yard box that dove
down with spin towards the left corner, but senior keep
er Chris Eylander was up to the task.
The Cardinal's best chance came midway through the
second half when two freshmen — Tiinji Munjabi and
Alexander — worked a beautiful pass through the
seams of the Washington defense, freeing Alexander to
rip a shot on net.
"The defenders tried to pull me offside andTlinji put
an amazing ball through," Alexander said. "I cut the de
fender and tried to shoot the ball far post but the goalie

got a little touch on it and pushed it wide."
Stanford then took on Oregon State (8-3-4, 4-1-0)
Sunday afternoon. Once again, the Cardinal were able to
play effective possession-oriented soccer and they sti
fled Oregon State's attack for the first 43 minutes.
However, a sloppy defensive error put Stanford in an
other hole. A defender attempted to head the ball back
to Kartunen. but did not hit it with enough power. The
Beavers' Bryan Jordan, who came in as a sub because of
his speed, sprinted after the ball and popped it over the
keeper into the net. Despite outshooting and outplaying
Oregon State, the Cardinal once again played from be
hind.
There was a scary moment when sophomore Kyle

Hency went down after being struck in the head. Hency
tried to walk off the field but sat back down in pain and
was helped off by a trainer. After being treated with a
head wrap, the midfielder returned to the field for the
rest of the match.
The second half greatly resembled the first, with
Stanford carrying the play. But once again, the Beavers'
playmakers came through when junior forward Robbie
Findley shook off a defender at the 18-yard box with a
gifted turn and rocketed a ball into the top corner.
Stanford was able to get itself back into the match
when Alexander slid a cross into the box. The ball then
