### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Dark clouds and rain gave way to bright sun
shine as the Stanford field hockey team (5-11,
3-2 Northern Pacific Conference) decimated
NorPac rival Longwood (4-9,1 -2) this past Sat
urday at the Farm
The Cardinal blanked the Lancers 3-0 with
freshman midfielder/forward Caroline Hussey,
junior forward Liz Robinson and junior de
fender/midfielder Julia Drewes all scoring one
goal a piece.
"We were pleased to take the win and creat
ed a lot of offense," head coach Lesley Irvine
said.
Though happy with the morale-boosting
win, Irvine indicated that she did have one re
gret regarding the victory.
"We could have converted more of the op
portunities," Irvine said.
The squad scored three times early in the
first half to gain the lead. First to score was
Hussey at 9:31; Robinson followed at 19:07 with
an assist from senior defender Lyndsay Erick
son; and Drewes put the finishing touch at 21:43
on a penalty stroke.
Stanford outshot the Longwood by a stag
gering 40-0 in 70 minutes. Junior defender Aska
Sturdevan was the lead shot-taker, with 10
shots. Robinson took seven shots while Drewes
and sophomore Jess Zutz each tallied six.
"The defense did a good job shutting down
[the Longwood offense] early and stepping to
the ball with confidence," Irvine said. "We
never allowed their offense to become a
threat."
Freshman goalkeeper Sarah Scheller, who
was named NorPac Rookie of the Week in Sep
tember but watched sophomore Madison Bell
in the box on Saturday, admitted the team
played an excellent game of field hockey.
"The offense did an amazing job," Scheller
said." It was nice that we were dominating them
offensively. One of our team goals was to not
allow any corners or any shots. It was great to
achieve that goal this game."
Stanford also held a significant lead in earn

ing penalty corners with the squad earning 18
against the Lancers' one.
Longwood goalie sophomore Avanell
Schmitz made a career high 17 saves for Long
wood. blunting the Stanford offensive on
slaught, amidst disappointing Longwood play.
Bell played all 70 minutes in the match and
had little to save, since the Lancers failed to

take a single shot. Nevertheless, the team was
successful in achieving a lot of its goals.
"We really focused on our own game,"
Irvine said. "We achieved a lot of our goals
coming into the match."
Scheller indicated the victory was particu
larly sweet for other reasons.
"It was nice to pick up our first conference

victory at home," Scheller said.
Irvine looks forward to the tough home
game coming up against rival NorPac leader,
California (9-6,5-1), calling it a "big game" for
the Cardinal. The Cardinal has a weekend off
before facing Cal and is scheduled to play the
alumni team this Saturday at 1:0() p.m. at on the
Varsity Field Hockey TUrf.

Freshman midfielder/forward Hillary Braun concentrates on making a good pass during a previous match. Braun has been a strong contributor as
a true freshman so far this season and she saw her team notch its third NorPac win of the season on Saturday.
