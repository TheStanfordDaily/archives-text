# USC-Notre Dame game is an 'instant classic'
## 
### 
For the three of you who missed it, here's the
bottom line of Saturday's mythical, where
were-you-when tilt between Notre Dame and
USC: The most hyped game in years for any sport
blew away every expectation.
Notre Dame controlled the clock and prodded
every weakness of the No. 1-ranked Trojans. Heis
man Trophy front-runner Reggie Bush ran for three
touchdowns, but with under a minute to play it
looked like the Trojans' 27-game win-streak was in
serious jeopardy. USC converted a do-or-die fourth
and-9, one of two decisive plays on a march into his
tory. When the officials ruled that quarterback Matt
Leinart's fumble had been out-of-bounds, they were
forced to silence the Notre Dame celebration and
put seven seconds back on the clock. On the ensuing
play, Leinart spun into the end zone for the game
winning touchdown.
On a weekend with a bushel of wild finishes, this
game stood out as something truly special, a contest
that will be recalled year in and year out as the his
tory of college football progresses. The term "in
stant classic" seems modest; Notre Dame's would
be upset instantly entered the pantheon of the
greatest games in football history.
A number of those games are discussed below
and it's almost certain that you will find several
commonalities between all these contests:
Heavyweights — The teams involved were na
tional powers with long streaks of success. In most
cases, a national championship was on the line. (This
year's Notre Dame team looks like the exception,
but may not turn out to be.)
Clean Play — Great games are played straight
up, without a lot of mistakes. Touchdowns are
scored with great plays, not when the defense blows
an assignment. Offensive drives fail because the de
fense asserts itself, not because of execution errors.
The kicking game gives unheralded players oppor
tunities to show their skill.
Interest Factor — Often these are sensational
events that draw the entire sporting world into mad-

Elevation — Great games fea
ture alternating sequences of great
plays, as one team raises the bar and
the other rises to match it. Great
players pull themselves up to a tran
scendent level of athletic perform
ance, allowing for the sort of signa
ture plays that stick in fans' con
sciousness for years to come. (Stan
ford-Cal, 1982 is not included in this
because it doesn't fit the above crite
ria. "The Play" notwithstanding, it
was a dog of a game between two
middling teams.)
LSU 7, Mississippi 3 (1959): Two
southern powers, both national
championship material, duked it out
on Halloween. With Ole Miss lead
ing 3-0 in fourth quarter. Tiger star
Billy Cannon's electrifying 89-yard
punt return fora touchdown explod
ed into the Baton Rogue night. Can
non also ran away in the Heisman
Trophy, beating out the second-place
finisher by more than a three-to-one
margin.
Nebraska 35, Oklahoma 31
(1971): This Thanksgiving Day don
nybrook was billed as the "Game of
the Century" between two smash
mouth teams in the Heartland. In
awe-inspiring fashion, the teams
took turns one-upping the other as
the lead changed five times. Corn
husker dart Johnny Rodgers, who
would take the Heisman Trophy that
year, opened the scoring with a sen
sational 72-yard punt return. Ne
braska coach Bob Devaney won his
second straight national title and
hung it up after the following season.
Alabama 14, Penn State 7 (1979
Sugar Bowl):This was covered in my
last column, but to make it quick:
two great coaches, Joe Paterno and
Bear Bryant, faced off in one of the
hardest-hitting games ever captured

on television. Penn State, with the
nation's No. 1 defense, had not been
defeated in 19 games but was even
tually outdone by the Tide's dynam
ic offense and punishing defensive
prowess. 'Bama linebacker Barry
Krauss' fourth-and-goal stop put out
Penn State's last fire, and the Crim
son Tide won the national champi
onship — its first of two straight and
six total under Bryant.
Boston College 47, Miami 45
(1984): BC's sophisticated passing
offense, led by indomitable quarter
back Doug Flutie, flummoxed the
defending national champions all
evening long. The wild seesaw game
saw Flutie and Hurricane star
Bernie Kosar both throw for over
400 yards.
The Hurricanes thought they had
won it but didn't count on Flutie
launching a sodden ball 60 yards in
the air with no time left on the clock.
His roommate Gerard Phelan
caught the ball behind a bevy of
players in the end zone, sending the
Eagles to the Cotton Bowl.
Flutie, perhaps the best college
quarterback since the end of the sin
gle-wing era, won the Heisman Tro
phy for his magical season. He went
on to star in the Canadian Football
League, whose offensive ingenuity
took full advantage of his skills.
Ohio State 31, Miami 24, 20T
(2(X)3 Fiesta Bowl): Fora team that
needed a lot of lucky breaks to get
there, Ohio State looked like it was
about to run away with one of the
biggest upsets in a decade thanks to
its swarming defense. But. Miami's
explosive offense caught fire late
and sent the game to overtime,
where a highly controversial pass-in
terference call on fourth down kept
the Buckeyes alive. A fourth-down
stop by Ohio State finally van
quished the outcoached Hurricanes,
whose 34-game winning streak and
dreams of a second straight title
were dashed.

Heavyweights — The teams involved were na
tional powers with long streaks of success. In most
cases, a national championship was on the line. (This
year's Notre Dame team looks like the exception,
but may not turn out to be.)
Clean Play — Great games are played straight
up, without a lot of mistakes. Touchdowns are
scored with great plays, not when the defense blows
an assignment. Offensive drives fail because the de
fense asserts itself, not because of execution errors.
The kicking game gives unheralded players oppor
tunities to show their skill.
Interest Factor — Often these are sensational

Elevation — Great games fea

plays, as one team raises the bar and
the other rises to match it. Great
players pull themselves up to a tran

ance, allowing for the sort of signa

sciousness for years to come. (Stan
ford-Cal, 1982 is not included in this
because it doesn't fit the above crite
ria. "The Play" notwithstanding, it
was a dog of a game between two
middling teams.)
LSU 7, Mississippi 3 (1959): Two
southern powers, both national
championship material, duked it out
on Halloween. With Ole Miss lead
ing 3-0 in fourth quarter. Tiger star
Billy Cannon's electrifying 89-yard
punt return fora touchdown explod
ed into the Baton Rogue night. Can
non also ran away in the Heisman
Trophy, beating out the second-place
finisher by more than a three-to-one
margin.
Nebraska 35, Oklahoma 31
(1971): This Thanksgiving Day don
nybrook was billed as the "Game of
the Century" between two smash
mouth teams in the Heartland. In
awe-inspiring fashion, the teams
took turns one-upping the other as
the lead changed five times. Corn
husker dart Johnny Rodgers, who
would take the Heisman Trophy that
year, opened the scoring with a sen
sational 72-yard punt return. Ne
braska coach Bob Devaney won his
second straight national title and
hung it up after the following season.
Alabama 14, Penn State 7 (1979
Sugar Bowl):This was covered in my
last column, but to make it quick:
two great coaches, Joe Paterno and
Bear Bryant, faced off in one of the
hardest-hitting games ever captured

on television. Penn State, with the
nation's No. 1 defense, had not been
defeated in 19 games but was even
tually outdone by the Tide's dynam
ic offense and punishing defensive
prowess. 'Bama linebacker Barry
Krauss' fourth-and-goal stop put out
Penn State's last fire, and the Crim
son Tide won the national champi
onship — its first of two straight and
six total under Bryant.
Boston College 47, Miami 45
(1984): BC's sophisticated passing
offense, led by indomitable quarter
back Doug Flutie, flummoxed the
defending national champions all
evening long. The wild seesaw game
saw Flutie and Hurricane star
Bernie Kosar both throw for over
400 yards.
The Hurricanes thought they had
won it but didn't count on Flutie
launching a sodden ball 60 yards in
the air with no time left on the clock.
His roommate Gerard Phelan
caught the ball behind a bevy of
players in the end zone, sending the
Eagles to the Cotton Bowl.
Flutie, perhaps the best college
quarterback since the end of the sin
gle-wing era, won the Heisman Tro
phy for his magical season. He went
on to star in the Canadian Football
League, whose offensive ingenuity
took full advantage of his skills.
Ohio State 31, Miami 24, 20T
(2(X)3 Fiesta Bowl): Fora team that
needed a lot of lucky breaks to get
there, Ohio State looked like it was
about to run away with one of the
biggest upsets in a decade thanks to
its swarming defense. But. Miami's
explosive offense caught fire late
and sent the game to overtime,
where a highly controversial pass-in
terference call on fourth down kept
the Buckeyes alive. A fourth-down
stop by Ohio State finally van
quished the outcoached Hurricanes,
whose 34-game winning streak and
dreams of a second straight title
were dashed.

For the three of you who missed it, here's the
bottom line of Saturday's mythical, where
were-you-when tilt between Notre Dame and
USC: The most hyped game in years for any sport
blew away every expectation.
Notre Dame controlled the clock and prodded
every weakness of the No. 1-ranked Trojans. Heis
man Trophy front-runner Reggie Bush ran for three
touchdowns, but with under a minute to play it
looked like the Trojans' 27-game win-streak was in
serious jeopardy. USC converted a do-or-die fourth
and-9, one of two decisive plays on a march into his
tory. When the officials ruled that quarterback Matt
Leinart's fumble had been out-of-bounds, they were
forced to silence the Notre Dame celebration and
put seven seconds back on the clock. On the ensuing
play, Leinart spun into the end zone for the game
winning touchdown.
On a weekend with a bushel of wild finishes, this
game stood out as something truly special, a contest
that will be recalled year in and year out as the his
tory of college football progresses. The term "in
stant classic" seems modest; Notre Dame's would
be upset instantly entered the pantheon of the
greatest games in football history.
A number of those games are discussed below
and it's almost certain that you will find several
commonalities between all these contests:
