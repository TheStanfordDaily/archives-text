The eight-time NCAA champi
on Stanford women's swimming
and diving program (1-0) coasted to
an easy victory in its first non-con
ference meet of the season on Fri
day. In the 199-114 victory over
hapless San Jose State (0-1), the
Cardinal were dominating through
out the meet, emerging from the
water first in 12 of 14 swimming
events.
First-year head coach Lea Maur
er, a former Cardinal swimmer
earned a win in her collegiate coach
ing debut. With the victory, the Car
dinal extended their dual meet win
streak to seven, their last loss dating
back nearly one year to the second
meet of the 2004-05 season, against
powerhouse Texas.
To open the meet, a Stanford
quartet — made up of freshmen An
drea Axtell and Laura Wadden and
sophomores Erica Liu and Brooke
Bishop — edged a squad of its own
teammates — comprised of senior
Dana Kirk, sophomore Katherine
Bell and freshmen Fiona O'Don
nell-McCarthy and Madeline Rovi
ra — to sweep the top two spots in
the 200-yard medley relay.
Stanford continued to show their
power as the meet went on. Bishop,
a Mountain View local, emerged as
the star of the meet, with a win in
both the 200-backstroke and 200-
freestyle events.
Junior Morgan Hentzen added
victories in the 500- and 1,000-yard
freestyle events, leading a group of
Stanford athletes that swept the top
four spots of both swims.
Liu and Wadden continued the
streak of double victories, contribut
ing a couple of incredible first
swims. Liu swept the 100- and 200-
yard breaststroke events and Wad
den took the 100- and 200-yard but
terfly events.
In the fourth event of the day.
