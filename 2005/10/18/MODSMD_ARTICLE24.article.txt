## Card pull out two wins and a four-set loss in Canadian tourney 
### By: ELIZABETH AGUILAR MANAGING EDITOR 
It wasn't the host nation's teams that Stanford
men's volleyball had trouble with at the Husky Dino
Cup in Calgary, Canada â€” the Cardinal easily shut
down Regina and Calgary, with 3-0 sweeps. It turned
out to be Stanford's nearby-Stockton neighbor, Pacif

ic, that defeated the Cardinal, 3-1, in the tournament
final.
After dropping the first game to the Tigers, 25-10,
senior opposite Ben Reddy's kill gave the Cardinal a
one-point lead towards the end of the second game.
Reddy then sealed a 25-23 win with a block. He led the
team with 14 kills on Sunday and 12 kills against Cal
gary on Saturday.
Though Stanford played well in the third and
fourth sets, the team lost momentum late in the games
and gave Pacific 25-17 and 25-18 victories. The men's
next match is scheduled for January.
