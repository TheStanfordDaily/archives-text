## Public policy may offer co-term Interdisciplinary program now part of Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research 
### ZEWDE YERASWORK STAFF WRITER 
The public policy undergraduate major at Stan
ford has recently undergone a change of department
and is currently considering offering a master's de
gree in public policy.
In an attempt to bring together researchers with
related teaching programs, rtie public policy major is
now a part of the Stanford Institute for Economic
Policy Research (SIEPR), an interdisciplinary re
search-oriented organization.
Prof. Bruce Owen, a senior fellow at SIEPR, is the
new director of this interdisciplinary program.
"The undergraduate public policy major focuses
on subjects and skills that are closely related to the
SIEPR research program," Owen said in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Therefore, it made sense to have the
major administered by SIEPR."
The program had previously been administered by
Sharon Long, the dean of humanities and sciences,
who will remain responsible for the academic over
sight of the public policy major.
According to Owen, the changes made to the pro
gram have thus far been largely administrative. He
stated that "the present program is excellent and is
not in need of fundamental change."
"We hope to bring greater administrative stability
and of course we
will review the entire program to see where improve
ments could be made," Owen said.
Fifth year co-terminal student Ethan Cantil-
Voorhees, a public policy major, said he hopes that the
change of administration will provide "the benefit of
having more resources" due to the nature of the SIERP
As for the possibility of instituting graduate public
policy studies, Owen said it will take "at least a year to
formulate and gain approval of any new graduate
program."
While many other schools across the country have
already created a master's program in public policy,
Owen said that the reason Stanford is just beginning
to create one is that "no previous proposal has gar
nered sufficient support."
According to Owen, the graduate program would
provide the practical basis for "professional students,
such as lawyers, engineers, doctors and so on. the op
portunity to learn the language of modern policy
analysis and to participate in interdisciplinary teams
to address real world policy problems."
Cantil-Voorhees explained that if a master's pro
gram were implemented during his time as an under
graduate "I would have taken it rather than co-term
in sociology, which is what I ended up doing."
According to Owen, the process of creating a grad
uate program is still in the early stages of development.
"We are just beginning to define the proposal,"
Owen said. "We have started by focusing on joint or
'dual' degrees in cooperation with Stanford's various
graduate and professional schools. Later, this could
be expanded to co-terminal undergraduates. There
are no immediate plans to offer the degree on a stand
alone basis."
Senior Laura Villanueva said she did not place
"nearly as much importance" on the changes to pub
lic policy undergraduate administration as she did on
the possibility of a graduate option, stating that
"something should be done about a master's program
for future students."
Owen acknowledged that "over the years many of
Stanford's undergraduate policy majors have ex
pressed strong support fora master's program."
"At this point we have not focused on a co-termi
nal program and therefore have not yet begun a sys
tematic assessment of undergraduate views," Owen
said. "That will come later."
Junior public policy major Shawn Chen said he be
lieved the creation of a master's program should go
smoothly as certain public policy classes already in
clude "a lot of master's work."
"We basically wrote a master's thesis in one of
these classes," Chen said.
Undeclared freshman James Hohmann claimed that
in majoring in public policy he is pursuing a passion.
"One of the reasons I came to Stanford was the
inter-disciplinary program," Hohmann said. "I would
definitely consider pursuing graduate studies in public
policy at Stanford. So far all the classes fascinate me."

to address real world policy problems."
Cantil-Voorhees explained that if a master's pro
gram were implemented during his time as an under
graduate "I would have taken it rather than co-term
in sociology, which is what I ended up doing."
According to Owen, the process of creating a grad
uate program is still in the early stages of development.
"We are just beginning to define the proposal,"
Owen said. "We have started by focusing on joint or
'dual' degrees in cooperation with Stanford's various
graduate and professional schools. Later, this could
be expanded to co-terminal undergraduates. There
are no immediate plans to offer the degree on a stand
alone basis."
Senior Laura Villanueva said she did not place
"nearly as much importance" on the changes to pub
lic policy undergraduate administration as she did on
the possibility of a graduate option, stating that
"something should be done about a master's program
for future students."
Owen acknowledged that "over the years many of
Stanford's undergraduate policy majors have ex
pressed strong support fora master's program."
"At this point we have not focused on a co-termi
nal program and therefore have not yet begun a sys
tematic assessment of undergraduate views," Owen
said. "That will come later."
Junior public policy major Shawn Chen said he be
lieved the creation of a master's program should go
smoothly as certain public policy classes already in
clude "a lot of master's work."
"We basically wrote a master's thesis in one of
these classes," Chen said.
Undeclared freshman James Hohmann claimed that
in majoring in public policy he is pursuing a passion.
"One of the reasons I came to Stanford was the
inter-disciplinary program," Hohmann said. "I would
definitely consider pursuing graduate studies in public
policy at Stanford. So far all the classes fascinate me."
