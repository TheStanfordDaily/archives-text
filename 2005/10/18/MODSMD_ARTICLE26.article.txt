## Pediatricians find that babies can eat adult or solid food

Forget that tasteless, pulverized mush that your
mother fed you. The babies of today are entering a
world with much wider culinary possibilities.
"The idea that babies have to be weaned to bland
food is a Westernized, North American view," said
David Bergman, an associate professor of pediatrics
and a pediatrician at the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford. "In reality, babies are
raised with a variety of foods in a variety of
i places, and they all grow to be happy infants.
There is no need fora specific order of comple
mentary foods."
According to Bergman, all babies transition
through certain developmental stages for eating
foods of different textures and shapes. These include
breast feeding until at least six months, for which
many health benefits have been proven.
Babies then learn to control their tongue reflexes
so that they can consume more solid foods. Until
eight or nine months, small foods can get stuck in
their mouths and throats, so parents have to be pre
pared to reach down to pull out lodged chunks. Yet,
other than the size of the foods, there are no set rules
for how spicy or bland the food should be after babies
are weaned off of breast milk, Bergman explained.
Larry Hammer, also a pediatrician at the Chil
dren's Hospital, agreed.
"There is no reason to withhold foods from the
mother or child's diet," he said."ln reality,feeding the
child spices similar to those the mother eats will help
the baby become better exposed to the types of foods
the family eats culturally."
Hammer noted that studies have been complet
ed showing that babies prefer sweet over sour, but
that over time babies also enjoy sour, bitter and
even spicy foods. He said he thinks that the conven
tional wisdom regarding baby nutrition could be
from old wives' tales, but confirms that no research
proved that bland food is a necessary component of
a baby's diet.
Bergman further speculated that the traditional
baby diet could stem from baby food companies.
"[The companies] started mass producing unex
citing baby foods, and the habit of feeding kids bland
foods caught on," he said.
Hammer did voice some concern, however, about
introducing children to spicier foods at an early age.
"If baby food is too flavorful, some infants will not
like it because they are not that adaptable to changes
in taste, so it is better to start with blander food and
add to it," Hammer said. "If their behavior changes or
they have stomach pains, then they just aren't ready
for the change yet."
Sophomore Sarah Rizk agreed that infants can
eat a wide variety of foods.
"I used to eat red hot chili pepper flakes by the
handful, my parents had to take them away," she said.
Sophomore Lauren Harper said that perhaps
young children who haven't been exposed to a wide
variety of tastes develop into picky eaters and more
closed-minded adults, which could be avoided if they
were exposed to a wider variety of flavors.
Bergman concluded by reiterating the impor
tance of parents' response to their individual chil
dren's needs.
"The best things parents can do with infant eating
is for them to understand and be sensitive to their
children," Bergman said. "They should look upon
feeding as an interactive time, and through their
child's responsive behavior they can tell what is ap
propriate."
