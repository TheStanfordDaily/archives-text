# KISS ME CARDINAL
## Annual Full Moon proves sedate, maybe a little too much so 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students eagerly embraced the much
anticipated Full Moon on the Quad last night, as
thousands of freshmen and seniors — plus an un
known number of camouflaged sophomores, jun
iors and graduate students — gathered in the
Main Quad for the annual lip-locking soiree under
the moonlight.
There were no reports of arrests or hospitaliza
tions at press time.
An estimated 500 students had already been

waiting in the Main Quad for a night of festive
music and dance by 10:30 p.m., when the event was
scheduled to begin.The lineup of performances in
cluded Crooked Mile, Jack Conte,The Spins Band,
Inphanyte, Dv8, Urban Styles and student musi
cian Chris Ayer.
For the first time. Full Moon featured a large
scale stage set up to recreate a rock concert atmos
phere, according to senior Joe Pirolo, co-chair of
Absolute Fun, the group that organized Full
Moon together with the ASSU. Full concert lights
were mounted on metal scaffolding, with two large
projection screens on either side of the stage
showing the performances live.
Many students arrived in groups, navigating the
Quad with wobbly steps that were apparently the
result of pre-party drinking. Some freshmen wan

dered alone, quietly searching for the senior lip
that would seal their Cardinal initiation with a kiss.
Some might find it interesting — or disen
chanting— that the streakers this year did not
seem to loosen themselves enough, or at least not
as much as they did in previous years. Many of
them wore elaborate paint designs, decorations or
even small pieces of clothes that were best de
scribed as artistic rather than exotic or sexy.
As the one-minute countdown to midnight
drew to a close on the screens, couples threw cau
tion to the wind, as well as many customary con
straints on public display of affection.
"That was beyond belief "extolled senior Mike
Thompson, who had just French-kissed a girl he

had met earlier in the night. "That
was an amazing kiss, and I'll never
forget [name of the girl he just
kissed]."
Other options were available to
those who wished to express them
selves in ways other than kissing.
"A lot of people just don't like to
kiss other people randomly," sopho
more Steve Kim said, holding a sign
that read "Hugs."
"I'm providing them with an al
ternative here," he said.
Kirn estimated that he had
hugged some 40 people in the 20
minutes that he had been in the
Quad.
For those who had looked for
ward to smooching with the Tree at
Full Moon this year, she was a notice
able absence.
"She found the Tree costume was
n't conspicuous enough," said Chris
Holt, public relations manager for
the Stanford Marching Band."So she
preferred to use 20 green balloons
instead."
Over 40 Stanford students wear
ing staff T-shirts served as student
volunteers to ensure their class

mates' safety, according to Pirolo.
About 10 members of the Stanford
police were also on site to manage
the crowd.
Peer health educators set up
counters where student could get
candies, condoms and Listerine.
Pirolo said he was largely satisfied
with this year's Full Moon, on which
the ASSU spent more than $10,000.
"1 think it's been great," he said.
"From my point of view, we've got a
lot of groups to perform tonight and
a great turnout. Our goal is to make
sure that everyone has a good time. I
think we achieve that goal."
But some students expressed dis
appointment that Full moon did not
have as much debauchery in store as
they had necessarily been promised.
"It's the most conservative and
the least fun Full Moon on the Quad
in my four years here," said senior
Tyler Johnston, whose comment was
immediately echoed by his draw
mates. "People just seem really up
tight this year.That wasn't the case in
the past."
But for others, Full Moon on the
Quad is a tradition that will never be
corny.
"It's always fun," said senior Car
oline Cahill, who has attended Full
Moon with her boyfriend since fresh
man year. "It's the best people
watching event on campus ever."
