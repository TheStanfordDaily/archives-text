## Med student could still be dismissed 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Medical School has taken a bold step by hold
ing a hearing to determine the future of Ignacio Munoz, a
fifth-year medical student on the verge of being dismissed
from his prospects of becoming a doctor.
The hearing was called last week due to accusations
against Munoz for displaying unprofessional conduct, bar
ring his pursuit of an MD. A list of digressions from respon
sible behavior, such as timeliness and politeness, are among
the few in the pile of wrongs that the medical supervisors
hold at fault with Munoz.
While such self-scrutinizing cases of medical schools are
possible, they are extremely rare. According to Munoz, the
few cases which led to the actual dismissal of students were
for blatantly harmful reasons such as physical abuse of pa
tients— cases which typically are classified as federal
crimes. He still seemed puzzled by the fact that Stanford
would take radical steps over the matter of erratic behavior.
The marking distinction of the case, however, is Munoz's
background. Born and raised in the Bronx, Munoz's past en
tails a string of violence — parental abuse, a family murder
and frequent visits from the New York Police Department.
"I'm atypical in terms of Stanford med students," Munoz
said. "I was raised in an environment that taught me to be
disobedient to authority. It takes time for me to learn these
things."
It appears that Munoz has already run out of time. The
hearing is the final step in a sequential effort outlined by the
Suitability for Practices of Medicine, which delineates the
due process the University will take when handling prob
lematic students. The decision from this hearing — which
will be made by the five members of
the medical school faculty Senate —
will determine his future in the field.
"I know I've made mistakes,"
Munoz admits. "But it's giving no
flexibility to the development of a
medical student. It's expecting me to
be a perfect med student from the
start, which no one is."
In fact Munoz was given two previ
ous chances for improvement. Stu
dents first receive a personal warning,
in which a supervisor will simply ver
bally indicate what needs to be correct
ed. When this personal communication
fails to bear fruit, students endure an
informal hearing during which specific
points are written as a contract that the
student signs to pledge compliance.
The University supervisors al
leged at the hearing that despite
these chances, Munoz's laundry list
of misdoings continued to pile up:

tardiness, absence at lectures, leaving
early and not taking a license test he
agreed to take.
The most recent strike against
Munoz was his clerkship with the
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
According to an article in The San
Jose Mercury News, Dolly Goel, the
chief of staff at the center, asked
Stanford that Munoz discontinue his
rotations. The Center declined to
elaborate on what grounds they
made such a decision.
Elliot Wolfe, a consulting profes
sor of internal medicine at Stanford
and one of Munoz's leading advo
cates, contends that the problem was
with the center, not Munoz.
"There are certain rules that the
school is required to follow by the
Liaison Committee on Medical Edu
cation," Wolfe said. The LCME is an
organization which accredits med
ical schools over the nation.
"If any student in a clerkship is not
doing well, he needs to be told very
early in that clerkship so that both par
ties can mediate ahead," Wolfe said.
"That did not happen to Ignacio in the

Valley Medical Center clerkship."
Wolfe pointed to a failure in bal
ance between University standards
and student needs as the heart of the
matter. While optimally these two
factors should meet at a point where
both parties are satisfied, the case of
Munoz illustrates the need for some
alterations.
"What if attending lectures is not
the way I learn?" stated Munoz. "I
am an adult who knows how he
works." Munoz attributed his tran
sience to the University's lack of ac
commodation for disadvantaged
students such as himself who stick
out of the medical norm.
Munoz argued that in accepting
him despite his rough and potentially
problematic background, yet com
pletely ignoring that very factor in eval
uating his 'unprofessional' behavior,
the University is communicating an ex
tremely simple message: negligence.
"They say, 'Oh, look at Stanford,
we're so diverse,' but where is the ef
fort to really understand my diversi
ty here?" questioned Munoz.
Wolfe called this disjoint between

institution and student as a lack of
cultural sensitivity.
"My position on this is that the
people on the administration were
not sensitive to his background and
the problems associated with his life
in New York as a child," Wolfe said.
"Instead of helping him and nurtur
ing him with his difficulty, they be
came very antagonistic. They were
overly critical of him, without giving
him appropriate feedback."
Sensitivity training, which points
to a general awareness and apprecia
tion of cultural differences, is pivotal
for students such as Munoz to seam
lessly adapt to the medical world.
"And it's not just me," Munoz
said. "There are others like me. Ei
ther they just didn't say anything or
didn't get as far as I am."
Meanwhile, Munoz's career as a
doctor is still pending as the final de
cision of the hearing has yet to come.

Medical School spokesperson, de

Wolfe called this disjoint between

institution and student as a lack of
cultural sensitivity.
"My position on this is that the
people on the administration were
not sensitive to his background and
the problems associated with his life
in New York as a child," Wolfe said.
"Instead of helping him and nurtur
ing him with his difficulty, they be
came very antagonistic. They were
overly critical of him, without giving
him appropriate feedback."
Sensitivity training, which points
to a general awareness and apprecia
tion of cultural differences, is pivotal
for students such as Munoz to seam
lessly adapt to the medical world.
"And it's not just me," Munoz
said. "There are others like me. Ei
ther they just didn't say anything or
didn't get as far as I am."
Meanwhile, Munoz's career as a
doctor is still pending as the final de
cision of the hearing has yet to come.

Stanford Medical School has taken a bold step by hold
ing a hearing to determine the future of Ignacio Munoz, a
fifth-year medical student on the verge of being dismissed
from his prospects of becoming a doctor.
The hearing was called last week due to accusations
against Munoz for displaying unprofessional conduct, bar
ring his pursuit of an MD. A list of digressions from respon
sible behavior, such as timeliness and politeness, are among
the few in the pile of wrongs that the medical supervisors
hold at fault with Munoz.
While such self-scrutinizing cases of medical schools are
possible, they are extremely rare. According to Munoz, the
few cases which led to the actual dismissal of students were
for blatantly harmful reasons such as physical abuse of pa
tients— cases which typically are classified as federal
crimes. He still seemed puzzled by the fact that Stanford
would take radical steps over the matter of erratic behavior.
The marking distinction of the case, however, is Munoz's
background. Born and raised in the Bronx, Munoz's past en
tails a string of violence — parental abuse, a family murder
and frequent visits from the New York Police Department.
"I'm atypical in terms of Stanford med students," Munoz
said. "I was raised in an environment that taught me to be
disobedient to authority. It takes time for me to learn these
things."
It appears that Munoz has already run out of time. The
hearing is the final step in a sequential effort outlined by the
Suitability for Practices of Medicine, which delineates the
due process the University will take when handling prob
lematic students. The decision from this hearing — which
will be made by the five members of
the medical school faculty Senate —
will determine his future in the field.
"I know I've made mistakes,"
Munoz admits. "But it's giving no
flexibility to the development of a
medical student. It's expecting me to
be a perfect med student from the
start, which no one is."
In fact Munoz was given two previ
ous chances for improvement. Stu
dents first receive a personal warning,
in which a supervisor will simply ver
bally indicate what needs to be correct
ed. When this personal communication
fails to bear fruit, students endure an
informal hearing during which specific
points are written as a contract that the
student signs to pledge compliance.
The University supervisors al
leged at the hearing that despite
these chances, Munoz's laundry list
of misdoings continued to pile up:

tardiness, absence at lectures, leaving
early and not taking a license test he
agreed to take.
The most recent strike against
Munoz was his clerkship with the
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
According to an article in The San
Jose Mercury News, Dolly Goel, the
chief of staff at the center, asked
Stanford that Munoz discontinue his
rotations. The Center declined to
elaborate on what grounds they
made such a decision.
Elliot Wolfe, a consulting profes
sor of internal medicine at Stanford
and one of Munoz's leading advo
cates, contends that the problem was
with the center, not Munoz.
"There are certain rules that the
school is required to follow by the
Liaison Committee on Medical Edu
cation," Wolfe said. The LCME is an
organization which accredits med
ical schools over the nation.
"If any student in a clerkship is not
doing well, he needs to be told very
early in that clerkship so that both par
ties can mediate ahead," Wolfe said.
"That did not happen to Ignacio in the

Valley Medical Center clerkship."
Wolfe pointed to a failure in bal
ance between University standards
and student needs as the heart of the
matter. While optimally these two
factors should meet at a point where
both parties are satisfied, the case of
Munoz illustrates the need for some
alterations.
"What if attending lectures is not
the way I learn?" stated Munoz. "I
am an adult who knows how he
works." Munoz attributed his tran
sience to the University's lack of ac
commodation for disadvantaged
students such as himself who stick
out of the medical norm.
Munoz argued that in accepting
him despite his rough and potentially
problematic background, yet com
pletely ignoring that very factor in eval
uating his 'unprofessional' behavior,
the University is communicating an ex
tremely simple message: negligence.
"They say, 'Oh, look at Stanford,
we're so diverse,' but where is the ef
fort to really understand my diversi
ty here?" questioned Munoz.
