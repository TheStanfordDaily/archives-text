# Gravity Probe to prove Einstein's theories
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
The Gravity Probe B project, a satellite-based collabo
rative experiment by Stanford, NASA and the Lockheed-
Martin Corporation, is in the final stage of its quest to iso
late previously unobserved effects predicted by Einstein's
general theory of relativity.
The probe, which was launched at a California Air Force
Base in 2(X)4.has been in orbit for 17 months. It houses four
digitally suspended gyroscopes, which, at an orbit of 4(X)
miles above the Earth, are ultra-stable and free enough
from disturbance to isolate tiny changes in spin that are the
result of the geodetic effect and the frame-dragging effect
— two famous predictions generated by Einstein's theory
of general relativity.
Since its launch last year, the probe successfully transi
tioned through three phases: a four-month systems initial
ization and checkout period. 50 weeks of data collection
and a six-week calibration period, for performing tests on
the instruments on board.
"We used very old rule that physicists have learned: if
you're worried about some possible disturbance to the ap
paratus. deliberately make it worse by a known amount."
said Physics Prof. Francis Everitt, principal investigator for
Gravity Probe B.This included increasing the voltage of the
gyroscopes and, for a short period, pointing the telescope at
a different guide star.
This third stage ended on Sept. 1 when the probe ran out
of liquid helium, which refrigerated the gyroscopes and was
used as propellant to maintain the probe's orbit. Although
the instruments on board continue to function, the gradual
increase in temperature will eventually corrupt the meas
urements.

the probe is particularly important

many similar competing theories do

The probe, a collaborative effort

a NASA-funded project from the
1970s that first accurately measured
gravitational redshift.

The Probe's development and
design have been many years in the
making. The basic blueprint for the
experiment was independently in
1959 by two physicists, Leonard
Schiff of Stanford and George Pugh
of MIT. However, neither physicist
published the proposal at the time.

Fairbank. officially proposed the

provide funding in 1963.

1959 by two physicists, Leonard
Schiff of Stanford and George Pugh

The Gravity Probe B project, a satellite-based collabo
rative experiment by Stanford, NASA and the Lockheed-
Martin Corporation, is in the final stage of its quest to iso
late previously unobserved effects predicted by Einstein's
general theory of relativity.
The probe, which was launched at a California Air Force
Base in 2(X)4.has been in orbit for 17 months. It houses four
digitally suspended gyroscopes, which, at an orbit of 4(X)
miles above the Earth, are ultra-stable and free enough
from disturbance to isolate tiny changes in spin that are the
result of the geodetic effect and the frame-dragging effect
— two famous predictions generated by Einstein's theory
of general relativity.
Since its launch last year, the probe successfully transi
tioned through three phases: a four-month systems initial
ization and checkout period. 50 weeks of data collection
and a six-week calibration period, for performing tests on
the instruments on board.
"We used very old rule that physicists have learned: if
you're worried about some possible disturbance to the ap
paratus. deliberately make it worse by a known amount."
said Physics Prof. Francis Everitt, principal investigator for
Gravity Probe B.This included increasing the voltage of the
gyroscopes and, for a short period, pointing the telescope at
a different guide star.
This third stage ended on Sept. 1 when the probe ran out
of liquid helium, which refrigerated the gyroscopes and was
used as propellant to maintain the probe's orbit. Although
the instruments on board continue to function, the gradual
increase in temperature will eventually corrupt the meas
urements.
