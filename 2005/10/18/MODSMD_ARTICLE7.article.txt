## Relief resumes as rains briefly subside

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan
(AP) — A halt in heavy rains yester
day allowed helicopter relief flights
to resume across Pakistan's quake
zone, hut fresh landslides hampered
efforts to move supplies by road. Of
ficials estimated the death toll could
now be more than 54,(XX).
Pakistan said it was willing to ac
cept an offer from rival India to send
helicopters for earthquake relief op
erations, but without Indian pilots.
The nations have fought three wars
since 1947, but India has sent quake
relief aid to its neighbor.
"Pakistan was ... willing to accept
helicopters from India if these were
offered without pilots," the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement. "Given
the obvious sensitivities, we could
not accept involvement of Indian
military on our side for relief opera
tions."
India has sent three relief ship
ments to Pakistan, including 1(X) tons
of high-protein bars, 10 tons each of
medicine and plastic sheeting, as well
as tents and blankets, the Indian For
eign Ministry said. The latest ship
ment was sent in five railroad cars to
the border town of Amritsar.
Eight international medical
teams took off from Muzaffarabad
to outlying villages, as fears grew for
millions of survivors without health
care and shelter in the isolated
mountains of Kashmir, particularly
the thousands of injured who need
medical treatment to ward off infec
tions.
U.S. diplomat Geoffrey Krassy es
timated that about one-fifth of popu
lated areas had yet to be reached.
"There are serious patients with
infected wounds and gangrene," said

Sebastian Nowak of the Internation
al Committee of the Red Cross, after
a team of its doctors landed in
Chekar, about 40 miles east of
Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pak
istan's part of the divided Himalayan
region.
He said about 200 people in the
town had not received any medical
help since the magnitude-7.6 quake
struck Oct. 8, and landing choppers
there was dangerous because des
perate villagers rushed into the land
ing area.
In the isolated Pakistani village of
Kot Gallah, survivors like Malang
Khan could only sit in the rubble of
his home, and wait.
"No army soldier has come here
to help us," said Khan, 45, whose
teenage daughter was killed. "First
we lost people in quake, and now we
will die because of cold and hunger."
Landslides have blocked the road
to the village, and Abdul Ghafoor,
50, said it urgently needed tents, food
and medicine. About 750 of its resi
dents are homeless, and many are
sick, some with broken bones.
He said the earthquake killed
about 40 people in the village, includ
ing his wife and four children, but
bad weather could kill them all.
In the town of Bagh, the bodies of
six soldiers killed when their Mi-17
transport helicopter crashed in bad
weather Saturday were placed into
simple wooden coffins for transport
back to Islamabad.
On the Indian side of Kashmir,
conditions were grim Monday. Tor
rential rain and snow turned roads
into rivers of mud, stranding trucks
loaded with relief supplies for the
worst-affected Uri and Tangdhar
areas, officials said.
Officials on Sunday sharply
raised estimates of the dead. Abdul

Khaliq Wasi, a spokesman for the
local government of Pakistani Kash
mir, said at least 40,000 people died
there, and the toll could go much
higher. Not all the bodies had been
counted and the figure represented
the "closest estimate," he said.
That pushed estimates of the total
death toll to more than 54,000, in
cluding more than 13,000 in Pak
istan's North West Frontier Province

and about 1,350 in the part of divided
Kashmir that India controls.
Confirmation of a final toll will be
difficult because many bodies are
buried beneath rubble. UN. officials
said that, so far, they were adhering
to the Pakistani government's con
firmed casualty toll, which was
39,422.
The United Nations has estimat
ed that 2 million are homeless.

infected wounds and gangrene," said

Sebastian Nowak of the Internation
al Committee of the Red Cross, after
a team of its doctors landed in
Chekar, about 40 miles east of
Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pak
istan's part of the divided Himalayan
region.
He said about 200 people in the
town had not received any medical
help since the magnitude-7.6 quake
struck Oct. 8, and landing choppers
there was dangerous because des
perate villagers rushed into the land
ing area.
In the isolated Pakistani village of
Kot Gallah, survivors like Malang
Khan could only sit in the rubble of
his home, and wait.
"No army soldier has come here
to help us," said Khan, 45, whose
teenage daughter was killed. "First
we lost people in quake, and now we
will die because of cold and hunger."
Landslides have blocked the road
to the village, and Abdul Ghafoor,
50, said it urgently needed tents, food
and medicine. About 750 of its resi
dents are homeless, and many are
sick, some with broken bones.
He said the earthquake killed
about 40 people in the village, includ
ing his wife and four children, but
bad weather could kill them all.
In the town of Bagh, the bodies of
six soldiers killed when their Mi-17
transport helicopter crashed in bad
weather Saturday were placed into
simple wooden coffins for transport
back to Islamabad.
On the Indian side of Kashmir,
conditions were grim Monday. Tor
rential rain and snow turned roads
into rivers of mud, stranding trucks
loaded with relief supplies for the
worst-affected Uri and Tangdhar
areas, officials said.
Officials on Sunday sharply
raised estimates of the dead. Abdul

Khaliq Wasi, a spokesman for the
local government of Pakistani Kash
mir, said at least 40,000 people died
there, and the toll could go much
higher. Not all the bodies had been
counted and the figure represented
the "closest estimate," he said.
That pushed estimates of the total
death toll to more than 54,000, in
cluding more than 13,000 in Pak
istan's North West Frontier Province

and about 1,350 in the part of divided
Kashmir that India controls.
Confirmation of a final toll will be
difficult because many bodies are
buried beneath rubble. UN. officials
said that, so far, they were adhering
to the Pakistani government's con
firmed casualty toll, which was
39,422.
The United Nations has estimat
ed that 2 million are homeless.

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan
(AP) — A halt in heavy rains yester
day allowed helicopter relief flights
to resume across Pakistan's quake
zone, hut fresh landslides hampered
efforts to move supplies by road. Of
ficials estimated the death toll could
now be more than 54,(XX).
Pakistan said it was willing to ac
cept an offer from rival India to send
helicopters for earthquake relief op
erations, but without Indian pilots.
The nations have fought three wars
since 1947, but India has sent quake
relief aid to its neighbor.
"Pakistan was ... willing to accept
helicopters from India if these were
offered without pilots," the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement. "Given
the obvious sensitivities, we could
not accept involvement of Indian
military on our side for relief opera
tions."
India has sent three relief ship
ments to Pakistan, including 1(X) tons
of high-protein bars, 10 tons each of
medicine and plastic sheeting, as well
as tents and blankets, the Indian For
eign Ministry said. The latest ship
ment was sent in five railroad cars to
the border town of Amritsar.
Eight international medical
teams took off from Muzaffarabad
to outlying villages, as fears grew for
millions of survivors without health
care and shelter in the isolated
mountains of Kashmir, particularly
the thousands of injured who need
medical treatment to ward off infec
tions.
U.S. diplomat Geoffrey Krassy es
timated that about one-fifth of popu
lated areas had yet to be reached.
"There are serious patients with
infected wounds and gangrene," said

Sebastian Nowak of the Internation
al Committee of the Red Cross, after
a team of its doctors landed in
Chekar, about 40 miles east of
Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pak
