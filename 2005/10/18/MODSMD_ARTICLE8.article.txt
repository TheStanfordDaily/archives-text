# Iraqi election results to be audited, militants killed

### THOMAS WAGNER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€”
Election workers will audit results
showing unexpected ratios of"yes"
to "no" votes from some parts of
Iraq in the country's landmark ref
erendum on the draft constitution,
officials said yesterday.
The U.S. military said, mean
while, that its warplanes and heli
copters bombed two western vil
lages Sunday, killing an estimated
70 militants near a site where five
American soldiers died in a road
side blast. Residents said at least 39
of the dead were civilians.
Word of the unexpected results
came as Sunni Arab lawmaker Me
shaan al-Jubouri claimed fraud had oc
curred in Saturday's election repeating
earlier comments made by other Sunni
officials over the weekend.
Iraq's Electoral Commission
said numbers from most provinces
"were unusually high according to
the international standards" and so
would "require us to recheck, com
pare and audit them."
The commission said it would
take random samples from some
ballot boxes to check the results.
An official with knowledge of
the election process said that in
some areas the ratio of "yes" to
"no" votes seemed far higher or
lower than would expected.
The official cautioned that it was
too early to say whether the figures
were incorrect or what caused the
unusual results.
The commission and the official
did not say what regions had the cu
rious returns.
Voting was believed to have
been highly polarized between
Sunni Arabs, who largely oppose
the charter, and Shiites and Kurds,
who supported it. The main elec
toral battlegrounds were provinces

with mixed populations, two of
which went strongly "yes."
The province of Diyala. for ex
ample, is believed to have a slight
Sunni Arab majority. But reports
from electoral officials there on
Sunday reported a 70 percent "yes"
vote and a 20 percent "no."
Iraq has not had a census for more
than 15 years, so judgments of the
exact sectarian balance are difficult.
President Bush said Monday
that he was pleased that Sunni
Arabs cast so many ballots.
Asked whether the Sunni vote
would damage the political process
or increase the likelihood of vio
lence, Bush said the increased
turnout was an indication that Iraqis
want to settle disputes peacefully..
" I was pleased to see that the Sun
nis have participated in the process."
Bush said from the Oval Office. "The
idea of deciding to go into a ballot
box is a positive development.
Further delaying the count and
the posting of final results, a sand
storm swept over Baghdad on Mon
day. grounding air travel. Vote tal
lies still have to be flown in from the
provinces, and workers at the cen
tral counting center were still exam
ining results only from the capital
and its outskirts.
Figures reported by elections of
ficials in the provinces to The Asso
ciated Press indicated the constitu
tion appeared to have passed, with
the Sunni Arab attempt to veto it
falling short.
The acceptance of the constitu
tion would be a major step in setting
up a democratic government that
could lead to the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Iraq. But Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice warned
Sunday that violence will continue,
even if the constitution is adopted.
She said support for the insurgency
would eventually wane as the coun
try moves toward democracy.
