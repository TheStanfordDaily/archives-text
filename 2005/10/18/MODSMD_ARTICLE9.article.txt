## Wikipedia is wicked cool 
### 
The time has come to buckle down and
hit the books. But before you start
writing your next research paper,
make sure you are familiar with the best free
information resources on the Web that will
make your background work easier.
The Wiki Way
Your first stop for any kind of research
should always be Wikipedia, the Internet's
free, ever-evolving encyclopedia of every
thing, located at http://www.wikipedia.org.
Similar in philosophy to the clothing brand
Fubu, Wikipedia is written for Internet users
by Internet users. As a result.it often has just
what you're looking for in a down-to-earth
language that gets to the point in a hurry.
Wikipedia is especially useful as a start
ing point for broader research. Each article
touches briefly on all aspects of a topic and
includes links to primary sources. In the past,
I've used Wikipedia as a launch-pad for
studying classical Roman legal texts and the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty â€” and to
learn about Phoebe's eating habits on
Friends (she's a vegetarian but eats ham
burgers when depressed).
Furthermore, if Wikipedia ever lacks
some crucial nugget of information, simply
find it elsewhere and add it yourself. On
Wikipedia, sharing is caring.
Research for Idiots (or Legislators)
Specific fields have their own sites that
serve as reliable fountainheads on your
quest for research. If you're interested in
current international affairs, visit the Coun
cil on Foreign Relations home page at
http://cfr.org.
In addition to publishing the journal
"Foreign Affairs," the Council on Foreign
Relations maintains a staff of expert re
searchers who post short, easy to understand
synopses of global issues by region and
topic. They also provide useful background
on the news in a simple Q&A format with
articles such as "Why Don't Sunnis Support
the Iraqi Constitution?"
For government secrecy and military af
fairs, see the Federation of American Scien
tists homepage, http://www.fas.org. Created
by former Manhattan Project scientists, the
FAS keeps tabs on governments and mili
taries around the globe. They post sum
maries, statistics and declassified documents
by topic and region. Need to know the range
of the stinger missiles we gave to Osama bin
Laden in the 80s? The FAS will tell you: one
to eight kilometers.
The FAS also keeps one of the best free
repositories of formerly classified and ob
scure documents, including the Library of
Congress's Congressional Research Service
reports (CRS) reports. CRS reports are writ
ten by non-partisan government researchers
to help Congress understand complex do
mestic and foreign issues.
And since they are written for congressmen,
they don't use big words. They also come with
cute titles like "Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy
Responses." Normally hidden from the public,
the FAS posts them free for anyone to view.
"Fate is defined a5..."
Anyone who writes an English paper will
benefit from the vast number of free full-text
classics online. Sites such as Project Guten
berg, http://gutenberg.org, and University of
Pennsylvania Online Books, http://online
books.library.upenn.edu/, house tens of
thousands of classics whose copyrights have
long since expired.
Instead of rereading Madame Bovary to
find passages with weather imagery, you can
let your computer do the work for you. Load
the book on your browser, hit Control-F and
find each instance of the word "cloud." Same
result, much less effort.
And for those cheesy intros to essays,
steer your fate with the direction of the Ox
ford English Dictionary Online. Students
living on campus have free access to the full
text of the dictionary at http://oed.com,
which traces the history and use of words
over centuries.
A Techie's Delight
Even mathematicians can benefit from
online resources. Wolfram Research, Inc.
maintains a large amalgam of technical re
sources specifically designed for the math
and sciences. Its mathematics site,
http://mathworld.wolfram.com, explains
concepts of proofs and functions in detail.
Furthermore, Wolfram provides an on
line integrator to symbolically solve nasty
integrals at http://integrals.wolfram.com.
This is a must for completing late-night
problem sets.
So be you techie or fuzzy, save yourself
some trouble. Let the Web take the legwork
out of your school work.
