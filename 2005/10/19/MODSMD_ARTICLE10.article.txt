# College students more dependent on tuition loans
## 
### JUSTIN POPE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) — Price increases at colleges and
universities moderated somewhat this year,
but students who need financial aid are still re
lying increasingly on loans to pay for higher
education, according to figures released Tues
day by the College Board.
The average cost of tuition and fees at a
four-year college hit $5,491 this year, up 7.1
percent from 2004-2005, according to the an
nual survey by the nonprofit group. That was
the smallest percentage increase since 2001-
2002.
Prices at two-year public colleges rose 5.4
percent to $2,191 .while at private schools they
rose 5.9 percent to $21,235.
The increases are below levels seen in re
cent years; last year, prices at public four-year
schools rose about 10 percent, and 13 percent
the year before that. But the cost hikes are still
well above the general inflation rate.
And while many students don't pay the full
"list price," other figures released Tuesday in
dicate student aid is not keeping up with need.
Student aid from the government and
other sources did increase $10 billion to $129
billion in 2004-05, the last year for which aid
figures are available. For the third straight
year, more of the increase came in the form of
loans than from grants, which students do not
have to pay back.
That isn't necessarily a big problem for
many families. Interest rates are low, and the
increased earning power of a college degree is
generally worth the average debt for under
graduate borrowers. It is likely to compound
concerns that families on the margins of being
able to afford college are being priced out.
Including charges for room and board as
well as tuition and fees, costs at public four
year schools rose 6.6 percent to an average of
$11,376. At private four-year nonprofit
schools, they rose 5.7 percent to $27,465.
