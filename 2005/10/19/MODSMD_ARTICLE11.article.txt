## Throw a killer dinner party: How to be social, part I 
### NAVIN SIVANANDAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ah, the fools. They've given me more space in The
Daily. And not only that, I get to write about my ninth
(the other eight will certainly come up in the near fu
ture) favorite subject — the art of eating.
Eating is something that people generally do very
badly. Whilst I am not certain about exactly why this is,
I do intend to take a few steps toward fixing the prob
lem. More about that momentarily. First, though, let's
find out what we mean by bad.
Eating should never be about mere survival. Food is
not there for sustenance alone. Food is an art. Well per
haps not an art, but at least a craft — both its produc
tion and consumption are finely-tuned skills that few
people bother to develop.
At its highest level, a meal is truly beautiful thing. It's
carefully built so that each course is a new stage on a
journey. Each plate laid in front you provides a new vista
onto previously untouched horizons, un-traveled lands.
What's more, every bite should be an adventure.
Every sense should come into play, elevating a single

morsel into a full experience.
Many people stretch this

sort thing pretty far, using
food as a metaphor for

life.They're wrong. Life is
inadequate. It's con
strained by reality. If any
thing, life is a metaphor

for food (well,
for art in gen
eral) — things

that actually exist

are the poor cousins

of our ideals.
Great, having

gotten the spiel out of the way, we can now get down to
business. The point of the previous half dozen para
graphs is to convince you that when it comes to food
and cooking, I care. And, partly because I care, I'm
pretty good in the kitchen, so maybe you can pick
something up from my musings on the subject.
On the other hand, I don't really want to write a se
ries of articles on how to cook some particular thing,
each complete with a selection of recipes. This is be
cause, well, it's boring and that sort of thing is done
much better elsewhere. There are many more great
cookbooks in the world than you're ever likely to need.
What's more, they are adorned with glossy color pho
tos, and I can't provide that sort of mouth-watering
lead-in.
Instead, I thought I'd (mostly) restrict myself to
entertaining. A vaunted area in the world of food, the
art of entertaining is sadly neglected among our
peers. So I thought that we could perhaps explore
this branch of the arte de cuisine together — a se
quence of dinner parties will give us something to
upon which to hang our recipes and place the cook
ing in context.
Sadly, many folks seem intimidated by the thought
of hosting a dinner party. There's a widespread fear
that everything will go horribly wrong if you try to
cook for anyone other than yourself.
The apprehension exists, in part, because things do
go horribly wrong from time to time. I'll deal with that
particular problem at a later date. For today, I want to
focus on something else.
People don't really care about the food when they
come round for dinner. They care about the company.
This has two consequences. The first is that it doesn't
matter if you completely louse everything up...just
make sure you do it in style. Second, you'll have to
work all the harder to showcase your mastery.
Anyway, here's the plan to help you develop the
aforementioned mastery. Every couple of weeks (or
so) I'll entertain and then I'll share with you the food,
the conversation and how to put it all together. In re
turn for all this, though. I do need a little help from
you.
Eventually (well actually, pretty soon), I will run out
of interesting people to have over. And rather than just
cycle through my friends time after time, I though that
perhaps we could make the whole experience more in
teractive — not only can you read about the food, but
you come over and join the party.
On that note, 1 suppose I should sign off. I have cou
ple recipes to research for dinner number one. Watch
this space.
