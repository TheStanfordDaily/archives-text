# TAs stay on top of their game, evade student ennui
## 
### MOLLY ROBERTS 
Ask undergraduates why they think
graduate students work as teaching as
sistants (TAs) and they will probably
answer,"Either because they have to or
because they get paid — who else
would volunteer to hold section on Fri
day morning?"
But ask communication doctoral stu
dent and TA Lise Marken, and she will
attribute her motivation to teach to the
social contact she has with her students.
"I can help people understand some
thing I'm really excited about and care
about," Marken says."lt's nice to be able
to share something that I've put so much
time and energy into. Being a grad stu
dent can be very solitary, so TAing is a
chance to interact."
Of course, some graduate students
say they TA because it is required to
qualify fora doctoral degree. A large
portion of graduate students also say
they TA voluntarily as a way to pay tu
ition or to gain teaching experience if
they plan on becoming a professor.
"There is part of me that prefers
TAing to my work, so it's tempting to
spend too much time on TAing,"
Marken says.
Unfortunately, even these enthusias
tic TAs run into problems in the class
room, especially because they are so in
vested in their subjects.
"When students don't care it breaks
my heart," Marken says. " Trying to make
them care is part of the challenge."
Recently, a group of graduate stu
dents attended a Center for Teaching
and Learning workshop aimed at identi
fying these kinds of classroom chal
lenges and devising strategies to deal

with them. Under the instruction of
Marcelo Clerici-Arias, associate direc
tor of the Center for Teaching and
Learning, the TAs brainstormed the ob
stacles they had encountered. Here's the
run-down of solutions to the kinds of is
sues that can make sections — which
should be exciting and interactive —
less than perfect.
Add Some Variety
Most TAs agree that the most com
mon problem in classrooms is uneven
participation and lack of student moti
vation. One group of TAs stressed the
awkward silence that follows a question
to the group, where minutes can go by
without any voices raising to answer.
Clerici-Arias encourages the TAs to
vary in-class activities by planning class
presentations or breaking students into
discussion groups.
"Students must take control of their
own participation," he says. "But if TAs
can do something to make it more inter
esting, something to fit their students'
learning style, it would make section
better and more helpful."
Clerici-Arias also emphasizes the im
portance of being flexible if a TA's at
tempts to facilitate rewarding sections
aren't working well. lie encourages TAs
to come to section with various activities
in mind so they can switch easily if the
classroom aura stagnates.
Quiet Those
Dominant Students
Many TAs complain of over-achiev
ing students' tendency to dominate

classroom discussions, leaving no room
for others to jump in.
ITie Center for Teaching and Learn
ing suggests giving overly outspoken
students a specific role in the classroom
in order to fill their need for attention
but not discourage their passion for the
subject.
" Fry not to shut them out." Clerici-
Arias explains. "You'll lose them as a re
source."
At the same time, many of the TAs
who attended the workshop say they be
lieve it is important to create strategies
that will bring out the more quiet stu
dents in the class.They agree that mak
ing the classroom less intimidating and
comfortable for these students will help
encourage their participation.
Rock Your First Section
Clerici-Arias says that one of the best
pieces of advice he can give to TAs is to
set high standards from the beginning.
"The first section is the most impor
tant," Clerici-Arias comments. "First,
TAs must prepare well in advance and
practice in front of other people to get
feedback. Second, they must invest
some time of that first section in creat
ing a comfortable and safe place for
everyone in the class. That kind of small
investment will have lasting conse
quences for the rest of the quarter."
Indeed, creating a sense of commu
nity in sections is a must. Clerici-Arias
advises TAs to use the first 15 to 20 min
utes of the first section to get acquaint
ed with the students. This can help the
students build trust with their TAs and
create a more positive learning envi
ronment.

Of course, some graduate students
say they TA because it is required to
qualify fora doctoral degree. A large
portion of graduate students also say
they TA voluntarily as a way to pay tu
ition or to gain teaching experience if
they plan on becoming a professor.
"There is part of me that prefers
TAing to my work, so it's tempting to
spend too much time on TAing,"
Marken says.
Unfortunately, even these enthusias
tic TAs run into problems in the class
room, especially because they are so in
vested in their subjects.
"When students don't care it breaks
my heart," Marken says. " Trying to make
them care is part of the challenge."
Recently, a group of graduate stu
dents attended a Center for Teaching
and Learning workshop aimed at identi
fying these kinds of classroom chal
lenges and devising strategies to deal

with them. Under the instruction of
Marcelo Clerici-Arias, associate direc
tor of the Center for Teaching and
Learning, the TAs brainstormed the ob
stacles they had encountered. Here's the
run-down of solutions to the kinds of is
sues that can make sections — which
should be exciting and interactive —
less than perfect.
Add Some Variety
Most TAs agree that the most com
mon problem in classrooms is uneven
participation and lack of student moti
vation. One group of TAs stressed the
awkward silence that follows a question
to the group, where minutes can go by
without any voices raising to answer.
Clerici-Arias encourages the TAs to
vary in-class activities by planning class
presentations or breaking students into
discussion groups.
"Students must take control of their
own participation," he says. "But if TAs
can do something to make it more inter
esting, something to fit their students'
learning style, it would make section
better and more helpful."
Clerici-Arias also emphasizes the im
portance of being flexible if a TA's at
tempts to facilitate rewarding sections
aren't working well. lie encourages TAs
to come to section with various activities
in mind so they can switch easily if the
classroom aura stagnates.
Quiet Those
Dominant Students
Many TAs complain of over-achiev
ing students' tendency to dominate

classroom discussions, leaving no room
for others to jump in.
ITie Center for Teaching and Learn
ing suggests giving overly outspoken
students a specific role in the classroom
in order to fill their need for attention
but not discourage their passion for the
subject.
" Fry not to shut them out." Clerici-
Arias explains. "You'll lose them as a re
source."
At the same time, many of the TAs
who attended the workshop say they be
lieve it is important to create strategies
that will bring out the more quiet stu
dents in the class.They agree that mak
ing the classroom less intimidating and
comfortable for these students will help
encourage their participation.
Rock Your First Section
Clerici-Arias says that one of the best
pieces of advice he can give to TAs is to
set high standards from the beginning.
"The first section is the most impor
tant," Clerici-Arias comments. "First,
TAs must prepare well in advance and
practice in front of other people to get
feedback. Second, they must invest
some time of that first section in creat
ing a comfortable and safe place for
everyone in the class. That kind of small
investment will have lasting conse
quences for the rest of the quarter."
Indeed, creating a sense of commu
nity in sections is a must. Clerici-Arias
advises TAs to use the first 15 to 20 min
utes of the first section to get acquaint
ed with the students. This can help the
students build trust with their TAs and
create a more positive learning envi
ronment.

Ask undergraduates why they think
graduate students work as teaching as
sistants (TAs) and they will probably
answer,"Either because they have to or
because they get paid — who else
would volunteer to hold section on Fri
day morning?"
But ask communication doctoral stu
dent and TA Lise Marken, and she will
attribute her motivation to teach to the
social contact she has with her students.
"I can help people understand some
thing I'm really excited about and care
about," Marken says."lt's nice to be able
to share something that I've put so much
time and energy into. Being a grad stu
dent can be very solitary, so TAing is a
chance to interact."
