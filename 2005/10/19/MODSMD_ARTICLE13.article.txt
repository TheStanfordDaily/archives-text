# ABOUT THE CTL
## 
### 
Clerici-Arias is part of the Stan
ford Center for Teaching and
Learning (CTL), which provides
teaching workshops for faculty
and TAs throughout the year.
For TAs, the CTL offers gen
eral introductory workshops,
specific skills workshops and
one-on-one consultations. CTL
advisers also videotape TAs in
classroom simulations and pro
vide them with feedback.
In addition, individual depart
ments train their own TAs with
strategies specific to the subject.
This quarter, the CTL will offer
four more workshops for TAs as
piring to go into teaching.
There will be Tbaching Portfo
lio workshops on Oct. 18 and 25
and on Nov. 1, as well as a discus
sion about starting on a faculty ca
reer path on Nov. 9. For more in

When asked if she thinks
Stanford effectively trains TAs,
Marken applauds the Center and
the workshop for the abundance
of resources they provide.
"The only problem is finding
the time to take advantage of the
resources available," she says.
