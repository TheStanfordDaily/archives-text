# Chicken pot pie of loneliness
## 
### 
It is with great sadness that I write
about the fact that over the summer
Palo Alto lost one of its finest eating
establishments. Want a light afternoon
snack of mashed potatoes and gravy?
Too bad. Had your heart set on a Styro
foam dish of radioactively-glowing mac
aroni and cheese? Tough luck. Ready to
sink your teeth into a bucket-sized feast
of fried bird parts? Well, you can no
longer find them in Extra Crispy, Hot and
Spicy or Original Recipe.
News that the Palo Alto K.FC had
closed hit me as a VTA bus almost hit me
while I stood straddling my bike in the
median of El Camino Real. I was para
lyzed in a chicken-wing-starved state of
disbelief as I looked upon the closed
storefront where a life-sized statue of
Colonel Harland Sanders once stood
proudly in the window. Rejected and
famished, I turned around and settled

for a Jumbo Jack with cheese, seasoned
curly fries and a small Diet Coke from
the hole-in-the-wall across the street.
Finger-lickin' good? More like fingcr
lickin' sad.
It was then that my chicken-pot-pie of
loneliness began to bake. I found myself
feeling lost, biscuit-less and searching for
spice in an otherwise flavorless world.
Occasionally I would find a place with
decent potato wedges, the occasional
barbeque buffalo wing or a fluke pop

corn chicken joint. But it just wasn't the
same. There was no corn on my cob or
cole in my slaw. Eventually I came to the
realization that I had taken the Colonel
— and his secret recipe featuring a
unique blend of 11 herbs and spices —
for granted.
Much like a hot ex-boyfriend of mine
on the Columbia University swim team. I
didn't know what I had until it was gone.
While I admit to having a weakness for
men in uniform, my relationship with the
Colonel went far beyond a one night
chicken stand. It wasn't all about the
grease, the skin or the sloppy seconds.
With the colonel, it was about depend
ability, kindness and warm apple pie. I've
heard rumors that he's feeding guys (and
girls) down in Mountain View, or up in
Redwood City, but to me, Palo Alto does
n't feel the same without him.
Like any relationship. I've come to re

alize that there are things about people
and restaurants that change over time.
When 1 got back to Stanford this year, I
had to come to terms with the fact that
most of my friends from the previous
year had graduated, left me and had
moved on to high-paying jobs. Mean
while, I came back to camps, moved into
my spacious Escondido Village single
person studio and couldn't figure out
why making friends was suddenly so dif
ficult this time around. It's awkward
being 25-years-old, single and without
much of a social network. Naturally, I've
wondered, "Am I the only person that
feels this way?"
ITien the other day 1 had a casual con
versation with some of the students in my
program and one of them remarked on
how devastated she was at the sudden
disappearance of the Palo Alto KFC. She
went on to recall that she couldn't think

of any fast food places to get fried chick
en, forcing her to go to traditional restau
rants instead. Suddenly it occurred to me
that the disappearance of Colonel
Sanders might be a good thing. Even
though things will never be the same,
restaurant doors have opened for other
hot dishes to make their way into my life.
I admit that the "chicken-pot-pie of
loneliness" metaphor might have been a
little bit of an exaggeration, but it's true
that I will miss Colonel Sanders among
the many delicious friends I made last
year. But there are times when a lack of
comfort and convenience makes way for
opportunity and exploration. We all miss
our old friends, but making new ones can
be a good recipe, even if it takes a while
to cook.

ITien the other day 1 had a casual con
versation with some of the students in my
program and one of them remarked on
how devastated she was at the sudden
disappearance of the Palo Alto KFC. She
went on to recall that she couldn't think

that the disappearance of Colonel
Sanders might be a good thing. Even
though things will never be the same,
restaurant doors have opened for other
hot dishes to make their way into my life.
I admit that the "chicken-pot-pie of
loneliness" metaphor might have been a
little bit of an exaggeration, but it's true
that I will miss Colonel Sanders among
the many delicious friends I made last
year. But there are times when a lack of
comfort and convenience makes way for
opportunity and exploration. We all miss
our old friends, but making new ones can
be a good recipe, even if it takes a while
to cook.

It is with great sadness that I write
about the fact that over the summer
Palo Alto lost one of its finest eating
establishments. Want a light afternoon
snack of mashed potatoes and gravy?
Too bad. Had your heart set on a Styro
foam dish of radioactively-glowing mac
aroni and cheese? Tough luck. Ready to
sink your teeth into a bucket-sized feast
of fried bird parts? Well, you can no
longer find them in Extra Crispy, Hot and
Spicy or Original Recipe.
News that the Palo Alto K.FC had
closed hit me as a VTA bus almost hit me
while I stood straddling my bike in the
median of El Camino Real. I was para
lyzed in a chicken-wing-starved state of
disbelief as I looked upon the closed
storefront where a life-sized statue of
Colonel Harland Sanders once stood
proudly in the window. Rejected and
famished, I turned around and settled

for a Jumbo Jack with cheese, seasoned
curly fries and a small Diet Coke from
the hole-in-the-wall across the street.
Finger-lickin' good? More like fingcr
lickin' sad.
It was then that my chicken-pot-pie of
loneliness began to bake. I found myself
feeling lost, biscuit-less and searching for
spice in an otherwise flavorless world.
Occasionally I would find a place with
decent potato wedges, the occasional
barbeque buffalo wing or a fluke pop

corn chicken joint. But it just wasn't the
same. There was no corn on my cob or
cole in my slaw. Eventually I came to the
realization that I had taken the Colonel
— and his secret recipe featuring a
unique blend of 11 herbs and spices —
for granted.
Much like a hot ex-boyfriend of mine
on the Columbia University swim team. I
didn't know what I had until it was gone.
While I admit to having a weakness for
men in uniform, my relationship with the
Colonel went far beyond a one night
chicken stand. It wasn't all about the
grease, the skin or the sloppy seconds.
With the colonel, it was about depend
ability, kindness and warm apple pie. I've
heard rumors that he's feeding guys (and
girls) down in Mountain View, or up in
Redwood City, but to me, Palo Alto does
n't feel the same without him.
Like any relationship. I've come to re

alize that there are things about people
and restaurants that change over time.
When 1 got back to Stanford this year, I
had to come to terms with the fact that
most of my friends from the previous
year had graduated, left me and had
moved on to high-paying jobs. Mean
while, I came back to camps, moved into
my spacious Escondido Village single
person studio and couldn't figure out
why making friends was suddenly so dif
ficult this time around. It's awkward
being 25-years-old, single and without
much of a social network. Naturally, I've
wondered, "Am I the only person that
feels this way?"
