## Editorial Online lotteries better than lunch-hour lines

Short of a last-minute change, less than
three-quarters of Stanford would have
been able to attend the upcoming
events held with His Holiness the Dalai
Lama. Last spring, students from the classes
of 2006,2007 and 2008 and continuing grad
uate students were invited to get up early
and wait in line for the opportunity to pur
chase a ticket to an event with the Dalai
Lama on Nov. 4 or 5. But, since they weren't
here, new graduate students, freshmen and
those off campus last spring never had a
chance to purchase tickets. Recently, Stan
ford decided to offer all current Stanford
students unable to obtain tickets the chance
to enter a computer raffle fora small num
ber of extra tickets. We believe that this deci
sion was correct and in the best interests of
the entire Stanford community. We also
think that this computerized raffle system
offers the University a rtew, better and more
equitable way to distribute tickets to high
demand speakers that should be continued
in the future.
Currently, tickets are distributed at tables
in White Plaza or through the ticket office in
IYesidder in the weeks prior to an event.This
method of distribution is both inefficient.

wasting students' time standing in line, and
inequitable in its bias towards students who
are on campus and who have free time
around lunch hour. While current policy
often allows students to get tickets fora sin
gle friend, this is not enough. To allow all
members of the Stanford community access
to highly-coveted events, tickets should be
distributed through an online raffle system.
We admit that a move to an online system
might be difficult. Students may be more
likely to request tickets for events that they
are not really interested in attending and
might leave their seats empty, give tickets to
friends or sell their tickets. These problems
could be curtailed by requiring students to
pick up tickets a week in advance of an event
and by printing or writing students' SUID
numbers on tickets. Students failing to pick
up tickets could be disqualified from submit
ting their name fora specified number of fu
ture events and extra tickets could be made
available to students on a first-come, first
serve basis at the event.
At the least, Stanford should evaluate the
success of the Dalai Lama ticket distribution
and strongly consider a move to ticket distri
bution via an online system.
