# Introsem apps should be moved to summer
## 
### 
It's your third day as a freshman. You
haven't moved all your stuff into your
room, everyone around you is new, the
resident assistants are running you all over
to New Student Orientation (NSO) events,
and you know that, eventually, you need to
pick classes. And then you're told you
should definitely apply to an introsem. Three
seminars really interest you and, somehow,
you find the time to apply to each on a clus
ter computer (your computer either hasn't
come yet or, if it has, it doesn't have Internet
access). When you meet with your academ
ic advisor and peer mentor, you try to plan
out classes, but everything is contingent
upon your acceptance into the seminars you
applied for.
Introductory Seminars are a highlight of
the freshman and sophomore experience,
and the classes have done an excellent job
connecting Stanford faculty to new under
graduates through small, group discus
sions. But, at least in the fall quarter, the
application for introsems is poorly timed to

coincide with the middle of New Student
Orientation. With moving in, meeting
one's roommate, making new friends and
going to various activities, freshmen are
given little time to fill out the introsem ap
plications.
To relieve this stress during NSO and to
give freshman a better idea of their potential
schedule when they arrive at Stanford, the
Office of Freshman and Sophomore Pro
grams should move both the opening and
closing dates for introsem applications to the
late summer. Freshmen should be required
to apply for introsems while still relaxing at
home and should be given their acceptance
status either before or shortly after they ar
rive at Stanford, much like IHUM and PWR.
Fall seminars are already extremely popular,
and if uncertainty or technical problems
stymie a few students, paper applications can
be a backup. Such a policy would give fresh
men the opportunity to better plan their
schedules with their advisers and to enjoy the
craziness and new surroundings of NSO.
