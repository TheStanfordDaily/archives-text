# Kangaroo meat, open bars and other GSB myths
## 
### 
This past Friday, I decided to stick
around campus and visit some non-
GSB friends. A little warm from some
early evening Beirut, I occasionally flagged
down 5-SURE to get myself around. But the
evening was a little more sobering than I had
originally planned. Much to my dismay,
every non-GSBer I encountered — ranging
from the law students we played in Beirut to
the undergrads carting me around — asked
exactly the same question, "So, is what they
say about the GSB true?"
To respond to this, I'd begin by feigning
ignorance: "What do you mean? What do
they say?"
And they'd come back with some general
depiction of excess.
"You know, that it's a two-year vacation,
that you guys just drink beer and eat kanga
roo at ludicrously expensive networking
events."
I would then process and internalize the
remark: Kangaroo is tender and succulent...
We should have more kangaroo at the GSB.
But then, more diplomatically, I would
offer up an ambiguous response: "Oh, it's got
its rough patches in terms of work, but we
like to have fun. Work hard, play hard." The
conversation would then fizzle, their curiosi
ty largely unsatisfied.
Having recently graduated from Stan
ford as an undergrad and recalling this sup
posed reputation myself, I feel it's time to
clear the air. To discuss the truth and myth
behind the GSB.
The "reputation" is three-part. People
believe a) the GSB is easy,because business,
whatever the hell that means, is easy; b) the
GSB is rich and uses these resources to cod
dle its precious future donors with innumer
able "amenities;" and c) GSBers are the
soulless vanguards of capitalism and just
want money.
All three notions are mostly myth. Let's

take them 011 one at a time.
A. The GSB is easy
The GSB. like many graduate programs,
is flexible. You can get what you want out of
it. There are people who work on academics
constantly, literally constantly, and others
who find a way to coast. Regardless of effort
level, there is an extraordinarily strict class
attendance policy, and a constant assessment
that occurs through cold calls in class and
weekly assignments. This quarter we have
five classes, more than I ever took as an un
dergrad — and four of them are quantita
tive or technical. I'm not going to cry you a
river because the pass-fail nature of the GSB
provides the ability to choose a personal
work-life balance, but I will tell you that I
know J.D.s who have complained that the
GSB is more work than law school was.
B. GSBers party and network constantly
1 can't complain. After all, we have a
Hiesday bar night every week and free food
and an open bar every Friday evening.
There's admittedly a lot of networking
events, speaking events, etc.... Clubs subsi
dized by the GSB routinely throw barbecues
with free alcohol so that we can get to know
alumni in various industries. These events
could not occur, though, without students
taking the necessary initiative, and business
is really about bringing the right people to
gether, at the right time, to build the right
