# Kangaroo meat, open bars and other GSB myths
## 
### 
This past Friday, I decided to stick
around campus and visit some non-
GSB friends. A little warm from some
early evening Beirut, I occasionally flagged
down 5-SURE to get myself around. But the
evening was a little more sobering than I had
originally planned. Much to my dismay,
every non-GSBer I encountered — ranging
from the law students we played in Beirut to
the undergrads carting me around — asked
exactly the same question, "So, is what they
say about the GSB true?"
To respond to this, I'd begin by feigning
ignorance: "What do you mean? What do
they say?"
And they'd come back with some general
depiction of excess.
"You know, that it's a two-year vacation,
that you guys just drink beer and eat kanga
roo at ludicrously expensive networking
events."
I would then process and internalize the
remark: Kangaroo is tender and succulent...
We should have more kangaroo at the GSB.
But then, more diplomatically, I would
offer up an ambiguous response: "Oh, it's got
its rough patches in terms of work, but we
like to have fun. Work hard, play hard." The
conversation would then fizzle, their curiosi
ty largely unsatisfied.
Having recently graduated from Stan
ford as an undergrad and recalling this sup
posed reputation myself, I feel it's time to
clear the air. To discuss the truth and myth
behind the GSB.
The "reputation" is three-part. People
believe a) the GSB is easy,because business,
whatever the hell that means, is easy; b) the
GSB is rich and uses these resources to cod
dle its precious future donors with innumer
able "amenities;" and c) GSBers are the
soulless vanguards of capitalism and just
want money.
All three notions are mostly myth. Let's

take them 011 one at a time.
A. The GSB is easy
The GSB. like many graduate programs,
is flexible. You can get what you want out of
it. There are people who work on academics
constantly, literally constantly, and others
who find a way to coast. Regardless of effort
level, there is an extraordinarily strict class
attendance policy, and a constant assessment
that occurs through cold calls in class and
weekly assignments. This quarter we have
five classes, more than I ever took as an un
dergrad — and four of them are quantita
tive or technical. I'm not going to cry you a
river because the pass-fail nature of the GSB
provides the ability to choose a personal
work-life balance, but I will tell you that I
know J.D.s who have complained that the
GSB is more work than law school was.
B. GSBers party and network constantly
1 can't complain. After all, we have a
Hiesday bar night every week and free food
and an open bar every Friday evening.
There's admittedly a lot of networking
events, speaking events, etc.... Clubs subsi
dized by the GSB routinely throw barbecues
with free alcohol so that we can get to know
alumni in various industries. These events
could not occur, though, without students
taking the necessary initiative, and business
is really about bringing the right people to
gether, at the right time, to build the right

thing. Networking is an important el
ement of business and organization,
and it's not surprising that we have
many formal or impromptu parties
and gatherings as a result.
But keep in mind that we don't
have a carte blanche party pass at
the GSB. We suffer the wrath of the
recently-installed University
Gestapo just as much as the next guy.
Stanford security patrols Schwab
throughout the night, moving sys
tematically through the halls like a
brooding Death Star. They eradicate
every peep of fun and ounce of
devil's brew they encounter past a
certain hour. They sometimes call
the cops in response to unregistered
drinking, and they have broken up
parties numerous times. The treat
ment is stricter than what I experi
enced as an undergrad, which is iron
ic given the typical GSBer is around
27 years old.
C. GSBers just want money
I've met countless GSBers who
passionately believe that the effi
cient organization of people and re
sources can bring untold value to so
ciety. Many of these people plan to
serve in non-profit or public service
roles, and others believe they can
bring that value to the private sector
as well. My class has doctors, lawyers,
engineers. Navy Seals, non-profit

and public service workers, Rhodes
and Marshall Scholars and people
from a host of other backgrounds.
Many of them have noble goals, such
as administering a hospital, starting
the next Google, running for state
senate or what-have-you. In other
words, not everybody at the GSB
hisses "McKinsey" when asked
about their future.
That being said, I have met a hand
ful of people who really do just want
money — some of them because it
aligns with a rather convenient per
sonal philosophy of libertarianism,
and others because they've just seen
way too many episodes of "MTV
Cribs." It is, after all. business school.
But in large part, GSBers just want to
make the world a better place.
So don't necessarily believe what
you hear about the GSB.The reputa
tion is mostly myth. The next time
you hear chatter about a GSB event
as you cruise past our building, just
remember that we're actually inter
ested in business and may even be
talking about it.That, or the commu
nal villa in Tahoe. We need our fun
too.
