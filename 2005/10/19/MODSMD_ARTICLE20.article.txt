# Full Moon from the outside
## 
### 
I've long been an admirer of Tom Wolfe.
This is not a result of his writing (excel
lent), his social commentary (simplified,
but witty and poignant) or his incredible abil
ity to recycle the same plot and characters in
three separate novels (though I suppose a
triple 500-page-plus variation on a theme is
an achievement of sorts).
No, I admire the man because by the sim
ple act of donning his white suit he managed
to spend quality time "researching" his latest
work (last year's "I am Charlotte Simmons")
by hanging out with (presumably nubile)
young folk at colleges all over the country.
The man is over 70 and yet no accusations
of sketchiness are flung his way when he goes
off gallivanting with kids over half a century
younger.
Having heard this tale some months ago, I
decided that perhaps all I needed to do was
dress appropriately, pick up some kind of
journalistic cover story and I would be free to
party with the youth of today.
So, on Monday night, I finally screwed my
courage to the sticking-place, donned my
linen jacket (not quite a white suit, but close
enough), put on my journalist hat (of course
it is a point of some debate whether these
weekly scribblings count as journalism) and
headed down to Full Moon on the Quad.
Sadly, I was not mistaken fora world
renowned writer. In fact, I wasn't mistaken
for anything — apparently linen jacket
screams grad student. And grad students,
well we don't belong.
Of course, I didn't expect to belong. After
all, campus is pretty much enemy territory

(well hostile waters at least). Wherever one
goes, as a grad student it's hard to escape the
feeling that the undergrads own the place
and you're there on their sufferance.
Worse, it appears that I achieved consid
erably more recognition as a head TA (two
greetings) or a fellow French student (one
giggle) than as a Daily columnist (nada).This
is particularly upsetting as 1 had been operat
ing on the assumption that I had legions of
adoring fans out amongst the proles. Sadly,
though, it appears it's just you and I, dear
reader. [Sob]
But enough moping. Let me instead share
my impressions of Monday's moonlit
shenanigans. After all, I have to keep up the
journalist act if this trick is ever going to
work.
First off, while there were certainly
shenanigans, 1 couldn't help feeling just a lit
tle let down. Despite the promise of an un
usual odour (a solid background of stale
sweat with heavy overtones of mouthwash,
the firm support of booze-laden breath, oc
casional whiffs of excess perfume and, for
reasons I couldn't understand, the faintest
hint of sulphur) the night did not produce

anything resembling an orgy.
Personally, I blame the somewhat monas
tic Absolute "Fun" faction that apparently
controls the Full Moon festivities. Clearly
this is an evening when you should be plying
people with liquor (hell that's true of most
evenings); if you're going to regret it in the
morning you may as well have an excuse.
Actually, aside from the whole alcohol
thing, I was very impressed with the organi
zation. Where else but Stanford could you
find a decades-old tradition enacted with a
stage, full power PA system and video
screens? Only the slogan was missing: "Free
love on the Farm — it's orderly."
Maybe that was a shade facetious. On bal
ance, it was abundantly clear that I didn't fit
in on the Quad. Perhaps from the outside
these Stanford traditions don't really work
— I mean every time I try and explain punt
ing (Google it) to people who never experi
enced the Cambridge bubble they look at me
as if I'm crazy.
The problem with that line of thought,
however, is that you pretty soon start to miss
what you used to be: an insider. Instead of en
gaging with the crowds at events like Mon
day's you're left doing nothing more than
looking on with a faint air of amusement.
And all the fun and excitement is stuck on
the other side of the looking glass.

Recognize the photo? Boost my ego by saying
hello the next time you see me on the street. Al
ternatively, e-mail navins@stanford.edu and
tell me how to make people love me for whom
I'm pretending to be.

decided that perhaps all I needed to do was
dress appropriately, pick up some kind of
journalistic cover story and I would be free to
party with the youth of today.
So, on Monday night, I finally screwed my
courage to the sticking-place, donned my
linen jacket (not quite a white suit, but close
enough), put on my journalist hat (of course
it is a point of some debate whether these
weekly scribblings count as journalism) and
headed down to Full Moon on the Quad.
Sadly, I was not mistaken fora world
renowned writer. In fact, I wasn't mistaken
for anything — apparently linen jacket
screams grad student. And grad students,
well we don't belong.
Of course, I didn't expect to belong. After
all, campus is pretty much enemy territory

(well hostile waters at least). Wherever one
goes, as a grad student it's hard to escape the
feeling that the undergrads own the place
and you're there on their sufferance.
Worse, it appears that I achieved consid
erably more recognition as a head TA (two
greetings) or a fellow French student (one
giggle) than as a Daily columnist (nada).This
is particularly upsetting as 1 had been operat
ing on the assumption that I had legions of
adoring fans out amongst the proles. Sadly,
though, it appears it's just you and I, dear
reader. [Sob]
But enough moping. Let me instead share
my impressions of Monday's moonlit
shenanigans. After all, I have to keep up the
journalist act if this trick is ever going to
work.
First off, while there were certainly
shenanigans, 1 couldn't help feeling just a lit
tle let down. Despite the promise of an un
usual odour (a solid background of stale
sweat with heavy overtones of mouthwash,
the firm support of booze-laden breath, oc
casional whiffs of excess perfume and, for
reasons I couldn't understand, the faintest
hint of sulphur) the night did not produce

anything resembling an orgy.
Personally, I blame the somewhat monas
tic Absolute "Fun" faction that apparently
controls the Full Moon festivities. Clearly
this is an evening when you should be plying
people with liquor (hell that's true of most
evenings); if you're going to regret it in the
morning you may as well have an excuse.
Actually, aside from the whole alcohol
thing, I was very impressed with the organi
zation. Where else but Stanford could you
find a decades-old tradition enacted with a
stage, full power PA system and video
screens? Only the slogan was missing: "Free
love on the Farm — it's orderly."
Maybe that was a shade facetious. On bal
ance, it was abundantly clear that I didn't fit
in on the Quad. Perhaps from the outside
these Stanford traditions don't really work
— I mean every time I try and explain punt
ing (Google it) to people who never experi
enced the Cambridge bubble they look at me
as if I'm crazy.
The problem with that line of thought,
however, is that you pretty soon start to miss
what you used to be: an insider. Instead of en
gaging with the crowds at events like Mon
day's you're left doing nothing more than
looking on with a faint air of amusement.
And all the fun and excitement is stuck on
the other side of the looking glass.

Recognize the photo? Boost my ego by saying
hello the next time you see me on the street. Al
ternatively, e-mail navins@stanford.edu and
tell me how to make people love me for whom
I'm pretending to be.

I've long been an admirer of Tom Wolfe.
This is not a result of his writing (excel
lent), his social commentary (simplified,
but witty and poignant) or his incredible abil
ity to recycle the same plot and characters in
three separate novels (though I suppose a
triple 500-page-plus variation on a theme is
an achievement of sorts).
No, I admire the man because by the sim
ple act of donning his white suit he managed
to spend quality time "researching" his latest
work (last year's "I am Charlotte Simmons")
by hanging out with (presumably nubile)
young folk at colleges all over the country.
The man is over 70 and yet no accusations
of sketchiness are flung his way when he goes
off gallivanting with kids over half a century
younger.
Having heard this tale some months ago, I
decided that perhaps all I needed to do was
dress appropriately, pick up some kind of
journalistic cover story and I would be free to
party with the youth of today.
So, on Monday night, I finally screwed my
courage to the sticking-place, donned my
