Music service disappointing
I have been eagerly anticipating Yahoo!'s
Music Unlimited service ever since The
Daily first mentioned it on Sept. 30 ("Agree
ment Nears with Yahoo! Music"). Now that I
finally have the service, I am quite disap
pointed. First, in order to use it, I had to
download a bloated software package from
Yahoo! that causes programs completely un
related to the music service to load upon
startup. Second, downloaded music files can
only be acquired through the Yahoo! Music
Engine — a dismal attempt at an iTUnes
clone with a slow and clumsy user interface.
On top of this, despite the advertised 1.5
million song library, the selection is surpris
ingly hit-or-miss, particularly given the col
lege crowd's often obscure tastes. Once I had
waded through the life works of Britney
Spears, N'Sync and O-Town, I found that
Yahoo! Music Unlimited offers zero tracks
by The Postal Service, a band that can hardly

be considered obscure given that more than
600 Stanford students list it among their fa
vorites on Face book.
The advertised shortcoming of this serv
ice was that it is incompatible with Apple
products. What we didn't know is that some
PC users would also find it virtually unus
able.
I respect Stanford's goals in offering this
new service, but after giving it a try, I highly
doubt that it will represent a viable alterna
tive to the illegal downloading that our gen
eration finds so natural.

In his column "Wikipedia is wicked cool"
(Oct. 18), Andrew Leifer claims that "[y]our
first stop for any kind of research should al
ways be Wikipedia, the Internet's free, ever

evolving encyclopedia of everything." It is
deeply disturbing that he should think so.
Anyone, for whatever motive, can edit the
encyclopedia entries on Wikipedia, often
blurring the line between fact and opinion. If,
for example, one wanted to find information
about Bill Gates or Jane Fonda, they would
encounter articles that Wikipedia's founder,
Jimmy Wales, called "nearly unreadable
crap.'TTiere simply is no cheap and easy re
placement for thorough and scholarly re
search, and part of any academic endeavor is
knowing one's source.
