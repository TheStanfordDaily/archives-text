## The 						Heat won't stay hot (so root for the Lakers) 
### 
Last week. I reflected upon how the preceding
seven days had constituted an amazing week
in sports, one which was topped off by a Stan
ford win and a Cal loss on the football field. But you
may have noticed (or at least 1 did) that among all
the different items I deemed worthy of top-sports
status, I did not make one mention of the rapidly up
coming NBA season.
My mistake. If you thought I was excited enough
about the Cardinal football team — enough to suc
cinctly analyze the rest of their season, anyway —
just hear me talk about pro basketball. Some people
hate it because of the ever-growing, me-first attitude
of its players. But let me share with you some
thoughts on 'Da League.
It's never too early for preseason excitement.
With the season tipping off in November, training
camps and exhibition schedules are in full swing.
Ihis is the most exciting time of the year: getting the
first glimpses of the recently drafted rookies and
reading all about who the potential "busts" and
"surprises" might be. Half the predictions will be
wrong (hence the characterization: surprise).
Ihis same knock can be applied as well to pre
season projected standings. I don't particularly re
spect these projections simply because they don't
take into account injuries that are bound to happen
and ignore the potential Shaq-Kobe-Karl-Gary
esque meltdown that faces any given talent-laden
team. Nevertheless, these predictions lend them
selves to interesting discussions.
Given this attempt at a disclaimer, I offer two po
tentially shocking predictions.
First, the Lakers will fight fora top-four seed in
the Western Conference. Yes. this is a bold state
ment. But Kobe Bryant is Kobe Bryant, and I don't
mean that in a negative way. I have to admit, with my
southern California roots I've been trained to love
the Lakers,hate the Kings and be generally apathet
ic about our other team (the Clippers). So, you can
take anything I say here to be the partial thoughts of
an ever-optimistic Los Angelino.
But let me do my best to justify this first state
ment. My predicted Lakers starting lineup will be
PG-Aaron McKie, SG-Kobe Bryant, SF-Lamar
Odom. PF-Kwame Brown and C-Chris Mihm. That
lineup boasts three incredible athletes in Kobe,
Lamar and Kwame. Meanwhile, Mihm was both a
double digit scorer and a serviceable center last year.
If need be, power forward Brian Cook can step into
the four spot, and Brown can slide into the center po
sition. In any case, those are four legitimate big-men
(6-foot-10 or taller) making contributions in the line
up. And that's without mention of the 7-foot 10th
pick in this past year's draft, 17-year-old Andrew
Bynum, who I'm not counting on for large contribu
tions this season.
With a bona fide superstar in Kobe — who will
learn to dominate the game even more via points and


Samuel
Chen
An/thing Goes
passing — a quasi-superstar on any
other team in Lamar Odom and a
supporting cast of players who know
their roles (or will at least have their
roles firmly drilled into their heads by
a surprisingly not-ring-hungry Phil
Jackson),only the San Antonio Spurs,
Houston Rockets, Phoenix Suns and
maybe the Dallas Mavericks have the
depth to surpass the Lakers record by
the end of the season.
The other prediction 1 have is that
the Miami Heat won't get out of the
first round of the playoffs this year.
Now. you can hardly mention the
Lakers without mentioning the
Heat, who have the Diesel or Big [in
sert any word resembling "huge"]
leading the charge. But despite all the
hype about the star-studded starting
lineup of Jason Williams, Dwayne
Wade, Antoine Walker, Udonis
Haslem and Shaquillc O'Neal, I
don't expect particularly big things.
I believe this will be the year that
Shaq breaks down in the spring and
fails to recover beyond the capabili
ties of a 15-point and seven-rebound
mortal. Additionally, Williams and

Walker are too erratic to be counted
on. Haslem, while solid, is not spec
tacular enough to spark a team, and
Gary Payton — who should he the
key reserve for the year — is too old.
Finally, Dwayne Wade simply is not
good enough to do it on his own. I'm
not saying that they're not going to
he good—just that they won't be
good enough in May to finish strong.
Now that that's out of my system,
NBA basketball, despite a number
of negative storylines, is still the best
it's been in years. Only a few years
ago there was talk of how the West
ern Conference was pulling away
from the East in terms of the talent
level, but with the league more bal
anced than ever (due to the Shaq
trade, the emergence of Leßron
James and other developments), we
are in for 2,460 amazing games this
season.
Oh. and when you get to the end
of this column and ask, "Did I just
read an entire column about NBA
basketball when I won't be watching
a game until the Lakers/Heat Christ
mas day matchup?" just stay happy
and think to yourself: Stanford 20,
Arizona 16; Oregon State 23,Cal 20.

of negative storylines, is still the best
it's been in years. Only a few years
ago there was talk of how the West
ern Conference was pulling away
from the East in terms of the talent
level, but with the league more bal
anced than ever (due to the Shaq
trade, the emergence of Leßron
James and other developments), we
are in for 2,460 amazing games this
season.
Oh. and when you get to the end
of this column and ask, "Did I just
read an entire column about NBA
basketball when I won't be watching
a game until the Lakers/Heat Christ
mas day matchup?" just stay happy
and think to yourself: Stanford 20,
Arizona 16; Oregon State 23,Cal 20.

Last week. I reflected upon how the preceding
seven days had constituted an amazing week
in sports, one which was topped off by a Stan
ford win and a Cal loss on the football field. But you
may have noticed (or at least 1 did) that among all
the different items I deemed worthy of top-sports
status, I did not make one mention of the rapidly up
coming NBA season.
My mistake. If you thought I was excited enough
about the Cardinal football team — enough to suc
cinctly analyze the rest of their season, anyway —
just hear me talk about pro basketball. Some people
hate it because of the ever-growing, me-first attitude
of its players. But let me share with you some
thoughts on 'Da League.
It's never too early for preseason excitement.
With the season tipping off in November, training
camps and exhibition schedules are in full swing.
Ihis is the most exciting time of the year: getting the
first glimpses of the recently drafted rookies and
reading all about who the potential "busts" and
"surprises" might be. Half the predictions will be
wrong (hence the characterization: surprise).
Ihis same knock can be applied as well to pre
season projected standings. I don't particularly re
spect these projections simply because they don't
take into account injuries that are bound to happen
and ignore the potential Shaq-Kobe-Karl-Gary
esque meltdown that faces any given talent-laden
team. Nevertheless, these predictions lend them
selves to interesting discussions.
Given this attempt at a disclaimer, I offer two po
tentially shocking predictions.
First, the Lakers will fight fora top-four seed in
the Western Conference. Yes. this is a bold state
ment. But Kobe Bryant is Kobe Bryant, and I don't
mean that in a negative way. I have to admit, with my
southern California roots I've been trained to love
the Lakers,hate the Kings and be generally apathet
ic about our other team (the Clippers). So, you can
take anything I say here to be the partial thoughts of
an ever-optimistic Los Angelino.
But let me do my best to justify this first state
ment. My predicted Lakers starting lineup will be
PG-Aaron McKie, SG-Kobe Bryant, SF-Lamar
Odom. PF-Kwame Brown and C-Chris Mihm. That
lineup boasts three incredible athletes in Kobe,
Lamar and Kwame. Meanwhile, Mihm was both a
double digit scorer and a serviceable center last year.
If need be, power forward Brian Cook can step into
the four spot, and Brown can slide into the center po
sition. In any case, those are four legitimate big-men
(6-foot-10 or taller) making contributions in the line
up. And that's without mention of the 7-foot 10th
pick in this past year's draft, 17-year-old Andrew
Bynum, who I'm not counting on for large contribu
tions this season.
With a bona fide superstar in Kobe — who will
learn to dominate the game even more via points and

Chen
An/thing Goes
passing — a quasi-superstar on any
other team in Lamar Odom and a
supporting cast of players who know
their roles (or will at least have their
roles firmly drilled into their heads by
a surprisingly not-ring-hungry Phil
Jackson),only the San Antonio Spurs,
Houston Rockets, Phoenix Suns and
maybe the Dallas Mavericks have the
depth to surpass the Lakers record by
the end of the season.
The other prediction 1 have is that
the Miami Heat won't get out of the
first round of the playoffs this year.
Now. you can hardly mention the
Lakers without mentioning the
Heat, who have the Diesel or Big [in
sert any word resembling "huge"]
leading the charge. But despite all the
hype about the star-studded starting
lineup of Jason Williams, Dwayne
Wade, Antoine Walker, Udonis
Haslem and Shaquillc O'Neal, I
don't expect particularly big things.
I believe this will be the year that
Shaq breaks down in the spring and
fails to recover beyond the capabili
ties of a 15-point and seven-rebound
mortal. Additionally, Williams and

Walker are too erratic to be counted
on. Haslem, while solid, is not spec
tacular enough to spark a team, and
Gary Payton — who should he the
key reserve for the year — is too old.
Finally, Dwayne Wade simply is not
good enough to do it on his own. I'm
not saying that they're not going to
he good—just that they won't be
good enough in May to finish strong.
