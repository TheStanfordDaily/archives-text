## The
						Heat won't stay hot (so root for the Lakers) 
### 
Last week. I reflected upon how the preceding
seven days had constituted an amazing week
in sports, one which was topped off by a Stan
ford win and a Cal loss on the football field. But you
may have noticed (or at least 1 did) that among all
the different items I deemed worthy of top-sports
status, I did not make one mention of the rapidly up
coming NBA season.
My mistake. If you thought I was excited enough
about the Cardinal football team — enough to suc
cinctly analyze the rest of their season, anyway —
just hear me talk about pro basketball. Some people
hate it because of the ever-growing, me-first attitude
of its players. But let me share with you some
thoughts on 'Da League.
It's never too early for preseason excitement.
With the season tipping off in November, training
camps and exhibition schedules are in full swing.
Ihis is the most exciting time of the year: getting the
first glimpses of the recently drafted rookies and
reading all about who the potential "busts" and
"surprises" might be. Half the predictions will be
wrong (hence the characterization: surprise).
Ihis same knock can be applied as well to pre
season projected standings. I don't particularly re
spect these projections simply because they don't
take into account injuries that are bound to happen
and ignore the potential Shaq-Kobe-Karl-Gary
esque meltdown that faces any given talent-laden
team. Nevertheless, these predictions lend them
selves to interesting discussions.
Given this attempt at a disclaimer, I offer two po
tentially shocking predictions.
First, the Lakers will fight fora top-four seed in
the Western Conference. Yes. this is a bold state
ment. But Kobe Bryant is Kobe Bryant, and I don't
mean that in a negative way. I have to admit, with my
southern California roots I've been trained to love
the Lakers,hate the Kings and be generally apathet
ic about our other team (the Clippers). So, you can
take anything I say here to be the partial thoughts of
an ever-optimistic Los Angelino.
But let me do my best to justify this first state
ment. My predicted Lakers starting lineup will be
PG-Aaron McKie, SG-Kobe Bryant, SF-Lamar
Odom. PF-Kwame Brown and C-Chris Mihm. That
lineup boasts three incredible athletes in Kobe,
Lamar and Kwame. Meanwhile, Mihm was both a
double digit scorer and a serviceable center last year.
If need be, power forward Brian Cook can step into
the four spot, and Brown can slide into the center po
sition. In any case, those are four legitimate big-men
(6-foot-10 or taller) making contributions in the line
up. And that's without mention of the 7-foot 10th
pick in this past year's draft, 17-year-old Andrew
Bynum, who I'm not counting on for large contribu
tions this season.
With a bona fide superstar in Kobe — who will
learn to dominate the game even more via points and
