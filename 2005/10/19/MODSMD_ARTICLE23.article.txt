# Dynamic Duo
## Already stars on the international stage, Richards and Barboza double up to lead the Cardinal in defense of a national title

Between the two of them, they boast four High School Play
er of the Year awards. Each one was the top recruit of her class,
and with nearly a decade of combined experience at every
level of the USA Volleyball system, Stanford's outside hitting
duo of junior Kristin Richards and freshman Cynthia Barboza
might just be the best one-two punch in collegiate volleyball.
The two had been fast friends long before they donned Car
dinal red, dating back to their days on the US. Junior National
Team four years ago. Barboza, who was only 14 years old at the
time, idolized and looked up to the older and more experi
enced Richards.
"I was very intimidated by her at first because she was one
of the best players there and I was just starting," Barboza said.
"But we became really good friends."
Richards grew up around volleyball. Her parents were both
former collegiate volleyball players and went on to coach. So
when her older sister began to play club volleyball, nine-year
old Kristin joined in.
"1 always played up an age group," she recalled. "I played
with my sister because I always wanted to be like her, so 1 was
always the youngest and didn't really feel like I was that good."
Despite her early doubts, by 2000 she was the captain of the
U.S. Youth National Team. She received numerous high school
honors after leading her team to the Utah state championship,
including the 2003 Gatorade National Player of the Year award.
Richards followed her high school success with a standout
freshman campaign on the Farm, which earned her Pacific-10
Conference Freshman of the Year and Volleyball Magazine
National Freshman of the Year honors. As a sophomore, she
was named a Volleyball Magazine All-American for her role in
the Cardinal's championship run.
This past summer, Richards earned a starting spot with the
full national team. She tallied a team-high 16 points in an upset
victory over Japan in July before returning to the Farm for pre
season training.
Barboza has also spent time with the national team, despite
the relatively short length of her career thus far.
"I started playing when I was 11," she said. "I was really
awkward when I started, so it took me a while to get the hang
of things."
She progressed quickly and at age 16 was the youngest
member of the U.S. team at the 2003 Pan-Am games. She was
the only high school player at pre-Olympic training camp last
year and was the first alternate for the Olympics squad in
Athens — all before the start of her senior year.
Like Richards, Barboza was greatly lauded as a high school
player in Long Beach. By collecting two consecutive Gatorade
Player of the Year awards, she became the first volleyball play
er and only the fourth athlete ever to achieve this feat.
Both Richards and Barboza chose to play for Stanford be
cause of the strength of the volleyball program and the school's
academic reputation. Barboza knew she wanted to attend
Stanford long before the recruiting letters came in.
"I always wanted to come here, before I even played volley
ball," Barboza said. "When I was playing soccer,coming to play
[in tournaments] here, I wanted to come."
Richards on the other hand was less sure about coming to
the Farm.
"[I didn't decide] until I was a senior," she said. "Basically
[not until] the day of my commitment."
On the court for the Cardinal this season, the outside hitters
have combined for over 500 kills and nearly 400 digs. In 18 of

the Cardinal's 20 matches thus far, at
least one of the two has recorded a
double-digit kill total. Additionally,
they have a combined total of 14
double-doubles.
So despite being only 18 years
old, Barboza doesn't act like a fresh
man on the court.
"I think she is a great all-around
player, and it's fun working around
her," Richards said. "Whether I'm
front row or back row, we can help
each other out with shots to hit or
where the block is — so it's really help
ful to always have her behind me."
it's a lot of fun playing with peo
ple who are amazingly talented and
that you care about and want to do
well" Barboza said. "Our entire team
is so cohesive off the court that it trans
lates on the court. I would say that the
off-the-court memories are the best so
far, hanging out with the team [and]
having a good time with them."
As one of the team's veteran lead
ers, Richards has also had an impres
sive first half of the season. Her 1,142
career kills put her only 79 short of
cracking Stanford's all-time top 10 —
and she has the remainder of her jun
ior year and her senior year to come.
Richards is also one of the best
defensive players Stanford has ever

seen. She is already in the seventh
spot on the career digs list and on
pace to top the list before she gradu
ates. With the conference season
nearly half over, the Cardinal take
on No. 14 California this Friday —
the only team they have not yet seen
this year. Richards, who has faced
the Bears four times in her career, is
all business about the matchup.
"Cal is a really talented team,"
she said. "We just need to work hard
and prepare for their offense."
Barboza, on the other hand, has
never experienced a serious rivalry
like the one that exists between
Stanford and Cal.
"I don't know what to expect,"
she said. "I'm just excited to go out
and play."
Both Barboza and Richards have
plenty of time left to play at Stanford
and both have the potential to follow
former Stanford greats Kerri Walsh,
Logan I'om and Ogonna Nnamani to
successful international careers.
Richards, an Urban Studies major,
plans to eventually go into social
work but will stick with volleyball
"for as long as (her) body allows."
Barboza, who some say is one of
the best to ever play the game, would
also like to pursue professional vol
leyball. But as central as volleyball is
to her life today, it's not the only defin
ing experience she wants in her life.
"(1 would like) to have a career
— to have something more to me
than just volleyball," she said.
