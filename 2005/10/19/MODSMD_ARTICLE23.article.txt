# Dynamic Duo
## Already stars on the international stage, Richards and Barboza double up to lead the Cardinal in defense of a national title

Between the two of them, they boast four High School Play
er of the Year awards. Each one was the top recruit of her class,
and with nearly a decade of combined experience at every
level of the USA Volleyball system, Stanford's outside hitting
duo of junior Kristin Richards and freshman Cynthia Barboza
might just be the best one-two punch in collegiate volleyball.
The two had been fast friends long before they donned Car
dinal red, dating back to their days on the US. Junior National
Team four years ago. Barboza, who was only 14 years old at the
time, idolized and looked up to the older and more experi
enced Richards.
"I was very intimidated by her at first because she was one
of the best players there and I was just starting," Barboza said.
"But we became really good friends."
Richards grew up around volleyball. Her parents were both
former collegiate volleyball players and went on to coach. So
when her older sister began to play club volleyball, nine-year
old Kristin joined in.
"1 always played up an age group," she recalled. "I played
with my sister because I always wanted to be like her, so 1 was
always the youngest and didn't really feel like I was that good."
Despite her early doubts, by 2000 she was the captain of the
U.S. Youth National Team. She received numerous high school
honors after leading her team to the Utah state championship,
including the 2003 Gatorade National Player of the Year award.
Richards followed her high school success with a standout
freshman campaign on the Farm, which earned her Pacific-10
Conference Freshman of the Year and Volleyball Magazine
National Freshman of the Year honors. As a sophomore, she
was named a Volleyball Magazine All-American for her role in
the Cardinal's championship run.
This past summer, Richards earned a starting spot with the
full national team. She tallied a team-high 16 points in an upset
victory over Japan in July before returning to the Farm for pre
season training.
Barboza has also spent time with the national team, despite
the relatively short length of her career thus far.
"I started playing when I was 11," she said. "I was really
awkward when I started, so it took me a while to get the hang
of things."
She progressed quickly and at age 16 was the youngest
member of the U.S. team at the 2003 Pan-Am games. She was
the only high school player at pre-Olympic training camp last
year and was the first alternate for the Olympics squad in
Athens â€” all before the start of her senior year.
Like Richards, Barboza was greatly lauded as a high school
player in Long Beach. By collecting two consecutive Gatorade
Player of the Year awards, she became the first volleyball play
er and only the fourth athlete ever to achieve this feat.
Both Richards and Barboza chose to play for Stanford be
cause of the strength of the volleyball program and the school's
academic reputation. Barboza knew she wanted to attend
Stanford long before the recruiting letters came in.
"I always wanted to come here, before I even played volley
ball," Barboza said. "When I was playing soccer,coming to play
[in tournaments] here, I wanted to come."
Richards on the other hand was less sure about coming to
the Farm.
"[I didn't decide] until I was a senior," she said. "Basically
[not until] the day of my commitment."
On the court for the Cardinal this season, the outside hitters
have combined for over 500 kills and nearly 400 digs. In 18 of
