# MEN'S GOLF
## Stanford fails to finish effort After a solid start, men's team battles the elements and inconsistency in final round en route to a seventh-place finish 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES 
In addition to formidable weather, the
men's golf team also encountered formi
dable competition yesterday and Sunday
at'lhe Prestige at PGA West in La Quin
ta, Calif. The Stanford men might have
overcome both had it not been fora poor
second day of play that left the squad tied
for seventh out of 18 teams.
The invitational began on Sunday
with a thunderstorm that delayed the
second round. The Cardinal walked
away from the course tied for third with
UC-Irvine with a combined score of 291
alter one round (three over par on the
par-72 course).The men were 11 strokes
behind top-ranked UCLA and just one
stroke behind Colorado.
Returning the following day to a
soggy course for the completion of the
second round (which they finished with
296), the men attempted to continue
their run at UCLA, but a poor third
round (299, fora 886 total) ended those
high ambitions.
"We really had a great day yesterday
and were in a great position to maybe
chase down UCLA today," said head
coach Conrad Ray after the final round
of play. "As good as yesterday was, it was
that bad today — which is frustrating.
But that's just how golf is."
Junior Matt Savage expressed his dis
appointment with the team's third
round drop-off after two rounds of good
play. 11c went three-over-par in the third
round after a one-over-par second
round fora 226 total.
"We were happy but not surprised
with our performance the first two

rounds," he said. "I think we believed we
were going to come out and have a good
third round, but instead it was pretty dis
appointing. We're going to learn from
our mistakes and hopefully be ready for
the next tournament."
The Cardinal didn't run into difficul
ty with extreme weather conditions as
much as they did with other factors. The
location — the Greg Norman Course in
La Quinta — proved one challenge.
"I think that the course where we
played was a course where, if you're hit
ting it straight, you can shoot some real
ly low scores," Ray said. "But if you start
to hit it off line, the desert setting figures
in. I think that was our problem today:
we hit the ball off line too much, and we
couldn't get in the fairway with our driv
ers. So we didn't really set up everything
else like we wanted to."
Sophomore Rob Grube was able to
overcome some of the obstacles of the
course and led the team with a sixth
place individual finish (72-70-73-215,
one under par).
But all the men had good holes and
shots, in Ray's opinion. Juniors Zack
Miller and Savage tied for 32nd (223)
and 44th (226), respectively, while senior
Kyle Gentry tied for 50th (227). Fresh
man Dodge Kemmer contributed as
well, tying for 79th (234).
As a team, though, the third-round
weakness left the squad tied for seventh
with No. 18 Texas at the finish.
"I think that we're a pretty young
team as far as experience goes, and 1
think that we're getting better at that,"
Ray said."l think that we need to contin
ue improving our course management

and get better at saving shots here and
there. I don't think there's really one
specific reason why we haven't been
able to put three good rounds together,
but we're getting closer —so that's a
good thing."
Savage also believes that the team
can find consistency in its game.
"The last two tournaments, we've
been in great position to win after the
first two rounds," he said. "As we be
come more comfortable with being in
that position, 1 believe our performance
will improve."
That confidence is an absolutely nec
essary factor to success, in Grube's opin
ion.
"I think we need to comport our
selves with a winning attitude," he said.
"We need to have confidence that we
can win. When we do that, the wins will
follow."
With confidence and a solid third
round, the team believes it will be able to
compete much more effectively against
top-ranked teams. Already, at The Pres
tige, the Cardinal were able to stack up
with recognized teams.
The Cardinal get another chance to
compete with high-ranked teams when
they head to the three-day Isleworth
Collegiate Invitational that starts this
Sunday in Orlando, Florida. There, the
Stanford men are likely to face their
strongest competition of the season out
side of the NCAA Championships — it
is an opportunity they hope to take ad
vantage of by pulling together every as
pect of their game.
"I think that when we play well, we're
definitely a top-25-ranked team," Ray
said. "We're probably not there right
now in the rankings but maybe that one
score holds us back. I think the guys feel
that way too."
