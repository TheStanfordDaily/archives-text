# Cardinal men and women streak to victory
## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
The men's and women's Cardinal
squads lived up to their status as two of
the most competitive cross country teams
in the nation on Saturday, emerging victo
rious from the Pre-NCA As meet in Terra
Haute, Ind.
The No. 5 men and No. 3 women both
ran in the blue race — one of two equally
competitive races featured at the meet.
"They divide up the races by the cur
rent rankings," head coach Peter Tegen
said. "First they look at whatever the cur
rent rankings are. Then they scratch out
the teams that aren't coming, and whatev
er's left, they leave in the rankings and
then divide up evenly."
Using a method called snaking, the
coaches' poll assigns the first ranked team
attending the meet to the blue race. The
second- and third-ranked squads are
placed in the white race; the fourth- and
fifth-ranked teams back to the blue and so
on. After sorting is done, the method sup
posedly creates two balanced races.
The rankings, though, are subject to
much speculation.
"The rankings aren't that accurate,"
Tegen said. "They can't be. We are just now
getting into the thick of the season. It's a
little bit of fantasy because if you have a
very good team you can hide out.This was
the very first race of this season where we
had all of our runners available."
What has been true for the Cardinal
this season could very well be true for
other teams in the NCAA. Often teams
do not run their best runners until later in
the season, in which case rankings don't
mean anything.
With uncertainty surrounding the
rankings, it is almost impossible to know
where a team stands in relation to the
competition at the Pre-NCAA meet.
Tegen noted that the pace of each race
could be largely determined by different
team strategies.
"There could be some team who is out
to run hard, and then all of a sudden the
whole race becomes a little bit faster," he
said."Conversely you could have the oppo
site — if there is a really good team who de
cides to just control the race, then the race
becomes slow. And then all the time com
parisons go out the window even though
the conditions are pretty much the same."
Nevertheless, the men and women
won their respective races and proved
that they deserve to be in contention for
the NCAA championship titles.
On the men's side, junior Jonathan
Pierce crossed the line first for the Cardi

nal. finishing sixth among the 217 runners
in the blue race. He completed the 8,000-
meter course in a time of 23:51.4
The five Cardinal scorers — Pierce,
junior Brett Gotcher, redshirt freshman
Garrett Heath, senior David Vidal and
sophomore Neftalem Araia — all fin
ished in the top 26. The men racked up 89
points, while the white race winner, Col
orado, finished with 70 points.
"Colorado scored a few less points than
we did,"Tegen said. "But then again we just
really put away the No. 4 ranked team which
was BYU (Brigham Young University)."
BYU finished with 174 points. As a tes
tament that rankings are not always a re
liable basis for predictions, No. 8 Notre
Dame finished second to Colorado in the
white race with % points, well ahead of
No. 4 BYU. The top two ranked teams in
the nation, Arkansas and Wisconsin, did
not participate at the Pre-NCAA meet.
On the women's side, sophomores Ar
ianna Lambie and Teresa Mc Walters fin
ished third and fourth respectively, lead
ing the Cardinal to the team win. Lambie
ran the 6,000-meter course in 20:11 while
McWalters finished in 20:15.
"Arianna ran really well," Tegen said.
"I have to mention Teresa — she ran an
absolutely great race. They both showed
that they've got a lot left."
The three other scorers were junior
Katy Trotter, redshirt freshman Lindsay
Flacks and sophomore Lauren Cen
trowitz. The women accumulated 86
points, as did No. 2 Michigan, who com
peted in the white race.Top-ranked Duke
was not at the meet.
In the open race, the third and less
competitive race, the Cardinal had an ex
cellent showing as well. Junior Jacob
Gomez, who finished second in 24:24.7,
ran "a very gutsy race," according to
Tegen. Sophomore Forest Tahdooahnip
pah and redshirt freshman Hari Mix were
third and fifth respectively.
In the women's open, sophomore
Lindsay Allen was third in 21:39.1, and
freshman Alicia Follmar and sophomore
Shannon Bergstedt were fifth and sixth
respectively.
Despite the positive results at the Pre-
NCAA meet, the Cardinal squads realize
they have a long road ahead of them.
"With both the women and the men we
saw a lot of things that we need to work
on," Tegen said. "We're nowhere close to
being in shape yet. In order to win a na
tional championship you need to have
three things — you need to have everyone
in absolute top shape, have everyone feel
good that day and you need to have a lit
tle, tiny, precious dose of luck."

"I have to mention Teresa — she ran an
absolutely great race. They both showed
that they've got a lot left."
The three other scorers were junior
Katy Trotter, redshirt freshman Lindsay
Flacks and sophomore Lauren Cen
trowitz. The women accumulated 86
points, as did No. 2 Michigan, who com
peted in the white race.Top-ranked Duke
was not at the meet.
In the open race, the third and less
competitive race, the Cardinal had an ex
cellent showing as well. Junior Jacob
Gomez, who finished second in 24:24.7,
ran "a very gutsy race," according to
Tegen. Sophomore Forest Tahdooahnip
pah and redshirt freshman Hari Mix were
third and fifth respectively.
In the women's open, sophomore
Lindsay Allen was third in 21:39.1, and
freshman Alicia Follmar and sophomore
Shannon Bergstedt were fifth and sixth
respectively.
Despite the positive results at the Pre-
NCAA meet, the Cardinal squads realize
they have a long road ahead of them.
"With both the women and the men we
saw a lot of things that we need to work
on," Tegen said. "We're nowhere close to
being in shape yet. In order to win a na
tional championship you need to have
three things — you need to have everyone
in absolute top shape, have everyone feel
good that day and you need to have a lit
tle, tiny, precious dose of luck."

Sophomore Lauren Centrowitz ran a 21:04.9 to take 36th overall at Pre-NCAA's this past week
end. She was the Cardinal's fifth scorer and helped her team clinch the team win.
The men's and women's Cardinal
squads lived up to their status as two of
the most competitive cross country teams
in the nation on Saturday, emerging victo
rious from the Pre-NCA As meet in Terra
Haute, Ind.
The No. 5 men and No. 3 women both
ran in the blue race — one of two equally
competitive races featured at the meet.
"They divide up the races by the cur
rent rankings," head coach Peter Tegen
said. "First they look at whatever the cur
rent rankings are. Then they scratch out
the teams that aren't coming, and whatev
er's left, they leave in the rankings and
then divide up evenly."
Using a method called snaking, the
coaches' poll assigns the first ranked team
attending the meet to the blue race. The
second- and third-ranked squads are
placed in the white race; the fourth- and
fifth-ranked teams back to the blue and so
on. After sorting is done, the method sup
posedly creates two balanced races.
The rankings, though, are subject to
much speculation.
"The rankings aren't that accurate,"
Tegen said. "They can't be. We are just now
getting into the thick of the season. It's a
little bit of fantasy because if you have a
very good team you can hide out.This was
the very first race of this season where we
had all of our runners available."
What has been true for the Cardinal
this season could very well be true for
other teams in the NCAA. Often teams
do not run their best runners until later in
the season, in which case rankings don't
mean anything.
With uncertainty surrounding the
rankings, it is almost impossible to know
where a team stands in relation to the
competition at the Pre-NCAA meet.
Tegen noted that the pace of each race
could be largely determined by different
team strategies.
"There could be some team who is out
to run hard, and then all of a sudden the
whole race becomes a little bit faster," he
said."Conversely you could have the oppo
site — if there is a really good team who de
cides to just control the race, then the race
becomes slow. And then all the time com
parisons go out the window even though
the conditions are pretty much the same."
Nevertheless, the men and women
won their respective races and proved
that they deserve to be in contention for
the NCAA championship titles.
On the men's side, junior Jonathan
Pierce crossed the line first for the Cardi

nal. finishing sixth among the 217 runners
in the blue race. He completed the 8,000-
meter course in a time of 23:51.4
The five Cardinal scorers — Pierce,
junior Brett Gotcher, redshirt freshman
Garrett Heath, senior David Vidal and
sophomore Neftalem Araia — all fin
ished in the top 26. The men racked up 89
points, while the white race winner, Col
orado, finished with 70 points.
"Colorado scored a few less points than
we did,"Tegen said. "But then again we just
really put away the No. 4 ranked team which
was BYU (Brigham Young University)."
BYU finished with 174 points. As a tes
tament that rankings are not always a re
liable basis for predictions, No. 8 Notre
Dame finished second to Colorado in the
white race with % points, well ahead of
No. 4 BYU. The top two ranked teams in
the nation, Arkansas and Wisconsin, did
not participate at the Pre-NCAA meet.
On the women's side, sophomores Ar
ianna Lambie and Teresa Mc Walters fin
ished third and fourth respectively, lead
ing the Cardinal to the team win. Lambie
ran the 6,000-meter course in 20:11 while
McWalters finished in 20:15.
"Arianna ran really well," Tegen said.
"I have to mention Teresa — she ran an
absolutely great race. They both showed
that they've got a lot left."
