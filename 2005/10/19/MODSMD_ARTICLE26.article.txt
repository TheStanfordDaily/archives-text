## Coached by a legend, women prepare for varsity status 
### ANGELA CHENG 
In 1998, a small group of students who
were passionate about the game of squash
formed the Stanford Squash Program so that
they, and others who loved the sport, could
practice together in an organized forum.
Since then, squash at Stanford has grown to
include men's and women's club sports
teams that compete successfully on a nation
al level. Next year, the women plan to take
the next step in their development as a pro
gram by becoming the first varsity squash
team on this side of the nation.
Last year was a successful one for Stanford
squash — with the women's team ranking
No. 19 in the country and the men's team at
No. 20, Stanford was ranked highest among
collegiate club teams. And since there exists
no distinction between club and varsity on the
national they were ranked above sever
al varsity teams from the East Coast.
As of next season, Stanford women's
squash will be given varsity status, making it
the first varsity squash program — men's or
women's — on the West Coast.
"[The squad's success] reflects the
strength of the squash community at Stan
ford and is a testament to what a group of re
ally passionate and slightly obsessive Stan
ford students can accomplish," former cap
tain Maisy Samuelson said.
The team was entirely student-run until
last August's arrival of Mark Talbott, consid
ered by many to have been the greatest
American squash player.
"It was a huge shock to the squash world
when Mark left his national championship
team at Yale to take over a student-run club
team at Stanford," Samuelson said.
Nevertheless,Talbott has greatly enjoyed
his time at Stanford.
"Though our team isn't as experienced as
Yale's, the students are just as enthusiastic,
just as confident and maybe a little less
blase," Talbott said. "Some of the students
there played squash all their lives and knew
they were good. [ButJ here, most of the peo
ple are new to the sport and have shining
faces when they play."
Despite all of his accomplishments, Tal
bott has no ego and his relaxed coaching style
fits well with the student-driven character of
the program, Samuelson added.
"He still lets students run a lot of the day
to day stuff and is really good at big picture
stuff," she said.
Samuelson, a senior in Economics and
Human Biology, was instrumental in bringing
women's squash to the varsity level. A basket
ball player in high school, Samuelson came to
Stanford never having played squash before.
"I got hooked on squash the first time I
played as a freshman because it requires a
unique combination of eye-hand coordina
tion, strength, conditioning, strategy and de
sire," she said.
Though busy with academic work,
Samuelson always found time for squash
"It was all of my exercise and whole lot of
my social experience at Stanford and always
such a fun break from the rest of life," she
said. "Beyond playing squash, it's been an
enormous privilege for me to be part of such
a cohesive, supportive and fun team."
The team is currently raising all funds for
the program — contributions to the endow
ment of the women's varsity team come from
supportive alumni and other outside sources
who want to promote squash on the West
Coast. With a varsity program, these benefac
tors hope to attract some of the most compet
itive players in the nation to play for the Car
dinal.
And now, with the new facilities in the Ar
illaga Center for Sports and Recreation, the
members of the squash team have the best fa
cility on the West Coast and one of the nicest
in the nation. Having been boxed in by stone
walls strewn with holes for several years in
the DeGuerre Courts, the team members
were ecstatic about their new courts. Com
plete with a high ceiling,glass walls and seven
squash courts (one is an exhibition court with
three glass walls), the facility is ideal for prac
ticing as a team.
"We've definitely had to fight for every
thing that we've achieved," Samuelson said.
"The program's broader goal is to provide as
many people as possible with the opportunity
to learn and play squash.The nice thing about
Stanford is that if you build a thriving com
munity that adds value to the university and
creates some excitement, people will listen."
The team cultivates their enthusiasm for
squash in the local community as well. It has
squash tutoring for disadvantaged youth and
plans to expand that program to Menlo Park
High School.
"As the best overall sport for staying in
shape, it is ideal for professionals with busy
schedules," added assistant coach Zan Feild,
a former tennis player who switched to
squash the first time he picked up a racket.
"It's a great form of social interaction, or one
can simply blow off steam."
Stanford students should also watch for
an intramural squash league — Talbott plans
to share his love of squash with the greater
Stanford community. According to Feild. this
will be an opportunity not to be missed.
"Imagine being taught basketball by
Michael Jordan," he said.

ple are new to the sport and have shining
faces when they play."
Despite all of his accomplishments, Tal
bott has no ego and his relaxed coaching style
fits well with the student-driven character of
the program, Samuelson added.
"He still lets students run a lot of the day
to day stuff and is really good at big picture
stuff," she said.
Samuelson, a senior in Economics and
Human Biology, was instrumental in bringing
women's squash to the varsity level. A basket
ball player in high school, Samuelson came to
Stanford never having played squash before.
"I got hooked on squash the first time I
played as a freshman because it requires a
unique combination of eye-hand coordina
tion, strength, conditioning, strategy and de
sire," she said.
Though busy with academic work,
Samuelson always found time for squash
"It was all of my exercise and whole lot of
my social experience at Stanford and always
such a fun break from the rest of life," she
said. "Beyond playing squash, it's been an
enormous privilege for me to be part of such
a cohesive, supportive and fun team."
The team is currently raising all funds for
the program — contributions to the endow
ment of the women's varsity team come from
supportive alumni and other outside sources
who want to promote squash on the West
Coast. With a varsity program, these benefac
tors hope to attract some of the most compet
itive players in the nation to play for the Car
dinal.
And now, with the new facilities in the Ar
illaga Center for Sports and Recreation, the
members of the squash team have the best fa
cility on the West Coast and one of the nicest
in the nation. Having been boxed in by stone
walls strewn with holes for several years in
the DeGuerre Courts, the team members
were ecstatic about their new courts. Com
plete with a high ceiling,glass walls and seven
squash courts (one is an exhibition court with
three glass walls), the facility is ideal for prac
ticing as a team.
"We've definitely had to fight for every
thing that we've achieved," Samuelson said.
"The program's broader goal is to provide as
many people as possible with the opportunity
to learn and play squash.The nice thing about
Stanford is that if you build a thriving com
munity that adds value to the university and
creates some excitement, people will listen."
The team cultivates their enthusiasm for
squash in the local community as well. It has
squash tutoring for disadvantaged youth and
plans to expand that program to Menlo Park
High School.
"As the best overall sport for staying in
shape, it is ideal for professionals with busy
schedules," added assistant coach Zan Feild,
a former tennis player who switched to
squash the first time he picked up a racket.
"It's a great form of social interaction, or one
can simply blow off steam."
Stanford students should also watch for
an intramural squash league — Talbott plans
to share his love of squash with the greater
Stanford community. According to Feild. this
will be an opportunity not to be missed.
"Imagine being taught basketball by
Michael Jordan," he said.
In 1998, a small group of students who
were passionate about the game of squash
formed the Stanford Squash Program so that
they, and others who loved the sport, could
practice together in an organized forum.
Since then, squash at Stanford has grown to
include men's and women's club sports
teams that compete successfully on a nation
al level. Next year, the women plan to take
the next step in their development as a pro
gram by becoming the first varsity squash
team on this side of the nation.
Last year was a successful one for Stanford
squash — with the women's team ranking
No. 19 in the country and the men's team at
No. 20, Stanford was ranked highest among
collegiate club teams. And since there exists
no distinction between club and varsity on the
national they were ranked above sever
al varsity teams from the East Coast.
As of next season, Stanford women's
squash will be given varsity status, making it
the first varsity squash program — men's or
women's — on the West Coast.
"[The squad's success] reflects the
strength of the squash community at Stan
ford and is a testament to what a group of re
ally passionate and slightly obsessive Stan
ford students can accomplish," former cap
tain Maisy Samuelson said.
The team was entirely student-run until
last August's arrival of Mark Talbott, consid
ered by many to have been the greatest
American squash player.
"It was a huge shock to the squash world
when Mark left his national championship
team at Yale to take over a student-run club
team at Stanford," Samuelson said.
Nevertheless,Talbott has greatly enjoyed
his time at Stanford.
"Though our team isn't as experienced as
Yale's, the students are just as enthusiastic,
just as confident and maybe a little less
blase," Talbott said. "Some of the students
there played squash all their lives and knew
they were good. [ButJ here, most of the peo
ple are new to the sport and have shining
faces when they play."
