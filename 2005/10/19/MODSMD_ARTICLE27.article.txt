# SPECIAL EVENT
## U.N. Film Festival opens tonight 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Late Monday night, a handful of
students stood spellbound in front
of the television — bizarre scenes of
kidnapped girls and forced mar
riages were flickering across the
screen. Moments earlier, these stu
dents were surrounded by the wild
ly liberal activities of Full Moon on
the Quad; an uncomfortable con
trast to the depictions of bride kid
napping and forced marriage in
front of them.
The students were organizers of
the United Nations Association Film
Festival, pre-screening the film
"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan"
two nights ago. Tonight, it will offi
cially be shown as the opening act of
the Film Festival, being held in Cub
berley Auditorium with a reception
and live music. The film will be
screened at 6:45 p.m. with London
filmmaker Petr Lom in attendance.
A total of 32 documentaries will be
featured at the festival, which runs
until Sunday. Filmmakers are flying
from as far as India to discuss their
films with attendees.
Jasmina Bojic,a film critic,profes
sor and the festival's founder and di
rector, hopes that the films will pro
voke viewers to think beyond the
items on their to-do lists and consicL

er the issues facing their fellow hu
mans.
"Through the films we try and
make a bridge between the different
communities," Bojic said. "It's a
beautiful thing because people can
recognize themselves in the stories."
This year, the stories range from
the trials of building a well in the De
mocratic Republic of the Congo to a
young girl's fight for sex education in
Texas to the struggles of hundreds of
Rwandan women spared by geno
cide and left to rebuild their nation.
"The film gives you the facts to go
search for the whole truth," Bojic
said. "It is the filmmaker's story, and
then the viewer has to go and make it
their own. The film is the starting
point."
This is the same idea that film
maker and environmental advocate
Bo Boudart had in mind when put
ting together "Oil on Ice" with his co
producer Dale Djerassi. The docu
mentary connects the fate of the Arc
tic National Wildlife Refuge to deci
sions that Americans make every
day regarding the policies they sup
port, the cars they drive and the
politicians they elect.
"Very few Americans have visited
the Artie National Wildlife Refuge,
very few understand that what can
be gained is very little and what re
mains to be lost is verv big," Boudard

said. "It's a question of values and I
think that people really can see that
it comes down to them —if they
drive vehicles that are more efficient
and demand technology that doesn't
depend on oil, all of these things can
definitely change the fate of land that
belongs to all Americans, not just
those in power whose interests are
being served."
Bojic had the same integration of
creativity and global awareness in
mind when she conceptualized and
organized the festival. The first festi
val, which took place eight years ago,
coincided with the 50th anniversary'
of the Declaration of Human Rights.
According to Bojic, the festival is a
celebration of the Declaration and
the values it advocates.
Despite its name, the festival is
not politically or financially connect
ed to the United Nations. Instead,
support for the event comes largely
from Stanford groups, such as the
Stanford Film Society
"Everyone loves a movie," said
senior Jimmy Mosqueda, co-presi
dent of the Stanford Film Society.
"Combining an audio and visual ex
perience to present human rights is
sues is an effective way to communi
cate. To have these films come in
from all over the world, and have
them be free to Stanford students, is
just an amazing opportunity."
