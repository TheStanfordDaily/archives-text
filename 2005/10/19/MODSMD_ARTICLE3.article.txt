## ASSU stresses student group cooperation 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate held its
fourth meeting of the year last night to discuss ob
jectives for the upcoming months as well as more
specific issues such as ASSU office hours and stu
dent group funding. Director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities Nanci Howe congratulated the
Senate on helping out with Full Moon on the
Quad, adding that the night passed with "reason
ably minor problems."
The meeting began with a presentation from
ASSU President Melanie Kannokada and Vice
President Aneto Okonkwo, both seniors, who
stated the ASSU's major goals for the year. Above
all, they stressed collaboration between student
groups as well as cooperation with the Graduate
Student Council and the University administra
tion.
The presentation brought to light the chal
lenges associated with the abundance of student
groups on campus, including over-programming
and funding issues as well as a lack of visibility for
many student groups and a clear understanding of
what the ASSU can do for students.
Kannokada and Okonkwo addressed both
short and long term space issues dealing with new
student spaces and the fact that some
student groups have been displaced
due to the current construction
around campus.They also brought up
student space initiatives for the Old
Union, Tresidder Union and the
Graduate Community Center.
"It's a great center now, but we re
ally want to see it thrive as a place of
life, so all students feel like this is a
place for them as opposed to just a
building," Okonkwo said.
The pair also brought up projects
including Club Sports funding, pub
licity for the Graduate Diversity
Committee, voter registration and
hurricane relief as well as a graduate
student Web site for the Career De
velopment Center.

The controversy over on-campus
flyering was closed and Campus Ad
vocacy Senator Andrew Hendel, a
senior, prepared a press packet with
the ASSU response. Resident Fel
lows had complained about student
groups and off-campus businesses
posting too many flyers in the
dorms. Hendel proposed that Stan
ford Student Enterprises could take
down offending flyers and negotiate
flyering limits with the administra
tion.
The ASSU Senate will be hosting
office hours in White Plaza on Oct. 26
from 11:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. during
which students can pick up a free
Jamba Juice and give ASSU senators
suggestions about what changes and

projects they'd like to see happen.
The ASSU is considering drafting
a constitutional amendment that
would allow senators to run for office
during their junior years and still be
able to study abroad.This would help
with senator retention levels, accord
ing to Senator Kai Lukoff, a sopho
more. He also brought up the possi
ble need fora new and more student
accessible petition system.
The Senate also passed a bill to cre
ate a maximum of two terms for the
ASSU and SSE financial manager
and bills appropriating funds for the
Black Pre-business society, Sigma
Theta Psi, Women and Youth Sup
porting Each Other, the Stanford
Band and Habitat for Humanity.
