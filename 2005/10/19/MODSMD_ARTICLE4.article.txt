# STUDENT LIFE
## Stern Late Night serves on weekends 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's Saturday, 1:30 a.m.,Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
"Hos Gone Wild" party is winding down, and
you're a little tipsy, car-less and very hungry. The
most pressing question is now — where do you
go?
Up until last weekend the possibilities were
limited to hijacking a golf cart fora joyride to
Jack-in-the-Box or raiding Chi Theta Chi's organ
ic food bins. Now, thanks to the efforts of the
ASSU Senate and Stanford Dining, the hungry
and car-less can take advantage of weekend late
night dining at the Cyber Cafe in Stern. The
Cyber Cafe will be open from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
seven nights a week.
"There's no food on campus on the weekends
at night," said senior Andrew Hendel, chair of the
Senate Advocacy Committee. "And that seems to
be the time when a lot of students are looking for
food, if they came back from a party or wherever.
So for students with no open kitchen, it's kind of
inconvenient."
The weekend late-night dining will run as a
pilot program for the rest of the aca
demic year. If successful, the new
schedule will be continued next year.
"Two years ago they had a pilot
program, but it only lasted a month,"
said sophomore Vang Kou Khang,
deputy chair of the Senate Advocacy
Committee. "This year it's still a
pilot program, but it will run for the
whole year no matter how well it
does financially."

Depending on the level of week
end demand at the Stern Cyber Cafe,
dining administrators will consider
also opening Late Nite Cafe at Lake
side on weekends during winter
quarter.
"It's always been a concern with
students," Khang said. "Friday and
Saturday should be the busiest
days."
Stanford Dining will be hiring
new workers to staff the extended
hours and are looking specifically for
student workers for the weekend
shifts.
Bringing weekend late night din
ing options to campus was a popular

campaign promise last spring when
this year's crop of ASSU senators
was running for office.
"I'm pleased to have achieved
some of the things 1 set out to do
when I was running," Hendel said,
stressing that the achievement was
the result of a group effort. "There
were a lot of people involved in
bringing late night back on the
weekends, and a lot of people had
mentioned it as one of their cam
paign goals last spring, including
myself. This is a major concession
we got from Stanford Dining —
Late Nite was one of the salient is
sues."
