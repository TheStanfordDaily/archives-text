# Student NGO aims to help HIV/AIDS refugees
## Three stopped-out juniors create FACE AIDS 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Sitting on a porch in a Zambian refugee
camp, three students decided that their
Stanford careers had to be put on hold. Lau
ren Young, Jonny Dorsey and Katie Boll
bach, who all would be juniors, decided that
they could not just go back to school and
leave the needs of the refugee camp to re
solve themselves.
"We sat there talking for hours," Dorsey
said. "By the end we had decided that we
had to stop out of school. It was a long day.
It was a good day."
In place of classes, essays and problem
sets, the trio has started a group called
FACE AIDS, to address the HIV/AI DS cri -
sis in Africa. The plan is to create co-ops
among HIV-positive refuges that will be
trained to make beaded awareness pins and
will double as a support group â€” some
thing that is blatantly lacking in Africa.
The pins will then be sold by student
groups at campuses across the United
States. The goal is to raise $1 million by the
end of the year to be given to grassroots
AIDS organizations in sub-Saharan Africa.

If all goes according to plan, thousands
of HIV-positive refugees will benefit from
the warmth of one woman and her impact
on these three students.
Mama Katele, an HIV-positive woman
at the refugee camp where the students
were working, helped to run a voluntary
counseling and testing clinic. In particular,
she talked to tuberculosis patients about

the importance of getting tested.
Out of the estimated 1 ,(XX) refugees in
the camp who carry the virus and the 47
who knew they were HIV-positive, Mama
Katele was the only one to disregard the
stigma associated with AIDS in Africa and
speak openly about her disease.
"She invited us into her home and intro
duced us to her children and grandchil
dren," Young said. "She really humanized
everything we had heard about AIDS in
Africa."
It was the needs of Mama Katele that
prompted the conversation on the porch, it
was the fact that her needs were mirrored
so many times over that inspired the stu
dents to dedicate their year to FACE AIDS.
Emphasizing the need for AIDS preven
tion and care in Africa, Mama Katele died a
week after Young and Dorsey left the camp
because the promised anti-retro viral
(AVR) drug was not made available. The
students will honor their inspiration and
friend by naming the fund they create the
Katele Fund.
"It's disappointing because the woman
who inspired the fund won't be able to ben
efit from it," Young said.
But the loss of Katele has not left FACE
AIDS behind on that porch in Zambia.
