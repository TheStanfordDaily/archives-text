# Student NGO aims to help HIV/AIDS refugees
## Three stopped-out juniors create FACE AIDS 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Sitting on a porch in a Zambian refugee
camp, three students decided that their
Stanford careers had to be put on hold. Lau
ren Young, Jonny Dorsey and Katie Boll
bach, who all would be juniors, decided that
they could not just go back to school and
leave the needs of the refugee camp to re
solve themselves.
"We sat there talking for hours," Dorsey
said. "By the end we had decided that we
had to stop out of school. It was a long day.
It was a good day."
In place of classes, essays and problem
sets, the trio has started a group called
FACE AIDS, to address the HIV/AI DS cri -
sis in Africa. The plan is to create co-ops
among HIV-positive refuges that will be
trained to make beaded awareness pins and
will double as a support group — some
thing that is blatantly lacking in Africa.
The pins will then be sold by student
groups at campuses across the United
States. The goal is to raise $1 million by the
end of the year to be given to grassroots
AIDS organizations in sub-Saharan Africa.

If all goes according to plan, thousands
of HIV-positive refugees will benefit from
the warmth of one woman and her impact
on these three students.
Mama Katele, an HIV-positive woman
at the refugee camp where the students
were working, helped to run a voluntary
counseling and testing clinic. In particular,
she talked to tuberculosis patients about

the importance of getting tested.
Out of the estimated 1 ,(XX) refugees in
the camp who carry the virus and the 47
who knew they were HIV-positive, Mama
Katele was the only one to disregard the
stigma associated with AIDS in Africa and
speak openly about her disease.
"She invited us into her home and intro
duced us to her children and grandchil
dren," Young said. "She really humanized
everything we had heard about AIDS in
Africa."
It was the needs of Mama Katele that
prompted the conversation on the porch, it
was the fact that her needs were mirrored
so many times over that inspired the stu
dents to dedicate their year to FACE AIDS.
Emphasizing the need for AIDS preven
tion and care in Africa, Mama Katele died a
week after Young and Dorsey left the camp
because the promised anti-retro viral
(AVR) drug was not made available. The
students will honor their inspiration and
friend by naming the fund they create the
Katele Fund.
"It's disappointing because the woman
who inspired the fund won't be able to ben
efit from it," Young said.
But the loss of Katele has not left FACE
AIDS behind on that porch in Zambia.

Today Bollback, Dorsey and Young are mov
ing forward with their plans.
Bollback is taking care of the production
end from her post in Zambia, where she will
remain until February at the earliest. Not
only is she setting up the co-ops, she is also
ensuring that these groups help their mem
bers to deal with the physical and emotion
al challenges of living with HIV/AIDS. This
includes finding trained medical profes-

sionals and coun
selors to work with
the groups.
While finding com
petent recipient or
ganizations also falls
under Bollback's list
of duties, FACE AIDS
hopes to be able to tap
into the network of
Stanford students who
have worked in Africa
and witnessed the ef
fectiveness of organi
zations in action.
"We have so many
students here who
have worked in Africa
and have first-hand
knowledge of how or
ganizations work on

the ground," Dorsey said. "They can tell us a
lot more about an organization than just
what's on the Web site."
They plan to distribute the money to
grassroots groups that balance HIV/AIDS
protection. An additional consideration for
organizations receiving money is whether or
not they have other funding sources. FACE
AIDS aims to reach those smaller organiza
tions that do not have access to other sources
of grants.
Now beneath the palms of Stanford's
campus, Dorsey and Young are working to
obtain matching grants from corporations
and individuals to help them reach their goal
of $1 million. They are also establishing stu
dent networks to help the organization at all
levels.
"We are trying to put together a market

11 We are trying to put to
gether a marketing team,
find people who can help
with consulting, awareness
campaigns, dispensing
material and even buying
the pins themselves
— Lauren Young, junior

terial and even buying the pins themselves,"
Young said. " llie pins are more than just
fundraising; they are a way of building excite
ment."
So far. they have recruited senior Johnny
Falla, the president of Fusion (the social en
trepreneurship network), as an internal strat
egy consultant and senior Jake Wachman to
design their Web site.
"Jake said he was retired from Web site

design, but he came
out of retirement for
us," Young joked.
So far, help and
support have poured
in. Dorsey's mom of
fered her house as the
operation headquar
ters, and Young is able
to live on campus for
free because of
friends who would not
allow anything else.
"Support has
come from unexpect
ed places and in unex
pected ways," Young
said. "People that we
didn't think would be
supportive have
stepped lip and of-

fered their services."
FACE AIDS has also received communi
ty support from organization such as I-DEX
and Firelights and has established an adviso
ry board that includes Consulting Professor
Anne Firth Murray and Microbiology Pro
fessor Robert Siegel.
"If Lauren and Jonny had not been so ob
viously excited and committed to their dream
and their cause. I might have hesitated to as
sociate myself with their program," Murray
said. "But they are knowledgeable and very
driven to make their plans real."
Today, Young could be quietly pursuing
her double major in international relations
and economics and Dorsey could be
abroad in Oxford, rooming with his best
Iriend. Instead, they are changing the
shape of AIDS response so that maybe the
next Mama Kateie can live a little longer
and a little easier.
