## School of Education to begin expansion 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
The School of Education began
construction on the Barnum Family
Center for School and Community
Partnerships, located next to the
Stanford clock tower, on Oct. 13.The
school plans to renovate the existing
building, used previously by the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Cen
ter, adding two courtyards and a sec
ond story.
"The new center will be a place
where Stanford researchers and
practitioners in the community can
work collaboratively to improve
schools and communities and cre
ate better opportunities for posi
tive youth development," said Deb
orah Stipek, dean of the School of
Education, in an Oct. 7 press re
lease.
Stipek said in an interview with
The Daily that the building will pro
vide much needed space for Stan
ford's education programs.
"We were very tight on space and
we were expanding the collabora
tive work we are doing with commu
nities and schools," Stipek said. "The
new building will give us the space
to do this work — and to make it
visible to the rest of the campus."
Construction is expected to take
one year and should conclude in the
fall of 2006," said Erica Gilbertson,
communications manager at the
School of Education. Donors have so
far committed $5 million towards the
project, including a $3 million pledge
made by alumni Bill and Donalissa
Barnum. Classes of 1976 and 1981,
respectively.
Gilbertson added that the reno
vated building will house the John
W. Gardner Center for Youth and
Their Communities and "partner
ships that bring Stanford faculty and
students together with school ad
ministrators and teachers to im
prove K-12 education enable the
School of Education to expand its
operations and increase its ties to the
Stanford campus and the surround
ing community."
"The building will provide a
physical space for innovative con
nections and conversations to take
place among faculty, students,
youth, school leaders and adminis
trators," Gilbertson said. "The
building will continue to break
down barriers between the universi
ty and the real world, as we seek to
bridge education research and prac
tice."
Other projects and partnerships
that may operate out of the Bar
num Center include East Palo Alto
High School and the new K-8 char
ter, California School Redesign
Network, the Stanford Mathemat
ics Teaching and Learning Project
and the National Board Resource
Center.
"The partnerships we have with
local communities and schools are
important to the work of the School

of Education," Stipek said. "They
inform our research and they give
us an opportunity to support efforts
to improve community contexts
and educational programs for
youth."
Among those who will most
benefit from the new Barnum Cen
ter are School of Education gradu
ate students, who will use the build
ing as office space and a base to
conduct research.
"Graduate students are deeply
involved in the work that will go on
in the new building, and many will
have offices there," Stipek said.
After the old Career Planning

and Placement Center had been
rendered uninhabitable by an elec
tric fire in 2001, the building's oc
cupants were moved to their cur
rent building, located near the
Haas Center for Public Service on
Salvatierra Walk. Gilbertson said
that in 2002 the provost gave the
building to the School of Educa
tion because of the School's lack of
space and that the Barnum's com
mitted their donation in the fall of
2004.
Currently, the school is confined
to the education building and the
neighboring Center for Education
Research at Stanford (CERAS).

"The partnerships we have with
local communities and schools are
important to the work of the School

of Education," Stipek said. "They
inform our research and they give
us an opportunity to support efforts
to improve community contexts
and educational programs for
youth."
Among those who will most
benefit from the new Barnum Cen
ter are School of Education gradu
ate students, who will use the build
ing as office space and a base to
conduct research.
"Graduate students are deeply
involved in the work that will go on
in the new building, and many will
have offices there," Stipek said.
After the old Career Planning

and Placement Center had been
rendered uninhabitable by an elec
tric fire in 2001, the building's oc
cupants were moved to their cur
rent building, located near the
Haas Center for Public Service on
Salvatierra Walk. Gilbertson said
that in 2002 the provost gave the
building to the School of Educa
tion because of the School's lack of
space and that the Barnum's com
mitted their donation in the fall of
2004.
Currently, the school is confined
to the education building and the
neighboring Center for Education
Research at Stanford (CERAS).
