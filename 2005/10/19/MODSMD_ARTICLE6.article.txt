## School of Education to begin expansion 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
The School of Education began
construction on the Barnum Family
Center for School and Community
Partnerships, located next to the
Stanford clock tower, on Oct. 13.The
school plans to renovate the existing
building, used previously by the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Cen
ter, adding two courtyards and a sec
ond story.
"The new center will be a place
where Stanford researchers and
practitioners in the community can
work collaboratively to improve
schools and communities and cre
ate better opportunities for posi
tive youth development," said Deb
orah Stipek, dean of the School of
Education, in an Oct. 7 press re
lease.
Stipek said in an interview with
The Daily that the building will pro
vide much needed space for Stan
ford's education programs.
"We were very tight on space and
we were expanding the collabora
tive work we are doing with commu
nities and schools," Stipek said. "The
new building will give us the space
to do this work â€” and to make it
visible to the rest of the campus."
Construction is expected to take
one year and should conclude in the
fall of 2006," said Erica Gilbertson,
communications manager at the
School of Education. Donors have so
far committed $5 million towards the
project, including a $3 million pledge
made by alumni Bill and Donalissa
Barnum. Classes of 1976 and 1981,
respectively.
Gilbertson added that the reno
vated building will house the John
W. Gardner Center for Youth and
Their Communities and "partner
ships that bring Stanford faculty and
students together with school ad
ministrators and teachers to im
prove K-12 education enable the
School of Education to expand its
operations and increase its ties to the
Stanford campus and the surround
ing community."
"The building will provide a
physical space for innovative con
nections and conversations to take
place among faculty, students,
youth, school leaders and adminis
trators," Gilbertson said. "The
building will continue to break
down barriers between the universi
ty and the real world, as we seek to
bridge education research and prac
tice."
