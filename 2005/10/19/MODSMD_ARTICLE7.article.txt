# New Arrillaga Center opens, faces criticism
## Lack of showers and locker rooms irk students 
### KATHERINE HARVEY 
Following months of construction delays, the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center (AFRC), lo
cated on the corner of Galvez Street and Campus
Drive, finally opened its doors to the Stanford
community on Monday, Oct. 10.
As requested by donor John Arrillaga, the new
Recreation Center is a visually impressive build
ing that was designed to exude an open atmos
phere. It occupies over 70,(XX) square feet, making
it the largest building on campus.
But for many students, the building's pros may
stop at its aesthetic appeal. Some say they are less
than impressed with the eagerly-anticipated fit

ness center. The source of most criticism is the fa
cility's conspicuous absence of locker rooms and
showers.
"It's very inconvenient," said sophomore
Kaitlin Arena. "There's just noplace to change."
Although he's never been to the new center,
one source who asked to remain anonymous
questioned the building's shortcomings.
"I've heard a lot of people complaining about
it not having locker rooms or showers, but I've
heard the construction on the building was not re
ally complete.so maybe they just haven't put them
in yet," he said. "Because it doesn't make sense
that there wouldn't be locker rooms or showers in
a gym."
Sherry Posthunius, assistant athletic director
for clubs, recreation and educational programs,
said in an interview with the Stanford Report in
July that there are no plans to add showers and

locker rooms to the fitness center. In the inter
view, Posthumus said lockers and showers in the
Arrillaga Sports Center across Campus Drive
would still he available to those who work out at
the new center. While expecting some initial com
plaints about the showers' separate locations,
Posthumus said she hoped users will eventually
adjust to the minor inconvenience.
Additional showers and lockers at Roble Gym
will also remain open for recreational use. Provost
John Etchemendy announced during a Faculty
Senate meeting on Feb. 3, despite plans to convert
the gym into additional classrooms for the Drama
Department starting in the 2005-2006 school year.
Prior to the opening of the AFRC,only a hand
ful of athletic facilities were available to students
for recreational use. TYesiddcr Union housed a
