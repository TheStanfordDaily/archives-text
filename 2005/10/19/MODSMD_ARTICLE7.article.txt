# New Arrillaga Center opens, faces criticism
## Lack of showers and locker rooms irk students 
### KATHERINE HARVEY 
Following months of construction delays, the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center (AFRC), lo
cated on the corner of Galvez Street and Campus
Drive, finally opened its doors to the Stanford
community on Monday, Oct. 10.
As requested by donor John Arrillaga, the new
Recreation Center is a visually impressive build
ing that was designed to exude an open atmos
phere. It occupies over 70,(XX) square feet, making
it the largest building on campus.
But for many students, the building's pros may
stop at its aesthetic appeal. Some say they are less
than impressed with the eagerly-anticipated fit

ness center. The source of most criticism is the fa
cility's conspicuous absence of locker rooms and
showers.
"It's very inconvenient," said sophomore
Kaitlin Arena. "There's just noplace to change."
Although he's never been to the new center,
one source who asked to remain anonymous
questioned the building's shortcomings.
"I've heard a lot of people complaining about
it not having locker rooms or showers, but I've
heard the construction on the building was not re
ally complete.so maybe they just haven't put them
in yet," he said. "Because it doesn't make sense
that there wouldn't be locker rooms or showers in
a gym."
Sherry Posthunius, assistant athletic director
for clubs, recreation and educational programs,
said in an interview with the Stanford Report in
July that there are no plans to add showers and

locker rooms to the fitness center. In the inter
view, Posthumus said lockers and showers in the
Arrillaga Sports Center across Campus Drive
would still he available to those who work out at
the new center. While expecting some initial com
plaints about the showers' separate locations,
Posthumus said she hoped users will eventually
adjust to the minor inconvenience.
Additional showers and lockers at Roble Gym
will also remain open for recreational use. Provost
John Etchemendy announced during a Faculty
Senate meeting on Feb. 3, despite plans to convert
the gym into additional classrooms for the Drama
Department starting in the 2005-2006 school year.
Prior to the opening of the AFRC,only a hand
ful of athletic facilities were available to students
for recreational use. TYesiddcr Union housed a

small fitness center, while Ruble Gym and the Ford Recreational
Center offered limited selections of fitness machines. Ihe varsity
weight room in the basement of the Arrillaga Sports Complex of
fered a full range of machines but opened for full public use only
during select hours of the day.
As a result, non-varsity athletes often encountered over
crowded gyms and long queues for cardiovascular machines.
According to a 2000 report issued by the University's De
partment of Capital Planning, the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation (DAPER) had identified
the pragmatic need for additional space to accommodate both
previously existing demand and the rising number of recre
ational sport participants at Stanford. The Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center was proposed to relieve the burden of the
swamped Arrillaga Family Sports Center and the Ford Recre
ational Center.
Eight elliptical trainers, six treadmills, six stationary bikes and
four recumbent (sit-down) bikes are now offered at the AFRC,
in conjunction with free weights and weight machines.
The AFRC is also home to seven squash courts, three basket
ball courts, a rock-climbing wall, a 4,(XH)- square-foot multipur
pose room, a varsity fencing room, an academic resource center
and a separate 10,(KM)-square-foot space for sports medicine.
Senior Josh Mendoza, who often encountered long waits for
the cardiovascular machines at the varsity weight room last year,
said he's "happy that there's now more cardio machines and
treadmills."
Still, some wonder if there are even enough cardiovascular
machines at the new fitness center to meet students' needs.
"The gym is getting more and more crowded as more people
hear about it," said senior (Catherine Baylin."Today, when 1 went
all the cardiovascular machines were being used. It might start to
piss people off."
Junior Tosin Oyeniran, while pleased about the additional fit
ness space,confessed that he was expecting a little more from the
new fitness center.
"From a school like Stanford, which has so much money to
spend, I was expecting something spectacular," he said. "Lots of
other state schools even have more stuff. Georgia Tech has a wa
terslide. Now that's something I really wish we had."
Arena similarly pointed out a growing trend across universi
ty campuses to have cardio equipment hooked up to TVs.
"UC-Davis has that," he said. "It's pretty standard. I am kind
of disappointed that we don't have that here."

As a result, non-varsity athletes often encountered over
crowded gyms and long queues for cardiovascular machines.
According to a 2000 report issued by the University's De
partment of Capital Planning, the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation (DAPER) had identified
the pragmatic need for additional space to accommodate both
previously existing demand and the rising number of recre
ational sport participants at Stanford. The Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center was proposed to relieve the burden of the
swamped Arrillaga Family Sports Center and the Ford Recre
ational Center.
Eight elliptical trainers, six treadmills, six stationary bikes and
four recumbent (sit-down) bikes are now offered at the AFRC,
in conjunction with free weights and weight machines.
The AFRC is also home to seven squash courts, three basket
ball courts, a rock-climbing wall, a 4,(XH)- square-foot multipur
pose room, a varsity fencing room, an academic resource center
and a separate 10,(KM)-square-foot space for sports medicine.
Senior Josh Mendoza, who often encountered long waits for
the cardiovascular machines at the varsity weight room last year,
said he's "happy that there's now more cardio machines and
treadmills."
Still, some wonder if there are even enough cardiovascular
machines at the new fitness center to meet students' needs.
"The gym is getting more and more crowded as more people
hear about it," said senior (Catherine Baylin."Today, when 1 went
all the cardiovascular machines were being used. It might start to
piss people off."
Junior Tosin Oyeniran, while pleased about the additional fit
ness space,confessed that he was expecting a little more from the
new fitness center.
"From a school like Stanford, which has so much money to
spend, I was expecting something spectacular," he said. "Lots of
other state schools even have more stuff. Georgia Tech has a wa
terslide. Now that's something I really wish we had."
Arena similarly pointed out a growing trend across universi
ty campuses to have cardio equipment hooked up to TVs.
"UC-Davis has that," he said. "It's pretty standard. I am kind
of disappointed that we don't have that here."

Following months of construction delays, the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center (AFRC), lo
cated on the corner of Galvez Street and Campus
Drive, finally opened its doors to the Stanford
community on Monday, Oct. 10.
As requested by donor John Arrillaga, the new
Recreation Center is a visually impressive build
ing that was designed to exude an open atmos
phere. It occupies over 70,(XX) square feet, making
it the largest building on campus.
But for many students, the building's pros may
stop at its aesthetic appeal. Some say they are less
than impressed with the eagerly-anticipated fit

ness center. The source of most criticism is the fa
cility's conspicuous absence of locker rooms and
showers.
"It's very inconvenient," said sophomore
Kaitlin Arena. "There's just noplace to change."
Although he's never been to the new center,
one source who asked to remain anonymous
questioned the building's shortcomings.
"I've heard a lot of people complaining about
it not having locker rooms or showers, but I've
heard the construction on the building was not re
ally complete.so maybe they just haven't put them
in yet," he said. "Because it doesn't make sense
that there wouldn't be locker rooms or showers in
a gym."
Sherry Posthunius, assistant athletic director
for clubs, recreation and educational programs,
said in an interview with the Stanford Report in
July that there are no plans to add showers and

locker rooms to the fitness center. In the inter
view, Posthumus said lockers and showers in the
Arrillaga Sports Center across Campus Drive
would still he available to those who work out at
the new center. While expecting some initial com
plaints about the showers' separate locations,
Posthumus said she hoped users will eventually
adjust to the minor inconvenience.
Additional showers and lockers at Roble Gym
will also remain open for recreational use. Provost
John Etchemendy announced during a Faculty
Senate meeting on Feb. 3, despite plans to convert
the gym into additional classrooms for the Drama
Department starting in the 2005-2006 school year.
