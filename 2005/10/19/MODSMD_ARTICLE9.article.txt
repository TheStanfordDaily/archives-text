## EU authorities urging for more bird flu drugs 
### ROBERT WIELAARD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LUXEMBOURG (AP) â€” European
Union foreign ministersTtoesday declared the
spread of bird flu from Asia to Europe a glob
al threat, as the Swiss manufacturer of one of
the only available anti-flu drugs announced it
was building a new U.S. plant to increase pro
duction amid fears of a major outbreak.
Also TUesday, an Indian drug company
said it was seeking a license from the phar
maceutical giant Roche to produce a gener
ic version of the drug Tamiflu to make it
more widely available.
The European ministers urged interna
tional cooperation to contain the virus and
called on the EU Executive Commission to
accelerate steps to draft stronger rules
against bird flu, which in recent days has
been discovered in Greece, Romania and
Thrkey, leading to bans on poultry from
those countries.
Romanian announced Tiiesday that a
swan with bird flu antibodies was discov
ered near the Ukrainian border. It was not
immediately clear, however, if the swan was
infected with deadly HSNI bird flu strain
that has swept poultry populations in large
swaths of Asia since 2003, jumping to hu
mans and killing 60 people and resulting in
the deaths of tens of millions of birds.
The flu's spread westward by migrating
wild fowl has intensified fears the virus may
mutate into one that can be easily transmit
ted among humans, a development experts
fear could provoke a global epidemic that
puts millions of lives at risk.
In India, pharmaceutical firm Cipla Ltd.
announced it was seeking a license from
Roche to manufacture a generic version of
Tamiflu. The firm, which said last week it al
ready has developed a generic version, plans
to approach Roche fora license shortly. Joint
Managing Director Amar Lulla said.
Roche has been under growing pressure

from governments and U.N. Secretary-Gen
eral Kofi Annan to license generic versions
of Tamiflu, believed to be effective in treat
ing a flu pandemic. The drug is already in
limited supply.
Sen. Charles Schumer. D-N.Y., will call
on Roche to license Tamiflu production to
five U.S. companies within 30 days, he said in
a statement Tliesday. Schumer has said that
if Roche does not allow the additional pro
duction voluntarily, he will introduce legis
lation to force the move.
Earlier 'Riesday, Roche said it plans to
build a new plant in the United States to pro
duce more of the drug. While the firm has
ruled out relinquishing the patent on the drug,
which is protected until 2016, it also has said it
was seeking other companies to help speed
production due to the increased demand.
"For Tamiflu, the key need today is the
rapid expansion of production capacity,"
said William M. Burns, chief executive of
Roche's pharmaceuticals division. "We are
prepared to discuss all available options, in
cluding granting sub-licenses, with any gov
ernment or private company who approach
us to manufacture Tamiflu or collaborate
with us in its manufacturing."
Roche said it could go ahead with its
plans to expand production in the United
States because it had received approval
from the Food and Drug Administration for
the new plant, which it said would be one of
more than a dozen production facilities
worldwide. It did not disclose the location of
the new manufacturing site.
By the middle of next year, the company
says, it will have boosted production tenfold
in comparison with 2003.There is no human
vaccine for the current strain of bird flu, but
scientists believe Tamiflu and the drug Re
lenza may help humans fend off the virus.
Lulla told The Associated Press that any
possible agreement with Roche likely
would limit where the generic version could
be sold, implying the Indian company could

sell in mostly developing nations in Asia
and Africa.
Roche previously said making Tamiflu
involves a complex process and that a com
pany given a license to make a generic copy
would need at least two to three years to
ramp up production.
Cipla said last week its scientists already
have developed the generic version, os
eltamivir,and the company would be able to
bring it into the market early next year.
Tlie company has not said how much a
generic version would cost, but insists it
would be cheaper that Tamiflu, which costs
up to $60 fora strip of 10 tablets. Patients are

advised to take a tablet daily for at least a
week, and the dosage could extend up to six
weeks for people living in epidemic-infested
areas.
The EU ministers were to issue a state
ment saying they recognize bird flu poses a
serious, global health threat if it shifts from
birds to people and would require a coordi
nated international response.
While the bloc stepped up biosecurity
measures and installed early detection sys
tems along the migratory paths of birds to
prevent contamination of domestic flocks,
there are concerns that Europe lacks suffi
cient stockpiles of vaccines and anti-virals.
