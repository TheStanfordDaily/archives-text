WASHINGTON (AP) — Skep
tical senators, concerned over the
jailing of New York Times reporter
Judy Miller, grilled a Justice De
partment representative who testi
fied that government procedures
for getting information from re
porters had worked well for 33
years and didn't need to he altered.
"Here you have a reporter in jail
for 85 days and millions of Ameri
cans wonder why? I'm one of
those," Sen. Arlen Specter said yes
terday as the Judiciary Committee
he heads called Miller and others to
testify on a proposed bill that would
allow reporters to keep the identity
of their sources secret.
The jailing of Miller for refusing
to discuss her sources with federal
prosecutors investigating the dis
closure of undercover CIA agent
Valerie Plame's identity "has had an
obvious chilling effect on other re
porters" around the country, said
Specter, a Pennsylvania Republi
can.
Representing the Justice De
partment, Chuck Rosenberg, a U.S.
attorney in Texas, declined to dis
cuss the specifics of Miller's case but
said, "We should not enter this de
bate believing that the First
Amendment is under assault by the
Department of Justice. Manifestly it
is not."
Rosenberg said that since 1991
only 12 of 243 subpoenas issued
under Justice Department guide
lines to news media called for confi
dential source information.
"We seek information about
confidential sources from reporters
only when it really, really matters,"
Rosenberg said. "What is broken

about the way we are handling sub
poenas to the media? ... I don't see
anything in our work that justifies
discarding 33 years of careful prac
tice that has served the nation well."
On her way into the hearing.
Miller offered a different view: "We
need a federal shield law.That's why
I'm here. I went through a lot to be
able to make this statement."
Former U.S. attorney Joseph
DiGenova suggested that the com
mittee enact the existing Justice
guidelines into law, so reporters
could get courts to enforce them be
cause "notwithstanding what
they're saying today, they don't al
ways do that."
Sen. Dianne Feinstein. D-Calif.,
asked Rosenberg if the department
would support that, but Rosenberg
said even that would be a bad idea
because court appeals could delay
action at times "when we need to
move fast."
"Is that your argument — to
have no bill at all?" Feinstein asked.
"Yes," Rosenberg replied.
In her testimony, Miller ac
knowledged her own stories sug
gesting Iraq had weapons of mass
destruction were flawed by sources
with wrong information. But Miller
argued that "even flawed reporters
should not be jailed for protecting
even flawed sources."
Many sources with accurate in
formation needed by the public will
provide it only to reporters who
promise confidentiality even before
the reporter can assess the informa
tion, she claimed.
Justice's Rosenberg said in testi
mony submitted for the record that
the bill as drafted would seriously
impede the government's ability to
"enforce the law. fight terrorism
and protect the national security."
