## Keep your germs to yourself 
### 
I'd just like to say that of the four Full
Moons I've attended, this year's was,
by far, the most uneventful — even
with my senior status. The highlight, if
you can even call it that, was probably
the red-painted streakers — most of
whom were half-clothed — who pro
ceeded to do nothing really interesting
after a pretty mediocre entrance. 1 did
see two penises, but that's hardly what I
call a highlight.
But because I'm a health columnist
in need of a topic, I'm going to pretend
that Full Moon was action-packed and
that you all probably now have a cold or
the flu. Chances are if you didn't get it at
Full Moon, you will probably get it
sometime soon from that guy that
coughs all over you in section or from
your sick roommate.
So what's the difference between a
cold and the flu? A cold is an upper res
piratory tract infection caused by hun
dreds of different viruses. Symptoms
typically include congestion and/or
runny nose that lasts for three to seven
days. There isn't a whole lot that can be
done treatment-wise since antibiotics
are typically ineffective against viruses.
Home treatments are usually best: lots
of rest, acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol) or
ibuprofin (i.e. Motrin) for body aches
and cold medicines with decongestants
and cough suppressants at night.
Stay home as much as possible and
remember to drink a lot of fluids — at
least two quarts a day. Obviously, avoid
ing all-nighters, eating well and washing
your hands often are all good preventa
tive measures. If you have a cold that
lasts longer than 10 days, you may want
to check in with Vaden or your personal
healthcare provider since you may have
a more severe infection. The flu is
also caused by a virus, but symptoms
tend to appear more rapidly and be
come more severe than those associat
ed with a cold. The main symptoms are
a fever of over 101 degrees, severe body
aches and sometimes a mild cough.The
flu typically does not affect the nose, so
if you have a runny nose, congestion
and/or sore throat, it is more probable
that you have a cold than the flu. If it
seems like you have the flu, you may
want to investigate the latest medica
tions available:
Antiviral medications like Amanta
dine or Rimantadine help prevent the
spread and severity of symptoms of
Type A influenza if taken within 48
hours of the first symptoms. Two other
medications,Tamiflu and Relenza,have
also been shown to shorten the duration
of the flu and are effective for both
strains A and B. As with all medications,
side effects do exist, so check with a
healthcare provider to see if they are
good options for you. You can call the
Vaden Medical Advice Line at (650)
498-2336 Ext. 1 to discuss symptoms
and appropriate treatment options with
a medical professional.
If you find yourself with other symp
toms — such as a fever over 102 de
grees, severe headaches, stiff neck, pain
around the eyes,chest pain or throbbing
in Ihe ears — you should seek medical
attention, as these may be signs of a
more severe illness.
Lastly, another effective method for
avoiding flu misery is to get immunized
ahead of time — as in, right now. The
flu shot is an inactivated influenza vac
cine that causes your body to develop
antibodies to fight off similar strains
you may encounter throughout the flu
season. At only $22 (actually, $11 if you
have Cardinal Care) and one tiny nee
dle prick, it is a damn good investment.
TVpically. the earlier you get the shot,
the better, so hurry over to Vaden to
save yourself from a depressing winter
of both rain and sickness. You should
not get the shot if you have a severe
cold or are allergic to eggs. Vaden runs
a flu shot clinic on most Tuesdays from
3 to 6 p.m.
