# Awake as from a pleasant sleep?
## The 						experts discuss the importance of catching some ZZZs 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
It is 3:30 a.m. on a Tuesday and though
he has a lecture at 9 a.m., sophomore Ed
ward Porrello is still awake in the Twain
lounge, his laptop at his side.
"Honestly,-' Porrello says, without a
hint of a yawn, "I don't sec what the big
deal is. I do just fine without that much
sleep anyways."
Many students at Stanford and at col
leges across the country echo Porrcllo's
sentiment. Despite a barrage of scientific
findings that stress the importance of
sleep, many college students seem to fol
low their own sleep schedules.
Emmanuel lYfignot, professor in the
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences De
partment, wrote an editorial on one re
lated study that appears in the Oct. 2(105
issue of the journal Sleep.
"Our study looked at the link be
tween obesity and short sleep," Mignot
explains.
The study concludes that people who
sleep for fewer than seven or eight hours
a night are significantly more likely to be
overweight.
"When people don't sleep enough,
they stimulate hormones such as leptin

and ghrelin, which control appetite,"
Mi Knot says.
Other studies have found that inade
quate or irregular sleep results in a high
er risk of colon cancer, breast cancer,
heart disease or diabetes.
So is it unhealthy for us college stu- v
dents to stay up until the wee hours of the
morning every Saturday...studying?
Mignot says that though his analysis
was conducted on adults aged 32 to 49,
other studies have found a harmful con
nection between sleep deprivation and
the health of children and young adults.
Rut he notes that there is a difference
between correlation and causality.
"What we have confirmed is only a re
lationship," he says. There are many
other factors which might affect the rela
tionship between sleep and obesity, such
as socio-cconomics, genetics or as
Mignot puts it, "other factors we have
never even considered."
He adds that he sees lack of sleep as
a "catalyst" for obesity, but is reluctant to
pin obesity on sleep habits only.
The researched dangers of sleep dep
rivation do not deter Stanford sopho
more Christine Su from pulling regular
late-night study sessions. Su says she

sleeps an average of four hours a night
and feels most awake and productive be
tween one and three in the morning.
She "has yet to fall asleep before 4
a.m." this year, she explains.
Mignot agrees that teenagers' circadi
, an cycles — or biological clocks — are
"shifted towards sleeping later and wak
ing up later."
Other students say they just feel bet
ter when they sleep less. Senior Andrew
Gradman says he sleeps around six hours
a night on weekdays but much more on
weekends, and "sufferfs] for it" —
Gradman complains of lethargy when he
sleeps too much. He reports "better daily
performance" when he gets just his six
hours and therefore usually ends up
sleeping exactly that amount.
Some agree, maintaining that sleep is
overrated, or at least replaceable. Fresh
man Jessica Cornwell tells The Daily that
even when she gets her shut-eye, she
"needs a coffee in the morning and then
a chai in the afternoon or evening" to
power through the day.
Artificial stimulants are not the only
way students try to make up for a good
night's sleep. Senior Nick Allen says he
sleeps only six hours a night and feels

"generally tired during the day." Naps
help, Allen believes, but general weari
ness still prevails.
Indeed, Mignot's research suggests
that the body "most efficiently recovers
at night" and not with short power naps
throughout the day.
"While everyone's biological clock is
different," Mignot reports, "your best
sleep comes when your body tempera
ture is lowest. For most people, tha< is at
night."
Likely to Mignot and other experts'
satisfaction, some Stanford students
keep regular sleep schedules.
Freshman Scott Lathrope, a member
of the varsity swim team, says he is con
sistently in bed between 9 p.m. and 10
p.m. He must be ready to perform at a
high level every day at practices and
scrimmages and therefore can't afford to
stay up as late as others — he has hour
and-a-half-long morning practices start
ing at 6:30 a.m. Monday, Wednesday and
Friday and a total of 20 hours in the pool
per week.
For those who can't sleep excessive-,
ly, there's an upside.
"When you do fall asleep, you're
out," Allen says.
