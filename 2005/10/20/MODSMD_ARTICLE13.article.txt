# Space constraints plague stem-cell researchers

### SILVIA SANCHEZ 
With the controversy surrounding
stem-cell issues today, one of the major ob
stacles Stanford researchers face is the
availability of space.
Julie Baker, assistant professor of ge
netics, and Barry Behr. assistant professor
of obstetrics and gynecology at the Stan
ford Medical Center, are teaming up to
produce new stem-cell lines from five-day
old embryos that patients donate after in
vitro fertilization procedures, according to
the Stanford News Service. ITiey hope to
collect thousands of new lines — both nor
mal and genetically defective — that
should help them develop cures for genet
ic diseases such as muscular dystrophy.
Because they want to derive new stem
cell lines, however. Baker and Behr must
make do with a less-than-stellar facility —
a S(H) square-foot room.
"It's difficult to create [the new stem
cell lines) simply because of bureaucratic
reasons," Baker says, referring to Presi
dent Bush's policy that denies federal
funding for research on stem-cell lines
taken from new embryos.
"I set forward a policy to advance stem

cell research in a responsible way by
funding research on stem-cell lines de
rived only from embryos that had already
been destroyed." Bush said in a speech on
May 24. 2(X)5. "This policy sets a clear
standard: We should not use public
money to support the further destruction
of human life."
Accordingly. Baker, Behr and other re
searchers across the nation who want to
use new stem-cell lines must find alternate
means of financial support.
Baker and Behr say they receive some
of their money from donor grants and pri
vate funds raised by the University. Behr
adds that they hope California will also re
lease state funding for such projects.
"Not a whole lot has happened be
cause there hasn't been any funding or
space to do the type of research we have
to do," he says.
ITie research being carried out is not
only contingent on funding, but also on
the donation of embryos. Behr says that
many of the embryos from which they
take new lines come from the In Vitro
Fertitttatioa C'linic (TVF) at the Stanford
Medical Center.
"Through the IVF process, there are

many embryos that are cither genetically
abnormal or unfit for clinical use, either
due to morphology or other reasons,"
Behr explains.
Some of these embryos are destroyed,
but others can be used for stem cell re
search if patients give their consent, he
says.
New stem-cell lines are necessary for
Baker and Behr's research because old
lines have been exposed to viruses and
thus cannot be used for human therapies,
according to the Stanford News Service. In
addition, the chromosomes in old lines
have sometimes experienced alteration.
Should any new therapies be devel
oped using these lines, they would be diffi
cult to modify for human use. Baker ex
plains.
She adds that the old lines are the first
ever made, and therefore some were syn
thesized in "sub-optimal" conditions. Tak
ing new lines is also beneficial because re
searchers are more practiced at deriving
lines, and generally more more efficient,
she explains.
"When you derive new lines in any
kind of cell-culture situation you get bet
ter and better at doing it the more you do

it," Baker says.
Newer, healthy cell lines could make it
easier for researchers to study different
diseases and understand how and why ge
netic diseases develop.
"Having lines that could mimic diseases
like cystic fibrosis would he a huge tool for
the disease community — (it would help
us] to understand what went wrong in
these particular syndromes." Baker ex
plains. "Currently, we don't have tools to
study these things, so it's very important."
Baker says that stem-cell research at
Stanford is in its "infancy." However, she
claims that there have been advancements
in the past year in other parts of the world.
"It's progressing rapidly — [for in
stance], one report (in which] a lab did ge
netic cell transfer was a huge break
through." she says, adding "to have pa
tient-tailored lines (through cell transfer]
that have various abnormalities" would
be a huge step toward remedying those
problems.
While Baker and Behr's research is
limited for now. Baker says she remains
optimistic.
"The world is moving ahead." she adds.
"We just have to catch up."
