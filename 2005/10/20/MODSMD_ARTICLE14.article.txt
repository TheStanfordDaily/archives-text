## Editorial Hospitality to Gulf visitors must continue 
### 
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Stan
ford moved quickly to make life a little
easier for 38 students from the New Or
leans area.This fa 11,26 undergraduate and 12
graduate students from Dillard, Loyola.Tu
lane and Xavier universities are attending
classes alongside Stanford students while
their home institutions are being repaired
and renovated.
Stanford deserves commendation for its
timely and appropriate response to Katrina.
The University acted promptly to provide
housing for visiting students, assigned each
visiting student an adviser, and helped stu
dents register manually when Axess was not
immediately available. The New Student
Orientation Office also waived the manda
tory fee for all incoming students. These ef
forts demonstrate the University's commit
ment to the ongoing relief effort and provide
an exemplary model for other schools.
The latest word from New Orleans is that
area schools will be ready to welcome stu
dents back following winter break. Howev
er, if the Katrina disaster has taught us any
thing, it is that advance planning is absolute
ly crucial to handling unexpected situations
with minimum difficulty.Thus, the Universi
ty should start planning now for the possibil
ity that colleges and universities in New Or
leans will not be ready to host classes by Jan
uary. This means deciding in advance
whether or not the visiting students will be
allowed to enroll in classes, what the finan
cial arrangements will be and, perhaps most
importantly, how to address the already
strained housing situation on campus.
As far as attending and paying for classes,
the answer seems clear: Students should be
able to continue attending classes at Stan
ford without paying more than they would at
their home institutions. The marginal cost to
Stanford of having 30-odd students enrolled
in classes is very low, and it is difficult to
think of any reason against visiting students
remaining at Stanford through winter and
spring quarters if necessary.
However, the University also needs to
ensure that housing issues do not prevent
students from continuing their studies with
out interruption. If our visitors from New
Orleans need to remain at Stanford after
this quarter, the University should commit
to finding a housing situation that will nei
ther displace them nor inconvenience Stan
ford students.
Winter quarter housing typically presents
a challenge for the University, as many more
students study abroad during the fall than in

the winter. These returning students some
times create a housing crunch, as the Univer
sity struggles to provide spaces for all stu
dents — occasionally relying on creative so
lutions such as converting study rooms or
small lounges into sleeping spaces. Doubt
less. the 19 visiting students who currently
live in on-campus housing will add to this
crunch.
Even so, this is no excuse for the Univer
sity to throw up its hands and deny housing
either to students visiting from New Orleans
or to students returning from study abroad.
Refusing to provide future housing for stu
dents displaced by Katrina may make it fi
nancially or logistically impossible for these
students to continue attending classes at
Stanford. Temporary off-campus housing
may be impossible to find or prohibitively
expensive. Once the University made the de
cision to open its doors to visiting students, it
accepted responsibility for ensuring that
these students' educational needs were met.
Stanford should therefore do whatever is
necessary to allow them to continue attend
ing classes until they can return to their
home institutions.
Stanford students returning from study
abroad programs also deserve considera
tion. In deciding to travel, they counted on
having housing available when they re
turned. Unexpectedly having to search for
an off-campus alternative would be a consid
erable and unacceptable burden fora stu
dent returning from overseas.
The best solution would obviously involve
the University housing all students in rea
sonable living situations on campus. If this is
not possible, we propose that the University
subsidize enough off-campus housing to ac
commodate everyone. The issue of whether
visiting or returning students should have
priority for on-campus housing may arise —
if it does, the University should seek volun
teers to live off campus, or even offer a slight
financial incentive for students who do so, in
order to compensate them for the additional
inconvenience.
The best-case scenario is that our guests
from New Orleans will be able to return to
their home institutions following winter
break. But, as the relief efforts on the Gulf
Coast have already demonstrated, the best
case scenario isn't always possible.
Ultimately, continued efforts by the Uni
versity to welcome and accommodate visit
ing students from New Orleans will play a
small but important role in putting the Kat
rina disaster in the past.
