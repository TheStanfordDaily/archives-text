# Ironic ruminations into existence
## 
### 
Rumor has it that Philosophy Prof.
Lanier Anderson cried at the end of
his existentialism lectures, because
he was deeply moved by the subject matter.
These words first reached my ears at a Du
alist meeting — the weekly gathering of the
undergraduate philosophy journal bunch.
"Life is pointless. I mean, I realize that, but
that's nothing to cry about," I said in naive
amusement. My voice drowned in the clam
or. Only the most tongue-in-cheek guy in
Sigma Nu gave an appreciative laugh.
That life is utterly pointless should not
surprise anyone. When I, as a teeny-weeny
kid with a teeny-weeny mind (and 1 haven't
changed much since then), realized that life
was pointless, I had that feeling of mental
pain — of brain chemicals involuntarily
changing to make you suffer. I was about to
fall asleep. It was one of the first times I real
ized that the nebulous realm of conscious
ness could be a source of pain tantamount to
bodily suffering. I had never previously
thought you could spontaneously suffer, the
cause was always an external factor — a
bike accident or mischief gone awry.
But then a peaceful slumber gripped me.
My mental fever faded. Though existential
worries had vacuumed up life's slick glam
our, the ruthless machinery — the routine
daily tasks — behind life's wonders had es
sentially remained intact. I still had to get
up; I still had to brush my teeth; I still had to
breathe; I still had to live. I remember telling
myself that there was still hope.
I can't quite remember what "hope"
meant for me in that context. As emotional
and comforting as it might have been at the
time, I can now see some faulty arguments
that might substantiate such an irrational
hope.
I am told that there can be happiness. To
be honest, an ideal such as "happiness" does
fill a great void, and those who achieve it
should truly consider themselves a success.

But reality very rarely allows for true happi
ness. The majority of life is made up of Iraqi
civilians dying under bombshells, children
starving to death, isolated university stu
dents imprisoned in their rooms, grouchy
drivers angry at red lights, 12-hour work
shifts. Life is too stupid, too ill-mannered to
allow for true, permanent happiness. What
remains after this sieve of stupidity, disap
pointment and misery is a set of discrete,
transitory moments that trivially sweeten
one's wooden soul. For most, happiness is
not a continuous state, but the occasional
breaking of the wistful sunlight through omi
nous clouds.
I am also told that there can be real soli
darity between people. Since they all find
themselves in the same situation, there is
common ground for mutual support. In re
ality. however, we are so consumed by the
future, by exams, job interviews and re
quirements — the ruthless cogs of that ma
chine — that we never really turn our con
sciousness around to grasp our swampy ex
istence. Such flirtation with ugly cogs only
inflates our egos, which in turn further
blinds us from seeing even the possibility of
solidarity.
One may hope that this state of affairs
gains the poetry of a moving tragedy — that
the eternal void of existence, though de
pressing. has beauty and is equivalent to
some tragic protagonist's sublime death due


Cihan
Baran
Noumena
to fatal forces out of her control.
However, the pointlessness of life
lacks any such deep poetry. 1 hate to
break it to you, but there is no great
tragedy to be lamented. Life is plain
and boring.lnhere is no grandeur, but
onlv a silence that stretches itself to

infinity — which brings me to my
final point.
"Laugh at the stupidities of the
world," wrote Soren Kierkegaard,
"and you will regret it: weep over
them, and you will also regret it..."
What arises from this mess is a wry.
encompassing irony. The murk of our
swampy existence should but amuse
us. "...Laugh at the stupidities of the
world or weep over them,you will re
gret it either way."
Now is one of those "discrete.

transitory moments that trivially
sweeten one's wooden soul." I turn
my eyes inward and the chasm of my
existence — the feeling of vertigo —
takes me by its wings, leaving me
gasping for breath. I am deeply rev
eling in, as Milan Kundera said,"the
unbearable lightness of being."

transitory moments that trivially
sweeten one's wooden soul." I turn
my eyes inward and the chasm of my
existence — the feeling of vertigo —
takes me by its wings, leaving me
gasping for breath. I am deeply rev

unbearable lightness of being."

Rumor has it that Philosophy Prof.
Lanier Anderson cried at the end of
his existentialism lectures, because
he was deeply moved by the subject matter.
These words first reached my ears at a Du
alist meeting — the weekly gathering of the
undergraduate philosophy journal bunch.
"Life is pointless. I mean, I realize that, but
that's nothing to cry about," I said in naive
amusement. My voice drowned in the clam
or. Only the most tongue-in-cheek guy in
Sigma Nu gave an appreciative laugh.
That life is utterly pointless should not
surprise anyone. When I, as a teeny-weeny
kid with a teeny-weeny mind (and 1 haven't
changed much since then), realized that life
was pointless, I had that feeling of mental
pain — of brain chemicals involuntarily
changing to make you suffer. I was about to
fall asleep. It was one of the first times I real
ized that the nebulous realm of conscious
ness could be a source of pain tantamount to
bodily suffering. I had never previously
thought you could spontaneously suffer, the
cause was always an external factor — a
bike accident or mischief gone awry.
But then a peaceful slumber gripped me.
My mental fever faded. Though existential
worries had vacuumed up life's slick glam
our, the ruthless machinery — the routine
daily tasks — behind life's wonders had es
sentially remained intact. I still had to get
up; I still had to brush my teeth; I still had to
breathe; I still had to live. I remember telling
myself that there was still hope.
I can't quite remember what "hope"
meant for me in that context. As emotional
and comforting as it might have been at the
time, I can now see some faulty arguments
that might substantiate such an irrational
hope.
I am told that there can be happiness. To
be honest, an ideal such as "happiness" does
fill a great void, and those who achieve it
should truly consider themselves a success.

But reality very rarely allows for true happi
ness. The majority of life is made up of Iraqi
civilians dying under bombshells, children
starving to death, isolated university stu
dents imprisoned in their rooms, grouchy
drivers angry at red lights, 12-hour work
shifts. Life is too stupid, too ill-mannered to
allow for true, permanent happiness. What
remains after this sieve of stupidity, disap
pointment and misery is a set of discrete,
transitory moments that trivially sweeten
one's wooden soul. For most, happiness is
not a continuous state, but the occasional
breaking of the wistful sunlight through omi
nous clouds.
I am also told that there can be real soli
darity between people. Since they all find
themselves in the same situation, there is
common ground for mutual support. In re
ality. however, we are so consumed by the
future, by exams, job interviews and re
quirements — the ruthless cogs of that ma
chine — that we never really turn our con
sciousness around to grasp our swampy ex
istence. Such flirtation with ugly cogs only
inflates our egos, which in turn further
blinds us from seeing even the possibility of
solidarity.
One may hope that this state of affairs
gains the poetry of a moving tragedy — that
the eternal void of existence, though de
pressing. has beauty and is equivalent to
some tragic protagonist's sublime death due


Cihan
Baran
Noumena
to fatal forces out of her control.
However, the pointlessness of life
lacks any such deep poetry. 1 hate to
break it to you, but there is no great
tragedy to be lamented. Life is plain
and boring.lnhere is no grandeur, but
onlv a silence that stretches itself to

infinity — which brings me to my
final point.
"Laugh at the stupidities of the
world," wrote Soren Kierkegaard,
"and you will regret it: weep over
them, and you will also regret it..."
What arises from this mess is a wry.
encompassing irony. The murk of our
swampy existence should but amuse
us. "...Laugh at the stupidities of the
world or weep over them,you will re
gret it either way."
Now is one of those "discrete.

sweeten one's wooden soul." I turn
my eyes inward and the chasm of my
