# Naked, the new black
## 
### 
We began writing this column cold,
naked and sober, sitting in a room
filled with hot, naked bodies being
covered in paint. That's not entirely accu
rate. We were not naked. We were painted
with trees and fruit and birds, in the likeness
of the twin virtues of Prudence and Patience.
The others in the room masqueraded as
Mondrians, bookshelves, checkerboards and
jabberwockies. We danced that night with a
bottle of Absolut Fun that covered an ab
domen, with a city skyline that arched
around a waist, with a superwoman sporting
nothing but her superskin painted in reds
and yellows and blues.
Elsewhere, seniors groped and locked
lips with freshmen, and PHEs handed out
Listerine to guard against disease. Dancers
writhed and propositioned in song from the
stage. Naked as we were, the body-painting
was the least sexual happening on campus.
Maybe that's why The Daily's staff writer
covering the event seemed so "disenchant
ed" with the "art" the naked bodies dis
played ("Kiss me Cardinal, Oct. 18). If he
was expecting "exotic or sexy" he was miss
ing the point.
We weren't out there to kiss freshmen,
and we certainly weren't there to be sexy.
We were not surprised when we were
slapped or propositioned. We were not
shocked by the crowd's dropped jaws. We
didn't run naked all the way to the Quad just

for that. We did it for ourselves. To surprise
ourselves. Because we're seniors and next
year we won't have this freedom.
Quite frankly,streaking the Quad was the
evening's anticlimax. The sea of painted
flesh didn't emerge out of nowhere. After
hours of agonizing over the perfect design to
fit each body, fighting over color schemes
and finding someone willing to touch your
body like an artist does her canvas, painting
was the easy part. Outside the Quad, the en
ergy peaked while we stretched in a circle. 50
painted Stanford students: "Ten jumping
jacks. Touch your toes. Remember to relax
your neck."
The music from the main stage drifted
over the crowd. Gawking bystanders took
digital photos that will no doubt ruin any
hope we had of a political future. But in this
circle, we weren't facing out. We focused our
energy inward, toward these friends and
strangers who were transformed fora night
into a desexualized battalion in the middle
of Stanford's sexual frenzy. Tonight we had

nothing to hide, because tonight we had
nothing to offer. Tomorrow we could laugh
and blush and flirt, but tonight we were art.
Symbols of human beauty in its purest, most
classical form.
Perhaps the most fitting piece of art
adorned the woman made up as a Mondrian
painting. The rigid black lines that enclosed
blue, red and yellow rectangles were a stark
contrast to the curves of a human body. Yet
art complemented art.'lTie lines emphasized
the curves, and curves deconstructed lines.
We stood in awe of the new, human perspec
tive on Mondrian that we would never no
tice in any art museum. But more, it was a
pseudo-avant-garde perspective on the
human organism —an organized conflu
ence of the linear disjunction between
meaning and form and purpose and function
that is art.
When the streaking was over and all the
lewd solicitations flatly rejected, the streak
ers regrouped off the Quad before returning
home. "Now everyone kiss someone!" came
a shout from the middle. But no one
smooched. We all stood around staring
blankly at each other. Instead, we strolled
home to our abandoned clothing, waiting for
sunrise and a return to normalcy.

Did you see Prudence and Patience on Mon
day night? Let us know what you thought of
our body paint at mhutcher@stanford.edu or

played ("Kiss me Cardinal, Oct. 18). If he
was expecting "exotic or sexy" he was miss
ing the point.
We weren't out there to kiss freshmen,
and we certainly weren't there to be sexy.
We were not surprised when we were
slapped or propositioned. We were not
shocked by the crowd's dropped jaws. We
didn't run naked all the way to the Quad just

for that. We did it for ourselves. To surprise
ourselves. Because we're seniors and next
year we won't have this freedom.
Quite frankly,streaking the Quad was the
evening's anticlimax. The sea of painted
flesh didn't emerge out of nowhere. After
hours of agonizing over the perfect design to
fit each body, fighting over color schemes
and finding someone willing to touch your
body like an artist does her canvas, painting
was the easy part. Outside the Quad, the en
ergy peaked while we stretched in a circle. 50
painted Stanford students: "Ten jumping
jacks. Touch your toes. Remember to relax
your neck."
The music from the main stage drifted
over the crowd. Gawking bystanders took
digital photos that will no doubt ruin any
hope we had of a political future. But in this
circle, we weren't facing out. We focused our
energy inward, toward these friends and
strangers who were transformed fora night
into a desexualized battalion in the middle
of Stanford's sexual frenzy. Tonight we had

nothing to hide, because tonight we had
nothing to offer. Tomorrow we could laugh
and blush and flirt, but tonight we were art.
Symbols of human beauty in its purest, most
classical form.
Perhaps the most fitting piece of art
adorned the woman made up as a Mondrian
painting. The rigid black lines that enclosed
blue, red and yellow rectangles were a stark
contrast to the curves of a human body. Yet
art complemented art.'lTie lines emphasized
the curves, and curves deconstructed lines.
We stood in awe of the new, human perspec
tive on Mondrian that we would never no
tice in any art museum. But more, it was a
pseudo-avant-garde perspective on the
human organism —an organized conflu
ence of the linear disjunction between
meaning and form and purpose and function
that is art.
When the streaking was over and all the
lewd solicitations flatly rejected, the streak
ers regrouped off the Quad before returning
home. "Now everyone kiss someone!" came
a shout from the middle. But no one
smooched. We all stood around staring
blankly at each other. Instead, we strolled
home to our abandoned clothing, waiting for
sunrise and a return to normalcy.

day night? Let us know what you thought of
