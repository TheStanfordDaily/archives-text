# Op-Ed
## Vote 'yes' on Prop. 73 
### NOELLE PATNO 
Lynne Rosen's faulty analysis of Propo
sition 73 in last Friday's op-ed ("Prop. 73
would have dire consequences," Oct. 14)
does an injustice to those who seek the best
support for minors contemplating an abor
tion.The passage of Prop. 73 would provide
teenage women seeking an abortion sup
port and advice for better health care, as
evidenced by reasons ranging from mi
nors' universally-acknowledged legal sta
tus to the experiences of other states.
Parents deserve the right to know when
their daughters undergo abortion proce
dures because they know and care for her
the most. The U.S. Supreme Court has rec
ognized that parents evaluate and select
better health-care providers than minors do
and that "minors often lack the experience,
perspective and judgment to recognize and
avoid choices that could be detrimental to
them." Parental involvement can also pro
tect minors from unsanitary and unsafe
abortion clinics, like those exposed in The
Seattle Times and The Los Angeles limes.
If notified, parents can proavide essen

tial medical history to the physician and will
know to look for signs of post-abortion
complications, for which they will be held
financially responsible should medical at
tention be required. Minors are minors in
the eyes of the law because society does not
yet consider them mature enough to make
important decisions regarding health and
safety. There is no reason that abortion
should be an exception to this legal status.
Prop. 73 will increase minors' protec
tion from sexual assault. Older men consis
tently exploit young girls and use secret
abortions to cover up their crimes. A study
of 46,000 pregnancies of California girls
aged 10-18 revealed that 71 percent were
caused by non-peer, adult men whose
mean age was 22.6 years. The primary ben
eficiaries of Rosen's concern for the mi
nors' "privacy" are not the victims of this
exploitation but the perpetrators.
Parental involvement curbs these abu
sive relationships and promotes sexual re
sponsibility. Parental notification laws
have been shown to lower not only teen
abortion rates, but also teen preg
nancy rates. A study by the Western
Economic Association International
in 1994 states that, on average,
parental involvement laws reduce
the rate of adolescent pregnancies
by 8 percent. The Center for Disease
Control reports that, following a
parental consent law enacted in
1992, the rate of teen pregnancies in
Pennsylvania's 15- to 19-year-olds
dropped 15.3 percent from 1992 to
1995; similar declines following tlje
enactment of parental consent laws
have been seen in Louisiana, Mon

tana and Massachusetts.
Young girls are understandably re
luctant to inform their parents of the
upsetting news of a pregnancy. How
ever. the vast majority of parents will
provide their daughters with the sup
port that only a parent — not a
stranger who profits from abortions
— can give. Because unplanned
pregnancy and abortion are serious
issues, there is a significant tempta
tion for young teens — even from
the best of families — to secretly ob
tain an abortion in order to avoid up
setting their parents. But this natural
reluctance indicates the need for the
law. not a problem with it.
In the rare case where a minor's
fear of parental abuse is founded.
Prop. 73 allows for her to confiden
tially petition the juvenile court fora

waiver. If evidence of an abusive
family situation is demonstrated, the
court will provide this waiver in a
timely manner and notify a child
protection agency. Under the cur
rent system, young victims undergo
secret procedures and often quietly
return to the same abusive environ
ment.
It's common sense that when par
ents are involved in their daughters'
lives, teenage girls make better
choices about their health and well
being. Don't let abortion providers
fool you with their money-making
agenda. Vote "Yes" on Prop. 73.

Lynne Rosen's faulty analysis of Propo
sition 73 in last Friday's op-ed ("Prop. 73
would have dire consequences," Oct. 14)
does an injustice to those who seek the best
support for minors contemplating an abor
tion.The passage of Prop. 73 would provide
teenage women seeking an abortion sup
port and advice for better health care, as
evidenced by reasons ranging from mi
nors' universally-acknowledged legal sta
tus to the experiences of other states.
Parents deserve the right to know when
their daughters undergo abortion proce
dures because they know and care for her
the most. The U.S. Supreme Court has rec
ognized that parents evaluate and select
better health-care providers than minors do
and that "minors often lack the experience,
perspective and judgment to recognize and
avoid choices that could be detrimental to
them." Parental involvement can also pro
tect minors from unsanitary and unsafe
abortion clinics, like those exposed in The
Seattle Times and The Los Angeles limes.
If notified, parents can proavide essen

tial medical history to the physician and will
know to look for signs of post-abortion
complications, for which they will be held
financially responsible should medical at
tention be required. Minors are minors in
the eyes of the law because society does not
yet consider them mature enough to make
important decisions regarding health and
safety. There is no reason that abortion
should be an exception to this legal status.
Prop. 73 will increase minors' protec
tion from sexual assault. Older men consis
tently exploit young girls and use secret
abortions to cover up their crimes. A study
of 46,000 pregnancies of California girls
aged 10-18 revealed that 71 percent were
caused by non-peer, adult men whose
mean age was 22.6 years. The primary ben
eficiaries of Rosen's concern for the mi
nors' "privacy" are not the victims of this
exploitation but the perpetrators.
Parental involvement curbs these abu
sive relationships and promotes sexual re
sponsibility. Parental notification laws
have been shown to lower not only teen
abortion rates, but also teen preg
nancy rates. A study by the Western
Economic Association International
in 1994 states that, on average,
parental involvement laws reduce
the rate of adolescent pregnancies
by 8 percent. The Center for Disease
Control reports that, following a
parental consent law enacted in
1992, the rate of teen pregnancies in
Pennsylvania's 15- to 19-year-olds
dropped 15.3 percent from 1992 to
1995; similar declines following tlje
enactment of parental consent laws
have been seen in Louisiana, Mon

tana and Massachusetts.
Young girls are understandably re
luctant to inform their parents of the
upsetting news of a pregnancy. How
ever. the vast majority of parents will
provide their daughters with the sup
port that only a parent — not a
stranger who profits from abortions
— can give. Because unplanned
pregnancy and abortion are serious
issues, there is a significant tempta
tion for young teens — even from
the best of families — to secretly ob
tain an abortion in order to avoid up
setting their parents. But this natural
reluctance indicates the need for the
law. not a problem with it.
In the rare case where a minor's
fear of parental abuse is founded.
Prop. 73 allows for her to confiden
