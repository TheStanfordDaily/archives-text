## Vote 'yes' on Prop. 73 
### NOELLE PATNO 
Lynne Rosen's faulty analysis of Propo
sition 73 in last Friday's op-ed ("Prop. 73
would have dire consequences," Oct. 14)
does an injustice to those who seek the best
support for minors contemplating an abor
tion.The passage of Prop. 73 would provide
teenage women seeking an abortion sup
port and advice for better health care, as
evidenced by reasons ranging from mi
nors' universally-acknowledged legal sta
tus to the experiences of other states.
Parents deserve the right to know when
their daughters undergo abortion proce
dures because they know and care for her
the most. The U.S. Supreme Court has rec
ognized that parents evaluate and select
better health-care providers than minors do
and that "minors often lack the experience,
perspective and judgment to recognize and
avoid choices that could be detrimental to
them." Parental involvement can also pro
tect minors from unsanitary and unsafe
abortion clinics, like those exposed in The
Seattle Times and The Los Angeles limes.
If notified, parents can proavide essen

tial medical history to the physician and will
know to look for signs of post-abortion
complications, for which they will be held
financially responsible should medical at
tention be required. Minors are minors in
the eyes of the law because society does not
yet consider them mature enough to make
important decisions regarding health and
safety. There is no reason that abortion
should be an exception to this legal status.
Prop. 73 will increase minors' protec
tion from sexual assault. Older men consis
tently exploit young girls and use secret
abortions to cover up their crimes. A study
of 46,000 pregnancies of California girls
aged 10-18 revealed that 71 percent were
caused by non-peer, adult men whose
mean age was 22.6 years. The primary ben
eficiaries of Rosen's concern for the mi
nors' "privacy" are not the victims of this
exploitation but the perpetrators.
Parental involvement curbs these abu
sive relationships and promotes sexual re
sponsibility. Parental notification laws
have been shown to lower not only teen
