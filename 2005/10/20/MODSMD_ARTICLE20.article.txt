University has alternatives to
Yahoo! Music service
The Stanford Daily's editorial board says
that the agreement between Yahoo! and Stan
ford to provide a free music subscription serv
ice is "music to its ears" ("New download serv
ice is music to our cars," Oct. 18). Putting aside
the rather lame and expected play on words, I
find it amusing that the editorial board would
support a service that completely locks out 20
percent of Stanford students and excludes iPod
owners. If the University really wants to de
crease piracy on this campus, I would imagine
that it would try to do so by using a service that
caters to a majority of students.
Instead of subscribing to the Yahoo! service.
Stanford has two other easy solutions. First, it
could go with the obvious choice. iTUnes. Con
trary to popular belief, Apple provides volume
discounts on songs sold through mines to edu
cational institutions. iTUnes would be usable by
the majority of students on campus and would
allow students to retain their songs indefinitely
after they download them. Stanford could even
set up a system where students could indicate
whether or not they want to pay for songs (at the
discounted price) and how many songs they
wished to purchase. That way, those who don't
use iTunes or the iPod won't be forced
to pay fora service they don't use.
Better yet, Stanford could just live
and let live.The University should sim
ply warn students of the consequences
of illegally downloading music.

Lack of KFC in Palo Alto
encouraging to animal lover
Adam Bad Wound's column
"Chicken pot pie of loneliness" (Oct.
19) lamented the closing of the Palo
Alto KFC with absolutely no recogni
tion of the efforts of countless people
to raise awareness of the revolting
abuse of animal rights by the compa
ny. While 1 am unaware of the exact

reasons behind the KFC shutdown
here in Palo Alto, 1 applaud the clos
ing of any branch of a company that
so blatantly engages in the violent
treatment and killing of livestock.
Videotapes released by the media
in 2004 revealed widespread grue
some practices against chickens that
were being conducted in KFC-supply
ing slaughterhouses. Animal-rights
rallies continue at KFC stores all over
the country, calling fora stop to the
abuses. From my own standpoint, I
find the corporation's use of growth
hormones (which they claim have no
significant effect on human health)
and general dehumanizing policy to
ward low-wage workers appalling.
Stanford students should all be
aware not only of the goods provid
ed by large corporations near their
homes, but also of the social and po
litical consequences of welcoming or
rejecting such organizations from
their community.
