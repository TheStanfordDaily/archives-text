In the article,"New Arrillaga cen
ter opens, faces criticism," published
on Oct. 18, The Daily inaccurately
reported that the new center was
called the Arrillaga Family Recre
ation Center, when in fact, the name
was changed prior to the dedication
and opening to the Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation.
