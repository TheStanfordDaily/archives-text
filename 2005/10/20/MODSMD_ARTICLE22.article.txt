## MIXING IT UP Stanford women tinker with doubles lineups in preparation for ITA Regionals

"I'm still readjusting to the way college tennis runs."
-JESSICA NGUYEN

After clinching the ITA Northwest
Regional Championship doubles title for
the last three years, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team hopes it can mix
things up this year and still come out on
top.
In 2004, senior Alice Barnes won the
Northwest accolade with doubles partner
Erin Burdette, who graduated in June.
Starting this Friday, Barnes plans to
mount a repeat attempt with junior Anne
Yelsey.
Yelsey and Barnes stand at an un
telling 1-1 for this season and only com
peted together in one tournament last
year, after Burdette was sidelined with an
aggravated wrist injury.
But four matches at the Pacific-10
Conference Tournament last April were
all it took for the spur-of-the-moment
pairing to capture a title. Barnes and
Yelsey ousted league rivals Dianne Hol
lands and Maja Mlakar of Arizona, 8-1, to
clinch the final in Ojai, Calif.
The regional stage is now set at Stan
ford's own Taube Family Tennis Stadium,
and three more fledgling Cardinal duos
aim to test their mettle.
"We have some new doubles teams
we're debuting," said Stanford head
coach Lele Forood. "They're not final,
[as] we have some players battling some
injuries."
Aspiring professional Amber Liu. a
senior, teams up with Celia Durkin. a
sophomore transfer from Harvard. Joan
na Kao, also a senior, takes on the action
atTaube with freshman Meghan Doheny.
and junior Theresa Logar is scheduled to
compete with freshman Jessica Nguyen.
Nguyen recently got her first taste of
collegiate tennis at the ITA All-Ameri
can Championship earlier this month, in
which she and Durkin lost in the qualifier.
Nguyen and Durkin (1-1) soundly defeat
ed Texas Tech's Tara Browning and
Lakann Wagley, 8-3. but lost to a team
from North Carolina in their subsequent
match.
"It was kind of a new experience see
ing all the players from different schools."
Nguyen said. "I think we could have
played better, but I'm still readjusting to
the way college tennis runs."
Nguyen added that she enjoys the sup
portive and enriching ways in which Stan
ford runs its team practices. The native of
Chatsworth. Calif., pegged Stanford's em
phasis on rigorous academics and sports
as "the best of both worlds" and is excited
about tackling more challenges at the
Northwest Regional.
"It's my first time playing [both] sin
gles and doubles at a college tourna
ment," Nguyen said.
Even veterans like Barnes are re

vamping their approach to the Northwest
tournament. After her solid performance
at All-American. Barnes has already re
ceived a berth into next month's highly
anticipated ITA National Indoor tourna
ment.
Barnes will steer clear of the singles
arena at Regionals for the first time in her
career. The 5-foot-9 finesse player hopes
to focus the additional tournament down
time onto improving her doubles strategy.
"One good thing about [not playing
singles] is that the doubles teams get to go

first [this year)," Barnes said. "Otherwise,
you just wait around between [preceding
singles] matches and get kind of slug
gish."
While Barnes (3-1). who has played in
a high-stakes No. 2 singles slot for the last
two years, is on temporary singles leave,
Logar and teammate Lejla Hodzic have
their sights set on some epic individual
showdowns.
Logar (1-1) is seeded second in the
event, while Hodzic, a sophomore, kicks
off her season as the No. 3 seed.

While the Cardinal are no stranger to
being top-ranked in their events,expecta
tions for Stanford have soared this year.
Many of the region's upper echelon play
ers, including California's Suzi Babos and
Barnes, performed well enough at Ail-
American to receive their Indoor bids
and can now choose to forego the fracas
at Regional.
Forood takes pride in Stanford's ele
vated status.
"Consider it an enhanced opportunity
for [these players]," she said.
