## Cycling club unites new and veteran riders Mountain bike team ranked fifth in nation

In a community where facing bicycle traffic is
sometimes as likely as hitting car traffic, the members
of Stanford's cycling club are very much at home.
What sets the team's members apart from the average
bicycle commuters on campus, however, is their com
mitment to this sport as a form of serious athletic com
petition.
Laying claim to one of the top cycling programs in
the intercollegiate racing scene, Stanford cycling's re
cent history is not without its share of accomplish
ments. The club has captured three national champi
onships and produced three Olympians, as well as 18
All-Americans,all within the last decade.
While this success may seem overwhelming, the
club welcomes all interested riders, regardless of expe
rience or skill-level, and therefore facilitates quite a
range of competitors. There are members who join the
club already highly skilled and highly competitive —
like sophomore road racing captain Rand Miller, a se
rious rider in high school, whose college decision
making process factored in the amount of serious cy
cling at prospective universities. On the other hand,
many start out as beginners and work their way up to
a more competitive level. In fact, this year's mountain
biking team includes 14 riders who participated in
their first races just this past month.
Graduate student and mountain bike captain Dan
McGarry specifically encourages recreational riders,
regardless of race experience, to join one of the club's
group rides and perhaps later enter one of the races.
"I firmly believe that people who enjoy riding their
bikes recreationally would really enjoy themselves if
they tried racing," McGarry said.
The cycling club is involved in races throughout the
entire year, though there are separate seasons for dif
ferent types of biking.The road racing team competes
during the spring season, while the mountain bike
team is currently in the middle of league competition.
This allows team members to compete in both types of
cycling, though many prefer one over the other.
Miller and McGarry each claim to have a prefer
ence for their particular specialties. Nevertheless, both
captains are familiar with both types of riding, since, as
McGarry claims, the two are "just different disciplines
but the same sport at heart."
Stanford's mountain bike team has had four major
races since the beginning of the season. These compe
titions have seen both individual and team success,
and the team is currently in fifth place out of the 18
teams in the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference
— a decent position fora team in the midst of rebuild
ing after losing a number of riders to graduation last
year.
With the completion of its most recent competition
this past weekend, the last National Qualifying race at
Stanford, the mountain bike team is now preparing for
two more major races. Scheduled for Oct. 28-30, the
NCAA Nationals are held in Seven Springs, Penn.,
and conference championships are in UC-Davis, Nov.
12-13.
