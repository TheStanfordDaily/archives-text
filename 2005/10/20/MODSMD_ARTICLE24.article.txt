# Choosing Leland's successor wisely gives football a chance at success
## 
### 
Two weeks ago, a monumental event in
Stanford sports history occurred as
Ted Leland resigned his post as the di
rector of Cardinal athletics.
While the event invoked a flurry of re
sponses, the discussion over Leland's re
placement has become relatively quiet over
the past week and a half. I was going to write
about it last week, but I too got caught in the
lull.
I will admit that I am not the foremost ex
pert on the administrative dealings of Stan
ford's Athletics Department. And aside from
hiring and firing coaches, raising money and
designing projects to update or build new
sports facilities, I am not sure what else the
director does.
However, I do know that hiring Leland's
replacement will play a decisive role in the
future of all Stanford athletics. I do know that
an AD becomes ultimately responsible for
the success of a school's sports program.
They get hired and fired just like their coach
es. I also know that athletic directors can turn
even the most terrible programs around
(read: Cal football before Tedford) with one
wave of the magic wand.
Before I talk about Leland's successor, I

want to acknowledge his success at Stanford.
He oversaw the program that won 11 straight
Director's Cups, the award given to the top
athletics school in the country, while running
one of the nation's cleanest programs. He
spearheaded the development of a number
of state-of-the-art sports facilities â€” includ
ing the renovation of Maples Pavilion and
the construction of a new football stadium
set to open next fall. His work landed Stan
ford on the cover of Sports Illustrated as an
athletic powerhouse.
Leland admits that he would like to have
added a consistent winning football pro
gram to his legacy, but I guess you can't win
them all. Still, the new AD should build
upon Leland's work to keep the Director's

Cup at Stanford.
My own criteria for the new AD are the
following:
I.The most important criterion: Running
a clean program. Stanford has been success
ful in balancing athletic success without
breaking any NCAA regulations. An AD
who runs a clean program generally hires
people who run clean programs. I imagine
the search committee will (as it should) out
right reject anyone with even a speck of dirt
on his or her resume.
2. Keeping Stanford sports diverse. One of
the unique aspects of Stanford is that we are
not a "football" school or a "basketball"
school. But all sports arc equally valued by
the Athletics Department on the Farm.
3. Continue fundraising to keep sports fa
cilities. Leland did an excellent job maintain
ing and expanding facilities. His successor
should do the same.
4. Revamp the football program. Ah. you
knew I was going to go there. Football is the
big money sport at any school, generating
revenue that supports other athletics pro
grams. With a shiny new stadium to be con
structed. the football program should merit
high consideration in the AD search.

Despite a trip to the Rose Bowl during his
tenure, Leland had his share of problems
with football. We'll start with Leland's ill-ad
vised decision to hire Buddy Teevens in spite
of Buddy's losing record at Ttilane (inciden
tally it was Cal's current AD Sandy Barbour
who fired Buddy there). I do think Leland
rectified that mistake by hiring Walt Harris,
but it will take significant work from the new
AD to resurrect Cardinal football.
The new AD must also serve as an advo
cate for the football program. I was discon
certed a few years ago when Leland essen
tially defined Stanford as a "niche" program
(translation: we won't spend big money on
coaches).
Moreover, re-read the press releases from
last year's hiring process. There was never a
statement that committed the Athletics De
partment to producing an "elite" program or
a "top" program. There were no "We want to
win the Pac-10" statements. Even if such a
goal seams unfeasible, I think the depart
ment should strive to achieve it.
I would like the new AD to say "we will do
everything in our power to make Stanford a
consistent bowl contender. We will work
closely with coach Harris, make a case to ad

missions about the needs of the football team
and market the program until people are
dreaming about Stanford football."
Alright, maybe it's me who dreams too
much.
Does such a perfect candidate exist? Hon
estly, I own a crystal ball, but it can't predict
the future. Aside from hiring Sandy Barbour
(two birds with one stone), I'd try to hire the
person who meets the aforementioned crite
ria. It doesn't matter if that person is residing
in Stanford's own Athletics Department or if
we need to bring in an outsider (current Yale
AD Tom Beckett fits the criteria).
Remember. Stanford has the top Athlet
ics Department in the country with a rela
tively big athletics endowment and state-of
the-art facilities (thank you. Ted Leland) so
there better be some qualified candidates
considered for the position.
Leland's departure made big news, but
I m hoping his successor makes Cardinal ath
letics even bigger news in the near future.
