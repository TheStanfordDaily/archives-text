## Men take the court at Santa Clara Regional Corkery to rest easy in doubles, seek singles berth to National Indoors 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As this weekend approaches, the
players are ready and the competi
tion is fierce. At the ITA Regional
Championships, the Stanford men's
tennis team is prepared for stiff op
position from other schools, in addi
tion to the challenge of battling one
another for the individual title. The
Cardinal plan to showcase their
depth on one stage for the first time
this season, as the team sent its play
ers to two different tournaments in
the opening weekend.
Santa Clara plays host to the Re
gional Championships for the North
west, while another region's tourney
is scheduled at Pepperdine. Partici
pants at the Pepperdine event in
clude Southern California and de
fending NCAA champion, UCLA.
These tournaments decide which
players are offered berths into the
elite National Indoor Champi
onships, to be held Nov. 3-6 in Colum
bus, Ohio. In most regions, both the
winner and the runner-up of the sin
gles and doubles draws are offered
spots in the National Indoors. How
ever, because the West Coast has two
separate regional tournaments, only
those victorious in the finals can earn
places in the November contest.
Because of their appearance in
the semifinals of the All-Americans
at the beginning of this month, senior
KC Corkery and junior James Pade
have already qualified for the dou
bles draw of the National Indoors.
Similarly, freshman Matt Bruch's
stunning semifinal showing also
paved the path for his entry into the
singles draw.
Because the season is still young,
other doubles combinations have yet
to be formed, so head coach John
Whitlinger plans to use this weekend
to gauge possible duos.
"This is going to be a good tourna

ment to see the doubles situation,"
Whitlinger said. "There are some
known factors like James and KC as
well as some unknowns. We have
some very good doubles players, and
this is a start to see who fits well to
gether."
In addition to the three players
who have already qualified in their
respective events. Stanford plans to
send its remaining players to com
pete in the regional tournament with
schools such as California, Washing
ton, Oregon and Pacific. Many Car
dinal players have already competed
in Santa Clara this month, posting
notable results during the Bronco
Classic two weekends ago.
An all-Stanford final in the A
flight draw of the Bronco Classic be
tween sophomore Phil Kao and
freshman Blake Muller is one exam
ple of the depth Stanford possesses
this year. Senior Jon Wong and soph
omore Chris Rasmussen advanced
to the semifinals of one of the dou
bles draws, while two Cardinal pairs
won their respective consolation
draws.
While Stanford's results from the
Bronco Classic may indicate that age
and experience prove valuable in
garnering results, Rasmussen was
quick to point out first-year Bruch's
performance during the All-Ameri
cans.
"I think that experience definite
ly helps a little bit, but there are a lot
more factors than how many times
you've been out on the court before,"
Rasmussen said.
Whitlinger shared similar senti
ments and stated that in addition to
figuring out doubles combinations,
the Regional tournament will be an
opportunity to evaluate the more sea
soned players as well as the new ones.
"I want to see how guys handle
pressure when things aren't going
well in a match,"Whitlinger said."lt'll
be a learning experience for all of us."

Corkery, the team veteran, leads
the Cardinal in the preseason rank
ings at No. 8. The Manhattan Beach.
Calif., native looks to qualify for the
singles draw this weekend. In 2(M)4,
Corkery's charge at the Regional
Championships was halted by Cal's
Lennart Mack in straight sets during
the semifinals.

In addition to No. 52 Mack, other
ranked singles players include Wash
ington's No. 23 Alex Slovic and No.
39 Arnar Sigurdsson of IJOP. In
2004. Slovic earned a spot in the Na
tional Indoors and advanced to the
Round of 16 before falling in three
sets to UCLA's Ben Kohlloeffel.
"We have a really talented team,

and we're going to have some real
dogfights for positions," Whitlinger
said. "That's when your teams are
best, when everybody's pushing
everybody else. Nobody wants to let
up because the guy behind him will
blow right by."
Rasmussen agrees that Stanford's
lineup is deep but the sophomore re

mains cautious.
"I definitely think that the team is
deeper than it's been in the past two
years." Rasmussen said. "But we've
still got some stiff competition ahead
of us. We're getting along really well
and are optimistic about the season,
but all the top teams have a lot of
depth as well."

pete in the regional tournament with
schools such as California, Washing
ton, Oregon and Pacific. Many Car
dinal players have already competed
in Santa Clara this month, posting
notable results during the Bronco
Classic two weekends ago.
An all-Stanford final in the A
flight draw of the Bronco Classic be
tween sophomore Phil Kao and
freshman Blake Muller is one exam
ple of the depth Stanford possesses
this year. Senior Jon Wong and soph
omore Chris Rasmussen advanced
to the semifinals of one of the dou
bles draws, while two Cardinal pairs
won their respective consolation
draws.
While Stanford's results from the
Bronco Classic may indicate that age
and experience prove valuable in
garnering results, Rasmussen was
quick to point out first-year Bruch's
performance during the All-Ameri
cans.
"I think that experience definite
ly helps a little bit, but there are a lot
more factors than how many times
you've been out on the court before,"
Rasmussen said.
Whitlinger shared similar senti
ments and stated that in addition to
figuring out doubles combinations,
the Regional tournament will be an
opportunity to evaluate the more sea
soned players as well as the new ones.
"I want to see how guys handle
pressure when things aren't going
well in a match,"Whitlinger said."lt'll
be a learning experience for all of us."

Corkery, the team veteran, leads
the Cardinal in the preseason rank
ings at No. 8. The Manhattan Beach.
Calif., native looks to qualify for the
singles draw this weekend. In 2(M)4,
Corkery's charge at the Regional
Championships was halted by Cal's
Lennart Mack in straight sets during
the semifinals.

In addition to No. 52 Mack, other
ranked singles players include Wash
ington's No. 23 Alex Slovic and No.
39 Arnar Sigurdsson of IJOP. In
2004. Slovic earned a spot in the Na
tional Indoors and advanced to the
Round of 16 before falling in three
sets to UCLA's Ben Kohlloeffel.
"We have a really talented team,

and we're going to have some real
dogfights for positions," Whitlinger
said. "That's when your teams are
best, when everybody's pushing
everybody else. Nobody wants to let
up because the guy behind him will
blow right by."
Rasmussen agrees that Stanford's
lineup is deep but the sophomore re

mains cautious.
"I definitely think that the team is
deeper than it's been in the past two
years." Rasmussen said. "But we've
still got some stiff competition ahead
of us. We're getting along really well
and are optimistic about the season,
but all the top teams have a lot of
depth as well."

Stanford will encounter familiar competition this weekend in Santa Clara, facing a number of conference foes, including California, Washington and Oregon.
As this weekend approaches, the
players are ready and the competi
tion is fierce. At the ITA Regional
Championships, the Stanford men's
tennis team is prepared for stiff op
position from other schools, in addi
tion to the challenge of battling one
another for the individual title. The
Cardinal plan to showcase their
depth on one stage for the first time
this season, as the team sent its play
ers to two different tournaments in
the opening weekend.
Santa Clara plays host to the Re
gional Championships for the North
west, while another region's tourney
is scheduled at Pepperdine. Partici
pants at the Pepperdine event in
clude Southern California and de
fending NCAA champion, UCLA.
These tournaments decide which
players are offered berths into the
elite National Indoor Champi
onships, to be held Nov. 3-6 in Colum
bus, Ohio. In most regions, both the
winner and the runner-up of the sin
gles and doubles draws are offered
spots in the National Indoors. How
ever, because the West Coast has two
separate regional tournaments, only
those victorious in the finals can earn
places in the November contest.
Because of their appearance in
the semifinals of the All-Americans
at the beginning of this month, senior
KC Corkery and junior James Pade
have already qualified for the dou
bles draw of the National Indoors.
Similarly, freshman Matt Bruch's
stunning semifinal showing also
paved the path for his entry into the
singles draw.
Because the season is still young,
other doubles combinations have yet
to be formed, so head coach John
Whitlinger plans to use this weekend
to gauge possible duos.
"This is going to be a good tourna

ment to see the doubles situation,"
Whitlinger said. "There are some
known factors like James and KC as
well as some unknowns. We have
some very good doubles players, and
this is a start to see who fits well to
gether."
