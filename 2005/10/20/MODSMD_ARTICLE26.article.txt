### BRIAN SKOLOFF ASSOCIATED PRESS 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) â€”
The scene was almost familiar, like
the crime scene photos of messy
murders he's seen time and again.
This time, it was his own wife.
"She fought back very hard.That
was very obvious from the scene,"
defense attorney and legal analyst
Daniel Horowitz said Wednesday.
"I saw the wounds to the head that
killed her and the rest just looked
like a fight that she might have
even been winning. That coward
needed a weapon to beat her ... It
just looked like a crime scene
photo I've seen over and over."
Horowitz returned to his rural
hilltop estate in the upscale San
Francisco suburb of Lafayette on
Saturday evening and reported
finding the body of his wife, Pamela
Vitale. Authorities say she was
beaten to death.
On Wednesday, Horowitz visit
ed the home to collect photographs
and clothing, worked on his wife's
eulogy and sat for television inter
views, calling his life "a I\vilight
Zone hell."
Ironically, Horowitz was in the
midst of a murder trial, represent
ing 47-year-old Susan Polk, ac
cused of beating and stabbing her
husband to death. Just last week
during opening statements, he
flashed pictures on a screen for ju
rors of the dead man's bloodied
body, pointing out a gash on the top
of his head, and his battered and
beaten face.
Now, those pictures are of his
wife, and Horowitz has not been

ruled out as a suspect. A judge de
clared a mistrial in the murder case.
Horowitz rose to quasi-fame as
a cable news commentator during
the Scott Peterson murder trial.
Police haven't made an arrest,
and have questioned dozens of
people, including Horowitz and
Joseph Lynch, who lived on the
property where Horowitz and his
wife were building a massive 7.000-
square-foot estate. Horowitz had
taken out a restraining order
against the 54-year-old Lynch, de
scribing him as a drug addict who
had harassed the couple, but the
order was never served.
Contra Costa County sheriffs
spokesman Jimmy Lee has called
Lynch a "point of interest."
Lee did not return repeated calls
from The Associated Press on
Wednesday. A message on his of
fice telephone says, "We have no
further comment at this time and
are not available for interviews or
talk shows."
Authorities have also questioned
people involved in the Polk murder
case, including Susan Polk's son,
Eli, said Ivan Golde, who served as
co-counsel with Horowitz.
"They just asked him where he
was," Golde said Wednesday.
"Until there's an arrest, everyone's
a suspect."
Local criminal defense attorney
Barry Morris was also questioned.
He was set to be a prosecution wit
ness in the Polk case because he
knew the victim.
"They're talking to everyone
who had a relationship here," Mor
ris said, adding that he offered po
lice an alibi. "That was one of many

questions they asked me. 1 '
Recalling the scene from Satur
day, Horowitz said he approached
the front door of the trailer home
where the couple had been living
on the property and noticed the
door was smeared with something
dark.
"At that point I saw her and I just
collapsed," he said, adding that she
was wearing nothing but under
wear and a T-shirt. "The reality hit
and I just started screaming... from
the deepest part of my soul, 'My
baby, my baby!'
"At this point, there's just hope,
and I touch her to see if there's any
pulse, even though I know there
isn't, but I'm going to do it any
way," he continued.
Horowitz called police then re
turned to the body, he said.
"All I remember is just looking
at Pamela's face..." He paused and
sobbed uncontrollably, heaving
and hissing. "My sweet Pamela!"
he wailed.
Horowitz said he can't imagine
who would want his wife dead.
"It had to be somebody who
knew us and knew our schedule
and our house and our property,"
he said.
Asked if he thought Lynch could
be responsible, Horowitz would
only say,"l just want the right per
son caught." Lynch has denied in
volvement.
On Wednesday, Horowitz made
the television rounds and prepared
for his wife's private funeral,set for
Thursday.
"I don't know what I'm going to
do. I'm going to be dying today," he
said. "It's still not real."
