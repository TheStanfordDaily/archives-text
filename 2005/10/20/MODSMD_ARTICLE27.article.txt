### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
VACAVILLE, Calif. (AP) â€”A
young brother and sister were killed
and 11 other people were injured yes
terday when a speeding car struck a
parked car, and both vehicles car
omed onto a sidewalk near an ele
mentary school, Vacaville police said.
The driver, 24-year-old David Bell
of Fairfield, was held on two counts of
murder in the deaths of the siblings,
ages 7 and 9, said Lt. Craig Rossiter.
TTie names of the other children were
not immediately released.The 11 oth
ers were all school children except for
one adult, Rossiter said.
The crash happened about 2:15
p.m. as students were leaving Eu
gene Padan Elementary School,
Rossiter said.
Bell was arrested after he was
treated for minor injuries, Rossiter
said. Police found no drugs or alcohol
in his vehicle, a Ford Taurus, but are
awaiting the results of blood tests.
Bell was traveling at a high rate of
speed in a 25 mph zone past both Va
caville Christian School and Padan El
ementary when he struck a parked car,
Rossiter said. One or both struck the
victims walking on a sidewalk, he said.
"He had to be going very fast.
There was very major damage to the

rear of a Camaro and it went a good
100 feet" before stopping, Rossiter
said. "It was certainly not something
you could predict. Probably most
people would not be able to jump out
of the way."
The area sees few accidents, if only
because of the traffic congestion
when school lets out for the day,

Rossiter said.
There was no immediate informa
tion available about the seriousness
of the others' injuries, though
Rossiter said he believed there was at
least one other severe injury. School
officials were arranging to provide
for the emotional reaction of the
school's staff and students.
