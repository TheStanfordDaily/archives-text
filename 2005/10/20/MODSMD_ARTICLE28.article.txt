# OSU football cracks down on scandal

### ANNE M. PETERSON AP SPORTS WRITER 
(AP) â€” A rash of student-athlete
misconduct at Oregon State has
prompted coach Mike Riley to im
plement more severe punishments
for players who get into trouble with
alcohol or drugs.
The latest incident involved the al
cohol-related death of an 18-year-old
visiting the campus. Three football
players were indicted on misde
meanor charges connected to the case.
Riley, known for giving his players
the benefit of the doubt, said players
involved in alcohol or drug-related
incidents will be immediately sus
pended.
"We've had our share of rather
public problems over the last six
months," Riley said.'i don't think it's
totally unusual in this society, howev
er, we just got to the point where I
said enough's enough and if there's
anybody who is basically charged

with anything that has to do with al
cohol or drugs they'd be suspended."
This fall, Oregon State had adopt
ed a new disciplinary policy for stu
dent-athletes, which included imme
diate suspension for felony charges.
The policy targeted five areas of
misconduct: driving under the influ
ence, minor in possession of alcohol,
possession of a controlled substance,
physical assault and sexual offenses.
The penalties ranged in severity.
For driving under the influence,
there was a minimum suspension
from 10 percent of the team's games
or competitions for the first offense.
A basketball player, for instance,
would miss three games.
Riley's new policy takes a
stronger stance with no questions
asked.
Last April, sophomore defensive
lineman Joe Rudulph pleaded guilty
to assaulting an Oregon National
Guardsman on leave from Iraq. He
was sentenced to 10 days in jail.
