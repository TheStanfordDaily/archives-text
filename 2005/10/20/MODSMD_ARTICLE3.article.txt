## Hospital uses ads to attract more patients 
### KAITLIN WOOD 
Stanford Hospital recently announced the
launch of a $2.5 million advertising campaign that
aims at expanding its patient base.
The hospital hopes to notify members of the
community that it not only specializes in major
treatments such as transplantations and brain sur
geries, but that it also has the ability to treat minor
ailments as well.
The hospital's goal is to provide patients with
a wider range of choices when choosing a treat
ment center.
"It's an image and awareness campaign," said
Lee Wills, director of marketing and communica
tions for the Stanford Hospital. "You cannot turn
the television on without seeing an open market,
and what we're doing is allowing customers to
have a choice."
Taking into account the aging baby-boomer
population, health care facilities are becoming fur
ther inundated with medical problems and re
quests for treatment.The hospital hopes to broad
en the scope of the treatments that it provides in
order to accommodate older generations.
According to Wills, there are four types of med
ical care: primary, specialty, tertiary and quater
nary. The hospital is not planning to break into the
primary care sector, but instead is trying to educate
consumers that they have clinics that do offer spe
cialty care, such as treatments for epilepsy and
sleep apnea.
"We're perceived very, very well,and perceived as
giving excellent care," Wills said. "Some customers
think that we only provide excellent care for serious
illnesses. Campaigning provides new awareness."
However, some feel that the Stanford Hospital
may be doing what other academic hospitals are
already trying to do â€” boost their income by in
creasing profitable lines of business.
"Every major medical center is doing this,"
Wanda Jones, a San Francisco-based hospital con
sultant said in the October 14 Business Journal.
"Their prices are so high that they need a lot of
basic care to average out their overhead."
Wills acknowledged that keeping a healthy bot
tom line is important to any business, medical cen
ters included.
"All hospitals including academic hospitals
have to meet a bottom line," she said. "We are pro
viding patient care, but we need to meet the needs
of our aging population."
Students at Stanford seem partial to the idea of
the advertising campaign.
"I think it's a great idea," said freshman
Stephanie Bonovich. who knows several people
who have been treated at the hospital." It not only in
forms people that they have more choices when
choosing a hospital, but it also allows fora more di
verse group of patients to be treated at the facilities."
But some have questioned the cost of the cam
paign in light of current labor negotiations with
hospital workers.
"It's not expensive," Wills said." It's a tiny, tiny frac-
