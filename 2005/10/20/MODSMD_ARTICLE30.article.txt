Not until Pettitte and Clemens
came home to join Oswalt in a stellar
rotation did the Astros get over the
hump.
And on the night it clinched the
NLCS. Houston didn't even need to
use Brad Lidge, the All-Star closer
who gave up Pujols' two-out homer
in the ninth inning Monday night
that sent the series back to St. Louis.
ITie Astros were one strike from
their first World Series before David
Eckstein's single started the rally in
Game 5. Lidge had been voted MVP
