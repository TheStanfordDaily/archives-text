### RON HARRIS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —Rescuers searched
yesterday night for the bodies of at least two young
children who were reportedly tossed into San Francis
co Bay near a popular waterfront attraction, authori
ties said.
A man called 911 at 5:30 p.m. to report that two, and
possibly three, children were dropped from a pier into
the chilly water, said Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White.
The case was being investigated as a homicide.The chil
dren were believed to be underage 10, said Police Chief
Heather Fong.
As darkness fell, a small inflatable Coast Guard
boat hugged the waterfront as rescuers with flashlights
looked under the pier. Larger Coast Guard and city po

lice boats searched the water with high-powered lights.
"The temperature in the water is rather cold,"
Hayes-White said. "It's windy. I'm understanding
there's a strong northerly ebb tide. It would make a res
cue situation very difficult. Very soon it would most
likely be a recovery effort."
Mayor Gavin Newsom arrived fora briefing from
officials at the scene. He would only tell reporters,'Tm
sick to my stomach."
The incident happened at Pier 7 in the Embar
cadero area, which draws tourists to the historic Ferry
Building within view of the landmark Transamerica
pyramid.
The wooden pier — almost as long as three football
fields — extends into water 35 feet deep. The pier is
lined with a wrought-iron fence and was recently refur
bished.
