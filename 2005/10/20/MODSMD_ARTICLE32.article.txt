# Schwarzenegger pushes initiatives
## Many Californians still puzzled by Nov. 8 special election 
### BETH FOUHY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
(AP) — The Nov. 8 special elec
tion called by Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger remains a mystery
to many California voters.
Public opinion polls show they
don't understand its urgency and are
turned off by its $50 million price tag.
But to Schwarzenegger, it's an essen
tial next step to the recall election
that swept him into office in 2003.
And he says its cost is a bargain when
compared to the fiscal and political
changes it will bring if he's successful.
The movie star-turned-governor
sees the special election as simply the
middle chapter of a three-part series
that is needed to turn around Cali
fornia's moribund government.
"Recover, reform and then re
build" is how Schwarzenegger has
cast his mission. He says drastic steps
are needed to fix a political system
that has frequently led the nation's
most populous state into multibillion
dollar budget deficits. The special
election is the centerpiece of what he
has labeled his "year of reform."
His agenda seeks to implement
spending controls and give him au
thority to make midyear budget cuts,
change the way legislative districts
are drawn to increase competition for
seats and limit political contributions
from labor unions, a move that would
weaken Democrats. He also wants to
extend the probationary period for
teachers from two years to five.
Schwarzenegger warns that unless
wholesale changes are made to the
state's political status quo, voters will
not see the kind of fundamental po
litical reform they demanded when
they tossed Democrat Gray Davis
out of office two years ago.
"It's a broken system,"
Schwarzenegger said Wednesday
during a campaign stop in Anaheim.
"And this will be the recall of a bro
ken system."
Convincing voters of that urgency

is his challenge between now and
Election Day, when turnout is ex
pected to be low. How his reform ini
tiatives fare also could determine the
strength of his candidacy as he pre
pares to seek a second term in 2006.
In large part, his agenda is designed
to curb the power of Democratic law
makers and public employee unions,
particularly the powerful California
Teachers Association. He has com
plained that the Legislature's Demo
cratic majority is beholden to unions,
making it virtually impossible to
achieve lasting political reform.
Democrats and public employee
unions have cast the governor's
agenda as a throwback to previous
attempts by Republicans to widen
their influence in a Democrat-lean
ing state. Teachers also are con
cerned that his spending cap propos
al will undo Proposition 98. a 1988
voter initiative that set a minimum
funding guarantee for public schools.
"These measures are all about a
power grab by Governor
Schwarzenegger that hurts our chil
dren, our schools and our teachers,"
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said
Wednesday during a news confer
ence in Washington.
She called on voters to oppose
propositions 74. 75 and 76, dealing
with teacher tenure, union dues and
the budget.
Leading Democrats in the state
Legislature say Schwarzenegger
made no effort to work with them to
develop a bipartisan reform agenda.
Instead, he surprised them with his
plans and the threat of a special elec
tion during his State of the State ad
dress last January.
"I almost feel as though the gov
ernor picked up a grenade and sort
of threw it at the Legislature and ran
away," said Assembly Speaker Fabi
an Nunez, D-Los Angeles.
Schwarzenegger has staked his po
litical capital on his four initiatives,
even though the latest public opinion
polls show him with an uphill battle.
The efforts to redraw legislative
districts and cap state spending are
running well behind, and the teacher
tenure initiative has yet to gain ma
jority support. The measure requir
ing unions to get their members' per

mission before dues could be used
for political purposes appears to
have the strongest support, even
gaining favor among many rank
and-file union members.
The measures have prompted an
aggressive backlash from Democrats
and labor unions, who have spent
nearly $100 million on a televised
campaign to discredit them. Labor
activists frame the campaign as a
contest between a plutocrat gover
nor and ordinary public servants
such as nurses, teachers and firefight
ers whose voices will be silenced if
Schwarzenegger is successful.
The governor's popularity has
plummeted since the attacks began
last spring. He also has struggled to
raise his stated goal of $50 million to
promote the initiatives, with some
business interests reluctant to cross
the state's powerful unions.
Schwarzenegger aides said the
campaign's internal polling shows
the measures are in much better
shape but acknowledge they are run
ning to catch up. The governor re
mains upbeat about his prospects,
despite the public opinion polls.
"It's just the way it is in politics.
I've always said, 'Let them beat up
on me' because 1 don't care. The bot
tom line is I'm fighting for something
much bigger than me, which is to im
prove the state of California and re
form a broken system that is sup
posed to last for years and years and
years," he told reporters Wednesday.
"There's some things that are
worth fighting for, and California is
one of those things."
Several other initiatives also ap
pear on the ballot: Proposition 73,
sponsored by anti-abortion activists,
would require doctors to notify the
parents or guardians of underage
girls seeking an abortion; Proposi
tions 78 and 79 are dueling prescrip
tion drug measures — the former
sponsored by pharmaceutical com
panies, the latter by consumer
groups — to ease the cost of pre
scriptions on low-income residents;
and Proposition 80 would reregulate
the state's electric service providers,
after the 2001 energy crisis that many
analysts blamed on deregulation of
the state's utilities.

ing state. Teachers also are con
cerned that his spending cap propos
al will undo Proposition 98. a 1988
voter initiative that set a minimum
funding guarantee for public schools.
"These measures are all about a
power grab by Governor
Schwarzenegger that hurts our chil
dren, our schools and our teachers,"
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said
Wednesday during a news confer
ence in Washington.
She called on voters to oppose
propositions 74. 75 and 76, dealing
with teacher tenure, union dues and
the budget.
Leading Democrats in the state
Legislature say Schwarzenegger
made no effort to work with them to
develop a bipartisan reform agenda.
Instead, he surprised them with his
plans and the threat of a special elec
tion during his State of the State ad
dress last January.
"I almost feel as though the gov
ernor picked up a grenade and sort
of threw it at the Legislature and ran
away," said Assembly Speaker Fabi
an Nunez, D-Los Angeles.
Schwarzenegger has staked his po
litical capital on his four initiatives,
even though the latest public opinion
polls show him with an uphill battle.
The efforts to redraw legislative
districts and cap state spending are
running well behind, and the teacher
tenure initiative has yet to gain ma
jority support. The measure requir
ing unions to get their members' per

mission before dues could be used
for political purposes appears to
have the strongest support, even
gaining favor among many rank
and-file union members.
The measures have prompted an
aggressive backlash from Democrats
and labor unions, who have spent
nearly $100 million on a televised
campaign to discredit them. Labor
activists frame the campaign as a
contest between a plutocrat gover
nor and ordinary public servants
such as nurses, teachers and firefight
ers whose voices will be silenced if
Schwarzenegger is successful.
The governor's popularity has
plummeted since the attacks began
last spring. He also has struggled to
raise his stated goal of $50 million to
promote the initiatives, with some
business interests reluctant to cross
the state's powerful unions.
Schwarzenegger aides said the
campaign's internal polling shows
the measures are in much better
shape but acknowledge they are run
ning to catch up. The governor re
mains upbeat about his prospects,
despite the public opinion polls.
"It's just the way it is in politics.
I've always said, 'Let them beat up
on me' because 1 don't care. The bot
tom line is I'm fighting for something
much bigger than me, which is to im
prove the state of California and re
form a broken system that is sup
posed to last for years and years and
years," he told reporters Wednesday.
"There's some things that are
worth fighting for, and California is
one of those things."
Several other initiatives also ap
pear on the ballot: Proposition 73,
sponsored by anti-abortion activists,
would require doctors to notify the
parents or guardians of underage
girls seeking an abortion; Proposi
tions 78 and 79 are dueling prescrip
tion drug measures — the former
sponsored by pharmaceutical com
panies, the latter by consumer
groups — to ease the cost of pre
scriptions on low-income residents;
and Proposition 80 would reregulate
the state's electric service providers,
after the 2001 energy crisis that many
analysts blamed on deregulation of
the state's utilities.
(AP) — The Nov. 8 special elec
tion called by Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger remains a mystery
to many California voters.
Public opinion polls show they
don't understand its urgency and are
turned off by its $50 million price tag.
But to Schwarzenegger, it's an essen
tial next step to the recall election
that swept him into office in 2003.
And he says its cost is a bargain when
compared to the fiscal and political
changes it will bring if he's successful.
The movie star-turned-governor
sees the special election as simply the
middle chapter of a three-part series
that is needed to turn around Cali
fornia's moribund government.
"Recover, reform and then re
build" is how Schwarzenegger has
cast his mission. He says drastic steps
are needed to fix a political system
that has frequently led the nation's
most populous state into multibillion
dollar budget deficits. The special
election is the centerpiece of what he
has labeled his "year of reform."
His agenda seeks to implement
spending controls and give him au
thority to make midyear budget cuts,
change the way legislative districts
are drawn to increase competition for
seats and limit political contributions
from labor unions, a move that would
weaken Democrats. He also wants to
extend the probationary period for
teachers from two years to five.
Schwarzenegger warns that unless
wholesale changes are made to the
state's political status quo, voters will
not see the kind of fundamental po
litical reform they demanded when
they tossed Democrat Gray Davis
out of office two years ago.
"It's a broken system,"
Schwarzenegger said Wednesday
during a campaign stop in Anaheim.
"And this will be the recall of a bro
ken system."
Convincing voters of that urgency

is his challenge between now and
Election Day, when turnout is ex
pected to be low. How his reform ini
tiatives fare also could determine the
strength of his candidacy as he pre
pares to seek a second term in 2006.
In large part, his agenda is designed
to curb the power of Democratic law
makers and public employee unions,
particularly the powerful California
Teachers Association. He has com
plained that the Legislature's Demo
cratic majority is beholden to unions,
making it virtually impossible to
achieve lasting political reform.
Democrats and public employee
unions have cast the governor's
agenda as a throwback to previous
attempts by Republicans to widen
their influence in a Democrat-lean
ing state. Teachers also are con
cerned that his spending cap propos
al will undo Proposition 98. a 1988
