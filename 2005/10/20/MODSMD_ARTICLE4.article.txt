## New professorship for classics 
### ARAM HUR 
The Stanford Classics Department recent
ly acquired an endowed professorship estab
lished in honor of former Greek Prime Minis
ter Constantine Mitsotakis. The professorship
will be funded by a $2 million donation made
by theTsakopoulous family of Sacramento.
"The Mitsotakis family is one of the most
extraordinary families that we know," said
Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, one of the
founders of the program. "They all value edu
cation highly and are dedicated to public serv
ice. They are one of the most important politi
cal leaders in the history of Greece."
Mitsotakis served as prime minister of
Greece from 1990 to 1993 after serving in the
Greek Parliament and holding several other
government positions. The whole family is
deeply involved in Greek politics. His daugh
ter Dora Bakoyannis is the current mayor of
Athens while his son, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is a
member of the Greek Parliament. The Mitso
takis family will visit Stanford in the last week
of October to celebrate the launch of the pro
fessorship.
The position is the Tsakopoulous family's

fourth university endowment. Their previous
projects include programs at Georgetown and
Columbia. On why they chose Stanford, the
Northern California residents gave two rea
sons:
"Stanford is an extraordinary cutting-edge
institution." Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis said.
"But what really made it happen was the Uni
versity's cooperative reception of our concep
tual idea for the professorship's goals."
The shared aim for the professorship is to
provide a roster of courses that examine the
resonance of Greek philosophy and values in
modern American culture. Tlie family hopes
that recognition of the connection between
ancient Greece and modern American society
will heighten appreciation for where contem
porary culture is grounded.
"I hope this endowment takes one of the
foundational roots of Western civilization and
keeps it fresh," Tsakopoulous-Kounalakis
said. "Ancient Greece holds a very specific rel
evance to the culture of America. The
founders of our country drew upon many of
the foundations of this period in history."
In addition, the family made a spe
cific request that whoever holds the
professorship be able to reach as
many Stanford students as possible.
In compliance, the Classics Depart
ment devised three classes that will
span a broad range of concentrations
pertaining not only to classics majors,
but also to students of other concen
trations ranging from political science
to mathematics.
"These are new courses that we
designed so they can reach out to
most people," said Prof. Richard Mar
tin, chair of the Classics Department.
"They're not just general introduc
tion courses, but those that really ex

amine the impact that Greek culture
has had on American life in a vast
range of areas from politics, engineer
ing, biology to art."
"New Atlantis" will be the first
course, starting this winter quarter.
Led by Martin, the class will explore
the entire range of Greek thought
from the eighth through fifth cen
turies BC by .making consistent and
explicit comparisons to modern
American political and intellectual
culture, covering major works such as
the"The Iliad", "The Odyssey", "Re
public" and "Antigone."
In a recent press release issued by
the family, Mitsotakis remarked that
he was deeply appreciative of the
honor."
"Our two countries share a com
mon commitment to democracy and
freedom," he said. "I believe that our
continued cooperation, especially in

the area of education, will keep our
shared values alive and strong."
As the first endowment of its kind,
Martin hopes that Stanford's
Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis Professor
ship will serve as a model for other in
stitutions to follow. He said he envi
sions a network of intervarsity pro
grams dedicated to the examination
of Greek roots embedded in modern
society. Meanwhile, the search is un
derway for an acclaimed professor to
cut the inaugural tape of the chair by
this coming fall.
"We are tremendously grateful to
the Tsakopoulos family," Martin
said. "This endowment gives us a
chance to reach out in a way that we
haven't been able to before. We
haven't had big outreach courses
which have examined in detail the
Greek's fundamental contributions
to our society."

porary culture is grounded.
"I hope this endowment takes one of the
foundational roots of Western civilization and
keeps it fresh," Tsakopoulous-Kounalakis
said. "Ancient Greece holds a very specific rel
evance to the culture of America. The
founders of our country drew upon many of
the foundations of this period in history."
In addition, the family made a spe
cific request that whoever holds the
professorship be able to reach as
many Stanford students as possible.
In compliance, the Classics Depart
ment devised three classes that will
span a broad range of concentrations
pertaining not only to classics majors,
but also to students of other concen
trations ranging from political science
to mathematics.
"These are new courses that we
designed so they can reach out to
most people," said Prof. Richard Mar
tin, chair of the Classics Department.
"They're not just general introduc
tion courses, but those that really ex

amine the impact that Greek culture
has had on American life in a vast
range of areas from politics, engineer
ing, biology to art."
"New Atlantis" will be the first
course, starting this winter quarter.
Led by Martin, the class will explore
the entire range of Greek thought
from the eighth through fifth cen
turies BC by .making consistent and
explicit comparisons to modern
American political and intellectual
culture, covering major works such as
the"The Iliad", "The Odyssey", "Re
public" and "Antigone."
In a recent press release issued by
the family, Mitsotakis remarked that
he was deeply appreciative of the
honor."
"Our two countries share a com
mon commitment to democracy and
freedom," he said. "I believe that our
continued cooperation, especially in

the area of education, will keep our
shared values alive and strong."
As the first endowment of its kind,
Martin hopes that Stanford's
Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis Professor
ship will serve as a model for other in
stitutions to follow. He said he envi
sions a network of intervarsity pro
grams dedicated to the examination
of Greek roots embedded in modern
society. Meanwhile, the search is un
derway for an acclaimed professor to
cut the inaugural tape of the chair by
this coming fall.
"We are tremendously grateful to
the Tsakopoulos family," Martin
said. "This endowment gives us a
chance to reach out in a way that we
haven't been able to before. We
haven't had big outreach courses
which have examined in detail the
Greek's fundamental contributions
to our society."
The Stanford Classics Department recent
ly acquired an endowed professorship estab
lished in honor of former Greek Prime Minis
ter Constantine Mitsotakis. The professorship
will be funded by a $2 million donation made
by theTsakopoulous family of Sacramento.
"The Mitsotakis family is one of the most
extraordinary families that we know," said
Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, one of the
founders of the program. "They all value edu
cation highly and are dedicated to public serv
ice. They are one of the most important politi
cal leaders in the history of Greece."
Mitsotakis served as prime minister of
Greece from 1990 to 1993 after serving in the
Greek Parliament and holding several other
government positions. The whole family is
deeply involved in Greek politics. His daugh
ter Dora Bakoyannis is the current mayor of
Athens while his son, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is a
member of the Greek Parliament. The Mitso
takis family will visit Stanford in the last week
of October to celebrate the launch of the pro
fessorship.
The position is the Tsakopoulous family's

fourth university endowment. Their previous
projects include programs at Georgetown and
Columbia. On why they chose Stanford, the
Northern California residents gave two rea
sons:
"Stanford is an extraordinary cutting-edge
institution." Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis said.
"But what really made it happen was the Uni
versity's cooperative reception of our concep
tual idea for the professorship's goals."
The shared aim for the professorship is to
provide a roster of courses that examine the
resonance of Greek philosophy and values in
modern American culture. Tlie family hopes
that recognition of the connection between
ancient Greece and modern American society
will heighten appreciation for where contem
porary culture is grounded.
"I hope this endowment takes one of the
foundational roots of Western civilization and
keeps it fresh," Tsakopoulous-Kounalakis
said. "Ancient Greece holds a very specific rel
evance to the culture of America. The
