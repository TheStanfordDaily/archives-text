## New professorship for classics 
### ARAM HUR 
The Stanford Classics Department recent
ly acquired an endowed professorship estab
lished in honor of former Greek Prime Minis
ter Constantine Mitsotakis. The professorship
will be funded by a $2 million donation made
by theTsakopoulous family of Sacramento.
"The Mitsotakis family is one of the most
extraordinary families that we know," said
Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, one of the
founders of the program. "They all value edu
cation highly and are dedicated to public serv
ice. They are one of the most important politi
cal leaders in the history of Greece."
Mitsotakis served as prime minister of
Greece from 1990 to 1993 after serving in the
Greek Parliament and holding several other
government positions. The whole family is
deeply involved in Greek politics. His daugh
ter Dora Bakoyannis is the current mayor of
Athens while his son, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is a
member of the Greek Parliament. The Mitso
takis family will visit Stanford in the last week
of October to celebrate the launch of the pro
fessorship.
The position is the Tsakopoulous family's

fourth university endowment. Their previous
projects include programs at Georgetown and
Columbia. On why they chose Stanford, the
Northern California residents gave two rea
sons:
"Stanford is an extraordinary cutting-edge
institution." Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis said.
"But what really made it happen was the Uni
versity's cooperative reception of our concep
tual idea for the professorship's goals."
The shared aim for the professorship is to
provide a roster of courses that examine the
resonance of Greek philosophy and values in
modern American culture. Tlie family hopes
that recognition of the connection between
ancient Greece and modern American society
will heighten appreciation for where contem
porary culture is grounded.
"I hope this endowment takes one of the
foundational roots of Western civilization and
keeps it fresh," Tsakopoulous-Kounalakis
said. "Ancient Greece holds a very specific rel
evance to the culture of America. The
founders of our country drew upon many of
the foundations of this period in history."
