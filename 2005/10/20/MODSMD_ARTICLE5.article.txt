# Students rally to get out the vote
## Groups hope to raise awareness of Nov. 8 special election 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Democrats, in partnership with Stanford Stu
dents for Choice, held a noontime Get Out the Vote (GOTV)
rally in White Plaza yesterday to inform, register and empower
students to vote in California's Nov. 8 special election. Under
overcast skies, the organizers managed to gather between 30 and
40 people, with many more passersby briefly stopping to listen.
Stanford Democrats President Margot Isman, a sophomore,
kept the event moving and high energy.
"Let's get registered," she screamed to the crowd of onlook
ers. "Let's get excited. Let's get out and vote!"
Overall, Isman said she was happy with the way the event
turned out and was not dismayed by the less than ideal turnout.
"The rally went very well," she said. "Even if there aren't hun
dreds of people listening to the speeches, it is important that we
have a presence."
While a primary aspect of the GOTV effort is to encourage
voter registration and participation, Isman insisted that her
group's efforts are far-reaching.
"GOTV also means making sure everyone has the informa
tion they need to make an informed decision on their ballot,"
Isman said. "This is an opportunity for students to learn about an
election that might not otherwise be on their radars â€” many
people don't even know there's an election on Nov. 8."
Other speakers included members of the Spoken Word Col
lective, Cynthia Kapphahn of the Northern California Chapter
of the Society for Adolescent Medicine, Steven Aronowitz of
Westly for Governor and the daughter of the California State
Treasurer Phil Angelides.

Angelides will also be running for governor next year.
The Stanford Democrats' Media Relations Officer
Joaquin Hernandez, a sophomore and staff writer for The
Daily, said he believes that the issues the speakers addressed
should be compelling enough reasons for students to want to
get involved.
"Political activism and participation is an integral part of
Stanford student life," he said, "The more participants we can
help register and inform, the more worthwhile our efforts be
come and the farther our message will spread."
In addition to the GOTV rally, the Stanford Democrats are
involved in an exhaustive campaign to encourage people to reg
ister and vote, Hernandez said.
"The Stanford Dems' GOTV rally is part of a larger concert
ed effort to catalyze young political participation at Stanford
and to get college students to register for and participate in one
of our most important and basic civic duties: voting," he said.
"We're also implementing a 'hall captains program' that assigns
Stanford Dems to register other students in their nearby resi
dences for the upcoming election."
According to Hernandez, the hall captains are also in charge
of educating their fellow residents about ballot initiatives.
California registered voters will have an opportunity to vote
on these initiativesTliesday, Nov. 8. Some of the more highly con
tested ballot issues include Prop. 73. which would prohibit abor
tion for minors until 4.X hours after a physician notifies parents
or guardians, and Prop. 77, which would institute a three-mem
ber panel of retired judges in charge of redistricting responsibil
ities for the state of California, according to the California Sec
retary of State's Web site.
Isman said these initiatives call for high voter participation.
"There are issues on the ballot that affect all Californians,"
she said."lt's especially important for our generation to vote be
cause these are initiatives that may affect us for the rest of our
lives."
