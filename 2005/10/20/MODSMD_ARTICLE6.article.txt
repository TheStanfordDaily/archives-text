## UAP looks to remedy peer mentor bills 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Throughout the year, a number of up
perclassmen volunteer their time and
knowledge to mentor small groups of
freshmen. These peer mentors play an im
portant role, advising freshmen on their
classes, activities, potential majors and just
about anything else. They are also among
the first people that freshmen meet when
they arrive on campus.
This year, the 225 peer mentors arrived
on campus on Sept. 16, four days before the
start of New Student Orientation. During
this time, they underwent extensive train
ing — up to eight hours in one day — for
their new jobs through the Office of Un
dergraduate Advising Programs (UAP).
Yet, in return for their services, this
year's Peer Mentors found something
extra on their University bills this quarter.
Due to an error between the UAP and
Housing Assignment Services, the Peer
Mentors were charged early arrival fees.
Additionally, some students have been as
sessed for late fees related to this extrane
ous charge.
According to Roland Hsu, senior asso
ciate director for UAP in previous years
these fees were paid directly by UAP and
there was to be no out-of-pocket expenses
for the peer mentors.
"Immediately upon learning of any con
cern over early arrival billing, the Office of
Undergraduate Advising Programs con
firmed with Housing Assignment Services
that any assessment of early arrival fees on
students' bills was simply an error this year
and that the charges are being reversed,"
Hsu said. "All Peer Mentors were personal
ly notified of this remedy so that they have
not needed to worry about this."
According to sophomore liana Segall.a
peer mentor, UAP informed the peer men
tors from the start that this charge would
appear on their bills and that they were
working to fix it.
"They definitely kept in touch with us
very well from the beginning," Segall said.
"They kept us well-informed of what they
were doing, even though it wasn't all re
solved right away."
Sophomore peer mentor Gloria Lin
said she just ignored the extra charges and
the problem was solved quickly.
"I was charged for early housing, but it
actually wasn't a big deal for me because I
just ignored it. paid my bill without paying
the cost of early housing and eventually it
was taken off my bill," Lin said. "I know
many of my friends complained about the
extra bill and some people had many com
plications."
