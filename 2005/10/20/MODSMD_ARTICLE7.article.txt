### R NICOLAS KOKKALIS 
At last night's meeting of the Gradu
ate Student Council (GSC) students ex
pressed both enthusiasm and concern
upon learning the details of Stanford's
recent collaboration with Yahoo! Music.
According to Andy Mackensen. a
second-year Graduate School of Busi
ness student and a summer intern with
Yahoo! Music, the ASSU and Universi
ty arc working together with Yahoo!
Music Unlimited in order to give stu
dents a legal way to access songs.
"I think it's a great opportunity to ex
perience music for free," Mackensen
said.
Yahoo! Music Unlimited subscrip
tion services will be provided to Stan
ford students at no charge as a pilot proj
ect for the 2(X)5-2(K)6 academic ycar.The
project was made possible through an
anonymous donation.
The pilot will end on Sept. 30,2(X)b or

whenever outside funding is discontin
ued. At the end of the pilot and with a
one month e-mail notice, Yahoo! will au
tomatically convert all free accounts to
the applicable retail price, a fact that
caught the attention of several GSC
members.
"Our only concern is students forget
ting to cancel the service after a year and
getting billed "said GSC member Adam
Beberg, a second-year doctoral student
in computer science.
Despite these concerns, the Council
considered spreading the word through
one of its monthly e-mail newsletters.
The meeting began with the an
nouncement that Stanford Student En
terprises. the business branch of the
ASSU. is now accepting applications for
the 2(X)6-2(X)7 chief executive officer
and the financial manager positions.
