BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) â€”
Sunni-led insurgents killed 19 people
in Iraq yesterday, the opening day of
Saddam Hussein's trial, including six
Shiites who were lined up at a facto
ry and gunned down in front of their
fellow workers, police said.
The day's fatalities also included
three election commission officials
who were shot and killed on the out
skirts of the capital in Abu Cihraib, as
they drove home after another
round of counting ballots from last
weekend's constitutional referen
dum, police said.
A bomb also went off at a famous
monument in a Baghdad square hon
oring the Bth-century founder of
Baghdad to whom Saddam often
compared himself. The blast, which
toppled the bust of Abu Jaafar Al-
Mansour but caused no injuries, ap
peared to be a jab at the former dic
tator.
The military said that two coali
tion soldiers were killed in attacks
Tuesday night.
Iraqis are still awaiting the out
come of last weekend's referendum,
as the slower-than-expected vote
counting continued. Questions about
the integrity of the vote and delays in
getting marked ballots to the capital
mean final results from the landmark
vote won't be announced until Fri
day at the earliest, officials said.
The returns have raised questions
over the possibility of irregularities
in the balloting.
An argumentative Saddam and
seven senior members of his regime
went on trial Wednesday fora 1982
massacre of about 150 Shiites in the

town of Dujail, north of Baghdad. He
immediately challenged the legiti
macy of the court and pleaded inno
cent to all charges.
The judge later adjourned the ses
sion until Nov. 28.
In Washington, Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice heralded the con
stitutional referendum and said the
U.S. strategy in Iraq was to "clear
areas from insurgent control, hold
them securely, and build durable, na
tional Iraqi institutions."
Rice told the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee the United States
is working to dismantle the insurgent
network and disrupt foreign support
for them, maintain security in areas
insurgents no longer hold, and build
national institutions to "sustain secu
rity forces, bring rule of law, visibly
deliver essential services, and offer
the Iraqi people hope fora better
economic future."
Wednesday's worst insurgent at
tack occurred in a mostly Sunni re
gion south of Baghdad known as the
Triangle of Death because of all its
militant groups.
About nine militants barged into a
building materials factory near
Iskandariyah, 30 miles south of Bagh
dad, lined up all the workers and
forced the six Shiite ones to identify
themselves, said police Lt. Colonel
Khalil Mohammed. The militants
then tied up the hands of Shiites, shot
them to death in front of the other
workers, and fled in several stolen
company cars, Mohammed said.
Insurgents opened fire on a police
checkpoint near the Hai Al-Adil
highway in a western Baghdad, killing
four policemen and wounding 11, said
police Capt. Qassim Hassan. The
fighting continued for several hours.

and it was not immediately known if
any militants were hurt, Hassan said.
In other attacks in Baghdad on
Wednesday, insurgents shot and
killed Hakim Mirza, a municipal di
rector. and his driver, in the Dora
neighborhood, and Muhsin Chitheer
in front of his home in the al-I'alam
area, police said. Chitheer was a
lieutenant colonel in the Iraqi army
that U.S. forces disbanded after in
vading in 2003.
A roadside bomb hit a U.S. Armv

patrol late Tuesday night, killing one
soldier and wounding two near
Iskandariyah,3o miles south of Bagh
dad, the military said. The attack
raised to at least 1,981 the number of
members of the U.S. military who
have died since the war began, ac
cording to an Associated Press count.
A British soldier also was killed by
a roadside bomb late Tuesday night in
the southern region of Basra, where
most British forces are based, the
Ministry of Defense said in London.
