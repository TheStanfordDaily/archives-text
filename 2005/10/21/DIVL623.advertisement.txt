UN the Brotherhood of Men
Sooner or later, the reality of their interdependence will
dawn upon the nations and their leaders. This realization will
bring about an entirely new attitude to the problems with
which, today, they wrestle, and will lend to easier, and wiser,
solutions of these difficulties. A gradual change in outlook will
replace the present fierce competition and confrontation with
mutual understanding and co-operation. That not all nations
will proceed in this direction ai the same pace, must be said,
but the effectiveness and obvious sanity of the method will
encourage even the least sanguine, eventually, to see the ben
efits for all. Kach step forward will cement this process and
hasten the movement towards co-operation. In this way, a
healthier relationship will evolve between the nations, leading
in time to a true sense of brotherhood.
Many smaller nations recognize, already, the reality of
interdependence but lacking power their voices go unheard.
Large and powerful nations scorn such notions, their pride in
self-sufficiency blinding them to the truth of their relation
ship with the world.
Experiment
Man evolves but slowly and needs time and experiment
to make significant advance, but precisely in this way do these
achievements become stable and permanent. The United
Nations is, of course, the forum in which the voice of the
smaller nations can be raised and heard. This is only possi
ble when the Security Council, with its arbitrary veto, is
abolished. It has outlasted its usefulness and must soon give
way to a United Nations Assembly free of the abuses of power
and veto. Then will we see the nations acting without
restraints imposed by Great Power veto and financial
inducement. Those w ho call loudest for democracy in foreign
lands are strangely blind to its absence in the halls of the
United Nations.
Men must come to realize that the people of all the
nations are one and equal, dependent each upon the other.
No one nation owns, nor can rule, the world. No one nation
can stand alone against the rest. The days of empire and
dominion are past. Man is on the threshold of a new under
standing of his role on planet Karth. This involves a change in
his relationship to his fellow travelers on the path to wisdom
and true stewardship of the planet's bounty.
We, your lilder Brothers, will help men to make this
change. Maitreya will set before men the alternative to action
and the transformation of the world He will show that with
out a change of direction the future would be difficult and
bleak indeed, lie will also inspire men to realize their inter
dependence, the reality of their Brotherhood.
