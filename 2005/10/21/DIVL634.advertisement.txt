Commonly Asked Questions
about reducing, reusing, recycling, buying recycled, and composting
Q How much waste does Stanford divert from the
landfill?
A Of all the solid waste that we created on the campus,
we were able to divert 60% of it away from the landfill in
2004. This is an increase of 6% over 2003. Please help
continue to reduce and recycle as much material as pos
sible by recycling all of your paper and bottles and cans.
Every little bit helps!
Q Can I recycle my water bottles
and beer bottles at the Stanford
Football Games?
A Yes, you will find over 200 bottle
and can recycling bins at the
Stanford Stadium.
Q What do I do with my old printer cartridges?
A PSSI accepts printer and toner cartridges for recycling. 56% of American consumers throw
out their empty printer cartridges instead of recycling them. A new study shows that approxi
mately 167 million inkjet cartridges wind up in the landfill. Those cartridges add more than 40
million pounds of unnecessary waste to our nation's landfills. The cartridges take more than
1000 years to decompose. Most printer cartridges can be refilled and reused. In order to close
the loop, you should buy "rernanufactured" printer cartridges. If your printer cartridges does
not come with a mail back envelope, you can bring it to the Stanford Recycling Drop-off Center.
There are also mail back envelopes at the Post Office on campus.
Q: What can I do with my old computer
monitor and hard drive?
A: PSSI now accepts computer monitors and
televisions, and other e-waste for free if it is
dropped off at our office.
Q: Can I recycle my old cell phone?
A: Yes, you can recycle your own cell phone
by taking it back to where you bought it or
your new one or you can bring it to the
Stanford Recycling Drop Off Center.
Q: Where can I recycle CDs and disks?
A: You can recycle CDs and computer disks at the Stanford Recycling Drop Off Center. We do
not accept Jewel Cases, but they can sometimes be donated to local libraries for reuse.
