replied. He replied
with an interception
on the Cougars' po
tential game winning
drive and sealed the
24-21 win for Stan
ford.
By stepping in
front of the Alex Brink
pass, Sanchez and the
Cardinal defense
showed that they were
capable of coming up
with a big stop, some
thing that had looked
all but impossible
three weeks ago.
It's fitting that it
was Sanchez who de
livered that message,
given that he has been
one of the most con
sistent members of
Stanford's much-ma
ligned defensive sec
ondary. He leads the
team in interceptions
and is second on the
team in tackles — a
surprising statistic
given that he is a cor
nerback.
Yet despite his
personal success and the success of the secondary in the last
two games — both slim victories — Sanchez is still moti
vated by those who doubt the team's abilities.
"People like to hate on us a little bit because we're
young — at least they say we're young and fairly inexperi
enced," Sanchez said. "We're out there trying to make a
play and when people talk bad about us, I feel it fuels us a
little bit to want to go out there, prove ourselves and show
that we're not a bad secondary. We can stop the pass. When
ever we hear stuff like that, we just want to go out there to
prove a point and show that we can play in the Pac-10."
The defense's task has been made doubly difficult due to
the Cardinal's offensive woes. In the first half of last week's
victory over Arizona, the defense was on the field for twice
as long as the offense. ITiis, along with injury trouble in the
secondary, has made Sanchez's job that much more impor
tant and demanding.
"We have the mindset that we are on defense and our
main goal is to get off the field and let the offense come in,"
Sanchez said. "Before a third down we always say 'get off the
field.' We always try to do our part, make plays, get off the
field and let our offense come out and get a chance to score."
Sanchez hasn't always had the opportunity to be on the
field making plays. Last season, Sanchez spent most of his
time on the bench, playing behind two cornerbacks —
Leigh Torrence and Stanley Wilson — who are currently

The television cameras and film crew
may have made it obvious, hut the 35 stu
dents in Civil and Environmental Engineer

tainable Building Projects" class knew
something unusual was afoot as they shuf
fled into the 8:30 a.m. class yesterday morn
ing.
E-mail correspondences from Fischer
days prior to the event implored students
to arrive to class on time, since it would be
taught by a guest lecturer — renowned ar
chitect and designer William McDonough.
What the unassuming students didn't
know, but soon found out, was that their
lecture was to be led by not one but two
guest speakers — including actress
Cameron Diaz.
Diaz surprised the class as part of
mtvU's "Stand In" television series, in
which celebrities and public figures act as
guest professors and teach classes on sub
jects about which they are passionate. Yes
terday, Diaz and McDonough discussed
the sustainable building movement and
other civil engineering ideas aimed to pro
tect the environment.
"I love the environment," Diaz said.
"It's something I feel very strongly about.
I'm a consumer and have everything I've
always wanted, so I've looked into ways to
consume without being damaging to the
environment. And I came across the sus
tainable movement."
Opening with a "Hi, I'm Cameron," ac
companied by her initial trademark laugh
and a "smarty pants" comment after McDo
nough praised Stanford's reputation, Diaz
took on the dual role of moderator and moti
vator, leading discussions among students
and entreating them to harness their creative
energies to achieve a greater good.
"What are you guys going to do?" she
asked the class. "How far are you going to
take it?"
McDonough, who is currently serving as
a consulting professor of civil and environ
mental engineering at Stanford, shared
with the class his visions of a green, Utopian
world and expressed his hopes for the future.

Cardinal go for
three in a row
against ASU
Sun Devils provide a serious
test for the Stanford defense
By DANIEL NOVINSON
DESK EDITOR
Stanford (3-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
looks to avenge last season's heartbreaking 31-
34 defeat and claim its first home win of the sea
son when a dangerous Arizona State squad (3-
3,1-2) visits the Farm at 2 p.m. tomorrow for the
homecoming game.
Despite its unspectacular record, Arizona
State enters the contest favored by neaily 10
points, and many analysts consider the Sun
Devils the strongest three-loss team in the
country. Arizona State's three losses came to
BCS No. 13 Oregon, No. 6 LSU and No. 1 USC
— squads with a combined record of 16-2. Fur
ther, two of those losses came down to the wire,
as LSU needed a last-second touchdown to es
cape with a 35-31 victory, and the Sun Devils led
USC 21-3 at the half before committing four
second-half turnovers.
Stanford head coach Walt Harris believes
the speed and overall talent of the Sun Devils
make them competitive with the top teams in
the country.
"Arizona State is a very talented football
team — very explosive," Harris said. "They
have some really good football players. We real
ly like the quarterback [Sam Keller]...he's got a
really good arm, and he's big and strong."
Because of an injured thumb, however,
Keller's status for the contest is questionable.
Trainers haven't let the junior grip a football
since the Oregon loss two weeks ago, but the
team is guardedly optimistic about Keller's
health for Saturday.
"The swelling is definitely down, and the
pain has subsided." Arizona State head coach
Dirk Koetter said at a Tempe press conference
earlier this week. "If its up to Sam. he's going to

replied. He replied
with an interception
on the Cougars' po
tential game winning
drive and sealed the
24-21 win for Stan
ford.
By stepping in
front of the Alex Brink
pass, Sanchez and the
Cardinal defense
showed that they were
capable of coming up
with a big stop, some
thing that had looked
all but impossible
three weeks ago.
It's fitting that it
was Sanchez who de
livered that message,
given that he has been
one of the most con
sistent members of
Stanford's much-ma
ligned defensive sec
ondary. He leads the
team in interceptions
and is second on the
team in tackles — a
surprising statistic
given that he is a cor
nerback.
Yet despite his
personal success and the success of the secondary in the last
two games — both slim victories — Sanchez is still moti
vated by those who doubt the team's abilities.
"People like to hate on us a little bit because we're
young — at least they say we're young and fairly inexperi
enced," Sanchez said. "We're out there trying to make a
play and when people talk bad about us, I feel it fuels us a
little bit to want to go out there, prove ourselves and show
that we're not a bad secondary. We can stop the pass. When
ever we hear stuff like that, we just want to go out there to
prove a point and show that we can play in the Pac-10."
The defense's task has been made doubly difficult due to
the Cardinal's offensive woes. In the first half of last week's
victory over Arizona, the defense was on the field for twice
as long as the offense. ITiis, along with injury trouble in the
secondary, has made Sanchez's job that much more impor
tant and demanding.
"We have the mindset that we are on defense and our
main goal is to get off the field and let the offense come in,"
Sanchez said. "Before a third down we always say 'get off the
field.' We always try to do our part, make plays, get off the
field and let our offense come out and get a chance to score."
Sanchez hasn't always had the opportunity to be on the
field making plays. Last season, Sanchez spent most of his
time on the bench, playing behind two cornerbacks —

The television cameras and film crew

something unusual was afoot as they shuf
fled into the 8:30 a.m. class yesterday morn

E-mail correspondences from Fischer
days prior to the event implored students
to arrive to class on time, since it would be
taught by a guest lecturer — renowned ar
chitect and designer William McDonough.
What the unassuming students didn't
know, but soon found out, was that their
lecture was to be led by not one but two
guest speakers — including actress
Cameron Diaz.
Diaz surprised the class as part of
mtvU's "Stand In" television series, in
which celebrities and public figures act as
guest professors and teach classes on sub

terday, Diaz and McDonough discussed
the sustainable building movement and
other civil engineering ideas aimed to pro
tect the environment.
"I love the environment," Diaz said.
"It's something I feel very strongly about.
I'm a consumer and have everything I've
always wanted, so I've looked into ways to
consume without being damaging to the
environment. And I came across the sus
tainable movement."
Opening with a "Hi, I'm Cameron," ac

took on the dual role of moderator and moti

energies to achieve a greater good.
"What are you guys going to do?" she
asked the class. "How far are you going to

McDonough, who is currently serving as

mental engineering at Stanford, shared
with the class his visions of a green, Utopian

Cardinal go for
three in a row
against ASU
Sun Devils provide a serious
test for the Stanford defense
By DANIEL NOVINSON
DESK EDITOR
Stanford (3-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
looks to avenge last season's heartbreaking 31-
34 defeat and claim its first home win of the sea
son when a dangerous Arizona State squad (3-
3,1-2) visits the Farm at 2 p.m. tomorrow for the
homecoming game.
Despite its unspectacular record, Arizona
State enters the contest favored by neaily 10
points, and many analysts consider the Sun
Devils the strongest three-loss team in the
country. Arizona State's three losses came to
BCS No. 13 Oregon, No. 6 LSU and No. 1 USC
— squads with a combined record of 16-2. Fur
ther, two of those losses came down to the wire,
as LSU needed a last-second touchdown to es
cape with a 35-31 victory, and the Sun Devils led
USC 21-3 at the half before committing four
second-half turnovers.
Stanford head coach Walt Harris believes
the speed and overall talent of the Sun Devils
make them competitive with the top teams in
the country.
"Arizona State is a very talented football
team — very explosive," Harris said. "They
have some really good football players. We real
ly like the quarterback [Sam Keller]...he's got a
really good arm, and he's big and strong."
Because of an injured thumb, however,
Keller's status for the contest is questionable.
Trainers haven't let the junior grip a football
since the Oregon loss two weeks ago, but the
team is guardedly optimistic about Keller's
health for Saturday.
"The swelling is definitely down, and the
pain has subsided." Arizona State head coach
Dirk Koetter said at a Tempe press conference

replied. He replied
with an interception
on the Cougars' po
tential game winning
drive and sealed the
24-21 win for Stan
ford.
By stepping in
front of the Alex Brink
pass, Sanchez and the
Cardinal defense
showed that they were
capable of coming up
with a big stop, some
thing that had looked
all but impossible
three weeks ago.
It's fitting that it
was Sanchez who de
livered that message,
given that he has been
one of the most con
sistent members of
Stanford's much-ma
ligned defensive sec
ondary. He leads the
team in interceptions
and is second on the
team in tackles — a
surprising statistic
given that he is a cor
nerback.
Yet despite his
personal success and the success of the secondary in the last
two games — both slim victories — Sanchez is still moti
vated by those who doubt the team's abilities.
"People like to hate on us a little bit because we're
young — at least they say we're young and fairly inexperi
enced," Sanchez said. "We're out there trying to make a
play and when people talk bad about us, I feel it fuels us a
little bit to want to go out there, prove ourselves and show
that we're not a bad secondary. We can stop the pass. When
ever we hear stuff like that, we just want to go out there to
prove a point and show that we can play in the Pac-10."
The defense's task has been made doubly difficult due to
the Cardinal's offensive woes. In the first half of last week's
victory over Arizona, the defense was on the field for twice
as long as the offense. ITiis, along with injury trouble in the
secondary, has made Sanchez's job that much more impor
tant and demanding.
"We have the mindset that we are on defense and our
main goal is to get off the field and let the offense come in,"
Sanchez said. "Before a third down we always say 'get off the
field.' We always try to do our part, make plays, get off the
field and let our offense come out and get a chance to score."
Sanchez hasn't always had the opportunity to be on the
field making plays. Last season, Sanchez spent most of his
time on the bench, playing behind two cornerbacks —
Leigh Torrence and Stanley Wilson — who are currently

Cameron Diaz gives surprise guest lecture
Actress comes to Stanford for mtvU program "Stand In"
By PATRICK FITZGERALD &

DESK EDITORS
The television cameras and film crew
may have made it obvious, hut the 35 stu
dents in Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing Prof. Martin Fischer's "Maintaining Sus
tainable Building Projects" class knew
something unusual was afoot as they shuf
fled into the 8:30 a.m. class yesterday morn
ing.
E-mail correspondences from Fischer
days prior to the event implored students
to arrive to class on time, since it would be
taught by a guest lecturer — renowned ar
chitect and designer William McDonough.
What the unassuming students didn't
know, but soon found out, was that their
lecture was to be led by not one but two
guest speakers — including actress
Cameron Diaz.
Diaz surprised the class as part of
mtvU's "Stand In" television series, in
which celebrities and public figures act as
guest professors and teach classes on sub
jects about which they are passionate. Yes
terday, Diaz and McDonough discussed
the sustainable building movement and
other civil engineering ideas aimed to pro
tect the environment.
"I love the environment," Diaz said.
"It's something I feel very strongly about.
I'm a consumer and have everything I've
always wanted, so I've looked into ways to
consume without being damaging to the
environment. And I came across the sus
tainable movement."
Opening with a "Hi, I'm Cameron," ac
companied by her initial trademark laugh
and a "smarty pants" comment after McDo
nough praised Stanford's reputation, Diaz
took on the dual role of moderator and moti
vator, leading discussions among students
and entreating them to harness their creative
energies to achieve a greater good.
"What are you guys going to do?" she
asked the class. "How far are you going to
take it?"
McDonough, who is currently serving as
a consulting professor of civil and environ
mental engineering at Stanford, shared
with the class his visions of a green, Utopian
world and expressed his hopes for the future.

Cardinal go for
three in a row
against ASU
Sun Devils provide a serious
test for the Stanford defense
By DANIEL NOVINSON
DESK EDITOR
Stanford (3-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
looks to avenge last season's heartbreaking 31-
34 defeat and claim its first home win of the sea
son when a dangerous Arizona State squad (3-
3,1-2) visits the Farm at 2 p.m. tomorrow for the
homecoming game.
Despite its unspectacular record, Arizona
State enters the contest favored by neaily 10
points, and many analysts consider the Sun
Devils the strongest three-loss team in the
country. Arizona State's three losses came to
BCS No. 13 Oregon, No. 6 LSU and No. 1 USC
— squads with a combined record of 16-2. Fur
ther, two of those losses came down to the wire,
as LSU needed a last-second touchdown to es
cape with a 35-31 victory, and the Sun Devils led
USC 21-3 at the half before committing four
second-half turnovers.
Stanford head coach Walt Harris believes
the speed and overall talent of the Sun Devils
make them competitive with the top teams in
the country.
"Arizona State is a very talented football
team — very explosive," Harris said. "They
have some really good football players. We real
ly like the quarterback [Sam Keller]...he's got a
really good arm, and he's big and strong."
Because of an injured thumb, however,
Keller's status for the contest is questionable.
Trainers haven't let the junior grip a football
since the Oregon loss two weeks ago, but the
team is guardedly optimistic about Keller's
health for Saturday.
"The swelling is definitely down, and the
pain has subsided." Arizona State head coach
Dirk Koetter said at a Tempe press conference
earlier this week. "If its up to Sam. he's going to
