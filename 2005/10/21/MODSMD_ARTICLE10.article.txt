# SPECIAL EVENT
## Nobel Peace laureate speaks on life, tragedy 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Rigoberta Menchu TUm, the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize
Laureate,addressed a packed crowd at Memorial Church
yesterday.
The youngest individual to ever receive the Nobel
Peace Prize, Menchu became a powerful human rights
advocate after the 1983 publication of "I, Rigoberta
Menchu," the story of an indigenous child whose family
was caught in the war that killed an estimated 100,000
people and left another 40,000 missing and presumed
dead,
Menchu was born in 1959 to a poor Indian peasant
family in Guatemala and was raised in the Quiche branch
of the Mayan culture. She became involved in social re
form activities through the Catholic Church,and became
a prominent figure in the women's rights movement
while in her teens.
"Her achievements have been particularly difficult
because of her gender," said MEChA Co-chair Luz
Erendira Reyes, a junior, during opening remarks of the
event.
Political science Prof. Terry Karl spoke about the work
Rigoberta Menchu has done to directly and indirectly
prevent the impunity of war criminals. Karl also gave
background information about Menchu's family — most
of her immediate family members were victims of the
genocide in Guatemala.
" Rigoberta Menchu has seen the worst and best of hu
manity," Karl said.
Menchu's family was accused of taking part in guerril
la activities, and her father was imprisoned and tortured
for allegedly having participated in the execution of a
local plantation owner. After his release, he joined the
Menchu fought hard for human rights

Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC). In 1979,
Menchu joined the CUC herself. That year, her
brother was arrested, tortured and killed by the
army. The following year, her father was killed when
security forces in the capital stormed the Spanish
Embassy Shortly afterward, her mother also died
following her arrest, torture and rape.
Menchu became increasingly active in the CUC
and taught herself Spanish as well as other Mayan
languages besides her native Quiche. In addition,she
established "Fundacion Rigoberta Menchu," a foun
dation for human and indigenous peoples' rights.
Menchu now organb.es resistance to oppression
in Guatemala outside its borders, and she leads the
struggle for Indian peasant peoples' rights. She has
become known as a leading advocate of Indian
rights and ethno-cultural reconciliation, not only in
Guatemala but also throughout the world.
Menchu's speech was delivered in Spanish but
translated into English. She addressed many aspects
of human nature and spoke of the genocide that has
afflicted her country.
Menchu said she believes that in life, there are
three major attitudes one should live by — to always
ask for forgiveness, to give thanks for everything and
to always want more spiritual and material abun
dance. She said she believes that practicing each will

lead to less suffering and poverty. Dialogue and rec
onciliation,she insisted.are impossible unless people
recognize the atrocities they have committed.
"I don't know who to forgive, and I need some
one to say, it was me, forgive me,"' Menchu said,
when she explained how she has dealt with the mur
ders of her family members.
Menchu also addressed how the international
community has reacted to genocide in Guatemala
and other Latin American nations. She remarked
that humanity is a funny thing, because most people
seem to have a weak sense of brotherhood. When
major crises happen, people often rally together, but
the support is never lasting. She believes people
need to try to be more conscious of their surround
ings.
Menchu also spoke of free trade agreements and
nations breaking with the Kyoto Protocol. She be
lieves that if industries had stuck to the protocol in
many Latin American countries, much of the natural
landscape and beauty of villages would not have
been destroyed — especially with the recent hurri
canes.
"Wisdom is not something that could be bought
— totherwise US. companies would have patented
it," she said, a remark that elicited laughter from au
dience members.

Menchu asked listeners to remember that peo
ple's works have social and cultural relevance, and
that good ideas are only realized when put into ac
tion. She also said she believes that it is important to
acknowledge that our diversity should be embraced
because it is a part of nature.
Audience members were also encouraged to do
nate to the victims of Hurricane Stan, because many
in (Juatemala were severely affected. There are cur
rently 2(X).(HX) Guatemalans living in shelters as a re
sult of the storm. Menchu said many of these people
have been overlooked because the international
community forgot about the storm victims "as soon
as the sun came out."
Menchu's visit was made possible by El Centro
Chicano in association with Casa Zapata, the Center
for Latin American studies, MEChA de Stanford,
the Native American Cultural Center, the Office for
Religious Life and the Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education.
Karl said she hoped students took Menchu's
words to heart.
"I hope students realize that it only takes one or
two people to make a change, as Margaret Mead
said." She added, "And I know there is nothing
Rigoberta Menchu has done that any Stanford stu
dent cannot do."

Menchu was born in 1959 to a poor Indian peasant
family in Guatemala and was raised in the Quiche branch
of the Mayan culture. She became involved in social re
form activities through the Catholic Church,and became
a prominent figure in the women's rights movement
while in her teens.
"Her achievements have been particularly difficult
because of her gender," said MEChA Co-chair Luz
Erendira Reyes, a junior, during opening remarks of the
event.
Political science Prof. Terry Karl spoke about the work
Rigoberta Menchu has done to directly and indirectly
prevent the impunity of war criminals. Karl also gave
background information about Menchu's family — most
of her immediate family members were victims of the
genocide in Guatemala.
" Rigoberta Menchu has seen the worst and best of hu
manity," Karl said.
Menchu's family was accused of taking part in guerril
la activities, and her father was imprisoned and tortured
for allegedly having participated in the execution of a
local plantation owner. After his release, he joined the
Menchu fought hard for human rights

Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC). In 1979,
Menchu joined the CUC herself. That year, her
brother was arrested, tortured and killed by the
army. The following year, her father was killed when
security forces in the capital stormed the Spanish
Embassy Shortly afterward, her mother also died
following her arrest, torture and rape.
Menchu became increasingly active in the CUC
and taught herself Spanish as well as other Mayan
languages besides her native Quiche. In addition,she
established "Fundacion Rigoberta Menchu," a foun
dation for human and indigenous peoples' rights.
Menchu now organb.es resistance to oppression
in Guatemala outside its borders, and she leads the
struggle for Indian peasant peoples' rights. She has
become known as a leading advocate of Indian
rights and ethno-cultural reconciliation, not only in
Guatemala but also throughout the world.
Menchu's speech was delivered in Spanish but
translated into English. She addressed many aspects
of human nature and spoke of the genocide that has
afflicted her country.
Menchu said she believes that in life, there are
three major attitudes one should live by — to always
ask for forgiveness, to give thanks for everything and
to always want more spiritual and material abun
dance. She said she believes that practicing each will

lead to less suffering and poverty. Dialogue and rec
onciliation,she insisted.are impossible unless people
recognize the atrocities they have committed.
"I don't know who to forgive, and I need some
one to say, it was me, forgive me,"' Menchu said,
when she explained how she has dealt with the mur
ders of her family members.
Menchu also addressed how the international
community has reacted to genocide in Guatemala
and other Latin American nations. She remarked
that humanity is a funny thing, because most people
seem to have a weak sense of brotherhood. When
major crises happen, people often rally together, but
the support is never lasting. She believes people
need to try to be more conscious of their surround
ings.
Menchu also spoke of free trade agreements and
nations breaking with the Kyoto Protocol. She be
lieves that if industries had stuck to the protocol in
many Latin American countries, much of the natural
landscape and beauty of villages would not have
been destroyed — especially with the recent hurri
canes.
"Wisdom is not something that could be bought
— totherwise US. companies would have patented
it," she said, a remark that elicited laughter from au
dience members.

Menchu asked listeners to remember that peo
ple's works have social and cultural relevance, and
that good ideas are only realized when put into ac
tion. She also said she believes that it is important to
acknowledge that our diversity should be embraced
because it is a part of nature.
Audience members were also encouraged to do
nate to the victims of Hurricane Stan, because many
in (Juatemala were severely affected. There are cur
rently 2(X).(HX) Guatemalans living in shelters as a re
sult of the storm. Menchu said many of these people
have been overlooked because the international
community forgot about the storm victims "as soon
as the sun came out."
Menchu's visit was made possible by El Centro
Chicano in association with Casa Zapata, the Center
for Latin American studies, MEChA de Stanford,
the Native American Cultural Center, the Office for
Religious Life and the Office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education.
Karl said she hoped students took Menchu's
words to heart.
"I hope students realize that it only takes one or
two people to make a change, as Margaret Mead
said." She added, "And I know there is nothing
Rigoberta Menchu has done that any Stanford stu
dent cannot do."
