### ANURADHA SIVARAM 
In an effort to bring visibility to the les
bian, gay. bisexual, transgender and ques
tioning communities at Stanford, the
LGBT Community Resource Center
(LGBT-CRC).along with other organiza
tions on campus, organized the fourth an
nual National Coming Out Day yester
day in White Plaza.
The event featured recordings of Stan
ford students' coming-out stories and a ban
ner on which students were encouraged to
graffiti words that they felt described parts
of their identity.
Junior Bharat Venkat, one of the
event's four student coordinators, said
that though the official National Coming
Out Day took place on Oct. 11 .the LGBT
CRC decide to hold observances at a later
date.since school started so late in the fall.
"We thought it would be better if we
gave more time for everyone to become
comfortable with each other," he said.
"We have a bunch of big events lined up
â€” this is just the first."
Venkat is a member of the Queer Volun
tary Student Organization (QVSO), which

serves as a liaison between the LGBT-CRC
and other queer groups on campus.many of
which were represented at the event.
"There are different groups for all
niches," Venkat said. "There are groups
for undergraduates, as well as groups for
the Law School, the Medical School and
the School of Education."
Besides facilitating communication be
tween the different groups on campus.
Venkat said that a lot of student effort
went into designing the event flyer, mak
ing shirts and publicity. Though he admit
ted that coordinating the event was diffi
cult. he said that the Stanford populace is
very supportive of the LGBT community.
"Not only are there a lot of groups on
campus," he said, "but you can also start
your own group if you want. There is a lot

of academic and bureaucratic support for
that."
Sophomore Dan Zeehandelaar, presi
dent of Stanford Jewish Queers, said he
agreed that Stanford provides a support
ive atmosphere for all types of people.
"1 found it easy to reconcile homosex
uality with my religion, but some more
conservative sects interpret the Bible
more literally when it involves homosex
uality." he said.
He added that at Stanford, Hillel, a Jew
ish student organization, is very supportive
of queer students.
