# Students fast for quake relief
## 
### LAURA CHANG 
The charitable spirit of Ramadan will extend
beyond the Muslim community to touch Stanford
students and South Asian earthquake victims
alike on Sunday. United by a common humanitar
ian concern, the Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity (ISSU), the Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and other concerned Stanford
students will combine efforts for the annual Fast
a-thon benefit.
Observing both Ramadan and South Asia
earthquake relief efforts, participants will fast dur
ing Sunday's daylight hours and convene at dusk
for a communal breaking-of-the-fast at Ttesidder
Union. For each student who fasts, local business

es will contribute an additional donation to the re
lief effort.
Organizers invite both Muslims and non-Mus
lims to partake in the holy tradition.
"We hope the Fast-a-thon will allow the wider
Stanford community to participate in a demand
ing and spiritually rewarding experience with
their Muslim peers," said MSAN Public Relations
Director Ahmed Ashraf, a junior. "Sharing this
with the wider community allows them to under
stand their Muslim peers on a new level and hope
fully gives the campus a better understanding of
what it means to be Muslim."
