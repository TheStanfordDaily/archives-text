# Students fast for quake relief
## 
### LAURA CHANG 
The charitable spirit of Ramadan will extend
beyond the Muslim community to touch Stanford
students and South Asian earthquake victims
alike on Sunday. United by a common humanitar
ian concern, the Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity (ISSU), the Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and other concerned Stanford
students will combine efforts for the annual Fast
a-thon benefit.
Observing both Ramadan and South Asia
earthquake relief efforts, participants will fast dur
ing Sunday's daylight hours and convene at dusk
for a communal breaking-of-the-fast at Ttesidder
Union. For each student who fasts, local business

es will contribute an additional donation to the re
lief effort.
Organizers invite both Muslims and non-Mus
lims to partake in the holy tradition.
"We hope the Fast-a-thon will allow the wider
Stanford community to participate in a demand
ing and spiritually rewarding experience with
their Muslim peers," said MSAN Public Relations
Director Ahmed Ashraf, a junior. "Sharing this
with the wider community allows them to under
stand their Muslim peers on a new level and hope
fully gives the campus a better understanding of
what it means to be Muslim."
Freshman Alanna Nass said that
she couldn't imagine fasting for an en
tire month.
"I can't even make it from break
fast to lunch," she said.
Not limited to fasting, Ramadan
also encourages Muslims to give to
others and engage with God and the
community on a deeper level. Part of
Ramadan is empathizing with those
less fortunate than ourselves, and the
Fast-a-thon intends to promote much
needed awareness of the recent Pak
istan disaster.
"The South Asia earthquake has
unfortunately failed to capture peo
ple's attention like the tsunami or Hur
ricane Katrina did," Ashraf said. "The
relief effort still deserves much more
support than has been shown."
For many Stanford students, in fact,
news of the South Asian earthquake
has yet to register.
"We're kind of in a Stanford Bub
ble, so it's hard for us to get the news,"
said freshman Lauren Shapiro.
