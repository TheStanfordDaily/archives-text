Nearly S(X) people made their way to the
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center on Thurs
day afternoon for the fourth annual Sympo
sium of Undergraduate Research in Progress
(SURP).
"This is where you go to find people interest
ed in research," said senior Victor McFarland.
gesturing towards McCaw Hall in the Alumni
Center. Onlookers filled the rooms, looking at
poster boards containing research on topics
ranging from nano-manipulation to Shake
speare's King Lear.
"The goal of this event is to give undergrad
uates a broad audience for their research." said
Susie Brubaker-Cole, director of the Under

graduate Research Programs. "It also gives in
terested students a chance to talk with re
searchers about opportunities for research. It's
good for them to find out from their peers."
Undergraduates attended for a wide variety
of reasons.
'Tm not just here for the watermelon, the
pineapple or the gourmet food." said freshman
Douglas Stanford. "I'm really interested in re
search."
"Plus, the solar car is awesome," added
freshman Anish Mitra."lt goes 45 mph."
Others were inspired to begin their own re
search endeavors.
"The Symposium made me more likely to
pursue undergraduate research,"
said freshman Matt Paden."This is
not your average science fair."
SURP took place on the first
afternoon of Reunion Homecom
ing Weekend for alumni, and sev
eral visitors were in attendance.
"It's fascinating, amazing," said
Jeffery Fenton, Class of 1981.
"These students are so creative.
I'm glad the University supports
events like this."
Some administrators also com
mented on the active role alumni
could play in undergraduate re
search.
"Who knows?" Brubaker-Cole
said. "Someone who can help
them take the next step or imple
ment their project or exhibit their
paintings might come and give a
young researcher the boost he or
she needs."
Junior Alan Laursen.for exam
ple, stood with the Solar Car team
as they displayed their award-win
ning vehicle, Solstice, in front of

the Alumni Center.
"[Undergraduate research]
makes the alumni feel good about
their University," Laursen said.
"Lots of them come up and ask
questions. They're very curious."
Student researchers in creative
arts, engineering, humanities and
natural and social sciences pre
sented their projects to onlookers.
Various donors fund the majority
of these projects with grants rang
ing from $500 to several thousand
dollars.
"It's fun to learn how research
works," said junior Kirk Mc-
Connell about his project on fe
male incontinence. "It was a glob
al effort â€” I was the only Ameri
can in the project. We developed
new muscular imaging software.
Plus, I had a few really awkward
conversations with some of the
older female members of my fam
ily."
Juniors Samvit Kanoria and
Jack Loveridge, who are research
ing outsourcing as a global phe
nomenon. had asked questions
such as "Are workers as happy as
firms make them seem?" and "Is
happiness money?"
"There's a helluva lot more to

do" Loveridge said. "Eventually
we will publish our findings in the
Stanford Undergraduate Re
search Journal (SURJ)."
Students became involved with
SURP through various connec
tions with faculty and donors. Ju
nior Kimi Narita, for example, be
came involved with her project,
"Judging Public Awareness of In
vasive Plant Species on Maui,"
after taking an introductory semi
nar on island ecology. Similarly,
McConnell became acquainted
with his research mentor through
an introductory seminar. They
stayed in touch, and McConnell
arranged for the use of the profes
sor's lab.
Vice Provost of Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman also
spoke at the event.The URP is $50
million past its $1 billion goal for
research funding, he said. He also
thanked all the students, profes
sors and donors for their contribu
tions to this achievement.
"The caliber of the presenta
tions in this room matches or sur
passes any similar fair out there,"
Bravman said. "Research is always
a work in progress; it's never fin
ished."
