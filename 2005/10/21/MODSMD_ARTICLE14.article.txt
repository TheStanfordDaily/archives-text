## Grab a smoothie if joints aren't your style

Mango Cafe
435 Hamilton Ave.
Entrees from $7.95 - $ 1 1.95

Betsy and I have decided exactly what
makes people cool. Based on every
movie I've ever seen, you are defi
nitely cool if you know of obscure ethnic
restaurants. That's how all the people in
movies score hot dates. "Hey, want to go
out for dinner sometime? I know a great lit
tle place..."
"You have to be adventurous in your
food choice," Betsy says. "That's what
makes you awesome."
We're doing our best to be awesome this
evening — we're eating at Mango Cafe, a
small Jamaican restaurant just off Universi
ty Avenue.
"What's Jamaican food?" I ask.
"Let's find out," Betsy says.
As we walk in. Bob Marley — what
else? — plays through the speakers, and
Betsy and 1 look around the restaurant as
he encourages us to stand up for our rights.
The room is narrow and cozy. It's not exact
ly buzzing, but a group of friends and a few
families are enjoying the fare. Toward the
back of the restaurant, a kid (presumably
the son of an employee) is seated at a table,
toiling away at his homework. Mango Cafe
definitely has a family-owned feel.
"Table for two?" asks the waiter. We're
seated in padded wicker chairs, and we
check out the decor. Painted wooden carv
ings alternate with tropical-looking plants,
and photographs of Jamaica fill in the walls.
TTie menu has a manageable number of
entrees, but it leaves plenty of room for cre
ativity. The word "joint" pops out at me
from the appetizers, and for a moment I
think I'm back in Amsterdam. A coffee
shop in Palo Alto? My weekends could be
come much more exciting...
The "joints," however, are really chicken
drummettes, which are good, if not actually
mind-altering. We order a combo plate of
"curried joints" and "jerked joints."
The jerked joints are spicy enough to
make my tongue sweat. The curried joints
seem bland in comparison, but that may
have been a byproduct of the spice-induced
annihilation of my taste buds. If joints
aren't your style, there are also baked plan
tains or mango chutney.
Mango Cafe<s known for its smoothies,
and it soon becomes apparent why. There
are 20 varieties listed on the menu with
names like "Montego Bay,""Kingston" and
"Treasure Beach." You can even blend
your own, choosing from tropical flavors
like papaya, mango, guanabana and any
thing else you can think of. Betsy orders the
"Bog Walk" — a combo of coconut,
pineapple and orange. My choice is "The
Dragon's Kiss" flavored with tamarind,
honey and ginger.
The smoothies are as enormous as they
are delicious. Served in a fishbowl on a gob
let stem, the drink is the best smoothie ex
perience of my young life. Jamba Juice,
Shmamba Juice.
The entrees at Mango are definitely
unique enough to make you feel adventur
ous. If you're really brave (and more daring
than me), you can try the hot curried goat
roti. I, however, waver between the curried
chicken and the Jamaican beef patty before
finally going with the chicken pelau. It's a
dish from THnidad, according to the menu,
consisting of chicken with rice and peas in
coconut milk. Betsy orders the vegetable
roti, which is curried potatoes, celery and
carrots wrapped in flatbread.
The food arrives quickly and there's a
lot of it. Unfortunately, mine tastes rather
plain. I remedy that by mixing it with the
dressing intended for my salad. It seems my
food choices are limited to mouth-searing
or bland. Fortunately, I still have ample
quantity of smoothie left to savor. Maybe
next time I'll order the curried goat...
The Verdict:
I'd go back to Mango, but just to try anoth
er flavor of the awesome smoothies. And,
of course, to test out my new pick-up line:
"Hey, want to go to dinner sometime? I
know a cool little Jamaican place..."

Mango Cafe<s known for its smoothies,
and it soon becomes apparent why. There
are 20 varieties listed on the menu with
names like "Montego Bay,""Kingston" and
"Treasure Beach." You can even blend
your own, choosing from tropical flavors
like papaya, mango, guanabana and any
thing else you can think of. Betsy orders the
"Bog Walk" — a combo of coconut,
pineapple and orange. My choice is "The
Dragon's Kiss" flavored with tamarind,
honey and ginger.
The smoothies are as enormous as they
are delicious. Served in a fishbowl on a gob
let stem, the drink is the best smoothie ex
perience of my young life. Jamba Juice,
Shmamba Juice.
The entrees at Mango are definitely
unique enough to make you feel adventur
ous. If you're really brave (and more daring
than me), you can try the hot curried goat
roti. I, however, waver between the curried
chicken and the Jamaican beef patty before
finally going with the chicken pelau. It's a
dish from THnidad, according to the menu,
consisting of chicken with rice and peas in
coconut milk. Betsy orders the vegetable
roti, which is curried potatoes, celery and
carrots wrapped in flatbread.
The food arrives quickly and there's a
lot of it. Unfortunately, mine tastes rather
plain. I remedy that by mixing it with the
dressing intended for my salad. It seems my
food choices are limited to mouth-searing
or bland. Fortunately, I still have ample
quantity of smoothie left to savor. Maybe
next time I'll order the curried goat...
The Verdict:
I'd go back to Mango, but just to try anoth
er flavor of the awesome smoothies. And,
of course, to test out my new pick-up line:
"Hey, want to go to dinner sometime? I
know a cool little Jamaican place..."

Mango Cafe
435 Hamilton Ave.
Entrees from $7.95 - $ 1 1.95

Betsy and I have decided exactly what
makes people cool. Based on every
movie I've ever seen, you are defi
nitely cool if you know of obscure ethnic
restaurants. That's how all the people in
movies score hot dates. "Hey, want to go
out for dinner sometime? I know a great lit
tle place..."
"You have to be adventurous in your
food choice," Betsy says. "That's what
makes you awesome."
We're doing our best to be awesome this
evening — we're eating at Mango Cafe, a
small Jamaican restaurant just off Universi
ty Avenue.
"What's Jamaican food?" I ask.
"Let's find out," Betsy says.
As we walk in. Bob Marley — what
else? — plays through the speakers, and
Betsy and 1 look around the restaurant as
he encourages us to stand up for our rights.
The room is narrow and cozy. It's not exact
ly buzzing, but a group of friends and a few
families are enjoying the fare. Toward the
back of the restaurant, a kid (presumably
the son of an employee) is seated at a table,
toiling away at his homework. Mango Cafe
definitely has a family-owned feel.
"Table for two?" asks the waiter. We're
seated in padded wicker chairs, and we
check out the decor. Painted wooden carv
ings alternate with tropical-looking plants,
and photographs of Jamaica fill in the walls.
TTie menu has a manageable number of
entrees, but it leaves plenty of room for cre
ativity. The word "joint" pops out at me
from the appetizers, and for a moment I
think I'm back in Amsterdam. A coffee
shop in Palo Alto? My weekends could be
come much more exciting...
The "joints," however, are really chicken
drummettes, which are good, if not actually
mind-altering. We order a combo plate of
"curried joints" and "jerked joints."
The jerked joints are spicy enough to
make my tongue sweat. The curried joints
seem bland in comparison, but that may
have been a byproduct of the spice-induced
annihilation of my taste buds. If joints
aren't your style, there are also baked plan
tains or mango chutney.
