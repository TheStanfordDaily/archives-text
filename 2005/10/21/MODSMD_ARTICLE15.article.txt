Concert.

atre in Mountain View, will feature Cros

lawn seating available for $39.75 (plus a
$9.40 convenience charge — a fee added
when people buy tickets from the Inter
net, telephone or local ticket outlet such
as a department store, according to Tick
etmaster's Web site).
All profits from the performance di
rectly benefit the Hillsborough-based
Bridge School, an educational program
that uses technology to serve children with
severe speech and physical impediments.
According to the school's Web site —
http://www.bridgeschool.org — the
Bridge School's mission is "to ensure that
individuals with severe speech and physi
cal impairments achieve full participation
in their communities through the use of
augmentative and alternative means of
communication (AAC) and assistive
technology (AT) application."
The school helps its students find their
best communicative strategies by en

rolling them until they are ready to move
back to their local school district.
Vicki Casella, executive director of the
school, explains the importance of the
program.
"We're serving a population of chil
dren that are underserved in many situa
tions," she says."It is a program that al
lows them to receive services and get
their education. And it does so with the
intent [that they eventually return to
their home school district]."
Founded in 1986 by Pegi Young and
Jim Forderer, who each had special-needs
children, and Marilyn Buzolich, a speech
language pathologist, the Hillsborough
based Bridge School opened its doors
one year later to a class of four elemen
tary-school children.
Today, the school has 12 students who
are divided into two classrooms — one
for students ages five to seven and anoth
er for students ages eight to 14.
"Fundraising effort is very impor
tant," Casella says."The school districts
pay tuition for the children, but that
money doesn't even cover half of the [ed
ucational] program."
The benefit concert was created by
Young's husband, music legend Neil
Young. The Youngs' son attended the
Bridge School, and Neil Young continues
to use his music connections to recruit
guests and raise money for his family's
cause.
The first concert was a relatively un

recognized event, with a typical lineup of
radio favorites. Since then, however,it has
grown into one of the biggest musical
events on the West Coast.
The concert has brought many musical
greats including Elton John, David
Bowie, the Who, Tom Petty, Bruce Spring
stein and Pearl Jam. Among last year's
stars were Paul McCartney, Ben Harper,
the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Eddie
Vedder.
Freshman Morgan Freret, who attend
ed last year's concert, raves about all the
performances.
"Bridge School was one of the most
amazing concerts I've ever been to," she
says. "TTiere wasn't a single disappointing
performance and seeing Paul McCartney
was a once-in-a-lifetime event."
Lauren Harper, a sophomore, express
es similar gratification with the 2003
event and says she thinks the kids from
the Bridge School also have a wonderful
time at the concert.
"One of the students of the Bridge
School was invited up on stage with Dave
Matthew's Band and he looked like he
was having the time of his life," Harper
says."It was a great thing to see, and it's a
great cause to support."
Casella promises that this year's Hal
loween weekend event will be equally en
joyable.
"I encourage people to come have a
good time," she says. "It's a great party, a
good cause and a lot of fun."
