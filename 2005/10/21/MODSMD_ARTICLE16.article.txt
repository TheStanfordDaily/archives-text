# Politics of the Past Collide at Cantor Exhibit
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER DESK EDITOR 
There aren't many places nowadays where you'll find
FDR. Stalin and Hitler all in the same room. One such place,
however, is at" Revolutionary Tides: The Art of the Political
Poster, 1914-1989," the current featured exhibit at the Can
tor Arts Center.
Spanning such historical milestones as the New Deal and
China's Cultural Revolution, the exhibition is one of three
major branches of the 2(KX) Crowds Project spearheaded by
Jeffrey T.Schnapp.director of the Stanford Humanities Lab.
Schnapp. who also serves as chief curator of the Cantor
exhibition, describes 2000 Crowds as a "truly ambitious,
large-scale project looking at crowds and the modern era."
In addition to the exhibition, the project includes a Web
site — http://crowds.stanford.edu — and a Stanford Uni
versity Press Book, forthcoming in 2006.
The Cantor Arts exhibition features works by well
known graphic artists such as John Heartfield.Gustav Klut
sis and Xanti Schawinsky. It also displays pieces by Norman
Rockwell and Andy Warhol.
According to Schnapp, "Revolutionary Tides" focuses
on themes that stretch beyond their historical and political
contexts — namely, the "human multitude as the actors of
modern life" and the derision of political power from the
populace.
Schnapp notes that though "the curatorial choices are
deliberately very heterogeneous [in that they] encompass
artists from some 30 countries," the works' juxtaposition
demonstrates "the emergence of a common language be
tween these graphics" communicating "the idea that politi
cal power emanates from the people."
Schnapp says he considers this "common language" to be
unique to the 20th century.
"While there are parts of this graphic vernacular that
have deep roots in history, this language is largely a new lan
guage that tries to translate very abstract notions into con
crete terms." he explains. "These are the kinds of challenges
that all these artists faced."
"The show is really a show about visual language — not
so much about political consequences or political move-

The posters' so-called common language is evident in the
museum's layout. Instead of being organized chronological
ly or by political ideology, the exhibition's works are sepa
rated into three categories — "figures," which examines the
visual graphics of the posters;" Numbers," which looks at the
statistics of its mass production and distribution; and "Sym
bols," which examines the connection among the posters'
iconic leaders and symbols and the actual masses they rep
resented.
The posters were chosen from 40,000 to 45,000 others
that belong to the Hoover Institution. Schnapp sifted
through them with the help of colleagues and graduate and
undergraduate researchers.

The presentation of posters at Cantor is based largely
upon their original context.
"Many of these posters were produced in [quantities] of
50,000 to 100,(XX) and weren't meant to be [displayed] in a
salon," Schnapp says.
He adds that the exhibit's setting accordingly includes
"visual and acoustical forms of business that would be true
of a modern industrial metropolis," in which the posters
were meant to be placed.
The original viewers of the propaganda "were interested
in anything but looking at an artwork," Schnapp explains.
"Posters were supposed to communicate under pressure."
Around 25 undergraduate and graduate students con
tributed to the Crowds Project, specifically through re
search, writing captions for the exhibition's art works and
devising hypotheses on layout and installation.
Among them was Jason Glick, who took Schnapp's
"Crowds" class during winter quarter of 2003 and graduat
ed in 2005 with a bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary
Studies in the Humanities.
Glick says he conducted research for both the Web site
and the exhibition, which often involved "unpacking the
meaning of a poster" by figuring out the date and place of its
original distribution.
"I wish a lot more of my academic work [had been] like
that, Glick says, referring to the investigation and interpre
tive decision-making the research required.
Like Schnapp, Glick says he was also struck by the
posters' similar uses of propaganda,despite their affiliations
with different regimes.
"There are enough commonalities that it's clear that
propaganda is something that's not from just one political
style," Glick says."The posters are kind of outlandish in how
dramatic the messages are. It's not only in the Soviet Union
and in Nazi Germany, but [also] in the U.S. during the New
Deal."
Glick also notes that this historical retrospective of prop
aganda still holds current relevance.
"It's a really timely exhibit in that the force of the prop
aganda message in some of the posters is very overwhelm
ing," he says. "Political messages resonate right now in our
politically charged climate."

Poster, 1914-1989," the current featured exhibit at the Can
tor Arts Center.
Spanning such historical milestones as the New Deal and
China's Cultural Revolution, the exhibition is one of three
major branches of the 2(KX) Crowds Project spearheaded by
Jeffrey T.Schnapp.director of the Stanford Humanities Lab.
Schnapp. who also serves as chief curator of the Cantor
exhibition, describes 2000 Crowds as a "truly ambitious,
large-scale project looking at crowds and the modern era."
In addition to the exhibition, the project includes a Web
site — http://crowds.stanford.edu — and a Stanford Uni
versity Press Book, forthcoming in 2006.
The Cantor Arts exhibition features works by well
known graphic artists such as John Heartfield.Gustav Klut
sis and Xanti Schawinsky. It also displays pieces by Norman
Rockwell and Andy Warhol.
According to Schnapp, "Revolutionary Tides" focuses
on themes that stretch beyond their historical and political
contexts — namely, the "human multitude as the actors of
modern life" and the derision of political power from the
populace.
Schnapp notes that though "the curatorial choices are
deliberately very heterogeneous [in that they] encompass
artists from some 30 countries," the works' juxtaposition
demonstrates "the emergence of a common language be
tween these graphics" communicating "the idea that politi
cal power emanates from the people."
Schnapp says he considers this "common language" to be
unique to the 20th century.
"While there are parts of this graphic vernacular that
have deep roots in history, this language is largely a new lan
guage that tries to translate very abstract notions into con
crete terms." he explains. "These are the kinds of challenges
that all these artists faced."
"The show is really a show about visual language — not
so much about political consequences or political move-

The posters' so-called common language is evident in the
museum's layout. Instead of being organized chronological
ly or by political ideology, the exhibition's works are sepa
rated into three categories — "figures," which examines the
visual graphics of the posters;" Numbers," which looks at the
statistics of its mass production and distribution; and "Sym
bols," which examines the connection among the posters'
iconic leaders and symbols and the actual masses they rep
resented.
The posters were chosen from 40,000 to 45,000 others
that belong to the Hoover Institution. Schnapp sifted
through them with the help of colleagues and graduate and
undergraduate researchers.

The presentation of posters at Cantor is based largely
upon their original context.
"Many of these posters were produced in [quantities] of
50,000 to 100,(XX) and weren't meant to be [displayed] in a
salon," Schnapp says.
He adds that the exhibit's setting accordingly includes
"visual and acoustical forms of business that would be true
of a modern industrial metropolis," in which the posters
were meant to be placed.
The original viewers of the propaganda "were interested
in anything but looking at an artwork," Schnapp explains.
"Posters were supposed to communicate under pressure."
Around 25 undergraduate and graduate students con
tributed to the Crowds Project, specifically through re
search, writing captions for the exhibition's art works and
devising hypotheses on layout and installation.
Among them was Jason Glick, who took Schnapp's
"Crowds" class during winter quarter of 2003 and graduat
ed in 2005 with a bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary
Studies in the Humanities.
Glick says he conducted research for both the Web site
and the exhibition, which often involved "unpacking the
meaning of a poster" by figuring out the date and place of its
original distribution.
"I wish a lot more of my academic work [had been] like
that, Glick says, referring to the investigation and interpre
tive decision-making the research required.
Like Schnapp, Glick says he was also struck by the
posters' similar uses of propaganda,despite their affiliations
with different regimes.
"There are enough commonalities that it's clear that
propaganda is something that's not from just one political
style," Glick says."The posters are kind of outlandish in how
dramatic the messages are. It's not only in the Soviet Union
and in Nazi Germany, but [also] in the U.S. during the New
Deal."
Glick also notes that this historical retrospective of prop
aganda still holds current relevance.
"It's a really timely exhibit in that the force of the prop
aganda message in some of the posters is very overwhelm
ing," he says. "Political messages resonate right now in our
politically charged climate."
