## Editorial Mausoleum failure should teach lessons 
### 
The resurrection failed. With a little
more than a week left before Hal
loween, we are not the only students
disappointed in the failed revival of the Mau
soleum Party. For most students, the party is
little more than a mysterious ghost that is
widely acknowledged but never seen.
Given increased hopes this year (though,
admittedly, every year this page does hope —
in vain — that the party will return), we find
the failure of anyone to take responsibility to
be extremely disappointing. Hie press re
lease from the Mausoleum Planning Com
mittee names just about every possible or
ganization in an effort to distribute blame so
thin that no one can be held accountable.
Many alumni on campus this weekend
may be disappointed to find that a lively and
long-lasting tradition that ran for more than
20 years has once again failed to materialize,
leaving the Class of 2006 without any Mau
soleum Party during its four years at Stan
ford. Members of the senior class will be un
able to complete all of Stanford Magazine's
101 things to do before you leave the Farm
(the party was number 19, right behind "Get
kissed at Full Moon on the Quad").
At this point, we are a little concerned
that no lessons have been learned over the
past several years from the repeated failed
attempts to revive this dead tradition. ITiis
year's planners should publicize a full ac
count of their difficulties so that next year's
planners — future ASSU and senior class
presidents — can learn from their mistakes.
Next year's senior class executive slate must
take charge immediately upon taking office,
acting with the same vigor that senior pub

nights traditionally engender, and the Mau
soleum Party must have the administration's
support from the beginning. Despite the fact
that the date for the 2006 Mausoleum Party
has already been set. we have become cyni
cal enough as a result of past Mausoleum
disappointments to believe that the party
will not happen even next year unless real
change takes place with regards to party
planning and organization — the responsi
bility lies with both student leaders and the
administration.
And in preparing for next year's Mau
soleum Party, this year's ASSU executives,
senators and class presidents shouldn't be
left off the hook either. This year; we expect
them to identify funding from inside and out
side the University administration, and they
should secure preliminary support for next
year's party.
We firmly believe that this year's failure
proves that the Alumni Association should
step in and resume funding the party, whether
directly or through senior class funds. As one
of Stanford's best traditions (at least that's
what we hear), eventual donations should
more than make up for a cost outlay on cur
rent students. If the party has a base of fund
ing and support from influential individuals,
we are confident that student executives will
be able to organize a successful bash.
Without the Mausoleum Party to connect
us to our founders this year, we at least hope
that those funds can be diverted toward
something that could similarly impress the
jaded Class of 2006 — say, number 21 on the
list of 101 things to do while at Stanford
(Storm the field after Big Game).
