# Ramadan an example of Dining success
## 
### 
This page has often criticized Stanford
Dining for, among other things, a seem
ing disconnect between students' needs
and the services it provides. We are therefore
pleased and encouraged by the partnership
between the Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity and Stanford Dining that has resulted
in a successful dining program during the Is
lamic month of Ramadan. This year marks
the second time the two organizations have
united to provide dinners inTresidder Memo
rial Union to fasting Muslims after sundown.
The collaboration appears to be a tri
umph. Both organizations have expressed
satisfaction at the format, which includes din
ners provided free-of-charge for about 1 (K)
students, paid for with ISSU and Stanford
Dining funds, fundraising and volunteerism.
Stanford Dining altered its recipes and pro
duction methods to prepare these dinners
with Halal meat, and it has also offered be
fore-dawn breakfasts during Ramadan for
several years now.
In addition, the ISSU and Stanford Dining
co-host an annual Fast-a-thon (to be held this
Sunday) during Ramadan each year, in which
all Stanford students are encouraged to fast
for a day. then break the fast with Muslim stu
dents at TVesidder that evening. This event
raises money for charity and is viewed bv

ISSU as an opportunity to create awareness
about the month of Ramadan and the religion
of Islam in general. Stanford Dining volun
teers prepare meals for any student who wish
es to participate — last year approximately
2(K) students did — while the ISSU and the
Muslim Student Awareness Society covers
the costs.
We think this partnership exemplifies the
positive relations that can exist between stu
dent groups and Stanford Dining, and we
hope to see more instances like this develop in
the future. Both sides insist that it is the part
nership between the two organizations that
has made the Ramadan dining program such
a success.
We feel many groups — from vegans to
other religious groups — can learn from this
success.
Rafi Taherian, executive director of Stan
ford Dining, says that the dining service de
sires more opportunities to work with student
groups and wishes to expand its role in stu
dent events. Such collaboration appears to be
a useful tool that we often overlook, and this
success has demonstrated the positive contri
butions that Dining and students can make
when they work together. We hope that more
student groups seek the assistance of Stanford
Dining in the future.
