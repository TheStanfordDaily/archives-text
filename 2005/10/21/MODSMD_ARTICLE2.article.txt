a slim three-point lead over Washington State, junior cor

replied. He replied
with an interception
on the Cougars' po
tential game winning
drive and sealed the
24-21 win for Stan
ford.
By stepping in
front of the Alex Brink
pass, Sanchez and the
Cardinal defense
showed that they were
capable of coming up
with a big stop, some
thing that had looked
all but impossible
three weeks ago.
It's fitting that it
was Sanchez who de
livered that message,
given that he has been
one of the most con
sistent members of
Stanford's much-ma
ligned defensive sec
ondary. He leads the
team in interceptions
and is second on the
team in tackles — a
surprising statistic
given that he is a cor
nerback.
Yet despite his

personal success and the success of the secondary in the last
two games — both slim victories — Sanchez is still moti
vated by those who doubt the team's abilities.
"People like to hate on us a little bit because we're

young — at least they say we're young and fairly inexperi
enced," Sanchez said. "We're out there trying to make a
play and when people talk bad about us, I feel it fuels us a
little bit to want to go out there, prove ourselves and show
that we're not a bad secondary. We can stop the pass. When
ever we hear stuff like that, we just want to go out there to
prove a point and show that we can play in the Pac-10."
The defense's task has been made doubly difficult due to
the Cardinal's offensive woes. In the first half of last week's
victory over Arizona, the defense was on the field for twice
as long as the offense. ITiis, along with injury trouble in the
secondary, has made Sanchez's job that much more impor

tant and demanding.
"We have the mindset that we are on defense and our
main goal is to get off the field and let the offense come in,"
Sanchez said. "Before a third down we always say 'get off the
field.' We always try to do our part, make plays, get off the
field and let our offense come out and get a chance to score."
Sanchez hasn't always had the opportunity to be on the
field making plays. Last season, Sanchez spent most of his
time on the bench, playing behind two cornerbacks —
Leigh Torrence and Stanley Wilson — who are currently

pursuing careers in the NF : L.
"You come in from high school
and you're used to being a star, and
then you come here and you have to
take a backseat to the older guys,"
Sanchez said. "It's kind of tough, es
pecially when the team is struggling
and you think you can go out there
and make something happen. You
wish you could get in there but we
had some great players in front of
me."
The clear advantage of Sanchez's
situation was that he could use the
older, more experienced players to
help him elevate his own game.
"|Torrence and Wilson] played
real hard, and they're obviously verv

talented to make it to the next level.
While I was actually trying to com
pete with them to get in to play, 1 val
ued the time watching them. 1
learned a lot from them.They helped
turn me from the player I was when 1
got here to the player I am today."
The experience on the bench has
also made his time on the field that
much more special.
"It's great to finally get out there
to play in the Pac-10 — one of the
best conferences in the nation,"
Sanchez said. "You get to see some
of the best quarterback and wideout
combinations,and the competition is
great. It makes you feel good when
you go out and make a big play. It's
just a real good feeling to get out and
compete with the best."
Now that he has gotten a chance
to play. Sanchez has made the most
of his opportunity. In many situa
tions he has earned the right to cover

opposing teams' number-one receiv
er. a challenge he faces head on.
"As a defensive back there is
nothing better than getting to go out
there and lock dow.n the other
team's best wideout," Sanchez said.
"Whenever you get the chance, you
can't wait to go out there and com
pete against the best and see if you
can shut them down."

tomorrow if he is to guard Arizona
State's top receiver Derek Hagan.
1 lagan owns nearly every Arizona
State receiving record and has al
ready caught for 639 yards and six
touchdowns this season.
If Sanchez and the Cardinal de
fense can come up with the big plays
once again against Arizona State,
thev may have to find a new place for
inspiration because the critics will
have to change their tune.

take a backseat to the older guys,"
Sanchez said. "It's kind of tough, es
pecially when the team is struggling
and you think you can go out there
and make something happen. You
wish you could get in there but we
had some great players in front of
me."
The clear advantage of Sanchez's
situation was that he could use the
older, more experienced players to
help him elevate his own game.
"|Torrence and Wilson] played
real hard, and they're obviously verv

talented to make it to the next level.

learned a lot from them.They helped
turn me from the player I was when 1
got here to the player I am today."
The experience on the bench has
also made his time on the field that
much more special.
"It's great to finally get out there
to play in the Pac-10 — one of the
best conferences in the nation,"
Sanchez said. "You get to see some
of the best quarterback and wideout
combinations,and the competition is
great. It makes you feel good when
you go out and make a big play. It's
just a real good feeling to get out and
compete with the best."
Now that he has gotten a chance
to play. Sanchez has made the most
of his opportunity. In many situa

opposing teams' number-one receiv

"As a defensive back there is
nothing better than getting to go out
there and lock dow.n the other
team's best wideout," Sanchez said.
"Whenever you get the chance, you
can't wait to go out there and com

can shut them down."

with an interception
on the Cougars' po
tential game winning
drive and sealed the
24-21 win for Stan
ford.
By stepping in
front of the Alex Brink
pass, Sanchez and the
Cardinal defense
showed that they were
capable of coming up
with a big stop, some
thing that had looked
all but impossible
three weeks ago.
It's fitting that it
was Sanchez who de
livered that message,
given that he has been
one of the most con
sistent members of
Stanford's much-ma
ligned defensive sec
ondary. He leads the
team in interceptions
and is second on the
team in tackles — a
surprising statistic
given that he is a cor
nerback.
Yet despite his

personal success and the success of the secondary in the last
two games — both slim victories — Sanchez is still moti
vated by those who doubt the team's abilities.
"People like to hate on us a little bit because we're

young — at least they say we're young and fairly inexperi
enced," Sanchez said. "We're out there trying to make a
play and when people talk bad about us, I feel it fuels us a
little bit to want to go out there, prove ourselves and show
that we're not a bad secondary. We can stop the pass. When
ever we hear stuff like that, we just want to go out there to
prove a point and show that we can play in the Pac-10."
The defense's task has been made doubly difficult due to
the Cardinal's offensive woes. In the first half of last week's
victory over Arizona, the defense was on the field for twice
as long as the offense. ITiis, along with injury trouble in the
secondary, has made Sanchez's job that much more impor

tant and demanding.
"We have the mindset that we are on defense and our
main goal is to get off the field and let the offense come in,"
Sanchez said. "Before a third down we always say 'get off the
field.' We always try to do our part, make plays, get off the
field and let our offense come out and get a chance to score."
Sanchez hasn't always had the opportunity to be on the
field making plays. Last season, Sanchez spent most of his
time on the bench, playing behind two cornerbacks —
Leigh Torrence and Stanley Wilson — who are currently
