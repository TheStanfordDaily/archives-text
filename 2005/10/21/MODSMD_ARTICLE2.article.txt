## After a year on the bench, Sanchez shines 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
With just under one minute left and Stanford clinging to
a slim three-point lead over Washington State, junior cor
nerback Nick Sanchez answered his critics.
To all those who said that the Cardinal would not win an
other game after a brutal home loss to Oregon, Sanchez

replied. He replied
with an interception
on the Cougars' po
tential game winning
drive and sealed the
24-21 win for Stan
ford.
By stepping in
front of the Alex Brink
pass, Sanchez and the
Cardinal defense
showed that they were
capable of coming up
with a big stop, some
thing that had looked
all but impossible
three weeks ago.
It's fitting that it
was Sanchez who de
livered that message,
given that he has been
one of the most con
sistent members of
Stanford's much-ma
ligned defensive sec
ondary. He leads the
team in interceptions
and is second on the
team in tackles — a
surprising statistic
given that he is a cor
nerback.
Yet despite his

personal success and the success of the secondary in the last
two games — both slim victories — Sanchez is still moti
vated by those who doubt the team's abilities.
"People like to hate on us a little bit because we're

young — at least they say we're young and fairly inexperi
enced," Sanchez said. "We're out there trying to make a
play and when people talk bad about us, I feel it fuels us a
little bit to want to go out there, prove ourselves and show
that we're not a bad secondary. We can stop the pass. When
ever we hear stuff like that, we just want to go out there to
prove a point and show that we can play in the Pac-10."
The defense's task has been made doubly difficult due to
the Cardinal's offensive woes. In the first half of last week's
victory over Arizona, the defense was on the field for twice
as long as the offense. ITiis, along with injury trouble in the
secondary, has made Sanchez's job that much more impor

tant and demanding.
"We have the mindset that we are on defense and our
main goal is to get off the field and let the offense come in,"
Sanchez said. "Before a third down we always say 'get off the
field.' We always try to do our part, make plays, get off the
field and let our offense come out and get a chance to score."
Sanchez hasn't always had the opportunity to be on the
field making plays. Last season, Sanchez spent most of his
time on the bench, playing behind two cornerbacks —
Leigh Torrence and Stanley Wilson — who are currently
