# Speeding athletes, but no Mercedes
## 
### 
A riddle: I'm prized for speed and
stamina. You can hear me going all
night long on the weekends. I can
be found chained up in the strangest of
places. Basically, everyone just wants to
ride me. What am I?
Haha. Very funny. You better get your
mind out of the gutter before it gets run
over by the real answer to this riddle. Yes,
friends, the following column is two ath
letes' humble ode to alternative campus
transportation.
We have to assume that in the beginning,
there were only one or two golf carts tooting
around the Farm. But somehow, two became
four, and four became eight, and suddenly,
this campus seems to have more golf carts
than black squirrels. Ever notice how you
can't park your bike in front of Stern without
worrying whether it's in danger of being de
voured by the monstrous pack of four
wheelers penned outside of Meyer Library?
Carts lurk in fields and alleyways, behind
Suites and in front of the CoHo. Mv good
ness, they Ye everywhere.
Now, any normal person might think to
himself. "Sweet Jesus, what sort of cata
strophic event swept through this campus
that could have disabled so many of its resi
dents? After all, campus policy clearly states
that golf carts must only be distributed to
students for strictly medical reasons." But
you, ever the savvy Daily reader, probably
realize that something's a little fishy about
that. As in,"medical reason" is what Einstein
might call a "relative term." As in, either a
baby meteor fell out of the sky and struck
from Mirrielees to the football field without
dropping a pebble on the rest of campus, or
else athletes have some miraculous ability to
acquire golf carts in situations where the

sportless gimps don't have a chance.
Ever notice how you've got to be on your
guard traveling past the Band Shak these
days? You never know when you might
have to crash your bike to avoid being flat
tened by The Caravan. You know: the six
speeding carts containing five soccer play
ers, one pair of crutches, a trainer, the chauf
feur and the water boy? (There's a seventh,
but that one is just for carrying the
Gatorade jugs.) More often than not, if you
have time to get a good look at the ruff rid
ers before you swerve that pretty bicycle of
yours into the sand volleyball courts, you'll
notice that they seem to have four robust
and healthy-looking limbs. Intriguing.
We're not saying they don't deserve the
wheels. We know that breaking a fingernail
on the Astroturf hurts like the dickens, but
let's be honest... if a scrawny math major
with two left feet broke that same fingernail
trying to open his Calc 9(XJ book, would he
get the same treatment? But the point is,
these people are supposed to have superior
athletic ability. If it's not golf carts, it's those
cute little motorized scooters. Why can't they
bike or, God forbid, walk like everyone else?
At this point, we'd like to include a tan
gent, if we may.
Scooters. You've seen 'em. Just one step
down from the geezer-mobiles that have

been terrorizing nursing homes for the past
decade, the scooters themselves look like
they should be dodging traffic on the streets
of Bangkok. But slap a 3(X)-pound line
backer on the seat and you've got yourself a
grand spectacle. It must be a magical mo
ment the first time one of these scooters
finds a home. Its delighted owner races
downstairs, exhumes the tiny vehicle from its
Styrofoam-and-cardboard enclosure, swings
his leg over the seat and ... it bends.
Now back to your regularly scheduled
programming.
The golf cart inequity doesn't end there.
Does the diving team roll around in pretty
personal golf carts? That'll be a negative. In
deed, golf carts aren't just the hot item on
campus â€” they're the bling.the ride, the ath
letic status symbol. High-profile sports on
campus can be identified by three things: the
number of seats they fill, the number of T
shirts they sell and the number of golf carts at
their disposal.
NCAA rules are pretty clear about the fact
that the Athletic Department can't go
around giving out Mercedes for good per
formances. But after last week's win in Ari
zona, the football team will no doubt find
themselves in control of a few more sets of
wheels for their "injured" players to pimp
out with spinning rims and bumper stickers
that read."Picture me rollin'."
And while we are glad to hear about their
thrilling victories and winning record, one
begins to wonder: Of all the athletes that can
be seen cruising around campus in all their
glory, why are none of them actually golfers?
