## It gives you wings â€” well, most of the time... 
### DAVID HERBERT 
You may have noticed that in my last two
columns. Red Bull has played a central role in my hi
jinks in Berlin.This is because a) it is delicious and b)
it goes well with a certain other beverage. But what
Red Bull giveth. it can also taketh away. It may in
fact "give you wings." but like Icarus, I Hew too close
to the sun last Friday, and my night ended in disaster.
So Chris, Kelsey and I roll into the trendy Sage
Gub in Kreuzberg around midnight with Brent and
Ara, two other Stanford students. Who is Ara you
ask? Imagine an Armenian version of Vito Cor
rleone who takes drinking as seriously as the Mob
does killing. So Ara generously takes the initiative to
reserve and pay for a 24() euro VIP table at the club
and manages to herd the three of us in.
In a colossal error, we show up quite drunk, un
aware of the many gruesome ways this mistake is
about to manifest itself. We get seated at a table
with leather couches on a roped off. elevated plat
form a few steps up from the main dance area.
TVanslation: We are about to become the most pop
ular guys in the club.

Everybody's eyeing us like we're professional
soccer players, when in fact I am an amateur squash
player. Chris played Hamlet this spring and Kelsey
grew up on a former commune in NorCal. Nonethe
less. we ignore our innocent roots and play the part,
calling over German girls we'd spotted earlier to
come sit with us.
Then the trouble begins. The bartender comes
over and dumps a giant ice bucket on our table. The
contents? A 1.5 liter bottle of Skyy Vodka and a half
dozen cans of Red Bull. We immediately go to town
like we're at Primal Snack, except you can have as
many Krispy Kremes as you want and they're all
laced with crack. Problem is, it's a club. there's
music, and there's madness, and you never have any
idea how much you are actually imbibing. Before
long, Chris. Kelsey and I are sick as dogs. Chris and I
make it to the bathroom, but Kelsey's not quite as
lucky. He vomits on the couch. And in the ice buck
et. And at a Ilirkish deli that Ara later takes him to.
And on the U-Bahn on the way home.
Needless to say, it was an historic night for Stan
ford in Berlin.Three students all ended up hugging
porcelain (or in one case, a couch) within the span of

an hour. You may label us degenerates and call the
evening vile. I see a Facebook group.
To top it off, Ara was surfing the Sage Club Web
site last night (ed note: Thursday night) and found a
photo of the five of us early in the evening, which can
now be found at the newly formed Facebook group
"I Puked at Sage Club in Berlin." Seriously.
In other somewhat-related news, I realized that
everything I've ever gotten in trouble for in Ameri
ca is legal here. Drinking in public? Ixgal! Speed
ing? Ixgal! And public urination? Just take a look at
this exchange Chris and I had with some Germans
(who spoke Fnglish. thankfully) as we exited a sub
way station.
We put our empty beer cans down by a chainlink
fence and prepare to urinate against a wall.
German girl: "Hey! You can't leave your cans
there!"
Me: "No. no! We just need to piss!"
German girl: "Oh. Okay."

I )avid is sorry that this column was so base. If you, too,
