They're minors for a reason
I would like to echo Noelle Patno's
sentiments ("Vote 'Yes' on Prop. 73")
and urge California adults to vote in
favor of the proposition this Nov. 8.
How can we deem minors mature
enough to make vital decisions about
pregnancy and abortion and confront
the associated physical and emotional

challenges without parental support
when we do not even consider them
competent to vote on the upcoming
ballot? Parents should be involved in
decisions regarding the medical care
of their children, just as the parents,
not the children, will be involved in
voting for Prop. 73.
