## Breaking it down: the White Sox are the pick 
### 
The Houston Astros advanced to their first World
Series in franchise history with a victory over the
St. Louis Cardinals Wednesday night. There, they
will take on the Chicago White Sox. a team that hasn't
taken the championship since World War I.
Never mind that this setup is a curse-buster's dream,
it's going to be one of the most evenly matched and excit
ing World Series in a long time. And for once, we won't
have to hear a bunch of whinv East Coasters talking
about the BoSox or the Yanks.
First and foremost, this series will be a story of pitch
ing. Both the Sox and'Stros finished the season in the top
three for staff ERA (Houston: 3.51: Chicago: 3.61).The
starting rotations could easily be an All-Star team. l"or
Houston. Roger Clemens. Andy Pettite and Roy Oswalt
are the Big Three, combining for a 50-29 record through
out the year. The staff held the vaunted Cardinals' of
fense, third in the National League, to five runs or fewer
in each game en route to the series victory.
For the Sox. it's the Four \ lorsemen of the Apocalypse
(which coincidentally was predicted should a team from
Chicago ever win the Series). Jon Garland, Mark Buehrle,
Freddie Garcia and Jose Contreras are the four hottest
pitchers of the postseason. These guys made Vlad Guer
rero look like Vlad the Impaler (also known as Dracula):
he just suckcd.They threw four complete games in a row
during the LCS to send the Angels packing.
Advantage: Chicago
The relief corps will have to be utilized, if for no other
reason than fatigue.These starting rotations have putin a
lot of innings, and it's going to be up
to the bullpen to shut things down
once the starters are gassed. I like
Houston's Brad Lidge over the
Sox's Bobby Jenks.
Despite the fact that Albert Pu
jols hit one out of the area code in
Game 5, making Lidge cry like
Christmas had been cancelled, the
'Stros stopper is still the second best
closer in the game (behind Mariano
Rivera of the Yankees). His stuff is
electric and as long as there aren't
any more hanging sliders, he should
be able to shut down Chi-town.
Furthermore, Jenks hasn't seen
action since the division series. He's
been out of work longer than Tom
Delay. While his stuff may still be
good, you've got to think that the
rust might get to the untested closer
at some point.
Advantage: Houston
Thank God these two teams can
pitch,because the hitting leaves some
thing to be desired. Neither has an
MVP caliber bat in the lineup. They
can, however, put up numbers in their
small parks, which should keep things
entertaining for the easily bored.
These are really small-ball teams
though. Even if the Sox put up 200
homers on the year, they get more
action out of Scott Podsednik steal
ing and squeezing his way home. For
the Astros, Willy Tavarez looks to
play the same role but he's too
prone to strike outs. Furthermore,
Roger Clemens finished the season
with an ERA of 1.87, but a record of
13-8. How do you lose eight games?
It's easy when the offense gives you
fewer than two runs a game.
Advantage: Chicago
Well, if you're not banging them
out, you've got to scrap them out.
The managers of both squads arc
fantastic at manufacturing the one
or two runs a game that will make
the difference in this series. Phil
Garner took a team that started the
season 15 games below .500 and
brought them to the top. Ozzie
Guillen turned a bunch of scrappers
into championship contenders. Both
men are delightfully blunt with the
press, making them all the more en
joyable. You'd love to see either win,
and they've both made all the right
moves to get here.
Advantage: Even
In the end, this series is going to
come down to the pitching and time
ly hitting. As much as it kills me to go
against my home-state team, the
Houston Astros, I've got to give the
series to the White Sox. They're just
a little deeper and hit a bit better. To
have a chance to take the series,
Houston's going to have to rough up
the starter four times, an unlikely
event given the over .600 winning
percentage of the Sox rotation.
The verdict: Chicago in six

into championship contenders. Both
men are delightfully blunt with the
press, making them all the more en
joyable. You'd love to see either win,
and they've both made all the right
moves to get here.
Advantage: Even
In the end, this series is going to
come down to the pitching and time
ly hitting. As much as it kills me to go
against my home-state team, the
Houston Astros, I've got to give the
series to the White Sox. They're just
a little deeper and hit a bit better. To
have a chance to take the series,
Houston's going to have to rough up
the starter four times, an unlikely
event given the over .600 winning
percentage of the Sox rotation.
The verdict: Chicago in six

The Houston Astros advanced to their first World
Series in franchise history with a victory over the
St. Louis Cardinals Wednesday night. There, they
will take on the Chicago White Sox. a team that hasn't
taken the championship since World War I.
Never mind that this setup is a curse-buster's dream,
it's going to be one of the most evenly matched and excit
ing World Series in a long time. And for once, we won't
have to hear a bunch of whinv East Coasters talking
about the BoSox or the Yanks.
First and foremost, this series will be a story of pitch
ing. Both the Sox and'Stros finished the season in the top
three for staff ERA (Houston: 3.51: Chicago: 3.61).The
starting rotations could easily be an All-Star team. l"or
Houston. Roger Clemens. Andy Pettite and Roy Oswalt
are the Big Three, combining for a 50-29 record through
out the year. The staff held the vaunted Cardinals' of
fense, third in the National League, to five runs or fewer
in each game en route to the series victory.
For the Sox. it's the Four \ lorsemen of the Apocalypse
(which coincidentally was predicted should a team from
Chicago ever win the Series). Jon Garland, Mark Buehrle,
Freddie Garcia and Jose Contreras are the four hottest
pitchers of the postseason. These guys made Vlad Guer
rero look like Vlad the Impaler (also known as Dracula):
he just suckcd.They threw four complete games in a row
during the LCS to send the Angels packing.
Advantage: Chicago
The relief corps will have to be utilized, if for no other
reason than fatigue.These starting rotations have putin a
lot of innings, and it's going to be up
to the bullpen to shut things down
once the starters are gassed. I like
Houston's Brad Lidge over the
Sox's Bobby Jenks.
Despite the fact that Albert Pu
jols hit one out of the area code in
Game 5, making Lidge cry like
Christmas had been cancelled, the
'Stros stopper is still the second best
closer in the game (behind Mariano
Rivera of the Yankees). His stuff is
electric and as long as there aren't
any more hanging sliders, he should
be able to shut down Chi-town.
Furthermore, Jenks hasn't seen
action since the division series. He's
been out of work longer than Tom
Delay. While his stuff may still be
good, you've got to think that the
rust might get to the untested closer
at some point.
Advantage: Houston
Thank God these two teams can
pitch,because the hitting leaves some
thing to be desired. Neither has an
MVP caliber bat in the lineup. They
can, however, put up numbers in their
small parks, which should keep things
entertaining for the easily bored.
These are really small-ball teams
though. Even if the Sox put up 200
homers on the year, they get more
action out of Scott Podsednik steal
ing and squeezing his way home. For
the Astros, Willy Tavarez looks to
play the same role but he's too
prone to strike outs. Furthermore,
Roger Clemens finished the season
with an ERA of 1.87, but a record of
13-8. How do you lose eight games?
It's easy when the offense gives you
fewer than two runs a game.
Advantage: Chicago
Well, if you're not banging them
out, you've got to scrap them out.
The managers of both squads arc
fantastic at manufacturing the one
or two runs a game that will make
the difference in this series. Phil
Garner took a team that started the
season 15 games below .500 and
brought them to the top. Ozzie
Guillen turned a bunch of scrappers
into championship contenders. Both
men are delightfully blunt with the
press, making them all the more en
joyable. You'd love to see either win,
and they've both made all the right
moves to get here.
