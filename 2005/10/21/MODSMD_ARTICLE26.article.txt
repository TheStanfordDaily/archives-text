# No. 8 Card look to get on track
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With half the season and
two Pacific-10 Conference
losses in the record books, the
No. 5 Stanford women's vol
leyball team (17-3.6-2 Pac-10)
has experienced its share of
ups and downs this season.
The momentum of a 15-
game win-streak was lost at
the hands of No. 2 Washington
on Oct. 8. Last week's 3-2 loss
to No. 8 Arizona didn't do
much to boost Stanford's con
fidence either.
Yet despite dropping from
third in the nation to fifth in
last Sunday's AVCA coaches'
poll and slipping to a tie for
third in the Pac-10, the Cardi
nal remain confident in their
chances of winning the squad's
first conference title in four
years.

"I firmly believe it's not over until it's over,
so the Pac-10 is definitely still within reach."
head coach John Dunning said before adding.
"1 would say we have to improve and be pret
ty flawless along the way."
Senior setter Katie Goldhahn said she is es
pecially motivated since this is her last chance
at Stanford to win a conference title.
"Judging by the results of the first half of
the season, we're going to have to work really
hard in practice and games to pull off these
next few wins." she said."! think everyone on

The Cardinal will try to re
gain momentum in Pac-10
play tonight as they visit No.
14 California (13-4,6-2), who
has beaten Stanford in Berke
ley for the past two years.
Stanford took the first match
from the Golden Bears last
year, 3-2, before falling at Cal,
2-3.
Both teams share identical
Pac-10 records, each losing to
only Washington and Ari
zona. Fresh off a 0-3 loss to
the Wildcats last Friday, the
Golden Bears are eager to
make a big statement in the
Pac-10 with a win over Stan
ford.
Cal is hitting .265, ranking
fourth in the conference. The
Bears' Angie Pressey, a soph-

omorc outside hitter, is third in the Pac-10 with
4.45 kills per game. Pressey recorded a career
high 25 kills for a .327 hitting percentage in last
season's win over the Cardinal.
As a team, Cal is third in the conference in
opponent hitting (.158) and fifth in blocks
(2.85 per game) and digs (15.37 per game).

tack. Barboza leads the team with
4.57 kills per game and Richards and
freshman middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo are both averaging
over four kills per game. Stanford is
hitting .286 as a team and is limiting
opponents to .154.
"Beating Cal would be really
great for us, and they're really good
at home," Richards said. "We're
doing a good job working toward
what we want to accomplish. There's
a lot of competition in the Pac-10.
Everybody always plays really good
against us, and that's what comes
with playing [against] Stanford."
Goldhahn said the team has been
preparing for Cal by working on the
skills learned in the Cardinal's two
recent losses.
"We're working hard and taking
from the good things we did in the

losses against Arizona and Washing
ton," she said. "We've worked on
being able to terminate when other
teams give us freeballs. We're just
working on the offense, to be really
competitive on the service line."
Dunning said that Stanford has
focused on blocking, a weakness ex
posed during the Arizona contest.
He added that the team must work
on its mentality as it heads into
matches.
' Part of improving has to do with
changing technique, meaning chang
ing attitude and being aggressive,"
Dunning said. "We didn't start very
well against Arizona and teams have
to find a way to get in the frame of
mind for the best possible perform
ance. We had two of our best prac
tices of the year right after our loss to
Washington, and this week's prac
tices have been even better.
"It's hard to play on the road any
where, but Cal is a good team and
will definitely have the advantage at
home," Dunning added. "This will be
a Pac-10 war."

losses in the record books, the
No. 5 Stanford women's vol
leyball team (17-3.6-2 Pac-10)
has experienced its share of
ups and downs this season.
The momentum of a 15-
game win-streak was lost at
the hands of No. 2 Washington
on Oct. 8. Last week's 3-2 loss
to No. 8 Arizona didn't do
much to boost Stanford's con
fidence either.
Yet despite dropping from
third in the nation to fifth in
last Sunday's AVCA coaches'
poll and slipping to a tie for
third in the Pac-10, the Cardi
nal remain confident in their
chances of winning the squad's
first conference title in four
years.

"I firmly believe it's not over until it's over,
so the Pac-10 is definitely still within reach."
head coach John Dunning said before adding.
"1 would say we have to improve and be pret
ty flawless along the way."
Senior setter Katie Goldhahn said she is es
pecially motivated since this is her last chance
at Stanford to win a conference title.
"Judging by the results of the first half of
the season, we're going to have to work really
hard in practice and games to pull off these
next few wins." she said."! think everyone on

The Cardinal will try to re
gain momentum in Pac-10
play tonight as they visit No.
14 California (13-4,6-2), who
has beaten Stanford in Berke
ley for the past two years.
Stanford took the first match
from the Golden Bears last
year, 3-2, before falling at Cal,
2-3.
Both teams share identical
Pac-10 records, each losing to
only Washington and Ari
zona. Fresh off a 0-3 loss to
the Wildcats last Friday, the
Golden Bears are eager to
make a big statement in the
Pac-10 with a win over Stan
ford.
Cal is hitting .265, ranking
fourth in the conference. The
Bears' Angie Pressey, a soph-

omorc outside hitter, is third in the Pac-10 with
4.45 kills per game. Pressey recorded a career
high 25 kills for a .327 hitting percentage in last
season's win over the Cardinal.
As a team, Cal is third in the conference in
opponent hitting (.158) and fifth in blocks
(2.85 per game) and digs (15.37 per game).

tack. Barboza leads the team with
4.57 kills per game and Richards and
freshman middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo are both averaging
over four kills per game. Stanford is
hitting .286 as a team and is limiting
opponents to .154.
"Beating Cal would be really
great for us, and they're really good
at home," Richards said. "We're
doing a good job working toward
what we want to accomplish. There's
a lot of competition in the Pac-10.
Everybody always plays really good
against us, and that's what comes
with playing [against] Stanford."
Goldhahn said the team has been
preparing for Cal by working on the
skills learned in the Cardinal's two
recent losses.
"We're working hard and taking
from the good things we did in the

losses against Arizona and Washing
ton," she said. "We've worked on
being able to terminate when other
teams give us freeballs. We're just
working on the offense, to be really
competitive on the service line."
Dunning said that Stanford has
focused on blocking, a weakness ex
posed during the Arizona contest.
He added that the team must work
on its mentality as it heads into
matches.
' Part of improving has to do with
changing technique, meaning chang
ing attitude and being aggressive,"
Dunning said. "We didn't start very
well against Arizona and teams have
to find a way to get in the frame of
mind for the best possible perform
ance. We had two of our best prac
tices of the year right after our loss to
Washington, and this week's prac
tices have been even better.
"It's hard to play on the road any
where, but Cal is a good team and
will definitely have the advantage at
home," Dunning added. "This will be
a Pac-10 war."
