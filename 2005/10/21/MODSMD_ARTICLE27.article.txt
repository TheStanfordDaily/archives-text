# Garton shows his versatility on both ends of the pool
## Cardinal travel to Southern California to face No. 8 Long Beach State after a strong showing at the NorCal Open

When it comes to water polo, junior J.J. Gar
ton is capable of doing just about anything.
The Stanford Media Guide lists him as a
two-meter defender, but that title only begins to
tell the story of Garton's numerous contribu
tions to the Cardinal (12-3,1-0 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) this year.
It's true that Garton will take his turn grind
ing things out at the two-meter mark against an
opposing team's setman — but only on occa
sion. Garton's primary responsibility in the
pool is as simple as it is critical: find the opposi
tion's greatest scoring threat, mark him up and
shut him down.
It's a challenging job — one that stands out
as a potentially deciding factor in every game
the Cardinal play. But there's likely no other
player Stanford would rather see on the job
than Garton, and it's equally likely that the
squad couldn't find anyone better even if it
tried.
"'Mv biggest strength is my defense," Garton
said. "It always has been. It's what I've devel
oped over the years because it's something I can
repeat. It's just something that I've worked at

and have focused on getting disciplined about."
Consistency has been the signature mark of
Garton's work on the Farm — not surprisingly,
considering the attitude he takes in honing his
defensive game every time he jumps in the pool.
"[Defense] is a lot more about discipline and
repetition than [it is about] creativity; every day
you can go out there and play good defense," he
said.
But after the loss of water polo legend Tony
Azevedo and five other starters to graduation
last year, head coach John Vargas made it clear
to Garton that the team would need him to pro
vide more than just quality defensive play.
"I've just had to step up my game a lot more
on the offensive end," Garton said."[The last two
years] we had so much firepower that I didn't re
ally need to extend myself onto the offensive side
of the ball as much. But now I have to handle the
ball a lot more, which is one of the reasons I'm
not guarding [at two-meter defender] as much."
And step up he has — after a hat-trick per
formance in Stanford's narrow 10-9 loss to top
ranked Southern California last weekend, Gar
ton stands fifth on the Cardinal scoring list with
11 goals.
But the manner in which he has netted those
goals is perhaps equally impressive.

"I've been posting up a lot,so I'll get most of
my goals around the two-meter mark ," Garton
said. "[And the rest] I'll get on the counterat
tack."
It's not often that players emerge with the
size and strength to battle for position down low
as well as the speed and anticipation to score on
the transition, but Garton possesses a diversity
of talents that makes him a versatile weapon for
the Cardinal.
Given his wide range of skills as a player, it's
not surprising that Garton has also succeeded in
defining himself as one of the team's veteran
leaders. But Garton noted that his adjustment
to the role has been eased by the incredible
level of unity that this year's squad maintains.
"[There's] not really a hierarchy on the
team," he said. "We're more like a collective
group of guys, and if somebody wants to say
something, we say alright, absolutely. I'm just
trying to lead by example as much as I can —
I'm always trying to keep all the guys motivated
and to keep pushing them in a positive way."
For a player and teammate as accomplished
as Garton, a tougher task might be to identify
the weakness in his own game and skills. When
asked about it, Garton paused before offering
his response.
"My weakness is my outside shot," he said.
But he didn't hesitate in offering his assess
ment of the situation.
