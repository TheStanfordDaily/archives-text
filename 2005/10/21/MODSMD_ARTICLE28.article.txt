# Women's golf hosts Stanford Pepsi Invitational
## Strong field headed to the Farm, including last year's NCAA champion Duke 
### DEVIN MARSH 
The Stanford women's golf team
has spent all week preparing for this
weekend's tournament, played at the
Stanford Golf Course. The 2005
Stanford Pepsi Invitational pits the
Cardinal women against 19 teams: a
field consisting of all the Pacific-10
Conference teams, Pepperdine,
Texas A&M and last year's NCAA
champion, Duke.
Stanford finished in fourth place
last year, 17 strokes behind a strong
Arizona State team led by Pac-10
player of the year Louise Stahle.
Senior Kelly Husted and juniors
Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana and
Lauren Todd led the Cardinal in last

year's tournament with a score of
219, good for a three-way tie for 20th
place. Last year, junior Jenna Seki
turned in an impressive final round,
posting a season- and career-low of
71 and one-over-par, and is undoubt
edly looking forward to a return to
the familiar course.
Many of the players who did well
last year are also returning and look
ing to duplicate their success. Wash
ington State's All-American Anasta
sia Kostina, last year's individual
winner with a 205 and five-under
par, returns this year as a senior hop
ing for a repeat performance. Also
returning to the tournament after a
second-place tie last year is Arizona
senior Cassandra Kirkland, who shot

a 207 and three-under-par.
The Cardinal look to start strong
as they did at last week's Edean lh
lanfeldt Invitational in Sahalee
Country Club in Sammamish, Wash.
The Cardinal were tied for second
after the first round — with
Tangtiphaiboontana holding a share
of the individual lead — but fell to a
seventh place tie after a disappoint
ing day two.
After a stronger performance on
day three,the Cardinal finished in sixth
place, with Tangtiphaiboontana taking
seventh place in individual honors.
The field of competitors in Wash
ington was led by Pepperdine, which
finished in first place, aided by three
top-five individual finishes. Pepper
dine was followed by Arizona State,
Southern California, UNLV and Ari
zona.
The Cardinal are scheduled to
face all five of these teams again this

weekend, including last week's indi
vidual winner, Arizona State's Jen
nifer Osborn, who shot a 215 and
one-under-par. USC's Irene Cho,
who finished second individually
with 217 and one-over-par, also plans
to make an appearance.
No. 2 Pepperdine took third,
fourth and a tie for fifth place in indi
vidual finishes, with teammates
Leanna Bowditch, Carolina Llano
and Eileen Vargas shooting a 221,
222 and 223 respectively. The Waves
are in all likelihood looking to repeat
their performance.
Husted, along with Tangtiphai
boontana, Todd and impressive
freshman Mari Chun look to help the
Cardinal build on their quick start
last weekend, this time playing in
their own backyard. Tournament
play begins today at 7 a.m. at the
Stanford Golf Course and lasts
through Sunday.
