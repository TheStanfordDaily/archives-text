# No. 21 Cardinal travel to Arizona to face ASU,U of A
## Stanford searching for offense after a tough 2-0 loss to Pac-10 rival California 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Chartering fairly unfamiliar territo
ry, Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe
and the women's soccer team pre
pared for a match after a loss this week.
After all, the past month has seen No.
21 Stanford (8-4-1, 2-1-0 Pacific-10
Conference) in outstanding form,
notching five consecutive victories.
Last weekend, however, cross-Bay
rival California put an end to the win
streak with a 2-0 victory, which saw
the Golden Bears' keeper Ashley Sul
prizio shut out Stanford's attack in a
performance that earned her Pac-10
Player of the Week. But if anyone
thought a loss would dent the Cardi
nal's confidence, they were wrong.
This week has been about regroup
ing and refocusing for the Cardinal.
This weekend they continue Pac-10
play against Arizona State (8-5-2,3-1-
0) on Friday before Sunday's match
up against Arizona (8-4-2,3-1-0). De
spite the inevitable disappointment
from last weekend's defeat, Ratcliffe
is hoping that the loss inspires the
team, rather than dishearten them.
"We have to regroup and just
keep [going]," Ratcliffe said. "It was
an emotional game [against Cal], so
hopefully the team will be a little bit
ter and they'll come back and have a
good end to the Pac-10 season."
Arizona State is currently tied for
third place in the conference and has
equaled its best start to the Pac-10
season at 3-1-0. Seniors Elizabeth

Bogus and Brittany Cooper present
a formidable threat to Cardinal
goalie freshman Alex Gamble, after
both players scored impressive goals
in last weekend's matches. Bogus' 31
career goals currently place her sec
ond in the Sun Devil's record books.
Last year's conference winner, Ari
zona, is also sitting third in the confer
ence with a 3-1-0 record. While the
Cardinal's only loss to the Wildcats
was last season's 1-0 double overtime
defeat, Arizona head coach Dan To
bias is no doubt looking for a repeat
this Sunday. At the helm of Arizona's
attack is senior midfielder Mallory
Miller, whose 1.07 goals per game av
erage is ranked seventh in the nation.
"Both Arizona schools are strong
programs with good players," sopho
more midfielder Rachel Buehler
said. "I think that the biggest thing
for us this weekend will be focusing
on ourselves. We need to come out
ready and excited to play our game
of soccer."
After failing to score last week
end, Stanford is determined not to re
turn home with missed opportunities.
The Cardinal have dedicated them
selves this week to working diligently
on improving their final touches.
"We've been continuing to work
on our play in the final third, espe
cially getting crosses in and getting
on the end of those crosses," Buehler
said. "Our buildup play has im
proved tremendously throughout
this season. We are focusing now on
the final ball and finishing."
