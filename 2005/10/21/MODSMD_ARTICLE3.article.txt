The television cameras and film crew
may have made it obvious, hut the 35 stu
dents in Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing Prof. Martin Fischer's "Maintaining Sus
tainable Building Projects" class knew
something unusual was afoot as they shuf
fled into the 8:30 a.m. class yesterday morn
ing.
E-mail correspondences from Fischer
days prior to the event implored students
to arrive to class on time, since it would be
taught by a guest lecturer — renowned ar
chitect and designer William McDonough.
What the unassuming students didn't
know, but soon found out, was that their
lecture was to be led by not one but two
guest speakers — including actress
Cameron Diaz.
Diaz surprised the class as part of
mtvU's "Stand In" television series, in
which celebrities and public figures act as
guest professors and teach classes on sub
jects about which they are passionate. Yes
terday, Diaz and McDonough discussed

the sustainable building movement and
other civil engineering ideas aimed to pro
tect the environment.
"I love the environment," Diaz said.
"It's something I feel very strongly about.
I'm a consumer and have everything I've
always wanted, so I've looked into ways to
consume without being damaging to the
environment. And I came across the sus
tainable movement."
Opening with a "Hi, I'm Cameron," ac
companied by her initial trademark laugh
and a "smarty pants" comment after McDo
nough praised Stanford's reputation, Diaz
took on the dual role of moderator and moti
vator, leading discussions among students
and entreating them to harness their creative
energies to achieve a greater good.
"What are you guys going to do?" she
asked the class. "How far are you going to
take it?"
McDonough, who is currently serving as
a consulting professor of civil and environ
mental engineering at Stanford, shared
with the class his visions of a green, Utopian
world and expressed his hopes for the future.
