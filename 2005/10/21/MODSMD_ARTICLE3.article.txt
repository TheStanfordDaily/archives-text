# Cameron Diaz gives surprise guest lecture
## Actress comes to Stanford for mtvU program "Stand In" 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD ALIYYA HAQUE DESK EDITORS 
The television cameras and film crew
may have made it obvious, hut the 35 stu
dents in Civil and Environmental Engineer
ing Prof. Martin Fischer's "Maintaining Sus
tainable Building Projects" class knew
something unusual was afoot as they shuf
fled into the 8:30 a.m. class yesterday morn
ing.
E-mail correspondences from Fischer
days prior to the event implored students
to arrive to class on time, since it would be
taught by a guest lecturer — renowned ar
chitect and designer William McDonough.
What the unassuming students didn't
know, but soon found out, was that their
lecture was to be led by not one but two
guest speakers — including actress
Cameron Diaz.
Diaz surprised the class as part of
mtvU's "Stand In" television series, in
which celebrities and public figures act as
guest professors and teach classes on sub
jects about which they are passionate. Yes
terday, Diaz and McDonough discussed

the sustainable building movement and
other civil engineering ideas aimed to pro
tect the environment.
"I love the environment," Diaz said.
"It's something I feel very strongly about.
I'm a consumer and have everything I've
always wanted, so I've looked into ways to
consume without being damaging to the
environment. And I came across the sus
tainable movement."
Opening with a "Hi, I'm Cameron," ac
companied by her initial trademark laugh
and a "smarty pants" comment after McDo
nough praised Stanford's reputation, Diaz
took on the dual role of moderator and moti
vator, leading discussions among students
and entreating them to harness their creative
energies to achieve a greater good.
"What are you guys going to do?" she
asked the class. "How far are you going to
take it?"
McDonough, who is currently serving as
a consulting professor of civil and environ
mental engineering at Stanford, shared
with the class his visions of a green, Utopian
world and expressed his hopes for the future.

Actress Cameron Diaz is one of two guest lectures in "Maintaining Sustainable
Building Projects." Diaz appeared as part of mtvU's "Stand In" television series.
"We are living in a tragic state of design,
where the world gets worse and worse instead
of getting better," he said. "We're getting more
efficient, but we're wasting our natural re
sources. So why not start now and create prod
ucts with environmentally-sound design? It's
your generation, so let's create buildings which
are 'more good' and not 'less bad."'
Diaz also emphasized the important role
students can play as proponents of sustainable
design, even on a small scale.
"You always hear the comment about
wanting to leave a big footprint in the sands
of time, but it can be a small footprint too,"
she said. "It doesn't need to be bigger, just
better. You guys can definitely be doing
these things. And it's very exciting. This [sus
tainability) is a great challenge for our gener
ation."
Students said they were largely impressed
with Diaz's genuine interest in environmental
ism and were surprised that she could lecture
on the subject at Stanford.
"The event was really amazing, and I was
very impressed by Diaz," said sophomore Fa
reez Giga. "I was impressed more so by how
she actually came to campus to talk about sus
tainability. She provided a lot of good informa
tion, especially because I was not as familiar
with some of the concepts, and so 1 definitely
learned a lot."
"We had no idea at all that something like
this would happen," added Alexandrah Go

" You always hear the
comment about wanting
to leave a big footprint in
the sands of time, but it
can be a small footprint
too. It doesn't need to be
bigger, just better."
— Cameron Diaz, actress

vere, a sophomore. "We kept getting e-mails
from Prof. Fischer telling us to be here on time,
but we had no clue that Cameron Diaz would
be here. She brought up a lot of good points, es
pecially how instead of making things 'less
bad,' we should be working to make things
'more good.'"
However, some, such as senior Christina
Liebner, felt that the discussion was superficial
since many in the class already supported the
idea of sustainability.
"The issue is very important to us, and I felt

like they were not presenting any new ideas,
but rather almost preaching to the choir," she
said. "It was very much like a pep talk, and I
wish they talked more about specifics and
finding ways to be more sustainable, instead of
just telling us to be sustainable."
Still, Liebner said she found the lecture to
be worthwhile.
"It was pretty broad, but it was good for
people who aren't as familiar with the con
cepts or haven't heard the arguments before,"
she said.
Fischer also said he was pleased with the
outcome of the lecture.
"It will definitely raise awareness of these
issues to a broad audience." he said. "We did
not get into specifics, but I will probably try to
bring Bill [McDonough] back for a follow-up
session. I do hope that all the students leave
with the question in their minds of how to de
sign things better."
In an interview with The Daily, Diaz re
marked on the importance of reaching out to
the college crowd.
"This is my first time speaking on a college
campus, and I like the idea of speaking to col
lege students because they are so enthusias
tic," she said."You guys have such a great influ
ence, which you can share with other people.
Good luck!"
The episode of "Stand In" will premiere on
mtvU's broadband network, mtvU Über, on
lliesdav, Nov. 1.
