## Sigma Theta Psi promotes breast cancer awareness week 
### MARK KOGAN 
If you walked through White Plaza on the
way to class earlier this week, you might have
been surprised to see students contemplating
breasts. No, the breasts didn't belong to people
but actually to models provided by Sigma Theta
Psi Multicultural Sorority to promote breast
cancer awareness.
The third annual Breast Cancer Awareness
Week began with the "Shoot for the Cure"
three-on-three basketball tournament on Sun
day and will end with the "Walk for the Cure,"
an all day activity at Golden Gate Park tomor
row.
Junior Amber McCartney, philanthropy
chair for Sigma Theta Psi, said she has been very
happy with the turnout for the week.
"This is the best week we've done so far;
we've had a great turn out in all events,"she said.
The most popular event to date was the kick
off three-on-three basketball tournament on
Sunday, Oct. 17. More than KX) students made
an appearance,either to participate in the tour
nament itself or to partake in the free barbecue

lunch.
"The turnout was amazing," McCartney said.
"It was a huge success."
Competitors said they came away with a pos
itive and rewarding experience.
"Coming out to their events is definitely
worth your time," said junior Maisha Davis, a
member of the winning girls' team. "I was ac
tively participating within minutes of my arrival.
There was 110 waiting and no confusion; every
thing ran as smoothly as possible."
Beyond the basketball tournament. Sigma
Ilieta Psi has organized a multitude of events,
ranging from watching "Sex and the City"
episodes on Wednesday night to "Salsa for the
Cure," a salsa dance party held tonight from 9
p.m. to midnight, featuring a live band at the
A3C Ballroom in Old Union.
Ihe sorority has focused on making events as
diverse and accessible as possible.
"As a multicultural sorority, we emphasize
awareness in all cultures," McCartney said. "We
are trying to be all over the place to get people
involved and get the word out."
And word has gotten out. There were infor

mation kiosks at every event, as well as a table
set up in White Plaza throughout the week.
"We've gotten great feedback from the post
card mailings especially," McCartney said, refer
ring to pre-paid postcards full of breast cancer
information that Sigma Theta Psi prepared for
the event. "All you have to do is put an address
on and send it to a friend. It's been very popu
lar."
Along with increased turnout, the sorority
has brought in a large amount of donations for
breast cancer research.
"We want to match the fundraising done in
past years," said junior Daisy Ramirez, the
sorority treasurer. "We've been doing very well
so far this week."
The sorority has also been doing its best to
garner the interest of men as well as women.
"It's very good that we've gotten a lot of in
formation across to males who don't think it's
very pertinent," Ramirez said. "Many men have
realized that the pink bracelet isn't just for girls
and it's not just a pink ribbon. Those are moth
ers and sisters out there."
Participants concurred.

"Although a person may not have been per
sonally affected by breast cancer, they know
someone who has or has friends whose family
has been affected" said junior India Alston."lt's
about supporting those people."
Hie week will close with the "Walk for the
Cure" event tomorrow at Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco. Stanford is expecting to bring at
least 20 students from various backgrounds and
organizations, including Sigma ITieta Psi, Delta
Sigma Theta, Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Sigma
Psi Zeta.The walk is part of a bigger event called
"Making Strides," a nationwide organization
sponsored by the American Cancer Society that
puts on this event every year all over the coun
try Stanford students will be joined by hundreds
of others for an all-day event that will include
speakers, activities and food. The walk itself is
from 8 to 10 a.m.
"One in every eight women is affected by
breast cancer," McCartney said. "With an intel
ligent community like Stanford, events like this
are very beneficial because students will pass on
information to their friends and families. It's a
lot of work, but it's worth it."
