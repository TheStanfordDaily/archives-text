# Soccer aiming for revenge one week after losses
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
After last weekend's excruciating
losses to Washington and Oregon
State, Stanford men's soccer (3-8-2,
0-4-1 Pacific-10 Conference) has an
immediate opportunity for
vengeance this week as the team
once again takes on the Beavers and
Huskies — this time in the North
west. To begin the second half of the
conference schedule, Stanford faces
Oregon State (8-3-4, 4-1-0) in Cor
vallis on Friday and then treks north
to Seattle for a match against Wash
ington (8-3-2,2-2-1) on Sunday.
"The two losses are definitely still
fresh in our minds, but that only gives
us added incentive to compete and
work hard on the field," sophomore
midfielder Evan Morgan said.
"There is definitely a competitive
spirit amongst the players this week.
Everyone is ready to show that we
belong on-top of the Pac-10."
Emotions alone cannot carry a
team, however, especially on the
road where a boisterous away crowd
can take away that mental edge. In
stead, success for Stanford depends
on the adjustments made in only five
days.
Number one on the agenda
against Oregon State is to neutralize
the Beavers' explosive attack. They
have extremely quick and talented
forwards that should be vigilantly
watched for the entire 90 minutes.
The Cardinal discovered this last
week, when, despite playing rock
solid against the attack for most the
match, a few costly lapses made the
difference in the 3-1 loss.
Stanford also learned that junior
Robbie Findley and senior Ryan
Johnson — the forwards who get the
most praise in the media — are not
the only options for OSU. Speedy re
serve striker Bryan Jordan scored
two of his team's three goals last
weekend.
In order to tighten up the back
line, the team has worked extensive
ly in practice on defensive discipline

and on communication throughout
the fullbacks and among the defen
sive midfielders. Maintaining posses
sion has also been stressed as a way
to keep the forwards at bay.
Washington, on the other hand,
came out quickly against the Cardi
nal last weekend,overwhelmed them
early and then stacked its defense for
the 1-0 victory. The loss dropped
Stanford to a 0-4-1 head-to-head
record in the past five contests. On
Sunday, the Cardinal will attempt to
take a page out of the Huskies' book
by taking an early lead.
"I think we're not going to really

change too much [from last week
end] except hopefully we can come
out and jump on them early at their
place and return the favor by beating
them on their home fields," senior
midfielder Cooper McKee said.
The toughest task for the Cardi
nal appears to be matching up with a
midfield that is stacked with talented
upperclassmen including seniors
Leo Totev, Jeff Hoover and Mike
Chabala. Both Totev and Hoover tal
lied game-winning goals last week
end, while Hoover is second on the
team in points.
"We will probably mirror them in

the midfield. with four players," Mor
gan said. "We will have to battle hard
against their talented midfield and
win the majority of the one-versus
one duels."
On the offensive end, Stanford
has two distinct approaches that are
tailor-made to scoring against the
Beavers and the Huskies.
"This week in practice we really
focused on going wide and getting
the ball to our outside players to ex
ploit Oregon State on the flanks be
cause we feel like that's where we
can get our best opportunities,"
McKee said. "Against Washington,
we want to do kind of the opposite.
The play in the middle of the field is
what's going to be really important,
and we need to win the battles
there."
Stanford also needs to find the
back of the net against two great
goalies, including the Pac-10's player
of the week, Husky senior Chris Ey
lander. The Cardinal broke a four
game scoreless streak on Sunday
against Oregon State in the waning
minutes, and building on this mo
mentum is essential. It puts pressure
on the other team while alleviating
the burden of playing airtight de
fense.
Look for the Cardinal's current
scoring leader, Marcus Ryan to at
tack and get good looks. Ryan, who
has four goals, has struck the ball well
this year and had a few beautiful free
kicks, which the opposing keepers
have only barely been able to push
aside. Sophomore forward Scott
Bolkan and many others look to also
get in on the attack.
This weekend's road-trip resem
bles a take-home midterm — short
term preparation, essential execu
tion and a very important outcome
— and the fans of the team hope
they've learned the lessons of the
first half and are ready to pass.
"Every week I feel like practice is
just getting better and better,and this
was no exception," McKee said. "We
feel confident going into this week
end.
