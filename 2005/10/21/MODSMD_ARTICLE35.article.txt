Unorthodox Healing Methods

Patch Adams (1999)
Robin Williams plays a doctor
who uses love, comedy and co
pious amounts of noodles to

remedy his patients' afflic
tions. That's right. Patch

teaches us to laugh that can
cer into remission, to dance
that gangrene away and to

cartwheel that syphilis
into oblivion. Alas,
though Patch's heart

warming albeit tumul
tuous journey through
medical school strived
to be the feel good ter
minal illness of the
week, that warm and
fuzzy feeling eventually
feels like a protracted
case of the avian
flu...only less fun.

Dr. Giggles (1993)
While Dr. Adams rejects
scalpels and syringes to
cure. Dr. Giggles whole
heartedly supports the
use of scalpels...but not
in the traditional sense.
In this critic's darling, a
mass-murdering doctor
escapes from his mental
institution to seek re
venge on the town where
his father was caught
for...also being a mass
murdering doctor. So
this doctor's kitsch is
killing while — you
guessed it — giggling
and with, surprise, a sur
gical theme! This is deep,
existentialist stuff, people

Doctor movies that probably have nothing to do with doctors

Dr. Strangelove
(1964)
This would have been a great
pomo title, too. Although I'll
bet it already is one...with
many equally enthralling se
quels. In this satire of cold
war paranoia, the US and the
USSR get into a 'lil tussle in
the war room—and, of
course, nuclear war ensues.
Yeah, it has nothing to do
with doctors —but um, it's my
article. So 1 win. Invest a

couple hours in this movie, and you've ba
sically gotten everything you would've
learned by majoring in IR...twice.

Any movie with "Naughty Nurse" or
"Doctor fphallic euphemism]" in
the title (1970-every five minutes)
I don't want to encroach upon Roxy Sass' do
main or anything (I hear she's a hitch). but let's
face it: doctors offices are aphrodisiacs. Yes,
that sterile, controlled environment is just beg
ging to be defiled. Yet, even in light of this in
disputable reality, most movies nowadays like
focusing on issues like "curing things'' and
"medicine?" Where's the lovin"? Lucky for
you, gentle reader, just about any one of these
movies will fill that proverbial void—in more
ways than one. Granted, the process of filming
many of these movies has likely spread more
disease than it has cured.

Hardcore Hippocratic Oath Violations

Flat liners (1991)
Iy bth-cabm • u r i : i .
isn't so.

Extreme Measures (1996)
Hugh Grant, going against type, plays an effemi
nate British guy who makes pronounced facial ex
pressions when anything happens. He's also a doc
tor. When one of his dead patients disappears, he
embarks upon a journey into the dark side of med
ical testing. Along the way he crosses paths with a
renowned medical researcher played by Gene
Hackman. Not to spoil the movie (although I to
tally am) but we soon discover that patients and
corpses are being hijacked in the name of medical
testing. Thus, this film poses the great question: is
it justified to force humans to become guinea pigs
in the name of producing a cure to save countless
others? We'll leave that answer to IHUM section
to decide.
