## A
						REMINDER TO NEVER CEASE 'SHOP' PING FOR LOVE 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION SHOPGIRL 
Let's just put it out there right
now, kids: Tam Vo is a sucker for a
good soundtrack. Screw the
swelling guitar lines, screw the
strains of a thousand wistful violins.
Forget the plinky planky twinkly
piano arpeggios that tug at our
hearts. Right now, I'm all about the
life-affirming rock ballad and the
comfort of familiar chord progres
sions. "Shopgirl" taps into the ever
amazing Deathcab for Cutie, with
"The Sound of Settling" teased in
the preview trailers. Add the song
"Consequence" by the Notwist,
among other stellar tracks, and
even you will be able to overlook
the film's weaknesses (including a
recurring piano-heavy theme that
grates on the nerves).
Now that we've got that little bit
out of the way, I've got to hand it to
Steve Martin. Rather than feel lim
ited by his immense contributions
to comedy the way Wes Craven
feels stuck in an infinite loop of hor

ror, the man goes out and writes a rather se
rious (and downright depressing, at times)
novel about relationships and the psychol
ogy of the individuals in them. It's so in
tensely personal that it can become univer
sal, and the film should not be written off
for its convenient tagline, "Relationships
don't always fit like a glove."
Mirabelle Buttersfield (Gaire Danes) is
a disenchanted girl trying to make it in Los
Angeles' art world while working the ac
cessories counter at Saks Fifth Avenue.
She's not your typical condescending, im
ported beer-drinking, chain-smoking hip
ster who has no faith in people or free will.

She just happens to
hail from the Mid
west and has a shit
load of student loans
to pay off. It's anoth
er routine day when
Jeremy Kraft (Jason
Schwartzman) shuf
fles into her life.

ingly painful date to Universal Citywalk
where Jeremy's inability to understand
women and the rules of dating cause him to
fumble over and over again. Schwartzman
is so convincingly awkward on screen I was
sure he'd be more charismatic in real life.
That is, until 1 met him last week at the San

Francisco press conference.
Danes fell off the face of the planet for
several years ("Mod Squad," anyone?),
but she has clearly kept up her acting
chops. She brings a shining depth and re
silience to the role that could appear naive
and fragile if played by anyone else. Her
Mirabelle is someone we can identify with,
in her need to find a counterpart who in
spires her, a soulmate who has faith in her
beyond reason. It's all in the timing of the
line, and Danes certainly prevents
Mirabelle from being a flat character
whom we don't care about.
One random day while working at Saks,

Mirabelle meets Ray
Porter (Martin), the
suave older gentleman
who's been around the
block and knows what
he's doing. Goodbye
fumbling hands Jere
my, hello wealthy di
vorcee Ray.
This
is when the movie gets
predictable. Ray and

Mirabelle become fuckbuddies, only she
thinks the relationship has potential for
more because he wines and dines her and
buys her pretty things. Ray is such a con
trast to Jeremy that Mirabelle begins to
think Ray is capable of winning her heart.
She can't help but fall for what she inter

prets as very thoughtful, romantic gestures.
Ray, on the other hand, tells his shrink that
Mirabelle understands there is no relation
ship and that he's made it clear it's purely
sexual.
"Shopgirl" focuses too heavily on
scenes between Mirabelle and Ray, and
while we understand that Jeremy is off
being a roadie for a band (and improving
himself through relationship books on
tape), his transformation could use more
explanation.
What is astounding about "Shopgirl" is
the way Martin helps make the words leap
onto the silver screen with his vision. He
just does it, even if it doesn't always quite
work. Martin's dedication to the craft of
comedy is more apparent with his deft por
trayal of Ray in this film because it requires
him not to make jokes that lessen the
human drama. This is where Martin vio
lates all of my expectations —no gag
jokes, no pratfalls, no "Cheaper By the
Dozen" cheap laughs. You just wish he
could've done it better, because "Shopgirl"
becomes overwrought in the most poten
tially tender of places.
The narration of plot is a bit much, but
if you look at it as storytelling rather than
just Steve Martin voiceovers, it can work.y
The characters aren't always as com-l
pelling, but then you invest yourself inl
