### ASHLEE HODGE TAM VO INTERMISSION JORDAN CATALANO LOVERS 
Honestly, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from my very
first press interview being with two reputable Teen Idols (Claire
Danes & Jason Schwartzman), but much to my surprise, 1 was
by no means the only reporter virgin present. Unfortunately,
the other non-experienced college press kids proved to have lit
tle to no natural talent in this department, and after the first
handful of questions I was seriously concerned that Jason was
going to fall into a coma and I'd have no choice but to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Luckily, I had the all-powerful
Tam Vo (my BFF) by my side, always ready with the most In
termission-esque (and by that I mean "who the fuck asks that?")
questions for the lovely couple. And by lovely, we mean Claire
Danes.

"Monster Garage". We call it, "Monster of Arabia."
