### ASHLEE HODGE TAM VO INTERMISSION JORDAN CATALANO LOVERS 
Honestly, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from my very
first press interview being with two reputable Teen Idols (Claire
Danes & Jason Schwartzman), but much to my surprise, 1 was
by no means the only reporter virgin present. Unfortunately,
the other non-experienced college press kids proved to have lit
tle to no natural talent in this department, and after the first
handful of questions I was seriously concerned that Jason was
going to fall into a coma and I'd have no choice but to give him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Luckily, I had the all-powerful
Tam Vo (my BFF) by my side, always ready with the most In
termission-esque (and by that I mean "who the fuck asks that?")
questions for the lovely couple. And by lovely, we mean Claire
Danes.


The new look for the fall
"Monster Garage". We call it, "Monster of Arabia."
Schwartzman was there, too, but let's face it, he's not as pretty.

Q: In the novella, Martin says
that men fall in love with
women like Mirabelle because
they want a certain specific
part of them. What do you
think it is that Jeremy wanted
in Mirabelle?
CLAIRE DANES: It wasn't
my tits.
JASON SCHWARTZMAN:
I don't know if I have a totally
thought out answer for that.
Maybe he recognizes in her
like, someone else who wants
to connect and to be loved. I
think one of the good things
about Jeremy is that he
doesn't over-think things, so
maybe he doesn't even know
why; it's just like a gut reac
tion, like when a chicken sees
its mom... but a chicken's
like...a girl he wants to get
with.
INTERMISSION: How do
you both individually like to be
held and how do you like to
hold someone?
SCHWARTZMAN: Hoooly
shit. How do you like to be
held?
INT: Well, how do you like to
hold a woman?
DANES: Well let's be honest:
it's always better to be
spooned than to spoon, right?

SCHWARTZMAN: You mean guys wanna be spooned?
DANES: I think we both do! Right? It's nicer.
SCHWARTZMAN: Right. Okay.
DANES: You can contradict me.
SCHWARTZMAN: No no, I'm not contradicting you. I'm listening. I'm taking notes
DANES: Spooning's good.

SCHWARTZMAN: Don't ask me the first thing
about girls and spooning and everything, 'cause
I don't know shit.
INT: How would you feel most close to some

one?
SCHWARTZMAN: A good hug.
DANES: He is a great hugger.
SCHWARTZMAN: 1 love hugs.
INT: We're both drummers, so if you
could drum for any three bands dead
or alive, who would you drum for?
SCHWARTZMAN: Umm, The
Who, Elvis Costello and the Attrac
tions, and uhh.. The Zombies. Try
that one.
DANES: He drummed for Ben
Lee.
SCHWARTZMAN: That's right,
I did.


Oh God not you again...
