# Charlize Theron overcomes insurmountable odds... again.

If you like stories where women overcome the
oppressive forces of patriarchal tradition and sex
ism, "North Country" may just be the movie for you.
Following in the tradition of director Niki Caro's
previous film, "Whale Rider," "North Country" fol
lows the trials and tribulations of a woman who leads
a movement towards a new age, moving beyond the
antiquated expectations of the stolidly conservative
father figure. While "Whale Rider" smartly tied it
self to a coming-of-age narrative as a means of en
suring emotional resonance, "North Country" can
not decide on a single narrative to follow, and in the
process loses its emotional potential.
"North Country" centers on the struggles of
Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron), a single mother of
two who is looking to start a new life after leaving
her abusive husband. She moves into her parents'
house (Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins) and re
discovers an old friend, Glory (Frances McDor
mand) who works at the local mine along with
Josey's father. Glory convinces her friend that the
mine is a good place to work: it pays six times as
much as what Josey earns currently, and would
allow to her to settle into a comfortable life with her
children. Glory alludes to the need to be tough in the
mine, but what Josey faces requires more than just a
tough skin.
Josey's male co-workers believe that women of
any age or disposition should not be their colleagues.

They abuse the women in every way: physi
cally, verbally and often sexually. Josey finds
herself especially vulnerable to sexual ha
rassment because her boss, Bobby Sharp
(Jeremy Renner) happens to be her former

A

high school flame who still fancies Josey. Under the
guise of newfound respect for Josey, Bobby tells her
to go up to the top of a stalled conveyor and see if
anything is stuck. Of course, this is simply a con
trivance to get Josey where Bobby wants her: a place
where no one can hear her scream and there's
nowhere to go; the perfect place for a sexual con
quest.
Eventually, Josey decides she's had enough and
joins forces with Bill White (Woody Harrelson), a
former high school hockey star and currently a semi
retired lawyer to sue the mine for sexual harass
ment. Unsurprisingly, this faces opposition from

everyone: Glory, her
fellow co-workers
and especially her fa
ther, Hank, who
never approved of
her decision to join
the mine as a worker
in the first place.
This setup is
not unlike that of
Caro's previous film
"Whale Rider." In that
movie, the heroine's
desire to partake in tra
ditionally masculine
activities meets with
disapproval from her
father figure. But while
the relationship be
tween the heroine and
her grandfather leads
to tension and emo
tional resonance in
"Whale Rider," the re
lationship between
Josey and Hank feels



"Hello, my name is Charlize Theron and I am an alcoholic."
systematic and mechanical, a Holly
wood creation intended to make the
audience erupt with joy when Hank
finally does come to side with his
daughter in what should be an emo
tional turning point. Both Josey
Aimes and the heroine of "Whale
Rider" give a speech to an audience,
and both their father figures have an
opportunity to support them.
In "Whale Rider," the father fig
ure does not show-up to support his
granddaughter, contrary to popular
expectation, but in "North Country,"
not only does Hank come to Josey's
aid as he is expected to, he speaks in
support of his daughter's sexual ha
rassment lawsuit in front of all his co
workers at the mine. This plays into
our expectations and notions of
movie relationships so well that it
fails to create genuine emotional
waves.
The performances are uniformly
good, although the Minnesota ac
cents can be a bit spotty at times. The
visuals are often breathtaking, with
deeply saturated colors, and often ac
centuated blues on human skin. The
music does what it can to match the
emotional mood of the film as it plays
out.
Yet, for all its polish and technical
perfection, "North Country" never
affects the audience in the same way
that led other films in the righteous
martyr subgenre, such as "Norma
Rae" and "Philadelphia," to great
success. It's hard to decide which plot
lines are important and which ones
aren't when coming up with a film
summary. Part of the problem is that
characters that once seemed to be of
great importance drop from the pic
ture for scenes at a time.
More than anything, though,
"North Country" is a good film-pred
icated on a solid story about an im
portant subject. But it cannot tran
scend its importance or message be
cause it only seems to exist as a didac
tic object. "Learn from me," it
screams from every frame. Personal
ly, I'd rather feel for it than learn from
it.
