# Casablanca freakin' rocks
## 
### INTERMISSIONFEDORA WEARER 
"Casablanca' is playing at Stanford
Flicks this Sunday night. If you
don't find "North Country" appeal
ing, consider revisiting one of Holly
wood's mostiloved movies.
Just before the final scene in
"Casablanca" was filmed, nobody
knew how it would end. Would
Rick and Ilsa get on the plane to
gether? Or would Rick sacrifice
true love fori a higher cause and let
Ilsa board the plane with Victor?
I ndeed I ngrid Bergman performed
nearly all ofjher scenes not know-*
ing with which man her character
was in love During filming, direc
tor Michael: Curtiz would simply
tell Bergman to "play it in-be
tween."
Released in L942, "Casablanca"
won Oscars for Best Picture, Best
Director and Best Screenplay.
After a scries of successful re-re
leases and television presentations,
"Casablanca" became ooeof
America's most-loved movies.
When the American Film institute
released their list of 4 America's 100
Greatest Movies' in 1998,
"Casablanca" was ranked number
two (behind "Citizen Kane"). M
Last week. I was lucky enough to
revisit "Casablanca" with a friend

who had never seen it. About one hour
into the movie she very proudly an
nounced how the movie would end. How
ever, as the film's finale approached, un
certainty crept in. an uncertainty that re
mained until the film's closing minutes.
This is the magic of "Casablanca." This is
why it is so cherished. It's the filmmaking
— filmmaking so rich and so detailed that
we completely understand the characters
and the dilemmas they face. We under
stand what is at stake. We understand the
consequences of their actions. And we can
accept their decisions, even though we're
unsure what they'll be.
Bogart's and Bergmans' performances
are central to this effect. But the two leads
are aided, in no small part, by an Oscar
winning screenplay that contains some of
Hollywood's most memorable moments:
"Here's looking at you, kid," "Louis, I
think this is the beginning of a beautiful
friendship," "We'll always have Paris."
"Casablanca" was produced at the
height of the Hollywood Studio Era (1930

- 1949). During tins time, the American
film industry was controlled by five major
studios. Production of movies resembled a
'factory line," with each studio producing
40-60 films a year. To provide flexibility
when making production decisions, ac
tors, screenwriters and directors were
kept under long-term contracts.
"Casablanca" exemplifies the best fea
tures of the Studio System. It was written
by three contracted screenwriters: Julius J.
Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard
Koch. And it re-teamed Bogart with direc
tor Curtiz. The two had worked together
on three previous films, "Kid Galahad.'
"Angels with Dirty Faces" and "Virginia
City." Successful collaborations like these
were often repeated during the Studio Era.
Sixty-three years after its initial release,
"Casablanca" is still as enthralling as ever.
Because its characters and resolution arc
so beautifully realized, the film seems in
capable of becoming dated. I therefore
can't recommend a better Sunday night
out at the movies.


If Casablanca were made in today's world:
"Here's looking at you...bitch."
