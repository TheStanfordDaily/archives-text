## Intermission plays with your pantyline...WHAT? 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ INTERMISSION DIRTY DANCER 
My task: To find the best song to get someone
to bed? Yes, that's right — so that those wonder
ful condoms Vaden so generously gives us can be
put to good use. Now, 1 don't know about you,
but I've never needed the help of a song, so I fig
ured that this would be an easv task.

I started out by asking some of my guy friends
(take note that these guys are the ultimate play
ers) what songs they would use on a lady friend.
The guys laughed and asked me what 1 was up to.
I had to tell them if I wanted their cooperation, so
I did.
The boys were eager to be my guinea pigs, but

sadly I could not use them because they knew the
object of the experiment and therefore it would
not be fair. However, with their reaction alone,
which totally proves how little it takes to get a guy
into bed, I wondered if the song would be the de

ciding factor.
Therefore, I decided that my three
participants would be guys who had
not necessarily shown any interest

in me, but whom 1 had classes with
and therefore could invite over to
"study."

I invited my first victim,
ahem subject, over. In order
to make this a fair experi
ment, I did not wear any

thing overly revealing,
turn on my scented can-,
dies or break out the mas
sage oil. As we began to

study, I stood up and said,
"1 think we need a study
break, how about some
music?"
Without giving him a
chance to respond, I
turned on Marvin Gaye's
"Let's Get it On," then I
sat back down and waited
for the magic. Nothing.

This kid was intent on studying, and proceeded to
quiz me on the effect of technology on communi
cation, claiming that we hadn't studied long
enough and therefore did not deserve a study
break.

All I could think was: "Come on! This song is
a classic. You see it in all these movies, and every
body is always getting it on. What is going on?"
I then thought: "Perhaps the mood isn't
right," so I surreptitiously proceeded to unbutton
one of the buttons on mv shirt and with mv sex

iest voice said, "I think we have studied long
enough," and moved in a little closer. Once
again, this kid would not be fazed; instead
he looked up and said "You're a bad

study partner." Then he walked
out!
My first experiment was a dis
mal failure. In retrospect, I

concluded that maybe Mar
vin Gaye is a bit outdated,
and besides — this is Stan
ford: people actually do

study here.
For my next

song, I chose Usher's "U
Got it Bad." This time, 1
told victim #2 to come

over at about lOish. We
walked into my room
where I had "accidental
ly" left my candles on. We
began to chat, and this
one seemed a bit more

promising than my last victim, so I got up and
turned on the song.
To my surprise, the guy stared at me and
bluntly said: "Are you trying to seduce me
with Usher?!" I barely had a chance to say a

tiny: "Maybe...," before he started laughing. He
then said, "You're cute and all, but... Usher?!"
then he walked out.
Obviously Usher just did not cut it for this guy.
I was almost done with my experiment and no
closer to finding the perfect song. Finally, 1 opted
to change my musical genre, and I settled on
Howie Day's "Collide."
For my final victim, I did what I had done the
second time, and began chatting with him. This
one seemed pretty promising as well, so I crossed
my fingers and turned on the song. To my horror,
I realized that 1 had clicked on "Get Low" by Lil'
John. I hastily tried to change the song, but to my
surprise the guy got up and said: "So 1 heard,
you're a good dancer, mind showing me a few of
your moves?" then he started dancing with me.
Just like that, I had a winner.


Marvin Gaye can't even rouse us from our stud
ies, much less to more aroused pursuits...


...and Usher's ice is just a reminder that
"U Got It Bad" won't get you hot.


Li'l John just got to the rubber glove part of his physi
cal. YEEAH!
