# Thrice showcases a new and softer sound, finds religion

### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION THRICER 
They are not
screamo. They are not
emo. They are not
metal and they arc far
too complicated to be
just plain rock. South

Thrice is hard to pin
down with any one
genre, and their
unique blend has only
become more diverse
with their latest re
lease. "Vheissu."
'Vheissu" is Thrice's
fourth album and first

with producer Steve Osbourne. They arc
asually grouped in the same category as
Thursday and My (Tiemical Romance, but
they aren't as Pop-y or widely known.
Thrice lias skirted popularity for years,
playing its own unique blend of

hardrock/pseudo metal/melodic screamo
thai few can compare to, let alone explain.

That said,
this is a major
departure from
Thrice's previ
ous albums, as it
plays with softer
sounds and sup
plies space be
tween the
screaming vo
cals and impres
sive guitars.
They know they
can make a song
with high treble,
intricate guitars,
beautiful

basslines and earnest, well-crafted lyrics.
They seem to want to focus more on
the lyrics this go around, and while they
demonstrate they still possess the instru
mental gifts that made their previous ef
forts so appealing, they also want to try

something new. There are songs that the
hardcore Thrice fan will find reminiscent of
"The Artist in the Ambulance" and"The
Illusion of Safety ," however some harder
fans may be disappointed with the depar
ture from the band's previous consistency.
Typical of Thrice, the lyrics espouse
generalities about self-affirmation,
strength and healing. There are moments
when the album seems to take a political
turn and sound like a call to arms, such as
the single and first track "Image of the In
visible." However, the religious imagery
and metaphors are indicative of t he spiritu
al theme that runs throughout the album.
"For Miles" tells the listener to "shed blood
for your friends," while "like Moths to
Flame" talks of "bread and wine" and
speaks about the fear of turning from God.
Although previous albums spoke explicit
ly of gothic themes, such as death, blood
etc., "Vheissu" seems focused more on the
idea of "sin. "
The vocals are being pushed in new
ways as well. "Earth Will Shake" and "At

lantic" don't sound like anything Thrice
has ever done — for better or for worse.
The vocals on "Earth Will Shake" sound
similar to Nickelback s, which is far from a

compliment
Even this
seems to fit in
the end, how
ever, as it
evolves into an
(almost)
campy chain
gang song that
descends into

hardcore. In contrast, "Atlantic" seems to
be partly influenced by Coldplay, the key
boards and slow lyrics are a new addition
and more subtle than their previous works.
"Music Box" experiments with a music
box melody in the background and juxta
poses it with Thrice s guitar riffe and haunt
ing vocals.
like all Thrice albums, the album
grows on you. Unlike all Thrice albums,

each song is unique and crafted with a dif
ferent purpose in mind. Inhere was an un
interrupted amount of energy throughout
the previous albums, with calm moments

only serving to better en
hance the outbursts of
metal-influenced guitar
or emo-like screaming.
This album is different in
that there are several
songs that don't break
into their cnergetic. guitar
slamming hardcore mo
ments. The album is
more reflective, and while

some songs have the screams, they only re
serve these tools for key moments. Each
song has a different feel to it. which may or
may not sit well with the listener.
The earth won't exactly shake with the
ground being broken in this album, and
this won't shoot Thrice to the top of any
body's list, but it may convert some fans
and it could create a deeper bond with oth
ers.


This is not the actual band. But it
does involve the number three. And
chesthair...yum.
