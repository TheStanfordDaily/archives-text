# Condoms are the Coolest... (cause you use them for sex)

INTERMISSION RUBBER
1 think as Stanford students, we
often overestimate our sexual
prowess. Where else can you find a
school-sponsored orgy that is consid
ered "normal" or a heaJth center that
suggests mono or pregnancy as the
root of every illness? And what do
they expect us to do with the piles of
free condoms and lube they toss out
at Vaden's SHPRC?
With 12 condoms given out to
each of us every quarter, we can plan
on having sex at least once a week,
every week of the year, including
Dead Week and finals. Well that's
awfully ambitious of us. Sure, we put
on a good show of being horny
teenagers and sketchy grad students
at-Full Moon on the Quad this past
Monday, but how much ass are we re
ally expecting to get? After all, it's not
like the Stanford campus is a notori
ous hotspot for play.
But despite the fact that the stu
dent body may not live up to its sexu
al expectations, the University still
urges us on with options, options, op
tions! You can pretty much fulfill
your every whim with the configura
tion of latex and lube at Vaden.
There's LifeStyles, Rough Rider,
Durex and Kimono. Non-lubricated,
lubricated, dual pleasure, ribbed and
studded. You've even got your fe
male condom to shake things up and
a non-latex alternative to keep op
tions open.»
The flavored ones sound some
what disgusting — Cola and Mint?
But if you don't mind having an aro
matic bright green dong for 20 min
utes, you're good. Besides, as one
anonymous tester said, "It's what a
flavored condom should be" Op
tions. options galore. Being in Vaden
is like being a kid in a candy store. Or
at least a nympho.
In the end, how<*vor,,the variety is
desirable but not crucial. No one
needs a Kimono Microthin or some
Passionfruit lube (which turned out
rather tasty) specifically to get it on.
The studded Rough Rider just seems
downright superfluous. As Jessica
Stanley, the girl behind this year's
Full Moon, put it simply: "they
work."
