Not long ago, while battling a terrible Ikmt of wellness, I scheduled an appMitment with Stanford University's Vaden Health '
Center to determine exact y what ailed me bid how I might solve the problem.
Luckily for me, Vadet had a number of appointments open for the next dafamd I chose the one that suited a practical gentle
man, like myself, best. Th secretary was stkkind as temjfer the name of the physician I would meet withtlicJoUowuig day. Her ge
niality eventually led tomnessage in my electronic mail bo x, but Ido not Ixgrudge her for it

The day of my appointment, I rose with thx sun and n uide hiy way to the load cafe for a spot of tea with my wife before my
presence was required at Vaden. The tea wm rather unsatisfactory in taste, and even more so in cost, I should say. Regard
less, a morning stroll to a coffee house isirften just wluit the doctor would order.

My wife and I walked to Vadi'n Health Center, a rather new-looking building filled with technology and lacking in
people to assist me. In fact, the prockdutfm Vaden is imch tlu u / checked in via a computing machine. Fancy that, re
ally. A few minutes after I confirmed somtt personal information, a nurse called my name and told me to follow her
to the West Clinic, where the examination rooms are.

Once in the proper chamber, thynurse took my blood pressure and informed me that I luid a fine reading for
my age. She took down my symptom and fold nie thatjli.e (factor would be in shortly, at which time the nurse de

parted. PIP*
The doctor, arather young man I should say, shook my hand and decided to ask
IP me the same questions about mylailment as the nurse had, and he poked around
; •( my body astb ascertain what illness kept me hostage. After listening to the sound
f A of my lutmhtd checkirigjhe okpf of my throat, the doctor decided that I was.

at the vcrytmost, a iittle worn out, and he promptly gave me a sheet offering
suggestions for battling the common colds that plague man in the cool- 112

er months. At this point I left the examination room, and
found my way back to my wife and out of Vaden Health
Center. „ . •

It was quite a satisfactory visit I must say, although I
wish t were less well, to be terribly honest.

Sincerely,
Lord Tteteti

Hirsch and Meiinda Liu,

too many reruns on the Bravo channel; they
compare "high-stakes diplomacy" to "Celebrity Poker Showdown."
Best Quotes: Chavez, talking about how much more the Cuban government
cares about its people and poultry in hurricane crises: "In Cuba... chickens, hens
and people are all evacuated." Um. aren't chickens and hens the same thing?
In the diplomatic-negotiation-as-pokcr-with-TV-grade-celebs article, Hirsch
and Liu write, "China, once a timid and indecisive giant — the Baby Huey of na
