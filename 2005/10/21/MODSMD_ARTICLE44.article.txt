If the answer is YES, give yourself a
J pat on the back, because you're
one of thfc hundreds of
froshies who've got the ran- ujvV

While students
from Branner claim r <•"' *
that "half [their]
entire hall is sick," \
PHE's are handing
out copious sup
plies of Day and
Ny-Quil across
Wilbur and Stern.

Even though some
freshmen, like Natalie Knut
( sen, assert that the raging
plagufe among freshmen is due
to "aitj abnormal amount of
strenuous activity," Knutsen
also notes disappointedly:
"Sadly. I'm not one of the unfor
tunate ones who caught it from

Widespread make-out sessfims have

freshman, like Lyniese

they're being "punished for

her "unprotected rela- i;

Mmm...be careful kids. Make sure
you get your $12 worth at the SHPRC
this quarter ASAP. And let's hope you
restricted your Full Moon on the Quad
sessions to the funkless. Or, if you have
the funk, maybe you relished the op
portunity to spread your sniffly misery
around '09 and '06. Or maybe '07 and
'08. Or to just everyone.
Either way, make sure you take your
vitarmu C. And be wary of KA, ladies -
— apparently those pirates are extra
smooth and off da hook.
