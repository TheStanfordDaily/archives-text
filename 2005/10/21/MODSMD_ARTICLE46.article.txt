## With fish unitards, what's not to love about the ballet? 
### EMILY HITE INTERMISSION BARYSHNIKOV 
Oakland Ballet returned to the Calvin Sim
mons Theatre last weekend to offer a diverse
repertory program in honor of its 40th anniver
sary. After closing for the 2004-2005 season due
to a financial crisis, the Friday performance
showcased a revitalized company with a strong
and vibrant group of dancers. Artistic Director
Karen Brown, who spoke graciously before a
sold-out house, thanked the many people com
mitted to sustaining the company and was joined
by a stage full of alumni dancers to celebrate the
opening.
The bill aligned with the company's reputa
tion for variety: three historically important but
seldom-reconstructed ballets from the 1920s and
'30s, a work by Oakland Ballet alumnus and for
mer Assistant Artistic Director Michael Lowe
and a world premiere by Donald McKayle.
The first two pieces were segments of ballets
created by Bronislava Nijinska for Serge Di
aghilev's sensational Ballets Russes: both ex
cerpts, as well as Eugene's Loring's 1938 com
plete work "Billy the Kid," were staged carefully
and rehearsed meticulously.
In "Billy," a series of repeated gestures con
veyed the laborious daily activities of post-Civil
War westward expansion: roping cattle, riding
horses, shooting a gun at whatever lay ahead and
the like. The rigidly determined frontier charac
ters moved with disciplined exactitude achieved
through full company effort and conscientious
direction.
The corps de ballet of women in the first scene of

"Les Noces" (The Wedding) moved in haunting
ly perfect unison, their stick-straight legs driving
into the ground at the tips of their feet with ur

gency and obedience rather
than the lightness and delicacy
typical of classical ballet. Igor

Stravinsky's lamenting score de
picts the ancient Russian

peasant ritual as a
tragic and unavoid

able tradi
tion rather
than a happy

union of
lovers. The
opening, "Bene

diction of the
Bride," offered a
compelling

glimpse into what
was to come.

After a short pause,

two scenes from "Les Biches"

(The House Party) followed on a
lighter note. The music by Francis
Poulenc and the set and costume de
sign by Marie Laurencin situated the
piece in a 1920s parlor. In the "Rag
Mazurka," liana Goldman per
formed the role of the self-involved
but charming hostess, dancing
alone in her living room and awk
wardly clutching a long-handled cig
arette in one hand and an unruly
string of pearls in the other. Two im-

pressive young men (Preston Dugger 111 and
Gabriel Williams);entered in profile, flexing
their biceps, strutting their masculinity and danc

ing with technical virtuosity. All
three characters were comically
torn between courting the oppo

site sex and
enjoying
their own
loveliness.

"Andatino" in
cluded a pas de
deux that was

strangely for
mal and ro
mant i c ,
danced by

Matthew Linzer and
the beautiful and capable

Yuka Omori.
Next on the program was the
delight of the evening: Lowe's
"Double Happiness." with live
music by Chinese music ensemble
Melody of China. The program
note. "Fish Costumes Courtesy of
Moving Arts Dance," was a
promising start to a fun-spirited
and uplifting ballet. Lowe incorpo
rated clever and understated part
nering twists and flips without inter
rupting his flowing choreography.

The Splashing Fish pas de deux (the
costumes turned out to be iridescent

unitards) finished with female fish Cyn-

thia Sheppard being tossed out of the wings into
her partner Linzer's arms..
"Passage" was the most engaging section.
Led by Phaedra Jarrett and Dugger, Jarrett
seemed to possess capabilities of movement only
seen in animated films as she ran with quick and
numerous steps, picking up speed and gradually
taking flight with the assistance of her partner.
Jarrett and Dugger danced with a quality that
was both calm and powerful, and took hold of the
stage space and the audience's focus with their
pure and honest artistry.
McKayle's "Ella" concluded the evening with
the best of intentions. The Marcus Shelby Jazz
Orchestra and vocalist Ledisi gave Ella Fitzger
ald's legendary music its due, but the choreogra
phy did not match the quality of the music. For
the second section, "Scatting," McKayle at
tempted to mirror Fitzgerald's vocal improvisa
tions in his choreography, but the three pair of
dancers looked constrained by specific move
ment and invisibly partitioned space. "One For
My Baby" was a nightclub-themed quartet that
involved too little dancing and far too much
mimed drinking.
"Ella" was well received with enthusiastic ap
plause, though, and perhaps McKayle intended a
low-key accompaniment to Fitzgerald's out
standing music. The company finished with the
interesting practice of announcing each compa
ny dancer's name during the final bows, and it re
ceived a standing ovation. It is clear that the Oak
land community takes pride in the city's longest
thriving arts organization, and opening night was
a hopeful new beginning.

In "Billy," a series of repeated gestures con
veyed the laborious daily activities of post-Civil
War westward expansion: roping cattle, riding
horses, shooting a gun at whatever lay ahead and
the like. The rigidly determined frontier charac
ters moved with disciplined exactitude achieved
through full company effort and conscientious
direction.
The corps de ballet of women in the first scene of

"Les Noces" (The Wedding) moved in haunting
ly perfect unison, their stick-straight legs driving
into the ground at the tips of their feet with ur

gency and obedience rather
than the lightness and delicacy
typical of classical ballet. Igor

Stravinsky's lamenting score de
picts the ancient Russian

peasant ritual as a
tragic and unavoid

able tradi
tion rather
than a happy

union of
lovers. The
opening, "Bene

diction of the
Bride," offered a
compelling

glimpse into what
was to come.

After a short pause,

two scenes from "Les Biches"

(The House Party) followed on a
lighter note. The music by Francis
Poulenc and the set and costume de
sign by Marie Laurencin situated the
piece in a 1920s parlor. In the "Rag
Mazurka," liana Goldman per
formed the role of the self-involved
but charming hostess, dancing
alone in her living room and awk
wardly clutching a long-handled cig
arette in one hand and an unruly
string of pearls in the other. Two im-

pressive young men (Preston Dugger 111 and
Gabriel Williams);entered in profile, flexing
their biceps, strutting their masculinity and danc

ing with technical virtuosity. All
three characters were comically
torn between courting the oppo

site sex and
enjoying
their own
loveliness.

"Andatino" in
cluded a pas de
deux that was

strangely for
mal and ro
mant i c ,
danced by

Matthew Linzer and
the beautiful and capable

Yuka Omori.
Next on the program was the
delight of the evening: Lowe's
"Double Happiness." with live
music by Chinese music ensemble
Melody of China. The program
note. "Fish Costumes Courtesy of
Moving Arts Dance," was a
promising start to a fun-spirited
and uplifting ballet. Lowe incorpo
rated clever and understated part
nering twists and flips without inter
rupting his flowing choreography.

The Splashing Fish pas de deux (the
costumes turned out to be iridescent

unitards) finished with female fish Cyn-

thia Sheppard being tossed out of the wings into
her partner Linzer's arms..
"Passage" was the most engaging section.
Led by Phaedra Jarrett and Dugger, Jarrett
seemed to possess capabilities of movement only
seen in animated films as she ran with quick and
numerous steps, picking up speed and gradually
taking flight with the assistance of her partner.
Jarrett and Dugger danced with a quality that
was both calm and powerful, and took hold of the
stage space and the audience's focus with their
pure and honest artistry.
McKayle's "Ella" concluded the evening with
the best of intentions. The Marcus Shelby Jazz
Orchestra and vocalist Ledisi gave Ella Fitzger
ald's legendary music its due, but the choreogra
phy did not match the quality of the music. For
the second section, "Scatting," McKayle at
tempted to mirror Fitzgerald's vocal improvisa
tions in his choreography, but the three pair of
dancers looked constrained by specific move
ment and invisibly partitioned space. "One For
My Baby" was a nightclub-themed quartet that
involved too little dancing and far too much
mimed drinking.
"Ella" was well received with enthusiastic ap
plause, though, and perhaps McKayle intended a
low-key accompaniment to Fitzgerald's out
standing music. The company finished with the
interesting practice of announcing each compa
ny dancer's name during the final bows, and it re
ceived a standing ovation. It is clear that the Oak
land community takes pride in the city's longest
thriving arts organization, and opening night was
a hopeful new beginning.

Oakland Ballet returned to the Calvin Sim
mons Theatre last weekend to offer a diverse
repertory program in honor of its 40th anniver
sary. After closing for the 2004-2005 season due
to a financial crisis, the Friday performance
showcased a revitalized company with a strong
and vibrant group of dancers. Artistic Director
Karen Brown, who spoke graciously before a
sold-out house, thanked the many people com
mitted to sustaining the company and was joined
by a stage full of alumni dancers to celebrate the
opening.
The bill aligned with the company's reputa
tion for variety: three historically important but
seldom-reconstructed ballets from the 1920s and
'30s, a work by Oakland Ballet alumnus and for
mer Assistant Artistic Director Michael Lowe
and a world premiere by Donald McKayle.
The first two pieces were segments of ballets
created by Bronislava Nijinska for Serge Di
aghilev's sensational Ballets Russes: both ex
cerpts, as well as Eugene's Loring's 1938 com
plete work "Billy the Kid," were staged carefully
and rehearsed meticulously.
