# Nintendo's 'Fire Emblem': so hot right now
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION NINTENDO-PHILE 
Gamecube gamers looking for a
great strategy title finally have rea
son to rejoice. While other titles in
the genre try to boggle the gamer
with a near infinite myriad game
play options and choices, "Fire Em
blem: Path of Radiance" is a breath
of fresh air for the turn-based tacti
cal line of titles. "Fire Emblem" fea
tures balanced gameplay, an in
triguing (if not slightly
story and several difficulty levels
that will invite newbies to try the
game while keeping experienced
players challenged.
For the gaming illiterate, turn
based strategy (TBS) games place
an emphasis on advance planning
and tactics, rather than reflex and
quick micro-management. Battles
are played on a grid and usually
have the player and computer take
turns moving their war units, with

characters attacking one another
when in range. "Fire Emblem"
makes no effort to deviate from this
formula, as the meat of the game
play has the player advancing their
characters across a battlefield ac
complishing a variety of missions in
order to win and advance to the
next battle. Players control fantasy
units that include swordsmen, heal
ers. wizards and beastmen that can
transform into animals at will.
One of the features that differen
tiates "Fire Emblem" from other
strategy titles is the concept of true
death on the battlefield. Unlike
other games that usually allow the
player to revive their allies if they
perish during a fight, if your charac
ter dies here, they are gone for
good. Granted, you're allowed to
recruit more characters throughout
the game, but for some gamers that
can't accept failure, expect to reload
the game many times whenever a
character that vou become attached

to kicks the bucket because of a tac
tical mistake.
Battles in "Fire Emblem" are
deceptively simple. Every unit (and
the weapons they wield) employ a
rock-paper-scissors approach to
combat results. This simplicity al
lows players to easily plan their
turns without paying attention to
needless statistics that plague other
titles. The gameplay mechanics may
seem too easy for experienced play
ers, but I think it strives a good bal
ance for both newbies and veterans
alike.
Perhaps the best part of "F ire
Emblem" is it's engrossing story.
The tale is pretty standard role
playing game fare for gaming (com
ing-of-age-story-with-emo-boy-
that-loses-family), but it's present
ed well through nicely rendered cut
scenes between battles and some
beautiful anime-styled movie clips.
Characters are fleshed out with the
usual high quality translation that

Nintendo is known for.
The only downside to "Fire Em
blem" is the mediocre graphics sys
tem. Granted, most games in the
genre still use archaic sprite-based
graphics that are a big turn-off to
the current generation of gamers,
but even this show of polygons
doesn't do the 'cube justice. Also,
while I personally enjoyed the
music in the game, it does get repet
itive at times, especially during bat
tles.
Regardless. "Fire Emblem"
shines where it counts. Good, bal
anced, turn-based strategy com
bined with a good story and the abil
ity to choose from several difficulty
levels makes this a great game for
aspiring tacticians as well as a good
title for experienced gamers to sink
their teeth into. One of the best
games to come out in a while for the
Gamecube; everyone with an ounce
of strategery in their blood should
check it out.

itive at times, especially during bat
tles.
Regardless. "Fire Emblem"
shines where it counts. Good, bal
anced, turn-based strategy com
bined with a good story and the abil
ity to choose from several difficulty
levels makes this a great game for
aspiring tacticians as well as a good
title for experienced gamers to sink
their teeth into. One of the best
games to come out in a while for the
Gamecube; everyone with an ounce
of strategery in their blood should
check it out.
