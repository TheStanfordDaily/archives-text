### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION. M. D 
So you went to Full Moon on Monday night, and your roommate wouldn't let you
leave without sucking face with at least 25 guys. Not too much different from your average Friday t
night on the Row, right? Not so much. Factor in that each of those guys probably kissed ten girls before you. j
and each of those girls kissed a couple of guys (or girls) before that. Come to think of it, you will probably be com- 112

If in the end Dr. Roxy's health routine doesn't work lor you. and you still find yourself too sick to even engage in th<\ Jfjt
finer activities Stanford has to offer, now might be a good time to cozy up to your PHE, as Roxy recommended X jr/.si
last week. After all, if you don't hit that now, someone else will, and if there is anything to be learned from !
your Full Moon escapades, it's that the road to the sick line at Vaden is paved with sloppy seconds. _ | * ' j
