# Cardinal go for three in a row against ASU
## Sun Devils provide a serious test for the Stanford defense 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford (3-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
looks to avenge last season's heartbreaking 31-
34 defeat and claim its first home win of the sea
son when a dangerous Arizona State squad (3-
3,1-2) visits the Farm at 2 p.m. tomorrow for the
homecoming game.
Despite its unspectacular record, Arizona
State enters the contest favored by neaily 10
points, and many analysts consider the Sun
Devils the strongest three-loss team in the
country. Arizona State's three losses came to
BCS No. 13 Oregon, No. 6 LSU and No. 1 USC
— squads with a combined record of 16-2. Fur
ther, two of those losses came down to the wire,
as LSU needed a last-second touchdown to es
cape with a 35-31 victory, and the Sun Devils led
USC 21-3 at the half before committing four
second-half turnovers.
Stanford head coach Walt Harris believes
the speed and overall talent of the Sun Devils
make them competitive with the top teams in
the country.
"Arizona State is a very talented football
team — very explosive," Harris said. "They
have some really good football players. We real
ly like the quarterback [Sam Keller]...he's got a
really good arm, and he's big and strong."
Because of an injured thumb, however,
Keller's status for the contest is questionable.
Trainers haven't let the junior grip a football
since the Oregon loss two weeks ago, but the
team is guardedly optimistic about Keller's
health for Saturday.
"The swelling is definitely down, and the
pain has subsided." Arizona State head coach
Dirk Koetter said at a Tempe press conference
earlier this week. "If its up to Sam. he's going to

Stanford returns home

play.The doctors have to make a de
cision on the severity of it, and we'll
have to see what they say."
At press time it appeared as
though Keller would make the start
barring a setback in the last days of
practice. If he doesn't start, the quar
terback duties will be turned over to
redshirt freshman Rudy Carpenter.
Talented athletes, led bv senior re
ceiver Derek Hagan and sophomore
tight end Zach Miller.surround who
ever does start at quarterback. After
tying the school record with his 25th
career touchdown reception in the
Oregon contest, Hagan could set a
new Sun Devil mark against the
Card
"Obviously, Hagan is an out
standing receiver and (one of the
best] in the history of the Pac-10,"
Harris said. "Coach Koetter knows a
lot about how to throw the ball, and
they've got weapons."
Even if the Cardinal can shut down
the passing game, Arizona State's rush
ing attack also looks capable of inflict
ing heavy damage. Last year, sopho
more running back Rudy Burgess
rumbled for a career-high 186 yards
against the Cardinal.and though fresh
man Keegan Herring is now the Sun
Devils' primary ball carrier, Stanford's
base 3-4 defense has not changed since
that defensive debacle.
"The zone running game was in
spired to attack a 3-4 defense, and

we're a zone running team," Koetter
said. "You can draw your own con
clusions."
Meanwhile, Harris hopes tomor
row is the day his squad excels in all
three aspects of the game — offense,
defense and special teams.
We just have to play well," said
Harris, who is 66-70 all-time as a head
coach. "One of these days, all three
phases will play lights out. So far, that
hasn't happened. We just have to be
more consistent and keep fighting."
Perhaps in response to poor of
fensive performances earlier in the
season, Harris has recently shied
away from calling riskier downfield
passes, instead relying on junior
quarterback Trent Edwards' running
ability to move the chains. In the past
two contests, Stanford has averaged
only 22 points per game, but Ed
wards has run for 124 yards, and the
team committed no turnovers en
route to two narrow victories.
"After they lost to UC-Davis and
to Oregon they have played conserv
atively on offense," Koetter said.
"They're using what they have, and
they're putting the ball in the quar
terback's hands. The changes are not
easy to see on tape but they're keep
ing themselves in games and not
beating themselves."
In last year's contest in Tempe,
aided by two touchdowns off of then
sophomore linebacker Udeme Ud

ofia's punt blocks, Stanford and
then-redshirt freshman No. 2 quar
terback T.C. Ostrander climbed out
of a 26-14 hole to take a 31-26 lead
with 2:02 to play. I lowever. the Car
dinal defense could not preserve the
victory, as the Sun Devils marched
the length of the field in the final two
minutes, and Miller caught a touch
down with nine seconds left to cap
Arizona State's 34-31 victory.
"We definitely haven't forgotten
about the game last year down at
Arizona State," said junior strong
safety Brandon Harrison, who has
posted an interception in each of the
last two games. "It was a situation
where we felt the offense and special
teams played well enough for us to
win. In the end, on defense, we just
couldn't hold them on their drive at
the end of the game. For me person
ally, it's definitely a game that has
stuck in my mind, because it's one
that I felt we gave away at the end."
This year, revenge and a first
home victory of the season fuel the
Cardinal.
"This is our home and our house,"
said senior linebacker Jon Alston,
who forced two 112 umbles and claimed
three sacks and nine total tackles in
last week's 20-16 victory at Arizona.
"We need to protect it and defend it.
We need to play even better than
how we have played on the road and
be really excited to play here."
