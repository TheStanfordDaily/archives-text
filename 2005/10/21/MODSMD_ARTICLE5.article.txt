## Sun Devils provide a serious test for the Stanford defense 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford (3-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
looks to avenge last season's heartbreaking 31-
34 defeat and claim its first home win of the sea

team — very explosive," Harris said. "They

Trainers haven't let the junior grip a football
since the Oregon loss two weeks ago, but the
team is guardedly optimistic about Keller's
health for Saturday.
"The swelling is definitely down, and the
pain has subsided." Arizona State head coach
Dirk Koetter said at a Tempe press conference
earlier this week. "If its up to Sam. he's going to
