## Wilma batters Haiti and Jamaica 
### WILL WEISSERT 
CANCUN,Mexico (AP) â€” Tourists packcd Cancun's
airport desperately seeking flights out and guests at luxu
ry hotels shuttled to emergency shelters, trying to escape
Hurricane Wilma as its outer bands battered the resort's
white-sand beaches. Cuba evacuated more than 200,000
people ahead of the Category 4 storm.
Wilma, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph,
churned toward the Yucatan peninsula and south Florida
after hitting Haiti and Jamaica, where it killed at least 13
people. The storm was expected to strike Cancun and its
surrounding resorts and sideswipe Cuba early Friday.
Forecasters said Wilma then would make a beeline for
Florida, where Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emer
gency, and make landfall Sunday.
"At least for the next couple of days here, we think
we're going to have a very powerful hurricane here in the
Caribbean," said Max Mayfield, director of the National
Hurricane Center in Miami.
Briefly the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record,
Wilma was a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm
before weakening. Its 145 mph winds made it roughly as
powerful as Hurricane Katrina when it plowed into the
Gulf coast of the United States on Aug. 29, killing more
than 1,200 people.
The hurricane center said the storm's wobbly center
was roughly 190 miles southeast of Cancun, Mexico's
top tourist attraction. At 2 p.m. EDT, Wilma was cen
tered 160 miles southeast of Mexico's Cozumel Island,
and moving northwest at near 5 mph.The forecast track
would carry it directly to the city of some 500,000 people
by late Friday.
"This is getting very powerful, very threatening," Mex
ican President Vicente Fox said.
Hundreds of schools in the Yucatan peninsula were or
dered closed Thursday and Friday, and many were turned
into shelters. Airlines started canceling flights.
At the Cancun airport, hundreds of tourists waited for
flights or sought rental cars, taxis or ATMs.
Matt Williams and Jeff Davidson of Westfield, N.J.,
were going back to their hotel in Playa del Carmen south
of Cancun after their flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. was
canceled. At the hotel, they faced a night in a ballroom
turned-emergency shelter.
"You see the lines. I don't want to stand there for two
hours and then decide what to do," said Williams, 26.
