# President Bush says he is hampered by criticism
## 
### JENNIFER LOVEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Bush, jarred by investigations
of White House officials and con
gressional leaders and an uproar
over his Supreme Court nomina
tion, said Thursday there was "some
background noise here, a lot of
chatter" complicating the work of
his administration.
But he said, "The American peo
ple expect me to do my job, and I'm
going to."
Bush's comments, at a Rose
Garden news conference with
Palestinian leader Mahmoud
Abbas, reflected the administra
tion's argument that its agenda is
moving forward despite a growing
list of problems.
The president promised to re
main focused on seeking peace in
the Mideast, invigorating the econ
omy, rebuilding the hurricane-shat
tered Gulf Coast and protecting it
from the new storm approaching
this weekend. At the same time, he
said, "There's some background
noise here, a lot of chatter, a lot of
speculation and opining."
White House officials are quiet
ly anxious about the outcome of
events over which they have little
control. It's an uncomfortable po
sition for an administration that
likes to steer the agenda and has a
reputation for protecting its se
crets. Now, administration officials
are asking reporters what they're
hearing.
The most immediate problem is
the investigation by Special Prose
cutor Patrick Fitzgerald to deter
mine whether there was a concerted
administration effort to illegally di
vulge Valerie Plame's CIA identity
because her husband publicly ques

tioned Bush on the Iraq war. The
central figures in the investigation
are White House deputy chief of
staff Karl Rove and I. Lewis "Scoot
er" Libby, chief of staff to Vice Pres
ident Dick Cheney. Both Rove and
Libby talked to reporters before
Plame was unmasked.
"We don't know what all the
facts are," said White House press
secretary Scott McClellan. "All of
us would like to know what they are
and get to the bottom of this."
While Bush asserted that his
agenda was moving ahead, his most
ambitious domestic proposals on
Social Security and taxes already
have been shelved. GOP congres
sional leaders huddled with the
president this week on a legislative
agenda that had been pared to only
the must-do items of the federal
budget, Katrina recovery, Patriot
Act renewal and the Harriet Miers
nomination.
The conclusion of Fitzgerald's
two-year investigation, expected
within days, bears down on the
White House amid other troubles.
Bush's pick of Miers, the White
House counsel, for the Supreme
Court disappointed many of his
longtime conservative allies and
puzzled some Republicans in Con
gress. Also, the White House is still
reeling from criticism of its slow re
action to the misery caused by Hur
ricane Katrina in New Orleans.
Further complicating Bush's
plans are investigations of former
House Majority Leader Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, on conspiracy and
money-laundering charges in Texas,
and Senate Majority Leader Bill
Frist for stock transactions.
Weary of the CIA investigation
and the uncertainty it has brought,
presidential aides say they just wish
it would end.
