## Halloween party postponed until next year 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Mausoleum Party Planning Committee announced
yesterday that the highly anticipated resurrection of the fa
mous Halloween party has been postponed for yet another
year.
The Mausoleum party, a Stanford tradition for more
than 20 years, was discontinued three years ago due to a lack
of funding by the Stanford Alumni Association (SAA),
which previously financed the event. Following the 2001
party, the SAA decided to refocus its resources to better
meet its core mission and objectives, cutting funding for the
bash in the process.
This year, though, the ASSU and Absolute Fun planned
to foot the bill for the party, and expectations were high that
2005 would indeed mark the renaissance of the Halloween
tradition.
In a press release issued yesterday,however, the commit
tee announced that its decision to postpone the event until
Oct. 2006 came after "significant discussion among student
leaders and administrators who have been involved in the
planning process."
In addition, the press release stated that "the decision to
postpone the event arose from a number of complex factors
including but not limited to date conflicts and various plan
ning hurdles."
At press time, members of the planning committee still
declined to elaborate on the decision to cancel this year's
party, but the press release concluded with a promise for the
future.
"Much has been achieved toward reestablishing the tra
ditional Halloween celebration, and the ASSU will work
with Stanford leaders to develop a process that solidifies the
place of the Mausoleum Party for years to come," it stated.
Though very few current undergraduates have ever at

tended the Mausoleum party — only current fifth-year sen
iors would have been enrolled at Stanford in Oct. 2001,
when the event was last held — some students said they
were disappointed that this year's party was canceled.
Freshman Stephanie Beck expressed frustration at the
party's rescheduling.
"I don't really know very much about the history behind
the Mausoleum party" she said."But from what I've heard
about the event it sounds like it would have been a good
night. It's unfortunate they had to cancel the party, and I
hope they stay true to their word to throw it next Hal
loween."
Sophomore Andrew Buchan said he was upset more by

the short notice of the cancellation.
"To be honest, I wasn't planning on attending the Mau
soleum Party," he said. "But there's been a buzz going
around campus about resurrecting such a great Stanford
tradition. Now they cancel the party barely a week before
it's supposed to happen; that was pretty disappointing."
Senior Matt Brest voiced a somewhat different opinion.
"I've never been to the Mausoleum party because it's
never happened while I've been here." he said. "So frankly,
I don't really care that it's not happening this year; igno
rance is bliss."
The Mausoleum Planning Committee has tentatively set
the date for next year's party as Friday. Oct. 27,2006.
