# Red Flags: Nature's Way of Saying 'Run Like Hell'
## 
### 
Time in prison. Identical twins. An in
ability to recall my name after we
start making out.
These are a few of my "red flags" — the
things 1 watch out for when I'm mingling
with someone in a non-platonic context.The
presence of one or more red flags indicates
a possibly fatal incompatibility and certain
ly the need to reevaluate the merits of the
interaction. And of course, it's all based on
(an often traumatizing) experience.
The thing about identical twins, for ex
ample. It's not like 1 have anything against
twins, per se. I mean, everyone knows that
they're freaks of nature with mutant genet
ic information, but that doesn't mean I sup
port banning them from our fine university.
Don't ask, don't tell, that's my policy.
But I've dated three guys who had identi
cal twins and it has always ended badly The
first guy was the biggest chauvinist I have
ever met. The second one turned out to be
homophobic. And the third one...well, let's

just say that 1 may have dated both James and
his brother without realizing exactly what
was going on.
It's difficult to say what precisely consti
tutes a red flag because the criteria are differ
ent for everyone. If I have one bad encounter
with a musician, does that mean I should
swear them off completely? Ttoo? Seven?
Granted, by this logic I should probably stop
dating literate men with all of their teeth be
cause of the statistical likelihood that they will
piss me off. And guys who are kind to animals
and small children are DEFINITELY out of

the question.
I think the rule of thumb here is to differ
entiate between those trends that are rela
tively insignificant and those trends that in
dicate that your partner has a personality ill
suited to interact with your own. For exam
ple, one of my friends decided that she need
ed to stop dating Creationists, not because
she had problems with their dogma but be
cause she realized that those leanings point
ed to a value set that was mismatched with
her free-spirited, relativist brand of morali
ty. She was attracted to their willingness to
defend an unpopular viewpoint, but the in
compatibility was such that the relationship
would be doomed from the start.
Asking your peers to disclose their red
flags is a rather enlightening exercise. There
are the typical red flag candidates like racist
comments or physical abuse that demon
strate a fundamental lack of respect for hu
manity. but then there are less obvious ones
like "girls who only have guy friends and not

a single legitimate girl friend."
Why?
"Because I have found that these indi
viduals are usually bitches and other girls
have picked up on that."
Another person I talked to refused to
date someone who still had pictures of an ex
in his or her room, even if he or she claimed
they were "just friends." For him, still-dis
played pictures of exes demonstrated an in
ability to leave the past behind and move
into a new relationship relatively free of
baggage from the last one. I forgot to ask
this person if burning the clothes of a past
boyfriend made you particularly attractive
in this sense, especially if the clothes were
still on the boy.
One of the best things about dating is the op
portunity to solidify the requirements your
"ideal candidate" must possess. But many peo
ple forget that it is just as important to decide
which qualities you do not want in a mate as it
is to figure out what you want your dream part

ner to look likc/be like/smell like. That way,
you'll know it's the real deal when Dreamy
comes along, because Dreamy will not only be
attractive and brilliant, but will also be a
staunch evolutionist and lack a criminal
record. Conversely, when Pseudo-Dreamy
comes along you'll know to run in the opposite
direction.
On a related note, people are attracted to
confidence, and I can't think of anything hotter
than a guy who knows what he wants — except
maybe a guy who knows what he doesn't want.
Although I didn't really know what to think
when it came to the following interaction:
"Do you have any red flags when it
comes to dating a girl?" I asked a resident of
my house.
"A penis," he replied.
Enough said.

twins, per se. I mean, everyone knows that
they're freaks of nature with mutant genet
ic information, but that doesn't mean I sup
port banning them from our fine university.
Don't ask, don't tell, that's my policy.
But I've dated three guys who had identi
cal twins and it has always ended badly The
first guy was the biggest chauvinist I have
ever met. The second one turned out to be
homophobic. And the third one...well, let's

just say that 1 may have dated both James and
his brother without realizing exactly what
was going on.
It's difficult to say what precisely consti
tutes a red flag because the criteria are differ
ent for everyone. If I have one bad encounter
with a musician, does that mean I should
swear them off completely? Ttoo? Seven?
Granted, by this logic I should probably stop
dating literate men with all of their teeth be
cause of the statistical likelihood that they will
piss me off. And guys who are kind to animals
and small children are DEFINITELY out of

the question.
I think the rule of thumb here is to differ
entiate between those trends that are rela
tively insignificant and those trends that in
dicate that your partner has a personality ill
suited to interact with your own. For exam
ple, one of my friends decided that she need
ed to stop dating Creationists, not because
she had problems with their dogma but be
cause she realized that those leanings point
ed to a value set that was mismatched with
her free-spirited, relativist brand of morali
ty. She was attracted to their willingness to
defend an unpopular viewpoint, but the in
compatibility was such that the relationship
would be doomed from the start.
Asking your peers to disclose their red
flags is a rather enlightening exercise. There
are the typical red flag candidates like racist
comments or physical abuse that demon
strate a fundamental lack of respect for hu
manity. but then there are less obvious ones
like "girls who only have guy friends and not

a single legitimate girl friend."
Why?
"Because I have found that these indi
viduals are usually bitches and other girls
have picked up on that."
Another person I talked to refused to
date someone who still had pictures of an ex
in his or her room, even if he or she claimed
they were "just friends." For him, still-dis
played pictures of exes demonstrated an in
ability to leave the past behind and move
into a new relationship relatively free of
baggage from the last one. I forgot to ask
this person if burning the clothes of a past
boyfriend made you particularly attractive
in this sense, especially if the clothes were
still on the boy.
One of the best things about dating is the op
portunity to solidify the requirements your
"ideal candidate" must possess. But many peo
ple forget that it is just as important to decide
which qualities you do not want in a mate as it
is to figure out what you want your dream part

ner to look likc/be like/smell like. That way,
you'll know it's the real deal when Dreamy
comes along, because Dreamy will not only be
attractive and brilliant, but will also be a
staunch evolutionist and lack a criminal
record. Conversely, when Pseudo-Dreamy
comes along you'll know to run in the opposite
direction.
On a related note, people are attracted to
confidence, and I can't think of anything hotter
than a guy who knows what he wants — except
maybe a guy who knows what he doesn't want.
Although I didn't really know what to think
when it came to the following interaction:
"Do you have any red flags when it
comes to dating a girl?" I asked a resident of
my house.
"A penis," he replied.
Enough said.

Time in prison. Identical twins. An in
ability to recall my name after we
start making out.
These are a few of my "red flags" — the
things 1 watch out for when I'm mingling
with someone in a non-platonic context.The
presence of one or more red flags indicates
a possibly fatal incompatibility and certain
ly the need to reevaluate the merits of the
interaction. And of course, it's all based on
(an often traumatizing) experience.
The thing about identical twins, for ex
ample. It's not like 1 have anything against
twins, per se. I mean, everyone knows that
they're freaks of nature with mutant genet
ic information, but that doesn't mean I sup
port banning them from our fine university.
