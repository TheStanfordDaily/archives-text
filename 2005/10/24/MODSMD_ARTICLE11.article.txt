## Editorial Dining can make more progress 
### 
Rafi Taherian's leadership of Stanford
Dining has been marked by an im
pressively rapid change in services
toward more logical and complete dining
plans. We cautiously applaud most of these
changes, and, more importantly, we think
Taherian should keep the momentum going
by spearheading further improvements.
This year saw a number of changes that
impact all undergraduate meal plans. The
number of meal plan options dropped from
about six to three, and the prices for all meal
plans standardized at $4,656 over the year.
In addition, the confusing point system dis
appeared, replaced exclusively with Cardi
nal Dollars. All dining halls have become all
you-can-eat and dining halls have been
given new themes, from Latin at Stern to
Southeast Asian at Manzanita.
There are some obvious problems. Lines
have lengthened in Wilbur and food quality
in both Wilbur and Manzanita has de
creased. But with benefits ranging from
more flexibility in dining with friends (two
more guest meals were also added) to sim
plified dining outside of dining halls, the
changes have been positive overall.
Last year's editorial board questioned
the standardization of meal plan prices, and
we reiterate its concern. By forcing students
to buy a meal plan at a certain price, Stan
ford Dining is using its monopoly power to
force all students into its eateries. Students
no longer have the flexibility of saving $400
on a smaller meal plan and using that money
for an occasional dinner out.
Still, our worry is not as strong as it was,
provided Stanford Dining continues im
proving its services as well as it has for the
past two years. Bringing more of Tresidder
under its auspices and simplifying Cardinal
Dollars were great steps forward.
The Treehouse and Jamba Juice are two
obvious new targets for improvement. Nei
ther one is included within the current Car

dinal Dollars plan (nor is the Thai Cafe.The
750 or many other on-campus contracted
food vendors). The explanation for this is
quite simple: These facilities are independ
ently owned and operated and lack many of
the overhead costs that Stanford Dining in
curs, from union employee benefits to emer
gency preparedness for campus.
Still, Stanford Dining should try to bring
these and other off-campus companies into
the mix with Cardinal Dollars. Fora negoti
ated discount that would cover at least some
of the dining overhead, some pizza delivery
companies or late-night Palo Alto business
es should be willing — as they are at other
campuses around the country — to partner
with the University for access to a broader
student market.
Additionally, now that all meal plans are
the same price, students should be able to
change plans much more easily, and they
should be able to do so through Axess in
stead of sending an e-mail or visiting a cer
tain office. The $25 fee for changing meal
plans is unnecessary. Students should be al
lowed to change plans at any time and
should receive prorated Cardinal Dollars or
be able to pay for the Cardinal Dollars they
used that are beyond their new meal plans.
If Stanford Dining is confident that its
changes are in the best interest of students, it
should be willing to re-evaluate most of the
new system before this academic year ends. It
already puts much effort into an extensive sur
vey each year. It should also publicize the out
comes of the survey in an honest way. If stu
dents evaluate the changes negatively, an open
dialogue about what improvements could be
made — given the acknowledged challenges
that Stanford Dining faces — would benefit
the whole campus. Obviously, not everyone
will be satisfied, but if students understand
why they are paying so much for their meal
plans and the hidden benefits they gain, they
will be much more willing to accept them.

There are some obvious problems. Lines
have lengthened in Wilbur and food quality
in both Wilbur and Manzanita has de
creased. But with benefits ranging from
more flexibility in dining with friends (two
more guest meals were also added) to sim
plified dining outside of dining halls, the
changes have been positive overall.
Last year's editorial board questioned
the standardization of meal plan prices, and
we reiterate its concern. By forcing students
to buy a meal plan at a certain price, Stan
ford Dining is using its monopoly power to
force all students into its eateries. Students
no longer have the flexibility of saving $400
on a smaller meal plan and using that money
for an occasional dinner out.
Still, our worry is not as strong as it was,
provided Stanford Dining continues im
proving its services as well as it has for the
past two years. Bringing more of Tresidder
under its auspices and simplifying Cardinal
Dollars were great steps forward.
The Treehouse and Jamba Juice are two
obvious new targets for improvement. Nei
ther one is included within the current Car

dinal Dollars plan (nor is the Thai Cafe.The
750 or many other on-campus contracted
food vendors). The explanation for this is
quite simple: These facilities are independ
ently owned and operated and lack many of
the overhead costs that Stanford Dining in
curs, from union employee benefits to emer
gency preparedness for campus.
Still, Stanford Dining should try to bring
these and other off-campus companies into
the mix with Cardinal Dollars. Fora negoti
ated discount that would cover at least some
of the dining overhead, some pizza delivery
companies or late-night Palo Alto business
es should be willing — as they are at other
campuses around the country — to partner
with the University for access to a broader
student market.
Additionally, now that all meal plans are
the same price, students should be able to
change plans much more easily, and they
should be able to do so through Axess in
stead of sending an e-mail or visiting a cer
tain office. The $25 fee for changing meal
plans is unnecessary. Students should be al
lowed to change plans at any time and
should receive prorated Cardinal Dollars or
be able to pay for the Cardinal Dollars they
used that are beyond their new meal plans.
If Stanford Dining is confident that its
changes are in the best interest of students, it
should be willing to re-evaluate most of the
new system before this academic year ends. It
already puts much effort into an extensive sur
vey each year. It should also publicize the out
comes of the survey in an honest way. If stu
dents evaluate the changes negatively, an open
dialogue about what improvements could be
made — given the acknowledged challenges
that Stanford Dining faces — would benefit
the whole campus. Obviously, not everyone
will be satisfied, but if students understand
why they are paying so much for their meal
plans and the hidden benefits they gain, they
will be much more willing to accept them.
