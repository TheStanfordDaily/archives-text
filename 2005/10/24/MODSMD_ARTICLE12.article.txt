# Somebody didn't read the Field Guide

As evidenced by the abuses at Abu
Ghraib, the United States did not
have a clear policy on torture — or,
at the very least, was allowing it to occur. It
was in many ways a public relations disaster
for the United States in the international
community.
Now John McCain, a Republican senator
from Arizona, has backed a piece of legisla
ture that would allocate $440 billion dollars
for this international incident that is the war
on Iraq. Some people may think that $440
billion is an awful lot to ask when we're re
covering from Katrina and are about to be
hit by another massive hurricane. President
George W. Bush has threatened to veto this
piece of legislature, but not because of the
price.
McCain added an amendment that
would establish uniform standards for the
interrogation of people whom U.S. troops
detain.This would prohibit "cruel, inhuman
or degrading" treatment and essentially
make U.S. personnel follow the U.S. Army
Field Manual for interrogation. For some
reason, this Field Manual has not been used
in the war on Iraq.
The Field Manual states: "...inhumane
treatment of any kind is prohibited by law
and is neither authorized nor condoned by
the U.S. Government. Experience indicates
that the use of force is not necessary to gain
the cooperation of sources for interroga
tion."
Bush believes that this amendment is
"restrictive." So this means that Abu
Ghraib was not a fluke — Bush has allowed
torture, will continue to support torture and
believes he knows better than McCain or
the Army Field Manual. He believes that
torture can produce more cooperation from
prisoners, is a reliable interrogation tool,
the Geneva Convention doesn't matter, etc.
This McCain guy, by the way, was a prisoner
of war in Vietnam and was tortured by his
captors while Bush served in the Texas Na
tional Guard without seeing action. And
somehow, I doubt Bush ever read the Field
Manual.
The Senate passed the spending measure
and the amendment 90-9. Republicans and
Democrats, two parties who can't even
agree on tie selection, overwhelmingly sup
ported this measure. But Bush threatened
to veto it. He was so frightened of it being
passed, it seems, that he sent Dick "Smiling
Guy" Cheney over to the Senate to try to

woo senators. Surprisingly, the vice presi
dent could not woo people with his magnet
ic personality, metallic arms or laser-guided
eyes.
Speaking of magnetic Republican per
sonalities, Tom DeLay has been arrested.
And Karl Rove is involved in something
shady. People have been wondering why
Bush used the word "restrictive" when he
discussed his opposition to the amendment.
I think I know the answer.
With Bush's approval rating at 39 per
cent, he is worried about our war efforts but
trying to think outside the box. I believe
that Bush thinks it's vital to the American
war effort that he have the option of using
"coercive force" when dealing with DeLay
and Rove. Follow me on this. It may seem
like Bush is implicitly allowing torture to
continue, has not taken a strong position
with DeLay, and has avoided Rove's issue
entirely. But, in actuality, he is leading by ex
ample. Fie is willing to torture his own Re
publican comrades so that we can better
fight the war on terrorism.
I'm just amazed he would be willing to
do this. He's telling the terrorists that he is
prepared to use brutal force against even
his own advisors, comrades and friends if
they are found guilty. He's willing to see
DeLay's smiling mugshot have gruel
thrown at it, or possibly force him to watch
films on ethics on repeat. Bush has the
stomach to order Rove's few remaining
hairs pulled out and will authorize, if neces
sary, that his chief advisor be ridiculed pub
licly in the same type of smear campaign
that he used against Bush's adversaries.
I'm not sure what information this will
gain us in the war on terrorism, but it will
show the terrorists that Bush means busi
ness and will "stay the course."
People say that we should set an example
of upholding standards of interrogation that
do not include torture, that these standards

Holt's Harangue
should have existed before and
should exist now. People say that
Bush is implicitly acknowledging
that U.S. troops torture their captives
and will continue to do so, and that
this makes us no better than our ene
mies. People say that it's a bit dis
heartening that this administration
gets two nominees to the highest
court in the land when two of its high
est members are being investigated
for criminal actions, the VP has a bad
mouth and over a thousand lives

were lost in order to discover that our
Federal Emergency Management
Agency director is a crony. This same
FEMA director, by the way. would
have been equally ineffective in han
dling a home terrorist attack, even
though this administration is sup
posed to be big on national security.
A 39 percent approval rating is
downright optimistic.

Chris supports McCain's amend
ment, does not think Republicans
should be tortured (not even Rove)
and apologizes if people found his
mocking of the topic of torture taste
less. Sometimes showing the absurdity
of a situation requires it. Send com

have a clear policy on torture — or,
at the very least, was allowing it to occur. It
was in many ways a public relations disaster
for the United States in the international
community.
Now John McCain, a Republican senator
from Arizona, has backed a piece of legisla
ture that would allocate $440 billion dollars
for this international incident that is the war
on Iraq. Some people may think that $440
billion is an awful lot to ask when we're re
covering from Katrina and are about to be
hit by another massive hurricane. President
George W. Bush has threatened to veto this
piece of legislature, but not because of the
price.
McCain added an amendment that
would establish uniform standards for the
interrogation of people whom U.S. troops
detain.This would prohibit "cruel, inhuman
or degrading" treatment and essentially
make U.S. personnel follow the U.S. Army
Field Manual for interrogation. For some
reason, this Field Manual has not been used
in the war on Iraq.
The Field Manual states: "...inhumane
treatment of any kind is prohibited by law
and is neither authorized nor condoned by
the U.S. Government. Experience indicates
that the use of force is not necessary to gain
the cooperation of sources for interroga
tion."
Bush believes that this amendment is
"restrictive." So this means that Abu
Ghraib was not a fluke — Bush has allowed
torture, will continue to support torture and
believes he knows better than McCain or
the Army Field Manual. He believes that
torture can produce more cooperation from
prisoners, is a reliable interrogation tool,
the Geneva Convention doesn't matter, etc.
This McCain guy, by the way, was a prisoner
of war in Vietnam and was tortured by his
captors while Bush served in the Texas Na
tional Guard without seeing action. And
somehow, I doubt Bush ever read the Field
Manual.
The Senate passed the spending measure
and the amendment 90-9. Republicans and
Democrats, two parties who can't even
agree on tie selection, overwhelmingly sup
ported this measure. But Bush threatened
to veto it. He was so frightened of it being
passed, it seems, that he sent Dick "Smiling
Guy" Cheney over to the Senate to try to

woo senators. Surprisingly, the vice presi
dent could not woo people with his magnet
ic personality, metallic arms or laser-guided
eyes.
Speaking of magnetic Republican per
sonalities, Tom DeLay has been arrested.
And Karl Rove is involved in something
shady. People have been wondering why
Bush used the word "restrictive" when he
discussed his opposition to the amendment.
I think I know the answer.
With Bush's approval rating at 39 per
cent, he is worried about our war efforts but
trying to think outside the box. I believe
that Bush thinks it's vital to the American
war effort that he have the option of using
"coercive force" when dealing with DeLay
and Rove. Follow me on this. It may seem
like Bush is implicitly allowing torture to
continue, has not taken a strong position
with DeLay, and has avoided Rove's issue
entirely. But, in actuality, he is leading by ex
ample. Fie is willing to torture his own Re
publican comrades so that we can better
fight the war on terrorism.
I'm just amazed he would be willing to
do this. He's telling the terrorists that he is
prepared to use brutal force against even
his own advisors, comrades and friends if
they are found guilty. He's willing to see
DeLay's smiling mugshot have gruel
thrown at it, or possibly force him to watch
films on ethics on repeat. Bush has the
stomach to order Rove's few remaining
hairs pulled out and will authorize, if neces
sary, that his chief advisor be ridiculed pub
licly in the same type of smear campaign
that he used against Bush's adversaries.
I'm not sure what information this will
gain us in the war on terrorism, but it will
show the terrorists that Bush means busi
ness and will "stay the course."
People say that we should set an example
of upholding standards of interrogation that
do not include torture, that these standards

Holt's Harangue
should have existed before and
should exist now. People say that
Bush is implicitly acknowledging
that U.S. troops torture their captives
and will continue to do so, and that
this makes us no better than our ene
mies. People say that it's a bit dis
heartening that this administration
gets two nominees to the highest
court in the land when two of its high
est members are being investigated
for criminal actions, the VP has a bad
mouth and over a thousand lives

were lost in order to discover that our
Federal Emergency Management
Agency director is a crony. This same
FEMA director, by the way. would
have been equally ineffective in han
dling a home terrorist attack, even
though this administration is sup
posed to be big on national security.
A 39 percent approval rating is
downright optimistic.

Chris supports McCain's amend
ment, does not think Republicans
should be tortured (not even Rove)
and apologizes if people found his
mocking of the topic of torture taste
less. Sometimes showing the absurdity
of a situation requires it. Send com
