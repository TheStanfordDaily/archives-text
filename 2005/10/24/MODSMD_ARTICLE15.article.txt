# Hot or not: The sociology of good looks
## 
### 
One question I've been mulling over
for the past couple of years is: How
much do looks matter? Do your
looks have a significant impact on the course
of your existence, even on your personality,
or would your life have been pretty much
unaltered if you had a very different
physique — either more or less attractive?
Much of my experience points strongly in
the direction of the former.
It all starts when we are little kids. It's
been proven that cuter kids get more atten
tion, both in school and in general. This
might make them more confident than less
attractive kids and might shape their person
ality for the rest of their lives.
The obsession with looks just gets worse
as we grow up. "Isshe cute? Is he hot?" are
probably the first questions we get when we
mention a member of the opposite sex, sug
gesting that looks are the first criterion peo
ple judge us on.
According to the sociological theory I

was introduced to in my interpersonal rela
tions class, we encounter far more people
than we can interact with in our daily lives.
As a result, we unconsciously eliminate less
attractive people from our pool of potential
acquaintances — even before we've had any
sort of contact with them. The tendency to
interact mostly with people of roughly-simi
lar attractiveness is most pronounced when
it comes to dating. Among couples, it is the
exception rather than the rule to find one
significantly more-attractive partner, bar
ring the old rich man / trophy wife scenario.

Well, what if your soul-mate is from a differ
ent looks caste than yours?
From a practical standpoint, there really
isn't much of an alternative. We do en
counter far more people than we can ever
get to know, and we have to decide quickly
(so quickly it's unconscious) whether or not
to interact with a person. We can't search the
depths of their souls, inquire about their po
litical and religious beliefs and then decide.
So. in that sense, looks have to matter.
A few more examples. In an experiment
that I find particularly interesting, a group of
guys were given pictures of women — some
attractive, some much less attractive. They
were told to call these women and talk to
them. But the twist in the experiment is that
the guys who were given a picture of an at
tractive woman were given the number of a
less-attractive woman and vice-versa. The
guys who thought they were calling attrac-
