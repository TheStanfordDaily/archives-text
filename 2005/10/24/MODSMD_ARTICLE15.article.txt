# Hot or not: The sociology of good looks
## 
### 
One question I've been mulling over
for the past couple of years is: How
much do looks matter? Do your
looks have a significant impact on the course
of your existence, even on your personality,
or would your life have been pretty much
unaltered if you had a very different
physique — either more or less attractive?
Much of my experience points strongly in
the direction of the former.
It all starts when we are little kids. It's
been proven that cuter kids get more atten
tion, both in school and in general. This
might make them more confident than less
attractive kids and might shape their person
ality for the rest of their lives.
The obsession with looks just gets worse
as we grow up. "Isshe cute? Is he hot?" are
probably the first questions we get when we
mention a member of the opposite sex, sug
gesting that looks are the first criterion peo
ple judge us on.
According to the sociological theory I

was introduced to in my interpersonal rela
tions class, we encounter far more people
than we can interact with in our daily lives.
As a result, we unconsciously eliminate less
attractive people from our pool of potential
acquaintances — even before we've had any
sort of contact with them. The tendency to
interact mostly with people of roughly-simi
lar attractiveness is most pronounced when
it comes to dating. Among couples, it is the
exception rather than the rule to find one
significantly more-attractive partner, bar
ring the old rich man / trophy wife scenario.

Well, what if your soul-mate is from a differ
ent looks caste than yours?
From a practical standpoint, there really
isn't much of an alternative. We do en
counter far more people than we can ever
get to know, and we have to decide quickly
(so quickly it's unconscious) whether or not
to interact with a person. We can't search the
depths of their souls, inquire about their po
litical and religious beliefs and then decide.
So. in that sense, looks have to matter.
A few more examples. In an experiment
that I find particularly interesting, a group of
guys were given pictures of women — some
attractive, some much less attractive. They
were told to call these women and talk to
them. But the twist in the experiment is that
the guys who were given a picture of an at
tractive woman were given the number of a
less-attractive woman and vice-versa. The
guys who thought they were calling attrac-

tive women were much more pleas
ant and flirtatious than those who
thought they were calling less-at
tractive women and, even scarier,
they treated the attractive women as
though they were more intelligent
than the "less attractive" women.
This suggests that when people don't
know you, they will treat you better
if you are attractive than if you
aren't.
In politics — where image is very
important — looks matter. For jobs,
looks matter. If there are two equal
ly-qualified candidates fora job
offer, looks will certainly play a role
in who gets the job (although gen
der, race and other factors might
also play a role). And here at Stan
ford, looks clearly matter. One of my
friends from my freshman dorm re
cently told me that he and several of
his male friends had spent an entire
evening ranking the girls in the dorm
according to looks.
So what do we do about this situ
ation? Do we just sit and cry because
we aren't top-model material? Do
we bemoan the injustice of this
world? There are two separate ideas
I would explore.
The first is simply that the injus
tice in the world is hardly limited to

looks. The family, country and socio
economic milieu in which you are
born are just as random as appear
ance, and will in all likelihood have a
far greater impact on your life. We
are never on equal footing — not
even at birth — and all we can do is
act within the constraints we were
born with and try to overcome them.
My second thought is that it
would be a good idea to de-empha
size the importance of looks, partic
ularly in the media (easier said than
done, obviously). If girls as young as
16 or 17 are getting breast implants
and nose jobs, it's because they think
that looks are everything and that
their lives will be better and happier
with bigger breasts or reshaped
noses.
Looks matter for sure, and we
can't do anything about it.That's an
advantage for some, less of an ad
vantage for others. But looks are not
everything. Charm, personality and
intelligence play a huge role in how
people react to us. The problem with
looks is that the more their impor
tance is emphasized, especially in
the media, the more people treat
them as the be-all-end-all criterion.
And 1 think we've gone too far with
that tendencv already.

If you \e also ranked the members of
the opposite sex in your dorm accord
ing to looks, you can tell Laure about it

ring the old rich man / trophy wife scenario.

Well, what if your soul-mate is from a differ
ent looks caste than yours?
From a practical standpoint, there really
isn't much of an alternative. We do en
counter far more people than we can ever
get to know, and we have to decide quickly
(so quickly it's unconscious) whether or not
to interact with a person. We can't search the
depths of their souls, inquire about their po
litical and religious beliefs and then decide.
So. in that sense, looks have to matter.
A few more examples. In an experiment
that I find particularly interesting, a group of
guys were given pictures of women — some
attractive, some much less attractive. They
were told to call these women and talk to
them. But the twist in the experiment is that
the guys who were given a picture of an at
tractive woman were given the number of a
less-attractive woman and vice-versa. The
guys who thought they were calling attrac-

tive women were much more pleas
ant and flirtatious than those who
thought they were calling less-at
tractive women and, even scarier,
they treated the attractive women as
though they were more intelligent
than the "less attractive" women.
This suggests that when people don't
know you, they will treat you better
if you are attractive than if you
aren't.
In politics — where image is very
important — looks matter. For jobs,
looks matter. If there are two equal
ly-qualified candidates fora job
offer, looks will certainly play a role
in who gets the job (although gen
der, race and other factors might
also play a role). And here at Stan
ford, looks clearly matter. One of my
friends from my freshman dorm re
cently told me that he and several of
his male friends had spent an entire
evening ranking the girls in the dorm
according to looks.
So what do we do about this situ
ation? Do we just sit and cry because
we aren't top-model material? Do
we bemoan the injustice of this
world? There are two separate ideas
I would explore.
The first is simply that the injus
tice in the world is hardly limited to

looks. The family, country and socio
economic milieu in which you are
born are just as random as appear
ance, and will in all likelihood have a
far greater impact on your life. We
are never on equal footing — not
even at birth — and all we can do is
act within the constraints we were
born with and try to overcome them.
My second thought is that it
would be a good idea to de-empha
size the importance of looks, partic
ularly in the media (easier said than
done, obviously). If girls as young as
16 or 17 are getting breast implants
and nose jobs, it's because they think
that looks are everything and that
their lives will be better and happier
with bigger breasts or reshaped
noses.
Looks matter for sure, and we
can't do anything about it.That's an
advantage for some, less of an ad
vantage for others. But looks are not
everything. Charm, personality and
intelligence play a huge role in how
people react to us. The problem with
looks is that the more their impor
tance is emphasized, especially in
the media, the more people treat
them as the be-all-end-all criterion.
And 1 think we've gone too far with
that tendencv already.

If you \e also ranked the members of
the opposite sex in your dorm accord
ing to looks, you can tell Laure about it
by sending an e-mail to lnegiar@stan

One question I've been mulling over
for the past couple of years is: How
much do looks matter? Do your
looks have a significant impact on the course
of your existence, even on your personality,
or would your life have been pretty much
unaltered if you had a very different
physique — either more or less attractive?
Much of my experience points strongly in
the direction of the former.
It all starts when we are little kids. It's
been proven that cuter kids get more atten
tion, both in school and in general. This
might make them more confident than less
attractive kids and might shape their person
ality for the rest of their lives.
The obsession with looks just gets worse
as we grow up. "Isshe cute? Is he hot?" are
probably the first questions we get when we
mention a member of the opposite sex, sug
gesting that looks are the first criterion peo
ple judge us on.
According to the sociological theory I

was introduced to in my interpersonal rela
tions class, we encounter far more people
than we can interact with in our daily lives.
As a result, we unconsciously eliminate less
attractive people from our pool of potential
acquaintances — even before we've had any
sort of contact with them. The tendency to
interact mostly with people of roughly-simi
lar attractiveness is most pronounced when
it comes to dating. Among couples, it is the
exception rather than the rule to find one
significantly more-attractive partner, bar
ring the old rich man / trophy wife scenario.
