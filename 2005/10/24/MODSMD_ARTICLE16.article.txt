## Israeli-Palestinian conflict moderates should unite 
### WILL DEMPSTER 
American college campuses are compli
cated political entities, with myriad issues
being debated and advocated by large num
bers of interest groups. Faced with so many
competing and worthy issues, it is perplexing
to consider precisely why the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict occupies so much activist time
and energy.
Because this issue is so inflammatory,
many students have horror stories to share
about campus extremists building mock
walls and checkpoints or blacklisting contro
versial professors. Similar to the situation in
the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict on campus is dominated by a small but
vocal group of extremists on each side. Just
as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be
transformed in the Middle East, so must it
too on college campuses in the United
States.
As the battleground for the American
Jewish and Palestinian diasporas shifts to
college campuses, America's college stu
dents are all too often treated as pawns in a
broader communal power struggle. As a re
sult. seemingly minor incidents at universi
ties often erupt into community-wide strug
gles. At Columbia University, a showdown
over allegedly biased faculty members trans
formed into a national controversy. At the

University of Michigan. Rutgers University
and Duke University, radical Palestinian stu
dent conferences and the Jewish community
response disrupted campus life for weeks.
Coupled with this disturbing trend is the
rancor displayed toward moderate students
who seek to facilitate a more civil campus
discourse. Moderates are often targets of
scorn and racist epithets from their peers,
causing many to withdraw from the campus
debate entirely. The combination of these
factors results in an uneasy tension on cam
puses that threaten to ignite over even the
smallest difference in opinion.
Young people living the conflict in Israel
and Palestine are tired of retreating to the
Intifada's stagnant status quo. They grow
weary of excuses — weary of continually
dwelling on past hardships at the expense of
collaborating toward building a better fu
ture for each of their peoples. Because the
conflict remains safely in the media for most
Americans, we are capable of comfortably
tolerating intellectual extremism here —
while the consequences of those policies re
sult in needless death over there. Americans
remain content to reduce Israelis and Pales
tinians to their most extreme elements. As a
result, the silent majority of Israelis and
Palestinians who simply desire an opportu
nity to pursue their dreams absent violence
remain marginalized and disempowered.

Fortunately, a new movement named
One Voice has emerged seeking to amplify
these voices in an effort to end over a centu
ry of conflict. The One Voice movement is
not merely the collaboration of discredited
elements of traditional peace constituencies.
A nonpartisan movement. One Voice joins
nationalistic Israelis from Likud and nation
alistic Palestinians from Fatah. It joins for
mer Israeli soldiers and Palestinian refugees.
It joins a diverse set of Israeli politicians with
an equally diverse set of Palestinian politi
cians. Instead of simply repeating tired clich
es, One Voice unites ordinary Israelis and
Palestinians against their respective militant
extremists who provide excuses for inaction.
One Voice has nurtured an impressive
cadre of youth activists in Israel and Pales
tine who work daily to spread a message of
anti-extremism and nonviolence. Last
rhursday, two of them visited Stanford in an
effort to prove Israelis and Palestinians are
more than just militant settlers and terror
ists.
There is hope to solve this Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict. Instead of more excuses, let us
in America embrace those moderates who
desire a better, nonviolent future. In taming
the forces of extremism on college campus
es, we will force our larger communities to
focus their energies on solving the
conflict, rather than perpetuating it
for partisan political purposes. As
Theodor Herzl said,"lf you will it, it
is no dream."

as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be
transformed in the Middle East, so must it
too on college campuses in the United
States.
As the battleground for the American
Jewish and Palestinian diasporas shifts to
college campuses, America's college stu
dents are all too often treated as pawns in a
broader communal power struggle. As a re
sult. seemingly minor incidents at universi
ties often erupt into community-wide strug
gles. At Columbia University, a showdown
over allegedly biased faculty members trans
formed into a national controversy. At the

University of Michigan. Rutgers University
and Duke University, radical Palestinian stu
dent conferences and the Jewish community
response disrupted campus life for weeks.
Coupled with this disturbing trend is the
rancor displayed toward moderate students
who seek to facilitate a more civil campus
discourse. Moderates are often targets of
scorn and racist epithets from their peers,
causing many to withdraw from the campus
debate entirely. The combination of these
factors results in an uneasy tension on cam
puses that threaten to ignite over even the
smallest difference in opinion.
Young people living the conflict in Israel
and Palestine are tired of retreating to the
Intifada's stagnant status quo. They grow
weary of excuses — weary of continually
dwelling on past hardships at the expense of
collaborating toward building a better fu
ture for each of their peoples. Because the
conflict remains safely in the media for most
Americans, we are capable of comfortably
tolerating intellectual extremism here —
while the consequences of those policies re
sult in needless death over there. Americans
remain content to reduce Israelis and Pales
tinians to their most extreme elements. As a
result, the silent majority of Israelis and
Palestinians who simply desire an opportu
nity to pursue their dreams absent violence
remain marginalized and disempowered.

Fortunately, a new movement named
One Voice has emerged seeking to amplify
these voices in an effort to end over a centu
ry of conflict. The One Voice movement is
not merely the collaboration of discredited
elements of traditional peace constituencies.
A nonpartisan movement. One Voice joins
nationalistic Israelis from Likud and nation
alistic Palestinians from Fatah. It joins for
mer Israeli soldiers and Palestinian refugees.
It joins a diverse set of Israeli politicians with
an equally diverse set of Palestinian politi
cians. Instead of simply repeating tired clich
es, One Voice unites ordinary Israelis and
Palestinians against their respective militant
extremists who provide excuses for inaction.
One Voice has nurtured an impressive
cadre of youth activists in Israel and Pales
tine who work daily to spread a message of
anti-extremism and nonviolence. Last
rhursday, two of them visited Stanford in an
effort to prove Israelis and Palestinians are
more than just militant settlers and terror
ists.
There is hope to solve this Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict. Instead of more excuses, let us
in America embrace those moderates who
desire a better, nonviolent future. In taming
the forces of extremism on college campus
es, we will force our larger communities to
focus their energies on solving the
conflict, rather than perpetuating it
for partisan political purposes. As
Theodor Herzl said,"lf you will it, it
is no dream."
