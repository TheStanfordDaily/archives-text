# STUDENT LIFE
## Students fast for earthquake victims Yesterday's Fast-a-thon fundraiser celebrated Ramadan 
### ALLISON DEDRICK 
Imagine taking midterms and writing papers on an
empty stomach. For the approximately 400 Muslim
students at Stanford who are participating in Ra
madan, the month of fasting, abstaining from food
and water during the day becomes routine. For every
one else, last night's Fast-a-thon was a chance to try
fasting and learn more about the Muslim faith while
earning money for the victims of the earthquake that
rocked Pakistan on Oct. 8.
Over 100 students came together at Tresidder
Union last night to break fast in the third annual Fast
a-thon, organized by the Muslim Student Awareness
Network (MSAN) and the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University (ISSU). During the Fast-a-thon, ap
proximately 140 members of the Stanford communi
ty fasted from dawn until dusk.
Local businesses donated $4 for each person who
fasted. Organizers teamed with the Pakistanis at
Stanford (PAS) and expected the event to raise be
tween $750 and $ 1,000, which will add to the already
$13,000 raised campuswide for the earthquake vic
tims.
Electrical engineering doctoral student Mehdi Ja
vanmard, president of the ISSU, said that this year's
Fast-a-thon was similar to the past two. stressing that
the two main purposes of the event are to promote
awareness of Ramadan and the Muslim faith and to
raise money fora charitable cause.
"Hopefully by fasting fora day, people will get a
better sense of what Ramadan is," Javanmard said.
"Also by fasting you're going through hunger, so peo
ple will be empathizing with the quake victims in Pak

istan and getting a better idea of what those people
are going through."
About half of the participants were Muslim and
fasting as part of the holy month of Ramadan, but
many students participated to help the earthquake
victims or to learn more about Islam. The students
broke their fast with a meal catered by Stanford Din
ing and listened to speakers talk about their experi
ences with Ramadan and the earthquake, including a
representative from PAS who stressed the impor
tance of donating.
Senior Eva Chen said that she had gotten in
volved in the Fast-a-thon because she has several
close Muslim friends and decided "it would be mean
ingful to fast."
The event was her first time fasting and she said
she felt really tempted to drink some water but was
inspired by the fliers that stressed, "Go without food
fora day so someone else won't have to."
Eangelica Aton.an alumna involved in cardiology
research, has been to the Fast-a-thon for the past two
years and is fasting for the entire month of Ramadan
for the first time this year. She described the event as
"going through a spiritual awakening."
Student organizers felt one difference in this year's
Fast-a-thon was that the money is being sent abroad
rather than to a local charity. Mohammad Subeh, a co
terminal student in Socioiogy and the current vice
president of MS AN, stressed that charity is one of the
"highlights of Islam."
Tlie past two Fast-a-thons have raised money for
local charities, especially the Rahima Foundation,
which provides shelter and food to local families, both
Muslim and non-Muslim. Subeh said that there were
still plans to raise money for the foundation to en
courage help on a local level.
