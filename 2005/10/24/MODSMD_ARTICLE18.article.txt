# 'A History of Violence' ...in sports

Yo, I thought I killed Joey in the desert," Viggo
Mortensen told his wife in A History of Vio
lence. referring to his true identity — the
Philadelphia mobster, not the Indiana farmer his wife
thought she had married — as my friends and 1 choked
back laughter.
(Yes. this is going somewhere. Somewhere sports-re
lated. Just wait.)
We had wanted to see the new Wallace and Gromit
movie but were forced to trade in our tickets when we
found ourselves in the front row, straining our necks to
stare up at the screen. We realized our mistake about 20
minutes into A History of Violence when Viggo's kid
catches a fly ball during gym and subsequently gets into
a fight with the kid who had hit it. "You think you're
tough shit, huh?" the kid asks, slamming Viggo'skid into
a locker. Oh boy.
Because my brain knew it wouldn't have anything
else to do for the next hour and 4() minutes, my thoughts
wandered. I started thinking about my own history of vi
olence, the extent of which has been two badly broken
wrists (actually, just one wrist — my left — two times)
sustained during flag football games, from which I still
have a noticeable protrusion in the ball of my wrist.
But the history of violence in sports goes back much
farther than my own personal history.
I suppose you could argue that the Roman sport of
gladiators, which consisted of Russell Crowe killing a lot
of animals and Roman slaves, was a form of violence.
Or the Aztecs, who played basketball on 20-foot
hoops, after which the losing team would be sacrificed to
the gods.
But today's sports are far more violent than those of
the ancients. Basketball has become a full-contact sport.
Each year, several football players sustain debilitating
injuries: hockey players viciously slam each other into
the boards. Last week, a puck fractured the left orbital
bone of the Maple Leafs' captain Mats Sundin.in 2000,
his teammate, Brian Berard, sustained a ghastly injury
to his eye that left it with almost no vision and derailed
his career.
We also have the occasional self-inflicted death by
steroid (we hardly knew ye. Ken Caminiti).
The most notorious of our violent sports, however, is
boxing. Last month, Leavander Johnson died due to in
juries sustained during his lightweight title bout with
Jesus Chavez; not in the shady rink of a downtown ware
house, but among the glitter of Las Vegas. He died as
businessmen in slick suits sitting ringside checked their
Blackberries. He died in a city that glows like a lake full
of radioactive waste.

the Vatican, Civita Cattolica (Christian Civilization),
