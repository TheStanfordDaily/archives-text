# 'A History of Violence' ...in sports
## 
### 
Yo, I thought I killed Joey in the desert," Viggo
Mortensen told his wife in A History of Vio
lence. referring to his true identity — the
Philadelphia mobster, not the Indiana farmer his wife
thought she had married — as my friends and 1 choked
back laughter.
(Yes. this is going somewhere. Somewhere sports-re
lated. Just wait.)
We had wanted to see the new Wallace and Gromit
movie but were forced to trade in our tickets when we
found ourselves in the front row, straining our necks to
stare up at the screen. We realized our mistake about 20
minutes into A History of Violence when Viggo's kid
catches a fly ball during gym and subsequently gets into
a fight with the kid who had hit it. "You think you're
tough shit, huh?" the kid asks, slamming Viggo'skid into
a locker. Oh boy.
Because my brain knew it wouldn't have anything
else to do for the next hour and 4() minutes, my thoughts
wandered. I started thinking about my own history of vi
olence, the extent of which has been two badly broken
wrists (actually, just one wrist — my left — two times)
sustained during flag football games, from which I still
have a noticeable protrusion in the ball of my wrist.
But the history of violence in sports goes back much
farther than my own personal history.
I suppose you could argue that the Roman sport of
gladiators, which consisted of Russell Crowe killing a lot
of animals and Roman slaves, was a form of violence.
Or the Aztecs, who played basketball on 20-foot
hoops, after which the losing team would be sacrificed to
the gods.
But today's sports are far more violent than those of
the ancients. Basketball has become a full-contact sport.
Each year, several football players sustain debilitating
injuries: hockey players viciously slam each other into
the boards. Last week, a puck fractured the left orbital
bone of the Maple Leafs' captain Mats Sundin.in 2000,
his teammate, Brian Berard, sustained a ghastly injury
to his eye that left it with almost no vision and derailed
his career.
We also have the occasional self-inflicted death by
steroid (we hardly knew ye. Ken Caminiti).
The most notorious of our violent sports, however, is
boxing. Last month, Leavander Johnson died due to in
juries sustained during his lightweight title bout with
Jesus Chavez; not in the shady rink of a downtown ware
house, but among the glitter of Las Vegas. He died as
businessmen in slick suits sitting ringside checked their
Blackberries. He died in a city that glows like a lake full
of radioactive waste.
After the fight, an influential Jesuit magazine close to
the Vatican, Civita Cattolica (Christian Civilization),

called boxing a "legalized form of at
tempted murder."
If you have ever watched a boxing
match, it's hard to disagree with that
argument.
Which should make us ask our
selves: Have we really progressed, or
are we still in the same gladiator are
nas, only with better padding and
cooler uniforms? Do we have the
same need to express our repressed
anger in sporting events before we go
home to our DVD players and our
washing machines? We can cure can
cer and deaden the effects of HIV, but
we also reward our citizens for partic
ipating in modern-day gladiator
matches.
Are we not satisfied with the
amount of violence all around us, in
cluding the terrible movie I was watch
ing? (I think Joey was kicking a mob
ster's nose off his face at this point.)
Every 16 minutes, someone in the
United States dies by a firearm.
Throughout history, the most vio
lent societies have had the bloodiest
forms of entertainment, probably as a
justification and a reflection of the vi
olence in the larger culture.
To some extent, though, violent

sports, movies and video games
embed aggression within us. We go
back to our daily routines when the
house lights come up, or as we wait to
get out of the parking lot. But do we
submerge the seething passions we
experience during the entertainment,
allowing them to simmer below the
surface, waiting for an opportunity to
spring up in real life?
If we want to make our society less
violent, perhaps sports are a good
place to start.
Instead of drawing fans to hockey
games by allowing fighting, forbid it;
instead, make the game more exciting
by making it faster and allow each
team to have only four players on the
ice.
Instead of imposing a 15-yard
penalty fora personal foul when 260-
pound linemen t crash into quarter
backs after a play has ended, double
the penalty and kick the player out of
the game.
Bar any player who uses steroids.
And for God's sake, require all
boxers to wear headgear, or ban the
sport altogether. There's enough
death in real life; we don't need to add
to it.
