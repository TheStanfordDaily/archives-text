# Women's volleyball nabs victory against California
## 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball
team (18-3, 7-2 Pacific-10 Conference), a win
over No. 14 California (13-5,6-3) in front of a
boisterous Berkeley crowd for the first time in
three years would normally be a time to cele
brate.
But the Cardinal's 3-1 victory at Cal (30-26,
30-20, 28-30, 32-30) last Friday was dampered
by the sudden loss of one of the Cardinal's key
contributors.
After recording a kill for the first point in
game three, freshman outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza landed awkwardly on her left knee,
halting play for several minutes as medical per
sonnel tended to her injury on the court. She
was eventually carried off the court to a stand
ing ovation from a mixed Stanford-Cal audi
ence.
Barboza leads the Pac-lOin kills and is being
touted as one of the best freshmen in the na
tion. She was also recently referred to in Sports
Illustrated as the "Nation's top female fresh
man â€” in any sport."
Fora packed crowd that witnessed the in
jury firsthand, the painful expression on Bar
boza's face as she lay on the court said it all.
"There are so many emotions going through
me right now," said junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards, a longtime friend of Barboza, shortly
after the match, it was very scary watching her
go down. She's not just a teammate, she's a best
friend."
Barboza was examined by two doctors at
Haas Pavillion, who could not completely de
termine the extent of the injury. She was further
examined by a team doctor upon arriving at
Stanford later that night.
Game one saw the teams exchange leads
early on before the Golden Bears erupted to
gain a 17-11 advantage. A combination of big
Stanford blocks and Cal hitting errors pulled
the Cardinal to within one, at 16-17. Before

Stanford could capitalize on the momentum,
however, Cal head coach Rich Feller called a
timeout that would propel the Bears to a 25-23
advantage.
Later, after Stanford had taken its first lead
of the match, Stanford rode a 5-1 run for the
rest of the games, and a kill from freshman mid
dle blocker Foluke Akinradewo sealed the
deal, 30-26.
The teams battled for control in game two
until the Cardinal began to pull away right fol
lowing a 5-5 tie. A 5-0 Stanford run fueled the
team's momentum, and the Cardinal held on to
a large lead the rest of the game. A Barboza kill
off a failed Cal block kept the Bears out, 30-20.
"We were really nervous in game one, espe
cially in front of their big crowd," Stanford head
coach John Dunning said. "In game two, pass
ing was the difference, since we did a terrible
job of passing in game one. We also adjusted by
locating the block better."
Coming into game three with momentum
and a much quieter Cal student contingent,
Stanford looked like it would cruise to a 3-0 vic
tory over a talented Cal team. But Barboza's in
jury turned the game upside down for both
teams.
Any fallen teammate would have been
tough enough for the Cardinal, but Dunning's
squad was forced Friday to play without the
star hitter for the first time all season. The ad
justment nearly cost Stanford the crucial Pac
-10 win.
Stanford may have had trouble controlling
their emotions early in game three as the two
teams exchanged blows and leads until the Car
dinal appeared to pull away, 23-18. Three quick
points for the Bears prompted Dunning to call
a timeout to prevent any kind of Cal resur
gence. During the timeout, Barboza, whose
pain was clearly visible in her face, returned to
the sideline on crutches to root on the Cardinal.
A tremendous Cal rally was capped off by a

kill from the Bears' sophomore outside hitter Angie
Pressey to end the game at 30-26. The Bears' victo
ry brought the home crowd back into the fray, and
the momentum appeared to shift back in Cal's
favor.
The fourth game was a classic, as the Bay Area ri
vals seemed evenly-matched. Cal looked primed to
take advantage of a 24-20 lead, the largest margin
for either team in the game, but two wide Cal at
tacks and a kill from sophomore outside hitter Fran
ci Girard brought Stanford to within one, 23-24.
Later, a kill bv Pressey would force game point at
28-29, but a costly Cal service error evened the score
again, 29-alI.
One point later, Pressey's relentless attack
scored another kill to make it 30-all. On the next
point, Cal's block sent the ball Hying out of bounds.
Richards capitalized on match point, blasting a kill
that silenced the crowd, ending an emotionally long
night for the Cardinal with a 32-30 victory.
An emotion-fueled Richards led the charge with
16 kills, 16 digs, and five blocks. Akinradewo added
14 kills of her own and junior outside hitter Jennifer
Wilson, filling in for the injured Barboza, collected
three kills.
"Once I knew 1 was going out to play, 1 just want
ed to go out there and win for [Cynthia]," Wilson
said. "Every time out, we were saying how we want
to win it for her. It brought us together and made us
stronger, and it was definitely a character-building
experience for all of us."
Dunning said Richards' tremendous presence in
the match's closing moments was a big reason for
the Cardinal win.
" Richards played a phenomenal game four,"
Dunning said. "Each person stepped up, and Kristin
really wanted to take the team along with her. I'm
proud of the team; we had a real gutsy, tough effort
on a pretty neat opponent's home court."
With tears in her eyes, Richards offered a differ
ent reason for the Cardinal victory: "It came from
within," she said.
