## Grove plans to celebrate indictment 
### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
As special counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald
deliberates bringing criminal charges
against Karl Rove, senior White House advi
sor, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., chief of staff for
Vice President Dick Cheney, in the grand
jury proceedings surrounding the Valerie
Plame CIA leak, residents of Stanford's
Grove houses say they are devising their
own scheme to berate the officials' allegedly
deceitful testimonies — an "indictment
party."
Should Rove be handed an indictment,
the house staff says they will host a "rager" in
Grove Lasuen that very night,complete with
screwdriver cocktails and patriotic tunes for
added irony. They will also screen a film
about Rove and a documentary called
"Bush's Brain," according to senior Jake
Wachman, resident computer coordinator
(RCC) in Grove Mayfield.
Because the grand jury is set to expire
Oct. 28, legal experts think Fitzgerald is step
ping up efforts to bring indictments in the
case, and the decision could come as early as
today or tomorrow, according to Reuters.
Notably, an indictment is not a guilty ver
dict. Rather, if Rove and Libby are indicted,
they will be charged with committing a seri
ous crime and their cases will go to a formal
trial. And, according to Reuters, it's possible
that Fitzgerald will decide on conspiracy
charges in place of indictment.
Coincidentally, former Ambassador to
Iraq Joseph Wilson — Plame's husband —
is scheduled to speak at Stanford tonight.
Wachman said he e-mailed Wilson, request
ing his presence at Grove's festivities if an in
dictment is issued today. Wilson has so far
not responded to the invitation.
"Ladies and gentlemen, traitors and
spies," Wachman wrote in an e-mail notifica
tion to Stanford students about the houses'
plans. "We are definitely throwing the party
on the night of whatever day Rove is indict
ed. If the indictment is handed out Monday,
we'll throw it Monday. If it is handed out
Tliesday, we'll do it then. If there are no in
dictments, or if only Libby is indicted, then
we'll call off the party and most likely cry."
The Grove houses are particularly fo
cused on the Rove element of the shenani
gans due, in large part, to their residence
theme.
"Last year. Grove's theme was 'Mexi
grove,"' Wachman said. "Some might call
that lame. [Our staff decided that a] 'Karl
Grove' theme was a wildly inappropriate,
once in a lifetime opportunity, so of
course we went with it. This White
House has given us the most amaz
ing potential for schadenfreude in
modern times. We were trying to
capitalize upon it fully. Kicking peo
ple while they're down is a great
American tradition — one that has
unfortunately been underutilized
against this administration until very
recently."
Wachman said that some staff
members expressed concern that the
theme would offend various stu
dents.
Indeed, Grove residents current
ly find themselves immersed in an
investigation regarding the possible
theft of their "Karl Grove" sign, ac
cording to senior Matt TUrnbull, res
ident assistant in Grove Mayfield.
The banner, which once hung in
front of Grove Lasuen. disappeared
on Oct. 14. TUrnbull said he suspects
that campus Republicans who may
have been incensed by the sign are to
blame.
Whether or not foul play was in
volved, and even if some students do
feel alienated by the "Karl Grove"
theme, Wachman said he and other
staff members think it's possible that
the house theme could unify other
students with different political alle
giances in common repugnance for
leaders' ignoble conduct.
"We're now seeing that distaste
for hackery is a shared, nonpartisan
value," Wachman explained. "We
don't intend to alienate Republicans

— just anyone who condones
Rove's brand of lies and machina
tions."
He continued, "Whatever you
think of Bush, Karl Rove is clearly
despicable," referring not only to the
Plame scandal, but also to Rove's
role in "exacerbating environmental
degradation and trampling over the
nation's poor."
But junior Alex Medearis, editor
in chief of the Stanford Review —
the Farm's reputedly conservative
newspaper — said he "doesn't think
that Rove's potential indictment is
something particularly funny or to
be celebrated."
While he agrees that Rove should
be indicted if he did something
wrong, he said that the plans for an
"indictment party" clearly show that
there is a dominant, liberal political
ideology on campus.
"The people who came up with
this theme are a bunch of partisan
hacks," Medearis said."! doubt there
was a party celebrating Clinton's im
peachment."
Medearis added, however, that
The Review values "unbridled free
speech" and that the indictment cel
ebration theme will not stop him
from attending the shindig.
"If there is one place that individ
uals should be free to say nearly
whatever they want, it is a college
campus," he told The Daily. "Plus, 1
love a good party. I'll definitely be
there if it's jumpin'."
Whether or not the grand jury de
cides on indictment and a party is
held at Grove, Wachman expressed
his certainty that Rove will receive
some type of punishment.
"Rove and karma will soon col
lide," he said.
