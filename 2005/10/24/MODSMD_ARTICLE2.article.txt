## Grove plans to celebrate indictment 
### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
As special counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald
deliberates bringing criminal charges
against Karl Rove, senior White House advi
sor, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., chief of staff for
Vice President Dick Cheney, in the grand
jury proceedings surrounding the Valerie
Plame CIA leak, residents of Stanford's
Grove houses say they are devising their
own scheme to berate the officials' allegedly
deceitful testimonies — an "indictment
party."
Should Rove be handed an indictment,
the house staff says they will host a "rager" in
Grove Lasuen that very night,complete with
screwdriver cocktails and patriotic tunes for
added irony. They will also screen a film
about Rove and a documentary called
"Bush's Brain," according to senior Jake
Wachman, resident computer coordinator
(RCC) in Grove Mayfield.
Because the grand jury is set to expire
Oct. 28, legal experts think Fitzgerald is step
ping up efforts to bring indictments in the
case, and the decision could come as early as
today or tomorrow, according to Reuters.
Notably, an indictment is not a guilty ver
dict. Rather, if Rove and Libby are indicted,
they will be charged with committing a seri
ous crime and their cases will go to a formal
trial. And, according to Reuters, it's possible
that Fitzgerald will decide on conspiracy
charges in place of indictment.
Coincidentally, former Ambassador to
Iraq Joseph Wilson — Plame's husband —
is scheduled to speak at Stanford tonight.
Wachman said he e-mailed Wilson, request
ing his presence at Grove's festivities if an in
dictment is issued today. Wilson has so far
not responded to the invitation.
"Ladies and gentlemen, traitors and
spies," Wachman wrote in an e-mail notifica
tion to Stanford students about the houses'
plans. "We are definitely throwing the party
on the night of whatever day Rove is indict
ed. If the indictment is handed out Monday,
we'll throw it Monday. If it is handed out
Tliesday, we'll do it then. If there are no in
dictments, or if only Libby is indicted, then
we'll call off the party and most likely cry."
The Grove houses are particularly fo
cused on the Rove element of the shenani
gans due, in large part, to their residence
theme.
"Last year. Grove's theme was 'Mexi
grove,"' Wachman said. "Some might call
that lame. [Our staff decided that a] 'Karl
Grove' theme was a wildly inappropriate,
