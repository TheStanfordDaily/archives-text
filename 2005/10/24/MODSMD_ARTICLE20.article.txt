players receive berths to the elite Nation

rounds of play, but senior KC Corkery and
junior James Pade avenged their team
mates' losses by defeating two Cal players
in the quarterfinals yesterday. In the semi
finals today, Corkery is scheduled to face
Cal Poly's John Nguyen, and Pade plans to

take on Washington's second-seeded Alex
Slovic, with both matches starting at 11
a.m.
"I think Cal did very well [even with]
their number one player. Conor Niland.
taking the fall quarter off," head coach
John Whitlinger said."Cal's going to be a
formidable opponent; that's for sure."
As the top-seed, Corkery received a
first-round bye before knocking out play
ers from Cal Poly, Santa Clara and Oregon
without dropping more than four games
in any given match. The senior then faced
Cal's Lennart Maack in the quarterfinals.
Maack and Corkery met in 2(M)4 in the
same round of the ITA Regionals, with
Maack claiming a 6-1, 6-0 victory. This
year, however, Corkery prevailed.
After missing an opportunity to serve
out the first set at 5-4, Corkery closed out the
set 7-s.The senior then broke in the follow

ing set and held onto the lead to finish out
the set. 6-4» and consequently, the match.

also sported gold and blue. However, the
Golden Bear did not have any more suc
cess than his teammate did; Pade nabbed
the first set 6-2, lost the second 6-1 and fi
nally closed out the third 6-4.
Stanford's run in the singles draw was
impressive as well, with 10 players win
ning their first-round singles matches.
"The first day really showed me a lot,"
Whitlinger said. "Everybody who played
won at least one match. It was really a
good first day for the team — one of the
best I've ever seen in this tournament."
While team veterans Corkery and
Pade are still alive in the tournament,
three freshmen exited in similar fashion.
Ken Kao, Blake Muller and Jeff Zeller
each won their first matches before falling
in the second round in straight sets.

four lost in their third matches of the tour

from Cal. Sophomore Chris Rasmussen
won his first match in three sets before los

After easily winning two matches in
straight sets, senior Jon Wong's charge was
halted by Cal's Sebescen, 7-6,6-1. As the
tournament's fourth seed, junior James
Wan received a bye in the first round. He
then won his next two matches in straight
sets over players from Pacific and Wash
