their number one player. Conor Niland.
taking the fall quarter off," head coach
John Whitlinger said."Cal's going to be a
formidable opponent; that's for sure."
As the top-seed, Corkery received a
first-round bye before knocking out play
ers from Cal Poly, Santa Clara and Oregon
without dropping more than four games
in any given match. The senior then faced
Cal's Lennart Maack in the quarterfinals.
Maack and Corkery met in 2(M)4 in the
same round of the ITA Regionals, with
Maack claiming a 6-1, 6-0 victory. This
year, however, Corkery prevailed.
After missing an opportunity to serve
out the first set at 5-4, Corkery closed out the
set 7-s.The senior then broke in the follow

ing set and held onto the lead to finish out
the set. 6-4» and consequently, the match.
Pade's opponent, Daniel Sebescen,
also sported gold and blue. However, the
Golden Bear did not have any more suc
cess than his teammate did; Pade nabbed
the first set 6-2, lost the second 6-1 and fi
nally closed out the third 6-4.
Stanford's run in the singles draw was
impressive as well, with 10 players win
ning their first-round singles matches.
"The first day really showed me a lot,"
Whitlinger said. "Everybody who played
won at least one match. It was really a
good first day for the team — one of the
best I've ever seen in this tournament."
While team veterans Corkery and
Pade are still alive in the tournament,
three freshmen exited in similar fashion.
Ken Kao, Blake Muller and Jeff Zeller
each won their first matches before falling
in the second round in straight sets.
Of the five remaining Stanford players,
four lost in their third matches of the tour
nament and three bowed out to players

from Cal. Sophomore Chris Rasmussen
won his first match in three sets before los
ing 6-1,6-1 to fifth-seeded Maack.
After easily winning two matches in
straight sets, senior Jon Wong's charge was
halted by Cal's Sebescen, 7-6,6-1. As the
tournament's fourth seed, junior James
Wan received a bye in the first round. He
then won his next two matches in straight
sets over players from Pacific and Wash
ington before facingTyier Browne,yet an
other Cal opponent. Wan picked up the
first set 6-1, but Browne bounced back to
snag the second. 6-3, and close out the
third. 6-2.
Sophomore Phil Kao and doubles part
ner Eric McKean both won two matches
before dropping their third contests. Kao
gave up a tight, three-setter to Washing
ton's Andy Kuharsky, while McKean
dropped a 7-5, 6-4 decision to Fresno
State's Sergui Modoc.
As Stanford's lone duo in the double's
draw, after exiting the singles draw,
Wan and Rasmussen focused on
doubles yesterday. The pair had de
feated St. Mary's and Hawaii in the
first two rounds of play before en
countering the top-seeded doubles
team, Washington's Slovic and
Daniel Chu. Stanford battled until
the end, but ultimately lost 9-8. los
ing the tiebreaker 7-5.
The only other Stanford pair to
pick up a win this weekend was
Wong and Zeller. The duo defeated
a team from Santa Clara before
falling to UC Davis' Michael Chin

and Justin Garcia, 8-3. Ken Kao and
junior Dave Ryan lost 8-3 in the first
round to a team from University of
Nevada — Reno, while Phil Kao
and McKean received a bye and
then exited to Cal's Browne and Ken
Nakahara. Similarly, Muller paired
with fellow freshman Matt Bruch to
give up a close 8-6 decision to Cal's
Tore Deleuran and Eoin Heavey,
following a first round bye.
"James and Chris did a very good
job [against Washington], but over
all, we've got work ahead of us in
doubles to try to figure out the com
binations that we're going to play,"
Whitlinger said. "But I really like
where [the team's) at right now.
We're playing better at this time, and
I think the guys are ahead of [where
they were] last year."

Tore Deleuran and Eoin Heavey,
following a first round bye.

job [against Washington], but over
all, we've got work ahead of us in
doubles to try to figure out the com
binations that we're going to play,"
Whitlinger said. "But I really like
where [the team's) at right now.
We're playing better at this time, and
I think the guys are ahead of [where
they were] last year."
