### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what is likely to be its most competitive
tournament of the season, the Stanford men's
golf team struggled in its first two rounds yester
day at the Isleworth-UCF Collegiate Invita
tional. At the Isleworth Country Club in Win
dermere, Fla., the men scored a total 23-over
par 599 on the par-72 course, placing the team
14th out of 18 squads.
In their first round, the Cardinal had difficul
ties in the early going, shooting 14 over par, fin
ishing with a stroke total of 302. Only sopho
more Rob Grube managed to stay at even par.
with his score of 72 tying him for 18th.
Junior Zack Miller and senior Kyle Gentry
followed closely behind Grube. with respective
scores of 74 (tied for 33rd) and 77 (tied for
45th). Junior Matt Savage,shot a 79 and finished
tied for 63rd, and senior Scott Mac Donald shot
an 83, which was good for 87th place in the tour
nament.
Because of the threat of inclement weather
from nearby Hurricane Wilma, the tournament
schedule was sped up to include a second round
on the first day. In the accelerated competition,
the men were able to bounce back to some de
gree with a nine-over-par 297.

Grube slipped slightly with a two-over-par
74, leaving him tied for 23rd with a 146 at the
end of the day. Miller's score was three strokes
higher for the round, and he fell to 56th, as did
Gentry who had a second-round score of 79
(156 total) and ended tied for 73rd.
On the bright side. Savage and Mac Donald
both improved to score 73 apiece, leaving Sav
age in 57th place and Mac Donald tied for 87th.
In the past, the Cardinal have been accus
tomed toiconsistent solid performances in their
first two rounds of play, dropping off a bit in the
third. In this competition, with two less-than
stellar composite rounds of golf, Stanford needs
to work on reversing the trend to improve or
even keep its standing.
With the strong competition, though, it may
be difficult. Thirteen of the 18 teams competing
are ranked among the top 20 in the country, in
cluding No. I Georgia, who sits in second, just
one stroke behind Wake Forest.
Rival UCLA, whom the Cardinal recently
fell to atThe Prestige at PGA West,sits in fourth
(581). The Bruins are currently behind No. 3
Oklahoma State (577), who seem to be pushing
fora strong finish.
Play resumes Tuesday for the final round,
following a hiatus today due to the hurricane
threat.
