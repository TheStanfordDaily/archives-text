On the outskirts of campus and
playing on the newly designed, par
71, 6,025-yardage Stanford Golf
Course, the Cardinal women's golf

overall field and a record-breaking
performance by Duke. Stanford fin

ished first, followed by UCLA,
Southern California, Pepperdine

over-par, 303 on the day. Senior Kelly
Husted and freshman Mari Chun
both shot a 75, four over par, and tied
for 38th place individually after the
first round.
Stanford improved on the second
day, shooting a 293, nine over par,

scribed the tournament as"one of the
strongest fields we will face all year."

top TO teams were competing, as well
as 14 of the top 25 teams."
This makes Duke's win and

record setting day all the more im
pressive. Duke led the field from day
one with a score of 283 (one under
par) and never looked back. The
Blue Devils were the only team to
finish under par for the entire tour
