## Ambassador Wilson to speak tonight on campus 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Coincidentally, on the same day that White
House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove or Vice
President Chief of Staff Scooter Libby may be in
dicted for revealing his wife Valerie Plane to be a
CIA operative, former Ambassador to Iraq Joseph
Wilson will be speaking — tonight at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium, in an event sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau. Immediately following a
speech and question and answer session, Wilson
will be available fora book signing of "The Politics
of Truth"in Kresge.
"After Ambassador Wilson wrote an op-ed
piece in the New York Times accusing the Bush ad
ministration of lying about Iraq and weapons of
mass destruction, journalist Bob Novak published
that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame Wilson, was a
covert CIA operative," said Director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau Adam Kahn. a masters student in
the Department of Communications. "Ambas
sador Wilson believes that the White House leaked
this information as retaliation for his NY Times
piece. It has since been revealed that Karl Rove
and Scooter Libbv had discussed Mrs. Wilson's

identity with journalists."
Over the summer, Kahn was contacted regard
ing a speaking tour Ambassador Wilson was mak
ing at colleges along the West Coast.
"The opportunity to have Ambassador Wilson
speak at Stanford was too good to pass up," Kahn
said. "We had no idea when we booked the event
how relevant the timing would be with Judith
Miller being recently released from jail, after get
ting permission from Scooter Libby to reveal his
name. This event is just another example of the
benefits we at Stanford have to hear great speakers
talk about relevant issues that are important to col
lege students and the nation."
Junior Justin Liu, financial officer for the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, also said he believes that Wilson
will be a great speaker.
"Given his past service in U.S. foreign relations.
Ambassador Wilson is in a position to offer some
unique perspectives on our nation's current politi
cal and military involvements and the administra
tive decisions behind them," Liu said. "He has
strong opinions on where the U.S. is heading diplo
matically and what sort of effects our current in
volvements will have on how the U.S. is perceived."
The ASSU Speakers Bureau works with sever

al agencies to find available speakers. When select -
• ing a speaker, the organization'considers relevancy
and name recognition to draw a large turnout, as
well as the speaking topic to make certain that di
verse perspectives are presented on campus, Kahn
said.
The organization has historically hosted a vari
ety of well-known speakers from fields such as pol
itics, entertainment, technology and the arts, in
cluding Howard Dean. Thomas Friedman, Can
dace Bushnell, Ken Jennings and L. Paul Bremer.
In addition to organizing speaker engagements,
the student-run organization also co-sponsors
speaker events with other organizations. During
the 2(X)4-2(X)5 academic year, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau co-sponsored events with over 30 campus
groups, providing them with program funding and
advice.
Members of the ASSU Speakers Bureau often
join midyear, usually after attending an event and
subsequently deciding to contribute to the organi
zation.
Kahn recalled that as a freshman he had as
sumed that one had to be appointed by the ASSU
