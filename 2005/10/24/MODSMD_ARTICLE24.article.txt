# SPECIAL EVENT
## 'Saving Face' director shares personal experience 
### ADA YEE 
Director and writer Alice Wu has attend
ed many question and answer sessions
about her film, "Saving Face," but until Sat
urday night, she had never given a talk
about her work. Wu had turned down other
requests and at first pretended she had not
even received Stanford's invitation.
"It seemed so grandiose to come talk
after having made only one film," Wu said.
But she explained that talking to Cindy Ng,
assistant dean and director of the Asian
American Activities Center (A3C), made
her think that students would want to hear
an Asian-American female speaker who
has made such a career change.
'The model minority myth does not in
clude that Asian Americans are also artists,
writers, performers," Ng said. "So 1 think it's
important to show that there are Asian
Americans in every field and to support
Asian American artists."
"Saving Face" revolves around Wil, a
young Chinese-American lesbian woman,
who struggles to reconcile her sexuality —
which is largely taboo in her Chinese immi
grant circle — with her relationship with
her mother.

"I think that Alice and her film and her
story touch a lot of different people, issues,
individuals and communities," Ng said. "So
I think it made sense that those communi
ties would want to co-sponsor because it
touches their communities as well."
Wu began her lecture by recounting the
story of how her film was made. She began
"Saving Face" while working for Microsoft
after finding herself with little to do. Wu told
the story of how a University of Washington
writing workshop instructor first suggested
that "Saving Face"couid make a good film.
"Fie had this shaming ritual, where every
day we would go around and say what page
we were on," Wu said."l was always on page
five."
Towards the end of the workshop, the in
structor granted her one extra day and Wu
cobbled together a screenplay.
"I was 28 years old and I didn't want to
get an incomplete." she said. Later, encour
aged by her instructor, she left her job at Mi
crosoft and worked in various editing and
unpaid set positions in order to break into
the film industry.
Mario Galarreta, a senior research scien
tist at the School of Medicine, said that it
was Wu's courage to pursue her dream that

impressed him most.
"I'm interested in becoming a filmmak
er, so her story is very inspiring to me," he
said."She's a very brave woman."
Sophomore Violetta Taing heard about
Wu's film through the Organization of Chi
nese Americans (OCA) national e-mail list.
She was most struck by what Wu said about
her experience as an Asian-American at
Stanford.
Wu noted that in 1990, Stanford was only
6 percent Asian, while today it is 25 percent.
She knew no East Asians on her floor in
Cedro and said she was only superficially in
volved with the A3C.
Wu related her experience as an Asian
American to how she came out as gay, a
story which began at Stanford. For an as
signment in History Prof. Estelle Freed
man's introductory feminist studies course,
instead of writing a "coming-out letter," Wu
tape-recorded herself speaking in Man
darin.
Wu said she mistakenly thought of being
Chinese and a lesbian as a choice between
disparate identities, an idea that "Saving
Face" touches upon.
"One of the things that really struck me
was that I didn't know how to say ?gay? in

Mandarin," Wu said."lt struck me that lan
guage helps determine reality. Maybe this
was a reason 1 kept myself away from the
Asian-American community here."
Wu also showed the audience three
movie clips, explaining the choices she
made about color, shadows, lighting, set, lo
cation and blocking. Wu explained her phi
losophy on directing.
"With film, you and I might know there's
a camera and people every where, but at the
moment you're watching, you feel you're
watching a character without them know
ing it," Wu said.
She dedicated a large part of her presen
tation to a question-and-answer session.
When listening to audience members, she
frequently came down from her seat to sit
on the edge of the stage.
"I liked the informality,"said Amy Kapp,
a fourth-year graduate student in statistics.
"She was clearly interested in answering
questions, and I like the way she talked
about various elements. By not trying to be
too detailed, she exposed the audience to
topics they might not know about."
Ken Jue, Class of 1978, explained that he

came to the event "out of curiosity"
and left with a strong sense.of Wu's
passion and courage to pursue her
dreams.
"I really wanted people to realize I
didn't do this [filmmaking] until I was

28," Wu said in an interview with The
Daily after the speech. "I wanted to
give students some measure — you
can just do what you need to do when
you need to do it. Life isn't lived lin
early."

Center, the Women?s Community
Center, the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion and the new Film and Media
Studies program.
