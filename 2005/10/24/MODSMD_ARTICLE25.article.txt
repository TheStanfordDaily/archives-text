# PERFORMANCE
## Mixed Company turns twenty 
### ANDREA FULLER 
Instead of groans about upcoming
midterms or whispers about Full Moon on
the Quad, the sounds of crying toddlers
filled the halls of Memorial Auditorium
Saturday night before Mixed Company's
20th anniversary a cappella show. The pro
gram brought together members from the
past, as well as an audience of alumni —
with families in tow —visiting for Home
coming Weekend.
Members from five-year intervals per
formed in chronological order, each singing
two pieces. The show concluded with a per
formance by current Mixed Company
members and the entire group's rendition
of'Leland's Island.' Mixed Company's ver
sion of the history of Stanford to the tune of
'Gilligan's Island.'
The progression of the show illustrated
the change Mixed Company, Stanford's
oldest co-ed a cappella group, has experi
enced since its foundation.
"The group first started as being a little
bit more traditional," said Mixed Company
Musical Director Conor Mayo-Wilson, a
senior. "They did some pop and jazz, but
they moved to doing rock and alternative
and doing imitation of instrumentation. A
lot of the goal of the reunion show was to
show what the group has done in the last 20
years and how it has changed and how a
cappella has changed in general."
The show's coordination required elab
orate planning by the current troupe, in

eluding contacting alumni and choosing
songs indicative of each group's era.
"For the people planning, I think it's
kind of two-sidedsaid senior Natasha
Chen, one of Mixed Company's group
leads. "It's for the current members to re
alize what kind of a family Mixed Compa
ny is — it's not just a family within the
year you're singing. It's this whole legacy.
It's also for older members to come back
and connect with Mixed Company and
give the current group the support that it
needs."
Counterpoint Business Manager Jenny
Cohen, a senior, noted the enthusiasm
sparked by a reunion show, a long tradition
for Stanford a cappella groups.
"Last year we had our 25th reunion, and
we had about 80 past members come back
and we had all of the groups there," she said.
"People Hew in from all over the country.
People really love people in a cappella and
become best friends. It has a huge social
component."
Iliough Saturday's show focused on
Mixed Company's anniversary and the pro
motion of their compilation album "A Hel
luva Lot More Fun." the program also inte
grated performances from the other eight a
cappella groups on campus.The groups per
formed in order of their establishment,
starting with Stanford's oldest a cappella
group, the Mendicants, and ending with
Raagapella, "Stanford's South Asian music
group.
"A cappella is one of those special things

that takes music a step further because you
don't have musical accompaniment like
piano and it sounds generated by people,"
said Talisman Manager Teresa Dicolen, a
sophomore. "That's what makes it special
for the audience. We didn't have a cappella
in my high school, so it's an entirely differ
ent experience to come here."
The growth of a cappella at Stanford has
sparked a competitive audition process, in
tense for both returning members and

eager students auditioning.
"You basically have a week where you
don't eat. don't sleep." Chen said. "You're
trying so hard to get the best new singers
for your group. That means publicizing, re
hearsing, recruiting and tabling in White
Plaza. Audition hours are crazy — six to
eight a day for three days straight. It's total
ly worth it because when you're finished
you have the potential to be an even
stronger group than you were before. If

you get good new people, it's a really good
family."
Chen said she believes that the a cappel
la tradition at Stanford will continue to
thrive in years to come.
"We just love to sing," she said. "We are
hardworking students but so many of us
have this passion and want to sing together.
As long as there's that desire, there will be a
lot of energy in the Stanford a cappella
community"
