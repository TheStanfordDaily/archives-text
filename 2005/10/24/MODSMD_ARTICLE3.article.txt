### KAT LEWIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Close to 500 Students ran Sunday
morning in the 10th annual Theta Breakers
race, sponsored by the sorority Kappa
Alpha Theta, to support Child Advocates,
an organization that provides mentors and
court-appointed specialists to help chil
dren who have been removed from their
homes.
"It's the single most successful Greek
philanthropic event in the nation, which is
a pretty big deal," said event co-coordina
tor Karissa Hazy, a junior. "It's a big event
compared to most other Greek philan
thropic events, where they raise only a few

Last year, the race raised $18,348 for

Hazy said. "We're not just donating to a

Potter said. "I think the general feel is that
this is a really fun race.TTie band is coming,
there's a lot of student support and it's a
very pretty course to run."
This year?s event attracted a better
turn-out than years past, according to
Hazy. Students chose to participate in ei

walk/run which began and ended at the
Stadium. Team events were also available
for either category.
Matt Henry, a senior, participated for
his third year on Kappa Sigma's team.
"People here are generally excited for
it," Henry said. "They know it's fora good
cause, so that helps. It's not for the times,
not for the athleticism — it's for the chari
