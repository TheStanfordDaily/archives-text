## Students race for charity Kappa Alpha Theta put on annual Theta Breakers race 
### KAT LEWIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Close to 500 Students ran Sunday
morning in the 10th annual Theta Breakers
race, sponsored by the sorority Kappa
Alpha Theta, to support Child Advocates,
an organization that provides mentors and
court-appointed specialists to help chil
dren who have been removed from their
homes.
"It's the single most successful Greek
philanthropic event in the nation, which is
a pretty big deal," said event co-coordina
tor Karissa Hazy, a junior. "It's a big event
compared to most other Greek philan
thropic events, where they raise only a few
thousand dollars."
Last year, the race raised $18,348 for
Child Advocates, according to junior
Stephanie Potter, Theta Breakers' other
co-coordinator.
"It's a national organization and this
event,Theta Breakers, specifically donates
to San Mateo and Santa Clara counties,"
Hazy said. "We're not just donating to a

huge national charity — we're donating to
the community."
Participants include Stanford students
and alumni. Special Olympics groups and
interested members of the community, ac
cording to Potter. As well as being a philan
thropic event, she said she feels that Theta
Breakers has a larger draw for students.
"I don't know how much of it in the stu
dents' minds is about it being fora good
cause, but the community is very aware,"
Potter said. "I think the general feel is that
this is a really fun race.TTie band is coming,
there's a lot of student support and it's a
very pretty course to run."
This year?s event attracted a better
turn-out than years past, according to
Hazy. Students chose to participate in ei
ther a 10 kilometer run or a 5 kilometer
walk/run which began and ended at the
Stadium. Team events were also available
for either category.
Matt Henry, a senior, participated for
his third year on Kappa Sigma's team.
"People here are generally excited for
it," Henry said. "They know it's fora good
cause, so that helps. It's not for the times,
not for the athleticism — it's for the chari
ty and the cause. It's put on by people we
know, so we support them.''
Over the past 10 years, Theta
Breakers has become a campus tra
dition. It strives to combine humani
tarianism with a social environment,
coordinators said.
"When they hear Theta Breakers,
people will recognize that name,
which is pretty indicative of how it
has integrated itself into the Stanford
community over the years." Hazy
said. "It qualifies as an athletic event,
but also as a philanthropic event, so
it's a nice merging of the two."

This year, the coordinators tried
to boost student participation by ap
pealing to the young demographic.
As a new addition this year, the band
and Dollies performed while run
ners entered the stadium and when
they crossed the finish line.
"We target all of the alumni who
are coming back for Homecoming,
all of ourTheta alumni and the com
munity around Palo Alto, but we
tried to focus on targeting the stu
dents this year because Stanford is so
active," Hazy said.
The race also offered more elabo
rate prizes than in years past, accord
ing to coordinators. Prizes included
tickets to see Celine Dion in Las
Vegas, tickets to a Lakers game in
Los Angeles, autographed LA Kings

gear, a video and computer game set,
MP3/CD players and a range of gift
certificates.
However,some participants were
more impressed with the atmos
phere than anything else.
"I was able to just go there and
pretty much start running," said
sophomore Brent Pirruccello. "We
didn't have to do anything except
sign up our names and pay $15.
That's how community service
events should be — it shouldn't have
to be a hassle to give your time or
money to a cause. It was very well or
ganized. It was nice how all the
Thetas showed support."
Theta Breakers earned approxi
mately $7,500 on Sunday, as well as
about $15,000 from personal and

corporate contributions, according
to Potter and Hazy. Corporate spon
sors included Phillips Electronics,
PowerCET. Western States Oil and
Stanford Federal Credit Union. Al
though calculations have not been fi
nalized yet, coordinators hope to
clear $20,000, making this the most
profitable Theta Breakers race to
date.
Regardless of what the total
comes to, Potter considers the race a
success.
'it was so rewarding to see all the
smiling faces on the participants
after completing the race," she said.
"All of us Thetas had a great time
working together and putting on
such a successful event again this
vear."
