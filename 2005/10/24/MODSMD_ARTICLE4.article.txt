## Three for the Card Strong start and solid special teams give Card third straight win 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
—WALF HARRIS, on Stanford's turnover ratio

It seems that nothing has come
easy for Stanford football this sea
son. Even Saturday, when the Cardi
nal put together what was undoubt
edly their best all-around perform
ance of the year, there was drama
until the end.
But for the third straight week,
Stanford (4-2,3-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) did all it had to do to pick up
the win — this time a 45-35 decision
over Arizona State (3-4,1-3).
The Cardinal dominated the first
half and most of the third period,
scoring 38 consecutive points over a
three-quarter span. Stanford led 31-
7 at the half and scored the first 14
points of the third quarter.
Senior quarterback Trent Ed
wards continued to improve, throw
ing for three touchdowns and 303
yards, both new career highs. Just as
important, Edwards went without
an interception for the third straight
week.
Edwards' first touchdown pass
came early in the first quarter, when
sophomore tailback Anthony Kim
ble tipped a screen pass to himself
and strutted into the endzone fora
10-yard score. Edwards also found
junior receiver Mark Bradford for
two first half touchdowns, both on
completions of over 30 yards.
"A lot of the outside routes were
open," Edwards said. "Watching the
film from last week against Arizona,
I left a few plays on the field where
Bradford was open, so I was trying
to put a little more emphasis this
week on holding on to it a bit longer
and staying in the pocket. I thought I
was able to do that and deliver the
ball to him."
The game was also one of Brad
ford's best. He caught nine passes
fora career-high 183 yards and had
two scores.

Junior wide receiver Mark Bradford jumps for the catch during Saturday's thrilling 45-
35 victory over the Sun Devils. Bradford finished the game as the best receiver on
the day for both teams, pulling down nine strikes from quarterback Trent Edwards for
I 83 yards and two scores.
Stanford achieves its first home win

"Fora receiver, we have one of
the best systems going," head coach
Walt Harris said. "Why do I say that?
Because of the productivity my
teams have had at that position.
[Bradford's] starting to understand
that, and I think it is getting more fun
for him."
Stanford's early offensive pro
duction was aided by a number of
Arizona State miscues, most notably
ASU's kicking game.The Sun Devils
had two punts blocked and also took
an illegal kicking penalty on a third
when Arizona State punter Chris
Mac Donald crossed the line of
scrimmage before getting the kick
away.The Cardinal scored on each of
the possessions following the blown
kicks.
"It's funny how special teams'
plays always make the games," senior
nose tackle Babatunde Oshinowo
said. "1 think there is a saying that
goes back to my freshman year that
'if a team blocks a punt, they are
probably going to win the game.'
Those types of things help the of
fense out."
Oshinowo did his job on the de
fensive side of the ball, picking up
three of the team's six sacks. He had
nine total tackles, four fora loss.
The biggest play for the Stanford
defense came on Arizona State's sec
ond drive of the second half, when
senior linebacker Mike Silva inter
cepted a pass from the Sun Devils'
backup quarterback Rudy Carpen
ter and returned it 26 yards fora
score.
Carpenter had come into the
game earlier in that drive, when
starter Sam Keller was pulled from
the game. Keller — who had strug
gled with an injured thumb, shoul
der, and ankle — failed to move the
Arizona State offense. Keller has av
eraged over 348 yards per game in his

career, but only managed 98 before
leaving the game.
"It's a tough situation where your
starting quarterback is coming back
from three different injuries," Ari
zona State head coach Dirk Koetter
said. "I didn't feel like we could de
prive Sam from being the starting
quarterback after all his hard work to
come back. When we made the
switch it was meant as no disrespect
to Sam. We were just looking fora
spark."
As it turned out, Stanford was for
tunate to have built such a substan
tial lead. The Sun Devils refused to
go quietly and rallied behind Car
penter to score 28 straight points be
fore the game's end.
Arizona State finished with 528
total yards, well more than the Cardi
nal's 369. Carpenter threw well, com
pleting 19 of 25 passes for 304 yards
and three scores.
"I practice every day as if I'm
going to play," Carpenter said.
"Today 1 got my opportunity and I
did the best I could, but I still made
lots of mistakes like everybody else."
The Sun Devils' final touchdown
came on a 19-yard pass to Brent
Miller with one minute remaining,
and an attempt at a two-point con
version threatened to move Arizona
State within one score of the Cardi
nal. However, on the attempt. Car
penter was stopped in his scramble
for the goal line, all but ending the
Sun Devils' dreams of a comeback.
"We're excited about the first half
that we played and part of the third
quarter," Harris said. "Obviously we
have a lot of areas that we need to
improve. We need to learn how to
finish a game, but we did the things
that we had to do. We got way ahead
and that affected our play calling,
and that affected how we played on
both sides of the ball."

The win was Stanford's third
straight win over a Pac-10 opponent.
The Cardinal hadn't won three
straight conference games since
1999. It also puts Stanford just two
wins away from a bowl birth. Still,
Coach Harris isn't ready to think
about that yet.
"We don't want to talk about
bowls — we've got a tough sched
ule," he said. "What happens is if
you're talking about bowls, you're
looking past who we're playing next
and looking past what you have to do
in order to play well."

"It's a tough situation where your
starting quarterback is coming back
from three different injuries," Ari
zona State head coach Dirk Koetter
said. "I didn't feel like we could de
prive Sam from being the starting
quarterback after all his hard work to
come back. When we made the
switch it was meant as no disrespect
to Sam. We were just looking fora
spark."
As it turned out, Stanford was for
tunate to have built such a substan
tial lead. The Sun Devils refused to
go quietly and rallied behind Car
penter to score 28 straight points be
fore the game's end.
Arizona State finished with 528
total yards, well more than the Cardi
nal's 369. Carpenter threw well, com
pleting 19 of 25 passes for 304 yards
and three scores.
"I practice every day as if I'm
going to play," Carpenter said.
"Today 1 got my opportunity and I
did the best I could, but I still made
lots of mistakes like everybody else."
The Sun Devils' final touchdown
came on a 19-yard pass to Brent
Miller with one minute remaining,
and an attempt at a two-point con
version threatened to move Arizona
State within one score of the Cardi
nal. However, on the attempt. Car
penter was stopped in his scramble
for the goal line, all but ending the
Sun Devils' dreams of a comeback.
"We're excited about the first half
that we played and part of the third
quarter," Harris said. "Obviously we
have a lot of areas that we need to
improve. We need to learn how to
finish a game, but we did the things
that we had to do. We got way ahead
and that affected our play calling,
and that affected how we played on
both sides of the ball."

The win was Stanford's third
straight win over a Pac-10 opponent.
The Cardinal hadn't won three
straight conference games since
1999. It also puts Stanford just two
wins away from a bowl birth. Still,
Coach Harris isn't ready to think
about that yet.
"We don't want to talk about
bowls — we've got a tough sched
ule," he said. "What happens is if
you're talking about bowls, you're
looking past who we're playing next
and looking past what you have to do
in order to play well."

It seems that nothing has come
easy for Stanford football this sea
son. Even Saturday, when the Cardi
nal put together what was undoubt
edly their best all-around perform
ance of the year, there was drama
until the end.
But for the third straight week,
Stanford (4-2,3-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) did all it had to do to pick up
the win — this time a 45-35 decision
over Arizona State (3-4,1-3).
The Cardinal dominated the first
half and most of the third period,
scoring 38 consecutive points over a
three-quarter span. Stanford led 31-
7 at the half and scored the first 14
points of the third quarter.
Senior quarterback Trent Ed
wards continued to improve, throw
ing for three touchdowns and 303
yards, both new career highs. Just as
important, Edwards went without
an interception for the third straight
week.
Edwards' first touchdown pass
came early in the first quarter, when
sophomore tailback Anthony Kim
ble tipped a screen pass to himself
and strutted into the endzone fora
10-yard score. Edwards also found
junior receiver Mark Bradford for
two first half touchdowns, both on
completions of over 30 yards.
"A lot of the outside routes were
open," Edwards said. "Watching the
film from last week against Arizona,
I left a few plays on the field where
Bradford was open, so I was trying
to put a little more emphasis this
week on holding on to it a bit longer
and staying in the pocket. I thought I
was able to do that and deliver the
ball to him."
The game was also one of Brad
ford's best. He caught nine passes
fora career-high 183 yards and had
two scores.


JOEL LEWENSTEIN/The Stanford Daily
Junior wide receiver Mark Bradford jumps for the catch during Saturday's thrilling 45-
35 victory over the Sun Devils. Bradford finished the game as the best receiver on
the day for both teams, pulling down nine strikes from quarterback Trent Edwards for
I 83 yards and two scores.
Stanford achieves its first home win

"Fora receiver, we have one of
the best systems going," head coach
Walt Harris said. "Why do I say that?
Because of the productivity my
teams have had at that position.
[Bradford's] starting to understand
that, and I think it is getting more fun
for him."
Stanford's early offensive pro
duction was aided by a number of
Arizona State miscues, most notably
ASU's kicking game.The Sun Devils
had two punts blocked and also took
an illegal kicking penalty on a third
when Arizona State punter Chris
Mac Donald crossed the line of
scrimmage before getting the kick
away.The Cardinal scored on each of
the possessions following the blown
kicks.
"It's funny how special teams'
plays always make the games," senior
nose tackle Babatunde Oshinowo
said. "1 think there is a saying that
goes back to my freshman year that
'if a team blocks a punt, they are
probably going to win the game.'
Those types of things help the of
fense out."
Oshinowo did his job on the de
fensive side of the ball, picking up
three of the team's six sacks. He had
nine total tackles, four fora loss.
The biggest play for the Stanford
defense came on Arizona State's sec
ond drive of the second half, when
senior linebacker Mike Silva inter
cepted a pass from the Sun Devils'
backup quarterback Rudy Carpen
ter and returned it 26 yards fora
score.
Carpenter had come into the
game earlier in that drive, when
starter Sam Keller was pulled from
the game. Keller — who had strug
gled with an injured thumb, shoul
der, and ankle — failed to move the
Arizona State offense. Keller has av
eraged over 348 yards per game in his

career, but only managed 98 before
leaving the game.
