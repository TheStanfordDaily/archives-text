## Three for the Card Strong start and solid special teams give Card third straight win 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
—WALF HARRIS, on Stanford's turnover ratio

It seems that nothing has come
easy for Stanford football this sea
son. Even Saturday, when the Cardi
nal put together what was undoubt
edly their best all-around perform
ance of the year, there was drama
until the end.
But for the third straight week,
Stanford (4-2,3-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) did all it had to do to pick up
the win — this time a 45-35 decision
over Arizona State (3-4,1-3).
The Cardinal dominated the first
half and most of the third period,
scoring 38 consecutive points over a
three-quarter span. Stanford led 31-
7 at the half and scored the first 14
points of the third quarter.
Senior quarterback Trent Ed
wards continued to improve, throw
ing for three touchdowns and 303
yards, both new career highs. Just as
important, Edwards went without
an interception for the third straight
week.
Edwards' first touchdown pass
came early in the first quarter, when
sophomore tailback Anthony Kim
ble tipped a screen pass to himself
and strutted into the endzone fora
10-yard score. Edwards also found
junior receiver Mark Bradford for
two first half touchdowns, both on
completions of over 30 yards.
"A lot of the outside routes were
open," Edwards said. "Watching the
film from last week against Arizona,
I left a few plays on the field where
Bradford was open, so I was trying
to put a little more emphasis this
week on holding on to it a bit longer
and staying in the pocket. I thought I
was able to do that and deliver the
ball to him."
The game was also one of Brad
ford's best. He caught nine passes
fora career-high 183 yards and had
two scores.
