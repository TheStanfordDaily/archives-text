## Frost chosen to replace Stadium for ceremony 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
University officials have decided upon
Frost Amphitheater as the venue for Stan
ford's 115 th commencement ceremony. The
sight is scenic and carries tradition, but its
9,000-guest seating capacity is a stark contrast
from the 85,000 seat stadium. Graduate and
undergraduate ceremonies will be held sepa
rately and students will have to limit their
number of guests.
"Numerous options were considered,"
said Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to Universi
ty President John Hennessy. "Each of them
had advantages, but they also all had draw
backs. On balance. Frost seemed the best al
ternative given those considerations. Frost is a
magnificent setting where graduation was
held for many years. Its main drawback is
that, unlike the stadium, there is a limit on the
number of people who can attend: we know
this may be a disappointment to some stu
dents."
A committee composed of both under
graduate and graduate representatives was
appointed specifically to consider the issue of
commencement's location, but it was Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy who
made the ultimate decision.
"We were brought into this process a week
ago to represent the Senior Class and to give
our opinions on the administration's pre-se
lected venues," said senior class presidents
Kevin Gao, Pamela Kum, James Mitchell and
Shyam Ravindran in an e-mail addressed to
the senior class. "We strongly expressed that
the top priority of seniors is to maximize the
number of guests they can bring, especially
since students have been able to bring as
many guests as they wanted in the past. How
ever, the administration felt that other factors
they considered outweighed our priority."
The graduate ceremony will be held on
Saturday, June 17th, and the undergraduate
ceremony will be held on Sunday, June 18th.
They will feature two different commence
ment speakers, which will not be assigned for
several months.
"I think it's sad that they're separating
graduates and undergraduates," said co-ter
minal student Dana Schmidt, who will gradu
ate this June from the School of Education.
"It's fun when they go through the different

schools and yell 'rights, privileges and
responsibilities.'"
Frost Amphitheater has histori
cally been the site for commence
ment ceremonies, but some seniors
are worried newer traditions may be
lost.
"1 don't know how you do the
Wacky Walk in Frost," said senior Vi
neet Bhagwat. "Frost Amphitheater
is where we watched our first Flicks
and had our first advising meetings.
It's not very elegant. It's just leveled
grass."
While students will be limited to
approximately four guests, overflow
seating will be available where visi
tors may watch the ceremony on a
large screen in venues such as Maples
Pavilion. Wachtel said he believes
that this will accommodate all the
family and friends of the graduates.
"I don't know if the guest limit
will be a problem for me." said senior
John Pearlstein. "A lot of my older
relatives probably didn't want to sit
out in the sun and watch me anyway.
Watching it on the big screen is sort
of tacky, but I don't know what else
they could do."
Departmental ceremonies, where
students receive their individual
diplomas, will still have unlimited
seating capacity.
"The big graduation ceremony is
just a bunch of pomp and circum
stance," Pearlstein said. "I feel like
my parents would only see a little
speck of me. What's more important
is the more intimate departmental
ceremony."
The administration says they are
open to working with students to
make graduation a success. One plan
is to devise a ticket-exchange mar
ketplace to facilitate the use of tick
ets that may go unused by students
who have less than four guests.
"We are very willing to fund inno
vative ideas to enrich commence
ment as a celebration for entire fam
ilies, given the seating limitations at
Frost." Wachtel said.

"The big graduation ceremony is
just a bunch of pomp and circum
stance," Pearlstein said. "I feel like
my parents would only see a little
speck of me. What's more important
is the more intimate departmental
ceremony."
The administration says they are
open to working with students to
make graduation a success. One plan
is to devise a ticket-exchange mar
ketplace to facilitate the use of tick
ets that may go unused by students
who have less than four guests.
"We are very willing to fund inno
vative ideas to enrich commence
ment as a celebration for entire fam
ilies, given the seating limitations at
Frost." Wachtel said.
University officials have decided upon
Frost Amphitheater as the venue for Stan
ford's 115 th commencement ceremony. The
sight is scenic and carries tradition, but its
9,000-guest seating capacity is a stark contrast
from the 85,000 seat stadium. Graduate and
undergraduate ceremonies will be held sepa
rately and students will have to limit their
number of guests.
"Numerous options were considered,"
said Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to Universi
ty President John Hennessy. "Each of them
had advantages, but they also all had draw
backs. On balance. Frost seemed the best al
ternative given those considerations. Frost is a
magnificent setting where graduation was
held for many years. Its main drawback is
that, unlike the stadium, there is a limit on the
number of people who can attend: we know
this may be a disappointment to some stu
dents."
A committee composed of both under
graduate and graduate representatives was
appointed specifically to consider the issue of
commencement's location, but it was Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy who
made the ultimate decision.
"We were brought into this process a week
ago to represent the Senior Class and to give
our opinions on the administration's pre-se
lected venues," said senior class presidents
Kevin Gao, Pamela Kum, James Mitchell and
Shyam Ravindran in an e-mail addressed to
the senior class. "We strongly expressed that
the top priority of seniors is to maximize the
number of guests they can bring, especially
since students have been able to bring as
many guests as they wanted in the past. How
ever, the administration felt that other factors
they considered outweighed our priority."
The graduate ceremony will be held on
Saturday, June 17th, and the undergraduate
ceremony will be held on Sunday, June 18th.
They will feature two different commence
ment speakers, which will not be assigned for
several months.
"I think it's sad that they're separating
graduates and undergraduates," said co-ter
minal student Dana Schmidt, who will gradu
ate this June from the School of Education.
"It's fun when they go through the different

schools and yell 'rights, privileges and
responsibilities.'"
Frost Amphitheater has histori
cally been the site for commence
ment ceremonies, but some seniors
are worried newer traditions may be
lost.
"1 don't know how you do the
Wacky Walk in Frost," said senior Vi
neet Bhagwat. "Frost Amphitheater
is where we watched our first Flicks
and had our first advising meetings.
It's not very elegant. It's just leveled
grass."
While students will be limited to
approximately four guests, overflow
seating will be available where visi
tors may watch the ceremony on a
large screen in venues such as Maples
Pavilion. Wachtel said he believes
that this will accommodate all the
family and friends of the graduates.
"I don't know if the guest limit
will be a problem for me." said senior
John Pearlstein. "A lot of my older
relatives probably didn't want to sit
out in the sun and watch me anyway.
Watching it on the big screen is sort
of tacky, but I don't know what else
they could do."
Departmental ceremonies, where
students receive their individual
diplomas, will still have unlimited
seating capacity.
"The big graduation ceremony is
just a bunch of pomp and circum
stance," Pearlstein said. "I feel like
my parents would only see a little
speck of me. What's more important
is the more intimate departmental
ceremony."
