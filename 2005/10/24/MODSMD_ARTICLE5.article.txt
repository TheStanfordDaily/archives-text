## Frost chosen to replace Stadium for ceremony 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
University officials have decided upon
Frost Amphitheater as the venue for Stan
ford's 115 th commencement ceremony. The
sight is scenic and carries tradition, but its
9,000-guest seating capacity is a stark contrast
from the 85,000 seat stadium. Graduate and
undergraduate ceremonies will be held sepa
rately and students will have to limit their
number of guests.
"Numerous options were considered,"
said Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to Universi
ty President John Hennessy. "Each of them
had advantages, but they also all had draw
backs. On balance. Frost seemed the best al
ternative given those considerations. Frost is a
magnificent setting where graduation was
held for many years. Its main drawback is
that, unlike the stadium, there is a limit on the
number of people who can attend: we know
this may be a disappointment to some stu
dents."
A committee composed of both under
graduate and graduate representatives was
appointed specifically to consider the issue of
commencement's location, but it was Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy who
made the ultimate decision.
"We were brought into this process a week
ago to represent the Senior Class and to give
our opinions on the administration's pre-se
lected venues," said senior class presidents
Kevin Gao, Pamela Kum, James Mitchell and
Shyam Ravindran in an e-mail addressed to
the senior class. "We strongly expressed that
the top priority of seniors is to maximize the
number of guests they can bring, especially
since students have been able to bring as
many guests as they wanted in the past. How
ever, the administration felt that other factors
they considered outweighed our priority."
The graduate ceremony will be held on
Saturday, June 17th, and the undergraduate
ceremony will be held on Sunday, June 18th.
They will feature two different commence
ment speakers, which will not be assigned for
several months.
"I think it's sad that they're separating
graduates and undergraduates," said co-ter
minal student Dana Schmidt, who will gradu
ate this June from the School of Education.
"It's fun when they go through the different
