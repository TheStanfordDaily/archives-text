## Alumni praise success of Reunion Homecoming 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WRITER 
It was hard to miss the masses of
white and cardinal-clad alumni wan
dering through campus this weekend.
With an estimated 8,000 attendees, it
was the largest Reunion Homecom
ing to date, according to the director
of classes and reunions, Leslie
Winick.
"We had a 43 percent attendance
rate for the class of 2000, who are just
five years out, and we had a 44 per
cent attendance rate for the 50 year
reunion," Winick said. "That's pretty
exciting."
Of the 8,000 attendees, 5,500 were
alumni — representing approxi
mately 36 percent of the classes of
1940, 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965,
1970,1975,1980,1985,1990,1995 and
2000.
"People are always afraid that
they won't know anyone at their
college reunion," Winick said.
"Well, when almost half of each
class comes back, you're going to

know someone."
Winick and 11 other Stanford em
ployees along with 1,500 volunteers
worked year-round to organize the
426 events the weekend had in store.
"The big, core events are organ
ized by class," Winick explained.
"There's the class panel, where alum
ni share where they are in their lives
— their age and stage, as we put it.
Then there are the class reunion cele
brations. It's like organizing 13 wed
dings all for one night. For the foot
ball game, we have class tailgates and
then there are over 350 mini-re
unions for different student groups
on campus."
Other major events included a
welcome address by University Pres
ident John Hennessy in Memorial
Auditorium on Friday and the popu
lar "Classes Without Quizzes," in
which professors donated their time
to give lectures to the alumni on a
plethora of topics ranging from ethics
to international relations to modern
