# SPECIAL EVENT
## Alumni praise success of Reunion Homecoming 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WRITER 
It was hard to miss the masses of
white and cardinal-clad alumni wan
dering through campus this weekend.
With an estimated 8,000 attendees, it
was the largest Reunion Homecom
ing to date, according to the director
of classes and reunions, Leslie
Winick.
"We had a 43 percent attendance
rate for the class of 2000, who are just
five years out, and we had a 44 per
cent attendance rate for the 50 year
reunion," Winick said. "That's pretty
exciting."
Of the 8,000 attendees, 5,500 were
alumni — representing approxi
mately 36 percent of the classes of
1940, 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965,
1970,1975,1980,1985,1990,1995 and
2000.
"People are always afraid that
they won't know anyone at their
college reunion," Winick said.
"Well, when almost half of each
class comes back, you're going to

know someone."
Winick and 11 other Stanford em
ployees along with 1,500 volunteers
worked year-round to organize the
426 events the weekend had in store.
"The big, core events are organ
ized by class," Winick explained.
"There's the class panel, where alum
ni share where they are in their lives
— their age and stage, as we put it.
Then there are the class reunion cele
brations. It's like organizing 13 wed
dings all for one night. For the foot
ball game, we have class tailgates and
then there are over 350 mini-re
unions for different student groups
on campus."
Other major events included a
welcome address by University Pres
ident John Hennessy in Memorial
Auditorium on Friday and the popu
lar "Classes Without Quizzes," in
which professors donated their time
to give lectures to the alumni on a
plethora of topics ranging from ethics
to international relations to modern

technology.
"There was an amazing amount
of academic programming provided
by the faculty, which was a tremen
dous draw," said Howard Wolf, pres
ident of the Alumni Association;
who graduated in 1980.
Of marked importance to some
was English Prof. Emeritus Ron
Rebholz's lecture, "Sex, Lies and
I"heater: Shakespeare for Today."
Rebholz has been teaching at Stan
ford since 1961, and many former
students were overjoyed by the op
portunity to learn from their old pro
fessor once again.
"He changed their lives and cre
ated an intellectual love of Shake
speare," Wolf said of Rebholz.
"These alumni were literally sitting
at the feet of the master. They
loved it."
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion was founded June 15. 1892, and
one of its first actions was to plan a
reunion lor the following year, ex
plained Wolf.'lbis year was the 113 th
reunion, and the tradition is still
going strong.
"The reunions give current stu
dents and young alumni a sense of
those who have come before them
and gives the members of the older
classes a sense of those who have fol
lowed after them," Winick said. "The
continuum is great to see. and it's a
huge part of why the University in
vests and dedicates so much time to
reunions."
Several alumni said they were ex
tremely pleased by the event.
"It's fantastic."said former Dollie
Loretta Churchill Montes, Class of
1975. "This reunion is extra special to
me because my son is here now, and
I just bumped into the daughter of a
friend of mine."
Others loved the opportunity to
share old memories. Jim Triolo, Class
of 1935, gave a speech on Sunday at
the very same podium where he
stood 70 years ago as the senior class
president.
"He led the Cardinal Society in
the Axe yell," Winick said. "And I
think he knows it better than most of
the current students."
After months of planning. Wolf
said he was extremely pleased with
the weekend.
"Our mission is to create lifelong
intellectual and emotional connec
tions between the University and its
graduates and between graduates
and other graduates," he said. "I
think we did a fantastic job."
Both Wolf and Winick empha
sized the role that current students
played in the reunion.
"When the alumni see the current
students, for example, at the a cap
pella show, they light up," Winick
said. "Ihey can't believe that the stu
dents are so talented. The main rea
son that they are here is to see each
other, but they love to see the stu
dents today.They want to know what
Stanford is like now."
This year, a member of Wolfs
class came back to her first reunion
after 25 years.
"She left me a message telling me
how silly she'd been not to come to
any reunions before this one," Wolf
said. "She was so impressed. She told
me that it's not just about looking
backwards. It's about the future."

Stanford is like now."
This year, a member of Wolfs
class came back to her first reunion
after 25 years.
"She left me a message telling me
how silly she'd been not to come to
any reunions before this one," Wolf
said. "She was so impressed. She told
me that it's not just about looking
backwards. It's about the future."
It was hard to miss the masses of
white and cardinal-clad alumni wan
dering through campus this weekend.
With an estimated 8,000 attendees, it
was the largest Reunion Homecom
ing to date, according to the director
of classes and reunions, Leslie
Winick.
"We had a 43 percent attendance
rate for the class of 2000, who are just
five years out, and we had a 44 per
cent attendance rate for the 50 year
reunion," Winick said. "That's pretty
exciting."
Of the 8,000 attendees, 5,500 were
alumni — representing approxi
mately 36 percent of the classes of
1940, 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965,
1970,1975,1980,1985,1990,1995 and
2000.
"People are always afraid that
they won't know anyone at their
college reunion," Winick said.
"Well, when almost half of each
class comes back, you're going to

know someone."
Winick and 11 other Stanford em
ployees along with 1,500 volunteers
worked year-round to organize the
426 events the weekend had in store.
"The big, core events are organ
ized by class," Winick explained.
"There's the class panel, where alum
ni share where they are in their lives
— their age and stage, as we put it.
Then there are the class reunion cele
brations. It's like organizing 13 wed
dings all for one night. For the foot
ball game, we have class tailgates and
then there are over 350 mini-re
unions for different student groups
on campus."
Other major events included a
welcome address by University Pres
ident John Hennessy in Memorial
Auditorium on Friday and the popu
lar "Classes Without Quizzes," in
which professors donated their time
to give lectures to the alumni on a
plethora of topics ranging from ethics
to international relations to modern

technology.
"There was an amazing amount
of academic programming provided
by the faculty, which was a tremen
dous draw," said Howard Wolf, pres
ident of the Alumni Association;
who graduated in 1980.
Of marked importance to some
was English Prof. Emeritus Ron
Rebholz's lecture, "Sex, Lies and
I"heater: Shakespeare for Today."
Rebholz has been teaching at Stan
ford since 1961, and many former
students were overjoyed by the op
portunity to learn from their old pro
fessor once again.
"He changed their lives and cre
ated an intellectual love of Shake
speare," Wolf said of Rebholz.
"These alumni were literally sitting
at the feet of the master. They
loved it."
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion was founded June 15. 1892, and
one of its first actions was to plan a
reunion lor the following year, ex
plained Wolf.'lbis year was the 113 th
reunion, and the tradition is still
going strong.
"The reunions give current stu
dents and young alumni a sense of
those who have come before them
and gives the members of the older
classes a sense of those who have fol
lowed after them," Winick said. "The
continuum is great to see. and it's a
huge part of why the University in
vests and dedicates so much time to
reunions."
Several alumni said they were ex
tremely pleased by the event.
"It's fantastic."said former Dollie
Loretta Churchill Montes, Class of
1975. "This reunion is extra special to
me because my son is here now, and
I just bumped into the daughter of a
friend of mine."
Others loved the opportunity to
share old memories. Jim Triolo, Class
of 1935, gave a speech on Sunday at
the very same podium where he
stood 70 years ago as the senior class
president.
"He led the Cardinal Society in
the Axe yell," Winick said. "And I
think he knows it better than most of
the current students."
After months of planning. Wolf
said he was extremely pleased with
the weekend.
"Our mission is to create lifelong
intellectual and emotional connec
tions between the University and its
graduates and between graduates
and other graduates," he said. "I
think we did a fantastic job."
Both Wolf and Winick empha
sized the role that current students
played in the reunion.
"When the alumni see the current
students, for example, at the a cap
pella show, they light up," Winick
said. "Ihey can't believe that the stu
dents are so talented. The main rea
son that they are here is to see each
other, but they love to see the stu
dents today.They want to know what
Stanford is like now."
