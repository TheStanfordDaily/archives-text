## THE 						BIG STORY Wilma picks up speed,heads for Florida 
### DAVID ROYSE ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) — Rain
pounded Key West early Monday as
Hurricane Wilma accelerated to
ward storm-weary Florida, threaten
ing residents with 115-mph winds,
tornadoes and a surge of seawater
that could flood the Keys and the
state's southwest coast.
The Category 3 hurricane was ex
pected to make landfall before dawn
in the state's southwest corner, like
ly near Naples and Marco Island,
National Hurricane Center Director
Max Mayfield said. He warned that
the storm surge in the area could
reach 14 to 19 feet.
Once ashore, the fastrmoving
hurricane was expected to slice
northeast across the state at up to 25
mph, with the Atlantic Coast likely
to get winds nearly as strong as those
hitting the Gulf Coast.
Tornadoes spun off ahead off
Wilma had already damaged a
restaurant in Cocoa Beach and an
orchid nursery on Merritt Island.
"I cannot emphasize enough to
the folks that live in the Florida
Keys: A hurricane is coming," Gov.
Jeb Bush told state residents Sunday
afternoon.
The entire southern Florida
peninsula has been under a hurri
cane warning since Saturday, and an
estimated 160,000 residents were
told to evacuate, but many in the
low-lying Keys island chain stayed.
"They're going to be in deep
trouble," warned Billy Wagner,
Monroe County emergency man
agement director.

Forecasters had been warning for
days of flooding from a storm surge
of up to 17 feet on the southwest
coast and 8 feet in the Keys, where
streets were already running with
water Sunday night.
Despite the repeated warnings,
fewer than 10 percent of the Keys'
78,000 residents evacuated, Monroe

County Sheriff Richard Roth said.
Wilma was Florida's eighth hurri
cane since August 2004 and the fourth
evacuation of the Keys this year.
The latest hurricane had already
proved it has damaging potential.
Wilma battered the Mexican coast
line with howling winds and torren
tial rains, killing at least three peo

pie. Thirteen others died in Jamaica
and Haiti, and four bodies were
found off Cozumel, though it wasn't
clear if they were killed by the storm.
In Florida, the National Guard
was on alert, and state and federal
officials had trucks of ice and food
ready to deploy. The Federal Emer
gency Management Agency was

poised to send in dozens of military
helicopters and 13.2 million ready
to-eat meals if needed.
Gov. Bush also wrote his brother,
President Bush, asking that Florida
be granted a major disaster declara
tion for 14 counties. Many of the
areas bracing for Wilma were hit by
hurricanes in the past two years.

0 Brazilians reject
proposed gun control law
in national referendum

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) — Brazilians
soundly rejected a proposal to ban the sale of guns
in a national referendum Sunday, striking down the
bid to stem one of the world's highest firearm mur
der rates following a campaign that drew parallels
to the U.S. gun control debate.
Brazil has 100 million fewer citizens than the
United States, but a staggering 25 percent more gun
deaths at nearly 40,000 a year. While supporters ar
gued that gun control was the best way to staunch
the violence, opponents played on Brazilians' fears
that the police can't protect them.
With more than 92 percent of the votes counted,
64 percent of Brazilians were opposed to the ban.

||1 Britain says flu strain that
p| killed parrot is deadly
I HSNI strain

LONDON (AP) — The British government said Sunday
that a strain of bird flu that killed a parrot in quarantine is the
deadly HSNI strain that has plagued Asia and recently spread
to Europe. Scientists determined that the parrot, imported
from South America, died of the strain of avian flu that has
devastated poultry stocks and killed 61 people in Asia the past
two years, according to the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs.
The virus is spread by migrating wild birds and has recent
ly been found in birds in Russia, TUrkey and Romania,
spurring efforts around the globe to contain its spread.
While HSNI is easily transmitted between birds, it is hard
for humans to contract. But experts fear it could mutate into a
form of flu that is easily transmitted between humans.
