## Om Padme MANI HUM Campus groups discuss their ties to Tibet and Buddhism 
### Ricardo Gilb CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While philosophies on impermanence are
central to Buddhism, Buddhist life at
Stanford is here to stay, as shown by the
packed-to-capacity room at a speech by Arjia Rin
poche, former Abbot of the Kumbum Monastery
in Tibet, on Oct. 12.
The event was hosted by a student group called
the Stanford Friends of Tibet as part of a lecture
series that will lead up to the visit of His Holiness
the Dalai Lama on Nov. 4.The crowd, consisting of
Stanford students and Palo Alto residents, seemed
entranced by the powerful simplicity of Rin
poche's words.
Also the founder of the Tibetan Center for
Compassion and Wisdom in Oakland — an or
ganization that works to increase understanding
in the West about Tibetan culture and Buddhism
— Rinpoche initially confessed that he had no
specific agenda for the speech, but eventually dis

cussed the basic tenets of Buddhism — imperma
nence, emptiness and interdependence.
Moriah Thomason, a neuroscience doctoral
student at Stanford who is helping to coordinate
the Dalai Lama's visit, says, "Buddhism offers a
suggested path, with pretty good ideas — it's open
to other religions and it's not afr-aid of science."
And Chenxing Han.a freshman,says that while
she didn't know what to expect of Rinpoche's
speech, she found it inspiring.
Stanford is home to a number of groups that
focus on Tibet, Buddhism or both.They participate
in and raise awareness about political movements,
community service and current academic initia
tives at Stanford related to Tibet and/or Buddhism.
So if you're excited that the Dalai Lama is com
ing to the Farm and are interested in learning
more about these issues, check out the following
campus organizations.

Stanford Friends of Tibet
"The purpose of the Stanford Friends of Tibet is to educate students
about issues relating to Tibet and to provide a way for students to get
involved, whether through Tibetan culture or with the human rights
movement "says senior Alissa Bernstein, president of the organization.
The group hosted Rinpoche's lecture as part of a series that has
touched upon topics such as human rights,Tibetan medicine, mediation
and impermanence.

Students for a Free Tibet
Junior Yangchen Chagzoetsang, a Tibetan American, is starting a Stan
ford chapter of the national organization Students for a Free Tibet.
This nation wide group "uses education and grassroots organiza
tion to promote political freedom and human rights in Tibet," Chag
zoetsang says. "They are one of the most active and effective groups at
mobilizing people and getting tangible results."
The organization, for example, has had much success publicizing
the cases of political prisoners, often leading to their release, accord
ing to Chagzoetsang.

The Chi Collegiate
Association
Another group with Buddhist connections, but not a
Buddhist organization per se, is the Tzu Chi Collegiate
Association.
"Although this organization was founded by a Bud
dhist nun, the ideals that she espoused are not limited to
any religion — to purify people's hearts, to harmonize
society and to pray for a world without disasters," says
Jennifer Hsiao, a recent Stanford graduate who was Tzu
Chi's president for two years.
Group members say they believe the influence of
Buddhist teachings is much wider than among only
those who call themselves Buddhists.
"I think people tend to join this group because it is
not limited to people who are Buddhist, and its primary
focus is on community service," Hsiao says. "I am non
religious myself, but I find the ideals of Master Chen Yen
[the founder] to be inspiring and worth pursuing...the
purpose [of Tzu Chi] is to go into the community and
make a difference and aspire to better humanity."

The World Peace Buddhists
Sophomore Tomell deSilva, current president of World Peace Bud
dhists, says the group exists "not only to provide the Stanford commu
nity with the Buddhist perspective of peace and happiness, but to also
empower and educate the community on non-violence and global is
sues."
Part of this effort is an upcoming event called "Victory Over Vio
lence: A Tribute to Mahatma Gandhi in a Changing World."The affair
will take place on Thursday, Oct. 27 at Tresidder Oak West from 7 to
8:30 p.m. and will feature music, dance and poetry performances. The
Hindu Student Council, the Martin Luther King's Paper Project and
the Bahai Community at Stanford will also have works on display
Among other groups,The World Peace Buddhists are sponsoring the
event with Soka Gakkai International-USA, an organization which is
based on the teachings of the Buddhist teacher Nichiren, according to
deSilva. These groups are affiliated with one another, he says.
"Some questions we ask ourselves are. 'What can we do for the
happiness of others? How can we build indestructible happiness in
our lives and in others?'" DeSilva adds.
DeSilva explains that the value of being a part of a Buddhist or
ganization is the support members receive.
"Joining the World Peace Buddhists means that you will not only
get the full support needed to practice this teaching correctly, but that
you will be able to gain encouragement from the other members as
you practice."

Buddhist Community at Stanford
The largest Buddhist organization on campus is the Buddhist Community at Stanford,or
BCAS."'The purpose of BCAS is to provide a time and a place for people interested in
Buddhism to practice, study or discuss," says co-president Jason Hopper, a senior.
"BCAS is an umbrella group for people of varying interests," Hopper says. "It is a
community that ought to reassure as well as challenge you to grow intellectually and be
come more humane. We try to provide a way for people at Stanford interested in Bud
dhism — regardless of whether thev consider themselves Buddhist — to do this," he adds.

Stanford Center for Buddhist Studies
According to its Web site, the Center "serves to coordinate, support and develop the Uni
versity's resources for Buddhist studies in four general areas: scholarly research, academic
communication, teaching and public outreach."
Carl Bielefeldt. professor of religious studies at Stanford and one of the co-directors of
SCBS,explains some of the difficulties of understanding a Buddhist community at Stanford.
"It's a little difficult to define," he says. "I suppose there are two types of people: Bud
dhists and Buddhist scholars and students.There also seem to be many people who are in
terested in the religion, and may even participate in Buddhist activities and practices, who
are neither members nor students of the religion."
SCBS itself is currently working to encourage the academic study of Buddhism through
efforts like the Asian Religions and Cultures initiative which aims to create a Tibetan Stud
ies program at Stanford.
