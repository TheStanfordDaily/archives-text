Know what to do with my life
At McMaster-Carr, many of our most successful managers had no idea what they wanted to do when
they graduated from college We're looking for passionate, articulate seniors who are ravenous learners,
gifted teachers, and who don't necessarily have a specific career in mind
McMaster-Carr is a privately held distribution company. That doesn't begin to describe the opportunities
we offer, or the experience of working here As a new hire, you will work in areas of the company
ranging from matketing to warehouse operations, with (people from backgrounds as diverse as
engineering, art history, and the military They all share exceptional intelligence, a natural curiosity, and
a love for what they do.
We promote an open, collegial environment - everyone is on a first name basis, there are virtually no
walled offices, and ideas are valued on their merit, not their source. We strongly believe in the 40-50
hour work week, and offer compensation in line with the salaries demanded by top candidates
Unlike many other "management" opportunities, at McMaster-Carr we believe that people who
demonstrate exceptional performance should be given exceptional responsibility at an early point in their
career We encourage people to aggressively pursue their own ideas, and believe that everyone should
have a lasting impact on our business
You don't need to know much of anything about management when you get here, but you do need to be
a fast, curious, and critical learner. Opportunities are available in each of our locations Email us at
