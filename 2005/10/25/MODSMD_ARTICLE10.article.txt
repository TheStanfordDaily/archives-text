## Web bargains for the whole bunch 
### 
They say you can find almost anything online.
While finding true love on the net may still
be in the realm of Hollywood fiction (espe
cially if you're looking for someone named Lafon
da — gosh!), for everything else, the Internet of
fers incredible selection at impossible-to-beat
prices. But to find the best deals on the Web, it
helps to know where to look.
In this first installment of a two-part series, we'll
tackle books and computer goods.
Everyone needs books. Amazon.com is still the
best place to browse books online. The site allows
you to look at scanned pages from within books,
read tables of contents and check reviews. But Ama
zon.com doesn't always have the lowest prices.
Brits Have Books Too
Prescription drugs are not the only items that
are cheaper abroad. If you're not in a hurry, pur
chasing textbooks from Canada and Britain can
save you a bundle. These respectable English
speaking countries subsidize their higher educa
tion system, thus driving down the price of text
books to an affordable level. (Note to Congress —
we should look into this).
Whereas my thermodynamic textbook is listed
for $98.12 on Amazon.com, it goes for 43.99 Great
British Pounds, or $77.72 U.S. dollars on
http://www.amazon.co.uk — same book, same
store, different country, $20 less!
Even after a 2 percent credit card currency con
version fee and a few extra dollars for shipping, I
still save $15. You may save even more on other
books. Use a free currency converter like
http://www.xe.com/ucc/ and check your book prices
at Amazon Canada — http:Z7www.amazon.ca —
and Amazon Britain — http://www.amazon.co.uk
— before you buy off Amazon in the U.S.
Meta-Search
There is nothing special about buying from
Amazon. If other book stores have the right book,
they will generally offer comparable service.
Mosey on over to http://www.PriceScan.com to
compare book prices and shipping costs across
hundreds of smaller online book sellers.
For used books, look at http://www.bookfind
er.com. Bookfinder crawls all of the major used
book sites and finds you the best bargain. Don't be
fooled by its austere user interface. Bookfinder
saves you a huge hassle by providing all the infor
mation you need to know on one page, including a
detailed description of a book's condition.
Save a Schlep
When it comes to finding computer goods, buy
ing online is the only way to go. Items like comput
er hardware or software rarely benefit from in
person physical inspection at the store. Rather,
purchasing computer hardware online offers a
wider selection than your local CompUSA or Cir
cuit City and saves you from schlepping a bulky
piece of equipment across town.
Start your search at
http://www.PriceGrabber.com. The site provides
an impressive array of tools for you to compare
product features and prices across different mer
chants. In an era where consumers are faced with a
daunting sea of nearly-identical products, Price-
Grabber helps cut through the fluff and allows you
to narrow down your search.
For example, if you are looking for one of those
spiffy new flat panel displays, don't wade through
1,200 different models. Limit your search by screen
size, manufacturer or resolution, and then sort
your results by user rating or popularity.
Price Grabber users tend to be reliable and
their comments are often useful. "Warning, this
monitor doesn't swivel, but otherwise it's great!"
says one user.
I also like Price Grabber's detailed spec sheets
and photos that are provided alongside each prod
uct listing.
Once you are ready to make a purchase, enter
your ZIP code and Price Grabber will compare the
total cost including shipping from different mer
chants. Be forewarned, if a merchant has a low rat
ing on Price Grabber, stay away — it's probably
worth heading elsewhere.
Fora little more work, you can find even bet
ter bargains at http://www.pricewatch.com. Price-
Watch is similar to Price Grabber, though not as
easy to use.
Cashing In on a Whim
For those of you who are feeling spontaneous,
check out special deals at http://www.newegg.com.
Each weekend. New Egg sells a hundred or so com
puting products at ridiculously low-priced deals. A
few weeks ago, a number of guys in my dorm pur
chased a $200 Samsung LaserJet printer — with
ink — for $80 after a $50 mail-in rebate.
That sale is long gone, but as of late, New Egg
has one gigabyte of RAM up for only $70 — about
half the usual price.
If you are willing to jump on a bargain, you can
upgrade your entire system fora few hundred dollars.
There is more to online bargains than just text
books and computer hardware. Next week, we will
look at where to find all of your wacky needs at on
line auction and community sites like Ebay and
Craigslist. Until then, happy surfing!

Everyone needs books. Amazon.com is still the
best place to browse books online. The site allows
you to look at scanned pages from within books,
read tables of contents and check reviews. But Ama
zon.com doesn't always have the lowest prices.
Brits Have Books Too
Prescription drugs are not the only items that
are cheaper abroad. If you're not in a hurry, pur
chasing textbooks from Canada and Britain can
save you a bundle. These respectable English
speaking countries subsidize their higher educa
tion system, thus driving down the price of text
books to an affordable level. (Note to Congress —
we should look into this).
Whereas my thermodynamic textbook is listed
for $98.12 on Amazon.com, it goes for 43.99 Great
British Pounds, or $77.72 U.S. dollars on
http://www.amazon.co.uk — same book, same
store, different country, $20 less!
Even after a 2 percent credit card currency con
version fee and a few extra dollars for shipping, I
still save $15. You may save even more on other
books. Use a free currency converter like
http://www.xe.com/ucc/ and check your book prices
at Amazon Canada — http:Z7www.amazon.ca —
and Amazon Britain — http://www.amazon.co.uk
— before you buy off Amazon in the U.S.
Meta-Search
There is nothing special about buying from
Amazon. If other book stores have the right book,
they will generally offer comparable service.
Mosey on over to http://www.PriceScan.com to
compare book prices and shipping costs across
hundreds of smaller online book sellers.
For used books, look at http://www.bookfind
er.com. Bookfinder crawls all of the major used
book sites and finds you the best bargain. Don't be
fooled by its austere user interface. Bookfinder
saves you a huge hassle by providing all the infor
mation you need to know on one page, including a
detailed description of a book's condition.
Save a Schlep
When it comes to finding computer goods, buy
ing online is the only way to go. Items like comput
er hardware or software rarely benefit from in
person physical inspection at the store. Rather,
purchasing computer hardware online offers a
wider selection than your local CompUSA or Cir
cuit City and saves you from schlepping a bulky
piece of equipment across town.
Start your search at
http://www.PriceGrabber.com. The site provides
an impressive array of tools for you to compare
product features and prices across different mer
chants. In an era where consumers are faced with a
daunting sea of nearly-identical products, Price-
Grabber helps cut through the fluff and allows you
to narrow down your search.
For example, if you are looking for one of those
spiffy new flat panel displays, don't wade through
1,200 different models. Limit your search by screen
size, manufacturer or resolution, and then sort
your results by user rating or popularity.
Price Grabber users tend to be reliable and
their comments are often useful. "Warning, this
monitor doesn't swivel, but otherwise it's great!"
says one user.
I also like Price Grabber's detailed spec sheets
and photos that are provided alongside each prod
uct listing.
Once you are ready to make a purchase, enter
your ZIP code and Price Grabber will compare the
total cost including shipping from different mer
chants. Be forewarned, if a merchant has a low rat
ing on Price Grabber, stay away — it's probably
worth heading elsewhere.
Fora little more work, you can find even bet
ter bargains at http://www.pricewatch.com. Price-
Watch is similar to Price Grabber, though not as
easy to use.
Cashing In on a Whim
For those of you who are feeling spontaneous,
check out special deals at http://www.newegg.com.
Each weekend. New Egg sells a hundred or so com
puting products at ridiculously low-priced deals. A
few weeks ago, a number of guys in my dorm pur
chased a $200 Samsung LaserJet printer — with
ink — for $80 after a $50 mail-in rebate.
That sale is long gone, but as of late, New Egg
has one gigabyte of RAM up for only $70 — about
half the usual price.
If you are willing to jump on a bargain, you can
upgrade your entire system fora few hundred dollars.
There is more to online bargains than just text
books and computer hardware. Next week, we will
look at where to find all of your wacky needs at on
line auction and community sites like Ebay and
Craigslist. Until then, happy surfing!
