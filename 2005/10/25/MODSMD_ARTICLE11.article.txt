Mention podcasting to anyone and Apple's sexy
lineup of iPods leaps to mind. Indeed, who could be
faulted for making such an association?

The term "podcasting" is a blend of the words
"iPod" and "broadcasting." The Internet broad
casting system makes its home on iTunes, the digi
tal jukebox program that is now credited with
bringing podcasting to the masses.
"Apple is taking Podcasting mainstream by
building it right into iTUnes," said Steve Jobs,
Apple's CEO, in a press release this summer."Pod
casting is the next generation of radio and users can
now subscribe to over 3,000 free Podcasts and have
each new episode automatically delivered over the
Internet to their computer and iPod."
Apple gave the phenomenon greater visibility
and made it easy to publish podcasts and listen to
them on the iPod when it added podcasting features
to its popular iTUnes music software in June 2005.
In its purest form, podcasting refers to the dis
tribution of "feeds" such as pre-recorded audio
and video clips via the Internet. Users can sub
scribe to feeds through their podcasting software,
also known as podcast aggregators. The aggrega
tors download the feeds automatically when they
are made available by their podcasters.
The origins of podcasting can be traced back to
collaboration efforts that have come to define the
Internet community. In response to customers' re
quests. User Land Software founder Dave Winer
made podcast aggregation technically possible in
2001 by including media support in the RSS spec
ifications.
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and
employs XML technology to enable the aggrega
tion of web content.
It didn't take long for members of the online
community to experiment with RSS' new features
by writing scripts to aggregate audio files.
The hassle of having to manually transfer each
of the early podcasts on the 2004 Llnited States
presidential campaigns inspired ex-broadcaster
Adam Curry to found Pod Show. a company that
seeks to improve podcasting, and to devise a script
that automates transfers of podcasts to his iPod.
Eventually, it spawned off several open-source
podcast aggregator development projects.
The advent of software that could handle pod
cast aggregation and transfers attracted more users
to podcasting. Web radios, personal blogs, tradi

tional broadcasters and even politicians started
making podcasts available on their Web sites. The
boom of portable digital music players presented
podcasters with a large and ever-growing audience.
With that, podcasting emerged from the indie
chrvsalis of Net culture. Today, one can find pod
casts on almost anything under the Sun. Feeling
poetic? Listen to live readings from famous poets
at miPOradio. Can't get enough of your favorite
Hollywood stars? Subscribe to KCRW's The
Treatment.Tired of mainstream music? Check out
The $250 Million Radio Show for plenty of hand
picked independent rock.
And that's just the tip of the podcasting iceberg.
One can also find podcasts on business, food, news,
politics, religion, technology and yes, even porn.
Looking to hop onto the podcasting bandwag
on but don't have an iPod or a portable music play
er? Fret not! All you need is a podcasting aggrega
tor and a computer that can play back existing
audio and video files.
Apart from iTUnes, other third-party podcast
aggregators such as Odeo's Sync or the open
source iPodder also work well.
If do-it-yourself podcasts are your cup of tea,
then you will need sound-recording software such
as Apple's Garageband or the Sound Recorder
that comes with Windows XP. Record your pod
cast and upload it to a server.
Complete the process by creating an RSS feed
containing the location of your podcast and sub
mit the RSS feed to any podcasting Web site. For
instance, illines allows podcasters to make their
podcast RSS feed available to other users via the
Music Store.
While senior Kevin Systrom has had limited ex
perience with publishing his own podcasts, he
questions the direction in which podcasting seems
to be headed.
"I find podcasting most effective and intriguing
when people sounded honest in front of the micro
phone," Systrom says. "Overly-produced and
sound-rich podcasts are simply missing the point."
He continues,"Podcasting just happens to be a
great medium for informal communication and
ad-hoc content recording. Think of it as democra
tizing of the media."
