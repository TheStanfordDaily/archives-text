# Vista takes a page out of Apple's book, awaits release
## 
### SAGAR BAPAT 
Despite hinting for years that it will re
lease a new operating system. Microsoft
has failed its aficionados once again by an
nouncing that the much-anticipated Win
dows Vista system will not be available
until Dec. 7,2(X)6. It was originally expect
ed to be released in 2003.
The launch was delayed due to a funda
mental change in Vista's purpose. While
Microsoft initially envisioned the new sys
tem as just a minor step between Windows
XP and Windows Blackcomb, the corpora
tion began integrating many of the new fea
tures and technologies from Blackcomb
into Vista, significantly slowing progress.
"The strength of Microsoft Windows is
the broad backing it has by the world's
best developers." said Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates at the company's Professional
Developers Conference (PDC) last
month. "This year. 2005, we are having a
record breaking PDC. where we are talk
ing about the next version of Windows,
Windows Vista!"
Vista boasts new features that parallel
many of those in Mac OS X. Microsoft has
dubbed these similar perks "The Pillars of
Vista."
One of the technologies — Authentic,
Energetic. Reflective and Open (AERO)
— will offer an improved, redesigned user
interface with new transparencies, anima
tions and other visual enhancements.
The aesthetic stylings of AERO resem
ble Mac OS X's Quartz Compositor, a
program that was released in 2001.
Vista will also include a souped-up
search engine that will instantly display
results. This tool will be a significant im

provcment over the current Windows XP
search engine, which can take up to sever
al minutes to display results.
Like Mac's Spotlight. Vista will also be
able to limit searches within specific appli
cations.
And according to Microsoft's Web site.
Vista will make it easier to sync with other
computers on the same network, allowing
for easier file sharing.
The release of Vista will spur a signifi
cant change in the residential computing

climate at Stanford. Surajit Bose, the clus
ter operations manager at Residential
Computing, says that campus computer
usage will adapt readily as the student
population switches to Vista.
"Students tend to be early adopters."
Bose says. " We anticipate that a significant
number of students will switch to Vista
within weeks of its release. Also, any stu
dent who purchases a new Windows com
puter after Dec. 7, 2006 will have Vista
pre-installed."

Bose adds that while individual stu
dents might upgrade to Vista quickly,
bringing the ResComp clusters up to
speed is a different story.
"With cluster computers, the picture is
far more complicated," he says.
Cluster computers rely on compatible
campus networking resources such as PC-
Leland, which supports AFS connectivity,
or Norton Antivirus. This keeps comput
ers secure. Cluster computers cannot up
grade their operating systems until Vista
compatible versions of this vital network
software are created.
In addition, software manufacturers
that provide applications on Windows
computers will need to upgrade their pro
grams to make them compatible with Vista.
"This isn't usually an issue with packages
popular with consumers, such as Photoshop
or Dreamweaver," Bose says. "But high
end academic packages can take longer."
Rescomp must also tackle security issues
when adopting a new operating system.
"Microsoft's track record of releasing
software that actually works is pretty dis
mal." Bose says. "Who knows? It might
take over a year just for them to have
enough service packs, patches and securi
ty updates out so that it is reasonably safe
to deploy Vista."
Stanford students hold various opin
ions about Vista's debut. Karl Plank, a
freshman, says he is not enthused.
"I will probably just buy a Mac," Plank
says, perhaps joining the growing ranks of
avid Apple users on campus.
Vlad Andrei, a freshman majoring in
management science and engineering, dis
agrees, saying he "would most definitely
buy the new Vista."

Rescomp must also tackle security issues
when adopting a new operating system.
"Microsoft's track record of releasing
software that actually works is pretty dis
mal." Bose says. "Who knows? It might
take over a year just for them to have
enough service packs, patches and securi
ty updates out so that it is reasonably safe
to deploy Vista."
Stanford students hold various opin
ions about Vista's debut. Karl Plank, a
freshman, says he is not enthused.
"I will probably just buy a Mac," Plank
says, perhaps joining the growing ranks of
avid Apple users on campus.
Vlad Andrei, a freshman majoring in
management science and engineering, dis
agrees, saying he "would most definitely
buy the new Vista."

The Windows Vista operating system has fallen victim to delays for the second year in a
row — this time fo integrate more features already found in Apple's OS X.
Despite hinting for years that it will re
lease a new operating system. Microsoft
has failed its aficionados once again by an
nouncing that the much-anticipated Win
dows Vista system will not be available
until Dec. 7,2(X)6. It was originally expect
ed to be released in 2003.
The launch was delayed due to a funda
mental change in Vista's purpose. While
Microsoft initially envisioned the new sys
tem as just a minor step between Windows
XP and Windows Blackcomb, the corpora
tion began integrating many of the new fea
tures and technologies from Blackcomb
into Vista, significantly slowing progress.
"The strength of Microsoft Windows is
the broad backing it has by the world's
best developers." said Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates at the company's Professional
Developers Conference (PDC) last
month. "This year. 2005, we are having a
record breaking PDC. where we are talk
ing about the next version of Windows,
Windows Vista!"
Vista boasts new features that parallel
many of those in Mac OS X. Microsoft has
dubbed these similar perks "The Pillars of
Vista."
One of the technologies — Authentic,
Energetic. Reflective and Open (AERO)
— will offer an improved, redesigned user
interface with new transparencies, anima
tions and other visual enhancements.
The aesthetic stylings of AERO resem
ble Mac OS X's Quartz Compositor, a
program that was released in 2001.
Vista will also include a souped-up
search engine that will instantly display
results. This tool will be a significant im

provcment over the current Windows XP
search engine, which can take up to sever
al minutes to display results.
Like Mac's Spotlight. Vista will also be
able to limit searches within specific appli
cations.
And according to Microsoft's Web site.
Vista will make it easier to sync with other
computers on the same network, allowing
for easier file sharing.
The release of Vista will spur a signifi
cant change in the residential computing

climate at Stanford. Surajit Bose, the clus
ter operations manager at Residential
Computing, says that campus computer
usage will adapt readily as the student
population switches to Vista.
"Students tend to be early adopters."
Bose says. " We anticipate that a significant
number of students will switch to Vista
within weeks of its release. Also, any stu
dent who purchases a new Windows com
puter after Dec. 7, 2006 will have Vista
pre-installed."

Bose adds that while individual stu
dents might upgrade to Vista quickly,
bringing the ResComp clusters up to
speed is a different story.
"With cluster computers, the picture is
far more complicated," he says.
Cluster computers rely on compatible
campus networking resources such as PC-
Leland, which supports AFS connectivity,
or Norton Antivirus. This keeps comput
ers secure. Cluster computers cannot up
grade their operating systems until Vista
compatible versions of this vital network
software are created.
In addition, software manufacturers
that provide applications on Windows
computers will need to upgrade their pro
grams to make them compatible with Vista.
"This isn't usually an issue with packages
popular with consumers, such as Photoshop
or Dreamweaver," Bose says. "But high
end academic packages can take longer."
Rescomp must also tackle security issues
when adopting a new operating system.
"Microsoft's track record of releasing
software that actually works is pretty dis

take over a year just for them to have
enough service packs, patches and securi
ty updates out so that it is reasonably safe
