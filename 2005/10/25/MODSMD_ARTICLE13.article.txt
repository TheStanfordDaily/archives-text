## Editorials Administrators messed up planning process 
### 
President John Hennessy's choice fora
new Commencement location was
wrong. He has a misinformed view of
graduation if he thinks that aesthetics, cost
and history are more important than the
families of graduating students. It's our grad
uation, not his.
Either of two alternatives with larger ca
pacities should have been chosen over Frost
Amphitheater. Roble Field (which would
have allowed for seven tickets per student)
or Sand Hill Field should have been selected
regardless of cost and logistics.
We believe that Hennessy made his deci
sion with students as the front top priority.
Clearly, the University wants students and
families to be happy about Commencement,
and we don't doubt the motives of the presi
dent or any of his advisers.
Still, some aspects of this process weren't
thought through. Requiring tickets for the
simulcast is silly and excessive, and bringing
students into the process so late — no mat
ter the motives — demonstrates a lack of
consideration. This is not some grand plan
for the future. It is and should only be about
the Class of 2006.
Once again, this is an issue where more
student input should have been solicited.
Consulting the whole senior class would
have been impractical, but the class presi
dents were the right people to represent
student voices. ITie senior class presidents
arc not blameless and probably could have
taken a more active role in making their
voices heard, but Senior Assistant to the
President Jeff Wachtel and other Universi
ty planners should have brought them into
the process much earlier — definitely
more than a few days before a decision was
made.
We would like to remind University ad
ministrators that student input is not:
• Soliciting opinions after things have
been decided.
• Meeting with class presidents one week

before the end of a process of many
months.
• Adding improvements to other aspects
of graduation without a solid time or
monetary commitment.
• Thinking that since the uninformed
Daily editorial board agreed with your
preordained ideas, you had enough stu
dent input.
Our editorial of Oct. 13 ("Suggestions
and guidelines for Commencement 2006")
was not meant to be cover for I lennessy to
exclude student input. Instead, it was meant
to explain, both to the administration and
students, that there might be more construc
tive ways to approach a bad situation —
where Commencement would not be in any
venue as large as the stadium.
We wrote our editorial with the under
standing that Frost was the leading candidate
and that it had equivalent or larger capacity
than any of the other venues under consider
ation. We thought this because we were kept
in the dark — as was the whole student body
and, evidently, the senior class presidents as
well. Now that we know that there were bet
ter choices, our opinion has changed.
Despite our disappointment and the
overwhelming opinion of the senior class, we
feel that we can salvage a constructive dia
logue about Commencement. The adminis
tration must make its reasoning more clear.
The senior class presidents should realize
that a large part of their job is to work with
administrators, building trust so that they
can effectively advocate on behalf of their
peers. Their current outrage is justified, but
they and the whole senior class should chan
nel this frustration into taking control of
graduation and making it definitively theirs.
Take charge of the Wacky Walk. Get a
better speaker. Plan more events for whole
families. And don't wait for others to do this
and whine when it doesn't happen. Seniors,
put your outrage into action.
