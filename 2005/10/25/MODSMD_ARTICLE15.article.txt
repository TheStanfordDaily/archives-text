# Frost is an unacceptable ceremony location
## 
### DAVID LOUK 
President John Hennessy's choice of
Commencement location is more than
wrong — it is unacceptable and should
be immediately rectified.
The Class of 2(KK> will walk away as the
first class in more than 20 years to have a lim
ited number of family members able to at
tend Commencement. From the day these
students first came to campus, they and their
families had every reason to assume they
could invite as many family members as they
wanted to their graduation ceremonies.
Many students' parents, grandparents,
aunts, uncles and cousins have already made
plans and booked nonrefundable plane tick
ets under the well-established assumption
that all were welcome to attend Commence
ment. Some family members will have to pay
out of pocket to cancel these reservations
and will feel slighted in the process.
This issue is particularly hard-felt for stu
dents who are the first to graduate college in
their immediate or extended families. It is
appalling that the family members who have
labored for years to create the opportunity
of a world-class education for their children,
grandchildren, nieces or nephews may have
to watch the realization of their efforts on a
Jumbotron or, worse, not at all.
All students will undergo the unfair and
uncomfortable experience of deciding which
family members will be among the "chosen
four" allowed in Frost Amphitheater to wit
ness their Commencement.This is an unnec
essary and emotionally stressful process for
many students and their families, which may
result in some family members choosing not
to come.

Many such families have few opportuni
ties to experience the splendor of this cam
pus. Along with Orientation, Commence
ment is one of the only times Stanford has
to impress these potential contributors. It
seems short-sighted on the part of the Uni
versity to leave a bitter taste in the mouths
of future alumni as well as their families —
a large group of potentially lucrative
donors.
ITie location of Frost Amphitheater for
Commencement is not set in stone, and the
University, along with the senior class presi
dents, should strongly investigate and pur
sue alternative locations. Some locations on
campus, such as the field at Sand Hill Road,
can accommodate a significantly greater
number of guests.
Unless a new location is found, members
of the Class of 2(KK> would be well within
their rights to reconsider donating to the Se
nior Gift Campaign. It speaks to the level of
outrage among students that the floated idea
of using the Senior Gift to fund a more ac
commodating Commencement location is
considered not as a joke, but as a compelling
use of funds.
Last month. Hennessy wrote to the par
ents of senior class members to encourage
them to prepare for Commencement, "the
highlight of the year." Unfortunately, Com
mencement has quickly become seniors'
headache of the year. Hennessy closed the
letter by saying, "I look forward to celebrat
ing Commencement with you in June." For
many family members, as of now, this simply
will not be the case.
