# Corporate life is my personal Hell
## 
### 
This summer I worked for IBM.a.k.a. Big
Blue.They're proud that their nickname
reflects the things the company stands
for — Stodginess! Ihe 19505! Corporatism! It
was awful.
My welcome packet from IBM said,"lt's a
lighter shade of blue." Which was true, provid
ed the original blue was so dark as to be black.
IBM boasted that they no longer have a dress
code. Which is also true. Ihe most restrictive
part of the dress code was "No ripped jeans."
But you got the sense that everyone would re
ally appreciate it if you at least wore a collared
shirt.
I compared my working environment to
being trapped on an airplane for nine hours
every day. My boss corrected me — "Airplanes
have windows.' Ihere was never enough air cir
culating in the office, and come 2 p.m., I would
become completely delirious — my depth per
ception would start to go and I'd lose any abili
ty to focus for more than five minutes.
We worked in four-person full-height cubes.
So that we didn't feel like we were trapped in
small boxes, the ceilings in the room were in
credibly high. This led to the interesting effect
wherein sound from other cubes would bounce
off the ceilings and then settle in our cube fora
while in an effort to slowly drive us insane.
If you are ever presented with the choice,
pick half-height cubes over lull-height cubes.
Half-height cubes guarantee you will never
ever be able to concentrate because you can see
and hear every bit of activity on the entire floor.
However, in all likelihood, vou will have view of

a window. It won't be your window, but that
doesn't matter. Not seeing the outside world is
a shockingly dehumanizing experience.
I watched "Office Space" with a friend this
summer and for the first time understood why
it was funny. I also finally understood why my
mother can't read Dilbert — it hits too close to
home.
My days were taken up by meetings, which
are amazing things if you don't want to get any
work done. It's well understood that any time
you have fewer than 30 minutes between meet
ings, or between a meeting and a meal, no work
will get done. Bosses respect this fact. You can't
bill for your lunch hour, but you can bill for the
20 minutes you spend debating where to go.
During these meetings, corporate drones
would show up to tell us about "core values."
The core values of every company are the
same:'lUrn a profit and don't get sued. I never
understood why they felt it was so important to
tell us this on a daily basis.
Of course these meetings involved copious
amounts of PowerPoint slides (allied a deck in
corporatespeak). Because PowerPoint is so im

portant in corporateland. we interns had to
spend our entire summer iterating a four
minute PowerPoint pitch of our project.
I discovered there are only two ways to use
PowerPoint, both of which are completely inef
fective. The first approach is to have your slides
spell out all your talking points, which means
that your audience reads the points before you
can explain them and then stops listening until
the next slide transition. Presenters don't know
their own talking points,so they need to stop for
each slide transition and read the slide along
with the audience, guaranteeing that they will
never speak engagingly for more than b() sec
onds at a stretch. Tirying to fix this results in the
second method, in which the slides have ab
solutely nothing to do with what's being said.
The words give way to animations and pictures
that make perfect sense to the presenter but do
nothing but confuse the audience, which conse
quently ignores the presenter entirely.
I couldn't imagine doing this for the rest of
my life — trapped in a windowless cube, work
ing fora company with more self-loathing than
a Jewish Nazi and more makeovers than J-Lo. I
wanted to do work that other people would
think was cool, and working deep within the
bowels of IBM Research was not going to
make me happy.
Every time the internship coordinator
asked me what I wanted to do after college, I
told him, "Move to Spain and sell coffee." By
the end of the summer I couldn't tell if I was

joking or not.
Ibis led to my resolution not to
take a corporate job right out of
school. It clearly won't make me
happy and I know that if I take a near
six-figure job next year, I'll never want
to take a 50 percent pay cut. I'll start
acquiring things. Grown-up Things —
couches and cutlery and books that
will make it very hard to up and quit.
It's hard to see myself moving to
Kansas just to see what its like when
I've got an apartment of stuff I like
verv much in Mountain View. Ihese

are the years when it's OK to be irre
sponsible in the ways I never was as an
Ivy-bound youth. 1 grew up too fast
anyway — my parents used to de
scribe me as "13 going on 30." I'm try
ing my hardest to regress. Either I
screw up now or never again.
Then what the hell was I doing in a
polo shirt and slacks at the career fair
two weeks ago? And why was I inex
plicably drawn to giving my resume to
companies I knew I didn't want to
work for — Microsoft, Google,
Nvidia? Search me. I think it has to do
with leftover neuroses from the col
lege application process. All my
friends are taking (or at least pursu
ing) these early-decision job offers —
and if I was accepted early to Stan
ford, I ought to be able to get in early

at Google.They'll hire anyone!
Since I was early decision here, I
never got the satisfaction of getting a
Harvard acceptance letter and turn
ing it down. I'm trying to make up for
lost time.
So what am I going to do instead?
Stay tuned for next week, when I re
view in great detail my possible plans
for the future and let my readers vote
on it.

view in great detail my possible plans
for the future and let my readers vote
on it.

David Blackman hopes that the Com
mencement ticket debacle will lead to
many situations as endearing as the last
episode of "The Cosby Show," in which
Theo is only allocated two tickets but

This summer I worked for IBM.a.k.a. Big
Blue.They're proud that their nickname
reflects the things the company stands
for — Stodginess! Ihe 19505! Corporatism! It
was awful.
My welcome packet from IBM said,"lt's a
lighter shade of blue." Which was true, provid
ed the original blue was so dark as to be black.
IBM boasted that they no longer have a dress
code. Which is also true. Ihe most restrictive
part of the dress code was "No ripped jeans."
But you got the sense that everyone would re
ally appreciate it if you at least wore a collared
shirt.
I compared my working environment to
being trapped on an airplane for nine hours
every day. My boss corrected me — "Airplanes
have windows.' Ihere was never enough air cir
culating in the office, and come 2 p.m., I would
become completely delirious — my depth per
ception would start to go and I'd lose any abili
ty to focus for more than five minutes.
We worked in four-person full-height cubes.
So that we didn't feel like we were trapped in
small boxes, the ceilings in the room were in
credibly high. This led to the interesting effect
wherein sound from other cubes would bounce
off the ceilings and then settle in our cube fora
while in an effort to slowly drive us insane.
If you are ever presented with the choice,
pick half-height cubes over lull-height cubes.
Half-height cubes guarantee you will never
ever be able to concentrate because you can see
and hear every bit of activity on the entire floor.
However, in all likelihood, vou will have view of

a window. It won't be your window, but that
doesn't matter. Not seeing the outside world is
a shockingly dehumanizing experience.
I watched "Office Space" with a friend this
summer and for the first time understood why
it was funny. I also finally understood why my
mother can't read Dilbert — it hits too close to
home.
My days were taken up by meetings, which
are amazing things if you don't want to get any
work done. It's well understood that any time
you have fewer than 30 minutes between meet
ings, or between a meeting and a meal, no work
will get done. Bosses respect this fact. You can't
bill for your lunch hour, but you can bill for the
20 minutes you spend debating where to go.
During these meetings, corporate drones
would show up to tell us about "core values."
The core values of every company are the
same:'lUrn a profit and don't get sued. I never
understood why they felt it was so important to
tell us this on a daily basis.
Of course these meetings involved copious
amounts of PowerPoint slides (allied a deck in
corporatespeak). Because PowerPoint is so im

portant in corporateland. we interns had to
spend our entire summer iterating a four
minute PowerPoint pitch of our project.
I discovered there are only two ways to use
PowerPoint, both of which are completely inef
fective. The first approach is to have your slides
spell out all your talking points, which means
that your audience reads the points before you
can explain them and then stops listening until
the next slide transition. Presenters don't know
their own talking points,so they need to stop for
each slide transition and read the slide along
with the audience, guaranteeing that they will
never speak engagingly for more than b() sec
onds at a stretch. Tirying to fix this results in the
second method, in which the slides have ab
solutely nothing to do with what's being said.
The words give way to animations and pictures
that make perfect sense to the presenter but do
nothing but confuse the audience, which conse
quently ignores the presenter entirely.
I couldn't imagine doing this for the rest of
my life — trapped in a windowless cube, work
ing fora company with more self-loathing than
a Jewish Nazi and more makeovers than J-Lo. I
wanted to do work that other people would
think was cool, and working deep within the
bowels of IBM Research was not going to
make me happy.
Every time the internship coordinator
asked me what I wanted to do after college, I
told him, "Move to Spain and sell coffee." By
the end of the summer I couldn't tell if I was

joking or not.
Ibis led to my resolution not to
take a corporate job right out of
school. It clearly won't make me
happy and I know that if I take a near
six-figure job next year, I'll never want
to take a 50 percent pay cut. I'll start
acquiring things. Grown-up Things —
couches and cutlery and books that
will make it very hard to up and quit.
It's hard to see myself moving to
Kansas just to see what its like when
I've got an apartment of stuff I like
verv much in Mountain View. Ihese

are the years when it's OK to be irre
sponsible in the ways I never was as an
Ivy-bound youth. 1 grew up too fast
anyway — my parents used to de
scribe me as "13 going on 30." I'm try
ing my hardest to regress. Either I
screw up now or never again.
Then what the hell was I doing in a
polo shirt and slacks at the career fair
two weeks ago? And why was I inex
plicably drawn to giving my resume to
companies I knew I didn't want to
work for — Microsoft, Google,
Nvidia? Search me. I think it has to do
with leftover neuroses from the col
lege application process. All my
friends are taking (or at least pursu
ing) these early-decision job offers —
and if I was accepted early to Stan
ford, I ought to be able to get in early

at Google.They'll hire anyone!
Since I was early decision here, I
never got the satisfaction of getting a
Harvard acceptance letter and turn
ing it down. I'm trying to make up for
lost time.
So what am I going to do instead?
Stay tuned for next week, when I re
view in great detail my possible plans
for the future and let my readers vote
