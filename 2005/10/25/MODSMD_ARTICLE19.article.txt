# I heart the dining hall
## 
### 
Do you remember what you ate today?
How about yesterday? Ibe day be
fore? I do. My lunch today consisted of
a turkey sandwich, steamed broccoli, roasted
peppers and ice cream for dessert.
I know this because it was the same thing I
ate yesterday, the same thing I'll eat tomorrow
and the same thing I'll eat on March 19. If I'm
feeling especially daring, I might swap out my
turkey sandwich fora slice of pizza, but gener
ally my food selection does not vary.
Ah,consistency. It's a quality women yearn
for in a man — but when it comes to food we
crave excitement and variety. (Notice that the
guys are never the ones who complain about
the food. I hey're happy eating pizza at every
meal).
Not to stereotype — I know plenty of
women who are perfectly happy eating the
same thing every day. As long as we have ice
cream. Can't forget the ice cream.
Nevertheless, it gets old after a while. (Ex
cept the ice cream, which can never get old. as
long as there are plenty of Oreo cookies to go
around).
I like to blame my epicurean monotony on
my dining hall's narrow selection but I know
that the responsibility is all mine. As they say,
you can take a girl to dinner, but you can't
order for her.
Any rational person is probably thinking,
well, if you're so sick of your dining hall, why
don't you mix it up and go somewhere else?

And I suppose I could; every day my dorm
mates and I- talk about visiting the other dining
halls on campus, but when dinnertime rolls
around, we're either too hungry or too lazy
(usually both) to make the five-minute trek
over toTVesidder or another dining hall.
And then, once we're sitting around the
table, we whine about how we should have
gone somewhere else. (Exceptions to this rule
occur, of course, when they're serving choco
late fondue or grilled-cheese sandwiches).
In actuality, none of the food is really that
bad, but complaining about the dining hall is a
bonding ritual that connects all the members
of a dorm in a special way. And regardless of
which dining hall you call home, you will com
plain about it eventually.
It's just like complaining about your mom's
cooking. You crave her home-cooked meals
despite her rare off-days in the kitchen. Be
cause, no matter how many times she burns her
meatloaf or makes that gross tuna casserole,
you would be lost without her.

The dining hall is like our mom (or dad, if
he's the family chef) away from home. It makes
us sit and eat as a family,giving us a break from
our hectic lives. Grabbing a sandwich from
Subway and scarfing it down between classes is
nowhere near as fulfilling as sitting down fora
leisurely lunch with your dormmates. 1 make
time for meals even when I have a huge
midterm the next day or a paper due on a book
that I haven't even started reading. Partly be
cause eating is more fun than writing a paper.
But also because it's a great way to spend time
with people.
There are no cliques in the dining hall like
there are in a high school cafeteria. Everybody
is free to sit at whichever table they choose —
to mingle, to laugh and to get to know each
other. It's like a cocktail party,except we've re
placed the drinks and cute dresses with pizza
and cafeteria trays.
Even if we run out of pseudo-intellectual
things to say to each other, we can always re
sort to the one thing we are all good at: com
plaining about the food, a practice that has fos
tered many a friendship .The dining hall has be
come our willing scapegoat by establishing this
common ground for us, and that is why we love
it so much.
That and the ice cream.

Do you remember what you ate today?
How about yesterday? Ibe day be
fore? I do. My lunch today consisted of
a turkey sandwich, steamed broccoli, roasted
peppers and ice cream for dessert.
I know this because it was the same thing I
ate yesterday, the same thing I'll eat tomorrow
and the same thing I'll eat on March 19. If I'm
feeling especially daring, I might swap out my
turkey sandwich fora slice of pizza, but gener
ally my food selection does not vary.
Ah,consistency. It's a quality women yearn
for in a man — but when it comes to food we
crave excitement and variety. (Notice that the
guys are never the ones who complain about
the food. I hey're happy eating pizza at every
meal).
Not to stereotype — I know plenty of
women who are perfectly happy eating the
same thing every day. As long as we have ice
cream. Can't forget the ice cream.
Nevertheless, it gets old after a while. (Ex
cept the ice cream, which can never get old. as
long as there are plenty of Oreo cookies to go
around).
I like to blame my epicurean monotony on
my dining hall's narrow selection but I know
that the responsibility is all mine. As they say,
you can take a girl to dinner, but you can't
order for her.
Any rational person is probably thinking,
well, if you're so sick of your dining hall, why
don't you mix it up and go somewhere else?

And I suppose I could; every day my dorm
mates and I- talk about visiting the other dining
halls on campus, but when dinnertime rolls
around, we're either too hungry or too lazy
(usually both) to make the five-minute trek
over toTVesidder or another dining hall.
And then, once we're sitting around the
table, we whine about how we should have
gone somewhere else. (Exceptions to this rule
occur, of course, when they're serving choco
late fondue or grilled-cheese sandwiches).
In actuality, none of the food is really that
bad, but complaining about the dining hall is a
bonding ritual that connects all the members
of a dorm in a special way. And regardless of
which dining hall you call home, you will com
plain about it eventually.
It's just like complaining about your mom's
cooking. You crave her home-cooked meals
despite her rare off-days in the kitchen. Be
cause, no matter how many times she burns her
meatloaf or makes that gross tuna casserole,
you would be lost without her.

The dining hall is like our mom (or dad, if
he's the family chef) away from home. It makes
us sit and eat as a family,giving us a break from
our hectic lives. Grabbing a sandwich from
Subway and scarfing it down between classes is
nowhere near as fulfilling as sitting down fora
leisurely lunch with your dormmates. 1 make
time for meals even when I have a huge
midterm the next day or a paper due on a book
that I haven't even started reading. Partly be
cause eating is more fun than writing a paper.
But also because it's a great way to spend time
with people.
There are no cliques in the dining hall like
there are in a high school cafeteria. Everybody
is free to sit at whichever table they choose —
to mingle, to laugh and to get to know each
other. It's like a cocktail party,except we've re
placed the drinks and cute dresses with pizza
and cafeteria trays.
Even if we run out of pseudo-intellectual
things to say to each other, we can always re
sort to the one thing we are all good at: com
plaining about the food, a practice that has fos
tered many a friendship .The dining hall has be
come our willing scapegoat by establishing this
common ground for us, and that is why we love
it so much.
That and the ice cream.
