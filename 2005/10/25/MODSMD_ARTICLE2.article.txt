# Scandal Amid Service
## Wilson speaks about career in foreign service and current scandal 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
The man at the center of a massive
political scandal that threatens senior
members of the Bush administration
with criminal charges spoke to a ca
pacity crowd at Kresge Auditorium
last night. Ambassador Joseph Wil
son, whose wife's identity as a covert
agent was allegedly leaked to the
media by senior Bush officials, spoke
to students about the potential indict
ments of administration members, his
thoughts on America's role in Iraq
and his background in public service.
Wilson drew gasps from the crowd
when he revealed that today's New
York Times will implicate Vice Presi
dent Dick Cheney as a source ofc the
smear campaign that he says ruined
his wife's career.
"Tomorrow's New York Times will
say that Dick Cheney told Scooter
Libby the name of my wife," Wilson
said to raging applause from a sur
prised audience.
A copy of the Times article reports
that "notes of the previously undis
closed conversation between [the
Vice President's Chief of Staff I.
Lewis Libby Jr.) and Cheney on June
12, 2(X)3, appear to differ from Mr.
Libby's testimony to a federal grand
jury that he initially learned about the
CIA officer Valerie Wilson from jour
nalists, the lawyers said."
The potential implication for
Libby could be perjury charges as
early as today from an independent
counsel led by U.S. Attorney Patrick
Fitzgerald, who has conducted an ex
tensive investigation for two years.
The grand jury he paneled to make in
dictments for any criminal wrongdo
ing expires Friday, causing many ana
lysts to anticipate charges by the end
of the week.
"We had no idea how fortunate
our timing would be at his arrival,"
ASSU Speakers' Bureau Director
Adam Kahn, a co-terminal student in
Media Studies, said of Wilson's visit
this week. Admitting that he hoped in
dictments would be handed down the
day of the speech, Kahn said, "I was
very glad we chose him as a speaker."
