# Scandal Amid Service
## Wilson speaks about career in foreign service and current scandal 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
The man at the center of a massive
political scandal that threatens senior
members of the Bush administration
with criminal charges spoke to a ca
pacity crowd at Kresge Auditorium
last night. Ambassador Joseph Wil
son, whose wife's identity as a covert
agent was allegedly leaked to the
media by senior Bush officials, spoke
to students about the potential indict
ments of administration members, his
thoughts on America's role in Iraq
and his background in public service.
Wilson drew gasps from the crowd
when he revealed that today's New
York Times will implicate Vice Presi
dent Dick Cheney as a source ofc the
smear campaign that he says ruined
his wife's career.
"Tomorrow's New York Times will
say that Dick Cheney told Scooter
Libby the name of my wife," Wilson
said to raging applause from a sur
prised audience.
A copy of the Times article reports
that "notes of the previously undis
closed conversation between [the
Vice President's Chief of Staff I.
Lewis Libby Jr.) and Cheney on June
12, 2(X)3, appear to differ from Mr.
Libby's testimony to a federal grand
jury that he initially learned about the
CIA officer Valerie Wilson from jour
nalists, the lawyers said."
The potential implication for
Libby could be perjury charges as
early as today from an independent
counsel led by U.S. Attorney Patrick
Fitzgerald, who has conducted an ex
tensive investigation for two years.
The grand jury he paneled to make in
dictments for any criminal wrongdo
ing expires Friday, causing many ana
lysts to anticipate charges by the end
of the week.
"We had no idea how fortunate
our timing would be at his arrival,"
ASSU Speakers' Bureau Director
Adam Kahn, a co-terminal student in
Media Studies, said of Wilson's visit
this week. Admitting that he hoped in
dictments would be handed down the
day of the speech, Kahn said, "I was
very glad we chose him as a speaker."

Ambassador Joseph Wilson addresses students last night at Kresge Auditorium Wilson is in
volved in the controversy surrounding the Bush administration's outing of his wife as a spy.
Ambassador talks on CIA leak

The controversial figure provided
a background narrative on the leak
case that has been consuming the
news in recent weeks. He walked the
audience chronologically through his
version of events beginning with his
return from retirement to investigate
claims of uranium in Niger to what he
calls a "deliberate effort to smear" his
reputation after publishing an opin
ion piece in July 2003 that was critical
of the administration.
The former Iraqi ambassador
spoke in depth about his background
in the region. He highlighted his per
sonal involvement in Iraq during the
run-up to the first Gulf War and his
time as a senior official in the State
Department and National Security
Council under President Bill Clinton.
Wilson said he was contacted by
the Central Intelligence Agency to
follow-up on reports claiming Niger
ian and Iraqi emissaries had met to
discuss the sale of yellowcake urani
um because of his superior creden
tials and contacts in the region. He
says he definitively reported back to
his CIA handlers when he returned
that the rumors were false.
He believes that the White House
ignored his report when Bush said in
his 2003 State of the Union that Iraq
had tried to buy uranium from Niger.
Wilson attacked the administration
for stretching and distorting this and
other evidence to make the case fora
war he says they wanted all along.
"This administration betrayed the
vote of confidence the American peo
ple gave it after September 11," he
said of the decision to invade Iraq.
"From March to early July 2004,1
did everything I could to get the gov
ernment to set the record straight,"
Wilson explained. "When they would
not set the record straight, I did. This
White House operates with a take
no-prisoners approach so they decid
ed they would take me down. They
have never ceased to impugn me and
attack my wife's credibility"
Significant portions of the series of
events as he retold them are strongly
disputed by journalists and officials
familiar with the situation. Senior
writer for U.S. News & World Report
Michael Barone calls Wilson a liar in
an article published yesterday.
Wilson dismissed these criticisms
as nothing more than "the last throes
of a desperate administration." More
over. he criticized the reference to the
Senate Intelligence Committee re
port, arguing that it w;>s compiled by
Republicans on the committee in col
lusion with Bush administration offi
cials.
"What I did was not a great act of
courage, but an act of civic dutv. This

issue is not about us, but our country."
Wilson said. "What will we tolerate
from our elected officials? This case is
about a citizen's right to redress a
grievance. National security issues are
not Republican or Democratic issues;
they are American issues. Atomic
bombs in Palo Alto or Menlo Park are
not only going to affect Democrats or
Republicans, but Americans."
While Wilson might not fashion
himself as particularly courageous,
some in the audience saw him as an
iconic hero in a struggle against a gov
ernment they believe has abused
power.
"He is an American hero, and I
support him and his struggle with this
administration. It's all about getting
this administration to tell the truth,"
said Peter Moskowitz, a faculty mem
ber at the School of Medicine.
In an interview with The Daily
after the speech, Wilson said he had
not been called before the grand jury
investigating the leak but that he had
spoken with the special prosecutor
several times — not under oath. He
refused to comment on whether or to
what extent his wife had cooperated
with the special counsel.
"The CIA would not have arbi
trarily referred this case to the De
partment of Justice had there not
been a belief that laws had been vio
lated." Wilson said.
1 le declined to speculate on what
the special prosecutor might do. Wil
son believes that Fitzgerald is fair, and
he plans to defer to his findings.
"Hopefully justice will be done,"
the husband said of his wife's case. "I
don't believe there should be any
place at the senior reaches of our gov
ernment for people of scrupulous
character."
Wilson went on an offensive
against the administration and its
conservative allies throughout his
nearly two-hour presentation.
"This administration is genetically
incapable of handling Iraq right until
you get rid of some of the people
around the president," he said, liken
ing what has come to be known as the
Plame Affair to the Iran-Contra scan
dal of the second Reagan administra
tion.
Calling these "troubling times,"
Wilson asserted that zealots control
the Republican Party. He called I.
Scooter Libby "too cowardly to step
forward." He called conservative
commentator Robert Novak "a pawn
in someone else's game" and used the
name of a woman's hygiene product
in reference to the 73-year-old writer.
Wilson also called out House Home
land Security Committee Chair Peter
King as a "prick" who was willing to

"whore" himself to get key committee
appointments.
Wilson spent much of his talk at
tacking what he sees as a radical neo
conservative agenda controlling the
reconstruction of Iraq. Citing a New
America Century report on how the
United States could become a suc
cessful empire, the man George Her
bert Walker Bush once called a "true
American hero" labeled the current
president and much of his inner circle
as "delusional Utopians."
"We are taking sides in a civil war,"
the former Iraqi head of station ar
gued while painting a bleak picture of
the situation in Iraq.
"Despite the passage of the Con
stitution," Wilson said, referring to
last week's successful national refer
endum on the Iraqi Constitution,"it is
little more than a peace agreement
between the Shiites and the Kurds at
the expense of the Sunnis. It will insti
tutionalize violence for the foresee
able future."
After attacking the administra
tion's failure to keep the peace, he of
fered a three-prong prescription for
success — keep Americans out of
harm's way, quit having Americans
unnecessarily kill Arabs and put to
gether a concert of nations to mediate
Iraq's problems.
Wilson also referred several times
to his former bestseller. " Hie Politics
oi liutli."
"It's not a Bush bashing book. It's
a book about one man's time in the
foreign service," he told the audience.
After the speech. Wilson signed more
than 60 copies and talked to well
wishers.
Hie crowd reacted was positively
to Wilson, who received only two crit
ical questions among the more than
15 he took. 11 is anti-Bush rhetoric res
onated with the crowd, which gave
him two standing ovations.
"I think the Bush administration is
trying to cover up their wrongdoings
by attacking his wife," said ASSU
Speakers Bureau member Meera
Vcnu. a sophomore, after watching
the speech and having dinner with the
ambassador earlier in the evening.
Some students were required to
watch the speech for their communi
cations course.
"I don't know as much as I would
like to, but I bought his book," said
senior Paxson Sterling while waiting
for Wilson to sign her book." I thought
he had a really interesting perspective
on everything that has happened."
Wilson flew in from Washington
earlier in the day by himself and
planned to fly to Idaho fora speech at
Idaho State Universi v tomorrow
night.
