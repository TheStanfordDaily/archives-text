Seniors respond to announcement
of Commencement venue
What would Harvard do? That's
right. I said it. What would our East
Coast equivalent do? In fact, what
would Cal do? When news broke on
Monday about the University's deci
sion to hold Commencement 2006 at
Frost Amphitheater, 1 began to won
der if I had made the wrong choice in
schools. Surely, our privately funded
University with one of the largest en
dowments in the nation had not de
cided to take the cheap way out.
Alas, they had. and now 1 am sup
posed to convince my grandparents,
aunts and uncles that it will be just as
special to watch Commencement on a
television in a gym a few blocks away
as it would be to see the real deal.
Is Frost really the best option? 1
hardly think so. A venue that "accom
modates" up to 6,900 people — thus
rewarding each graduate with a pithy
four tickets — cannot possibly be the
best choice. After over three years of
adhering to Stanford's standards, it's
time to speak out. Does this Universi
ty really undervalue its students so
much that it will settle for such medi
ocrity? It's just conjecture, but I don't
think Harvard would do that.
Jeff Wachtel was quoted in The
Daily saying, "[Frost's] main draw
back is that, unlike the Stadium, there
is a limit on the number of people who
can attend; we know this may be a dis
appointment to some students."
"Some"? I haven't heard a single pos
itive response to the decision. In fact.

the backlash has been astounding.
If Stanford can develop a robotic
car and map the human genome, why
can't we be innovative enough to de
vise a suitable plan for Commence
ment?
Additionally, the proposed com
pensation plan is a joke. When the
University says it will put emphasis on
departmental graduations, does it
mean it will send out an extra pam
phlet, or maybe provide each depart
ment with cookies from Safeway? I'm
not impressed.
An e-mail from the senior class
presidents suggested a senior class
party as compensation. Urn, isn't that
what Pub Nights are? It's not a novel
idea and I don't think my grandpar
ents will find it to be an adequate al
ternative to Commencement —
they're not really into the whole party
scene.
President Hennessy, we need to go
back to the drawing board. Maybe it's
time to call up President Larry Sum
mers at Harvard and see if he has any
suggestions. When it's my time to be
come the first college graduate in my
family, I want all of the people who
have stood by me the entire way to be
standing right there to see what they
have helped accomplish. Frost Am
phitheater simply will not suffice.

I realize that there are limited op
tions for where we can hold Com
mencement this year, but my family
and I are extremely upset at this deci

sion to limit the amount of guests
each graduate can bring.
I and many of my fellow class
mates are not concerned at all with
Frost Amphitheater's "aesthetics, ac
cessibility, comfort, cost-effectiveness
and history as a past Commencement
site." History is hardly as important as
being in the presence of the people
you love, and we simply want our fam
ilies to share the day with us. Having
Commencement in an open field on
or off-campus would be better than
limiting whom we can invite to come.
Surely Shoreline Amphitheater,
Foothiil College or another local
venue would be a better choice than
Frost.
Furthermore, 1 am amazed that
the administration has simply disre
garded students' primary concern —
inviting as many friends and family
members as possible — and has de
cided that other factors outweighed
our chief interests. We are the gradu
ating class — shouldn't our top prior
ities for our graduation be considered
first and foremost?
This is one of the most important
days I will have while here at Stan
ford, and I am hurt that the Universi
ty won't allow my whole family —
who have been so supportive of me
and my Stanford education — to be
present at Commencement.
I am angered, shocked and disap
pointed in the decision this adminis
tration has made.
