## Open letter to the administration

To the Administration
of Stanford University:
Sunday night, an e-mail from the
senior class presidents circulated, in
forming the Class of 2006 that we will
each be permitted to bring four
guests to our graduation ceremony.
Frost Amphitheater, despite hav
ing the smallest capacity of any of
the sites considered, was selected
"for its aesthetics, accessibility, com
fort. cost-effectiveness and history
as a past Commencement site." Fur
ther, it is our understanding that the
administration believes an "ex
pand[ed] Class Day, a new senior
only party the night before, and em
phasized] departmental gradua
tions" in some way compensate for
the fact that members of our imme
diate families may be excluded from
our graduation.

While we appreciate the attempt
to better emphasize and improve
the events tangential to graduation,
it is laughable and insulting to even
suggest that such arrangements are
comparable to our families physi
cally being in attendance at com
mencement. Video screens are not
even remotely acceptable and we
are appalled that the current propo
sition is something the University
administration ever entertained as
plausible.
To say the least, it is stunning that
this decision was made without the
input of the class presidents until the
decision had been largely rendered.
Within an hour of receiving this e
mail, student groups formed and
messages flooded our inboxes ex
pressing dismay, disappointment and
outrage at the situation. At Reunion
Homecoming Weekend, so many

alums expressed that the Class of
2006 has proven itself to be one of
the most spirited, dedicated and in
volved classes on this campus in
many years. It would be a shame for
this administration to conclude our
time here by excluding so many of
the people that have helped us reach
this point in our lives.
While we appreciate considera
tion of aesthetics and finance, it
seems that Commencement would
be an event where expenditure
should not be prioritized above con
siderations such as these. If there is
anything you can do on our behalf to
rectify the situation, the Class of 2006
would be immensely grateful. Thank
you in advance. We, the Class of 2006,
await your reply and your remedy.
