## How do we choose among family? 
### BOB SENSENBRENNER 
Stanford forces individuals to
make tough decisions and
choices. The first such decision,
of course, is choosing to come to
Stanford. For many students, Stan
ford is among a handful of elite uni
versities from which they can choose
to attend. Other tough decisions in
clude choosing a major and ranking
housing choices in the melodramatic
Draw process. This year, however,
Stanford is also forcing students to
make a tough decision they should
never have to make: choosing which
members of their family get to watch
them graduate.
We will have to tell our siblings,
grandparents, friends or any one of a
host of other individuals that we are
sorry that they cannot see our gradu
ation in person. These are the same
people who sacrificed time and time
again in order for us to go to Stan
ford. They are the ones that made us
do the extra work, encouraged us

when we encountered obstacles and
worked long and late hours so that
their children could have a better
life. They are the ones who will not
be able to watch us graduate in per
son.
Some argue that Frost Amphithe
ater is a place steeped in tradition,
and point to the fact that it was used
for graduation in years past. The last
time a graduation was held in Frost
Amphitheater was 21 years ago.
While this may be a short time in the
scope of the University, for us mem
bers of the senior class, this is our en
tire lives. Some of us were in diapers
the last time Commencement was
held in Frost and some of us had not
even yet been born. Importantly, the
last Commencement held in Frost
also occurred before the widespread
availability of cheap airfare across
the country.
Now families from across the
country face heartbreak.The admin
istration should reconsider where
the Class of 2006 will graduate. It

needs to make seating the first and
foremost priority. Financial consid
erations should hardly be factored
into this graduation. After all, the
University is spending $85 million on
renovating the Stadium and over $1
billion over the next 10 years on new
buildings. Somehow the cost of set
ting up bleachers on Roble Field, for
example, does not seem all too ex
pensive in that context.
Finally, I would like to remind the
administration of a lesson that all of
our high school English teachers
were sure to teach us: Conclusions
matter. As seniors, I am sure many of
us have fond memories of our years
at this University. However, if our
last memories of Stanford were
denying our close relatives the
chance to see us graduate, I am sure
many will leave with a decidedly
sour taste in their mouths.
