## MEN'S SOCCER Stanford men split versus northwest foes 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal went from stunning victory
to sound defeat to conclude a bizarre road
trip Monday. Last Friday, Stanford men's
soccer achieved one of its most important
and thrilling victories of the season thus far,
a 3-2 win over Oregon State (8-5-4,4-3-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference). Yet three days later,
the Cardinal took their momentum to Seat
tle, and were convincingly beaten.3-0, by the
Washington Huskies (9-4-1,3-3-1 Pac-10).
On Friday afternoon, the Cardinal (4-9-
2,1-5-1 Pacific 10 Conference) won 3-2 over
Oregon State, who led the conference at the
time. Fresh off a 3-1 loss to the Beavers the
previous week, Stanford started fast, and
managed to accomplish something it had
struggled to do all year — get on the board
first. On a direct kick, sophomore defender
Ryan Oblak curved a shot over and around
the wall and into the near upper corner.
The Beavers fought back, however, and
Lucas Egenwall tied the contest midway
through the first half on a near post. In the
early second half, the Beaver's explosive
senior forward Ryan Johnson was brought
down in the penalty box, and Egenwall de
posited the ensuing penalty kick past Car
dinal junior goalie Andrew Kartunen.
But when Johnson was ejected in the
53rd minute for striking Stanford's sopho
more defender Kyle Hency. players report
ed the ejection dampened the explosive
ness of the Beavers and sapped the energy
out of their squad.
"Though the game was fairly even be
fore that, 1 thought that they weren't able
to be as dangerous on the counter without
Johnson," head coach Bret Simon said.
"We started to have more and more of the
play, as you'd expect being a man up.
The hot weather served to enhance the
Cardinal's man advantage.
"It turned very warm and humid during
the game," Simon said. "The weather played
in our favor because their team got tired,
[and] everything opened up in a way it might
not have without their ability to effectively
counterattack. They had to absorb a lot of
punishment, since we were around the goal
with opportunity after opportunity."

As the seconds ticked off. it looked like
the Beavers might hold on for the victory.
But with seven minutes remaining, senior
midfielder Cooper McKee received an
entry pass in the box from sophomore mid
fielder Dan Shapiro and fired it low for the

equalizer.
Though they were held scoreless for the
rest of regulation, the Cardinal only had to
wait two minutes into the extra frame for
the clincher.
"[Junior midfielder] Galen Thompson,

who has been playing quite well for us out
wide, cut the ball into the middle from the
left flank and served a ball up ," Simon said.
"[Junior midfielder] Michael Brown raced
in, and [sophomore forward] Scott Bolkan
jumped up with their central defender and
fought hard near the goal mouth. It went
over their heads and Brown tucked it in far
post for the game."
Still riding high after garnering its first
conference victory, Stanford then arrived
in Seattle to face the surging Huskies.
In their 1-0 victory at Maloney Field last
weekend, Washington capitalized on a
score in the 12th minute. On Sunday, the
Huskies again tallied an early score against
the Cardinal, as senior Evan Cummings
found the back of the net on an eight-yard
shot in the ninth minute.
The Husky lead was threatened when
senior midfielder Jeff Hoover was ejected in
the 13th minute and Washington was forced
to play a man down for most of the game.
However, even with this disadvantage, the
Huskies continued to dominate the Cardinal.
"The biggest difference in the game was
Washington — on a cooler day — was able
to keep their work rate up and keep their de
fensive shape very tight," Simon said. "Their
central defenders are very strong and smart.
They kept their team together and their
midfield worked hard to never open up."
Washington kept its forward fresh by
rotating players at the position.This contin
ued shorthanded pressure resulted in a sec
ond goal, when sophomore Ely Allen
scored from inside the penalty box in the
30th minute. Because of the two-goal
deficit, the Cardinal pushed their players
forward, leaving breakaways open to the
Huskies. Sure enough, Husky sophomore
Spencer Schmidt put an exclamation point
in the 80th minute.
After the grueling road trip, the Cardi
nal plan to enjoy a bye week before home
games against No. 12 UCLA (8-3-2,3-1-1)
and San Diego State (7-1-4,1-1-3).
"We'll be able to work hard without the
pressure of preparing fora particular op
ponent," Simon said. "Therefore, we can do
some things that may be fun. Maybe we'll
have the weekend off — it's been a long
time since we've had that."
