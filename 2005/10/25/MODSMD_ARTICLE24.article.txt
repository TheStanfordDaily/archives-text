# Men's water polo triumphs over Long Beach State â€” late
## Senior captain Peter Varellas' three goals pace Stanford against the No. 8 49ers 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
For No. 3 Stanford men's water polo
(13-3,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), scoring early and often seems to
have become a distinctive habit. In 16
games this season, the Stanford men have
overwhelmed their opposition in the first
period by a 48-22 margin.
As a result, the majority of the Cardi
nal's victories this season have come in un
exciting fashion, with the outcome effec
tively decided within the first few minutes
of play. However, the Cardinal were
forced to find another way to win on Sat
urday against No. 8 Long Beach State.
After taking a narrow 5-4 lead into the
half, the Stanford squad demonstrated its
signature offensive explosion in the third
period of play, en route to downing the
49ers, 10-8.
The contest opened with the two teams
exchanging goals in an action-packed first
period. When 49ers' attacker Stefan
Ludecke buried a shot with 40 seconds re
maining in the opening stanza to make the
score 3-2, LBSU seemed poised to roll into
the second period with the lead. But junior
driver Marcello Pantuliano knotted the
contest at three when he scored on Stan
ford's last possession of the period.

The second period progressed as an
even battle between the two squads until
senior captain Peter Varellas tallied the
go-ahead goal for the Cardinal with time
running down on the half.
It was only in the third that the Stan
ford men were finally able to pull away
from their pesky opponent. Senior captain
Thomas Hopkins converted a four-meter
penalty shot at 6:09, but Long Beach State
attacker Erik Geoffroy countered just 21
seconds later with the second of his four
goals.
It was then that Varellas started the of
fensive surge that ultimately gave Stan
ford the win. Varellas built the Stanford
lead to two by capitalizing on a two-man
fast break that followed a LBSU turnover
at half-tank.
On the Cardinal's next possession, jun
ior two-meter defender J. J. Garton provid
ed a decisive blow, notching his only tally
of the day. Garton found himself open in
front of the goal when he collected a re
bound off the hand of 49er goalie Thomas
Onyshko. With Onyshko out of position,
Garton wasted no time, sending the ball
into the right side of the cage to push the
score to 8-5. Junior driver Tyler Drake
added a ninth goal for the Cardinal with
