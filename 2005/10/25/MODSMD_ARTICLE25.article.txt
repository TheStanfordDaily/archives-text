# Women's tennis completes busy weekend at Taube
## Logar, Barnes, Yelsey Durkin, Liu and Nguyen all compete, with mixed results for the six Cardinal 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team was enjoying a successful run this
weekend at the ITA Northwest Regional
Championship. All three doubles teams
with first-round byes had remained alive
well into the quarterfinals, and two of those
pairs broke through to the semifinals.
In singles. No. 13 junior Theresa Logar
(4-2) was seeded second at the tourna
ment and breezed past her opponents in
straight sets. She notched back-to-back
wins on Sunday, claiming a 6-2, 6-1 deci
sion over California's Stephanie Kusano,
followed by a victory over teammate

Celia Durkin (4-2).
But on Monday, the Cardinal's luck ran
out at Tauhe Family Tennis Stadium. The
Golden Bears' No. 12 Suzi Fodor (6-0) got
the best of Logar in three sets, 1-6,6-2,6-1.
Logar's loss followed a Fresno State
doubles upset of Stanford's Alice Barnes
and Anne Yelsey. The Bulldogs' Lucia
Sainz and Katharina Winterhalter topped
the Cardinal duo, 8-6.
"Normally when you come off having
lost, you can (pinpoint) some areas where
you could have done better." Barnes said.
"The funny thing is we probably played
our best [at Northwest] in the final. We
were lobbing well, we were serving well
and Fresno State just played the big points

a little bit better than us."
Barnes and Yelsey move to 4-2 on the
season. The No. 6 tandem had a crucial op
portunity to break Fresno State's serve, but
a wayward lob hit Yelsey's back instead of
landing out-of-bounds.
"We got pretty unlucky," Barnes said.
"But even so. we've certainly improved
from last year when we won at Ojai. We'll
just have to work on our game [some
more]."
No. 13 Logar (5-2), meanwhile, has dra
matically improved her singles ranking,
having once sat at No. 84.
Logar conceded only two contests dur
ing the 2004 team season and carries the
same moxie and pluck into this season.The
5-foo-9 junior had few problems taking
charge of the 128-player singles field at
Northwest.
Before downing Durkin and Kusano on

Sunday, Logar made quick work of her
first-round opponent, Cal Poly's Sheila
Lewis. Logar allowed Lewis a scant two
games in the 6-1,6-1 decision.
Washington's Tara Simpson fared only
slightly better in the second round, where
she was handed a 6-2,6-2 defeat.
Ultimately, Logar would come up short
against Fodor, who is agile and compact at
only 5-foot-3.
"What [I] saw in her final match was
each player getting off to a good start in
their sets," Barnes said. "I would just say
the match got away from her in the third."
TWo-time NCAA Singles Champion
Amber Liu, a senior, fell in yesterday's
semifinal against Fresno State, 8-6. Liu and
Durkin were neck-in-neck with Sainz and
Winterhalter, until their serve was broken.
Fresno State jumped at the rare op
portunity and served out the match.
Liu had no qualms with the final
result; rather, she remained pleased
with her partner's potential.
"We mesh pretty well," Liu said.
"Celia is very aggressive at the net,
[and] she has a pretty big serve. [To
gether], we're pretty similar to how 1
played with Anne last year."
This past May, Yelsey and Liu
were runners-up at the NCAA Dou
bles Final, losing to fellow Cardinal
Alice Barnes and now-graduated
Erin Burdette.
Freshman Jessica Nguyen (2-1)
did not enter the doubles fray this
tournament but made a strong
showing in the Northwest singles
arena.
Nguyen, who was seeded 16th,
won her first three matches, includ
ing a tight victory over Oregon's
Carmen Serementa, 7-6(4), 7-5.
