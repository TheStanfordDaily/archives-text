# Butkus and Pirates and Moss, Oh My!
## 
### 
Ahoy, matey — hop aboard Captain To
pher's ship "The Turnaround". Update:
Yarrrgh! This column took great offense
last month at the farce ESPN had foisted upon a
Pennsylvania high school football team by ar
ranging for former pro linebacker Dick Butkus
to coach, when he had never coached a football
game in his life.
But. avast! It has now become public knowl
edge that Butkus stepped down from his post just
eight weeks into the season. (Presumably he left
some adult language with the producers, just for
good measure.)
The real head coach of Montour High diplo
matically and understatedly called the situation a
"distraction," while players simply said they were
happy to have the cameras gone. They no doubt
now realize that not everyone can throw on a pe
gleg and an eyepatch and captain the ship.
On to rougher waters; as a broadcaster, 1 con
stantly find myself disappointed by the announc
ers on television. Break the rum ration. Hardy —
what follows is a guided tour of some of their
more egregious (or at least annoying) gaffes.
I.The term "Skill Position":This is a classic in
stance of a phrase whose meaning has nothing to
do with the meanings of the individual words it
actually contains.The term is supposed to be syn
onymous with ballcarriers — backs and re
ceivers. However, only a landlubber could come
up with the idea that these particular players
have more skill than the offensive line and the
entire defensive roster.
I can't be sure,but I'm willing to bet some lazy
announcer, sportswriter or NFL scout made up
this inane shorthand to save himself a few words.
The term has since spread like a bad urban leg
end, with the proliferation of recap shows, fanta
sy football leagues and other things that don't re
ally deal with the game itself.
And let's get serious — has anyone actually
noticed much skill in some of these players?
We're starting to see Division I college receivers
drop balls with regularity.
A generation ago, every guy on the high
school team could catch as well as today's top
flight wide receivers. That was in the days before
video games and soccer became popular after
noon diversions in the United States, stunting the
development of upper-body gross motor skills.
Anyone who watched last year's Big Game
knows what I'm talking about,
2. Stupid excuses for dumb moves: Talking
heads always want to excuse moronic mistakes
with equally weak rationalizations. "He fumbled
the ball because he's trying to make a play"; 14 He
had to bean the opposing batter because his guy
got hit in the last inning,"; "He slapped the ball
out of the pitcher's hand in the ALCS because he
wants to win so bad." This kind of stuff really
shivers me timbers.
3. Limeys: Just kidding. English chums make
great golf and soccer commentators.
4. Pulling punches: Some of these sports peo
ple just won't tell it like it is. On the heels of accu
sations by disgruntled running back Maurice
Clarrett, Ohio State was undressed last fall in an
ESPN The Magazine article alleging academic
fraud and illegal booster activity. Talking heads
danced around the serious charge that one of the
nation's largest public universities was running a
de facto professional outfit — with cash, cars,
fake grades and no-work jobs being given to
football players.
But all was well the next week. Winning for
gave everything when the Buckeyes upset Michi
gan. The commentators fawned about how great
this was fora program in such "turmoil," great for
a team that "needed something to feel good
about."
One line I wanted to hear:"lf these allegations
are true, they're obviously getting their money's
worth in Columbus."
In cases like this, writers and commentators
will say they are upholding journalistic "objectiv
ity," but in reality, they simply lack the guts to say
what's actually going on.
A classic (and hilarious) example took place
after Vikings receiver Randy Moss was cited for
striking a traffic officer with his vehicle. As the
team prepared to kick off against the Seahawks,
ESPN's football announcers staged a Moss love
fest, saying the act was truly out of character for
the model citizen. Evidently, all the press dis
tracted the team,and Seattle back Shaun Alexan
der exploded for an NFL-record five touch
downs in one half. Alexander's career day was a
big drag on the broadcasters, as their precon
ceived storyline of Randy Moss' redemption
evaporated before their eyes.
I don't even have the space to rattle my sabre
at syncophants (Dick Vitale), shills (Lee Corso),
rank homers (Notre Dame) and egomaniacs
(Chris Collinsworth.) We'll have to plunder them
on our next voyage.

noon diversions in the United States, stunting the
development of upper-body gross motor skills.
Anyone who watched last year's Big Game
knows what I'm talking about,
2. Stupid excuses for dumb moves: Talking
heads always want to excuse moronic mistakes
with equally weak rationalizations. "He fumbled
the ball because he's trying to make a play"; 14 He
had to bean the opposing batter because his guy
got hit in the last inning,"; "He slapped the ball
out of the pitcher's hand in the ALCS because he
wants to win so bad." This kind of stuff really
shivers me timbers.
3. Limeys: Just kidding. English chums make
great golf and soccer commentators.
4. Pulling punches: Some of these sports peo
ple just won't tell it like it is. On the heels of accu
sations by disgruntled running back Maurice
Clarrett, Ohio State was undressed last fall in an
ESPN The Magazine article alleging academic
fraud and illegal booster activity. Talking heads
danced around the serious charge that one of the
nation's largest public universities was running a
de facto professional outfit — with cash, cars,
fake grades and no-work jobs being given to
football players.
But all was well the next week. Winning for
gave everything when the Buckeyes upset Michi
gan. The commentators fawned about how great
this was fora program in such "turmoil," great for
a team that "needed something to feel good
about."
One line I wanted to hear:"lf these allegations
are true, they're obviously getting their money's
worth in Columbus."
In cases like this, writers and commentators
will say they are upholding journalistic "objectiv
ity," but in reality, they simply lack the guts to say
what's actually going on.
A classic (and hilarious) example took place
after Vikings receiver Randy Moss was cited for
striking a traffic officer with his vehicle. As the
team prepared to kick off against the Seahawks,
ESPN's football announcers staged a Moss love
fest, saying the act was truly out of character for
the model citizen. Evidently, all the press dis
tracted the team,and Seattle back Shaun Alexan
der exploded for an NFL-record five touch
downs in one half. Alexander's career day was a
big drag on the broadcasters, as their precon
ceived storyline of Randy Moss' redemption
evaporated before their eyes.
I don't even have the space to rattle my sabre
at syncophants (Dick Vitale), shills (Lee Corso),
rank homers (Notre Dame) and egomaniacs
(Chris Collinsworth.) We'll have to plunder them
on our next voyage.

The TurnAßßßound
Ahoy, matey — hop aboard Captain To
pher's ship "The Turnaround". Update:
Yarrrgh! This column took great offense
last month at the farce ESPN had foisted upon a
Pennsylvania high school football team by ar
ranging for former pro linebacker Dick Butkus
to coach, when he had never coached a football
game in his life.
But. avast! It has now become public knowl
edge that Butkus stepped down from his post just
eight weeks into the season. (Presumably he left
some adult language with the producers, just for
good measure.)
The real head coach of Montour High diplo
matically and understatedly called the situation a
"distraction," while players simply said they were
happy to have the cameras gone. They no doubt
now realize that not everyone can throw on a pe
gleg and an eyepatch and captain the ship.
On to rougher waters; as a broadcaster, 1 con
stantly find myself disappointed by the announc
ers on television. Break the rum ration. Hardy —
what follows is a guided tour of some of their
more egregious (or at least annoying) gaffes.
I.The term "Skill Position":This is a classic in
stance of a phrase whose meaning has nothing to
do with the meanings of the individual words it
actually contains.The term is supposed to be syn
onymous with ballcarriers — backs and re
ceivers. However, only a landlubber could come
up with the idea that these particular players
have more skill than the offensive line and the
entire defensive roster.
I can't be sure,but I'm willing to bet some lazy
announcer, sportswriter or NFL scout made up
this inane shorthand to save himself a few words.
The term has since spread like a bad urban leg
end, with the proliferation of recap shows, fanta
sy football leagues and other things that don't re
ally deal with the game itself.
And let's get serious — has anyone actually
noticed much skill in some of these players?
We're starting to see Division I college receivers
drop balls with regularity.
A generation ago, every guy on the high
school team could catch as well as today's top
flight wide receivers. That was in the days before
video games and soccer became popular after
noon diversions in the United States, stunting the
development of upper-body gross motor skills.
