### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
"We are sad that this happened to such a young person as Cynthia."
— JOHN DUNNING, Stanford head coach

Freshman outside hitter Cynthia Barboza will
miss the rest of the 2005 volleyball season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
Prior to the injury, the volleyball standout was
playing at an Ail-American level. Even on a pro
gram as deep as No. 5 Stanford (18-3,7-2 Pacific 10
Conference), the true freshman immediately estab
lished herself as an offensive leader. Barboza cur
rently leads the Pac-10 in kills (297), places third in
the conference with 4.5 kills per game and ranks sec
ond on the squad in hitting percentage (.306). Bar
boza. who started all 21 matches this season for the

Cardinal, was an alternate on the 2004 U.S. Olympic
team and the Gatorade National High School Play
er of the Year before arriving on the Farm.
ITie Long Beach, Calif, native suffered the knee
injury during the first play of the third game in
Stanford's victory last Friday.Team doctor Michael
Dillingham relayed the news to Barboza in a Mon
day afternoon meeting, one day after she was car
ried off the court in Berkeley.
"This is something that is hard to get over," head
coach John Dunning said in a release. "We are sad
that this happened to such a young person as Cyn
thia. As a volleyball program, there are now two
jobs — to help Cynthia get healthy again and to
move on from here."
