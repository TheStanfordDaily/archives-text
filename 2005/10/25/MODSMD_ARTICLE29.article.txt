## Women's soccer wins, ties â€” scores just one goal in Arizona 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Returning home with just one of a possible six points
was not the result Stanford Women's Soccer (8-5-2,2-2-1
Pacific 10) was shooting for this weekend on their Ari
zona road swing. However, after a scoreless draw with
Arizona State (8-6-3,3-2-1 Pac-10) and a 2-1 loss to Uni
versity of Arizona (9-4-3,4-1 -1 Pac-10), the Cardinal had
no choice but to arrive back on campus disappointed by
a sub-par weekend.
Friday's game against Arizona State saw a double
overtime battle between two very evenly matched teams
end in a scoreless tie. Stanford's recurring problem of
failing to finish scoring chances was evident, as seven dif
ferent players took two shots on goal, yet none could
beat Sun Devil keeper Kim Bingham.
Defensively, however, the fact that the Cardinal
pitched a shutout reflected upon the team's resolve, as
sophomore Erica Holland was unexpectedly thrust into
starting in goal for the contest. Holland replaced fresh
man keeper Alex Gamble, who was sidelined due to in
jury. Gamble had started all but one of Stanford's previ
ous games this season,and her six shutouts placed second
in the conference.
"We hope [that it's not a] serious injury," head coach
Paul Ratcliffe said. "She's getting an MRI, so we'll know
more soon. Hopefully, she'll be okay."
Holland and her Sun Devils counterpart Junior Bing
ham both performed admirably, each making strong
saves and clearances of the 35 total shots recorded dur
ing the match. In only her second career start, Holland
notched eight saves and the first shutout of her colle
giate career.
"The performance on Friday was very good," Rat
cliffe remarked. "The game was very even and the 0-0 tie
seemed appropriate."
Sunday afternoon saw a similar struggle between two

close teams. Arizona senior Mallory Miller scored her
first goal of the afternoon in the 20th minute to give the
Wildcats a 1-0 lead. Stanford responded in the early sec
ond half, when freshman midfielder Kate Mannino
notched her first collegiate goal to knot the contest at
one. Sophomore midfielder Lizzy George tallied an as
sist on the play, which came in the 56th minute.
Arizona scored the winner in the 79th minute when
Miller netted her second goal of the game after the
Wildcats were awarded a debatable free kick off a Stan
ford handball. The offensive explosion from Miller was
hardly unexpected, as the senior entered the weekend
averaging 1.07 scores per contest. placing her seventh in
the nation.
Holland picked up her third start in goal, recording
seven saves on the afternoon Arizona goalkeeper Mc-
Call Smith recorded 10 saves.
Although satisfied with his team's performance, Rat
cliffe was disappointed by the result, which he felt result
ed from the questionable handball call.
"The performance today was pretty good, although I
thought we could have played a little bit better," Ratcliffe
said. "Mallory Miller scored from a penalty kick and a
free kick, and the free kick was first-class. It was a great
goal, but it was unfortunate that a debatable hand ball
that wasn't intentional decided the game. It was a hard
way to lose because 1 think the team played pretty well."
The Cardinal will need to refocus this week to revive
their Pac-10 title aspirations, as they host USC and No. 4
UCLA this upcoming weekend. Finishing will no doubt
be on the agenda, as Stanford is still searching fora reli
able goal-scorer on the squad.
"Our speed of play has got to be a little faster, and we
still have to work on finishing," Ratcliffe said. "We're cre
ating a lot of chances, but we need to finish them. We
have a lot of players who have scored one or two goals
this season, but we are looking fora player who will score
in every game now."
