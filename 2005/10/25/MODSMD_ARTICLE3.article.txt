Worried about missing the Dalai Lama's
speeches in November? Sad you missed Steve
Jobs' commencement speech last year? With
last Thursday's launch of Stanford on i'llines —
a collaboration between Apple and the Univer
sity — you no longer have to be. Now, you can
simply go to http://itunes.stanford.edu and up
load audio files of these events.
The Stanford-Apple partnership involves
two separate Web sites, one public and one pri
vate, both of which provide exclusively Stan
ford-related audio-content through the i'lUncs
Music Store at no charge.

Though the public site, itunes.stanlord.cdu,
will be available to the general public, it is tar
geted towards alumni.
" Ihe content is as interesting to anyone in
terested in Stanford, but it allows alumni to re
connect and stay connected." explained Senior
Director of Alumni Relations David Vargas.
"It's unique in that respect."
The content currently available consists of
close to 4(X) tracks, divided into six categories,
ranging from music performed by members of
the Stanford community to faculty lectures to
sports coverage.
Tracks were chosen based on audio quality
and a conscious effort was made to "capture a

wide variety," said Vargas. Hie purpose of what
is currently available is to "give a sense of what's
coining," he explained. Eventually, the Univer
sity hopes to integrate podcasts into the project.
"As of eight [Sunday] morning, 1 (),()()()
unique visitors were accessing the site per hour,"
Vargas said. "Yesterday the number was 5,(MK(."
However, promotion of the site has been
limited to that done through this past week
end's Reunion Homecoming.
The second aspect of the collaboration —
the private site — provides course and advis
ing-related content. It can only be accessed
