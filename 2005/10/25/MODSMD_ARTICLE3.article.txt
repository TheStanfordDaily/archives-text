Worried about missing the Dalai Lama's
speeches in November? Sad you missed Steve
Jobs' commencement speech last year? With
last Thursday's launch of Stanford on i'llines —
a collaboration between Apple and the Univer
sity — you no longer have to be. Now, you can
simply go to http://itunes.stanford.edu and up
load audio files of these events.
The Stanford-Apple partnership involves
two separate Web sites, one public and one pri
vate, both of which provide exclusively Stan
ford-related audio-content through the i'lUncs
Music Store at no charge.

Though the public site, itunes.stanlord.cdu,
will be available to the general public, it is tar
geted towards alumni.
" Ihe content is as interesting to anyone in
terested in Stanford, but it allows alumni to re
connect and stay connected." explained Senior
Director of Alumni Relations David Vargas.
"It's unique in that respect."
The content currently available consists of
close to 4(X) tracks, divided into six categories,
ranging from music performed by members of
the Stanford community to faculty lectures to
sports coverage.
Tracks were chosen based on audio quality
and a conscious effort was made to "capture a

wide variety," said Vargas. Hie purpose of what
is currently available is to "give a sense of what's
coining," he explained. Eventually, the Univer
sity hopes to integrate podcasts into the project.
"As of eight [Sunday] morning, 1 (),()()()
unique visitors were accessing the site per hour,"
Vargas said. "Yesterday the number was 5,(MK(."
However, promotion of the site has been
limited to that done through this past week
end's Reunion Homecoming.
The second aspect of the collaboration —
the private site — provides course and advis
ing-related content. It can only be accessed
Alumni will
have access to podcasts

through Course Work and is therefore SUID pro
tected.
"Students who are in a course that is using the
service will see a new option on the Course Work
Web page for their course labeled 'iTlines,'" ex
plained Director of Web Communications Scott
Stocker.
Last spring, three IHUM classes tested the
technology, using it to distribute lectures, music
and readings.
"The trial was very successful and was ex
panded for the fall," said Alan Acosta, associate
vice president and director of University com
munications.
Currently, 12 classes are experimenting with
the options. According to a Stanford press re
lease, "If results are successful, the University
will broaden support for use of the tool in cours
es starting in 2006."

The project was developed in response to a re
quest from Apple.
"Apple wanted to test the ttlines technological plat
form [to see if] there is a marketplace for this product in
terms of using it for other sources of content," Vargas
said. "What better [place to test it] than Stanford?"
Because Stanford holds the rights to all of the audio
content and is interested in distributing that content,

"[the
Univer-

sity] has

elected to do

[so] for free," Var-

gas said, explaining the financial as
pect of the collaboration.
Though few students current
ly know about the project, several

computer courses have mentioned it in
class.

"Sounds a little bit scary," agreed freshmen Lauren
Colbert and Emily Gasner, referring to the possibilities
of an increase in workload as a result of the new technol
ogy. Other students were more optimistic, deeming the
concept "cool"
Stanford's collaboration with Apple has no associa
tion with the recent Yahoo! Music project.
