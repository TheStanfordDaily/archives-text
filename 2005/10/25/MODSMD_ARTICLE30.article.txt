## Google sued over digital library 
### MARK KOGAN 
The Association of American Publishers (AAP) filed
suit against Internet juggernaut Google early last week
over its plans to digitize public copyrighted works through
its new program dubbed "Google Print"
(http://print.google.com).
Google Print, launched in 2004. plans to digitize the
collections of five major libraries (Stanford, Harvard, Ox
ford, University of Michigan andThe New York Public Li
brary) and make them available online through a Google
powered search engine that will scan the books for the
submitted phrases and return highlighted excerpts from
their collection.
The AAP has brought the suit on the basis of copyright
infringement, citing that Google is making copyrighted
works available to the public at no cost and without prior
permission from the publishers.
The suit follows a similar class-action case filed by the
Authors Guild in September.
Google argues that while entire books are digitized,
only excerpts containing the search term are returned as
results and are therefore covered under fair use. The fair
use clause of the Copyright Act was intended to allow the
use of copyrighted works under certain conditions with
out the permission of the copyright holder, such as citing
work in commentary or analysis.
"Fair use is a defense to infringement," said Chris
Sprigman, a fellow in the Stanford Law School Center for
Internet and Society and associate professor of law at the
University of Virginia. "It's not an exception in the sense
that what they do isn't an infringement, only that it is priv
ileged under the law."
Since the filings of these suits, Google has stopped
scanning copyrighted material but has continued adding
in the public domain — works that were published before
1923 or documents published by The United States Gov
ernment and its agencies.
But the question concerns more than just the legality
of Google Print.
"We have to think very hard about the social conse

quences of giving copyright owners the kind of power that
the publishers want to take," Sprigman explained.
"Google is not competing with these people — they are
offering people better knowledge of what is in these
books. In the long run. I think this works to the publishers'
benefit, but the publishers want to control how things af
fect their business, they want to call the shots."
Students are split on the issue of whether or not
Google is justified in its actions.
"I don't think it's a big problem," said junior Aroop
Kar. "You can look at Amazon and see blurbs from books
they are trying to sell. There's only so much you can do
with an excerpt, but I can understand the publishers'
problem."
Freshman Byron Vosburg concurred.
"I can see where [the A AP] is coming from and 1 would
probably feel the same in their position," he said. "But it
doesn't seem it would hurt book sales, they aren't giving
out books."
"It's obviously infringing somewhat," said freshman
ChrysantheTan. "But the average person isn't going to go
on Google and steal books. You can preview 30 seconds of
music on iTUnes and it doesn't seem any different."
Google is focusing on the fact that the purpose is not to
offer books free online, but merely to make searching
through books easier.
"They aren't offering these books for download,"
Sprigman said. "This isn't the Napster of the book world."
Many students like the concept behind Google Print,
citing its usefulness.
"I think having accessible literature is a good thing,"
said junior Mary Kate llanlon. "It would be helpful in
finding sources in areas I might not have originally looked
for."
Other students agreed.
"It seems to be one of those things that would make
your life much easier," Vosburg said. "No, it's not neces
sary, but it sure would be nice."
However, the suit goes beyond just the question of
Google Print's access to copyrighted
material. The decision of this lawsuit
will set a precedent for access to
copyrighted material through the In
ternet for the future.

"It could upset the arrangements
that have been made thus far in terms
of search engines and the Internet,"
Sprigman said. "Search engines,
Google included, which make copies
of Web pages for their search data
bases, could be infringing on copy
right in the future."
For now. Google Print is still run
ning all the works it has scanned into
the database and is continuing to add

new books daily from publishers who
have agreed to contribute their
works. Hie suit will be heard in court
in the coming months, when the fu
ture of Google Print will be decided.
"If you get a judge who is unre
llective and looks at the copyright
law as a set of prohibitions, [Google]
will lose,"Sprigman said."lf you get a
judge who understands what's at
stake here, then they'll win."
