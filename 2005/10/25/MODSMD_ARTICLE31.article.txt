# STUDENT LIFE
## PASU attends cultural conference 
### GEORGIA WELLS 
Among Stanford's many ethnic
groups on campus, students might
remember the Kayumanggi dance
troupe from the Pilipino American
Student Union (PASU) who per
formed a traditional dance involving
bamboo poles during New Student
Orientation. Students from PASU
brought this and other dances to
Fullerton, Calif, over the weekend as
part of the annual Friendship
Games, which unites Pilipino stu
dents from across the state.
"It's awesome," said junior Dana Per
alta, co-chair of the group. "And it's good
to show our freshmen a bigger Pilipino
student group outside of Stanford."
Pilipinos are underrepresented in
colleges compared to their immi
grant population numbers, and
PASU represents one of the smallest
Asian communities at Stanford, de
spite the fact that they represent the
largest Asian community in Califor
nia and second largest in the nation.
The imbalance in these numbers is
what led to the founding of the group
15 years ago.
"We try to give back to the com
munity," said PASU social chair
Ranier Gadduang, a junior.
In this spirit, the group has been

raising money fora Pilipino-Ameri
can scholarship fund, mentoring Fre
mont High School youth in Sunny
vale and organizing Pilipino Youth
Leadership Conferences.
"We are a very diverse group of
people with many interests" said
Gadduang. "We have members in [a
capella groups] Talisman and Every
day People, as well as many other
groups. [Dance groups] Alliance
Street Dance and DVB were both
started by PASU members."
Sophomore Diana Austria said
that the group is often referred to as
the "PASU posse."
"PASU is all about the friendship
and bonds that you form," she said.
Such bonds, she said, were almost
unavoidable after completing the
seven-hour road trip to Southern
California and CSU Fullerton last
weekend.
On the Fullerton campus, the
group competed in games and activ
ities with Pilipino-American stu
dents from over 20 schools. Attract
ing more than 2,000 students, the
event included contests like relay
races that built teamwork. In one
event, when Stanford's PASU found
themselves a few people short, they
borrowed members from Cal Poly s
team.

Freshman Elisa Nasol said she en
joyed the sense of shared experiences.
"It was so rewarding to be a fresh
man at the Friendship Games, in a
semi-familiar Pilipino environ
ment," she said. "This is what PASU
is all about."
Freshman Sarah Ikemotl said she
was gratified to be reunited with
friends she hadn't seen since middle
school and who now attend other
schools around the state.
Upon arrival, Stanford's PASU
was greeted by some with the chant
— "You are smart," to which they re
sponded, "You are also smart."They
inspired more cheers and some
laughter when they hit the stage with
a hip hop dance choreographed to
music from the movie "Napoleon
Dynamite."
"This is the third time I have gone
to Friendship Games, and this year I
had the most fun," said PASU Issues
Chair Marc Rillera, a junior. "I got to
see the freshman experience —
what I experienced my freshman
year. I got to feel their excitement
and enthusiasm."
Peralta agreed.
"Every year, we have to decide
whether to go — it's usually a busy
weekend — but we're always so glad
we did," she said.
