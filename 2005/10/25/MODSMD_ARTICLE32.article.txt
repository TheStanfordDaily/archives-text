## New campaign pushes service 
### KAITLIN WOOD 
Stanford has earned the distinction this year of being
one of six pilot schools to participate in the Call to Serve
campaign, a program that seeks to attract college stu
dents from across the country to public service.
The program was launched in April of 2002 by the
Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan and non
profit organization, and the U.S. Office of Personal Man
agement to educate American youth about careers in
government. The campaign will test recruitment meth
ods and evaluate how they work on college campuses so
that federal agencies can develop better outreach efforts
in schools nationwide.
This year, Stanford — along with Clark-Atlanta,
Louisiana State, the University of New Mexico, Ohio
State and George Washington University — will partic
ipate in a project that will allow federal agencies to re
produce successful employment strategies at other col
lege campuses in the years to come.
"I think there's a lot of exciting opportunities in the
federal government, and I think that people write them
off sometimes," said Student Development Programs
Director Jon McConnell of the Haas Center for Public
Service. "This program will help educate students about
some of the great opportunities occurring in the govern
ment."
With more than half of the 1.8 million federal em
ployees eligible to retire within the next five years, fed
eral agencies feel that it is about time they began to re
cruit prospective youth.
Currently, over 550 college and university presidents
and chancellors have joined together with 60 federal
agencies to form the Call to Serve network. University
President John Hennessy has pledge to support the cam

paign, which requires a bigger commitment than mem
bership in the network does.
The six campuses chosen to participate in the more
in-depth pilot program have vastly different demo
graphics. The program aims to choose diverse communi
ties from across the country in order to gather a wide
range of information for effective implementation on
college campuses nationwide.
Schools in the Call to Serve network are committed
to providing students with the necessary information
about federal jobs; sponsoring campus events where in
formation about these jobs is made available; stressing
the importance of public and governmental service; and
providing students with the tools they need to pursue
openings in the federal government.
"There are so many different opportunities to serve
in the government," said Stanford Partnership for Pub
lic Service Coordinator Megan Fogarty. "We tend to
think you can just work on the Hill, or be president or
secretary of state, but really there's literally an endless
number of things you can do in the government."
Additionally, Stanford has decided to expand its ef
forts outside of the Call to Serve campaign.
"What's unique about Stanford is that we're expand
ing to include state and local government, and no one
else is doing this," Fogarty said. "'Hie depth of what Stan
ford is doing is incredible."
Last Friday, to celebrate the campaign's kickoff, as
tronaut Eileen Collins spoke to students about the space
program. She urged them to consider working for
NASA, noting that there is still much to be explored.
Not only will the program allow federal agencies the
opportunity to recruit intelligent and talented individu-
