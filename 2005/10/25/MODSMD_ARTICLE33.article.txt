## Rosa Parks dies at 92 
### BREE FOWLER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
DETROIT (AP) â€” Rosa Lee Parks, whose refusal
to give up her bus seat to a white man sparked the
modern civil rights movement, died Monday evening.
She was 92.
Mrs. Parks died at her home during the evening of
natural causes, with close friends by her side, said Gre
gory Reed, an attorney who represented her for the
past 15 years.
Mrs. Parks was 42 when she committed an act of de
fiance in 1955 that was to change the course of Amer
ican history and earn her the title "mother of the civil
rights movement."
At that time, Jim Crow laws in place since the post-
Civil War Reconstruction required separation of the
races in buses, restaurants and public accommodations
throughout the South, while legally sanctioned racial
discrimination kept blacks out of many jobs and neigh
borhoods in the North.
The Montgomery, Ala., seamstress, an active mem
ber of the local chapter of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, was riding on a
city bus Dec. 1,1955, when a white man demanded her
seat.
Mrs. Parks refused, despite rules requiring blacks to
yield their seats to whites. Two black Montgomery
women had been arrested earlier that year on the
same charge, but Mrs. Parks was jailed. She also was
fined $14.
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick said he felt a per
sonal tie to the civil rights icon:"She stood up by sitting
down. I'm only standing here because of her."
The Rev. A1 Sharpton called Mrs. Parks "a gentle
woman whose single act changed the most powerful
nation in the w0r1d.... One of the highlights of my life
was meeting and getting to know her."
Speaking in 1992, Mrs. Parks said history too often
maintains "that my feet were hurting and I didn't
know why I refused to stand up when they told me. But
the real reason of my not standing up was I felt that I
had a right to be treated as any other passenger. We
had endured that kind of treatment for too long."
Her arrest triggered a 381-day boycott of the bus
system organized by a then little-known Baptist minis
ter, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who later earned
the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.
"At the time 1 was arrested I had no idea it would
turn into this," Mrs. Parks said 30 years later. "It was
just a day like any other day. The only thing that made
it significant was that the masses of the people joined
in."
The Montgomery bus boycott, which came one
year after the Supreme Court's landmark declaration
that separate schools for blacks and whites were "in
herently unequal," marked the start of the modern
civil rights movement.
The movement culminated in the 1964 federal Civil
Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in pub
lic accommodations.
After taking her public stand for civil rights, Mrs.
Parks had trouble finding work in Alabama. Amid
threats and harassment, she and her husband Ray
mond moved to Detroit in 1957. She worked as an aide
in the Detroit office of Democratic U.S. Rep. John
Conyers from 1965 until retiring in 1988. Raymond
Parks died in 1977.

Mrs. Parks became a revered figure in Detroit,
where a street and middle school were named for her
and a papier-mache likeness of her was featured in the
city's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Mrs. Parks said upon retiring from her job with
Conyers that she wanted to devote more time to the
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Develop
ment.The institute, incorporated in 1987, is devoted to
developing leadership among Detroit's young people
and initiating them into the struggle for civil rights.
"Rosa Parks: My Story" was published in February
1992. In 1994 she brought out "Quiet Strength: The
Faith, the Hope and the Heart of a Woman Who
Changed a Nation." and in 1996 a collection of letters
called "Dear Mrs. Parks: A Dialogue With Today's
Youth."
