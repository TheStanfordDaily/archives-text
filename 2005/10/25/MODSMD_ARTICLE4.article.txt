# CAMPUS LIFE
## Activism focuses on monkey business 
### LOREN NEWMAN 
A string of protesters from the Animal
Rights on the farm group (ARF ) stood at the
corner of El Camino Road and Quarry Road
last Friday, carrying signs with phrases such as
"Towards Animals Humans are Nazis" and
"Stanford Kills Animals."
"We're here to raise awareness of the Uni
versity's use of animals in scientific experi
ments," said ARF President Claire Wagenscil, a
senior. "More than 20,(XX) animals are used for
experimentation."
The protesters eiicited many encouraging
honks and one or two angry looks from after

noon commuters.
Recently, one particular area of the Univer
sity's research has come under close scrutiny.
Last Wednesday, The San Jose Mercury News
reported that the organization Stop Animal Ex
ploitation Now (SAEN), in conjunction with
ARE released a report that "targeted work by
Stanford neurobiologist William Newsome,
who uses rhesus monkeys to study brain func
tion."
A close examination of the actual report re
veals that no such attack was made.
Regardless, passions run high on both sides
of the argument.
"This is an extremely emotional issue and

there are a 10l of people who have made up their
minds ahead of time," Ncwsome said. "I have
colleagues here in California who have received
death threats and colleagues in the United
Kingdom who have received pipe bombs at
their homes."
The animal rights groups are particularly
concerned about the use of head restraints and
the insertion of electrodes into the monkeys'
heads.
"We insert micro electrodes into the mon
keys' brains to monitor the activity in certain
areas," Newsome said. "The brain has no pain
receptors. These (microelectrodes)
don't hurt the animals."
The efficiency and necessity of
the research have also come into
question. "If all we did was
to eliminate duplication of work, we
would save millions of dollars and
thousands of animals' lives," said
SAEN member Michael Budkie in a
statement on the group's Web site.

"Sometimes replications of other
scientists' work are necessary to
make new discoveries. It's a critical
part of the scientific process," New
some said, motioning toward the
plaques on his office wall. "They
don't hand out awards like that for
repetitious work."
The University administration re
mains at odds with ARE
In a release quoted in The Mer
cury News, the Stanford Medical
Center Committee on Ethics stated,
"We support the conduct of biomed
ical research in order to help us un
derstand the world in which we live

and to apply this knowledge to the
benefit of humans and animals."
"Every procedure we do with any
animals in the laboratory undergoes
careful scrutiny," Newsome told the
Daily "We are carefully monitored
by the USDA. My goal is to run a
model laboratory that complies with
all regulations. I can't do anything
that I don't write down and have ap
proved by the right committee."
ARF also takes issue with the
high mortality rate of animals in
volved in the experiments.
Its pamphlet, "Animal Experi
mentation at Stanford University,"

states that "despite the variety of tests
these animals will endure, they all
share one commonality: all will perish
within the walls of Stanford Universi
ty's Research Animal Facility."
"All animals are euthanized at the
end of the experiments using feder
ally approved methods like those
employed at Humane Society shel
ters," Newsome said. "The integrity
of our science depends upon extract
ing the brains and examining them
carefully under the microscope to be
certain that our recordings indeed
came from the brain targets that we
intended to hit."

Both sides of the debate present
crucial questions.
"What if the animal rights move
ment had been as strong in the year
1905 as it is in 2005? What if all ani
mal research was halted then?"
Newsome asked. "Everyone with
Type I Diabetes would be dead.
There would be hundreds of thou
sands of children crippled by polio
and heart transplants would not
exist"
On the flip side, critics assert that
animals should not be used as substi
tutes for humans.
"Some scientists claim that the

use of primates has not contributed
to advances in the diseases that are
currently killing humans (i.e. heart
disease, cancer, HIV, etc.)," Budkie
said. "While humans are more close
ly related to primates than to other
species, primates may still be too dis
similar to be suitable subjects in
studies of human diseases."
To counter criticism, Newsome
asserted that he had tremendous re
spect for animal life.
"There are times and conditions
in which 1 am willing to do experi
ments on animals for the greater
good." he said.

came from the brain targets that we
intended to hit."

Both sides of the debate present
crucial questions.
"What if the animal rights move
ment had been as strong in the year
1905 as it is in 2005? What if all ani
mal research was halted then?"
Newsome asked. "Everyone with
Type I Diabetes would be dead.
There would be hundreds of thou
sands of children crippled by polio
and heart transplants would not
exist"
On the flip side, critics assert that
animals should not be used as substi
tutes for humans.
"Some scientists claim that the

use of primates has not contributed
to advances in the diseases that are
currently killing humans (i.e. heart
disease, cancer, HIV, etc.)," Budkie
said. "While humans are more close
ly related to primates than to other
species, primates may still be too dis
similar to be suitable subjects in
studies of human diseases."
To counter criticism, Newsome
asserted that he had tremendous re
spect for animal life.
"There are times and conditions
in which 1 am willing to do experi
ments on animals for the greater
good." he said.
A string of protesters from the Animal
Rights on the farm group (ARF ) stood at the
corner of El Camino Road and Quarry Road
last Friday, carrying signs with phrases such as
"Towards Animals Humans are Nazis" and
"Stanford Kills Animals."
"We're here to raise awareness of the Uni
versity's use of animals in scientific experi
ments," said ARF President Claire Wagenscil, a
senior. "More than 20,(XX) animals are used for
experimentation."
The protesters eiicited many encouraging
honks and one or two angry looks from after

noon commuters.
Recently, one particular area of the Univer
sity's research has come under close scrutiny.
Last Wednesday, The San Jose Mercury News
reported that the organization Stop Animal Ex
ploitation Now (SAEN), in conjunction with
ARE released a report that "targeted work by
Stanford neurobiologist William Newsome,
who uses rhesus monkeys to study brain func
tion."
A close examination of the actual report re
veals that no such attack was made.
Regardless, passions run high on both sides
of the argument.
"This is an extremely emotional issue and

there are a 10l of people who have made up their
minds ahead of time," Ncwsome said. "I have
colleagues here in California who have received
death threats and colleagues in the United
Kingdom who have received pipe bombs at
their homes."
The animal rights groups are particularly
concerned about the use of head restraints and
the insertion of electrodes into the monkeys'
heads.
"We insert micro electrodes into the mon
keys' brains to monitor the activity in certain
areas," Newsome said. "The brain has no pain
receptors. These (microelectrodes)
don't hurt the animals."
The efficiency and necessity of
the research have also come into
question. "If all we did was
to eliminate duplication of work, we
would save millions of dollars and
thousands of animals' lives," said
SAEN member Michael Budkie in a
statement on the group's Web site.

"Sometimes replications of other
scientists' work are necessary to
make new discoveries. It's a critical
part of the scientific process," New
some said, motioning toward the
plaques on his office wall. "They
don't hand out awards like that for
repetitious work."
The University administration re
mains at odds with ARE
In a release quoted in The Mer
cury News, the Stanford Medical
Center Committee on Ethics stated,
"We support the conduct of biomed
ical research in order to help us un
derstand the world in which we live

and to apply this knowledge to the
benefit of humans and animals."
"Every procedure we do with any
animals in the laboratory undergoes
careful scrutiny," Newsome told the
Daily "We are carefully monitored
by the USDA. My goal is to run a
model laboratory that complies with
all regulations. I can't do anything
that I don't write down and have ap
proved by the right committee."
ARF also takes issue with the
high mortality rate of animals in
volved in the experiments.
Its pamphlet, "Animal Experi
mentation at Stanford University,"

states that "despite the variety of tests
these animals will endure, they all
share one commonality: all will perish
within the walls of Stanford Universi
ty's Research Animal Facility."
"All animals are euthanized at the
end of the experiments using feder
ally approved methods like those
employed at Humane Society shel
ters," Newsome said. "The integrity
of our science depends upon extract
ing the brains and examining them
carefully under the microscope to be
certain that our recordings indeed
came from the brain targets that we
intended to hit."
