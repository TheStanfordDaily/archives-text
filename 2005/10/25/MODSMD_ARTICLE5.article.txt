## Frost Commencement proposal raises protest 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University officials' pick of Frost Am
phitheater as next year's commencement cer
emony has caused a rare and intense uproar
among graduating seniors, who have
launched a massive protest in hopes that the
administration will reconsider the decision.
A day after the announcement was made,
numerous angry e-mails have circulated
over chat lists, especially concerning the fact
that Frost's 9,000-guest seating capacity

would allow for only four guests per
student. In previous years, no limit

has been placed on the number
ot guests a student could invite

because the Stanford Stadi
um can hold as many as
85,000 people.

In a statement released
last night, the senior class pres-

idents acknowledged the dis-

may of graduating seniors and
said they were also outraged bv
the outcome.

"We share in that frustration
and disappointment," the senior

class presidents wrote in the state
ment. "We believe that Frost was the
wrong decision and that more appro-

priate alternatives existed."
ASSIJ President Melanie Kannokada also
voiced her unease over the decision.
"The ASSIJ Hxecutives are highly con
cerned by the commencement location issue
and we support all student outcries," Kan
nokada wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "We
have full faith in the leadership of the senior
class presidents and we hope to continue
working with them and the University admin
istration to improve the situation."
In protest of the commencement location,
students have generated at least two online
petitions — one for students and faculty and
the other for parents. At press time, more than
1,350 students had submitted their signatures
online.
"Restricting the number of guests greatly
underestimates the importance of graduation
and minimizes the sacrifices that parents, sib
lings and extended families have made in
order for the seniors to be here." wrote senior
Nia DeYounge in the petition. "For all of
Frost's supposed accessibility and comfort, we
think any possible benefits ought to be
weighed against the losses of limiting guests
and therefore separating families on an other

wise joyous occasion.
The original version of the student petition
contained graphics that ridiculed University
President John Hennessy — who delivered
the final verdict together with Provost John
Etchemendy — for ignoring student opinions.
Hie graphics were later removed in order to

minimize the con
flict. according to
Ben llegbodu, a
member of the
group that pro
duced the peti
tion.

Students

are also joining
protest groups on Face-

1 C- I
book.com as a symbolic
gesture to dispute the
decision. One of the
groups. "If 1 Have To
Graduate In Frost, I'm
Not Giving Stanford

Any Money," recruited ISO students
over a 24-hour period.

"At the moment, I will not
give a penny to the Senior Ciift,"
said senior Laura Viilanueva,

who created the group. "(Se
nior assistant to University
President] Jeff Wachtel was
quoted in The Daily today as

saying that the decision may be a disappoint
ment to some students. I le doesn't realize that
it is actually a disappointment to the majority
ol the senior class. The administration com
pletely misjudged how important it is for stu
dents to be able to invite all of their family
members to graduation."
The senior class presidents said they be
lieved the administration "went awry" in
their decision process. By refusing to consid

the beginning locations with larger capaci

posed holding the commencement in the
field on Sand Hill Road, the only other on
campus venue that allows for unlimited seat
ing, out of concern for costs and logistics.
The administration eventually proposed
two choices. Frost and Roble Field. The senior
class presidents said they supported the latter,
where each student would be allowed to bring
seven guests rather than just four.The adminis
