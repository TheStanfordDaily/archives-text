## Former prof will replace Greenspan 
### NEDRA PICKLER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Presi-
dent Bush named top White House
economic adviser Ben Bernanke as
chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board yesterday in place of near-leg
endary Alan Greenspan as the offi
cial in closest control of interest rates.
Bernanke instantly announced
his first priority would be "to main
tain continuity with the policy and
policy strategies under the
Greenspan era."
Bush said his choice as the na
tion's new central banker "com
mands deep respect in the financial
community." And he lavished praise
on Greenspan, 79. calling him a leg
end who "has shepherded our econo
my through its highs and its lows."
The appointment is subject to
Senate confirmation, and the presi
dent called for swift action.
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, issued a statement say
ing"! am confident that this nominee
will be thoroughly questioned but
also well-received by all members of
our committee."
Whatever the Senate's ultimate re
action. Wall Street liked what it heard.
Stocks rose as word of Bernanke's ap
pointment circulated before the pres
idential announcement.
It was the third time in as many
years Bush has turned to the 51 -year
old Bernanke fora sensitive eco
nomic post. The president named
him to the Fed board in 2002, then
made him chairman of the presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers
earlier this year.
"If I am confirmed bv the Senate

I will do everything in my power, in
collaboration with by Fed colleagues
to help assure the continued prosper
ity and stability of the American
economy," said Bernanke, who holds
degrees from Harvard and the Mass
achusetts Institute of Technology
and was chairman of Princeton's De
partment of Economics.
Greenspan, who became chair
man in 1987, completes his current
term on Jan. 31. By naming a succes
sor more than three months in ad
vance, Bush appeared to be trying to
clear the path fora smooth transition.
Greenspan did not speak at the
brief announcement ceremony, a
sure sign that his power is ebbing. For
two decades, it has been his voice that
has mattered most in Washington and
many capitals around the world when
it comes to key economy matters. His
pronouncements, famously opaque,
are scrutinized carefully for signs of
future policy direction.
He issued a statement after the
announcement, praising Bush fora
"distinguished appointment," and
adding he has no doubt that
Berrianke will "be a credit to the na
tion as chairman of the Federal Re
serve Board."
"Over the course of a career
marked by great accomplishment,
Ben has done path-breaking work in
the field of monetary policy, taught
advanced economics at some of our
top universities, and served with dis
tinction on the Fed's Board of Gov
ernors," Bush said.
Bernanke has "earned a reputa
tion for intellectual rigor and integri
ty," Bush said. "He commands deep
respect in the global financial com
munity. And he will be an outstanding
chairman of the Federal Reserve."

Bush praised Greenspan, as well,
calling him a legend. "Under his
steady chairmanship, the United
States economy has come through a
stock market crash, financial crises,
from Mexico to Asia, two reces
sions, corporate scandals, and
shocks ranging from devastating
natural disasters to a terrorist attack
in the heart of America's financial
center," he said.
While Bernanke pledged continu
ity with his predecessor's policies, the
two men differ on whether the Fed
should set targets for inflation. Other
wise they share a similar philosophy,
so much so that while the younger
man was at the Fed, market observers
often looked at his speeches for in
sight into Greenspan's thinking.
A summa cum laude graduate of
Harvard University in 1975, he re
ceived his doctorate from the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology in
1979. During his years in Boston, he
focused on the economic underpin
nings of the Great Depression and
the losing track record of the city's

beloved baseball team, the Red Sox.
"Economics is a very difficult sub
ject" Bernanke once said. "'l've com
pared it to trying to learn how to re
pair a car when the engine is running."
Senate Democratic Leader
Harry Reid issued a statement sig
naling the type of questions
Bernanke might expect at his confir
mation hearings.
"I look forward to the confirma
tion hearings to learn more about
Mr. Bernanke's views on how the
Federal Reserve should steer our
economy free from political influ
ence and interference," he said.
Reid, who has been sharply criti
cal of Greenspan for supporting
Bush's tax cuts, added,"lt will be im
portant that Mr. Bernanke demon
strate that he is committed to guiding
the economy to produce results for
all Americans rather than promoting
partisan policies that benefit special
interests and an elite few."
Greenspan was 61 when Presi
dent Ronald Reagan named him Fed
chairman.

on Greenspan, 79. calling him a leg
end who "has shepherded our econo
my through its highs and its lows."
The appointment is subject to
Senate confirmation, and the presi
dent called for swift action.
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, issued a statement say
ing"! am confident that this nominee
will be thoroughly questioned but
also well-received by all members of
our committee."
Whatever the Senate's ultimate re
action. Wall Street liked what it heard.
Stocks rose as word of Bernanke's ap
pointment circulated before the pres
idential announcement.
It was the third time in as many
years Bush has turned to the 51 -year
old Bernanke fora sensitive eco
nomic post. The president named
him to the Fed board in 2002, then
made him chairman of the presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers
earlier this year.
"If I am confirmed bv the Senate

I will do everything in my power, in
collaboration with by Fed colleagues
to help assure the continued prosper
ity and stability of the American
economy," said Bernanke, who holds
degrees from Harvard and the Mass
achusetts Institute of Technology
and was chairman of Princeton's De
partment of Economics.
Greenspan, who became chair
man in 1987, completes his current
term on Jan. 31. By naming a succes
sor more than three months in ad
vance, Bush appeared to be trying to
clear the path fora smooth transition.
Greenspan did not speak at the
brief announcement ceremony, a
sure sign that his power is ebbing. For
two decades, it has been his voice that
has mattered most in Washington and
many capitals around the world when
it comes to key economy matters. His
pronouncements, famously opaque,
are scrutinized carefully for signs of
future policy direction.
He issued a statement after the
announcement, praising Bush fora
"distinguished appointment," and
adding he has no doubt that
Berrianke will "be a credit to the na
tion as chairman of the Federal Re
serve Board."
"Over the course of a career
marked by great accomplishment,
Ben has done path-breaking work in
the field of monetary policy, taught
advanced economics at some of our
top universities, and served with dis
tinction on the Fed's Board of Gov
ernors," Bush said.
Bernanke has "earned a reputa
tion for intellectual rigor and integri
ty," Bush said. "He commands deep
respect in the global financial com
munity. And he will be an outstanding
chairman of the Federal Reserve."

Bush praised Greenspan, as well,
calling him a legend. "Under his
steady chairmanship, the United
States economy has come through a
stock market crash, financial crises,
from Mexico to Asia, two reces
sions, corporate scandals, and
shocks ranging from devastating
natural disasters to a terrorist attack
in the heart of America's financial
center," he said.
While Bernanke pledged continu
ity with his predecessor's policies, the
two men differ on whether the Fed
should set targets for inflation. Other
wise they share a similar philosophy,
so much so that while the younger
man was at the Fed, market observers
often looked at his speeches for in
sight into Greenspan's thinking.
A summa cum laude graduate of
Harvard University in 1975, he re
ceived his doctorate from the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology in
1979. During his years in Boston, he
focused on the economic underpin
nings of the Great Depression and
the losing track record of the city's

beloved baseball team, the Red Sox.
"Economics is a very difficult sub
ject" Bernanke once said. "'l've com
pared it to trying to learn how to re
pair a car when the engine is running."
Senate Democratic Leader
Harry Reid issued a statement sig
naling the type of questions
Bernanke might expect at his confir
mation hearings.
"I look forward to the confirma
tion hearings to learn more about
Mr. Bernanke's views on how the
Federal Reserve should steer our
economy free from political influ
ence and interference," he said.
Reid, who has been sharply criti
cal of Greenspan for supporting
Bush's tax cuts, added,"lt will be im
portant that Mr. Bernanke demon
strate that he is committed to guiding
the economy to produce results for
all Americans rather than promoting
partisan policies that benefit special
interests and an elite few."
Greenspan was 61 when Presi
dent Ronald Reagan named him Fed
chairman.
