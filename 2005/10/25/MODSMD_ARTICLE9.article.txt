BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€”
Three massive vehicle bombs ex
ploded yesterday near the Palestine
Hotel, killing at least 20 people.
Dramatic TV pictures showed one
of the bombers driving a cementt
truck through the concrete blast
walls that guard the hotel, then
blowing up his vehicle.
Iraq's national security adviser,
Mouwafak al-Rubaie, said the at
tack was a "very clear" effort to take
over the hotel and seize journalists
as hostages.
One of the car bombs exploded
near the police position on the
northeast side of Firdous Square,
where a statue of Saddam Hussein
was toppled in April 2003 shortly
after the fall of Baghdad, and more
than 100 yards east of the hotel. Se
curity officials said a third bomb
struck the area around the same
time. All three were believed to be
suicide attacks.
"Three cars came from three
different roads in succession to cre
ate security breaches for terror
ists," al-Rubaie told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview,
adding that they were armed with
rocket-propelled grenades and
light arms.
"The plan was very clear to us,
which was to take security control
over the two hotels, and to take the
foreign and Arab journalists as
hostages to use them as a bargain."
The U.S. military said no U.S.
troops were injured. It counted 10
dead Iraqis.
The security adviser said at least
40 people were injured, most of
them passers-by. Another official.
Deputy Interior Minister Hussein
Kamal, said four or five Iraqi police

were among the dead.
APTN footage showed that one
of three vehicle bombers had pene
trated the concrete blast walls sur
rounding the hotel compound be
fore exploding.
The cement mixer exploded in a
huge ball of flame and a cloud of
smoke.
Iraqi security officials said the
blasts occurred two minutes apart,
not long before Muslims marking
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan
were preparing to break their day
long fast. Shortly before the explo
sions truck came under fire nearby,
according to APTN.
The attacks caused heavy dam
age to the south side of the 19-story
Palestine Hotel, forcing journalists,
including those from AP, Fox News
and the U.S. government-funded
AlhurraTV station to take refuge in
the corridor. Fox and Alhurra said
their employees were safe.
Inside, light fixtures were
blown out, pictures were blasted
off the walls and windows were
shattered.
Moments before the second
blast, journalists, photographers
and technicians were walking up
and down hazy corridors in a state
of confusion, urging each other to
remain calm, put on flak jackets,
and to stay away from windows.
Thicker clouds of smoke filled the
far <*nd of one hallway, with many
people coughing and waving their
hands.
The second explosion shook the
building momentarily. Confusion
and panic again set in. with those in
side debating whether to exit, but all
eventually deciding to stay in the
corridor and sit propped against
walls, most in flak jackets. Sounds
resembling gunshots could be
heard outside.
