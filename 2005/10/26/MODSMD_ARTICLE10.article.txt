# Gonzaga students deliver leftovers to underprivileged

### JOHN K. WILEY ASSOCIATED PRES 
SPOKANE. Wash. (AP)— Even
though it's been more than 40 years
since Walletta Hayes attended col
lege, she has no trouble remember
ing mealtime in the campus dining
hall: limp, discolored vegetables and
mystery meat.
Nothing like the meals delivered
these days to Hayes and her neigh
bors at O'Malley Apartments from
the kitchen at nearby Gonzaga
University.
Three nights a week, student vol
unteers package dinners that other
wise would have gone to waste and
distribute them to residents of the
low-income complex. A recent din
ner tray included poached salmon,
wild rice and fresh string beans.
"I think this is better than the
dorm foods I used to get" at college
in the early 19605, Hayes said. "I
don't remember it being this good."
Gonzaga is one of six universities
nationwide which sponsor a Cam
pus Kitchens Project, in which stu
dent volunteers package unserved
dining hall food into nutritious
meals that they distribute to the eld
erly, homeless and underprivileged
in surrounding communities.
Founded as a pilot program at
St. Louis University in 2001, Cam
pus Kitchens is a spinoff of the suc
cessful Washington, D.C.-based
DC Central Kitchen, whose
founder and President Robert
Egger came up with the idea to use
unserved food and campus facili
ties during off hours to feed the
hungry.
"He saw a school that had a
kitchen ... and a fabulous opportu
nity to use space that is ready to go,
but not used at all hours," said Abby
Flottemesch, development director
of the nonprofit organization.

Campus Kitchen at Gonzaga or
ganizes the packaging and distribu
tion of meals.
Hannah Israel, a recent Univer
sity of Michigan graduate and the
21-year-old coordinator of the Gon
zaga program, is joined by about 40
regular volunteers at Cataldo din
ing hall to assemble meals, which
are supplemented by donations
from restaurants, grocery stores and
food banks.The next day volunteers
load up their cars with food — in
cluding dinners, sack lunches and
after-school snacks for elementary
school children involved in a cam
pus mentoring program — and de
liver them to clients of five hunger
relief agencies.
Hayes, a diabetic, has her meals
specially prepared with salads and
low-sugar desserts.
The Gonzaga program, which
helps train unemployed adults for
jobs in the food service industry,
serves about 500 meals a week.
"Spokane has a big issue with
homelessness and unemployment,"
Israel said. "There is a lot of need in
this community."
And the need clearly extends be
yond Washington state.
At Marquette University, senior
Kelly Collins volunteers six to eight
hours a week at the university's
Campus Kitchens.
"A lot of people that want to come
here... have these kind of values," she
said in a telephone interview from
the Milwaukee campus. "A lot feel 'I
should volunteer. I should give back
to the community."'
Besides Gonzaga, St. Louis and
Marquette, kitchen projects are op
erating at Chicago's Northwestern
University, Augsburg College in
Minneapolis and Dillard University
in New Orleans, although that
school was closed after Hurricane
Katrina.
