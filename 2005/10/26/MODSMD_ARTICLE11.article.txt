# Graduate Life
## You'll all be geezers, eventually 
### 
With Full Moon on the Quad in all-too-re
cent memory, a discussion regarding the
campus notion of "Sketchy Grads" is
timely. I started as a graduate student this fall and
have found the "Sketchy Grad" stigma rather un
propitious. In what context, you might ask? You
may want to sit down before you read this — but
I've been to an undergrad event or two since I start
ed as a graduate student. If you're already dialing
the authorities, please put the phone down. Read
the rest of the column. I'm going to make the case
that Sketchy Grads are not the child-molesting psy
chopaths you might think. Rather, that Sketchy
Grads are people too.
So what is the general reaction to a "Sketchy
Grad?" In my experience, there is a universe of
three. Let's suppose I'm at a pre-party hosted by
some current seniors 1 know from my undergrad
days. Let's further suppose that I've been drinking
(this is not a stretch). Now, let's suppose I meet
someone and tell them that I graduated in 2004.
Here's what happens:
I'm talking to a...
Freshmen or Sophomore Girl: Horror. Their
complete isolation in the undergraduate bubble is
momentarily compromised. They bat their eyes in
disbelief and conduct a desperate mental search for
escape procedure — why wasn't this covered in
Orientation?
Junior or Senior Girl: Skeptical intrigue.They're
tired of dates to Moonbeans. But at the same time,
what the hell am I doing at a place where I could
possibly meet them?
Undergraduate Male: Confusion. I'm on marked
territory. Can 1 get them a job in I-banking? Yes?
Either way, I should go back to where I came from.
Okay, so I know this is an over-generalization.
But it's there. We all know the stigma exists. And it's
time to heal the wounds. Here's my case for why
the "Sketchy Grad" isn't so sketchy after all.
For one, grads often have friends who are still
undergrads. In my case, I graduated in 2004, which
means that I still know many juniors and seniors on
campus. Grads want to see these people. They like
them. And grads may even be friends of your
friends. I hey do not necessarily hail from some un
known netherworld of desperation and solitude\
But even if you don't buy the notion that grads
are "friends of the program," a little reciprocation
might still be in order. "Wha...!?," you say. Yes, it's
true. Believe it or not, we have, at times, seen scores
of undergrads showing up rather cleverly to GSB
parties, lliey happen to "already be at" to our bar
nights in Palo Alto or "stumble upon" our house
parties buried in the un-Googleable bowels of
Atherton. Yet we enjoy having you there,so long as
you don't have the PoPo in tow.
Second, let's just be realistic. 1 still remember the
calamity of grads poaching the finest our under
grad class had to offer. Now I know why. I'm 23,and
this is Palo Alto. The Cougars at Nola's just aren't
gonna cut it. I've heard the bartenders at The 750
laughing weeks later about a grad event that drew
80 percent dudes.
Finally, and most importantly, undergrads be
come grads. That means that the undergrads of
today will be tying their graduate boots tight to
morrow. It's just a matter of time. The one thing that
never changes is that there is always a fresh crop of
undergrads. Whether a newly minted co-term or a
geezer at the 50-year homecoming reunion, you'll
want to smile or say,"Hi" to the youngun's.The un
dergrads are the lifeblood of Stanford, and gradu
ates like to occasionally connect back, believe it or
not, often without the intention of hitting on them.
That brings us full circle to the greatest Stanford
tradition of all — Full Moon on the Quad. I can re
port that there were, ia fact, numerous grads and
alumni among your ranks. Hell, not even just dudes,
I saw alumni women from the area partaking in the
tradition. It happens. As for me and my Full Moon
number, or absence of a number, that will remain in
the vault for now. But hopefully you wouldn't mind
that much either way.
So let's all show a little love. After all, that's what
Stanford is all about. In the words of Ari Gold,
"Let's hug it out bitch."

this is Palo Alto. The Cougars at Nola's just aren't
gonna cut it. I've heard the bartenders at The 750
laughing weeks later about a grad event that drew
80 percent dudes.
Finally, and most importantly, undergrads be
come grads. That means that the undergrads of
today will be tying their graduate boots tight to
morrow. It's just a matter of time. The one thing that
never changes is that there is always a fresh crop of
undergrads. Whether a newly minted co-term or a
geezer at the 50-year homecoming reunion, you'll
want to smile or say,"Hi" to the youngun's.The un
dergrads are the lifeblood of Stanford, and gradu
ates like to occasionally connect back, believe it or
not, often without the intention of hitting on them.
That brings us full circle to the greatest Stanford
tradition of all — Full Moon on the Quad. I can re
port that there were, ia fact, numerous grads and
alumni among your ranks. Hell, not even just dudes,
I saw alumni women from the area partaking in the
tradition. It happens. As for me and my Full Moon
number, or absence of a number, that will remain in
the vault for now. But hopefully you wouldn't mind
that much either way.
So let's all show a little love. After all, that's what
Stanford is all about. In the words of Ari Gold,
"Let's hug it out bitch."

With Full Moon on the Quad in all-too-re
cent memory, a discussion regarding the
campus notion of "Sketchy Grads" is
timely. I started as a graduate student this fall and
have found the "Sketchy Grad" stigma rather un
propitious. In what context, you might ask? You
may want to sit down before you read this — but
I've been to an undergrad event or two since I start
ed as a graduate student. If you're already dialing
the authorities, please put the phone down. Read
the rest of the column. I'm going to make the case
that Sketchy Grads are not the child-molesting psy
chopaths you might think. Rather, that Sketchy
Grads are people too.
So what is the general reaction to a "Sketchy
Grad?" In my experience, there is a universe of
three. Let's suppose I'm at a pre-party hosted by
some current seniors 1 know from my undergrad
days. Let's further suppose that I've been drinking
(this is not a stretch). Now, let's suppose I meet
someone and tell them that I graduated in 2004.
Here's what happens:
I'm talking to a...
Freshmen or Sophomore Girl: Horror. Their
complete isolation in the undergraduate bubble is
momentarily compromised. They bat their eyes in
disbelief and conduct a desperate mental search for
escape procedure — why wasn't this covered in
Orientation?
Junior or Senior Girl: Skeptical intrigue.They're
tired of dates to Moonbeans. But at the same time,
what the hell am I doing at a place where I could
possibly meet them?
Undergraduate Male: Confusion. I'm on marked
territory. Can 1 get them a job in I-banking? Yes?
Either way, I should go back to where I came from.
Okay, so I know this is an over-generalization.
But it's there. We all know the stigma exists. And it's
time to heal the wounds. Here's my case for why
the "Sketchy Grad" isn't so sketchy after all.
For one, grads often have friends who are still
undergrads. In my case, I graduated in 2004, which
means that I still know many juniors and seniors on
campus. Grads want to see these people. They like
them. And grads may even be friends of your
friends. I hey do not necessarily hail from some un
known netherworld of desperation and solitude\
But even if you don't buy the notion that grads
are "friends of the program," a little reciprocation
might still be in order. "Wha...!?," you say. Yes, it's
true. Believe it or not, we have, at times, seen scores
of undergrads showing up rather cleverly to GSB
parties, lliey happen to "already be at" to our bar
nights in Palo Alto or "stumble upon" our house
parties buried in the un-Googleable bowels of
Atherton. Yet we enjoy having you there,so long as
you don't have the PoPo in tow.
Second, let's just be realistic. 1 still remember the
calamity of grads poaching the finest our under
grad class had to offer. Now I know why. I'm 23,and
this is Palo Alto. The Cougars at Nola's just aren't
gonna cut it. I've heard the bartenders at The 750
laughing weeks later about a grad event that drew
80 percent dudes.
