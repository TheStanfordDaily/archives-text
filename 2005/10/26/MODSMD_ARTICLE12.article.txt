Meet Moise, a 6-year-old chocolate
Labrador retriever. liven though
Moise has four feet instead of two and
furry paws, it doesn't stop him from
participating in extracurricular activi
ties at Stanford.
Moise is a member of GSB Dogs, a
student organization at the Graduate
School of Business that acts as a sup
port network for Stanford Business
School students who love their hounds.
Many graduate students who have
dogs worry that they will not be able to
find canine-friendly housing when
they move to Stanford, says Laura
Beaudin, a second-year MBA student
who is the proud owner of Moise
Moses in French. Beaudin is one of the
co-presidents of GSB Dogs.
Although there are many pet lovers
on campus, Stanford does not allow
any students to keep animal friends in
University housing.
"Keeping pets of any kind — in
cluding fish and caged animals — in or
about University residences is prohib
ited." says the Stanford I lousing Web
site. "If you are found to have a pet,
you will be charged $100 per day from
the date of discovery until it is perma
nently removed from campus."
The site adds that if a student vio
lates this rule more than once, housing
services may revoke his or her resi
dence privileges.
That none of Stanford's on-campus
housing allows pets is a major concern
for many people, Beaudin says.
So, GSB Dogs comes to the rescue
by helping students find off-campus
housing that accommodates pups.
"The club fulfills two purposes —
helping people find housing and find
ing a suppoit network of fellow dog
owners who can help out when some
one's out of town," Beaudin explains.
Lisa Vollmer and her husband, a
student at the (JSB. say they welcome
this assistance.

"We were moving from Dallas for
the Stanford program and had a dog,"
Vollmer says."It was definitely a con
cern for us whether we could bring our
dog. The club was a great first contact
for how I could rent an apartment."
So fond of GSB Dogs is Vollmer
that she has served as co-president for
two years in a row.
GSB Dogs has about 50 members,
some of whom have no pets at all, ac
cording to the co-presidents.
"Even people who don't even own
dogs come to our events just to hang
out," Beaudin says.
The club organizes informal and re
laxed outings such as short walks, hikes
and trips to off-leash dog parks. These
events are open to all GSB Dogs mem
bers.
"It's a great way to combine dog
outings with other people," Vollmer
says.
And the dogs enjoy themselves,
too.
Vollmer says that in last Spring's
final club event, the dogs swiped all the
bagels meant for the owners.
"[The dogs] sometimes run the
show," Vollmer remarks.
The GSB attracts students with di
verse backgrounds in languages, cul
tures, ethnicities and religions, and with
that comes an eclectic mixture of dogs.
"We had about 10 dogs come to our
first event — all of different sizes,
breeds and even all different lan
guages," Beaudin says, explaining that
some of the dogs respond to French.
"For others, it is Portuguese or
Spanish," she continues.
For group cohesion and increased
socializing and networking opportuni
ties, former presidents of GSB Dogs
created a "Dog Facebook" — no, not
on Facebook.com — that club mem
bers can use to look up dogs and their
respective owners.
