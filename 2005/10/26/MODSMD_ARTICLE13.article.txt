Reunion Homecoming.To students carry
ing heavy backpacks and the weight of
midterms, it looks like a big. ridiculous party
featuring gray-hairs laughing and reminisc
ing on every open piece of Stanford lawn. For
alumni, it's a time to relax, pretend they're in
college again and spend some time in the
California sun.
But for Class of 2000 graduates Will
Chancellor and Borut Grigic. last weekend's
reunion was not all fun and games. Chancel
lor, a science and philosophy teacher in New
York, and Grigic. senior policy adviser to the
president and foreign minister of Slovenia,
focused their energies on recruiting support
for "Back-2-School," a project to rebuild
schools in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan.

The two close friends devised the idea
when they spoke on the phone a few weeks
before the reunion.
"We were talking about what a great time
it was to go back to Stanford," Grigic recalls.
"Then one of us said. Did you hear about
Pakistan?"
Grigic refers to an earthquake of 7.6 mag
nitude that shook Pakistan on Oct. 8, severely
damaging Muzaffarabad. I\vo-thirds of the
city has been left in ruins and some estimate
that 30,000 to 40,000 people have died, accord
ing to this week's edition of The Economist.
"The fond memories of Stanford juxta
posed with the trauma in Pakistan made us
want to do something," Chancellor says.
Because Pakistan's population is relative
ly young, many of those affected were chil
dren and some schools have become mass

graves. At one girls' school in Muzaffarabad.
60 children died, buried in the ruins. Many
have also been separated from their families.
Grigic and Chancellor's "Back-2-School"
initiative calls fora Stanford-led program to
help rebuild primary schools in Muzaf
farabad. They plan to form a steering com
mittee of Stanford faculty, alumni and ad
ministration to raise funds and build the pro
gram's agenda.
"There are 1,000 needs worth pursuing in
Pakistan," Chancellor says. "Stanford should
pursue something to do with school —
school helping school."
Using help from the United Nations Edu
cation. Scientific and Cultural Association,
the United Nations Children's Fund and
other aid organizations, this steering commit
tee would assess the situation in Pakistan and

determine how Stanford can help. Depend
ing on the resources available. Grigic and
Chancellor hope to send on-ground assess
ment teams, coordinators, education special
ists and clinical psychologists to Muzaf
farabad to help.
Grigic and Chancellor say they want the
reaction to be pointed and specific.
"American philanthropy is based on an
individual's donation," Grigic says. "Howev
er. Stanford has the unique capacity to make
a goal-oriented, organized response."
Currently, most relief efforts in Pakistan
are focused on humanitarian aid. Pakistan
Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz has stated that
foreign assistance for now should focus on
food, tents, blankets, medical supplies and
engineering equipment. Aid workers are es
pecially worried about the water supply, the

sewage system and the spread of disease.
However, Grigic contends that most aid
organizations are not effective after immedi
ate concerns have been addressed.
"Once the humanitarian effort is done,
the rest of the relief is bureaucratized and too
few things get done," Grigic says. "ITiis is an
opportunity for Stanford to step in and take
a leadership role."
After meeting briefly with Grigic and
Chancellor on Sunday. Alumni Association
President Howard Wolf says he hopes to talk
with them more extensively next week.
"The response we provide to Pakistan will
depend on the response of the Stanford com
munity." Chancellor says.

damaging Muzaffarabad. I\vo-thirds of the
city has been left in ruins and some estimate
that 30,000 to 40,000 people have died, accord
ing to this week's edition of The Economist.
"The fond memories of Stanford juxta
posed with the trauma in Pakistan made us
want to do something," Chancellor says.
Because Pakistan's population is relative
ly young, many of those affected were chil
dren and some schools have become mass

graves. At one girls' school in Muzaffarabad.
60 children died, buried in the ruins. Many
have also been separated from their families.
Grigic and Chancellor's "Back-2-School"
initiative calls fora Stanford-led program to
help rebuild primary schools in Muzaf
farabad. They plan to form a steering com
mittee of Stanford faculty, alumni and ad
ministration to raise funds and build the pro
gram's agenda.
"There are 1,000 needs worth pursuing in
Pakistan," Chancellor says. "Stanford should
pursue something to do with school —
school helping school."
Using help from the United Nations Edu
cation. Scientific and Cultural Association,
the United Nations Children's Fund and
other aid organizations, this steering commit
tee would assess the situation in Pakistan and

determine how Stanford can help. Depend
ing on the resources available. Grigic and
Chancellor hope to send on-ground assess
ment teams, coordinators, education special
ists and clinical psychologists to Muzaf
farabad to help.
Grigic and Chancellor say they want the
reaction to be pointed and specific.
"American philanthropy is based on an
individual's donation," Grigic says. "Howev
er. Stanford has the unique capacity to make
a goal-oriented, organized response."
Currently, most relief efforts in Pakistan
are focused on humanitarian aid. Pakistan
Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz has stated that
foreign assistance for now should focus on
food, tents, blankets, medical supplies and
engineering equipment. Aid workers are es
pecially worried about the water supply, the

sewage system and the spread of disease.
However, Grigic contends that most aid
organizations are not effective after immedi
ate concerns have been addressed.
"Once the humanitarian effort is done,
the rest of the relief is bureaucratized and too
few things get done," Grigic says. "ITiis is an
opportunity for Stanford to step in and take
a leadership role."
After meeting briefly with Grigic and
Chancellor on Sunday. Alumni Association
President Howard Wolf says he hopes to talk
with them more extensively next week.
"The response we provide to Pakistan will
depend on the response of the Stanford com
munity." Chancellor says.
