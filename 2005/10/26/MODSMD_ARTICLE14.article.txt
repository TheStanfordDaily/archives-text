## Editorial Reliance on SAT should be studied 
### 
For decades the SAT has been the gate
keeper for admission to elite colleges
and universities. Testing advocates as
sert that the SAT levels the college admis
sions playing field and provides schools with
a uniform standard by which to judge their
applicants. However, evidence indicates that
the SAT is not the "great equalizer" that its
proponents have long claimed.
Research conducted by Educational
Testing Services (ETS), the company that
creates the SAT, has demonstrated that the
test consistently underpredicts the grades of
women and certain minority groups. One
study found that on average the SAT over
predicts males' grades by more than a tenth
of a point and underpredicts females' grades
by an even greater amount. In fact, males av
erage 42 points higher than females on the
SAT, yet receive lower grades in both high
school and college. So far, ETS has yet to
offer an explanation for why the test creates
this discrepancy.
The validity of the test is even more ques
tionable in a socioeconomic context. On the
2004 SAT, students whose families earned
over $100,000 per year scored an average of
1115 on the SAT, while those whose families
earned less than $10,000 per year averaged
only 872.
Certainly the quality of elementary and
secondary schools that students attend has a
significant impact on their SAT scores, and
this likely explains some of the discrepancy in
scores. However, the test is not taken in a vac
uum: many students also bolster their scores
by taking preparation courses. Such courses
are both effective (boasting average improve
ments of around 150 points) and expensive
(costing nearly $1,000 at companies such as
the Princeton Review). It seems somewhat
naive to view the SAT as a means of truly lev
eling the playing field when students from
more privileged backgrounds can use their
economic resources to raise their scores.
Modifications to the SAT's format,
which took effect this past March, have
made these fairness issues even more
salient.The biggest change is the addition of
an essay section designed to assess students'
writing skills. Although such skills are unde
niably important, testing experts have
raised concerns about whether in practice
the essay will provide a fair assessment of
these skills. Graders will typically spend less
than three minutes scoring each essay and
tend to give more emphasis to sheer length
than any other variable.
Certainly, there are compelling arguments
for continuing to use the SAT. No other tool
exists to allow college admissions officers to
compare students from vastly different back
grounds. Given the variation in high schools'
curricula, grades and class rank can offer only

so much information. And, at schools such at
Stanford that receive upwards of 20,000 ap
plicants each year, the SAT provides a way to
screen applicants efficiently, thereby keeping
administrative costs relatively low.
However, the question remains whether
these arguments for using the SAT outweigh
the many serious concerns about the test's
fairness.
Over 400 colleges and universities nation
wide have made the decision either to make
submission of SAT scores optional or to elim
inate the test as a factor in the admissions
process. Administrators at these schools say
that these policies have made little difference
in the quality of students they attract. At
Bates College, where the SAT has been op
tional for over 20 years, a study found that the
difference between the GPAs of students
who chose to submit SAT scores and those
who chose not to submit was statistically in
significant, as was the difference in gradua
tion rates for the two groups.
Given these serious concerns about the
SAT, we believe that it is appropriate for
Stanford to compile and publicize data about
the impact of the test on the admissions
process. Moreover, the University should
also examine how well the test predicts stu
dents' academic success once they are en
rolled at Stanford.
Perhaps SAT scores predict grades more
accurately at a university such as Stanford,
where the admissions process is extremely
competitive, than at the small liberal arts
colleges that have made submission of
scores optional. If this is true, it argues in
favor of the SAT remaining part of the ad
missions process.
If, on the other hand, the SAT consistently
underpredicts GPAs for female, minority or
low income students at Stanford and adds lit
tle to the accuracy of admissions decisions, the
University should reevaluate the role of the
SAT in its admissions process.
In its effort to increase economic diversity,
the University must consider admissions and
academic changes as well as financial aid
ones, even if those changes involve reevaluat
ing longstanding reliance on the SAT. An as
sessment that is biased against students from
particular socioeconomic groups should not
be part of the admissions process.
Only careful research can determine
whether the SAT continues to be a fair and
useful assessment. However, given the steadi
ly accumulating evidence that calls the test's
validity into question, the University and the
Admissions Office should not rely on tradi
tion or convenience to justify the continued
use of the SAT. Only by carefully evaluating
its admissions tools can the University contin
ue to ensure that it attracts the most highly
qualified student body.

a uniform standard by which to judge their
applicants. However, evidence indicates that
the SAT is not the "great equalizer" that its
proponents have long claimed.
Research conducted by Educational
Testing Services (ETS), the company that
creates the SAT, has demonstrated that the
test consistently underpredicts the grades of
women and certain minority groups. One
study found that on average the SAT over
predicts males' grades by more than a tenth
of a point and underpredicts females' grades
by an even greater amount. In fact, males av
erage 42 points higher than females on the
SAT, yet receive lower grades in both high
school and college. So far, ETS has yet to
offer an explanation for why the test creates
this discrepancy.
The validity of the test is even more ques
tionable in a socioeconomic context. On the
2004 SAT, students whose families earned
over $100,000 per year scored an average of
1115 on the SAT, while those whose families
earned less than $10,000 per year averaged
only 872.
Certainly the quality of elementary and
secondary schools that students attend has a
significant impact on their SAT scores, and
this likely explains some of the discrepancy in
scores. However, the test is not taken in a vac
uum: many students also bolster their scores
by taking preparation courses. Such courses
are both effective (boasting average improve
ments of around 150 points) and expensive
(costing nearly $1,000 at companies such as
the Princeton Review). It seems somewhat
naive to view the SAT as a means of truly lev
eling the playing field when students from
more privileged backgrounds can use their
economic resources to raise their scores.
Modifications to the SAT's format,
which took effect this past March, have
made these fairness issues even more
salient.The biggest change is the addition of
an essay section designed to assess students'
writing skills. Although such skills are unde
niably important, testing experts have
raised concerns about whether in practice
the essay will provide a fair assessment of
these skills. Graders will typically spend less
than three minutes scoring each essay and
tend to give more emphasis to sheer length
than any other variable.
Certainly, there are compelling arguments
for continuing to use the SAT. No other tool
exists to allow college admissions officers to
compare students from vastly different back
grounds. Given the variation in high schools'
curricula, grades and class rank can offer only

so much information. And, at schools such at
Stanford that receive upwards of 20,000 ap
plicants each year, the SAT provides a way to
screen applicants efficiently, thereby keeping
administrative costs relatively low.
However, the question remains whether
these arguments for using the SAT outweigh
the many serious concerns about the test's
fairness.
Over 400 colleges and universities nation
wide have made the decision either to make
submission of SAT scores optional or to elim
inate the test as a factor in the admissions
process. Administrators at these schools say
that these policies have made little difference
in the quality of students they attract. At
Bates College, where the SAT has been op
tional for over 20 years, a study found that the
difference between the GPAs of students
who chose to submit SAT scores and those
who chose not to submit was statistically in
significant, as was the difference in gradua
tion rates for the two groups.
Given these serious concerns about the
SAT, we believe that it is appropriate for
Stanford to compile and publicize data about
the impact of the test on the admissions
process. Moreover, the University should
also examine how well the test predicts stu
dents' academic success once they are en
rolled at Stanford.
Perhaps SAT scores predict grades more
accurately at a university such as Stanford,
where the admissions process is extremely
competitive, than at the small liberal arts
colleges that have made submission of
scores optional. If this is true, it argues in
favor of the SAT remaining part of the ad
missions process.
If, on the other hand, the SAT consistently
underpredicts GPAs for female, minority or
low income students at Stanford and adds lit
tle to the accuracy of admissions decisions, the
University should reevaluate the role of the
SAT in its admissions process.
In its effort to increase economic diversity,
the University must consider admissions and
academic changes as well as financial aid
ones, even if those changes involve reevaluat
ing longstanding reliance on the SAT. An as
sessment that is biased against students from
particular socioeconomic groups should not
be part of the admissions process.
Only careful research can determine
whether the SAT continues to be a fair and
useful assessment. However, given the steadi
ly accumulating evidence that calls the test's
validity into question, the University and the
Admissions Office should not rely on tradi
tion or convenience to justify the continued
use of the SAT. Only by carefully evaluating
its admissions tools can the University contin
ue to ensure that it attracts the most highly
qualified student body.
