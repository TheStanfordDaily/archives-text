Frost makes more sense
I, too, would protest the limiting of fam
ily members at the graduation ceremonies
(as ordained by selection of Frost), except
I've experienced graduations in both
places — Frost (my own), the stadium (my
son's). I have a first-hand visualization of
the difference.
For four of your relatives (and more for
those with friends not needing four tickets),
Frost is a dramatically more intimate setting
for students and family. Frankly, from the
family's point of view, the stadium is worse
than watching on TV. Family members are
so disconnected from the graduates that it is
as warm and personal as any football game.
The acoustics are poor.The stadium is a joke
for spectators. I challenge anyone who has
experienced graduation in both places to se
lect the stadium over Frost, even given the
ticket limitation.
The real connection between graduate
and family is in the departmental ceremony.
That's where the students' names are read
with the title of their papers, with the family
cheering, etc. Your family can actually see
your face, your smile, your joy.
Yes, the selection process may look like
disdain for the wishes of the seniors and that
would make anyone mad. The administra
tion's experience with graduation works
both ways.They are not careless about it. but
they are also not naive.
If you are truly concerned about the ex
perience your closest supporters will have,
Frost beats Roble field or any field (imagine
the site lines!). Indeed, a field would more
closely mimic the stadium with its imperson
al, poor-visibility environment.
Take a deep breath and look at the whole
graduation program. If family is really your
priority, then this decision is by far the best.
The departmental ceremonies are the mem
orable ones. Believe me, the stadium, al
though now traditional, is the worst gradua
tion spot I've ever experienced. Ivy league
and West Coast.
Ask the detractors about their own Stan
ford graduation experiences before you get

behind their arguments. Are these argu
ments coming from knowledge or guessing?
By the way, there is another solution:
coterm!

Decision should have been public
Although I understand that Stanford is
undergoing many changes, I am absolutely
shocked that the University administration
has chosen a venue that requires that we
limit our Commencement invitations. I do
not believe that the "aesthetics, accessibility,
comfort, cost-effectiveness and history" of
Frost Amphitheater outweigh the fact that
our families — who have supported us
throughout our college careers, who have
planned for the past four years to attend our
graduation ceremony and who have paid a
great deal of money to Stanford — will be
unable to see us graduate.
A decision of this magnitude should have
been raised in a public arena, not in an e
mail just prior to publicizing the change in
Commencement locations. This issue can
not be decided behind closed doors because
it does not just concern the administration
and the presidents of the senior class. This
matter affects all members of the senior
class, the families of graduating students
and concerned alumni.

Policy isn't fair to larger families
I wish to express my deep disappoint
ment in the administration for their decision
to conduct the 2006 graduation ceremony in
Frost Amphitheater with a limit of four
guests per senior, despite alternative venues
that would allow for more guests. For all the
time, money, sacrifice, sweat and tears that
we and our families have invested in our
Stanford education, we've earned more than
one guest per year here at Stanford.
First of all, capping the number of
guests at four clearly discriminates
against students with large families.
My parents are both remarried with
children, meaning I have four par
ents, not two. A limit of four guests is
a completely inadequate number to
accommodate the variety of family
arrangements that students have on
this campus.
Second, a limit of four guests im
mediately rules out the possibility of
almost anyone's extended family at
tending Commencement. In my
case, the limit excludes my grand
parents, who have put several thou
sand dollars towards tuition in order
to enable me to reach graduation at
Stanford. How do 1 tell them that
despite their support, they just don't
make the cut? There are many more
than four people who have played
an irreplaceable role in my time at
Stanford. It is offensive, disrespect

ful and unacceptable to make us
limit our graduation guest lists to
four and then relegate "less impor
tant" family members to a television
screen. This policy doesn't work for
anyone.
Finally, this policy explicitly de
nies the wishes of the senior class to
accommodate as many guests as
possible. Last week, I sat through a
mandatory orientation for the
Nominations Committee and lis
tened to University officials like
Nanci Howe, the director of student
activities, repeat how uniquely val
ued student input is to Stanford
University. Seniors want our fami
lies to be welcomed by the Univer
sity, not disrespected.To the admin
istration, I ask, do you have our best
interests in mind? If you do, and you
care about student opinion, as
you've claimed, then let your ac
tions back up your words. It is a big
mistake to assume that another
party is going to make up for the
loss of our families' presence at
graduation. We want our families to
be there no matter what.

Frost makes more sense
I, too, would protest the limiting of fam
ily members at the graduation ceremonies
(as ordained by selection of Frost), except
I've experienced graduations in both
places — Frost (my own), the stadium (my
son's). I have a first-hand visualization of
the difference.
For four of your relatives (and more for
those with friends not needing four tickets),
Frost is a dramatically more intimate setting
for students and family. Frankly, from the
family's point of view, the stadium is worse
than watching on TV. Family members are
so disconnected from the graduates that it is
as warm and personal as any football game.
The acoustics are poor.The stadium is a joke
for spectators. I challenge anyone who has
experienced graduation in both places to se
lect the stadium over Frost, even given the
ticket limitation.
The real connection between graduate
and family is in the departmental ceremony.
That's where the students' names are read
with the title of their papers, with the family
cheering, etc. Your family can actually see
your face, your smile, your joy.
Yes, the selection process may look like
disdain for the wishes of the seniors and that
would make anyone mad. The administra
tion's experience with graduation works
both ways.They are not careless about it. but
they are also not naive.
If you are truly concerned about the ex
perience your closest supporters will have,
Frost beats Roble field or any field (imagine
the site lines!). Indeed, a field would more
closely mimic the stadium with its imperson
al, poor-visibility environment.
Take a deep breath and look at the whole
graduation program. If family is really your
priority, then this decision is by far the best.
The departmental ceremonies are the mem
orable ones. Believe me, the stadium, al
though now traditional, is the worst gradua
tion spot I've ever experienced. Ivy league
and West Coast.
Ask the detractors about their own Stan
ford graduation experiences before you get

behind their arguments. Are these argu
ments coming from knowledge or guessing?
By the way, there is another solution:
coterm!

Decision should have been public
Although I understand that Stanford is
undergoing many changes, I am absolutely
shocked that the University administration
has chosen a venue that requires that we
limit our Commencement invitations. I do
not believe that the "aesthetics, accessibility,
comfort, cost-effectiveness and history" of
Frost Amphitheater outweigh the fact that
our families — who have supported us
throughout our college careers, who have
planned for the past four years to attend our
graduation ceremony and who have paid a
great deal of money to Stanford — will be
unable to see us graduate.
A decision of this magnitude should have
been raised in a public arena, not in an e
mail just prior to publicizing the change in
Commencement locations. This issue can
not be decided behind closed doors because
it does not just concern the administration
and the presidents of the senior class. This
matter affects all members of the senior
class, the families of graduating students
and concerned alumni.

Policy isn't fair to larger families
I wish to express my deep disappoint
ment in the administration for their decision
to conduct the 2006 graduation ceremony in
Frost Amphitheater with a limit of four
guests per senior, despite alternative venues
that would allow for more guests. For all the
time, money, sacrifice, sweat and tears that
we and our families have invested in our
Stanford education, we've earned more than
one guest per year here at Stanford.
First of all, capping the number of
guests at four clearly discriminates
against students with large families.
My parents are both remarried with
children, meaning I have four par
ents, not two. A limit of four guests is
a completely inadequate number to
accommodate the variety of family
arrangements that students have on
this campus.
Second, a limit of four guests im
mediately rules out the possibility of
almost anyone's extended family at
tending Commencement. In my
case, the limit excludes my grand
parents, who have put several thou
sand dollars towards tuition in order
to enable me to reach graduation at
Stanford. How do 1 tell them that
despite their support, they just don't
make the cut? There are many more
than four people who have played
an irreplaceable role in my time at
Stanford. It is offensive, disrespect

ful and unacceptable to make us
limit our graduation guest lists to
four and then relegate "less impor
tant" family members to a television
screen. This policy doesn't work for
anyone.
Finally, this policy explicitly de
nies the wishes of the senior class to
