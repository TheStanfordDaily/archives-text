# Don't sell out, come out
## 
### 
The other day I got an e-mail from some
one by the name of Alhaji Ahmad
Bello who is apparently a "bank man
ager" at one of the "leading banks" in Dakar,
Senegal. He informed me that a wealthy in
vestor from the U.K. had made a number of
cash deposits into his bank totaling $20 million
right before he died in a bizarre plane crash.
Unfortunately, the investor didn't have a will
and had no friends or family with attachments
to him or his huge sums of money.
Now, I'm not a math major, but 1 figured
that at my current research assistantship
wage of $20 an hour, I would have to work
roughly one million hours to earn that much
money (equivalent to roughly half the time it
will take me to finish my Ph.D.). Or, as Alha
ji Ahmad Bello suggested, I could inherit this
money through international law by simply
providing my full name, address and a bank
account number for them to deposit the
funds. It seemed so simple. "Nothing can go
wrong with this plan!" I exclaimed (but not
too loudly, as I didn't want my fellow money
grubbing School of Education classmates to
hear of my good fortune and trv to e-mail Al

haji Ahmad Bello directly).
I quickly realized that I didn't have my
bank account number memorized and 1 had to
catch a lunch date with a hot Norwegian inter
national student named "Anders" that's been
repeatedly poking me on the Facebook. so 1
quietly left the CERAS computer lab, anxious
to return and complete the simple, yet highly
profitable transaction.
My lunch date with Anders was a com
plete disaster. First off, he looked nothing like
the muscular hottie that 1 had seen on the
Facebook (I quickly realized the problem
was that I had been toggling back and forth
between the Facebook and
belamionline.com, and somehow confused

the dorky electrical engineering student with
a hot, muscular model from Finland who was
actually named "Seppo"). Secondly, I could
n't contain my excitement, and I accidentally
shared my good news with Anders,since I fig
ured he probably didn't know that many 25-
year-old Ph.D. students that were also multi
millionaires. To my dismay, Anders pointed
at me and laughed in my face. Apparently he
thought that Alhaji Ahmad Bello wasn't a le
gitimate banker, but was in fact a scam artist
attempting to steal my identity!
I thanked Anders for my low-calorie
Berry Fulfilling Jamba Juice and told him I
had to get going. For the life of me, I couldn't
figure out why Alhaji Ahmad Bello would
want to steal my identity. Why would he want
to be a gay Native American graduate stu
dent? I mean, there are just so many other
people with glamorous identities, what made
mine so special?
My confusion made it as far as White
Plaza before 1 ran into some friends that were
gathered for the National Coming Out Day

Homosaywhat?
celebration. 1 had forgotten that it
was already mid-October and that
just four years ago, 1 sent an e-mail to
90 of my closest friends with the sub
ject: "I'm Gay." Yes, I came out over
e-mail; 1 was afraid of how my
friends and family would respond,
and 1 didn't want to show favoritism
among them by telling certain peo
ple before others. National Coming
Out Day provided an impetus for me
to send the e-mail because it was a
date that had passed me year after
year, and, the procrastinator that I
am, I kept putting it off, attempting
to be straight before I finally recog
nized and embraced my identity as a
gay guy.
Again this year, the day has special
significance because it reminds me
that 1 cannot take for granted the per
son that I have become, or the path I
took to get here. I jokingly tell my

closest friends that I believe "some
people are gay; others are just un
lucky."
TTie process of coming out forced
me to think critically about my identi
ty, and it compelled me to take
healthy steps toward self-acceptance
and social affirmation. I know that
many straight people also take simi
lar steps, but they are often supported
by a taken-for-granted public accept
ance that approves of heterosexuality
without much of a spectacle. For
those of us whose lifestyle is a little
more taboo, coming out represents
more than a public announcement of
sexual preference. Among other
things, it stands for the process of self
discovery, as well as the acknowl
edgement and support of a personal
identity in its entirety.
So I can understand why Alhaji
Ahmad Bello wants to steal my iden
tity. It's valuable. But sorry, Mr.
Bello, it's not for sale (not even for
$20 million).
