# Don't sell out, come out

### 
The other day I got an e-mail from some
one by the name of Alhaji Ahmad
Bello who is apparently a "bank man
ager" at one of the "leading banks" in Dakar,
Senegal. He informed me that a wealthy in
vestor from the U.K. had made a number of
cash deposits into his bank totaling $20 million
right before he died in a bizarre plane crash.
Unfortunately, the investor didn't have a will
and had no friends or family with attachments
to him or his huge sums of money.
Now, I'm not a math major, but 1 figured
that at my current research assistantship
wage of $20 an hour, I would have to work
roughly one million hours to earn that much
money (equivalent to roughly half the time it
will take me to finish my Ph.D.). Or, as Alha
ji Ahmad Bello suggested, I could inherit this
money through international law by simply
providing my full name, address and a bank
account number for them to deposit the
funds. It seemed so simple. "Nothing can go
wrong with this plan!" I exclaimed (but not
too loudly, as I didn't want my fellow money
grubbing School of Education classmates to
hear of my good fortune and trv to e-mail Al

haji Ahmad Bello directly).
I quickly realized that I didn't have my
bank account number memorized and 1 had to
catch a lunch date with a hot Norwegian inter
national student named "Anders" that's been
repeatedly poking me on the Facebook. so 1
quietly left the CERAS computer lab, anxious
to return and complete the simple, yet highly
profitable transaction.
My lunch date with Anders was a com
plete disaster. First off, he looked nothing like
the muscular hottie that 1 had seen on the
Facebook (I quickly realized the problem
was that I had been toggling back and forth
between the Facebook and
belamionline.com, and somehow confused

the dorky electrical engineering student with
a hot, muscular model from Finland who was
actually named "Seppo"). Secondly, I could
n't contain my excitement, and I accidentally
shared my good news with Anders,since I fig
ured he probably didn't know that many 25-
year-old Ph.D. students that were also multi
millionaires. To my dismay, Anders pointed
at me and laughed in my face. Apparently he
thought that Alhaji Ahmad Bello wasn't a le
gitimate banker, but was in fact a scam artist
attempting to steal my identity!
I thanked Anders for my low-calorie
Berry Fulfilling Jamba Juice and told him I
had to get going. For the life of me, I couldn't
figure out why Alhaji Ahmad Bello would
want to steal my identity. Why would he want
to be a gay Native American graduate stu
dent? I mean, there are just so many other
people with glamorous identities, what made
mine so special?
My confusion made it as far as White
Plaza before 1 ran into some friends that were
gathered for the National Coming Out Day
