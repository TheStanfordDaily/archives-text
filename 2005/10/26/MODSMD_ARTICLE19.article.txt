# The 						crowd is as tasty as the food
## 
### 
Every week I dine at least once in each
of campus's hottest locations: the
Business School and the Law School.
Why are these spots such desirable
lunching venues? Well it's not because of the
food (though the parmesan chicken sand
wich at the B-school is very, very good). Nor
is it because of the stirring architecture or
flawless service. No, like so many great
eateries, these two are wonderful places to
see and to be seen.
It's perhaps going a little far to claim
everyone goes with the intention of either
putting themselves on display or of ogling the
rest of the clientele. Nevertheless, there's al
ways something to see.
The spectacle is somewhat less, well, spec
tacular at the Law School. In fact, at first
glance the cafeteria patrons there seem little
different from anywhere else on campus.
Close examination, though, reveals a lit
tle more polish than one might have expect
ed from students — there's hardly a hoodie
in sight and untucked shirts are few and far
between. It's walking into the Arbuckle
Cafe, however, that takes ?polish? to whole
new level.
It's as if you've entered the secret world of
catalogue models. Yes, that?s right, when not
showing off Macy's latest fall line, the per
fectly coiffed set hangs out in the GSB.

Now, make no mistake, this is not simply a
case of better looks at the B-School. No, this
is so much more. To be honest, l?m not even
sure that those soon-to-be Masters of the
Universe are intrinsically prettier than your
typical electrical engineer (remember, I did
say Macy's. not Abercrombie and Fitch).
No, rather than beauty, what marks the
MBA folks out from the crowd is prepara
tion.Their clothes are ironed. Let me say that
again: ironed. Who irons their clothes to go to
school? Personally, when I crawl out of bed in
the morning it's as much as I can manage to
find clothes; ironing is a whole other world.
Furthermore, everyone seems to be well
produced as well. Hair is fixed in place, make
up is artfully applied and faces universally
show the kind of natural, healthy glow that
can only come out of a bottle.
Of course, it's not just the fact that every
one's well turned out that sets up the model

ing aura. They pose as well. Presumably not
intentionally, but it seems that in whatever di
rection you look you?re met with a tableau
that just screams "buy this shirt."
In fact, everyone looks so bright and shiny,
it's often hard to tear your eyes away. It's a lit
tle like celebrity gawking, but without the
celebrities. You know, with those long con
templative stares as you think: "I wonder
what it's like being one of them?"
Even at the beginning of the season, when
they were wandering around at lunch with
nametags pinned to lapels and textbooks
clutched in hand, the future CEOs of Ameri
ca still managed to look like they were at a
high-powered conference rather than the
first day of school.
Actually, it wouldn't be quite accurate to
say everyone looks like they belong in the
corporate world. There?s a veneer of studied
plasticity as well,so they instead look like the
movie version of corporate characters.
Now, thanks to the Daily's GSB insider we
know that this is all just an image. Seemingly,
the executives don?t eat kangaroo while end
lessly networking ("Kangaroo meat, open
bars and other GSB myths," Oct. 19). But,
you know, they do make it seem like they
munch on marsupials, which is really all that

matters.
I suppose that with the products,
the ironing and the posing, it would
be all too easy to dismiss the Busi
ness School image as superficial.
That, however, is completely missing
the point. Superficiality is not a bad
thing. The shiny, happy people add
an extra facet to campus life.
Yes, despite the distinct possibili
ty that you?re missing a dimension
or two, Mr. and Ms. Business, we
salute you. It may be a wildly inaccu
rate caricature that we hold dear,
but at least it's something we can
gaze longingly at.

In the B-School? Think you?re more
Abercrombie and Fitch than Macy's?
Or just want to demonstrate that you
have all three dimensions. E-mail

wich at the B-school is very, very good). Nor
is it because of the stirring architecture or
flawless service. No, like so many great
eateries, these two are wonderful places to
see and to be seen.
It's perhaps going a little far to claim
everyone goes with the intention of either
putting themselves on display or of ogling the
rest of the clientele. Nevertheless, there's al
ways something to see.
The spectacle is somewhat less, well, spec
tacular at the Law School. In fact, at first
glance the cafeteria patrons there seem little
different from anywhere else on campus.
Close examination, though, reveals a lit
tle more polish than one might have expect
ed from students — there's hardly a hoodie
in sight and untucked shirts are few and far
between. It's walking into the Arbuckle
Cafe, however, that takes ?polish? to whole
new level.
It's as if you've entered the secret world of
catalogue models. Yes, that?s right, when not
showing off Macy's latest fall line, the per
fectly coiffed set hangs out in the GSB.

Now, make no mistake, this is not simply a
case of better looks at the B-School. No, this
is so much more. To be honest, l?m not even
sure that those soon-to-be Masters of the
Universe are intrinsically prettier than your
typical electrical engineer (remember, I did
say Macy's. not Abercrombie and Fitch).
No, rather than beauty, what marks the
MBA folks out from the crowd is prepara
tion.Their clothes are ironed. Let me say that
again: ironed. Who irons their clothes to go to
school? Personally, when I crawl out of bed in
the morning it's as much as I can manage to
find clothes; ironing is a whole other world.
Furthermore, everyone seems to be well
produced as well. Hair is fixed in place, make
up is artfully applied and faces universally
show the kind of natural, healthy glow that
can only come out of a bottle.
Of course, it's not just the fact that every
one's well turned out that sets up the model

intentionally, but it seems that in whatever di
rection you look you?re met with a tableau
that just screams "buy this shirt."
In fact, everyone looks so bright and shiny,
it's often hard to tear your eyes away. It's a lit

celebrities. You know, with those long con

what it's like being one of them?"
Even at the beginning of the season, when
they were wandering around at lunch with
nametags pinned to lapels and textbooks
clutched in hand, the future CEOs of Ameri

high-powered conference rather than the
first day of school.
Actually, it wouldn't be quite accurate to
say everyone looks like they belong in the
corporate world. There?s a veneer of studied
plasticity as well,so they instead look like the

matters.
I suppose that with the products,
the ironing and the posing, it would
be all too easy to dismiss the Busi
ness School image as superficial.
That, however, is completely missing
the point. Superficiality is not a bad
thing. The shiny, happy people add
an extra facet to campus life.
Yes, despite the distinct possibili
ty that you?re missing a dimension
or two, Mr. and Ms. Business, we
salute you. It may be a wildly inaccu
rate caricature that we hold dear,
but at least it's something we can
gaze longingly at.

In the B-School? Think you?re more
Abercrombie and Fitch than Macy's?
Or just want to demonstrate that you
have all three dimensions. E-mail

Every week I dine at least once in each
of campus's hottest locations: the
Business School and the Law School.
Why are these spots such desirable
lunching venues? Well it's not because of the
food (though the parmesan chicken sand
wich at the B-school is very, very good). Nor
is it because of the stirring architecture or
flawless service. No, like so many great
eateries, these two are wonderful places to
see and to be seen.
