## Commencement storms will pass 
### MIKEY LEE 
"Storms will pass" was one of the
most important pieces of advice 1 re
ceived at Stanford.
When asked what I value most
about my time at the University, my
answer always comes easily: learning
respect and seeking to understand
other people's perspectives. Regard
less of what those perspectives are.
My experiences, like many, were
filled with an eclectic mix of trials
and tribulations and an occasional
serendipitous moment where I felt
like 1 understood a new piece of my
own universe.
And challenges. There were al
ways the big challenges.
The one we currently face: Where
will Commencement be held?
It's nothing new. Last year, it was
the uproar over the new proposal for
undergraduate housing. The year be
fore it was the living wage. The year
before that it was the new alcohol
policy.
And as I look back, it's clear that
these storms passed. We compro
mised. we found solutions, and we all
went back to business.
But the most damaging effects
from these past years are not remem
bered by many. In fact, once solu
tions to the problems were found,
most of us forgot the process by
which we got there. Most of us never
knew — or cared about — the peo
ple who were hurt by the process.
A couple days ago, I woke up to a
barrage of e-mails, phone messages,
yelling, complaints, "how could
you's," and hate mail.
Oh, the hate mail.
I'm constantly blown away 'by
how well-educated, sharp, down-to

earth, forward-thinking, research
oriented, so-called "leaders of the fu
ture" can get so mad.
Especially at the people who
make this University run. The ones
who spend their days and nights
weighing the good options and the
bad. The ones who try so hard to see
the bigger picture before making a
decision.
And we tear into those decisions
with which we don't agree — way
before we even inform ourselves of
the bigger picture.
Before you attack me, too, let me
make it clear: I am not taking a posi
tion on the Commencement issue.
It's clear that the bottom line for the
students is to have an unlimited
number of guests at the big ceremo
ny. That's admirable. The situation,
though, is that there is a one-year re
ality that the University must face.
Unfortunately, the Class of 2006
must bear the burden of not having
Stanford Stadium.
But before you start using words
like "unacceptable," "outrage" or
"demand," take a step back. Look
around before you start to yell, kick,
scream, or hit your inbox's forward
button.
Find out the facts before you
start asking, "What would Harvard
do?" Think twice before you create
a graphic that says, "John Hennessy
does not care about young people."
Ask around before you start
spreading a conspiracy theory about
how the University chose to release
the information after Reunion
Homecoming for money-related
reasons. (For the record. Katie
Miller (Letters, Oct. 25), Harvard
actually does limit their number of
tickets to four per graduate; and

from what I gather. President Hen
nessy actually does care about
young people. He just has to make
decisions).
Most disturbing is the movement
to boycott Senior Gift. In a column
yesterday, David Louk wrote, "It is
well within [the students'] rights to
reconsider donating to the Senior
Gift Campaign." Well within their
rights? Some of us wouldn't be here if
not for the money from Senior Gift.
An attack on Senior Gift — which
is a way for seniors to acknowledge
the scholarships and programming
that have helped them through Stan
ford (and give to the fund that aids
classes below) is ignorant and shows
a large amount of disrespect for
something that has absolutely noth
ing to do with the decision on a Com
mencement site.
Storms will pass. Like all the oth
ers, this one will pass. Things will be
resolved, compromises will be made,
and we'll all go on our merry way
back to our business.
But when it does, don't forget a
lesson: even if you get what you
want, anger and petty attacks cause
harm. They're also unnecessary.
You're graduating. It's a celebration
of your intellect, hard-work and
adulthood. Be positive. Instead of
getting angry, think of a solution.
Then enjoy your senior year. Make it
as memorable as vou can.

Mikey Lee, Class 0f2004, was a senior
class president. He served as the under

ford Alumni Association's Board of
Directors, he is currently an informal
consultant for the A SS U president and
vice-president, and he was once a news
editor for The Daily.
