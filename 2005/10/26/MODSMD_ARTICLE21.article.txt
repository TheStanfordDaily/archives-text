## CLUB SPORTS Ultimate team hopes third time's a charm After agonizing national title game defeats two years in a row, team looks to go one step further 
### TERESA MOLINA 
Frustrating semifinal losses have kept the Stan
ford men's Ultimate team just inches away from na
tional titles in 2004 and 2005.This year, however, the
squad is determined to prevent history from repeat
ing itself and has recently proven itself well
equipped for success.
Flie Ultimate athletes had their hands full this
past weekend in their first preseason tournament at
Chico State, where they captured first place after an
exhausting seven games in two days. While their
early tournament games were easy wins, their semi
final match against Oregon State and their champi
onship match against Las Positas College turned out
to be tough challenges.
"The last two games were really competitive,"
senior captain Jon Levy said. "They definitely could
have gone either way."
There is plenty of time before the start of the
team's major competition, which begins with the
Stanford Invitational in early March. However,
Stanford's recent success at the Chico State tourna
ment is a sure sign of the team's potential to domi
nate regionally as well as nationally.
With a strong core of returnees, this team is one
of the most experienced Stanford has seen in the
past few years. Perhaps more important than expe
rience, however, is what senior captain Josh Wise
man refers to as "the bitter taste of [last year's semi
final] loss." The determination to take this season
one step further than last year's national third place
finish figures to be the driving force behind the
team's increased efforts this year.
The team also contains its share of newcomers,
several of whom joined the returnees at Chico this
weekend for Stanford's first competition.
As of now. the team has yet to separate into an A
team and a B-team — the coaches and captains aim
to finalize a roster by the end of the fall quarter. 1 he
Santa Barbara Invitational in January should give
the separate squads their first opportunity to see
how well they work together while competing
against solid A-teams from other universities.
Graduate student Evan Pearce, a member of
Stanford's national championship ultimate team in
2002, is currently head coach of the squad. Never
theless, he claims that "there is a much larger leader
ship core" on the team that extends far beyond him.
Pearce works closely with last year's head coach
Dan Maidenberg. class of 2005, assistant coaches
Nick Handler and James Herbert, as well as captains
Levy, Wiseman and senior Jack Kuecker.
"I listen to everyone's opinion and try to come to
a consensus," Pearce said. "Ultimately. I make the
final decisions, but it's a joint effort."
Much of the decision-making has recently fo
cused on plans for the team's practice schedule,
which consists largely of scrimmaging and skill de
velopment. A trip to Roble Field on a Iliesday or
Friday afternoon would eliminate any skeptic's
doubts about the intensity of an Ultimate practice:
players are often sighted in the midst of tough phys
ical conditioning and demanding drills.
Team members, especially those on the A-team,
are also expected to devote time outside of practice
to maintaining top physical form. Any Ultimate
player would attest to the great physical demands of
the sport, especially because the team's typical
weekend tournament schedule involves three to
four games a day — something even the fittest ath
letes find exhausting.
ITiis system requires a great deal of discipline —
a factor that could make or break this team. Wise
man believes that high levels of individual motiva-
tion and commitment to personal
workouts are what could be the key
to the national title this year.
Like Wiseman, Pearce also hopes
to boost the level of team discipline,
not necessarily in terms of increased
practice time, but with greater focus
on making sure players are ready to
go at practice and take the workouts
seriously.
While national level competition
is still months away, Stanford's Ulti
mate team has reason to believe that
this year will bring an end to the re
peated string of semifinal defeats
that have hindered them for the past
two years. Led by dedicated coaches
and committed captains, this squad
plans to put up a fight before allow
ing anything to interfere with its
pursuit of a national championship.
