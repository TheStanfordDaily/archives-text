## Cardinal forced to play 36 holes on opening day of tournament, unable to recover from rocky start 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With inclement weather, top
ranked teams and its own inconsisten
cy to battle, the Stanford men's golf
team was unable to overcome a poor
third round at the Isleworth Collegiate
Invitational, finishing 17th out of 18
teams.
On Sunday, the Cardinal started on
an accelerated schedule. With Hurri

cane Wilma passing through nearby
Windermere, Fla., Monday's play was
canceled and two rounds were played
on Sunday at the Isleworth Country
Club instead. The Cardinal struggled
and shot a disappointing 14 over par
(302) first round. And although the
team improved to shoot a nine over par
(297) in the second round, it was far
from the solid beginning the squad is
used to having.
"I think we got off to a little bit of a

slow start playing 36 holes," coach
Conrad Ray said. "And then [Tuesday]
the playing conditions were very diffi
cult. Things were tough â€” there was
just a lot out there that could give you
trouble."
The weather, as anticipated, proved
to he a formidable challenge. With a
cold front coming in, the golfers faced
60-degree temperatures and 20-25
mile-per-hour winds yesterday.
"Collectively, as a team, we just did
n't hit the ball like we can," Ray said.
"When it's windy or you're on a difficult
course, all your errors are magnified. So

jophomore Rob Giube led the Cardinal at the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational, shooting a 1 Oover-par 226 to finish 33rd.
that was really the difference."
Sophomore Rob Grube was one
member of the Cardinal squad
plagued by inconsistency. Despite
being the leading scorer for the team
and placing in the top 10 in his three
tournaments this season, Grube
struggled. An even-par 72 in the first
round gave way to a two over par sec
ond round and an eight over par third
round that left him tied for 33rd.
"Anytime you play poorly, you
feel disappointed," Grube said. 'But
you have to look at it and figure out
why you didn't play well, put [it] be
hind you, take the reasons why you
didn't play well and work on them
the next day and the next week and
the next year."
Over the past couple weeks, the
team has been working to remedy an
overall tendency to shoot poor third
rounds. Unfortunately, though, the
trend continued yesterday.
Like Grube, juniors Zack Miller

and Matt Savage as well as seniors
Scott Mac Donald and Kyle Gentry
all needed two to 12 strokes more in
the third round than in the second.
With a collective 38 over par last
round, the team dropped from 14th
after two rounds to 17th at the finish.
Earlier this season, Grube cited a
lack of confidence as a source of the
squad's drop in performance. But he
viewed this week's third round dif
ferently.
"1 think the confidence was actu
ally there, but the other teams just
outplayed us in all the rounds," he
said. "That was a little bit of a wake
up call for us."
The field was strong at the invita
tional, with 13 of the top 20 teams in
the country competing. Top-ranked
Georgia won with an authoritative
eight over par( 872), followed by No.
3 Oklahoma State (879) and No. 2
Georgia Tech (894).
"ITie teams that were up in the
lead most likely struck the ball really
well and got the most out of their
games," Ray said. "We failed to do
that this week."
The Cardinal likely won't face
such elite competition again until the

NCAA Championships in the
spring, but the squad now has an
early sign of what needs to be done
in order to succeed down the stretch.
"I think the realization we've had
as a team is that we need to be con
sistent," Grube said. "Everyone
needs to pull together and figure out
how we can shave about two strokes
off each score for us to compete and
try to win the NCAAs."
For now, though, the squad is
more focused on turning around its
current trend of inconsistency after
recent disappointing showings.
"There are no excuses," Ray said.
"1 think that we just need to play bet
ter. We're underachieving right now,
so we'll just try to figure out how to
approach next week and have a great
game plan and just keep working
hard. And we'll see what happens."
After regrouping and analyzing
this week's mistakes, the team moves
on to the Cordevalle Classic, hosted
by No. 5 rival UCLA in San Martin,
Calif, next week. It is an opportunity
the Cardinal eagerly await in their
hopes for success.
"That's the great thing about golf:
There's always next week," Rav said.
