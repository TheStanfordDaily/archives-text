# When 45 points and a win aren't enough...
## 
### 
As I hiked to Stanford Stadium at top
speed this past Saturday, trying to catch
as much of the Stanford-Arizona State
football game as possible, I whizzed by the first
gate to park my bike. The KZSU broadcast
blared outside, announcing a solid first-down run
by Jason Evans.
Due to prior commitments, I had gotten back
to my far-from-everywhere-particularly-the-sta
dium FroSoCo dorm room at a little past 3:30
p.m. Checking the score online, 1 was surprised
(albeit pleasantly) to see Stanford's 31-7 halftime
advantage and was excited to see that our recent
ly-improved quarterback TYent Edwards was
having a magnificent 247-yard, three-touch
down, no-interception Matt Leinart-esque game
— all in the first half.
Wasn't this Arizona State team supposed to
be led by a powerful offense featuring Pac-10
passing yards and touchdown leader quarterback
Sam Keller? Weren't we supposed to be "im
proved, but ultimately unable to keep up," as pre
dicted by Foxsports.com experts? Well, needless
to say, I was thrilled with the progress of the game
and wanted to get down to the site of the action
as soon as I could.
When I finally finished the piece of work 1
needed to submit before leaving, I checked the
score one last time and saw that we had scored
yet another touchdown — this one on a one-yard
run by fullback Nick Frank. 38-7, baby! I was so
excited I whipped out my phone with the inten
tion of calling everyone on my contact list. But
the prospect of passing multiple intersections at
nearly full speed on my bike on my way across
campus made me refrain. For just a moment, I
valued my life over school pride — motivated
solely by the desire to witness the first blowout
(on our side of the ball, anyway) during my two
years at Stanford.
When I finally arrived at the stadium, we had
scored once more. The game was still in the mid
dle of the third quarter, we were now up 45-7 and
were fashioning one of our best offensive per
formances in years. Sure, the similarly-matched
individual stats didn't quite equate to the un
equal score, but the points are what matter, right?
Here are when things turned a little sour,
though. When I got past the gates and hastened
up the steps to finally see the green of the field,
the first thing I saw was ASU redshirt freshman
quarterback Rudy Carpenter tossing a nice spiral
to sophomore wide receiver/tailback Rudy
Burgess for an 18-yard score. I quickly resigned
myself to the fact that we were playing one of the
top offenses in the Pacific-1() Conference. And,
after all, we were still leading by 31 points in the
second half. Nothing to worry about.
After the score, 1 found my seat and was treat
ed to few nice Edwards-Bradford hookups but
no series bringing the Cardinal anywhere close to
scoring range. On the other side of the ball, ASU
was taking care of business, passing the ball for
first downs seemingly at will, doing the hut-hut
hike, drop back, pass to the side, first down, run
out of bounds routine time and time again —
