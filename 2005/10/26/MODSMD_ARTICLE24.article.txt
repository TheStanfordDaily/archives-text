## Cardinal star aces the competition at tourney Senior KC Corkery makes good on his tournament top-seed ranking, caps effort with straight-sets victory in title match 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Six straight-set victories; five days of tennis; one
singles berth to the National Indoor Champi
onships. Senior KC Corkery made almost every
thing seem too easy as he cruised to a 6-4,6-4 vic
tory yesterday in the finals of the ITA Region
Eight Tournament. As the tournament's top seed,
the senior defeated Washington's Alex Slovic in
the finals of the tournament.
While most of his teammates got a win or two
under their belts at the tournament, hosted by
Santa Clara University, it was Corkery who went
all the way and captured the title for the North
west region. In the 2(M)4 Regionals. the All-Amer
ican's run for the title was stopped in the quarter
finals by California's Lennart Maack. This year,
however, the Manhattan Beach native handily de
feated M;iack 7-5, 6-4 in the quarterfinals to ad
vance to Monday morning's semifinal.
In Monday morning's match, Corkery faced
Cal Poly s John Nguyen, a junior who was named
to the All Big West's first team last year. Nguyen's
long three-setter from the previous day against

Cal'sTyler Browne appeared to have taken its toll,
as Corkery defeated Nguyen 6-4,6-2.
In the other half of the draw, junior James Pade
had won a three-setter against Daniel Sebescen,
another player from Cal, to enter the semifinals.
"James is really maturing as a player," head
coach John Whitlinger said. "He's handling him
self very well on the court and doing the right
things. He's got a big serve, a big forehand, huge
weapons and he's going to have a great year."
In the semifinals. Pade met up with Washing
ton's Alex Slovic. After three close sets, the Husky
prevailed. 6-3,3-6,6-3, dashing the Cardinal hopes
for an all-Stanford showdown in the finals. Al
though Pade did not qualify for the Indoors in sin
gles, he and Corkery plan to team up to enter the
doubles draw.
"A couple of points here and there and that
could have been [Pade's] match." Whitlinger said.
"[Slovic] is a very good player, and he took advan
tage of a couple situations. I was hoping we'd have
a Stanford final, but it didn't quite work out that
way."
Checking in at No. 9 in the preseason rankings,
Corkery prepared to take on No. 23 Slovic. De

spite having his serve broken several times
throughout the match, Corkery was still able to
clinch the title and ensure his spot in the singles
draw of next week's Indoors, to be hosted by Ohio
State University.
Corkery and Slovic exchanged breaks early in
the first set; however, later in the set, the Cardinal
fought to snag another break and, this time, held
on to close out the first set, 6-4.
With the momentum in Stanford's favor, Cork
ery broke Slovic in the first game of the second set
to take a 1-0 lead. However, the Husky responded
with a break of his own to even the score. Corkery
later broke to earn a 3-2 lead and held serve to
make the score 4-2. Following his hold, Corkery
yet again missed chances to break and could not
stretch his lead to 5-2. However, the senior held on
and closed out the second set with a score identi
cal to that of the first, and Corkery claimed the vic
tory over the tournament's second seed.
"[Slovic] is ranked 23rd and is definitely capa
ble of beating anybody at any time," Whitlinger
said. "KC was very solid [on Monday] off the
ground and served pretty well. I'm not going to say
it was a routine match, but it was a very solid per
formance by KC."


PETER KRUTZIK/The Stanford Daily
Senior KC Corkery closed out an impressive effort at the ITA Region Eight Tour
nament by winning the title match yesterday over Washington's Alex Sto vie.
Corkery played only six sets — the minimum number possible — in his final
three matches of the tournament. He would have faced teammate James Pade
in the final had it not been for Pade's hard fought thteeset loss in the semifinals.
