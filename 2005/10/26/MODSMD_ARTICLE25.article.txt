# Astros successful despite dire lack of ethnic diversity
## Houston first team in over 50 years to reach World Series without one black team member

HOUSTON (AP) —Joe Morgan
worries about the face of baseball.
Watching the World Series, the Hall
of Famer is troubled by what he sees.
His old team, the Houston As
tros, is down 3-0 to the Chicago
White Sox, but it's not their lineup
that concerns Morgan. It's their
makeup.
The Astros are the first World Se
ries team in more than a half-centu
ry with a roster that doesn't include
a single black player.
"Of course I noticed it. How could
you not?" Morgan said while the As
tros took batting practice before the
opener in Chicago. "But they're not
the only ones. There are two or three
teams that didn't have any African-
American players this year."
Morgan said it's a predicament
and a challenge for Major League
Baseball. While more players from
around the world are making it to the
majors — Japan, Korea, for example
— the number of blacks is declining.
"It's a daunting task to get
African-American kids into base
ball, and I don't see the trend chang
ing," he said.
The last World Series team with
out a black player was the 1953 New
York Yankees. It wasn't until 1955
— eight years after Jackie Robinson

broke the color barrier in 1947 —
that Elston Howard became the first
black in Yankee pinstripes.
Black players accounted for just
about nine percent of big league ros
ters this season.
"We know that we have to work
to do," Commissioner Bud Selig said
lUesday. "We'll continue to intensify
our efforts. I'm very aware, I'm ex
tremely sensitive about it, and I feel
badly about it. But we need to get to
work to change things."
Astros general manager Tim Pur
pura agrees.
"I think it's a huge,huge problem
for baseball," he said. "The pool of
African-American players just isn't
there. And as baseball becomes
more college-oriented in its draft,
there aren't a lot of players to pick.
"The African-American athletes
are going into other sports," he
added.
The most recent survey by the
NCAA, taken during the 2(X)3-04
season, showed that only six percent
of Division I baseball players were
black. Half of the men's basketball
players were black, as were 44 per
cent of football players.
Houston has a half-dozen His
panic players — it was the first team
to open a baseball academy in
Venezuela, about a dozen years ago.
Bench coach Cecil Cooper is black.
Outfielders Charles Gipson and

Charlton Jimerson, both black,
played for the Astros during the reg
ular season.
The White Sox have three black
players on their Series roster: Jer
maine Dye, Carl Everett and Willie
Harris, along with coaches Tim
Raines and 1 farold Baines. Iliey also
have eight Hispanic players and

Japanese second baseman Tadahito
Iguchi.
"We're diverse because we're
looking for the best in talent and
character." general manager Ken
Williams said before the Series start
ed."lt just happened that way. 1 could
care less what the makeup of the club
is as long as it works as a whole."
