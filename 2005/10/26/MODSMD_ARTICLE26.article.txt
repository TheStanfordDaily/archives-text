# Despite their undefeated record, Trojans drop to second in BCS rankings
## 
### JOHN NADEL AP SPORTS WRITER 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Pete Car
roll's observation came with a
chuckle and seemed simple enough.
Perhaps it was more revealing than
even he realized.
"I guess it has something to do
with who you're playing, but not
where you're playing," the Southern
California coach said TUesday about
the latest Bowl Championship Se
ries standings.
USC (7-0,4-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) is ranked No. 1 in all three
human polls, but Texas is No. 1 in five
of the six computers involved in the
BCS standings, putting the Long
horns on top of the Trojans by .0007.
Virginia Tech is third, another 5.92
points back.
Jerry Palm, an expert on the BCS,
told The Associated Press that only
two of the six computers factor in
game location.
The Trojans have played five of
their seven games on the road —
against No. 9 Notre Dame, No. 14
Oregon, and then-No. 14 Arizona
State, along with Hawaii and
Washington. Their home games
were against Arkansas and Ari
zona.
Texas (7-0) has played Louisiana-
Lafayette, Rice, Oklahoma, then-No.
24 Colorado and No. 17TexasTech at
home and No. 12 Ohio State and Mis
souri on the road.
"Texas is playing really good
football," Carroll said.
When the BCS standings were
released Monday, Carroll said he
wouldn't care about them until the
end of the regular season.
"For the most part, they're not

significant until you finish," he said
lUesday. "I really don't understand
how it works."
Shortly thereafter, he made his
remark concerning game location.
"I think that's the only realistic
way of looking at it. is where you're
playing," he said when asked to elab
orate. "I'm not saying that because
we've played on the road. It just
makes sense."
Palm has his own set of rankings,
and he factors in both game location
and margin of victory. Texas is No. 1
in his poll, followed by Virginia Tech
and USC.
USC linebacker Collin Ashton
said he didn't care about the cur
rent BCS standings because
they're not final.
"When you think about it, it's six
computers telling us we're second,"
he said.
Regarding the fact that four of
the six don't factor in game location,
Ashton said: "That's why the people
polls are always the best."
Having played so much on the
road, the IVojans can put their suit
cases away fora while. They finish
the regular season with four of their
last five games at home.
USC has a conference-record 29-
game overall winning streak and
school-record streaks of 23 at home
and 14 on the road.
"1 think it's a tremendous ac
complishment. I made it clear to the
guys after the fact," Carroll said of
his team's ability to get through the
difficult part of the schedule with
out losing. "It does feel differently,
that we get to play at home."
"As we have said repeatedly, it's
great to come back and play at the
Coliseum,' he added.
