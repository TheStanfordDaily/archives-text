# CAMPUS LIFE
## Another 200 students to go abroad in spring 
### DENISE SOHN 
For most members of the Stanford community, any mention of the
Stanford campus conjures familiar memories of iush palms, gleaming
red roofs and beautiful sandstone architecture. Indeed, with the spec
tacle of the Oval in the mind's eye, it is easy to overlook the Univer
sity's other campuses abroad, where a student on a casual walk to his
or her daily 10 a.m. class might see the world's most famous sights â€”
the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Ponte Vecchio in Florence or the
Eiffel Tower in Paris.
This is one reason why the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP) has consistently drawn applicants over the past several
years.
The BOSP spring quarter application window closed last Sunday,
Oct. 16. and approximately 200 students will soon receive acceptance
notices and start packing for Beijing. Berlin, Florence, Kyoto, Ox
ford, Paris or Santiago to continue their undergraduate educations.
These students, following in the footsteps of the several thousand
Stanford students who have gone abroad since the 19605, will remain
enrolled at Stanford and receive credit toward graduating.
"We noticed pretty steady numbers in the applicants." said Erinn
Evans, orientation coordinator for the program. Although numbers
of applicants within each program had slight increases or decreases,
overall, the popularity of the program remained constant, she said.
The program will continue to accept late applications, although
on-time applicants will receive priority.
While every one of the programs appeals to applicants, the most
popular program seemed to be Stanford in Oxford.
"Oxford is always popular," said BOSP Director Norman
Naimark.
Students are often attracted by the lack of a language require
ment as well as the chance to study at one of the world's oldest uni
versities.
"I don't speak any other languages and I really wanted to go
abroad," said sophomore Karina Liu, who will travel to Oxford in the
winter. Liu. a potential English major, was also attracted to the op
portunity to study British literature at St. Catherine's College in Ox
ford.
"I'm also really looking forward to the general atmosphere," Liu
added. She grew up in New York City, and she explained that she
missed the atmosphere of city life at Stanford. Studying abroad is an
excellent opportunity for students to break away from the "Stanford
Bubble" and experience different settings, she said.
In addition to the program in Oxford. Stanford in Paris is also one

of the most popular locations.
"We have waitlists for both Oxford and Paris," Evans explained.
While no special programs are being offered in the spring, the cur
rent ones have attracted enough students. In addition,some students
will participate in the Kyoto-Stanford Center Technology and Inno
vation program, which requires applications to be submitted one
year in advance.
The old phrase "the sun never sets on Stanford" certainly seems
to hold true for this spring. All over the world. Stanford students are
learning about new ideas and experiencing new cultures. Whether in
home-stays or in more traditional dormitory-style living arrange
ments, students are thrown into foreign communities and new envi
ronments for 10 weeks at a time.
