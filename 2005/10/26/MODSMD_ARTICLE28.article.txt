Stanford's new Ultrafast Science Center aims to unite
research scientists in the emerging field of studying tiny,
fast-moving objects with unmatched tools and facilities.
On Oct. 17. Phil Bucksbaumwas appointed director of
the Center, a $400 million project funded by the U.S. De
partment of Energy's Office of Science.
Bucksbaum is an atomic physicist and former director
of the National Science Foundation's Center for the Ad
vancement of Frontiers in Optical Coherent Ultrafast
Science (FOCUS) at the University of Michigan.
He said that it would be difficult to leave the Univer
sity of Michigan, "but the Ultrafast Center looked like a
fabulous, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
Bucksbaum will also serve as a professor at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center

(SLAC) and in Stanford's Applied Physics Department,
in addition to his role as director of the Ultrafast Science
Center.
"The Ultrafast Center is linked to a completely revo
lutionary and amazing new machine," said Neil Calder,
director of communications at SLAC, referring to the
Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), which is scheduled
to begin operation at SLAC in 2009.
"SLAC is exactly the place to be building this machine
because they have the expertise and infrastructure neces
sary," Bucksbaum said.
The LCLS sets itself apart from any other X-ray
source in that the lasers it produces have the shortest
wavelengths built so far and last below a trillionth of a
second, allowing scientists to capture and see things on
