# Facility will open up new frontiers in particle science
## Director chosen for new Center 
### KELLEY FONG 
Stanford's new Ultrafast Science Center aims to unite
research scientists in the emerging field of studying tiny,
fast-moving objects with unmatched tools and facilities.
On Oct. 17. Phil Bucksbaumwas appointed director of
the Center, a $400 million project funded by the U.S. De
partment of Energy's Office of Science.
Bucksbaum is an atomic physicist and former director
of the National Science Foundation's Center for the Ad
vancement of Frontiers in Optical Coherent Ultrafast
Science (FOCUS) at the University of Michigan.
He said that it would be difficult to leave the Univer
sity of Michigan, "but the Ultrafast Center looked like a
fabulous, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
Bucksbaum will also serve as a professor at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center

(SLAC) and in Stanford's Applied Physics Department,
in addition to his role as director of the Ultrafast Science
Center.
"The Ultrafast Center is linked to a completely revo
lutionary and amazing new machine," said Neil Calder,
director of communications at SLAC, referring to the
Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), which is scheduled
to begin operation at SLAC in 2009.
"SLAC is exactly the place to be building this machine
because they have the expertise and infrastructure neces
sary," Bucksbaum said.
The LCLS sets itself apart from any other X-ray
source in that the lasers it produces have the shortest
wavelengths built so far and last below a trillionth of a
second, allowing scientists to capture and see things on
the atomic scale, according to Bucks
baum. In addition, the laser has an
exceptionally high intensity with a
field-strength comparable to that
which binds electrons to atoms.
Because the LCLS will produce
X-ray pulses of the right wavelength
and time duration, scientists will be
able to take freeze-frame snapshots
— essentially. X-ray motion pictures
— to observe phenomena no other
instrument can see.
Rather than merely taking still
photos of atomic processes, "we will
be able to see chemistry and biology
happen in real time, a major step for
ward," Calder said. "1 am sure we
will find things about biology and
chemistry that we never expected."
Hie LCLS — the world's first
hard X-ray free electron laser — will
investigate chemical dynamics, pro
tein structures, nanotechnology de
vices and atomic and plasma physics,
among other things.
Keith Hodgson, deputy director
of SLAC, emphasizes the interdisci
plinary overlap that the Ultrafast
Center will have.
"People who know about chem
istry, atomic physics, accelerator

physics, etc., will come together in an
intellectual center to solve different
problems, and the catalyst will be
this new machine," he said.
In bringing together experts from
different fields, Hodgson noted that
the
Ultrafast Center embodies the "way
that Stanford has begun to approach
these different opportunities."
Hodgson said he envisions a
"very strong bridge between SLAC
and activities on campus," and
Bucksbaum remarked that the new
Ultrafast Center will provide an av
enue for research unparalleled else
where for Stanford faculty and stu
dents.
"I think it's pretty robust," said
freshman and prospective physics
major
Douglas Stanford. "The frontiers of
research are being brought right
next door."
According to Calder, the Ultra
fast Center is an important step for
Stanford University as well as the
world.
"This is a very exciting time for
us," Calder said. "With the Synchro
tron Radiation Laboratory and
LCLS, we will have a toolkit to ex
amine the ultra-small and ultra-fast
that exists nowhere else in the
world."

"very strong bridge between SLAC
and activities on campus," and
Bucksbaum remarked that the new
Ultrafast Center will provide an av
enue for research unparalleled else
where for Stanford faculty and stu
dents.
"I think it's pretty robust," said
freshman and prospective physics
major
Douglas Stanford. "The frontiers of
research are being brought right
next door."
According to Calder, the Ultra
fast Center is an important step for
Stanford University as well as the
world.
"This is a very exciting time for
us," Calder said. "With the Synchro
tron Radiation Laboratory and
LCLS, we will have a toolkit to ex
amine the ultra-small and ultra-fast
that exists nowhere else in the
world."
