## EU rules feta cheese a traditional Greek good 
### RAF CASERT ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — The
European Union's highest court finally
settled the fate of feta cheese on Tliesday,
decreeing it a traditional Greek product
deserving protection throughout the 25-
nation bloc in a ruling that went against
other European producers.
Germany and Denmark, backed by
France and Britain, had challenged the
designation of origin for the salty, crumbly
cheese and turned it into a gastronomic
fight lasting almost two decades and in
volving lobbyists, the European Commis
sion and, finally, the European Court of
Justice.
"The court upholds the name 'feta' as a
protected designation of origin for
Greece,"the Luxembourg-based court
said in its ruling.
Danish and German producers had
hoped to be able to continue producing
such cheese and call it feta to maintain the
product's marketability. They argued that
what made feta specific was the technique
of making it, not the geographical origin.
"Our efforts have been crowned by
success. The European Court issued a his
toric decision, declaring finally and irrev
ocably that the feta is not for common
usage and is exclusively Greek," a jubilant
Greek Agriculture Minister Evangelos
Basiakos said.
Danish producers were outraged.
"The ruling is grotesque and political,"
said Hans Bender of the Danish Dairy
Board. "What will be next? Will the Ital
ians demand that pizza become a protect
ed product that no one can make?"
Name changes, though, will be inevitable.
"Our feta production will continue.

However, we will sell under other names,"
said Astrid Gade Nielsen, spokeswoman
for Aria Foods, a Danish company that
produces 25,000 tons of the cheese a year.
EU Farm Commissioner Mariann Fis
cher Boel said the ruling set an example
for global trade talks where denomina
tions of origin, including those of wines,
are often a point of discussion.
"The ruling sets an important prece
dent" for defining so-called geographic in
dicators — a trademark protection issue
affecting a host of European foodstuffs in
global trade talks.
"This is important for the future for in
ternational negotiations. This ruling
shows that our system works," Boel said.
When the European Commission gave
feta its protected designation of origin in
2002, it argued that natural, geographic
and human factors had combined to give
the cheese its specific Greek character. It
said the extensive grazing of special ewes
and goats on Greek terrain gave the
cheese its specific aroma and flavor.
"The interplay between the natural
factors and the specific human factors, in
particular the traditional production
method, which requires straining without
pressure, has thus given feta cheese its re
markable international reputation," the
court said.
German and Danish producers also
have taken the lead in campaigns to have
feta declared a generic product in recogni
tion of the fact that production has spread
well beyond the cheese's origin, and took
the case to the EU's highest court.
The court ruled that was not enough to
claim the name, arguing several Balkan
countries produced such a briny cheese
fora long time, but all called it something
different.
