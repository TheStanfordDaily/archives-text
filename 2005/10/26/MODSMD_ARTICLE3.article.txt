## Scientists boycott Dalai Lama Neurologists urge Society to cancel lecture 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
"Om mani padme hum. Om mani
padme hum," this, chanted over and
over by Buddhist monks, may not be the
average person's upper. However, en
robed monks and lab coat-clad scientists
alike are taking interest in the effect of
meditation on individual happiness.
Advancements in brain imaging in
the last decade have shown that connec
tions among brain nerve cells can
change throughout life. A 2003 study,
led by Richard Davidson of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison, suggested
that meditation — akin to sending your
brain to the gym — can change the way
the brain functions.
As an enthusiastic collaborator in re
search on whether the practice of medi
tation can train the brain to generate
compassion and positive thoughts while
pushing out what he calls "destructive
emotions," the Dalai Lama is at the cen
ter of a debate that is anything but Zen.
The Society for Neuroscience, invit
ed the exiled leader of Tibet and
revered spiritual teacher to speak at
their annual conference, scheduled for
next month in Washington, D.C. How
ever, the prospect of a monk lecturing
to an audience of premier neuroscien
tists has upset a group of brain re
searchers to the extent that they plan to
boycott the event.
Nearly 550 scientists to date have
signed a petition urging the society to
cancel the lecture, according to a report
in The New York Times. The Dalai
Lama's talk will "highlight a subject
with largely unsubstantiated claims and
compromised scientific rigor and objec
tivity," the petition contended.
While critics say that a religious
leader has no place at a scientific con
ference, society officials answered that
the Dalai Lama, who once said he
would be an engineer were he not a
monk, was invited because of growing
interest in the neuroscience of medita
tion and has carried on a dialogue with
neuroscientists for 15 years.
"It has been agreed that the talk will
not be about religion or politics," said
Carol Barnes, society president and
professor of psychology and neurology
at the University of Arizona.
However, some feel that regardless
of the topic of the Dalai Lama speech, a
religious leader's presence at the con
ference will send a message on which
the scientific community does not wish

have their name.
"The Dalai Lama is a big propo
nent of science, but he tries to bring
religion and God into science just the
same," said junior Jacob Lemieux.
"For example, he believes that muta
tions are non-random and the work
of God, which is theoretically anti
thetical to modern evolutionary the
ory. It's like his own strange version
of intelligent design."
Hundreds of neuroscientists na
tionwide echo Lemieux's apprehen
sions.
"This merger of serious neuro
science with a particular religion is a
practical joke because the very
recognition of the Dalai Lama relies
on the belief in reincarnation," said
Yi Rao, a neurology professor at
Northwestern University and
drafter of the petition. "That means
that the mind and the body have to
be separate for the mind to pass from
one generation to another."
One thing that is certain is that
the Dalai Lama will not lack an audi
ence; neuroscientists worldwide
have been intensely debating the

event, which will proceed as
planned.
This is a debate that will soon
make its way to Stanford. The Dalai
Lama is scheduled to visit Stanford
Nov. 4-5, with the intent of creating a
dialogue with a group of distin
guished scientists from Stanford and
other major universities. The Stan
ford School of Medicine is co-spon
soring the event, along with the Of
fice for Religious Life, the Aurora
Forum and the Stanford Center for
Buddhist Studies.
"We will seek to identify common
ground between Tibetan Buddhism
and neuroscience, disciplines that
use very different methods to under
stand how the mind works and how
to treat its disorders," said Dr. Philip
Pizzo, dean of Stanford's School of
Medicine. "The Buddhists — with
their 2,500-year-old tradition of in
trospective inquiry into the nature of
the mind — are thought to have
much to offer to neuroscience. The
goal for the conference is to estab
lish a rich dialogue focused on prob
lems that all of us experience."

their annual conference, scheduled for
next month in Washington, D.C. How
ever, the prospect of a monk lecturing
to an audience of premier neuroscien
tists has upset a group of brain re
searchers to the extent that they plan to
boycott the event.
Nearly 550 scientists to date have
signed a petition urging the society to
cancel the lecture, according to a report
in The New York Times. The Dalai
Lama's talk will "highlight a subject
with largely unsubstantiated claims and
compromised scientific rigor and objec
tivity," the petition contended.
While critics say that a religious
leader has no place at a scientific con
ference, society officials answered that
the Dalai Lama, who once said he
would be an engineer were he not a
monk, was invited because of growing
interest in the neuroscience of medita
tion and has carried on a dialogue with
neuroscientists for 15 years.
"It has been agreed that the talk will
not be about religion or politics," said
Carol Barnes, society president and
professor of psychology and neurology
at the University of Arizona.
However, some feel that regardless
of the topic of the Dalai Lama speech, a
religious leader's presence at the con
ference will send a message on which
the scientific community does not wish

have their name.
"The Dalai Lama is a big propo
nent of science, but he tries to bring
religion and God into science just the
same," said junior Jacob Lemieux.
"For example, he believes that muta
tions are non-random and the work
of God, which is theoretically anti
thetical to modern evolutionary the
ory. It's like his own strange version
of intelligent design."
Hundreds of neuroscientists na
tionwide echo Lemieux's apprehen
sions.
"This merger of serious neuro
science with a particular religion is a
practical joke because the very
recognition of the Dalai Lama relies
on the belief in reincarnation," said
Yi Rao, a neurology professor at
Northwestern University and
drafter of the petition. "That means
that the mind and the body have to
be separate for the mind to pass from
one generation to another."
One thing that is certain is that
the Dalai Lama will not lack an audi
ence; neuroscientists worldwide
have been intensely debating the

event, which will proceed as
planned.
This is a debate that will soon
make its way to Stanford. The Dalai
Lama is scheduled to visit Stanford
Nov. 4-5, with the intent of creating a
dialogue with a group of distin
guished scientists from Stanford and
other major universities. The Stan
ford School of Medicine is co-spon
soring the event, along with the Of
fice for Religious Life, the Aurora
Forum and the Stanford Center for
Buddhist Studies.
"We will seek to identify common
ground between Tibetan Buddhism
and neuroscience, disciplines that
use very different methods to under
stand how the mind works and how
to treat its disorders," said Dr. Philip
Pizzo, dean of Stanford's School of
Medicine. "The Buddhists — with
their 2,500-year-old tradition of in
trospective inquiry into the nature of
the mind — are thought to have
much to offer to neuroscience. The
goal for the conference is to estab
lish a rich dialogue focused on prob
lems that all of us experience."

"Om mani padme hum. Om mani
padme hum," this, chanted over and
over by Buddhist monks, may not be the
average person's upper. However, en
robed monks and lab coat-clad scientists
alike are taking interest in the effect of
meditation on individual happiness.
Advancements in brain imaging in
the last decade have shown that connec
tions among brain nerve cells can
change throughout life. A 2003 study,
led by Richard Davidson of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison, suggested
that meditation — akin to sending your
brain to the gym — can change the way
the brain functions.
As an enthusiastic collaborator in re
search on whether the practice of medi
tation can train the brain to generate
compassion and positive thoughts while
pushing out what he calls "destructive
emotions," the Dalai Lama is at the cen
ter of a debate that is anything but Zen.
The Society for Neuroscience, invit
ed the exiled leader of Tibet and
revered spiritual teacher to speak at
their annual conference, scheduled for
next month in Washington, D.C. How
