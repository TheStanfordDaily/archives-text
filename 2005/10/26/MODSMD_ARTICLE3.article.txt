## Scientists boycott Dalai Lama Neurologists urge Society to cancel lecture 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
"Om mani padme hum. Om mani
padme hum," this, chanted over and
over by Buddhist monks, may not be the
average person's upper. However, en
robed monks and lab coat-clad scientists
alike are taking interest in the effect of
meditation on individual happiness.
Advancements in brain imaging in
the last decade have shown that connec
tions among brain nerve cells can
change throughout life. A 2003 study,
led by Richard Davidson of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison, suggested
that meditation — akin to sending your
brain to the gym — can change the way
the brain functions.
As an enthusiastic collaborator in re
search on whether the practice of medi
tation can train the brain to generate
compassion and positive thoughts while
pushing out what he calls "destructive
emotions," the Dalai Lama is at the cen
ter of a debate that is anything but Zen.
The Society for Neuroscience, invit
ed the exiled leader of Tibet and
revered spiritual teacher to speak at
their annual conference, scheduled for
next month in Washington, D.C. How
ever, the prospect of a monk lecturing
to an audience of premier neuroscien
tists has upset a group of brain re
searchers to the extent that they plan to
boycott the event.
Nearly 550 scientists to date have
signed a petition urging the society to
cancel the lecture, according to a report
in The New York Times. The Dalai
Lama's talk will "highlight a subject
with largely unsubstantiated claims and
compromised scientific rigor and objec
tivity," the petition contended.
While critics say that a religious
leader has no place at a scientific con
ference, society officials answered that
the Dalai Lama, who once said he
would be an engineer were he not a
monk, was invited because of growing
interest in the neuroscience of medita
tion and has carried on a dialogue with
neuroscientists for 15 years.
"It has been agreed that the talk will
not be about religion or politics," said
Carol Barnes, society president and
professor of psychology and neurology
at the University of Arizona.
However, some feel that regardless
of the topic of the Dalai Lama speech, a
religious leader's presence at the con
ference will send a message on which
the scientific community does not wish
