## Crews restore power after Hurricane Wilma strikes 
### ALLEN BREED ASSOCIATED PRESS 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.
(AP) — Repair crews across Florida
struggled TUesday to restore electrici
ty to up to 6 million people, reopen the
regions airports and replace countless
windows blown out of downtown
high-rises during Hurricane Wilma's
ruinous dash across the state.
Officials said it could take weeks
for Florida's most heavily populated
region — the Miami, Fort Laud
erdale and West Palm Beach area —
to return to normal.
Water and gas became precious
commodities, and people waited for
hours for free water, ice and food.
Lines stretched for blocks at the few
gas stations with the electricity need
ed to pump fuel, and arguments broke
out when motorists tried to cut in line.
But barely 24 hours after the Cat
egory 3 storm struck, there were
signs of recovery.
"We have power! We have

power!" several residents of Miami
Lakes chanted as they ran out their
back doors when the lights came on.
The quantity of debris was daunt
ing: Pieces of roofs, trees, signs,
awnings, fences, billboards and pool
screens were scattered across several
counties. Damage estimates ranged
up to $10 billion.
"Tomorrow's going to be better
than today," Gov. Jeb Bush said.
Some of the worst damage was in
downtown Fort Lauderdale, where
Wilma was the strongest hurricane to
strike since 1950. Winds of more than
MX) mph blew out windows in high
rises, many built before Florida en-

acted tougher construction codes fol
lowing Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
The school district's 14-story
headquarters — known as the "Crys
tal Palace" — was stripped of nearly
its entire glass facade on one side.
"We're going to have to fix it in a
way that is stronger," schools super
intendent Frank Till said. •
Government officials and busi
ness executives scrambled to repair
buildings and find other places to
work. Broward County court offi
cials were trying to determine
whether sessions could be held at
the damaged courthouse in coming
davs.
