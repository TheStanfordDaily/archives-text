# NEW DEVELOPMENTS
## GRE finalizes overhaul Undergrads encouraged to consult with UAP 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ 
The Educational Testing Services (ETS)
announced that after four years of extensive
research, the Graduate Record Exam
(GRE) is finalizing its overhaul, and a new
version will be used beginning October 2006.
"The new test will emphasize complex
reasoning skills that are closely aligned to
graduate work," said David Payne, executive
director of the GRE Program in ETS's high
er education division, according to the ETS
Web site. "We'll include more real-life sce
narios and data interpretation questions, and
new, more focused writing questions. In addi
tion, the Verbal and Quantitative sections
will have new score scales. This will improve
the GRE test's usefulness to students and
graduate schools."

Another reason for the
change is to prevent cheating.
In the past, the test used a
computer-adaptive format, in
which the student's responses
to questions determined which

ones appeared next. Therefore,
every student had a different test.
However, using this method, ques
tions could be repeated from year to year,
and this encouraged students to share ques
tions with one another. With the new format,
every student will take the same test on a
given exam date and no questions will be re
peated.
Because the changes will affect students
taking the test next year, "students are invit
ed to consult with Sally Mentzer in the UAP,"
said Lorraine Sterritt, assistant vice provost
and director of Undergraduate Advising
Programs.
She said Mentzer can help students to find
out more about the changes and to further

pre
pare for the exam,
and"in addition, [Mentzer] will give them
copies of the GRF Information and Regis
tration Bulletin and the Undergraduate Re
search Program's [URP's] Guide to Apply
ing to Fellowships, Scholarships, and Gradu
ate Schools."
"Sally can also put undergraduates in con
tact with Stanford graduate students who will
tell them about their experience in applying
to graduate schools," Sterritt explained. "The
URP [also] runs workshops and provides ad
vice on writing personal statements for the

The Stanford Daily
application."
Sterritt explained that the GRE
bulletin describes the exam itself,and
the URP guide explains how the
GRE fits in with the rest of the mate
rials needed when applying to gradu
ate school.
"1 speak with about 60 students a
year individually regarding graduate
school in general," Mentzer said.
"There have been very few questions
about the GRE specifically, probably
because the GRE booklet and infor
mation on line is quite complete."
She also said that because stu
dents take the GRE at various times
during the year for various reasons,
the UAP does not have anv statistics

on how many Stanford students in a
given year take the GRE.
Senior Eric Mayefsky, who took
the test this summer, commented
that in comparison to other standard
ized tests he has taken, he did not like
the old GRE format.
"Not being able to do the ques
tions out of order makes time man
agement a much more difficult prob
lem, I think," he said. Mayefsky said
he feels that "the idea of a computer
adaptive test is interesting," but he
added that the way the test was grad
ed was not ideal.
Kevin Holmes, Class of 2(X)5, who
is planning to take the test next Mon
day, commented that a computer
adaptive test would "be an interest
ing experience." He said he is "nerv
ous" about the format, because he
usually skips questions and comes
back to them later. Holmes also stat
ed that he thinks the test will be "dif

ficult."
Because of the changes being im
plemented, the test will now be 90
minutes longer than the old format.
"I don't know if I like the idea of
making the test longer; it's pretty
draining," Mayefsky said.
Holmes also liked that the old test
was "not too long." However, be
cause he has not taken the test, he
doesn't know whether or not the new
test will be an improvement from the
old one.
In response to the changes,
Mayefsky said he thinks that chang
ing the test format will not change
people's perceptions of the test.
"I think people take it because
they have to, and their attitudes on it
result from their prior standardized
test experience, how important they
believe it is to the programs they're
applying to and word of mouth," he
said.
