## GRE finalizes overhaul Undergrads encouraged to consult with UAP 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ 
The Educational Testing Services (ETS)
announced that after four years of extensive
research, the Graduate Record Exam
(GRE) is finalizing its overhaul, and a new
version will be used beginning October 2006.
"The new test will emphasize complex
reasoning skills that are closely aligned to
graduate work," said David Payne, executive
director of the GRE Program in ETS's high
er education division, according to the ETS
Web site. "We'll include more real-life sce
narios and data interpretation questions, and
new, more focused writing questions. In addi
tion, the Verbal and Quantitative sections
will have new score scales. This will improve
the GRE test's usefulness to students and
graduate schools."

Another reason for the
change is to prevent cheating.
In the past, the test used a
computer-adaptive format, in
which the student's responses
to questions determined which

ones appeared next. Therefore,
every student had a different test.
However, using this method, ques
tions could be repeated from year to year,
and this encouraged students to share ques
tions with one another. With the new format,
every student will take the same test on a
given exam date and no questions will be re
peated.
Because the changes will affect students
taking the test next year, "students are invit
ed to consult with Sally Mentzer in the UAP,"
said Lorraine Sterritt, assistant vice provost
and director of Undergraduate Advising
Programs.
She said Mentzer can help students to find
out more about the changes and to further

pre
pare for the exam,
and"in addition, [Mentzer] will give them
copies of the GRF Information and Regis
tration Bulletin and the Undergraduate Re
search Program's [URP's] Guide to Apply
ing to Fellowships, Scholarships, and Gradu
ate Schools."
"Sally can also put undergraduates in con
tact with Stanford graduate students who will
tell them about their experience in applying
to graduate schools," Sterritt explained. "The
URP [also] runs workshops and provides ad
vice on writing personal statements for the
