## World-renowned classical dancer performs on campus 
### ROHAN KHARA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Indian classical dance is not just entertainment; it's
about being in a certain mood," said Malavika Sarrukai, ar
guably one of the best Indian dancers in the world during a
lecture-demonstration to a packed crowd in the Graduate
Community Center last night." It is very important to evoke
emotions from the heart. I want to show that classical dance
has a deeper quality."
The event — "Mudra:The poetry of Expression" — was
co-sponsored by Noopur, Sanskriti and the Stanford India
Association (SIA).
Bharat Natyam, the Indian classical dance from South
India, has been one of the oldest and richest classical dances
of India, with roots dating back more than 3,00() years.
Sarukkai performed several dances during the program,
stopping to explain the significance of each. She also told the
audience that her dances were tailored for the younger,
"college-level" crowd.
Aleta Hayes, a lecturer in the Department of Dance
and Theatre had tears in her eyes at the end of the per
formance.

"It transported me to a totally different
world," she said. "One thing which really moved
me was the way in which there was this unspo
ken magical language between the Malavi
ka, her mother and the musicians.There was
an internal connection between all of them
and had more to it than just an external
perspective. You could do all the training in
the world and not be able to dance and
communicate the way Malavika did today.
There was a marriage between the music
and the choreography, and this is what
this performance apart from the rest of ffH
performances."
Kalpana Desai, a docent with the Asian Art
Museum, said she enjoyed the symbolism of the
performance and how well the dancer was able to
communicate with the audience.

"It is a wonderful opportunity for learning more
about dance and communicating its symbolism," she
said. "The performance was par excellence. I have never
understood dance better, verbally and aesthetically. We
learn so much from these performances, and we in turn
teach the same to our students."
In an interview with The Daily, Sarukkai, in turn, praised
the exuberance of the Stanford crowd.
"What I really liked about the Stanford students was that
they were very alert and thirsty to see the classical dance,"
she said. "I could feel their enthusiasm right from the mo-

the questions of these intelligent
minds. 1 liked the intellect, and I could
feel that they were involved jn my
performance."
Sarukkai ended her presentation
with a look into the future of classical
dance.
"Classical Indian dance is not seri
ously looked upon, hut rather it is just
viewed as a 'style' of dancing,"
Sarukkai said."Whereas Indian clas
sical music is taken very seriously, I
am trying to make a shift in perspec
tive and demonstrate a deeper level
of the dance. A lot of such lecture
demonstrations are needed and only
then will the audience understand the
true feelings behind classical dance."
