# ON CAMPUS
## Vigil held for quake victims Students disappointed with campus awareness 
### GERRY SHIH DESK EDITOR 
A middle aged man in a dark red
sweater walked slowly around the
Old Union courtyard last night, his
expression blank as his eyes scanned
the edge of the stone fountain, ab
sorbing the numbers More than a
dozen signs were taped in a circle
around the fountain, displaying sta
tistics and pictures. Underneath the
faintly flickering flames from many
small candles, the words "80,360
killed" and a picture of an elderly
man with poorly wrapped bandages
covering his bald head was visibly
printed on two of the sheets.
Approximately 110 people at
tended the candlelight vigil for Pak
istani earthquake victims held last
night collectively by the Islamic Soci
ety of Stanford University, the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network and
Pakistanis at Stanford. The aim of
the vigil, according to event organiz
er Anita Mukherjee. a junior, was as
much a soothing opportunity for
praying and reflection as it was an
opportunity to raise awareness for
the earthquake — hence the signs
and statistics.
"The student reaction seems to be
very subdued, especially in relation
to Katrina," Mukherjee said."People
just didn't seem to know about it. If
you went on Google News,you won't
even find coverage. You don't get
that much news about it in America."
"People have to be concerned all
around the world," added junior
Ashfaque Siddiqui, a member of the
ISSU."We have people here who are
from Louisiana, who have family
there or who have gone to school in
Louisiana, so it's immediate. But
with the earthquake, it's so far away
and not as imminent."
Freshmen Yasmeen Abdul-
Karim and Jessica Long attended the
vigil, and agreed that the lack of
awareness or concern in the United
States, and even Stanford, was disap
pointing.
"You find TV stations showing
snippets of it on the news, and then it's
like, 'now, back to the game'," Abdul-
Karim said. "I'd go to my dorm right
now, and honestly half of the people
would know about the earthquake."
Long also believed that Stanford
students are "sheltered."
"It's really nice people are doing
this but it's surprising that people
aren't doing more around campus,"
she said. "There have only been 50
candles lit tonight so far, and [the or
ganizers] only expected and bought
300. Fora student population that's
6,000," Long trailed off and
shrugged, as her roommate Abdul-
Karim continued to write a prayer to
place beneath a candle.
"It's good to put thoughts on
paper," Long said.
The Office of Religious Life also
had a representative present — Fa
ther Patrick Laßelle gave a talk.

"There's a fairytale that goes on
here each weekend with the hun
dreds of weddings we have at Memo
rial Church; the world stops for half
an hour when there's only beauty
and happiness," he said. "But then
the doors open.The real world and all
the pain and suffering comes back.
It's moments like this that tie the
world together and brings a touch of
reality. Let's join hands with our dif
ferent religions and cultural back
ground and just be one people. It's a
sign that when people are really hurt
ing. we put our differences aside and
all share the burden."
Siddiqui manned the donations
desk, but acknowledged that the
meager donations he accepted were
not nearly enough to alleviate the fi
nancial burden shouldered so hope

lessly in Pakistan.
"We expect to get $200 or so in do
nations," Siddiqui said. "But a large
part of this tonight is to get people to
see how big of an impact the earth
quake has had on so many people. If
spending a few dollars can get you to
have this experience, then that's
what's important."
The man in the dark red sweater
finished walking around the foun
tain, and quietly made his way to the
donation desk. I le reached into his
wallet, took out at least thirty dollars
and quickly shoved it into the dona
tions box.
"I think I can at least do that," he
muttered meekly with a faded smile,
turned and quickly left the courtyard.
The sign next to the box had only re
quested two-dollar donations.

there or who have gone to school in
Louisiana, so it's immediate. But
with the earthquake, it's so far away
and not as imminent."
Freshmen Yasmeen Abdul-
Karim and Jessica Long attended the
vigil, and agreed that the lack of
awareness or concern in the United
States, and even Stanford, was disap
pointing.
"You find TV stations showing
snippets of it on the news, and then it's
like, 'now, back to the game'," Abdul-
Karim said. "I'd go to my dorm right
now, and honestly half of the people
would know about the earthquake."
Long also believed that Stanford
students are "sheltered."
"It's really nice people are doing
this but it's surprising that people
aren't doing more around campus,"
she said. "There have only been 50
candles lit tonight so far, and [the or
ganizers] only expected and bought
300. Fora student population that's
6,000," Long trailed off and
shrugged, as her roommate Abdul-
Karim continued to write a prayer to
place beneath a candle.
"It's good to put thoughts on
paper," Long said.
The Office of Religious Life also
had a representative present — Fa

"There's a fairytale that goes on
here each weekend with the hun

an hour when there's only beauty
and happiness," he said. "But then
the doors open.The real world and all
the pain and suffering comes back.
It's moments like this that tie the
world together and brings a touch of
reality. Let's join hands with our dif

all share the burden."
Siddiqui manned the donations
desk, but acknowledged that the
meager donations he accepted were
not nearly enough to alleviate the fi
nancial burden shouldered so hope

lessly in Pakistan.
"We expect to get $200 or so in do
nations," Siddiqui said. "But a large
part of this tonight is to get people to
see how big of an impact the earth
quake has had on so many people. If
spending a few dollars can get you to
have this experience, then that's
what's important."
The man in the dark red sweater
finished walking around the foun
tain, and quietly made his way to the
donation desk. I le reached into his
wallet, took out at least thirty dollars
and quickly shoved it into the dona
tions box.
"I think I can at least do that," he
muttered meekly with a faded smile,
turned and quickly left the courtyard.
The sign next to the box had only re
quested two-dollar donations.
A middle aged man in a dark red
sweater walked slowly around the
Old Union courtyard last night, his
expression blank as his eyes scanned
the edge of the stone fountain, ab
sorbing the numbers More than a
dozen signs were taped in a circle
around the fountain, displaying sta
tistics and pictures. Underneath the
faintly flickering flames from many
small candles, the words "80,360
killed" and a picture of an elderly
man with poorly wrapped bandages
covering his bald head was visibly
printed on two of the sheets.
Approximately 110 people at
tended the candlelight vigil for Pak
istani earthquake victims held last
night collectively by the Islamic Soci
ety of Stanford University, the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network and
Pakistanis at Stanford. The aim of
the vigil, according to event organiz
er Anita Mukherjee. a junior, was as
much a soothing opportunity for
praying and reflection as it was an
opportunity to raise awareness for
the earthquake — hence the signs
and statistics.
"The student reaction seems to be
very subdued, especially in relation
to Katrina," Mukherjee said."People
just didn't seem to know about it. If
you went on Google News,you won't
even find coverage. You don't get
that much news about it in America."
"People have to be concerned all
around the world," added junior
Ashfaque Siddiqui, a member of the
ISSU."We have people here who are
from Louisiana, who have family
there or who have gone to school in
Louisiana, so it's immediate. But
with the earthquake, it's so far away
and not as imminent."
