A middle aged man in a dark red
sweater walked slowly around the
Old Union courtyard last night, his
expression blank as his eyes scanned
the edge of the stone fountain, ab
sorbing the numbers More than a
dozen signs were taped in a circle
around the fountain, displaying sta
tistics and pictures. Underneath the
faintly flickering flames from many
small candles, the words "80,360
killed" and a picture of an elderly

Approximately 110 people at
tended the candlelight vigil for Pak

"You find TV stations showing
snippets of it on the news, and then it's
like, 'now, back to the game'," Abdul-
Karim said. "I'd go to my dorm right

would know about the earthquake."
Long also believed that Stanford
students are "sheltered."
