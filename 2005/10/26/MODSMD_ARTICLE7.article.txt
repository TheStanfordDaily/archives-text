## Senate addresses complaints Dining, Commencement top student dissatisfaction 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Student problems with Stanford Dining
Services and the 2(X)6 Commencement lo
cation topped the list of complaints re
ceived by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
during yesterday's office hours in White
Plaza. The Senate discussed these issues as
well as high Bookstore prices, an upcoming
Cultural Food Faire and funding issues last
night at their weekly meeting.
These complaints will be delegated to
Senate members who will contact individ
ual students with the status of their com
plaint or suggestion and will update them
on the ASSU Senate's efforts.
About 70 percent of the total complaints

concerned the food, prices and convenience
of Stanford dining services. The Senate
plans to ask Stanford Dining for the results
of student surveys to assess how Stanford
Dining can better serve students. The cur
rent dining system is based on survey sug
gestions from last year, according to Sena
tor Vang Kou Khang, a sophomore, so the
Senate plans to investigate to what extent
Stanford Dining took these surveys into
consideration.
"We're giving them the benefit of the
doubt, assuming that they are taking stu
dent input, but it's still something we'd like
to check up on." Khang said.
Khang also reported that the Stanford
Bookstore is losing money. According to
the Bookstore, prices of books are as low as
possible, even though they are the cause of
many student complaints.
