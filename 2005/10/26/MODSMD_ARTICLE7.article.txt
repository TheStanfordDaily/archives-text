## Senate addresses complaints Dining, Commencement top student dissatisfaction 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Student problems with Stanford Dining
Services and the 2(X)6 Commencement lo
cation topped the list of complaints re
ceived by the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
during yesterday's office hours in White
Plaza. The Senate discussed these issues as
well as high Bookstore prices, an upcoming
Cultural Food Faire and funding issues last
night at their weekly meeting.
These complaints will be delegated to
Senate members who will contact individ
ual students with the status of their com
plaint or suggestion and will update them
on the ASSU Senate's efforts.
About 70 percent of the total complaints

concerned the food, prices and convenience
of Stanford dining services. The Senate
plans to ask Stanford Dining for the results
of student surveys to assess how Stanford
Dining can better serve students. The cur
rent dining system is based on survey sug
gestions from last year, according to Sena
tor Vang Kou Khang, a sophomore, so the
Senate plans to investigate to what extent
Stanford Dining took these surveys into
consideration.
"We're giving them the benefit of the
doubt, assuming that they are taking stu
dent input, but it's still something we'd like
to check up on." Khang said.
Khang also reported that the Stanford
Bookstore is losing money. According to
the Bookstore, prices of books are as low as
possible, even though they are the cause of
many student complaints.
Senator Hershey Avula, a sopho
more, said that the professors of some
classes requiring enormous course
readers — many of those in political
science — are pushing toward digitiz
ing all of the course reading.
"The price for course readers is
much higher than we should expect.
They really overprice the course
readers," said freshman Hao Yan, an
intern for the ASSU Senate.
Senator Kai Lukoff, a sophomore,
also reported that a constitutional
amendment allowing a senator to go
abroad is "considerably more consti
tutionally challenging than we antici
pated." Therefore. the committee is
still deciding how they want to pro
ceed.
Two dates are set for the Cultural
Food Faire, a new initiative to foster
community diversity by having vari
ous student groups bring different
kinds of foods, according to Student
Life and Housing Chair Kat Kershn
er, a sophomore — Thursday, March
2 or Thursday, March 9.
The Senate also voted on funding
for student groups including the
Hindu Students Council, Organ
Donor Education and Amnesty In
ternational. Prism,a new book and art
review, asked fora sum of start up
money.
The Natural Path Mediation
Group asked for about $200. They
have scarcely asked for funding in
the past since "generally medita
tion means you're not attached to
physical possession," said Appro
priations Chair Faris Mohiuddin, a
junior.
A representative from the Stan
ford Alliance for Service Through
the Arts attended the meeting and
asked for an additional $2,000 with
the promise that the organization
will spend all of its reserves within
the next two years. However, the
Senate postponed deciding upon
this issue.
If the ASSU granted all student
group requests in full, it would have to
expand its general fees by 400 per
cent, according to Mohiuddin.
"All you guys who are in student
groups who are dissatisfied; I would
love to give you the money, but I liter
ally can't do it," Mohiuddin said.
