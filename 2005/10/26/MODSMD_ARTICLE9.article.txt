## U.S., France demand cooperation from Syria in investigation 
### EDITH M. LEDERER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
UNITED NATIONS (AP)—
Hie U.S. and France are pressing for
quick adoption of a new U.N. resolu
tion demanding Syria cooperate with
an investigation into the assassina
tion of Lebanon's former prime min
ister. hut Russia is concerned about
destabilizing the Mideast.
Washington and Paris quickly
joined forces to back a report by
German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis
that found evidence of Syrian in
volvement in Rafik Hariri's Feb. 14
assassination and a lack of coopera
tion from Damascus.
Mehlis was scheduled to brief the
U.N. Security Council Tuesday morn
ing on his report. Lebanon and Syria
have also asked to speak to the coun
cil, which is expected to start dis
cussing a new resolution later in the
week, though diplomats say no draft
has yet been circulated.
The United States has intensified
pressure on Syria following the re
port's release Thursday. President
Bush said "serious pressure" must be
applied against Damascus but that
diplomacy must be given a chance
before the United States takes any
military action.
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice urged Syria to drop its "noncha
lant attitude" about the Mehlis re
port's findings and U.S. Ambassador
John Bolton demanded that Svria

cooperate with the investigation.
"This is true confessions time now
for the government of Syria," Bolton
said."No more obstruction. No more
half measures. We want substantive
cooperation and we want it immedi
ately."
French Ambassador Jean-Marc
de La Sabliere said the Security
Council must use "its weight" to dis
cover "the whole truth" about the
Hariri assassination.
The Bush administration is talk
ing about Monday as a target date for
a resolution — and a ministerial
meeting of the Security Council to
give its adoption added prominence.
But Russia and China — both veto
wielding members of the council —
don't appear in any hurry, and
Moscow, which has close ties to
Syria, would likely oppose sanctions
or any reference to them.
"My government is always very

cautious with such sensitive issues as
Syria-Lebanon," Russia's U.N. Ambas
sador Andrey Denisov said Monday.
Russia's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mikhail Kamynin warned
in a statement Saturday that "the set
tlement of this problem should in no
way lead to the emergence of a new
hotbed of tension and further destabi
lization in the Middle East."
China's U.N. Ambassador Wang
Guangya told reporters: "We are still
studying the report so I don't want to
make any comments now ... It needs
careful study."
U.N. Secretary-General Annan
has extended Mehlis' investigation
until Dec. 15.
He reiterated Monday that the re
port was just the beginning of a
process, and when Mehlis completes
his work "the magistrates and the
judges will have to do theirs."
The United States and France,

who worked together on last year's
resolution demanding the withdraw
al of Syrian troops from Lebanon,
have been sounding out council
members on the elements of a new
resolution.
France indicated Monday it
would not support sanctions against
Syria before Mehlis finished his in
vestigation. Rice also indicated the
United States might be willing to put
off its push for sanctions.
"Let us allow that commission to
run its full course," French Foreign
Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy told
reporters in Paris on Monday.
"This is all about Syrian behav
ior," Rice told reporters later Mon
day en route to Canada, "but if peo
ple want to sequence it, fine, we can
sequence it."
What appears likely to emerge is a
resolution demanding that Syria co
operate with the Mehlis investigation.

have also asked to speak to the coun
cil, which is expected to start dis
cussing a new resolution later in the
week, though diplomats say no draft
has yet been circulated.
The United States has intensified
pressure on Syria following the re
port's release Thursday. President
Bush said "serious pressure" must be
applied against Damascus but that
diplomacy must be given a chance
before the United States takes any
military action.
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice urged Syria to drop its "noncha
lant attitude" about the Mehlis re
port's findings and U.S. Ambassador
John Bolton demanded that Svria

cooperate with the investigation.
"This is true confessions time now
for the government of Syria," Bolton
said."No more obstruction. No more
half measures. We want substantive
cooperation and we want it immedi
ately."
French Ambassador Jean-Marc
de La Sabliere said the Security
Council must use "its weight" to dis
cover "the whole truth" about the
Hariri assassination.
The Bush administration is talk
ing about Monday as a target date for
a resolution — and a ministerial
meeting of the Security Council to
give its adoption added prominence.
But Russia and China — both veto
wielding members of the council —
don't appear in any hurry, and
Moscow, which has close ties to
Syria, would likely oppose sanctions
or any reference to them.
"My government is always very

cautious with such sensitive issues as
Syria-Lebanon," Russia's U.N. Ambas
sador Andrey Denisov said Monday.
Russia's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mikhail Kamynin warned
in a statement Saturday that "the set
tlement of this problem should in no
way lead to the emergence of a new
hotbed of tension and further destabi
lization in the Middle East."
China's U.N. Ambassador Wang
Guangya told reporters: "We are still
studying the report so I don't want to
make any comments now ... It needs
careful study."
U.N. Secretary-General Annan
has extended Mehlis' investigation
until Dec. 15.
He reiterated Monday that the re
port was just the beginning of a
process, and when Mehlis completes
his work "the magistrates and the
judges will have to do theirs."
The United States and France,

who worked together on last year's
resolution demanding the withdraw
al of Syrian troops from Lebanon,
have been sounding out council
members on the elements of a new
resolution.
France indicated Monday it
would not support sanctions against
Syria before Mehlis finished his in
vestigation. Rice also indicated the
United States might be willing to put
off its push for sanctions.
"Let us allow that commission to
run its full course," French Foreign
Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy told
reporters in Paris on Monday.
"This is all about Syrian behav
ior," Rice told reporters later Mon
day en route to Canada, "but if peo
ple want to sequence it, fine, we can
sequence it."
What appears likely to emerge is a
resolution demanding that Syria co
operate with the Mehlis investigation.

Both the United States and France have followed Germany's lead, placing heavy pressure on Syria to cooperate in the
investigation looking into the assassination of Lebanon's former prime minister.
