WASHINGTON (AP) —Fed-
eral Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan yesterday praised the
useful advice provided to presidents
over the years by the Council of
Economic Advisers, a tiny White
House agency now headed by the
man expected to succeed
Greenspan.
Greenspan called the three
member council, created during the
Truman administration, "one of the
most successful goßvernment agen
cies in history."
The council is now headed by
Ben Bernanke, nominated by Presi
dent Bush on Monday to succeed
Greenspan at the Fed.
Greenspan said the council and
its supporting staff of professors on
leave from their universities have
been extremely effective in pro
moting good economic policies
and even more importantly, stop
ping bad economic ideas from
going forward.
"Throughout all this history, the
CEA has, in most cases, provided
the president with the best econom
ic advice available at the time and
has, crucially, been a consistent ad
vocate for the importance of mar
ket forces," Greenspan said in re
marks prepared for delivery in
Kansas City.
Greenspan's comments came
two days after President Bush an
nounced on Monday that he was
nominating Bernanke, who has
been head of the CEA since June, to
replace Greenspan as Fed chairman
starting in February. He made no
mention of Bernanke in his pre
pared remarks.
Greenspan noted in his remarks
that he was selected to be head of

the CEA by Richard Nixon and was
scheduled to have his confirmation
hearing in August 1974 on the day
that Nixon resigned the presidency
because of the Watergage scandal.
He said President Ford, who suc
ceeded Nixon, re-nominated
Greenspan for what he called a
"challenging time" in economic de
cision making and conceded, "We
did not solve all the problems we
confronted."
Ford was defeated in the 1976
election by Jimmy Carter, who
ran on platform that the Ford ad
ministration had failed to deal
with high unemployment and
high inflation.
Greenspan said when he took
over at the CEA in the fall of 1974,
the administration was focused on
combatting inflation but that in
just a few months, government
policy-makers realized that the
country had entered a recession
and the administration turned its
attention to promoting an eco
nomic recovery.
Greenspan said he found during
his time at the CEA that trying to
forecast the economy through the
use of ecoomic models had its lim
its. He said that he also learned how
invaluable timely economic data
could be.
"Because we had access to high
frequency data, we were able to see
that the sharp further downturn in
early 1975 reflected largely an in
ventory correct and that final de
mand was holding up," he said.
"That insight provided support for
the view that, so long as final de
mand was sustained, recovery was
imminent. As it turned out, that was
the right call."
He said he also learned that it
was important for economic policy
to take the long view.
