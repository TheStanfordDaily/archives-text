## Costumes, Cold and Craziness at the Castro 
### 
Is it just me. or is Halloween kind of stress
ful? There are so many decisions to be
made — What should I wear? Does my
costume suck? Should I dress up as a man or
a woman?
And then there's the big one — Am I
going to the Castro?
Halloween in the Castro promises to be
the biggest bash in town, and it definitely lives
up to its reputation. Last year, despite having
a Humßio midterm at 9 a.m. the next morn
ing, I went. I didn't do very well on the test, but
the experience was entirely worthwhile. I pet
ted a 7-foot penis, met a troupe of political ac
tivists and danced in the streets of San Francis
co with thousands of beautiful gay men.
This year I find myself defending the event
to skeptics who question its entertainment
value and, most of all, its safety. The Castro
event has a reputation for being wildly chaot
ic and a hub for drug use, street brawls, ran
dom violence and crazy drunks. In 2(X)2, for
instance, there five stabbings were reported
and dozens were arrested for public drunken
ness. Purportedly, someone even walked
around with a chainsaw turned on.
However, beginning in 2003, the city of
San Francisco got involved in the affair, ban
ning alcohol from the celebration and in
creasing the police presence with checkpoints
around the perimeter. Now in its third year of
reform, the Castro party is quite organized
and relatively safe. All attendees must pass
through gates where they are checked for al
cohol and weapons before entering the prem
ises, and there will be more SFPD personnel
than drag queens on the street.
Despite the city's best security efforts,
though, you should remain conscious of your
surroundings and use common sense to stay
safe. The event is still one huge street party,
after all. Stay with a group of friends and
arrange a meeting point in case you get separat
ed in the masses. Wear a costume that is com
fortable and warm, as it gets quite chilly despite
the abundance of body heat. And definitely do
not take alcohol to the event, or you may end
up spending the night in County Jail Nine.
Also, take public transit. Driving around
a city full of drunken trannies, Beyonces and
Bushes is difficult at best and parking is a
major challenge even on a normal day. If you
do drive, park far away from the Castro and
be prepared to walk. Large chunks of Market
and Castro Streets will be closed to vehicular
traffic, which should make the experience
much more pleasant and safe for pedestrians.
The best alternative to driving is the
beloved BART. The closest BART station to
the Castro is at 16th and Mission, about six
blocks from Market.The last Westbound (to
ward SFO/Millbrae/Stanford) leaves the 16th
Street Station at 1:08 a.m.— don't miss it.
You can even park your car at the Millbrae
BART station for free.
TTie Caltrain option is not as ideal because
no train runs between 12:01 a.m. and 4:55 a.m.
on weekdays.
Obviously, Halloween in the Castro is not
for everyone. If you don't like crowds or
naked men, you might be better off staying in
to watch scary movies or wandering around
Palo Alto trying to hit up our rich neighbors
for candy and cash. But if you are feeling a bit
adventurous and don't have a midterm Tues
day morning, by all means go to the Castro.
