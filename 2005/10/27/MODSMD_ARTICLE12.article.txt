## SHIRLEY TABOADA, Vaden Specialist STANFORD EXAMINES SEXUAL ASSAULT Vaden and YWCA collaborate to form Sexual Assault Center 
### KATIE JONES 
Sexual assault is the fastest growing violent crime in the
United States today. According to Vaden Health Center and
the YWCA Rape Crisis Center of Silicon Valley, one in three
women and one in five men will be sexually assaulted before
the age of 18. People between the ages of 16 and 24 are three
times more likely to be sexually assaulted and on college
campuses, one in four women have been victims of rape or at
tempted rape.
To address sexual assault at Stanford, Vaden recently col
laborated with the YWCA Rape Crisis Center to offer pro
fessional assistance in coping with this difficult and painful
issue. Located on the first floor of Vaden next to the pharma
cy, the YWCA Sexual Assault Center at Stanford opened its
doors to the campus community this May. Aid is available to
students, staff, faculty and other Stanford affiliates.
Shirley Taboada. a prevention and intervention specialist
at the newly-established center in Vaden, says that sexual as
sault transcends gender, age, race and social class.
"It can happen to anyone. It can happen anywhere. It can
happen anytime,"Taboada says.
Carole Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion Services
at Vaden, explains that the search fora centralized location
prompted Stanford's partnership with the YWCA.
"We were looking at our response to sexual assault dur
ing the last academic year," Pertofsky says. "We formed
focus groups with peer health educators and with other stu
dents. Those students identified issues regarding a couple of
things. First was having a strong sense of confidentiality. The
second was having one place to go that could help educate
students about their options to help coordinate all the serv
ices that they might want to access. We looked at ways and
methods to reach those goals. When we weighed and bal
anced other options, we decided that partnering with the Y
— which had 30 years of expertise in this area — was our
best option."
The 2(X)5 edition of the Stanford University Safety and Se
curity Almanac indicates three reports of forcible rape and
seven reports of forcible fondling in 2(X)4. According to Lean
dra Peloquin, the prevention services coordinator at the
YWCA, these incidents occur at Stanford "no more than on
any other college campus."
But Peloquin warns that these numbers are inherently de
ceptive and "far from reality." She says that because sexual
assault is extremely underreported, these incidents take
place much more often than the statistics suggest.
Taboada explains that sexual assault victims are often re
luctant to report what has happened to them because they
not only fear discussing the assault with strangers, but are also
terrified to face their perpetrators in court. She adds that vic
tims "can go through the whole trauma all over again just by
talking about it."
Among the vast array of services the center offers — from
basic sexual assault awareness and education to medical as
sistance and law enforcement advocacy — the YWCA Sexu
al Assault Center at Stanford particularly strives to provide
victims, their families and their friends with confidential
counseling and ongoing emotional support.
"We want the client to feel that he or she won't be judged
and that they have our unconditional support,"Taboada says.
If and when a survivor decides to report the incident, the
YWCA Sexual Assault Center says it will back him or her 1(H)
percent of the way through specialized case management.
"We will go to the police with them,"Taboada says. "We
will go to court with them. We will make sure their rights are
being respected. We will make sure they want to proceed."
Pertofsky stresses that the center "is not just here for
Stanford students, but is also here to serve everybody in the
Stanford community who has experienced sexual violence or
relationship violence."
She adds,"We're all very excited to have their offices here
at Vaden. I think students have a high degree of confidence in
the Y."
The Center provides victims with a dedicated 24-hour hot
line at (650) 725-9955. It also offers appointments and drop
in office hours on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2 to 4 p.m.,
and on Iliesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 5 p.m.

Sexual assault is the fastest growing violent crime in the
United States today. According to Vaden Health Center and
the YWCA Rape Crisis Center of Silicon Valley, one in three
women and one in five men will be sexually assaulted before
the age of 18. People between the ages of 16 and 24 are three
times more likely to be sexually assaulted and on college
campuses, one in four women have been victims of rape or at
tempted rape.
To address sexual assault at Stanford, Vaden recently col
laborated with the YWCA Rape Crisis Center to offer pro
fessional assistance in coping with this difficult and painful
issue. Located on the first floor of Vaden next to the pharma
cy, the YWCA Sexual Assault Center at Stanford opened its
doors to the campus community this May. Aid is available to
students, staff, faculty and other Stanford affiliates.
Shirley Taboada. a prevention and intervention specialist
at the newly-established center in Vaden, says that sexual as
sault transcends gender, age, race and social class.
"It can happen to anyone. It can happen anywhere. It can
happen anytime,"Taboada says.
Carole Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion Services
at Vaden, explains that the search fora centralized location
prompted Stanford's partnership with the YWCA.
"We were looking at our response to sexual assault dur
ing the last academic year," Pertofsky says. "We formed
focus groups with peer health educators and with other stu
dents. Those students identified issues regarding a couple of
things. First was having a strong sense of confidentiality. The
second was having one place to go that could help educate
students about their options to help coordinate all the serv
ices that they might want to access. We looked at ways and
methods to reach those goals. When we weighed and bal
anced other options, we decided that partnering with the Y
— which had 30 years of expertise in this area — was our
best option."
The 2(X)5 edition of the Stanford University Safety and Se
curity Almanac indicates three reports of forcible rape and
seven reports of forcible fondling in 2(X)4. According to Lean
dra Peloquin, the prevention services coordinator at the
YWCA, these incidents occur at Stanford "no more than on
any other college campus."
But Peloquin warns that these numbers are inherently de
ceptive and "far from reality." She says that because sexual
assault is extremely underreported, these incidents take
place much more often than the statistics suggest.
Taboada explains that sexual assault victims are often re
luctant to report what has happened to them because they
not only fear discussing the assault with strangers, but are also
terrified to face their perpetrators in court. She adds that vic
tims "can go through the whole trauma all over again just by
talking about it."
Among the vast array of services the center offers — from
basic sexual assault awareness and education to medical as
sistance and law enforcement advocacy — the YWCA Sexu
al Assault Center at Stanford particularly strives to provide
victims, their families and their friends with confidential
counseling and ongoing emotional support.
"We want the client to feel that he or she won't be judged
and that they have our unconditional support,"Taboada says.
If and when a survivor decides to report the incident, the
YWCA Sexual Assault Center says it will back him or her 1(H)
percent of the way through specialized case management.
"We will go to the police with them,"Taboada says. "We
will go to court with them. We will make sure their rights are
being respected. We will make sure they want to proceed."
Pertofsky stresses that the center "is not just here for
Stanford students, but is also here to serve everybody in the
Stanford community who has experienced sexual violence or
relationship violence."
She adds,"We're all very excited to have their offices here
at Vaden. I think students have a high degree of confidence in
the Y."
The Center provides victims with a dedicated 24-hour hot
line at (650) 725-9955. It also offers appointments and drop
in office hours on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2 to 4 p.m.,
and on Iliesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 5 p.m.
