# Med School panel on Katrina examines race, class, health care
## 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
"Social class affects which lives are taken
when you least expect it," said Paul Wise,
Stanford's Richard E. Behrman professor in
child health and society.
Wise was one of three Stanford profes
sors presenting on a panel entitled "Health
Care Issues and Hurricane Katrina" on
Monday at the School of Medicine. Samuel
Leßaron, professor of family medicine at
the Stanford Medical Center, and David
Magnus, director of the Center for Biomed
ical Ethics, also participated in the discus
sion. The panelists covered medical needs
of Katrina disaster victims and various
problems that prevent many from acquir
ing important resources.
While each panelist took his own slant,
the overarching theme of the presentation
was the obstacles in treating patients.
Leßaron documented his trip to Waveland
— a town about 50 miles from New Orleans
whose streets were flooded with more than

25 feet of water.
Leßaron assisted and treated Katrina
victims from a medical base established in
a 10-by-14-foot tent. A team of six Stan
ford medical students also joined in the
effort.
Most of the victims' disorders stemmed
from a combination of stress, hypertension
(high blood pressure) and diabetes, ac
cording to Leßaron. The patients often re
ported other symptoms, but the medical
team diagnosed the above ailments as un
derlying causes.
"The situation there was so different and
yet so similar to our own clinics," Leßaron
said during the panel.
He also discussed ethical issues he faced
while in Louisiana, such as the appropriate
scope of the medical students' responsibili
ties.
"Rules were often determined in an ad
hoc fashion," Leßaron explained to an audi
ence of mostly Stanford professors and
medical students. "There were many ques

tions left unanswered in the pell-mell rush
to provide care."
Also during the panel. Magnus laid out
sonic of the problems which led to Hurri
cane Katrina's disastrous consequences. In
particular, he claimed that it took a disaster
of Katrina's magnitude to finally call atten
tion to many problems embedded in Amer
ica's health care system.
Magnus spoke about the system's "ab
ject failures." characterizing its arrange
ment as one that leaves poor and minority
populations "woefully lacking." He also
cited the obstacles to health-care that vic
tims face even under normal circumstances
as reasons for the delay in aid for Katrina
victims.
To supplement questions regarding the
availability of help. Wise tackled the role
that race plays in health care acquisition,ex
plaining that even with "similar exposure,
one could encounter widely differing out
comes." He pointed out that risk exposure
and access are two separate problems that

often "travel together, like two birds in the
same wind."
As an example, he acknowledged the
"powerful gradients and social conditions"
which lead to disparities in infant mortality
rates between blacks and whites. While
some think race issues surface infrequently.
Wise argued that "these things are not
ephemeral; they are always happening in
the United States."
Wise also expressed his concern that in
terest in these important issues will not be
sustained despite the support the American
public has provided for victims so far.
"What worries me most. "Wise said in an
interview with The Daily, "is that the public
concern for the victims and the disparities in
health and discrimination in society will
evaporate as other political and national is
sues are raised."
But Leßaron lauded the student efforts
for Katrina relief so far. including one drive
currently being galvanized by students at
the School of Medicine. And in an interview

with Hie Daily, Lcßaron said he hopes to
see the drive's donations "target(ed) to spe
cific places and monitorjed] in a hands-on
way."
He added that medical students who
worked with him in Waveland plan to main
tain awareness of Katrina on campus by giv
ing a presentation of their experiences on
Nov. 1. Also, Leßaron said he plans to con
tinue talking about his relief work with the
undergraduates living in Roble Hall, where
he is a resident fellow.
Although there arc undoubtedly many
obstacles yet to be faced in New Orleans
and the surrounding areas, Leßaron under
scored the fact that many have already been
confronted and that relief work has touched
many people's lives.
"What really struck me," Leßaron said,
referring to his work in Louisiana,"was that
the majority of patients said to us, with tears
in their eyes, 'thank you so much. Not only
are you all here, but this is the best care I've
ever had.'"

Leßaron, professor of family medicine at
the Stanford Medical Center, and David
Magnus, director of the Center for Biomed
ical Ethics, also participated in the discus
sion. The panelists covered medical needs
of Katrina disaster victims and various
problems that prevent many from acquir
ing important resources.
While each panelist took his own slant,
the overarching theme of the presentation
was the obstacles in treating patients.
Leßaron documented his trip to Waveland
— a town about 50 miles from New Orleans
whose streets were flooded with more than

25 feet of water.
Leßaron assisted and treated Katrina
victims from a medical base established in
a 10-by-14-foot tent. A team of six Stan
ford medical students also joined in the
effort.
Most of the victims' disorders stemmed
from a combination of stress, hypertension
(high blood pressure) and diabetes, ac
cording to Leßaron. The patients often re
ported other symptoms, but the medical
team diagnosed the above ailments as un
derlying causes.
"The situation there was so different and
yet so similar to our own clinics," Leßaron
said during the panel.
He also discussed ethical issues he faced
while in Louisiana, such as the appropriate
scope of the medical students' responsibili
ties.
"Rules were often determined in an ad
hoc fashion," Leßaron explained to an audi
ence of mostly Stanford professors and
medical students. "There were many ques

tions left unanswered in the pell-mell rush
to provide care."
Also during the panel. Magnus laid out
sonic of the problems which led to Hurri
cane Katrina's disastrous consequences. In
particular, he claimed that it took a disaster
of Katrina's magnitude to finally call atten
tion to many problems embedded in Amer
ica's health care system.
Magnus spoke about the system's "ab
ject failures." characterizing its arrange
ment as one that leaves poor and minority
populations "woefully lacking." He also
cited the obstacles to health-care that vic
tims face even under normal circumstances
as reasons for the delay in aid for Katrina
victims.
To supplement questions regarding the
availability of help. Wise tackled the role
that race plays in health care acquisition,ex
plaining that even with "similar exposure,
one could encounter widely differing out
comes." He pointed out that risk exposure
and access are two separate problems that

often "travel together, like two birds in the
same wind."
As an example, he acknowledged the
"powerful gradients and social conditions"
which lead to disparities in infant mortality
rates between blacks and whites. While
some think race issues surface infrequently.
Wise argued that "these things are not
ephemeral; they are always happening in
the United States."
Wise also expressed his concern that in
terest in these important issues will not be
sustained despite the support the American
public has provided for victims so far.
"What worries me most. "Wise said in an
interview with The Daily, "is that the public
concern for the victims and the disparities in
health and discrimination in society will
evaporate as other political and national is
sues are raised."
But Leßaron lauded the student efforts
for Katrina relief so far. including one drive
currently being galvanized by students at
the School of Medicine. And in an interview

with Hie Daily, Lcßaron said he hopes to
see the drive's donations "target(ed) to spe
cific places and monitorjed] in a hands-on
way."
He added that medical students who
worked with him in Waveland plan to main
tain awareness of Katrina on campus by giv
ing a presentation of their experiences on
Nov. 1. Also, Leßaron said he plans to con
tinue talking about his relief work with the
undergraduates living in Roble Hall, where
he is a resident fellow.
Although there arc undoubtedly many
obstacles yet to be faced in New Orleans
and the surrounding areas, Leßaron under
scored the fact that many have already been
confronted and that relief work has touched
many people's lives.
"What really struck me," Leßaron said,
referring to his work in Louisiana,"was that
the majority of patients said to us, with tears
in their eyes, 'thank you so much. Not only
are you all here, but this is the best care I've
ever had.'"
"Social class affects which lives are taken
when you least expect it," said Paul Wise,
Stanford's Richard E. Behrman professor in
child health and society.
Wise was one of three Stanford profes
sors presenting on a panel entitled "Health
Care Issues and Hurricane Katrina" on
