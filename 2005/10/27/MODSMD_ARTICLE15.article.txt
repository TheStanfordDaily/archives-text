## Editorial Publication distribution policy needs reworking 
### 
We wish The Daily ended up outside
your dorm room everyday. But
that, our business manager tells us,
would be too expensive. In the meantime,
you might get The Stanford Review, the
Chappie and perhaps the Progressive deliv
ered to your rooms every few weeks. That is,
unless your dorm has chosen not to allow
door-to-door delivery and you have to pick
them up in some lounge somewhere.
We believe that if a publication wishes
make the effort to distribute door-to-door,
this should be accepted. Without direct dis
tribution, publications that are not daily will
have a hard time getting noticed when each
new issue comes out. Students always have
the option of putting the publication direct
ly in the recycling bin if they don't want to
read it.
The current policy of the Office of Resi
dential Education — despite a vote to the
contrary by the whole student body and a
subsequent separate vote by the ASSU Sen
ate — is an opt-in policy. In other words, the
appropriate dorm representative must
specifically allow a publication to be distrib
uted door-to-door, instead of having to
specifically forbid the publication from dis
tributing door-to-door.
This difference between an opt-in and an
opt-out policy is important. It is one thing for
a publication to be banned because of a con
scious opt-out choice; it is another thing en
tirely for the publication to be banned out of
neglect, because no one bothered to "opt in"
or remembered to vote on the issue — situ
ations that occur with alarming frequency.
We find Res Ed's lack of response to stu
dents' wishes aqnoying. ResEd, though
under no obligation to do so, should heed
student voice on an issue that affects stu
dents more than it does anyone else.
According to a news article in The Daily
last week ("Students question distribution
policy", Oct. 17), some dorms are ignoring
the encouragement of the ASSU Senate to
put door-to-door distribution up fora vote.
We find this reluctance silly, as the only way
a distribution ban will work is if it is seen as
representative of the general will of the
dorm, especially if it is already against the
general will of the student body. If only the
staff or the resident fellows decide on a ban,
The Stanford Review is less likely to respect
it — even though they should.
We are specifically vague about the
specifics of the policy because much regard
ing door-to-door distribution has never been
clarified. All dorms have policies — you can
see them on the Residential Education Web
site — but many of these policies were never
decided by students or even by the current
staff. These policies should be posted at en
trances and the notice should specify who
decided on the policy and when.

There are reasons for adopting a no door
to-door distribution policy. Student publica
tions must work directly with staff and RFs
to decrease the amount of litter they gener
ate and to make sure that distribution occurs
in an orderly manner. Groups should be
careful to slide publications under doors in
stead of leaving them out in the hall and stu
dents should pick them up promptly and not
create a burden for janitors. If a group de
cides to distribute door-to-door, it has a re
sponsibility to make the extra effort to make
sure it does so the right way.
With these guidelines in place, dorms
shouldn't have to preemptively ban door-to
door distribution for fear of the possibility
that they might create a mess. They could
wait to see if the problem actually arises.
And it shouldn't if the publication is slipped
under the door.
Of course, it is inevitable that door-to
door distribution will slightly inconvenience
some people. That said, most of the reasons
— direct or implicit — for denying distribu
tion involve stifling certain speech, usually
that ofThe Review. This is unacceptable. Al
though many students dislike The Review, its
viewpoint still deserves to be noted and it
should have just as much chance to get read
as The Daily. For The Review, that means it
needs door-to-door distribution.
We do think that The Review, Progressive
and the Chaparral should explore other av
enues for distribution as well. Signing people
up for an e-mail list and channeling their ef
fort into an interesting Web site might be a
better use of resources than fighting the
door-to-door distribution policy. But still, if
student fees (through the ASSU Publica
tions Board) go into paying for the printing
of thousands of publications, these groups
should get to students more directly than the
current policy allows.
The harm of this opt-in policy is perhaps
most insidious not to existing publications,
which already have a reader base, but to a
hypothetical new publication.The most cost
efficient way to get people to know about
such a publication's existence is through
door-to-door distribution. It is unreasonable
to think that students will actively seek out
new publications. Without door-to-door dis
tribution, it is hard to see how such an effort
would get off the ground.
ResEd should be in the business of open
ing — not closing — a dialogue. It should re
flect the wishes of students by changing its
current opt-in policy to opt-out. Ilie relevant
student publications should be able to make
their cases during house meetings before
votes are taken. Distribution bans might
make sense, but the way everyone —from
administrators to staff to RFs — is currently
applying them seems too much like selective
censorship for our taste.

wait to see if the problem actually arises.
And it shouldn't if the publication is slipped
under the door.
Of course, it is inevitable that door-to
door distribution will slightly inconvenience
some people. That said, most of the reasons
— direct or implicit — for denying distribu
tion involve stifling certain speech, usually
that ofThe Review. This is unacceptable. Al
though many students dislike The Review, its
viewpoint still deserves to be noted and it
should have just as much chance to get read
as The Daily. For The Review, that means it
needs door-to-door distribution.
We do think that The Review, Progressive
and the Chaparral should explore other av
enues for distribution as well. Signing people
up for an e-mail list and channeling their ef
fort into an interesting Web site might be a
better use of resources than fighting the
door-to-door distribution policy. But still, if
student fees (through the ASSU Publica
tions Board) go into paying for the printing
of thousands of publications, these groups
should get to students more directly than the
current policy allows.
The harm of this opt-in policy is perhaps
most insidious not to existing publications,
which already have a reader base, but to a
hypothetical new publication.The most cost
efficient way to get people to know about
such a publication's existence is through
door-to-door distribution. It is unreasonable
to think that students will actively seek out
new publications. Without door-to-door dis
tribution, it is hard to see how such an effort
would get off the ground.
ResEd should be in the business of open
ing — not closing — a dialogue. It should re
flect the wishes of students by changing its
current opt-in policy to opt-out. Ilie relevant
student publications should be able to make
their cases during house meetings before
votes are taken. Distribution bans might
make sense, but the way everyone —from
administrators to staff to RFs — is currently
applying them seems too much like selective
censorship for our taste.

Unsigned editorials in the space above represent the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The

We wish The Daily ended up outside
your dorm room everyday. But
that, our business manager tells us,
would be too expensive. In the meantime,
you might get The Stanford Review, the
Chappie and perhaps the Progressive deliv
ered to your rooms every few weeks. That is,
unless your dorm has chosen not to allow
door-to-door delivery and you have to pick
them up in some lounge somewhere.
We believe that if a publication wishes
make the effort to distribute door-to-door,
this should be accepted. Without direct dis
tribution, publications that are not daily will
have a hard time getting noticed when each
new issue comes out. Students always have
the option of putting the publication direct
ly in the recycling bin if they don't want to
read it.
The current policy of the Office of Resi
dential Education — despite a vote to the
contrary by the whole student body and a
subsequent separate vote by the ASSU Sen
ate — is an opt-in policy. In other words, the
appropriate dorm representative must
specifically allow a publication to be distrib
uted door-to-door, instead of having to
specifically forbid the publication from dis
tributing door-to-door.
This difference between an opt-in and an
opt-out policy is important. It is one thing for
a publication to be banned because of a con
scious opt-out choice; it is another thing en
tirely for the publication to be banned out of
neglect, because no one bothered to "opt in"
or remembered to vote on the issue — situ
ations that occur with alarming frequency.
We find Res Ed's lack of response to stu
dents' wishes aqnoying. ResEd, though
under no obligation to do so, should heed
student voice on an issue that affects stu
dents more than it does anyone else.
According to a news article in The Daily
last week ("Students question distribution
policy", Oct. 17), some dorms are ignoring
the encouragement of the ASSU Senate to
put door-to-door distribution up fora vote.
We find this reluctance silly, as the only way
a distribution ban will work is if it is seen as
representative of the general will of the
dorm, especially if it is already against the
general will of the student body. If only the
staff or the resident fellows decide on a ban,
The Stanford Review is less likely to respect
it — even though they should.
We are specifically vague about the
specifics of the policy because much regard
ing door-to-door distribution has never been
clarified. All dorms have policies — you can
see them on the Residential Education Web
site — but many of these policies were never
decided by students or even by the current
staff. These policies should be posted at en
trances and the notice should specify who
decided on the policy and when.

There are reasons for adopting a no door
to-door distribution policy. Student publica
tions must work directly with staff and RFs
to decrease the amount of litter they gener
ate and to make sure that distribution occurs
in an orderly manner. Groups should be
careful to slide publications under doors in
stead of leaving them out in the hall and stu
dents should pick them up promptly and not
create a burden for janitors. If a group de
cides to distribute door-to-door, it has a re
sponsibility to make the extra effort to make
sure it does so the right way.
With these guidelines in place, dorms
shouldn't have to preemptively ban door-to
door distribution for fear of the possibility
that they might create a mess. They could
wait to see if the problem actually arises.
