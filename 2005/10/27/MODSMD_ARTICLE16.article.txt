An Open Letter to Graduating Students
and their Families:
As you may know, the University recent
ly announced plans to hold the University
wide 2006 Commencement ceremony at
Frost Amphitheater. This announcement
has generated considerable concern and re
sponse from graduating students and family
members.
First, a little background: Because of
major renovations at Stanford Stadium, it
will be necessary to hold the University
wide Commencement ceremony at an alter
nate site in 2006. We considered a wide
range of options, including on- and off-cam
pus alternatives. Given the importance of
the more personal departmental diploma
ceremonies, we determined that logistics —
the prospect of moving thousands of people
many miles in a short period of time —
would prevent us from holding the main
ceremony off campus. Of the on-campus
sites, we believed Frost Amphitheater was
the best site for June's ceremony despite
some drawbacks, including the need to limit
the number of tickets available for gradu
ates' families.
Based on the feedback of those people
who contacted us in the last few days, the
most important criterion fora Commence
ment site for many students is the ability to
accommodate the maximum number of
guests. For that reason, we have decided to
reconsider the decision and provide two ad
ditional alternatives for your consideration,
and we are providing information on those
sites below. We encourage you to share your
preference with us by sending an e-mail to
gradsite@ppo.stanford.edu.
Stanford Commencement is a weekend

long celebration during which most events
— including the diploma ceremonies, Bac
calaureate, the Class Day Luncheon and the
Presidents Reception at Hoover House —
are open to entire families. There will be, of
course, scores of other receptions, parties
and ceremonies at which graduates' guests
also will be welcome.
The hour-long University-wide ceremo
ny provides no opportunity for the recogni
tion of individual graduates; indeed, it is typ
ically difficult for many family members and
guests to identify their graduate. The diplo
ma ceremonies that immediately follow the
University-wide Commencement ceremo
ny are the focus of recognition of individual
graduates and their achievements. It is at
these departmental ceremonies where
graduates receive their diplomas and are
awarded honors. The diploma Commence
ment ceremonies will continue to be open to
an unlimited number of guests for each
graduate.
We are interested in hearing your re
sponses to the following sites for the Univer
sity-wide ceremony listed below:
• Kohle Field: Can accommodate about
seven tickets per graduate. The existing
Commencement raised stage would be
used. Seating would be on folding chairs
on the Roble lawn. Viewing of the ceremo
ny would be enhanced by use of two Jum
botron-style screens. Alternate seating for
those who prefer indoor accommodations
would be provided at another site where
the ceremonies would be telecast. Nearby
parking would be limited; primary parking
facilities would be up to one-half mile
from the field.
Football Practice Field: (located
behind Maples Pavilion): Can ac
commodate approximately nine
tickets per graduate. The existing
Commencement raised stage
would be used. Seating would be
on folding chairs on the practice
field. Viewing of the ceremony
would be enhanced by use of two
Jumbotron-style screens. Alter
nate seating for those who prefer
indoor accommodations would
be provided at another site where
the ceremonies would be telecast.
Parking would be available in nu
merous locations in close proxim
ity to the field.

• Frost Amphitheater: Can accom
modate approximately four tick
ets per graduate. A modified stage
would be constructed for the
Commencement. Seating would
be on folding chairs. Additional
guests would be able to view the
Commencement in a nearby in
door location where the cere
monies would be telecast. Parking
would be available in numerous
locations in close proximity to the
amphitheater. Frost Amphithe
ater served as the site for Com
mencement for approximately 45
years.
Thank you for considering these op
tions. We look forward to hearing from
you at gradsite<s>ppo.stanford.edu.

An Open Letter to Graduating Students
and their Families:
As you may know, the University recent
ly announced plans to hold the University
wide 2006 Commencement ceremony at
Frost Amphitheater. This announcement
has generated considerable concern and re
sponse from graduating students and family
members.
First, a little background: Because of
major renovations at Stanford Stadium, it
will be necessary to hold the University
wide Commencement ceremony at an alter
nate site in 2006. We considered a wide
range of options, including on- and off-cam
pus alternatives. Given the importance of
the more personal departmental diploma
ceremonies, we determined that logistics —
the prospect of moving thousands of people
many miles in a short period of time —
would prevent us from holding the main
ceremony off campus. Of the on-campus
sites, we believed Frost Amphitheater was
the best site for June's ceremony despite
some drawbacks, including the need to limit
the number of tickets available for gradu
ates' families.
Based on the feedback of those people
who contacted us in the last few days, the
most important criterion fora Commence
ment site for many students is the ability to
accommodate the maximum number of
guests. For that reason, we have decided to
reconsider the decision and provide two ad
ditional alternatives for your consideration,
and we are providing information on those
sites below. We encourage you to share your
preference with us by sending an e-mail to
gradsite@ppo.stanford.edu.
Stanford Commencement is a weekend

long celebration during which most events
— including the diploma ceremonies, Bac
calaureate, the Class Day Luncheon and the
Presidents Reception at Hoover House —
are open to entire families. There will be, of
course, scores of other receptions, parties
and ceremonies at which graduates' guests
also will be welcome.
The hour-long University-wide ceremo
ny provides no opportunity for the recogni
tion of individual graduates; indeed, it is typ
ically difficult for many family members and
guests to identify their graduate. The diplo
ma ceremonies that immediately follow the
University-wide Commencement ceremo
ny are the focus of recognition of individual
graduates and their achievements. It is at
these departmental ceremonies where
graduates receive their diplomas and are
awarded honors. The diploma Commence
ment ceremonies will continue to be open to
an unlimited number of guests for each
graduate.
We are interested in hearing your re
sponses to the following sites for the Univer
sity-wide ceremony listed below:
• Kohle Field: Can accommodate about
seven tickets per graduate. The existing
Commencement raised stage would be
used. Seating would be on folding chairs
on the Roble lawn. Viewing of the ceremo
ny would be enhanced by use of two Jum
botron-style screens. Alternate seating for
those who prefer indoor accommodations
would be provided at another site where
the ceremonies would be telecast. Nearby
parking would be limited; primary parking
facilities would be up to one-half mile
from the field.
Football Practice Field: (located
behind Maples Pavilion): Can ac
commodate approximately nine
tickets per graduate. The existing
Commencement raised stage
would be used. Seating would be
on folding chairs on the practice
field. Viewing of the ceremony
would be enhanced by use of two
Jumbotron-style screens. Alter
nate seating for those who prefer
indoor accommodations would
be provided at another site where
the ceremonies would be telecast.
Parking would be available in nu
merous locations in close proxim
ity to the field.

• Frost Amphitheater: Can accom
modate approximately four tick
ets per graduate. A modified stage
would be constructed for the
Commencement. Seating would
be on folding chairs. Additional
guests would be able to view the
Commencement in a nearby in

monies would be telecast. Parking
