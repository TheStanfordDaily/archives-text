# The
						Pavlovian dogs of education
## 
### 
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, in the early 20th
Century, carried out a host of experiments
in which he investigated the salivary
habits of dogs. Before each dog was served
her food, Pavlov would signal the event by a
host of auditory stimuli including tuning
forks, whistles and metronomes. Later, he
found out that the dogs would salivate in re
sponse to the auditory stimuli, even in the ab
sence of any food. This reflex was called
"conditioned (or conditional) reflex" as op
posed to innate reflexes (such as moving
your hand away from a flame to avoid pain).
As a student, I must scathingly acknowl
edge the current parallel our educational in
stitutions bear to Pavlov's classical experi
ment and the psycho-situational forces that,
more and more each day, try to reduce the
role of the student to a Pavlovian dog. We,
too, are Pavlovian dogs that are expected to
salivate intellectual juices to the cold and
impersonal tunes of grades. We have been
"conditioned" since childhood to learn to
the "tunes" of grades and to be punished if
we do not.
Grades are false and perverted motiva
tors of learning. I remember a Calvin and
Hobbes strip, where Calvin asks Hobbes, "Is
it truly being good if the only reason I behave
well is so I can get more loot at Christmas? I
mean, really, all I'm doing is saying I can be
bribed." Similarly, the student whose only
motivation for work is grades has to ask her
self whether she is doing anything more than
"saying I can be bribed." In stark contrast to
grade-motivated learning. I'd like to offer in

trinsicaiiy-motivated learning.
When I suggest the notion of a gradeless
education, I am often lauded for my "ideal
ism" but criticized for "lack of realism." The
main objection to my proposal is that in such
a chaotic education, individuals would pro
duce no output without a system of rewards
and punishments. That may be so in the cur
rent system — if you don't play the tunes,
you don't get any juice. However, a complete
elimination of grades in education at all lev
els (especially during childhood) and an ab
solute freedom about what to study may lead
to counterintuitive results.
1 believe the desire to learn and engage in
creative activities is an offshoot of our ration
al capacities. This desire resides in the core of
our human nature. It is especially manifest in
the behavior of young children who experi
ment with their environment and bother
adults with annoying questions. My belief is
that if institutional forces such as grades do
not deny and repress this core, it will flourish
and vent most resonantly.
Radical considerations aside, it is possible
to see the faulty assumptions upon which

our education works. First of all, "rewards"
(good grades) are often distributed relative
ly by a curve — how well one does is deter
mined relative to how others do. However,
there is no scientific or logical law that com
pels us to conclude that a group of people
cannot collectively excel or fail. It would be
more reasonable to set absolute criteria in
dependent of a groups output and judge the
output versus these criteria. This method is
often employed in fuzzy classes, but in these
cases arbitrariness still occurs in the subjec
tive and idiosyncratic tendencies of the in
structor. By their nature, papers cannot be
graded precisely.
Any education that depends on grades
has as its pillars examinations. Perhaps these
serve as the most grotesque repressors of any
desire for creative work. The exercises of the
average exam do not go beyond petty aca
demic hoops which we, as Pavlovian dogs,
must jump through.There isn't any creativity,
only a strong reaffirmation of what one has
been told.
However, perhaps the worst shortcoming
of an exam is its randomness. Imagine two
students — the passionate learner and the
sneaky pragmatist. The passionate learner is
in general a more competent student and en
joys investing her ego in challenges. The
sneaky pragmatist only plays the game for
grades. On a test, the passionate learner gets
stuck on a question (the second-to-last one),
but due to her confidence in her abilities and
