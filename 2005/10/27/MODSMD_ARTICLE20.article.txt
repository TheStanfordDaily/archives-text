## Seniors, start your guilt trips 
### 
I think having Commencement at Frost
Amphitheater is a good idea. There, I said
it. Maybe being so far removed from
Stanford gives me powerful and unparalleled
insights into the situation. Or perhaps I'm
free to voice my opinion because I'm 10,000
miles away and safe from lynch mobs, mail
bombs, Mikey Lee or whatever other cruel
punishment you seniors might unleash upon
me. My sister Anne, on the other hand, can be
found on the third floor of Junipero — ex
cept when she is at squash practice, which is
4-6 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays. And
she's afraid of insects and the dark.
But I will help because I like solving prob
lems, even though this really isn't my problem
since the stadium will be finished by the time
I graduate. Because my mother reads this col
umn — that graduation will occur with hon
ors in 2007, right before I marry my fiancee
Piper, who went to Miss Porter's, majored in
art history, enjoys sailing and making ginger
bread houses and has a house on Nantucket.
Back to the problem at hand. From what I
can divine from a Daily article and a few opin
ions pieces, it looks like some seniors are

upset that they can't invite more than four
people to Commencement, which is a legiti
mate gripe. But some of the threats they are
issuing are ridiculous. Some optimistic lass re
cently created a Facebook group called "If I
Have to Graduate in Frost, I'm Not Giving
Stanford Any Money." No, friend, that's the
point. You have already given Stanford all of
your money. You think they give a shit about
the $20 or whatever that you're going to mail
in once a year for the next 30 years? No. And
by the time you have any money to give,you'll
have idealized your college experience to the
point that you'll shell out any amount to walk
around campus in a wicker hat and pretend
you are off to an ice cream social or whatever
else you tell your kids you did here. But I di
gress. Point is, Hennessy and his gang don't re
ally give a damn what a bunch of half-drunk,
soon-to-be-unemployed college kids think.
Where do we go from here, you hippie
slackers ask? Well, there are two fronts the
seniors ought to pursue.
The first is negotiation. Pretend this is a
divorce where you're the kids, and squeeze
the administration for outlandish and wild

compensation. Demand a great Commence
ment speaker for starters. If Hennessy tries
to pawn off the president of Malawi on you,
come back at it with a hardcore guilt trip —
just like when you come home for winter
break, still hungover because your last final
was on TUesday, and you manage to convince
your mom that you're so stressed out that
you need breakfast in bed every day. And not
some cereal junk, either — the real deal, with
eggs and bacon and cantaloupe and hot
chocolate with marshmallows (the big ones,
not those tiny things already in the cocoa
powder). Other reparations you might de
mand include a free Senior Pub Night (much
better than a party the night before gradua
tion, what with parents milling around cam
pus and all) or arguing for something cooler
than a keychain from the Stanford Alumni
Association. Like Stanford monogrammed
iPods or a public viewing of the Crothers
Memorial sex tapes.
If you don't get results with the puppy
dog eyes, a good old-fashioned march on
