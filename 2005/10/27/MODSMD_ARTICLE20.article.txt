## Seniors, start your guilt trips 
### 
I think having Commencement at Frost
Amphitheater is a good idea. There, I said
it. Maybe being so far removed from
Stanford gives me powerful and unparalleled
insights into the situation. Or perhaps I'm
free to voice my opinion because I'm 10,000
miles away and safe from lynch mobs, mail
bombs, Mikey Lee or whatever other cruel
punishment you seniors might unleash upon
me. My sister Anne, on the other hand, can be
found on the third floor of Junipero — ex
cept when she is at squash practice, which is
4-6 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays. And
she's afraid of insects and the dark.
But I will help because I like solving prob
lems, even though this really isn't my problem
since the stadium will be finished by the time
I graduate. Because my mother reads this col
umn — that graduation will occur with hon
ors in 2007, right before I marry my fiancee
Piper, who went to Miss Porter's, majored in
art history, enjoys sailing and making ginger
bread houses and has a house on Nantucket.
Back to the problem at hand. From what I
can divine from a Daily article and a few opin
ions pieces, it looks like some seniors are

upset that they can't invite more than four
people to Commencement, which is a legiti
mate gripe. But some of the threats they are
issuing are ridiculous. Some optimistic lass re
cently created a Facebook group called "If I
Have to Graduate in Frost, I'm Not Giving
Stanford Any Money." No, friend, that's the
point. You have already given Stanford all of
your money. You think they give a shit about
the $20 or whatever that you're going to mail
in once a year for the next 30 years? No. And
by the time you have any money to give,you'll
have idealized your college experience to the
point that you'll shell out any amount to walk
around campus in a wicker hat and pretend
you are off to an ice cream social or whatever
else you tell your kids you did here. But I di
gress. Point is, Hennessy and his gang don't re
ally give a damn what a bunch of half-drunk,
soon-to-be-unemployed college kids think.
Where do we go from here, you hippie
slackers ask? Well, there are two fronts the
seniors ought to pursue.
The first is negotiation. Pretend this is a
divorce where you're the kids, and squeeze
the administration for outlandish and wild

compensation. Demand a great Commence
ment speaker for starters. If Hennessy tries
to pawn off the president of Malawi on you,
come back at it with a hardcore guilt trip —
just like when you come home for winter
break, still hungover because your last final
was on TUesday, and you manage to convince
your mom that you're so stressed out that
you need breakfast in bed every day. And not
some cereal junk, either — the real deal, with
eggs and bacon and cantaloupe and hot
chocolate with marshmallows (the big ones,
not those tiny things already in the cocoa
powder). Other reparations you might de
mand include a free Senior Pub Night (much
better than a party the night before gradua
tion, what with parents milling around cam
pus and all) or arguing for something cooler
than a keychain from the Stanford Alumni
Association. Like Stanford monogrammed
iPods or a public viewing of the Crothers
Memorial sex tapes.
If you don't get results with the puppy
dog eyes, a good old-fashioned march on
Hennessy's house just might do the
trick. True, when SLAC tried that a
year ago, the president was gone and
Mrs. Hennessy called the cops, but
some grassroots action is still more
effective than making a Facebook
group, which by its very nature is
read only by students (and John
Bravman).
I only took one quarter of Man
darin, but I think Lisa Simpson once
said that the Chinese symbols for
crisis and opportunity are the same.
Your second priority, then, ought to
be finding ways to exploit this situa

tion to your benefit. I see a huge po
tential for scalping, for example. Just
two people in your family are com
ing? Why not auction off the other
pair of tickets to a desperate senior
from the Bay Area with dozens of
friends and family members eagei#to
attend? It'll probably be the only
money you earn fora while, plus you
get to stick it to that asshole from
Los Altos who always got to take his
girlfriend home when his parents
left town.
Also, you can use those precious
seats at Frost as leverage with family
members. "I know that Maples is
very hot and the stairs will hurt your
arthritis. Grandma. Maybe cutting
the Maryland cousins out of the trust
would help?"
In other news, I decided not to

write about my ridiculously de
baucherous trip to Prague because
people complained that this column
was becoming too much like a blog
from overseas. But e-mail me if you
like the old format better. Also, I
have no beef with Mikey Lee. Oh,
and if I read my copy of Tuesday's
Daily correctly. Ambassador Joseph
Wilson called conservative pundit
Robert Novak a douchebag when
speaking with a reporter from The
Daily ("Scandal amid service," Oct.
25). Well done, sir.

David Herbert would like to assure
his mom that he has never pretended
to he stressed just to get breakfast in
bed while hungover. Tell him you
want the travel blog back at dher
bert@stanford. edit.

Also, you can use those precious

In other news, I decided not to

write about my ridiculously de
baucherous trip to Prague because
people complained that this column
was becoming too much like a blog

like the old format better. Also, I
have no beef with Mikey Lee. Oh,
and if I read my copy of Tuesday's
Daily correctly. Ambassador Joseph
Wilson called conservative pundit
Robert Novak a douchebag when
speaking with a reporter from The
Daily ("Scandal amid service," Oct.
25). Well done, sir.

I think having Commencement at Frost
Amphitheater is a good idea. There, I said
it. Maybe being so far removed from
Stanford gives me powerful and unparalleled
insights into the situation. Or perhaps I'm
free to voice my opinion because I'm 10,000
miles away and safe from lynch mobs, mail
bombs, Mikey Lee or whatever other cruel
punishment you seniors might unleash upon
me. My sister Anne, on the other hand, can be
found on the third floor of Junipero — ex
cept when she is at squash practice, which is
4-6 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays. And
she's afraid of insects and the dark.
But I will help because I like solving prob
lems, even though this really isn't my problem
since the stadium will be finished by the time
I graduate. Because my mother reads this col
umn — that graduation will occur with hon
ors in 2007, right before I marry my fiancee
Piper, who went to Miss Porter's, majored in
art history, enjoys sailing and making ginger
bread houses and has a house on Nantucket.
Back to the problem at hand. From what I
can divine from a Daily article and a few opin
ions pieces, it looks like some seniors are

upset that they can't invite more than four
people to Commencement, which is a legiti
mate gripe. But some of the threats they are
issuing are ridiculous. Some optimistic lass re
cently created a Facebook group called "If I
Have to Graduate in Frost, I'm Not Giving
Stanford Any Money." No, friend, that's the
point. You have already given Stanford all of
your money. You think they give a shit about
the $20 or whatever that you're going to mail
in once a year for the next 30 years? No. And
by the time you have any money to give,you'll
have idealized your college experience to the
point that you'll shell out any amount to walk
around campus in a wicker hat and pretend
you are off to an ice cream social or whatever
else you tell your kids you did here. But I di
gress. Point is, Hennessy and his gang don't re
ally give a damn what a bunch of half-drunk,
soon-to-be-unemployed college kids think.
Where do we go from here, you hippie
slackers ask? Well, there are two fronts the
seniors ought to pursue.
The first is negotiation. Pretend this is a
divorce where you're the kids, and squeeze
the administration for outlandish and wild

compensation. Demand a great Commence
ment speaker for starters. If Hennessy tries
to pawn off the president of Malawi on you,
come back at it with a hardcore guilt trip —
just like when you come home for winter
break, still hungover because your last final
was on TUesday, and you manage to convince
your mom that you're so stressed out that
you need breakfast in bed every day. And not
some cereal junk, either — the real deal, with
eggs and bacon and cantaloupe and hot
chocolate with marshmallows (the big ones,
not those tiny things already in the cocoa
powder). Other reparations you might de
mand include a free Senior Pub Night (much
better than a party the night before gradua
tion, what with parents milling around cam
pus and all) or arguing for something cooler
than a keychain from the Stanford Alumni
Association. Like Stanford monogrammed
iPods or a public viewing of the Crothers
Memorial sex tapes.
If you don't get results with the puppy
dog eyes, a good old-fashioned march on
Hennessy's house just might do the
trick. True, when SLAC tried that a
year ago, the president was gone and
Mrs. Hennessy called the cops, but
some grassroots action is still more
effective than making a Facebook
group, which by its very nature is
read only by students (and John
Bravman).
I only took one quarter of Man
darin, but I think Lisa Simpson once
said that the Chinese symbols for
crisis and opportunity are the same.
Your second priority, then, ought to
be finding ways to exploit this situa

tion to your benefit. I see a huge po
tential for scalping, for example. Just
two people in your family are com
ing? Why not auction off the other
pair of tickets to a desperate senior
from the Bay Area with dozens of
friends and family members eagei#to
attend? It'll probably be the only
money you earn fora while, plus you
get to stick it to that asshole from
Los Altos who always got to take his
girlfriend home when his parents
left town.
