Harvard only provides two tickets per graduate
I'm not Larry Summers, the president of Har
vard, but 1 can respond to Katie Miller's question
— posed in a letter to the editor on Oct. 25 —
about what Harvard would do if faced with not
having a football stadium for Commencement.
Harvard would (and does) give you not unlimited
tickets, not seven tickets, not four tickets, but two
tickets to its commencement. And your chosen
family members have to arrive at 6 a.m. in order to
get seats in Harvard Yard. At least, that is what my
husband and I had to do to attend our daughter's
graduation from Harvard Medical School. Her
husband wasn't even able to attend.
And since the Stanford-of-the-East also has as
tute students, it was possible to purchase extra
tickets on eßay. Get ready!

Seniors should channel unity into issues larger
than the Commencement venue
The Daily reported on TUesday that, as of press
time, 1,350 Stanford undergraduates had signed a
petition regarding the location of this year's grad
uation ceremony ("Frost commencement propos
al raises protest," Oct. 25). Even if some of the
signers aren't seniors, this is still probably the most
unified action of the senior class since we began
our undergraduate careers here.
As someone who has spent her college career
advocating for international children's health,
though, I wonder why it is so easy to have the sen
ior class take action on behalf of the location of our
Commencement ceremony but so difficult to get
Stanford undergraduates to unite behind a much

more pressing and disastrous situation such as
global health. Nearly 12 million children die each
year, mainly of preventable diseases in the devel
oping world, but getting an undergraduate to sign
a petition regarding this cause is like pulling teeth.
Why are we less united in protecting the wel
fare of others who have no voice? Why have we
not joined together in effecting change for larger
causes, causes that go beyond ourselves and our
families — demanding, for instance, that the Unit
ed States' 44 million uninsured Americans have
access to health care, or that people living with dis
abilities have safe and accessible housing?
I do not have strong feelings about the location
of our Commencement ceremony, but I think that
it is a good sign that those people who are unhap
py with the recent announcement are willing to
take action.The question is: Can we as a class be as
vocal about other issues — issues that may count
for much more, even if they touch us less directly?

Students must understand that
file-sharing is illegal
In an Oct. 19 letter to the editor, Sean Arenson
wrote, "I highly doubt that [Yahoo! Music Unlim
ited Service] will represent a viable alternative to
the illegal downloading that our generation finds
so natural." As the person tasked with informing
Stanford network users when they have been
named in lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in
statutory damages for unlawful file-sharing, I'd
like to respond.
Illegal downloading is just that — illegal —
and there can be consequences. Two lawsuits have
been filed against Stanford network users for

downloading songs. When 1 tell students they may
he sued, the questions include how to notify par
ents, and how much it will cost to hire an attorney
and pay a settlement.
Even if they are not sued, Stanford network
users face the possibility of consequences under
Stanford's policies, which require students to re
spect copyright law. The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act gives copyright owners a very sim
ple way of lodging an unlawful file-sharing com
plaint with Stanford. Upon receipt of a third
DMCA complaint against a student, Stanford ter
minates Internet services. Stanford network users
need to find an alternate Internet Service
Provider to conduct any non-Stanford related
business, such as banking, blogging or finding the
best airline fare for Thanksgiving break. Three
copyright complaints also result in a referral to Ju
dicial Affairs, which could result in discipline up to
suspension.
When file-sharing first became hugely popular,
there were few robust, viable, legal alternatives,
and perhaps the lack of such options initially fos
tered a climate among Internet users of tolerance
for theft. Times and attitudes have changed. Now
that legal options proliferate, forward-thinking In
ternet organizations such as the Electronic Fron
tier Foundation and Creative Commons are now
speaking out against illegal file-sharing. Creative
Commons noted the larger interests at risk: "The
infringement of copyright is not just illegal, it has
also threatened the future of the free Internet as
regulators are driven to respond."
While Yahoo! Music Unlimited Service may
not be the right choice for Arenson, acting unlaw
fully is not an acceptable alternative.

Harvard only provides two tickets per graduate
I'm not Larry Summers, the president of Har
vard, but 1 can respond to Katie Miller's question
— posed in a letter to the editor on Oct. 25 —
about what Harvard would do if faced with not
having a football stadium for Commencement.
Harvard would (and does) give you not unlimited
tickets, not seven tickets, not four tickets, but two
tickets to its commencement. And your chosen
family members have to arrive at 6 a.m. in order to
get seats in Harvard Yard. At least, that is what my
husband and I had to do to attend our daughter's
graduation from Harvard Medical School. Her
husband wasn't even able to attend.
And since the Stanford-of-the-East also has as
tute students, it was possible to purchase extra
tickets on eßay. Get ready!

Seniors should channel unity into issues larger
than the Commencement venue
The Daily reported on TUesday that, as of press
time, 1,350 Stanford undergraduates had signed a
petition regarding the location of this year's grad
uation ceremony ("Frost commencement propos
al raises protest," Oct. 25). Even if some of the
signers aren't seniors, this is still probably the most
unified action of the senior class since we began
our undergraduate careers here.
As someone who has spent her college career
advocating for international children's health,
though, I wonder why it is so easy to have the sen
ior class take action on behalf of the location of our
Commencement ceremony but so difficult to get
Stanford undergraduates to unite behind a much

more pressing and disastrous situation such as
global health. Nearly 12 million children die each
year, mainly of preventable diseases in the devel
oping world, but getting an undergraduate to sign
a petition regarding this cause is like pulling teeth.
Why are we less united in protecting the wel
fare of others who have no voice? Why have we
not joined together in effecting change for larger
causes, causes that go beyond ourselves and our
families — demanding, for instance, that the Unit
ed States' 44 million uninsured Americans have
access to health care, or that people living with dis
abilities have safe and accessible housing?
I do not have strong feelings about the location
of our Commencement ceremony, but I think that
it is a good sign that those people who are unhap
py with the recent announcement are willing to
take action.The question is: Can we as a class be as
vocal about other issues — issues that may count
for much more, even if they touch us less directly?

Students must understand that
file-sharing is illegal
In an Oct. 19 letter to the editor, Sean Arenson
wrote, "I highly doubt that [Yahoo! Music Unlim
ited Service] will represent a viable alternative to
the illegal downloading that our generation finds
so natural." As the person tasked with informing
Stanford network users when they have been
named in lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in
statutory damages for unlawful file-sharing, I'd
like to respond.
Illegal downloading is just that — illegal —
and there can be consequences. Two lawsuits have
been filed against Stanford network users for

downloading songs. When 1 tell students they may
he sued, the questions include how to notify par
ents, and how much it will cost to hire an attorney
and pay a settlement.
Even if they are not sued, Stanford network
users face the possibility of consequences under
Stanford's policies, which require students to re
spect copyright law. The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act gives copyright owners a very sim
ple way of lodging an unlawful file-sharing com
plaint with Stanford. Upon receipt of a third
DMCA complaint against a student, Stanford ter
minates Internet services. Stanford network users
need to find an alternate Internet Service
Provider to conduct any non-Stanford related
business, such as banking, blogging or finding the
best airline fare for Thanksgiving break. Three
copyright complaints also result in a referral to Ju
dicial Affairs, which could result in discipline up to
suspension.
