## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Card cope with star's injury Women take on lackluster Oregon squad at Maples Pavilion 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The diagnosis has been confirmed and the shock is
beginning to wear off. After an intensely emotional
week, the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team plans
to take the court this weekend without freshman Cyn
thia Barboza in the lineup for the first time this season.
The Cardinal (17-3, 6-2 Pacific-10 Conference) are
scheduled to face Oregon (11-9,1-8) tonight with Bar
boza on the sideline awaiting surgery on the anterior
cruciate ligament in her left knee, which she tore last
week in Stanford's victory over California. The injury
should keep her off the court for six to eight months, but
head coach John Dunning said that the outside hitter
has come to terms with the premature end of her season.
"Initially, like anyone else,she was shocked,sad.cried
a lot," Dunning said. "Her mom told me th»< when she
was at the bottom of a staircase on Sunday and couldn't
get up to the top. that's when she might have hit bottom."
With surgery scheduled for the end of next week.
Barboza is anxious to begin the healing process and re
turn to the team. For now. she is doing "pre-hab" with
her doctors and physical therapists to keep her strong
and help her prepare fora successful surgery.
"She is going to really apply herself to it," Dunning
said "! don't have any doubt about that. She'll be a great
patient."
Although it is hard for any athlete to be kept away
from the sport she loves, Barboza is determined and in
good spirits; she attended Monday's practice to cheer on
her teammates between sessions with doctors and phys
ical therapists.
Recovery can be a trying process,but Dunning is con
fident that Barboza will be as successful as another Stan
ford athlete recovering from a similar injury: senior bas
ketball player Dan Cirunfeld. who suffered a season
ending ACL tear last year.
"What a great example he is of how fast you can re
cover," he said. " Ihe word I have is that he played as
good or better than he's ever played this past weekend
in a scrimmage, and he's eight months out. Cynthia has
even more time than that."
That is not to say that the grueling rehabilitation will
be easy.
"Day to day, it's easy to get overwhelmed," Dunning
said.'T don't think she will — that's not her style. But it
can get you down. It's plateau world in rehab. You see
improvement and then fora long time you don't, and
you get discouraged but then you jump up. It just isn't a
steady climb."
While Barboza faces the challenges of recovery, the
rest of the team must begin to adjust to her absence. Ihe
rookie had played in every match of this season, rarely
sitting out for more than a few points in any of them. At
the midway point of the conference season, she was the
Pac-10 leader in kills with 297 and second on the team
with a hitting percentage of .306. She has also con
tributed 174 digs, 26 blocks and II aces. Her all-around
play will be hard to replace, and the team must also deal
with the emotional impact of the injury.
"She's a friend that's been hurt seriously," Dunning
said. "They are worried about her, and they are worried

"You find a way and you just keep fighting
and fighting and fighting and fighting."
