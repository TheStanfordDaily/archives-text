# CREW
## Cardinal boats hit water for autumn races 
### EMILY CRAMER 
Following a year of international com
petition and landmark accomplishment,
Stanford crew is poised to continue to as
sert itself as a force to he reckoned with on
the water. The Stanford men's, women's
and lightweight crew teams get their first
opportunity this Saturday at Rancho Cor

dova for the Head of the American.
Women's head coach Aimee Baker,
beginning her 11th year on the Farm, has
plans to continue the program's success.
ITiey include aiming to secure invitations
for two eights and a four to NCAA Cham
pionships this year, a step up from last
year's single eight invitation. That boat
came in 11th place in the nation.

Baker cites "through the-roof motiva
tion and attitude" as a goal and strength of
this year's team. Co-captains Sam McGee,
2004 Olympic silver-medalist and 2(X)5
All-American, and Susan Beville, who has
many NCAA national and junior national
appearances, plan to be prominent team
leaders and contributors.
"Both bring great leadership on and

off the water," Baker said.
The fall season should be a positive
start for the team, setting the tone fora
breakout spring. The Stanford women
kick off their season with fall "head" races,
usually consisting of roughly 5,000-meter
courses — significantly longer than the
spring 2,(XX)-meter courses. The boats
start on intervals and are timed to ensure
accuracy.
"That's the fun thing about these [fall]
races — everyone goes into them without
preconceived notions about who's going
to be fast," Beville said. "All we know is
how people did last year, and this year's a
whole new year."
Seven rowers return from last year's
varsity eight, loading the boat with experi
ence. In addition, there are seven fresh
men recruits, who, according to Baker and
Beville, look very strong.
With a stellar team of recruits and re
turning rowers, the Cardinal should be
turning some heads this year. In a confer
ence full of nationally competitive pro
grams, they look to stand out.
Stanford women's regional competi
tion made an overall impressive showing
at NCAA Championships in 2005. South
ern California, UCLA, California, Wash
ington and Stanford have made Pacific-10
Conference women's rowing some of the
best in the nation.

year's NCAA Championships; 2005
