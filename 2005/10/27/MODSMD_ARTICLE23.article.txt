## Cardinal boats hit water for autumn races 
### EMILY CRAMER 
Following a year of international com
petition and landmark accomplishment,
Stanford crew is poised to continue to as
sert itself as a force to he reckoned with on
the water. The Stanford men's, women's
and lightweight crew teams get their first
opportunity this Saturday at Rancho Cor

dova for the Head of the American.
Women's head coach Aimee Baker,
beginning her 11th year on the Farm, has
plans to continue the program's success.
ITiey include aiming to secure invitations
for two eights and a four to NCAA Cham
pionships this year, a step up from last
year's single eight invitation. That boat
came in 11th place in the nation.

Baker cites "through the-roof motiva
tion and attitude" as a goal and strength of
this year's team. Co-captains Sam McGee,
2004 Olympic silver-medalist and 2(X)5
All-American, and Susan Beville, who has
many NCAA national and junior national
appearances, plan to be prominent team
leaders and contributors.
"Both bring great leadership on and

off the water," Baker said.
The fall season should be a positive
start for the team, setting the tone fora
breakout spring. The Stanford women
kick off their season with fall "head" races,
usually consisting of roughly 5,000-meter
courses — significantly longer than the
spring 2,(XX)-meter courses. The boats
start on intervals and are timed to ensure
accuracy.
"That's the fun thing about these [fall]
races — everyone goes into them without
preconceived notions about who's going
to be fast," Beville said. "All we know is
how people did last year, and this year's a
whole new year."
Seven rowers return from last year's
varsity eight, loading the boat with experi
ence. In addition, there are seven fresh
men recruits, who, according to Baker and
Beville, look very strong.
With a stellar team of recruits and re
turning rowers, the Cardinal should be
turning some heads this year. In a confer
ence full of nationally competitive pro
grams, they look to stand out.
Stanford women's regional competi
tion made an overall impressive showing

to make a strong start this year, hoping to

put together a solid fall foundation for the
more intense spring season.

face of impressive regional crews.
Cal's crew coach Dave O'Neil walked
away from last season with a National
Championship and a NCAA Coach of the

strong NCAA and Pac-10 showings.
UW rounds out the heavy-hitters in the
conference. Despite finishing 12th last year,
the strong tradition of competitive programs
makes the Huskies a possible threat.
The Stanford men's crew team returns
with the flush of success from its first Inter
collegiate Rowing Association National

Championship, won by the four plus boat in
June. Men's crew hopes to extend this suc
cess in the finals to their eight.
Four strong senior rowers — Jake Cor
nelius, Adam Kreek, Rob Meyer and John
Meier — return to finish their Stanford row
ing careers under head coach Craig
Amerkhanian.
Kreek is a veteran of the Canadian Na
tional team, where he helped win two world
championships and make a strong run fora
2(X)4 Olympic medal. Cornelius received an
invitation to U.S. National Team training
camp this summer.
Hie seniors, said Amerkhanian, should
lead the Cardinal as they improve on last
season's seventh place finish. He also em
phasized the strength of balance on his crew.
"Our team is strong and led by athletes
from all classes," Amerkhanian said. "[They]
will all define this season's successes and ac
complishments."
Regional competition includes strong
crews from Washington, Cal and Oregon
State, any of which Stanford could race
against this fall.
Like the women, the Stanford men look
to make a strong start this year, hoping to

put together a solid fall foundation for the
more intense spring season.
Washington finished fourth at last year's
IRA Championships, and the team starts
this fall fresh from a defeat at the hands of
New Zealand's Waikato University crew.
ITie Huskies' impressive recruiting classes
continue to make them a contender.
Cal is looking to maintain its reputation
as a West Coast power after finishing third
last year. Cal?s freshmen eight walked away
from last year's finale with a second consec
utive IRA National Championship and un
defeated season.
OSU was ninth in the nation last year.
Headed now by a second-year coach, the
Beavers aim to build a reputation for consis
tent top-five national finishes.
Stanford's best national finish in the eight
last year belonged to the lightweight
women. After achieving an all-time best
fifth-place finish at IRA. Stanford looks
ready to compete again with the lightweight
powerhouses from Wisconsin, Georgetown
and Princeton. Regionally, the lightweight
eight is looking to extend their streak to five
consecutive Pacific Coast Regional Cham
pionship titles.
Following a year of international com
petition and landmark accomplishment,
Stanford crew is poised to continue to as
sert itself as a force to he reckoned with on
the water. The Stanford men's, women's
and lightweight crew teams get their first
opportunity this Saturday at Rancho Cor

dova for the Head of the American.
Women's head coach Aimee Baker,
beginning her 11th year on the Farm, has
plans to continue the program's success.
ITiey include aiming to secure invitations
for two eights and a four to NCAA Cham
pionships this year, a step up from last
year's single eight invitation. That boat
came in 11th place in the nation.

Baker cites "through the-roof motiva
tion and attitude" as a goal and strength of
this year's team. Co-captains Sam McGee,
2004 Olympic silver-medalist and 2(X)5
All-American, and Susan Beville, who has
many NCAA national and junior national
appearances, plan to be prominent team
leaders and contributors.
"Both bring great leadership on and

off the water," Baker said.
The fall season should be a positive
start for the team, setting the tone fora
breakout spring. The Stanford women
kick off their season with fall "head" races,
usually consisting of roughly 5,000-meter
courses — significantly longer than the
spring 2,(XX)-meter courses. The boats
start on intervals and are timed to ensure
accuracy.
"That's the fun thing about these [fall]
races — everyone goes into them without
preconceived notions about who's going
to be fast," Beville said. "All we know is
how people did last year, and this year's a
whole new year."
Seven rowers return from last year's
varsity eight, loading the boat with experi
ence. In addition, there are seven fresh
men recruits, who, according to Baker and
Beville, look very strong.
With a stellar team of recruits and re
turning rowers, the Cardinal should be
turning some heads this year. In a confer
ence full of nationally competitive pro
grams, they look to stand out.
