# NBA's East looks competitive for first time in years
## 
### 
The NBA is coming back.
And I'm not just referring to the start of the NBA
season. The NBA is making a comeback as the pre
miere representation of basketball at its best.The ex
pansion of basketball to Miami, Vancouver (now
Memphis), Toronto, Minnesota, Orlando and Char
lotte diluted NBA talent in the 1990s and allowed
teams with just one or two stars to win championships.
Last year, we saw two deep NBA teams with solid
starters at each position win because of excellent team
play and fundamentals. For the first time in years, the
East has two or three championship caliber teams,
while the West boasts the defending champs.
But as opening day nears, many questions await us:
Who are the contending teams in the NBA? In the
Hast, it runs three deep with Miami, Detroit and Indi
ana all having an equal shot at making it to the Finals.
In the West, San Antonio is the clear favorite with no
other team in sniffing distance.
Wait, didn't Miami go a little crazy in the off-sea
son? Yes. Pat Riley did bring the crazy this off-season
by adding point guard Jason Williams and forwards
Antoine Walker and James Posey to his core of
Shaquille O' Neal and Dwayne Wade. But remem
ber, this team missed out on the Finals because Wade
and O' Neal were dinged up and no one stepped up
as a legitimate third option.
Won't they have chemistry problems? No. Shaq's
as scary as he is dominating. Plus, Williams was a

team player in
Memphis. Walker?
Well, Shaq's big
ger than him.
What about
Shaq's former
team? Will Phil
Jackson take the
Lakers to the play
offs? Last year's
problems weren't
solely caused by
poor coaching.
The Lakers are
struggling because
Kobe is incapable
of making his
teammates better,
and they have no
point guard and
frontcourt. Aaron

"Last year's

making his

McKie is the worst point guard in the Western Con
ference and their best forward is their 58-year-old
assistant coach Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. You heard it
here first: The Clippers are the best team in LA this
year.
Will we see Leßron in the playoffs this year? Yes.
Re-signing Zydrunas Ilgauskas and adding Larry
Hughes should get Leßron to the first round of the
playoffs and no more. Hughes and Big Z are best off
as third and fourth options on a good team. Leßron
needs a big guy of Tim Duncan caliber before you
can think championship in Cleveland. Plus, both
Hughes and Big Z could likely choke in the playoffs
and Leßron will want them out of town.
Which teams are underrated this year? Sacramen
to and Indiana. In Sacramento,Shareef Abdur Rahim
becomes the fourth option on a deep Kings squad. In
diana has a monster front line of Ron Artest, Jermaine
O'Neal and Jeff Foster. The Pacers also have stud
rookie Danny Granger and Lithuanian sharpshooter
Sarunas Jasikevicius manning the bench.
Which teams are overrated? Dallas comes to
mind. The lineup of Jason Terry, Doug Christie, Josh
Howard, Dirk Nowitzki and Erik Dampier doesn't
strike fear into anyone. The Mavs are a playoff team
but I wouldn't be surprised if they were a low seed.
Which teams will surprise? If Baron Davis is
healthy. Golden State should make the playoffs this
season. The Milwaukee core of T.J Ford, Micheal
Redd, Bobby Simmons, Jamal Magloire and Andrew
Bogut should sail smoothly in the East.
Who has the best guard-forward combo in the
league? A toughie. I'd rank them in the following way:
Manu Ginobli-Tim Duncan, Dwayne Wade-
Shaquille O'Neal. Steve Nash-Amare Stoudamire
andTVacy McGrady-Yao Ming.
I'm running out of column space, so let's get to the
awards and playoff predictions.
Who wins the MVP award? Tim Duncan — hands
down the best player in the NBA.
All NBA First Team? Duncan. O' Neal. Ron
Artest, Kevin Garnett, Leßron James, Steve Nash.
Rookie of the Year? Chris Paul of the Bobcats. Coach
of the Year? As much as I love Mike Montgomery. I'll
go with Rich Carslisle of Indiana.
Eastern playoff teams? In order from top to bot
tom: Miami, Indiana, Detroit, New Jersey, Chicago,
Cleveland, Milwakee, Washington. Western playoff
teams? Also in order: San Antonio, Denver, Sacra
mento, Phoenix, Houston, Dallas, Seattle, Golden
State.
Western Finals? San Antonio and Phoenix. East
ern Finals? Miami and Indiana.
NBA Finals? Miami and San Antonio. Winner?
San Antonio.
Speaking of San Antonio, how did Tony Parker get
the sizzling Eva Longoria? I guess anything can hap
pen in basketball.
Four more days. Get your TV ready.
