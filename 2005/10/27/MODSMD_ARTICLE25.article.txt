# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Women host Longhorns 
### 
The two swim teams that Richard
Quick transformed into national power
houses — Texas and Stanford — go
head-to-head this weekend at the Farm's
Avery Aquatic Center.
Quick, the legendary coach who re
tired his 17-year post at Stanford last sea
son, lead the No. 4 Cardinal to seven na
tional titles during his tenure, after
coaching the No. 7 Longhorns to five
consecutive NCAA Championships
from 1983-1988. Every season, Stanford
and Texas swimming meet up fora dual

competition, and this year's matchup
holds the perennial promise of high-level
competition.
The Longhorns topped Stanford last
season, 197-156, handing the Cardinal
their only dual meet loss of the year. The
teams met up again at the 2(X)4-2005
NCAA Championships, where the Cardi
nal narrowly edged the sixth-place Texas
squad.
The first race of the weekend is set for
1 p.m. tomorrow, while Saturday's action
kicks off at 9 a.m.
