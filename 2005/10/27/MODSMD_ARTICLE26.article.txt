## Sox capture Series title

HOUSTON (AP) â€”The Chicago
White Sox are World Series champions
again at last, and yet another epic streak
of futility is not just wiped away hut
swept away.
After seven scoreless innings, Jer
maine Dye singled home the only run in
the eighth, and the White Sox beat the
Houston Astros 1-0 Wednesday night to
win their first title in 88 years.
"It's unbelievable, unbelievable,"
catcher A.J. Pierzynski said.
It was the third title for the White
Sox, following wins in 1906 and 1917.
And it was the first since "Shoeless" Joe
Jackson and the "Black Sox" threw the
1919 Series against Cincinnati.
In the Windy City, where the Cubs
have long been king, Chicago's South
Side team for once trumped its North
Side rival, no small feat for the Sox.
Owner Jerry Reinsdorf once said
he'd trade all six of the Chicago Bulls'
NBA titles fora single Series ring. No
swap is needed now: He's got the prize
he dreamed of since he was a kid grow
ing up in Brooklyn.
"I hope this is not a dream," he said,
holding the trophy under his left arm
like a kid clutching his first baseball
glove.
White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen
said during the regular season that he
might retire if his team went on to win
the Series, and now he'll have to reveal
that decision. He hinted after the game

that he wanted a new contract.
"Now I'm going to make my money,"
he said playfully, looking at Reinsdorf.
Chicago's sweep, its eighth straight
postseason win and 16th in 17 games
overall, made it only the second team to
go through the postseason 11-1 since the
extra round of playoffs was added in
1995. But the White Sox fans didn't get
to enjoy a single celebration in person:
the division title and all three rounds of
the postseason were won on the road.
Houston, which finally won a pen
nant for the first time since it joined the
National League in 1962, became the
first team swept in its Series debut.
On a night when pitching dominated,
winner Freddy Garcia and Houston's
Brandon Backe pitched shutout ball for
seven innings, with Backe allowing four
hits and Garcia five. They each struck
out seven.
Brad Lidge. Houston's closer, came
in to start the eighth, and Chicago sent
up Willie Harris to bat for Garcia.
Harris lined a single to left leading off,
and that led to Houston's downfall. Scott
Podsednik bunted a difficult high pitch in
front of the plate, and the speedy Harris
took second on the sacrifice. Carl Everett
pinch hit forTadahito Iguchi and ground
ed to second, moving Harris to third.
Dye, the Series MVP. swung and
missed Lidge's next pitch, took a ball,
then grounded a single up the middle,
clapping his hands as he left the plate.
Harris trotted home from third, and
the White Sox celebrated in the third
base dugout.
