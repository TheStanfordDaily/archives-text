## Niners' Dorsey expected to step in for Smith 
### GREG BEACHAM AP SPORTS WRITER 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) —
Ken Dorsey was among the last play
ers off the San Francisco 49ers' prac
tice field Wednesday, a bag of foot
balls slung over his sweaty shoulder
following his usual post-practice
throwing session.
Even though Dorsey * probably
will start for the 49ers on Sunday in
place of injured rookie Alex Smith,
the recent third-string quarterback is
sticking to his routine of extra work
and additional preparation.
Smith, the No. 1 overall draft pick,
has two strained ligaments in his
right knee — and Tim Rattay, the
early season starter and recent back
up, will be on the opposite sideline as
a backup for the Tampa Bay Bucca
neers. who acquired him in a trade
last week.
That leaves the 49ers (1 -5) hoping
Dorsey's extra work prepared him to
face the Bucs' fearsome defense as
they try to end a five-game losing
streak.
"My position is that no matter

what happens, I'm going to go out
there and prepare and be ready to
go," Dorsey said. "I have a lot of faith
in this coaching staff, and they're
going to make the best decision."
Dorsey, an easygoing third-year
pro who won a national champi
onship at the University of Miami,
started seven games last season while
Rattay was injured. Dorsey spent
Wednesday's practice as the 49ers'
first-string quarterback, while Smith
watched from the sideline as San
Francisco installed its game plan.
"I was trying to be involved as
much as I could be, just in case I am
ready," Smith said. "I want to be men
tally ready. I certainly don't want to
just focus on the knee. I need to be
there working on the game plan so
that I can understand what's going to
happen on Sunday."
Though coach Mike Nolan won't
announce his starter until Thursday,
Dorsey seems all but certain to get
the job _ even if Nolan still doesn't
have complete confidence in any of
his young quarterbacks.
"All of our guys are young and in
experienced, and I've learned not to

get too comfortable with young, in
experienced quarterbacks as it is."
Nolan said. "(Dorsey) did a nice job
in practice today.... We'll know more
tomorrow about Alex's status, but it
does look more favorable right now
that Ken would be the guy."
Early last week. Dorsey was the
49ers' third-stringer with almost no
shot at playing this season. But San
Francisco traded Rattay fora low
round draft pick, and Smith got hurt
while getting tackled by Washing
ton's LaVar Arrington in last week
end's 52-17 loss to the Redskins.
Smith's knee stiffened after the
game, and though he improved
markedly during the 49ers' day off,
he wasn't ready to practice. Though
the No. 1 overall pick held out hope
of returning to practice Thursday,
he knows he might be better off
waiting a week to regain full mobil
ity.
"It's still a little swelled, a little
stiff," Smith said. "It's going to depend
on how I feel and how much I want to
do on it. From what I've learned in my
last two starts, I'm so excited because I
feel like I'm learning that much more."
