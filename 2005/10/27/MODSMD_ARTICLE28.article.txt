# Clinic Center opens at law school
## Students have new opportunities to work out in local community 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
In recent years the Stanford Law
School has been taking steps to de
velop opportunities for its students
to represent low-income clients con
cerning worker's rights, immigrants
with deportation cases and grass
roots environmental organizations.
Last week, the Law School
opened its new Clinic Center, which
also serves as the office of Larry
Marshall, the new associate dean for
public interest and clinical educa
tion.
Vice Dean of Stanford Law
School Mark Kelman noted that the
clinical experience not only gives stu
dents exposure to another side of
practicing law, but also allows them
to meet people they might not other
wise encounter who have different
skills and come from other disci
plines and schools.
These encounters provide law
students a chance to step outside the
classroom and get a glimpse of the
"real world," allowing them to focus
on areas of law they hope to later
pursue.
"We've improved the quality of
the clinics, and the students know
they will get a good experience," Kel
man said.
Previously, the clinics and offices
for the clinical professors were
spread throughout the Law School.
One of the first things Marshall did
when he arrived in February - was ad
vocate fora space solely dedicated to
clinical education.
"When I got here, it seemed pret
ty clear that the first thing we had to
do was to change the physical envi
ronment," he said. "The administra
tion was very responsive and what
we have now is just about the best
clinical space in the country."
Marshall previously worked at
the Northwestern School of Law in
Chicago where he directed the Cen
ter for Wrongful Convictions. At this
clinic he guided his students as they

investigated capitally-charged de
fendants in Illinois through the
19905. This clinic's work exonerated a
number of inmates on death row and
influenced then-Governor George
Ryan to commute the death sen
tences of all the inmates in the state
to life sentences. His work has also
caused many to reconsider the use of
capital punishment.
The new Clinic Center includes
large and small student-teaming
areas, reflecting the importance of
collaboration in these types of cases.
Also, there are student offices and
easily-accessible offices for profes
sors. The clinic provides technologi
cally-enhanced rooms for videotap
ing client interviews so students can
not only review previous deposi
tions, but also go over their interview
skills as well.
Prof. Jayashri Srikantiah of the
Immigration Clinic said that it is an
exciting time to be a clinical profes
sor at Stanford, especially with the
new space and the broader, more
supportive environment.
"The changes are very exciting
and signal a commitment and belief
that the clinical experience is an im
portant part of the education here,"
she said. "It is a vibrant and growing
time for the clinics."
While the Stanford Law School
has had legal clinics since the 19705,
recent changes and additions to the
program mark an increased dedica
tion to clinical experience. In recent
years, the school has opened a num

ber of new clinics — bringing the
total to nine — ranging from the
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic to
the Education Advocacy Clinic.
According to Law Prof. Peter
Reid, clinics last for one semester
each and generally enroll about 10
students, who generally take them
sometime between their third and
sixth semesters.
"There is a great deal of oversight
and supervision in the clinics," Reid
said. "There is also time for students
to step back and reflect on the prac
tice of law, which they won't have
later on in life."
Danielle Jones, a supervising at
torney at the Community Law Clin
ic, said the clinics are often the first
time that law students are able to get
their hands on a case and have direct
contact with clients.
"The students get an intense
hands-on experience and get to put
the theory they learn in the class
room into practice as they manage
case files and deal with clients," she
said. "This is fertile ground for
growth and practice for the stu
dents."
The Community Law Clinic has
students work in the East Palo Alto
community, giving them a taste of the
area around Stanford by providing
one-on-one legal assistance to low
income residents. Jones said one of
her students looked to gain useful in
sight on a case by going to a client's
home to see her housing conditions
firsthand.

Third-year law student Justin
Pidot is currently in his second legal
clinic of his Stanford education. Last
year he worked in the Community
Law Clinic.
"I found the experience of work
ing directly with actual clients and
seeing the real world impact that I
could achieve with my legal skills in
valuable " Pidot said.
Currently working in the Envi
ronmental Law Clinic, Pidot is devel
oping a case he will be arguing in the
Northern District of California, an
experience he said he would not oth
erwise have until he was several
years out of law school
Pamela Karlan, a professor at the
Supreme Court Litigation Clinic,
commented that students aren't the
only ones who benefit from such ex
periences.
"Clinical education equips stu
dents to provide pro bono represen
tation to underrepresented individu
als and groups once they graduate
from law school," Karlan said. "At
the same time, it provides legal rep
resentation to individuals and
groups who could not otherwise af
ford it."
Unlike their peers at other pro
fessional schools, such as medicine
and education, law students are not
required to complete a clinical rota
tion before receiving their degrees.
This results in many new lawyers
lacking experience dealing with ac
tual cases and clients first-hand.
"Legal education is renowned for
its disconnect to the actual practice
of law," Pidot said. "The clinical pro
gram that Stanford is developing
seems like it's going to do a lot to pro
vide this needed training. In addi
tion, it provides a fabulous opportu
nity for students to use their legal
skills in the public's service."
In the future, Marshall is looking
forward to expanding the clinical of
ferings; upcoming programs include
an international human rights clinic
and another in the area of transac
tional law for students who are not as
interested in going into litigation.
The new programs will bring the
total to 11 clinics, allowing the school
the capacity to accommodate every
student in the law school who wishes
to participate.
