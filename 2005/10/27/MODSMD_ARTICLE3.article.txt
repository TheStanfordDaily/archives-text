# Career Center bans master's students
## Students had represented themselves as undergrads 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Career Development Center
(CDC) banned a number of master's stu
dents last weekend from Cardinal Recruit

ing, the University's job application system,
after discovering that they had misrepre
sented themselves as undergraduates Stu
dents who have already been asked to inter
view for employers, including top tier man
agement consulting firms and investment
banks, were told they would no longer be
able to do so.
"We pulled them off the schedules, and
we've restricted them from the on-campus
Cardinal Recruiting program for the fall,"

said Lance Choy, the director of the CDC.
"They can still access job listings, and they
can still contact employers independently,
but in terms of interviews on campus,
they're restricted from that.They may inter
view somewhere else on campus, just not
through our system."
The punishment is a serious blow for the
affected master's students. Many premier
employers such as Goldman Sachs, an in
vestment bank, and McKinsey & Co., a

management consulting firm, use Cardinal
Recruiting as their primary recruitment ve
hicle at Stanford, and full-time recruitment
occurs almost exclusively during fall quar
ter. Many of the affected master's candi
dates are international students from coun
tries like India and China and face expulsion
from the U.S. if they can't secure a work visa.
Choy would not comment on the total
number of students involved, al
though students familiar with the
case, who preferred not to reveal
their identities for fear of further ac
tion by the CDC, estimated the num
ber to be between 30 and 50. Accord
ing to Choy, all had finished their un
dergraduate studies and were formal
ly enrolled in master's programs,
none were pursuing a co-terminal de
gree.
Some of the master's students
claim that they were acting within the
spirit of the law, if not the letter. They
say they did not alter their resumes or
transcripts but claimed undergradu
ate status in their Cardinal Recruiting
profiles in order to fit certain submis
sions requirements.
Sometimes this was done with the
explicit approval of the employers.
One master's student said he spoke to
a representative from a management
consulting firm about the submis
sions problem and was told to "do
whatever it takes to get into the sys
tem because if you're not in the sys
tem we can't interview you." A sec
ond company offered the student

similar advice.
Many employers willing to take
master's students unintentionally
limit resume submissions to under
graduates. Update e-mails from Car
dinal Recruiting routinely list correc
tions from firms like Lehman Broth
ers or Accenture to extend interview
opportunities to master's students as
well as undergraduates.
Still, some firms don't make the
change in time, so eager masters ap
plicants look for ways to work around
the system.
The misrepresentation was
brought to the attention of the CDC
last Friday by students who felt that
others were taking advantage of the
system.
"Some students informed us,"
Choy said. "They thought it was un
fair, what was going on.They felt they
had complied with the CDC policies,
and these other students had not and
were benefiting from that."
The masters student who spoke
with the consulting representatives
believes that the three dozen or so af
fected students were simply unlucky.
Many more, he believes, used thq>
same trick, but because they were ei
ther not accepted for interviews, or
because their interviews are not this
week, they escaped the CDC's atten
tion.
