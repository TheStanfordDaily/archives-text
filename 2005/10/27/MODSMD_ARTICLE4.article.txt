# SPECIAL EVENT
## Tibetan doctor connects East with West 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
The Stanford Friends of Tibet lecture series —
counting down until the arrival of His Holiness the
Dalai Lama — wrapped up last night with an event
on medical issues led by world-famous Tibetan doc
tor Tsondue Gyatso.
Gyatso, speaking as his son translated to an audi
ence of students, faculty and interested community
members, highlighted the differences between East
ern and Western medicines, but said he hoped fora
bridge between the two schools of thought to emerge
in the years to come.
According to Gyatso, China's occupation of Tibet,
beginning with its 1959 invasion, has put the preserva
tion of Tibetan medicine at risk. Only a dozen tradi
tional physicians managed to escape the province at
the time, and nine of them have since died.
Those who remained in Tibet met a similar fate, he
said. Many died prematurely, in some cases due to po
litical clashes with Chinese occupiers.
"When I think about these things, I feel very bad
and tears roll from my eyes," an emotional Gyatso
said.


TSONDUE GYATSO
Adamant that he was not a fa
mous doctor in Tibet, and insisting
that he would try to do it justice at
best, Gyatso admitted that he was
one of the few remaining experts in
Tibetan traditional medicine.
"So please bear with me because I
am all that you have got right now,"
he said.
Explaining the history of Tibetan
medicine while outlining a few of its
important tenets, Gyatso maintained
that it was important for Western and
Eastern medical experts to collabo
rate.
"I earnestly hope that what we
talk about will be able to help all of
you," he said. "And the people out
side and the whole world will gain

some insight on health and better liv
ing."
Gyatso explained that in his belief
system the human body is composed
of four elements. According to tradi
tion, disease exists in the equilibrium,
as does the medicine. The body is
composed largely of the "victim,"
consisting of seven constituents, and
the "victimizer," made up of three
humors. The elements are interde
pendent and when there is an imbal
ance between the two, one is consid
ered unhealthy.
The humors are the main factors
that determine the status of health in
the body, Gyatso said. The first
humor, or "lung." is essentially air
and controls the motor and sensory
muscles of the body. "Tripa," the sec
ond humor, is sharp and pungent,
generating and maintaining the body
and appetite. Finally, the third
humor, or "badken," is cool, smooth
and sticky, providing the body fluids

for lubrication and joint mobility.
An individual may belong to one
of the three types of humors, accord
ing to Gyatso. While one may be
dominated by one or the other, there
is always some combination of the
three.
"What we are as a normal healthy
person is mainly dominated by the
three humors," he said.
With the lecture series coming to a
close, senior Alissa Bernstein, presi
dent of the Stanford Friends of Tibet,
said she was pleased with the out
come.
"They went really well." she said.
"The first event was small but mo
mentum gained and the audiences
grew."
While she had hoped fora higher
turnout at the events, Bernstein still
called them a success.
"We had people from all over the
community," she said. "We're happy
to reach anyone."
