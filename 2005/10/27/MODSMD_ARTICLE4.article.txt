# SPECIAL EVENT
## Tibetan doctor connects East with West 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
The Stanford Friends of Tibet lecture series —
counting down until the arrival of His Holiness the
Dalai Lama — wrapped up last night with an event
on medical issues led by world-famous Tibetan doc
tor Tsondue Gyatso.
Gyatso, speaking as his son translated to an audi
ence of students, faculty and interested community
members, highlighted the differences between East
ern and Western medicines, but said he hoped fora
bridge between the two schools of thought to emerge
in the years to come.
According to Gyatso, China's occupation of Tibet,
beginning with its 1959 invasion, has put the preserva
tion of Tibetan medicine at risk. Only a dozen tradi
tional physicians managed to escape the province at
the time, and nine of them have since died.
Those who remained in Tibet met a similar fate, he
said. Many died prematurely, in some cases due to po
litical clashes with Chinese occupiers.
"When I think about these things, I feel very bad
and tears roll from my eyes," an emotional Gyatso
said.
