If the Stanford
Bookstore and the
Stanford Store just don't cut it
for you in terms of style, Chip
and Pepper Foster may
be the answer to
your prayers.

The twin designers, who
launched a successful denim cloth
ing line in 2003, are now turning
their sights on the ever-popular
vintage T-shirt, specifically those
sporting college logos. This No
vember, their company. Chip and
Pepper, will be introducing T
shirts with various university
names and mascots — including
Stanford — emblazoned across
the front.
These shirts will be sold in
high-end department stores and
boutiques such as Blooming
dale's, Nordstrom, Neiman Mar
cus, Barney's of New York and
Fred Segal in Los Angeles. The
new line will be called "C&P Uni
versity" and will include T-shirts
as well as fleece and track jackets.
For the twins, the line harkens
back to their youth, when they

started out in the clothing busi
ness. They would often go hunting
for vintage college T-shirts in thrift
stores to sell in their first bou
tique, Golf Punk, located on Mel
rose Avenue in Los Angeles.
"One of my first vintage T
shirts 1 ever bought was Stanford
University," said Chip Foster, co
founder of Chip and Pepper, in an
official press release. "These uni
versity T-shirts are a big part of
American culture."
The brothers saw the shirts (ly
ing off the shelves and came up
with the idea for an official cloth
ing line composed solely of col
lege fashion.This fall will mark the
first stage of the clothing line, with
15 colleges represented in the
line-up including New York Uni
