If the Stanford
Bookstore and the
Stanford Store just don't cut it
for you in terms of style, Chip
and Pepper Foster may
be the answer to
your prayers.

The twin designers, who
launched a successful denim cloth
ing line in 2003, are now turning
their sights on the ever-popular
vintage T-shirt, specifically those
sporting college logos. This No
vember, their company. Chip and
Pepper, will be introducing T
shirts with various university
names and mascots — including
Stanford — emblazoned across
the front.
These shirts will be sold in
high-end department stores and
boutiques such as Blooming
dale's, Nordstrom, Neiman Mar
cus, Barney's of New York and
Fred Segal in Los Angeles. The
new line will be called "C&P Uni
versity" and will include T-shirts
as well as fleece and track jackets.
For the twins, the line harkens
back to their youth, when they

started out in the clothing busi
ness. They would often go hunting
for vintage college T-shirts in thrift
stores to sell in their first bou
tique, Golf Punk, located on Mel
rose Avenue in Los Angeles.
"One of my first vintage T
shirts 1 ever bought was Stanford
University," said Chip Foster, co
founder of Chip and Pepper, in an
official press release. "These uni
versity T-shirts are a big part of
American culture."
The brothers saw the shirts (ly
ing off the shelves and came up
with the idea for an official cloth
ing line composed solely of col
lege fashion.This fall will mark the
first stage of the clothing line, with
15 colleges represented in the
line-up including New York Uni

Stanford is among the select few and the garments will be sold at the shopping center near campus.
versity, Duke University, University
of Arizona, University of Southern
California and Stanford University.
"We don't see these shirts as ap
pealing to just students or alumni of
the particular colleges," said Becky
Vieira, publicist of Chip and Pepper.
"There is also a great deal of home
town and regional pride when you
wear a college logo. For instance, I'm
wearing a Stanford sweatshirt right
now. even though 1 didn't go to Stan
ford because I grew up in Cuperti
no."
Vieira said the company is trying
hard to create grass-roots marketing
for this line. Chip and Pepper is plan
ning on marketing the clothing at
various football and basketball
games. In addition, the company's fall
2005 "look book" — a book with pic
tures of each product a clothing com
pany is offering fora season, which
can be sent to store sales representa
tives, stylists and the media — was
shot on the USCcampus, including in
a fraternity house.The models for the
clothing were also real college stu
dents, not professional models.

"I really feel like we can reach a
broader audience because of our
marketing and prices," Vieira said. "1
was in Japan lately, and they were
selling vintage American college T
shirts for $400 to $500. In contrast,
our apparel is much more afford
able."
The T-shirts will run for $55 to
$60. while the fleece and track jack
ets will cost $180 to $210.
According to Susan Weinstein, di
rector of business development for
Stanford, Chip and Pepper bought
the rights to the Stanford logo
through the Collegiate Licensing
Company, an independent agency
that represents Stanford, although
the clothing company had to submit
their product designs to Stanford for
approval.
"Stanford receives 8 percent of
the manufacturing profits in royal
ties of all apparel with the Universi
ty logo," she said. "Half of this money
goes into the Athletic Department,
while the other half goes toward stu
dent financial aid."
Weinstein also said this alternate
line of clothing will not hurt the
business of the Stanford Bookstore
or the Stanford Store, because the
two on-campus stores also sell li
censed merchandise and have the
option of carrying C&P University

if they wish.
Even though many of the stores
carrying this line are a short walk
away at the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, sophomore Jessica Johnson
doesn't think the Bookstore or the
Stanford Store have anything to
worry about in terms of competi
tion.
"I don't think these shirts are af
fordable for many people in college,
even at Stanford," she said. "1 think
the line is geared more toward high
school students, 1 know that in my
school the coolest thing was to have
sweatshirts with the name of Ivy
League universities on them. And
anyway, no one goes to the Stanford
Bookstore just for clothing. The rea
son why everyone likes it is because
it caters to the people on campus and
offers more than just college appar
el."
Johnson has bought clothing at
both the Stanford Bookstore and the
Stanford Store in the past, but the
cost of these products never exceed
ed $20.
Freshman Brodie Jenkins agreed
that the shirts were likely too expen
sive to suit the average college stu
dent.
"I don't think the Stanford design
on the shirt is much different than a
lot of logo shirts I've seen in the

Stanford Bookstore," she said. "The
only difference is a slightly looser de
sign and a vintage look, which
wouldn't inspire me to pay $30 more
for the shirt. It's not really my style. A
shirt needs to be pretty amazing in
both fit and design if I'm going to
spend more than $30 bucks on it.and
this just isn't cutting it."
However, Jenkins also said she
thought the shirts may find an audi
ence.
"1 think that if these new designs
are being sold in high-end stores like
this and being marketed as a new
popular trend, they will sell, partic
ularly because they're Chip and
Pepper, which is an extremely pop
ular upscale brand," she said. "I can
see them becoming very popular on
college campuses. It's an incredibly
smart business move — they're
making it stylish to sport the logos
of prestigious schools on clothing.
It's the preppy person's dream."
In the end, there may be one im
portant reason Stanford students
will choose to support this new line
— one noted California university is
missing on the list of colleges avail
able on the C&P University shirts.
"Our line-up isn't complete, but
we aren't planning on offering ap
parel with the UC-Berkeley logo just
yet," Vieira said.
