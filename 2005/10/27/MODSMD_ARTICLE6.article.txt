# ON CAMPUS
## Serial groper a threat no more, police report String of assaults began in spring of 2003 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The "serial groper" who assaulted a significant
number of female students by bicycle at night last
year is no longer on campus, according to the Stan
ford Police.
Though the last incident occurred in October of
last year, it was unclear whether the spree would ever
start up again. Reports of gropings began in May of
2003 and led to at least two dozen incidents since their
start. Described as a man between the ages of 19 and
30, the bicyclist would ride up to women from behind
and grab their backsides, riding away before victims
had a chance to see his face.
Known as "the serial groper," — frequently a
source of jokes among students — the perpetrator
caused some unrest on campus.
Senior Naree Chan recalls that she was working
on campus over the summer when the incidents first
started.
"At first, to a lot of people, it was this big joke — be
sure to go out with someone so you don't get attacked
by the groper," she said.
But as the incidents continued, the situation be
came more serious.
"I talked to a friend who was right nearby when an
incident happened, and she heard her friend scream,"
Chan said. "She was really affected by it. It seems very
traumatizing."
It was only a year ago that the Stanford Police
were able to identify suspects. No one was arrested
for the crime, however, according to Deputy Ken
Bates.
"We developed a case, did line ups and had a
sketch artist come in," Bates said. "But we couldn't
get anything definitive because of the way it hap
pened. When it happens, you may be listening to your
iPod or on your cell phone, and by the time you real
ize what happened and turn around, he's already sev
eral feet away."
Due to low visibility, none of the victims was able
to positively identify the groper.
Of the several suspects identified by police, one
admitted to the crime. On that basis, a case was pre
pared and sent to the Santa Clara district attorney's
office.
"The DA read the case and did not want to pursue
filing charges [without any convincing evidence],"
Bates said.
According to Bates, the man who admitted to the
crime was identified as an undocumented immigrant
working as a janitor fora contracting company and
thus not directly an employee of the University. He
was reassigned by his company to another location
and prohibited from being on Stanford's campus.
TTiough not all students know that the groper is
gone from campus, the dearth of incidents has al
lowed some of the tension to dissipate.
"When I first came to campus, I had a city mental
ity because I'm from Memphis," Chan said. "I would
never go out alone at night. But now I tell my mom
not to worry about me walking around late at night.
It's Stanford; it's fine."
At the same time, not all college campuses are
known to be as safe as Stanford's.
"When I hear about other schools, even other very
prestigious schools, that have shootings, I realize
Stanford is not like that" Chan said.
"[The groper incidents] were like a
glimpse of reality, a reminder that
these kinds of things do happen."
There are rumors that the groper
was eventually reported to the Immi
gration and Naturalization Services
and was deported, but Bates could
not confirm them.
"We were not involved in the
process,so we don't know what ended
up happening," he said. "We know
that he is no longer on campus."
Bates assured students that they
were safe from the groper but warned
the community "not to be lulled into a
false sense of security."
"Everyone should stay alert and
do what they can to avoid being a vic
tim," he said.
"I try to be very smart now," Chan
said."l won't be on the phone late at
night, and I try to be aware of the sit
uation. It's still a little eerie to see
someone behind you, even if it's just
another student. The groper inci
dents definitely left my senses
heightened."

Bates assured students that they
were safe from the groper but warned
the community "not to be lulled into a
false sense of security."
"Everyone should stay alert and
do what they can to avoid being a vic
tim," he said.
"I try to be very smart now," Chan
said."l won't be on the phone late at
night, and I try to be aware of the sit
uation. It's still a little eerie to see
someone behind you, even if it's just
another student. The groper inci
dents definitely left my senses
heightened."
The "serial groper" who assaulted a significant
number of female students by bicycle at night last
year is no longer on campus, according to the Stan
ford Police.
Though the last incident occurred in October of
last year, it was unclear whether the spree would ever
start up again. Reports of gropings began in May of
2003 and led to at least two dozen incidents since their
start. Described as a man between the ages of 19 and
30, the bicyclist would ride up to women from behind
and grab their backsides, riding away before victims
had a chance to see his face.
Known as "the serial groper," — frequently a
source of jokes among students — the perpetrator
caused some unrest on campus.
Senior Naree Chan recalls that she was working
on campus over the summer when the incidents first
started.
"At first, to a lot of people, it was this big joke — be
sure to go out with someone so you don't get attacked
by the groper," she said.
But as the incidents continued, the situation be
came more serious.
"I talked to a friend who was right nearby when an
incident happened, and she heard her friend scream,"
Chan said. "She was really affected by it. It seems very
traumatizing."
It was only a year ago that the Stanford Police
were able to identify suspects. No one was arrested
for the crime, however, according to Deputy Ken
Bates.
"We developed a case, did line ups and had a
sketch artist come in," Bates said. "But we couldn't
get anything definitive because of the way it hap
pened. When it happens, you may be listening to your
iPod or on your cell phone, and by the time you real
ize what happened and turn around, he's already sev
eral feet away."
Due to low visibility, none of the victims was able
to positively identify the groper.
Of the several suspects identified by police, one
admitted to the crime. On that basis, a case was pre
pared and sent to the Santa Clara district attorney's
office.
"The DA read the case and did not want to pursue
filing charges [without any convincing evidence],"
Bates said.
According to Bates, the man who admitted to the
crime was identified as an undocumented immigrant
working as a janitor fora contracting company and
thus not directly an employee of the University. He
was reassigned by his company to another location
and prohibited from being on Stanford's campus.
TTiough not all students know that the groper is
gone from campus, the dearth of incidents has al
lowed some of the tension to dissipate.
"When I first came to campus, I had a city mental
ity because I'm from Memphis," Chan said. "I would
never go out alone at night. But now I tell my mom
not to worry about me walking around late at night.
It's Stanford; it's fine."
At the same time, not all college campuses are
known to be as safe as Stanford's.
"When I hear about other schools, even other very
prestigious schools, that have shootings, I realize
Stanford is not like that" Chan said.
"[The groper incidents] were like a
glimpse of reality, a reminder that
these kinds of things do happen."
There are rumors that the groper
was eventually reported to the Immi
gration and Naturalization Services
and was deported, but Bates could
not confirm them.
"We were not involved in the
process,so we don't know what ended
up happening," he said. "We know
that he is no longer on campus."
Bates assured students that they
were safe from the groper but warned
the community "not to be lulled into a
false sense of security."
"Everyone should stay alert and
do what they can to avoid being a vic
tim," he said.
"I try to be very smart now," Chan
said."l won't be on the phone late at
