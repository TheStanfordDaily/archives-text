Electrical Engineering and Computer Sci
ence Prof. Mark Horowitz's presentation of
the soon-to-be released Graduate Education
Report was the highlight of the evening at
last night's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting. Scheduled on the agenda to last just
under half an hour, Horowitz's presentation

fielded questions about the report from sev

Horowitz presented on behalf of the
Commission on Graduate Education. The re
port, currently in its drafting stage, will be an
original document that focuses on optimizing
the graduate student experience as well as
improving the organizational structure of the
graduate program and fostering intellectual
innovation.
According to GSC Co-chair Thomas Lee,
a fourth-year electrical engineering graduate
student, the report was commissioned by
University President John Hennessy last
year.
"Graduate education has traditionally
been designed to prepare people to enter into
academic careers, but today if you look at
what people with Ph.D.s are doing, a lot are

choosing not to go into academia hut to enter
into other pursuits," Lee said."The Ph.D. pro
grams have not necessarily changed to adapt
to that. The report wanted to examine what
has made Stanford strong and what we need
to do to make sure that Stanford continues to
be strong in the future in terms of graduate
education."
Lee told The Daily that he expects the im
pact of the Graduate Education Report to be
similar to that of the nationally well-received
Commission on Undergraduate Education
report, released in 1994. The Commission's
findings of 11 years ago compelled Stanford
to develop programs that allowed under-
