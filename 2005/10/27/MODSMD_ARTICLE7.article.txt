## GSC previews Graduate Education report Report comparable to 94's undergraduate commission 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sci
ence Prof. Mark Horowitz's presentation of
the soon-to-be released Graduate Education
Report was the highlight of the evening at
last night's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting. Scheduled on the agenda to last just
under half an hour, Horowitz's presentation
evolved into an hour-long discussion as he
fielded questions about the report from sev
eral members of the Council.

Horowitz presented on behalf of the
Commission on Graduate Education. The re
port, currently in its drafting stage, will be an
original document that focuses on optimizing
the graduate student experience as well as
improving the organizational structure of the
graduate program and fostering intellectual
innovation.
According to GSC Co-chair Thomas Lee,
a fourth-year electrical engineering graduate
student, the report was commissioned by
University President John Hennessy last
year.
"Graduate education has traditionally
been designed to prepare people to enter into
academic careers, but today if you look at
what people with Ph.D.s are doing, a lot are

choosing not to go into academia hut to enter
into other pursuits," Lee said."The Ph.D. pro
grams have not necessarily changed to adapt
to that. The report wanted to examine what
has made Stanford strong and what we need
to do to make sure that Stanford continues to
be strong in the future in terms of graduate
education."
Lee told The Daily that he expects the im
pact of the Graduate Education Report to be
similar to that of the nationally well-received
Commission on Undergraduate Education
report, released in 1994. The Commission's
findings of 11 years ago compelled Stanford
to develop programs that allowed under-

grads to pursue original work, in

Sophomore College.
"The Graduate Education Re
port contains recommendations that
are going to guide the course of grad
uate education at Stanford for at
least the next decade, probably
longer than that," Lee said.
Lee added that he expected grad
uate students to respond positively
to the report.
"I think it will be well received,"
he said. "This is something that we
on the GSC have been eagerly antic
ipating since the Commission was

announced last year."
Lee added that the report's rec
ommendations will not be imple
mented overnight and that there is
still a lot of work that needs to be ac
complished.
"I really want to encourage grad
uate students to get involved," he
said. "They'll be able to shape not
only their own experience at Stan
ford but also the experience of fu
ture generations of graduate stu
dents."
Former GSC Co-chair Mariah
Thomason, a graduate student in
neuroscience at the Medical School,
is the only student on the commis
sion, which is mostly composed of
faculty and staff.
"Prof. Horowitz gave a good
overview of the goals of the Com
mission," she said. "It is important

that he was here tonight because the
GSC is dedicated to the same types
of issues as the Commission."
The GSC also welcomed fresh
man Cassidy Vuong who is interning
with a councilmember and helping
organize the upcoming Thanksgiv
ing Dinner. The GSC has four other
freshman interns.
"It was my first meeting," Vuong
said. "It was a little long, but I
learned a lot about the graduate stu
dents and that atmosphere."
In addition, the GSC approved
funding requests from the Black
Graduate Student Association, the
Health Care Advocacy Survey and
the Chinese Campus Evangelistic
Fellowship. The first two requests
passed with consensus while the
third passed with one "no" vote and
one abstention.
