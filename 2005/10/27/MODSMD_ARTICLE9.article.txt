BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — The American
death toll reached 2,001 yesterday with the an
nouncement that a soldier died in an accident
the Hiesday night. Three mostly Sunni Arab par
ties said they have formed a coalition to com
pete in upcoming parliamentary elections as the
minority moves to consolidate its power in the
political arena.
The soldier, whose identity was withheld pend
ing notification of relatives, died in a vehicle acci
dent TUesday evening near Camp Bucca, a U.S. de
tention center in southern Iraq, the military said.

The statement raised by one the number of U.S.
service members killed in the war a day after the
somber milestone of 2,000 was reached.
A roadside bomb also destroyed a Humvee in a
U.S. convoy yesterday, but no American casualties
were reported in that attack.
A U.S. warplane also struck a suspected insur
gent safe house near the Syrian border yesterday
and may have killed a senior al-Qaida in Iraq fig
ure identified only as Abu Dua who it said assisted
in smuggling Syrian and Saudi fighters into Iraq,
the U.S. military said.
A military statement said intelligence sources
indicated that Abu Dua — who allegedly was part
of an al-Qaida network along the Syrian border —

was in the house at the time of the attack but his
body has not been recovered. The statement also
accused him of kidnapping and executing people
after trying them in makeshift religious courts.
At least 10 Iraqis were killed in attacks and an
Internet statement claiming that the country's
most feared terror group has abducted two Mo
roccan embassy employees.
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday observed a mo
ment of silence in honor of the fallen Ameri
cans.
"We owe them a deep debt of gratitude for
their courage, for their valor, for their strength, for
their commitment to our country," said Republi
can Majority Leader Bill Frist.
