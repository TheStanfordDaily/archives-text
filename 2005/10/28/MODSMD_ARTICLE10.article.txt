### H. WELLS WULSIN STAFF WRITER 
"U.S.-France relations are back on track," Jean-
David L6vitte, ambassador of France to the United
States, said to a packed auditorium in the Lane Histo
ry Corner yesterday."! know that California is looking
toward Asia, but remember that good old Europe is
still there and in better shape than is printed in the U.S.
media from time to time."
In his speech, entitled "France and the United
States: Challenges and Opportunities," L£vitte
spoke broadly on the economic, political and cultur
al factors that shape the relationship between the
two countries and their place within the global com
munity.
career in foreign service includes posi
tions on the staff of two French presidents, Valery Gis-

card d'Estaing and
Jacques Chirac. He
holds a degree in
law and is a gradu
ate of the Institute
for Political Sci
ence in Paris and of
the National
School of Oriental
Languages, where
he studied Chinese
and Indonesian.
Levitte has
been ambassador
to the United
States since Febru
ary 2003, before
the start of the Iraq
War, but spoke
only briefly about
the tensions be
tween France and
the U.S. Before the
war, he negotiated
with the U.S. am
bassador to the
United Nations,
John Negroponte,
to allow the return
of weapons inspec
tors to Iraq.

there was no need

to rush the war," Levitte said."lt would have been bet
ter to wait for the inspector to complete their job But
this is history and the historians will decide what is
right and what is wrong."
Throughout his remarks, Levitte stressed the
bonds between the two nations, citing historical exam
ples such as France's alliance in the American War for
Independence, Napoleon's sale of the Louisiana Pur
chase and the American military's support provided
to France in the two world wars.
"Sixty million French are still full of gratitude," he
said. "The French will never forget."
Levitte referred repeatedly to the ties between the
American and French economies, noting that France
invests $150 billion in American businesses, the third
largest of any foreign investor, and the U.S. is the num
ber one investor in the French economy. Each day $1
billion of goods and services are exchanged between
the two countries.
He also affirmed France's solidarity with the Unit
ed States in the fight against terrorism. Levitte was
ambassador to the United Nations on Sept. 11,2001
and saw the World Trade Center towers in flames from
his office.
"It was obvious it was a turning point not only for
your country, but for the world," he said. The next day
he proposed that such an act of terrorism should be
considered an act of war and treated accordingly.
"The resolution was adopted unanimously in one
hour."
L<§vitte also spoke about the future of the Euro
pean Union, in light of France's rejection last May
of the referendum on the EU Constitution.
"If you ask through referendum a question to
the French, you will get five answers," he said. "But
it shows there is a lot of anxiety about the enlarge
ment of the EU. If TUrkey joins the EU,our neigh
bors to the EU will be Iran, Iraq and Syria. What
are we, what are our limits? Where are our bor
ders?"
Ldvitte pointed out some of the cultural differ
ences between France and the United States, par
ticularly with regard to religion. He noted that 40
percent of Americans attend a place of worship
each week, while fewer than 10 percent do in
France.
"Who is right and who is wrong?" he asked.
"Who cares? You have the right to worship as you
choose. We would never put on our currency, in
God we trust.' Because in France you have the right
not to trust in God. Not in America."
said he does not see such cultural differ
ences as an obstacle to a strong relationship be

tween the nations.
"We are great democracies, but we don't have to
live these democracies out in the same way," he said
"We should accept, like in all families, that from
time to time we strongly disagree on an important
international issue, and it should be respected."
He related an encounter with Secretary of State
Colin Powell in May 2(X)3 after U.S.-France rela
tions had become strained over the Iraq War.
"I said,'We have to do something. It's a disas
ter, where is our friendship? It's destroyed day
after day.' And Colin Powell, who is a wise man,
told me, 'Look, for over two hundred years, the
U.S. and France have been in marriage counseling.
But the marriage has been strong and it is still
strong.' And I do think that Colin Powell was
right," L£vitte said.
Yazid Aksas, a first-year student at the Gradu
ate School of Business and French national, agreed
that there is room for divergence between the two
nations.
"He picked out the most important thing, that
we have the right to disagree with each other," he
said. "That's something we learn in our business
school classes — you can't expect everyone to
agree all the time."
