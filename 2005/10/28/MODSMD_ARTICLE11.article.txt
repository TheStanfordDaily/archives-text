## Roble field, football practice stadium become new options 
### NICK PARKER SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
In response to intense student protest over the decision to
use Frost Amphitheater as the site for this year's Commence
ment ceremonies, University administrators announced
Wednesday that they would reconsider that decision.
In an open letter to graduating students and their parents.
University President John Hennessy explained that adminis
trators will now consider Roble Field and the football practice
field, located behind Maples Pavilion, in addition to Frost
Amphitheater as potential sites for this year's graduation fes
tivities.
On Sunday, University officials announced that they had
chosen the 9,(XX)-seat Frost — which has been the site of grad
uation ceremonies in the past — as the replacement site for
the 85,000-seat Stanford Stadium, which will be undergoing
major renovations at the time of Commencement.
Almost immediately, members of the class of 2006 began
to protest the decision,generating at least two online petitions
— one for faculty and students and another for parents. The
graduates' main concern was the limited seating capacity in
the amphitheater.
"Everyone that I know sent some form of letter acknowl
edging their dislike of the choice to use Frost Amphitheater
for Commencement," said senior Chioke Borgelt-Mose, for
mer ASSU President.
The administration responded swiftly to the rapid number

of complaints they received regarding the decision.
"Based on the feedback of those people who contacted us
in the last few days, the most important criterion fora Com
mencement site for many students is the ability to accommo
date the maximum number of guests ," Hennessy's letter stat
ed. "For that reason, we have decided to reconsider the deci
sion."
An e-mail was sent by the senior class presidents outlining
to their peers the new options for commencement location
and urged seniors to respond with their preferences.
Additionally, they discussed a system that is in the works
to help accommodate everyone's attendance needs.
"Regardless of the ultimate decision, the administration
has agreed to work with us to set up a ticket exchange system
so that students who have excess tickets can redistribute them
to students in need of additional tickets," stated the senior
class presidents in the e-mail.
Some students, such as senior Rosemary Ndubuizu, who
created one of the online petitions, said they were deeply
upset by the University's first decision.
"Honestly, I find the administration's decision to initially
disregard or greatly minimize the senior class' input on this
important issue as disrespectful and insulting," Ndubuizu said
in an e-mail to the Daily. "We, as students, are important
stakeholders in this institution and to be ignored or dismissed
during this decision-making process is appalling."
When Commencement was held in Stanford Stadium,
graduating students were encouraged to invite as many guests
as they wanted, but only four guests per graduate will be al
lowed if the ceremonies are held at Frost. In addition, under
graduate and graduate ceremonies would be held on differ-
