# Administration reconsiders Commencement site
## Roble field, football practice stadium become new options 
### NICK PARKER SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
In response to intense student protest over the decision to
use Frost Amphitheater as the site for this year's Commence
ment ceremonies, University administrators announced
Wednesday that they would reconsider that decision.
In an open letter to graduating students and their parents.
University President John Hennessy explained that adminis
trators will now consider Roble Field and the football practice
field, located behind Maples Pavilion, in addition to Frost
Amphitheater as potential sites for this year's graduation fes
tivities.
On Sunday, University officials announced that they had
chosen the 9,(XX)-seat Frost — which has been the site of grad
uation ceremonies in the past — as the replacement site for
the 85,000-seat Stanford Stadium, which will be undergoing
major renovations at the time of Commencement.
Almost immediately, members of the class of 2006 began
to protest the decision,generating at least two online petitions
— one for faculty and students and another for parents. The
graduates' main concern was the limited seating capacity in
the amphitheater.
"Everyone that I know sent some form of letter acknowl
edging their dislike of the choice to use Frost Amphitheater
for Commencement," said senior Chioke Borgelt-Mose, for
mer ASSU President.
The administration responded swiftly to the rapid number

of complaints they received regarding the decision.
"Based on the feedback of those people who contacted us
in the last few days, the most important criterion fora Com
mencement site for many students is the ability to accommo
date the maximum number of guests ," Hennessy's letter stat
ed. "For that reason, we have decided to reconsider the deci
sion."
An e-mail was sent by the senior class presidents outlining
to their peers the new options for commencement location
and urged seniors to respond with their preferences.
Additionally, they discussed a system that is in the works
to help accommodate everyone's attendance needs.
"Regardless of the ultimate decision, the administration
has agreed to work with us to set up a ticket exchange system
so that students who have excess tickets can redistribute them
to students in need of additional tickets," stated the senior
class presidents in the e-mail.
Some students, such as senior Rosemary Ndubuizu, who
created one of the online petitions, said they were deeply
upset by the University's first decision.
"Honestly, I find the administration's decision to initially
disregard or greatly minimize the senior class' input on this
important issue as disrespectful and insulting," Ndubuizu said
in an e-mail to the Daily. "We, as students, are important
stakeholders in this institution and to be ignored or dismissed
during this decision-making process is appalling."
When Commencement was held in Stanford Stadium,
graduating students were encouraged to invite as many guests
as they wanted, but only four guests per graduate will be al
lowed if the ceremonies are held at Frost. In addition, under
graduate and graduate ceremonies would be held on differ-

ent days with different speakers.
"I was very shocked to hear that each one of
us could only bring four guests," said senior Jen
nifer Lee. "I know many seniors had wanted to
invite friends as well as family, which is almost im
possible to do with only four tickets. For myself,
as well as others, four tickets is not even enough
for my immediate family to attend together,
which made me very disappointed."
There would also be restrictions placed on the
number of guests at the other two locations the
administration is now considering. If the cere
monies are held at Roble Field, graduates could
invite seven guests, while they could bring nine
guests to the football practice field.
"I am pleased that these administrators are
now taking the time to listen to our suggestions
even though it is within a narrow set of options,"
Ndubuizu said. "However, it is my hope that the
administrators do not commit the same mistake
they have done in the past and listen to our rec
ommendations only to dismiss them and impose
their own opinion without reasonable justifica
tion [e.g. cost effectiveness]."
"Ideally, I would support a site that holds the
traditional number of 50 guests, so that Stanford
demonstrates even with changes in Commence
ment venue, it financially supports this event to
the point where precedent is not frivolously
trumped," she added.
However, Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to
Hennessy, stated that price was not the primary
issue in the administration's initial choice of
holding Commencement at Frost Amphitheater.
"Cost is a secondary factor and continues to
be one but did not drive the initial decision nor
does it drive the decision now," Wachtel said."We
spend several hundred thousand dollars on
Commencement each year, but that doesn't take
into account staff time, overhead costs, etc.
Again, cost is not influencing our decision."
At both Roble Field and the football practice
field, the ceremony would be held on a raised
stage and seating would be in the form of folding
chairs. In addition, two Jumbotron-style screens
would be set up to enhance viewing. In both
cases, alternate indoor seating would be available
at a nearby location where the ceremonies would
be telecast.
"I think it's a good idea, either to accommo
date the guests who don't have tickets into the ac
tual location or for those who prefer indoor and
cooler seating, such as the elderly and young chil
dren," Lee said.
Most students said they would like Com
mencement at the football practice field because
it provides the most space.
"I'm in support of the football practice stadi
um because it accommodates the largest atten
dance for the graduating class," Borgelt-Mose
said.
Ndubuizu agreed.
"My choice would be the football field be
cause it holds the
highest number of guests and most closely re
sembles Stanford's traditional
location," she said.
A major concern for University officials is the
amount of nearby parking available for ceremo
ny attendees. Traditionally, when graduation was
held at Stanford Stadium, guests were able to
park in the stadium parking lots; however, while
the stadium lots could be used for the Frost Am
phitheater and football practice field sites, the
Roble Field site has limited parking nearby and
would thus require a walk of up to one-half mile
for many guests.
"No matter what the final decision is, there
will always be some people who are unhappy
with it," Lee said. "However, I think it's great that
the University is working with the senior class to
consider other possible solutions for the Com
mencement venue in an attempt to make gradu
ation run smoothly this year. 1 also think it is im
portant to remember that there are issues the ad
ministration might have to take into considera
tion that we are not aware of, and we should try
to keep open minds."
Borgelt-Mose also emphasized the impor
tance of cooperation between the administration
and the student body.
"It's a great example of how we can effect
change even on a small level and why student
input is needed early on," Borgelt-Mose said.
"The administration was able to recognize the is
sues the students had and address them."
