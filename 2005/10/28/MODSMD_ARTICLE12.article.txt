## Faculty Senate reviews Univ. Int'l Initiative 
### LI TAO STAFF WRITER 
Standing Committee Co-chairs Chip Blacker, di
rector of the Freeman Spogli Institute of Interna
tional Studies, and Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, a senior
fellow at the Institute, unveiled details for the new
University-wide International Initiative at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting yesterday afternoon.
The Initiative is designed to respond to the chal
lenges of pursuing peace in an insecure world, re
forming and improving governance at all levels and
advancing human health and wellbeing, Pate-Cor
nell said. It is intended to encourage a systematic, in
terdisciplinary, international approach to these chal
lenges.
An example case in which such an interdiscipli
nary approach would be useful is an early warning
system for natural disasters, epidemics and home
land security. Blacker noted that in addition to ana
lyzing and interpreting signals, it is important to be
able to "organize an effective response, which re
quires knowledge of sociological, legal, political and
organizational cultural concerns."
Other examples Blacker cited were the successful
establishment of stable institutions in developing
countries and the analysis of cultural and social as
pects of developed and developing societies.
Among the programs to be created by the Initia
tive are the President's Fund for Innovation in Inter
national Studies, a research grant for Stanford facul
ty involved in international studies, and the Distin
guished Visitors and Scholars Program designed to
allow international scholars to spend time at Stan-
ford.
For students, the International In
ternship program will be expanded,
providing more funding for under
graduate students pursuing intern
ships abroad. Funds will also go to
ward expanding the number of grad

uate students in interdisciplinary and
international studies and could pos
sibly work toward need-blind admis
sions policy for undergraduate inter
national students.
Encina Hall, currently used to
house a variety of offices, will be re
stored and refurbished into a center
for these and other international
programs. Meanwhile, Crothers and
Crothers Memorial Halls may possi
bly be converted into international
themed dorms.

The initiative was designed to 1
"jumpstart collaborative studies" led ]
by faculty members and increase j
Stanford's involvement in the world I
community. This goal is already <
being independently achieved by i
Stanford faculty. Blacker said.
Also at the Faculty Senate meet- ;
ing, the governing body approved a i
motion to revive the master's degree ]
program for the Interdisciplinary <
Program in Latin American Studies, ;
which was suspended in June 2001. i

Director Herbert Klein said that the
program was designed to give recent
graduates a "broad perspective on
the region" before going on to spe
cialize in fields such as sociology,
economics or anthropology.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Standards and Policy also dis
cussed possible minor changes to im
prove the quality of undergraduate
education, such as providing online
access to class syllabi to aid students
in selecting courses.
