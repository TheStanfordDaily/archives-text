## Dance Marathon gets into groove for fundraiser 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
Have you hiked through White Plaza this week
past students dancing to music ranging from the
Black Eyed Peas to the Jackson 5? Were you wonder
ing why they were holding signs that read, "Dance for
the Cure" and "Fight AIDS?"
The group you may have seen — or heard — is
Dance Marathon, a student group on campus created
last year to raise money for the Elizabeth Glaser Pe
diatric AIDS foundation. Co-founded by junior
Amanda Brophy and sophomore Cailean Cooke,
Dance Marathon focuses on raising both awareness
and funds in support of HIV and AIDS relief efforts.
What distinguishes Dance Marathon from many
other fundraising groups is the fact that it throws one
of the biggest parties of the year.
According to Brophy, "The primary goals include
three main ideas. The first is to spread education and
awareness about HIV and AIDS, the second is to
raise more money than last year through tons and
tons of fundraising and the last goal is to host the
party of the year."
Preparations for Dance Marathon have already
begun. The main focus now is recruiting dance mem
bers for the event in February.The sign up deadline to
dance is mid-November, at which point there is a shift
in focus. Every member, including committee execu-
tives and dance members, begin efforts to raise
$200 each before the final dance party.
During the 24 hour party. 300 dancers and 100
committee members dance to live bands and per
forming groups. In addition. Dance Marathon
hosts several health professionals to speak about
the HIV and the AIDS pandemic.
Last year, after the togas, the glow sticks and
the karaoke hour, the group counted the raised
funds, a total of $50,000 — well over their expec
tations.
"Last year was Stanford's first time to host a
Dance Marathon and we raised over $50,000,
making it one of the most successful first-year
events," Cooke said. "The money we raise is fora
worthy cause — the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation.This organization has reached
1.4 million women in 20 countries by supplying
voluntary HIV testing and counseling and pro
viding life-saving drugs to infected pregnant
women that greatly reduces the risk of mother
child transmission."
According to Cooke, universities around the
country — including Northwestern and Universi
ty of Pennsylvania — throw annual Dance
Marathon parties to raise money for various phil
anthropic organizations.
"Sanjay Shah can be credited with bringing the
idea to Stanford," Cooke added. "He'd gone to
UCLA's Dance Marathon in 2004 and was in
spired to start it up here. Amanda and I were se
lected as co-chairs last spring. I was the operations
exec last year and Amanda was on the Entertain
ment committee."
While Dance Marathon's opening year cul
minated in a great success, committee members

are looking to expand its outreach and
fundraising.
"This year, we want to make Dance Marathon
THE event." Brophy said. "It will be held Feb. 18
to Feb. 19 from noon to noon. We want more
dancers to dance, more money to be raised and
more education and awareness spread. We want
to get everyone involved — students, faculty and
the community."
Sophomore Abel Allison, Dance Marathon's
entertainment executive agreed.
"1 think Dance Marathon brought a strong
presence and a drive for success," he said. "We are
organized and willing to do what it takes to make
a huge difference. The event was also huge in
helping spread awareness about such a world
wide problem. This year and in the future, we
hope to keep making it bigger and better. We have
set higher goals. Last year, we raised around
$50,000. This was a highly successful opening
year, but there are Dance Marathons around the
country that make hundreds of thousands. We
hope to achieve that some day."
Dance Marathon will be dancing in White
Plaza with signs one final day today. Members are
excited about the upcoming year and feel that
their new presence at brings positive results to the
Stanford community.
"It is a very unique event that brings togeth
er a great mix of people who all care about a
common issue," Cooke said. "Unlike most col
lege parties that leave you with a hangover and
sometimes regrets about the night before,
Dance Marathon is a party that promises to
leave you feeling fulfilled and satisfied. No walk
of shame here."
