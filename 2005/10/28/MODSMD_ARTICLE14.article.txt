Prejean's challenge to the audience was one of many
during a thought-provoking presentation about capital
punishment that packed the seats in Kresge Auditorium
last night.
Organized by the Aurora Forum and moderated by
Human Biology Prof. William Abrams, the discussion
sought to increase awareness and provoke discussion
about the use of capital punishment in the United States.
Drawing upon personal stories, moral reasoning and
empirical evidence, Stanford Law School Prof. Larry
Marshall and activist Prejean spoke with conviction
about the flaws of the capital punishment system and put
forward their case for abolishing the death penalty.
Religious faith provided a background for the com
mentary of both speakers. The Catholic Prejean shared
how she became involved in the plight of the poor after
reading how "Jesus was always on the side of the people

considered human waste in his day."
She also discussed her dissatisfaction with selective
quotation of punitive passages in the Bible by conserva
tives like Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
"If you look at the progression in the Bible," she said,
"more and more the direction is not to impose
vengeance. Love becomes the dominant theme."
Marshall, who identifies strongly with his Jewish back
ground, recalled how a prayer he heard on Yom Kippur
in 199() galvanized him to get involved in a death penalty
case.
"You can change the decree because you pray and
throw yourself into the work." he said. "1 had to take the
case or else 1 would have to call myself a fraud."
Personal stories such as these played a large role in the
presentations of the two speakers. Marshall discussed his
work with the Center on Wrongful Convictions at' Nort
hwestern Law School, and Prejean recounted several sto
ries from her books "Dead Man Walking" and"The
Death of Innocents" about her experiences accompany
ing death row inmates to their executions.
"What I hope people hear are the intensely personal
experiences of the speakers," said moderator Abrams in
an interview with The Daily. "I have two death penalty
cases, and I cannot articulate the profound emotional ex
perience it has on you."
