asked Sister Helen Prejean to a transfixed crowd. "If

part of our soul that has not said yes to the death penal

Prejean's challenge to the audience was one of many
during a thought-provoking presentation about capital
punishment that packed the seats in Kresge Auditorium
last night.
Organized by the Aurora Forum and moderated by
Human Biology Prof. William Abrams, the discussion
sought to increase awareness and provoke discussion
about the use of capital punishment in the United States.
Drawing upon personal stories, moral reasoning and
empirical evidence, Stanford Law School Prof. Larry
Marshall and activist Prejean spoke with conviction
about the flaws of the capital punishment system and put
forward their case for abolishing the death penalty.
Religious faith provided a background for the com
mentary of both speakers. The Catholic Prejean shared
how she became involved in the plight of the poor after
reading how "Jesus was always on the side of the people

considered human waste in his day."
She also discussed her dissatisfaction with selective
quotation of punitive passages in the Bible by conserva
tives like Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
"If you look at the progression in the Bible," she said,
"more and more the direction is not to impose
vengeance. Love becomes the dominant theme."
Marshall, who identifies strongly with his Jewish back
ground, recalled how a prayer he heard on Yom Kippur
in 199() galvanized him to get involved in a death penalty
case.
"You can change the decree because you pray and
throw yourself into the work." he said. "1 had to take the
case or else 1 would have to call myself a fraud."
Personal stories such as these played a large role in the
presentations of the two speakers. Marshall discussed his
work with the Center on Wrongful Convictions at' Nort
hwestern Law School, and Prejean recounted several sto
ries from her books "Dead Man Walking" and"The
Death of Innocents" about her experiences accompany
ing death row inmates to their executions.
"What I hope people hear are the intensely personal
experiences of the speakers," said moderator Abrams in
an interview with The Daily. "I have two death penalty
cases, and I cannot articulate the profound emotional ex
perience it has on you."

the audience captivated for the
length of the presentation.
"They did an excellent job com
bining the emotive, personal and
statistical parts of the issue," said
freshman Erik Goldman, who at
tended the event as part of a class
on moral reasoning.
Marshall spoke on how the
death penalty is still a major prob
lem in California, citing the fact
that 648 prisoners are currently on
death row, with six people up for
execution in the next few months.
Both speakers also advocated life
without parole as a more morally
and fiscally responsible alternative
to the death penalty.
Most of all, however, Prejean
emphasized the affect that the
power to kill has on society. With
tongue in cheek, she applied the
vengeful attitude of capital punish
ment to other crimes.
'"You rape, now you're going to
feel what it's like," she said. "Every
Friday night, rape squad!' Why
don't we do that? It's because of
what happens to the guards on the
rape squad. What does it do to us
when we have the power to decide
who to kill?"
Faced with the tough question
of how to deal with cruel murder
ers like Adolf Eichmann and
Richard Allen Davis, Marshall as
sented to the fact that criminal jus
tice is not always clear-cut, but nev
ertheless insisted that capital pun
ishment is an unsatisfactory' way to
deal with the problem.
He asked a student questioner
from the audience,"ls the marginal
sense of safety you get from exe
cuting the prisoner worth a system
that kills people based on racism or
arbitrary geographic disparities,
people who are mentally retarded
or poor people who don't have
lawyers?"

punishment, Prejean highlighted
the importance of discourse, "the
American people say they support
the death penalty, but that's be
cause we haven't reflected on it.
The more we educate people, then
the more the people themselves
will become the voice."
Prejean made a special appeal
to the students in the audience to
engage in dialogue with their
politicians, noting that "politicians
love being looked up to by the
young. They're always talking with
the young people."
Marshall too noted his hope for
change.
"There were 130 death sen
tences last year, compared to 320
every year going back just seven or
eight years ago — there's been a
real turn of the tide." he said. He
also spoke optimistically about an
ongoing California commission
that is studying the fairness of the
application of the death penalty.
The audience reacted positively
throughout the event, with bursts
of laughter at Prejean's wit, and
many people lined up to ask ques
tions after the presentation.
Suzanna Brickman, a third-year
law student, said,"lt's very inspira
tional to have somebody like Larry
Marshall here at Stanford and
being able to attract such interna
tional figures as Sister Helen."
