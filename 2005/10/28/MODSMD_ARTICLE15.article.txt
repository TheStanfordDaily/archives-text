Iberia
1026 Alma Street, Menlo Park
Tapas from $ 1.75 to $4.95
Entrees more expensive.

Adam is driving North on El
Camino. We're going a place in
Menlo Park that serves tapas,
which I fell in love with this summer.
Tapas are Spanish sampler plates —
kind of like dim sum, in that lots of small
dishes can be eaten as a meal.
"Guess what I saw this morning," says
Charlie, interrupting my food fantasy.
"What?"
"On the whiteboard in my hall, ? was
calculated out to like a hundred digits. It
covered the whole board. It was artistic,
too. Some digits were written in red, and
the red ones were in the shape of ?."
"That's Stanford for you," I say, as we
pull into Iberia's parking lot.
As we walk inside, the restaurant and bar
is nicer than we're dressed for. Well, at least
Bianca changed out of her pajama pants.
At night, Iberia serves tapas in the bar
area only and offers more expensive en
trees in the dining room. While you need a
reservation to eat in the dining room,
there's space for all seven of us at the bar.
The waiter, however, is not sure he
wants to let us eat there. He's doubts we are
all 18 or over, which hurts my feelings be
cause I think he's looking at me.
"We're all in college!" I insist. "We go
to Stanford!"
"You look younger," he says. But he
seats us at the bar anyway.
Seven is an awkward number for the
set-up. We end up dragging two armchairs
and a few stools to a miniature table. De
spite the inconvenience, the room is classy,
candlelit and cozy with dark wood booths
and a real fireplace. Above the bar are
glass display cases with elaborate Spanish
tapestries. Juxtaposed with the authentic
setting are framed photos from dog shows.
Behind the bar, the bartender is hacking
prosciutto off a very large, very graphic leg
of ham.
"Where's Iberia?" Matt asks, distract
ing me from the meat.
"Spain and Portugal," Adam says.
"Is it like Siberia?" someone quips.
Adam answers, "Yes, this restaurant is
actually" 'Iberia"with an apostrophe."
" 'Iberia" is a place in Russia where
everyone has a lisp," Matt concludes.
Our waiter, who is not in fact Russian or
lisping, hands us the tapas menu. There are
almost 30 choices. We decide to each order
two or three that look good and share. The
braised veal with walnuts gets rave re
views, as do the pork skewers with herbs
and cumin.
I'm a fan of the empanadilla de polio,
which is a chicken and sweet pepper
turnover. I also order a plate of marinated
olives and spiced walnuts — extremely en
tertaining finger food. Debz likes the gam
bas a la plancha, which are grilled prawns
with garlic. Also, try the warm cheddar
cheese scones and the braised lamb with
tomatoes and garlic.
The tapas are cheap, but it's a little de
ceptive because the dishes are so small.
Nobody's full after the first round, so we
order more.
While we're waiting for the server to
bring out more food, watching people at
the bar sparks a conversation about drink
ing. Specifically, Matt's drinking.
"What if how much you drank was a unit
of measure?" I say. "Like, one kraning is how
much Matt Kraning drinks in an evening."
"Yeah," Matt says. "Kraning with a low
ercase k. Capital K could be Kilokraning."
"Capital K is already Kelvins," Adam
says. "Kilokranings is has to be kk."
"Could you have kilokranings times
Kelvins?"
"Only if you don't care that your units
are kkK," Debz says.
"What's a kilokraning times Kelvin?" I
ask.
"The amount of energy required to — "
Matt starts.
Debz interrupts, "It's the amount you
have to drink for this to make sense."
The check arrives, cutting the conversa
tion short. We each spend close to $20,
which seems steep. At least with my
friends, I don't have to pay fora movie
after dinner. The film would be significant
ly less entertaining than the dining experi
ence with this crowd.
The verdict:
If I'm in the mood for tapas, I'll check
out somewhere else. Iberia has decent food,
but it's too expensive for the small portions.

Matt starts.
Debz interrupts, "It's the amount you
have to drink for this to make sense."
The check arrives, cutting the conversa
tion short. We each spend close to $20,
which seems steep. At least with my
friends, I don't have to pay fora movie
after dinner. The film would be significant
ly less entertaining than the dining experi
ence with this crowd.
The verdict:
If I'm in the mood for tapas, I'll check
out somewhere else. Iberia has decent food,
but it's too expensive for the small portions.

Iberia
1026 Alma Street, Menlo Park
Tapas from $ 1.75 to $4.95
Entrees more expensive.

Adam is driving North on El
Camino. We're going a place in
Menlo Park that serves tapas,
which I fell in love with this summer.
Tapas are Spanish sampler plates —
kind of like dim sum, in that lots of small
dishes can be eaten as a meal.
"Guess what I saw this morning," says
Charlie, interrupting my food fantasy.
"What?"
"On the whiteboard in my hall, ? was
calculated out to like a hundred digits. It
covered the whole board. It was artistic,
too. Some digits were written in red, and
the red ones were in the shape of ?."
"That's Stanford for you," I say, as we
pull into Iberia's parking lot.
As we walk inside, the restaurant and bar
is nicer than we're dressed for. Well, at least
Bianca changed out of her pajama pants.
At night, Iberia serves tapas in the bar
area only and offers more expensive en
trees in the dining room. While you need a
reservation to eat in the dining room,
there's space for all seven of us at the bar.
The waiter, however, is not sure he
wants to let us eat there. He's doubts we are
all 18 or over, which hurts my feelings be
cause I think he's looking at me.
"We're all in college!" I insist. "We go
to Stanford!"
"You look younger," he says. But he
seats us at the bar anyway.
Seven is an awkward number for the
set-up. We end up dragging two armchairs
and a few stools to a miniature table. De
spite the inconvenience, the room is classy,
candlelit and cozy with dark wood booths
and a real fireplace. Above the bar are
glass display cases with elaborate Spanish
tapestries. Juxtaposed with the authentic
setting are framed photos from dog shows.
Behind the bar, the bartender is hacking
prosciutto off a very large, very graphic leg
of ham.
"Where's Iberia?" Matt asks, distract
ing me from the meat.
"Spain and Portugal," Adam says.
"Is it like Siberia?" someone quips.
Adam answers, "Yes, this restaurant is
actually" 'Iberia"with an apostrophe."
" 'Iberia" is a place in Russia where
everyone has a lisp," Matt concludes.
Our waiter, who is not in fact Russian or
lisping, hands us the tapas menu. There are
almost 30 choices. We decide to each order
two or three that look good and share. The
braised veal with walnuts gets rave re
views, as do the pork skewers with herbs
and cumin.
I'm a fan of the empanadilla de polio,
which is a chicken and sweet pepper
turnover. I also order a plate of marinated
olives and spiced walnuts — extremely en
tertaining finger food. Debz likes the gam
bas a la plancha, which are grilled prawns
with garlic. Also, try the warm cheddar
cheese scones and the braised lamb with
tomatoes and garlic.
The tapas are cheap, but it's a little de
ceptive because the dishes are so small.
Nobody's full after the first round, so we
order more.
While we're waiting for the server to
bring out more food, watching people at
the bar sparks a conversation about drink
ing. Specifically, Matt's drinking.
"What if how much you drank was a unit
of measure?" I say. "Like, one kraning is how
much Matt Kraning drinks in an evening."
"Yeah," Matt says. "Kraning with a low
ercase k. Capital K could be Kilokraning."
"Capital K is already Kelvins," Adam
says. "Kilokranings is has to be kk."
"Could you have kilokranings times
Kelvins?"
"Only if you don't care that your units
are kkK," Debz says.
"What's a kilokraning times Kelvin?" I
ask.
"The amount of energy required to — "
Matt starts.
Debz interrupts, "It's the amount you
have to drink for this to make sense."
