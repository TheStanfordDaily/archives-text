There's only one thing more fun than
being anyone from Karl Rove to a candy
striper for Halloween — being anyone from
Karl Rove to a candy striper while hyped-up
on sugar. While you may not be able to do
this at the recently-cancelled Mausoleum
Party on campus, the Bay Area offers both
scaredy-pants and thrill-seekers a plethora
of other opportunities to celebrate Oct. 31.
Here are just a couple.
Alcatraz Night Tours
Alcatraz may seem a little intimidating in
the daylight, but by night the former peni
tentiary becomes something even scarier.
Although the tiny prison island is only
1.25 miles from downtown San Francisco,
the icy waters surrounding the island make
the prison site seem much further away.
As freshman Craig McFadden says,
"There is this amazing spook factor sur
rounding Alcatraz at night — something
about the fog rolling over the island as the
ferry docks."
Night tours depart from Fisherman's
Wharf year-round, Thursdays through Sun
days. From Sept. 27 to April 22, there are two
tours per night — the first tour leaves the
wharf at 4:20 p.m. and departs the island at
6:45 p.m.The second takes off at 5:10 p.m. and
leaves Alcatraz at 7:35 p.m.To book a spot on
a tour, visit http://www.alcatraztickets.com.

Make sure to bundle up for the San Fran
cisco cold, intensified by the windy ferry ride
across the Bay. A good group of friends can
take the place of blankets to help fight the
frigid temperature.
However. Alcatraz has more to offer than
just harsh weather and creepy fog.
"It was interesting to go into the jail cells
— a view Stanford students wouldn't nor
mally see," McFadden says. "Even just to
learn about the history of the island adds ex
citement to the experience."
This history includes Alcatraz's many in
famous inmates such as A1 Capone, Machine
Gun Kelly and Robert "Birdman" Stroud.
Once on the island, you have the option
of an audio tour for $16 or a non-audio tour
for $11.50. From personal experience, I rec
ommend shelling out the extra $4.50, if only
because there is nothing more eerie than
being inside a dark jail cell while listening to
the dramatic re-creations of prison voices
and sounds.
McFadden agrees, but experienced a dif
ferent highlight.
"The best part was at the end of the tour
when you were walking back to the ferry and
you saw the city up in lights juxtaposed with
the grim view of the island and its haunting
lighthouse engulfed in fog," he says.
Halloween in the Castro
If you prefer crazy costumes and live music
to fog and jail cells, head over to the Castro
District of San Francisco instead.

Senior Varun Swarup has attended Hal
loween in the Castro for the past two years,
and when asked what he's going to do this
year, he enthusiastically replies,"The Castro!"
The street fair encompasses the area be
tween Market and Castro Streets, conse
quently closing off that area to traffic.
According to Halloween in the Castro's
Web site, "Public transportation is the only
smart way to get to Halloween in the Castro
— unless, of course, you're walking."
The nearest BART station to the Castro
is located at 16th and Mission Streets. There
will also be four taxi stands set up at 14th
and Market Streets, 19th and Castro Streets,
Market and Diamond Streets and Market
and Dolores Streets.
Caltrain will probably not work well, be
cause no trains run between 12:01 to 4:55
a.m. on weekdays.
More than 250,000 people are expected
to join in the fun on Monday, Oct. 31. The
party in the Castro will begin at 7 p.m. and
continue through midnight.
Patrons can choose to donate $5 at the
event, but attending is free of charge. The
celebrations begin with the annual March of
Light Parade at the intersection of Market
and Octavia Streets and include entertain
ment with live performances, DJs and cos
tume contests.
"There are dance parties at many street
corners and a variety of music, so if you're
not into techno, for example, just keep mov
ing forward," Swarup says.
He adds that he remembers crazv cos

tumes, featuring everyone from Jesus Christ
to NFL players.
"There was this guy dressed as an insect,"
Swarup says."He even had a small jet pack
so that he could buzz around."
On a more serious note, the Castro has a
strict policy of "NO Booze. NO Drugs, NO
Bashing." As the event's Web site explains,
"Our goal is a fun, neighborhood Halloween
celebration. All are welcome, but remember
the Castro is the heart of our city's gay, les
bian, bisexual and transgender community.
Individuals who are intoxicated or violent
will quickly meet San Francisco police offi
cers and spend the rest of the evening in
County Jail 9."
So have fun but be respectful. It's easy
enough to do and if you play your cards
right, you might even become the center of
attention.
As Swarup recalls fondly. "All of my
friends and I were dressed in different col
ored 'Scream' masks and we were head
banging to the music when these Japanese
tourists approached us and asked to take
videos with us."
Sounds like a good time to me.

For additional off-campus Halloween fun,
check out the Vampire Tour, http://www.sf
vampiretour.com, at Gothic Nob Hill in San
Francisco. Or, venture out on the Queen Ann
Hotel's San Francisco Ghost Hunt —
http://www.sfghostlumt.com — most likely
the only local Halloween event to boast "near
ly three hours of guaranteed unearthly fun!"
