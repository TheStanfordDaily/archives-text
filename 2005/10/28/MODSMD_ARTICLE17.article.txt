# Panel will address war crimes against women
## 
### MITALI THAKOR 
Women have been subjected to rape and other forms
of violent abuse during wartime for centuries, and the past
two decades have been no exception. Hutu extremist
forces raped 250,000 Rwandan women in 1994 alone, ac
cording to the United Nations; more than 20,000 women
and girls in the Balkans were held captive in rape camps
since war broke out in 1992;and a 2002 Burmese report de
scribed the systematic rape of over 600 ethnic Shan girls
and women by Burmese troops.
As shocking statistics like these continue to climb, they
raise an important question: What kinds of institutions are
working to combat systematic violence against women dur
ing national and international conflicts?
An upcoming Red Cross seminar will target exactly this
question on Thursday, Nov. 3 — a panel of speakers will ad
dress the role of International Humanitarian Law in pro
tecting women's rights and lives in today's war zones. The
event, "Understanding the Effects of War on Women and
the Role of International Humanitarian Law," will be held
in Tresidder's Oak Room at 7 p.m. for students and the gen
eral public.
War-time situations generate hazardous territory for
women, who often become refugees, sex slaves or forced
fighters in the crossfire. Additionally, rape and other vio
lence tend to be used against women as a military terror tac
tic, borne out of displacement and isolation.
Next week's seminar will look primarily at the preven
tion of these acts through International Humanitarian Law
(IHL), a legal compilation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions,
the Hague Relations and subsequent laws and treaties.
According to junior Mark Liao, who organized the sem
inar, the talk will focus on the power of IHL to protect
women's rights.
"The event hopes to provide a broad glimpse of how con
flict affects women and how International Humanitarian
Law is able — or not able — to protect this vulnerable pop
ulation," Liao says.
"The risk of sexual violence, including rape, forced pros
titution, forced maternity or forced sterilization are notable
and horrific acts against women, and IHL attempts to pro
tect women from such atrocities."
Palo Alto Red Cross International Committee Chair
Katie Hubner explains that the seminar will gear discus
sion of these global issues specifically toward the Universi
ty audience.
"Stanford students have a history of looking at and at
tacking social justice and human rights issues," she explains.
According to Katherine Federovitch, director of emer

gency services for the Red Cross's Palo Alto chapter, this ap
proach of the seminar parallels the Red Cross's new "strate
gic direction, [which] encourages the Red Cross to target
youth and young adults to invigorate the system."
Liao says he agrees.
"Students are our generation's bearers of conscience
and ethics — as leaders, it will be imperative for them to
understand how IHL is important in protecting and pre
serving lives."
This is the Red Cross' fourth annual IHL seminar and
the focus on women will be analyzed by four speakers from
diverse backgrounds.They will discuss current zones of con
flict. including Burma, the Eastern Congo region, Azerbai
jan and Armenia.
"A lot of the conflicts...have been raging over the past
year," Hubner says."(The speakers will describe) conflicts
they have physically worked in, [focusing on] displacement
and sexual violence."
Speakers were recommended to the Red Cross by the
International Rescue Committee (IRC),"a global leader in
providing emergency relief, rehabilitation, protection of
human rights, post-conflict development, resettlement serv
ices and advocacy for those uprooted or affected by conflict
and oppression," according to its Web site.
TTie seminar panel is headed by Katie Zoglin, a lawyer.

author and former Stanford Law School professor, who
serves on the Executive Committee of Human Rights Watch
for Northern California. Zoglin has spent a year working on
gender discrimination issues in Serbia and Macedonia, and
her professional focuses include war-crime tribunals, rape
and human rights abuses under military regimes.
The second speaker will be Sean Kennedy, a Stanford
alumnus who was the 2002-2003 program officer for the IRC
in Bukavu. Democratic Republic of Congo. Kennedy's work
centers primary on health care, water and sanitation and
community development.
Wynne Nayane, current director for development at the
Foundation for the People of Burma, a nonprofit California
organization, will also discuss the mass displacement of
women and children along the Burma-Thailand border. Fi
nally, Arzu Sandugi,employment case Manager for the IRC,
will share her experiences with helping refugees resettle.
Liao says he believes these speakers will help the Stan
ford community gain a better understanding of the devastat
ing consequences suffered by women during war.
"It is inescapable that this topic highlights the importance
of understanding who conflict affects." he says."The ramifi
cations of war on the wife-husband, mother-child and
woman-community structure can be so adversely affected it
is truly a tragedy to see it happen across the globe."

This is the Red Cross' fourth annual IHL seminar and
the focus on women will be analyzed by four speakers from
diverse backgrounds.They will discuss current zones of con
flict. including Burma, the Eastern Congo region, Azerbai
jan and Armenia.
"A lot of the conflicts...have been raging over the past
year," Hubner says."(The speakers will describe) conflicts
they have physically worked in, [focusing on] displacement
and sexual violence."
Speakers were recommended to the Red Cross by the
International Rescue Committee (IRC),"a global leader in
providing emergency relief, rehabilitation, protection of
human rights, post-conflict development, resettlement serv
ices and advocacy for those uprooted or affected by conflict
and oppression," according to its Web site.
TTie seminar panel is headed by Katie Zoglin, a lawyer.

author and former Stanford Law School professor, who
serves on the Executive Committee of Human Rights Watch
for Northern California. Zoglin has spent a year working on
gender discrimination issues in Serbia and Macedonia, and
her professional focuses include war-crime tribunals, rape
and human rights abuses under military regimes.
The second speaker will be Sean Kennedy, a Stanford
alumnus who was the 2002-2003 program officer for the IRC
in Bukavu. Democratic Republic of Congo. Kennedy's work
centers primary on health care, water and sanitation and
community development.
Wynne Nayane, current director for development at the
Foundation for the People of Burma, a nonprofit California
organization, will also discuss the mass displacement of
women and children along the Burma-Thailand border. Fi
nally, Arzu Sandugi,employment case Manager for the IRC,
will share her experiences with helping refugees resettle.
Liao says he believes these speakers will help the Stan
ford community gain a better understanding of the devastat
ing consequences suffered by women during war.
"It is inescapable that this topic highlights the importance
of understanding who conflict affects." he says."The ramifi
cations of war on the wife-husband, mother-child and
woman-community structure can be so adversely affected it
is truly a tragedy to see it happen across the globe."

Women have been subjected to rape and other forms
of violent abuse during wartime for centuries, and the past
two decades have been no exception. Hutu extremist
forces raped 250,000 Rwandan women in 1994 alone, ac
cording to the United Nations; more than 20,000 women
and girls in the Balkans were held captive in rape camps
since war broke out in 1992;and a 2002 Burmese report de
scribed the systematic rape of over 600 ethnic Shan girls
and women by Burmese troops.
As shocking statistics like these continue to climb, they
raise an important question: What kinds of institutions are
working to combat systematic violence against women dur
ing national and international conflicts?
An upcoming Red Cross seminar will target exactly this
question on Thursday, Nov. 3 — a panel of speakers will ad
dress the role of International Humanitarian Law in pro
tecting women's rights and lives in today's war zones. The
event, "Understanding the Effects of War on Women and
the Role of International Humanitarian Law," will be held
in Tresidder's Oak Room at 7 p.m. for students and the gen
eral public.
War-time situations generate hazardous territory for
women, who often become refugees, sex slaves or forced
fighters in the crossfire. Additionally, rape and other vio
lence tend to be used against women as a military terror tac
tic, borne out of displacement and isolation.
Next week's seminar will look primarily at the preven
tion of these acts through International Humanitarian Law
(IHL), a legal compilation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions,
the Hague Relations and subsequent laws and treaties.
According to junior Mark Liao, who organized the sem
inar, the talk will focus on the power of IHL to protect
women's rights.
"The event hopes to provide a broad glimpse of how con
flict affects women and how International Humanitarian
Law is able — or not able — to protect this vulnerable pop
ulation," Liao says.
"The risk of sexual violence, including rape, forced pros
titution, forced maternity or forced sterilization are notable
and horrific acts against women, and IHL attempts to pro
tect women from such atrocities."
Palo Alto Red Cross International Committee Chair
Katie Hubner explains that the seminar will gear discus
sion of these global issues specifically toward the Universi
ty audience.
"Stanford students have a history of looking at and at
tacking social justice and human rights issues," she explains.
According to Katherine Federovitch, director of emer

gency services for the Red Cross's Palo Alto chapter, this ap
proach of the seminar parallels the Red Cross's new "strate
gic direction, [which] encourages the Red Cross to target
youth and young adults to invigorate the system."
Liao says he agrees.
"Students are our generation's bearers of conscience
and ethics — as leaders, it will be imperative for them to
understand how IHL is important in protecting and pre
serving lives."
