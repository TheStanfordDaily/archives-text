## Bush to announce new nomination soon Harriet Miers declines U.S. Supreme Court nod 
### DEB RIECHMANN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush,
eager to put a bruising brawl within his own party
behind him, is expected to announce his new pick
for the Supreme Court within days.
Bush has offered no hint about his thinking on
a new nominee, but he isn't starting from scratch.
The president already has vetted and interviewed
several candidates, and White House officials
wouldn't rule out the possibility that an an
nouncement could be made as early as Friday.
Bush said Miers, the White House counsel, was
the most qualified candidate to replace retiring
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. But for three
weeks, his fellow conservatives criticized the
Texas lawyer and loyal Bush confidante for hav
ing thin credentials on constitutional law and no
proven record as a judicial conservative.
That could point Bush back to a slate of fed
eral appellate judges often mentioned as top
contenders. That list includes Samuel Alito, J.
Michael Luttig, J. Harvie Wilkinson, Alice
Batchelder, Priscilla Owen and Karen Williams
as well as Michigan Supreme Court Justice
Maura Corrigan.
Miers' lack of judicial experience was not the
key reason the president's supporters opposed
her.
Bush had trumpeted his decision to pick some

one outside the "judicial monastery" and boasted
Miers would offer a "fresh approach" to the court.
Instead. Miers' critics complained there was no
clear record to suggest how she would interpret
the Constitution — something that is expected to
be more evident with his next nominee.
Bush might also turn to a current or past sena
tor, such as Republican John Cornyn of Texas, be
cause the Senate would be more likely to embrace
one of its own.
Other prospective candidates who are not
judges include Maureen Mahoney, a frequent liti
gator before the high court. She sometimes is re
ferred to as the "female version" of John Roberts
— Bush's choice for chief justice, who was con
firmed by the Senate 78-22.
Still another is PepsiCo attorney Larry
Thompson. Bush likes and trusts Thompson, who
as deputy attorney general was the highest-rank
ing black law enforcement officer in Bush's first
term. Thompson, however, might be tagged like
Miers as someone beholden to the White House.
Bush, who leaves on a trip to Argentina. Brazil
and Panama on Thursday, has said he'll make his
next nomination in a "timely manner." Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist said he expected an an
nouncement within days, with confirmation hear
ings perhaps before Christmas.
Brad Berenson, a former staff member of the
White House counsel's office in the Bush admin
istration, said he thinks the president is likely to
return to a short list of candidates that both the
left and right agree are the most qualified.
"My own view is that we probably will not get
any of the individuals who are the very top of the

Democrats' hit list," Berenson said. "I think he's
going to try to repeat his experience with John
Roberts — someone who can be confirmed with
out touching off battle royale."
The White House said it was not the firestorm
of opposition from Bush's right flank, but the Sen
ate's demand for documents covered by attorney
client and executive privileges that forced Miers'
withdrawal. Both these reasons might make Bush
wary of choosing Attorney General Alberto Gon
zales, a longtime ally.
As with Miers, senators would seek documents
Gonzales handled in his previous post as White
House counsel, and the White House again would
claim executive privilege to deny their release.
Nominating Gonzales also would re-ignite the
very opposition Bush is trying to dampen on the
Republican right, which doesn't think Gonzales is
a reliable conservative vote on abortion and affir
mative action.
Fearing that Bush's next pick will be a darling
of the right, Ralph Neas, president of the liberal
People For the American Way, urged Bush to re
sist calls for an ultraconservative and pick some
one with a mainstream legal philosophy.
"The president must not let the extreme right
dictate his next choice, but instead choose a nom
inee who can bring us together and maintain a fair
and independent balance on the Supreme Court."
Neas said.
With his job approval rating the lowest of his
presidency. Bush may feel it is necessary to ap
pease his base, especially with the possibility that
members of the White House staff may be indict
ed in the CIA leak investigation.
