# TWO STREAKS ON THE LINE
## Soft-spoken Baba cements leadership role 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Watching Stanford's stunning 45-35 victory over Ari
zona State last weekend, it was easy to identify and appre
ciate the offensive stars — as is often the case. It's easy to
lose sight of the outstanding play by those outside of what
are considered "skill positions."
But the fact that fifth-year senior nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo's stellar performance in last weekend's game was
so visible, speaks volumes about the hard work and talent

that he brings to the
field. Oslynowo made
himself a presence in
the victory, dominat
ing Arizona State's of
fensive line while
picking up three sacks
and nine tackles.
The performance
even earned him Pac
-10 Defensive Player
of the Week honors.
He is the first Stan
ford player to garner
the title since former
Cardinal safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe col
lected the award last
season.
"It's real cool [to
win the award]," Os
hinowo said. "It's real
neat to work hard and
do well. It is a great
honor, but that was
last week's game. I
enjoyed it this week
end, bu\t now it's back
to work."
It shouldn't be sur
prising that Oshinowo
is putting up such
good numbers. This is
his third year starting,
but Oshinowo has
been a factor on the
defensive line for all
four of his years in
uniform. He has
played in every game
since his freshman
year, despite his battle
with ankle injuries.

On the season, Oshinowo has accumulated 30 tackles
and 3.5 sacks, but the numbers don't tell the whole story of
his influence. Oshinowo, a Naperville, 111. native, plays a key
leadership role for the Cardinal. As one of two seniors on
the defensive line, he is critical in motivating his teammates,
despite his admitted soft-spoken attitude.
"On the D-line, as a senior, guys look to me and [senior

defensive end] Julian (Jenkins) to set the tone in practice
and in games," Oshinowo said. "I'm not an extremely bois
terous leader — that's just my nature — but I definitely
want my actions to speak loudly. I like to think that people
look towards me in games as someone who is going to step

up and as someone they can count
on."
Yet, before last Saturday's game,
Oshinowo took a more active role in
inspiring his teammates.
"When we were walking onto the
field. I just wanted to let everyone
know that this is all that we worked
for.this is our heart out here on the
field," Oshinowo said at a press con
ference earlier this week. "Control
what you can control on the field and
do everything you can do at your po
sition. Don't try to play above your
self or do anything that you're not
responsible for, but handle your own
business. If we do that, we'll be
happy with the results."
"He was talking to our team
when we gathered on the track [be
fore the Arizona State game]," head
coach Walt Harris said during the
press conference. "When you talk to
them, you've got to back it up, and it
was great to see him back it up. We
expect that performance and more
out of him...Whether he gets that
many sacks or not. we expect him to
play at that level all the time."
Like all the seniors. Oshinowo
has been through three straight los
ing seasons and sees this year as a

chance to get back on the winning
track. He looks to take his experi
ence from those seasons and turn it
into wins this year.
"It has definitely been frustrat
ing. the last couple seasons" Oshi
nowo said."Last season we were in a
position to do really well, and we fal
tered at the end of the season. It is in
teresting when I look at the past few
seasons, it is almost like I know what
is not going to work and what things
we need to take away to be success
ful. And that is helping us right now.
We know where we've been in the
past and what we have to do in order
to keep playing well."
As a team leader, Oshinowo has
taken it upon himself to continue to
improve his own game. He has in
creased his number of tackles in
each season at Stanford and is on
pace to continue that trend this year.
"Personally, I just want to keep
getting better throughout the season
and just keep playing well," Oshi
nowo said. "People talk about after
the season, what are your long term
goals, but I've got lots of goals about
the future — about playing football
— but the only thing that can help
me in that regard is to keep playing
better at every opportunity I have."
Oshinowo has a tough task ahead
of him this week, as he must try to
contain UCLA tailback Maurice
Drew. If he can do it.he may find
himself in the spotlight once again.
