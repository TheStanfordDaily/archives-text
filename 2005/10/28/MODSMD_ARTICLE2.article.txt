# TWO STREAKS ON THE LINE
## Soft-spoken Baba cements leadership role 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Watching Stanford's stunning 45-35 victory over Ari
zona State last weekend, it was easy to identify and appre
ciate the offensive stars — as is often the case. It's easy to
lose sight of the outstanding play by those outside of what
are considered "skill positions."
But the fact that fifth-year senior nose tackle Babatunde
Oshinowo's stellar performance in last weekend's game was
so visible, speaks volumes about the hard work and talent

that he brings to the
field. Oslynowo made
himself a presence in
the victory, dominat
ing Arizona State's of
fensive line while
picking up three sacks
and nine tackles.
The performance
even earned him Pac
-10 Defensive Player
of the Week honors.
He is the first Stan
ford player to garner
the title since former
Cardinal safety Osh
iomogho Atogwe col
lected the award last
season.
"It's real cool [to
win the award]," Os
hinowo said. "It's real
neat to work hard and
do well. It is a great
honor, but that was
last week's game. I
enjoyed it this week
end, bu\t now it's back
to work."
It shouldn't be sur
prising that Oshinowo
is putting up such
good numbers. This is
his third year starting,
but Oshinowo has
been a factor on the
defensive line for all
four of his years in
uniform. He has
played in every game
since his freshman
year, despite his battle
with ankle injuries.

On the season, Oshinowo has accumulated 30 tackles
and 3.5 sacks, but the numbers don't tell the whole story of
his influence. Oshinowo, a Naperville, 111. native, plays a key
leadership role for the Cardinal. As one of two seniors on
the defensive line, he is critical in motivating his teammates,
despite his admitted soft-spoken attitude.
"On the D-line, as a senior, guys look to me and [senior

defensive end] Julian (Jenkins) to set the tone in practice
and in games," Oshinowo said. "I'm not an extremely bois
terous leader — that's just my nature — but I definitely
want my actions to speak loudly. I like to think that people
look towards me in games as someone who is going to step

Senior wide receiver Marcus McCutcheon and the Cardinal could use the momentum gained against Arizona State for
tomorrow's game against an offensivelystrong UCLA.
