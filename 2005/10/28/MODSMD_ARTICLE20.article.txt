## Editorial Reunion Weekend should connect generations 
### 
We were pondering improvements to
Reunion Homecoming Weekend,
and we came up with a marvelous
idea: make Alumni Weekend like Admit
Weekend, except for the Class of 1965 in
stead of the Class of 2010. Imagine it. The
HoHo's (House Hosts) could greet the
alumni as they rolled up to campus, and
RoHo's (Room Hosts) could tell alumni to
sleep on their floors. We're only sort of kid
ding.
Alumni Weekend came off well this year,
complete with a thrashing of the Washington
State football team. It was once again a suc
cessful opportunity for Stanford alums to re
unite, bask in the glory of their golden days,
and meet and greet current students.
It is this last item — commingling with
current students — that we want to focus
on. A couple of suggestions could improve
an already thriving weekend for next year.
Although Reunion Weekend serves as a
chance for alumni to connect with one an
other, interactions between Stanford
grads and students who are not involved
in running events tend to be sparse and
random.
One hilarious and perhaps ridiculous idea
would be to allow residents in a few dorms to
host alumni fora night or just an evening. Vis
iting alumni (probably mostly recent ones)
could crash for the night or just hang out with
current students. Alumni could relive the
dormitory experience and swap stories about
pranks, parties and the never-ending flow of
alcohol that supposedly used to exist.
A less intense program would allow
Stanford residents to "host" alumni on Fri
day afternoon. The students could bring

them to lunch in the dining hall, talk about
the classes they're taking, the organizations
they're involved with on campus and how
the Stanford of today differs from that of
yesteryear.
Dorms should host more barbeques and
hors d'oeuvres events Friday afternoon or
evening.This year was the 50th anniversary
of Wilbur, so the dorm complex had a cake
and punch social Friday afternoon that al
lowed current Wilbur residents to meet
alumni of the dorm. Alumni took the
chance to find their old Wilbur rooms, and
students could show them how Wilbur has
changed (some alumni were amused to
learn that formerly all-male Wilbur is now
co-ed). This event was an excellent exam
ple of how Stanford students new and old
could better connect during the weekend.
These activities should be even further ex
panded.
Finally, if Stanford planned a few events
specifically for current students to connect
with ex-students — based on major, fresh
man dorm or extracurriculars — during
Alumni Weekend, it could spur more inter
est in the weekend as a whole. Many stu
dents, particularly those living far away
from where most alumni programming took
place, noticed few tangible differences on
campus other than clueless people with
nametags.
The chance to interact with alums, make
connections and discuss how rowdy Rin
conada was 50 years ago should be enough
of a reason to get students excited about the
weekend. But, if nothing else, in true Stan
ford fashion, a free Reunion Weekend t-shirt
would guarantee a crowd.
