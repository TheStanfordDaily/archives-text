# Athletic distinctions

Why does your perfume smell like
chlorine? Don't you ever wear any
normal clothes? Is that a banana in
your pocket or are you just...and we'll stop
you right there. These may be just a few of
the questions that you have been dying to
ask many of the mystifying individuals with
whom you share your classes, dining halls
and living quarters.That's fine. It's natural to
be curious, and with athletes making up
somewhere around 15 percent of the student
body, there is no doubt that you have raised
an eyebrow or two at some of their idiosyn
crasies.
With a little help from your Daily colum
nists, you will hopefully be able to identify
and embrace your quirky athletic class
mates. Oh, and for the record, that is a ba
nana in his pocket, and unless you're a box of
cereal or a gallon of milk, he's probably not
all that happy to see you.
We here at Stanford Student-Athlete labs
have developed a foolproof five-step sense
test for locating athletes in your classes.
You've got five senses, kids. Use'em. If you
dare.
• Listen: You're hanging on every word
of your professor's sociology lecture when
all of a sudden, a loud rustling noise reach
es your eardrums. You turn around. What
in tarnation is that? You check first to see if
someone is waving an empty plastic bag
around a few centimeters away from your
ear. Nope. You look further and further
away until your eyes finally rest on that girl
nine rows away from you. No, not the girl

surreptitiously holding a bagel under her
desk — she just forgot to eat breakfast.
We're talking about the sweaty, cardinal
clad pile of ice bags and athletic tape
proudly munching on carrots and a cookie
dough Balance bar. scrunching the wrap
per like it ain't no thang. CRACK.

Good God, those things should come with
silencers.
• Look: We'll start with the obvious.The
quickest way to spot an athlete may well be
by looking for them. First, keep your eyes
peeled for athlete-related paraphernalia:
tape, ice bags, ace bandages, protein shakes,
wet hair, Nike swooshes, golf cart keys, etc.
Now check out the state of your test sub
ject. Does she look tired? Bedraggled? Do
her clothes match? Take our word for it —
if she looks like she's been up since seven,
she's probably been up since six. If her or
ange t-shirt doesn't match her red sweat
pants. it's because they all look the same at
that hour.
