# Athletic distinctions

### 
Why does your perfume smell like
chlorine? Don't you ever wear any
normal clothes? Is that a banana in
your pocket or are you just...and we'll stop
you right there. These may be just a few of
the questions that you have been dying to
ask many of the mystifying individuals with
whom you share your classes, dining halls
and living quarters.That's fine. It's natural to
be curious, and with athletes making up
somewhere around 15 percent of the student
body, there is no doubt that you have raised
an eyebrow or two at some of their idiosyn
crasies.
With a little help from your Daily colum
nists, you will hopefully be able to identify
and embrace your quirky athletic class
mates. Oh, and for the record, that is a ba
nana in his pocket, and unless you're a box of
cereal or a gallon of milk, he's probably not
all that happy to see you.
We here at Stanford Student-Athlete labs
have developed a foolproof five-step sense
test for locating athletes in your classes.
You've got five senses, kids. Use'em. If you
dare.
• Listen: You're hanging on every word
of your professor's sociology lecture when
all of a sudden, a loud rustling noise reach
es your eardrums. You turn around. What
in tarnation is that? You check first to see if
someone is waving an empty plastic bag
around a few centimeters away from your
ear. Nope. You look further and further
away until your eyes finally rest on that girl
nine rows away from you. No, not the girl

surreptitiously holding a bagel under her
desk — she just forgot to eat breakfast.
We're talking about the sweaty, cardinal
clad pile of ice bags and athletic tape
proudly munching on carrots and a cookie
dough Balance bar. scrunching the wrap
per like it ain't no thang. CRACK.

Good God, those things should come with
silencers.
• Look: We'll start with the obvious.The
quickest way to spot an athlete may well be
by looking for them. First, keep your eyes
peeled for athlete-related paraphernalia:
tape, ice bags, ace bandages, protein shakes,
wet hair, Nike swooshes, golf cart keys, etc.
Now check out the state of your test sub
ject. Does she look tired? Bedraggled? Do
her clothes match? Take our word for it —
if she looks like she's been up since seven,
she's probably been up since six. If her or
ange t-shirt doesn't match her red sweat
pants. it's because they all look the same at
that hour.

• Smell: Never underestimate
the power of smell in athlete loca
tion. Not that you would. Let's face
it, when we're going to be practic
ing at noon, showering for our
morning classes seems highly over
rated. And if we're practicing again
at six. showering for afternoon
classes is sort of overrated as well.
Come on. It's like vacuuming the
carpet right before you take down
the Christmas tree. Remember
when you used to whine at mom for
making you make your bed? "Aww,
Ma, I'm just going to mess it up
again in 15 hours." Same deal.
Who's got time for personal hy
giene these days?
But it gets better. And by better,
we mean "sport-specific." If you
spend a lot of time in the company
of different athletes, you begin to
notice subtle differences in their
delectable aromas. Gymnasts smell
like chalk, soccer players smell like
grass, runners smell like feet and
the crew team may smell like the
fishy waters of Redwood City. And
divers just smell like stink.
Now take heed — you kids who
are into aromatherapy are gonna
love this. If you're really good at the
athlete smell-detection game, you
can start innovating, choosing your
seatmates based on the scent
you're craving. We find that a water

polo player and a golfer sitting to
gether make a pretty sweet pot
pourri, but we've also heard that
some prefer eau-de-rugby-and
shot-put. Every taste is different —
we recommend switching your seat
around the back half of the Stats 60
lecture hall until you find a combi
nation that's to your liking.
• Taste: While it is true that if
you lick a swimmer your taste buds
will erupt with that distinctive tang
of chlorine, take a bite out of any
other athlete and believe it or not it
will taste sort of like chicken. You
probably should just take our word
for it.
• Touch: With their 15 layers of
sweatshirts, T-shirts, gym shorts and
wind pants, athletes are so irre
sistibly warm and fuzzy that some
times you may find yourself with an
irresistible urge to snuggle right up
next to them in the middle of your
humbio lecture. Not to worry,
there's no shame in it.
So now that you are armed with
powers to seek out athletes wher
ever they may roam, we present the
call to action. When you see a starv
ing athlete, offer up a granola bar
instead of a menacing glare. When
you encounter that offensive smell,
breathe through your mouth in
stead of reaching for your gas
mask. And for goodness sake,snug
gle to your heart's content.
