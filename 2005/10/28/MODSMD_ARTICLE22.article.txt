### AMIR MALAYERY 
The Oct. 7 column by Cassidy Krug and
Kevin Mclean ("Anti-athlete paranoia
runs wild"), in which they attempt to cor
rect some of the rumors and myths about
athletes on campus, was interesting. I must
say, however, that last week's column
("Speeding athletes, but no Mercedes")
was quite counterproductive. Without get
ting too personal, which could justifiably
be done as you took some pretty direct
shots in last Friday's Daily, I would like to
clear up a few false assumptions and hope
fully accomplish what they tried to do a lit
tle over two weeks ago: dispel beliefs of in
equality.
The first mistake Krug and Mclean
made was not in their exaggerated "broken
fingernail" analogy of athletes unfairly re
ceiving treatment that would be denied to
"scrawny math major[s]." Still, it's a pretty
good starting point to explain a few things.

(Their first mistake, by the way, was their
reference to the "monstrous pack of four
wheelers penned outside of Meyer Li
brary." These happen to be part of the fleet
owned by the Stanford Disability Re
source Center.) Until enforcement of the
official University policy was stepped up
recently, anybody on campus could techni
cally get away with driving a golf cart —
athlete or non-athlete. Now it is a little
more difficult to do so; several golf carts
around Arrillaga, owned by athletes, have
already been towed.
In regard to the amount of special treat
ment they say is reserved for injured ath
letes, they still have to present their situa
tion and ask for the number of a golf cart
company so that they can rent a golf cart on
their own — the same steps an injured
non-athlete would have to follow at the
Disability Resource Center.
