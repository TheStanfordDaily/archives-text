# Commencement, Roman style
## 
### 
It's only fitting that the Class of 2006
won't be graduating in the stadium he
cause of construction. After all, when we
first arrived, Branner, the symbol of fresh
man year bacchanalia, had been gutted and
was a site of drunken revelry only for con
struction workers. No wonder our class is full
of fuddy-duddies.
We're trying to imagine the worst-case sce
nario. The administration decides to remodel
every auditorium, field, dining hall and cul-de
sac on campus during Commencement. Con
tractors in the Bay Area rejoice. But with sor
rowful hearts, all the members of the Class of
2006 inform their families, friends and admir
ers that there will be no Commencement this
year. A short motivational/retrospective ad
dress will be delivered to interested parties by
e-mail, and diplomas will be picked up from
stacks outside the doors of department offices.
Maybe it's all for the best.
Quite frankly, the idea of graduating in
the stadium gives us the heebie-jeebies. On
that football field, surrounded by the fans in
the stands and the smell of roasting track
rubber, we feel like we should be trying to
win something. What's the game? Why didn't
anyone tell us we were playing? Congratula
tions, you've won at college; welcome to the
rat race. Now's your chance to win at life?

Your diploma is your Golden Ticket. In fact,
we've already begun composing our accept
ance speeches.
"Dear Diploma,
For four years, I've struggled. I've
watched the sun rise, slept in the Bender
Room and wrestled myself from the grasp
of hangovers just to finish papers. I've been
dumped by friends, been through breakups
and sworn off relationships just to find my
way to this podium, here today. All fora lit
tle piece of paper. But I couldn't have done
it alone. I want to thank the Academy, my
parents, my siblings, my third cousin twice
removed and even my kindergarten teacher
Mrs. Darling, who taught me all those fun
damentals of the alphabet without which 1
would have been completely lost. And I
want to thank you too, Diploma. With you

at my side, I am not afraid to face the fu
ture."
The only thing we can think of that's more
frightening than facing our future is facing a
pack of famished lions in the Roman Colise
um. Come to think of it, the Coliseum would
seat a lot of people. Maybe we could just hold
Commencement there. Throw the graduates
to the lions. And if we survive, it will prove
the utility of our degrees.
Can't you just see it? All the parents in
their togas watching their children battle for
their lives. The engineers construct rudi
mentary weapons from their caps and
gowns. The political scientists suggest that
violence may not be the only option.The bi
ologists resign themselves to their place on
the food chain and in Darwin's grand plan.
The statisticians, having already calculated
their chances of survival, sit down and have
a cup of tea. Meanwhile, all the humanities
majors cower together in a corner, compos
ing perfect epitaphs in the style of the later
Romantic poets.
The Coliseum is looking better and better.

If you'd like to join Robin and Miri at the town
hall meeting to defend lions as a viable addi
tion to Commencement, e-mail robinp@stan
