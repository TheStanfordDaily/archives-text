Animal rights is not anti-science
I would like to commend The Daily on its
coverage of a tough issue: animal experimen
tation and science ("Activism focuses on
monkey business," Oct. 25). However, at
times, animal-rights advocates were inaccu
rately depicted as being anti-science. I recog
nize that scientific and medical advances
come from experiments involving animalsâ€”
animals ranging from fruit flies to chimps.
While I question how efficiently we can
apply some results to humans, I do not doubt
that what animal researchers are doing at
Stanford is science.
That said, having achieved beneficial re
sults in the past does not bar us from finding
more effective, and more humane, alterna
tives today. As a scientist, I respect the search
for knowledge in all its forms, but I also want
that search to be done using a progressing,
ethical method. Science is adept at overcom
ing the obstacles in nature; we must ensure
that we apply those same problem-solving
skills to the complications that ethics intro
duces.
Neurobiology Prof. William Newsome is
quoted in the piece as indicating that, if ani
mal experimentation had been halted a cen
tury ago, today we would be stricken with
polio and would be dying of diabetes. This
claim is very revealing: We are still using the
same medical models we used a century ago!

Do those who oppose seeking alternatives to
animal research have such little faith in
human ingenuity? Those unsatisfied with an
imal research promote both humanity and
progress away from the archaic and cruel
practices protested by ARF last Friday.
As I scientist, I will not question the scien
tific validity of animal research; as a human, I
cannot ignore the medical benefits derived
from such experiments. But I do question the
ethical validity of animal exploitation and
urge fellow scientists and humans to push for
viable alternatives.

Embrace yourself
As a former grad student who neverthe
less proudly attended Full Moon on the
Quad, here's my advice to Clayton Brown
("You'll all be geezers eventually," Oct. 26):
Suck it up. We are sketchy. We're that weird
looking guy who doesn't know anybody at
the party, who hasn't talked to a female in a
week, and whose slightly-dusty social skills
show it. But undergrads do some pretty
sketchy stuff as well.
Think about cowboys and schoolgirls,
pimps and hos, jello-wrestling. and dancing
on the tables. It's not just the grad students
on this campus who are trying to get laid.
Most of the tender undergrad vixens that

your typical grad student is after would pre
fer someone with the balls to embrace his
identity over a grad student who stammers
and averts his eyes when asked what year he
is and then protests loudly that he isn't
sketchy. If he's playing it cool, it's all the more
evidence he's trying to get laid.
So embrace it. You're a sketchy grad stu
dent. Go compete proudly with the sketchy
undergrads.
