# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Weekend games allow Stanford to test itself Defending national champs visit the Farm for third season match 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
In just over a month's time, the No. 3
men's water polo team will be invited to
participate in the NCAA Championship
tournament for the fifth consecutive year
— but only if all goes well in the mean
time. A strong performance at the MPSF
tournament during the last weekend of
November is essential to the squad's bid
to reach NCAAs.
Under the current four-team NCAA
tournament format, only two teams from
the MPSF are eligible for selection. To
earn that selection, the Cardinal (13-3,2-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
need to play at the top of their game
every time they jump in the pool during
the coming month.
This weekend presents Stanford with
the opportunity to see where it stands, as
the Cardinal host No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
Pepperdine tomorrow and Sunday, re
spectively.
First up for the Cardinal is defending
national champion UCLA (13-4, 1-0).
The Bruins feature a high-powered of
fense that receives contributions
throughout the lineup. Senior David

Pietsch has emerged as the team's pri
mary scoring threat, leading UCLA with
32 goals. The fact that nine other Bruins
already boast double-digit goal totals

serves as a testament to the squad's depth
and talent.
Things don't get any easier in the
other end of the pool, where the Cardinal

attackers have to deal with junior goalie
Will Didinger and a tough veteran core of
UCLA defensive players.
But none of that seems to matter to the
Cardinal, who have already knocked off
UCLA twice this season in tournament
games. The first victory came in dramatic
fashion at the SoCal Open when the Car
dinal walked away with the 10-9 sudden
death win after senior captain Thomas
Hopkins converted a penalty shot in the
third overtime period. In the teams' next
meeting, the Cardinal overcame a 4-1
deficit early in the second half and surged
back to capture the victory 6-5, taking third
place at the NorCal Open tournament.
Therefore, the Cardinal approach
their third showdown with their southern
California rivals with respect and confi
dence.
"Obviously [they] have a lot of really
talented guys, so we're going to focus on
playing team defense and double-team
ing when needed," said sophomore
Sandy Hohener, who anchors the Cardi
nal defense in goal. "We need to play with
intensity and keep pressuring the ball."
Freshman two-meter Will Hindle-
Katel, who ranks third on the Cardinal
with 27 goals, echoed the importance of
controlling the contest and allowing it to
develop in favor of Stanford's strengths.
"We've been watching a lot of tape, so
we know what they're going to be coming
with." Hindle-Katel said. "We really need

to come out strong, play our game
and dictate the tempo of the
game."
Despite the fact that he's only
been a member of the Stanford
water polo program for two
months, Hindle-Katel has come to
despise the Bruins squad as much
as anv one of his teammates.
"To beat [UCLA] down [at UC
Irvine] in double overtime, that's
about as good as it gets," he said.

After their Saturday afternoon
showdown with the Bruins, the Car
dinal focus their attention on the
visiting Waves (14-5, 1-0). Pepper
dine has established itself as a dan
gerous force this season by upset
ting formerly top-ranked Southern
California, 5-4, and hanging tough
in a narrow 7-5 loss to UCLA. The
• Cardinal met the Waves once this
season, managing to hold on for the
win despite a Pepperdine offensive
explosion late in the fourth quarter.
All things considered, the Car
dinal know they face two tough as
signments in the Bruins and the
Waves.
"It'll be a tough challenge, but if

we stick to our game plan we know
we'll be all right," Hindle-Katel
said.
Senior captain Peter Varellas of
fered a similar outlook on the re
mainder of the Cardinal's season.
"It's absolutely doable," he
said, in reference to the team's as
piration to reach NCAAs. "We
can clearly beat any team on any
given day — we need to bring our
A-game every time, but we defi
nitely have the talent and team
work to get it done."

at Avery Aquatic Center tomorrow
at 1:00 p. m. before facing Pepper

months, Hindle-Katel has come to
despise the Bruins squad as much
as anv one of his teammates.
"To beat [UCLA] down [at UC
Irvine] in double overtime, that's
about as good as it gets," he said.

After their Saturday afternoon
showdown with the Bruins, the Car
dinal focus their attention on the
visiting Waves (14-5, 1-0). Pepper
dine has established itself as a dan
gerous force this season by upset
ting formerly top-ranked Southern
California, 5-4, and hanging tough
in a narrow 7-5 loss to UCLA. The
• Cardinal met the Waves once this
season, managing to hold on for the
win despite a Pepperdine offensive
explosion late in the fourth quarter.
All things considered, the Car
dinal know they face two tough as
signments in the Bruins and the
Waves.
"It'll be a tough challenge, but if

we stick to our game plan we know
we'll be all right," Hindle-Katel
said.
Senior captain Peter Varellas of
fered a similar outlook on the re
mainder of the Cardinal's season.
"It's absolutely doable," he
said, in reference to the team's as
piration to reach NCAAs. "We
can clearly beat any team on any
given day — we need to bring our
A-game every time, but we defi
nitely have the talent and team
work to get it done."
The Cardinal take on the Bruins
at Avery Aquatic Center tomorrow
at 1:00 p. m. before facing Pepper
dine Sunday at noon.
In just over a month's time, the No. 3
men's water polo team will be invited to
participate in the NCAA Championship
tournament for the fifth consecutive year
— but only if all goes well in the mean
time. A strong performance at the MPSF
tournament during the last weekend of
November is essential to the squad's bid
to reach NCAAs.
Under the current four-team NCAA
tournament format, only two teams from
the MPSF are eligible for selection. To
earn that selection, the Cardinal (13-3,2-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
need to play at the top of their game
every time they jump in the pool during
the coming month.
This weekend presents Stanford with
the opportunity to see where it stands, as
the Cardinal host No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
Pepperdine tomorrow and Sunday, re
spectively.
First up for the Cardinal is defending
national champion UCLA (13-4, 1-0).
The Bruins feature a high-powered of
fense that receives contributions
throughout the lineup. Senior David

Pietsch has emerged as the team's pri
mary scoring threat, leading UCLA with
32 goals. The fact that nine other Bruins
already boast double-digit goal totals

serves as a testament to the squad's depth
and talent.
Things don't get any easier in the
other end of the pool, where the Cardinal

attackers have to deal with junior goalie
Will Didinger and a tough veteran core of
UCLA defensive players.
But none of that seems to matter to the
Cardinal, who have already knocked off
UCLA twice this season in tournament
games. The first victory came in dramatic
fashion at the SoCal Open when the Car
dinal walked away with the 10-9 sudden
death win after senior captain Thomas
Hopkins converted a penalty shot in the
third overtime period. In the teams' next
meeting, the Cardinal overcame a 4-1
deficit early in the second half and surged
back to capture the victory 6-5, taking third
place at the NorCal Open tournament.
Therefore, the Cardinal approach
their third showdown with their southern
California rivals with respect and confi
dence.
"Obviously [they] have a lot of really
talented guys, so we're going to focus on
playing team defense and double-team
ing when needed," said sophomore
Sandy Hohener, who anchors the Cardi
nal defense in goal. "We need to play with
intensity and keep pressuring the ball."
Freshman two-meter Will Hindle-
Katel, who ranks third on the Cardinal
with 27 goals, echoed the importance of
controlling the contest and allowing it to
develop in favor of Stanford's strengths.
"We've been watching a lot of tape, so
we know what they're going to be coming
with." Hindle-Katel said. "We really need
