# Stanford hopes for repeat at Pac-10 Championships
## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
The men's and women's cross country
squads have a chance to make history yet
again this weekend at the Pacific-10 Cham
pionships in TUcson, Ariz. The women have
won the championship for the past nine
years, while the men have captured the title
the last five years. Head coach Peter Tegen,
however, is more concerned with the pres
ent than with what has happened in the
past.
"We're just looking at the task at hand,"
he said. "With a championship race like
that, you do not want to underestimate any
one. A team that no one was talking about
could end up running great."
The men — currently ranked No. 4 in
the nation — are scheduled to face compe
tition from No. 7 Arizona and No. 24 Wash
ington.
It's definitely not going to be a cakewalk
for any of them, particularly on the men's
side "Tegen said. "There is tough competi
tion coming from Arizona. It's going to be
exciting."
The women,ranked No. 2 in the nation be
hind Duke, face their toughest competition
from No. 5 Arizona State. Yet, all of the rank
ings are virtually meaningless on race day,
when no team or runner has any advantage.
On the men's side, 10 runners plan to
travel to Arizona to compete for the Cardi
nal. Among those 10 is the team's only sen
ior, fifth-year David Vidal. Last year, Vidal
placed seventh overall at the Pac-10 Cham
pionship.
Junior Jacob Gomez, who finished sec
ond two weeks ago in the open race at the
Pre-NCAA meet, is scheduled to race again
at Pac-lOs this year, after finishing fourth
last year.

The 10 Cardinal men all have a chance at
the top five scoring positions, so the seven
potential scorers are not decided before the
race, as is practice at the NCAA Champi
onship race.
"Fortunately, at the Pac-10 it is a really
convenient situation for the coaches,"
Tegen said. "There is one less thing to worry
about. You put 10 runners on the line and
let them go the way they finish."
The 10 women include redshirt sopho
mores Arianna Lanibie and Teresa McWal
ters, who are coming off of third- and
fourth-place finishes, respectively, at the
Pre-NCAA meet two weeks ago in Terre
Haute, Ind.
Junior twins Katy and Amanda Trotter
both finished in the top 10 last year at the
Pac-10 Championships and look to lead
their teammates to another victory.
Several of the women have a chance to
win the individual Pac-10 title as well. Last
year, junior Amy Hastings of Arizona State
finished on top and looks to defend her title
on Saturday.
There is no doubt that the Cardinal
squads are well-prepared for the champi
onship race, but there is also a lot of pres
sure on the runners because of their past
success with this championship.
"We take the Pac-10 very seriously,"
Tegen said. "We have prepared very metic
ulously for this championship. They will
definitely be motivated and take everyone
very seriously — they will not underesti
mate anyone."
The men's race tomorrow is 8,000 me
ters, while the women's race is 6,000 meters.
The course at Arizona promises to be fast,
as it is fairly flat and includes steep, short
uphills and downhills.
"It will be very interesting," Tegen said.
"It is a highly contested championship."
