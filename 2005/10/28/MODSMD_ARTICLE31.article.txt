## An open letter to campus Cardinal football needs your support 
### Dear Stanford 
I am writing this letter in the best interest of our Stan
ford football team. In case you hadn't noticed (and judg
ing by the attendance, you haven't), we've managed to
win a game or two this year. In fact, we're coming danger
ously close to national attention. At 4-2, we only have to
win two of our last five games to be eligible fora bowl
this postseason.The last time this happened, I was in high
school.
Stanford has put together a few good wins in the early
going of the Pac-10 season and now we're down to
crunch time here on the Farm. Quality road wins over
Washington State and Arizona, combined with a fantas
tic offensive outpouring last week against an Arizona
State team that has been ranked as high as No. 9 this sea
son have given the Cardinal a 3-1 mark in conference,
good enough fora second-place tie behind USC and
UCLA. Hell, we're even ahead of that junior college
across the bay.
So here's where this letter is going. It's time for this
community to get back behind the football team and
show them the support they're earning. Forget the three
years of Buddy ball. Forget that hiccup against UC-Davis
earlier this season: Stanford football is on the rise again,
and I'm encouraging everyone to get on board before the
train gets going too fast.
Let's start with what we, as students, need to do. It's
not asking for much. It's a simple thing and it will really
go a long way to getting this team back to the elite status.
Four simple words:
GO TO THE GAMES
We've got an 80,000-person stadium, but it might as
well be a cave. The echoes in that place are monstrous.
We're drawing fewer people than high schools in west
Texas. Our team's doing a damn fine job right now, but
even superheroes need a hand every now and then.
How can we expect the team to keep performing if
we're showing them that we don't even care enough to
spend $8 for three quality hours of entertainment?
This brings me to my next point: 80,000 seats and
35,000 fans equals a half-empty stadium. And what does
our ridiculously endowed, creative and talented front of
fice do to fill the stadium? Charge students to watch the
team play! Brilliant! I could fit the entirety of Hoover
Tower in the section behind the end zone, and we're still
trying to squeeze $8 a head.
Front office: if you really care about the success of this
team and bringing back football as a popular sport here,
let the kids come and see the game. Our best attendance
of the year may have been against Davis when you hand
ed out free tickets, and that's before one quarter of the
undergraduate class even got back to campus. Loosen up
fellas! $8,000 is not going to make or break the budget
this year.
Finally, a message for the team itself. Guys, I'm a sen
ior. Like the rest of you true seniors on the team, I've
lived through three shameful seasons of Buddy Teevens.
Ever since I got here, I've prayed for just one good sea
son, one bowl game to go to and scream at and make a
complete ass of myself, all for the love of the team. It
looks like that opportunity is finally here.
Amazing what the right coach and a winning attitude
can do huh ? You guys have had the talent all along, and
it's coming together. In a tough Pac-10, you're becoming
respectable again, but the hardest part is still to come.
Critics are saying that from here on out, we'll lose all
our games. While it's true that four of the next five are
against ranked opponents — including a showdown with
the No. 2 (HA!) Trojans — we've got what it takes to
beat these teams. We nearly stuck it to USC last year. So
don't let the critics get to you.
This year marks the Cardinal's return to dominance.
I, for one, promise that if you make 6-5 and make the Toi
let Bowl this year, I'll be wherever it is screaming my ass
off, loving every minute of it.
