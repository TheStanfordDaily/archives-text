# Cardinal look
## for Pac-10 wins in last home tilts Women drop out of top-25 rankings, struggling to score in recent games 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After scoring only one point out of a possi
ble nine in the last three matches, Stanford
women's soccer (8-5-2,2-2-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) hopes fora revival this weekend at Mal
oney Field.
The Cardinal, who dropped out of the
NSCAA top-25 rankings this week, are sched
uled to face Southern California (9-4-2,3-1-1)
tonight at 7p.m. and No. 4 UCLA (14-1-1,4-0-
1) at lp.m on Sunday.
Stanford's five game win-streak ended two
weekends ago, after a loss against rival Califor
nia. Since then, the Cardinal have struggled to
return to their winning ways, managing a draw
against Arizona State before falling to Arizona
over the weekend. The pressure is on Stanford
as this weekend marks the penultimate week
end of conference play as well as the team's
final home matches of the season.
However, the Cardinal face tough competi
tion this weekend against USC, which ranks
fourth in the conference with 10 points. Al
though Stanford is currently 9-2-1 against the
TVojans and won last season's meeting 1-0,
USC's attack has been on form this season, and
the team is ranked second in the conference
with 2.07 goals per game.
In particular, Stanford's defense should
watch out for USC's strike force, made up of
freshman Amy Rodriguez and junior Rosa
