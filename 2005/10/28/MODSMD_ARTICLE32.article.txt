# Cardinal look
## for Pac-10 wins in last home tilts Women drop out of top-25 rankings, struggling to score in recent games 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After scoring only one point out of a possi
ble nine in the last three matches, Stanford
women's soccer (8-5-2,2-2-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) hopes fora revival this weekend at Mal
oney Field.
The Cardinal, who dropped out of the
NSCAA top-25 rankings this week, are sched
uled to face Southern California (9-4-2,3-1-1)
tonight at 7p.m. and No. 4 UCLA (14-1-1,4-0-
1) at lp.m on Sunday.
Stanford's five game win-streak ended two
weekends ago, after a loss against rival Califor
nia. Since then, the Cardinal have struggled to
return to their winning ways, managing a draw
against Arizona State before falling to Arizona
over the weekend. The pressure is on Stanford
as this weekend marks the penultimate week
end of conference play as well as the team's
final home matches of the season.
However, the Cardinal face tough competi
tion this weekend against USC, which ranks
fourth in the conference with 10 points. Al
though Stanford is currently 9-2-1 against the
TVojans and won last season's meeting 1-0,
USC's attack has been on form this season, and
the team is ranked second in the conference
with 2.07 goals per game.
In particular, Stanford's defense should
watch out for USC's strike force, made up of
freshman Amy Rodriguez and junior Rosa

Sunday's match up against Pac-10
favorite UCLA could possibly be
Stanford's toughest contest this sea
son. UCLA is currently tied for first
in the conference with California,
with 13 points each.The Bruins'per
fect Pac-10 record, as well as their 10
match win-streak, ended last week
end after a surprising scoreless tie
against Washington State weekend.
However, UCLA should be de
termined to score victories this
weekend in order to oust Cal from
their shared position at the top in
hope of capturing what would be
their third consecutive Pac-10 title.
UCLA currently holds the ad
vantage 6-5-2 over Stanford while
the Cardinal's last triumph against
the Bruins was a 1-0 victory during
the 2002 season. UCLA's defense
poses one significant challenge, as

the team has recorded a total of 11
shutouts this season.
The Cardinal's concerns for this
weekend, however, do not end with
UCLA's rock-solid defense. There
has been much speculation over
freshman Alex Gamble's ability to
play after the goalie sat out last
weekend due to injury. Gamble has
made a significant impact in her
rookie season, recording a total of
six shutouts. If unfit to play this
weekend, she will be replaced by
sophomore Erica Holland, who
picked up her first career shutout
against Arizona State.
Despite the results of the last few
matches, Stanford head coach Paui
Ratcliffe has been fairly satisfied
with the performance of what is a
relatively young team and has only a
few concerns about finishing.
"The defense has played well,"
Ratcliffe said. "We have two fresh
men back there and they played
against some strong players and they
held them. [But] our speed of play
has got to be a little faster, and we
still have to work on finishing. We're
creating a lot of chances but we need
to finish them."
