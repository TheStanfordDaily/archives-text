## Heated Cal rivalry picks up in women's final home stand 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After taking a week off from reg
ular games and actually seeing
friendly smiles on the other side of
the ball, the Stanford field hockey
team takes to its Varsity Field Hock
ey TUrf one final time before gearing
up for the postseason.
The women (5-11, 3-2 Northern
Pacific Conference) look to finish
their regular season on a positive
note against archrival California (9-
7, 4-1) tomorrow and against Rad
ford (6-10,3-1) on Monday.
The Cardinal had last weekend
off from the season and instead saw
familiar faces: alumni Justina
Williams ('99), Sara Sanders ('94),
Emily Zander ('O4), Liz Ott ('O2),
Melissa Stai ('01), Noor Dawood
( l 04) and Kat TTiomas ('B9) played in
the annual Alumni game.
The squad has gotten back into
rival mode, however, and is ready
give Cal another challenge. The Car
dinal faced the Bears once this sea
son in a tight match, but fell 1-0 on
Sept. 17 at Cal.
Junior forward Liz Robinson led
the Cardinal offense in that game,
taking two of three shots while fresh
man midfielder/forward Caroline
Hussey took the other shot.
Cal outshot the Cardinal in that
game 9-3 with junior forward Valenti
na Godfrid taking four shots. But it
was Cal freshman forward Andrea
Lo who finally broke the scoreless tie.

In the 65th minute of the game, Lo
scored off of a penalty corner to win
the game. Tomorrow, the Cardinal
should keep an eye out on both.
"We know a lot about each
other," head coach Lesley Irvine
said. "We've learned a lot since then.
We'll build on what we did well."
Godfrid currently leads the Nor-
Pac conference with 55 points. She
holds the Cal single season record,
scoring 54 points in the 2004 season
and ranks fourth in career standings.
The Cardinal came out on top fac
ing when they last faced Radford
during the 2004 season. The High
landers were overtaken 1-0 in over
time, and Stanford hopes to improve
its performance this year.
"It's senior day when we play
Radford," Irvine said. "They're a
strong team. They're very scrappy
and have had a successful year so far
within their conference."
Hussey leads the Cardinal offense
with six goals, one assist and 36 shots
with sophomore Jess Zutz in second
place with five goals and 34 shots.
The squad hopes to garner sup
port for the upcoming game against
Cal, continuing in the tradition of
"Big Games."
"This is our biggest game of the
year," freshman goalkeeper Sarah
Scheller said. "It's going to be really
close. It would be great if a lot of stu
dents showed up and showed some
school spirit."
