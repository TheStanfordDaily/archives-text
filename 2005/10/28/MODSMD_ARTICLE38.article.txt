## Why, oh why, 'Zorro,' was one not enough? 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION SWASHBUCKLER 
One of the few redeeming qualities of
"The Legend of Zorro," an altogether un
necessary and obnoxious sequel to 1998's
thoroughly enjoyable "The Mask of
Zorro" is the supporting role played by
Catherine Zeta-Jones' cleavage. Unfortu
nately, even this rather pleasant sight fails
to distract viewers from a plot so far off the
deep end that even an acid tripper's sus
pension of disbelief would be tested.
Antonio Banderas again wears the
mask as the swashbuckling Zorro with
all of the bravado his sexy Latin accent
can carry. Unfortunately, any sense of
vengeance, regret or inner longing Ban
deras showed as Zorro's alter ego, Ale
jandro de la Vego, in the first film is ab
sent here. For her part, Zeta-Jones as his
wife, Elena, almost manages to look
good enough in out-of-place low cut
dresses to make allowable her uncon
vincing attempt at a Latina accent.
The only explanation I can offer fora
plot that crosses the line into ridiculous
ness and stays there is that director Mar
tin Campbell is already preparing for his
return to the James Bond franchise with
next year's "Casino Royale." After
Zorro single-handedly saves the drive for
California statehood with a stealthy bat
tle over a ballot box, he returns to his ha
cienda only to receive the boot from the
Mrs. for reneging on his promise to give
up the mask and devote his life to raising
his son.
In his absence, Elena gets herself
caught up with Armand (Rufas Sewell), a
nefarious French fellow purporting to be
a chivalrous nobleman, but who is covert
ly heading an international organization
hell-beat on destroying the United States.
The plan is for the conspirators to develop
a weapon of mass destruction for the Con

army so they can defeat those rascally North
erners in the imminent Civil War. Says
Zorro, with exceptional understatement:
"America—they want to destroy it?"
And if the Bondian plot were not
enough, the filmmakers decided to make
"The Legend of Zorro" kid-friendly
enough to rationalize its PG rating (the
first movie was PG-13). The sequel man
ages to successfully skew younger with an
overdose of screen time devoted to both
Joaquin, Alejandro and Elena's ram
bunctious to 10-year-old son, and Zorro's
slapstick-loving horse, Tornado. At more
than two hours of runtime, kiddie humor
gets real old real fast.
That being said, "The Legend of
Zorro" has some sporadic moments of
well-delivered popcorn entertainment.
The opening and closing fight scenes are
fun and adventurous, but perhaps this is
due simply to the pleasure of seeing live
action stunts after a summer movie season
completely reliant upon computer graph
ics. Regardless, there is some fun action to
be found here and there.
However, "Zorro: Episode II: Zorro
Goes James Bond On A French Guy,"
like Terri Schiavo, is just too far gone to
save. In truth, this is a rather sad devel
opment fora sequel to a well-crafted and
entertaining flick. "The Legend of
Zorro" makes me yearn for the days
when Anthony Hopkins was wearing the
tight black pants. And that's saying
something.
