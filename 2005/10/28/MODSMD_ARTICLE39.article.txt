■Downey is an adept narrator, though
at times overly self-conscious. At times
h lUwney admits that he should shut up
and get on with the story, and I often
agreed with him. He criticizes his own
storytelling and stops the film between
frames at one point to ask, "Why is this
fcene here? You think it'll come back
later?" On the whole, though, his self
deprecating narration is humorous, and
I his performance as Harry comes off as

j|- of the film. "You got a problem with

around here? I didn't think so."
The movie follows Harry from New T
York to Los Angeles, where here- J,
searches the acting part he accidentally \
tried out for by riding along with detec

name is the obvious and repeated butt of
jokes. After witnessing a murder, Harry
and Gay get wrapped up in a

and that of the first (unrequited) love of
Harry's life. Harmony (the 1 transfixing
Michelle Monaghan), in an admittedly
unlikely turn of events. It also reveals
the sinister aspect of Hollywood's shiny?
faqade in a surprisingly original way,
partly because we see itjtlirough Harry's
eyes.
After Harmony's sister dies under
mysterious circumstances, she enlists
Harry — who lies when she asks if he's a
detective — to

"How about it, filmgoers?" H Jrrv asks
near the end of the film. "Have you fig

I hadn't, but that wasn't the impor

draw you into its twists and turns. What
I couldn't figure out was how Black suc
ceeded in making me laugh when the
bad guys are shocking Downey's., well,
the part of his body where he would least
like to be shocked, and cry when...oh.
Right. I guess you'll just have to see the
