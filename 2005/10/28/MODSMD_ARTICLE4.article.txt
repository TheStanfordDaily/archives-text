# Cardinal face uphill battle in No. 8 UCLA
## Bruins roll into Stanford with seven straight wins 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
When undefeated No. 8 UCLA visits Stanford
(7-0,4-0 Pacific 10Conference) tomorrow, the con
test could mark the largest game of head coach
Walt Harris' nine-month tenure on the Farm and
could arguably represent the Cardinal's most im
portant football game since former head coach Ty
rone Willingham's departure three-plus seasons
ago.
"It's time to get ready for the eighth-ranked
UCLA football team that is undefeated and obvi
ously very talented," Harris said. "We know it's
going to be a real battle; they have some very fine
football players and an excellent scheme that puts
a lot of pressure on you."
The Bruins (4-2, 3-1) enter the contest with a
perfect record and as eight-point favorites because
of an explosive offense that averages 44.4 points
per game, fifth in the country. However, not only
can the UCLA offense score in bunches — top
ping 40 points in all but one tilt this season — but
the unit can produce with games on the line.
UCLA rallied for come-from-behind fourth quar
ter victories in three of its last four contests.
"Their numbers are outstanding," fifth-year
senior defensive tackle Babatunde Oshinowo said.
"It's amazing the success that they've had this sea
son so far. When you go into a game like this, you
do your best to prepare for everything they've
g0t...1t will be a tremendous challenge for us."
The Bruins sport a pair of Olsons at quarter
back. Freshman Ben Olson was expected to see
significant playing time this season, but the phe
nomenal play of senior Drew Olson (no relation)
has all but eliminated that possibility. Through
seven games. Drew Olson has completed over 67
percent of his passes for 1,868 yards and 21 touch
downs, but perhaps most impressive is how infre
quently the senior makes a poor decision, as only
three of Olson's 222 throws this season have been
intercepted. Olson's success is all the more re
markable considering that the Bruins do not have
a standout receiver — tight end Mercedes Lewis
actually leads the squad with 433 receiving yards.
While the Bruins have one of the Pac-10's
weaker groups of wideouts, their tailback may be
the best in a conference that includes IJSC's Reg
gie Bush and LenDale White, Washington State's
