# Cardinal face uphill battle in No. 8 UCLA
## Bruins roll into Stanford with seven straight wins 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
When undefeated No. 8 UCLA visits Stanford
(7-0,4-0 Pacific 10Conference) tomorrow, the con
test could mark the largest game of head coach
Walt Harris' nine-month tenure on the Farm and
could arguably represent the Cardinal's most im
portant football game since former head coach Ty
rone Willingham's departure three-plus seasons
ago.
"It's time to get ready for the eighth-ranked
UCLA football team that is undefeated and obvi
ously very talented," Harris said. "We know it's
going to be a real battle; they have some very fine
football players and an excellent scheme that puts
a lot of pressure on you."
The Bruins (4-2, 3-1) enter the contest with a
perfect record and as eight-point favorites because
of an explosive offense that averages 44.4 points
per game, fifth in the country. However, not only
can the UCLA offense score in bunches — top
ping 40 points in all but one tilt this season — but
the unit can produce with games on the line.
UCLA rallied for come-from-behind fourth quar
ter victories in three of its last four contests.
"Their numbers are outstanding," fifth-year
senior defensive tackle Babatunde Oshinowo said.
"It's amazing the success that they've had this sea
son so far. When you go into a game like this, you
do your best to prepare for everything they've
g0t...1t will be a tremendous challenge for us."
The Bruins sport a pair of Olsons at quarter
back. Freshman Ben Olson was expected to see
significant playing time this season, but the phe
nomenal play of senior Drew Olson (no relation)
has all but eliminated that possibility. Through
seven games. Drew Olson has completed over 67
percent of his passes for 1,868 yards and 21 touch
downs, but perhaps most impressive is how infre
quently the senior makes a poor decision, as only
three of Olson's 222 throws this season have been
intercepted. Olson's success is all the more re
markable considering that the Bruins do not have
a standout receiver — tight end Mercedes Lewis
actually leads the squad with 433 receiving yards.
While the Bruins have one of the Pac-10's
weaker groups of wideouts, their tailback may be
the best in a conference that includes IJSC's Reg
gie Bush and LenDale White, Washington State's
Turnovers a

key for home victory

Jerome Harrison and California's
Marshawn Lynch. Junior Maurice
Drew is having an All-American cal
iber season, rushing for 5.2 yards per
carry en route to 605 yards and nine
touchdowns on the ground. Perhaps
Drew's biggest strength is his versa
tility, though, as he has notched an
additional seven touchdowns as a
wide receiver and a punt returner.
"He's extremely well-built with
tremendous speed," Harris said.
"You can't tackle him — you just
bounce off of him. Our challenge on
defense is to tackle well. We struggle
against good teams in the area of
tackling. We need to show tremen
dous improvement if we are going to
slow him down."
Harris added that Stanford's
game plan leans heavily upon the
front seven — both to plug Drew's
running holes and to attempt to rat
tle Olson.
"We have to make sure that Mau
rice Drew doesn't dominate the
game," Harris said. "Then we have to
put them in down and distances that
we feel confident they will throw the
ball-
Stanford faces a weak Bruin de
fensive front that has hemorrhaged
ground yards to opposing backs. The
Bruins allow nearly 223 rushing
yards per game, ranking 113 th
among 117 Division I-A teams.

Stanford, on the other hand, has
110 ground yards and the ground
game has been in such disarray lately
that four weeks have elapsed since a
tailback led the team in rushing. Fur
thermore, starting running back An
thony Kimble injured his right leg in
last week's victory over Arizona
State, and the redshirt freshman is
listed as questionable for this Satur
day's contest.
Harris tinkered with his offense
following the losses to UC-Davis and
Oregon, replacing high-risk down
field throws with safer, shorter
routes. Since this adjustment to the
playbook, junior quarterback Trent
Edwards has completed 66.7 percent
of his passes with 10 touchdowns and
no interceptions over the last three
games.
The Cardinal offense's ability to
succeed aerially for the fourth
straight week should prove key
against the Bruins, especially consid
ering Stanford's difficulties rushing
the ball.
Turnovers could also factor highly
tomorrow. Stanford has committed
no turnovers over their three-game
win streak, and now ranks eighth na
tionally in both fewest turnovers
committed and overall turnover
margin. UCLA ranks fourth in both
categories, so strength is set to meet
strength on the gridiron.
