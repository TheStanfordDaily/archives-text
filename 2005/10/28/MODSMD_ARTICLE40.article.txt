## New Depeche Mode record is worth the four-year wait 
### DANNY NEIL INTERMISSION MODE-MAN 
From the distorted air-raid siren introduction
in"A Pain That I'm Used To" to the fading death
of "The Darkest Star," "Playing the Angel" is
classic Depeche Mode. Also classic Depeche
Mode was the standard four-year wait after their
previous lackluster album "Exciter." The band,
despite being nearly 25 years old, is able to deliv
er a new album of remarkable quality. This re
lease, while clocking in fora rather short 53 min
utes, is compromised of surprisingly solid songs.
The album maintains its '80s-era New Roman
tic sound (think Goth), with lyrics confined to
that emotional spectrum. Note the range in their
songs, from the melancholy tone of their lyrics,
like "Frozen heart, an empty space... Please don't
speak, you'll only lie," and the, well, happily sung
"I just hang on, [and] suffer well." Is it not, per
haps, a coincidence that this album was released
so close to Halloween?
The solid songwriting, musical variation and su
perb production values bring to life a possibly
pedestrian album. Integrating Ben Hiltier's pro
duction (of U2, Blur and Hie Doves fame) raises
this album above the norm. All the sound recording
is high-quality, with those martial, thumping beats
and atmospheric, swirling distortions planting you
deeply into Depeche Mode's haunted soundscape.
And despite their dramatic, brooding sound, De
peche Mode manages to successfully balance their
songs, preventing the dour tones from becoming
overbearing or intensely repetitive^!
Highlights from this the previ
ously leaked "Precious," the pounding "A Pain
I'm Used To," the exuberant and catchy (but
don't worry — still dark) "John tip.' Revelator,"
and musically complex "Macro?" While the
bands releases an coltain an element of '80s dis-

their unpenetrable
origins by acquiring modern harmonies and using
moaernelectromc instrumentation. The ping
pong blipping, high-pitched clifjang, and •

rough distortion of the distant far
more accessible in their
fined counterparts. DepedpH

hain t sold out their rough tones,
burratner how to suc
cessfully integrate it with harmon
ic vocals to create a pleasant and
unified sound.
Furthermore, the layering of
that unified sound is surprisingly
deep. The music is full, but does
not seem overloaded: yet decon
structing the beat into separate in
struments and samples, as the
band sometimes does for effect,
reveals the true complexity of
even their sparser rhythms, keep
ing the music fresh.
Singer David Gahan similarly

his technique noticeably, anil the confidence
shows in songs like "Macro;" he crunches dark syl
lables staccato but can still draw out emotional
line endings with extended sustains. His subtle
syntactical games add significant replay value to
the album, too. In "1 Want It All." Gahan's long
pause between "sometimes I tic" and "with you"
adds nuance and meaning to the otherwise cliched
lyrical themes.
Depeche Mode fans will love this album, and
newcomers will.Juul something enjoyable. That
