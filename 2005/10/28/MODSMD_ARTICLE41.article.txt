# At least the world will end before your iPod battery does, right?

### SEAN HOWELL INTERMISSION NOSTRADAMUS 
Worst-Case Scenario: The world is ending in 45 minutes. That gives you 16 songs to listen to
before the Earth opens up and you are sucked down into the fiery depths. What are you going
to put on your iPod playlist? Here are a few suggestions.
1. "It's the End of the World as We Know It" by REM. It's a good idea to get things start
ed with a more lighthearted song about the apocalypse. The "as we know it" part provides
some hope. Plus, it's still amazing that the guy who did "Everybody Hurts" can sing that fast.
2. "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones. Okay, it's not really about the devil, but
it's a good idea to start ingratiating yourself with him, if that's where you're headed.
3. "Jesus, Etc."by Wilco. Then again, it's not a bad idea to get on His good side, either. Even
Jesus would think this song was catchy, and he had the psalms. The 'etc.' part covers the en
tire Trinity.
4. "Tomorrow Never Knows" by the Beatles. Just to get the whole Eastern perspective in
there.
5. "Hollaback Girl" by Gwen Stefani. You might not care what a 'Hollaback Girl' is now,
but it will give you something to contemplate for the rest of eternity.
6. "Over and Done With " by the Proclaimers. Sometimes, you just need to know when to
walk away.
7. "Stayin' Alive"by the Bee Gees. In case you're not ready to give up yet.
8. "Dancing Queen"by ABBA â€” oh, wait, sorry. You don't need anything by ABBA.
9. Sloop John B" by the Beach Boys. You are going to want to hear a slice of the most
melodic album ever made before going t0...
10. "The Great Gig in the Sky" by Pink Floyd. Which apparently sounds like a female voice
moaning.
11. "The End"by the Doors. That's more like it. A good, manly death.
12. "Fire and Rain" by James Taylor. His plaintive voice will give you a new perspective
on the whole suffering thing.
13. "Everybody Dies" by Rilo Kiley. The apocalypse version of "Everybody Poops."
13. "Hey Mr. Tambourine Man" by Bob Dylan. The song that played when Hunter S.
Thompson's ashes were shot out of a 153-foot-tall Gonzo tower. If it's good enough for
Hunter, it's good enough for the rest of us.
15. "Oh Well, Okay" by Elliott Smith. Giving up never sounded so good.
/6. "The Man Comes Around." Because if anyone is going to tell you what the apocalypse
is going to be like, it had better be Johnny Cas'h.
