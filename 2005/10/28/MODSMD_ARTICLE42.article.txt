### LOREN NEWMAN INTERMISSION STUD 
Throughout history, the inhabitants of the world have tried
[ doing a number of things, from getting rich to killing the commies.
| Unfortunately, or fortunately, they, failed for whatever reason.
J' Intermission has some advice, however belated, for these worst
s' case scenarios throughout history:
Over the course of the past several hundred years, a few choice
nut-bags decided that they would like to have people sing the
* song "He's got the whole world in his hands" to them and really
mean it. From Napoleon to Hitler, empires rose and fell, yet none
achieved the ultimate goal: world domination. Intermission has
. some words of advice for these would be universal mac-daddies.
.. Who knows, armed with this knowledge, maybe you could take
the plunge. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it: "Supreme and Ulti
mate Ruler of the Entire World." You could at least find a date.

In recent months, George W. Bush's approval ratings have
dropped below 40 percent. These numbers are surprisingly simi
lar to those of another president, one named Dick, just before he
was impeached. But don't worry George, fire Dick, fire Condi,
because Intermission is here with the worst of the worst-case sce
narios, in large print and simplified vocabulary.
How To Disguise the Fact That You Are The Worst
President in History:
1. Say, "It's because of 9/11 "s Repeat as necessary. Using a
national disaster as an excuse for anything from an abysmal
economy to high oil prices is the way to go.

2. Start a war. Who wants to
Jiss on a president who arbi
trarily uses 'shock and awe
tactics' to silence his dissi-

dents.
3. If that doesn't work, start
another one. Because two is
always better than one, espe
cially when billions of dollars
are involved.
4. Attempt to amend the
Constitution. Actually, leav
ing a permanent stain of your

presidency on the framework
of the country would just make

matters worse. Don't do that.
