### EMILY HITE MARTINE CICCONI INTERMISSION DANCERS 
This summer, the creators of 'American
Idol" brought America the power to choose its
most versatile dancer. Hopefuls auditioned in
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and
competition was fierce. Dancers from all back
grounds were required to learn routines from
styles as diverse as ballroom, hip-hop and jive,
and to work with new partners and choreogra
phers every week as well as create their own
solos. After weeks of call-in voting, America
chose the Bay Area's own Nick Lazzarini as its
winner.
We were fortunate to connect with Nicks
mom. Holly, who invited us to Nick's congrat
ulations and 21st birthday party. Top Four fi
nalist Melody Lacayanga, Nick's longtime
friend, camc to celebrate. We stepped out of
the "circus" of the banquet room to catch up
with Nick and Melody.

INTERMISSION: So you're both locals'.'.
NICK LAZZARINI: Yes, I'm from Sunnyvale
and Melody's from Daly City.
INT: What was your early training like around
here?
NL: I did everything—-ballet, tap, jazz: and
gymnastics since age four, and later started lyri
cal and hip-hop.
MELODY! LACAYANGA: 1 started taking
tap and refused to take ballet until I was 12.
Then I started taking it because I realized I
wanted to do every kind of dance. But then I
quit tap.
NL: I quit tap because it hurt my feet.
INT: When did you move to L.A. and where
did you train there?
NL: I was 19 and Melody was 20. We moved
into an apartment together with another girl
from our studio and trained at the EDGE in
Hollywood.
INT: Why L.A. instead of New York?
NL: I wanted to move to New York eventual
ly, but go to L.A. first because it's closer to

home: I had connections with some choreogra
phers, and it was more edgy and commercial
than the concert dance I had experienced in
Northern Califortiia. When I was taking class at
the EDGE, Nigel [Lythgoe, one of the show s
producers and judges]'s wife Bonnie came in to
make an announcement. Some of us were
pulled out of class and invited to a private audi
tion.
INT: How was the whole experience, from first
audition to final decision? Melody, we know
you had your share of challenging partnering
situations.
ML [mak ing a wave motion with her hand]: Hp
and down. I was a deranged mess fora few
weeks. It was so hard having to keep picking
new partners and new styles. I tried not to show
my frustration.
INT: What was the most frustrating aspect of
show?
ML and NL: Our biggest complaint was that
since there was so much emphasis on partner
ing and dancing together, why weren't there

two winners? A partnership should have won.
INT: You're damn right. Was it hard to watch
other contestants get eliminated?
NL: It was and it wasn't. Some people you get
close to, others you don't.
INT: cough B LAKFxough
INT: Did you get to live at home, or did they
lock you up?
NL: They put us in apartments near the studio
where the show Was filmed. We weren't al
lowed to have cars, and we technically weren't
allowed visitors. I was roommates with Blake
[McGrathj, which was horrible. You can read
about it in "US Weekly" — I didn't say any
thing that wasn't true. We have known each
other since we were 12 or 13.
INT: Longtime rivals. Were you surprised
when Blake was eliminated? Were you disap
pointed to not be able to do the dance-off that
Nigel had foreshadowed?
