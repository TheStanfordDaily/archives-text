# How to Hook-Up with Your Dormmates Without Saying I Do
## 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ INTERMISSION GIRL. NEXT DOOR 
So you woke up next to the hottie who lives down the hall.
Good for you. However, perhaps Mr. Hottie isn't nearly as hot
by the light of day, or maybe he snores worse than your dog. Or

he just didn't measure up in
bed. In any case, surviving
dormcest can be quite a
handful for those not used
to it. So, what do you do to
make this terrible situation
go away?
If this is your first time
hooking up with him, then
there's a very simple thing
you can do. First, check if he
is still sleeping. If he is, you
can take this opportunity to
sneak out of the room and
pretend like nothing ever
happened. If he wakes up,
proceed to step two.
2. Mumble something about

being way drunk the previous night. Then you can say some
thing like "I'm so sorry! I'm going to leave." And then bolt be
fore he gets a chance to respond. However, if you actually like
the guy and want to pursue things, then as you're leaving (yes,
you do have to leave!), you might say something like "1 had a
good time last night. We should do it again." Remember to
keep it casual, though — you don't want to scare the poor boy.
3. If this is not your first time hooking up with him, but you feel
the urge to pursue other options, then leaving at 5 a.m. is not
going to help your case. Instead, you can try a number of things,

the first being to stop hooking up with him. Instead, find other
guys that you're interested in and go on actual dates with them
(just because people at Stanford don't date doesn't mean you
shouldn't — hey, you might start a trend). Hopefully he'll get
the picture and realize that you're not looking for marriage, but
want to have fun.

4. If he doesn't get it and throws a jealous
fit, then you're going to have to sit him
down and treat him like the good little
puppy — 1 mean guy —he is. Tell him
straight up: "Look, 1 like you and all, but 1
never said we should be exclusive, and 1
want to date other people as well." If he
gets pissed and doesn't like it, then you
might just have to let this one go, but be
careful because he does live in the same
dorm, so whatever you do, if things get
messy, you're still stuck seeing him every
day. If you do break up with him, you
might want to give him a cooling-off peri
od before trying to be his friend again.
5. If you actually are in a relationship with
this guy, and you want it to be exclusive
but are worried about the marriage trap.

then just go on actual dates and other so
cial outings with him. For one thing, it'll keep you two on other
people's radar in case things don't work out, and it'll definitely
add some spice to your love life.
Hopefully this list will help you to keep things fun instead of
awkward. Remember, this is college. People are experimenting
and are basically out to have a good time. So whether your
dormcest situation was a good or bad thing, there's no reason it
has to ruin your living situation. Plus, having a booty call right
down the hall is not such a bad thing. Think about it.


The five feet to his door is the shortest walk of shame ever.
