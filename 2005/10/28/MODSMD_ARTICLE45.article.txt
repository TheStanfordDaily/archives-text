# How to Avoid Being Mauled at Full Moon on the Quad

1. Stay sober. The best way to avoid unwanted contact is to
keep your wits about you. If such a plan is unfeasible, try to
stay as sober as possible.
2. Go with a group of friends. There's safety in numbers, and if
necessary you can hoist the offending person off on one of
them. (See number 11)
3. Avoid eye contact. The eyes are the windows to the soul, so
making eye contact with someone is giving him or her a look
into your deepest recesses. You do not want to do this. Con
centrate on MemChu, the sky, or some indeterminate point on
the horizon. You could also give the appearance of constantly
scanning the crowd for someone in particular, but in that case
you risk accidental eye contact.
4. Avoid sketchy people. The following are to be avoided at all
costs:
a. Grad students or balding men
b. Anyone with cold sores (herpes)
c. Drunk people, especially those being supported by friends
d. The Tree
5. Maintain closed body language. If you stop moving, keep
your arms crossed and your back to crowds.
6. Ignore taps on the back, hand grabs, etc. Shrug them off â€”

they are the calling card of someone who a) does not know
your name and b) has already violated your personal space.
7. Ignore and walk away. Should preventative measures fail,
the most direct method is to simply pretend like you did not
hear someone ask you. Most people's dignity will keep them
from pursuing you.
8. Claim to be a sophomore. If you cannot avoid conversation,
claim to be a sophomore or junior.
9. Claim to have mono. If he or she persists, claim to have some
kind of communicable disease.
10. Offer a kiss on the check. If you are in such a situation that
extrication is difficult, insist on kissing only on the cheek. This
has the double benefit of minimizing exposure while usually
satisfying the offending person. Note: Keep in control by kiss
ing him or her on the check rather than vice versa. If necessary,
hold his or her head in your hands to keep him or her from
moving it.
11. If all else fails, hoist the offending person on one of your
friends. Definitely a last resort. While avoiding harm person
ally, you could do irreparable damage to your friendship.
Weigh the sketchings of the person and the sobriety of your
friend. The sketchier the suitor and the more sober your friend
is, the more likely he or she will be to remember and blame
you.
