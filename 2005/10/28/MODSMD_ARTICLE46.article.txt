# How to Survive Going to the CoHo Alone
## 
### SETH SHAMBAN INTERMISSIONER WHO ISN’T ACTUALLY LONELY 
It happens to the best of us. That 10 p.m. caffeine fix can only be found
at the CoHo, but no one else needs to go that far in the cold. Don't worrv

though, there are a few easy
things that you can do to survive
going to the CoHo alone:
1. Reaching for your cell phone
is a natural response to feeling
alone, but you shouldn't start
dialing all of your old high
school friends while waiting for
your grande decaf vanilla chai.
If a phone call should ease the
pain, start your conversation
before you walk through the
door. Otherwise, you'll feel des
perately alone as you enter and
wait in line to place your order.
2. Sometimes that cell phone
happens to not have any life-

left in it, or, if you don't have Cingular, you simply can't make or receive
calls from your phone. In such an emergency, look, for the nearest news
paper. It doesn't matter if it's The Daily — it's something to keep you
company.
3. Don't order a crepe! Waiting fora crepe might just be the loneliest five
to 10 minutes Stanford has to offer, and if you must devour your crepe
immediately, don't cat inside. Sure, it's nice and warm inside, but the out
doors offer a comforting solemnity, the silence of a dark campus that
elicits reflection and contentment rather than loneliness.
4. Breathe. Look back to winter quarter when you took yoga and learned
all about relaxing. Learn to relax, yo! There arc worse things in this world
than going to the CoHo alone; you could be going to the Treehouse.
5. If none of these techniques works for you. 1 strongly suggest not going
at all. As my upstairs neighbor just reminded me, going to the CoHo
alone is depressing, and you're probably better off tired than awake and
sad. Trust me. I went alone last night, and 1 still feel like crying.
