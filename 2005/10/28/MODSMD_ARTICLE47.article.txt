# How To Not Wear the Same Designer Jeans and Boob-Revealing Top as Every Other Freshman at a Frat Party
## 
### RACHEL TORRES INTERMISSIONS JOAN RIVERS 
1. Get some inspiration to develop your
own aesthetic. Pick a decade, people
watch-on University Ave., scope out the
style of the non-coked-out celebs in
"People," or "Us Weekly" (that means
NO Olsen twins, Lindsay Lohan or Jes
sica Simpson). It's as important to know
what you don't like to wear as much as
what you do like to

wear.
2. Go to Savers. Snap
up anything Levi's, any
hats (the more ridicu
lous the better), any
cheesy costume jewel
ry, anything that looks
like an awesome, crazy
grandma would wear it.
Make sure stuff fits ap
proximately well; oth
erwise, you'll look like
an awesome, crazy and
homeless grandma.
3. Accessorize by knit
ting your own chunky
or skinny scarf. Go to
learntoknit.com or find
a knitting circle on
campus. Knitting for
the first time will take

you an absurdly long time, but just think
how smugly satisfied and warm you'll be
when people ask where you got your
scarf.
4. Distress your own jeans. Get some
cheap jeans from Goodwill or Savers.
Take some sand paper or even a pumice

stone for your feet, and sand down the
tops of the thighs, or around the butt of
the jeans. You can also mix about one
teaspoon of bleach with a cup-and-a-half
of water, take an old toothbrush and
bleach crease lines around the hips and
around the knees of your jeans.
5. Advanced DIY directions: Make your
own stencil. First, print out a black and
white picture with high contrast of your
favorite rock icon or political figure.

Outline the dark parts
with marker, and then
use self-laminating
paper to laminate the
photo. (Or you can
bribe your RA with sex,
drugs, money or baked
goods to do this for you
in the RA workroom).
Use an Xacto knife to
cut out all the dark
parts. Then lay the sten
cil over jeans or a hood
ie, and use spray-on fab
ric paint to imprint Janis
Joplin or Bill Clinton
onto the haunches of
your jeans or on the
back of your hoodie.
6. If all else fails in your
quest fora unique
wardrobe, stick with

what you know best, even if it is Seven
Jeans and an Express tube top with a
Coach wristlet. Just make sure to get
stuff cheaper by combing Ebay or
Craigslist so you don't have to fork over
too much money to the snobby sales
people at the Stanford Shopping Center.


Make your own jeans. They will
probably look better than this.
