# How To Avoid Getting Felt Up at a Frat Party
## Welcome to HA E 
### MACKENZIE COOPER INTERMISSION PARTY FREQUENTER 
1. Never venture onto the dance floor alone. Always
bring at least one other person — a wingman. Your fe-

male friend will do just fine, but bringing a
boy can't hurt. Burly guy friends are aces at
this job. Or, bring your gay best friend —
this is what they're for!
2. Once you're on the dance floor, don't let
anyone you don't know within

two feet of you. But really,
don't be shy to dance with
people you don't know. Just
have a code with your friends.
Nonverbal codes are usually
more discreet — the ever
popular sly ear-tug works
wonders.
3. Beware of the overly
handsy drunk frat boy. His
hand didn't just "land" there.
It was a calculated move.
4. If you think he's cute
tonight, but your friends arc
telling you no, listen to them.
They're probably right, and
you don't want the latest in
side joke to be about how yo-i
got trashed and hooked up
with that gross guy on the
SAE dance floor.
5. When it comes to clothing,
bundle up. Wear a parka. Or

those big workman overalls. Okay, don't go overboard,
but let's be honest: too-short skirts paired with too-tight,
too-low tops beg fora groping. Plus, they're just tacky.

6. Invest in a mace necklace. Think about it: it's only a
good deterrent if they can see it. Enter: the mace neck
lace, ingenious.
7. If you're wondering whether you really need that
third cup of jungle juice, and the

'bartender' tells you to drink it,
don't listen to him. That adage
about alcohol leading to impaired
judgment is actually true.
8. Don't go in the VIP room with
someone you don't

know. And no, meet
ing him five minutes
ago does not constitute
a trustworthy friend
ship. Fifteen minutes,
minimum.
9. Make yourself ugly
by wearing clown
makeup. It couldn't
hurt, right?
10. If all else fails, go
around singing Back
street Boys at the top
of your lungs. If that
doesn't scare boys
away...
11. Whatever you do,
do NOT yell at the top
of your lungs how
drunk you are. Bad
idea.
12. If, for some unfore
seen reason, you get

separated from your friends, don't follow your new frat
boy friend down to his room "fora little while — just to
chill." And don't walk home alone. Call 5-SURE.


How could he have known she was drinking magma, whose
average temp, is 6,745 .6 degrees. Now his pants are too.
