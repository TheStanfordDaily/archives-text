1. Remain calm. Panicking will only make the situation
worse and render you less likely to make the proper
subsequent decisions to cope with what just happened.
2. Take several deep breaths. If you arc listening to a
portable music player or have one handy, consider cue
ing up "My Bloody Valentine" while zoning out fora
bit — although this might be a bad idea if you are in
deed literally bloody.
3. Attempt to ascertain whether or not you are intoxi
cated. If you either cannot walk in a straight line or arc
"pretty sure" that you are not under the influence, you
probably arc. In the event that any of these two condi
tions is the case, immediately flee the scene to avoid
likely criminal and/or civil charges.
4. Regardless of your determination arrived at by fol
lowing the procedure outlined in step three, do not
under any circumstances discuss what occurred with
whatever you crashcd into. If it is a person, you risk pre
maturely taking responsibility for what took place
whereas, upon further reflection, you might no longer
deem it your fault. If it is an inanimate object, you risk
looking like an idiot.
5. Thoroughly examine your body for possible injuries.
Be certain not to thoroughly examine the body of any
one else involved in the accident, though, as that might
bring about undesirable legal consequences.
6. In the event that any other individual involved in the
accident is not conscious, summon medical assistance.
With those that are conscious, exchange names, ad
dresses and phone numbers in as courteous a manner as
possible.
7. If you arc certain that the accident is not your fault,
insist on not allowing anything to be moved in order to

"preserve the evidence." If the other party does not
find this suTficiently compelling, try pulling out a piece
of white chalk, drawing a line around your bicycle and
then loudly yelling "Crime scene! Crime scene!" or
something equally embarrassing to nearby pedestrians.
8. Continue on to class. After all, you do have that
midterm on Monday that the professor will be review
ing. You were probably running late already — imag
ine how much you'll miss if you continue to dawdle
about bemoaning your "horrible accident."
