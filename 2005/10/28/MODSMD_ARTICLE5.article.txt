With one of the nation's top players on the injury
shelf for the rest of the season, the No. 5 Stanford
women's volleyball team (19-3, 8-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) didn't' appear to'miss a heat with last night's
convincing victory over Oregon (11-10,1-9) by mar
gins of 30-20,30-23,30-20.

man middle blocker Foluke Akinradewo led the Car

while Richards added 10. Stanford hit .346 for the
match while the Ducks were limited to. 110 at Maples
Pavillion.
The Oregon victory marked the first time all sea
son the Cardinal were without the explosive attack of
freshman outside hitter Cynthia Barboza, who suf
fered a torn ACL last Friday. With the victory, Stan
ford has now won 33 straight matches against Ore
gon in a streak dating back to 1989.
"We're in a position of trying to reinvent our
selves right now," Stanford head coach John Dunning
said. "I think a lot of people don't understand what
it's like to be in the position our team is in right now.
Losing a big person on your team to injury is really
difficult, and I'm really proud of the effort tonight."
Dunning said sophomore outside hitter Franci
Girard, junior middle blocker Jen Wilson and fresh
man outside hitter/middle blocker Erin Waller

worked hard in practice to determine which of the
three would play left side. Girard played the position
last night.
"Knowing my team just came off of losing one of
its best players, I just wanted to get out there," said
Girard, who contributed eight kills to the Stanford
attack. "I was really fired up and wanted to do what
ever I could for the team. We just need to stay confi
dent and scratch hard for every point. It's going to be
a long, tough road ahead, but we're ready to play for
it."
The Ducks entered the match fresh off their first
Pac-10 win of the year. Oregon freshman middle
blocker Mira Djuric, who leads the Pac-10 in service
aces, fueled the Ducks' offense, contributing 12 kills.
Richards led Stanford to the early advantage in
game one, recording four consecutive points off two
blocks and two kills, as the Cardinal quickly went up
8-3. But just when it appeared Stanford would cruise
to an easy victory, the Ducks swiftly stole the momen
tum and erupted fora 7-0 run. The teams continued
to exchange blows until a 12-all tie charged the Stan
ford attack, and it established a 24-16 lead.
In the Cardinal's first attempt to close out game
one, junior outside hitter Nji Nnamani's serve went
long, making the score 29-20. But Richards respond
ed on the next game point, collecting an ace as Stan
ford went up 1-0 for the match.

hot hands proved that lightning can
strike the same place twice, pro
pelling Stanford to an 8-5 lead. The
teams battled for the next few points
until Stanford once again gave the il
lusion that it would win easy, but the

serves as a major confidence boost
going into the final games of an ardu
ous Pac-10 season.
"We still have a lot of growing to do,
but I'm really proud of our effort
tonight," Dunning said."The more-ex
perienced players on the team really
stepped up. and playing well this week
end will help us going into a tough
Washington match next week."
Despite losing Barboza, Dunning
said he remains confident in the Car
dinal's season.

teams, is going to have to do a really
good job to catch Washington and the
Pac-10 title," he said. "We know it will
be hard, but it's still possible."
