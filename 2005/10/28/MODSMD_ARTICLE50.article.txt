## Tom Wolfe is jealous you go 
### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION MONKEY-PEOPLE HATER 
Last week, I had the opporninity
to have a chat with author Fom
Wolfe who recently published a
novel, "I am Charlotte Simmons",
which is rumored to be based in part
on life at Stanford.
(1>
INTERMISSION: While you don't
necessarily strive to do this many of
your novels define decades. Why
write about college students? Will
college students define the '00s?
TOM WOLFE: That was not my
goal. That is madness to set out to try
and do that. I choose college life be
cause there was nothing that T could
find that showed the inner life of col
lege students...except for psychologi
cal studies. Nothing that showed how

they felt about the...well it is the old
fashioned term but...sexual revolu
tion. Also the revolution of, well, tol
erance; there is so much tolerance for
different types of people in this coun
try. Tolerance has changed the social
structure of college.
INT: In your research what did you
find out about the social structure of
college today? Has it changed?
TW: As far as the social revolution, it
wasn't so much social status as it was
more the question of what is cool. In
fact, I have a whole discussion in the
book about the intellectual definition
of what comprises coolness. Today a
lot of has changed in terms of the sex
ual confidence of women and men.
Women act as if they have experi
ence, but not too much experience.
Men, very much are "ladies men,"
not so much a player— a "Playa" it

used to be called. That is a word that
hasn't disappeared completely but
it's not said anymore.
INT: I know that I was nervous to
read this novel because I hate to read
something about my generation.
What do you have to say to critics
who think you have no authority to
write about the college generation?
Who was your intended audience?
TW: I never think about intended au
dience. I also think of myself as any
thing but an authority on college life.
For me it was a process of finding out
about college life and trying to por
tray it accurately. There has been
some criticism that I didn't get certain
things right. At one point I have one
of the characters [say something
about Britney Spears]. One of the
critics said, "College students don't
talk about Britney Spears anymore."

But, they do (laughs). The next
week "Us Weekly" had a headline
on its cover "What's that Britney has
baking in your oven... a little pop
tart?"
INT: So I know that one place you
visited was Stanford, what did you
think?
TW: My overall impression of Stan
ford was that it's actually too pleasant
to be allowed. It's like turning the
pages of a book and each page is won
derful. Every day is the perfect tem
perature and all these nice looking
men and women bike around. Palm
lined...
Editor's Note: This is when part of the
interview is lost because someone be
gins to bang on the office d00r...
And it makes vie think th/it I missed out
on something. It's a great place to go.
When I was there in 2000, I made a

deal
wit h
th e

Eng
lish de
partment.

I would
speak in front

of journalism
classes. So I did a few.

Bang, bang...then the intruders
begin to talk in loud voices seemingly
oblivious to the fact that I am on the

phone...in fact, one would think that it must
be something important since I am on the
phone with TOM WOLFE! and they are in
terrupting my call. What I remember of this
lost section is basically, "There is one in par
ticular that I remember where the professor
told me..."
TW: (continues sans banging): "I just want
you to know that Chelsea Clinton is in this
class." And I couldn't figure out at first why
on earth he said that. Then I realized that he
probably didn't want me to tell the Monica
Lewinsky jokes while I was there. I didn't
have Monica Lewinsky on my mind any
way. So then I found myself trying to find
Chelsea Clinton. And outside of this room
were these two supposed college students in
polo shirts and khakis and sneakers. They
looked...
Now it sounds more like a KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK...somepeople
can't take hints (and my hints were as subtle
as a drunken fratguy's....
Exactly like college students except that
they were 40-years-old and built like two
linebackers. These were obviously her se
cret service guards. But, I understand that
she integrated herself very well at Stanford
and she was popular as far as I knew.
EST: You visited many schools to write the
novel; how did you form them into one
image? What were you looking to accom
plish by making this fictitious school?
TW: It was Stanford transferred to the east
coast because I don't know of any place
that's quite up to the Stanford model in
both high academic standing and big-time
sports. In fact, I don't know any place that
has a lot of emphasis on minor sports also. I
wanted both components in this novel. I
doubt that Stanford had any additions on
the basketball team that my fictitious uni
versity did. Yes, I was thinking about Stan
ford.
INT: Thank you for speaking with me.
TW: I hope that you have a nice year at
Stanford.
At this point, I finally have a chance to talk to
the pesky people and learn that they just want
to speak to "someone on the editorial staff'
about the event that they had today. I did
what I could to help them and not get angry
(If you want to know why they were knock
ing on the door please refer to Loren New
man s Oct. 25th article, "Activism focuses on
monkey business." All in all, I learned that
Tom Wolfe is jealous of us all and that's kind
of cool.

used to be called. That is a word that
hasn't disappeared completely but
it's not said anymore.
INT: I know that I was nervous to
read this novel because I hate to read
something about my generation.
What do you have to say to critics
who think you have no authority to
write about the college generation?
Who was your intended audience?
TW: I never think about intended au
dience. I also think of myself as any
thing but an authority on college life.
For me it was a process of finding out
about college life and trying to por
tray it accurately. There has been
some criticism that I didn't get certain
things right. At one point I have one
of the characters [say something
about Britney Spears]. One of the
critics said, "College students don't
talk about Britney Spears anymore."

But, they do (laughs). The next
week "Us Weekly" had a headline
on its cover "What's that Britney has
baking in your oven... a little pop
tart?"
INT: So I know that one place you
visited was Stanford, what did you
think?
TW: My overall impression of Stan
ford was that it's actually too pleasant
to be allowed. It's like turning the
pages of a book and each page is won
derful. Every day is the perfect tem
perature and all these nice looking
men and women bike around. Palm
lined...
Editor's Note: This is when part of the
interview is lost because someone be
gins to bang on the office d00r...
And it makes vie think th/it I missed out
on something. It's a great place to go.
When I was there in 2000, I made a

deal
wit h
th e

Eng

I would
speak in front

of journalism
classes. So I did a few.

Bang, bang...then the intruders
begin to talk in loud voices seemingly
oblivious to the fact that I am on the

phone...in fact, one would think that it must
be something important since I am on the
phone with TOM WOLFE! and they are in
terrupting my call. What I remember of this
lost section is basically, "There is one in par
ticular that I remember where the professor
told me..."
TW: (continues sans banging): "I just want
you to know that Chelsea Clinton is in this
class." And I couldn't figure out at first why
on earth he said that. Then I realized that he
probably didn't want me to tell the Monica
Lewinsky jokes while I was there. I didn't
have Monica Lewinsky on my mind any
way. So then I found myself trying to find
Chelsea Clinton. And outside of this room
were these two supposed college students in
polo shirts and khakis and sneakers. They
looked...
Now it sounds more like a KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK...somepeople
can't take hints (and my hints were as subtle
as a drunken fratguy's....
Exactly like college students except that
they were 40-years-old and built like two
linebackers. These were obviously her se
cret service guards. But, I understand that
she integrated herself very well at Stanford
and she was popular as far as I knew.
EST: You visited many schools to write the
novel; how did you form them into one
image? What were you looking to accom
plish by making this fictitious school?
TW: It was Stanford transferred to the east
coast because I don't know of any place
that's quite up to the Stanford model in
both high academic standing and big-time
sports. In fact, I don't know any place that
has a lot of emphasis on minor sports also. I
wanted both components in this novel. I
doubt that Stanford had any additions on
the basketball team that my fictitious uni
versity did. Yes, I was thinking about Stan
ford.
INT: Thank you for speaking with me.
TW: I hope that you have a nice year at
Stanford.
At this point, I finally have a chance to talk to
the pesky people and learn that they just want
to speak to "someone on the editorial staff'
about the event that they had today. I did
what I could to help them and not get angry
(If you want to know why they were knock
ing on the door please refer to Loren New
man s Oct. 25th article, "Activism focuses on
monkey business." All in all, I learned that
Tom Wolfe is jealous of us all and that's kind
of cool.
Last week, I had the opporninity
to have a chat with author Fom
Wolfe who recently published a
novel, "I am Charlotte Simmons",
which is rumored to be based in part
on life at Stanford.

INTERMISSION: While you don't
necessarily strive to do this many of
your novels define decades. Why
write about college students? Will
college students define the '00s?
TOM WOLFE: That was not my
goal. That is madness to set out to try
and do that. I choose college life be
cause there was nothing that T could
find that showed the inner life of col
lege students...except for psychologi
cal studies. Nothing that showed how

they felt about the...well it is the old
fashioned term but...sexual revolu
tion. Also the revolution of, well, tol
erance; there is so much tolerance for
different types of people in this coun
try. Tolerance has changed the social
structure of college.
INT: In your research what did you
find out about the social structure of
college today? Has it changed?
TW: As far as the social revolution, it
wasn't so much social status as it was
more the question of what is cool. In
fact, I have a whole discussion in the
book about the intellectual definition
of what comprises coolness. Today a
lot of has changed in terms of the sex
ual confidence of women and men.
Women act as if they have experi
ence, but not too much experience.
Men, very much are "ladies men,"
not so much a player— a "Playa" it

used to be called. That is a word that
