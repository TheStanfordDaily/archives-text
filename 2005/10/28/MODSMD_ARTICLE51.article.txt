# If only Aaron McGruder were as interesting and funny as his comic strip

### ANDREW BURMON INTERMISSION BOONDOCKER 
I pushed the tape into the VCrc. and there they
were, Huey, Riley and Granddad, walking down

the aisles of a i roceiy store where rich white ba
bies screamed in the aisles. Seeing the Freeman
family, the characters in"The Boondocks," a
comic strip that has gained infamy and populari
ty at astounding rates over the past several years,
on a TV screen seemed exciting to me. Their cre
ator, their puppeteer if you will, was.after all, on
te^sof
those tilings that everyone is thinking, like point
injvoutjhat Condoleeza Rice is probablv either a
lesbian or Ci.W. Bush's lover. Other times he
someone off. These someones have
run the gsflnut from Oprah Winfrey to the Chris
tian Rtghl. In short, a lot of people hate him. So 1
naturally thought, in this mixed up world of ours,
thanhe <w>uld be very likeable and funny, not un
like his own characters.
AH listening to him answer questions from
otherKorters and tell them offhandedly he
woulcß mind being slighted if he was getting
paid arid that the main difference between the
strip and the new show, which will air on adult
swim, would be millions of dollars, 1 wasn't so
sure. '

Jntermivsjon: One of the pilot episodes opens
with a sequence of Huey dreaming that he is at a
garden party behind a microphone and he is say
ing things that make the passive white people
riot. If you were put in that dream sequence, talk
ing to the garden party that is Middle America,
jjftat would yog say?
Aaron McGrudtr: Umm, I don'tjeally nave
much to say anymore. I've got nothing to say to
be honslt with you, causethere is nothing! could
say thafcould r|a^a^ererice.
IN I: Then why should we watch youfshow?
McG: Cause its funny.
INT: So you basically changed t'rom political
commentary to just comedy? ■
McG: No, I think there is a lonot political com
mentary in there, but if you are asking me if I
could get in front of a microphone and tell Amer
ica something what would I say, il really svfuldn't
be anything. I do the show so I don't hve to do
that sort of thing, (laughs) I mean, that's tfie hope;
that the work speaks for itself. H
INT: Do you think you've had hav
ing the work speak for itself in aWn-political
realm? W

M cG: That's probably a question better for other
people to judge. I am not able to perceive my
work very well. 1 can siyback and analyze other
elements of pop-culture, but I'm "100 close to
mine and I'm never there when people read it.
INT: So you really don't think of yourself as the
next Garry Trudeau?
McG: I djpa't-think so. I think Garry's passion is
comic that passion has carried him into
three it. I enjoy comic strips, but
1 don't know if Tm so passionate about it that I'll
