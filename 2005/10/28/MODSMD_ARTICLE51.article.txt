# If only Aaron McGruder were as interesting and funny as his comic strip
## 
### ANDREW BURMON INTERMISSION BOONDOCKER 
I pushed the tape into the VCrc. and there they
were, Huey, Riley and Granddad, walking down

the aisles of a i roceiy store where rich white ba
bies screamed in the aisles. Seeing the Freeman
family, the characters in"The Boondocks," a
comic strip that has gained infamy and populari
ty at astounding rates over the past several years,
on a TV screen seemed exciting to me. Their cre
ator, their puppeteer if you will, was.after all, on
te^sof
those tilings that everyone is thinking, like point
injvoutjhat Condoleeza Rice is probablv either a
lesbian or Ci.W. Bush's lover. Other times he
someone off. These someones have
run the gsflnut from Oprah Winfrey to the Chris
tian Rtghl. In short, a lot of people hate him. So 1
naturally thought, in this mixed up world of ours,
thanhe <w>uld be very likeable and funny, not un
like his own characters.
AH listening to him answer questions from
otherKorters and tell them offhandedly he
woulcß mind being slighted if he was getting
paid arid that the main difference between the
strip and the new show, which will air on adult
swim, would be millions of dollars, 1 wasn't so
sure. '

Jntermivsjon: One of the pilot episodes opens
with a sequence of Huey dreaming that he is at a
garden party behind a microphone and he is say
ing things that make the passive white people
riot. If you were put in that dream sequence, talk
ing to the garden party that is Middle America,
jjftat would yog say?
Aaron McGrudtr: Umm, I don'tjeally nave
much to say anymore. I've got nothing to say to
be honslt with you, causethere is nothing! could
say thafcould r|a^a^ererice.
IN I: Then why should we watch youfshow?
McG: Cause its funny.
INT: So you basically changed t'rom political
commentary to just comedy? ■
McG: No, I think there is a lonot political com
mentary in there, but if you are asking me if I
could get in front of a microphone and tell Amer
ica something what would I say, il really svfuldn't
be anything. I do the show so I don't hve to do
that sort of thing, (laughs) I mean, that's tfie hope;
that the work speaks for itself. H
INT: Do you think you've had hav
ing the work speak for itself in aWn-political
realm? W

M cG: That's probably a question better for other
people to judge. I am not able to perceive my
work very well. 1 can siyback and analyze other
elements of pop-culture, but I'm "100 close to
mine and I'm never there when people read it.
INT: So you really don't think of yourself as the
next Garry Trudeau?
McG: I djpa't-think so. I think Garry's passion is
comic that passion has carried him into
three it. I enjoy comic strips, but
1 don't know if Tm so passionate about it that I'll


be doing it for as long as Garry's
been doing it or having anything
near the illustrious career he has
had. I do like telling stories and I
don't have any problem putting
my politics or my personal point
of view into those stories. I don't
know if Garry would deem him
self more than anything but a
satirist and an entertainer, but
personally I'm happy to just be a
satirist and an entertainer.
INT: I read an interview in the
"New Yorker" with you that de
picted you as living in a pent
house across from the Four Sea
sons Hotel and throughout this
interview you've mentioned
money on many occasions and
you shopped your show to Fox; at
what point do you find yourself
flirting with those things your
strip initially came out against?
McG: I think I started flirting
with the things my strip came out
against a few years before any
one saw the strip. Again, you
make the decision once you de
cide to show something to the
public to get in business with the
people that are going to allow
you to do that and something
you don't have control of who or
what that is. I have to deal with
the syndicate; the syndicate has
to deal with newspapers all
around the country owned by
corporations.
I've never come out and said,
"Hey guys here's the revolu
tion." That was just the percep
tion that came out on its own.
Because I see where it would be
easy to manipulate people, be
cause people frustrated with
government are looking for
change and those frustrated with
the democratic part don't have
any progressive leaders. I can see
where the temptation would be
for people to look at entertainers
and for entertainers to take ad
vantage of that.
Part of the reason I keep
stressing money is that I really
want to pound into people's
heads that this is commerce.
There is a money transaction be
hind everything they see nowa
days. They have to know that be
cause I would feel like I was mis
leading them if it wasn't stressed.
I get that we rarely see these

things on TV and it seems like a
challenge to the powers that be.
In my experience I do not be
lieve that is true. When you be
come a threat to the powers that
be you know because you die. If
you are around and still allowed
to make money, they are proba
bly not scared of you.
I'm not all about money. But
I realize that you have to have
certain business savvy if you
want to get your stories told and
your message across. You have
to do that intelligently and the
only way you can do it like I'm
doing it is to make white people
a lot of money. That might seem
like a catch-22, and to a certain
degree it is if you are trying to be
a political leader, which I am not.
I am trying to do entertainment.
INT: Given that, what would you
suspect your character Huey
would think of you?
McG: You know what. I pre
sume that Huey would have
quite a few issues with the corpo
rations involved and such, but
Huey's 10; I know better. It's real
straightforward. It's the price of
entry. If it was up to Huey, "The
Boondocks" would be printed
on something that would come
out of my computer and I would
walk around and hand it out to
people. It would be a real low
budget operation and it might be
morally pure, but no one would
have any idea what I was saying.
It's a trade off I guess.
So that was that. McGruder
went back to his masseuse or
chai latte and I sat fora while and
thought about the lack of liberal
leadership in America. Then I
had to stop thinking about it be
cause it was time for squash prac
tice.
I guess we're all a little taint
ed.
Editor's note: Thanks to Andrew
for being so patient; the interx'iew
started 45 minutes late and ran 15
minutes over, so not only did he
miss class, but he was late for
squash practice. This editor un
derstands, as she mussed her after
noon nap.
