## Even worst-case scenarios can't stop Roxy from getting what she wants... 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS/SURVIVAL EXPERT 
Roxy has regaled you with many a tale
of sexual splendor over the years. While the
stories have all been 100 percent true, Roxy
nonetheless has a confession to make: even
a goddess has her off-days. So without fur
ther ado, Roxy presents a worst-case sexu
al scenario of hers, and just what she need
ed to do to survive. Roxy bets at least some
of you out there can relate.
Worst-case scenario: He apparently
thought it was "Freshman 150"
Symptoms:
- Your friends call him "Chubblers."
- You call him "Chubblers."
- Your boyfriend isn't even jealous when

you flirt with him, just
digusted.

You'd
rather be

grinding your
girlfriend. (Actually,

Roxy thinks that is kind of

hot. She's always game fora threesome.)
- You would rather be fucking Karl Rove.
Seek medical attention immediately, this
could be life-threatening.

Immediate Survival:
- Cut-off your ties at any cost. Distract him
with a pie if necessary.
- Try actually talking to Karl for five min
utes — the conversation should show you
just how serious your condition is. If, some
how, the interaction doesn't scar you for
life, perhaps his syphilis will.
- If quality becomes a chronic issue, howev
er, your treatment must not only be reme
dial, but also preventative.
Long-term survival:
- Design an obstacle course between you and
your bed as a means of quality control. Hur
dles, low ceilings, molten lava, rattlesnakes,
the natives of "MarioKart's DK Jungle Park
way" throwing coconuts at overweight passer
byers—whatever it takes to ensure that the
lucky few (or many, let's not lie) that do make
it to your mattress are in peak physical condi-

tion. Roxy prefers to loft her bed
above all her roommates',

about 12 feet in the air,
so that if a lagoon
V creature ever

does make
( it up there.

the en
t ire

112 struc
ture will

collapse,
and the number

of broken bones
Roxy's roommates,

who should have stopped
Roxy in the first place, acquire is di-

rectly proportional to the weight of said crea
ture. Ahh, Darwinian selection at its finest.
- Once fully functional, your obstacle
course/DeathStar bed can also serve as
your sober goggles, screening out undesir
able mates far more effectively than your

brain after six shots of Quervo and whatev
er that sketchy frat guy was all-too eager to
practically pour down your throat. If de
sired, your deathtrap setup can even make
sure your partner is

sober enough to re
member your name
in the morning — just
let him try to navigate
that lava while drunk
Worst-case scenario:
The puker
Symptoms:
- Somehow, your tar
get navigates the hur
dles, leaps the lava
and fakes out the co
conut-wielding na
tives en route to your
deathbed. This is not
all bad — the co
conuts and lava
weren't intended for
him anyways. Roxy
even thinks he's kind
of cute and reminds
her of her childhood
crush Hugh Grant.,
those dreamy eyes,
those man shoul
ders... oh, but Roxy
digresses.
- Anyway, Roxy is fi
nally up with her tar
get on the death trap,
and Shania knew what

she was talking
i about, cuz man, she feels like a woman.
' There are fireworks, explosions and or
gasms she didn't even knew existed, but,
just as she's snapping in and out of reality.

he's snapping in and out of conscious-

ness. Turns out our target had a few

too many to drink, and before

he can make it off the

Death Star, his

vomit is all

over

Roxy's
most prized
real estate.
Survival:

- All kidding aside, Roxy's

number one priority is always
getting a too-drunk partner home

safely. At the same time though, Roxy's

entire abode did not need to smell like last
Thursday's chicken, so Roxy had to think
quickly on her feet. What your sex goddess
decided was to quickly drag her mattress out
side to let her room air out while she walked

her partner back. Upon returning from her
late-night jaunt though, Roxy spies her draw
mates in the distance, sauntering back from
their late-night escapades, man candy (natu-

rally) in tow. Before Roxy can say anything,
one particular drawmate spies a

solitary mattress outside the

building and thinks it

would be a

great

idea

to Lam-

beau Leap

into said
Deathßed. Roxy

tries her best, but alas

Ellen, hypothetically of

course, is already airborne

and Roxy is in a fit of hysteria.

Asked later how the mattress felt,

all Ellen could manage was "wet."

Roxy knows a little bit about being "wet."

Kinda defeats the purpose of a threesome, doesn't it?

ed to do to survive. Roxy bets at least some
of you out there can relate.
Worst-case scenario: He apparently
thought it was "Freshman 150"
Symptoms:
- Your friends call him "Chubblers."
- You call him "Chubblers."
- Your boyfriend isn't even jealous when

you flirt with him, just
digusted.

You'd
rather be

grinding your
girlfriend. (Actually,

Roxy thinks that is kind of

hot. She's always game fora threesome.)
- You would rather be fucking Karl Rove.
Seek medical attention immediately, this
could be life-threatening.

Immediate Survival:
- Cut-off your ties at any cost. Distract him
with a pie if necessary.
- Try actually talking to Karl for five min
utes — the conversation should show you
just how serious your condition is. If, some
how, the interaction doesn't scar you for
life, perhaps his syphilis will.
- If quality becomes a chronic issue, howev
er, your treatment must not only be reme
dial, but also preventative.
Long-term survival:
- Design an obstacle course between you and
your bed as a means of quality control. Hur
dles, low ceilings, molten lava, rattlesnakes,
the natives of "MarioKart's DK Jungle Park
way" throwing coconuts at overweight passer
byers—whatever it takes to ensure that the
lucky few (or many, let's not lie) that do make
it to your mattress are in peak physical condi-

tion. Roxy prefers to loft her bed
above all her roommates',

about 12 feet in the air,
so that if a lagoon
V creature ever

does make
( it up there.

the en
t ire

112 struc
ture will

collapse,
and the number

of broken bones
Roxy's roommates,

who should have stopped
Roxy in the first place, acquire is di-

rectly proportional to the weight of said crea
ture. Ahh, Darwinian selection at its finest.
- Once fully functional, your obstacle
course/DeathStar bed can also serve as
your sober goggles, screening out undesir
able mates far more effectively than your

brain after six shots of Quervo and whatev
er that sketchy frat guy was all-too eager to
practically pour down your throat. If de
sired, your deathtrap setup can even make
sure your partner is

sober enough to re
member your name
in the morning — just
let him try to navigate
that lava while drunk
Worst-case scenario:
The puker
Symptoms:
- Somehow, your tar
get navigates the hur
dles, leaps the lava
and fakes out the co
conut-wielding na
tives en route to your
deathbed. This is not
all bad — the co
conuts and lava
weren't intended for
him anyways. Roxy
even thinks he's kind
of cute and reminds
her of her childhood
crush Hugh Grant.,
those dreamy eyes,
those man shoul
ders... oh, but Roxy
digresses.
- Anyway, Roxy is fi
nally up with her tar
get on the death trap,
and Shania knew what

she was talking
i about, cuz man, she feels like a woman.
' There are fireworks, explosions and or
gasms she didn't even knew existed, but,
just as she's snapping in and out of reality.

he's snapping in and out of conscious-

ness. Turns out our target had a few

too many to drink, and before

he can make it off the

Death Star, his

vomit is all

over

Roxy's
most prized
real estate.
Survival:

- All kidding aside, Roxy's

number one priority is always
getting a too-drunk partner home

safely. At the same time though, Roxy's

entire abode did not need to smell like last
Thursday's chicken, so Roxy had to think
quickly on her feet. What your sex goddess
decided was to quickly drag her mattress out
side to let her room air out while she walked

her partner back. Upon returning from her
late-night jaunt though, Roxy spies her draw
mates in the distance, sauntering back from
their late-night escapades, man candy (natu-

rally) in tow. Before Roxy can say anything,
one particular drawmate spies a

solitary mattress outside the

building and thinks it

would be a

great

idea

to Lam-

beau Leap

into said
Deathßed. Roxy

tries her best, but alas

Ellen, hypothetically of

course, is already airborne

and Roxy is in a fit of hysteria.

Asked later how the mattress felt,

all Ellen could manage was "wet."

Roxy knows a little bit about being "wet."

Kinda defeats the purpose of a threesome, doesn't it?

Roxy has regaled you with many a tale
of sexual splendor over the years. While the
stories have all been 100 percent true, Roxy
nonetheless has a confession to make: even
a goddess has her off-days. So without fur
ther ado, Roxy presents a worst-case sexu
al scenario of hers, and just what she need
