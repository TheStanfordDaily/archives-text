## Seven Palestinians killed in missile strike 
### KARIN LAUB ASSOCIATED PRESS 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel killed seven
Palestinians in a missile strike yesterday against Is
lamic Jihad, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said
he would not meet with the Palestinian leader until
he cracks down on armed groups — a double-edged
Israeli response to the latest suicide bombing.
Sharon threatened a "broad and relentless" of
fensive against Palestinian militants, including
mass arrests and airstrikes, but security officials
said Israel would stop short of a large-scale mili
tary operation.
Sharon's decision to shun Palestinian leader
Mahmoud Abbas was the clearest signal vet that

efforts to revive peacemaking after Israel's pullout
from the Gaza Strip last month have run aground.
Abbas has said he cannot and will not confront mil
itants, fearing civil war, but it's unlikely progress
can be made unless the two leaders meet.
The international community has been press
ing fora quick Israeli-Palestinian agreement on
new security arrangements for Gaza's borders,
and a continued deadlock over such issues will
prevent the economic recovery of impoverished
Gaza. That, in turn, could hurt Abbas' chances in
parliamentary elections in January.
In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice lodged a new appeal Thursday with Abbas to
prevent terror attacks on Israel and dismantle the
groups that carry them out. She balanced her re

quest to Abbas with appeals to Israel to resume
contacts with the Palestinians, said State Depart
ment spokesman Sean McCormack.
Wednesday's bombing in an open-air market in
the central Israeli town of Hadera killed five Is
raelis, the fourth suicide attack by Islamic Jihad
since Abbas negotiated a truce deal with Palestin
ian groups in February.
Abbas, widely known as Abu Mazen, con
demned the bombing, but Israel said he must do
much more.
"If the Palestinian Authority does not take seri
ous and tangible action against terrorism, there
will be no diplomatic progress and that would be a
pity. In such a situation, I will not meet with Abu
Mazen," Sharon said.
