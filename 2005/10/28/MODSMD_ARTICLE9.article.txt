# Prosecutor races to hand indictments to top administration officials
## 
### PETE YOST ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Work
ing against the clock. Special Prose
cutor Patrick Fitzgerald weighed
criminal charges against top presi
dential aides at the end of a two
year investigation that put the
White House in a state of high sus
pense Thursday night.
Fitzgerald raced against a Friday
expiration of the grand jury that
has been investigating the exposure
of covert CIA officer Valerie
Plame's identity. Speculation flew
across Washington about who
would be indicted, or whether
Fitzgerald would even bring crimi
nal charges.
White House colleagues feared
Vice President Dick Cheney's chief
of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby,
would be indicted Friday for at
least false statements but held out
hope that presidential political ad
viser Karl Rove might escape crim
inal charges for the time being.
A person outside the legal pro
fession familiar with recent devel
opments in the case said Thursday
night that Rove's team does not be
lieve he is out of legal jeopardy yet
but likely would be spared bad
news Friday when the White House
fears the first indictments will be is
sued.
Fitzgerald signaled Thursday he
might keep Rove under continuing
investigation, sparing him firom im
mediate charges, the person said,
speaking only on condition of
anonymity because of the secrecy
of the grand jury probe.
Both Rove and Libby put in their
normal long work day at the White
House on Thursday.
The prospect of indictments
added to the woes of an administra
tion already facing serious political
problems.

On a day when the White House
dealt with the withdrawal of
Supreme Court nominee Harriet
Miers, Rove attended the daily
meeting of the senior staff and met
with President Bush late in the
evening. Libby was said to have
passed up the staff meeting to at
tend a security briefing.
Two blocks from the White
House, Fitzgerald was at work in his
Washington office, considering his
next moves in the investigation.
In addition to false statements,
prosecutors have also considered
other charges such as mishandling
classified information, obstruction of
justice or illegally disclosing the iden
tity of a covert intelligence agent.
When the investigation began
two years ago, a White House
spokesman checked with Rove and
Libby, then assured the public that
neither was involved in leaking
Plame's identity.
In the past several weeks, Libby
has acknowledged that he spoke to
New York Times reporter Judith
Miller, and the newspaper has re
ported that their talks were about
Plame's CIA status.
Rove's legal problems stem in
part from the fact that he failed to
tell prosecutors about a conversa
tion in which he toidTime magazine
reporter Matt Cooper that Plame
worked for the CIA. The presi
dent's top political adviser says the
conversation slipped his mind.
Fitzgerald's office found out
about the Rove-Cooper contact
last year when Rove's lawyer dis
covered an e-mail that the prosecu
tor had not previously requested.
The e-mail memorialized the
Rove-Cooper phone call.
As late as this week, Fitzgerald
was still hunting for witnesses who
could undercut Rove's assertion
that hq had forgotten about the
conversation.
