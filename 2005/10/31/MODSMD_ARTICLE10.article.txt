## When Identities COLLIDE Sorority discusses intersection between being a woman and being black 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Black, woman, trailblazer, innovator, sister — who
are you? It is with this icebreaker that Stanford's chap
ter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority begins a spirited
discussion last Thursday centered on the question of
whether a black woman should be more focused on
advocating racial equality or gender equality.
Senior Chioke Borgelt-Mose asked the 20-plus fe
males sitting in the Women's Community Center —
some of whom were not members of the sorority — to
rank the five identities from most to least important.
As each woman speaks, Borgelt-Mose noted to her
self what seemed to be the priority — being black or
being a female.
Thursday's program, titled "Strong and Beautiful:
The Intersection of Black Women and the Feminist
Movement," is a follow-up to the sorority's vigil in
honor of Rosa Parks that was held the previous night.
Although all were encouraged to contribute freely
to the conversation, Borgelt-Mose also guided partic
ipants with issues posed in Peggy Orenstein's book,
"Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Love, Kids and Life in a
Half-Changed World." "Flux" features interviews
with more than 2(X) women aged 25 to 45 and de
scribes their various career and personal paths. Read
ing excerpts from the book and quotations from other
publications, Borgelt-Mose asked probing questions
and received honest and illuminating answers from
the women present.
Mainly, students offered insights regarding the pri
oritization of identity — should they place more em
phasis on being a woman or on being black?
"I feel more solidarity from the black community
than from the women's community across racial
lines," said senior Theresa Johnson.
Others, such as senior Ashlea Graves, said they feel
differently.
"Being a woman carries me through my art — as a
writer and as an innovator," Graves said.
Junior Claire Woods agreed.
"I feel like I am secure in my race, but I am still
growing as a woman."
These women address, among other things, nega-

tive connotations that are
sometimes associated with
feminism, the differences
between black men and
black women in their \news
of gender and race and the
challenges faced by black

women today.
Senior Angel Davis, Delta

Sigma Theta's fall programming
chair and Women's Community
Center liaison, said in an inter-

view after the discussion,
"Many people,female or male,
black or white, are afraid of

the word feminist, and that is

an issue that needs to be ex
plored. Feminism really is

not a bad word. It is a
movement for equality."
From politics to sociol
ogy to personal experi-

ence, these Stanford stu
dents discussed what it
means when, as Borgelt-

Mose put it, "being black
and being a woman inter
sect and sometimes collide."

Frustration and emotion are evident at times —
does one really have to choose between race and gen
der?
"No one lets you do everything," says one student
who wishes to remain anonymous. "I want to save the
world, but people are telling me I can't do that and
have a family...but I want to do it all."
This view was not uncommon among the ambi
tious women present.
At one point, when talking about the need for part
ners to cooperate in a relationship, senior Sarena
Mcßae complained about the double standard that
was evident in her household.
"People tell me I'm high-maintenance, but I know

what I want," Mcßae said. "I want it 50-50." Graves
slapped her thigh in agreement and said, "Preach,
preach!"
Despite positive changes that have taken place for
women, those present concur that there is still much
to be done to get women the representation that they
deserve — in politics, in the corporate world and in
other arenas.
The commitment to this cause takes a heavy toll on
some women, asserted several of the students who at
tended the event.
"I think for black women it is hard to separate our
personal, individual growth and the growth of the
black female community," Borgelt-Mose said."! am

driven in 10 different directions."
Another member of Delta Sigma
Theta, who wishes to remain anony
mous, said she identifies with this idea.
_ "1 think we've been socialized to

take care of everyone else first and then
ourselves last." she said. "It ties into al
ways supporting the black man, but we

don't always get that support back."
Davis said that often, black women

put their own issues aside for the
good of the community, whereas
black men often do not.
"It is a frustrating issue and it

would have been better discussed
if men were there fat the pro
gram] to speak as well." she
added.
Although some participants in
the discussion said they want to

make their mark on the business
world, there is acceptance for those
who choose to be "stay-at-home
moms" too.
"You can be a stay-at-home mom

and still be entrepreneurial," said
Graves, whose own mother runs a busi-

ness out of her home. "I think it's a beauti-

ful thing to be a black mother because you are instill
ing your strength into your children."
This statement was followed by murmurs of agree
ment.
Regardless of whether they had mothers who in
spired them or if they are exhibiting their own brand
of personal power, the women of Delta Sigma Theta
are hoping to help all women on campus speak open
ly about many of today's unresolved feminist issues.
"We, as women, had a lot to say on the subject —
this further emphasizes the need for discussions like
this," Davis said. "We as black women, and as mem
bers of a public service sorority, will continue to uplift
the women on campus as well as in our community."

world, but people are telling me I can't do that and
have a family...but I want to do it all."
This view was not uncommon among the ambi
tious women present.
At one point, when talking about the need for part
ners to cooperate in a relationship, senior Sarena
Mcßae complained about the double standard that
was evident in her household.
"People tell me I'm high-maintenance, but I know

what I want," Mcßae said. "I want it 50-50." Graves
slapped her thigh in agreement and said, "Preach,
preach!"
Despite positive changes that have taken place for
women, those present concur that there is still much
to be done to get women the representation that they
deserve — in politics, in the corporate world and in
other arenas.
The commitment to this cause takes a heavy toll on
some women, asserted several of the students who at
tended the event.
"I think for black women it is hard to separate our
personal, individual growth and the growth of the
black female community," Borgelt-Mose said."! am

driven in 10 different directions."
Another member of Delta Sigma
Theta, who wishes to remain anony
mous, said she identifies with this idea.
_ "1 think we've been socialized to

take care of everyone else first and then
ourselves last." she said. "It ties into al
ways supporting the black man, but we

don't always get that support back."
Davis said that often, black women

put their own issues aside for the
good of the community, whereas
black men often do not.
"It is a frustrating issue and it

would have been better discussed
if men were there fat the pro
gram] to speak as well." she
added.
Although some participants in
the discussion said they want to

make their mark on the business
world, there is acceptance for those
who choose to be "stay-at-home
moms" too.
"You can be a stay-at-home mom

and still be entrepreneurial," said
Graves, whose own mother runs a busi-

ness out of her home. "I think it's a beauti-

ful thing to be a black mother because you are instill
ing your strength into your children."
This statement was followed by murmurs of agree
ment.
Regardless of whether they had mothers who in
spired them or if they are exhibiting their own brand
of personal power, the women of Delta Sigma Theta
are hoping to help all women on campus speak open
ly about many of today's unresolved feminist issues.
"We, as women, had a lot to say on the subject —
this further emphasizes the need for discussions like
this," Davis said. "We as black women, and as mem
bers of a public service sorority, will continue to uplift
the women on campus as well as in our community."

Black, woman, trailblazer, innovator, sister — who
are you? It is with this icebreaker that Stanford's chap
ter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority begins a spirited
discussion last Thursday centered on the question of
whether a black woman should be more focused on
advocating racial equality or gender equality.
Senior Chioke Borgelt-Mose asked the 20-plus fe
males sitting in the Women's Community Center —
some of whom were not members of the sorority — to
rank the five identities from most to least important.
As each woman speaks, Borgelt-Mose noted to her
self what seemed to be the priority — being black or
being a female.
Thursday's program, titled "Strong and Beautiful:
The Intersection of Black Women and the Feminist
Movement," is a follow-up to the sorority's vigil in
honor of Rosa Parks that was held the previous night.
Although all were encouraged to contribute freely
to the conversation, Borgelt-Mose also guided partic
ipants with issues posed in Peggy Orenstein's book,
"Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Love, Kids and Life in a
Half-Changed World." "Flux" features interviews
with more than 2(X) women aged 25 to 45 and de
scribes their various career and personal paths. Read
ing excerpts from the book and quotations from other
publications, Borgelt-Mose asked probing questions
and received honest and illuminating answers from
the women present.
Mainly, students offered insights regarding the pri
oritization of identity — should they place more em
phasis on being a woman or on being black?
"I feel more solidarity from the black community
than from the women's community across racial
lines," said senior Theresa Johnson.
Others, such as senior Ashlea Graves, said they feel
differently.
"Being a woman carries me through my art — as a
writer and as an innovator," Graves said.
Junior Claire Woods agreed.
"I feel like I am secure in my race, but I am still
growing as a woman."
These women address, among other things, nega-

tive connotations that are
sometimes associated with
feminism, the differences
between black men and
black women in their \news
of gender and race and the
challenges faced by black

women today.
Senior Angel Davis, Delta

Sigma Theta's fall programming
chair and Women's Community
Center liaison, said in an inter-

view after the discussion,
"Many people,female or male,
black or white, are afraid of

the word feminist, and that is

an issue that needs to be ex
plored. Feminism really is

not a bad word. It is a
movement for equality."
From politics to sociol
ogy to personal experi-

ence, these Stanford stu
dents discussed what it
means when, as Borgelt-

Mose put it, "being black
and being a woman inter
sect and sometimes collide."

Frustration and emotion are evident at times —
does one really have to choose between race and gen
der?

who wishes to remain anonymous. "I want to save the
