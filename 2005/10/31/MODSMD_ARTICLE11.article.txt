# My Other Car... IS A PICKUP LINE
## 
### 
I was sitting alone in my room one
weeknight drinking tepid vodka out of
a Care Bear mug, when I thought of
something that seemed — even for me —
really insightful.
"You know," 1 said out loud to the empty
room. "I'd really like to see pickup lines
come hack into style." The Care Bear on
the mug solemnly nodded in agreement.
Pickup lines are a great way for men to
express to women — in five seconds or
less — that they would like to get down
their pants. Granted, there are ways to do
this without using pickup lines, hut women
are universally known to be terrible at
picking up on "hints" and "signals" that
utilize "nonverbal communication" and
"things other than grabbing my ass as I
walk toward the keg." What chicks need is
a snappy one-liner stating the obvious in a
way that is both clever and to the point.
History is full of famous couples that got
together as a result of a good pickup line.
Romeo and Juliet. Anthony and Cleopatra.

Lewis and Clark (Lewis to Clark: "Is that
the Louisiana Purchase in your pocket or
are you just happy to sec me?").
The take-home point here is that I
would not be in my room boozing it up
with FunShinc Bear and writing a column
about being alone if Stanford guys simply
took a little initiative and expressed their
interest. But you can't come up to me dur
ing lecture and be like, "HELLO MY
NAMI IS FRED AND I AM IN I I R
ESTED IN TOUCHING YOUR FACE
OR POSSIBLY FATHERING YOUR
CHILDREN." No. that's sexual harass

ment.and sexual harassment is illegal.
Pickup lines.on the other hand.are per
fectly legal and actually encouraged by
renowned institutions such as Stanford
Single and the Church of Scientology.
They convey the intended message while
still appearing refined. Here are sonic ex
amples of good pickup lines:
"Do I know I know you from some
where? Maybe in my dreams?"
"Your legs must be tired cause you've
been running through my mind all day."
"I'm rich."
I lere are some examples of bad pickup
lines:
"Does this rag smell like chloroform?"
"They call me Tiny fora reason!"
I understand that it may be difficult for
some individuals to grasp the subtleties of
this concept, so I'm going to devote the
rest of the column to answering frequent
ly asked questions about pickup lines.
Q: How do I know if my current pick
up line is a good one?

A: Take a quick look around you right
now. If you are surrounded by attractive
models, fast cars and high-quality cocaine,
you have a good pickup line. Either that or
you are an investment banker, in which
case you also probably have syphilis.
Q: My father is an investment hanker.
A: I'm sorry to hear that.
Q: In what environments should one
consider using a pickup line?
A: Appropriate environments include
bars, pubs and all-campus patties. Also:
emergency room waiting areas ("Is that a
steak knife lodged in your eye or are you
just happy to sec me?"), psychotherapy
sessions and funerals.
Q: With whom should I use iny pickup
line?
A: Anyone you want to sleep with.
Q: Even my ("hem TA?
A: No.That's just sick.
Q: She's a very attractive woman.
A: She's married and has two children.
Q: But I can offer her a brief escape

from a loveless marriage.
A: Where? In your one-room triple?
(J: I talked to my roommates. I'm
going to leave a soek on the door when
she's around. They're eool with it.
A: Well. 1 guess that's okay then.
Q: What do I do after I use the pickup
line?
A: There are two schools of thought on
the matter. The first school of thought is to
wait for her reaction, and then'if she does
n't slap you. offer to buy her a drink and go
from there.The second school of thought is
to run away immediately and then return a
few minutes later saying, "Man, there are
some pretty shady characters around here.
How arc you doing?" This works especial
ly well with the elderly.
Q: Can women also use pickup lines?
A: No.

"You know," 1 said out loud to the empty
room. "I'd really like to see pickup lines
come hack into style." The Care Bear on
the mug solemnly nodded in agreement.
Pickup lines are a great way for men to
express to women — in five seconds or
less — that they would like to get down
their pants. Granted, there are ways to do
this without using pickup lines, hut women
are universally known to be terrible at
picking up on "hints" and "signals" that
utilize "nonverbal communication" and
"things other than grabbing my ass as I
walk toward the keg." What chicks need is
a snappy one-liner stating the obvious in a
way that is both clever and to the point.
History is full of famous couples that got
together as a result of a good pickup line.
Romeo and Juliet. Anthony and Cleopatra.

Lewis and Clark (Lewis to Clark: "Is that
the Louisiana Purchase in your pocket or
are you just happy to sec me?").
The take-home point here is that I
would not be in my room boozing it up
with FunShinc Bear and writing a column
about being alone if Stanford guys simply
took a little initiative and expressed their
interest. But you can't come up to me dur
ing lecture and be like, "HELLO MY
NAMI IS FRED AND I AM IN I I R
ESTED IN TOUCHING YOUR FACE
OR POSSIBLY FATHERING YOUR
CHILDREN." No. that's sexual harass

ment.and sexual harassment is illegal.
Pickup lines.on the other hand.are per
fectly legal and actually encouraged by
renowned institutions such as Stanford
Single and the Church of Scientology.
They convey the intended message while
still appearing refined. Here are sonic ex
amples of good pickup lines:
"Do I know I know you from some
where? Maybe in my dreams?"
"Your legs must be tired cause you've
been running through my mind all day."
"I'm rich."
I lere are some examples of bad pickup
lines:
"Does this rag smell like chloroform?"
"They call me Tiny fora reason!"
I understand that it may be difficult for
some individuals to grasp the subtleties of
this concept, so I'm going to devote the
rest of the column to answering frequent
ly asked questions about pickup lines.
Q: How do I know if my current pick
up line is a good one?

A: Take a quick look around you right
now. If you are surrounded by attractive
models, fast cars and high-quality cocaine,
you have a good pickup line. Either that or
you are an investment banker, in which
case you also probably have syphilis.
Q: My father is an investment hanker.
A: I'm sorry to hear that.
Q: In what environments should one
consider using a pickup line?
A: Appropriate environments include
bars, pubs and all-campus patties. Also:
emergency room waiting areas ("Is that a
steak knife lodged in your eye or are you
just happy to sec me?"), psychotherapy
sessions and funerals.
Q: With whom should I use iny pickup
line?
A: Anyone you want to sleep with.
Q: Even my ("hem TA?
A: No.That's just sick.
Q: She's a very attractive woman.
A: She's married and has two children.
Q: But I can offer her a brief escape

from a loveless marriage.
A: Where? In your one-room triple?
(J: I talked to my roommates. I'm
going to leave a soek on the door when
she's around. They're eool with it.
A: Well. 1 guess that's okay then.
Q: What do I do after I use the pickup
line?
A: There are two schools of thought on
the matter. The first school of thought is to
wait for her reaction, and then'if she does
n't slap you. offer to buy her a drink and go
from there.The second school of thought is
to run away immediately and then return a
few minutes later saying, "Man, there are
some pretty shady characters around here.
How arc you doing?" This works especial
ly well with the elderly.
Q: Can women also use pickup lines?
A: No.

I was sitting alone in my room one
weeknight drinking tepid vodka out of
a Care Bear mug, when I thought of
something that seemed — even for me —
really insightful.
"You know," 1 said out loud to the empty
room. "I'd really like to see pickup lines
come hack into style." The Care Bear on
the mug solemnly nodded in agreement.
