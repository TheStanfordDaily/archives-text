## 280 lbs on a scooter? You bet 
### AMIR MALAYERY 
Editor's note: This guest column was
scheduled to run on Friday, Oct. 28, but only
the first third was printed. Here is the whole
entertaining column.
The Oct. 7 column by Cassidy Krug and
Kevin Mclean ("Anti-athlete paranoia runs
wild"), in which they attempt to correct
some of the rumors and myths about ath
letes on campus, was interesting. 1 must say,
however, that last week's column ("Speed
ing athletes, but no Mercedes") was quite
counterproductive. Without getting too per
sonal, which could justifiably be done as you
took some pretty direct shots in last Friday's
Daily, I would like to clear up a few false as
sumptions and hopefully accomplish what
they tried to do a little over two weeks ago:
dispel beliefs of inequality.
The first mistake Krug and Mclean made
was not in their exaggerated "broken finger
nail" analogy of athletes unfairly receiving
treatment that would be denied to "scrawny
math majorjs]." Still, it's a pretty good start
ing point to explain a few things. (Their first
mistake, by the way, was their reference to
the "monstrous pack of four-wheelers
penned outside of Meyer Library." These
happen to be part of the fleet owned by the
Stanford Disability Resource Center.) Until
enforcement of the official University policy
was stepped up recently, anybody on campus
could technically get away with driving a golf
cart — athlete or non-athlete. Now it is a lit
tle more difficult to do so; several golf carts
around Arrillaga, owned by athletes, have al
ready been towed.
In regard to the amount of special treat
ment they say is reserved for injured ath
letes, they still have to present their situation
and ask for the number of a golf cart compa
ny so that they can rent a golf cart on their
OW n — the same steps an injured non-ath
lete would have to follow at the Disability
Resource Center.
Perhaps the reason you see more athletes
with golf carts, then, is because we are not

talking about broken fingernails; we're talk
ing about broken ankles and torn ACLs. Ac
tually, come to think of it, 1 have seen a large
number of non-athletes — both injured and
not — driving golf carts themselves. I would
even dare to say that those real fancy ones
you see, the E-Carts that look like golf carts
from the future, are for the most part owned
by non-athletes.
At this point, I'd like to include a tangent
of my own, because Krug and Mclean's tan
gent hit a little too close to home.
You see. my alternative campus trans
portation of choice is one of those cute little
motorized scooters they speak of — I'm that
"300-pound linebacker on the seat." First I
should clarify that while the average size of
professional and collegiate football players
has vastly increased in the last few decades, I
fail to recall any 300-pound linebackers in
the NFL or the NCAA. I can think of a lot of
300-pound linemen though.
Anyway, I'll admit that I might look like a
"grand spectacle" to those I pass on my
scooter. And while they may be smiling and
laughing, they aren't laughing at me, they're
laughing with me, because it's just plain fun
to have the wind in your face while you're
jetting around campus at roughly the same
speed or slower than the average biker with
out going through the chore of pedaling.
So why do I ride a scooter? Do I think
I'm a badass football player because I have
something others don't? No. Do I feel like
Harry and Lloyd in "Dumb and Dumber" on
their way to Aspen? Sometimes. Am I just
too plain lazy to bike? Probably. But after
waking up at 5:15 a.m. in the dead of winter
every day of the week and going through
three hours of running and lifting weights
only to finish and realize that most of cam
pus hasn t even thought of waking up yet, it's
kind of nice to not have to use any more than
steering muscles.
The point is, though, that the scooter you
see me driving around was not at the football
program's "disposal" — I paid for it com-
pletely on my own. And at just $159
online (almost the same as an adult
bike at your local Wal-Mart), you too
might feel that giving up the pedal
ing is worth it.
Now back to the original topic.
Just like the scooters, the golf carts
you see football players driving
around are not given out to them as
a reward for winning. The football

program does not provide its players
with golf carts; they are bought with
the players' own money. Most, in
fact, were originally purchased as a
result of injury because buying is
cheaper than renting a golf cart for
several months. So while high-pro
file sports on campus may be identi
fied by the number of seats they fill,
they can't be noted for the number
of golf carts they drive.
This point, however, makes me
believe that the real reason Krug and
Mclean target fellow athletes in their
column is actually because of the un
equal support on campus for differ

ent teams. Their motives are under
standable, but their methods are un
fitting. Personally, I feel it would be
easier for them to gain support
through their initial approach of uni
fication rather than through last
week's attempt to detract support
from the football program.
And guys, if you wanted to ride in
a golf cart that badly, all you had to
do was ask — they might even let
you honk the horn.

to have the wind in your face while you're
jetting around campus at roughly the same
speed or slower than the average biker with
out going through the chore of pedaling.
So why do I ride a scooter? Do I think
I'm a badass football player because I have
something others don't? No. Do I feel like
Harry and Lloyd in "Dumb and Dumber" on
their way to Aspen? Sometimes. Am I just
too plain lazy to bike? Probably. But after
waking up at 5:15 a.m. in the dead of winter
every day of the week and going through
three hours of running and lifting weights
only to finish and realize that most of cam
pus hasn t even thought of waking up yet, it's
kind of nice to not have to use any more than
steering muscles.
The point is, though, that the scooter you
see me driving around was not at the football
program's "disposal" — I paid for it com-
pletely on my own. And at just $159
online (almost the same as an adult
bike at your local Wal-Mart), you too
might feel that giving up the pedal
ing is worth it.
Now back to the original topic.
Just like the scooters, the golf carts
you see football players driving
around are not given out to them as
a reward for winning. The football

program does not provide its players
with golf carts; they are bought with
the players' own money. Most, in
fact, were originally purchased as a
result of injury because buying is
cheaper than renting a golf cart for
several months. So while high-pro
file sports on campus may be identi
fied by the number of seats they fill,
they can't be noted for the number
of golf carts they drive.
This point, however, makes me
believe that the real reason Krug and
Mclean target fellow athletes in their
column is actually because of the un
equal support on campus for differ

ent teams. Their motives are under
standable, but their methods are un
fitting. Personally, I feel it would be
easier for them to gain support
through their initial approach of uni
fication rather than through last
week's attempt to detract support
from the football program.
And guys, if you wanted to ride in
a golf cart that badly, all you had to
do was ask — they might even let
you honk the horn.

Editor's note: This guest column was
scheduled to run on Friday, Oct. 28, but only
the first third was printed. Here is the whole
entertaining column.
The Oct. 7 column by Cassidy Krug and
Kevin Mclean ("Anti-athlete paranoia runs
wild"), in which they attempt to correct
some of the rumors and myths about ath
letes on campus, was interesting. 1 must say,
however, that last week's column ("Speed
ing athletes, but no Mercedes") was quite
counterproductive. Without getting too per
sonal, which could justifiably be done as you
took some pretty direct shots in last Friday's
Daily, I would like to clear up a few false as
sumptions and hopefully accomplish what
they tried to do a little over two weeks ago:
dispel beliefs of inequality.
The first mistake Krug and Mclean made
was not in their exaggerated "broken finger
nail" analogy of athletes unfairly receiving
treatment that would be denied to "scrawny
math majorjs]." Still, it's a pretty good start
ing point to explain a few things. (Their first
mistake, by the way, was their reference to
the "monstrous pack of four-wheelers
penned outside of Meyer Library." These
happen to be part of the fleet owned by the
Stanford Disability Resource Center.) Until
enforcement of the official University policy
was stepped up recently, anybody on campus
could technically get away with driving a golf
cart — athlete or non-athlete. Now it is a lit
tle more difficult to do so; several golf carts
around Arrillaga, owned by athletes, have al
ready been towed.
In regard to the amount of special treat
ment they say is reserved for injured ath
letes, they still have to present their situation
and ask for the number of a golf cart compa
ny so that they can rent a golf cart on their
OW n — the same steps an injured non-ath
lete would have to follow at the Disability
Resource Center.
Perhaps the reason you see more athletes
with golf carts, then, is because we are not

talking about broken fingernails; we're talk
ing about broken ankles and torn ACLs. Ac
tually, come to think of it, 1 have seen a large
number of non-athletes — both injured and
not — driving golf carts themselves. I would
even dare to say that those real fancy ones
you see, the E-Carts that look like golf carts
from the future, are for the most part owned
by non-athletes.
At this point, I'd like to include a tangent
of my own, because Krug and Mclean's tan
gent hit a little too close to home.
You see. my alternative campus trans
portation of choice is one of those cute little
motorized scooters they speak of — I'm that
"300-pound linebacker on the seat." First I
should clarify that while the average size of
professional and collegiate football players
has vastly increased in the last few decades, I
fail to recall any 300-pound linebackers in
the NFL or the NCAA. I can think of a lot of
300-pound linemen though.
Anyway, I'll admit that I might look like a
"grand spectacle" to those I pass on my
scooter. And while they may be smiling and
laughing, they aren't laughing at me, they're
laughing with me, because it's just plain fun
to have the wind in your face while you're
jetting around campus at roughly the same
speed or slower than the average biker with
