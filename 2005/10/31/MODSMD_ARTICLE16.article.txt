# Pimped out hearse ride
## 
### 
1 attended Sigma Nu's Moonsplash this
past Saturday. If you didn't see me, it was
because I was under the right elbow of
some guy 1 didn't know, between three slight
ly inebriated freshman girls from Cedro and
on top of what smelled like the remains of last
year's partiers. It was crowded.
Yahoo! Music sponsored it. meaning that
in addition to beer and cases of mono being
given out, we had MP3 players that are only
compatible with Czech music formats.
Synergy also had a party, and because 1
have a thing for girls who can fire-dance. 1 at
tended that for the duration of my Saturday
night instead of staying at Moonsplash. In
contrast to Yahoo! Music, the only sponsor
fora Synergy party usually is "black light hip
pie face-paint."
I wrote a column last year about how Stan
ford was selling out part of itself by having
Maples drown out the student section with var
ious ads and corporate-bought time slots. But in
this case, I think Sigma Nu may be actually onto
something by getting corporate sponsorship.
The idea isn't exactly new. Full Moon on
the Quad is about as organized, corporately
approved and wholesome as could be. Next
year they really want sponsorship to jazz up
this tradition, which some feel has become
"tame." I've heard that in addition to Full
Moon being sponsored by Scope, organizers
are going to have vaccines and inoculations
provided by the American Pharmaceutical
Company. Maybe have the Office of Reli
gious Life sponsor the event, so that we can

have even more administrators to ensure
there is space between participants "for the
Holy Spirit." Maybe they can get the Par
tridge Family to come and sing.
But what if we got sponsorship for things
that couldn't exist otherwise â€” like the Mau
soleum Party? Granted, it'd be hard to entice
your typical company to sponsor it. Somehow
dancing at a gravesite would seem like a poor
tie-in to most companies' products. For exam
ple, having the National Pork Institute adver
tise "the other white meat" right beside a
gravesite would be in the same category as
hiring Scooter Libby to explain the Funda
mental Standard.
But what if we got a hearse company to
sponsor the event?
Hear me out here. Instead of Marguerite
stops, we could have "black carriage" rides
with you and your friends! Wouldn't that be
fun!? And the hearse company, which will be
called something cheery like "Jet Black Cars"
or "Compassionate Rides" or "Eternal Ac
commodations," can then quietly plug their
company's unique service. They'd have little

signs that say "The Stanfords would have
driven in a Compassionate Car" or "Next
time you go to a Mausoleum, wouldn't it be
nice to be in a Jet Black Car?" We wouldn't
even notice the ads, most likely, because as
college students, without the words "free
food," our brains don't even process them.
At the party, we could also get the sponsor
ing company's employees to dress up for the
occasion. Again, if we get a hearse company
or maybe a funeral home, then we'd already
be set. And as an added bonus, hearse drivers
and funeral home employees would probably
make great security people. 1 imagine every
employee of a funeral home, from pallbearers
to receptionists, would be as large and impos
ing as The Undertaker of WWF fame. In their
line of work, they've probably seen a whole
lot worse than whatever mixture of tequila,
cheap beer and sexual frustration a Branner
pre-party can dish out.
We, the student body, would in turn get the
Mausoleum Party we so earnestly want. And
we could bypass the whole ASSU bureaucra
cy (motto: "to serve and protect you from
dangerous fliering policies"). So 1 guess what
I'm saying is, although people are going to be
complaining, that's not going to help any.
There's always next year, so let's think of so
lutions. Like burying the ASSU in the Mau
soleum with the Stanfords.

Chris is a senior, so there is no "maybe next
year" for him. Send complaints to cholt@stan
