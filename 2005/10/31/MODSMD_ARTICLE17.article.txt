# Polishing your image? Run for office

As with so many other aspects of global
society, the American media has some
distinctive features that the media in
other Western democracies don't. Take politi
cal ads as an example. In most European
countries,political ads are forbidden by law. In
the U.S.,however, they are the meat-and-bone
of sub-presidential campaigns — because
these races receive little news coverage —
and they also play an important role at the
presidential level. Political ads in this country
strike me as being surprisingly similar to the
propaganda put forth by non-democratic
regimes.
In the early stages of campaigns, candi
dates broadcast biographical ads to introduce
themselves to the public. What I object to is
not the candidates' endeavor to make them
selves known to the electorate, but rather the
melodramatic tone of these ads.
They're all about overcoming rough begin
nings, having inherited strong American val
ues from one's parents and displaying the can
didate's patriotism and military prowess. If
they existed in written form, they would be the
ideal beginning to cheesy epics or novels from
the romantic era. They're akin to propaganda
because they don't tell you how candidates'
personal attributes are linked to their political

agendas. They capitalize on emotions, hoping
the symbols they (all too obviously) use will
win voters' sympathies before the more
"issue-based" portion of the campaign.
After bio ads, candidates typically broad
cast either "image ads" — which are just a
succession of "feel-good" images — or "issue
ads." which address past performance and fu
ture policies. Image ads are usually reserved
for popular incumbents, who don't feel the
need to explicitly justify and highlight their
performance of the past four years in the early
stages of the campaign.They generally feature
images of happy children, American flags and
hig suburban homes — as in one of Ronald
Reagan's image ads of 1984 where, after show
ing a succession of positive images (the result
of his four years in office, obviously), he asks:
"Arc you better off than you were four years

ago?" Images of happy children and big sub
urban homes don't tell voters how well Rea
gan ran the country during his first term, or
what his plan for the next four years is. But
they do try to influence voters on the basis of
alluring images.
Even "issue ads" can be very similar to
propaganda. In 1984, Reagan's team issued an
ad that became known as the "Bear in the
Woods" ad, which equated the Soviet threat to
a bear lurking in the forest. The announcer
says: "There is a bear in the woods. For some
people the bear is easy to see. Others don't see
it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Oth
ers say it's vicious and dangerous. Since no one
can really be sure who's right, isn't it smart to
be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear?"
The narrator's tone is ominous, but he is very
vague about the nature of the threat, since he
doesn't explicitly mention the Soviets. In what
ways exactly do the Soviets represent a threat
to the U.S.? What is Reagan's plan to make the
U.S. "as strong as the bear?" These questions
aren't answered, and the ad only succeeds in
instilling a sense of fear in the viewer.
Last year, George W. Bush broadcast an ad
inspired by the "Bear in the Woods" ad, which
