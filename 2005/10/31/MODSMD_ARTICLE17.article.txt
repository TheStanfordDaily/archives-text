# Polishing your image? Run for office

As with so many other aspects of global
society, the American media has some
distinctive features that the media in
other Western democracies don't. Take politi
cal ads as an example. In most European
countries,political ads are forbidden by law. In
the U.S.,however, they are the meat-and-bone
of sub-presidential campaigns — because
these races receive little news coverage —
and they also play an important role at the
presidential level. Political ads in this country
strike me as being surprisingly similar to the
propaganda put forth by non-democratic
regimes.
In the early stages of campaigns, candi
dates broadcast biographical ads to introduce
themselves to the public. What I object to is
not the candidates' endeavor to make them
selves known to the electorate, but rather the
melodramatic tone of these ads.
They're all about overcoming rough begin
nings, having inherited strong American val
ues from one's parents and displaying the can
didate's patriotism and military prowess. If
they existed in written form, they would be the
ideal beginning to cheesy epics or novels from
the romantic era. They're akin to propaganda
because they don't tell you how candidates'
personal attributes are linked to their political

agendas. They capitalize on emotions, hoping
the symbols they (all too obviously) use will
win voters' sympathies before the more
"issue-based" portion of the campaign.
After bio ads, candidates typically broad
cast either "image ads" — which are just a
succession of "feel-good" images — or "issue
ads." which address past performance and fu
ture policies. Image ads are usually reserved
for popular incumbents, who don't feel the
need to explicitly justify and highlight their
performance of the past four years in the early
stages of the campaign.They generally feature
images of happy children, American flags and
hig suburban homes — as in one of Ronald
Reagan's image ads of 1984 where, after show
ing a succession of positive images (the result
of his four years in office, obviously), he asks:
"Arc you better off than you were four years

ago?" Images of happy children and big sub
urban homes don't tell voters how well Rea
gan ran the country during his first term, or
what his plan for the next four years is. But
they do try to influence voters on the basis of
alluring images.
Even "issue ads" can be very similar to
propaganda. In 1984, Reagan's team issued an
ad that became known as the "Bear in the
Woods" ad, which equated the Soviet threat to
a bear lurking in the forest. The announcer
says: "There is a bear in the woods. For some
people the bear is easy to see. Others don't see
it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Oth
ers say it's vicious and dangerous. Since no one
can really be sure who's right, isn't it smart to
be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear?"
The narrator's tone is ominous, but he is very
vague about the nature of the threat, since he
doesn't explicitly mention the Soviets. In what
ways exactly do the Soviets represent a threat
to the U.S.? What is Reagan's plan to make the
U.S. "as strong as the bear?" These questions
aren't answered, and the ad only succeeds in
instilling a sense of fear in the viewer.
Last year, George W. Bush broadcast an ad
inspired by the "Bear in the Woods" ad, which


Laure

featured wolves ready to attack. The
announcer says:"In an increasingly
dangerous world... Even after the first
terrorist attack on America ... John
Kerry and the liberals in Congress
voted to slash America's intelligence
operations. By six billion dollars...
Cuts so deep they would have weak
ened America's defenses. And weak
ness attracts those who are waiting to

do America harm." Although this an
nouncer is a lot more precise than the
announcer in the Reagan ad, the
point is the same, to capitalize on peo
ple's without telling voters how Bush
plans on fighting terrorism or how his
plan differs from Kerry's. It keeps
voters ignorant on substantive issues
while targeting their emotions.
Although I recognize the quasi
impossibility of this proposal, I be
lieve banning or strongly regulating
political ads would make the Amer
ican political system a lot healthier.
In many different ways, each more
creative than the next, ads evade

substantive issues and foster cyni
cism in the American public by their
negativity. They are little more than
a carefully-assembled appeal on im
ages and sound — and voters de
serve better.
A concluding note: Even though
the three ads 1 mentioned are Repub
lican, my argument holds true for the
Democratic ads as well. This article is
not meant to be partisan; the exam
ples just happened to fall that way.

Woods" ad, which equated the Soviet threat to
a bear lurking in the forest. The announcer
says: "There is a bear in the woods. For some
people the bear is easy to see. Others don't see
it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Oth
ers say it's vicious and dangerous. Since no one
can really be sure who's right, isn't it smart to
be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear?"
The narrator's tone is ominous, but he is very
vague about the nature of the threat, since he
doesn't explicitly mention the Soviets. In what
ways exactly do the Soviets represent a threat
to the U.S.? What is Reagan's plan to make the
U.S. "as strong as the bear?" These questions
aren't answered, and the ad only succeeds in
instilling a sense of fear in the viewer.
Last year, George W. Bush broadcast an ad
inspired by the "Bear in the Woods" ad, which

featured wolves ready to attack. The
announcer says:"In an increasingly
dangerous world... Even after the first
terrorist attack on America ... John
Kerry and the liberals in Congress
voted to slash America's intelligence
operations. By six billion dollars...
Cuts so deep they would have weak
ened America's defenses. And weak
ness attracts those who are waiting to

do America harm." Although this an
nouncer is a lot more precise than the
announcer in the Reagan ad, the
point is the same, to capitalize on peo
ple's without telling voters how Bush
plans on fighting terrorism or how his
plan differs from Kerry's. It keeps
voters ignorant on substantive issues
while targeting their emotions.
Although I recognize the quasi
impossibility of this proposal, I be
lieve banning or strongly regulating
political ads would make the Amer
ican political system a lot healthier.
In many different ways, each more
creative than the next, ads evade

substantive issues and foster cyni
cism in the American public by their
negativity. They are little more than
a carefully-assembled appeal on im
ages and sound — and voters de
serve better.
A concluding note: Even though
the three ads 1 mentioned are Repub
lican, my argument holds true for the
Democratic ads as well. This article is
not meant to be partisan; the exam
ples just happened to fall that way.

As with so many other aspects of global
society, the American media has some
distinctive features that the media in
other Western democracies don't. Take politi
cal ads as an example. In most European
countries,political ads are forbidden by law. In
the U.S.,however, they are the meat-and-bone
of sub-presidential campaigns — because
these races receive little news coverage —
and they also play an important role at the
presidential level. Political ads in this country
strike me as being surprisingly similar to the
propaganda put forth by non-democratic
regimes.
In the early stages of campaigns, candi
dates broadcast biographical ads to introduce
themselves to the public. What I object to is
not the candidates' endeavor to make them
selves known to the electorate, but rather the
melodramatic tone of these ads.
They're all about overcoming rough begin
nings, having inherited strong American val
ues from one's parents and displaying the can
didate's patriotism and military prowess. If
they existed in written form, they would be the
ideal beginning to cheesy epics or novels from
the romantic era. They're akin to propaganda
because they don't tell you how candidates'
personal attributes are linked to their political

agendas. They capitalize on emotions, hoping
the symbols they (all too obviously) use will
win voters' sympathies before the more
"issue-based" portion of the campaign.
After bio ads, candidates typically broad
cast either "image ads" — which are just a
succession of "feel-good" images — or "issue
ads." which address past performance and fu
ture policies. Image ads are usually reserved
for popular incumbents, who don't feel the
need to explicitly justify and highlight their
performance of the past four years in the early
stages of the campaign.They generally feature
images of happy children, American flags and
hig suburban homes — as in one of Ronald
Reagan's image ads of 1984 where, after show
ing a succession of positive images (the result
of his four years in office, obviously), he asks:
"Arc you better off than you were four years

ago?" Images of happy children and big sub
urban homes don't tell voters how well Rea
gan ran the country during his first term, or
what his plan for the next four years is. But
they do try to influence voters on the basis of
alluring images.
Even "issue ads" can be very similar to
propaganda. In 1984, Reagan's team issued an
