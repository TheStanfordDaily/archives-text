## SFCU donates to Katrina relief 
### KELLEY FONG 
The Stanford Federal Credit
Union (SFCU) announced early
in September that it had estab
lished a $10,000 fund to match
contributions to the American
Red Cross for relief efforts for
Hurricane Katrina victims from
SFCU members and credit union
employees.
Members and employees re
sponded quickly Though the tally is
by no means over. 71 members have
donated over $15,600 through Oct.
21, according to SFCU President
and CEO John Davis. In addition,
25 SFCU employees contributed
over $3,000 to the Red Cross hurri
cane relief effort.
Fulfilling the promise to match
member and employee contribu
tions, Davis delivered a $10,000
check to the Palo Alto Area Red
Cross last week.
"When the call for assistance
through the Red Cross for Katrina
victims was announced, the board
of directors of the credit union sup
ported the idea of a matching fund,"
Davis said.
Davis added, "The idea to help
the victims came from several
SFCU employees and the method
of communication to the members
of our matching funds was primari
ly through our Web site."
SFCU not only matched mem
ber and employee donations, but
also facilitated the donation
process. Members could donate
directly to the Red Cross disas

ter fund through the SFCU Web
site.
According to Trish Bubenik, ex
ecutive director of the Palo Alto
Area Red Cross, the funds raised
have been sent to the Red Cross na
tional office in Washington, D.C.
There, "(the funds] help provide
hot meals for the same number of
people as would sit down to dinner
in all of San Francisco — over
700,000 hot meals served," Bubenik
said. "They also help with shelter
and cleanup efforts."
The SFCU's partnership with
the Red Cross is strong. In 2003 it
was named the Premier Partner of
the Palo Alto Area Red Cross, and
in 2004 it was named to the Clara
Barton Society, an organization
that honors groups and individuals
for their efforts in aiding the or
ganization.
"This partnership is very posi
tive," Bubenik said. "In addition to
SFCU helping sponsor its local
chapter's major fundraising events,
they've partnered with us in re
sponding to national disasters. In
turn, we've partnered with them in
providing preparedness training for
the staff at SFCU."
In addition to its monetary con
tribution to the Red Cross, SFCU is
also making an effort to assist indi
viduals residing in hurricane-affect
ed areas.
"We attempted to reach — by e
mail, U.S. mail and phone — all the
members [in the affected area] who
had loans with us, and we've been
able to get in touch with about 20

percent of them," Davis said.
Davis added that SFCU is offer
ing financial assistance to these
members in the form of "relief on
payment for loans, waiving of inter
est, etc., as they may need."
The Credit Union's commit
ment to the community is in accor
dance with its philosophy of "peo
ple helping people." A statement
from the SFCU monthly newsletter
reads, "Credit unions are founded
by people working together to
wards economic advancement,
uniting people seeking a way to im
prove their future."
Davis affirmed this philosophy.
"We have a tremendous regard
for the Stanford community," he
said. "We define it very broadly —
the community is not only the peo
ple on campus, but also alumni and
all the people who interact with
Stanford on a regular basis, whether
through employment, sports, etc.
There are many activities that the
Credit Union supports either di
rectly or indirectly."
Many members and employees
said they were already planning to
contribute to the hurricane relief
effort and that the SFCU's pledge
to match donations only strength
ened their desire to chip in.
"My wife and I had intended to
donate, and when we were about to
do so, the Credit Union came up
with the plan of doing a matched
donation up to a certain dollar
amount," said Andrew Vorhees, an
SFCU employee. "It was just a win
win situation."
