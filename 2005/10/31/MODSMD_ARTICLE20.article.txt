## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Women score two wins Cardinal win three game sweeps over Oregon schools 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With freshman outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza sidelined for the rest of the sea
son, the No. 5 Cardinal volleyball team (20-
3,9-2 Pacific-10 Conference) looks to the
rest of the offense to step up and take con
trol. In a pair of three-game sweeps this
weekend, junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards and freshman middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo did just that.
The pair combined for 34 kills in Thurs
day's victory over Oregon (11-11, 1-10),
with 17 apiece, and achieved the same Fri
day against Oregon State (8-10,4-8), with
Richards contributing 19 and Akinradewo
15.They hit .593 and .565, respectively, with
a combined five hitting errors to lead the
way against the Beavers.
Since Barboza tore her ACL a week
ago, Akinradewo — already one of the top
players in the country in hitting percentage
— has been hitting better and getting more
balls. Richards has been taking swings
from the back row as well as the front,
making good use of her dynamic jumping
and powerful arm swing to get kills in
every rotation.
"[Richards] has always wanted the ball
and now she is getting it," head coach John
Dunning said. "Kristin really wants to step
up for the team and carry a bigger load,
which she has done so far."
Though it is hard to fill a hole in the line
up, the team has done admirably
Sophomore Franci Girard, a middle
blocker who converted early this year to
the right side hitter position.got the start in
the outside hitter spot and was error-free
against the Beavers with six kills and a .300
hitting percentage.

"Franci stepped in with a lot of focus on
her and did a really nice job," Dunning
said. "The whole group really tried to raise
the level of play which you have to do
when you lose someone as big an impact as
Cynthia."
Freshman defensive specialist Jessica
Fishburn. who regularly comes in to serve
for the Cardinal, has been staying on the
court longer to play defense, and she post
ed two aces and eight digs this weekend.
The Stanford net game also stepped up
in Barboza's absence, out-blocking OSU
nine blocks to three. Junior Lizzie Suiter,
playing two consecutive full matches for
the first time this season, led the way, tally
ing four blocks. Akinradewo, sophomore
setter Bryn Kehoe and junior right side Nji
Nnamani had three apiece, including one
solo block each.
In the back row. Richards led the Cardi
nal digging effort, tying senior libero
Courtney Schultz with a match-high 10
digs. Schultz is currently 13 away from her
thousandth career dig, a milestone that
Richards reached earlier this season.
One of the biggest improvements for
Stanford came at the service line, where
the team has recently faced problems with
consistency.The Cardinal missed only four
serves in the match and tallied seven serv
ice aces, including three from Akinradewo,
who only began serving regularly after
Barboza's injury forced changes in the
lineup.
The Cardinal had an easy time settling
into their new lineup and dispatched Ore
gon State, who lost some momentum from
the five-game upset victory over No. 15
California the night before.
Stanford took the first point of game one
and would not relinquish the lead, going up
by as much as 17 before taking the 30-14 vic
tory on a kill by Nnamani. Early in the
