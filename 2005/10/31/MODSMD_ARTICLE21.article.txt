### DAISY CHEN 
It was redemption for the Cardinal as the
women's swimming and diving squad fin
ished off seventh-ranked Texas at the Avery
Aquatic Center this weekend with a 192-156
victory. TTie Cardinal are now undefeated for
eight consecutive dual meets and have a per
fect record (2-0) this season.
Last season, the Longhorns handed the
Cardinal their only dual meet loss, 197-156.
On Friday, a Longhorn team of Elizabeth
Wycliffe, Elizabeth Ttnnon, Katie Robinson
and Hee-Jin Chang began the meet with a
win in the 200-yard medley relay with a time
of 1:43.05. The foursome overpowered the
Cardinal squad by .06 seconds. The meet
ended with another Longhorn win in the
400-yard freestyle relay in a time of 3:26.19,
with a team comprised of Chang,
Robinson, Kristin Siminski and Ja
clyn Faulkner.
But despite the Longhorn's victo
ries, Stanford pulled off the win, and
Stanford's exhibition team — made
up of junior Desiree Stahley, fresh
man Madeline Rovira and sopho
mores Brooke Bishop and Erica Liu
— in the same event (4(K) free) at
tained the event's fastest time of
3:25:37. The same squad captured the
2(X)-yard free relay and simultaneous
ly broke a pool record in a time of
1:33.55.
Bishop was the star performer of
the meet, posting four individual vic
tories and two wins with relay teams.

In addition, she was an integral factor
in the record-breaking relay time in
the 4(X) free.
On Friday,she clinched victories in
the 200-yard backstroke event with a
time of 1:56.75. an NCAA "A" time.
That mark bested her previous per
sonal best (1:59.20) by almost three
seconds. She also captured the 1(K)-
yard free in 50.22, at the NCAA "B"
mark. On Saturday, she won the 50-
yard free in 23.04 and the 1 (K)-yard
back in 54.51; both were considered
NCAA "B" times.
Cardinal head coach Lea Maurer
praised her sophomore standout.
"Brooke was rock solid," she said.
"She is a tremendous leader both in
and out of the pool."
Maurer also called Texas a very
good team. But the Stanford squad
proved, at least this weekend, that the
Longhorns were not up to par.
Aside from Bishop's strong per

formance,senior Dana Kirk and jun
ior Lauren Costella were individual
title winners in the 200-yard fly (in
2:00.52) and the 1,650-yard free (in
16:34.16) events, respectively. Both
were also impressive NCAA "B"
times. Stahley and junior Morgan
Hentzen also acquired "B" marks
with their respective second- and
third-place finishes in the 1,650 free
(16:38.09 and 16:43.21).
Liu and senior Kristin Caverly fin
ished a respective third and second in
the 100-yard breast event in 1:03.64
and 1:03.73.
"I'm really proud of the way we
swam today," Maurer said after the
first half of the meet on Friday. Those
feelings were likely repeated after the
completion of the entire meet.
The Cardinal are scheduled to
travel south to UC-Irvine this week
end to compete in the Big West
Shootout.
