# MEN'S GOLF
## Consistency key at tourney 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With several recent disappoint
ing finishes behind them, the men's
golf team looks fora turnaround of
its current downhill trend at the
Cordevalle Collegiate Classic,
which takes place today and tomor
row in San Martin, Calif.
The Cardinal have have been
drifting southward the past few
weeks, finishing sixth at The
MacKenzie, tying for seventh at The
Prestige at PGA West and, most re
cently, placing 17th at the Isleworth
Collegiate Invitational.
Coach Conrad Ray is hoping for
a change of direction in the men's
game and believes the team's mood
is conducive to one.
"I think the guys understand that
they haven't played up to their abil
ity the last couple weeks," he said.
"So, I think that the attitude's good
because they're hungry to have a
good week and a good showing."
Poor third rounds have bogged
down the Cardinal and have con

tributed the most to the team's dis
appointing finishes. I"he men have
done well in earlier rounds, with
close-to and even-pars, hut they
seem unable to continue their level
of play in their final efforts — they
experienced 17 and 28 more strokes
in the third round than the second at
the Mackenzie and Isleworth in
vites, respectively.
"We've been working hard in
practice and doing the right thing —
it just hasn't happened on the
course," Ray said.
Consistency is key for the Cardi
nal and two solid rounds today need
to be followed by a solid third round
tomorrow on the par-72 Cordevalle
Country Club course in order to en
sure an improved performance.
However, the team afso faces a
challenge in the absence of its lead
performer, sophomore Rob Grube.
After a difficult schedule the past
few weeks, Grube has opted to
focus on schoolwork during the
tournament.
