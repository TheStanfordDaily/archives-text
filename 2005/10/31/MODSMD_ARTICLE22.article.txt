# MEN'S GOLF
## Consistency key at tourney 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With several recent disappoint
ing finishes behind them, the men's
golf team looks fora turnaround of
its current downhill trend at the
Cordevalle Collegiate Classic,
which takes place today and tomor
row in San Martin, Calif.
The Cardinal have have been
drifting southward the past few
weeks, finishing sixth at The
MacKenzie, tying for seventh at The
Prestige at PGA West and, most re
cently, placing 17th at the Isleworth
Collegiate Invitational.
Coach Conrad Ray is hoping for
a change of direction in the men's
game and believes the team's mood
is conducive to one.
"I think the guys understand that
they haven't played up to their abil
ity the last couple weeks," he said.
"So, I think that the attitude's good
because they're hungry to have a
good week and a good showing."
Poor third rounds have bogged
down the Cardinal and have con

tributed the most to the team's dis
appointing finishes. I"he men have
done well in earlier rounds, with
close-to and even-pars, hut they
seem unable to continue their level
of play in their final efforts — they
experienced 17 and 28 more strokes
in the third round than the second at
the Mackenzie and Isleworth in
vites, respectively.
"We've been working hard in
practice and doing the right thing —
it just hasn't happened on the
course," Ray said.
Consistency is key for the Cardi
nal and two solid rounds today need
to be followed by a solid third round
tomorrow on the par-72 Cordevalle
Country Club course in order to en
sure an improved performance.
However, the team afso faces a
challenge in the absence of its lead
performer, sophomore Rob Grube.
After a difficult schedule the past
few weeks, Grube has opted to
focus on schoolwork during the
tournament.

Sophomore Rob Grub will not be competing for
the Cardinal in the upcoming Cordevalle
tounament, taking a break to focus on studies.
As a result, three juniors — Matt
Savage, Zack Miller and Matt Shin
— and two freshmen — Dodge
Kemmer and Daniel Lim — are set
to represent Stanford.
"I think the guys that are here are
anxious to play well,and I'm looking
forward to good things," Ray said.
The Cardinal will be measured
against strong competition, howev
er. The field includes 14 other teams,
nine of which are ranked in the top
50 in the nation. Most notable

among those are Pacific-10 Confer
ence rivals such as No. 5 UCLA, No.
11 Washington, California and Ari
zona State.The team's finish against
them will determine district rank
ings and thus seeding in the post
season.
Still, a high finish is not the
team's main focus at the Cordevalle.
"At the end of the day, we all like
to finish high, hut I'd just like to see
more consistent play out of the guys
individually and see some good
scores individually," Ray said.
After the Isleworth invitational,
the team focused largely on its short
game, which should help with its
overall scores. But three solid
rounds are dependent on more than

just practice.
"1 think a lot of it boils down to
execution," Ray said. "It's not be
cause the guys are preparing the
wrong way or making bad decisions
— it's just a matter of making the
shots that they need to in certain cir
cumstances. I think that only comes
from confidence and experience."
This week is another opportunity
to gain that experience and Ray
hopes his team will take advantage
Of it.
"I'm not super-concerned about
where we end up in the field at the
end," he said. "Seeing the guys make
some progress, make some good de
cisions and have their hard work pay
off is what I'm looking for."
