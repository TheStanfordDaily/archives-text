# The 						White Sox take out their dirty laundry
## 
### 
In a year when baseball was wracked with scandal,
it is fitting that the Chicago White Sox — a team
with no superstars and with an average payroll —
restored a bit of confidence in fair play by winning the
World Series. The last time the sport saw corruption
this widespread, the White Sox were at the center of it,
when the 1919 team threw the World Series. The
"Black Sox" have been blamed ever since on Chica
go's south side for the team's 86-year drought as
World Champions.
Like the steroid issue, the "Black Sox" fix hit closer
to problems at the heart of the game than most could
imagine. Up until two years ago, Chicago's park was
named after the man who arguably did the most to in
cite the scandal: Charles Comiskey,the team's founder
and owner at the time.
Comiskey was wealthy enough to provide the
funds for the ballpark that his team played in until
1991. But he was so stingy that he refused to pay for the
team's laundry service, leading some of the players to
grumblingly rename themselves "Black Sox." The
nickname came to stand for the scandal that engulfed
baseball when the commissioner. Judge Kenesaw
Mountain Landis. banned the eight players involved, a
group that included "Shoeless" Joe Jackson.
The original meaning of "Black Sox" ironically
complements its later implication:The team threw the
series, in part, because of their owner's famously tight
purse strings. Simply put. they needed the money. Be
cause of the reserve clause — which made a player the
property of his team until traded, forcing him to either
accept his salary or retire — Comiskey could dictate
how much (or little) he wanted to tender each of them.
He occasionally resorted to underhand tactics to
avoid paying up. Eddie Cicotte's contract promised
the star hurler a $ 1 (),(XK) bonus if he won 30 games in a
season. After Cicotte won his 29th in 1919, Comiskey
ordered him benched for the rest of the season, though
Cicotte needed the money to mortgage his farm.
When approached with the plan to throw the Series,
Cicotte requested — and received — exactly $1(),(XX).
In an article published in the New York Times after
the White Sox advanced to this year's Series, Dave An
derson wrote that the "honest" players, including star
second baseman Eddie Collins, celebrated the indict
ments by going out to dinner. But the rift between the
players — "I thought you couldn't win without team
work until I joined the White Sox." Collins once said
— had more to do with class. Collins' faction was edu
cated and therefore better able to negotiate in a pre
agent landscape. "Black Sox" ringleader Chick
Gandil's contingent was poorer and in most cases un
educated — Jackson signed his name with an 'X.'
The $15,(XX) annual salary that Collins negotiated
when he arrived in a 1915 trade with the Philadelphia
Athletics was roughly triple Cicotte's $S,(XX) and Jack
son's $6.(XX), though Jackson was arguably the better
player. The infielders were so resentful of Collins, they
refused to throw the ball to him in pre-game warm-ups
throughout the season.
The players who accepted the money violated the
sport's founding principles as well as the trust of the
fans. Still, the scandal was more a reflection of base
ball's unjust economic system. Until the reserve clause
was overturned and free agency established in 1975,
players had few rights. They could do little to protest
their wages but hold out, as Sandy Koufax and Don

Howell

Drysdale famously did before the
1%6 season — for the staggering sum
of $1 million. An arbitrator threw out
the reserve clause in 1975.
In the era of free agency, players
have often been accused of playing
solely for money. But greed has al
ways been a part of the game. A con
flicted Jackson tried to report the
scandal to his owner during the series.
But Comiskey, who had heard the ru
mors, locked his door to keep Jackson
out; he didn't want to hear it. Me
would cash in on the extra box office
revenue whether his team won or lost.
If the scandal stayed under wraps, he
might have a chance to do the same if
his talented squad advanced to the
Series the next year, as well.
Jackson sent Comiskey a letter de
tailing the plot after the series had
ended, but the owner publicly defend
ed his team. He was as guilty as third
baseman Buck Weaver, who was in
dicted for not reporting the fix,
though he backed out of it. But in
stead of being shamed, Comiskey was
posthumously enshrined in Cooper
stown's inaugural class in 1939. Jack
son. owner of the third-highest bat
ting average in baseball history, was
noticeably absent from the ceremony.
Landis was likewise more intent
on cleaning up baseball's image than
in repairing the game itself, a feat with
which he has often been credited. He
forbid the eight "Black Sox" to play
again when it became clear that they
were ruining the game's reputation,
but covered up another gambling
scandal that might have sullied base
ball's lore irreparably.
Ty Cobb and THs Speaker, also
members of the Hall's inaugural class,
now both player-managers in the twi
light of their careers, met under the
bleachers before a meaningless late
season game between the Tigers and

Indians, their respective clubs. Both
agreed to bet on the Tigers in that
day's contest as bars of sunlight fell on
the dust swirling around them.
Landis smothered the scandal, de
spite receiving a written confession
from Cobb. It would have been a
death knell, perhaps, for the game's
credibility. Like Comiskey, Landis
was more concerned with baseball's
marketability than with its integrity.
Is the manner in which they dealt
with the game's corruption signifi
cantly different from the way that
owners and the commissioner deal
with it now? With a steroid policy that
is little more than a slap on the wrist,
implemented more than 10 years
after performance-enhancers burst
on the scene (and only after players
publicly admitted to using them), it
seems as if commissioner Bud Selig
reluctantly established a rule that
would cut back on crowd-pleasing
home runs and perhaps attendance.
Selig sounded a bit like Captain
Renault in "Casablanca." "I am
shocked, shocked to find that gam
bling is going on in here!" Renault
says at one point to Rick, before one
of Rick's employees hands the em
barrassed officer his winnings.
When the "Black Sox" were bring
ing customers through the turnstiles,
Comiskey was just as happy to collect
the money as the gamblers were to
take theirs. But he was also quick to
deride the players when their roles
became increasingly clear to the pub
lic. Let's hope history' doesn't remem
ber the black deed that eight men
committed one fall and gloss over the
injustice in the sport. Let's hope histo
ry doesn't forget the real lesson of the
"Black Sox" — that the ethical sys
tem of baseball revolves around one
sacred principle.
Money.
