# The
						White Sox take out their dirty laundry
## 
### 
In a year when baseball was wracked with scandal,
it is fitting that the Chicago White Sox — a team
with no superstars and with an average payroll —
restored a bit of confidence in fair play by winning the
World Series. The last time the sport saw corruption
this widespread, the White Sox were at the center of it,
when the 1919 team threw the World Series. The
"Black Sox" have been blamed ever since on Chica
go's south side for the team's 86-year drought as
World Champions.
Like the steroid issue, the "Black Sox" fix hit closer
to problems at the heart of the game than most could
imagine. Up until two years ago, Chicago's park was
named after the man who arguably did the most to in
cite the scandal: Charles Comiskey,the team's founder
and owner at the time.
Comiskey was wealthy enough to provide the
funds for the ballpark that his team played in until
1991. But he was so stingy that he refused to pay for the
team's laundry service, leading some of the players to
grumblingly rename themselves "Black Sox." The
nickname came to stand for the scandal that engulfed
baseball when the commissioner. Judge Kenesaw
Mountain Landis. banned the eight players involved, a
group that included "Shoeless" Joe Jackson.
The original meaning of "Black Sox" ironically
complements its later implication:The team threw the
series, in part, because of their owner's famously tight
purse strings. Simply put. they needed the money. Be
cause of the reserve clause — which made a player the
property of his team until traded, forcing him to either
accept his salary or retire — Comiskey could dictate
how much (or little) he wanted to tender each of them.
He occasionally resorted to underhand tactics to
avoid paying up. Eddie Cicotte's contract promised
the star hurler a $ 1 (),(XK) bonus if he won 30 games in a
season. After Cicotte won his 29th in 1919, Comiskey
ordered him benched for the rest of the season, though
Cicotte needed the money to mortgage his farm.
When approached with the plan to throw the Series,
Cicotte requested — and received — exactly $1(),(XX).
In an article published in the New York Times after
the White Sox advanced to this year's Series, Dave An
derson wrote that the "honest" players, including star
second baseman Eddie Collins, celebrated the indict
ments by going out to dinner. But the rift between the
players — "I thought you couldn't win without team
work until I joined the White Sox." Collins once said
— had more to do with class. Collins' faction was edu
cated and therefore better able to negotiate in a pre
agent landscape. "Black Sox" ringleader Chick
Gandil's contingent was poorer and in most cases un
educated — Jackson signed his name with an 'X.'
The $15,(XX) annual salary that Collins negotiated
when he arrived in a 1915 trade with the Philadelphia
Athletics was roughly triple Cicotte's $S,(XX) and Jack
son's $6.(XX), though Jackson was arguably the better
player. The infielders were so resentful of Collins, they
refused to throw the ball to him in pre-game warm-ups
throughout the season.
The players who accepted the money violated the
sport's founding principles as well as the trust of the
fans. Still, the scandal was more a reflection of base
ball's unjust economic system. Until the reserve clause
was overturned and free agency established in 1975,
players had few rights. They could do little to protest
their wages but hold out, as Sandy Koufax and Don
