## Hawaii tourney awaits Stanford 
### DEVIN MARSH 
Fifteen teams — including the Cardinal — from across
the county are set to converge on the island of Hawaii this
week fora couple of days on the green.
The Stanford women's golf team has been preparing all
week for the three-day Kent Youel Invitational.The team
travels to Kapolei. Hawaii and begins play tomorrow on
the par 72,6,189-yard course.
Last year. UCLA, who is not in attendance this year
dominated the tournament. Now. the Cardinal faces a rad
ically different field than they did in 2(M)4's tournament,
with only four returning teams: Denver, Fresno State,
Santa Clara and host Hawaii. This week's 15 team field
also includes California, Long Beach State, Nevada, San
Diego State, Kentucky, Southern California and Texas
Tech.
Last week, the Cardinal turned in a relatively disap
pointing team performance at the Stanford/Pepsi Invita
tional. However, there are some bright spots. Freshman
Mari Chun turned in a great individual effort, shooting a
215, two over par, and tying for l()th place individually. Se
nior Kelly Husted was second on the team with an eight
over par.
Look for juniors Lauren Todd and Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana to bounce back from last weekend's tourna
ment and turn in better individual performances this
week.
"We have been working hard, and although we had a
couple of rough days, we are ready to be the team to beat,"
Chun said.
Last week, the Cardinal faced six top 10 teams, and 14
top 25 teams at the Stanford Golf Course. The Cardinal

face a much less competitive field this weekend in Hawaii.
The only other top 25 teams are No. 9 USC and No. 21
ranked California. Southern California finished in third
place with 11 over par at the Stanford/Pepsi Invite. At 36
over par. the Cardinal finished in a tie for ninth place with
Cal.
USC and Cal are the only other Pac-1() teams in atten
dance, and a strong performance by the Stanford women
could improve their conference standing. Play at the Kent
Youel Invitational runs through Wednesday.
