# Jane Stanford's watch returned
## 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearly a century ago, at a time
when Stanford University was
strapped for funds, Jane Stanford's
watch was sold by the University to
help buy books. This week, Palo Alto
entrepreneur and software engineer
Pierre Schwob bought the watch and
returned it to the University.
According to an article in The San
Jose Mercury News, the watch was
being stored in a vault in the suburbs
of Pittsburgh, Penn. Schwob found it
when it was posted on eßay and
promptly bought it for $28,(KH). He
said in the article that his only re
quirement for the donation is that
the watch not be sold again.
At an elegant lunch last week,
Schwob and several special guests,
Stanford archivist Margaret Kimball
among them, celebrated the return
of the watch.
"I'm thrilled to be able to wel
come Jane's pocket watch home,"
Kimball told The Mercury News.
The watch was bought by Leland
Stanford Sr. in San Francisco in 1867
as a gift for Jane. At the time, Jane
was 39 years old and about one
month pregnant with Leland Junior.
After its first sale, the history of
the watch is unrecorded. A jeweler in
South Park, Penn. just recently redis
covered its identity and posted it for
sale on the Internet.
"Jane gave it up to benefit the

University during lean times — and
as such, it has special significance in
Stanford's history," Kimball said.
The book fund that the watch
helped start is now valued at over
$750,000.
Jane's watch is not the first dona
tion that Schwob has made to Stan
ford, nor the largest. He started a $1
million endowment for the Kavli In
stitute for Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology, based at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, and
helped to build a computing and in
formation center.
Schwob is not a graduate of Stan
ford but is deeply committed to the
University. Born in Geneva, Switzer
land. he was a mediocre student,
barely completing high school and
going on to just six months of college.
Today, however, his academic
past seems to have little affect on his
achievements. A World Wide Web pi
oneer. he founded the PRS corpora
tion in Palo Alto and has several
valuable patents to his name. He
started the Classical Music Archives
in 1994, the largest collection of clas
sical music on the Web, and has au
thored three books — one an an
thology of historical documents, one
on chess openings and one on pocket
calculators.
Schwob told The Mercury News
that missing out on a college educa
tion was his only regret in life.
"I would have loved Stanford." he
said."! do what I can to help.There is

something very special about Stan
ford. It's one of the few places in the
world that — whomever you meet
— there is always something to
learn."
Kimball and many others said
they are extremely grateful for
Schwob's donation and have prom
ised that the watch will not be sold
again. It will soon be put on display in
the University's museum.
