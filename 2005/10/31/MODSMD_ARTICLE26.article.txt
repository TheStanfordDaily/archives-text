A study conducted by Stanford
Medical School's Center for Interdis
ciplinary Brain Sciences Research re
cently made a breakthrough regard
ing the development of schizophre
nia, indicating a genetic defect as a po
tential predictor of the disease.The re
sults of the research lay the frame
work for further understanding and
treatment of schizophrenia.
Post-doctoral research fellow
Doron Gothelf, first author of the
study, published these findings in the
Oct. 23 issue of Nature Neuro
science. Gothelf and his team studied
patients with a mutation on one of
the two copies of the 22nd chromo
some. One-third of people with this
mutation generally become schizo
phrenic.
"We focused on a homogenous
group of subjects with a genetic syn
drome," Gothelf said. "Schizophren
ics have psychosis and hallucinations,
but many things can cause these. It's
hard to study what can cause it since
the causes are so heterogeneous.
When you know this is a problem,
there's a more homogenous group to
study."
Gothelf and his team conducted a
longitudinal study, following subjects

for five years during adolescence and
exploring which patients are likely to
develop schizophrenia. He focused
on 24 children with the mutation,
seven of whom developed schizo
phrenia.
By studying one of the missing
genes on the 22nd chromosome that
encodes a protein impacting
dopamine levels. Catechol-O-methyl
transferase (COMT), the researchers
observed that those with a dopamine
deficiency experienced the most seri
ous problems with schizophrenia.
"These patients only have one
copy of the gene because it's deleted,"
Gothelf said. "If the remaining one
designates low activity, they're in trou
ble. We don't just show the associa
tion, but we see the pathway that leads
to psychosis."
Schizophrenia occurs in about 1
percent of the world population, and
typically leads to agitation, catatonia
and psychosis.
"It's a disorder of thought," said
Wendy Kates, associate professor of
psychiatry at the State University of
New York Upstate Medical Universi
ty, in an interview with Top Tech News.
"People hear voices that aren't really
there, and they experience delusions."
Gothelf emphasized the impor
tance of studying the disease in chil

dren and said the need for such re
search helped motivate his project.
" This is a topic neglected in child
psychiatry," he said. "Children with
developmental disabilities need spe
cial care. They have learning issues
and medical issues, so they need a lot
of help."
With the stabilization of dopamine
levels, this disease could become
treatable or curable. This study may
pave the way for new medical treat
ment that could potentially be initiat
ed before the onset of symptoms.
Gothelf noted the absence of a di
rect and obvious connection between
this genetic research and possible
treatment, but he emphasized the im
portance of the discovery in medica
tion trials.
"We think that medication should
try to manipulate the activity of the
COMT enzyme." he said. "Optimiz
ing this activity is important in maxi
mizing the cognitive function of the
patients. Psychogenetics is an emerg
ing field — when you give an antipsy
chotic medicine to subjects, not all of
them respond. You want to have a
more scientific way to see who will
benefit and who will not. Those who
have the lowest COMT levels will
probably benefit a lot from antipsy
chotic medication."
