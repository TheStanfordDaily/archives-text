# Card nearly pull off upset
## Strong, balanced attack not enough to hold off UCLA run 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
As awful as Stanford felt after
blowing a three-possession lead to
UC-Davis Sept. 17, the Cardinal
took solace at the time, believing
that such a collapse was unlikely to
occur again. After Saturday's heart
wrenching 30-27 overtime loss to
UCLA, that small comfort is gone.
In one of the most hyped con
tests on the Farm in years — and in
front of a Stanford Stadium season
high 42,850 —the No. 8 UCLA
Bruins (8-0, 5-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) erased a 24-3 deficit with
three straight touchdowns in the
final 7:04. After a Stanford field goal
in overtime, UCLA quarterback
Drew Olson lofted a 23-yard corner
route to wide receiver Brandon
Breazell, as the Bruins snapped
Stanford's (4-3, 3-2 Pac-10) three
game win-streak and kept their per
fect season alive.
Despite an emphasis on finishing
ballgames, Stanford has struggled in
the fourth quarter this season, post
ing just 26 points to opponents' 82.
Saturday's contest was no excep
tion, as Stanford gave up four plays
longer than 20 yards after the third
quarter, despite allowing only two
prior to that point.
"We just let them off the hook
with the deep ball," coach Walt Har
ris said.
"We had them," said senior run
ning back J.R. Lemon, who notched
103 total yards and two touchdowns
in his first start this season. "You've
just got to step on their necks when
you have the chance."
Credit goes to UCLA, though, as
the Bruins adjusted their offensive
strategy just in time for their late
game heroics.
"They started running a hurry
up offense, which limited our calls
because we couldn't huddle up,"
said junior cornerback Nick

Sanchez, who forced and recovered
a fumble. "They also ran a lot of
screens and draws."
Many of those late plays went to
running back Maurice Drew, whose
175 all-purpose yards on the day (82
rushing, 89 receiving, six returning)
made him UCLA's all-time leader
in the category. Drew's six-yard run
with 7:04 left cut Stanford's lead to
24-10, while his one-yard dive with
46 seconds to play in regulation tied
the contest at 24-all.
For the Cardinal, Lemon scored
on a 13-yard screen in the first quar
ter and a nine-yard screen in the
third quarter, giving Stanford a 14-3
lead after 45 minutes of play. Nick
Frank punched in a seven-yard run
early in the fourth, and 40- and 42-
yard field goals from senior kicker
Michael Sgroi rounded out Stan
ford's scoring.
However, Stanford failed to con
vert several other scoring opportu
nities, punting four times in Bruin
territory. Nine Cardinal penalties
for 87 yards — both season-highs
— were one reason for Stanford's
stalled drives.
"We were real good in the penal
ty area until this game," Harris said.
"We took a victory away from our
selves."
Stanford's offense also suffered
from the injury of junior wide re
ceiver Mark Bradford, who left the
game midway through the first
quarter with an ankle sprain. After
snagging a career-high 185 yards
and two touchdowns last week
against Arizona State, Bradford
caught only two passes for 21 yards
against UCLA.
"To lose a guy like that is pretty
hard on the offense," said junior
quarterback Trent Edwards, who
completed 18 of 25 passes for 169
yards and two touchdowns in the
loss.
With his two scores Saturday,
Edwards has now thrown for 12
touchdowns and zero interceptions
in his past four games, and his two
interceptions this season are the
fewest of any Pac-10 signal-caller.

"I wish there was something I could
say or do to ease the pain. But I cant."

a no interception performance, the failure to reach the endzone in OT cost Stanford.

lead in overtime loss

Edwards completed his first 10 at
tempts, misfiring until 2:08 into the
third quarter. However, the Los
Gatos native completed only three
of 10 passes in the fourth quarter and
overtime.
In marked contrast, Olson's first
completion came 2:08 into the sec
ond quarter, marking the Bruin's ini
tial first down. However, Olson com
pleted 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards in
the fourth quarter and overtime.
Though senior defensive end Ju
lian Jenkins and Sanchez each recov
ered a fumble, Stanford missed op
portunities to force several addition
al turnovers. Senior cornerback T.J.
Rushing dropped an interception off
his chest in the first quarter, while
senior outside linebacker Jon Alston
muffed a fumble recovery in the
third when he tried to return the
dropped ball fora touchdown.
Rushing was also beat on
Breazell's game-winning score.
"1 thought I was in pretty decent
shape," Rushing said."But whenever
it became time to make the play. I
didn't."
Sanchez was also disappointed
with his play in the closing minutes.
"Personally, it tore my heart out,"

Sanchez said. "I was one of the play
ers who got beat at the end of the
game. It hurts."
Harris sympathized with his play
ers' frustration.
"I feel real bad," Harris said. "I
told them 1 wish there was something

I could say or do to ease the pain. But
I can't."
The contest, Stanford's first-ever
overtime game, marks the Cardinal's
eighth straight loss to a top-10 oppo
nent. The Cardinal now prepare for
No. 1 USC.

game, gaining 61 yards on the ground and was instrumental in the Cardinal's success over three and a half quarters.
