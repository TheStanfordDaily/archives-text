### ADA YEE 
"The situation as we have it now is very worrying,"
said llan Pappe, a historian and professor from Haifa
University in Israel yesterday afternoon. In his talk,
Pappe emphasized how the Israeli disengagement from
the Gaza Strip in September has lowered prospects for
peace in the Middle East.
"There has been a crystallization of the Zionist posi
tion," Pappe said. "There has been an undermining of the
pluralist position in Israel."
Pappe explained that there has always been"a gap be
tween reality on the ground and representation" of the
situation in Israel. In American and even European
media, according to Pappe, Palestinians have been por
trayed as foolishly rejecting Israeli proposals for peace.
"However, I think there was a genuine debate inside
the Israeli society on how much of the Gaza Strip to give
up in order to enlarge the chances for peace," Pappe said.
He referred to rhetoric about a "flawed peace process"

and a need for Israeli and Palestinian cooperation, talk
that was once part of a spectrum of Israeli views.
According to Pappe. there has been a recent shift to
ward a unilateral pro-Israel position. However, he said
that the representation of the Gaza pullout has been por
trayed in American and European media in a manner
contrary to reality.
