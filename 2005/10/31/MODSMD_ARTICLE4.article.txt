## Israeli prof takes pro-Palestinian stance in speech 
### ADA YEE 
"The situation as we have it now is very worrying,"
said llan Pappe, a historian and professor from Haifa
University in Israel yesterday afternoon. In his talk,
Pappe emphasized how the Israeli disengagement from
the Gaza Strip in September has lowered prospects for
peace in the Middle East.
"There has been a crystallization of the Zionist posi
tion," Pappe said. "There has been an undermining of the
pluralist position in Israel."
Pappe explained that there has always been"a gap be
tween reality on the ground and representation" of the
situation in Israel. In American and even European
media, according to Pappe, Palestinians have been por
trayed as foolishly rejecting Israeli proposals for peace.
"However, I think there was a genuine debate inside
the Israeli society on how much of the Gaza Strip to give
up in order to enlarge the chances for peace," Pappe said.
He referred to rhetoric about a "flawed peace process"

and a need for Israeli and Palestinian cooperation, talk
that was once part of a spectrum of Israeli views.
According to Pappe. there has been a recent shift to
ward a unilateral pro-Israel position. However, he said
that the representation of the Gaza pullout has been por
trayed in American and European media in a manner
contrary to reality.


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Professor llan Pappe of Haifa University speaks yesterday
about withdrawal from the Gaza strip and a possibility of
peace in the Middle East.
Pappe explained that Israel with
drew from the area because of compli
cations for the Israeli army — not to
promote an Arab-Israeli peace. How
ever, he said that Israeli prime minis
ter Ariel Sharon has sometimes used
rhetoric that suggested Israel's move
was the beginning of "new period of
hope."
Pappe said that American and Eu
ropean media perpetuated the follow
ing ideas — first, that the Gaza pull
out is a generous Israeli gesture; and
second, this gesture was "foolishly ig
nored" by the Palestinians.
"Many Israelis were in fact sur
prised to hear this ploy described as
the beginning of a peace process," he
said."But once described by the West
ern media as such, the Israelis took it
on."
Pappe, who is himself Jewish, was
raised in Israel. He discussed Israeli
perceptions of Palestinians and how
they have developed.
"The majority of Jews think that
Palestinians are terrorists with whom
we have no future," he said."We know
about fears of being persecuted and
about being a minority, but this fear
has been manipulated so as to dehu
manize Palestinians. Palestinians are
not full of revenge. You will find that
mostly, they want a normal life."
By way of solution. Pappe drove
home this point — "the only way to
end the occupation is to bring pres
sure from the outside."

He added that while "energies are
there and bubbling," groups need to
unite in a single general effort. He
called on the Palestinian diaspora as
well as on Jews.
"Jews can be freed from the need
to talk through the Zionist prism." he
said.
Pappe spoke about his own role as
an academic in persuading people of
the right kind of action, among these
boycotting and divestment.
"I'm glad to be a part of this new
energy and to try and talk about and
play with the idea of a one-state solu
tion," Pappe said. "We need to go be
yond slogans."
Pappe's talk was followed by a
question and answer session. In re
sponse to a question about how solu
tions can be culled from those that
have succeeded in resolving ethnic
conflict throughout the world. Pappe
responded that he preferred a local
ized historical approach.
"I would rather work from a moral
imperative," he said.
One student contested Pappe s
claim that Israelis have become uni
lateral in their position toward Pales
tinians. She cited her own recent trav
els to Israel, during which she ob
served many Israelis staging protests
and other resistance to the disengage
ment. Pappe responded that these
groups "have lost" and that a unilater
al situation still exists.
Pappe s talk was attended by many
people outside the Stanford commu
nity, including activists and people in
terested in the Palestinian situation.
One of these was Rachelle Mar
shall. a free-lance editor and writer
who lives near Stanford. She is active

with the Stanford student group that
put on Pappe's talk, the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME).
"1 think everything he had to say
was inspiring," Marshall said. "He
called the occupation 'viscous,' which
1 think it is, and I think he emphasized
the gap between reality and its por
trayal in the mainstream media."
Akthani Jarrar. a resident of San
Jose who heard about the talk from
one of the organizers, agreed.
"It's good to see the point of view
of an Israeli who seems to me to be
more on the Palestinian side," he said.
"We need more people like that."
Senior Margit Zwemer, a History
major and Middle Easter Studies
minor, said. "It was interesting to hear
someone form the left kind of write
the obituary of the two-state solution,
to see that this whole thing isn't going
to work out."
Junior Tala Al-Ramahi is a mem
ber of CJME who attended the talk.
"I'm originally Palestinian and the
right of return is something that's
been impressed on me,"she said."The
talk was better than I expected. I had
n't known what Pappe's views were
on the right of return and the occupa
tion."
CMJE's co-president, junior
Olivia Sohns, was pleased with the di
verse turnout.
"This was a great talk because
there was a lot of dialogue with the au
dience," Sohns said. "You could tell
from the questions asked that people
came from different perspectives,"
Of Pappe's talk,she added,"! think
he discussed some deep issues around
the conflict, and he's a very knowl
edgeable person on this topic."
