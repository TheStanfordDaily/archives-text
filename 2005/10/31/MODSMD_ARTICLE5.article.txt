## Stadium will bring fans closer to action 
### ANNE RITCHIE STAFF WRITER 
Plans are in full swing for the Stanford Stadium's up
coming renovation. Scheduled to begin soon after the
football team's final home game versus Notre Dame on
Nov. 26, the remodeling should be complete before the
start of the 2006 season. While the architectural integri
ty of the old stadium will be preserved, many changes
are in store.
"Safety is the number one reason Stanford athletics is
rebuilding the stadium," said Ray Purpur, senior associate
athletic director.
Accordingly, changes include more comfortable seat
ing with backs on all seats and benches and an expansion
of the ingress and egress tunnels from four feet to seven
feet. Leg-room between seats will expand from 24 inches
to 30 inches and disabled seating will be increased from 67
to 502 seats.
The Athletic Department recently launched a Web
site, http://gostanford.com/stadium, to keep fans updat
ed throughout the construction process. According to
Stadium
size will be reduced

the Web site, in addition to safety reasons, by rebuilding
the stadium, the department also hopes to "create a dy
namic football experience for our fans, student-athletes
and the community and to establish annual revenue
streams to support the Athletic Department operating
budget."
Ibe current stadium was built in 1921 at a price of
$200,000 and was completed in a period of four months.
Since then, slight modifications have been made, but this
year's remodel will be the site's first major overhaul in its
84-year history.
Currently, the stadium has a capacity of 85,500. The
new stadium will cut this number by over 30.000 seats,
with a planned 50,000-person capacity. Average home
game attendance over the past eight years has been
39,000 fans, with only a few notable exceptions — includ
ing 50,000 attendees at games against UC-Berkeley, and
70,000 audience members for matches versus Notre
Dame and USC in recent years.
"The new venue will create a dynamic football expe
rience for our fans, from tailgating to pre-game to half
time to post game," Purpur said. "Stanford is committed
to a winning football program and the facilities that sup
port that goal. A new stadium means a solid financial fu
ture for the Athletic Department as a whole, guarantee
ing a reliable source of annual revenue for the benefit of
all of Stanford's varsity sports."
Fewer seats will allow a better viewing experience for
fans, as the overall "footprint" of the stadium will not
change at all, according to Purpur.
"The horizontal distance from the first usable seat to
the sideline will improve from the current distance of 115
feet to 45 feet, and the horizontal distance from the out
ermost seat to the sideline will improve from the current
distance of 265 feet to 180 feet." Purpur explained.
Sophomore football fan Julie Finkelstein said she
thinks making the stadium smaller is a good idea.
"The stadium is so big right now that it always looks
empty," she said. "That probably doesn't help player
morale."
Athletic Department representatives said they hope

that other fans will appreciate the smaller venue as well.
According to its Web site, "Current stadium design
and occupancy lends itself to a cavernous setting: there
fore, reducing seat capacity will create a more intimate,
up-close game day experience for all our fans."
The remodel is being funded by the Department of
Athletics. Physical Education and Recreation (DAPER)
Investment Fund and individual donors' contributions.
No long-term debt obligations are expected according to
Purpur.
Hoover and Associates, a firm with which Stanford
has had lots of experience, designed the new stadium.The
firm has also designed the Maples Pavilion renovation
and the Arrillaga Family Recreation Center, among
other structures. Vance Brown Builders of Palo Alto are
in charge of construction.
"The new stadium will truly mark the beginning of a
new era for Stanford Football," Purpur said. "With sup
port from alumni, faculty, staff, students and fans, the
University ana the Department of Athletics, the Cardinal
football team is poised to regain its national promi
nence."

Plans are in full swing for the Stanford Stadium's up
coming renovation. Scheduled to begin soon after the
football team's final home game versus Notre Dame on
Nov. 26, the remodeling should be complete before the
start of the 2006 season. While the architectural integri
ty of the old stadium will be preserved, many changes
are in store.
"Safety is the number one reason Stanford athletics is
rebuilding the stadium," said Ray Purpur, senior associate
athletic director.
Accordingly, changes include more comfortable seat
ing with backs on all seats and benches and an expansion
of the ingress and egress tunnels from four feet to seven
feet. Leg-room between seats will expand from 24 inches
to 30 inches and disabled seating will be increased from 67
to 502 seats.
The Athletic Department recently launched a Web
site, http://gostanford.com/stadium, to keep fans updat
ed throughout the construction process. According to
Stadium
size will be reduced

the Web site, in addition to safety reasons, by rebuilding
the stadium, the department also hopes to "create a dy
namic football experience for our fans, student-athletes
and the community and to establish annual revenue
streams to support the Athletic Department operating
budget."
Ibe current stadium was built in 1921 at a price of
$200,000 and was completed in a period of four months.
Since then, slight modifications have been made, but this
year's remodel will be the site's first major overhaul in its
84-year history.
Currently, the stadium has a capacity of 85,500. The
new stadium will cut this number by over 30.000 seats,
with a planned 50,000-person capacity. Average home
game attendance over the past eight years has been
39,000 fans, with only a few notable exceptions — includ
ing 50,000 attendees at games against UC-Berkeley, and
70,000 audience members for matches versus Notre
Dame and USC in recent years.
"The new venue will create a dynamic football expe
rience for our fans, from tailgating to pre-game to half
time to post game," Purpur said. "Stanford is committed
to a winning football program and the facilities that sup
port that goal. A new stadium means a solid financial fu
ture for the Athletic Department as a whole, guarantee
ing a reliable source of annual revenue for the benefit of
all of Stanford's varsity sports."
Fewer seats will allow a better viewing experience for
fans, as the overall "footprint" of the stadium will not
change at all, according to Purpur.
"The horizontal distance from the first usable seat to
the sideline will improve from the current distance of 115
feet to 45 feet, and the horizontal distance from the out
ermost seat to the sideline will improve from the current
distance of 265 feet to 180 feet." Purpur explained.

thinks making the stadium smaller is a good idea.
