## University buys new buildings in Redwood City 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Any campus tour guide would be happy to recite the fact
that Stanford is comprised of 8,180 acres, making it the sec
ond largest university campus in the world. Consequently,
one might be surprised to learn that the University, with
4,900 acres of open space recently purchased eight build
ings in Redwood City's Mid-Point Technology Park near
Highway 101 due to a squeeze for space.
Stanford does not have any immediate plans for the 29-
acre purchase with the one exception of a vacant building
that was constructed as a data center. It could provide space
for some University computer facilities, according to Direc
tor of Community Relations Jean McCown. The other
buildings are occupied by various businesses under existing
leases which will continue.
"On a longer term basis, the Redwood City properties
have potential for redevelopment and use fora mixture of
University and non-University uses," McCown said. "The
process of planning for that longer
term use will be done in collaboration
with Redwood City planners, the
local community near the site and the
City Council. The types of University
uses that might move to Redwood
City in the future are most likely to be
administrative offices that can work
effectively from an off-campus loca
tion and that don't involve functions
that need daily personal contact with
students and faculty."
In a recent interview with The
Stanford News Service, Provost John
Etchemendy and Director of Capital
Planning Margaret Dyer-Chamber
lain discussed the University's space
crunch. Etchemendy stated that the
problem is caused in part because of
restraints posed by the University's
General Use Permit (GUP) and in
part because of programmatic and re
search growth.
The 2000 Santa Clara County
Community Plan and GUP place
many restrictions that limit usage of
campus lands, he said.
The GUP permits only an addi
tional 2 million square-feet of aca
demic buildings," McCown said. "The
time horizon is at least 10 years and
likely longer than that. A significant
part of Stanford's land is not available
for this future development for at
least 20 years because there is an Aca
demic Growth Boundary that con
fines virtually all buildings to the core
campus. Furthermore, by University
policy and reinforced by the GUP,
areas like the Arboretum are com
mitted to be preserved as open
space."
As a result. Etchemendy stated

that the University is in need of more
off-site space.
Etchemendy identified the recent
purchase of the 46-acre campus,
which includes the eight existing
buildings in the Mid-Point Technolo
gy Park, as one such off-campus
space. The University's other off-site
properties include two warehouses in
Livermore and Newark in the East
Bay used for library and bookstore
storage, a small property in East Palo
Alto for the Law School Clinic and
facilities such as the Bass Center for
the Stanford in Washington program
and the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove.
"We are also considering changing
space allocation policies by introduc
ing a space charge," Etchemendy
continued. "You can imagine a sys
tem in which we charge rent for every
square foot of building space. Then
we would allocate to units a certain
amount of general funds to pay for
the space they need to house their
people and programs. In such a sys
tem, departments would have an in
centive to allow their inefficiently
used space to be used — perhaps
temporarily — by other units. We'd
end up with an internal market for
space that would, in theory, make the
allocation of space more efficient
without requiring central control."
In addition to these two proposals.
Capital Planning has been using a set
of guidelines developed in 2(X)3 to
ease the space crunch.
"Our studies have suggested that
we have more space than we think."
said Dyer-Chamberlain to The Stan
ford News Service. "We just need to
repurpose it wisely and capital plan
ning can and does help. Across cam
pus, there can certainly be more office
sharing, more cubicle environments,
fewer second offices and more strate
gic use of storage space."

square foot of building space. Then
we would allocate to units a certain
amount of general funds to pay for
the space they need to house their
people and programs. In such a sys
tem, departments would have an in
centive to allow their inefficiently
used space to be used — perhaps
temporarily — by other units. We'd
end up with an internal market for
space that would, in theory, make the
allocation of space more efficient
without requiring central control."
In addition to these two proposals.
Capital Planning has been using a set
of guidelines developed in 2(X)3 to
ease the space crunch.
"Our studies have suggested that
we have more space than we think."
said Dyer-Chamberlain to The Stan

repurpose it wisely and capital plan
ning can and does help. Across cam
pus, there can certainly be more office
sharing, more cubicle environments,
fewer second offices and more strate
gic use of storage space."
Any campus tour guide would be happy to recite the fact
that Stanford is comprised of 8,180 acres, making it the sec
ond largest university campus in the world. Consequently,
one might be surprised to learn that the University, with
4,900 acres of open space recently purchased eight build
ings in Redwood City's Mid-Point Technology Park near
Highway 101 due to a squeeze for space.
Stanford does not have any immediate plans for the 29-
acre purchase with the one exception of a vacant building
that was constructed as a data center. It could provide space
for some University computer facilities, according to Direc
tor of Community Relations Jean McCown. The other
buildings are occupied by various businesses under existing
leases which will continue.
"On a longer term basis, the Redwood City properties
have potential for redevelopment and use fora mixture of
University and non-University uses," McCown said. "The
process of planning for that longer
term use will be done in collaboration
with Redwood City planners, the
local community near the site and the
City Council. The types of University
uses that might move to Redwood
City in the future are most likely to be
administrative offices that can work
effectively from an off-campus loca
tion and that don't involve functions
that need daily personal contact with
students and faculty."
In a recent interview with The
Stanford News Service, Provost John
Etchemendy and Director of Capital
Planning Margaret Dyer-Chamber
lain discussed the University's space
crunch. Etchemendy stated that the
problem is caused in part because of
restraints posed by the University's
General Use Permit (GUP) and in
part because of programmatic and re
search growth.
The 2000 Santa Clara County
Community Plan and GUP place
many restrictions that limit usage of
campus lands, he said.
The GUP permits only an addi
tional 2 million square-feet of aca
demic buildings," McCown said. "The
time horizon is at least 10 years and
likely longer than that. A significant
part of Stanford's land is not available
for this future development for at
least 20 years because there is an Aca
demic Growth Boundary that con
fines virtually all buildings to the core
campus. Furthermore, by University
policy and reinforced by the GUP,
areas like the Arboretum are com
mitted to be preserved as open
space."
As a result. Etchemendy stated

that the University is in need of more
off-site space.
Etchemendy identified the recent
purchase of the 46-acre campus,
which includes the eight existing
buildings in the Mid-Point Technolo
gy Park, as one such off-campus
space. The University's other off-site
properties include two warehouses in
Livermore and Newark in the East
Bay used for library and bookstore
storage, a small property in East Palo
Alto for the Law School Clinic and
facilities such as the Bass Center for
the Stanford in Washington program
and the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove.
"We are also considering changing
space allocation policies by introduc
ing a space charge," Etchemendy
continued. "You can imagine a sys
tem in which we charge rent for every
square foot of building space. Then
we would allocate to units a certain
amount of general funds to pay for
the space they need to house their
people and programs. In such a sys
tem, departments would have an in
centive to allow their inefficiently
used space to be used — perhaps
temporarily — by other units. We'd
end up with an internal market for
space that would, in theory, make the
allocation of space more efficient
without requiring central control."
