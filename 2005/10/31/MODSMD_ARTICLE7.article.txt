## Fundraising exceeds expectations 
### ALLISON DEDRICK 
Students, get ready to donate to
your alma mater after you graduate
because Stanford now has a new
record to beat; this past year was
Stanford's most successful fundrais
ing year ever. The 2(X)4-2005 fiscal
year, which ended on Aug. 31,
brought in a grand total of $603.6
million — approximately 15 percent
up from the $524 million raised the
year before.
The money will be allocated to
different areas of the University, ac
cording to the wishes of the donors.
Of the total raised, $ 160.2 million will
go to research, $62.6 million to finan
cial aid for graduate and undergrad
uate students, $55 million to faculty
support and the creation of new pro
fessorships and $22.6 million to
building projects and equipment.
Vice President of the Office of
Development Martin Shell said that
students will definitely feel the im
pact of this successful fundraising
campaign.

"More than half of the money
from The Stanford Fund goes direct
ly to financial aid ," Shell said.
He added that there have also
been many gifts to facilities on cam
pus and"a number of new faculty po
sitions were created this year" as a
result of the contributions.
Donors can designate their
money to go toward specific pro
grams. meaning that much of the
money is "earmarked" for certain
causes. Some unrestricted gifts are
also given, referred to as "expend
able dollars." As an example. Shell
mentioned The Stanford Fund,
which solicits unrestricted gifts from
undergraduate alumni and parents.
These gifts are then allocated by the
dean to the programs in most need.
Fundraising is done by many dif
ferent groups; the record-breaking
number this year represents the total
gifts given to the University as a
whole. In addition to the University
Office of Development, all of the un
dergraduate and graduate schools
have offices of development and do

their own fundraising.
Shell said he thought one reason
Stanford's fundraising campaign was
particularly successful this year was
because the University has many
"new emerging ideas" and "individu
als are responding to this philan
thropically."
"They see the need for the Uni
versity to move forward in these di
rections and want to help," Shell said.
"They can do so financially."
Specifically, Shell said that donors
responded to the initiatives Stanford
has created — the Initiative on
Human Health, the Initiative on
Environmental Sustainability and
the International Initiative.launched
in 1999. 2004 and 2005 respectively.
The initiatives are focused on "how
Stanford can help address critical,
complex challenges facing the real
world," Shell said, stressing that they
make use of the "wealth of collabora
tive and interdisciplinary resources"
at Stanford.
