WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Democratic leader said
Sunday that presidential adviser
Karl Rove should resign because of
his role in the exposing of a CIA of
ficer's identity, and a veteran Re
publican senator said President
Bush needs "new blood" in his
White House.
Rove has not been charged, but
the investigation continues in the
case that brought the indictment
and resignation Friday of I. Lewis
"Scooter" Libby, the top aide to
Vice President Dick Cheney.
Senate Democratic leader
Harry Reid said Sunday he was dis
appointed that Bush and Cheney
responded to the indictment by
lauding Libby. He suggested they
should apologize for the leak that
revealed the identity of covert CIA
officer Valerie Plame, whose hus
band, former ambassador Joseph
Wilson, has been critical of the
Bush administration.

"First of all. the vice president is
sues this very terse statement prais
ing Libby for all the great things he's
done," Reid said. "TTien we have the
president come on camera a few
minutes later calling him Scooter
and what a great patriot he is."
"There has not been an apology
to the American people for this ob
vious problem in the White
House," Reid. D-Nev., told ABC's
"This Week."
Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn„ said
on "Fox News Sunday" that Ch
eney should "come clean" about his
involvement and why he discussed
Plame with Libby before Libby
spoke to reporters about her.
"What did the vice president
know? What were his intentions?"
Dodd said. "Now, there's no sug
gestion the vice president is guilty
of any crime here whatsoever. But
if our standard is just criminality,
then we're never going to get to the
bottom of this."
Democrats appearing on Sun
day talk shows portrayed Libby's
indictment as one of many serious

problems surrounding the White
House and one of several allega
tions raising questions about Re
publican ethics.
Republicans repeatedly said the
charges have been made against
only one individual and that Libby
should be presumed innocent until
proven guilty.
When it comes to public opin
ion, 46 percent of people surveyed
for an ABC News-Washington Post
poll said the level of ethics and hon
esty in the federal government had
fallen with Bush as president.
Republican Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi said Sunday that Bush
should be on the lookout for "new
blood, new energy, qualified staff,
new people in administration."
Libby was not charged with the
crime that the grand jury was creat
ed to investigate- specifically, who
leaked the name of Plame to re
porters in 2003. Libby and Rove
were named by reporters brought
before the grand jury, but it was un
clear whether they knew that she
was a covert agent.

CHARGES AGAINST LIBBY
If found guilty of all charges, the vice presi
dent's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby
(left), could face as much as 30 years in prison
and $1.25 million in fines.
Allegations in the
22-page indictment
One count of obstruction of justice
Charged with "knowingly deceiving" the
grand jury about when and how he found
out the identity of Valerie Plame
Two counts of false statements
"Knowingly and willfully misleading" FBI
agents in response to questions about his
contacts with the media
Two counts of perjury
Accused of knowingly lying to the grand
jury under oath

B Without Rosa Parks' bravery,
Rice says she 'would not be
standing here today'
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Rosa Parks was remem
bered Sunday by hundreds of mourners for her defiant act on
a city bus that inspired the civil rights movement and helped
pave the way for other blacks, including Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.
Rice said she and others who grew up in Alabama during
the height of Parks' activism might not have realized her im
pact on their lives, "but 1 can honestly say that without Mrs.
Parks, I probably would not be standing here today as secre
tary of state."
Parks, 92. died Monday at her home in Detroit. Her casket
was flown to Washington after the memorial service in Mont
gomery and will lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Parks was
the first woman granted that honor.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate Democratic leader said
Sunday that presidential adviser
Karl Rove should resign because of
his role in the exposing of a CIA of
ficer's identity, and a veteran Re
publican senator said President
Bush needs "new blood" in his
White House.
Rove has not been charged, but
the investigation continues in the
case that brought the indictment
and resignation Friday of I. Lewis
"Scooter" Libby, the top aide to
Vice President Dick Cheney.
Senate Democratic leader
Harry Reid said Sunday he was dis
appointed that Bush and Cheney
responded to the indictment by
lauding Libby. He suggested they
should apologize for the leak that
revealed the identity of covert CIA
officer Valerie Plame, whose hus
band, former ambassador Joseph
Wilson, has been critical of the
Bush administration.

"First of all. the vice president is
sues this very terse statement prais
ing Libby for all the great things he's
done," Reid said. "TTien we have the
president come on camera a few
minutes later calling him Scooter
and what a great patriot he is."
"There has not been an apology
to the American people for this ob
vious problem in the White
House," Reid. D-Nev., told ABC's
"This Week."
Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn„ said
on "Fox News Sunday" that Ch
eney should "come clean" about his
involvement and why he discussed
Plame with Libby before Libby
spoke to reporters about her.
"What did the vice president
know? What were his intentions?"
Dodd said. "Now, there's no sug
gestion the vice president is guilty
of any crime here whatsoever. But
if our standard is just criminality,
then we're never going to get to the
bottom of this."
Democrats appearing on Sun
day talk shows portrayed Libby's
indictment as one of many serious

problems surrounding the White
House and one of several allega
tions raising questions about Re
publican ethics.
Republicans repeatedly said the
charges have been made against
only one individual and that Libby
should be presumed innocent until
proven guilty.
When it comes to public opin
ion, 46 percent of people surveyed
for an ABC News-Washington Post
poll said the level of ethics and hon
esty in the federal government had
fallen with Bush as president.
Republican Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi said Sunday that Bush
should be on the lookout for "new
blood, new energy, qualified staff,
new people in administration."
Libby was not charged with the
crime that the grand jury was creat
ed to investigate- specifically, who
leaked the name of Plame to re
porters in 2003. Libby and Rove
were named by reporters brought
before the grand jury, but it was un
clear whether they knew that she
was a covert agent.

CHARGES AGAINST LIBBY
If found guilty of all charges, the vice presi
dent's chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby
(left), could face as much as 30 years in prison
and $1.25 million in fines.
Allegations in the
22-page indictment
One count of obstruction of justice
Charged with "knowingly deceiving" the
grand jury about when and how he found
out the identity of Valerie Plame
Two counts of false statements
"Knowingly and willfully misleading" FBI
agents in response to questions about his
contacts with the media
Two counts of perjury
Accused of knowingly lying to the grand
jury under oath

B Without Rosa Parks' bravery,
Rice says she 'would not be

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Rosa Parks was remem

a city bus that inspired the civil rights movement and helped
pave the way for other blacks, including Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.
Rice said she and others who grew up in Alabama during
the height of Parks' activism might not have realized her im
pact on their lives, "but 1 can honestly say that without Mrs.
Parks, I probably would not be standing here today as secre
tary of state."
Parks, 92. died Monday at her home in Detroit. Her casket
was flown to Washington after the memorial service in Mont

the first woman granted that honor.
