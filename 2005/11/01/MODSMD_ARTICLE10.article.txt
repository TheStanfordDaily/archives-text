UNITED NATIONS (AP) —
The U.N Security Council unani
mously adopted a resolution yester
day demanding Syria's full coopera
tion with a UN. investigation into the
assassination of Lebanon's former
prime minister and warning of possi
ble "further action" if it doesn't.
The United States, France and
Britain pressed for the resolution
following last week's tough report
by the U.N. investigating commis
sion, which implicated top Syrian
and Lebanese security officials in
the Feb. 14 bombing that killed
Rafik Hariri and 20 others.
The report also accused Syria
of not cooperating fully with the
inquiry.
The three co-sponsors agreed to
drop a direct threat of sanctions
against Syria in order to get support
from Russia and China, which op
posed sanctions while the investiga
tion is still under way.
Nonetheless, the resolution was
adopted under Chapter VII of the
U.N. Charter, which is militarily en
forceable.
The resolution requires Syria to
detain anyone the U.N. investiga
tors consider a suspect and let inves
tigators determine the location and
conditions under which the individ
ual would be questioned. It also
would freeze assets and impose a
travel ban on anyone identified as a
suspect by the commission.
Those provisions could pose a
problem for Syrian President
Bashar Assad, as well as his brother,
Maher Assad, and his brother-in
law, Assef Shawkat, the chief of mil
itary intelligence.

The Syrian leader has refused a
request from the chief U.N investi
gator to be interviewed. Investiga
tors also want to question his broth
er and brother-in-law.
The U.S. invited foreign minis
ters of the 15 Security Council na
tions to attend the meeting to send a
strong message to Syria to cooper
ate with the inquiry, and a dozen
ministers showed up, including Sec
retary of State Condoleezza Rice
and ministers from Russia, China,
Britain and France.
Rice told the council that Syria
had been put on notice by the inter
national community that it must co
operate with the inquiry by German
prosecutor Detlev Mehlis.
"With our decision today, we
show that Syria has isolated itself
from the international community
— through its false statements, its
support for terrorism, its interfer
ence in the affairs of its neighbors,
and its destabilizing behavior in the
Middle East," Rice said. "Now, the
Syrian government must make a
strategic decision to fundamentally
change its behavior."
"The Chapter VII resolution
that we are passing today is the only
way to compel the Syrian govern
ment to accept the just demands of
the United Nations and to cooper
ate fully with the Mehlis investiga
tion," she said.
British Foreign Secretary Jack
Straw said the Security Council is
"putting the government of Syria on
notice that our patience has limits."
"The people of the Lebanon
have become all too acquainted
with grief," he said. "We owe them a
better future, and this resolution is
one way of providing them with that
better future."
