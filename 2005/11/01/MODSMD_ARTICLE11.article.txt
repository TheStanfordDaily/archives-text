## Manning your DESTINY Remote-controlled humans on the horizon, says Japanese tech firm 
### SAGAR BAPAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
We've all heard of remote-controlled cars and
remote-controlled TVs — but remote-con
trolled humans?
This is exactly what the top Japanese telephone
company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company
(NTT) has in mind. It is currently developing a tech
nology known as galvanic vestibular stimulation,
which will allow humans to be controlled by remote
controls, just like little toy cars.
NTT is putting a new spin on ancient theories
about brain stimulation. As early as 1820, European
researchers noted the effects of galvanic vestibular
stimulation on balance when they conducted experi
ments on humans and animals, according to the Jour
nal of Applied Physiology.
Now, the company is trying to recreate these exper
iments in modern, electronic technology. Eventually,
the company hopes to perfect a headset that sends
small, low-voltage electric signals from the nerves in
people's ears to the back of their noggins. The electric
signals flow in various directions, depending on the
way the joystick on the accompanying remote control
moves, according to senior Dimitri Economou, an
electrical engineering major,
Economou learned of the new technology while he
studied under Prof. Yoh'ichi Tohkura at Japan's Na
tional Institute of Informatics.
"Galvanic vestibular stimulation allows fora de
vice to alter a human's perception of the direction of
gravity," Economou said. "So if you are walking
straight and I alter your perception of gravity, you will
be tugged in my direction choice of response."
Yuri Kageyama, a business writer for the Associat
ed Press, actually experienced the new technology. He
wrote in his Oct. 25 article, "I felt a mysterious, irre
sistible urge to start walking right whenever the re
searcher turned the switch to the right. It's a mesmer
izing sensation similar to being drunk."
Economou adds that he, too, has observed the ef
fects of galvanic vestibular stimulation.
"Yoh'ichi Tohkura showed us a video of someone
being controlled using a remote control," he said. "It
looked more like someone stumbling in the direction
of choice rather than walking."
Galvanic vestibular technology could likely en
hance modes of entertainment such as video games
and amusement park rides, according to the AP. But
NTT researchers explain that although some people

enjoy the experience others have felt uncomfortable.
Indeed, Kageyama said he did not enjoy the experi
ence.
"[One] program had the electric current timed to
music," Kageyama said. "My head was pulsating
against my will, getting jerked around on my head."
Stanford students, however, seem to be excited
about the new dimensions the technology could open
up for gaming in general.
Freshman and electrical engineering major Yuhao
Ding is gung-ho about any advance in immersive gam
ing technology.
"That's why you buy big screen TVs or surround
sound systems," Ding said. "I think galvanic vestibular
stimulation will definitely increase the gaming experi
ence."
And senior Zi Shen Lim, also an electrical engi
neering major, said he'd be very enthusiastic about a
galvanic vestibular stimulation device that would
allow a gamer to actually feel like a driver in a high
speed racing game.
"That's super cool!" he said, adding that he won
ders how else the technology could be used in games.
"Could it be used in first-person shooter games as
well?" he asked
Lim may face a long wait for these thrills — NTT
said there are no plans yet to use the technology to
create a consumer product, according to the AP
Its reluctance to quickly market the product is jus
tified, Economou said.
"[Tokhura] pointed out that as we use more and
more technologies, the more we come to depend on
them," Economou explained. "So at some point, if we
are not careful about the technologies we adopt, we
may reach a point that we, as people, will not be effec
tive without our technologies. [Tokhura] stressed the
importance of understanding the long term effects of
using a specific technology before it is implemented."
Additionally, the AP article reports that some peo
ple are worried about broader applications of galvan
ic vestibular stimulation. While it could be used for
medical purposes such as preventing elderly people
from falling, it also mentions that the technology
could be used for questionable military purposes.
Hopefully these issues are on the minds of NTT
researchers as they consider — and delay — work
ing galvanic vestibular stimulation into marketable
gadgets.

more technologies, the more we come to depend on

We've all heard of remote-controlled cars and
remote-controlled TVs — but remote-con
trolled humans?
This is exactly what the top Japanese telephone
company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company
(NTT) has in mind. It is currently developing a tech
nology known as galvanic vestibular stimulation,
which will allow humans to be controlled by remote
controls, just like little toy cars.
NTT is putting a new spin on ancient theories
about brain stimulation. As early as 1820, European
researchers noted the effects of galvanic vestibular
stimulation on balance when they conducted experi
ments on humans and animals, according to the Jour
nal of Applied Physiology.
Now, the company is trying to recreate these exper
iments in modern, electronic technology. Eventually,
the company hopes to perfect a headset that sends
small, low-voltage electric signals from the nerves in
people's ears to the back of their noggins. The electric
signals flow in various directions, depending on the
way the joystick on the accompanying remote control
moves, according to senior Dimitri Economou, an
electrical engineering major,
Economou learned of the new technology while he
studied under Prof. Yoh'ichi Tohkura at Japan's Na
tional Institute of Informatics.
"Galvanic vestibular stimulation allows fora de
vice to alter a human's perception of the direction of
gravity," Economou said. "So if you are walking
straight and I alter your perception of gravity, you will
be tugged in my direction choice of response."
Yuri Kageyama, a business writer for the Associat
ed Press, actually experienced the new technology. He
wrote in his Oct. 25 article, "I felt a mysterious, irre
sistible urge to start walking right whenever the re
searcher turned the switch to the right. It's a mesmer
izing sensation similar to being drunk."
Economou adds that he, too, has observed the ef
fects of galvanic vestibular stimulation.
"Yoh'ichi Tohkura showed us a video of someone
being controlled using a remote control," he said. "It
looked more like someone stumbling in the direction
of choice rather than walking."
Galvanic vestibular technology could likely en
hance modes of entertainment such as video games
and amusement park rides, according to the AP. But

enjoy the experience others have felt uncomfortable.
