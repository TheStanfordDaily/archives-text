# Looking for 15-year-old cereal? Sure thing!

If one man's trash is another man's treasure, then
the Internet connects the garbage man to the scav
enger.
In the second installment of this two-part series, we
tackle the task of finding random stuff on the Web.
Whether you are looking for odd-sized name brand
jeans or a box of collector-edition Batman cereal, with
a little work you can find it online — and often at great
prices, too.
Where's my size?
In the United States we are fortunate to live in a
pluralistic society — a melting pot of different races,
ethnicities and cultures. But with clothing sizes, we ap
parently are not pluralistic enough.
1 recently spent an afternoon shopping and was un
able to find a pair of jeans in my size — a men's 30-32.
Apparently, lanky 6-foot tall males are not as well rep
resented as their wider companions. Retail shops such
as Old Navy and Abercrombie save retail space by
only stocking their stores with a subset of the sizes
they produce, but they generally have their entire in
ventory online. I found my exact size at American
Eagle's online store, http://vvww.ae.com.
Purchasing clothing online is not about to revolu
tionize the way we buy clothes, but it offers advantages
— provided you know what you want. Purchasing
clothing online gives you more options and colors to
choose from than may be available on the shelves. One
friend needed a new J. Crew pea-coat, and while she
found her size at a store downtown, she only found the
coat in her color of choice online at jcrew.com.
Sometimes those extra options are a must. When I
bought my jeans online, I could also choose my desired
pre-washed fabric. I could get "Classic Wash" or "Vin
tage Wash."
1 could even pay an additional $10 for the "Authen
tic Destroyed Wash," meaning 1 could have my jeans
pre-ripped and torn fora fee. I feel fortunate to live in
a generation where we opt to pay more for poorer
quality, all in the name of fashion. This truly is Ameri
can consumerism at its finest.
Off the Beaten Track
For used or hard-to-get items, your best bet is to
shop on an Internet auction site. Ebay —
http://www.Ebay.com — is still the leader of the pack
in this area. It outperforms competitors like Übid and
Yahoo! in its sheer number of listings.
It also provides a simple user interface and a com
prehensive help section for first-timers.
There are a number of items on Ebay that you sim
ply cannot find anywhere else. At this very moment,
one of my hallmates is ferociously bidding on a guitar
shaped blue neon lamp that doubles as a wall clock.
Unopened cereal from 1989 also comes to mind.
My former roommate was curious to taste the ancient
breakfast favorite. Fora $5 bid. he purchased a box of
collector's edition Batman cereal. The crunchy corn
puffs came complete with a plastic Batman piggy bank
that would have even cereal aficionado Jerry Sein
feld's mouth watering.
For those who are wondering, the cereal didn't
taste very good, but the point remains — you can find
anything on Ebay.
When buying off of any auction site, be sure to read
each listing carefully. Sellers often only accept certain
forms of payment, such as paying through the elec
tronic transfer company Pay Pal.
If you are unsure or confused, e-mail the seller
through the "Ask a Seller a Question" link. I find most
Ebay sellers to be curt but honest and straightforward.
Think Community
For appliances, consumer electronics or larger items,
I recommend Craigslist at http://www.craigslist.com.
Created by San Franciscan Craig Newman in 1995,
Craigslist believes in fostering local communities
through the Internet and offers a free space for people
to post want ads or classifieds.
The upshot is that you can often find large items like
computers, furniture or electronics right in your neigh
borhood. And by dealing locally,you can avoid shipping
fees and lag time. You are also less likely to be scammed.
Unlike auction houses, Craigslist plays no role in
the actual transaction of money. If you buy an item on
Craigslist, expect to negotiate the price either via e
mail or on the phone and then be prepared to pay cold
hard cash to the seller in person.
I like the idea of purchasing items from someone I
can see and call in case things go wrong. I bought my
current computer off Craigslist for $200 from a nice
French couple five minutes away in Palo Alto.The en
tire process — including finding the computer online
and then picking it up — took less than two hours.The
couple was happy to get rid of an old piece of hard
ware and I was happy to give it a new home.
Ultimately, the Internet is just one big community.
Sites like Craigslist and Ebay offer you the ability to
reach out and do business with your fellow communi
ty members. Be it cereal or a new pair of jeans, the In
ternet can help you find what you're looking for in
your community.

ventory online. I found my exact size at American
Eagle's online store, http://vvww.ae.com.
Purchasing clothing online is not about to revolu
tionize the way we buy clothes, but it offers advantages
— provided you know what you want. Purchasing
clothing online gives you more options and colors to
choose from than may be available on the shelves. One
friend needed a new J. Crew pea-coat, and while she
found her size at a store downtown, she only found the
coat in her color of choice online at jcrew.com.
Sometimes those extra options are a must. When I
bought my jeans online, I could also choose my desired
pre-washed fabric. I could get "Classic Wash" or "Vin
tage Wash."
1 could even pay an additional $10 for the "Authen
tic Destroyed Wash," meaning 1 could have my jeans
pre-ripped and torn fora fee. I feel fortunate to live in
a generation where we opt to pay more for poorer
quality, all in the name of fashion. This truly is Ameri
can consumerism at its finest.
Off the Beaten Track
For used or hard-to-get items, your best bet is to
shop on an Internet auction site. Ebay —
http://www.Ebay.com — is still the leader of the pack
in this area. It outperforms competitors like Übid and
Yahoo! in its sheer number of listings.
It also provides a simple user interface and a com
prehensive help section for first-timers.
There are a number of items on Ebay that you sim
ply cannot find anywhere else. At this very moment,
one of my hallmates is ferociously bidding on a guitar
shaped blue neon lamp that doubles as a wall clock.
Unopened cereal from 1989 also comes to mind.
My former roommate was curious to taste the ancient
breakfast favorite. Fora $5 bid. he purchased a box of
collector's edition Batman cereal. The crunchy corn
puffs came complete with a plastic Batman piggy bank
that would have even cereal aficionado Jerry Sein
feld's mouth watering.
For those who are wondering, the cereal didn't
taste very good, but the point remains — you can find
anything on Ebay.
When buying off of any auction site, be sure to read
each listing carefully. Sellers often only accept certain
forms of payment, such as paying through the elec
tronic transfer company Pay Pal.
If you are unsure or confused, e-mail the seller
through the "Ask a Seller a Question" link. I find most
Ebay sellers to be curt but honest and straightforward.
Think Community
For appliances, consumer electronics or larger items,
I recommend Craigslist at http://www.craigslist.com.
Created by San Franciscan Craig Newman in 1995,
Craigslist believes in fostering local communities
through the Internet and offers a free space for people
to post want ads or classifieds.
The upshot is that you can often find large items like
computers, furniture or electronics right in your neigh
borhood. And by dealing locally,you can avoid shipping
fees and lag time. You are also less likely to be scammed.
Unlike auction houses, Craigslist plays no role in
the actual transaction of money. If you buy an item on
Craigslist, expect to negotiate the price either via e
mail or on the phone and then be prepared to pay cold
hard cash to the seller in person.
I like the idea of purchasing items from someone I
can see and call in case things go wrong. I bought my
current computer off Craigslist for $200 from a nice
French couple five minutes away in Palo Alto.The en
tire process — including finding the computer online
and then picking it up — took less than two hours.The
couple was happy to get rid of an old piece of hard
ware and I was happy to give it a new home.
Ultimately, the Internet is just one big community.
Sites like Craigslist and Ebay offer you the ability to
reach out and do business with your fellow communi
ty members. Be it cereal or a new pair of jeans, the In
ternet can help you find what you're looking for in
your community.

If one man's trash is another man's treasure, then
the Internet connects the garbage man to the scav
enger.
In the second installment of this two-part series, we
tackle the task of finding random stuff on the Web.
Whether you are looking for odd-sized name brand
jeans or a box of collector-edition Batman cereal, with
a little work you can find it online — and often at great
prices, too.
Where's my size?
In the United States we are fortunate to live in a
pluralistic society — a melting pot of different races,
ethnicities and cultures. But with clothing sizes, we ap
parently are not pluralistic enough.
1 recently spent an afternoon shopping and was un
able to find a pair of jeans in my size — a men's 30-32.
Apparently, lanky 6-foot tall males are not as well rep
resented as their wider companions. Retail shops such
as Old Navy and Abercrombie save retail space by
only stocking their stores with a subset of the sizes
they produce, but they generally have their entire in
ventory online. I found my exact size at American
Eagle's online store, http://vvww.ae.com.
