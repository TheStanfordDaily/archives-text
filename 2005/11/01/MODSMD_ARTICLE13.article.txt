## Editorial Continue discussion about Commencement 
### 
As the controversy surrounding this
year's Commencement site has
shown, an open dialogue between
the administration and students is extremely
important. In last week's editorial on Com
mencement ("Administration messed up
planning process", Oct. 25). we admitted that
consulting the whole senior class regarding
their Commencement location preferences
would have been impractical. Nonetheless,
we bemoaned the fact that President John
Hennessy hadn't sought adequate input from
the senior class presidents and that student
opinion was largely ignored.
Now. however, the University is reconsid
ering its recent decision and Hennessy has
asked for widespread input in the process. He
opened the forum to not only the entire sen
ior class, but to senior class parents, as well.
Preparing fora deluge of e-mail, the adminis
tration set up a special account just to receive
comments and concerns regarding each of
three proposed Commencement venues:
Frost Amphitheater, Roble Field and the
football practice field. We applaud this e-mail
as a great first step.
That said, we maintain our disappoint
ment that the University did not involve stu
dents in the planning process earlier. The ad
ministration surely already knows, but it
bears emphasizing, that had they not kept the
original planning process largely closed, it
could have avoided the recent firestorm.
We find it distressing that they only pub
licly released possible Commencement loca
tions after the senior class divulged them.
Had the senior class not taken the brazen
step of disclosing confidential information,
this debate might never have become public,
as it should have been from the start.
The administration should continue to
make the proceedings public. It must main
tain a reasonable amount of transparency or
risk completely alienating seniors, already
disillusioned with a process that originally
excluded them. Encouraged by the Universi

ty's professed desire to consider public opin
ion, students could easily become outraged
again if those attitudes are kept private when
the President's Office hands down another
decision. The University must release all the
data it receives regarding student and parent
preferences or risk student outcry. Addition
ally, it should do a better job of justifying its
ultimate decision than it did the first time
around.
Finally, Hennessy should be more candid
about the cost tradeoffs that are involved in
Commencement and the whole graduation
weekend. We understand his current wari
ness to even mention costs because students
and parents are likely to demand that there
be no tradeoffs, and some will argue that this
year's Commencement should be larger and
more extravagant than any in the past.
So, instead of releasing a detailed budget,
he should communicate monetary issues
with the senior class presidents. Students
are much more likely to believe their peers
than they are to believe the administration
on a sensitive topic such as the budget for
graduation. Assuming that there is a signifi
cant investment in these festivities, Hen
nessy should have no reservations about
discussing money with the senior class pres
idents, and they should be able to reassure
the rest of us of the administration's good
intentions.
Although monetary considerations may
be sensitive, the administration should not
use this excuse to keep us uninformed. The
University must manage many divergent
concerns regarding Commencement. It must
consider small and large families, elderly rel
atives, parking arrangements and emergency
access. Most challenging is the need to weigh
the opposing viewpoints of those who value
visibility and those who care most about
everyone being there. Inevitably not every
one will be satisfied, but only a public discus
sion will allow most participants to at least
accept the final decision.

ally, it should do a better job of justifying its
ultimate decision than it did the first time
around.
Finally, Hennessy should be more candid
about the cost tradeoffs that are involved in
Commencement and the whole graduation
weekend. We understand his current wari
ness to even mention costs because students
and parents are likely to demand that there
be no tradeoffs, and some will argue that this
year's Commencement should be larger and
more extravagant than any in the past.
So, instead of releasing a detailed budget,
he should communicate monetary issues
with the senior class presidents. Students
are much more likely to believe their peers
than they are to believe the administration
on a sensitive topic such as the budget for
graduation. Assuming that there is a signifi
cant investment in these festivities, Hen
nessy should have no reservations about
discussing money with the senior class pres
idents, and they should be able to reassure
the rest of us of the administration's good
intentions.
Although monetary considerations may
be sensitive, the administration should not
use this excuse to keep us uninformed. The
University must manage many divergent
concerns regarding Commencement. It must
consider small and large families, elderly rel
atives, parking arrangements and emergency
access. Most challenging is the need to weigh
the opposing viewpoints of those who value
visibility and those who care most about
everyone being there. Inevitably not every
one will be satisfied, but only a public discus
sion will allow most participants to at least
accept the final decision.
