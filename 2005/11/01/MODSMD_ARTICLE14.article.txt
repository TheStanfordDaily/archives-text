## It's time to go back to Tibet 
### ALAN NICHOLS 
The Dalai Lama will visit Stanford on
Nov. 4 and 5. 1 believe his energies should be
directed toward going to Tibet. As China's
holocaust continues in Tibet, the Tibetans
need the Dalai Lama desperately; we don't.
His teachings are available and distributed
in over 83 separate publications, most of
them copyrighted in his own name. You can
get them through every local library in the
Bay Area, to say nothing of his innumerable
visits to the United States, Europe and Cali
fornia.
I have empathized with Tibet's suffering
since China's invasion in 1949. I was privi
leged to have an audience with the Dalai
Lama in Dharamsala, India in 1972.1 was im
pressed. Now I'm disturbed that in the past
46 years, the plight of the Tibetans has only
worsened.
ITie Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959, thanks
to his armed escort. None of the Dalai
Lama's entourage dare advise him to go
home to Tibet. He might be tortured, impris
oned, even murdered, just like Tibetans who
have suffered such treatitient for more than
50 years. But his advisors don't hear his own
message. He writes and tells us suffering is
good for us. It helps us develop compassion
on the way to Nirvana. He teaches tolerance
and patience, two stepping stones to an en
lightenment that is impossible without suf
fering at the hands of our enemies.
The Dalai Lama says Mahatma Gandhi
is his model for effecting political change
without violence. He also admires Dr. Mar
tin Luther King. Jr. and Madame Aung San
Suu Kyi of Burma for the same reason. He
overlooks the fact that Gandhi and every
one else who led their people to freedom
faced the same dangers, threats, violence
and imprisonments as their followers. Can
anyone imagine Moses, Jesus or Mo
hammed preaching their messages of love,
alms-giving or goodness from somewhere
else in exile?
Thanks to the sufferings of the Tibetans,
the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel

Peace Prize along with more than 129 hon
orary degrees and other honors.
The Dalai Lama tells escapees from Tibet
(who suffer from the Himalayas, police in
China and Nepal, freezing temperatures and
no food) that they should return to Tibet —
they could do more good there, he says. He
should take his own advice. He indicated
when he left, and several times since, that he
would return — most recently in a 1996
speech.
The Dalai Lama's only proposal since
leaving Tibet has been to negotiate with
China, yet he admits that "China has refused
to negotiate or even meet at any meaningful
level." In 1994, the Dalai Lama added, "I re
alized it would be impossible to negotiate
with people who behave in this crude and
criminal fashion."
For 46 years, the Dalai Lama's leadership
has done nothing for the Tibetans in Tibet.
His peace proposals, calls for negotiation
and small public relations victories around
the world have exacerbated the genocide in
Tibet.
The Dalai Lama is not without nonvio
lent means for freedom — if only he had
the courage to use them. His return to
Tibet could galvanize world support far ex
ceeding the acclaim from movie stars and
politicians. China would respond to a
protest led by the Dalai Lama that affects
their important interests. He could call for
boycotts of goods made in China, of the
2008 Olympics, of global companies that do
business in China. He could suggest that
people not travel to China. From my own
experiences in Tibet and China as an attor
ney, an author and a cyclist, China will ne
gotiate if they believe such threats are
credible. And they are.
