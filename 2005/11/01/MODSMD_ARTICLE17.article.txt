# Every senior's angst: Figuring out next year
## 
### 
As promised last week, I've compiled a
list of all my options that will turn my
CS degree from an easy meal ticket to
an exceedingly expensive placemat. I will
share them with you now.
Move to Spain and sell coffee: I started
drinking coffee on my first day of work at
IBM and have now graduated to being a full
on coffee snob. Which means I can say things
like "There is no such thing as coffee in the
United States. It is all swill!" Since I was 10,
people have been telling me that if you don't
go to Europe during the summer after college
you will never Go To Europe. Also, I'm told
that Spain has good coffee and I'll finally put
to use my five years of Spanish education.
Wander around Europe, sleep in hostels,
seduce beautiful Nordic women, drink coffee
sold by other people: If anyone has rich par
ents who wish to sponsor a naive bipolar kid
while he goes on a vision quest through the
Western world, please contact me.
Parent's Couch: Pros — free food and
free rent in NYC,digital cable with HBO-on
demand. Cons — living with my parents,
sleeping on a couch. This is clearly not my
best option.
Waiter: I sat down with my English
teacher last week to ask him what I should do
with my life. He told me that if I was serious
about wanting to be a writer, I should take a
job I could drop in an instant. He suggested a
job in the service industry, where I'd be con
stantly exposed to the rhythm and interplay
of human beings. He also asked me not to tell
my parents it was his idea. Having never

worked a cash register or bussed a table in
my life, no matter how many times my aunt
suggested it would "build character," 1 can
not imagine this going well. Also, having
never made less than $20 an hour, earning
less than minimum wage (plus tips!) might
give me an early coronary.
Teach for America: The premise of Teach
for America is that liberal guilt alone can
make up for crumbling school facilities, out
dated textbooks, underfunded programs and
broken homes. As a liberal Jew, I have expo
nentially more guilt than your standard liber
al, so clearly I am qualified for this job. Ex
cept that I have the patience of an ADD kid
with an intravenous caffeine drip and have
been told on numerous occasions that I am
the worst teacher ever. Regardless, guilt will
compensate.
Join the Peace Corps/French Foreign Le
gion: In high school, my history teacher told
us that one of his best friends had gone to
Africa with the Peace Corps. Apparently it
was amazing, and on the last night of his stay
they gave him their highest honor — eating
the mother grub of a termite colony. I hate

bugs.The Foreign Legion is another idealized
paramilitary organization. Apparently they
no longer allow felons to join, so the fear of
being stabbed in my sleep for my boots is
lessened. They still let you sign up under a
fake name and citizenship, so I could finally
realize my dream of being known as "Fascist
Overlord" from the nation of Sea Land.
Startup: At the end of my IBM internship.
I got drunk while talking to a senior VP who
said that a startup is just like a corporation,
except with free food and a higher likelihood
of not getting paid. This sounds great. Free
food is the best. And worry ing about not get
ting paid? How glamorous. It's like being a
starving artist but with better odds. Lately all
my friends have been running around bab
bling about wanting to "do a startup."
They're assembling teams and considering
which venture capitalist firm to go with and
picking paint colors for the walls of their of
fices. They have failed to notice that to do a
startup you need a profitable idea. Unlike
Teach for America, VCs do not believe that
good will can solve every problem.
Become a legal aid lawyer: My parent's
biggest fear in life is that I will go to law
school... and end up spending the rest of my
life at the ACLU or EFF chasing some mis
guided hippie ideal of freedom. Possible hur
dles — the LSAT, the admissions process, a
total lack of desire to take any more classes
fora while. Possible payoffs — marrying a
Newport Beach construction heiress, getting
