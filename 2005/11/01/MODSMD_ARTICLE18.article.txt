# No boys allowed: Life on the all-girls floor
## 
### 
Last night, as I was wandering the halls in
search of somewhere to waste time, I
noticed something I hadn't paid much
attention to before. My dorm consists of three
floors: one all-male, one all-female and one
coed, so one would imagine that each floor
has its own unique personality. But, until you
take a step back and observe, you don't real
ize just how distinct these personalities are.
A friend and I (both of whom live on the
all-girls floor) decided to see what was going
on in the dorm. We started in our hallway,
stopping fora moment to visit with a group
of girls who were doing hair and watching
MTV. Then we strolled downstairs to the
guys' floor, where a good two-thirds of the
residents were absorbed in intense games of
Halo.
Deciding that we wanted neither to glam
it up nor get killed over and over again, we
headed up to the third floor, i.e. the coed
floor, i.e. the party floor. And what a party it
was. There were people everywhere, some
less inhibited than others. As we chatted in
the hallway, several of our dormmates ran
screaming past us, pausing only to two-step
to the salsa music blasting from a few doors
down. Everyone was having a good time.
(The one downside of living on the third

floor, so I've been told, is that sleep is not an
option prior to 5 a.m., regardless of what day
of the week it is).
I'll be the first to admit that 1 was a little
wary when I got my room assignment and
saw that I would be sharing a hallway with 30
other females. I spent my high-school years
on the math team, hanging out with engi
neers, computer programmers and the like.
In general, I feel more comfortable around
guys than girls. (In an effort to be politically
correct, I'll point out here that, yes, women
can be engineers — several of my good
friends are on the engineering track — but I
can't deny the fact that, as a female, I was in
variably in the minority at every math-relat
ed event I ever attended.)
In spite of the lack of boys on my hall,
there are moments that make me feel really

lucky to he living where I am. As much fun as
the coed floor is, I have grown to appreciate
the relative calmness that comes with living
in a community of girls (unless we're watch
ing the season finale of "So You Think You
Can Dance," in which case calm is simply not
an option).
It's perfectly okay to wander down the
hall wearing only a towel, and if I ever need
that perfect pair of shoes, chances are that
someone has them in just the right size. And
new advantages become apparent every day:
Just last week, a few of us took an impromp
tu trip to the mall, something that you just
don't get to do when you're friends with the
typically apathetic-to-fashion male.
But the culmination of my appreciation
for all things girly was the atmosphere in the
hours before Frosh Formal; I couldn't turn
around without seeing a curling iron or an
eyeliner pencil. Girls ran up and down the
hall looking for advice:"Do these earrings go
with my dress? What color nail polish should
I use?"
Maybe I'm just being really sappy,but get
ting all dolled up together is the ultimate fe
male bonding experience. As we snapped

Moment of Zen
photo after photo of us girls looking
sexy in our little dresses and cute
hairdos, I really felt like a part of
something special, something that 1
had been missing out on when 1 hung
out with the boys.
Of course, after the dance it was
back to jeans and a tank top for me

— there's only so long you can wear
heels before your feet start scream
ing for comfy flip-flops. But every
once in a while, you've got to give
them the fun and excitement they
crave, so you slip on those sparkly
sandals and strut your stuff down to
the bovs' floor.

Is there a floor in your dorm that is es
pecially exciting and unique? E-mail
Stephanie at salessi@stanford.edu and
invite her to stop by; may he she '11 write
about her visit next week.
