### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
Many of Stanford's current cross-country stars were in mid
dle school the last time the Cardinal lost the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title; those runners made sure the winning streak contin
ued on Saturday.
On a course at Arizona, the men captured their sixth
straight Pac-10 Championship and the women captured their
10th. Sophomore Arianna Lambie also claimed her first Pac
-10 individual title.
The men finished well ahead of runner-up Arizona, posting
46 points to Arizona's 78. Sophomore Neftalem Araia finished
first for the Cardinal and third overall. According to head
coach Peter Tegen, Araia's strong performance came just in
time.
"Really the story for Stanford was the return of Nef Araia,"
Tegen said."l think he was getting pretty frustrated because he
knows that he is a great athlete. His personal expectations are
a lot higher than what he was able to show so far, leading up to
the Pac-10."
Araia finished the B,(XM)-meter course in 24:19, behind
reigning Pac-10 champion junior Robert Cheseret of Ari
zona and second-place finisher junior Obed Mutanya,also of
Arizona.
"Nef ran with an extremely strong mind and focus," Tegen
said. "He seemed to be so channeled forward. He simply was
not going to fall back. He had a lot of willpower; it was very im
pressive."
Up until the last quarter-mile, Araia,junior Jonathan Pierce
and senior David Vidal, together with Cheseret, Mutanya and
two other Arizona runners, formed the lead pack. In the end.
Pierce finished seventh in 24:26, while the Cardinal's third
scoring runner turned out to be junior Brett Gotcher.
"It wasn't until the very end that Brett passed David Vidal,"
Tegen said. "Brett had an extraordinary race. He ran really
tough."
According to Tegen, top-ranked Vidal faded down the
stretch due to heat and high elevation. Vidal finished 12th in
24:38, while the fifth Cardinal scorer, junior Jacob Gomez, fin
ished 14th in 24:45.
"Gomez ran absolutely superbly, especially for not being
used to being way up there,"Tegen said.
Redshirt freshman Hari Mix was 19th in 24:58, while soph
omore Forrest Tahdooahnippah was 31st in 25:18. Other Car
dinal finishers were junior Rolf Steier, redshirt freshman Gar
rett Heath and sophomore Russell Brown.
"We were expecting Garrett to be a lot more ahead, but for
tunately we were able to afford those slips because we had

enough others who would step in
and make up for it," Tegen said.
"Hari and Forest had an exception
ally good race. Overall the guys had
a fantastic Pac-10 championship."
On the women's side, the excite
ment doubled, as the Cardinal cap
tured both the team and individual
titles. The women finished just
ahead of Arizona State, tallying 34
points to the Sun Devils' 40. Lambie
finished the 6,000-meter race in
20:20.
"I was feeling motivated," Lam
bie said. "All of us really wanted
Stanford to get the individual title
and the team title,so 1 felt prepared.
Amy Hastings beat Alicia Craig last
year, which we needed some re
venge for."
Lambie finished a full 20 seconds
in front of Hastings, a junior from
Arizona State.
"I took the lead a little bit before
halfway," Lambie said. "I wanted to
make it convincing enough and pull
ahead with a fast enough pace that
others would not be able to hold."
Redshirt freshman Lindsay
Flacks was thifd overall in 20:52,
while sophomore Teresa Mc Walters
finished fifth in 20:56.
"Both Arianna and Teresa were
the ones who took the lead together
fora while," Tegen said. "They had
no big problem putting distance in
between them and Amy Hastings."
The fourth and filth Cardinal
scorers were sophomore Lauren
Centrowitz, who finished 11th in
21:14, and junior Amanda Trotter,
who was 14th in 21:26. Junior Katy
Trotter was 15th in 21:32.
"Katy did not have a very great
day,"Tegen said. "It's all relative —
she still came in 15th — but under
normal circumstances we would ex
pect her to be a little further up."
"I didn't notice [the altitude and
heat] particularly, but the course
was hard and it took a lot out of
everyone," Lambie said. "Whether
it was the course, the heat or the al
titude, the times were slower than
usual."
