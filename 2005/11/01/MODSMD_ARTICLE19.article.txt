### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
Many of Stanford's current cross-country stars were in mid
dle school the last time the Cardinal lost the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title; those runners made sure the winning streak contin
ued on Saturday.
On a course at Arizona, the men captured their sixth
straight Pac-10 Championship and the women captured their
10th. Sophomore Arianna Lambie also claimed her first Pac
-10 individual title.
The men finished well ahead of runner-up Arizona, posting
46 points to Arizona's 78. Sophomore Neftalem Araia finished
first for the Cardinal and third overall. According to head
coach Peter Tegen, Araia's strong performance came just in
time.
"Really the story for Stanford was the return of Nef Araia,"
Tegen said."l think he was getting pretty frustrated because he
knows that he is a great athlete. His personal expectations are
a lot higher than what he was able to show so far, leading up to
the Pac-10."
Araia finished the B,(XM)-meter course in 24:19, behind
reigning Pac-10 champion junior Robert Cheseret of Ari
zona and second-place finisher junior Obed Mutanya,also of
Arizona.
"Nef ran with an extremely strong mind and focus," Tegen
said. "He seemed to be so channeled forward. He simply was
not going to fall back. He had a lot of willpower; it was very im
pressive."
Up until the last quarter-mile, Araia,junior Jonathan Pierce
and senior David Vidal, together with Cheseret, Mutanya and
two other Arizona runners, formed the lead pack. In the end.
Pierce finished seventh in 24:26, while the Cardinal's third
scoring runner turned out to be junior Brett Gotcher.
"It wasn't until the very end that Brett passed David Vidal,"
Tegen said. "Brett had an extraordinary race. He ran really
tough."
According to Tegen, top-ranked Vidal faded down the
stretch due to heat and high elevation. Vidal finished 12th in
24:38, while the fifth Cardinal scorer, junior Jacob Gomez, fin
ished 14th in 24:45.
"Gomez ran absolutely superbly, especially for not being
used to being way up there,"Tegen said.
Redshirt freshman Hari Mix was 19th in 24:58, while soph
omore Forrest Tahdooahnippah was 31st in 25:18. Other Car
dinal finishers were junior Rolf Steier, redshirt freshman Gar
rett Heath and sophomore Russell Brown.
"We were expecting Garrett to be a lot more ahead, but for
tunately we were able to afford those slips because we had
