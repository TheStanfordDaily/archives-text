## Bike shop readies for move After 30 years on Salvatierra Walk, the Shop heads to Tresidder 
### LOREN NEWMAN 
After spending nearly 30 years at
its Salvatierra Walk location, the
Campus Bike Shop is moving 300
yards to TVesidder Student Union.
The store is being displaced from its
historic building by the construction
of the new Munger Graduate Resi
dence for law students, which will oc
cupy most of the space northeast of
the shop to Wilbur Field.
There are mixed feelings about this
move, and many affected by the deci
sion question whether this is the best
use of space, if it's is in students' best
interest and if the bike shop can sur
vive on campus once uprooted from
its long-held site. There are, after all,
more than 12,000 bicycles at Stanford.
"We don't have much power or
leverage to fight for space," said
Christian Parker, service manager
for the shop for the last 10 years.
"There are no alternatives because
the timeline's pretty quick."
Despite the drawbacks, there are
benefits to the new location.
"We're very happy that the new
space is central to campus," Parker
said. "If you have a flat tire, you don't
have to walk as far."
In fact, the overall traffic to the
store is expected to nearly double.
The ASSU has been debating the
value of the Tresidder storefront as
well.
"The bike shop is indeed vital to
the campus," said ASSU Vice-Presi
dent Aneto Okonkwo, a senior. "But
we have raised issue with the move
because of the current space crunch
and the valuable nature of theTVesid
der space."
Finding space on campus for such
establishments has been an ongoing
problem.
"The space could alternatively
have been used for student study
space, play space or meeting space,"
Okonkwo said. "We want to ensure
that all future decisions are made in
the best interest of students."
The new location, on Tresidder's
east side next to the CoHo, may not
even be ideal for the bike shop.
"The issues with the new indoor
space are. will we be able to have a 24
hour air hose capacity, a tool area or a
self-repair area?" Parker questioned.
"Right now. our shop is very open
and user-friendly. The new space is
potentially limiting."
These problems would be magni
fied next fall, Parker said.
"During September we have ap
proximately 500 bikes outside on the
lawn," he said. "During the freshman
rush.it'sjust huge.The question is,how
will we be able to accommodate that
load of students in our new location?"
Students have been discussing the
possibility of petitioning the Univer
sity to put the interests of bikers
higher on its priority list, but so far
none of these plans have come to
fruition.
"There all these funds reserved
for alternative forms of transporta
tion, and I think the most economi
cal use of those funds is supporting
students and faculty to ride bicy
cles," Parker said."lt's in everyone's
best interest to make the bike shop
convenient, efficient, economical
and approachable. The question is
planning it."
There seems to be no easy solu
tion. The Munger dorm, named for
billionaire investor Charles Munger,
is budgeted at $100 million and is
funded by one of the largest housing
contributions in Stanford history.
The Daily reported on the uproar it
created in the surrounding commu

nity since the project was an
nounced.
"The project is enormous for the
site," said David Victor, a resident on
Alvarado Row, in a Daily article
from Nov. 15. 2(X)4. 'it's going to
transform the feel of this side of cam
pus. Imagine a project three times as
bis as the alumni center running

through the middle of the major
campus thoroughfares."
Others on campus seem to care
very little where the bike shop is re
located, as long as there is one.
The move is planned, and, accord
ing to the sign in the window at the
new location, the new bike store will
be open Jan. I, like it or not.

After spending nearly 30 years at
its Salvatierra Walk location, the
Campus Bike Shop is moving 300
yards to TVesidder Student Union.
The store is being displaced from its
historic building by the construction
of the new Munger Graduate Resi
dence for law students, which will oc
cupy most of the space northeast of
the shop to Wilbur Field.
There are mixed feelings about this
move, and many affected by the deci
sion question whether this is the best
use of space, if it's is in students' best
interest and if the bike shop can sur
vive on campus once uprooted from
its long-held site. There are, after all,
more than 12,000 bicycles at Stanford.
"We don't have much power or
leverage to fight for space," said
Christian Parker, service manager
for the shop for the last 10 years.
"There are no alternatives because
the timeline's pretty quick."
Despite the drawbacks, there are
benefits to the new location.
"We're very happy that the new
space is central to campus," Parker
said. "If you have a flat tire, you don't
have to walk as far."
In fact, the overall traffic to the
store is expected to nearly double.
The ASSU has been debating the
value of the Tresidder storefront as
well.
"The bike shop is indeed vital to
the campus," said ASSU Vice-Presi
dent Aneto Okonkwo, a senior. "But
we have raised issue with the move
because of the current space crunch
and the valuable nature of theTVesid
der space."
Finding space on campus for such
establishments has been an ongoing
problem.
"The space could alternatively
have been used for student study
space, play space or meeting space,"
Okonkwo said. "We want to ensure
that all future decisions are made in
the best interest of students."
The new location, on Tresidder's
east side next to the CoHo, may not
even be ideal for the bike shop.
"The issues with the new indoor
space are. will we be able to have a 24
hour air hose capacity, a tool area or a
self-repair area?" Parker questioned.
"Right now. our shop is very open
and user-friendly. The new space is
