## Bike shop readies for move After 30 years on Salvatierra Walk, the Shop heads to Tresidder 
### LOREN NEWMAN 
After spending nearly 30 years at
its Salvatierra Walk location, the
Campus Bike Shop is moving 300
yards to TVesidder Student Union.
The store is being displaced from its
historic building by the construction
of the new Munger Graduate Resi
dence for law students, which will oc
cupy most of the space northeast of
the shop to Wilbur Field.
There are mixed feelings about this
move, and many affected by the deci
sion question whether this is the best
use of space, if it's is in students' best
interest and if the bike shop can sur
vive on campus once uprooted from
its long-held site. There are, after all,
more than 12,000 bicycles at Stanford.
"We don't have much power or
leverage to fight for space," said
Christian Parker, service manager
for the shop for the last 10 years.
"There are no alternatives because
the timeline's pretty quick."
Despite the drawbacks, there are
benefits to the new location.
"We're very happy that the new
space is central to campus," Parker
said. "If you have a flat tire, you don't
have to walk as far."
In fact, the overall traffic to the
store is expected to nearly double.
The ASSU has been debating the
value of the Tresidder storefront as
well.
"The bike shop is indeed vital to
the campus," said ASSU Vice-Presi
dent Aneto Okonkwo, a senior. "But
we have raised issue with the move
because of the current space crunch
and the valuable nature of theTVesid
der space."
Finding space on campus for such
establishments has been an ongoing
problem.
"The space could alternatively
have been used for student study
space, play space or meeting space,"
Okonkwo said. "We want to ensure
that all future decisions are made in
the best interest of students."
