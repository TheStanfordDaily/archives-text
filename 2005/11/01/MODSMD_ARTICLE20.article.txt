# Women's soccer struggles offensively, again
## Stanford falls 1-0 to USC, then stuns No. 4 UCLA with a 0-0 tie 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The search for the finishing touch has been a recurring
problem for the Stanford women's Soccer team (8-6-3,2-
3-2 Pacific 10 Conference) this season, and this week
end's matches at Maloney Field proved no different. De
spite putting on two strong performances, the Cardinal
rounded off another weekend of Pac-1() play failing to

see the results they would have liked.
In what seems like a repeat of last weekend's perform
ance against the Arizona schools, Stanford collected only
a single point of a possible six after falling 1-0 to South
ern California (10-5-2,4-2-1) on Friday and being held to
a scoreless draw against No. 4 UCLA (15-1-2,5-0-2) on
Sunday.Hie Cardinal are now eighth in the standing with
only two more games to play.
The weekend marked Stanford's final home games of
the season, and all seven of the team's seniors — defend
er Megan Alderete, keeper Elizabeth Barnard, forward
Jenny Farenbaugh, co-captain defenders llayley and
Lindsey Hunt, and midfielders Leah Tapscott and

Martha West — were recognized before Sunday's game.
'it's been an emotional weekend." Lindsey Hunt said.
"It's hard to say goodbye to this team, but it's exciting to
move on, and I'm excited for the weekend to come."
For much of Friday's game, Stanford looked like the
better team. However, despite being out-shot 11-8, the
Trojans lived up to their recent reputation for late-game
heroics, scoring in the game's final minutes for the third
consecutive match. Freshmen Amy Rodriguez and Nini
Loucks combined for the game-winner in the 80th
minute, when Rodriguez received a cross from the right
and fed the hall in front of the goal
for Loucks to finish.
The result was a bitter disap
pointment for the Cardinal, who saw
strong individual performances from
West, who recorded five shots that
night, and sophomore keeper Erica
Holland, who made her third- and
fourth-career starts.
"Against USC we were unlucky,"
sophomore midfielder/defender
Lizzy George said. "Everyone put
everything they had on the field into
the tackles and the shots. We domi
nated the whole game hut couldn't
put anything away."
Sunday's game saw a similar per
formance from the Cardinal. Stan
ford showed its offensive determina
tion early, outshooting the Bruins 6-
1 in the opening half. However, al
though the attack created numerous
chances, Stanford was unable to
sneak a ball past the Bruin defense
and sophomore goalkeeper Valerie
Henderson recorded three saves in
UCLA's 13th shutout this season.
After 90 minutes of regular time
without a goal, the Cardinal went to
double OT for the second time in as
many weeks. Stanford created two
more scoring opportunities in over
time, but again the Cardinal could
not score, and the contest ended a 0-
0 draw.
Despite being only the third team
to not lose to the Pac-10 leading
Bruin this season, the result was far
from satisfying for the Cardinal.
"I thought we could have won the
game," head coach Paul Ratcliffe
said. "We dominated the game and
we created great chances, but once
again we just didn't execute in the
final third. Their goalkeeper made a
couple of good saves, but we also
missed a few just over the bar that we
should have kept down. If we had
finished some of our chances, we
would have won both games."
After a weekend of strong per
formances but disappointing results,
the Cardinal are left with mixed feel
ings. While the squad is satisfied with
its overall performance, the concern

with finishing has continued to cause
Stanford worry as it looks towards its
final weekend of conference play.
"I feel really disappointed we did
n't get wins that we could have this
weekend," George said. "It's frus
trating right now hut it just gets us

more focused for next week because
we know what we have to do, and we
know that we can play against the
No. 4 team in the country and beat
them. 1 think it gives a little more
confidence and a little more bite
going into next weekend."

a single point of a possible six after falling 1-0 to South
ern California (10-5-2,4-2-1) on Friday and being held to
a scoreless draw against No. 4 UCLA (15-1-2,5-0-2) on
Sunday.Hie Cardinal are now eighth in the standing with
only two more games to play.
The weekend marked Stanford's final home games of
the season, and all seven of the team's seniors — defend
er Megan Alderete, keeper Elizabeth Barnard, forward
Jenny Farenbaugh, co-captain defenders llayley and
Lindsey Hunt, and midfielders Leah Tapscott and

Martha West — were recognized before Sunday's game.
'it's been an emotional weekend." Lindsey Hunt said.
"It's hard to say goodbye to this team, but it's exciting to
move on, and I'm excited for the weekend to come."
For much of Friday's game, Stanford looked like the
better team. However, despite being out-shot 11-8, the
Trojans lived up to their recent reputation for late-game
heroics, scoring in the game's final minutes for the third
consecutive match. Freshmen Amy Rodriguez and Nini
Loucks combined for the game-winner in the 80th
minute, when Rodriguez received a cross from the right
and fed the hall in front of the goal
for Loucks to finish.
The result was a bitter disap
pointment for the Cardinal, who saw
strong individual performances from
West, who recorded five shots that
night, and sophomore keeper Erica
Holland, who made her third- and
fourth-career starts.
"Against USC we were unlucky,"
sophomore midfielder/defender
Lizzy George said. "Everyone put
everything they had on the field into
the tackles and the shots. We domi
nated the whole game hut couldn't
put anything away."
Sunday's game saw a similar per
formance from the Cardinal. Stan
ford showed its offensive determina
tion early, outshooting the Bruins 6-
1 in the opening half. However, al
though the attack created numerous
chances, Stanford was unable to
sneak a ball past the Bruin defense
and sophomore goalkeeper Valerie
Henderson recorded three saves in
UCLA's 13th shutout this season.
After 90 minutes of regular time
without a goal, the Cardinal went to
double OT for the second time in as
many weeks. Stanford created two
more scoring opportunities in over
time, but again the Cardinal could
not score, and the contest ended a 0-
0 draw.
Despite being only the third team
to not lose to the Pac-10 leading
Bruin this season, the result was far
from satisfying for the Cardinal.
"I thought we could have won the
game," head coach Paul Ratcliffe
said. "We dominated the game and
we created great chances, but once
again we just didn't execute in the
final third. Their goalkeeper made a
couple of good saves, but we also
missed a few just over the bar that we
should have kept down. If we had
finished some of our chances, we
would have won both games."
After a weekend of strong per
formances but disappointing results,
the Cardinal are left with mixed feel
ings. While the squad is satisfied with
its overall performance, the concern

with finishing has continued to cause
Stanford worry as it looks towards its
final weekend of conference play.
"I feel really disappointed we did
n't get wins that we could have this
weekend," George said. "It's frus
trating right now hut it just gets us

more focused for next week because
we know what we have to do, and we
know that we can play against the
No. 4 team in the country and beat
them. 1 think it gives a little more
confidence and a little more bite
going into next weekend."

weekend. Though West tallied five shots in the game, the Cardinal could not
muster a goal and fell 1 -0.
The search for the finishing touch has been a recurring
problem for the Stanford women's Soccer team (8-6-3,2-
3-2 Pacific 10 Conference) this season, and this week
end's matches at Maloney Field proved no different. De
spite putting on two strong performances, the Cardinal
rounded off another weekend of Pac-1() play failing to

see the results they would have liked.
In what seems like a repeat of last weekend's perform
ance against the Arizona schools, Stanford collected only
a single point of a possible six after falling 1-0 to South
ern California (10-5-2,4-2-1) on Friday and being held to
a scoreless draw against No. 4 UCLA (15-1-2,5-0-2) on
