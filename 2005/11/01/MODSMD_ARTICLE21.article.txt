## Field hockey splits final two contests 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's field hockey team (6-
12,3-3) ended its regular season with a thrilling
victory over Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence rival Radford yesterday. After winning 3-
2, Stanford now heads to the NorPac Champi
onship as the third seed.
"We were happy to get the win today," head
coach Lesley Irvine said. "It was good timing
heading into the conference championship, a
good confidence booster. I am very happy for
our seniors and pleased that we finished in the
top three in our conference based upon this
win."
Freshman midfielder/forward Caroline
Hussey scored twice, with junior defender/mid
fielder Julia Drewes adding the other Cardinal
tally on Senior Day.
The Cardinal outshot Radford 20-8, with
Drewes and sophomore midfielder/forward
Jess Zutz attempting four shots each.
Drewes scored early, connecting on a penal
ty stroke less than three minutes into the game.
Hussey scored soon after on an unassisted
drive, building a 2-0 Cardinal lead a mere three
minutes into the game.
Radford junior forward Meredith Evans
scored two minutes later, but the Car
dinal quickly responded. Just a minute
later, Hussey struck paydirt for the
second time, this time off of a penalty
corner at 6:05.
The offensive production contin
ued in the first half, as Highlander sen
ior defender Cortney Brown scored
what turned out to be the match's
final goal at 28:31.
Neither team scored in the second
half, although Radford took four
shots and the Cardinal eight during
the second period. With two second
half saves in the contest, sophomore
goalkeeper Madison Bell deserves
much of the credit for the second-half
shutout.
The squad suffered a tough loss
against arch-rival California (10-7,5-
1) this past Saturday however, falling
3-2 in overtime. The team was unable
to stop explosive Cal junior forward
Valentina Godfrid from notching a

hat trick for the Golden Bears, includ
ing the game-winner 24 seconds into
overtime.
Irvine remained optimistic after
the game, insisting her team played
well.
"Today was an unbelievable game
of field hockey," Irvine said. "The game
was very competitive and could have
gone either way. It's hard to lose a
game when you have played so well."
Cal putshot Stanford 14-8 over the
course of the game, with Godfrid pac
ing the Bears with four shots. Zutz was
lead shot-taker for the Cardinal, tak
ing five shots.
Godfrid scored the first goal of the
game off a corner at 7:41. Hussey
scored first for the Cardinal, off an as
sist from Zutz ;it 10:11.
Zutz scored early in the second
half, at 39:57, giving the Cardinal a 2-1
lead, but the squad was unable to
maintain its advantage.
Despite allowing two late goals,
Bell still ranks sixth in the conference
with her .667 save percentage.
The squad is seeded third in the
NorPac championship, below Pacific
and Cal.
