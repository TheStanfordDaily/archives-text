# Youth football: from Pop Warner to weight limits
## 
### 
Aside from playground games of touch, my
experience with football began in high
school, playing on the freshman team. But
for some kids, exposure to football comes as young
as six years old. Dubbed "pee wee" or "little
league", among other monikers, the proper term in
coaching circles for anything pre-high school is
youth football.
Pop Warner is the best-known youth football or
ganization, named for the Stanford coach who was
one of the early patriarchs of the game. We'll all be
hearing a lot more about Pop Warner in the next few
years, since the NFL has seen fit to bolster its image
by investing in the organization. But I digress.
Some youth leagues are affiliated with middle
schools or with community centers such as the
Boys and Girls Clubs. Still others are entirely inde
pendent, operated by coaches and parents. I, for
one, really appreciate the great diversity of inde
pendent leagues in cities and towns all over Amer
ica.
Many have modified their league rules to sim
plify the game and ensure fairness. Some have
draft systems that keep talent balanced among the
teams, and some regulate the schemes to keep the
focus on blocking and tackling rather than out
smarting the opposition.
Youth leagues often have minimum-play rules,
on the order of 10 plays per half or some such num
ber, which 1 strongly support. Some say that the kid
should only play if he's good enough. That certain
ly reinforces the sports meritocracy â€” but less tal
ented kids who have put in their time at practice
and shown good attitudes also deserve to play. As
we all know, puberty can do a lot to someone's
body; a lot of average kids become very good foot
ball players between freshman and senior year. A
youth coach that runs kids off because he's only
playing the best is not doing his proper duty.
The annals of the game are filled with stories of
guys who grew from one position to another. One
high school coach saw his talented fullback be
come an NFL prospect after converting to offen
sive guard at Weber State. Here at Stanford, defen
sive lineman Nick Frank was moved to fullback
and has quickly become an offensive star with his
blocking, rushing and catching.
I heard a wise man say that the measure of a
youth program is not its wins and losses, but how
many kids sign up to play another year. I find it dif
ficult to come up with a better standard.
A mildly controversial policy enforced in some
leagues are weight limits, which take a number of
forms. The most conservative simply prevent a boy
over a certain weight from carrying the football.
Stronger limits force players above the weight
threshold to play with older kids.
Opposing arguments to weight limits are three
fold. The first is that the links between size and in
jury are specious at best. The idea seems to be
based on some sort of folk science that large bod
ies flying all over the place are a risk to the other
kids. Football injuries don't usually occur in this
