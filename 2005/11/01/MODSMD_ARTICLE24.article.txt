# PEPPERDINE ALSO DEFEATED SUNDAY
## Polo thrills past UCLA 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
A little over a month ago, the No. 3 Car
dinal (15-3, 4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) faced defending national
champion UCLA in the semifinals of the
SoCal Open tournament. It was the first
meeting between the two water polo teams
since last season's NCAA title game, and
the Stanford men rose to the occasion,
handing then-top-ranked UCLA its first
loss of the season in thrilling fashion.
It was a memorable victory for fresh
man two-meter Will Hindle-Katel â€” one
that he did not expect to see rivaled in ei
ther dramatics or emotional satisfaction
any time soon.
"To beat [UCLA] down there in double
overtime, that's about as good as it gets,"
Hindle-Katel had said.
But Stanford's victory over the Bruins
(15-5,2-1) this weekend at Avery Aquatic
Center might have been just a little bit bet
ter. In the final period of regulation, the
Cardinal stormed back from a three-goal
deficit to tie the score at seven apiece, and
they completed their comeback by
outscoring UCLA 2-1 in overtime to claim
the 9-8 victory.
The Cardinal built a 2-0 lead in the first
half on the strength of goals from sopho
more two-meter Michael Bury and Hop
kins. and looked to be in control early.
UCLA managed to pick up two goals in
the final minutes of the second period, but
the Cardinal saw the halftime tie as a small
victory.
"Normally [the Bruins] are a team that
comes out really hard, so to be tied 2-2 in

the second quarter was huge," junior two
meter defender J.J. Garton said. "We
thought that shutting them down early
would be really critical for us."
But the Cardinal quickly found them
selves falling behind, as the UCLA offense
exploded for four goals in the third period
of play. After the Bruins stretched their
lead to three with just 34 seconds remain
ing on the third-period clock, Stanford
head coach John Vargas called a timeout
and, even from the stands, could be heard
telling his players to "get [their] heads in
the game."
Although the Cardinal failed to score
on their subsequent possession, the Stan
ford squad started to turn the tide in the
final stanza.
Redshirt sophomore Ryan Fortune
forced a turnover on UCLAs first posses
sion of the period, and after Stanford
gained a six-on-five advantage. Bury fired
a shot through a sea of arms to bring the
Cardinal back within two. Less than a
minute later, Stanford caught a break
when Bury buried a skip-shot under the
arm of Bruin goalie Will Didinger, cutting
the deficit to 6-5.
UCLA attacker Logan Powell tem
porarily broke the Cardinal's momentum
with a tally at 4:44, but the Stanford de
fense would yield no more scores for the
remainder of regulation play.
Hindle-Katel picked up a key goal at
2:50, separating himself from his defender
to take a pass from Hopkins before firing
the ball into the back of the cage. The Car
dinal finally managed to pull even with the
