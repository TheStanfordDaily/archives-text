# PEPPERDINE ALSO DEFEATED SUNDAY
## Polo thrills past UCLA 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
A little over a month ago, the No. 3 Car
dinal (15-3, 4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) faced defending national
champion UCLA in the semifinals of the
SoCal Open tournament. It was the first
meeting between the two water polo teams
since last season's NCAA title game, and
the Stanford men rose to the occasion,
handing then-top-ranked UCLA its first
loss of the season in thrilling fashion.
It was a memorable victory for fresh
man two-meter Will Hindle-Katel — one
that he did not expect to see rivaled in ei
ther dramatics or emotional satisfaction
any time soon.
"To beat [UCLA] down there in double
overtime, that's about as good as it gets,"
Hindle-Katel had said.
But Stanford's victory over the Bruins
(15-5,2-1) this weekend at Avery Aquatic
Center might have been just a little bit bet
ter. In the final period of regulation, the
Cardinal stormed back from a three-goal
deficit to tie the score at seven apiece, and
they completed their comeback by
outscoring UCLA 2-1 in overtime to claim
the 9-8 victory.
The Cardinal built a 2-0 lead in the first
half on the strength of goals from sopho
more two-meter Michael Bury and Hop
kins. and looked to be in control early.
UCLA managed to pick up two goals in
the final minutes of the second period, but
the Cardinal saw the halftime tie as a small
victory.
"Normally [the Bruins] are a team that
comes out really hard, so to be tied 2-2 in

the second quarter was huge," junior two
meter defender J.J. Garton said. "We
thought that shutting them down early
would be really critical for us."
But the Cardinal quickly found them
selves falling behind, as the UCLA offense
exploded for four goals in the third period
of play. After the Bruins stretched their
lead to three with just 34 seconds remain
ing on the third-period clock, Stanford
head coach John Vargas called a timeout
and, even from the stands, could be heard
telling his players to "get [their] heads in
the game."
Although the Cardinal failed to score
on their subsequent possession, the Stan
ford squad started to turn the tide in the
final stanza.
Redshirt sophomore Ryan Fortune
forced a turnover on UCLAs first posses
sion of the period, and after Stanford
gained a six-on-five advantage. Bury fired
a shot through a sea of arms to bring the
Cardinal back within two. Less than a
minute later, Stanford caught a break
when Bury buried a skip-shot under the
arm of Bruin goalie Will Didinger, cutting
the deficit to 6-5.
UCLA attacker Logan Powell tem
porarily broke the Cardinal's momentum
with a tally at 4:44, but the Stanford de
fense would yield no more scores for the
remainder of regulation play.
Hindle-Katel picked up a key goal at
2:50, separating himself from his defender
to take a pass from Hopkins before firing
the ball into the back of the cage. The Car
dinal finally managed to pull even with the
Bruins with just over a minute left to
play.
Senior captain Peter Varellas
stepped up in the defensive zone to
pick off the ball from the UCLA two
meter man and sent the Cardinal on
the counterattack. Hopkins called
frantically for the outlet and took it
down to the low right wing. He then
sent a pass across the middle to a cut
ting Varellas, who buried the shot that
tied the game at seven and elicited a
chorus of shouts and fist pumps from
every member of the Cardinal squad.
The Stanford defense took care of

the rest, shutting down the UCLA at
tack for the final 1:24 of the period and
allowing only a single goal in the two
periods of overtime play. Hopkins
provided all the firepower the Cardi
nal would need to win the game, scor
ing once on a penalty shot and again
with 15 seconds remaining to seal the
victory for the Cardinal.
Although the game wasn't a per
fect effort for Stanford,it was effective
enough to hand the Bruins their third
defeat in three meetings with the Car
dinal this year.
"We got a little bit tentative on of
fense at certain critical times, but the
difference was our counterattack."
Varellas said. "Wc try to wear teams
down as much as wc can all game long,
and sometimes the benefit of doing
that comes out in the fourth quarter.

That's exactly what happened when
we finally started pushing the counter
later in the game."
Despite the success of the counter,
both Varellas and Garton agreed that
the Cardinal's success wouldn't have
been possible without stellar play at
the two-meter mark in both ends of
the pool.
"Will, Michael and J.J. — they
were doing a really good job getting
position," Varellas said. "They were
forcing drops, so the other team was
allowing perimeter guys to be open
and giving up outside shots. We didn't
have that many six-on-five opportuni
ties, but we got the open perimeter
shots instead. So those goals are com
ing from other places, but it all starts
with our two-meter play."
"Our two-meter defenders were

huge this weekend," Garton added.
"Schwartz, Fortune and [Peter] Fin
layson did an amazing job shutting
down (UCLA's) two-meter men.
That's something that doesn't come
out statistically, but those guys played
a huge role in this weekend."
On Sunday, the Cardinal battled a
tough No. 5 Pepperdine squad in a
contest that once again wasn't decided
until the final minute of play. Stanford
won 11-9 after sophomore goalie
Sandy Hohener came up with a
tremendous save on the Waves' last
drive of the game and then sent a per
fect outlet pass to set up a Varellas
score that decided the match. With the
win. the Cardinal remained perfect at
home and head to Southern Califor
nia next weekend, undefeated in
MPSF play.
