# Crew competes at Rancho Cordova, women's JV beats varsity
## 
### EMILY CRAMER 
It's rare to see junior varsity teams in collegiate sports, much
less J V teams who can match or even beat a varsity squad. This
past Saturday at Head of the American Regatta, in Rancho
Cordova, Calif., Stanford women's crew watched its JV boat
pull off this rare feat.
The women's varsity eight finished sixth, just behind the J V
squad, which came in fifth. The boat's times were within two
seconds within each other, with the faster JV completing the
race in 17:36. Since fall head races are started on intervals and
timed, there was no tense finish battle between the two boats.
The times simply indicate two boats trying to hit their stride.
"We just couldn't hit the same rhythm that we had been get

ting in practice," senior varsity stroker Sam Magee said.
Instead of reflecting negatively on the varsity, Magee said
that she was excited about the JV's strong showing, adding it
boded well for team depth. She noted the room for improve
ment on varsity but was confident in the team's ability to make
adjustments for the rest of the season.
"We still have a couple of big steps we need to take, but
we're on track and where we need to be for right now," she said.
The regatta went smoothly for the remaining women's
boats, which included two pairs' teams and a double. A double
uses sculling strokes, where each rower uses two oars, while the
pairs use sweep strokes with only one oar per rower.The small
er boats put together solid results, considering that the Stan
ford women were focusing heavily on the eights.

McGee and sophomore Carly York rowed a double, which
came in second with a time 0f20:35.The pair race winners were
Stanford's freshman Stephanie Morrison and sophomore
Stephanie Connolly with a time of 20:31.The duo represented
Canada in a pairs boat at the U-23 World Championships this
past summer. Stanford's other pair, freshman Kerry Birk and
junior Alexis Peterson, finished second with 20:57.
In its collegiate debut, the women's novice boat tied for first
with California in a time of 18:58, affirming preseason praise
from coaches.
A surprising result, perhaps foreshadowing a shake-up in
Cal's dominance of women's crew, was the Bears' lopsided sec
ond place finish to Southern California this weekend in the
eight.The Trojans handed Cal their loss by a sizable 38 seconds.
With the noticeable absence of Cal in the men's races, save
the novice eight, the Stanford varsity men gave a demonstra
tion of their power on the water. The varsity eight cruised to a
relatively easy win with a time of 16:06. They had a cushion of
nearly 25 seconds on the second place UC-Davis, but the team
still looks for improvement.
"We'll just need to work on getting a lot of kinks out," said
sophomore three-seat Justin Brown. "The 1 lead of the Ameri
can is usually a regatta that the varsity goes to more for race ex
perience than to actually see how it fares against the competi
tion."
Brown mentioned the eights' comfort level with higher
stroke rates and the coxswain's navigation of tough head race
turns, as areas the team will attempt to perfect.
Four of Stanford's experienced and strong rowers were
missing from the men's eight and instead raced in the smaller
boat events.
The foursome included juniors Jake Cornelius, Adam
Kreek and Rob Meyer, and sophomore Donnie Simkin, with
freshman Laura Woodyard coxing.They won their event by al
most a minute with a 16:49, then split to take first and second
with their doubles boats.
Cornelius and Kreek were the winning double with a time
of 17:57. Meyer and Simkin took second, 50 seconds behind
their teammates, with 18:47. The doubles were intended to
push the rowers beyond their comfort zone and force them to
continue battling, Cornelius said. 1 le noted that the rowers had
done little sculling in the past year, which added another layer
of difficulty to the race.
The novice men's eight came in third, beaten only by the
dominant Cal novice crews.
The Stanford women got a good look at some of their spring
competition over the weekend, while the men are still waiting
to match up against their main rivals.With their first head races
now complete, both teams have the confidence of experience
heading into more serious competition later this fall.

Women's crew, seen here in action from last spring, took the top two places in doubles this past Saturday at Head of the Amer
ican Regatta, with the all-Stephanie lineup of freshman Stephanie Morrison and sophomore Stephanie Connolly taking the gold.
It's rare to see junior varsity teams in collegiate sports, much
less J V teams who can match or even beat a varsity squad. This
past Saturday at Head of the American Regatta, in Rancho
Cordova, Calif., Stanford women's crew watched its JV boat
pull off this rare feat.
The women's varsity eight finished sixth, just behind the J V
squad, which came in fifth. The boat's times were within two
seconds within each other, with the faster JV completing the
race in 17:36. Since fall head races are started on intervals and
timed, there was no tense finish battle between the two boats.
The times simply indicate two boats trying to hit their stride.
"We just couldn't hit the same rhythm that we had been get

ting in practice," senior varsity stroker Sam Magee said.
Instead of reflecting negatively on the varsity, Magee said
that she was excited about the JV's strong showing, adding it
boded well for team depth. She noted the room for improve
ment on varsity but was confident in the team's ability to make
adjustments for the rest of the season.
"We still have a couple of big steps we need to take, but
we're on track and where we need to be for right now," she said.
The regatta went smoothly for the remaining women's
boats, which included two pairs' teams and a double. A double
uses sculling strokes, where each rower uses two oars, while the
pairs use sweep strokes with only one oar per rower.The small
er boats put together solid results, considering that the Stan
ford women were focusing heavily on the eights.

McGee and sophomore Carly York rowed a double, which
came in second with a time 0f20:35.The pair race winners were
Stanford's freshman Stephanie Morrison and sophomore
Stephanie Connolly with a time of 20:31.The duo represented
Canada in a pairs boat at the U-23 World Championships this
past summer. Stanford's other pair, freshman Kerry Birk and
junior Alexis Peterson, finished second with 20:57.
In its collegiate debut, the women's novice boat tied for first
with California in a time of 18:58, affirming preseason praise
from coaches.
A surprising result, perhaps foreshadowing a shake-up in
Cal's dominance of women's crew, was the Bears' lopsided sec
ond place finish to Southern California this weekend in the
eight.The Trojans handed Cal their loss by a sizable 38 seconds.
With the noticeable absence of Cal in the men's races, save
the novice eight, the Stanford varsity men gave a demonstra
tion of their power on the water. The varsity eight cruised to a
relatively easy win with a time of 16:06. They had a cushion of
nearly 25 seconds on the second place UC-Davis, but the team
still looks for improvement.
"We'll just need to work on getting a lot of kinks out," said
sophomore three-seat Justin Brown. "The 1 lead of the Ameri
can is usually a regatta that the varsity goes to more for race ex
perience than to actually see how it fares against the competi
tion."
Brown mentioned the eights' comfort level with higher
stroke rates and the coxswain's navigation of tough head race
turns, as areas the team will attempt to perfect.
Four of Stanford's experienced and strong rowers were
missing from the men's eight and instead raced in the smaller
boat events.
The foursome included juniors Jake Cornelius, Adam
Kreek and Rob Meyer, and sophomore Donnie Simkin, with
freshman Laura Woodyard coxing.They won their event by al
most a minute with a 16:49, then split to take first and second
with their doubles boats.
Cornelius and Kreek were the winning double with a time
of 17:57. Meyer and Simkin took second, 50 seconds behind
their teammates, with 18:47. The doubles were intended to
push the rowers beyond their comfort zone and force them to
continue battling, Cornelius said. 1 le noted that the rowers had
done little sculling in the past year, which added another layer
of difficulty to the race.
The novice men's eight came in third, beaten only by the
dominant Cal novice crews.
The Stanford women got a good look at some of their spring
competition over the weekend, while the men are still waiting
to match up against their main rivals.With their first head races
now complete, both teams have the confidence of experience
heading into more serious competition later this fall.
