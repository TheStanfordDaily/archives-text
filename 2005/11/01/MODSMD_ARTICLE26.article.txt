SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” An explosive three
alarm structure fire burned in a downtown industrial
area Monday afternoon, sending plumes of black
smoke over the city.
It took firefighters about an hour to extinguish the
blaze, as the smell of burning rubber tires pervaded
the site close to the city's Mission District.
"There were probably at least 15 explosions," said
David Grace, 50, who said he was about a block away
when the blaze broke out. "One of them was so big
that we felt the heat on our face."
The fire started around 3 p.m.. when heavy smoke
was reported in the back of a Hertz Equipment Rental
lot, said Pete Howes, a San Francisco Fire Department
spokesman.

Propane tanks were stored at the business, which
has a propane filling station and rents out construction
equipment.
Howes said the blaze spread to an abandoned
house that was adjacent to the back of the lot.
Don Shugrue, 58. said he heard about a dozen ex
plosions from his apartment across the street. He said
his building shook with each blast.
"I just heard a bang and then another bang and I
looked out the windows and saw flames shooting up
about 80 feet," he said.
Fire officials did not say what caused the explo
sions, and Hertz employees on the scene declined to
comment.
One person suffered smoke inhalation but refused
treatment. Howes said. No other injuries were imme
diately reported.
