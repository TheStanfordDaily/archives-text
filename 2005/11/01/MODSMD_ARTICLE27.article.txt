## Hurricane Beta hits Nicaragua 
### FILADELFO ALEMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — The rem
nants of Hurricane Beta dropped heavy rain over
parts of Central America on Monday, prompting
forecasters to warn of deadly landslides and flood
ing as the storm began to dissipate.
No injuries or deaths were reported a day atter
the storm crashed ashore in Nicaragua, uprooting
trees and ripping the roofs off houses.
Though the storm's remnants were expected to
drop an additional 4 to 8 inches on already saturat
ed ground. President Enrique Bolanos said his
country had escaped a major catastrophe from
Beta. He pledged to quickly get aid to remote
towns cut off by flooding and landslides.
"No one was injured, no one was killed, thank
God," he said. He added, however, that "it's not
over. Now we have to reconstruct the houses it de
stroyed."
While powerful at times. Beta was a small
storm, with its initial hurricane-force winds ex
tending outward only about 15 miles, said the Na
tional Hurricane Center in Miami.
The record 13th hurricane of this year's At
lantic storm season hit land Sunday near the re
mote town of Sandy Bay Sirpi,2(X) miles northeast
of the capital. Managua, as a Category 2 hurricane
with 105 mph winds, the hurricane center said. It
then weakened to a tropical storm and eventually
became a depression.
Nicaragua's army chief. Gen. Omar
Halleslevens. said Beta had destroyed or damaged
some houses, ripped off building roofs, knocked
down trees and caused some flooding. He said it
also damaged at least one pier.
Thousands of people had been evacuated from
the far northeastern region of Nicaragua on the

Honduras border, where the hurricane was ex
pected to make landfall before it turned to the
south.
Jack Howard, mayor of the central coastal town
of Laguna de Perlas, told local television that 700
people were trapped in Tasbapauni, a town sepa
rated from the mainland by a lagoon.
In Honduras, authorities evacuated more than
7,800 people Sunday from 50 communities north
of the Nicaraguan border after four rivers over
flowed from rain brought by Beta.
Strong winds knocked down signs, fences, trees
and electricity and telephone poles, cutting off
power and communication in hundreds of corn- 1 '
munities and at least two highways were blocked,
said the country's disaster response chief, Hugo
Arevalo.
Flooding damaged rice, corn and bean fields.
High waters also sent snakes out of the jungle into
residential areas, although there were no reports
of snakebites.

The Honduran government set up shelters at
schools and state buildings, while the national soc
cer league suspended all its games. The airports at
La Ceiba and Roatan on the coast were operating
sporadically due to poor visibility, strong winds
and flooding.
President Ricardo Maduro said he had re
quested the help of helicopters at the U.S. air base
at Palmerola, 30 miles north of the capital, to ferry
supplies to flooded areas. He said the government
had begun distributing about 2,000 tons of food
donated by the United Nations.
"We are facing serious danger from the rain,"
Maduro said. "We are staying on alert in nearly
every part of the nation."
Before coming ashore. Beta lashed the Colom
bian island of Providencia with heavy winds, tor
rential rains and high .surf.
At least 30 people were injured on the tiny is
land about 125 miles off Nicaragua's coast, offi
cials said.
