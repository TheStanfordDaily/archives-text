## Annual Madison bash gets ugly 
### MICHAEL GENDALL BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. â€” As the State Street
crowd turned suddenly riotous early Sunday morning,
police resorted to the use of pepper spray to quell the
horde of Halloween revelers for the fourth year in a row.
Madison's Halloween tradition is now in jeopardy, as
indicated by a release Sunday from Madison Mayor
Dave Cieslewicz and Police Chief Noble Wray, which
raised serious questions about the future of the event.
Discussions to cancel the event or limit it are expected
to ensue over the course of next year.
"I was proud of the officers' and commanders' execu
tion of the comprehensive plan," Wray said. "Although
we have plans in place, for the fourth year in a row we
have people coming to State Street to cause disruption
and put my officer's safety at risk."
Officers clad in riot gear met a relatively small portion
of the 100.000-person crowd jumping around and chanti
ng "We want tear gas,""ole ole ole" and more on the 5()0
block of State Street.
In response, police released pepper spray as the crowd
thickened and projectiles were thrown at officers on
horseback.
Aid. Mike Verveer, District 4, who was at the police
command post during the disturbance, said the command
for officers to put on their riot gear came at 1:52 am post

daylight savings time and the command to unleash the
spray came at 2:08 am.
"l"he number one concern for the Madison Police De
partment was the safety of the officers," Verveer said.
"When the crowd is jumping up and down chanting
things like 'USA! USA!" and the soccer chant 'Ole! Ole!
Ole!' and 'We want tear gas,' you know that is a bad omen
for the cops. I don't know what we can do with the jerks
that are hell-bent on picking fights with police."
University of Wisconsin Interim Dean of Students Lori
Berquam, an onlooker during the event both Friday and
Saturday, said she heard partygoers talking about rioting on
Saturday and the mentality of the mob still confuses her.
"What 1 don't get is why people have to act like that,"
Berquam said. "1 don't know why revelers would walk
right up to the police and ask to be pepper sprayed like
that. They just continued to go at a line of police who were
fully armed."
Berquam said except for the discouraging ending on
State Street, the event went as planned.
"Friday was much friendlier. It was very low key,"
Berquam said. "In general it seemed like the people on
State Street weren't overly intoxicated and the police did
a nice job both nights."
Police made 447 total arrests, 178 on Friday and 269 on
Saturday according to the release. Verveer however said
the nature of most arrests is somewhat encouraging for
UW and the future of the event.
