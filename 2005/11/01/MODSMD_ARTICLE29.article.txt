SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
A suicide harrier on the Golden
Gate Bridge would deter suicides,
leading many despondent people
to seek help instead of plunging to
their deaths, experts say.
A review of records by the San
Francisco Chronicle, reported
Sunday, showed there have been
1,218 Golden Gate Bridge sui
cides reported between the time
the bridge opened, on May 27,
1937, and this past Friday. Mental
health experts believe the number
could be higher because some sui
cides go unreported.
And at least 87 percent of peo
ple who have jumped to their
deaths from the bridge are from
the Bay Area, dispelling the no
tion that people travel from
around the world to die here, the
newspaper reported.
Golden Gate Bridge district di
rectors voted in March to author
ize a $2 million feasibility study
fora bridge suicide barrier, which
has not yet been fully funded.
Officials at the Eiffel Tower,
Empire State Building and other
suicide landmarks recognized a
crisis years ago and erected sui
cide barriers.
"When suicide becomes diffi
cult. people do not switch to an
other method. They tend to get
help." said Eve Meyer, executive
director of San Francisco Suicide
Prevention and an advocate fora
suicide barrier. "This is what hap
pened in England when the for
mula for gas ovens was changed
(to emit less carbon-monox
ide)...and it became harder for
people to purchase certain over
the-counter drugs. The suicide
rate went down. England has a
suicide rate half the size of ours
because they're so aggressive
about it."
Accessibility is partly what
makes the Golden Gate Bridge
such an attractive suicide spot.
Meyer said.
The railing is only 4 feet high,
and the parking lot is a short dis
tance from the bridge.
"It's something you can ac

complish relatively easily," she
said, "and that's what makes it so
dangerous."
Suicide is "a function of what's
available," added Kay Redfield
Jamison, a psychiatry professor at
Johns Hopkins University and au
thor of "Night Falls Fast: Under
standing Suicide." "Some people
already have the Golden Gate
Bridge in their mind, in the same
way others have a gun in the clos
et."
A recent study by the Psychi
atric Foundation of Northern Cal
ifornia that compiled Marin
County coroner's reports from
January 1995 to July 2005 found
that most of the suicides —75
percent — were men.
The age of the jumpers range
from 14 to 85, with an approxi
mate median age of 41. An esti
mated 26 jumpers have survived,
according to San Francisco Sui
cide Prevention and the Marin
County coroner.
Despite the high numbers, the
newspaper reported that research
dating back almost three decades
shows that many people prevent
ed from killing themselves at the
bridge did not go on to commit
suicide.
In 1978. Richard Seiden,a pro
fessor of behavioral science at the
University of California, Berke
ley. published a study of 515 peo
ple prevented from jumping off
the bridge. He found that only 6
percent went on to kill them
selves.
About 250 people marched
Sunday in San Francisco to raise
money for suicide prevention and
mental health awareness, and
many marchers advocated for the
barrier.
"There's a lot of people walk
ing here that want that barrier
up," said Rachael Friedman, an
organizer of the American Foun
dation for Suicide Prevention's
"Out of the Darkness" walk. The
money raised will be used for pro
grams to prevent suicide.
Hie story in the Chronicle Sun
day was the first in a seven-part
series exploring suicides at the
tourist landmark.
