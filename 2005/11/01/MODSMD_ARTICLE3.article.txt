# Action or merit?
## Prof. Lani Guinier makes the case for affirmative action 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
The first tenured black woman at Harvard Law
School delivered an impassioned defense of affirma
tive action last night at the Law School. Prof. Lani
Guinier's lecture, entitled "Wealth, Race and Merit in
Higher Education," challenged universities to
change the way they look at race and merit in higher
education.

"We need to link admissions to mission; we need
to put the democratic mission hack into admissions,"
the former NAACP Legal Defense lawyer said. "We
need to graduate students who give back, not just
take."
The speech, delivered as part of the Stanford Hu
manities Center Presidential Lecture Series, filled up
one lecture hall and overfilled into another, where it
was telecast. Students from area colleges and the
University community crowded in to hear a woman
well-known in the modern civil rights movement.The

speech drew two applause breaks
and a standing ovation.
Guinier laid out her arguments as
a trial lawyer would in a court of law.
She argued that universities have
public responsibilities, the rhetoric of
merit has diverted schools from ful
filling these responsibilities, affirma
tive action is wrongly presented as a
trade off between merit and diversity,
and then insisted that greater efforts
be made to compensate for what she
described as "fundamental flaws."
"Private universities have public
responsibilities because of their ac
knowledged missions," she said to
begin the core of her first argument.
Calling institutions of higher educa
tion "gateways to opportunity," she
said that universities have a "demo
cratic duty to educate and train lead
ers and citizens of tomorrow."
Guinier believes that what she de
scribes as the "religion of merit" has
"disguised and diverted schools from
fulfilling their responsibility" to work
toward the common good.
"Higher education has become a
gift from the poor to the rich," she
added. "The poor subsidize colleges
with taxes, but the people who get to
go to the best institutions are the
wealthiest."
The problem, according to
Guinier. is that universities measure
merit based on standardized tests,
which have little to do with their pub
lic mission.
"Standardized tests are based on
quick strategic guessing with less
than perfect information," she said,
pointing to a study conducted by a
Princeton professor which found that
the 25 percent of the wealthiest
Americans occupy 75 percent of
seats at top universities. "Tests select
people who are already quite privi
leged so they can get their status cre
dentials at places like Stanford. . .

"Higher education has become a gift from the poor to
the rich. The poor subsidize colleges with taxes,
but the people who get to go to the best
institutions are the wealthiest

[The SAT] converts wealth into the
language of merit."
Guinier used the same metaphor
of the "Miner's Canary" she em
ployed in her most recent book of the
same name to describe race relations
in America today. Before the advent
of modern mining equipment, miners
would carry a canary into the mine to
warn them of atmospheric dangers.
Since the canary's iespiratory system
was weaker than humans,' the miners
would know to escape the mine if the
bird stopped breathing.
"The experience of the canary in
the mine is much like minorities in
America today," she said, saying both
were highly visible, vulnerable and
"gasping for air."
"It's time to give the canary a gas
mask or a pint-sized respirator," she
said. She argued for racial and eco
nomic affirmative action as effec
tive strategies to compensate for
fundamental flaws in the system.
"Race functions as a language of
class. Affirmative action becomes
the vehicle for expressing a sense of
disenfranchisement because univer
sities are not fulfilling their public
responsibilities."
Guinier said she supported a more
radical approach to change the at
mosphere in the proverbial mine.
"The canary is a diagnostic tool
suggesting maybe we are focusing on
the wrong kinds of criteria in the
name of merit," she said. "We need to
rethink the way we admit rather than
thinking around the margins to try to

legitimate the otherwise poisonous
atmosphere."
Guinier pointed to efforts by the
University of Texas and Clark Uni
versity in Massachusetts that have
not been panaceas but have in
creased minority access to higher ed
ucation.
Prof. Pam Karlan, associate dean
at the Stanford Law School who
worked for Guinier when she was at
the NAACP,said she feels that the ca
nary metaphor aids in illustrating the
problem.
"The miners have been fooled
into thinking they have more in com
mon with the owners of the mine
than with the canaries," Kaplan said
in an interview with The Daily. "Lani
is tremendously inspirational at get
ting people think about democracy
as more than voting. She under
stands that it is really important to
build alliances that might not other
wise be built."
"Her statement on affirmative ac
tion made me consider how we need
to fix the whole and not focus so
much on affirmative action alone,"
said Nikole Richardson, a doctoral
student at the School of Education.
"We need more people who know
about these kinds of things. We need
more people to incorporate what she
is saying. We need to follow through,"
said Deanna Lewis, a master's stu
dent in the School of Education's Pol
icy, Organization and Leadership
Studies program.
Her classmate. Jessica Rigby, also

a master's student in education, re
flected on how radical and contradic
tory Guinier's claims were in com
parison to accepted education doc
trine and to what is taught in their ac
ademic programs.
"Our Stanford professors tell us
one thing, and she comes to say the
opposite. In a lot of our classes, they
have presented a lot of information
that is contradictory to what she said
tonight," Rigby said.
Guinier graduated from Radcliffe
College and attended Yale Law
School, where she met Bill and
Hillary Clinton. She worked in the
Carter Justice Department, spent
seven years as a litigator for the
NAACP and has been tenured at
both the University of Pennsylvania
and Harvard.
In 1993, President Bill Clinton
nominated her to serve as the assis
tant attorney general in charge of
civil rights. After Guinier was at
tacked by the right as a "quota
queen," Clinton was forced to with
draw the nomination. In his introduc
tion before the speech. Psychology
Prof. Claude Steele said the attacks
on her were a result of "absolutely
brilliant law reviews" being "misrep
resented by the right."
"It's clear that in Washington, po
litical appointments are proxies for
political fights," Guinier said in an in
terview with The Daily.
She did not see much in the com
parison some in the media have made
in recent days between her and now
withdrawn Supreme Court nominee
Harriet Miers. However, she did say
that she believes that it is easier to
dismiss women in the U.S. political
culture.
"We don't bestow the same as
sumptions of credibility or compe
tence on women that we often grant
to men," she said.
Based on long-standing precedent
in the Presidential Lecture Series,
Guinier did not take questions. In
stead, there will be a follow-up event
at the Stanford Humanities Center
today from noon to 1 p.m.

with taxes, but the people who get to
go to the best institutions are the
wealthiest."
The problem, according to
Guinier. is that universities measure
merit based on standardized tests,
which have little to do with their pub
lic mission.
"Standardized tests are based on
quick strategic guessing with less
than perfect information," she said,
pointing to a study conducted by a
Princeton professor which found that
the 25 percent of the wealthiest
Americans occupy 75 percent of
seats at top universities. "Tests select
people who are already quite privi
leged so they can get their status cre
dentials at places like Stanford. . .

"Higher education has become a gift from the poor to
the rich. The poor subsidize colleges with taxes,
but the people who get to go to the best
institutions are the wealthiest

[The SAT] converts wealth into the
language of merit."
Guinier used the same metaphor
of the "Miner's Canary" she em
ployed in her most recent book of the
same name to describe race relations
in America today. Before the advent
of modern mining equipment, miners
would carry a canary into the mine to
warn them of atmospheric dangers.
Since the canary's iespiratory system
was weaker than humans,' the miners
would know to escape the mine if the
bird stopped breathing.
"The experience of the canary in
the mine is much like minorities in
America today," she said, saying both
were highly visible, vulnerable and
"gasping for air."
"It's time to give the canary a gas
mask or a pint-sized respirator," she
said. She argued for racial and eco
nomic affirmative action as effec
tive strategies to compensate for
fundamental flaws in the system.
"Race functions as a language of
class. Affirmative action becomes
the vehicle for expressing a sense of
disenfranchisement because univer
sities are not fulfilling their public
responsibilities."
Guinier said she supported a more
radical approach to change the at
mosphere in the proverbial mine.
"The canary is a diagnostic tool
suggesting maybe we are focusing on
the wrong kinds of criteria in the
name of merit," she said. "We need to
rethink the way we admit rather than
thinking around the margins to try to

legitimate the otherwise poisonous
atmosphere."
Guinier pointed to efforts by the
University of Texas and Clark Uni
versity in Massachusetts that have
not been panaceas but have in
creased minority access to higher ed
ucation.
Prof. Pam Karlan, associate dean
at the Stanford Law School who
worked for Guinier when she was at
the NAACP,said she feels that the ca
nary metaphor aids in illustrating the
problem.
"The miners have been fooled
into thinking they have more in com
mon with the owners of the mine
than with the canaries," Kaplan said
in an interview with The Daily. "Lani
is tremendously inspirational at get
ting people think about democracy
as more than voting. She under
stands that it is really important to
build alliances that might not other
wise be built."
"Her statement on affirmative ac
tion made me consider how we need
to fix the whole and not focus so
much on affirmative action alone,"
said Nikole Richardson, a doctoral
student at the School of Education.
"We need more people who know
about these kinds of things. We need
more people to incorporate what she
is saying. We need to follow through,"
said Deanna Lewis, a master's stu
dent in the School of Education's Pol
icy, Organization and Leadership
Studies program.
Her classmate. Jessica Rigby, also

a master's student in education, re
flected on how radical and contradic
tory Guinier's claims were in com
parison to accepted education doc
trine and to what is taught in their ac
ademic programs.
"Our Stanford professors tell us
one thing, and she comes to say the
opposite. In a lot of our classes, they
have presented a lot of information
that is contradictory to what she said
tonight," Rigby said.

The first tenured black woman at Harvard Law

Guinier's lecture, entitled "Wealth, Race and Merit in
Higher Education," challenged universities to
change the way they look at race and merit in higher
education.

"We need to link admissions to mission; we need
to put the democratic mission hack into admissions,"
the former NAACP Legal Defense lawyer said. "We
need to graduate students who give back, not just

and a standing ovation.
Guinier laid out her arguments as
a trial lawyer would in a court of law.
She argued that universities have
public responsibilities, the rhetoric of
merit has diverted schools from ful
filling these responsibilities, affirma
tive action is wrongly presented as a
trade off between merit and diversity,
and then insisted that greater efforts
be made to compensate for what she
described as "fundamental flaws."
"Private universities have public
responsibilities because of their ac
knowledged missions," she said to
begin the core of her first argument.
Calling institutions of higher educa
tion "gateways to opportunity," she
said that universities have a "demo
cratic duty to educate and train lead
ers and citizens of tomorrow."
Guinier believes that what she de
scribes as the "religion of merit" has
"disguised and diverted schools from
fulfilling their responsibility" to work
toward the common good.

added. "The poor subsidize colleges

suggesting maybe we are focusing on
the wrong kinds of criteria in the
name of merit," she said. "We need to
rethink the way we admit rather than
thinking around the margins to try to

legitimate the otherwise poisonous
atmosphere."
Guinier pointed to efforts by the
University of Texas and Clark Uni
versity in Massachusetts that have
not been panaceas but have in
creased minority access to higher ed
ucation.
Prof. Pam Karlan, associate dean
at the Stanford Law School who
worked for Guinier when she was at
the NAACP,said she feels that the ca
nary metaphor aids in illustrating the
problem.
"The miners have been fooled
into thinking they have more in com
mon with the owners of the mine
than with the canaries," Kaplan said
in an interview with The Daily. "Lani
is tremendously inspirational at get
ting people think about democracy
as more than voting. She under
stands that it is really important to
build alliances that might not other
wise be built."
"Her statement on affirmative ac
tion made me consider how we need
to fix the whole and not focus so
much on affirmative action alone,"
said Nikole Richardson, a doctoral
student at the School of Education.
"We need more people who know
about these kinds of things. We need
more people to incorporate what she
is saying. We need to follow through,"
said Deanna Lewis, a master's stu
dent in the School of Education's Pol
icy, Organization and Leadership
Studies program.
Her classmate. Jessica Rigby, also

a master's student in education, re
flected on how radical and contradic
tory Guinier's claims were in com
parison to accepted education doc
trine and to what is taught in their ac
ademic programs.
"Our Stanford professors tell us
one thing, and she comes to say the
opposite. In a lot of our classes, they
have presented a lot of information
that is contradictory to what she said
tonight," Rigby said.
Guinier graduated from Radcliffe
College and attended Yale Law
School, where she met Bill and
Hillary Clinton. She worked in the
Carter Justice Department, spent
seven years as a litigator for the
NAACP and has been tenured at
both the University of Pennsylvania
and Harvard.
In 1993, President Bill Clinton
nominated her to serve as the assis
tant attorney general in charge of
civil rights. After Guinier was at
tacked by the right as a "quota
queen," Clinton was forced to with
draw the nomination. In his introduc
tion before the speech. Psychology
Prof. Claude Steele said the attacks
on her were a result of "absolutely
brilliant law reviews" being "misrep
resented by the right."
"It's clear that in Washington, po
litical appointments are proxies for
political fights," Guinier said in an in
terview with The Daily.
She did not see much in the com
parison some in the media have made
in recent days between her and now
withdrawn Supreme Court nominee
Harriet Miers. However, she did say
that she believes that it is easier to
dismiss women in the U.S. political
culture.
"We don't bestow the same as
sumptions of credibility or compe
tence on women that we often grant
to men," she said.
Based on long-standing precedent
in the Presidential Lecture Series,
Guinier did not take questions. In
stead, there will be a follow-up event
at the Stanford Humanities Center
today from noon to 1 p.m.
