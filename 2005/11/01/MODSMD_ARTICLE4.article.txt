Faculty, students, friends and rela
tives gathered together at the Bech
tel International Center last night to
honor Human Biology Prof. Armin
Rosencranz.The ASSU presented its
annual Teacher of the Year award to
Rosencranz, who specializes in inter
national environmental policies and
South Asian politics.
ASSU's Teacher of the Year
award is Stanford's only teaching
award completely determined by the
student body. Students nominate
their professors and the ASSU judg
ing panel collects, reads, discusses
and then votes on the recipient. The
ASSU received over 2()0 nomina
tions for the award this year.
Anita Mukherjee, the head or
ganizer of the event and one of the 12
student judges who voted on the
award, explained, "We were particu
larly searching fora professor inter
ested in aiding the development of
students. Armin stood out because of
the research and publishing opportu

nities he provides and the confidence
he instills in his students. His nomina
tions were also particularly detailed
and heartfelt."
During both student and faculty
speeches, Rosencranz was praised
repeatedly for his willingness to go
beyond the responsibilities of a Stan
ford professor.
"Armin held our Introductory
Seminar classes in his own living
room last year, creating a really, real
ly chill environment," explained sen
ior political science major David
Loux, one of Rosencranz's advisees.
"At first I thought that might be a
Stanford thing, but now 1 realize it's
an Armin thing. I was considering
dropping Armin's class because the
workload was very intense, but stay
ing in his class was the best decision
I've made at Stanford."
Another of Rosencranz's former
students and current advisees, junior
Jacob Lemiex, remarked. "Armin's
commitment to teaching goes way
beyond the scope of the classroom,
into his home and everyday life. He is
exceptional because of what he does
outside of class."
Rosencranz has published a total
of nine books and over 70 articles. He
