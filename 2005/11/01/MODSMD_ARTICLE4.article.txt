### DAVID STEINHARDT 
Faculty, students, friends and rela
tives gathered together at the Bech
tel International Center last night to
honor Human Biology Prof. Armin
Rosencranz.The ASSU presented its
annual Teacher of the Year award to
Rosencranz, who specializes in inter
national environmental policies and
South Asian politics.
ASSU's Teacher of the Year
award is Stanford's only teaching
award completely determined by the
student body. Students nominate
their professors and the ASSU judg
ing panel collects, reads, discusses
and then votes on the recipient. The
ASSU received over 2()0 nomina
tions for the award this year.
Anita Mukherjee, the head or
ganizer of the event and one of the 12
student judges who voted on the
award, explained, "We were particu
larly searching fora professor inter
ested in aiding the development of
students. Armin stood out because of
the research and publishing opportu

nities he provides and the confidence
he instills in his students. His nomina
tions were also particularly detailed
and heartfelt."
During both student and faculty
speeches, Rosencranz was praised
repeatedly for his willingness to go
beyond the responsibilities of a Stan
ford professor.
"Armin held our Introductory
Seminar classes in his own living
room last year, creating a really, real
ly chill environment," explained sen
ior political science major David
Loux, one of Rosencranz's advisees.
"At first I thought that might be a
Stanford thing, but now 1 realize it's
an Armin thing. I was considering
dropping Armin's class because the
workload was very intense, but stay
ing in his class was the best decision
I've made at Stanford."
Another of Rosencranz's former
students and current advisees, junior
Jacob Lemiex, remarked. "Armin's
commitment to teaching goes way
beyond the scope of the classroom,
into his home and everyday life. He is
exceptional because of what he does
outside of class."
Rosencranz has published a total
of nine books and over 70 articles. He
received the Phi Beta Kappa of
Northern California teaching award
last May and the Stanford Phi Beta
Kappa teaching award in June 2003,
which is voted on by graduating sen
iors. He has taught at schools all
around the world, including locally
at Stanford, UC-Berkeley and the
Golden Gate Law School in San
Francisco, as well as in foreign coun
tries such as India. Bali, Cambodia
and Indonesia.
"Rosencranz's professional ca
reer extends far beyond Stanford,"
explained Shravya Reddy, an Indian
lawyer spending the semester in the
Bav Area through Rosencranz's

India Visiting Fellows Program. "He
has brought 28 different Indian
lawyers to the Bay Area to study and
learn from him and other experts in
the area. Many of the fellows have
gone on to achieve milestones in In
dian environmental law."
His students say that in the class
room, Rosencranz's willingness to
invite students into his home and his
insistence on being called by his first
name creates a unique environment.
"Hearing Armin's former stu
dents speak tonight helped me artic
ulate the intimacy I've felt in his class
this quarter," said Sengupta, a soph
omore and current student of Rosen

cranz. "Learning from Armin is a
humbling and enlightening experi
ence that many different students
have been lucky to have."
Sociology Prof. Stan Wanat. 2004
ASSU Teacher of the Year award
winner said, "Students even talk
about Armin in my classes, about
how he makes them feel comfortable
and about how he always listens."
Rosencranz says that his teaching
strategy is quite simple.
"I want all my students to learn,
not merely absorb," he said.
"Learning is interactive among all
class members, including me. It
comes from stretching the mind by

critical analysis and assessment, not
merely synthesizing what others
have written."
Rosencranz attributed his knack
for teaching to his efforts to make
students feel welcome and comfort
able.
"I try to relate to all of my stu
dents as individuals and make a per
sonal connection with them," he said.
"A dedicated teacher needs to give
his students attention and time."
ASSU Undergraduate Senator
Vang Kou Khang, a sophomore, ex
plained. "It's really an honor to be
able to recognize teachers that help
students in the wav he does."
