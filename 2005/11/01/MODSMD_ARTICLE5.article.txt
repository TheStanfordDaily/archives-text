## Office of the President recognizes volunteers 
### KAITLIN WOOD 
Yesterday marked the beginning
of a series of ceremonies to recog
nize university staff members for
community service work.The Office
of the President plans to honor
three individuals each quarter for
their efforts in volunteerism.
At the first ceremony, which took
place yesterday from noon to 1 p.m.
in Tresidder Union's Oak Room, the
office honored two Stanford staff
members and one Stanford alumna.
Lori Fuller, a student-housing as
sociate in the housing services cen
ter at Lagunita Court, was recog
nized for her work in a campus-wide
clothing drive that she initiated
seven years ago. Gathering articles

such as clothing, furniture, food, ap
pliances and stuffed animals. Fuller
sends the donations to the Urban
Ministry of Palo Alto, an affiliate of
the nondenominational organiza
tion Inn Vision.
Elaine Hill, who runs Urban
Ministry's Clothes Closet, was also
recognized at the lunchtime cere
mony. She works with Fuller to dis
tribute all donations to the over
25,000 homeless people in Santa
Clara County, many of whom are
children and single parents.
Finally, Chelle Pell, the court liai
son officer in Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety, was praised
for rounding up more than 130 bikes
from around campus and distribut
ing them to homeless people. Mill
and Urban Ministry also aided in
this effort, along with Carolyn
Helmke, Stanford's bicycle pro
gram coordinator.
The series of ceremonies was es
tablished by retired Judge LaDoris
Cordell, special counselor to the
president for campus relations, with
assistance from Jeff Wachtel, senior
assistant to University President
John Hennessy.
"This is something that is long
overdue," Cordell said. "The admin
istration at Stanford realizes that
the people who work here and teach
here play an important role in the

community.
Last October, the Office of the
President held its first Community
Treasures Recognition Brown Bag
Lunch, where it recognized over 125
faculty and staff members who vol
unteered for more than 250 organi
zations. While it turned out to be a
big, well-attended event, Cordell
and others hope to honor a few indi
viduals in its second year and get a
more personal look at what they
have accomplished.
"This ceremony gives recogni
tion to people who usually don't get
much attention," Cordell said. "It
also encourages people to volun
teer because they get to see the cool
things other people are doing."
In order to get a closer look at
what each honoree has done.
Cordell interviewed each of the
three women.This allowed guests to
get a better look at who they are,

why they decided to do what they
did and how they did it.
The next ceremony will take
place next quarter, likely in April.
Following the event, ceremonies
will continue each quarter of every
following year.
Since the program will only rec
ognize three people each quarter,
students, staff and community
members are encouraged to e-mail
Cordell to nominate candidates for
the award. Along with others in the
President's Office. Cordell will then
determine who should receive the
honor.
However, she stressed that the
President's Office hopes to ac
knowledge everyone deserving of
recognition and that by no means is
this a competition.
"This is about people being rec
ognized for the good they do," she
said.
