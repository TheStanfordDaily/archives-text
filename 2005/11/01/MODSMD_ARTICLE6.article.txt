## 5-SURE tries to keep up with calls Campus escort service promotes student safety on campus 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford United for Rape Elimination, widely known
as 5-SURE, provides golf cart escort services on the
Stanford campus seven nights a week. However, amid
complaints from students that 5-SURE has been non-re
sponsive to calls this quarter, the organization has clari
fied its role as a safety promoter.
Jeanettte Smith-Laws, the director of Meeting Ser
vices, which operates 5-SURE, emphasized that while
the program realizes that some callers have more legiti
mate concerns than others, employees are instructed not
to make judgments.
"It's not our place to decide who feels safe or unsafe,"
she said. "Even if it's six intoxicated guys who just want
to get from one party to the next, we will add their re
quest to the queue just as we would any other caller. We
do not discriminate."
In response to rumors that 5-SURE has not been
doing its job to promote student safety on campus, em
ployees point out that many times, students are the ones
causing problems.
"The service is often abused by people who are sim

ply too lazy to walk," said senior Josh Merritt, a 5-SURE
employee. "When we are flooded with calls, despite hav
ing three employees picking up and dropping off passen
gers during our peak times, wait times easily eclipse 30
minutes,"
When The Daily called 5-SURE this past Sunday just
before midnight, we had no trouble getting in touch with
a student coordinator. Senior Robert Walker, the repre
sentative who answered the phone, promptly inquired if
an escort was needed. Further inquiries demonstrated
that 5-SURE has been up and running since the second
weekend of the quarter.
"We don't start operating immediately after school
starts," Smith-Laws said. "And the reason for that is we
need to hire staff. We use student drivers, and we have to
train them."
The service also modified its hours of operation last
year. It now runs from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. on weekdays and
9 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. Student
employees confirmed that they have been working since
the second weekend of the quarter under these new
hours.
"If you have doubts you can check our logbook —
we've been receiving calis and picking people up pretty
much since then," Walker said. "I don't know why people
have been unable to contact us — the number is listed in
the 'Unofficial Guide to Stanford
and probably in several other loca
tions."

Smith-Laws informed The Daily
that 5-SURE was doing the best it
could within the current budget. 5-
SURE falls under Meeting Services in
terms of funding.
"The demand is high," Smith-
Laws said. "Could we use more peo
ple? Could we use a bigger budget
and newer vehicles? Sure we could.

But we don't have the funds.The long
wait times are a result of not having
enough vehicles and staffing. I guess
even 10 minutes seems like an eterni
ty when you're trying to get to a party.
But we do try our best to send a driv
er to everyone who calls."
If students need to contact 5-
SURE. they can call (650)725-7873.
