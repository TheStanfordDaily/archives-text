## Alito tapped for high court Democrats wary of nominee's stance on abortion rights 
### ROB FOURNIER ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
nominated veteran judge Samuel Alito for the
Supreme Court yesterday, seeking to reshape the
judiciary and mollify conservatives who derailed
his previous pick. Ready-to-rumble Democrats
said Alito may curb abortion rights and be "too
radical for the American people."
Drawing an unspoken contrast to failed nominee
Harriet Miers, Bush declared that the appeals court
judge "has more prior judicial experience than any
Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years."
Abortion emerged as a potential fault line.
Democrats pointed to Alito's rulings that sought
to restrict a woman's right to abortion. Senate Ju
diciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, a
Republican who supports abortion rights, said
that Alito's views on the hot-button issue "will be
among one of the first items Judge Alito and 1
will discuss."
Alito's mother shed some light. "Of course, he's
against abortion," 90-year-old Rose Alito said of
her son, a Catholic.
Alito. 55, newly installed Chief Justice John
Roberts, 50, and the more than 200 other federal
judges Bush has pushed through the Senate could
give the Republican president a legacy far beyond
his two terms.
In a political twist. Republicans who helped
sink Miers' nomination rallied to Alito's side. A
leading Democrat who backed Miers led the at
tack against Alito.
"The Senate needs to find out if the man replac
ing Miers is too radical for the American people,"
said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Neva
da. He chided Bush for not nominating the first
Hispanic to the court.
"President Bush would leave the Supreme
Court looking less like America and more like an

old boys club," Reid said.
So consistently conservative, Alito has been
dubbed "Scalito" or "Scalia-lite" by some lawyers
because his judicial philosophy invites compar
isons to conservative Supreme Court Justice An
tonin Scalia. While Scalia is outspoken and is
known to badger lawyers, Alito is polite, reserved
and even-tempered.
Given solid Republican support in the Senate
Democrats would have to filibuster to block
Alito's confirmation, a tactic that comes with polit
ical risks. Alito also enjoys the early support of
conservative activists who used their sway in the
Bush White House to derail Miers' nominations.
The fight to nominate Alito, a judge on the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1990, is one
step in Bush's political recovery plan as he tries to
regain his footing after a cascade of troubles
rocked his presidency.
If confirmed by the Senate, Alito would replace
retiring justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a decisive
swing vote in cases involving affirmative action,
abortion, campaign finance, discrimination and
the death penalty.
"The Supreme Court is an institution 1 have
long held in reverence," said the bespectacled
Alito, a former prosecutor and government attor

ney who has argued 12 cases before the Supreme
Court. "During my 29 years as a public servant,
I've had an opportunity to view the Supreme
Court from a variety of perspectives."
Miers had never been a judge.
Praised by Democrats when confirmed fora
Philiadelphia-based appeals court 15 years ago,
Alito has staked out positions supporting restric
tions on abortion, such as parental and spousal
notification.
The jurist from New Jersey favors more restric
tions on abortion rights than either the Supreme
Court has allowed or O'Connor has supported,
based on a 1992 case in which he supported
spousal notification.
Bush called for confirmation by year's end, but
Senate leaders said the vote may wait until next
year.
Wasting no time, Alito went to the Capitol
shortly after the announcement to meet with law
makers. Accompanied by two of his children and
Sen. Majority Leader Bill Frist, Alito paused first
to pay his respects at the coffin of the late civil
rights pioneer Rosa Parks in the Capitol rotunda.
Specter said he would not ask Alito directly
about whether he would overturn Roe v. Wade, the
landmark abortion rights ruling.

If confirmed by the Senate, Alito would replace
retiring justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a decisive
swing vote in cases involving affirmative action,
abortion, campaign finance, discrimination and
the death penalty.
"The Supreme Court is an institution 1 have
long held in reverence," said the bespectacled
Alito, a former prosecutor and government attor

ney who has argued 12 cases before the Supreme
Court. "During my 29 years as a public servant,
I've had an opportunity to view the Supreme
Court from a variety of perspectives."
Miers had never been a judge.
Praised by Democrats when confirmed fora
Philiadelphia-based appeals court 15 years ago,
Alito has staked out positions supporting restric
tions on abortion, such as parental and spousal
notification.
The jurist from New Jersey favors more restric
tions on abortion rights than either the Supreme
Court has allowed or O'Connor has supported,
based on a 1992 case in which he supported
spousal notification.
Bush called for confirmation by year's end, but
Senate leaders said the vote may wait until next
year.
Wasting no time, Alito went to the Capitol
shortly after the announcement to meet with law
makers. Accompanied by two of his children and
Sen. Majority Leader Bill Frist, Alito paused first
to pay his respects at the coffin of the late civil
rights pioneer Rosa Parks in the Capitol rotunda.
Specter said he would not ask Alito directly
about whether he would overturn Roe v. Wade, the
landmark abortion rights ruling.

President George W. Bush announces the nomination of judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush
nominated veteran judge Samuel Alito for the
Supreme Court yesterday, seeking to reshape the
judiciary and mollify conservatives who derailed
his previous pick. Ready-to-rumble Democrats
said Alito may curb abortion rights and be "too
radical for the American people."
Drawing an unspoken contrast to failed nominee
Harriet Miers, Bush declared that the appeals court
judge "has more prior judicial experience than any
Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years."
Abortion emerged as a potential fault line.
Democrats pointed to Alito's rulings that sought
to restrict a woman's right to abortion. Senate Ju
diciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, a
Republican who supports abortion rights, said
that Alito's views on the hot-button issue "will be
among one of the first items Judge Alito and 1
will discuss."
Alito's mother shed some light. "Of course, he's
against abortion," 90-year-old Rose Alito said of
her son, a Catholic.
Alito. 55, newly installed Chief Justice John
Roberts, 50, and the more than 200 other federal
judges Bush has pushed through the Senate could
give the Republican president a legacy far beyond
his two terms.
In a political twist. Republicans who helped
sink Miers' nomination rallied to Alito's side. A
leading Democrat who backed Miers led the at
tack against Alito.
"The Senate needs to find out if the man replac
ing Miers is too radical for the American people,"
said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Neva
da. He chided Bush for not nominating the first
Hispanic to the court.
"President Bush would leave the Supreme
Court looking less like America and more like an

old boys club," Reid said.
So consistently conservative, Alito has been
dubbed "Scalito" or "Scalia-lite" by some lawyers
because his judicial philosophy invites compar
isons to conservative Supreme Court Justice An
tonin Scalia. While Scalia is outspoken and is
known to badger lawyers, Alito is polite, reserved
and even-tempered.
Given solid Republican support in the Senate
Democrats would have to filibuster to block
Alito's confirmation, a tactic that comes with polit
ical risks. Alito also enjoys the early support of
conservative activists who used their sway in the
Bush White House to derail Miers' nominations.
The fight to nominate Alito, a judge on the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1990, is one
step in Bush's political recovery plan as he tries to
regain his footing after a cascade of troubles
rocked his presidency.
If confirmed by the Senate, Alito would replace
retiring justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a decisive
swing vote in cases involving affirmative action,
abortion, campaign finance, discrimination and
the death penalty.
"The Supreme Court is an institution 1 have
long held in reverence," said the bespectacled
Alito, a former prosecutor and government attor
