## California needs to chill out 
### 
You people are really uptight. In
fact I cannot think of a single
place that I've visited that comes
close. Even Cambridge (where you have
to wear a gown to dinner) is chill in com
parison.
This is particularly odd given the
Golden State's reputation as the pre
mier location for the laid back life —
such a reputation that they've actually
made movies about it.
I spent much of my youth dreaming
of California. As I lay in bed at night I
would think of sandy beaches patrolled
by svelte beauties.
However, what drew me in was not
just the Baywatch lifestyle. Rather it
was the idea of not just doing nothing,
but doing nothing well.
And so, believing the spin, I held
onto the dream, I grew up, and I came to
see California for myself. Boy, did I have
it wrong.
This is no idyllic Utopia. No one is re
laxed. Everyone is teetering on a knife
edge. And they don't even know it.
Oh, they pretend to be all under
standing and tolerant and nice. But it's
all just an elaborately constructed act.
The bastards are just trying to brain
wash you.
The passive-aggressive routine
reaches new depths around here. I did
n't think it was possible to demand that
everything should go your way in such a
pleasant fashion.
It seems hardly feasible that you
could batter your adversaries into sub
mission with pleasantries, politeness
and oh-so-earnest empathy.
Empathy's another odd one. Naively
you might suppose that you can't simul
taneously empathize and be so god
damn uptight. However, that depends
on how you do it.
The typical Bay Aryan can be so cer
tain in his earnest advocacy of every sec
ond, third, fourth and fifth rate cause
that any hope of discussion is far beyond
the horizon.
Also occluded, presumable nestling
close to dissenting views, is the idea of
political incorrectness. I think it may ac
tually be possible to offend someone by
stressing the wrong syllable or pausing
at an inappropriate moment.
Of course, if you do manage to nego
tiate the treacherous territory of the
thought police,you're still not free.They
have many ways to make you talk.
Take, for example, lifestyle. No one
just lives out West anymore. Instead,
they live. There's so much healthy vigor
here, it's a little overpowering.
Palo Alto is the only place on the
planet with more locations to buy ob
scure third-world grains than to buy
chips. And of course, said third-world
grains have to come from the right
place. There are people I know who re
fuse to shop at Whole Foods because the
company has sold out to the man.
The living doesn't stop after the
morning mountain of granola. In be
tween your fiber-rich meals you're ex
pected to get out and exert yourself.
And it's not just the government man
dated thrice-weekly cardio; oh no,
everything evocative of exercise is
taken to the extreme.
Simple running isn't enough. Biking
alone? It just doesn't make the cut. That
weekly swim? Insufficient. No, you
gotta be doing it all — it's all about the
triathlon, baby.
It's a sick, twisted, masochistic mind
set that draws you into day-long epic ex
ercise exertions. And. what's worse, it's
contagious.
Before I left for the US of A I used to
spend my free time smoking, drinking
and watching TV. Now. however. I'm a
non-smoking, teetotaling, clean-living
(occasional) runner. My life is ruined.
That whole non smoking thing is an
other odd Californian obsession (sadly
it's begun to contaminate the rest of the
world), and it's one that sums up the
essence of the local uptightness.
The relentless desire to stop people
from doing what they want is carved deep
into the soul of this state. It's not inten
tional (which is a good thing), but it is un
acknowledged (which is a bad thing).
So, there you have it: the real Golden
State. There's not much more to say be
yond a plea: California, step back, relax,
live and let live and chill the fuck out.

Apparently not everyone in this great
state is anal ami misguided. If you're a
California native who wants to he put on
