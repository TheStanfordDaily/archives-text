## Grad students sport clever guises for pumpkin day party 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
1 bet you my Ph.D. Comics collection, bicy
cle helmet and free food fora week that you
wouldn't have recognized your teaching assis
tant last Friday night. Hie graduate student
Halloween party in Hacienda Commons host
ed by the Rains and Escondido Village (EV)
Community Associates (CAs) as well as the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) included
wild dancing, giveaways from the Sixth Man
Club and limbo using the pitchfork of a saucy
female devil. Hie event attracted more than

7()() people.
Though a costume wasn't required, pi
rates, princesses, a Catholic school girl and
even Mr. Clean. Mickey Mouse and Super
man with lacrosse pads for muscles attended.
"Even though we advertised it as costume
optional, we had a very good showing of people
dressed up as all sorts of things," said environ
mental engineering doctoral student and Head
Rains CA Eva Steinle-Darling, who was a lead
planner for the Halloween party. "Costumes
ran the gamut from verv-well-done standard
options such as cats to clever and humorous
ideas such as a FedEx box with gift wrap labeled
'From: God.To: Women.'"
Electrical engineering doctoral student
Geremy I leitz brought a hammer and period
ically used it to hit a couple of quarters. When
people asked him what he s, Heitz would pull
out a slice of cheese from his pocket and reply,
"I'm a quarter-pounder with cheese!"
Rains CA and English doctoral student
Susan Schuyler noted that there were more

creative costumes this year than ever before.
"One guy dressed as the Stanford Gradu
ate Grim Reaper with a sign that said 'death'
on one side and 'of my social life' on the
other," said Schuyler. Xena Warrior Princess
for the night.
Hie indoor dancing area was particularly
packed throughout the evening.
"The music was really easy to dance to,"
said electrical engineering doctoral student
Paul Gurney, who spent the evening dressed
as Harry Potter — complete with wand and
golden snitch — and spun his Hermoine
Granger across the dance floor. "People real
ly seemed to be in the mood to party."
DJ Kwake mixed a popular selection of
1980s music.
"Having DJ Kwake there was a big step
up from past Halloween parties — he's one
of the best all-around DJs on campus." said
alumnus Bryan Kerr.
Rachel Weinstein. Rains CA and comput
er science doctoral student, observed that the
male-to-female ratio seemed evenly split.
"The dance floor had enough people that
you didn't feel like the only one dancing,"said
Weinstein, who was wearing a Sydney Bris
tow Alias costume. "Plus the ratio of guys to
girls seemed much more even than usual,
which is great."
Many were also pleased with the location
of the event.
"For some reason. I think that parties at
Hacienda Commons come out the best from
my experience, present and past." said Alex
Ene,a doctoral student in aeronautics and as
tronautics who dressed as a little boy in paja
mas ready for bed. "The I lalloween party was
the best party I've seen in a while and I think
many people had really good costumes."
Steinle-Darling said she believes that Ha
cienda Commons, with its large courtyard and
dance area, allows people to engage in con
versation and to get to know new people be
fore winding up on the dance floor.
And I leitz said he appreciated the venue
because it provided enough space to be in a
crowd without feeling packed in.
Ultimately, most attendees had the same

reaction that electrical engineering doctoral
student and 1920s gangster Sam Mazin had —
"1 had a great time! There was lots of great
dancing, cool costumes and a big crowd! I'm
looking forward to the next party."
Former Head Rains CA Robert Schaffer,
an electrical engineering doctoral student,
added that he thinks the event is a great
"close-to-home" Halloween party.
"There are lots of parties and other cam
pus I lalloween events that are mainly attend
ed by undergraduates," Schaffer said."l think
graduate students appreciate having an event
specifically for them as evidenced by the large
turnout each year."
Steinle-Darling observed that since the
1 lalloween party is a campus-wide event, it is
"one of the few opportunities for people to
socialize outside of their many 'boxes,' such as
labs, residences and extracurriculars, and to
meet truly new people."
According to CA and medical/doctoral
student Chaßandle Jordan, predecessors to
CAs known as graduate resident assistants
organized the Halloween party in the mid-
I 9905. E:V CAs organized the party from 1999
through 2003 with co-sponsorship from the
GSC, Rains CAs and the Graduate Student
Programming Board (GSPB). Last year, the
GSPB led the planning and coordination ef
forts with the three other graduate groups.
Typically, the event has been held in Hacien
da Commons, except in 2004 when it was held
in the Graduate Community Center (GCC)
which had opened in mid-October.
"Given the isolating nature of the gradu
ate experience and the intensity of our aca
demic programs, social outlets such as the an
nual I lalloween party are a refreshing change
of pace for many students," Jordan said.
GSC Programming Coordinator, educa
tion doctoral student and Girl Gone Wild
Donna Winston said she considered the Hal
loween event"a well-run party that unified a
wide cross-section of graduate students, re
spective both to those collaborating to organ
ize the event and those in attendance to it."
