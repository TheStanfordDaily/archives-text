# PUMPKIN HUNT
## 
### Jenny Allen 
£ r I iwas two afternoons before
Halloween, when all through
JL EV every child was stirring,
even the child in me. Two hundred
pumpkins were placed by the commu
nity associates (CAs) with care, in
hopes that graduate families soon
would be there.

The annual pumpkin patch festival
on Hulme Field at F.scondido Village
(EV) has enlivened the Halloween
spirit on Stanford's campus since
2001.The event, which provides one
free pumpkin per graduate family,
0; is sponsored by the EV Family
CAs and the Graduate Stu

dent Programming

Board (GSPB).
This year the
pumpkins were
protected by a
family of scare
crows wearing

Stanford sweat

shirts prior to being
taken home for the holi
days.
"The pumpkin patch

had a great turnout, bringing a

smile to manv children and their

pa/cnts,"said EV Family CA Desiree
Roberts. "The event serves as a re
minder that we are a part of a fun. fami
ly-oriented little community."
According to event organizer and

EV Family CA Kathleen MacKinnon,
attendees — who consisted primarily of
graduate families in EV with young chil
dren — enjoyed glow necklaces, farm
animal stamps and candy. (Bananas and
grapes were available for the health
conscious). Each of the nine EV family
courtyards also provided smaller activi
ties during the weekend, which included
pumpkin carving and decorating, trick
or-treating and haunted houses.
"The most entertaining part is see
ing many little children — some in cos
tume — running around trying to pick
the right pumpkin," said Assistant
Dean of Graduate Life Andy Hernan
dez. ' ITiis event provides another op
portunity for graduate students and
spouses/partners with children to meet
and have fun with their children."
MacKinnon said she decided to co
ordinate the pumpkin patch so that
more families could meet and form a
cohesive community at Stanford.
"We had a blast," MacKinnon said.
"Plus I was able to meet so many more
of the graduate families and I think it's
important to support our families to
show appreciation to the families and
spouses of our students. For married
students with families, getting through
these academic programs is definitely
a team effort."

Hernandez noted that a large
number of international families are
exposed to how Americans celebrate
Halloween for the first time at the
fall event, turning the pumpkin patch
into a fascinating cultural festivity.
Interestingly, the pumpkin patch
has historically taken place at noon;
which proved to be a popular nap time.

"This year the event was at 1
p.m., which was more convenient
for all the nap-takers who we want
ed to be able to come and join in all
the fun," Roberts said. "In the fu
ture, we should consider holding
the event at least a week before
Halloween, so that everyone can
enjoy their holiday decor a little
longer."
In addition to activities organized
by the EV Family CAs for their re
spective courtyards throughout the
school year, graduate families also
participate in graduate family ice

skating, bowling, the Child Safety
Fair, a children's soccer clinic, house
buying seminars, a spring yard sale
and an end-of-the-year graduate
family carnival.
There are approximately 400
graduate families living in EV with
nearly 450 children, according to es
timates provided by Hernandez.
Currently, the Graduate Life Office
(GLO) does not know how many
off-campus graduate students with
children there are, but the office is
working on a plan to determine this
number, Hernandez said.
