# PUMPKIN HUNT
## 
### Jenny Allen 
£ r I iwas two afternoons before
Halloween, when all through
JL EV every child was stirring,
even the child in me. Two hundred
pumpkins were placed by the commu
nity associates (CAs) with care, in
hopes that graduate families soon
would be there.

The annual pumpkin patch festival
on Hulme Field at F.scondido Village
(EV) has enlivened the Halloween
spirit on Stanford's campus since
2001.The event, which provides one
free pumpkin per graduate family,
0; is sponsored by the EV Family
CAs and the Graduate Stu

dent Programming

Board (GSPB).
This year the
pumpkins were
protected by a
family of scare
crows wearing

Stanford sweat

shirts prior to being
taken home for the holi
days.
"The pumpkin patch

had a great turnout, bringing a

smile to manv children and their

pa/cnts,"said EV Family CA Desiree
Roberts. "The event serves as a re
minder that we are a part of a fun. fami
ly-oriented little community."
According to event organizer and

EV Family CA Kathleen MacKinnon,
attendees — who consisted primarily of
graduate families in EV with young chil
dren — enjoyed glow necklaces, farm
animal stamps and candy. (Bananas and
grapes were available for the health
conscious). Each of the nine EV family
courtyards also provided smaller activi
ties during the weekend, which included
pumpkin carving and decorating, trick
or-treating and haunted houses.
"The most entertaining part is see
ing many little children — some in cos
tume — running around trying to pick
the right pumpkin," said Assistant
Dean of Graduate Life Andy Hernan
dez. ' ITiis event provides another op
portunity for graduate students and
spouses/partners with children to meet
and have fun with their children."
MacKinnon said she decided to co
ordinate the pumpkin patch so that
more families could meet and form a
cohesive community at Stanford.
"We had a blast," MacKinnon said.
"Plus I was able to meet so many more
of the graduate families and I think it's
important to support our families to
show appreciation to the families and
spouses of our students. For married
students with families, getting through
these academic programs is definitely
a team effort."
