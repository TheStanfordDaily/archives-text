## Editorial Young women could be victims if 73 passes 
### 
Proposition 73, which would impose a
parental notification requirement on
minor girls seeking abortions, is easily
the most controversial measure facing Cali
fornia voters on Nov. 8. The initiative would
require that a physician notify the parent or
legal guardian of a pregnant minor at least
48 hours before performing an abortion.
This requirement would not apply in the
case of a medical emergency, and a juvenile
court could waive the requirement if it found
that notification was not in the minor's best
interests.
In the face of all the inflammatory rheto
ric on both sides of the debate, it's particular
ly important for voters to make their deci
sion based on a careful consideration of
what Prop. 73 would actually do. People who
oppose abortions should question whether
the initiative is actually in the interest of the
minors it ostensibly tries to protect. In light
of the serious concerns about the conse
quences of Prop 73, The Daily recommends
that students vote "no."
Most obviously. Prop. 73 would make it
more difficult for some minor girls to get
abortions. Although research has shown that
most minors do talk to their parents before
seeking abortions, some do not. Most stu
dents at Stanford come from caring.support
ive families, and it may be difficult for us to
imagine making such a serious decision
without talking with a parent. Sadly, not
everyone is so fortunate; many pregnant
minor girls have abusive or troubled fami
lies, and notifying their parents will have se
rious repercussions for the girls' safety and
well-being.
The impact of Prop. 73 on victims of sex
ual abuse is a particularly serious concern.
Many minor girls who seek abortions be
came pregnant through such abuse, in some
cases by one of the parents they are required
to notify. For these girls, the requirement
seems counterproductive and possibly dan
gerous.
Although Prop. 73 provides an alterna
tive to parental notification by allowing a
pregnant minor to seek a waiver from a ju
venile court, this alternative is inadequate.
It ignores the reality of the juvenile court
system, which is currently overburdened
with cases. Requiring girls to seek waivers
would only add to the burden. Heavy work
loads force juvenile court judges to hurry
through their cases. This will make it diffi
cult for minor girls to talk about traumatic
personal experiences, and it will increase

the likelihood that judges will make ques
tionable decisions to grant or withhold
waivers.
Moreover, many girls may find it ex
tremely difficult to travel to a juvenile court,
particularly if they are from rural areas or if
they are too young to drive themselves.
There may be long waits at the courthouse,
and they may have to miss school.
If, for whatever reason, girls are unable ei
ther to notify their parents or to get a waiver,
they are likely to seek abortions anyway —
but the abortions they end up getting will be
neither safe nor legal. Students should be con
cerned about this consequence regardless of
whether they are pro-choice or pro-life.
