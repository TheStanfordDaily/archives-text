## SLAC calls for action 
### JOSELES DE LA CRUZ, SHAMALA GALLAGHER CHRIS VAUGHN 
These are bracing times for workers on
campus. Workers at Stanford Hospital,
members of United Stanford Workers
(SEIU Local 715), are re-negotiating their
contract with the University, which expires
on Nov. 4. Meanwhile, members of United
Stanford Workers on the University campus
have re-opened contract negotiations on
health and retirement benefits. Nearly 3,(KK)
workers at Stanford are involved in these ne
gotiations.
Today, workers and students will be rais
ing their voices about these essential issues.
Local 715, the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion, and a host of other student gioups will
be staging a festive "Dia de Los Muertos"
(Day of the Dead) rally and march in White
Plaza at 4 p.m.
The most immediate issues for hospital
workers are wages and benefits (some em
ployees are paid as much as 20 percent lower
than the industry standard in the Bay Area),
job security and a voice over patient care.
Representatives from United Stanford
Workers (USW) report that hospital nego
tiators have been unresponsive to these and
other worker concerns.
Campus workers — groundskeepers,
maintenance workers and dining hall em
ployees— aren't renegotiating their entire
contract like hospital workers, but rather are

discussing the terms of their contract in a
"re-opener," in which the University has
agreed to bargain over retirement and other
benefit concerns. Although the University
was slow to begin negotiations, a strong
show of worker-student solidarity at an Oct.
11 rally helped get talks underway. USW
hopes that an even larger show of support at
the Nov. 2 rally will demonstrate just how
much the Stanford community values and
stands by the workers who keep the Univer
sity running on a daily basis.
Many non-unionized workers on the
Stanford campus continue to lack living
wages, health care for themselves and their
families and the all-important right to organ
ize. Stanford is a long way from being a just
workplace.
Given that our University is a world-class
institution, one would assume that our labor
relations would be just. Sadly, this is not the
case. It took six students an entire week of
fasting in the spring of 2003 before the ad
ministration agreed to create a committee
assigned the task of reviewing its labor poli
cies. However, it's been more than two years,
and the University has failed to seriously ad
dress any of the problems noted by students
and has made commitments only to further
studies and reviews. We have seen no results.
Stanford workers' needs have not
changed. We will continue to advocate fora
code of conduct. A code of conduct
calls for four basic principles: a living
wage, equal pay for equal work, edu
cational opportunities and the right
to organize. The workers should not
have to suffer as the administration
reviews and investigates the obvi
ous: fair labor practices need to be
enacted NOW. Student support in
the ongoing struggle fora code of
conduct is crucial in securing rights
for Stanford's workers.
Leland Stanford himself saw edu
cation as inseparable from class
based justice. In a letter to the Board
of Trustees, Stanford wrote. "I want
an institution to deal particularly
with the welfare of the masses...The
object is more particularly to reach
the multitudes — those people who
have to consider the expenditure of
every dollar."
If we as a student body are to take
our founder's intentions for the Uni
versity seriously, we need to be at
tentive to how Stanford is currently
allocating its expenditures. In a news
release issued on Sept. 12, the Stan
ford Management Company report
ed that its endowment has grown to
$12.4 billion — a percent in

crease in the last year, and an in
crease of $y.4 billion over the past 10
years. Last year, the University had a
budget surplus of $50 million dollars,
while the Stanford Hospital had
over $144 million in surplus in the
last year alone. We need to ask our
selves how this money is being spent
and what our priorities are com
pared to those of the administration.
Overall. Stanford spends about 5
percent of its endowment on each
year's budget. A change of a fraction
of a percent in the amount of the en
dowment that is utilized for Stanford
operations would more than cover
the costs fora worker's decent living
standard now and in retirement.
Thus, we believe that Stanford
should be a visionary and responsi
ble leader for social change by
spending that extra percent.
It is clear that an institution like
Stanford can afford to provide its
workers with a code of conduct.
Hospital and University workers are
making a reasonable request for
their livelihood. Please join the com
munity in letting Stanford know
where its priorities should be by
coming out to the rally at White
Plaza today.
