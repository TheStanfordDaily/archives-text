# More respect for men in uniform
## 
### 
This past weekend I went to Washing
ton. D.C. to run the U.S. Marine Corps
Marathon. I had been training for the
event all summer and was able to raise over
$1,300 fora charity in the process. This was
my second marathon, and I had a good idea
of the amount of work and dedication it
would take. Unfortunately, I somehow neg
lected to factor hundreds of hot Marines in
my training program, so when I got to Wash
ington, I was forced to reconcile my excite
ment to see them with the challenge of com
pleting 26.2 miles while partially-dehydrat
ed.
The only previous exposure I'd had to mil
itary men was from thorough analysis of a
fine contribution to adult cinema called
"Czech Point," in which various internation
al relations unfold alongside a semi-believ
able plot, sizable action, thrilling climax and
a heartwarming denouement in satisfaction
of a successful mission.
My first encounter with a real Marine
took place at the marathon expo when I was
approached by a tall, handsome man in uni
form with large muscular arms sufficient to
protect me from the most dangerous terror
ist.
"What size are you. sir?" he asked as I
awkwardly looked around to see if he was
talking to someone else standing directly be
hind me.
"Medium," I responded as he handed me
my official marathon t-shirt.
"Good luck tomorrow, sir." he said with a
smile. I didn't know whether to salute, shake

his hand or take off my shirt (so that 1 could
put on the marathon t-shirt, of course). I
think he could tell I was nervous, so he gently
placed his hand on my back and patted me
exactly twice. We shared a moment. Then he
quickly pushed me away so that he could
help the next person in line.
It was after this exchange that I began to
realize that I don't have much contact with
real Marines. In fact, as a Ph.D. student at
Stanford, the majority of my personal rela
tionships are with the written words of dead
people." I might like to get to know a Marine
personally," I thought as I reflected on the ex
perience later on, back at my hotel.
On the morning of the race, I arrived at
Arlington Cemetery at 06(H) hours ready to
go. The gun went off, I started running and
everything was going along as planned.
"Marathon schmarathon " I thought as I care
lessly strode over the half-way point. My
pace was right on track, and I was looking
forward to finishing in three hours, 20 min
utes.
At mile 18 disaster struck. My right calf
muscle shot a bolt of pain through my body

and I collapsed in the grass alongside the
marathon route. Sure enough, I had pulled a
muscle and was forced to jog and walk the re
mainder of the marathon. Still, I was deter
mined to finish, even though I knew that my
finishing time would be nowhere near what I
wanted it to he. I felt distressfully broken, in
body and spirit.
As I hobbled to the finish line, I can hon
estly say that 1 would not have made it with
out the support and encouragement of the
U.S. Marine Corps. At each aid station I was
greeted by warm smiles, cool cups of
Gatorade and dozens of Marines encourag
ing me to work through the pain and to give
it my all. They were the best cheering section
a guy could ask for.
As a gay guy. 1 often feel justifiably angry
with the military for its "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell" policy and my own personal objection
to the war in Iraq.Thus, I had taken for grant
ed the fact that real men and women — nice
people just like the ones that supported me
— were sacrificing everything for me. Coin
cidentally, this past week marked the death
of 2,000 men and women in Iraq and
Afghanistan, a statistic that suddenly seemed
much more perceptible. I felt guilty for my in
difference to their endurance and concluded
that my "isolated Ph.D. student" excuse was
not acceptable. I also recognized that a dis
agreement with policy should never translate
into a lack of support for our troops.
Following the race, I was filled with a

sense of pride that 1 had never felt
before. 1 was proud that 1 was able to
finish, even if humbled a bit by my
injury. More importantly, though, I
felt a real connection to the men and
women in the U.S. Armed Forces.
They were there to cheer me on
when I needed them; I will be there
to cheer them on when they need
me.
