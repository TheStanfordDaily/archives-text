# Remember the boom...
## 
### 
I remember quite clearly during my fresh
man year what the seniors reminisced
about — the boom. It was early 2001 and
the market had just taken a turn for the
worse. In some cases, investment banks and
consulting firms had rescinded offers, and
Phi Beta Kappa seniors were moaning that
they would probably be living with their par
ents fora while. As if their situation wasn't al
ready depressing enough, they were living
among a bunch of annoyingly enthusiastic
freshmen just introduced to the wonders of
massive intoxication and Exotic Erotic, back
when the administration looked the other
way.
The campus was lax during my first couple
of years at Stanford; I had slipped in just
under the wire. The University held a policy
that it should respect the ability of students
to make personal decisions, and so MIPs
were extraordinarily rare, RAs often bought
or served us alcohol, parties raged until 5 a.m.
and cops never entered the dorms.The one or
two all-campus weekend parties you experi
ence today were 10-fold in number and qual
ity five years ago. And although these times
were fairly lax. obviously more so than the
campus today, the seniors I spoke to remem
bered an even more permissive time.
The year before I arrived, students could

use dorm funds to purchase alcohol, includ
ing all-frosh dorms (the seniors in my fresh
man dorm found the policy change so absurd
that they purchased "decorations" instead).
The year before our Pro Fro weekend, the vis
iting high schoolers didn't have to sign a no
drinking pledge. The University at the time
was effectively funding an anything goes cul
ture. one that certainly complemented the
euphoria of the time. I mean, who really cares
that some kids are romping around on pri
vate property, pushing each other under the
bushes, giggling, as they enjoy the occasional
mind-altering substance when:
a) Everybody is getting rich; as in. you could
just sit on your ass and watch your Palo Alto
plot appreciate millions?
b) The I-banks have moved their recruiting
effort to Foothill College?

c) A buddy just IPOed dogshit.com and is
throwing a $5(),()(K) housewarming party at
the new mansion in Atherton?
d) You're a part of the hottest institution on
the planet, located in Silicon Valley-a rising
Venice in its unparalleled global might —
and everybody back home wants to know
just what the hell is going on out there?

Times were good. Real good. But then, as
the economy went sour, things gradually
began to change. Just as prohibition was pol
icy during the Great Depression, the frats
and dorms were asked to go through increas
ingly stringent party planning procedures, al
cohol was made less accessible to students
and the frats and dorms were forced to shut
down their parties much earlier. As I under
stood it, the University reacted to a heavily
publicized drinking death at MIT. instituting
reforms to avoid institutional liability in the
case of such a drinking incident. The change
in policy nonetheless coincided perfectly
with the downturn. Game over, thanks for
playing. Just like the market, we were all
tapped out on the fun.

ther than the boom. Apparently in
the 1980s, freshmen would order
kegs to be delivered directly to their
dorm rooms within the first week of
school. And alumni from the 1960s
and 1970s report ridiculous shenani
gans, like stealing the campus fire
truck in a drunken frenzy and blow
ing out rival frats windows with the
fire hose. From what I understand,
the University has slowly, over the
past few decades, phased out an un
inhibited, camp-like social atmos
phere as one step in making Stan
ford a more academic institution.
I, of course, would not suggest that
one era is better or one policy more
right, than the other. I'll leave that up
to you. You've got to hand it to Stan
ford. With the Princeton Review call
ing us the happiest students with the
second best quality of life, the admin

istration has arguably spawned the
Earth's preeminent university in half
the lifetime of the average Ivy
League. On the other hand, things
have changed socially, and the collec
tive memory of the student body is
short. The policies change gradually,
the hand of the administration
steady and insistent, with the greater
sweep of events lost on students.
So to all you little frosh newly ar
rived on campus, and sophomores
returned to the Farm, I hope you
have a good year. I have no idea how
it is these days; I don't really care. I'll
be in SF or at the dogshit.com man
sion having a beer. It's up to you to
determine how you will make your
fun and fortune, but don't be afraid
to inquire how it used to be. Silicon
Valley may have lost its buzz for
now, but once it hits the lips... well,
vou know the rest.

ents fora while. As if their situation wasn't al
ready depressing enough, they were living
among a bunch of annoyingly enthusiastic
freshmen just introduced to the wonders of
massive intoxication and Exotic Erotic, back
when the administration looked the other
way.
The campus was lax during my first couple
of years at Stanford; I had slipped in just
under the wire. The University held a policy
that it should respect the ability of students
to make personal decisions, and so MIPs
were extraordinarily rare, RAs often bought
or served us alcohol, parties raged until 5 a.m.
and cops never entered the dorms.The one or
two all-campus weekend parties you experi
ence today were 10-fold in number and qual
ity five years ago. And although these times
were fairly lax. obviously more so than the
campus today, the seniors I spoke to remem
bered an even more permissive time.
The year before I arrived, students could

use dorm funds to purchase alcohol, includ
ing all-frosh dorms (the seniors in my fresh
man dorm found the policy change so absurd
that they purchased "decorations" instead).
The year before our Pro Fro weekend, the vis
iting high schoolers didn't have to sign a no
drinking pledge. The University at the time
was effectively funding an anything goes cul
ture. one that certainly complemented the
euphoria of the time. I mean, who really cares
that some kids are romping around on pri
vate property, pushing each other under the
bushes, giggling, as they enjoy the occasional
mind-altering substance when:
a) Everybody is getting rich; as in. you could
just sit on your ass and watch your Palo Alto
plot appreciate millions?
b) The I-banks have moved their recruiting
effort to Foothill College?

c) A buddy just IPOed dogshit.com and is
throwing a $5(),()(K) housewarming party at
the new mansion in Atherton?
d) You're a part of the hottest institution on
the planet, located in Silicon Valley-a rising
Venice in its unparalleled global might —
and everybody back home wants to know
just what the hell is going on out there?

Times were good. Real good. But then, as
the economy went sour, things gradually
began to change. Just as prohibition was pol
icy during the Great Depression, the frats
and dorms were asked to go through increas
ingly stringent party planning procedures, al
cohol was made less accessible to students
and the frats and dorms were forced to shut
down their parties much earlier. As I under
stood it, the University reacted to a heavily
publicized drinking death at MIT. instituting
reforms to avoid institutional liability in the
case of such a drinking incident. The change
in policy nonetheless coincided perfectly
with the downturn. Game over, thanks for
playing. Just like the market, we were all
tapped out on the fun.

ther than the boom. Apparently in
the 1980s, freshmen would order
kegs to be delivered directly to their
dorm rooms within the first week of
school. And alumni from the 1960s
and 1970s report ridiculous shenani
gans, like stealing the campus fire
truck in a drunken frenzy and blow
ing out rival frats windows with the
fire hose. From what I understand,
the University has slowly, over the
past few decades, phased out an un
inhibited, camp-like social atmos
phere as one step in making Stan
ford a more academic institution.
I, of course, would not suggest that
one era is better or one policy more
right, than the other. I'll leave that up
to you. You've got to hand it to Stan
ford. With the Princeton Review call
ing us the happiest students with the
second best quality of life, the admin

istration has arguably spawned the
Earth's preeminent university in half
the lifetime of the average Ivy
League. On the other hand, things
have changed socially, and the collec
tive memory of the student body is
short. The policies change gradually,
the hand of the administration
steady and insistent, with the greater
sweep of events lost on students.
So to all you little frosh newly ar
rived on campus, and sophomores
returned to the Farm, I hope you
have a good year. I have no idea how
it is these days; I don't really care. I'll
be in SF or at the dogshit.com man
sion having a beer. It's up to you to
determine how you will make your
fun and fortune, but don't be afraid
to inquire how it used to be. Silicon
Valley may have lost its buzz for
now, but once it hits the lips... well,
vou know the rest.
