# NEW DEVELOPMENTS
## Sand Hill Road project to reopen Friday 
### GERRY SHIH DESK EDITOR 
The Sand Hill Road Improvement Project is at
last nearing completion, about 18 months since it
first began. The Stanford Management Company
has announced that the last major element of the
project — the widening of Santa Cruz Avenue be
tween Sand Hill Road and Junipero Serra Boule
vard — has been completed and the avenue is
scheduled to reopen this Friday.
With the majority of the project work now fin
ished, construction crews will spend a few more
weeks finalizing minor details in time to meet the
project deadline of December 2005.
According to its official construction updates,
the major goals of the dual-phased project, which
began in April 2004, were to "improve area-wide
access and circulation, bicycle and pedestrian safe
ty, as well as provide enhancements to the San Fran
cisquito Creek habitat and corridor landscaping."
Major elements of the project have included the
improvement of two critical intersections along
Santa Cruz Avenue and the widening of certain
stretches of Sand Hill Road, Santa Cruz Avenue
and the existing bridge over San Francisquito
Creek. In addition, numerous improvements were
made for bicyclists and pedestrians, including a new
landscaped multi-use path that will stretch along
Sand Hill Road and Alpine Road.
After a year-and-a-half wait, the Stanford com
munity will finally have full access to neighboring
Menlo Park and Interstate 280 via the Sand Hill
Road corridor.
"Stanford benefits as the region does," Universi
ty Director of Community Relations Jean McCown
said. "There's a better transportation and circula
tion system for the local area."
For some students, the reopening of the area's
roads are welcome tidings.
"Even though I lived but two minutes from
Stanford in Sharon Green Apartments this sum
mer, it took me seven minutes to get to campus each
day because of the construction on Santa Cruz,"
lamented junior Ryanne Brown. "Biking was even
more of a pain, because Sand Hill Road does not
have defined bike lanes on the entire route. I live on
West Campus now and am eagerly awaiting two
minute drives to 'secret' Safeway when the con
struction is complete."
Cycling concerns should abate once the multi
use path opens to users, and the Safeway — previ
ously accessible from campus only after a long de
tour — should also see increased business after this
Friday.
"If I wanted to get to the Safeway on Sand Hill,
I had to go all the way around [to Page Mill Road]
and get on [Interstate] 280 then get off again at
Sand Hill," said sophomore Jeff Hillman. However,
he hardly lost sleep over the obstacles presented by
the construction projects. "I don't think it's a hassle
because I can just go to the Safeway on El Camino."
