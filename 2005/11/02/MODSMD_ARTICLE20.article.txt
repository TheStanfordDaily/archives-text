# Honoring past Cardinal now representing in Da League
## 
### 
With baseball season having finally come to
a close, pro football playing through its
midseason lull and a lack of any incredible
stunners in the world of college football (note the
hint of disappointment in this last comment), the
sports world was in need of a spark this week.
The igniter? The tipoff of the NBA season.
All previewing aside, competition on the court is
finally at hand. With yesterday's season-opening tip,
one can only hope that talk of the newly-imple
mented league dress code diminishes, and stories of
the best basketball in a recent memory emerge.
Although not a single Stanford alumnus was in
action on opening night, a number of recognizable
names (who once strode through the main quad and
biked through the Intersection of Death) will defi
nitely see action this year after being penciled in as
projected starters for their respective teams. Five
Stanford alumni could have their names found on
opening night rosters around the league.
And if only because they once gave the student
section something to cheer about here on the Farm,
I will inform you of the current status of each one of
these players (in order of seniority):
Brevin Knight, point guard, Charlotte Bobcats,
ninth NBA season.
Knight, a four-year star on the Farm, averaged 15
points and seven assists during his Stanford career,
capping it off with a consensus second-team Ail-
American selection in 1997. He was selected by the
Cleveland Cavaliers with the 16th pick in the 1997
NBA Draft and has been a solid contributor at point
guard despite earning the "journeyman" label (the
Bobcats are his seventh team).
But Knight is coming off a career-year in which
he finished second in the league in assists (nine per
game) and fifth in steals (1.98 per game), despite
playing less than 30 minutes per game. Look for him
to begin the season as Charlotte's starting point
guard and mentor the Bobcats' 2(X)5 fifth-overall
draft pick, Raymond Felton.
Mark Madscn, center-forward, Minnesota Tim
berwolves,sixth NBA season.
Madsen, the quintessential career role player,
will be best remembered for his role in the 2(K)1,
2002 and 2003 Los Angeles Lakers championship
runs (which came in his first three seasons following
a four-year Stanford career).
In his time on the Farm, Madsen averaged 11
points per game and was selected to second and
third-team All-American squads by several publi
cations following his senior season. He was drafted
by the Lakers with the 29th overall pick in 2000, and
though he won't be seen as an offensive force, Mad
sen will likely serve as Kevin Garnett's primary
backup at power forward and provide the I"Wolves
with an energy boost off the bench.
Jarron Collins, center-forward, Utah Jazz, fifth
NBA season.
Collins, a mainstay in Salt Lake City over the
past four years, spent four years at Stanford with his
twin brother. Jason, before heading off to the NBA.
On the Farm, he rose from role player to star status
and averaged nearly 13 points and seven rebounds
per game his senior year.
Collins was drafted with the 53rd pick in the 2001
NBA draft by the Jazz and has been an on-and-off
starter at center and power forward ever since. This
year, Collins will likely be coming off the bench as
the first replacement for Carloz Boozer at power
forward, and he adds to the Jazz's depth at center.
Over the course of his young career. Jarron has av
eraged nearly six points and four rebounds in ap
proximately 20 minutes per game.

Jason Collins, center-forward.
New Jersey Nets, fifth NBA season.
llie other half of the Collins twin
set. Jason left Stanford with two
years of NCAA eligibility remaining
despite actually spending four years
on the Farm (he was forced to red
shirt his first two years due to in
jury).
In his fourth year here, he blos
somed to become the leader of the
team.averaging 1 5 points and nearly
eight rebounds for the Cardinal. He
was named a third-team AU-Ameri
can and was taken with the 18th pick
in the 2001 draft by the Houston
Rockets but was immediately trad
ed to New Jersey, where he has spent
his entire career thus far.
Jason, who in the past has not
been awarded much playing time —
averaging about six points and five
rebounds in 25.5 minutes through
out his career — is slotted to be the
starting power forward for the Nets
in the upcoming season.
Josh Childress, guard-forward.

Atlanta Hawks, second NBA Sea
son.
Childress, who stayed on the
Farm for three years before being
drafted sixth overall in 2(X)4, starred
at Stanford by averaging 16 points
and eight rebounds in his final year
for the Cardinal. A highly-touted de
fensive and developing offensive tal
ent. Childress was a starter from his
first game for Stanford and started
nearly half of his games as a rookie
for the Hawks.
After his rookie season, Chil
dress was named to the All-NBA
Rookie second team after averaging
10 points and six rebounds in just
less than 30 minutes per game. Chil
dress also proved to be a perfect
match in the young, talent-laden
roster. Additionally, he is projected
to be the Hawks' starting shooting
guard and will be expected to in
crease his numbers and leadership
as his career moves on.

Samuel Chen is a sophomore who
hopes that inspired by this column,
you will join him in developing these
Stanford hoopsters' fan base back on
the campus that jump-started their ca
reers. E-mail him at samuelc@stan
