						GREAT INDOORS Corkery and Pade double up, Bruch to play single in elite field 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In 2002, senior KC Corkery and
junior James Pade lost in the first
round of the National Indoor Cham
pionships to Texas A&M. But the
pair was able to advance to the semi
finals of the consolation bracket
where it dropped a close 9-8 decision
to the tournament's top seed.
This weekend — three years later
— the Cardinal tandem returns to
the Indoors in Columbus, Ohio with
more experience, still entertaining
the same hopes of bringing home the
doubles title.
In 2002, Corkery and Pade quali
fied for the Indoors by winning the
Regional Championship. This year,
even before the Regional tourna
ment, the duo qualified for the In
doors by advancing to the semifinals
of the Polo Ralph Lauren All-Amer
ican Championships, where they lost
to a team from Middle Tennessee
State.The two Blue Raiders were the
eventual champions and are the top
seed going into this weekend.
Corkery is all too familiar with the
Indoors — the senior played in the
tournament last season with recent
graduate Sam Warburg. The pair ad
vanced to the finals where it lost to a
duo from Ohio State, 8-5. Corkery
plans to make his third trip to the In
doors, while Pade makes only his sec
ond after taking the 2004-2005 sea
son off.
In a draw with 15 other teams,
Corkery and Pade kick off play to
morrow against Georgia's Strahinka
Bobusic and Colin Purcell.The com
petition this weekend is stiff, as the
draws are loaded with top-perform
ers from the All-American team and
winners and finalists from regional
tournaments.
Corkery and Pade have not com
peted in a tournament as a pair since
the All-American, but head coach
John Whitlinger has confidence in
their abilities.
"In an eight game pro-set, crazy

things can happen, and we just have
to play round by round," Whitlinger
said."KC and James have played to
gether so much and know each other
backward and forward. They're
ready to go."
After an impressive run last week
that ended with the Region 8 singles
title, Corkery earned a spot in the
singles draw of the National Indoors.
Corkery, 7-1 this season, is seeded
seventh going into Columbus. Me is
scheduled to face Texas A&M Cor
pus Christi's Raul Morant-Rivas —
the finalist of the South Central re
gional tournament — in the first
round.
While Corkery could potentially
face top-seeded Ryler DeHeart of
Illinois in the quarterfinals,
Whitlinger emphasizes that the play
ers should concentrate on each
match as it comes.
"With a draw this size, the quality
of play and the people who are in it,
you must really have earned your
way into this tournament,"
Whitlinger said. "You better just play
the matches one at a time and not
look past that first round."
In 2(H)4, Corkery lost in the first
round of the Indoors to Duke's
Lodovic Walter 7-6, 7-6; however,
Corkery bounced back to win the
consolation bracket.
"Sometimes when you lose that
first round,you get disappointed, but
it shows me a lot when you can come
back and win or do well in consola
tion," Whitlinger said. "I was really
proud of how KC came through in
that consolation bracket. I hope [the
guys] don't get into [consolation],but
if they do. I hope they handle it the
right way."
Found in the second half of the 32-
player singles draw is Cardinal fresh
man Matt Bruch. Like the
Corkery/Pade pair. Bruch qualified
for the Indoors based on his results at
the AU-American. Iliere, the fresh
man made a stunning run and won
seven matches in the qualifying and
main draws before falling in the
semifinals. Bruch's streak in his colle
giate debut was halted by eventual
Ail-American champion Georgia's
John Isner, who is seeded second in
