## Cardinal unable to make a move, take 13th overall Stanford squad finds consistency; but not strong enough to be competitive 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the men's golf team finally
achieved a level of consistency at the
CordeValle Collegiate Classic yesterday
and on Monday, it wasn't the type of con
sistency the team has been looking for
during the past few weeks. Rather than
another third-round slump, it was overall
mediocre play that doomed the Cardinal

to a 13th-place finish out of 16 teams.
Hie result — a combined score of KB4,
20 over p;ir — was still a disappointment
despite being a slight turnaround from
the team's I7th-p!ace finish last week at
the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational.
"Across the board, we performed pret
ty consistently but having only one under
par score for the tournament across the
board was tough ," coach Conrad Ray
said. "There were a lot more red numbers
and birdies on the board [from other

"I think as the guys continue to play in
more tournaments, we will learn how to
put together three days of solid rounds,"

junior Matt Savage said. "We took care of
the consistency this week, we just need to
shoot lower scores."
The two-day CordeValle began Mon
day at the CordeValle Country Club in
San Martin, Calif. The Cardinal had a
rocky start with a score of 298 in the first
round, 10 over on the par-72 course. Ju
nior Zack Miller and Savage came closest
to an even-par, each finishing just one
stroke over.
The day's second round featured an
improvement of 291 (three over par),
largely thanks to Miller's three under par
69. The Cardinal finished 12th for the day.
"It was encouraging to see that if we

play we can compete with them all," Sav
age said. "We took care of the consistency
this week, we just need to shoot lower
scores."
Yesterday, in the final round, the team
shot a seven over par 295, leaving Stan
ford in 13th place. Only a single stroke
worse than the the second round, the third
round was far from the dramatic downfall
it has been for the Cardinal in recent tour
naments.
"We played OK today," Ray said. "I
think that in all three rounds we had a
pretty good round going and then strug-
