## Cardinal unable to make a move, take 13th overall Stanford squad finds consistency; but not strong enough to be competitive 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although the men's golf team finally
achieved a level of consistency at the
CordeValle Collegiate Classic yesterday
and on Monday, it wasn't the type of con
sistency the team has been looking for
during the past few weeks. Rather than
another third-round slump, it was overall
mediocre play that doomed the Cardinal

to a 13th-place finish out of 16 teams.
Hie result — a combined score of KB4,
20 over p;ir — was still a disappointment
despite being a slight turnaround from
the team's I7th-p!ace finish last week at
the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational.
"Across the board, we performed pret
ty consistently but having only one under
par score for the tournament across the
board was tough ," coach Conrad Ray
said. "There were a lot more red numbers
and birdies on the board [from other
teams] than what we had."
"I think as the guys continue to play in
more tournaments, we will learn how to
put together three days of solid rounds,"

junior Matt Savage said. "We took care of
the consistency this week, we just need to
shoot lower scores."
The two-day CordeValle began Mon
day at the CordeValle Country Club in
San Martin, Calif. The Cardinal had a
rocky start with a score of 298 in the first
round, 10 over on the par-72 course. Ju
nior Zack Miller and Savage came closest
to an even-par, each finishing just one
stroke over.
The day's second round featured an
improvement of 291 (three over par),
largely thanks to Miller's three under par
69. The Cardinal finished 12th for the day.
"It was encouraging to see that if we

play we can compete with them all," Sav
age said. "We took care of the consistency
this week, we just need to shoot lower
scores."
Yesterday, in the final round, the team
shot a seven over par 295, leaving Stan
ford in 13th place. Only a single stroke
worse than the the second round, the third
round was far from the dramatic downfall
it has been for the Cardinal in recent tour
naments.
"We played OK today," Ray said. "I
think that in all three rounds we had a
pretty good round going and then strug-

gled a little bit at the end of the
round. But, all in all, it wasn't horrible
today. I think it showed we just need
to continue to work hard."
The Cardinal have been focusing
the past few weeks on their short
game and putting, and although Ray
saw improvements at the Corde-
Valle, execution continues to be a
problem.
"[What hurt our scores was] just
not executing and making a bogey or
two coming in on the last couple of
holes, instead of maintaining a pretty
solid round," he said.
Miller proved a team leader in the
absence of sophomore Rob Grube,
turning in the one under-par round
for the team. Miller finished tied for
14th individually, with an even-par
216.
"1 was happy about how 1 played
individually," Miller said. "My game
is definitely moving in the right direc
tion, and I'm really excited to play
well come spring time."
Also contributing were Savage,
who tied for 34th, and freshmen
Daniel Lim and Dodge Kemmer,
who tied for 53rd and tied for 58th,
respectively.
"1 think it was good for them [Lim
and Kemmer] to be in the mix and get
some experience," Ray said. "All of
that is going to start to pay off toward
the end of the year."
The Cardinal's end of the year
could depend on the team's Corde-
Valle finish, though, as the Pacific-10
Conference competition at the invi
tational factored into district rank
ings and postseason seedings. Rival
UCLA finished on top (849, 15-
under-par) yesterday, with Cal third,
Arizona sixth and Washington tying
for 11th.
To put itself back into serious con
tention with these teams, Stanford
must continue working hard as well
as execute in the coming events.
"I think the guys feel like they can
perform better than they have in the
past few weeks," Ray said."But at the
same time you have to believe you
belong on the top, and 1 think that's
something we're struggling with a lit
tle bit right now."
The men travel next to the Colle
giate Match Play Championship in
Howey-in-the-llills, Fla., Nov. 11
through 13.There they are scheduled
to face No. 2 Oklahoma State in the
first round.
