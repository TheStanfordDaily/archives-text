## U.S. should focus more on tech, studies show 
### RACHEL ABBEY DAILY KENT STATER 
(U-WIRE) KENT,Ohio â€” Stud
ies suggest the United States needs
to increase its focus on technology
related fields to bolster the country's
economy and national defense.
"They're recognizing the deficit
compared to other countries in the
number of math, science, technology
and engineering degrees," said Patri
cia Myers, director for government
relations. "They're looking at a num
ber of areas to try to address the
shortage because it affects our whole
nation. The federal government is
aware of it. The business leaders are
certainly aware of it."
The U.S. economy has become
one of innovation, rather than
knowledge, Myers said.
"If you look at other countries
such as China and India, they're fo
cusing on math, science, engineering
and technology, and the leaders in
our country are finding out we need
to do the same thing," she said.
The United States must try to cre
ate the most innovative products to
remain competitive in the global
economy, said John West, vice presi
dent for Research and dean of Grad
uate Studies. From improved cell
phones to new polymers, inventions
are based in science and technology.
The tie between higher education
and technology is vital, said James
Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
Lewis wrote "Waiting for Sputnik:
Basic Research and Strategic Com
petition," a report addressing the
country's under-funding of technol
ogy-based fields.
The report argues that even
though there is no situation such as
the Russian launch of Sputnik in the
1950s or the Cold War to rush im
provements of technology, it should
not be ignored.
"Universities produce the bodies
and the ideas that we need to remain
competitive," he said.

The business community is begin
ning to recognize the math and sci
ence fields' importance to the econ
omy, said Garrison Walters, vice
chancellor for Academic Affairs and
Economic Advancements for the
Ohio Board of Regents. However,
the education community has been
concerned for awhile.
"Americans are very competitive
in math and science in the elemen
tary years, but in the middle school
years, students lose interest," Wal
ters said.
The issue first arose in the 1980s,
he said, with a shortage of faculty in
the science and technology fields. It
is difficult to solve because it re
quires teachers, students and parents
who recognize the importance of sci
ence and technology to the economy.
Students need to be exposed to
science and mathematics even while
in middle school, Myers said. Those
years influence the types of courses
students choose to take in high
school, and high school provides the
base for college studies.
Ohio's project Discovery aims to
improve math and science education,
Walters said. One way it does this is
to train middle school-level teachers.
Since Sept. 11. the amount of for
eign students attending U.S. colleges
has declined, causing an even greater
need for U.S. students to fill that void,
Walters said. Also, countries such as
China are trying to keep their own
students and faculty in the country
and strengthen their economy, rather
than sending them overseas.
Many possible programs at the
state and federal levels could en
courage students to enter math, sci
ence, technology and engineering
fields. The Department of Defense
offers a Science, Mathematics and
Research for Transformation, or
SMART, scholarship to students
studying fields such as chemical en
gineering. oceanography and geo
sciences. Currently, Congress is
looking at making this a permanent
offering.
