MUZAFFARABAD. Pakistan
(AP) —The U.S. military resumed
earthquake relief flights in northern
Pakistan on Wednesday, but a
spokesman said helicopters would
stay a "safe distance" from where
one of its choppers allegedly came
under fire while ferrying in supplies.
In an account disputed by Pak
istan's army, the U.S. military re
ported that assailants fired a rock
et-propelled grenade at a U.S. CH
-47 Chinook helicopter on Tuesday
afternoon as it flew over Chakothi,
near the Line of Control that sepa
rates the Pakistani and Indian por
tions of Kashmir.
"The aircraft was not hit and re
turned safely with its crew" to an air
base near the capital, Capt. Rob
Newell, a spokesman for the U.S.
military relief effort, told The Asso
ciated Press.
Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan,
spokesman for the Pakistani army,
said he doubted there had been an

attack, noting that road-clearing
engineers were blasting a road near
where the helicopters were flying.
"The blast was huge enough to
kick up dust which the pilot proba
bly misunderstood as rocket fire,"
he said. He added that Pakistani
army troops searched the area and
spoke to witnesses, none of whom
reported a rocket attack.
Newell said the four American
crew members, a Pakistani pilot and
a freelance journalist on board at
the time were not hurt. Newell said
the U.S. Army and the Pakistani
government were investigating.
Some 24 U.S. military helicop
ters, mostly heavy-lifting Chinooks
diverted from neighboring
Afghanistan, are helping Pakistan
recover from the Oct. 8 quake,
which is believed to have killed
about 8(),(XX) people and left mil
lions homeless and desperately
needing supplies before the harsh
Himalayan winter closes in.
Kashmir — one of two Pakistani
regions hit hardest by the earth
quake — is a focus for Islamic mili

tants seeking to gain independence
from India, or a merger with Pak
istan. While Pakistan denies that mil
itants use its territory as a base, their
presence is apparent. Militants have
been openly helping with quake re
lief effort on both sides of Kashmir.
A spokesman for one prominent
militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammed
— which is alleged to have links to
al-Qaida — said it would not con
template attacking any foreigners,
including Americans, who are help
ing survivors of quake.
"All those foreigners, including
Americans, who are helping our
people in the quake-hit areas are

our honorable guests," the
spokesman, Sahrai Baba, told AP.
"We cannot even think of doing
anything against them."
In a call to a local news agency,
Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed re
sponsibility fora suicide car bomb
ing Wednesday on the outskirts of
Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's main
city, that killed at least four people.
Comm. Nick Balice, another
U.S. military spokesman, said relief
flights had restarted on Wednesday
and that U.S. choppers would stay
"a safe distance from the affected
area" where the reported attack
happened on TUesday.
