## British royalty sweep through the States 
### JILL LAWLESS ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) — Prince Charles and his
wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, spent their
first evening in the United States mingling with
celebrities at a glitzy New York reception — but it
was a tour of ground zero that seemed to affect
them most deeply.
The pair began a weeklong visit designed both
to promote trans-Atlantic ties and to glamorize
the resolutely middle-aged royals with a gala at
the Museum of Modern Art.
Charles told guests who included Sting and
Donald Trump that he was pleased "to celebrate
the long-standing and very special links between
our two countries."
To the delight of the guests, he referred to
Camilla, whom he married in April, as "my darling
wife."
It wasn't exactly the frenzy that welcomed
Charles 20 years ago on a U.S. tour that saw his ra
diant wife, the late Princess Diana, dancing with
John Travolta at a White House dinner. But it was
a start.
The tour moves Wednesday to Washington,
where the royal couple will have an intimate lunch
and a lavish dinner with President and his wife
Laura _ the latter a rare honor from the early-to
bed president.
liie visit to the White House was to begin with
a traditional show of pomp during a midday South
Lawn arrival ceremony.

Afterward, the royal couple was being treated
to lunch in the Bush's residential quarters, sitting
down in the Family Dining Room with about a
dozen guests, including both countries' ambassa
dors, said Susan Whitson, the spokeswoman for
first lady Laura Bush.
After a tour of an innovative, inner-city
boarding school, the real festivities were left for
the evening, when the president was acquiescing
to the kind of late-night, black-tie affair he typi
cally shuns.
About 130 people were expected to dinner in
the State Dining Room on the White House's
grand main floor. 'ITiere have been only five for

mal White House dinners honoring world leaders
in Bush's presidency.
Other than to say that "seasonal" food was
being served, the menus and the guest list — as
well as Mrs. Bush's attire — were remaining close
ly guarded secrets, Whitson said.
The Bush White House is not known for its love
of glitter and celebrity, so the guests were to fea
ture names from Washington's A-list but few from
Hollywood.
The prince and the president disagree on is
sues such as global warming, so the White House
took care to characterize the visit as primarily a
social one.
