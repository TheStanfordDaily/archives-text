## Lecturers try using podcasting 
### SEAN POWERS THE MANEATER 
(U-WIRE) COLUMBIA, Mo. â€” Educators across
the country are considering a new form of Internet
based audio sharing called "podcasting" to enhance
lectures.
Podcasting allows teachers to audio-record lectures
and put them online for students to download and lis
ten to on computers or portable media devices such as
iPods.
"Technology is becoming an integral part of every
one's life," said Monica Beglau, director of Enhancing
Missouri's Instructional Network Teaching S t r at e -
gies, a state-run technology program for K-12 students.
"There are so many different features that technology
offers, and it's all so motivational and so interactive."
MU students and faculty helped test out podcasting
at the National Learning Infrastructure Initiative con
ferences in New Orleans in January and Houston in
March, according to the Information and Access Tech
nology Services' Web site.
Likewise, the MU School of Journalism has looked
at using podcasting for the school's reporting classes.
A major misconception regarding podcasting is
that in order to successfully receive these audio files,
users need an iPod. said Robert Walch, president and
owner of Pod Cast 411, a Kansas-based podcasting
company.
"You don't need an iPod to listen to a podcast, and
you definitely don't need it to create a podcast," Walch
said. "You just need the software."
Options include using an MP3 player to record audio
files and Windows Media Player for listening to pod
casts on computers.
Walch said many universities are considering ways
to incorporate podcasts into the classroom. Even

though various colleges and universities across the
country have considered podcasting, Walch said this
concept is not overwhelmingly popular among col
lege students due to a lack of marketing toward that
age group.
"I've seen many more teenagers podcasting or lis
tening to podcasts," Walch said. "It's almost as if pod
casting is skipping over the entire college generation.
It's very popular for people who are 25 to 40, and it's
really popular for people 12 to 18."
Critics of podcasting in the classroom fear some
students will abuse this technological opportunity.
"Kids might feel that they can just slack off even
more, meaning they can just record their notes," fresh
man Mike Brannen said. "There's just less effort put
into the classes because they know that they don't have
to go in and take notes."
Sophomore Kourtney Mitchell said he would sup
port the use of podcasting in the classroom and said it
would be a useful tool for students, especially incoming
freshmen who still are adapting to the university
lifestyle.
"I think it's really good because the students can
not only reinforce writing the notes, but they can also
pick up other little things that they may have missed
when the teacher was talking," Mitchell said.
Walch said podcasting would not negatively affect
students who are serious about learning.
"A certain percentage of students are not going to
pay attention anyway, and the ones that really want to
learn are going to learn," Walch said.
Beglau said podcasting gives students an opportunity
to use their audio sharing for studying.
"I think it'll help people be more collaborative and
solve problems in groups," she said. "Those are the
things that employers are really looking for beyond
your knowledge and understanding of content."
