## Racquetball Club laments lack of courts Original Arrillaga Center plans would have included courts 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Stanford community, including
the Stanford Racquetball Club, are incensed over
the absence of racquetball courts at the new Arril
laga Center for Sports and Recreation.
As reported in the Daily in March 2005 and on
Stanford's Department of Capital Planning Web
site, racquetball courts were featured in the build
ing's original plans. However, in the course of the
Recreation Center's development, the plans for
the courts were dismissed and additional squash
courts were built instead.
According to Will Anderson, vice president of
the racquetball club, many of the club's initiatives
and recruiting efforts hinged on the availability of
free on-campus racquetball courts. Without them,
the club must now practice at an expensive off
campus facility.
"[The lack of racquetball courts at Arrillaga]
was very disappointing because during the past
year the club has been generating a lot of interest
from students and staff," Anderson said. "It was a
bit of a momentum killer for the club. While the
team had great interest after the club fair, training
off-campus pretty much wipes out any recreation
al players, limits recruitment and inhibits the po
tential for PE classes."
Anderson added that the University has re
stricted use of the DeGuerre racquetball courts lo
cated by the Taube Tennis Center, further limiting
court access on campus.
Racquetball Club President David Medina, a
sophomore, said the lack of on-campus racquet
ball courts has severely reduced racquetball prac
tice time not only for the team, but also for casual
racquetball players.
" The lack of courts has been truly devastating."
he said. "We recorded an average of over 80 peo
ple using the courts weekly, and because we no
longer have courts on campus, that number has
dropped to about 12 at the most."
Medina also stressed that due to the fees of off
campus facilities. Racquetball Club dues have sky
rocketed.
"We went from a large but loosely run group
with club dues of nothing, to a tightly packed de
voted club with club dues of over $150 a quarter,"
he said. "This change has been both good and bad.
We were forced to become a more organized club,
but we lost what the sport needs most â€” players."
"Currently, the biggest restriction is cost," An
derson added. "We were able to negotiate a little
bit of a deal from the club where we train, but that
