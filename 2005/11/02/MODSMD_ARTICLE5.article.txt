## Senate tackles transportation ASSU Senate updated on new Commencement possibilities 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Senate discussed transportation issues,
the aesthetics of Tresidder Union, the current status of
the Commencement location and student group funding
issues at last night's weekly meeting.
Encouraging undergraduates to utilize CalTVain and
bringing back the "movie express" were among the
items discussed at the parking and transportation meet
ing last Friday. The now discontinued movie shuttle
would transport students to the AMC Mercado theatre.
At the parking and transportation meeting, they dis
cussed implementing a parking pass valid in both East
and West campus without restrictions. The committee is
also looking into creating more bike racks around cam
pus.
ASSU President Melanie Kannokada, a senior, up
dated the Senate on the status of the Commencement
location. Seniors and their parents are invited to vote on
their preferred site in a poll conducted by University
President John Hennessy. The options are Frost Am
phitheater (the initial selection), the practice football
field and Roble Field.
Senator Vang Kou Khang, a sophomore, reported
that modifications are being considered for TYesidder

Union, including changing its color, tiles and table
arrangement. There was also talk of a possible bowling
alley and student game room. These are all "simple
things that would make the place more welcoming,"
Khang said.
Businesses participating in the "Student Saver" pro
gram, which gives Stanford students discounts, may re
ceive new and more visible window stickers to mark
their participation because the current ones are "practi
cally invisible," according to Senate Chair Chris
Nguyen, a junior.
The Senate also reviewed the close of registration for
student groups that took place Monday. The University
currently has 418 approved student groups, a figure that
is "more than we've ever seen at this time of year," ac
cording to Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe.
The governing body also voted to allocate funds to
some existing student groups, including Habitat for Hu
manity and the Student Campaign for Child Survival.
They discussed contributing to Big Game Weekend by
passing out rally towels to a portion of ticket holders.
The Senate also approved the transfer of $9 in the
budget of the Carribean Student Association from the
funds designated for renting facilities to meet the need
for photocopies.
"I'm pretty sure this $9 is going to a very germane
cause," said Senate Appropriations Chair Faris Mohiud
din, a junior.
Additionally, at last Friday's
Parking and Transportation meet
ing, committee members discussed
encouraging undergraduates to uti
lize CalTrain and bringing back the
"Movie Express." The now-discon
tinued movie shuttle used to trans
port students to the AMC Mercado
theater in Santa Clara.
Senators also discussed imple
menting a parking pass valid on
both East and West campus without
restrictions, and the committee is
also looking into providing more
bike racks around campus.
