## 'Chicken Little' a tad racy for young audience 
### SANDY COHEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A shotgun-wielding
hunter mercilessly pursues his target. Angry space
aliens vaporize a defenseless town. A bloodthirsty
shark preys on the weak and tiny.
These movie scenes aren't from the latest ac
tion thrillers — they're from G-rated animated
films like Disney's new "Chicken Little."
As pop culture mimics today's permissive so
cial values, violence and veiled sexual references
have crept into the seemingly innocent cartoon
landscape, giving parents new reason to do re
search beyond the ratings.
It's not that the Motion Picture Association of

America's ratings board has become more permis
sive, said MPAA president Dan Glickman: "It's
bound to be a reflection of society."
It's also a reflection of movie studios following
the formula of hits like the "Toy Story" and
"Shrek" films, whose sophisticated scripts include
plenty of subtle jokes aimed at adults.
So the octopus-armed alien robots in "Chicken
Little," who shred a cornfield and use their laser
gaze to zap away the town's animal citizens, are
just typical cartoon characters. The film's allusion
to "Girls Gone Wild" is just another cultural refer
ence. The melons held chest-high by the heroine in
"Wallace & Gromit" are just large pieces of fruit.
"Everybody is trying to reach out to as wide an
audience as possible," said Disney spokesman

Dennis Rice. "It may have some adult humor that
goes over the heads of other audiences, but it's
never so colorful that it would affect the MPAA
and how (hey rate the movie."
Historically, cartoons have always contained
some strong elements. Bambi's mother is shot and
killed in the 1942 Disney classic, and Daffy Duck
took many a shotgun blast from Elmer Fudd. But
as animation techniques become more sophisti
cated and cartoons speak to audiences of all ages,
the animated world looks more like reality, said
Elayne Rapping, professor of film history and the
ory at the University of Buffalo.
"We become increasingly desensitized, so
movies have to be more and more viscerally excit
ing." she said.

Movie critics claim that the sexual and violent references included in Disney's newest release are only a reflection of contemporary society.
