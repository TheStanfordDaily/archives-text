ZANZIBAR.Tanzania (AP) â€”
Police backed by soldiers surround
ed opposition party offices on Tues
day and clashed with protesters in
opposition strongholds following
disputed weekend elections.
Two boats full of troops left Tan
zania's commercial capital of Dares
Salaam to reinforce military pres
ence in this semiautonomous Indi
an Ocean archipelago.
Zanzibar's main city of Stone
Town echoed with the sounds of ex
ploding tear gas canisters Tiiesday
as opposition supporters engaged
police in running battles down the
narrow 17th century alleyways. In
one neighborhood. Associated
Press reporters watched as police
used water canons against opposi
tion supporters.
Officers sealed off roads to op
position strongholds and at least 12
people were taken to hospital by
Red Cross and Red Crescent
workers. Shops remained closed
fora third day because of the vio
lence.
The clashes came as the main op
position party. Civic United Front,
claimed its leader, Seif Sharif
Hamad, had won 51 percent of the
presidential vote.
"I am now declaring victory in
the presidential election," Hamad
said, threatening to call for mass ac
tion if electoral
officials declare the incumbent,
Amani Abeid Karume, the winner.
Electoral and ruling party offi
cials could not immediately be
reached for comment on the oppo
sition victory claim.
But state-run radio said the rul
ing Chama Cha Mapinduzi,or Rev

olutionary Party, had trounced the
opposition in legislative elections,
winning 27 seats compared with 19
for Civic United Front.
Police surrounded the head
quarters of the Civic United Front
and ordered thousands of opposi
tion supporters gathered there to
disperse. But the crowd continued
to swell with young men singing de
fiant party songs, forcing the offi
cers to pull back.
On the second island of Pemba.
witnesses said police were beating
up opposition supporters at their
party's headquarters. The witnesses
declined to be identified because of
fears of retribution.
Sunday's balloting, following a
campaign marked by violence and
recrimination, saw voters on the
"spice islands" choose between so
cialists who have ruled for more
than 30 years and an opposition
promising privatization and whole
sale economic reform.
On Monday, Hamad told re
porters that more than 80,(MX) oppo
sition supporters had been denied
the right to vote through manipula
tion of the voter's register. He
called fora meeting with the ruling
party and election officials.
Elections in 1995 and 2000
were marred by violence and
fraud. Opposition protests over
alleged fraud killed dozens in the
wake of the 2000 elections. Islam
ic radicals could find an opening
in this devoutly Muslim region if
Sunday's vote is seen as flawed
and proof that democracy cannot
work here.
Elections also had been sched
uled for Sunday on mainland Tan
zania, but were postponed to Dec.
18 because of the death of one of
vice presidential candidates.
