# Database to help stem voter fraud
## California first to comply with federal act from 2002 
### DON THOMPSON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — California has agreed to
create a computerized statewide voter list to guard
against fraud in future elections, beating a January
deadline set by federal law.
The new database will be in use for the June 2006 pri
mary election, under the settlement announced yester
day by the secretary of state and U.S. Department of
Justice.
The agreement requires California to create tempo
rary and permanent databases designed to catch ineligi
ble voters.
The two-step plan requires the state to combine
county voter registration lists into the state's existing
CalVoter database. That database was created a decade
ago to spot ineligible voters or voters who had regis
tered more than once.
County election officials will cross-check their voter
lists with death and felony records kept by the state and
federal governments and update the state's master list
daily.
The initial database eventually will be replaced by a
centralized, interactive database called "VoteCal,"
which can keep track of voters who die or become inel
igible because they are convicted of felonies.
California is the first to reach a settlement with the
federal government on meeting the January deadline
set by the 2002 Help America Vote Act. Part of the law
requires each state to create a registration system de
signed to ensure that only those who are eligible actu
ally vote.
Accusations of voter fraud have not been a signifi
cant issue in past California elections.The new database
will ensure that only those who are eligible to vote cast
ballots. Secretary of State Bruce McPherson said.
The database "will go a long way to ensure the in
tegrity of our voting process," he said.
Justice Department official Bradley J. Schlozman, an
acting assistant attorney general, noted the"the new
leadership in the California secretary of state's office
for working cooperatively with us." a reference to prob
lems under former Secretary of State Kevin Shelley.
