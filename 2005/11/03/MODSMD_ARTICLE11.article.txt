## Wanna punch your problem set? Punch a ballot instead 
### 
This is a pivotal week for health care
in California. The Nov. 8 ballot in
cludes three separate measures that
will have lasting effects on women's
health and prescription drug costs in the
Golden State.
Although 1 have been exercising my
right to vote for the last four years, this is
the first election in which I am truly con
cerned with the outcome. This election is
very personal and very real for me. As a
Californian, a young woman and an aspir
ing physician, I have a lot at stake in this
ballot. Even if you don't plan to stay in
California after Stanford, aren't female or
are not planning a career in health care,
you too have a lot to lose. In light of the
upcoming elections, I see no better topic
to tackle than Props 73,78 and 79 for this
week's health column.
Proposition 73 would change the Cal
ifornia Constitution by prohibiting abor
tions for minors without parental ap
proval. The prop would require parental
notification before a girl under 18 can get
an abortion and \ftould impose monetary
penalties on physicians who violate the
law. It also mandates reporting require
ments and has a fiscal impact of millions
of dollars for added court and administra
tive costs.
The main argument in favor of Prop.
73 is that it will "restore Californians'
right to counsel and care for their daugh
ters before — and after — an abortion"
(quoted from the Official Voter Guide).
The con argument has several flavors:
1) teenagers who can't talk to their par
ents and can't receive an abortion may re
sort to unsafe, illegal abortions, and 2) the
government can't mandate family com
munication with a stupid proposition.
At the ripe age of 22,1 am fortunately
neither a teenager worried about getting
pregnant nor am I yet a concerned parent. I
couldn't be further from either extreme. But
I was a teenager not too long ago and I re
member damn well what it was like to be
pressured by peers and parents to do all
sorts of things — from having sex to work
ing hard in school so I could get into Stan
ford.
We all know that teenagers are con
fused and full of angst, that they some
times make poor decisions and that they
often don't reveal information to their
parents. They do a lot of things that
they're not supposed to do and seeking
illegal abortions is not outside the realm
of possibility.
It is true that abortion itself is not a
positive thing. No one from either side
of the political spectrum claims that is it
— but the alternative to legally provid
ing scared, desperate minors with the
option to have a safe abortion is truly
frightening.
In contrast to Prop. 73, Propositions 78
and 79 come with less moral conviction
and more conspiracy theories. And they
are quite confusing, particularly in the Of
ficial Voter Guide write-ups. Essentially,
both proposals would provide drug dis
counts to uninsured Californians, and nei
ther specifies which drugs would be dis
counted nor indicates by how much. In
both cases, the state would work out deals
with drug companies on behalf of under
served citizens.
The main difference between the two
is that Prop. 78 is backed by the pharma
ceutical industry itself, while labor,
health and consumer groups are backing
Prop. 79. Thus, Prop. 78 makes the dis
counts "voluntary" for drug companies,
while Prop. 79 threatens to cut the drug
companies off from MediCal (the state's
$4 billion medical insurance program) if
they do not participate in the discounts.
Advocates of Prop. 79 claim that it will
reach more people and offer greater dis
counts, while 78 promoters say it is less
bureaucratic.
At this point any good skeptic is ask
ing: What happens if both measures pass?
Then the one with more total votes will
become law.
This column is obviously only one
opinion (a progressive one) on several
complex health issues. You have until
Tuesday to do your own research and
form your own opinion, so take a short
break from problem sets and papers to
play a role in the political process. If you
don't vote, you really don't have the right
to bitch about life, and I will also lose all
respect for you.

Confused about Props. 78 and 79? Want to
discuss politics? How about abortion or
the San Diego mayors race!? Email
