## Watch Some ER Doctor and television producer says hospital dramas on tube can provide mini crash courses on health issues 
### Silvia Sanchez 
Can medically-based television shows
really inform the public about health issues?
Neal Baer. the executive producer of "Law
and Order: Special Victims Unit" and the
former executive producer of "ER." seems
to think so.
Baer, who is also a graduate of Harvard
Medical School, gave the annual Jonathan
King lecture at the Stanford Medical Center
last Wednesday to show how doctors can ed
ucate the public by telling their patients' sto
ries. King, who received a doctoral degree in
computer science from Stanford, became an
advocate for strong doctor-patient relation
ships during his struggle with cancer in 19N9,
according to the Stanford News Service. He
started the lecture series before his death in
1991 to help share his beliefs with the cam
pus community.
Because he believes television can be a
force for social good. Baer says that he
chooses plotlines for certain episodes from
his own personal experiences with patients
and their families. When he was a writer for
the television show "ER." Baer would also
include current health-related issues as well
as current events in his storylines because
he thought the information would benefit
the public.
"Healing and storytelling are inter

twined," Baer said to a mostly academic au
dience. "Telling a patient s story is an art and
takes a lot of practice. The best doctors are
excellent storytellers because they must
provide the essentials of a patient's story
and make it dramatic. The best doctors lis
ten carefully and ask hidden questions that
provide insight. Patients will withhold perti
nent facts from their doctors if they don't
trust them."
Audience member and former School of
Medicine staff member Phyllis Mayberg
says she agrees that doctors should maintain
good relationships with their patients. She
explains that she has attended several of the
Jonathan King lectures because her mother
died two years ago and her doctor knew
more about her than Mayberg ever did. "In
fact, he still calls me and tells me how much
he misses her," Mayberg says.
In the lecture. Baer asserted that there is
a "growing gap" in knowledge between the
general public, the scientific and academic
community and the policymakers when it
comes to medical issues. He said he wants
to better inform the public through a pop
ular medium so that discussion about the
issues will occur to create "a pluralistic so
ciety."
Junior Laura Rodriguez and sophomore
Kelsey Finch say they think shows like "Law
and Order" are made mainly for entertain
ment value.

Sophomore Alexandrah Govere — an
avid "Law and Order: SVU" watcher —
says she agrees and does not think she has
learned very much from these types of
shows. However, she adds that if an inform
ative show is made with entertainment pur
poses in mind, it will more likely reach a
larger and more diverse audience.
"If you put hidden messages into these
shows, then it is more likely that people will
see and listen to them," Govere says.
Mayberg says she thinks that it would be
"a good idea" to open lectures like the one
Baer gave to people beyond the academic
community. Like Govere. she adds that the
public might be more receptive to the mes
sages in television programs if they are first
given the idea that these shows were made
to educate as well as to entertain.
Whether or not television-watchers are
aware that they have learned something
from medicine-oriented shows, Baer says
he is confident that they have, citing re
search he conducted with the Mcnlo Park
based Kaiser Family Foundation in 2002.
The study used pre-show and post-show
surveys to measure knowledge gain and re
tention.
Researchers first showed clips from the
television show "ER" to subjects. Next, they
asked them questions about the topics cov
ered during the show, ranging from cervical
cancer to birth control. Subjects showed an

overall increase in knowledge about the
medical topics discussed in the clips. In an in
terview with the Stanford Report. Baer ex
plains in greater detail the results of the
study.
"We asked people what they knew
about HPV-human papillomavirus and its
association with cervical cancer before and
after an episode about the subject," he says.
" Before the show aired, 24 percent of view
ers had heard of HPV. After the show
aired, 48 percent had heard of the Virus. Be
fore the show aired. 9 percent could give a
correct description of HPV; after the show
aired, 28 percent could."
The experiment showed Baer that peo
ple do remember and can retain informa
tion from television shows — especially
from fast-paced dramas like "ER."
Baer says the results of the study make
him hopeful that his stories are indeed help
ing people.
"One-seventh of the people who
watched 'ER' called their doctor about
something they'd seen and one-quarter of
people told other people about what they'd
seen." Baer said in his lecture. "We want to
be accurate, so we strive to be as accurate as
possible. People get health information
from television and if they're going to, it's
incumbent on us to put the issues out there
so that we can do public storytelling and
teach people."

excellent storytellers because they must
provide the essentials of a patient's story
and make it dramatic. The best doctors lis
ten carefully and ask hidden questions that
provide insight. Patients will withhold perti
nent facts from their doctors if they don't
trust them."
Audience member and former School of
Medicine staff member Phyllis Mayberg
says she agrees that doctors should maintain
good relationships with their patients. She
explains that she has attended several of the
Jonathan King lectures because her mother
died two years ago and her doctor knew
more about her than Mayberg ever did. "In
fact, he still calls me and tells me how much
he misses her," Mayberg says.
In the lecture. Baer asserted that there is
a "growing gap" in knowledge between the
general public, the scientific and academic
community and the policymakers when it
comes to medical issues. He said he wants
to better inform the public through a pop
ular medium so that discussion about the
issues will occur to create "a pluralistic so
ciety."
Junior Laura Rodriguez and sophomore
Kelsey Finch say they think shows like "Law
and Order" are made mainly for entertain
ment value.

Sophomore Alexandrah Govere — an
avid "Law and Order: SVU" watcher —
says she agrees and does not think she has
learned very much from these types of
shows. However, she adds that if an inform
ative show is made with entertainment pur
poses in mind, it will more likely reach a
larger and more diverse audience.
"If you put hidden messages into these
shows, then it is more likely that people will
see and listen to them," Govere says.
Mayberg says she thinks that it would be
"a good idea" to open lectures like the one
Baer gave to people beyond the academic
community. Like Govere. she adds that the
public might be more receptive to the mes
sages in television programs if they are first
given the idea that these shows were made
to educate as well as to entertain.
Whether or not television-watchers are
aware that they have learned something
from medicine-oriented shows, Baer says
he is confident that they have, citing re
search he conducted with the Mcnlo Park
based Kaiser Family Foundation in 2002.
The study used pre-show and post-show
surveys to measure knowledge gain and re
tention.
Researchers first showed clips from the
television show "ER" to subjects. Next, they
asked them questions about the topics cov
ered during the show, ranging from cervical
cancer to birth control. Subjects showed an

overall increase in knowledge about the
medical topics discussed in the clips. In an in
terview with the Stanford Report. Baer ex
plains in greater detail the results of the
study.
"We asked people what they knew
about HPV-human papillomavirus and its
association with cervical cancer before and
after an episode about the subject," he says.
" Before the show aired, 24 percent of view
ers had heard of HPV. After the show
aired, 48 percent had heard of the Virus. Be
fore the show aired. 9 percent could give a
correct description of HPV; after the show
aired, 28 percent could."
The experiment showed Baer that peo
ple do remember and can retain informa
tion from television shows — especially
from fast-paced dramas like "ER."
Baer says the results of the study make
him hopeful that his stories are indeed help
ing people.
"One-seventh of the people who
watched 'ER' called their doctor about
something they'd seen and one-quarter of
people told other people about what they'd
seen." Baer said in his lecture. "We want to
be accurate, so we strive to be as accurate as
possible. People get health information
from television and if they're going to, it's
incumbent on us to put the issues out there
so that we can do public storytelling and
teach people."

Can medically-based television shows
really inform the public about health issues?
Neal Baer. the executive producer of "Law
and Order: Special Victims Unit" and the
former executive producer of "ER." seems
to think so.
Baer, who is also a graduate of Harvard
Medical School, gave the annual Jonathan
King lecture at the Stanford Medical Center
last Wednesday to show how doctors can ed
ucate the public by telling their patients' sto
ries. King, who received a doctoral degree in
computer science from Stanford, became an
advocate for strong doctor-patient relation
ships during his struggle with cancer in 19N9,
according to the Stanford News Service. He
started the lecture series before his death in
1991 to help share his beliefs with the cam
pus community.
Because he believes television can be a
force for social good. Baer says that he
chooses plotlines for certain episodes from
his own personal experiences with patients
and their families. When he was a writer for
the television show "ER." Baer would also
include current health-related issues as well
as current events in his storylines because
he thought the information would benefit
the public.
"Healing and storytelling are inter

twined," Baer said to a mostly academic au
dience. "Telling a patient s story is an art and
takes a lot of practice. The best doctors are
excellent storytellers because they must
provide the essentials of a patient's story
and make it dramatic. The best doctors lis
