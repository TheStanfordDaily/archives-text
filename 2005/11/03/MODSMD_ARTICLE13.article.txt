## Editorial Union political dues should not be the default 
### 
Proposition 75, the so called "Paycheck
Protection Plan." is shrouded in confu
sion. It prohibits using public employee
union dues for political contributions with
out individual employees' prior consent.
Unions claim it will cripple their ability to act
collectively, while supporters claim it will
merely protect the rights of union members.
The truth appears to lie somewhere in be
tween. On balance, we believe that protect
ing the rights of workers is more important
than the potential harm suffered by unions
as a result. Consequently, we urge a yes vote
on Prop. 75.
Prop. 75 is not as radical as unions sug
gest. It only affects public-sector unions and
does not involve dues earmarked for collec
tive bargaining. In terms of political contri
butions, it merely changes an opt-out system
into an opt-in system. Instead of union mem
bers asking to waive political campaign dues,
unions will have to ask for each members'
permission before collecting such dues.
Money spent on general lobbying is unaf
fected. Such a change does not seem overly
onerous.
Admittedly, such a change could have
major ramifications. After a similar measure
passed in Washington state, the number of
contributors to the Washington Education
Association's PAC fell from 48,000 to 7.0(H).
However, Washington still has a Democ
ratic governor, two Democratic senators and
six Democratic representatives. So if you op
pose Prop. 75 because you fear it will cripple
California Democrats, we urge you to recon
sider. As seen in Washington. Prop. 75 would
not endanger the two-party system. With
California Democrats near to a super-major
ity, they certainly are not in danger of disap
pearing. Ihe passage of Prop. 75 might make
Democrats less beholden to public-sector
unions, but that might be a good thing.
There's good reason to single out public
sector union participation in California poli
tics. When a public-sector union elects a
politician, it is electing its own boss. Accord
ingly, there is a legitimate fear that unions
are negotiating on both sides of the table.
For instance, California's second-largest
PAC is operated by the prison guard union.
Does the union have a legitimate stake in
supporting the three-strikes law and victim
rights bills? Or is it merely working to ensure
more jobs and job security for its workers?
According to a Supreme Court ruling,
union members have a right not to con
tribute to their union's political campaigns.

WHAT IT IS: Requires public-sector
unions to adopt opt-in systems

important Democratic political

Ihe Christian Science Monitor has reported
that 90 percent of California union dona
tions go to Democrats, but that 40 percent of
union members are Republicans. While this
is only one study, the numbers are disparate
enough to legitimately raise concern regard
ing a possible disconnect between union do
nations and member interests.
It is all too easy to see how public-sector
unions can trick their members into giving to
political campaigns. A worker might not be
informed of his right to waive political dues.
Since dues are deducted straight from the
worker's paycheck, he might not even be
aware that he is paying political dues. Often,
if you refuse to pay such dues, you lose your

union vote. Finally, if you're new to a
job, would you really risk angering
your union by refusing to give to its
pet political campaign?
Ihe California Teacher's Associ
ation is a depressing example. It has
spent millions on issues, such assay
ing former Governor Gray Davis,
far removed from the needs of
teachers. To pay off interest on a $34
million debt, it imposed a special
$180 fee — without a general vote.
Now there's a class-action lawsuit
forcing it to inform its members that
they can refuse to pay that fee.
Somehow, we doubt that the union
is representing its membership well.
We are wary of interfering with
the internal workings of unions, but
feel that public-sector unions are a
separate category. Government em
ployees are by default expected to
join public-sector unions. Even if an
employee leaves a union, his con
tract is still negotiated by the union,
and he still must pay most union
dues. Giving public-sector unions a
monopoly on representation also
gives the state a right to regulate
those unions.
Prop. 75 does not hinder the
union's primary purpose: collective
bargaining. On the other hand, by
forcing unions to denote how they
use dues, Prop. 75 adds needed
transparency and accountability
into the union system. Maybe these
extra protections are not needed,
but we feel that — in the long term
— transparency can never hurt.
