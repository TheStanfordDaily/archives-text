## Editorial Union political dues should not be the default 
### 
Proposition 75, the so called "Paycheck
Protection Plan." is shrouded in confu
sion. It prohibits using public employee
union dues for political contributions with
out individual employees' prior consent.
Unions claim it will cripple their ability to act
collectively, while supporters claim it will
merely protect the rights of union members.
The truth appears to lie somewhere in be
tween. On balance, we believe that protect
ing the rights of workers is more important
than the potential harm suffered by unions
as a result. Consequently, we urge a yes vote
on Prop. 75.
Prop. 75 is not as radical as unions sug
gest. It only affects public-sector unions and
does not involve dues earmarked for collec
tive bargaining. In terms of political contri
butions, it merely changes an opt-out system
into an opt-in system. Instead of union mem
bers asking to waive political campaign dues,
unions will have to ask for each members'
permission before collecting such dues.
Money spent on general lobbying is unaf
fected. Such a change does not seem overly
onerous.
Admittedly, such a change could have
major ramifications. After a similar measure
passed in Washington state, the number of
contributors to the Washington Education
Association's PAC fell from 48,000 to 7.0(H).
However, Washington still has a Democ
ratic governor, two Democratic senators and
six Democratic representatives. So if you op
pose Prop. 75 because you fear it will cripple
California Democrats, we urge you to recon
sider. As seen in Washington. Prop. 75 would
not endanger the two-party system. With
California Democrats near to a super-major
ity, they certainly are not in danger of disap
pearing. Ihe passage of Prop. 75 might make
Democrats less beholden to public-sector
unions, but that might be a good thing.
There's good reason to single out public
sector union participation in California poli
tics. When a public-sector union elects a
politician, it is electing its own boss. Accord
ingly, there is a legitimate fear that unions
are negotiating on both sides of the table.
For instance, California's second-largest
PAC is operated by the prison guard union.
Does the union have a legitimate stake in
supporting the three-strikes law and victim
rights bills? Or is it merely working to ensure
more jobs and job security for its workers?
According to a Supreme Court ruling,
union members have a right not to con
tribute to their union's political campaigns.

Union Dues

WHAT IT IS: Requires public-sector
unions to adopt opt-in systems

bargaining ability.

Creates greater accountability
and transparency for unions.

Ihe Christian Science Monitor has reported
that 90 percent of California union dona
tions go to Democrats, but that 40 percent of
union members are Republicans. While this
is only one study, the numbers are disparate
enough to legitimately raise concern regard
ing a possible disconnect between union do
nations and member interests.
It is all too easy to see how public-sector
unions can trick their members into giving to
political campaigns. A worker might not be
informed of his right to waive political dues.
Since dues are deducted straight from the
worker's paycheck, he might not even be
aware that he is paying political dues. Often,
if you refuse to pay such dues, you lose your
