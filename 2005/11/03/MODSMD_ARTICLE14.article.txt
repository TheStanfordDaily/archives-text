Article misrepresented professor's
views on affirmative action
Tuesday's article on Prof. Lani Guinier's
Presidential Lecture on "Wealth. Race and
Merit in Higher Education" ("Action or
merit," Nov. 1) did a good job of reiterating
some of the key quotes and statistics men
tioned in the lecture, but I feel it misrepre
sented a key aspect of Guinier's message.
Guinier did not "make the case for affir
mative action," but rather, identified these
policies as not being radical enough, and ar
gued that it would be more effective to ad
dress the central and far-reaching philo
sophical flaws at the foundation of college
and university admissions policy — namely,
institutions' lack of a sense of public respon
sibility and the admissions process' over-re
liance on standardized test scores that corre
late more with a student's family's wealth
than with that student's subsequent college
grades.
In the first sentence of the article,
Guinier's lecture is inaccurately described as
an "impassioned defense of affirmative ac
tion."The extent to which the author misun
dersUxxl Guinier's argument is made clear
in his attempt to explain her "canary in the
mine" metaphor. While he quotes her as say
ing "It's time to give the canary a gas mask or
a pint-sized respirator," she in fact argued
that the canary has already been given these
things — in the form of current affirmative
action measures — and that, while they're
better than nothing, they're not enough.
Guinier 's talk was much more radical than
a defense of affirmative action. She argued

that the canary and the miners alike would
be much better served if one worked to fix
the toxic atmosphere in which they work —
or. in the case of college admissions, to fix the
flawed conceptualization of a university's
responsibility and the irresponsible linking
of wealth and merit.
Guinier did not argue for "racial and eco
nomic affirmative action as effective strate
gies to compensate for fundamental flaws in
the system." Rather, she argued that these
attempts to save the canary — i.e., poor and
minority students — are not addressing, or
even acknowledging, the deeper problem.
While the most marginalized segments of so
ciety serve as the canary — their experi
ences illustrating the most obvious examples
of inequality in higher education — every
one eventually will be infected and affected
if the philosophical foundation of higher ed
ucation and merit is not rigorously analyzed
and reformed. I"he canary may be choking
now. but the miners will be choking later if
something of substance is not done.
I was inspired and intrigued by the fresh
and original substance of Guinier's lecture.
1 lowever, I'm afraid that after reading Tues
day's article, those who had not been able to
attend the talk might think it had been a
mere rehashing of pro-affirmative action ar
guments, when it in fact called for something
much greater.
