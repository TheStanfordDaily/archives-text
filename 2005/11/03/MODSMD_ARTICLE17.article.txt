# The
						saving grace of memories
## 
### 
I often wonder to myself what I will think
of right before I die. What memory will
sanctify that moment? What thoughts will
tickle my weary mind? What regrets will
plague me before I exhale for the last time?
These questions gnaw at my soul, yet any at
tempt to answer them is doomed to fail.
I deeply respect memories. Even though
time moves forward and changes things, 1
feel that a part of me is locked inside the past
— within memories, immutable and frozen.
When my hard drive was on the verge of los
ing all data, and 1 only had one CD for back
up, I chose to save my e-mails. These were
perhaps the best materialization of many
tender, elusive memories. So long to all the
music, let me hold onto the words.
Many people do not necessarily enjoy e
mail communication. They only engage in it
because they have to. I, on the other hand,
venerate e-mail. I often wish others could
also appreciate the dignity of e-mail. Last
summer, I remember spending entire days
just replying to e-mails from friends and pro
fessors, authors and Web site maintainers. I
was no longer an angst-filled youth in Istan
bul. I was imprisoned between sentences.
Maybe somewhere between the capital letter
and the period of a sentence, 1 could fit in. No,
no, I could not. I was an open novel that oth
ers and I collectively wrote. What sort of
novel was I? Who was my protagonist? I kept
searching restlessly.
"Happiness and worth of being a human!
What arbitrariness!" I wrote back when I was
told that, even though there was no natural or

supernatural meaning of life, these two qual
ities would suffice.
After getting my contact lenses, I wrote,
"Hey, who made the world look better? It
feels as if the world has been artificially beau
tified, clarified and in the process made sur
real." The stream of words, the exchange, did
not seem to end.
When I occasionally went out to meet
friends (flesh-and-blood ones, not e-mail
ones), there would be traffic jams in Ortakoy,
Istanbul. (Ortakoy is a district that I need to
go through to get to my house). The public
bus I took would be filled with all kinds of
people and I, as the youth, would be standing.
(In TUrkey, if you are young, it is customary to
yield your seat to the elderly in a full bus). It
would be silent. It would be dark. I would
stare into the darkness. I'd ponder memories,
about Stanford, about disappointments,
about pleasures, about the comedy of pon
dering memories more often than actually
collecting them. I'd think about people I have
never really gotten to know. I'd ponder the
girl who never said a thing in my PWR class.
I'd wonder about this kid whom I met at my

high school prom and promised to call after
wards. He was into music and he had a CD
full of his own compositions. 1 had promised
to listen to it. He had given me his phone
number, but 1 had never called him, and I
would ponder calling him. I'd ponder my
high school physics teacher. I'd ponder the
people around me. I'd wonder about when
the traffic jam would finally dissolve. I'd pon
der what was happening in Iraq.
But then. I'd ponder myself.
I'd think about all the arbitrary things I
did not choose in my life — my nationality,
my gender, my height, my voice, my palm
lines. I'd ponder what people thought of me
and memories would keep rushing in... The
jam would finally end and my mental state
would assume normalcy.
I continued to juggle memories this way.
During the night at Stanford, I'll often feel
imprisoned and suffocated in my room. Re
membering the words of Orhan Veli Kanik
— a Ilirkish poet — I'll rush out the door,
"since these clothes and shoes belong to me
and these streets to no one."
I'll start riding my bike for no reason. No
one will be around. When the wind infuses
me and I start to shudder delightfully, part of
me will be lusting for the past. I'll think of a
book I read or a time when my brother made
me laugh. The wind will make me shudder
more and I'll feel all the more grateful for it.
I'll grow cold and unemotional and admire
the beauty of the past.
