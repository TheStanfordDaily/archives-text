## Rugby regrets: My day at a Krankenhaus 
### 
The Great Rugby Experiment has
ended in disaster. Against the advice of
my parents, friends and squash coach, I
joined a rugby "class" offered by a local uni
versity here in Berlin. I say "class" because
everyone else in the group had significant ex
perience in the sport, whereas my knowledge
is limited to a scene in "Monty Python and
the Meaning of Life."
In a move that I will forever regret, I invit
ed my good pal Chris Denton to come with
me. Now. let me tell you about Chris. This is a
fellow who apologized profusely to me when
I complained about how little peanut butter
was on the sandwich he gave me on the train
to Prague. So dragging him along to play one
of the most violent and gruesome sports on
earth was probably a bad idea in the first
place.
Not to mention that while both of us are
pretty athletic, we are somewhat lacking in
the weight department. This is especially im
portant when there are players that weigh
more in kilograms than we weigh in pounds.

At one point during the first practice two
weeks ago, as we waited in line to participate
in a particularly violent drill, we had the fol
lowing exchange.
Me: "You realize that in addition to being
the shortest and skinniest guys here, we have
also never played rugby before?"
Chris: "Don't forget we don't speak Ger
man."
But aside from the language gap and a few
falls, the first week went surprisingly well. So
well, in fact, that we bought cleats for the next
practice, which started out great. We passed
and executed drills better, and we now knew
a few key rugby words in German.
Then came the scrimmage. Ah, the scrim
mage. One guy on our team wouldn't stop
yelling orders at people and then it started to
rain heavily. We were running around getting
knocked and thrown into scrums, unsure
about the offsides rule and being very careful
to stay out of the way. Then, on the last drive
of the last possession, an opposing ball carri
er picked up steam and neared the end zone.

Chris was the last defender and attempted to
throw himself into the runner's path. He
grabbed the opponent's midsection but slid
off like butter in a hot pan and fell on his
shoulder, dislocating it.
Dammit.
All of the players gathered around and
decided to take Chris to the hospital. They
fashioned a sling for him out of a windbreak
er and the elderly German coach whispered
in my ear, "He needs you now." Another
player grabbed a post-game beer and we
hopped in his van.
"Cry if you see a hospital," he said be
tween a gulp of beer and a drag on his ciga
rette. We spotted Martin Luther Kranken
haus and pulled over. As we approached the
building, we saw a pair of teenage girls yelling
at hospital administrators and a lot of people
milling around. Strange. ITien a man in a suit
approached us, and before Chris could ex
plain his situation, led him away.
found a nurse consoling a crying
couple and a woman with a baby. A
nurse with a stack of yellow papers
asked me my friend's name. After
shuffling through the papers, she de
clared that she could not find any
Chris Denton.
"Of course you can't; he just got
here."
The rugby player exchanged
words with her in German and then,
all of a sudden, she said:
"This isn't real."
"What do vou mean this isn't

real?" 1 asked, afraid now that I may
have strayed into some parallel di
mension.
The rugby player started giggling.
"Ihis is a test," he laughed.
Wie, bitte?
"A drill. Like for emergency."
We had walked in on the German
equivalent of a Homeland Security
drill, and every patient in sight was a
paid actor. I started cracking up, but
then realized that the doctors had no
idea Chris was really hurt. After I ex
plained the situation,a nurse sat me in
the waiting room where I watched a
group of laughing Germans emerge
from the ER, covered in fake blood
and bandages.
Thirty minutes later, they let me
visit Chris, drugged and on an operat

ing table. His shoulder was now back
in place and he sported a sling, with
lots of IVs and tubes hooked up to
him. He ended up having to spend the
night at the hospital and I, being a
good pal, went out to get us food from
an Iraqi pizza stand (where 1 ended
up having a very nice conversation
about the new constitution with the
owner). I wanted to stay overnight at
the hospital with Chris but the nurse
made me leave.
Anyway, long story short, Chris got
an MRI that revealed that he had
chipped a bone in his shoulder. He has
to have surgery in a week or so and
then stay in the hospital for another
five to seven days. He had to miss the
trip to Latvia this week, too.
Now I need to decide whether or

not to go back to rugby. If I hurt my
self badly and miss squash season
when I get back, I'll kill myself. On
the other hand. I am a citizen ambas
sador for the United States (so says
my passport, at least), and I don't
want the other guys to think we
Americans are pussies. What to do? I
don't know. Hopefully I'll have it all
figured out by next practice. Help me
out and e-mail me your thoughts on
the subject.

David Herbert is serious about asking
you to weigh in on this matter. He is too
sick/tired/probably hungover from his
trip to Latvia to be entrusted with mak
ing such a monumental decision on his
own. Send him your two cents worth at
