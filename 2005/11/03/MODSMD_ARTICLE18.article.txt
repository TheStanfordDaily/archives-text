## Rugby regrets: My day at a Krankenhaus 
### 
The Great Rugby Experiment has
ended in disaster. Against the advice of
my parents, friends and squash coach, I
joined a rugby "class" offered by a local uni
versity here in Berlin. I say "class" because
everyone else in the group had significant ex
perience in the sport, whereas my knowledge
is limited to a scene in "Monty Python and
the Meaning of Life."
In a move that I will forever regret, I invit
ed my good pal Chris Denton to come with
me. Now. let me tell you about Chris. This is a
fellow who apologized profusely to me when
I complained about how little peanut butter
was on the sandwich he gave me on the train
to Prague. So dragging him along to play one
of the most violent and gruesome sports on
earth was probably a bad idea in the first
place.
Not to mention that while both of us are
pretty athletic, we are somewhat lacking in
the weight department. This is especially im
portant when there are players that weigh
more in kilograms than we weigh in pounds.

At one point during the first practice two
weeks ago, as we waited in line to participate
in a particularly violent drill, we had the fol
lowing exchange.
Me: "You realize that in addition to being
the shortest and skinniest guys here, we have
also never played rugby before?"
Chris: "Don't forget we don't speak Ger
man."
But aside from the language gap and a few
falls, the first week went surprisingly well. So
well, in fact, that we bought cleats for the next
practice, which started out great. We passed
and executed drills better, and we now knew
a few key rugby words in German.
Then came the scrimmage. Ah, the scrim
mage. One guy on our team wouldn't stop
yelling orders at people and then it started to
rain heavily. We were running around getting
knocked and thrown into scrums, unsure
about the offsides rule and being very careful
to stay out of the way. Then, on the last drive
of the last possession, an opposing ball carri
er picked up steam and neared the end zone.

Chris was the last defender and attempted to
throw himself into the runner's path. He
grabbed the opponent's midsection but slid
off like butter in a hot pan and fell on his
shoulder, dislocating it.
Dammit.
All of the players gathered around and
decided to take Chris to the hospital. They
fashioned a sling for him out of a windbreak
er and the elderly German coach whispered
in my ear, "He needs you now." Another
player grabbed a post-game beer and we
hopped in his van.
"Cry if you see a hospital," he said be
tween a gulp of beer and a drag on his ciga
rette. We spotted Martin Luther Kranken
haus and pulled over. As we approached the
building, we saw a pair of teenage girls yelling
at hospital administrators and a lot of people
milling around. Strange. ITien a man in a suit
approached us, and before Chris could ex
plain his situation, led him away.
