# Lecturer paints grim picture of Sudan
## Talk examines nations role in global society 
### JAMES HOHMANN 
"Sudan is the lynchpin of a whole series of
emerging global issues," renowned social anthro
pologist Sharon Hutchinson told a Stanford
forum held at the Humanities Center last night.
Hutchinson, a professor of social anthropology
at the University of Wisconsin — Madison,
painted a picture of Sudan as a flash-point for the
future of human rights, the United Nations and
America's role in the world.
The talk, sponsored by the Abbasi Program in
Islamic Studies, was the fifth in a series on "Mus
lims Debating Globalization and Difference."
Hutchinson, who spent two months in the south
of Sudan with the U.S. Agency for International
Development, focused on the dire situation she
witnessed, its history and its context.
"If you listen to the media in 2005, you get
both hope and a confusing message of despair,"
she said, referring first to the January 2005 peace
agreement that is supposed to bring an end to the
22-year civil war, and second to the continued
genocide in the Darfur region.
Hutchinson painted a grim picture of the situ
ation in Darfur, arguing that the government
continues to support genocide with coordinated
attacks between the Janjaweed militia and the
national Air Force. Since 2003, she estimated
that two million people have been displaced,
more than 3(K),(XK) have died and hundreds of
thousands have fled from the violence to neigh
boring Chad.
Additionally, the progress brought with the
national ceasefire and coalition government
will not bring long-term peace,she predicted. In
January, a coalition government was formed
that tentatively offered Southern Sudan the
right to have a referendum in six years on
whether to secede from the north. More than
four and a half million people have been dis
placed and two and a half million have been
killed as a result of the war between the North
and South that began in 1983.
"The problem is that the government in

"The current U.S. polciy is one
of appeasement, despite the
continued problems in Darfur
and the failure of the North to
follow the peage agreement"
— Sharon Hutchinson

Khartoum has absolutely no real interest in car
rying out the peace agreement with the South."
she said.
Hutchinson pointed out that there is only a
"cosmetic effort by the North" because many in
the government feel they would be voted out of
power if planned elections are held in the years
to come, fearing that the South will take over the
much-coveted oil supply.
"Sudan is at the heart of a global grab for oil,"
she said, presenting oil as the factor that has per
petuated violence and undermined numerous
peace agreements since significant deposits were
discovered in 1979. Government profits from the
sale of oil contracts have purchased weapons
that are used in the struggle for control over the
oil fields, she explained.
This thirst for oil has driven China to protect
Sudan from the United Nations by threatening
to veto sanctions on Sudan, a power it has as a
permanent member of the Security Council.
"They have basically said they will veto any
resolution that fingers the government of Sudan
[for the genocide in Darfur] as opposed to the
rebels...The UN is hamstrung because of the ve
toes on the Security Council," she said."Because
of the structure of the Security Council, there has
not been an effective response."
"Western governments turn a blind eye" to let
the resources be taken, she continued.

Hutchinson, who has spent much of her ca
reer studying Sudan, rebuked the United States
government for moving toward a policy that fails
to acknowledge the magnitude of Sudan's prob
lems.
"The current U.S. policy is one of appease
ment, despite the continued problems in Darfur
and the failure of the North to follow the peace
agreement," she said. "Colin Powell called it
genocide, but in the same breath, he said it would
not affect our relations with Sudan. At that point,
in my opinion, the [ 1 c >4BJ Genocide Convention
was gutted by the world's most powerful coun
try."
To provide context, Hutchinson gave a fast
paced history of the region since independence
was declared from the United Kingdom in 1956.
She also chronicled American foreign policy in
relation to Sudan since Bill CMinton came into of
fice in 1993.
Multiple audience members were struck by
how much she covered in her hour-long lecture.
"She was very comprehensive," said Elaine
Windrich, a visiting scholar in African Studies.
"Sudan is such a difficult problem with all the
people and all the various countries involved.
She covered the issues well and quite simply.
Most importantly, she did not speak in political
science jargon."
"The talk definitely clarified a number of
global economic and political forces that are
playing a part in the conflict," said Margari Hill,
a second year master's student in the History
Department studying Islamic Africa. "It's
something that's hard to see when you're fo
cused on the rhetoric of ethnic or religious con
flict."
Hutchinson will lead a discussion Thursday
on a paper she has recently published about the
potential negative effects of international mon
itoring and inspection teams.The discussion will
take place in the Stanford Humanities Center
Board Room from 4:15 to 5:45 p.m. A copy of
her 20-page paper was made available to atten
dees at Wednesday night's lecture. The discus
sion will be based on Hutchinson's personal ex
perience as a member of the U.S. Department of
State-sanctioned Civilian Protection Monitor
ing Team.

playing a part in the conflict," said Margari Hill,
a second year master's student in the History
Department studying Islamic Africa. "It's
something that's hard to see when you're fo
cused on the rhetoric of ethnic or religious con
flict."
Hutchinson will lead a discussion Thursday
on a paper she has recently published about the
potential negative effects of international mon
itoring and inspection teams.The discussion will
take place in the Stanford Humanities Center
Board Room from 4:15 to 5:45 p.m. A copy of
her 20-page paper was made available to atten
dees at Wednesday night's lecture. The discus
sion will be based on Hutchinson's personal ex
perience as a member of the U.S. Department of
State-sanctioned Civilian Protection Monitor
ing Team.
"Sudan is the lynchpin of a whole series of
emerging global issues," renowned social anthro
pologist Sharon Hutchinson told a Stanford
forum held at the Humanities Center last night.
Hutchinson, a professor of social anthropology
at the University of Wisconsin — Madison,
painted a picture of Sudan as a flash-point for the
future of human rights, the United Nations and
America's role in the world.
The talk, sponsored by the Abbasi Program in
Islamic Studies, was the fifth in a series on "Mus
lims Debating Globalization and Difference."
Hutchinson, who spent two months in the south
of Sudan with the U.S. Agency for International
Development, focused on the dire situation she
witnessed, its history and its context.
"If you listen to the media in 2005, you get
both hope and a confusing message of despair,"
she said, referring first to the January 2005 peace
agreement that is supposed to bring an end to the
22-year civil war, and second to the continued
genocide in the Darfur region.
Hutchinson painted a grim picture of the situ
ation in Darfur, arguing that the government
continues to support genocide with coordinated
attacks between the Janjaweed militia and the
national Air Force. Since 2003, she estimated
that two million people have been displaced,
more than 3(K),(XK) have died and hundreds of
thousands have fled from the violence to neigh
boring Chad.
Additionally, the progress brought with the
national ceasefire and coalition government
will not bring long-term peace,she predicted. In
January, a coalition government was formed
that tentatively offered Southern Sudan the
right to have a referendum in six years on
whether to secede from the north. More than
four and a half million people have been dis
placed and two and a half million have been
killed as a result of the war between the North
and South that began in 1983.
"The problem is that the government in

"The current U.S. polciy is one
of appeasement, despite the
continued problems in Darfur
and the failure of the North to
follow the peage agreement"
— Sharon Hutchinson

Khartoum has absolutely no real interest in car
rying out the peace agreement with the South."
she said.
Hutchinson pointed out that there is only a
"cosmetic effort by the North" because many in
the government feel they would be voted out of
power if planned elections are held in the years
to come, fearing that the South will take over the
much-coveted oil supply.
"Sudan is at the heart of a global grab for oil,"
she said, presenting oil as the factor that has per
petuated violence and undermined numerous
peace agreements since significant deposits were
discovered in 1979. Government profits from the
sale of oil contracts have purchased weapons
that are used in the struggle for control over the
oil fields, she explained.
This thirst for oil has driven China to protect
Sudan from the United Nations by threatening
to veto sanctions on Sudan, a power it has as a
permanent member of the Security Council.
"They have basically said they will veto any
resolution that fingers the government of Sudan
[for the genocide in Darfur] as opposed to the
rebels...The UN is hamstrung because of the ve
toes on the Security Council," she said."Because
of the structure of the Security Council, there has
not been an effective response."
"Western governments turn a blind eye" to let
the resources be taken, she continued.

Hutchinson, who has spent much of her ca
reer studying Sudan, rebuked the United States
government for moving toward a policy that fails
to acknowledge the magnitude of Sudan's prob
lems.
"The current U.S. policy is one of appease
ment, despite the continued problems in Darfur
and the failure of the North to follow the peace
agreement," she said. "Colin Powell called it
genocide, but in the same breath, he said it would
not affect our relations with Sudan. At that point,
in my opinion, the [ 1 c >4BJ Genocide Convention
was gutted by the world's most powerful coun
try."
To provide context, Hutchinson gave a fast
paced history of the region since independence
was declared from the United Kingdom in 1956.
She also chronicled American foreign policy in
relation to Sudan since Bill CMinton came into of
fice in 1993.
Multiple audience members were struck by
how much she covered in her hour-long lecture.
"She was very comprehensive," said Elaine
Windrich, a visiting scholar in African Studies.
"Sudan is such a difficult problem with all the
people and all the various countries involved.
She covered the issues well and quite simply.
Most importantly, she did not speak in political
science jargon."
"The talk definitely clarified a number of
global economic and political forces that are
playing a part in the conflict," said Margari Hill,
a second year master's student in the History
Department studying Islamic Africa. "It's
