# Abortion initiative incites controversy
## Student groups rally for and against Prop. 73 
### AMIT ARORA 
With the California special election ap
proaching on Nov. 8, debate over election
initiatives continues to intensify. Proposi
tion 73, concerning parental notification

previous to a minor's abortion, has emerged
as an especially controversial issue both on
and off Stanford's campus.
If approved, the initiative would require
parental notification a minimum of 48 hours
before an abortion could be performed. The
bill would also define abortion, as resulting
in the "death of the unborn child " and
would financially penalize physicians who
refuse to provide such notification.

Prop. 73 has received considerable sup
port in California from a number of
Catholic organizations and family-based
groups. Its supporters argue that parents can
provide the necessary support their daugh
ters need in making such an important life
decision. Also, advocates of the initiative
cite that more than 30 other states in the na
tion have already implemented similar
statutes and have lareelv benefited from

parental notification laws.
Here on campus, organizations such as
the Stanford College Republicans and the
Stanford Students for Life have been active
in their support for the proposition. Junior
Megan Reiss, communications director for
the College Republicans, highlighted the
measure's importance.
