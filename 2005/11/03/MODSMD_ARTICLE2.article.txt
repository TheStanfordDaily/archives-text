# Abortion initiative incites controversy
## Student groups rally for and against Prop. 73 
### AMIT ARORA 
With the California special election ap
proaching on Nov. 8, debate over election
initiatives continues to intensify. Proposi
tion 73, concerning parental notification

previous to a minor's abortion, has emerged
as an especially controversial issue both on
and off Stanford's campus.
If approved, the initiative would require
parental notification a minimum of 48 hours
before an abortion could be performed. The
bill would also define abortion, as resulting
in the "death of the unborn child " and
would financially penalize physicians who
refuse to provide such notification.

Prop. 73 has received considerable sup
port in California from a number of
Catholic organizations and family-based
groups. Its supporters argue that parents can
provide the necessary support their daugh
ters need in making such an important life
decision. Also, advocates of the initiative
cite that more than 30 other states in the na
tion have already implemented similar
statutes and have lareelv benefited from

parental notification laws.
Here on campus, organizations such as
the Stanford College Republicans and the
Stanford Students for Life have been active
in their support for the proposition. Junior
Megan Reiss, communications director for
the College Republicans, highlighted the
measure's importance.
"You can't give a minor a lyienol
capsule in school, but she can have an
abortion without parental notifica
tion," she said.
Reiss also noted the sense of des
peration involved in such a decision.
"The 14-year old does not have
the same logical outlook as an adult,"
she said. "A minor considering abor
tion is in a horrible situation, and this
proposition will give her added sup
port."
Opponents, however, assert that
Prop. 73 is dangerous, because it
could force some teenagers to seek il
legal and unsafe abortions simply to
avoid parental notification. Organi
zations, such as the California Med
ical Association and Planned Parent
hood, agree that a strong family ties
are essential in a teenager's life, but
argue that some families may jeop
ardize a minor's health, according to
Planned Parenthood's Web site. Al
though the initiative provides a minor
the opportunity to waive notice by
going to court, opponents contend
that this process is confusing and un
appealing to an individual in need of
an abortion.
A number of Stanford student
groups have rallied in opposition to
Prop. 73. Through demonstrations at
White Plaza and the posting of fliers,
sophomore Selena Simmons-Duffin
and others with the Stanford Stu
dents for Choice hope to defeat the
bill.
"Proposition 73 would force some
minors to turn to self-induced abor
tions and other illegal and unsafe pro
cedures," Simmons-Duffin said. "The
initiative prevents and delays a
minor's access to legal and safe med
ical care."
Simmons-Duffin also noted mi
nors' inability to participate in the
election process itself.
"The access to health care of these
teenagers is being judged here with

out these individuals actually being
able to vote themselves," she said.
If approved. Prop. 73 would likely
increase state costs by several million
dollars. With State Department budg
ets amounting to billions of dollars,
however, the financial implications of
the initiative would be relatively min
imal. Rather, support and opposition
for the bill have largely been based on
social opinions and concerns.
Privacy rights have also played a
role in the debate, as some organiza
tions— such as the American Civil
Liberties Union — have opposed the
initiative on constitutional grounds.
These groups have cited the legal his
tory behind minor abortion.
The California State Supreme
Court, for example, declared parental
consent laws illegal in 1997, referenc
ing the precedent handed down in
Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services and Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey, which established constitu
tional rights to privacy.
On the same note, some question
the value of the initiative in Califor
nia state politics, when considerable
legal precedent already exists.
"In California, a very significant
part of the legislature is not created
by the legislature itself," said History
Prof. David Kennedy. "Our body of
law, as a result, is an accumulation of
single-minded issues."
Supporters for the bill, however,
have claimed that Prop. 73 has not
been addressed by the legislature and
therefore must be dealt with through
the initiative process. Advocates assert
that the proposition does not require
parental consent, but simply parental
notification. In this way, a minor's right
to privacy would not be infringed;
rather, communication within the
family would be encouraged.
A recent poll, conducted by the
Public Policy Institute of California,
shows support among likely voters
for the initiative at 42 percent, with 48
percent opposed. With 10 percent of
those surveyed unsure. Proposition
73 remains a closely-contested issue
and will likely remain so until Elec
tion Day.
