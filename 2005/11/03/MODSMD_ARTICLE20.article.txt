## WOMENS VOLLEYBALL Cardinal takes another hit Setter Bryn Kehoe suffers broken right hand days before UW rematch 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just when it seemed things couldn't get tougher for the
No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team (20-3,9-2 Pacific
-10 Conference), the injury hug has visited the Cardinal
once again.
Sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe broke her right hand
diving fora ball during practice Monday and is out indefi
nitely. Kehoe, who underwent surgery Tuesday, joins an in
jury list that includes freshmen outside hitters Cynthia
Barboza (who led the Pac-10 in kills up until last weekend)
and Alex Fisher (who has not played all season).

Like Barboza. Kehoe
was enjoying an All-
American season, rank
ing second in the Pac-10
in assists with 1.101. and
third in the conference in
aces with .47 aces per
game.
Stanford travels to
Pac-10 leader Washing
ton (20-0,11 -0) today in a
rematch of an Oct. 8
four-game match that
ended the Cardinal's 15-
match winning streak.
The Huskies hit .355 for
the match, while limiting
Stanford to .247 in the 3-
1 loss.

"This weekend
will take a team
effort. The home
team will have
the advantage,
so we Ye going
to have to be
tough."

Washington's sophomore outside hitter Christal Mor
rison collected 26 kills in the contest and currently leads
the team with 4.14 kills per game. Senior outside hitter
Sanja Tomasevic finishes off the offensive one-two punch
with just over four kills per game. Collectively, the Huskies
lead the nation in hitting (.363). rank second in kills per
game (17.29) and rank sixth in assists per game (17.29).
"[The Washington match] is going to be tough because
they're such a good team," head coach John Dunning said.
"We have played them so much that we know what they
do. It's just a matter of stopping them â€” something every
team has had trouble with."
The Cardinal then visit Washington State (8-16, 1-10)
tomorrow night after having swept the Cougars at Maples
Pavilion on Oct. 7. Washington State lost two four-game
matches to Arizona State and No. 9 Arizona last weekend.
Despite remaining in the cellar of the Pac-10. the Cougars
boast a tough defense, leading the conference with 3.44
blocks per game. The Cardinal also face the tough chal
lenge of adapting to playing without another key player in
Kehoe.
"This weekend will take a team effort," Dunning said.
"The home team will have the advantage, so we're going
to have to be tough. This could be great for us in terms of
learning to play tougher."
