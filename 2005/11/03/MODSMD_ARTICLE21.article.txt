## Women seeded third at NorPac Tourney Cardinal likely to face rivals Cal and Pacific during tide quest 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Stanford field hockey team, the confer
ence season has practically come full circle. Stanford
(6-12, 4-2 Northern Pacific Conference) enters the
NorPac Championship this weekend seeded third
with a match against Appalachian State (3-12, 0-6)
today at 2:30 p.m. in Berkeley.
The Cardinal faced the Mountaineers in their first
conference game of the season, blanking them 2-0,
and with the regular season now over, the team is
back to a clean slate. Junior forward Liz Robinson
and junior defender/midfielder Julia Drewes both
scored during the first period of the Sept. 7 game to
give the Cardinal an early lead. Stanford dominated
around the arc.outshooting the Mountaineers 15-0.
"We have already beat Appalachian State once
this season on their home field," freshman
forward/midfielder Chloe Bade said. "Now that
they're on our coast, we plan on doing it again."
A win over Appalachian State would pit Stanford
against arch-rival California (10-7,5-1), who is seed
ed second. The Cardinal played the hosting Golden
Bears last weekend, falling 3-2 in overtime with
prodigious Cal junior forward Valentina Godfrid
scoring all three goals.
The Cardinal managed to score first in that match
to gain a quick 1 -0 lead, and then again took the lead
at 2-1, but were unable to hold on. Cal tied the game,
and Godfrid scored 24 seconds into overtime to give
the Golden Bears the victory.
Godfrid leads the NorPac conference with 61
points (25 goals and 11 assists), more than double
that of second-place Pacific junior Vianney Campos.
Stanford also faces tough competition from West
Coast rival and top seed Pacific (7-11,5-1). The two
teams faced off on Oct. 1, and the Tigers came out on
top in a shootout session following overtime.
The Cardinal managed to pick up a 2-0 lead in the
first half thanks to unassisted goals from sophomore
midfielder/forward Jess Zutz at 26:52 and 33:53. Se
nior midfielder Missy Halliday scored early in the sec
ond half to give the Cardinal a substantial 3-0 lead.
The squad was unable to maintain the lead how
ever, allowing the Tigers to score thrice in under 10
minutes.
