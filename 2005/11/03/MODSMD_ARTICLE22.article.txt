# Look into my crystal ball: Card hoops on the rise
## 
### 
Saturday marks the clay that all Cardinal basket
ball fans yearn for.The day when we flock to pick up
our Sixth Man shirts, eat a little barbeque and warm
up our chants for the upcoming season.
I'm still in awe of last season's team. For those
new to Cardinal basketball, here's the rundown of
last season:
Preseason magazines labeled the Cardinal a re
building team that might crawl into the NCAA
Tournament. However, even those expectations
were thrown out the window when the Cardinal
were upset by Santa Clara and were barely able to
fend off Denver. But there was some hope after a
close loss to Washington in January.
Then the depletion of the team began. Promising
guard Tim Morris was lost to academic ineligibility
and leading scorer Dan "Danimal" Grunfeld was
sidelined with a season-ending injury. Yet, with no
true shooting guard on the roster and a three-man
bench (with two freshmen), Trent Johnson's squad
upset both Arizona and Washington and defeated a
highly regarded UCLA twice.
The Cardinal simply ran out of gas and healthy
players in its lopsided loss to Mississippi State in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament. However,
Coach J hopes that the Cardinal's defeat will serve
as motivation for this season's squad.The loss has at
least motivated me to make my preseason predic
tions in my final season as a member of the es
teemed Sixth Man Club.
I'll come out firing:The Cardinal will win the Pa
cific-10 Conference. The Pac-10 is slowly becoming
more than an Arizona-Stanford race at the top.
UCLA and Washington are improving programs;
USC has a new coach, but not enough talent to com
pete yet; Cal has the talent but not the coach. In a
few years, the Pac-10 will be one of the deepest con
ferences in the NCAA.
However, this is a rebuilding year for several
Pac-10 teams. Arizona is looking for leaders to
emerge after losing Salim Stoudamire and Chan
ning Frye.The Huskies have two highly regarded re
cruiting classes coming to Seattle this year and the
next, but will need to define themselves without the
fearless Nate Robinson and their unselfish floor
leader. Will Conroy. This year will really show us
what kind of coach Lorenzo Romar is. (He's a good
one).
My early take is that the Cardinal's experience
and athleticism make them the favorite to win the
Pac-10. They boast the conference's best backcourt


Raghav
Thapar
Rants and Raves
in Chris Hernandez and Grunfeld
and arguably one of the conference's
top three post players in Matt "Tru
man" Haryasz. If you factor in ath
letic wings Tim Morris and Fred
Washington — both excellent de
fenders — the Cardinal have the
best starting five in the Pac-10.
Depth in the frontcourt is the
biggest issue for Stanford. Beyond
Haryasz, Peter Prowitt is the only
other true low-post player on the
team.
This leads me my next predic
tion: Prowitt's development will
play a key role in how far the Cardi
nal advance. Getting post defense
and some foul-free minutes from
him will allow Haryasz to play on
the perimeter more and will help to
improve the Cardinal's half-court
game. He doesn't need to channel
Mark Madsen (yet), as a good Joe
Kirchoffer impersonation would
suffice.
This is a much different squad than
past Cardinal teams, though. This
year's team does not have the likes of
the Collins twins, Curtis Borchardt or
even Justin Davis, and it lacks a dead
eye sharpshooter of the Casey Jacob
sen or Matt Lottich caliber.
However, this team is very athlet
ic with the likes of Morris, Haryasz,
Washington and freshman forward
Lawrence Hill. The Cardinal will
likely utilize that athleticism in play
ing a more up-tempo game.
Speaking of Lawrence Hill, this
year's freshman class is the best since
the Haryasz, Grunfeld, Jason Haas

class of 2002. I expect Hill and
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony
Goods to make an immediate im
pact this season.
Even if they don't, the Cardinal
could easily be 10-0 when they start
the Pac-10 season.They better be 10-
0 because Stanford has a weak non
conference schedule (excluding a
February game against Gonzaga). A
loss to any of those teams could kick
the Cardinal out of the top 25.
But, since my crystal ball says
they won't lose any of those games,
it's easy to predict that the Cardinal
will stay in the top 25 all season.
They are currently ranked 13th, and
with a few key wins, could finish in
the top 10.
Now for the most important pre
diction: An injury to Haryasz or Her
nandez will nix all the aforemen
tioned forecasts.This Stanford squad
is already playing with two unfilled
scholarships, giving Coach J a pre
cariously thin roster. Injuries this
season could make the difference
between a run in the NCAATourna
ment and a trip to the NIT
However, since I wear Cardinal
colored glasses (no really, I own a
pair), I expect Stanford to avoid seri
ous injury (the team had enough of it
last year) and have a relatively
healthy season.
This leads me to my final predic
tion: Led by the three seniors and
exceptional play from Morris,
Washington, Prowitt and the fresh
men, Stanford reaches the Sweet 16
this vear.

Mark Madsen (yet), as a good Joe
Kirchoffer impersonation would
suffice.
This is a much different squad than
past Cardinal teams, though. This
year's team does not have the likes of
the Collins twins, Curtis Borchardt or
even Justin Davis, and it lacks a dead
eye sharpshooter of the Casey Jacob
sen or Matt Lottich caliber.
However, this team is very athlet
ic with the likes of Morris, Haryasz,
Washington and freshman forward
Lawrence Hill. The Cardinal will
likely utilize that athleticism in play
ing a more up-tempo game.
Speaking of Lawrence Hill, this
year's freshman class is the best since
the Haryasz, Grunfeld, Jason Haas

class of 2002. I expect Hill and
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony
Goods to make an immediate im
pact this season.
Even if they don't, the Cardinal
could easily be 10-0 when they start
the Pac-10 season.They better be 10-
0 because Stanford has a weak non
conference schedule (excluding a
February game against Gonzaga). A
loss to any of those teams could kick
the Cardinal out of the top 25.
But, since my crystal ball says
they won't lose any of those games,
it's easy to predict that the Cardinal
will stay in the top 25 all season.
They are currently ranked 13th, and
with a few key wins, could finish in
the top 10.
Now for the most important pre
diction: An injury to Haryasz or Her
nandez will nix all the aforemen
tioned forecasts.This Stanford squad
is already playing with two unfilled
scholarships, giving Coach J a pre
cariously thin roster. Injuries this
season could make the difference
between a run in the NCAATourna
ment and a trip to the NIT
However, since I wear Cardinal
colored glasses (no really, I own a
pair), I expect Stanford to avoid seri
ous injury (the team had enough of it
last year) and have a relatively
healthy season.
This leads me to my final predic
tion: Led by the three seniors and
exceptional play from Morris,
Washington, Prowitt and the fresh
men, Stanford reaches the Sweet 16
this vear.

Saturday marks the clay that all Cardinal basket
ball fans yearn for.The day when we flock to pick up
our Sixth Man shirts, eat a little barbeque and warm
up our chants for the upcoming season.
I'm still in awe of last season's team. For those
new to Cardinal basketball, here's the rundown of
last season:
Preseason magazines labeled the Cardinal a re
building team that might crawl into the NCAA
Tournament. However, even those expectations
were thrown out the window when the Cardinal
were upset by Santa Clara and were barely able to
fend off Denver. But there was some hope after a
close loss to Washington in January.
Then the depletion of the team began. Promising
guard Tim Morris was lost to academic ineligibility
and leading scorer Dan "Danimal" Grunfeld was
sidelined with a season-ending injury. Yet, with no
true shooting guard on the roster and a three-man
bench (with two freshmen), Trent Johnson's squad
upset both Arizona and Washington and defeated a
highly regarded UCLA twice.
The Cardinal simply ran out of gas and healthy
players in its lopsided loss to Mississippi State in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament. However,
Coach J hopes that the Cardinal's defeat will serve
as motivation for this season's squad.The loss has at
least motivated me to make my preseason predic
tions in my final season as a member of the es
teemed Sixth Man Club.
I'll come out firing:The Cardinal will win the Pa
cific-10 Conference. The Pac-10 is slowly becoming
more than an Arizona-Stanford race at the top.
UCLA and Washington are improving programs;
USC has a new coach, but not enough talent to com
pete yet; Cal has the talent but not the coach. In a
few years, the Pac-10 will be one of the deepest con
ferences in the NCAA.
However, this is a rebuilding year for several
Pac-10 teams. Arizona is looking for leaders to
emerge after losing Salim Stoudamire and Chan
ning Frye.The Huskies have two highly regarded re
cruiting classes coming to Seattle this year and the
next, but will need to define themselves without the
fearless Nate Robinson and their unselfish floor
leader. Will Conroy. This year will really show us
what kind of coach Lorenzo Romar is. (He's a good
one).
My early take is that the Cardinal's experience
and athleticism make them the favorite to win the
Pac-10. They boast the conference's best backcourt


Raghav
Thapar
Rants and Raves
in Chris Hernandez and Grunfeld
and arguably one of the conference's
top three post players in Matt "Tru
man" Haryasz. If you factor in ath
letic wings Tim Morris and Fred
Washington — both excellent de
fenders — the Cardinal have the
best starting five in the Pac-10.
Depth in the frontcourt is the
biggest issue for Stanford. Beyond
Haryasz, Peter Prowitt is the only
other true low-post player on the
team.
This leads me my next predic
tion: Prowitt's development will
play a key role in how far the Cardi
nal advance. Getting post defense
and some foul-free minutes from
him will allow Haryasz to play on
the perimeter more and will help to
improve the Cardinal's half-court
game. He doesn't need to channel
Mark Madsen (yet), as a good Joe
Kirchoffer impersonation would
suffice.
