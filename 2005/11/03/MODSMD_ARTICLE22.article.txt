# Look into my crystal ball: Card hoops on the rise
## 
### 
Saturday marks the clay that all Cardinal basket
ball fans yearn for.The day when we flock to pick up
our Sixth Man shirts, eat a little barbeque and warm
up our chants for the upcoming season.
I'm still in awe of last season's team. For those
new to Cardinal basketball, here's the rundown of
last season:
Preseason magazines labeled the Cardinal a re
building team that might crawl into the NCAA
Tournament. However, even those expectations
were thrown out the window when the Cardinal
were upset by Santa Clara and were barely able to
fend off Denver. But there was some hope after a
close loss to Washington in January.
Then the depletion of the team began. Promising
guard Tim Morris was lost to academic ineligibility
and leading scorer Dan "Danimal" Grunfeld was
sidelined with a season-ending injury. Yet, with no
true shooting guard on the roster and a three-man
bench (with two freshmen), Trent Johnson's squad
upset both Arizona and Washington and defeated a
highly regarded UCLA twice.
The Cardinal simply ran out of gas and healthy
players in its lopsided loss to Mississippi State in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament. However,
Coach J hopes that the Cardinal's defeat will serve
as motivation for this season's squad.The loss has at
least motivated me to make my preseason predic
tions in my final season as a member of the es
teemed Sixth Man Club.
I'll come out firing:The Cardinal will win the Pa
cific-10 Conference. The Pac-10 is slowly becoming
more than an Arizona-Stanford race at the top.
UCLA and Washington are improving programs;
USC has a new coach, but not enough talent to com
pete yet; Cal has the talent but not the coach. In a
few years, the Pac-10 will be one of the deepest con
ferences in the NCAA.
However, this is a rebuilding year for several
Pac-10 teams. Arizona is looking for leaders to
emerge after losing Salim Stoudamire and Chan
ning Frye.The Huskies have two highly regarded re
cruiting classes coming to Seattle this year and the
next, but will need to define themselves without the
fearless Nate Robinson and their unselfish floor
leader. Will Conroy. This year will really show us
what kind of coach Lorenzo Romar is. (He's a good
one).
My early take is that the Cardinal's experience
and athleticism make them the favorite to win the
Pac-10. They boast the conference's best backcourt
