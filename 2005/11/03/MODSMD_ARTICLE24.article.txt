## Women make final push for NCAAs Stanford takes on Pac-10 foes Oregon and OSU on the road 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A casual observer might be surprised at the
nature of the Stanford women's soccer team's
practices this week. The Cardinal — who have
been ranked as high as No. 19 in the nation —
have decided to go back to the basics, meticulous
ly performing simple repetition drills, as they pre
pare for the final weekend of Pacific-10 Confer
ence play.
Although no longer in the running to capture
the conference title, the Cardinal (8-6-3, 2-3-2
Pac-10) have to break their five-game winless
streak this weekend against Oregon State and
Oregon to ensure a place in the NCAA Tourna
ment. And while Stanford has not necessarily
been outplayed on the field by its rivals in the Pac
-10, the team has failed to capitalize in the final
third. Head coach Paul Ratcliffe is determined to
change that this weekend.
"I think the team has been playing with great
confidence," Ratcliffe said. "The only part
where we don't have [enough] confidence is just
finishing. [The team] knows that they are play
ing solid soccer, good possession with a good
style of play but we don't have confidence that
we're going to score and that's what we're going
to keep working on."
However, Oregon State, who Stanford meets
at 2 p.m. tomorrow, is also relying on this week
end's results to fight fora place in the NCAA
Tournament. The Cardinal attack plans to come
up against junior goalie Melissa Onstad, who is
Oregon State's record holder in goals against av
erage. On the other end of the field, leading the
Beavers' attack, is last year's Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year Jodie Taylor and senior forward Stacey
Mescher, who scored the winner against Washing
ton last weekend.
Although Stanford heads into Sunday's
match against Oregon with confidence, holding
a perfect 8-0-0 all-time record against the
Ducks, the Cardinal is to face a team deter
mined to earn its first winning season in pro
gram history. Last weekend's victory over Wash
ington helped Oregon secure a .500 season for
only the second time and the Ducks will be look
ing to improve their record even further this
weekend. In particular, senior forward Nicole
Garbin. who is tied for the lead in the Pac-10
with seven game-winning goals, is a threat the
Stanford goal on Sunday.
However, there has been much debate over
who Ratcliffe will be playing behind Stanford's
back four this weekend. While freshman keeper
Alex Gamble — who started consistently before
an injury —is returning to fitness, her replace
ment. sophomore Erica Holland, has been on
form for the Cardinal the past two weekends.

"We're hoping [Gamble] is going to get healthy
and contend fora spot down the line here." Rat
cliffe said. "But right now Erica [Holland] has
been playing well."
Last weekend's double overtime draw against
No. 4 UCLA, although frustrating, has also bol
stered the Cardinal's confidence. And as the last
weekend of the regular season approaches, the

squad's seven seniors are looking to finish their
run with the team on a high note.
"It's hard to say goodbye to this team," senior
co-captain Lindsay Hunt said. "[But] I'm excited
for the weekend to come. Hopefully we can pull
our stuff together in Oregon, get some goals and
come away with two wins and head into the play
offs on a high."

Sophomore April Wall has started all 1 7 games for the Cardinal and will hope to continue her contribu
tions this weekend. The Cardinal's postseason chances are on the line in Oregon, where they play fellow
bubble squad OSU and a Ducks team aiming for its first winning season in program history.
