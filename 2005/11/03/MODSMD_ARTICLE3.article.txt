# STUDENT LIFE
## Grad Students hear Public Safety concerns 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
Last night's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting included lengthy presentations by mem
bers of the GSC Diversity Committee and Deputy
Harris Kuhn of the Stanford Police Department,
also known as the Department of Public Safety.
Kuhn's appearance was part of the Police Depart
ment's ongoing effort to educate students about
campus safety.
Kuhn addressed the sensitive issue of domestic
violence, which he mentioned was of primary con
cern to the graduate student population. He did
not specify how widespread the issue is but did
admit that most domestic violence calls on campus
come from Escondido Village, a graduate student
housing complex.
"Domestic violence does happen here," Kuhn
said. "The Police Department and CAPS do pro
vide help for people dealing with this issue."
CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services)
is available to help students who experience a wide
variety of personal, academic and relationship
concerns, according to the organization's Web site.
Kuhn also brought up the importance of cam
pus wide earthquake preparation, especially in
light of the lessons learned from Hurricane Katri
na.
Kuhn discussed several other issues, including
student alcohol abuse, bicycle injuries and the De
partment's attempts to track down an east campus
"prowler." His presentation wrapped up with many
council members extending their
thanks for the diligence of the De
partment of Public Safety. One coun
cil member asserted that the agency
plays a crucial role in the University's
relatively low crime rate.
Additionally, Council Members
Cullin Buie, a mechanical engineer
ing graduate student, and John
Davis, an electrical engineering
graduate student, presented on be
half of the GSC Diversity Commit
tee. They discussed the committee's
recent efforts to work with the Uni
versity's administration for graduate
student diversity.
Buie, also the committee's co

chair, told The Daily that he looks
forward to additional efforts to in
crease diversity, which will take
place once the recommendations of
the Commission on Graduate Edu
cation are released.
"University administrators have
been very receptive," he said. "And
with the Graduate Education report
coming out soon, we're going to be
very active over the next year."
Buie said that the committee aims
to represent all kinds of diversity but
primarily advocates on the behalf of
women and ethnic minorities. He
also praised the University's leader
ship in fostering undergraduate di
versity but said that work can still be
done with regards to the graduate
community.
"We want Stanford to take a
stance of leadership in graduate di
versity," he said. "We'd like graduate

diversity to be among the things they
can hang their hat on and say 'we're
the best or one of the best."'
Buie and Davis also presented on
the fall diversity meeting and laid
out the committee's goals for the
winter and spring quarters.
The GSC also discussed this Sun
day's Grad Night at Flicks!, which
will be showing "Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory," as well as ideas
for constituent outreach. Some
members suggested holding council
member "office hours," graduate
student block parties and cross-de
partment socials.
In addition, the Council approved
funds for the Stanford India Associ
ation, set to have an event Sunday,
Nov. 13, and the Hopkins Marine
Station Graduate Student Organiza
tion. which is planning an upcoming
weekend event.
