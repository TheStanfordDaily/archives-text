## Students are tuned out to campus radio 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Many students are unaware, but out of the
unassuming, low-ceilinged basement of Memorial
Auditorium, Stanford students and local volun
teers with a passion for music and radio broadcast
their voices and selected sounds to the Stanford
community and beyond. The product of their
labor is KZSU 90.1 FM, the campus radio station.
With two studios and a music collection totaling
approximately 120,(XX) albums, their program
ming is best described as eclectic.
According to senior John Holgate, the station's
general manager, KZSU uses a 500-watt transmit
ter located in the hills behind campus. This signal
reaches from San Francisco to Oakland and south
to Gilroy.
However, even though it is broadcast from
right on campus, the radio station does not appear
on the radar screens of most students on campus.
"I've seen signs advertising KZSU, but never
actually tuned in," said freshman Meghan Mc-
Curdy.
Other students had similar experiences.
"I've only listened once or twice before and
that was when I had a friend doing a show," said
senior Alice Chow.
One issue precluding some from listening to
KZSU is the fact that many students do not own a
radio.
