# CAMPUS GROUPS
## Students are tuned out to campus radio 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Many students are unaware, but out of the
unassuming, low-ceilinged basement of Memorial
Auditorium, Stanford students and local volun
teers with a passion for music and radio broadcast
their voices and selected sounds to the Stanford
community and beyond. The product of their
labor is KZSU 90.1 FM, the campus radio station.
With two studios and a music collection totaling
approximately 120,(XX) albums, their program
ming is best described as eclectic.
According to senior John Holgate, the station's
general manager, KZSU uses a 500-watt transmit
ter located in the hills behind campus. This signal
reaches from San Francisco to Oakland and south
to Gilroy.
However, even though it is broadcast from
right on campus, the radio station does not appear
on the radar screens of most students on campus.
"I've seen signs advertising KZSU, but never
actually tuned in," said freshman Meghan Mc-
Curdy.
Other students had similar experiences.
"I've only listened once or twice before and
that was when I had a friend doing a show," said
senior Alice Chow.
One issue precluding some from listening to
KZSU is the fact that many students do not own a
radio.
"If I'm listening to music, I'll usu
ally listen to my iPod or the songs I
have in iTUnes," said freshman Sini
Matikainen.
McCurdy also noted that be
tween the music on their computers
and the latest iPods, there isn't the
time nor desire among students to
listen to the radio anymore.
"It seems that digital music is
starting to crowd out the radio," Mc-
Curdy said.
Holgate said that he was aware of
this issue and admitted that student
listener-ship is lower than ideal.
"A lot of students don't know we
exist," Holgate said. "We inserted
our fall quarter program guide into
The Daily, but it is difficult to adver
tise on a limited budget." It has a
policy against selling advertising
time.
Another obstacle is the very na
ture of KZSU's diverse program
ming.
"We pride ourselves on our free
form programming," Holgate said.
"At the same time, it is difficult to get
consistent listeners since the lineup
changes every quarter."
Yet some, including senior
Meenal Kumar, find the variety of
music that KZSU plays appealing.
"It's a cool way of discovering
new music," Kumar said. "It's lame
that people only listen to the songs

on their iTUnes. How else will you
know what music is out there?"
Off campus, KZSU remains very
popular with people living in the
areas surrounding Stanford, espe
cially alumni. The most popular
shows are the sports broadcasts,
particularly baseball, since KZSU is
the only station that broadcasts
Stanford baseball games. The sta
tion will also be broadcasting and
streaming the Dalai Lama's talk
Saturday morning on air and on its
Web site.
Students who do not have a
radio still have a chance to hear
what KZSU has to offer. The sta
tion has been expanding its offer
ings to the Internet and streams a
live broadcast over its Web site. Ac
cording to Lisa Dornell, public af
fairs director, students who regu
larly have i7\ines open on their
computers can check out KZSU on
the radio section, listed under
"Public" or "Eclectic."
Holgate also anticipates that the
station will soon be podcasting its
news and sports broadcasts via Stan
ford on iTUnes.
Dornell said she is optimistic
about the survival of college radio,
even with the competition it faces
from other forms of entertainment.
"College radio is a different
species entirely," Dornell said.
"There will always be an audience
that responds to new artists, that
wants to listen to music they've
never heard before and that wants
to be turned on to something won
derful."
