# Labor Looms Large

### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you tried to drive through the intersection of Campus
Drive and Palm Drive yesterday around 5 p.m. you may have
run into some trouble. If you looked past the cars ahead of
you, you would have seen picket lines of people in all four
crosswalks with signs reading "Shame on Stanford" and "Re
tirement with Dignity."
The scene was the culmination of a rally and march led by
members of the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) and Stanford Labor Action Coalation (SLAC). Ap
proximately 1 (K) Stanford students and 500 workers joined to
gether, starting in White Flaza and moving across campus.
The pack of students and campus workers marched
through the Quad and down Campus Drive until they met up
with Stanford Hospital workers who were also protesting the
current status of their contract negotiations. The crowd was
such a sight that tourists in the Ouad stopped to take pictures
of the protesters.
The event, aimed to urge the University to meet the de
mands of campus workers, was coordinated with a cclebra

tion of Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday commemo
rating the Day of the Dead. Some students had their faces
painted as skulls, a traditional symbol of the day meant to
honor ancestors.
Protesting students also carried a large puppet that one
might expect to see at a Dia de los Muertos celebration. But
this puppet was intended to represent Stanford, with large
bills coming out of its front pocket and "Stanford" written on
the back.
"It's the Stanford corporate manager pig death monster,"
said C'hris McGilvery. a worker in the Grounds Department
who attended the rally. "The other one is the SEII J goddess of
hope," he said of a similar puppet that the hospital workers
were carrying when they met up on Palm Drive.
"This is supposed to represent death to injustice," he said.
Students and workers expressed frustration with the Uni
versity and characterized current policies as a grave injustice
against workers. One worker at the rally in White Plaza ex
plained to the crowd that workers will now have to pay a high
er co-payment when they or their families go to the hospital

for treatment.
"Would you accept a $7 wage as
the best your employer could do
when $40,000 palm trees line Univer
sity Avenue?" asked junior Gabe
Bombara, a member of the Spoken
Word Collective, in a poem he pre
sented at the rally.
Bombara's poem,"The Flyer," ex
pressed the emotions that were
echoed throughout the rally.
"We can afford more because
while our school color is red. our ac
countants haven't seen that color in
ages," he said. "And the bottom line is
that to deny our workers' wages is to
deny me."
Both students and workers criti
cized the University for mistreating
its workers despite its apparent
wealth. SLAC's editorial yesterday in
The Daily described the University's
large endowment and questioned re
cent cutbacks in light the swelling
budget.
"Stanford, Stanford, you're no
good. Treat your workers like you
should!" read one slogan during the
march.
Zev Kvitky, a worker at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator and presi
dent of United Stanford Workers,
protested on behalf of SEIU. United
Stanford Workers represents around
13,000 workers on campus from din
ing hall servers to janitors.
"For some reason, they [the Uni
versity] think it is acceptable to slash
benefits while they are in pretty re
markable financial health," he said of
recent cutbacks on retirement bene
fits announced in February of this
year.
"It is insulting to many workers
who have been here for so long," he
said. "We used to know that we could
retire with dignity and security. But
now we see Stanford going in a differ
ent direction.There is no reason for it
other than greed."
The situation of campus workers
is different from that of workers at
the hospital. On campus, the union is
negotiating health benefits and re
tirement issues.
According to senior Chris
Vaughn, a member of SLAC. the re
opener is part of their three-year-old
contract. The aim of the unions on
campus is not necessarily to increase
benefits but to at least maintain the

benefits that have been cut. he said.
At the hospital, workers are trying
to negotiate a new contract to replace
the one that will expire on Nov. 4.
Talks so far has proved unsuccessful.
"We've been in negotiation for
four weeks now," said Willie Vaughn,
a member of the hospital workers'
bargaining committee who works in
the Hospital cafeteria. "They keep
talking about how they don't need to
be on top. they just need to be com
petitive.They may be the number one
hospital, but they offer their workers
less than Valley Medical."
Retirement benefits have been a
sticking point for negotiations,
though workers claim that hospital
management has been unresponsive
to their demands. The hospital man
agement in turn claims that the union
is uncooperative. Vaughn said.
"They don't want to give us retire
ment," Vaughn said. "When we retire
now we have no benefits. We have to
go on Medicare. You could have been
working there 20 or 30 years, but you
have to wait until you're 62 to retire.
Why can't they just pay their workers
the way they deserve to be paid? 1 just
wish they would offer something that
showed us they appreciate the dedi
cated hard work so many of us have
given the hospital."
The United Stanford Workers
(SEIU Local 715), issued a position
statement that outlined their com
plaints about worker policies. For ex
ample, they reported that the hospital
hired an anti-union consultant who
helped to implement a campaign
against representation. SEIU also
said the Hospital has refused to nego
tiate recently on safe staffing, health
insurance coverage for family mem
bers and job security. The report
states that other hospitals such as El
Camino Hospital. Good Samaritan
Hospital, O'Connor Hospital, Valley
Medical Center and Kaiser Perma
nente offer full family health insur
ance at no cost.
"Our surveys show that workers
want the industry standard of com
petitive pay and benefits." said
Charles Fonseca, a hospital worker
and union member. "And we want to
change how the management works
with us. But every time we try to ne
gotiate they say 'reject, reject, reject.
We like the contract the way it is,' is

essentially what they are saying."
Students are also trying to put
pressure on the University to support
the workers' efforts.
"There were a lot of student
groups represented at the rally, not
just SLAC," said SLAC member
Joseles de la Cruz, a senior. "The fact
that we had cultural groups and
human rights groups shows the Uni
versity that there is a growing alliance
among students and broad-based
support, and we hope that will make
them come to the bargaining table in
good faith."
"The University has not been will
ing to listen," said sophomore Matt
Seriff-Cullick, also a member of
SLAC. "But today they will see that
workers and students are willing to
organize. The message of today is that
workers and students united will not
be defeated."
Seriff-Cullick and de la Cruz
agreed that it is the responsibility of
students to support the University's
workers.
"I am troubled by being affiliated
with and giving my money to a uni
versity that is unfriendly to its work
ers," Serriff-Cullick said.
SLAC has protested Stanford's
policies in recent years. Most dramat
ically, three years ago, six students
fasted fora week until the University
would respond to their complaints
about labor policies. President John
Hennessy responded by creating a
committee to look into labor issues,
but some students are unsatisfied
with the results.
The workers' unions and SLAC
will be waiting to see what will come
out of negotiations this week, and
tehy are looking to the University for
a more positive response.
"Three years ago,six students fast
ed fora week, and this year the last of
them will be graduating," Seriff-Cul
lick said. "What will they be able to
say came of that?"
Hospital officials have generally
avoided commenting directly on the
ongoing talks.
"We are in the middle of the nego
tiation." Andrea Smith, media rela
tions manager for Stanford Hospital
and Clinics, said in an Interview with
the Daily last month. "We value the
contribution of the epmloyees and
we hope fora positive outcome."
