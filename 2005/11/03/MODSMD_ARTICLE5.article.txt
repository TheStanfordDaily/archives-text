If you tried to drive through the intersection of Campus
Drive and Palm Drive yesterday around 5 p.m. you may have
run into some trouble. If you looked past the cars ahead of
you, you would have seen picket lines of people in all four
crosswalks with signs reading "Shame on Stanford" and "Re
tirement with Dignity."
The scene was the culmination of a rally and march led by
members of the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) and Stanford Labor Action Coalation (SLAC). Ap
proximately 1 (K) Stanford students and 500 workers joined to
gether, starting in White Flaza and moving across campus.
The pack of students and campus workers marched
through the Quad and down Campus Drive until they met up
with Stanford Hospital workers who were also protesting the
current status of their contract negotiations. The crowd was
such a sight that tourists in the Ouad stopped to take pictures
of the protesters.
The event, aimed to urge the University to meet the de
mands of campus workers, was coordinated with a cclebra

tion of Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday commemo
rating the Day of the Dead. Some students had their faces
painted as skulls, a traditional symbol of the day meant to
honor ancestors.
Protesting students also carried a large puppet that one
might expect to see at a Dia de los Muertos celebration. But
this puppet was intended to represent Stanford, with large
bills coming out of its front pocket and "Stanford" written on
the back.
"It's the Stanford corporate manager pig death monster,"
said C'hris McGilvery. a worker in the Grounds Department
who attended the rally. "The other one is the SEII J goddess of
hope," he said of a similar puppet that the hospital workers
were carrying when they met up on Palm Drive.
"This is supposed to represent death to injustice," he said.
Students and workers expressed frustration with the Uni
versity and characterized current policies as a grave injustice
against workers. One worker at the rally in White Plaza ex
plained to the crowd that workers will now have to pay a high
er co-payment when they or their families go to the hospital
