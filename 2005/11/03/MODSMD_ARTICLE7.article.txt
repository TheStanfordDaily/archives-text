## University blazes trail of contention Five-year dispute with County to be resolved 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
A Dec. 13 deadline looms as Stanford and the
Santa Clara City Council work to nail down the
positioning of two recreational trails in the
foothills as part of the conditions for the General
Use Permit (GUP) acquired five years ago.
The Permit is renewed every 10 years by Santa
Clara County granting state government ap
proval to any developments on Stanford land.
Most recently granted in 2(KX). the GUP author
ized the University to develop nearly five million
square-feet of buildings on campus, including the
newly-opened Arrillaga Center for Sports and
Recreation.
The GUP stipulates that Stanford permanent
ly dedicate two trails on its land as part of the
County's larger trail project. According to the
2(XX) GUP Irails Conditions of Approval, the Uni
versity promised to "dedicate easements for, de
velop, and maintain the portions of the two trail
alignments which cross Stanford lands shown in
the 1995 Santa Clara Countywide IYails Master
Plan (Routes SI and CI)."
The recent controversy erupted over Route
CI .which follows Alpine Road down the west side
of campus Rather than laying a new trail, Stanford
argued it could improve the existing bike lane ad
jacent to Alpine Road, jutting partially into San
Mateo County This was the original alignment
outlined by the County's Master Plan.
"It is a trail that perfectly meets our commit
ment to the GUP."' said Larry 1 lorton, director of
government and community relations at Stanford.
"We believe it is an excellent recreational trail."
However,it is not considered excellentby a net
work of county community groups. Organizations
like the Committee on Green Foothills and the
Stanford Open Space Alliance have spearheaded
an effort to challenge the environmental and legal
parameters of the University's preference. Brian
Schmidt, Santa Clara County legislative advocate
for the Committee on Green Foothills, outlined
the opposition's argument.
"They are proposing to expand a sidewalk
which isn't even on the County's land," Schmidt
said."Residents along the Alpine Road, who have
nothing to do with Stanford's expansion, are hor-
rifled that the University is planning to
pave a trail straight through their front
and back yards."
What these groups propose is an
"interior" route that digs deep into the
Dish region of Stanford's property

They contend that this proposition pre
cludes any potential damage to the res
idents' property and the Stanford golf
course, a historic landmark that many
alumni fear may suffer from Stanford's
preferred CI alignment. In addition to
environmental perks, the interior align
ment would also provide more recre
ational value.
"It gets out more people into na
ture. rather than a self-defeating side
walk next to a busv street that no one

will use any more than now," Schmidt
said. "It also saves Stanford much
money from the $8 million it has allo
cated for pavement. All we ask for is a
dirt road. Although environmentalists
have been trying to reach a compro
mise, the University has acted unrea
sonably by simply saying no."
The University has staunchly held
to its original position. It has dismissed
all alternatives to CI as illegal, as they
do not follow the County's original

Master Plan.
"If we knew that the public trails
would cut so deeply into the interior of
our lands, we would have objected to
the condition of the General Use Per
mit," Horton said.
Bob Rosenzweig, former vice presi
dent of public affairs at Stanford and an
avid observer of community politics,
characterized the five-year-old dis
agreement as a simple matter of keep
ing promises.

"Personally I don't care where the
trails go," Rosenzweig said. "But what 1
do care about is that when a govern
ment body makes a deal with a private
entity, it ought to keep that deal. Stan
ford is prepared to give the trails where
it agreed to put the trails, and that's
where they ought to go."
A satisfactory agreement is still
pending and both parties will convene
at a Dec. 13 hearing to finalize the long
overdue decision.
