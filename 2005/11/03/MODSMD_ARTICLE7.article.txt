## University blazes trail of contention Five-year dispute with County to be resolved 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
A Dec. 13 deadline looms as Stanford and the
Santa Clara City Council work to nail down the
positioning of two recreational trails in the
foothills as part of the conditions for the General
Use Permit (GUP) acquired five years ago.
The Permit is renewed every 10 years by Santa

"It is a trail that perfectly meets our commit
ment to the GUP."' said Larry 1 lorton, director of
government and community relations at Stanford.
"We believe it is an excellent recreational trail."
However,it is not considered excellentby a net
work of county community groups. Organizations
like the Committee on Green Foothills and the
Stanford Open Space Alliance have spearheaded
an effort to challenge the environmental and legal
parameters of the University's preference. Brian
Schmidt, Santa Clara County legislative advocate
for the Committee on Green Foothills, outlined
the opposition's argument.
"They are proposing to expand a sidewalk
