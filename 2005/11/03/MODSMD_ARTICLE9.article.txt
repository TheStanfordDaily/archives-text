## Fear, frustration spark French riots

CLICHY-SOUS-BOIS, France (AP) — Menacing
youths smoked cigarettes in doorways yesterday and
hulks of burned cars littered the tough streets of Paris'
northeastern suburbs scarred by a week of riots that
left residents on edge and sent the government into cri
sis mode.
In a seventh consecutive night of skirmishes, young
people threw rocks at police Wednesday in six suburbs
in the Seine-Saint-Denis region north of Paris _ about a
40-minute drive from the Eiffel Tower. In one of them,
Le Blanc-Mesnil, about a dozen cars burned and curi
ous residents, some in slippers and bathrobes, poured
into the streets.
Some said the unrest — sparked by the accidental
deaths of two teenagers last week — is an expression of
frustration over grinding unemployment and police ha
rassment in the communities, where many North African
immigrants live. "It is not going to end. It is going to ex
plode," said an 18-year-old who would only give his name
as Amine.
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior
Minister Nicolas Sarkozy both canceled trips abroad to
deal with the unrest.
"The government is entirely mobilized. Its immediate
priority is to restore public order, and restore it without
delay," de Villepin said.
Muslim leaders at Clichy-sous-Bois' mosque, mean
while, prayed for peace and asked parents to keep
teenagers off the streets after skirmishes broke out after
two teenage boys were electrocuted last Thursday while
hiding in a power substation because they believed po
lice were chasing them.
The unrest spread to at least nine Paris-region towns
overnight TUesday, exposing the despair, anger and crim
inality in France's poor suburbs — fertile terrain for Is
lamic extremists, drug dealers and racketeers.
The violence, concentrated in neighborhoods with
large African and Muslim populations, has highlighted
the difficulties many European nations face with immi
grant communities feeling marginalized and restive, cut
off from the continent's prosperity and, for some extrem
ists, its values, too.
"Tliey have no work. They have nothing to do. Put
yourself in their place," said Abderrahmane Bouhout,
president of the Clichy-sous-Bois mosque, where a tear

gas grenade exploded Sunday evening. Local youths sus
pected a police attack, and authorities are investigating.
The violence cast doubt on the success of France's
model of seeking to integrate its large immigrant conv
munity — its Muslim population, at an estimated 5 mil
lion, is Western Europe's largest — by playing down
differences between ethnic groups. But rather than be
embraced as full and equal citizens, immigrants and
their French-born children often complain of police
harassment and of being refused jobs, housing and op
portunities.
"If French society accepts these tinderboxes in its so
ciety. it cannot be surprised when they explode," said
Claude Dilain, the Socialist mayor of the Clichy-sous-
Bois suburb.
Eric, a 22-year-old in Clichy-sous-Bois who was born
in France to Moroccan parents, said police target those
with dark skin. He said he has been unable to find full
time work for two years and that the riots were a demon
stration of suburban solidarity.
"People are joining together to say we've had
enough," he said. He refused to give his surname because

talking to reporters was poorly regarded in his neighbor
hood.
"We live in ghettos," he added. "Everyone lives in
fear."
Many immigrant families are trapped in housing proj
ects that were built to accommodate foreign laborers
welcomed by post-World War II France but have since
succumbed to despair, chronic unemployment and law
lessness. In some neighborhoods, drug dealers and rack
eteers hold sway and experts say Islamic radicals seek to
recruit disenchanted youths by telling them that France
has abandoned them.
"French society is in a bad state ... increasingly un
equal, increasingly segregated, and increasingly divided
along ethnic and racial lines." said sociologist Manuel
Boucher. Some youths turn to Islam to claim an identity
that is not French, "to seize on something which gives
them back their individual and collective dignity."
French governments have injected funds and job
creation schemes for years but failed to cure ills in sub
urbs where car-burnings and other crimes are daily
facts of life.
