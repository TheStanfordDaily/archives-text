" The challenge is to gain justice while V
bringing an end to the Domination
System... Violence can never stop violence
because its very success leads others to
imitate it... In his nonviolent teaching, life and death.
Jesus revealed a God of nonviolence... Nonviolence
is not a matter of legalism but of discipleship. It is the
way God has chosen to overthrow evil in the world.
And the same God who calls us to nonviolence gives
us the power to carry it out."
7 can only say that nonviolence is at the very heart
of the gospel, and that the church's task is to attempt
to spread this leaven into the life of the world... non
violence never fails, because every nonviolent act is a
revelation of God's new order breaking into the world..
The churches have never agreed that domination is
wrong What a difference they could make in the
world if they would only do so!"
