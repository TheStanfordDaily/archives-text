# SPECIAL EVENT
## Campus anticipates Dalai Lama 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students who successfully with
stood three-hour lines last spring for
tickets to see the Dalai Lama will fi
nally get their opportunity today and
Saturday. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th
Dalai Lama, will make three appear
ances over the two days, including a
large-scale meditation session in
Maples Pavilion.
The Maples event, "Meditation
and Teaching by the Dalai Lama,"
will take place in the morning and
will be followed by an afternoon dis
cussion on "The Heart of Nonvio
lence" in Memorial Church. Tomor
row he will participate in a day-long
panel with neurologists to address
"Craving, Suffering, and Choice:
Spiritual and Scientific Explorations
of Human Experience."
All events are sold out and have
largely been since tickets went on
sale last spring. Floor seating and ad
ditional bleachers extended Maples'
maximum occupancy by 1,500 to a
total of 6,500 people, allowing a num
ber of lucky students to buy tickets
when they were released by special
lottery this fall.
Although the Dalai Lama is an in
ternationally recognized peace fig
ure, his views are controversial in
certain sectors, so security for the
event will be tight. The State Depart
ment has been handling background
checks on journalists, and bomb
sniffing K-9s will be used to check at
tendees. Cameras, camera cell
phones, large purses, backpacks and
food and beverages are all forbid
den, although bottled water will be
allowed inside the venues.
"[Security] planning has been in
progress for over a year," Laura Wil
son, chief of the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety, wrote to The
Daily in an e-mail."But, as is the case
with many events, the actual details
continue to change right up until the
last minute. We will have a combina
tion of sworn and non-sworn securi
ty personnel present, as well as traffic
control officers."
The Dalai Lama has visited the
Bay Area numerous times and was
last at Stanford in the "mid-90s" ac
cording to Scotty McLennan, the
dean for Religious Life.
"There were letters sent by myself
and by the dean of the Medical
School about four years ago,"
McLennan said, describing the
process required to bring the Dalai
Lama to Stanford."He replied a year
ago saying he would be glad to do it."
He cited TenzinTethong. a guest lec
turer in Tibetan studies at Stanford
and a representative of the Dalai
Lama in the U.S., as an instrumental
figure in bringing the religious leader
to campus.
The Dalai Lama is "one of the
foremost spiritual leaders in the
world, so it's a great honor to have
him at Stanford," McLennan added.
"His interests and involvements are
so diverse. It's a very rich palette he's
writing on."
Students have responded to the
arrival of the Dalai Lama on campus
in diverse ways. Sophomore Sheva
Diagne and her friend, sophomore
Claire Wernecke, threw a "Dalai
Lamas and Hoochie Mamas" party
last night to celebrate.
"When we heard he was coming
last year," Diagne toldThe Daily,"we
said,"We should throw a party.' And
then we just did."
The party featured Dalai Lama
drinks, comprised of vanilla chai,
vanilla vodka, hazelnut liqueur and
chocolate syrup.
The events will be Webcast live

last at Stanford in the "mid-90s" ac
cording to Scotty McLennan, the
dean for Religious Life.
"There were letters sent by myself
and by the dean of the Medical
School about four years ago,"
McLennan said, describing the
process required to bring the Dalai
Lama to Stanford."He replied a year
ago saying he would be glad to do it."
He cited TenzinTethong. a guest lec
turer in Tibetan studies at Stanford
and a representative of the Dalai
Lama in the U.S., as an instrumental
figure in bringing the religious leader
to campus.
The Dalai Lama is "one of the
foremost spiritual leaders in the
world, so it's a great honor to have
him at Stanford," McLennan added.
"His interests and involvements are
so diverse. It's a very rich palette he's
writing on."
Students have responded to the
arrival of the Dalai Lama on campus
in diverse ways. Sophomore Sheva
Diagne and her friend, sophomore
Claire Wernecke, threw a "Dalai
Lamas and Hoochie Mamas" party
last night to celebrate.
"When we heard he was coming
last year," Diagne toldThe Daily,"we
said,"We should throw a party.' And
then we just did."
The party featured Dalai Lama
drinks, comprised of vanilla chai,
vanilla vodka, hazelnut liqueur and
chocolate syrup.
The events will be Webcast live
