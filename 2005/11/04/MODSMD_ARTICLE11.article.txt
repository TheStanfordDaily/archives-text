### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO DESK EDITOR 
Today marks the second day of the three-day Islamic hol
iday Eid ul-Fitr, which celebrates the end of Ramadan, the
Muslim holy month during which individuals fast from sun
rise to sunset.
According to junior Omar Shakir, the president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Network (MSAN), the breaking
of the fasting period is a culmination of all the self-reflection
that occurs during Ramadan.
"Ramadan gives us the opportunity to refocus on our spir
ituality and to remind ourselves of the plight of the less for
tunate and the suffering here in our community and across
the world." Shakir said.
Junior Shelley Cheung agreed, adding that Eid is "a way
for us to reflect on what we've done and what changes we've
gone through."
According to electrical engineering doctoral student
Mehdi Javanmard. the president of the Islamic Society of
Stanford University (ISSU), Eid ul-Fitr is one of the two
biggest holidays of the Islamic year.
"For most Muslims, it's the same way Christmas is for
Christians and Hannukah is for the Jewish community," Ja
vanmard said. •
The ISSU will be holding a banquet in the Oak Lounge of
Tresidder Union tonight to celebrate as a community in the
end of the fast and all of its significance. Additionally, the
ISSU organized rides to the local mosque, so that students
and their families can pray early in the morning during the
holiday.
"The sense of community is never as heightened as it is in
this month." said sophomore Sanah Parvez, the treasurer of
the ISSU, in an e-mail to The Daily. Muslim students empha
sized that Eid is a time for relaxation and spiritual celebration.
"Eid is a time to celebrate after a month of fasting and
spiritual devotion, and to spend time with family and
friends." said Shakir, whose aunts and uncles are all in town
for the holiday.
"We just have fun and chill," Cheung said. "Most of us
don't go to classes."
