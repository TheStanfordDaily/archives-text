Chicken Ranch
452 University Ave, Palo Alto
Entrees from $6.95 to 8.95

We're on a quest for cheaper, more
casual restaurants, and our search
lands us right next to Borders on
University Avenue.
Chicken Ranch, which opened three
months ago, showcases bright colors, rotis
serie chicken and other comfort foods.
We walk into the tiny restaurant and look
around. It's a quiet Tbesday night, but there
are a few diners absorbed in their meals. We
try to take it all in.
"How would you describe this place?" I
ask.
"Chicken-y?" suggests Adam.
The decor is McDonald's meets a chil
dren's playroom. Aqua-colored ceilings with
teal accents crown bright yellow walls. A
stenciled chicken border adds to the deli
cum-Disneyland feel.
We walk up to the counter and order our
food. Chicken Ranch specializes in wood
fired rotisserie chickens. Right behind the
counter, the savory-looking birds are turning
on a spit.
The menu is based on poultry. There are
chicken salads, chicken wraps, chicken sand
wiches, chicken cordon blue and chicken pot
pie. If you're looking to prove your man
hood, order one-quarter or one-half of a
chicken, with or without jerk sauce. The
menu also boasts barbecue ribs.
Complement your chicken-of-choice
with a tasty cold or hot side dish. Classics
range from coleslaw and potato salad to
onion rings and buttermilk mashed potatoes.
"I don't think this restaurant knows what
it wants to be," Adam says, and I understand
what he means.
First of all, the restaurant's classification
is elusive. Is it comfort food? Is its genre ro
tisserie? Is chickena genre? Chicken Ranch
looks like a Subway restaurant, but serves
wine and beer. The speed of the service is
halfway between fast food and sit-down din
ing. You have to pick up your own utensils,
but food is brought out to your table. Chick
en Ranch, like a gangly adolescent, is still
growing into its identity. Despite that, its
food is surprisingly satisfying.
Betsy likes the chicken pot pie and Debz
likes the chicken caesar wrap. The cheesy
pasta, unfortunately, is sub-par — it's even
further from "pasta" than Easy Mac. Howev
er, the buttermilk mashed potatoes make up
for it. They're buttery, smooth and just the
right texture.
Despite its wholesome food and setting,
the restaurant's name may have question
able origins. The first hit for "chicken
ranch" on Google is the Web site of a broth
el — "The Chicken Ranch," located just
outside Las Vegas. I wonder if the employ
ees here know that. Did the other diners
Google "chicken ranch"? Is this a market
ing strategy?
I'm considering this while I munch my Ja
maican-style jerk chicken wrap. It's tasty and
has just the right amount of spice.
"What are you eating?" Adam asks.
"The double derivative of a chicken
wrap," I say.
"Wait, isn't it the triple derivative?"
Adam says after he stops laughing.
"Um, it's the double derivative of chick
en," I say, backtracking quickly.
"So, chicken is the derivative of posi
tion?"
"Uh, yeah, basically."
According to my research. Chicken
Ranch is owned by the same person who
started Gyros Gyros up the street.The menu
claims that rotisserie chicken, like gyros, is
typically Mediterranean/'dating back to the
times when nomadic people learned to roast
their meat over the campfires." Now I'm
even more confused as to how to categorize
the restaurant. A Mediterranean RFC?
Despite its identity crisis, I would still go
back to Chicken Ranch fora quick lunch or
a casual dinner. My only complaint is that the
scents from the wood-fired rotisserie left us
smelling something like a campfire. But, I
guess it's just part of the experience.
The verdict:
When every place on University seems
overpriced and overdone. Chicken Ranch is
a solid alternative. Pop in fora satisfying bite
at a reasonable price.
