# Old Hollywood Revived
## Golden Walls House Silver Screen 
### AMIN EL GAMAL 
A spotlight hits the aging starlet as she
makes her way down the crimson-carpeted
theater aisle, an organ playing triumphantly
in the background. The celluloid rolls and
the dazzled audience shuffles in anticipation
of the star's reaction to her film. No mind
that the starlet is just a step from senility —
her image on screen revives her inner-youth.
In a world of generic multi-complex
movie theaters, amazingly expensive ticket
prices for not-so-amazing films and popcorn
with enough butter to fill Joan Rivers' vis
age, such a fulfilling movie-going experience
seems something one can only dream of.
Luckily, one need not dream further than
221 University Ave., home of the chicly nos
talgic Stanford Theatre for more than 75
years.
"There is nothing like the atmosphere at
the Stanford." says sophomore Ann Lucena.
"The ticket stubs are old-fashioned and the
entrance is gorgeous and truly unique.There
is something so charming about the organist
who bobs up and down on his platform while
he plays."
At its opening on June 6,1925, the Stan
ford Theater was considered one of the
finest in California, according to the now ex
tinct Palo Alto Times. But over the years,
lack of maintenance led to the theater's de
terioration. In its darkest days, peeling
posters littered the mirror-tiled floor and a
metallic chandelier sprouted from the drab
ceiling. The dilapidated movie palace need
ed a miracle.
It was then that Hewlett-Packard scion
David Packard came on the scene. After
Fred Astaire died in 1987, Packard decided
to rent the theater and play a two-week pro
gram of Astaire's films. The mini festival was
a tremendous hit — more than I,(XX) people
attended each night — and in response to
the program's success, the David and Lucille
Packard Foundation purchased the Stanford
Theater for slightly less than $2 million that
same year.
Packard began the process of painstak
ingly restoring the theater to its original
splendor. The nearly 1.500 seats were refur
bished and covered with ruby mohair, the
detailed interior was redone in its original
style and the long-gone organ was replaced
by the original "Mighty" Wurlitzer from the
famous Graumann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood. The restoration took two years
and $6 million, but the final product man
aged to recapture the luster of old Holly
wood. "During the intermission of' Gone
With the Wind,' I overheard this conversa
tion between two elderly women who were
reminiscing on when the originally movie
came out and how they had such big crushes
on Clark Gable," Lucena says."It was fasci
nating to listen to — they were reliving a
special time from their past."
Since its reopening, the theater has exclu
sively played films made between 1920 and
1970.

This weekend you can catch
the musicals "Stormy Weather"
and "Sun Valley Serenatde" —
starring Lena Home and figure
skater Sonja Henie, respectively.
The price fora double feature is
currently set at $6 general —
not the original 60-cent fare of
the opening, but still a far cry

from a trip to a multiplex venue.
Plus, there is something to be said for the
ambiance.
"There's a dimension you lose if you
don't watch [a classic movies] with an audi
ence." Packard told the Palo Alto Weekly.
Sophomore Dominique Cobb agrees.
"The first time I went to the Stanford, 1
saw 'Some Like it Hot,' and basically, it was
the most fun I've had in a movie theater in
years — I enjoyed every minute of it. I
think that watching it at the Stanford def- i
initelv plaved a huce role in that." J

The Stanford also invites old Holly
wood stars for special screenings. Past
guests have included Oscar winners
Eva Marie Saint, Jake Lemmon and
Billy Wilder, as well as director
George Sidney and actresses Sandra

Dee and Margaret O'Brian.
On such occasions, the the-

ater is transformed into an ex
citing movie palace where
stars share anecdotes and ul
timately reign again fora few
hours.

"There's a certain magic
that gets captured that one
cannot find on TV

screens," Lucena says."I
find that the best way to
really experience old
movies is to watch them
in the environment in

which they were first
shown. It's like travel
ing back in time and
it's a wonderful ex
perience."
