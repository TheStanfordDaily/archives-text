# It's a beautiful day in the (North Beach) neighborhood

Driving down El Camino, one encoun
ters incessantly repeated symbols of Califor
nia suburbia. Starbucks, Walmart Jack in the
Box, Starbucks, Target, Burger King, Star
bucks. At each stoplight, I sit in front of a flu
orescent sign marking a store that exists in
thousands of other places across the nation.
Don't get me wrong— I love one-stop
shopping. But this weekend, I crave stores
with small signs, lots of character and exten
sive history. All of these I find on a sunny
Saturday afternoon in the North Beach Dis
trict of San Francisco.
In the City by the Bay's "Little Italy," my
first stop is Cafe Trieste, famed for being the
first espresso shop on the West Coast. Found
edin 1956 by theGiottafamily.thisbohemian
hangout has more history than even the pho
tograph-lined wallscan document.The baris
tas seem to know everyone, and despite the
continuous line, they still find time to spark
conversation with their customersand fill lo
cals in on the daily gossip.
Bring your work to Cafe Trieste as an al
ternative to the monotony of Starbucks and
the CoHo. An old hangout frequented by
the Beat poets, the tables are crammed with
writers clutching laptops and staring
blankly at the wall in front of them. The
jukebox plays big-band favorites and peo
ple on dates chat under Italian flags. The

espresso shop stays true to the 1950s by only
accepting cash, but it makes up fr" the in
convenience with free wireless.
If you choose to leave your books at
home, Cafe Trieste also offers entertain
ment. On Saturdays from 1:30 p.m. to 5:00
p.m.. the shop hosts live Italian music,some
times featuring members of the Giotta fam
ily, some of whom have been performing in
Northern California since 1951. The cafe
also brings in local singers and musicians.
But hey. maybe a 1950s espresso shop
complete with a jukebox-era phone booth
doesn't have enough character for you. If
this is the case, head a few blocks downhill
to Stockton Street, where you'll come
across Victoria Pastry Co. — a 91-year-old
bakery known for its cakes.
To hear more about the shop's long-last
ing charm. I make conversation with the
bakery's unassuming vendor.
"You should check out the oven," he
tells me.
Victoria Pastry Co.'s brick oven is a land
mark on its own, filling an entire room. The
shop bakes all of its goods in this contrap
tion, including the remarkable chocolate
eclair I'm about to order.
I ask if they have any eclairs smaller than
the one in the glass case, which looks as big
as a subway sandwich.
"Nope," he answers.
My massive chocolate eclair and I then

head to Columbus Avenue, home of City
Lights — one of the most famous inde
pendent bookstores in the country. At first
glance, this hole in the wall looks like a run
down used bookstore, but its narrow stair
ways and hallways unexpectedly lead to
rooms upon rooms stocked with carefully
selected books. Famous for publishing the
works of many Beat poets. City Lights takes
pride in making unconventional literature
available to its patrons. But proceed to this
destination with caution, as you can get
stuck perusing the shelves for hours. Try to
give yourself a time limit, or you'll never
allow yourself to come back.
Between City Lights, Cafe Trieste, Victo
ria Pastry Co. and the dozens of other ob
scure places I pass, I seem farther than just
45 minutes away from El Camino. The
North Beach District is a perfect place to
get out of California's car culture, and into a
community with texture.
However, be forewarned that North
Beach's Broadway Avenue hosts not only
San Francisco's best nightclubs, but its
sketchiest ones as well. Even at four in the
afternoon, I was approached by several men
to "see what I was doing tonight." So if you
decide to enjoy the nightlife, remember
there's safety by numbers.
Otherwise, just enjoy a Saturday after
noon's nonchalance and flavor in one of San
Francisco's most precious districts.
