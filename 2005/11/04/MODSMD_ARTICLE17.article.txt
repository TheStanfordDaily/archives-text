## Editorial Redistricting should be in the hands of judges 
### 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has
often threatened to bring measures
that lack support in the Legislature
"to the people. We're critical of many of the
propositions on the ballot this year, but
Proposition 77 — which will radically
change redistricting — is an appropriate and
necessary use of the initiative process.
Every 10 years, the California Legislature
redraws legislative districts for assembly
members, state senators and Congressional
representatives. This redistricting process,
used to reflect population changes, takes
place in all states.
In California, legislators draw districts so
well that none of the 153 seats in the assembly,
state senate and Congress changed parties
last November. It might seem that lawmakers
are doing a phenomenal job of representing
their districts. Unfortunately, the reality is
that California's electoral districts have been
drawn so perfectly that almost no incumbent
faces serious electoral competition.
Prop. 77 seeks to address the problem of
legislators choosing their constituents in
stead of constituents choosing their legisla
tors. While imperfect, the initiative addresses
effectively the issue of how to redistrict fairly
— by giving the job to nonpartisan judges in
stead of legislators. We think this plan will
make elections more competitive, improve
political dialogue and end some of the cur
rent partisan gridlock in the legislature.
The proposition has an elaborate and
well-designed method of avoiding partisan
ship. It creates a panel of three retired judges
to draw all the districts in California. Judges
cannot have held partisan political offices,
have changed their party affiliation since
their judicial appointment or have received
income over the past year from specified po
litical sources. The Judicial Council, an ad
ministrative body of the court system, ran
domly selects 24 judges from the pool of all
willing, retired and qualifying judges, and
legislative leaders of the major parties then
narrow down the list. A final random selec
tion process narrows the number of judges
to three, including at least one Republican
and one Democrat.
This panel of judges draws the bound
aries for legislative districts with input from
the legislature, the governor and the public.
In the end, the panel releases a unanimously
agreed-upon redistricting plan that is used
for the next statewide election. Voters would
then get a chance to vote on the new districts.
If they rejected the plan, the process would
begin again for the next election cycle.
Despite our strong endorsement, we have
a few reservations. We are concerned that
electoral districts will be too frequently re
drawn, possibly disrupting representative
constituency relations. Prop. 77 will also re
quire an immediate redistricting, which is
neither essential nor productive and only

PROPOSITION 77
Redistricting

WHAT IT IS: Transfers the drawing
of legislative districts from
lawmakers to a panel of judges.
WHAT THEY SAY: Effort to redistrict
next year is a power grab by
Republicans.
WHAT WE SAY: This bipartisan
effort has the potential to make
California politics more
representative and less partisan.

fuels some Democrats' contention that this
bill is a Republican power grab, an assertion
we do not believe. Lastly, we wish that this
proposal were part of a nationwide drive to
create nonpartisan redistricting bodies in
stead of just a California movement.
But these reservations should not de
crease support for the measure. Current leg
islators fear and oppose the measure be
cause it may do exactly what it is supposed
to: make races more competitive. Democrats
worry that Prop. 77 will cut their Congres
sional majority, much as redistricting did in
Texas. But this conclusion is far from certain
as no one knows what will happen with new
districts. And Democrats who oppose this
measure are being short-sighted. They are
ignoring the precedent that California could
set, which would benefit democratic dia
logue (and Democrats) throughout the
country, and they are assuming that the cur
rent political balance will last indefinitely.
Despite a few concerns, we believe that
Proposition 77 will improve representation
and district competitiveness, and will reduce
the influence of legislators in choosing their
own constituents. We urge a "yes" vote on
Prop. 77.
