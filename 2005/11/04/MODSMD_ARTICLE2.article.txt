# A
						MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE
## Cardinal travel to Los Angeles to take on USC 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford better bring its slingshot to Los Angeles tomor
row because the Cardinal look to be the David battling the
21st century's Goliath in No. 1 Southern California.
The nationally-broadcasted 7 p.m. contest marks the
teams' 84th meeting, and USC (8-0, 5-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) has won 56 of the games against its oldest rival. Despite
the lopsided series history, last year's game came down to the
wire, with USC scoring the go-ahead touchdown in the
fourth quarter and hanging on fora 31-28 victory at Stanford.
That three-point victory is just one of many good results
over the past three years, as the Trojans have won 30 straight
games. Now USC is just five victories away from a third
straight national crown. USC has also won a school-record

24 straight home
games, with Stanford's
2001 21-16 victory
standing as the last
TVojan loss at LA Col
iseum.
USC's recent
dominance starts with
an offense that has a
habit of turning old
record books into little
more than paper
weights. Behind a stel
lar line that USC head
coach Pete Carroll
calls the best in his five
years in LA, the of
fense leads the nation
with an average of
over 600 yards per
game. The unit is on
pace to become the
first-ever with a 3,000-
yard passer and a pair
of 1,000-yard rushers
and receivers.
"[USC] is one of
the most outstanding
teams that I've been
able to watch." said
Stanford head coach
Walt Harris, a long
time friend and for
mer position coach of
Carroll. "They are po
tent like maybe no
other team I have
ever seen."

After opting out of the NFL draft last winter, senior quar
terback Matt Leinart guides the offense for the third
straight season. This year, the defending Heisman Trophy
winner garners praise for his decision-making and offensive
knowledge.
"1 think [Leinart] is playing as good as any college quar
terback that 1 have seen," Harris said. "They have a very in
volved offense; they have motion and shift multiple forma
tions. They do everything and he handles it tremendously."
USC's tailbacks form the best one-two punch in the na
tion, as at least one of the backs has scored in each of USC's
last 32 contests. While junior LenDale White (946 yards, 13
TD) has received more carries, it is junior Reggie Bush
(1,568 yards, 13 TDs) who many analysts believe leads the
race for both this year's Heisman and the top pick in next
year's NFL Draft.
For Stanford (4-3,3-2 Pac-10 Conference), 34-point un
derdogs, one reason for hope is a retooled USC defense that
features only five returning starters from last season. How
ever, a Cardinal defense that allowed four consecutive late
game touchdowns in an overtime loss to UCLA still needs

to tighten.
Though many suggested that a let-up on defense led to
last week's collapse, Harris argues the opposite.
"I don't think we relaxed," Harris said. "It might possibly
have been the other way â€” we restricted. When we get into
the two-minute drill, we have not got it done. I think that we
get worn down in the fourth quarter and are unable to
mount a pass rush, and then 1 think we get a little frustrated
and we try to do too much. We have been giving up the big
play."
Harris added that he would glean no moral victories from
the narrow defeat.
"I was excited that we could play to that level, but all the
hard work doesn't matter," he said. "We're not in it to play
well and lose. We're in it to win. Stanford wins. It wins in al
most every other sport."
This weekend, Harris is eager for another chance at a vic
tory.
"We have a chance to play, in my opinion, the best team

Junior tight end Michael Horgan and the Cardinal have a huge CHALLENGE this weekend, taking on No. 1 USC on the
road. The Trojans have won 30 consecutive games.
