# The 						daily athlete routine and its hiatus
## 
### 
Atypical day in the life of an athlete:
5:58 a.m.: Wake up early (and when
we say early, we don't mean "up in
time to get coffee before 9 a.m. class" early,or
even "up with the sun" early... We mean,"still
dark, and the only people awake at this hour
are sex fiends on the walk of shame, CS
fiends leaving Meyer, and the guy who drives
the bagel truck" early).
6:20: Weights (If we're dealing with lucky
athletes, weights are in a shiny, well-lit gym in
a cozy corner of Arrillaga. If we're dealing
with not-so-lucky athletes, weights happen in
an unheated metal shack on the far side of
the football practice field. Some of the equip
ment is in a fenced-in yard, through which it's
possible to catch the motivational image of
football field frost gleaming in early morning
moonlight).
7:40: Team meeting.
8:40: Run home for five minutes of break
fast. Consider showering. Consider changing
out of dirty sweats. Do neither. Instead, check
the Facebook to see if anyone poked you last
night.
9:05: Get to class late. Attempt unsuccess
fully to get to the one empty seat left in the
middle of the second row without the profes
sor noticing. Ignore his "I hate jocks" glare
while making an inordinate amount of noise
taking your pen and paper out of your back
pack.
10:00: Practice. 'Nuff said.
1:15: Class and lunch. Offend your section
mates by not bringing enough PB and J to go
around. Your wet hair causes them to wonder
why you shower at such odd hours of the af
ternoon. (Little do they know, you haven't
showered in weeks... it's fine... chlorine kills

everything anyway, doesn't it?)
And so on
This stuff usually continues 'til around 9
p.m., at which time you collapse at your desk
and drool while trying not to think about the
problem set due the next morning.
At times this causes problems. Hey, if you
always move at breakneck speeds, eventual
ly you run the risk of breaking your neck.
Most athletes around here have been injured
in the line of duty at least once or twice, and
that's not even counting random sickness,
bike accidents and squirrel bites. This brings
us to the question: What happens to an ath
lete who, for whatever reason, finds himself
on the disabled list?
This week, Kevin accidentally signed on
to research the preceding question by con
tracting a highly contagious illness. Kevin's
sickly state kept him out of the weight room
for fear of passing on his debilitating disease
to fellow athletes. What should he do? Where
should he go? Panic set in, autopilot took
over, and he found himself wide-awake at 6
a.m.. fully dressed in his sweats and trying
desperately to dead-lift his roommate. (His
roommate incidentally, didn't seem to mind
being lifted. It wasn't until they got to the "let
roommate fall crashing to the floor from eye

level" part of the lift that roommate became
unhappy with the situation.)
Thirty-five minutes and one enlightening
conversation later, Kevin was still not quite
convinced that sleep would he a better choice
at the moment than attempting tricep dips on
his desk chair.
Yeah, you'd really be surprised at the
force and speed at which withdrawal sets in
for athletes.Take away our sport and what do
we have left? Our rugged good looks and
first-rate Stanford education? Well maybe
the situation isn't that sad. but still... take our
word for it, it's no picnic. Going to an athlete
and telling her she can't play is like going to
Chi Theta Chi and telling them they're no
longer allowed to have group showers; or
going to Terra and banning Madonna and
Culture Club;or going to Wilbur and banning
dormcest. Go ahead. Try it. Bad things will
happen.
The point is that no matter how you look
at it, we all have a passion somewhere in our
lives. For some it's a sport, for others it takes
on other forms: art. music, writing or Star
Trek: Deep Space Nine. We may not let it dic
tate who we are or define our lives, but we
sure are willing to make sacrifices to do it. So
if you find yourself in a place where you can
do what you love every day of the week, take
a moment to appreciate what an incredible
privilege that is...and another to wish Kevin a
speedy recovery.

Kevin's not allowed to have "eyeball to eyeball"
contact with anybody fora week or two, but
we re pretty sure that you can't transfer pinkeye
through e-mail. Send us messages at km
clean@stanford.edu and ckrug@stanford.edu.
