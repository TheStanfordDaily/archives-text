# The 						cure for the mid-quarter slump
## 
### 
We blame the whole thing on Day
light Savings Time. You look away
for just a moment, and when you
look back the quarter is instantly half-over.
We've dropped some classes that we were so
excited about in September. And all the
other courses that tickled our fancy have
faded with age. Reading has become a chore.
AH the days between now and Christmas
begin to look very, very short. It must be the
winter light.
It's the anatomy of the mid-quarter
slump. In the past, we've tried to cure our
selves with tea and blind drive to get good
recommendations. This year, we sought our
cure elsewhere: in the misery of others. By
visiting classes in which we had no stake, we
could comfort ourselves in the enveloping,
warm-sounding, foreign vocabulary of engi
neering or economics. Nothing makes you
feel content with your own burden of work
quite like watching 10() other people take a
midterm on cellular neuroscience that you
don't have to.
So we picked out what seemed to us the
class that was furthest from anything we
might understand and blithely showed up at

the door. "Excuse me is this ME 463 Ad
vanced Topics in Plasma Science and Engi
neering?" "Ummm...yes, but I think lecture
doesn't meet today." Thwarted, we conjec
tured that plasma could be a phase of mat
ter, but it could also be, well, blood. Perhaps
they sensed us coming and moved their
vampirical activities elsewhere.
Stymied in our quest for sadism, we wan
dered into a lecture hall, only to find Imper
fect Competition just getting started. A girl
in the back row clued us in to the class."Econ
157. The one taught by the famous profes
sor." When pressed, she couldn't remember
his name. As we sat down, the girl turned to
us with a look of terror on her face, as if sit
ting through this class was the worst punish

ment imaginable for her day-after-Hal
loween hangover. "You really don't want to
be here," she informed us politely.
We backed away, intimidated and not a
little scared. Maybe this wasn't the cure we
wanted. We were looking for something to
distract us, or something to remind us that all
that slogging back and forth from class was
not in vain.
To the library! That's where we find hope
and succor. Where else can you battle aliens
on an Xbox in the same room with the entire
history of the United States on microfiche?
Wandering about in a stupor, we slowly
climbed the stairs in the West Stacks. We
furtively passed researchers, eyeing each
other guiltily.The click of the motion-sensor
activated lights marked our passage. That
signature smell of acid eating through cheap
paper enveloped us.
We know these corridors so well. But
today, climbing up the half stairs of each
floor, there was something new. Like that
moment in a dream, when you find a new
room in a house you have known for years.
There's a new floor in the Bing Wing. West
Stacks 7.

For now it's just shelves. Forty rows of
shelves, clean and primary colored. Empty
of books or people or helpful call number
guides. It feels like a ghost library. All those
empty bookshelves waiting for new ideas to
be conceived, new data collected, new legis
latures convened and documented, new
poems written, new poems denounced in
fiery criticism. And all those things would
find their way to this empty floor.
Perhaps the terrified girl in Imperfect
Competition will one day find her wildly
successful treatise occupying space on these
now empty shelves. Bing Wing 7 will eventu
ally be the dungeon for our dead minds, just
as the rest of the library harbors the spirits of
generations of dead intellectuals before us.
Our zombie ideas will never be allowed to
die, living on these shelves like coffins, invis
ible to all but the most determined re
searchers. And these unopened books will
be the only tangible evidence of our lives.

We're planning a conceptual art experience in
West Stacks 7. For ticketing information please
