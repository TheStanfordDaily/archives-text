Traffic blocking counterproductive
While The Daily did a nice job of describing the
agenda of the hospital protesters with an entire ar
ticle about why they were protesting. The Daily
failed to report on the huge inconvenience these
protesters caused for hundreds of people who have
nothing to do with their grievances.
The protesters took over the intersection of
Campus Drive and Palm Drive at 5 p.m., which
backed up traffic at the height of rush hour and
caused all of us on the Marguerite to miss our trains.
Of course, raising awareness through inconven
ience was the point of this protest, but I'm pretty
sure that angering commuters is not going to pro
mote their agenda.
Shouldn't ITie Daily's ''article" have been la
beled an editorial? Not only was this protest ill-de
signed and probably illegal, but extensive press in
The Daily was inappropriate. While I'm all for
workers' rights, now I'm wondering who these self
ish people really are. Protesters: you raised my
awareness by inconveniencing me. and you created
an opponent to your agenda. You might want to re
think your strategies.
