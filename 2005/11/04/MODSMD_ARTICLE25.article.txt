# THE 						FORECAST
## 
### 
USC has one of the best offensive units in the
country, led by Reggie Rush, LenDale White and
Matt Leinart. The Trojans are putting up nearly
50 points per game. The Cardinal must find some
way to slow down the offensive machine if they
have any chance of pulling off the upset.
