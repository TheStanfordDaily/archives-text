# Water polo with a third chance against No. 1 USC
## Cardinal get another shot at USC after losing twice to the Trojans 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
As the members of the No. 3 Stan
ford men's water polo team head to
Los Angeles, they carry with them
the hope that the cliche "third time's
a charm" rings true this weekend as
they take on top-ranked Southern
California and No. 6 UC-lrvine.
The Cardinal (15-3,4-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) have
squared off against the Trojans twice
this season, and both times they have
come up just one goal short, losing by
scores of 6-5 and 10-9.
But tomorrow is the first time the

two teams meet in conference play,
and the Cardinal have full confi
dence in their ability to turn the ta
bles on the rival USC squad.
"[They're] ranked No. 1 and [have]
beaten us twice this season," sopho
more two-meter defender Peter Fin
layson said."They got us in the finals at
the SoCal Open tournament and in the
semifinals at the NorCal tournament
before going on to win, so it would be
great to avenge those losses."
Finlayson and the rest of the Car
dinal defense know that they have a
tough assignment in the Trojans,
whose offensive firepower revolves
around senior two-meter defender
Juraj Zatovic and junior drivers Juan
Delgadillo and TTiomas Hale. Del
gadillo has proved himself a particu
larly difficult mark to handle, scoring
the game winning goal for the Tro
jans in the SoCal title game and
notching a hat-trick against the Car-

dinal at the NorCal tournament.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal intend
to approach the match in signature
fashion — with extra emphasis on
creating offensive opportunities off
of defensive stands.
"Everything is generated from
our defense," junior two-meter de
fender J.J. Carton said. "Our defense

is the primary part of our game,
whether we're up or down. We al
ways have our game plan and our
style of play and we want to make
other teams adapt to our style."

sive two-game set against No. 4
UCLA and No. 5 Pepperdine last
weekend. The Cardinal came back
from three goals down to beat the
Bruins in overtime, and then battled
to an 11 -9 victory over the Waves the
next day. And according to sopho
more two-meter Michael Bury,
whose hat-trick performance keyed
the Cardinal comeback over
UCLA, those two victories exempli
fy the standard to which the team
holds itself.
"Our wins last weekend just give
us more confidence and show what a
tough team we are," he said. "To be
down three goals going into the
fourth [period] and coming away with
a win really proves that we never give
up and will always fight to the end."
Head coach John Vargas' defense
against the six-on-five advantage
stood out as a particular highlight in
the Cardinal's two dramatic wins
and proved to be a critical factor in
both games. It also served as a fur
ther testament to the team's ability
to play as a cohesive unit.
"We pride ourselves on [our
man-down defense] because it
shows heart and toughness to be
able to shut down a team even when
you're outnumbered," Finlayson
said."lf we continue to play solid de
fense and play smart team ball on of
fense, we can't be beat. Coach likes
to talk about 'winning every posses
sion' — using the clock, working for
match-ups that are beneficial for us
and making sure we don't give our
opponent any goals. We all know our
roles, and when we all do what's ex
pected of us, we win."
It is exactly that combination of
tenacious attitude and effective
game planning that leaves the Car
dinal well prepared to take on any
opponent in the league.
"We are excited to have this
chance to go down to L.A. and play
good Stanford water polo," Fin
layson said. "We've been watching a
lot of tape this week to get an idea of
what these guys do and what some
of their tendencies are. So we feel
that if we go down there, stick to
coach's game-plans and play good
team ball, we can get back up here
with two more wins under our belt."
