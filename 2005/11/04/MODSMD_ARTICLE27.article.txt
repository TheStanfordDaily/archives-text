# Water polo with a third chance against No. 1 USC
## Cardinal get another shot at USC after losing twice to the Trojans 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
As the members of the No. 3 Stan
ford men's water polo team head to
Los Angeles, they carry with them
the hope that the cliche "third time's
a charm" rings true this weekend as
they take on top-ranked Southern
California and No. 6 UC-lrvine.
The Cardinal (15-3,4-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) have
squared off against the Trojans twice
this season, and both times they have
come up just one goal short, losing by
scores of 6-5 and 10-9.
But tomorrow is the first time the

two teams meet in conference play,
and the Cardinal have full confi
dence in their ability to turn the ta
bles on the rival USC squad.
"[They're] ranked No. 1 and [have]
beaten us twice this season," sopho
more two-meter defender Peter Fin
layson said."They got us in the finals at
the SoCal Open tournament and in the
semifinals at the NorCal tournament
before going on to win, so it would be
great to avenge those losses."
Finlayson and the rest of the Car
dinal defense know that they have a
tough assignment in the Trojans,
whose offensive firepower revolves
around senior two-meter defender
Juraj Zatovic and junior drivers Juan
Delgadillo and TTiomas Hale. Del
gadillo has proved himself a particu
larly difficult mark to handle, scoring
the game winning goal for the Tro
jans in the SoCal title game and
notching a hat-trick against the Car-

Nevertheless, the Cardinal intend
to approach the match in signature
fashion â€” with extra emphasis on
creating offensive opportunities off
of defensive stands.
"Everything is generated from
our defense," junior two-meter de
fender J.J. Carton said. "Our defense

other teams adapt to our style."
The Stanford squad seems primed
