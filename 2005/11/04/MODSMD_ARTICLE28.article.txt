onships, which began yesterday.
The decorated Cardinal have a long-standing record
of success at the highly competitive tournament,clinch
ing six singles titles since its inception in 1984. Stanford
won four of these in a row between 1998 and 2(X)1 .Now
after a recent lapse, Stanford is out to repeat its once
famed success.

those of Logar (5-2), who is the No. 8 seed at the event.
Yesterday, at the Ohio State-hosted affair, Logar
kicked off her Indoor run with a three-set upset of
Southern California's Anca Anastasiu, 6-1,4-6,6-1.
It was the fourth meeting between Logar and her
Lady Trojan opponent. Logar, a junior, currently leads
the head-to-head race, 3-1. Logar is ranked at No. 13 in
the nation after reaching the finals of the Stanford
hosted ITA Northwest Regional Championship.
For junior Anne Yelsey, things have gotten off to a
rockier start at the Indoor. Making her first appearance
there, Yelsey fell to Georgia Tech's Kristi Miller after a
three-set battle, 3-6,7-5,6-3.
"It was definitely one of those matches where we
both played really well at times." Yelsey said. "Then it
was five-all in the second set, and she was serving. I had
one break point and I didn't really capitalize on it."
Miller has enjoyed a busy and successful individual
season, already boasting a 9-1 record. She captured her
second career individual title at the ITA South Region
al Championships last month and also reached the
quarterfinals at All-American before deferring to
Texas Christian's Nicole Leimbach. who is ranked at
No. 3 in the nation.
In light of her early exit, Yelsey considers her missed
Indoor opportunity a learning experience.
"The tournament's just another chance for us to see
a varied kind of competition out there and get some
match practice," she said.
Yelsey still has a chance in doubles, where she teamed
up with Barnes to get the best of Northwestern s
Cristelle Grier and Alexis Prousis, 8-6. Together, Barnes
