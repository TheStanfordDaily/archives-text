## The
						rough and tumble life of a varsity athlete 
### 
Ahh, the life of a varsity athlete. We've all
heard about the great treatment and won
derful opportunities afforded to the athleti
cally gifted among us. Elite status on campus, access
to premiere facilities, world class trainers and serv
ices, travel to exotic and exciting places ...
Well, two of three ain't bad. As a broadcaster for
KZSU radio I occasionally have the privilege of
traveling with our No. 4 women's volleyball team,
who this weekend has the distinct pleasure of play
ing Washington in sunny Seattle and Washington
State in picturesque downtown Pullman. Stick with
me as I take you on a journey through the life of a
traveling athlete.
The first thing to note is that when leaving fora
game, it's at least a full day before one plays. Think
about it: have you ever seen a football player on
campus the Friday before an away game? The teams
all leave the day before so they can have a day to de
compress from travel.
And by decompress, I mean practice to tune up
for the upcoming match. The volleyball team ar
rived in Seattle at 9 p.m. Wednesday, and by 9 a.m.
the next day everyone was gathered in one hotel
room, watching film and talking strategy. Before a 7
p.m. game that night, there was a warm-up, a serve
and-pass session and then an immediate pregame
tune up. Sounds relaxing, no?
"But, come on!" you might say. "I'd rather be
watching film, stretching and playing around than
going to class any day of the week." If only it were
that simple. Classes don't take a backseat when we're
out on the road. Instead, they're along for the ride, as
most players travel with backpacks full of books,
computers and notes to keep pace with those lucky
enough able to attend lectures. Two players had a
midterm Wednesday night, which was faxed to the
hotel and was administered as soon as we were set
tled â€” so, we're going to play a 5-1 offense against
Washington tomorrow, and don't forget that sulfate's
oxidation number is negative two and displays a
tetrahedral hybridization around the central atom.
Travel and work aside, there's actual life on the
road. How sweet it is to flop down on huge, plush
hotel beds and catch up on the sleep deprivation
that the rest of campus feels as well; enjoy those
seven hours and then get out of bed and off to the
film room.
We landed at 9 p.m. and got to the hotel by 10:30
p.m. Even if we fall asleep by midnight, we're lucky
to get the full eight hours. And don't even think
about it if we change time zones. Try getting eight
full hours of sleep when you start in Stanford and
play in Florida the next day.
"But you guys get to go to some really awesome
places!" Ooh. the glitz and glamour of downtown
Seattle. Welcome to the home of Starbucks, grunge
music and suicide weather. After touching down
