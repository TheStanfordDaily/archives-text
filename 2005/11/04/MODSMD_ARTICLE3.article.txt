# Frank makes a tough switch look easy
## Nose tackle turned fullback is having an immediate impact 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Compared to his first two years at Stanford,
getting ready for No. 1 Southern California this
season has been very a different experience for
junior fullback Nick Frank.
Instead of trying to figure out how to stop
the Trojan's tandem of Reggie Bush and
LenDale White as a reserve nose tackle, Frank
is studying blocking patterns, pass protections
and running lanes as the Cardinal's starting
fullback.
Frank lettered at nose tackle his first two
seasons on the Farm, playing in all but one
game. But once head coach Walt Harris arrived
at Stanford, a decision during the winter condi
tioning program moved Frank to the offensive
side of the ball.
"I think it was pretty early on when Coach
Harris came in and was trying to evaluate our
personnel and where we needed bodies," Frank
said. "At the time we were kind of thin at the
fullback position, so it was a concern for Coach.
I was pretty undersized for the position I was
playing and so I decided to make the switch."
Frank has made the difficult transition from
defense to offense look effortless at times this
season, rushing for 114 yards on 33 carries, most
coming in short yardage situations. He also
leads the team in rushing touchdowns with
three on the season.
However, most of Frank's duties consist of
protecting quarterback Trent Edwards and act

"Our last couple games we needed some
short yardage type of running, and 1 was able to
help with that," Frank said. "For the most part,
I like to think that I'm there to protect our OB
and protect for the guys running behind me."
Frank has been forced to adopt an entirely
new attitude towards the game since making
the shift. The switch hasn't always been easy,
given that he had never played offense coming
into the season. Frank, unlike many Stanford
players, wasn't a two-way player in high school.
"It was definitely a rough transition at first,"
Frank said. "Offense is more about being in the
right position â€” knowing where we're going to
run the ball or throw the ball and how everv-
