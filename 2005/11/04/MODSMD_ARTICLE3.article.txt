# Frank makes a tough switch look easy
## Nose tackle turned fullback is having an immediate impact 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Compared to his first two years at Stanford,
getting ready for No. 1 Southern California this
season has been very a different experience for
junior fullback Nick Frank.
Instead of trying to figure out how to stop
the Trojan's tandem of Reggie Bush and
LenDale White as a reserve nose tackle, Frank
is studying blocking patterns, pass protections
and running lanes as the Cardinal's starting
fullback.
Frank lettered at nose tackle his first two
seasons on the Farm, playing in all but one
game. But once head coach Walt Harris arrived
at Stanford, a decision during the winter condi
tioning program moved Frank to the offensive
side of the ball.
"I think it was pretty early on when Coach
Harris came in and was trying to evaluate our
personnel and where we needed bodies," Frank
said. "At the time we were kind of thin at the
fullback position, so it was a concern for Coach.
I was pretty undersized for the position I was
playing and so I decided to make the switch."
Frank has made the difficult transition from
defense to offense look effortless at times this
season, rushing for 114 yards on 33 carries, most
coming in short yardage situations. He also
leads the team in rushing touchdowns with
three on the season.
However, most of Frank's duties consist of
protecting quarterback Trent Edwards and act
ing as lead blocker on running plays.
"Our last couple games we needed some
short yardage type of running, and 1 was able to
help with that," Frank said. "For the most part,
I like to think that I'm there to protect our OB
and protect for the guys running behind me."
Frank has been forced to adopt an entirely
new attitude towards the game since making
the shift. The switch hasn't always been easy,
given that he had never played offense coming
into the season. Frank, unlike many Stanford
players, wasn't a two-way player in high school.
"It was definitely a rough transition at first,"
Frank said. "Offense is more about being in the
right position — knowing where we're going to
run the ball or throw the ball and how everv-
Frank playing a critical role in Cardinal offense

thing is supposed to fit. Defense is a
little more about being relentless.
That was different for me, and Coach
had to explain to me quite a few
times in the beginning that 1 had to
just do my job as we drew it up and
not try to make something happen
every play."
Frank's defensive experience may
have slowed his progress at first, but
now he can use his knowledge of the
defensive mindset to his advantage.
"I like to think that my work on
the defensive line gives me a better
idea of how defenders are going to
take on my block," Frank said. "Es
pecially in the passing game, I have a
good sense of what those guys are
going to try to do to get to the pass
er."
In addition, his size has been an
advantage out of the backfield, creat
ing good holes for the running backs
and allowing him to pick up critical
yardage in short-distance situations.
Frank may have been undersized as a
nose tackle at 6-foot-2 and 260
pounds, but as a fullback he provides
a very large body.
This was evident last weekend
against UCLA, when Frank led the
team in rushing, picking up 61 yards
on 13 carries and one score. He also
caught two balls out of the backfield
for 16 yards.
"I think Nick really stepped up as
a runner, and I don't think they want
ed to tackle him," Harris said this
week's press conference. "There
were some guys that felt like i won't
hit him very hard because he will hit

me back.'"
No one would have predicted this
performance a year ago, but the signs
of Frank's future success on offense
were evident early after the switch.
Frank was named one of two "Most
Improved" offensive players by Har
ris following the Spring Game.
"It took a lot of time [making the
transition], but early in training
camp, both of our other fullbacks
were injured and that threw me in
the mix right away," Frank said, i
pretty much had to learn on the run a
lot."
Now that he is settling in on of
fense, it looks like Frank will contin
ue to get into the endzone.an oppor
tunity that wasn't provided to him as
a nose tackle.
"That's one of the best parts of
the game — being able to score
touchdowns," Frank said. "Having it
happen a few times this year, it's def
initely pretty cool especially coming
from nose tackle where I rarely
touched the ball much less got it into
the endzone."
It appears that the switch has
been for the better for both Frank
and the Cardinal offense. But there
have also been some extra benefits
for the Louisiana native, including
not having to worry about stopping a
potent USC offense.
"That's a pretty big task that can
be frustrating at times,"Frank said."l
think our defense is ready for the
task, but at the same time I'm pretty
glad I don't have to go up against
those guvs."
