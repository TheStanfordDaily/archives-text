## Cardinal fall to Huskies No. 2 Washington downs the No. 4 Cardinal in three games 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In front of a large and raucous crowd in
Seattle last night, the undefeated Washing
ton Huskies proved too much for the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball team, who
fell to 20-4 overall and 9-3 in conference
play with the three-game sweep.
The Huskies (21-0,12-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) confirmed that they deserve their
No. 2 ranking with a 30-21,30-26,30-16 vic
tory over a Cardinal squad still reeling
from the loss of two major players in the
last two weeks. Stanford lost freshman
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza two weeks
ago, and sophomore setter Bryn Kehoe
broke her hand in practice Monday. Kehoe
had surgery earlier this week but will need
to sit out for several weeks.
"There's a chance she can play again
[this season]," head coach John Dunning
said. "We know how long it will take if the

healing process goes well. 1 know she'll
work out like crazy, and when her hand is
healed, she'll be ready to play."
The Cardinal fought hard to fill in the
holes left by their injured teammates but
could not overcome a deep and talented
Washington roster and their own unfamil
iar chemistry.
Senior Katie Goldhahn, who was the
primary setter her sophomore season, got
the start for the Cardinal and ran
the offense well, dishing out 33 as
sists and recording two kills and two
solo blocks. Sophomore Franci Gi
rard, settling into the outside hitter
position, chipped in five kills, five
digs and a solo block.
"You don't want to whine about
things, but we are playing in a lineup
that we weren't in two weeks ago,"
Dunning said. "Katie hasn't set in a
year and a half but did really well,
and Franci is doing well in her new
position. It's always tough dealing
with injuries."
With Barboza out of the lineup,
junior Kristin Richards has become
the primary offensive threat for the
Cardinal, getting more than a third
of the swings last night. She posted a
team-high 13 kills, hitting .140 for
the match.
Freshman Foluke Akinradewo
backed Richards on offense with 10
kills on .348 hitting and also tallied
three solo blocks to lead the defen
sive effort.
The Cardinal, outblocked by the
Huskies 13-7 in their previous meet
ing, played smothering defense at
the net, recording 10 blocks to
Washington's four. Akinradewo
had three solos while Richards and

Goldhahn added two apiece.
In the back row, libero Courtney
Schultz recorded a team-high 11
digs, leaving her two short of 1,000
in her career. Richards also con
tributed double-digit digs, finishing
the match with 10.
The Stanford defense, however,
was no match for Washington senior
Sanja Tomasevic who tallied a
match-high 26 kills while hitting
.548. Half of those kills came in the
first game alone, when the Cardi
nal's blockers and diggers had no
answer for her powerful swing.
The score remained close early
in the first game, with several ties
before Washington pulled ahead to
go up 15-10. The teams traded
points to keep the gap at five until
Huskies star Sanja Tomasevic
recorded a pair of kills to put the
score at 25-18. Akinradewo kept her
team in it with a pair of kills late, but
Tomasevic gave the Huskies the
game 30-21 with her 13th kill.
"In games one and two, we
played really well, and we kept even
with them." Dunning said. "There
was one streak in the first game and
one streak in the second game when
we gave up about five points, but
other than that we were playing
even with them or even a bit bet
ter."
Neither team could build a lead
larger than one in the second game
until a pair of Stanford hitting errors
put Washington up 24-21. The

Huskies came alive late in the game,
tallying three straight kills to go up
by five. Akinradewo brought the
Cardinal back with a solo stuff and a
kill, forcing the Huskies to take a
timeout leading 28-26, but Tomase
vic once again sealed the deal for the
Huskies with a kill for the 30-26 win.
In the third game, Washington
came out and quickly built a big
lead. The Cardinal built some mo
mentum late but made far too many
errors, falling behind before Wash
ington eventually took the match,
30-16, on a kill by Darla Myhre.
"In game three, we just did not
play well," Dunning said." I think it
got to us, being down two to zero, and
they came out and played relaxed."
The Cardinal next visit Washing
ton State (8-17, 1-11), whom the
Cardinal swept at home in early Oc
tober. The match should be a good
opportunity for the Cardinal to gain
some experience in their new lineup
against a weaker opponent, before
facing a hot No. 8 Arizona squad at
home next week.
"Adversity is never good for you,
but maybe we are learning things
now that we wouldn't learn other
wise," Dunning said. "First, we go to
Pullman tomorrow. We have six
Pac-10 matches left, and it's a mat
ter of going one step at a time. We
will play tomorrow and build some
confidence playing in public with
the lineup we are in and doing it
well."
