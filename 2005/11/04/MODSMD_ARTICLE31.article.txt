# CREW
## Early test for lightweight and novice teams Women's lightweight crew and men's novice crew head to Newport 
### EMILY CRAMER 
This weekend at the Newport Regatta
in Newport, Calif., Stanford crew will be
represented by two very different squads
— the lightweight women and novice men.
While the women represent Stanford's
best national finish from last season —
coming in fifth at the Intercollegiate Row
ing Association Championships — the
novice eight represent the future of Stan
ford men's crew.
The lightweights finished the Head of
the American (HOA) regatta with the
fastest time fora lightweight boat, al
though they raced in the women's varsity
event. They are also two-year winners at
the Newport Regatta. Using history as a
guide, a win this weekend would indicate
the start of another strong season.
The lightweight women return with five

seasoned rowers, most notably captains
senior Nicole Pierce, junior Meredith
Coleman (who is abroad for fall) and soph
omore Kate Hayes. Their coxswain, junior
Maia Goodman, is back after a stellar
debut season.
In addition to returning rowers, the Car
dinal will rely on the talents of three re
cruits and an athletic bunch of walk-ons.
The walk-ons look to make contributions
after intense fall and winter training ses
sions.
Among coach A1 Acosta's goals for the
season are focus on intense training and
strong boat cohesion. The lightweights'
main rivals are the top national boats from
last year — Georgetown. Princeton, Cen
tral Florida and Harvard.
After a third-place finish to California's
novice boats at HOA, the Stanford novice
men are building on their first fall head race
and have specific objectives in mind for this
weekend. Competition is not expected to
be tough — regional crews which Stanford
beat handily at HOA fill this weekends
lineup.
"We have some imperfections to work
out, and I think Newport is a great opportu

nity for us to unify as a crew and really get
the boat moving fast," freshman Mark Mur
phy said.
Murphy also added that the boat would
be working on ratio, stroke rating and boat
set in its race Sunday. The goal of ratio is to
have sufficient time on recovery in relation
to time in the water. The rower must pull
hard and quickly through the water, but
not rush back after the stroke. Murphy also
explained that the boat would try to im
prove its stroke rating, defined as the num
ber of strokes taken in a minute, from a 28
to a 30 for this weekend. The boat set, or
balance in the water, is crucial for maxi
mum speed and efficiency.
Additional adjustments for this week
end are likely; some tampering with last
weekend's boat seat lineup is a distinct
possibility. Though the boat has only one
rower who is new to the sport, the novice
fall season, in general, is an adjustment to
collegiate rowing and a chance to get rac
ing experience. Since the novice men don't
plan to attend the highly competitive Head
of the Lake regatta next weekend, this is
their final opportunity for competition be
fore the spring.
