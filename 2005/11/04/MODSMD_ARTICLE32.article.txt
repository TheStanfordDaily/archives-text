This week the Cardinal women's golf team traveled
to Kapolei, Hawaii to compete in the Kent Youel Invi
tational. After a slow start to last weekend's tourna
ment, the Cardinal reached their goal of starting well
and putting themselves in a position to win in Hawaii.
Senior Kelly Husted was a freshman the last time
the Cardinal played at the Kent Youel Invitational in
Oct. 2002. That year, the Cardinal took third place be
hind the strong play of then-senior Kim Rowton, who
won the individual title with a 215, one under par.
This year the Cardinal came into this week's 16-
team tournament looking to put last weekend's disap
pointing performance in the Stanford/Pepsi Invitation
al behind them, and this did just that, finishing second
as a team, while Husted took first individually at the
par 72,6,189-yard course.
Much like Rowton did in 2002, Husted answered
the call and turned in a stellar performance, finishing in
first place among all golfers with a 212, four under par.
She started out hot on the first day, shooting rounds of
69 (three under par) and 72. giving her a four stroke
lead over Baylor's Josefin Svenningson in the individ
ual standings.
"Kelly's ball striking is as good right now as I've ever
seen," head coach Caroline O'Connor said. "She fo
cused on one shot at a time and never allowed herself
to think about playing to win the tournament. She real
ly did a great job of controlling those things that she
could control — club and shot selection and game
management."
The rest of the team held their own as well. After the
first day, junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana and sen
ior Stephanie Lue were in the lop 25 individually with
scores of 147 and 154. respectively. With three golfers in
the top 25 and freshman Mari Chun and junior Lauren
Todd not far behind, the Cardinal stored a 597 overall
and held second place, trailing No. 9 Southern Califor
nia by just nine strokes. They were six strokes ahead of
No. 21 California and Baylor.
"We don't play many 36-hole days, and several had
never done so," O'Connor said. "It takes considerable
patience and mental discipline to deal with the long
waits between shots, strong winds, rain on and off all
day in addition to the physical demands. We really fo
cused on the fact that we were probably better pre
pared — mentally and physically — for the conditions,
and we would continue to attack the golf course
through the 36th hole when others were tired and fal
tering."
On day two, the Cardinal looked to carry over from
their strong day one performance and distance them
selves from competitive Cal and Baylor teams. They
did just that, with strong performances from the entire
team. Husted shot a 71 on the day, one under par, fur
ther distancing herself from Svenningson and USC's
Irene Cho, and earning her first collegiate individual
title. Tangtiphaiboontana shot a 79 and moved up to a
tie for eighth place, while Lue shot a 77 on the final
round and moved up to 18th place, giving Stanford
three women in the top 20 and two in the top 10. Chun
and Todd rounded out the team, tying for 31st place
with a 235,19 over par.
With a strong overall effort on the second day, Stan
ford opened up an 11 stroke lead over Cal and an 18
stroke lead over Baylor. The Cardinal finished with a
902 for the two-day tournament, only six strokes be
hind USC. Long Beach State, Cal and Baylor finished
in the top five.
"We had two very solid rounds at home last week
against a very strong field so there wasn't much that
needed changing," O'Connor said. "We did, however,
focus a considerable amount of time on short putt rep
etitions and being more aggressive on all [possible]
putts."

lead over Baylor's Josefin Svenningson in the individ
ual standings.
"Kelly's ball striking is as good right now as I've ever
seen," head coach Caroline O'Connor said. "She fo
cused on one shot at a time and never allowed herself
to think about playing to win the tournament. She real
ly did a great job of controlling those things that she
could control — club and shot selection and game
management."
The rest of the team held their own as well. After the
first day, junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana and sen
ior Stephanie Lue were in the lop 25 individually with
scores of 147 and 154. respectively. With three golfers in
the top 25 and freshman Mari Chun and junior Lauren
Todd not far behind, the Cardinal stored a 597 overall
and held second place, trailing No. 9 Southern Califor
nia by just nine strokes. They were six strokes ahead of
No. 21 California and Baylor.
"We don't play many 36-hole days, and several had
never done so," O'Connor said. "It takes considerable
patience and mental discipline to deal with the long
waits between shots, strong winds, rain on and off all
day in addition to the physical demands. We really fo
cused on the fact that we were probably better pre
pared — mentally and physically — for the conditions,
and we would continue to attack the golf course
through the 36th hole when others were tired and fal
tering."
On day two, the Cardinal looked to carry over from
their strong day one performance and distance them
selves from competitive Cal and Baylor teams. They
did just that, with strong performances from the entire
team. Husted shot a 71 on the day, one under par, fur
ther distancing herself from Svenningson and USC's
Irene Cho, and earning her first collegiate individual
title. Tangtiphaiboontana shot a 79 and moved up to a
tie for eighth place, while Lue shot a 77 on the final
round and moved up to 18th place, giving Stanford
three women in the top 20 and two in the top 10. Chun
and Todd rounded out the team, tying for 31st place
with a 235,19 over par.
With a strong overall effort on the second day, Stan
ford opened up an 11 stroke lead over Cal and an 18
stroke lead over Baylor. The Cardinal finished with a
902 for the two-day tournament, only six strokes be
hind USC. Long Beach State, Cal and Baylor finished
in the top five.
"We had two very solid rounds at home last week
against a very strong field so there wasn't much that
needed changing," O'Connor said. "We did, however,
focus a considerable amount of time on short putt rep
etitions and being more aggressive on all [possible]
putts."

This week the Cardinal women's golf team traveled
to Kapolei, Hawaii to compete in the Kent Youel Invi
tational. After a slow start to last weekend's tourna
ment, the Cardinal reached their goal of starting well
and putting themselves in a position to win in Hawaii.
Senior Kelly Husted was a freshman the last time
the Cardinal played at the Kent Youel Invitational in
Oct. 2002. That year, the Cardinal took third place be
hind the strong play of then-senior Kim Rowton, who
won the individual title with a 215, one under par.
This year the Cardinal came into this week's 16-
team tournament looking to put last weekend's disap
pointing performance in the Stanford/Pepsi Invitation
al behind them, and this did just that, finishing second
as a team, while Husted took first individually at the
par 72,6,189-yard course.
Much like Rowton did in 2002, Husted answered
the call and turned in a stellar performance, finishing in
first place among all golfers with a 212, four under par.
She started out hot on the first day, shooting rounds of
69 (three under par) and 72. giving her a four stroke
lead over Baylor's Josefin Svenningson in the individ
ual standings.
"Kelly's ball striking is as good right now as I've ever
seen," head coach Caroline O'Connor said. "She fo
cused on one shot at a time and never allowed herself
to think about playing to win the tournament. She real
ly did a great job of controlling those things that she

management."

and held second place, trailing No. 9 Southern Califor
nia by just nine strokes. They were six strokes ahead of
No. 21 California and Baylor.
