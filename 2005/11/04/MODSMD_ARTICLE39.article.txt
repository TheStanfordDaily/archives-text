### CALEY ANDERSON BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION ADVENTURERS 
Our mind-blowing weekend could not have
happened without the help of many, many won
derful people. We would like to thank Camille
and Brendan for allowing us to go in the first
place, setting up our plane tickets and attempted
hotel reservations, and for always being there
with an "Oh. shit!" when we call for help. Many
thanks to Big Hassle for providing us with the
press and photo passes; we can honestly say this
would not have happened without you. A special
thank you to Steven Trachtenbroit for not hang
ing up on us. We're definitely going to call you
the next time we're in New York to chill. You
were a Godsend and will always have a very spe
cial place in our hearts. We'd also like to thank
Ken Weinstein and Sophie Smith for keeping us
informed and just, in general, being awesome.
No thank you is complete without a shout-out to

the chick that let us into the trailer. We know you
weren't happy about it, but we appreciate it any
way.
Besides being grateful that we were born, we'd
like to thank Betsy's dad. Lee Congdon, and
Caley's mom, Patty Austin, for giving as invalu
able assistance with the camera and email hack
ing, respectively. Intermission would not look
like what you are holding without your help.
Debz, without you we would have slept at the
airport. You are the master Googler. Matt, with
out you we would have walked to the airport.
Uhhh... maybe not, but you know what we mean.
Thank you. Thanks to The Stanford Daily photo
department for the use of their camera, especial
ly John Chen for showing Caley how to use it.
That was pretty clutch. And last, but definitely
not least, thank you to all of the bands that per
formed at Vegoose. You made every trial and
tribulation of the weekend worth it and have in
spired us. Thank you.
