# Card set to honor seniors in last home weekend
## After a much-needed bye week, the Cardinal take on UCLA, SDSU

After a restful bye week, three mem

plan to take to the Maloney Field pitch
for the last time in their collegiate ca
reers when the Cardinal face No. 15
UCLA on Friday night and then end
their home schedule against San Diego

coach Bret Simon said. "Whether
on the field or on the bench, they are
all now considered team leaders,
which is a very difficult thing to do
when you're not fully healthy or out
on the field as a star player on the
team. Since it's their last weekend at
home they're going to do whatever
is in within their power to make the
weekend a successful one."
Injury woes have not been con
fined to the outgoing seniors. Stan
ford (4-9-2,1-5-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) desperately needed last
week's bye as six to seven players
on the team suffered flu-like symp

toms.The coaching staff improvised
and focused practices on keeping
skills sharp and building up the
bench players' fitness, rather than
focusing heavily on preparation for
upcoming opponents. As the ill
players recovered, the team ratch
eted up the intensity and specific
game planning for the showdown
with the Bruins.
UCLA (10-3-2. 5-1-1). who beat
the Cardinal 2-0 in Los Angeles on
Oct. 2, is currently riding the mo
mentum of two shutout wins last
weekend. The defense has been
stingy all year, surrendering six
goals on the season while scoring 22.
Stanford hopes to stymie Berkeley
native sophomore forward Kamani
Hill in his return to the Bay. Hill cur
rently leads UCLA's attack with 15
points on the season and was last

week's Pac-10 player of the week.
The Bruins are now in control of
their conference destiny, as a week
end sweep of the Bay Area schools
would clinch the program's fourth
consecutive conference title.
"It's important for us to dispos
sess UCLA in their defensive and
middle thirds of the field," junior
keeper Andrew Kartunen said.
"Coach has put an emphasis on
making sure to get numbers behind
the ball on defense and attacking
with speed. If we're able to do those
things throughout the game, we'll
find success."
The Cardinal then face San
Diego State (9-1-5, 2-1-4) in a test
of work ethic. Goalkeeper Tally
Hall has earned an Aztec record 11
shutouts this year, though much of
the credit also goes to an energetic

defense. Midfielder Kraig Chiles
has been the offensive impetus on
an aggressive club with seven goals
and 14 points. Stanford's 1-1 tie in
San Diego earlier this season is a
rare imperfection in one of the pro
gram's best years ever.
"San Diego State relies on out
working teams," junior midfielder
Galen Thompson said. "We have to
bring a great effort out to that game
and play confidently."
One difference from the first
meetings with the Southern Cali
fornia squads is that the home
crowd should help rejuvenate the
Cardinal in Friday's 7 p.m. match
and Sunday's 1 p.m. game.
"It definitely should be an ad
vantage playing at home," K.C.
Coyne said. "Not only does the
home crowd always makes things

easier but also because UCLA is
one of the hardest places to play."
Emotions look to run high this
weekend, as the senior class has
commented on their desire to make
one final positive mark on the Farm.
"[Senior weekend] doesn't real
ly play into the importance of the
game, I don't think," McKee said.
"Although as a senior, I would like
to play especially well."
That sentiment is not only
shared among the class of 2006; the
underclassmen realize the impor
tance of sending their leaders off in
an upbeat way.
"Our seniors deserve to go out
on some nice wins,"Thompson said.
"They have worked so hard for the
program and they are such good
players. Anything less than wins
isn't quite good enough."

coach Bret Simon said. "Whether
on the field or on the bench, they are
all now considered team leaders,
which is a very difficult thing to do
when you're not fully healthy or out
on the field as a star player on the
team. Since it's their last weekend at
home they're going to do whatever
is in within their power to make the
weekend a successful one."
Injury woes have not been con
fined to the outgoing seniors. Stan
ford (4-9-2,1-5-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) desperately needed last
week's bye as six to seven players
on the team suffered flu-like symp

toms.The coaching staff improvised
and focused practices on keeping
skills sharp and building up the
bench players' fitness, rather than
focusing heavily on preparation for
upcoming opponents. As the ill
players recovered, the team ratch
eted up the intensity and specific
game planning for the showdown
with the Bruins.
UCLA (10-3-2. 5-1-1). who beat
the Cardinal 2-0 in Los Angeles on
Oct. 2, is currently riding the mo
mentum of two shutout wins last
weekend. The defense has been
stingy all year, surrendering six
goals on the season while scoring 22.
Stanford hopes to stymie Berkeley
native sophomore forward Kamani
Hill in his return to the Bay. Hill cur
rently leads UCLA's attack with 15
points on the season and was last

week's Pac-10 player of the week.
The Bruins are now in control of
their conference destiny, as a week
end sweep of the Bay Area schools
would clinch the program's fourth
consecutive conference title.
"It's important for us to dispos
sess UCLA in their defensive and
middle thirds of the field," junior
keeper Andrew Kartunen said.
"Coach has put an emphasis on
making sure to get numbers behind
the ball on defense and attacking
with speed. If we're able to do those
things throughout the game, we'll
find success."
The Cardinal then face San
Diego State (9-1-5, 2-1-4) in a test
of work ethic. Goalkeeper Tally
Hall has earned an Aztec record 11
shutouts this year, though much of
the credit also goes to an energetic

defense. Midfielder Kraig Chiles
has been the offensive impetus on
an aggressive club with seven goals
and 14 points. Stanford's 1-1 tie in
San Diego earlier this season is a
rare imperfection in one of the pro
gram's best years ever.
"San Diego State relies on out
working teams," junior midfielder
Galen Thompson said. "We have to
bring a great effort out to that game
and play confidently."
One difference from the first
meetings with the Southern Cali
fornia squads is that the home
crowd should help rejuvenate the
Cardinal in Friday's 7 p.m. match
and Sunday's 1 p.m. game.
"It definitely should be an ad
vantage playing at home," K.C.
Coyne said. "Not only does the
home crowd always makes things

easier but also because UCLA is
one of the hardest places to play."
Emotions look to run high this
weekend, as the senior class has
commented on their desire to make
one final positive mark on the Farm.
"[Senior weekend] doesn't real
ly play into the importance of the
game, I don't think," McKee said.
"Although as a senior, I would like
to play especially well."
That sentiment is not only
shared among the class of 2006; the
underclassmen realize the impor
tance of sending their leaders off in
