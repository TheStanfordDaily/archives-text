## 'Jarhead' is no empty vessel 
### DI DANG INTERMISSION WARLORD 
"A story: a man fires a rifle," Antho
ny Swofford, or Swoff (Jake Gyllen
haal), narrates over the austere opening
credits of "Jarhead." "He will put the
rifle away, but whatever else he may do
with his hands — build a house, love a
woman, change his child's diapers — his
hands will always remember the rifle."
Throughout this opening narrative,
Swoff explains how being a Jarhead, de
fined as "an empty vessel and a self-im
posed moniker for the Marines, has so
deeply pervaded every fiber of his life.

Palestine is no 'Paradise,'
neither is the movie
By KELLY PETERSON
INTERMISSION PEACEKEEPER
Though "Paradise Now," a film about Palestinian
suicide bombers, may appear to be a great romantic
comedy and the perfect date movie for all you post-
Full Moon on the Quad lovers, I'm hoping that this re
view might make you reconsider your options. Don't
get me wrong: it has all elements of excellent and artsy
filmmaking (extended close-ups, long silences, entire
ly in Arabic), but perhaps the subject matter is a little
too fluffy. After all, what gets you in the mood more
than 91 minutes of what may be the last 48 hours of two
Palestinians' lives?
Now 1 really shouldn't dis
count the movie because it tend
ed to be a little dry and depress
ing. Perhaps it was simply my ir
ritation after having arrived an
hour and a half early with noth
ing to do, or the terrifyingly
large, distracting figures of Sully
and Mike Wazowski from
"Monster's Inc." that hampered
my viewing experience, but nonetheless, I thought the
film was a drag.
It follows Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suii
man), best friends since childhood, who believe that if
they are to martyr themselves for the Palestinian
cause, they should do it together. The audience is
thrown into their everyday lives, where they spend
their time working as auto-mechanics, drinking tea.
smoking hookah and taking part in an underground,
cultish anti-Jsraeli resistance.
The film begins when Suha (Lubna Asabal), a
beautiful woman who is emphatically not "from
there," brings her car in to the auto-repair shop for
Said to look at. Though sparks fly, Said seems para
lyzed in shyness and reservation. Khaled is soon after
wards fired from his job in an amusing display of anger
towards a customer — the only lighthearted moment
of the film (occurring during the first five minutes).
'Paradise Now'
Dir. Hany Abu-Assad
■ ■■■■■■■■
That night, Said and Khaled are approached by Jamal
(Amer Hlehel), one of the more educated men in their
anti-Israeli organization, who is delighted to inform
them that they have been chosen fora strike against
Tel Aviv.
From here, it becomes apparent that director Hany
Abu-Assad is trying very hard to humanize these men;
they arc portrayed with their families, poverty-strick
en and swept away in whether they may or may not go
through with it. Lines like, "Death is better than infe
riority," and "We have no other way to fight!" pervade
their conversations, shedding light on a mindset that
mav be unfathomable to many viewers.
When Said sneaks away to see Suha
one last time, their conversation ap
pears to rip a hole in Said's conscience,
making him question the righteous
ness of their cause. Despite his grow
ing suspicions, he continues with the
purification processes, looking to
Khaled as a pillar of strength. The next
day. they are dropped off into Israeli
territory to complete the suicide
bombing mission, but their plan goes
awry, and Said and Khaled are separated. Though
Abu-Assad wants the audience to become engrossed
in the question of, "Will they go through with it?" it is
difficult to hold our attention with the lingering close
up camera shots of Said blinking and the awkward,
long, soundtrack-less silences.
I left the theater thinking that the elitist in me
should have warmed up to the film more. After all, it
was artsy, slightly inaccessible and could easily have
been one of those movies that you name-drop as hav
ing seen and liked because it really "made you think"
about deep, politically charged issues. But even
though it did all these things and included an ending
that I hadn't remotely expected, the film's pace and
style thoroughly dampened my potential enthusiasm.
And just in case you hadn't caught on to my previous
sarcasm: do not take a date to see this film, unless your
date is into that death-and-destruction sort of thing.

context of a war, but it is not about
the Gulf War so much as it is about
what war can mean to its soldiers.
It is too easy to simply dismiss war
as "evil," to endlessly discuss the
needless bloodbath of war. Rather
than condemning war, Mendes
forces us to consider the concept o(
war beyond the political motiva
tions and statistics.
Mendes instead asks us to con
sider the complex dichotomy of
war. When Swoff and his partner,
Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), finally re
ceive an assignment, they profuse
ly thank their sergeant. In re
sponse to their eager excitement,
he says, "Don't thank me. just
don't fucking die." War strikes
fear and terror into the hearts of
the most hardened soldiers with
the omnipresent phantom of
death. Yet simultaneously, it gives
their lives meaning with the be
guiling opportunity of fighting for
an ideal.
"Jarhead" decisively eschews
championing either side in por
traying Swoff and his fellow
Marines as they struggle with this
inherent contradiction of war. The
beauty of the film lies in its success
in illustrating the paradoxes of war
and its deep impact upon the Jar
heads. With "Jarhead," Mendes
immerses us in the conflicted men
tality of Swoff and his friends.
Mendes makes us remember their
raw humanity behind the face of
war. Thus we begin to understand
how their lives become consumed
by nothing and how that means
everything.
