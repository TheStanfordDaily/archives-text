## 'Pride and Prejudice' has little to be proud of 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION ROMANTIC 
Director Joe Wright claims that he has not
read Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice"
or seen the BBC's celebrated six-hour mini-se
ries. He says he wanted his version of the story to
be untainted and not based upon anyone else's
vision but his own. Unfortunately, his version of
"P&P" takes the classic story and gives it the
Hollywood rinse, leaving a movie that takes the

complex human emotions and interactions of
Austen's story and turns it into Hollywood melo
drama.
Granted, every director is allowed to have his
or her vision. However, when beginning your

first motion picture, as "P&P" is for Wright, why
start with an adaptation of a beloved story that
has fanatical followers? Even if you ignore the
book's popularity, "P&P" is filled with many
characters that weave in and out of involved plot
lines. Wright's "P&P" attempts to navigate its
way through the plot maze by "seeing the movie
through Lizzie's eyes," but it ultimately can't de-

cide if it wants to commit to
Lizzie or tell the whole story,
and the movie ultimately is
left with large gaps and awk
ward pacing.
Maybe I'm just bitter be
cause Wright ruined arguably
the most pivotal (and best)
scene in the book, where
Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen)
unexpectedly asks Elizabeth

(Keira Knightly) to marry him. He not only trans
planted the scene outside to a dock, (in the rain no
less!), but the tension in the scene is blatantly sex
ual (they almost kiss), completely defeating
Austen's point about, oh, pride and the two char
acters' prejudices. And the best line, where Eliza
beth icily tells Darcy that he could not have pro
posed to her in any way that could have possibly
tempted her, was conspicuously left out.
Tnis is where "P&P falls short: it doesn't have
a grasp on what to cut and what should stay. Ob
viously, in two hours the whole story cannot be
told, but the pacing in "P&P" is uneven, and
you're left wondering why Wright sped through

"Pride and Prejudice"
Dir. Joe Wright

storylines like Lydia's wedding, yet found the
time for long lingering shots of beds being made
and Elizabeth swinging in circles. The attempt at
aesthetics isn't worth the loss of plot. Wright's
cutting also turns many of Austen's rich charac
ters into caricatures. Mrs. Bennett (Brenda
Blethyn) is relegated to little more than a silly,
giggling schoolgirl, and Mr. Bennett (Donald

Sutherland) and Lizzie's re
lationship is completely
gone. Interactions between
the main characters are de
veloped with panning cam
era angles and long mean
ingful looks, which are so
blatant they become laugh
able.
The highlight of the

whole movie is Mr. Collins
(Tom Hollander). One of the few spot-on cast
ing choices, the scene where he arrives for din
ner is laugh-out-loud funny, and unlike many
moments, is intentional. Hollander emotes the
right mix of awkwardness and self-awareness,
but is never unsympathetic and rises above the
directing. His acting almost made me forget
there was a large ham sitting in the forefront of
the scene when he asks Elizabeth to marry him.
The dialogue should have been paramount, but
the meat overshadowed it.
Knightly exceeded my expectations, however
her Elizabeth Bennett is not the same one you
will find in the book. Her Lizzie is a crying, emo-

tional mess;
unfortunately
her sass and
cute smile
cannot re
place the
inner strength
of the charac
ter that
makes her so
admirable.
MacFadyen
was a poor
choice as
Darcy; he
made two fa
cial expres
sions
throughout the
entire movie, a

poor choice for such an internal character. The
two are a pleasant looking pair, but Knightly's
overwrought emotions compared to MacFadyen
wooden countenance ultimately make their cou
pling unbelievable and forced.
To Wright's credit, he didn't end with a wed
ding, like every other Austen novel made into a
movie. Sadly, the final scene is not even in the
book, and the change in tone and dialogue is
abrupt, apparent and nauseating. If this were
just a "chick-flick" movie, I would have enjoyed
it a little more. But as a 'based-on' movie, it falls
very, very short.


Wow, you have a lot of pores


Don't drop it. Don't do it. Just
hold on a little longer.

pling unbelievable and forced.
To Wright's credit, he didn't end with a wed
ding, like every other Austen novel made into a
movie. Sadly, the final scene is not even in the
book, and the change in tone and dialogue is
abrupt, apparent and nauseating. If this were
just a "chick-flick" movie, I would have enjoyed
it a little more. But as a 'based-on' movie, it falls
very, very short.


Wow, you have a lot of pores


Don't drop it. Don't do it. Just
hold on a little longer.
Director Joe Wright claims that he has not
read Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice"
or seen the BBC's celebrated six-hour mini-se
ries. He says he wanted his version of the story to
be untainted and not based upon anyone else's
vision but his own. Unfortunately, his version of
"P&P" takes the classic story and gives it the
Hollywood rinse, leaving a movie that takes the

complex human emotions and interactions of
Austen's story and turns it into Hollywood melo
drama.
Granted, every director is allowed to have his
or her vision. However, when beginning your

first motion picture, as "P&P" is for Wright, why
start with an adaptation of a beloved story that
has fanatical followers? Even if you ignore the
book's popularity, "P&P" is filled with many
characters that weave in and out of involved plot
lines. Wright's "P&P" attempts to navigate its
way through the plot maze by "seeing the movie
through Lizzie's eyes," but it ultimately can't de-

cide if it wants to commit to
Lizzie or tell the whole story,
and the movie ultimately is
left with large gaps and awk
ward pacing.
Maybe I'm just bitter be
cause Wright ruined arguably
the most pivotal (and best)
scene in the book, where
Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen)
unexpectedly asks Elizabeth

(Keira Knightly) to marry him. He not only trans
planted the scene outside to a dock, (in the rain no
less!), but the tension in the scene is blatantly sex
ual (they almost kiss), completely defeating
Austen's point about, oh, pride and the two char
acters' prejudices. And the best line, where Eliza
beth icily tells Darcy that he could not have pro
posed to her in any way that could have possibly
tempted her, was conspicuously left out.
Tnis is where "P&P falls short: it doesn't have
a grasp on what to cut and what should stay. Ob
viously, in two hours the whole story cannot be
told, but the pacing in "P&P" is uneven, and
you're left wondering why Wright sped through

"Pride and Prejudice"
Dir. Joe Wright

storylines like Lydia's wedding, yet found the
time for long lingering shots of beds being made
and Elizabeth swinging in circles. The attempt at
aesthetics isn't worth the loss of plot. Wright's
cutting also turns many of Austen's rich charac
ters into caricatures. Mrs. Bennett (Brenda
Blethyn) is relegated to little more than a silly,
giggling schoolgirl, and Mr. Bennett (Donald

Sutherland) and Lizzie's re
lationship is completely
gone. Interactions between
the main characters are de
veloped with panning cam
era angles and long mean
ingful looks, which are so
blatant they become laugh
able.
The highlight of the

whole movie is Mr. Collins
(Tom Hollander). One of the few spot-on cast
ing choices, the scene where he arrives for din
ner is laugh-out-loud funny, and unlike many
moments, is intentional. Hollander emotes the
right mix of awkwardness and self-awareness,
but is never unsympathetic and rises above the
directing. His acting almost made me forget
there was a large ham sitting in the forefront of
the scene when he asks Elizabeth to marry him.
The dialogue should have been paramount, but
the meat overshadowed it.
Knightly exceeded my expectations, however
her Elizabeth Bennett is not the same one you
will find in the book. Her Lizzie is a crying, emo-

tional mess;
unfortunately
her sass and
cute smile
cannot re
place the
inner strength
of the charac
ter that
makes her so
admirable.
MacFadyen
was a poor
choice as
Darcy; he
made two fa
cial expres
sions
throughout the
entire movie, a

poor choice for such an internal character. The
two are a pleasant looking pair, but Knightly's
overwrought emotions compared to MacFadyen
wooden countenance ultimately make their cou
pling unbelievable and forced.
