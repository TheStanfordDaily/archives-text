# 'Leaving Las Vegas' reminds us performance counts

### RYAN LAMPE INTERMISSION GAMBLER 
"Leaving Las Vegas" is arguably the greatest movie to be set in
Sin City. If you don't find "Pride and Prejudice" appealing,
consider revisiting the performance that earned Nicolas Cage a
Best Actor Oscar.
Leaving Las Vegas (1994)
"Leaving Vegas" was produced quickly and cheaply. Its
budget was impossibly small. And since permits were not is
sued for several street scenes, many sequences were filmed in
only one take. Nevertheless, based on the strength of its lead
actors, "Leaving Las Vegas" was one of 1994's best movies.
"Leaving Las Vegas" is about two characters. The first is
Ben, a Hollywood executive who travels to Las Vegas with the
intention of drinking himself to death, literally. The second is
Sera, a Las Vegas prostitute who has an abusive relationship
with a sleazy European pimp. The two characters meet one
night and arc immediately drawn to each other. Ben needs
someone that will care for him and accept the course he has
chosen. Sera simply needs someone to care for.
Unlike many Hollywood pictures, "Leaving Las Vegas"
gives its characters very little back-story. We know that Ben
had a family and job: we see a burning photograph of a wife
and child, and we see Ben being fired by his boss. But we are

never told how or why he lost them. Was it his drinking? Or did
that come later? Similarly, we know very little about Sera's
past. We are told she was a prostitute in LA. But we are not

told why she chose this career.
That we understand and empathize with
Ben and Sera reflects the skill of the two
leads. Nicolas Cage is nothing short of sensa
tional. Though Ben's behavior is so overtly
destructive, Cage manages to make his char
acter likeable. This is crucial because, for the
story to work, we need to understand why
Sera would be drawn to someone like Ben.
Elizabeth Shue's amazing performance as
Sera helps make this unlikely decision even
more credible. Cage won an Oscar for his
performance while Shue did not. Yet it's al
most impossible to argue that Cage outdoes
his female costar.
Cage followed up "Leaving Las Vegas"
with "The Rock," "Con Air," "Gone in 60
Seconds" and other lightweight action pro
jects that exploit his fiendish charisma. This

led Sean Penn to famously comment that "Nic Cage is no
longer an actor. He's more like a performer." Cage returned to
acting in 2002, portraying intelligent, yet eccentric, misfits in
both "Adaptation" and "Matchstick Men."

Unlike Cage, Shue's prospects did not improve after "Leav
ing Las Vegas." Best known for her roles in"The Karate Kid"
and "Adventures in Babysitting," Shue followed up "Leaving

Las Vegas" with heroic turns in com
mercial projects like "The Saint" and
"Hollow Man." She appeared earlier
this year in the critically mauled
thriller "Hide and Seek."
After "Leaving Las Vegas," direc
tor Mike Figgis wrote and directed
"One Night Stand" starring Wesley
Snipes and Nastassja Kinsky. Given
his success with "Leaving Las Vegas,''
the film was considered a major dis
appointment. In 2(X)0, Figgis wrote
and directed "Timecode," an experi
mental movie in which the viewer's
screen is divided into four segments
that simultaneously follow four char
acters.

More than ten years after its initial
release, "Leaving Las Vegas" is still

one of the most haunting love stories ever filmed. With its rich
screenplay, clever direction and knockout performances,
"Leaving Las Vegas" remains the peak of Figgis, Cage and
Shues' careers.
