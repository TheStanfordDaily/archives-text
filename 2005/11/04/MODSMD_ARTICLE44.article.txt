## Welcome to the twilight zone... 
### 
Over 40,000 people spent $120+ on tickets to
the first annual Vegoose Music Festival this past
weekend in Las Vegas. Among those souls were
your Intermission editors, only we didn't have to
buy our tickets because we had a press pass and
a photo pass. Not only that, but we hadn't even
asked for them. The wonderful people from Big
Hassle contacted us to see if we wanted to cover
the musical extravaganza. Who's going to say no
to Halloween in Vegas and hours of spectacular
live music? Surely not Intermission.
"How was Vegas?" is the wrong question to
ask. This question will get you a heavy sigh and
head shaking, because Las Vegas, if you are not
21, sucks.
"How was Vegoose?" is the right question to
ask. While everything outside of the Sam Boyd
Stadium went awry, inside the gates everything
proceeded like a dream.
' The following pages contain our account of
the whirlwind weekend. From the second we ar
rived in Las Vegas we didn't have a moment to
stop and process our bigger-than-life surround
ings and the surreal events. All of it is true (to
extent that we remember. There were some
(father stressful and overwhelming moments...)
and it truly was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
We're only sorry you all couldn't have come with
[us.
We mean that only semi-facetiously, too, be
cause it was truly a gem of a music festival. Every
artist was there because they love performing
and they are devoted to the cause of music, and
every fan seemed to be there for the exact same
reason. As Trey Anastasio said during the press
conference, "Live music is the solution [to the
problems in the music industry]." It goes further
than that; however, as expressed by a passing
man's shirt, which said, "Art saved me." The
power of live music was on full-display, and if
you have the opportunity to make the trek next
year, we highly/ highly recommend you go. It will
be an experience you won't soon forget.
