degrees, the cheery and excited concertgoers had more
quality music to listen to over the 11 hour day then could
nave ever possibly been consumed. Picking and choos-

ing, though paintul at times, was halt the tun ot the ex
ceptional bill.

The rhythm of the festival occurred in four waves:
early afternoon, mid-aftemoon, early evening and then
high noon. No, not really; evening is chronologically

next. We were just seeing if you were paying attention.
Steel Train began the aay on the Jokers Wild Stage,

starting promptly at noon and playing a solidly rhyth
mic jam-band-in-training set. Interspersed amongst
the slower songs was a cover of the Talking Heads,
■ . 11. i .. .1 i i# i .i.. i . i

highlighting the band's ability to rock out when
needed. Hailed as the next Crosby, Still, Nash and
Young, Steel Train reminded us of the potential of a

large music festival to expose the auaience to up
and-coming artists. As Trey Anastasio, of Phish
fame, said, "The coolest thing about this music

festival is the unexpected artist."
Slightly Stoopid followed on the main stage

with a rocking reggae set, transporting the audi
ence to the Caribbean. The North Mississippi
All Stars played on the Jokers stage at the same time,

entrancing the audience with tight blues jams that, al
though long, always found their way back around. De-

J ~ /
vendra Banhart performed on the Snake Eyes Stage,
and was terribly boring, though he seemeato

have a strong fanbase. Beans, with Holy
F*ck, rounded out the early afternoon
group, on the Clubs Tent stage, and
fused rap with R&B, reggae and rock.
Unfortunately, the crowd wasn't as ap
preciative of his talents as they should
nave been, but that didn't deter the high
energy of his set.

w The mid-afternoon crew began with
the String Cheese Incident on the main

stage, a good choice to follow Slightly Stoopid,
as they played a similar Caribbean-ir}spired set. The

bdrid members were visibly elated to be performing, and
their lead guitarist (even though he looked like Santg
Glows) enthusiastically bopped up and down throughout
the entire set. The Clubs Tent overflowed for Blackalicious.
Throngs of people surrounded the tent, stijying to catch a
glimpse of the powerhouse rap duo. The Decemberisfs
performed on the Snake Eyes Stage, proving why they are
one of hottest artists in the indie scene right now. Their in
genious mix of Irish-inspired 'melodies, sea chanteys and
indie-pop was infectious, and the ever-increasing crowd

responded favorably.
The sun began to set as Phil Lesh & Friends
took the rrvjin stage Lesh, the former Grateful
Dead frontmari, made wading through the sea
of Deadheads worth it, and their electric set
could not b < m been performed to a more ap
preciative audience. The vibe was so impres
sive that Lesh came back onto the stage five min-

utes after he was scheduled to end and played an
extra half on hour.

On the Snake Eyes Stage, The Shins set began at the
exact same time as Lesh, forcing people to miss some or all
of either olthe two best sets of the day. Emerging in nun cos
tumes, The Shins captivated the audience from the first
notes of "Caring is Creepy/' their opening song. The giddy
energy of the band didn't waver; at multiple points through
out the set they battled with oversized yardsticks, there was
a constant stream of God/a men/bless you jokes and the
banter with the audience was refreshing. There was not a
single song that lagged in their 90 minute set, and they even
played a new song that bodes well for the next album.
Talib Kweli, also playing at the same time as The Shins
and Lesh, held his own in trie Clubs Tent. He attracted such
a large crowd that the walls of the tent were taken down so
the massive amounts of people standing around could hear
his set. We, unfortunately, missed almost all of his set, along
with Primus, The Codetalkers, Gov't Mule, Atmosphere
and Islands, but the response of the audience was, again,
phenomenal.
Beck emerged on the Snake Eyes Stage wearing a Boy
Scout's uniform, and jumped immediately into "Loser." The
staae was decorated with a life-size deer and owl lawn or-

namerits, along with foliage and bizarre instruments
(like wine glasses filled with water). The audience,
many of who had been waiting since one p.m., went
berserk. Beck was the loudest performance of the
day; the bass during "Girl" was almost overwhelm
ing. He was also the most eccentric, and in true Beck
style had one of his band members spasmodically
running around the stage with a tambourine during
"Black Tambourine." The crowd ate it up, only fuel
ing the energy of the band.
The final performance of the night came from
Dave Matthews & Friends, including Tim Reynolds
and Anastasio. The stadium seemed filled to ca
pacity, and Maithews'and Company did not disap- 9
point. The joy that the three gOWansts g(jm£red out
of playing together wasHatontfy expressed^on each
face; Anastasio's grinjdr<ftfB+
waver throughout tf*e two plus hour set anci com
plemented Matthew's jubilant stag? presence*
Anastasio and Reynolds tried, and came close
on a few solos, to upstage Matthew! Reynolds' ec
static guitar picking on "Jimi Thing" added a spark I
to the already bright song. Proving yet again now
well he can perform solo, Matthews' rendition of

"Some Devil," with just him and his teyitar, was heartbreak
inglv beautiful. S

The power of seeing Matthews livte leaves no doubt as to
why he has legions or devoted fan|Aat travel around the
country to see him perform. The rmj|h pulses with energy
when ne plays, and his dance mo\|jj are nothing short of
inspired. He nas tapped into something deep, ana his abil
ity to connect with the audience ancQreate a magical mo
ment with each note is pure brilliance.
Anastasio and Matthews perform® "Bathtub Gin" as an
acoustic duet in the encore, and almost everyone in the au
dience was dancing. The final soncgtt the night was a full
band cover of Chaka Khan's "Tell KfeSomething Good," a
boisterous ending to a day filled with seemingly never-end
ing superb performances. As Matthdß boogied around the
stage, Anastasio dropped his guitarffiid started drumming
as if his life depended on it and Reywlds held it all togeth
er with biting guitar licks, the full ddß>f music, sun and in
sane Vegas energy ended on an apflbpriately high note.

extra half on hour.

On the Snake Eyes Stage, The Shins set began at the
exact same time as Lesh, forcing people to miss some or all
of either olthe two best sets of the day. Emerging in nun cos
tumes, The Shins captivated the audience from the first
notes of "Caring is Creepy/' their opening song. The giddy
energy of the band didn't waver; at multiple points through
out the set they battled with oversized yardsticks, there was
a constant stream of God/a men/bless you jokes and the
banter with the audience was refreshing. There was not a
single song that lagged in their 90 minute set, and they even
played a new song that bodes well for the next album.
Talib Kweli, also playing at the same time as The Shins
and Lesh, held his own in trie Clubs Tent. He attracted such
a large crowd that the walls of the tent were taken down so
the massive amounts of people standing around could hear
his set. We, unfortunately, missed almost all of his set, along
with Primus, The Codetalkers, Gov't Mule, Atmosphere
and Islands, but the response of the audience was, again,
phenomenal.
Beck emerged on the Snake Eyes Stage wearing a Boy
Scout's uniform, and jumped immediately into "Loser." The
staae was decorated with a life-size deer and owl lawn or-

namerits, along with foliage and bizarre instruments
(like wine glasses filled with water). The audience,
many of who had been waiting since one p.m., went
berserk. Beck was the loudest performance of the
day; the bass during "Girl" was almost overwhelm
ing. He was also the most eccentric, and in true Beck
style had one of his band members spasmodically
running around the stage with a tambourine during
"Black Tambourine." The crowd ate it up, only fuel
ing the energy of the band.
The final performance of the night came from
Dave Matthews & Friends, including Tim Reynolds
and Anastasio. The stadium seemed filled to ca
pacity, and Maithews'and Company did not disap- 9
point. The joy that the three gOWansts g(jm£red out
of playing together wasHatontfy expressed^on each
face; Anastasio's grinjdr<ftfB+
waver throughout tf*e two plus hour set anci com
plemented Matthew's jubilant stag? presence*
Anastasio and Reynolds tried, and came close
on a few solos, to upstage Matthew! Reynolds' ec
static guitar picking on "Jimi Thing" added a spark I
to the already bright song. Proving yet again now
well he can perform solo, Matthews' rendition of

"Some Devil," with just him and his teyitar, was heartbreak
inglv beautiful. S

The power of seeing Matthews livte leaves no doubt as to
why he has legions or devoted fan|Aat travel around the
country to see him perform. The rmj|h pulses with energy
when ne plays, and his dance mo\|jj are nothing short of
inspired. He nas tapped into something deep, ana his abil
ity to connect with the audience ancQreate a magical mo
ment with each note is pure brilliance.
Anastasio and Matthews perform® "Bathtub Gin" as an
acoustic duet in the encore, and almost everyone in the au
dience was dancing. The final soncgtt the night was a full
band cover of Chaka Khan's "Tell KfeSomething Good," a
boisterous ending to a day filled with seemingly never-end
ing superb performances. As Matthdß boogied around the
stage, Anastasio dropped his guitarffiid started drumming
as if his life depended on it and Reywlds held it all togeth

The rhythm of the festival occurred in four waves:
early afternoon, mid-aftemoon, early evening and then
high noon. No, not really; evening is chronologically

next. We were just seeing if you were paying attention.
Steel Train began the aay on the Jokers Wild Stage,

starting promptly at noon and playing a solidly rhyth

the slower songs was a cover of the Talking Heads,

highlighting the band's ability to rock out when

Young, Steel Train reminded us of the potential of a

large music festival to expose the auaience to up
and-coming artists. As Trey Anastasio, of Phish
fame, said, "The coolest thing about this music

festival is the unexpected artist."
Slightly Stoopid followed on the main stage

with a rocking reggae set, transporting the audi
ence to the Caribbean. The North Mississippi
All Stars played on the Jokers stage at the same time,

entrancing the audience with tight blues jams that, al

group, on the Clubs Tent stage, and
fused rap with R&B, reggae and rock.
Unfortunately, the crowd wasn't as ap
preciative of his talents as they should
nave been, but that didn't deter the high
energy of his set.

w The mid-afternoon crew began with
the String Cheese Incident on the main

stage, a good choice to follow Slightly Stoopid,
as they played a similar Caribbean-ir}spired set. The

bdrid members were visibly elated to be performing, and
their lead guitarist (even though he looked like Santg
Glows) enthusiastically bopped up and down throughout
the entire set. The Clubs Tent overflowed for Blackalicious.
Throngs of people surrounded the tent, stijying to catch a
glimpse of the powerhouse rap duo. The Decemberisfs
performed on the Snake Eyes Stage, proving why they are
one of hottest artists in the indie scene right now. Their in
genious mix of Irish-inspired 'melodies, sea chanteys and
indie-pop was infectious, and the ever-increasing crowd

responded favorably.
The sun began to set as Phil Lesh & Friends
took the rrvjin stage Lesh, the former Grateful
Dead frontmari, made wading through the sea
of Deadheads worth it, and their electric set
could not b < m been performed to a more ap
