## In photography, sometimes the rubber ducky has to go... 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION ROCK STAR 
About ten of us crowded together on the far left side of the
stage, nervously checking our watches. Five o'clock had

come and gone, and we were all still standing on the
wrong side of the barrier. The large imposing

security guard wouldn't let us into the
4 * £ TL _ cl: » . ,4

pit to set-up for The Shins' set,
because the fellow with

the security pass who
was supposed to get us

in to take photos hadn't
arrived yet. We kept
glancing at each other

anxiously, intermittently
checking to make sure our
cameras were ready should

something happen.
And then The Shins

walked out dressed as nuns,
and the crowd went insane.

"Shit!" screamed a particularly
tense photographer to my right.

"They won't let us in, and they're
going to take the costumes off after
the first song and we're all going to be

fucked!" He ran up to the fence and
started frantically snapping photos over
the heads of the fifteen or so rows of peo
ple in front of us.

Finally, the man with the credentials showed up, and the group
of photographers literally ran behind the barrier to start shooting.
The tension, however, didn't cease, and when two band members

took out oversized yardsticks and starting dueling
with them, Mr. Pushy-Pants from before lit-

erally elbowed me out of the way to
"get his shot." All he had to do

was ask nicely.
But so is the life of

Power-That-
Be seems to
love me, I had

the chance to join
their ranks last Sat
urday at the Veg-

oose Music Festival.
After over ten
years of attending con-

certs and being one of the
shortest people in atten-

dance (and therefore unable
to see anything), I finally
found a way to rectify the situa-

tion: be a press photographer. For the first three songs (or 15 min
utes — whichever comes first) yon literally have front row visi
bility, without thousands of people pushing forward and cutting
off your air supply. The only problem was there were four stages
and only one of me; how could I possibly get to each act, espe-

dally when a few started at the same time?
The answer came from my new friend

j
Tim, a freelance photographer in
his "50s who had ridden all the way

from Colorado on his motor
cycle for the festival. As we

jogged from The Shins to
Dave Matthews, we saw

the Primus stage off in the
distance, which had two
giant lit-up rubber duckies

guarding the edges of the
stage. Tim turned to

me and said, "When
you get in these situa-

tions, it's the rubber ducky that goes."
Basically, you have to choose, so for those of you who were hop
ing to see Phil Lesh pictures, I'm sorry. I chose The Shins instead.
Primus I abandoned altogether, and the rap stage didn't stand a
chance.
The actual 15 minutes of shooting were much more intense
