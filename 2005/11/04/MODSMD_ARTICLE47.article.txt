### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION FESTIVAL FIEND 
In an age where music has never been more
accessible, when everyone has some type of
portable music device that is as an important an
accessory as the cell phone and ear buds hum in
coffee shops, libraries and classrooms with
everything from 50 cent to the newest NPR news
release, the music industry could not be more
upset. They are dragging teenagers to court and
crying about how multimillionaires are losing
thousands of dollars (yes 1 know it is the small
time artist that is losing money). But I won't use
this article to debate the merits of that third-rail.
No. 1 wish to write about my trip to Las
Vegas, NV this weekend to attend Vegoose, a
virgin music festival that defined what is right
about the music industry. Vegoose can be
summed up in five words: a celebration of live
music. It was apparent that artists were chosen
more for their, as Les Claypool of Primus put it.
'approach to music than [their] style."
Headliners included Dave Matthews and
Friends, Talib Kweli, The Shins. Phil Lesh and
Friends. The Arcade Fire and Jack Johnson. 1
was pleasantly surprised, as were the organizers
apparently, by the audiences' diverse musical
tastes. By the second act (Blackalicious) of four

artists on the first day of the festival, the hip
hop/rap tent was overwhelmed to the point
where people, unable to get into the tent, had
just decided to sit on the grass outside and stare
at its walls.
As the temperature began to drop, the crowd
consisted of an odd mix of Deadheads, Emo
teenagers and people in ridiculous costumes.
Wandering between Talib Kweli. Phil Lesh and
Friends and The Shins—yes they were all play
ing at the same time that was not a unique prob
lem as the lineup included so many big-name
artists—l saw dreadlocks. Converses and do rags
at every stage.
Even the artists were enjoying the opportuni
ty to try new music and see unknown bands.
Xcel, half of the Blackalicious duo, was blown
away when he caught the end of the Beans w/
Holy F*ck show: "I wouldn't have seen that by
watching the club scene." And Claypool said
that it was exciting "being a part of something I
would like to go see."
As an added bonus, every performer was
amazing live. I came home to listen to CDs of my
favorite artists of the weekend only to be slightly
disappointed. 1 still loved the music, but small
speakers cannot replace the atmosphere and en
ergy of a live show. Nothing felt scripted or re
hearsed, which is rare in the entertainment in

dustry these days.
Despite being a music-lover's dream. Veg
oose was more than just music. It was also Hal
loween weekend—Las Vegas style. There was a
wedding chapel, which was taking appoint
ments. None of the unions were valid but "Ozzy
Osbourne" and "Austin Powers" would sing for
the new couple (I particularly liked "I'm Too
Sexy" as performed by "Austin Powers"). After
the wedding, the happy couple could make a
quick stop at the Vau de Vire's Twisted Cabaret
Circus Tent. I can honestly say it was the most
bizarre thing I saw all weekend, which is saying
a lot. These San Francisco artists added Hal
loween flare and a place to go to get out of the
sun.
"Bill Clinton," "John Travolta" and
"Michael Jackson" stopped by the Imperson
ator's Cafe, whose main purpose was clearly to
supply cocktails. At one point I approached the
bar and asked fora soda, and the bartender
looked at me a little funny and replied, "We
don't sell soda. Those are mixers." Alcohol was
a big theme of Vegoose. In fact, the map of the
venue has a separate symbol for beer and beer &
spirits. There were even Budweiser semis that
had taps on the side of the trucks. Oh Vegas....
Basically what I learned this weekend was
that music festivals are worth all the money that

they cost (think of all the money that you have
saved not buying CDs this year and cough up the
dough). They are an experience that you can
never encapsulate in a recording. Vegoose
wasn't just a show; it was an extravaganza that
went beyond set after set of different artists. At
one point in the weekend, Trey Anastasio said.
"Live music is the solution." It is the solution to
all the problems in the music industry; it is a cel
ebration of music, its fans and its quirkiness. The
music industrv should take notice to Veeoose.
