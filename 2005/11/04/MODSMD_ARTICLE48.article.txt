## Good thing no one's tapping our cell phones 
### BETSY CONGDON INTERMISSION PHONE MAGICIAN 
I guess it was karma. We put out a Worst
Case Scenario: Survival Guide Intermission on
Friday and by Friday night Caley and I were al
ready living our Worst Case Scenario: Vegas.
When we weren't rocking out to the bands or
singing along with "John Travolta" at the Im
personators' Cafe, we were on the phone franti
cally trying to rectify whatever situation we had
gotten ourselves into that time. Here is a
glimpse at our call log:
11:30 p.m. Friday Oct. 28:1 call Brendan, who
booked the hotel, looking for guidance.
BETSY: Brendan... apparently you have to be
21 to check into a hotel in the state of Nevada.
BRENDAN: Aren't you close?
BETSY: That doesn't count.
BRENDAN: Ohh... Good luck with that.
11:35 p.m. Friday Oct. 28: Needing someone to
Google fora room in Vegas, I knew just who to
call.
DEBZ: Hello.'
BETSY: Hey. Can you search Google fora hos
tel in Vegas?
11:38 pm Friday Oct. 28: Caley calls Howard

Johnson to confirm a reservation that she had
just finished booking.
HOJO: What is your ten-digit confirmation
number?
CALEY: 68663373
HOJO: That's only eight-digits. What is your
name ma'am?
CALEY: Caley Anderson. 1 just booked a
room at the Las Vegas Strip location.
HOJO: Ah, I have you. Your ten-digit confir
mation number is 68663373.
CALEY: That is the number I have. It is only
eight digits.
HOJO: Right.
8:00 p.m. Saturday Oct. 29: After a day of being
apart, we decided to meet up for Dave Matthews.
However, when Caley called me, I was unable to
talk.
CALEY:
BETSY: I CANT HEAR YOU! I AM IN THE
THIRD ROW FROM THE STAGE! MEET
ME AT THE PRESS TRAILER AFTER
THE SHOW!
CALEY:

11:30 p.m. Saturday Oct. 29: We met back at the
press trailer to find my backpack (read comput
er, wallet, keys) are locked in it. There is no one
around but a security officer who is no help. Of
course, the numbers of the people who work in
the press trailer are on my computer. Caley calls
her mom to retrieve the numbers offofwebmail
and we begin calling everyone we know at Big
Hassle, the publicity firm handling Vegoose.
BETSY: Calls Ken Weinstein . ..no answer.
CALEY: Calls David Foster. ..no answer.
BETSY: Calls Sophie Smith ...no answer. Fuck,
we only have one more. Maybe I should call
Brendan and tell him we are changing the plane
tickets...
CALEY: Calls the last person on our list: Steven
Trachtenbroit...
STEVIE (editor's note: this is the nickname that
we now affectionately call him around the of
fice): Hello?
CALEY: HellothisisCaley Anderson

STEVIE: Fuck, fuck, fuck-fuck — sorry for the
language.

CALEY: No, no lam there with you. If no one
can come tonight is it possible for someone to
come in tomorrow morning?
STEVIE: If your flight is at seven a.m., we'll
probably be going to bed at seven. I just got
back to my hotel and 1 am getting ready to go
out and everyone else is out... You sit tight and
I will get back to you. I'm sorry.
CALEY: No! We are so sorry. Thank you so
much.
Later he calls back. About midway through the
conversation he asks:
STEVIE: What publication are you from
Caley?
CALEY:.. The Stanford Daily.
STEVIE: Ken Weinstein {head of Big Hassle)
wants to know if you had fun.
CALEY: It was ridiculously fun.
STEVIE: To someone in the background: She
says it was ridic. To Caley: I shortened that up
for you.
We did finally get into the press trailer (Thank
you Steve!) to make it back to the hotel for four
hours of sleep (Thank you daylight savings
time) before catching a taxi to the airport.

CALEY: It was ridiculously fun.
STEVIE: To someone in the background: She
says it was ridic. To Caley: I shortened that up
for you.
We did finally get into the press trailer (Thank
you Steve!) to make it back to the hotel for four
hours of sleep (Thank you daylight savings
time) before catching a taxi to the airport.
I guess it was karma. We put out a Worst
Case Scenario: Survival Guide Intermission on
Friday and by Friday night Caley and I were al
ready living our Worst Case Scenario: Vegas.
When we weren't rocking out to the bands or
singing along with "John Travolta" at the Im
personators' Cafe, we were on the phone franti
cally trying to rectify whatever situation we had
gotten ourselves into that time. Here is a
glimpse at our call log:
11:30 p.m. Friday Oct. 28:1 call Brendan, who
booked the hotel, looking for guidance.
BETSY: Brendan... apparently you have to be
21 to check into a hotel in the state of Nevada.
BRENDAN: Aren't you close?
BETSY: That doesn't count.
BRENDAN: Ohh... Good luck with that.
11:35 p.m. Friday Oct. 28: Needing someone to
Google fora room in Vegas, I knew just who to
call.
DEBZ: Hello.'
BETSY: Hey. Can you search Google fora hos
tel in Vegas?
11:38 pm Friday Oct. 28: Caley calls Howard

Johnson to confirm a reservation that she had
just finished booking.
HOJO: What is your ten-digit confirmation
number?
CALEY: 68663373
HOJO: That's only eight-digits. What is your
name ma'am?
CALEY: Caley Anderson. 1 just booked a
room at the Las Vegas Strip location.
HOJO: Ah, I have you. Your ten-digit confir
mation number is 68663373.
CALEY: That is the number I have. It is only
eight digits.
HOJO: Right.
8:00 p.m. Saturday Oct. 29: After a day of being
apart, we decided to meet up for Dave Matthews.
However, when Caley called me, I was unable to
talk.
CALEY:
BETSY: I CANT HEAR YOU! I AM IN THE
THIRD ROW FROM THE STAGE! MEET
ME AT THE PRESS TRAILER AFTER
THE SHOW!
CALEY:

11:30 p.m. Saturday Oct. 29: We met back at the
press trailer to find my backpack (read comput
er, wallet, keys) are locked in it. There is no one
around but a security officer who is no help. Of
course, the numbers of the people who work in
the press trailer are on my computer. Caley calls
her mom to retrieve the numbers offofwebmail
and we begin calling everyone we know at Big
Hassle, the publicity firm handling Vegoose.
BETSY: Calls Ken Weinstein . ..no answer.
CALEY: Calls David Foster. ..no answer.
BETSY: Calls Sophie Smith ...no answer. Fuck,
we only have one more. Maybe I should call
Brendan and tell him we are changing the plane
tickets...
CALEY: Calls the last person on our list: Steven
Trachtenbroit...
STEVIE (editor's note: this is the nickname that
we now affectionately call him around the of
fice): Hello?

STEVIE: Fuck, fuck, fuck-fuck — sorry for the
language.

CALEY: No, no lam there with you. If no one
can come tonight is it possible for someone to
come in tomorrow morning?
STEVIE: If your flight is at seven a.m., we'll
probably be going to bed at seven. I just got
back to my hotel and 1 am getting ready to go
out and everyone else is out... You sit tight and
I will get back to you. I'm sorry.
CALEY: No! We are so sorry. Thank you so
much.
Later he calls back. About midway through the
conversation he asks:
STEVIE: What publication are you from
Caley?
CALEY:.. The Stanford Daily.
STEVIE: Ken Weinstein {head of Big Hassle)
wants to know if you had fun.
CALEY: It was ridiculously fun.
