# Who knew taking photos of rock stars could be so much work?

Besides the bands themselves, I
also photographed the press confer
ence with Trey Anastasio of Phish
fame (who I now have a large crash
on), Les Claypool of Primus and Xcel
of Blackalicious, and also included an
acoustic performance by Steel Train,
an adorable up-and-coming band. As
the press conference came to a close I
wandered towards the back of the
press tent (I was in the press tent!)
and stood next to Karen, a reporter
from The Tahoe World. "I hope you
didn't let those guys push you out,"
she said to me, looking scornfully
over to the group of photographers
crowding the front of the tent.
I hadn't been paying close atten
tion, as I was trying not to break the
camera or trip over cords and fall flat
on my face, but almost all of the other

photographers (and reporters for that
matter) were older white men. For
the first few hours of the festival. I was
the only female photographer, and 1
was by far the youngest. Eventually
three other female photographers
showed up —one even worked for
Spin Magazine. Don't worry; I held
my own. Even though elbowing was
involved, for the rest of the bands I
stood my ground, proving even 20-
year-olds in skirts and bright magenta
tank tops can play with the big boys.
Or something like that.
The other reason I hadn't noticed
the gender difference was because all
of the other photographers (with the
exception of Mr. Pushy-Pants) were
extremely kind to me. chatty and had
fascinating stories to tell about the
shows they've photographed over the
years. Andrew, from Planet Jackson

Hole in Wyoming, even asked me if I
had a business card so we could ex
change photos. He had long hair and
was wearing a matching knit hippie
pancho/gaucho pants and had
brought long underwear with him be
cause it had been snowing when he
left Jackson Hole. It was 75 degrees
and sunny in Vegas; I was afraid of
getting sunburnt.
My other friend was Tim. of the
rubber ducky fame. He wore striped
overalls, tie-dye. a motorcycle ban
dana, had graying chops, had been up
until four a.m. the night before shoot
ing the Dave/Umphrey's McGee
show and was off to photograph the
Fantasy and Fetish Ball immediately
following the Dave & Friends show. I
loved him immediately, and he hung
out with me, mostly 1 think because I
was one of the few photographers

who weren't taking themselves "very
seriously." and I was an attentive lis
tener.
The only downside was, with the
exception of The Shins and Dave
Matthews. I only heard bits and
pieces of the sets that 1 photographed.
It forced me to hear more music than
I probably would have otherwise, but
I also paid less attention to the music,
as I had to concentrate on focusing
the camera. I actually worked all day.
This is actually a job; people get paid
to do this on a daily basis. That con
cept blew me away.
Unfortunately, I don't think I'm
tall enough to be a professional pho
tographer; another common charac
teristic of the older white male pho
tographers was blessed height.
Maybe next time I'll just wear heels.
