## It was almost like Vegas; there were strippers 
### CASSIDY DeLINE INTERMISSION FOO 
The audience couldn't help but grin and
groove along with the Foo Fighters as the.) per
formed Friday night, l:\en with un arena lull of
dancing, drunken, screaming fans it was clear
that nobody was having as good of a time as the
performers themselves: Dave Cirohl was
pulling pranks and cracking jokes and drummer
Taylor Hawkins could not keep from beaming
through his workout-tape worthy drum sets.
With rainbows of confetti coating the floor
of the Oakland Arena, a pulsing performance
complete with male strippers and a llorescent
"W" stilling burning the eyes of the chanting
crowd, it would have been easy to believe that
the show was over when the illustrious mem
bers of Weezer took their bow.
But Dave Grohl wasn't about to have his
show stolen.
As he bounded on stage to let the crowd in
on the joke — he had paid for the strippers — it
was clear that no matter how well matched the
two bands were or how great Weezer s perfor
mance was.the night belonged to the Foo

lighters.
The Foo Fighters carried this momentum

and exultant attitude
through a majority of their
hits, including "Born to Flv."

their latest. "Best of You"
and "Nothing to Lose,"
while also digging 10 years
into the past with "This is a
Call." Even the hand's sin

largely forgotten "Orange

Oueen's "Tie Your Mother
Down" behind Grohl's insis
tent screaming and Hawkins
pulse-driven drumming.
Drawing from their new
release, their set list included
"In Your Honor." an an

on the campaign (rail with
John Kerry and featuring the

primal aggression that characterizes the first

disc of their latest release. The 1 avlor I law kins I

got to the slow, intricate songs
that compose the second,
acoustic disc of their latest album.
In between sets o( chart-top
ping songs, Grohl entertained the
audience in his usual fine form.
"You're not gonna see any
nipple piercings here," said
Cirohl. pausing to belch dramati
cally. "This is a (expletive) rock
hand." Then, in language too col
orful to print, he explained the
wonders of male anatomy, for
those who may have by chance
missed the six men stripping be
hind Weezer as they finished their
set.
The overwhelming appeal of
the Foo Fighfers-Weezer double
billing was evidence as both
played to a packed arena. This
