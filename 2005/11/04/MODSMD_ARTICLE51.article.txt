# Intermission goes to Vegas, Daily goes to Kansas City

### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION MIDWESTERNER-WANNABE 
When my dad found out I was going to
Kansas City, MO, he told me there were two
things I should be sure to do: 1) eat barbeque,
and 2) see Truman's home in the nearby town
of Independence. Being the meat-loving and

ever-curious student of politics that
I am, needless to say I took him

up on both suggestions.
And oh, how Kansas City
did indeed deliver on its
promise to be, we 11... let's
say "different" than
here.

As a life-long resident
of California, it's easy to

lose perspective on the
Midwest. But when you're

landing in Kansas City, there's

no need to worry about

that because any "per
spective" you might be
missing is then relent-

lessly jammed down
your throat—from the cow pasture immedi
ately adjacent to the city's airport all the way
to the paltry radio options (largely consisting
of '80s hair metal and/or country) that you're
forced to flip through while jamming out of
Dodge in your 2001 silver Celica rental to, uh,

another part of Dodge. |
But honestly, it wasn't until the encounter
with the sales clerk who couldn't spell
"straight" that the true nature of those in
good ole Show-Me State really started to sink
in: For better or worse, these people are indis
putably intent on doing things their way (or
perhaps "there wav" if you want to be

—j j
mean about it).

There might not be any bet
ter manifestation of this

unique character trait of
those stubborn Missouri-

ans than one of Ameri
ca's most down-to-earth

presidents to date, Harry
S. Truman. I got the
chance to tour his house

while in the area. Upon vis
iting his humble abode, I have

to admit the man was deter-

mined to never abandon
his small-town roots —
even if it meant living in a
place that sucks.

His residence is claustrophobically tiny, and
it's evident that he and his wife had absolutely
no sense of feng shui. As the park rangers
overseeing the place will attempt to convince
you (propaganda alert!), it is all because he
thought of himself not as a president, but as "a
man doing his duty for his country." Oh wow,

isn't that sweet... oh wait, I mean sappy.
But honestly, while every other politician who
has ever set foot in D.C. might claim to be the
quintessential "Washington outsider," Tru
man really was. Uh, except for that 10-year
stint in the Senate and a three-month tour as
Roosevelt's VP. But yeah, never mind that.
I don't mean to dwell on Truman, though,
as there was so much more to Kansas City (or
at least, the greater KC area) than that. 1
found an amazing barbeque place down by
the Kansas border—Jack Stack BBQ. Unfor
tunately, I drove some 45 minutes to get there,
only to find on the menu that there was anoth
er location of the same restaurant chain within
walking distance of my hotel Crap. I might
have felt dumb, but 1 felt a lot less dumb once
those memorable hickory-pit beans were sit
ting in front me. Mmm. City slickers could
never make anything that tasty... probably.
I also got to enjoy the annual spectacle
known as the Independence. MO, Halloween
parade. One of the benefits of being in such a
small community is that you get to see pretty
much everyone who matters in the town (the
mayor, the police chief and the local high
school marching band members) all at once,
and the parade is still only about five minutes
long. The other great thing is that everyone
drives really slow, which made it all the more
amusing to whip by them in my two-door
wannabe-sports car blasting Van Halen's

"Jump" as the downtown skyline slowly re
emerged in the distance.
So yeah, Kansas City... there really isn't a
place like it. I'm just still trying to determine
whether that's a good or bad thing.


This was once a live animal. Mmm.


Damn, that was heavy.

isn't that sweet... oh wait, I mean sappy.
But honestly, while every other politician who
has ever set foot in D.C. might claim to be the
quintessential "Washington outsider," Tru
man really was. Uh, except for that 10-year
stint in the Senate and a three-month tour as
Roosevelt's VP. But yeah, never mind that.
I don't mean to dwell on Truman, though,
as there was so much more to Kansas City (or
at least, the greater KC area) than that. 1
found an amazing barbeque place down by
the Kansas border—Jack Stack BBQ. Unfor
tunately, I drove some 45 minutes to get there,
only to find on the menu that there was anoth
er location of the same restaurant chain within
walking distance of my hotel Crap. I might
have felt dumb, but 1 felt a lot less dumb once
those memorable hickory-pit beans were sit
ting in front me. Mmm. City slickers could
never make anything that tasty... probably.
I also got to enjoy the annual spectacle
known as the Independence. MO, Halloween
parade. One of the benefits of being in such a
small community is that you get to see pretty
much everyone who matters in the town (the
mayor, the police chief and the local high
school marching band members) all at once,
and the parade is still only about five minutes
long. The other great thing is that everyone
drives really slow, which made it all the more
amusing to whip by them in my two-door
wannabe-sports car blasting Van Halen's

"Jump" as the downtown skyline slowly re
emerged in the distance.
So yeah, Kansas City... there really isn't a
place like it. I'm just still trying to determine
whether that's a good or bad thing.


This was once a live animal. Mmm.


Damn, that was heavy.
When my dad found out I was going to
Kansas City, MO, he told me there were two
things I should be sure to do: 1) eat barbeque,
and 2) see Truman's home in the nearby town
of Independence. Being the meat-loving and

ever-curious student of politics that
I am, needless to say I took him

up on both suggestions.
And oh, how Kansas City
did indeed deliver on its
promise to be, we 11... let's
say "different" than
here.

As a life-long resident
of California, it's easy to

lose perspective on the
Midwest. But when you're

landing in Kansas City, there's

no need to worry about

that because any "per
spective" you might be
missing is then relent-

lessly jammed down
your throat—from the cow pasture immedi
ately adjacent to the city's airport all the way
to the paltry radio options (largely consisting
of '80s hair metal and/or country) that you're
forced to flip through while jamming out of
Dodge in your 2001 silver Celica rental to, uh,

another part of Dodge. |
But honestly, it wasn't until the encounter
with the sales clerk who couldn't spell
"straight" that the true nature of those in
good ole Show-Me State really started to sink
in: For better or worse, these people are indis
putably intent on doing things their way (or
perhaps "there wav" if you want to be

—j j
mean about it).

There might not be any bet
ter manifestation of this

unique character trait of
those stubborn Missouri-

ans than one of Ameri
ca's most down-to-earth

presidents to date, Harry
S. Truman. I got the
chance to tour his house

while in the area. Upon vis
iting his humble abode, I have

to admit the man was deter-

mined to never abandon
his small-town roots —
even if it meant living in a
place that sucks.

His residence is claustrophobically tiny, and
it's evident that he and his wife had absolutely
no sense of feng shui. As the park rangers
overseeing the place will attempt to convince
you (propaganda alert!), it is all because he
thought of himself not as a president, but as "a
man doing his duty for his country." Oh wow,

isn't that sweet... oh wait, I mean sappy.
