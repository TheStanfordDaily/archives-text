## Roxy doesn't need Vegas to have her fun 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
So it goes without saying that The Daily was too cheap to send
me to Vegas with my fabulous editor gal pals. What else is new?
Thus, Roxy was left to make her own fun this weekend sans irre
sponsible gambling, booze and nipple tassels. I came out on top
of course, but I've got to tell you — it wasn't easy. If I weren't a
bonafide sex goddess, I can see how digging up a worthwhile
hookup would be all but impossible.
I admit I harp on this campus' utter lack of eroticism far too
much for my own good, but this week I think I've finally pin
pointed our collective problem: We lack all sense of sexual spon
taneity. You would think that such a repressed population would
express its lurking desires in more random, kinky, completely in-

appropriate ways. Instead, we choose to
do nothing. You realize of course that

the black squirrels on campus are having
at least five times as much sex as the aver-

age Stanford student. Perhaps its time
Vaden started supplying Kleenex in lieu of

condoms... you know, to dry our tears.
"But really what is there to do, Roxy?" you

ask. "I already sleep in my long-term boyfriend's
bed every night in Kimball; what more can you
ask for?"

Ah, young whippersnapper, you have much to
learn. Regardless of gender — whether you're of

the practically-married variety or just out for what
ever you can get on a Saturday night — I have a
<u... .u„. u„ ,l„ L.„.

tew suggestions that might just be the key to our
salvation. Let me start with a story:

This July, Roxy was beating the heat at

the Stanford Shopping Center when she
came upon a sinful red trench coat,
„l t I I »U TP ,1 I A

about knee length. Two months and

$300 later (including a cool $150 for

the requisite black come-fuck
me heels), 1 was click-clacking

my way to my perennial
hookup's abode in my

spanking-new coat and

not much else. His first
question when he

opened the door:
"Aren't you hot in that

thing?" He never saw it

coming. And 1 must confess, I i
had never seen it cumming quite

like that before ei
ther.

The moral: It's amazing what a little ingenu
ity can do. I'm not talking about some sac
charine-I-made-you-a-treasure-map-with-
clues-leading-to-a-romantic-dinner-in-the-
Quad bullshit. Friends shouldn't let friends
be this sappy, and under no circumstances
should anyone at any time spell out a crush's
name in candles.
What I'm talking about is less build up
and more throw down. That's right — the
kind of disorienting sexual encounter that
leaves mysterious bruises the morning after.
Every Stanford student had to meet a high

standard of creativity to even get here in the first place.
If you're already in an über-committed relationship, you prob
ably fall asleep every night next to each other in your sweat pants
and glasses, having beaten every

sensual impulse out

of one another
within the first sev
eral months. Wel
come to the

plateau, where
you can ei-
ther decide
M to be dull

together
for per-

haps the
rest of your

natural liyes,
or incite an

ugly train-wreck
of a breakup with the potential to ruin your grades, friendships
and future in general.

Who says you have to he like everyone else though? Why not
be the 'it' couple, still hot for each other after all these years? It
takes effort, I won't lie to you. First things first, download Chris
Isaak's "Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing." Done? Good. Now ladies,
next time you walk by a Victoria's Secret or Frederick's — hell,
next time you're surfing aimlesslv online and you come across

that sexy silky, nearly indistinguishable undergarment that
you doubt you could ever pull off—just go for it. Trust me.

most guys' list of requirements (yes, even your guy) start
and end with 1. Be naked and 2. Bring Beer. You can and
will pull it off. Resurrect you inner vixen. I say! Now guys,
if you want an encore of your lover's sexy new look, be

sure to appreciate it while the getting's good. Don't ask,
"What's that? How much did that cost? Are you feeling
okay?" or anything even remotely similar.

Something to chew on: If your love life has al
ready devolved into "Honey, I'm home!" famil
iarity, why not mix it up? Sure slow, meaningful
love-making a la Tenacious D can be something
special, hut so can romping around your dorm's
laundry room — you don't know an orgasm until
you've tried it on a running washing machine.
Rumble rumble. If this doesn't work (and I pity

you if it doesn't), why not throw some road head in

for good measure? Not only is it is a compelling
way to get a man to pull over for directions, but
it can also justify the ownership of a large SUV
as an appropriate arena for reciprocation.
Quickly, to those of you ill-suited for long-

winded DTRs and emotional intimacy (at least for

now), your penchant for random hookups doesn't always have
the run the same sordid, mind- (and sometimes body-)numbing
course. Oh believe me, I know how it goes. You meet your tem
porary mate at some sort of party or birthday dinner or what have

you. You make a feeble attempt at conversation, which ultimate
ly fails, but you both appreciate the effort and find the other

vaguely attractive so finally a move is made. The move mysteri-

ously translates into an awkward wordless tussle with a B

Nicholas Cage or Will Smith movie probably playing
jsomewhere in the background. Speaking as little as

you come to some sort of consensus about
F how far you both are willing to go. Often, the female
half of the liaison is at this point desperately looking for
an out, and thus reaches for the human equivalent of the

ejector button — the hand job. This emergency ma
neuver might as well be a wave goodbye, as the gen
tleman caller is quickly cleaned up and sent on his way
shortly thereafter.

Guys — wanna know how to get past this oth
erwise impenetrable barrier? You have to sell it. Why
should thN girl sac. ifice her weekend night and leave

her friends behind for you? When 1 think back on my extensive
history of random hookups, 1 can count the Hall of Famers on one
hand, and even out of these, there's only one or two 1 would read
ily repeat. What did these guys have in common? They weren't

too afraid of dam
aging their er
gonomic keyboards
and external hard
drives to clear their
desks in one fell
swoop. They
weren't too timid to
bounce off the
walls, knock over
furniture or tear
their precious J
Crew polos. Careful
is boring. And any
Stanford gal can get
boring any night of
the week and twice
on Sunday.

In short, now is the time
for reckless aban
don. If you don't

seize it, I promise Qj ves new meaning to the term "dirty
you'll regret it. | aundrY .» And how.
Don't blame me
when you wake 40-
years-old with matching his and hers towels and a Honda Civic,
crossing your fingers that TNT will play "Con Air" tonight so
your wife will give you a hand job.


You, too, could get this much ass, or show it, if you follow Roxy's simple tips for
some spontaneous Stanford sex.


I mean, it's called a Hummer. Don't pretend you haven't
thought of it.


Would you really rather have Kleenex than condoms? Roxy didn't think so.

Thus, Roxy was left to make her own fun this weekend sans irre
sponsible gambling, booze and nipple tassels. I came out on top
of course, but I've got to tell you — it wasn't easy. If I weren't a
bonafide sex goddess, I can see how digging up a worthwhile
hookup would be all but impossible.
I admit I harp on this campus' utter lack of eroticism far too
much for my own good, but this week I think I've finally pin
pointed our collective problem: We lack all sense of sexual spon
taneity. You would think that such a repressed population would
express its lurking desires in more random, kinky, completely in-

appropriate ways. Instead, we choose to
do nothing. You realize of course that

the black squirrels on campus are having
at least five times as much sex as the aver-

age Stanford student. Perhaps its time
Vaden started supplying Kleenex in lieu of

condoms... you know, to dry our tears.
"But really what is there to do, Roxy?" you

ask. "I already sleep in my long-term boyfriend's
bed every night in Kimball; what more can you
ask for?"

Ah, young whippersnapper, you have much to
learn. Regardless of gender — whether you're of

the practically-married variety or just out for what
ever you can get on a Saturday night — I have a
<u... .u„. u„ ,l„ L.„.

tew suggestions that might just be the key to our
salvation. Let me start with a story:

This July, Roxy was beating the heat at

the Stanford Shopping Center when she
came upon a sinful red trench coat,
„l t I I »U TP ,1 I A

about knee length. Two months and

$300 later (including a cool $150 for

the requisite black come-fuck
me heels), 1 was click-clacking

my way to my perennial
hookup's abode in my

spanking-new coat and

not much else. His first
question when he

opened the door:
"Aren't you hot in that

thing?" He never saw it

coming. And 1 must confess, I i
had never seen it cumming quite

like that before ei
ther.

The moral: It's amazing what a little ingenu
ity can do. I'm not talking about some sac
charine-I-made-you-a-treasure-map-with-
clues-leading-to-a-romantic-dinner-in-the-
Quad bullshit. Friends shouldn't let friends
be this sappy, and under no circumstances
should anyone at any time spell out a crush's
name in candles.
What I'm talking about is less build up
and more throw down. That's right — the
kind of disorienting sexual encounter that
leaves mysterious bruises the morning after.
Every Stanford student had to meet a high

standard of creativity to even get here in the first place.
If you're already in an über-committed relationship, you prob
ably fall asleep every night next to each other in your sweat pants
and glasses, having beaten every

sensual impulse out

of one another
within the first sev
eral months. Wel
come to the

plateau, where
you can ei-
ther decide
M to be dull

together
for per-

haps the
rest of your

natural liyes,
or incite an

ugly train-wreck
of a breakup with the potential to ruin your grades, friendships
and future in general.

Who says you have to he like everyone else though? Why not
be the 'it' couple, still hot for each other after all these years? It
takes effort, I won't lie to you. First things first, download Chris
Isaak's "Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing." Done? Good. Now ladies,
next time you walk by a Victoria's Secret or Frederick's — hell,
next time you're surfing aimlesslv online and you come across

that sexy silky, nearly indistinguishable undergarment that
you doubt you could ever pull off—just go for it. Trust me.

most guys' list of requirements (yes, even your guy) start
and end with 1. Be naked and 2. Bring Beer. You can and
will pull it off. Resurrect you inner vixen. I say! Now guys,
if you want an encore of your lover's sexy new look, be

sure to appreciate it while the getting's good. Don't ask,
"What's that? How much did that cost? Are you feeling
okay?" or anything even remotely similar.

Something to chew on: If your love life has al
ready devolved into "Honey, I'm home!" famil
iarity, why not mix it up? Sure slow, meaningful
love-making a la Tenacious D can be something
special, hut so can romping around your dorm's
laundry room — you don't know an orgasm until
you've tried it on a running washing machine.
Rumble rumble. If this doesn't work (and I pity

you if it doesn't), why not throw some road head in

for good measure? Not only is it is a compelling
way to get a man to pull over for directions, but
it can also justify the ownership of a large SUV
as an appropriate arena for reciprocation.
Quickly, to those of you ill-suited for long-

winded DTRs and emotional intimacy (at least for

now), your penchant for random hookups doesn't always have
the run the same sordid, mind- (and sometimes body-)numbing
course. Oh believe me, I know how it goes. You meet your tem
porary mate at some sort of party or birthday dinner or what have

you. You make a feeble attempt at conversation, which ultimate
ly fails, but you both appreciate the effort and find the other

vaguely attractive so finally a move is made. The move mysteri-

ously translates into an awkward wordless tussle with a B

Nicholas Cage or Will Smith movie probably playing
jsomewhere in the background. Speaking as little as

you come to some sort of consensus about
F how far you both are willing to go. Often, the female
half of the liaison is at this point desperately looking for
an out, and thus reaches for the human equivalent of the

ejector button — the hand job. This emergency ma
neuver might as well be a wave goodbye, as the gen
tleman caller is quickly cleaned up and sent on his way
shortly thereafter.

Guys — wanna know how to get past this oth
erwise impenetrable barrier? You have to sell it. Why
should thN girl sac. ifice her weekend night and leave

her friends behind for you? When 1 think back on my extensive
history of random hookups, 1 can count the Hall of Famers on one
hand, and even out of these, there's only one or two 1 would read
ily repeat. What did these guys have in common? They weren't

too afraid of dam
aging their er
gonomic keyboards
and external hard
drives to clear their
desks in one fell
swoop. They
weren't too timid to
bounce off the
walls, knock over
furniture or tear
their precious J
Crew polos. Careful
is boring. And any
Stanford gal can get
boring any night of
the week and twice
on Sunday.

In short, now is the time
for reckless aban
don. If you don't

seize it, I promise Qj ves new meaning to the term "dirty
you'll regret it. | aundrY .» And how.
Don't blame me
when you wake 40-
years-old with matching his and hers towels and a Honda Civic,
crossing your fingers that TNT will play "Con Air" tonight so
your wife will give you a hand job.


You, too, could get this much ass, or show it, if you follow Roxy's simple tips for
some spontaneous Stanford sex.


I mean, it's called a Hummer. Don't pretend you haven't
thought of it.

of course, but I've got to tell you — it wasn't easy. If I weren't a
bonafide sex goddess, I can see how digging up a worthwhile
hookup would be all but impossible.
I admit I harp on this campus' utter lack of eroticism far too
much for my own good, but this week I think I've finally pin
pointed our collective problem: We lack all sense of sexual spon
taneity. You would think that such a repressed population would
express its lurking desires in more random, kinky, completely in-

appropriate ways. Instead, we choose to
do nothing. You realize of course that

the black squirrels on campus are having
at least five times as much sex as the aver-

age Stanford student. Perhaps its time
Vaden started supplying Kleenex in lieu of

condoms... you know, to dry our tears.
"But really what is there to do, Roxy?" you

ask. "I already sleep in my long-term boyfriend's
bed every night in Kimball; what more can you
ask for?"

Ah, young whippersnapper, you have much to
learn. Regardless of gender — whether you're of

the practically-married variety or just out for what
ever you can get on a Saturday night — I have a
<u... .u„. u„ ,l„ L.„.

tew suggestions that might just be the key to our
salvation. Let me start with a story:

This July, Roxy was beating the heat at

the Stanford Shopping Center when she
came upon a sinful red trench coat,
„l t I I »U TP ,1 I A

about knee length. Two months and

$300 later (including a cool $150 for

the requisite black come-fuck
me heels), 1 was click-clacking

my way to my perennial
hookup's abode in my

spanking-new coat and

not much else. His first
question when he

opened the door:
"Aren't you hot in that

thing?" He never saw it

coming. And 1 must confess, I i
had never seen it cumming quite

like that before ei
ther.

The moral: It's amazing what a little ingenu
ity can do. I'm not talking about some sac
charine-I-made-you-a-treasure-map-with-
clues-leading-to-a-romantic-dinner-in-the-
Quad bullshit. Friends shouldn't let friends
be this sappy, and under no circumstances
should anyone at any time spell out a crush's
name in candles.
What I'm talking about is less build up
and more throw down. That's right — the
kind of disorienting sexual encounter that
leaves mysterious bruises the morning after.
Every Stanford student had to meet a high

standard of creativity to even get here in the first place.
If you're already in an über-committed relationship, you prob
ably fall asleep every night next to each other in your sweat pants
and glasses, having beaten every

sensual impulse out

of one another
within the first sev
eral months. Wel
come to the

plateau, where
you can ei-
ther decide
M to be dull

together
for per-

haps the
rest of your

natural liyes,
or incite an

ugly train-wreck
of a breakup with the potential to ruin your grades, friendships
and future in general.

Who says you have to he like everyone else though? Why not
be the 'it' couple, still hot for each other after all these years? It
takes effort, I won't lie to you. First things first, download Chris
Isaak's "Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing." Done? Good. Now ladies,
next time you walk by a Victoria's Secret or Frederick's — hell,
next time you're surfing aimlesslv online and you come across

that sexy silky, nearly indistinguishable undergarment that
you doubt you could ever pull off—just go for it. Trust me.

most guys' list of requirements (yes, even your guy) start
and end with 1. Be naked and 2. Bring Beer. You can and
will pull it off. Resurrect you inner vixen. I say! Now guys,
if you want an encore of your lover's sexy new look, be

sure to appreciate it while the getting's good. Don't ask,
"What's that? How much did that cost? Are you feeling
okay?" or anything even remotely similar.

Something to chew on: If your love life has al
ready devolved into "Honey, I'm home!" famil
iarity, why not mix it up? Sure slow, meaningful
love-making a la Tenacious D can be something
special, hut so can romping around your dorm's
laundry room — you don't know an orgasm until
you've tried it on a running washing machine.
Rumble rumble. If this doesn't work (and I pity

you if it doesn't), why not throw some road head in

for good measure? Not only is it is a compelling
way to get a man to pull over for directions, but
it can also justify the ownership of a large SUV
as an appropriate arena for reciprocation.
Quickly, to those of you ill-suited for long-

winded DTRs and emotional intimacy (at least for

now), your penchant for random hookups doesn't always have
the run the same sordid, mind- (and sometimes body-)numbing
course. Oh believe me, I know how it goes. You meet your tem
porary mate at some sort of party or birthday dinner or what have

you. You make a feeble attempt at conversation, which ultimate
ly fails, but you both appreciate the effort and find the other

vaguely attractive so finally a move is made. The move mysteri-

ously translates into an awkward wordless tussle with a B

Nicholas Cage or Will Smith movie probably playing
jsomewhere in the background. Speaking as little as

you come to some sort of consensus about
F how far you both are willing to go. Often, the female
half of the liaison is at this point desperately looking for
an out, and thus reaches for the human equivalent of the

ejector button — the hand job. This emergency ma
neuver might as well be a wave goodbye, as the gen
tleman caller is quickly cleaned up and sent on his way
shortly thereafter.

Guys — wanna know how to get past this oth
erwise impenetrable barrier? You have to sell it. Why
should thN girl sac. ifice her weekend night and leave

her friends behind for you? When 1 think back on my extensive
history of random hookups, 1 can count the Hall of Famers on one
hand, and even out of these, there's only one or two 1 would read
ily repeat. What did these guys have in common? They weren't

too afraid of dam
aging their er
gonomic keyboards
and external hard
drives to clear their
desks in one fell
swoop. They
weren't too timid to
bounce off the
walls, knock over
furniture or tear
their precious J
Crew polos. Careful
is boring. And any
Stanford gal can get
boring any night of
the week and twice
on Sunday.

In short, now is the time
for reckless aban
don. If you don't

seize it, I promise Qj ves new meaning to the term "dirty
you'll regret it. | aundrY .» And how.
Don't blame me
when you wake 40-
years-old with matching his and hers towels and a Honda Civic,
crossing your fingers that TNT will play "Con Air" tonight so
your wife will give you a hand job.


You, too, could get this much ass, or show it, if you follow Roxy's simple tips for
some spontaneous Stanford sex.


I mean, it's called a Hummer. Don't pretend you haven't
thought of it.


Would you really rather have Kleenex than condoms? Roxy didn't think so.
