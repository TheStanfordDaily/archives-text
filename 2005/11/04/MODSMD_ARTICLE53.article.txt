Best People:
Tim- the amazing Deadhead pho
tographer from Colorado who rode
his motorcycle all the way to Vegas
and said two nights before he'd had
"The best night in Utah of my life."
Andrew- the very sweet photogra
pher from Wyoming who brought
long underwear because it was
snowing when he left Jackson
Hole.
Reagan- the kickass female pho
tographer from "Spin," who had
only been working for "Spin" for
one day.
The taxi driver who told us that Cal
was a better school than Stanford
and more respected by companies
hiring employees.
The drunk woman in her '50s from
North Carolina. She was in Vegas
by herself, it was her birthday and
her drunk friends kept calling her
and she would make a huge show
of hanging up on them. She also
told us she'd give us a dollar if we
asked the cowboy standing a few
people up in line from us where he
was going. And she informed us
that we would find a new man in
four minutes, so don't worry about
the bad ones that get away.
Stevie- One of the Big Hassle PR
guys who saved our collective ass
and provided one of the most en
tertaining 11:30 p.m. phone calls
ever.
Trey Anastasio- for being way too
cute and sweet. Neither one of us
knew much about him going into
the festival, and we both left with a
large crush.
Bed-Bugs Lady- At the first HoJo
a woman was complaining that
there were bugs in her bed to the
desk clerk.
