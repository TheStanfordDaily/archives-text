# Uranium to be processed
## Iran sends mixed signals concerning nuclear agenda 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — Iran
is sending conflicting signals to an
international community con
cerned about it& nuclear agenda,
granting U.N. inspectors access to a
secret military site but also saying
it would process a new batch of
uranium that could be used to
make atomic weapons, diplomats
said Wednesday.
The two developments showed
that Iran was unwilling to meet inter
national calls to give up enrichment
and all linked activities even while
casting itself as conciliatory and
ready to cooperate with Internation
al Atomic Energy Agency inspectors
probing its past nuclear activities.
The last meeting of the 35-na
tion lAEA board told Iran in Sep
tember to suspend all uranium en
richment-related activities, includ
ing conversion, and to give agency
experts access to research, experts,
locations and documents or face re
ferral to the U.N Security Council.
Iran has stopped at conversion
but insists it has the right to the next
stage — enrichment. Uranium 'en
richment can produce either nu
clear energy or the fissile core of
weapons.
The diplomats said lAEA ex
perts were allowed to revisit the
high-security military site in
Parchin as they try to establish
whether Tehran has a secret nu
clear weapons program.
Parchin has been linked by the
United States and other nations to
alleged experiments linked to nu
clear arms. The lAEA had for
months been trying to follow up on
a visit in January for further checks
of buildings and areas within the

sprawling military complex as it
looks for traces of radioactivity.
That visit revealed no such
traces.
One of the diplomats said that
over the past few days lAEA in
spectors "gained access to build
ings" previously out of bounds to
them.
The diplomat, who is close to the
agency, said environmental swipes
were taken from objects in the build
ings and would be analyzed at lAEA
laboratories.
If those swipes reveal minute
amounts of radioactivity, they
would strengthen suspicions of nu
clear-related work at Parchin.
Because Parchin is run by the
country's armed forces, such a dis
covery would weaken Iranian argu
ments that its nuclear programs are
strictly nonmilitary.
That, in turn, would strengthen
sentiment that Tehran be referred
to the Security Council for breach
ing the Nuclear NonproliTeration
Treaty as early as Nov. 24, when the
lAEA board of governors has
scheduled its next meeting. The
swipe results are expected before
then.
U.S. intelligence officials said
last year that a specially secured
site on the Parchin complex, about
20 miles southeast of Tehran, may
be used in research on nuclear
arms, specifically in making high
explosive components for use in
such weapons.
On Wednesday. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said military
action against Iran was not being
considered, but he said Tehran
