## Luxury retirement home holds grand opening New multi-million dollar senior residence enjoys many built-in Stanford connections 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night marked the grand opening of Palo Alto's Classic Resi
dence by Hyatt, a luxurious retirement home that offers continuing care
for its residents. Though the center officially opened last night, people
have been living in the complex since June.
The $370 million facility is located on Sand Hill Road, across the
street from the Stanford Shopping Center.Though there is no formal re
lationship with the University, the continuing care retirement communi
ty is located on 22.5 acres of Stanford-owned land that has been leased
to Classic Residence by Hyatt for 75 years.
In addition, officials at the facility have been working with Stanford
to provide some of the programs at the center. Lecturers from the
Hoover Institution will give talks for the residents once a month, said
Barry Johnson, sales director for the Palo Alto Classic Residence by
Hyatt.

Also, about 40 per
cent of the community
has some sort of affilia
tion with Stanford. Resi
dents include alumni,
faculty and staff and
other supporters of the
University.
Since its founding in
1987 by Penny Pritzker,
MBA '84, Classic Resi
dence by Hyatt has
owned and operated up
scale senior living com
munities from coast-to
coast; there are currently
18 facilities around the
country, including three
in California.
Johnson explained
why Palo Alto was cho
sen to be a site for this
kind of retirement com
munity.
"The population in
the United States is
growing older dramati-

"I know many of the
people living here
they are my parents'
friends, so I want them
to live well. Opening
[the Hyatt] here, in
Palo Alto, is the high
light of my career."

cally and on local levels there are almost crushing needs for housing for
seniors with a service component to it,"he said."Palo Alto isn't immune
to that. When we started here, all the senior citizen houses were full and
had long waiting lists. Palo Alto was also very attractive because there are
large numbers of age and income-qualified people in the area."
Johnson went on to explain the criteria used in determining the site
for Classic Residence by Hvatt facilities.
"To qualify for senior housing, people or at least one member of a
couple, have to be 62 or older," he said. "Also, it costs a certain amount of
money to live in our community and potential residents have to be able
to afford the costs in order to receive the services and enjoy the ameni
ties we provide."
In addition to offering continuing care, the Palo Alto facility also in
cludes assisted living and skilled nursing care for residents that may de
velop health problems while living in the community. There are 388 in
dependent living residences, 38 assisted living residences, 24 memory
support suites and 44 skilled nursing suites.
The Hyatt has all the amenities of a vacation resort, replete with a
pool, fitness center and spa.There is also a library and computer resource
center along with an art studio and a beauty salon/barbershop.
Life at this facility, while certainly luxurious and comfortable, is also
very expensive. Most residents must pay an initial fee of about $ 1 million

Last night marked the grand opening of Palo Alto's Classic Resi
dence by Hyatt, a luxurious retirement home that offers continuing care
for its residents. Though the center officially opened last night, people
have been living in the complex since June.
The $370 million facility is located on Sand Hill Road, across the
street from the Stanford Shopping Center.Though there is no formal re
lationship with the University, the continuing care retirement communi
ty is located on 22.5 acres of Stanford-owned land that has been leased
to Classic Residence by Hyatt for 75 years.
In addition, officials at the facility have been working with Stanford
to provide some of the programs at the center. Lecturers from the
Hoover Institution will give talks for the residents once a month, said
Barry Johnson, sales director for the Palo Alto Classic Residence by
Hyatt.

Also, about 40 per
cent of the community
has some sort of affilia
tion with Stanford. Resi
dents include alumni,
faculty and staff and
other supporters of the
University.
Since its founding in
1987 by Penny Pritzker,
MBA '84, Classic Resi
dence by Hyatt has
owned and operated up
scale senior living com
munities from coast-to
coast; there are currently
18 facilities around the
country, including three
in California.
Johnson explained
why Palo Alto was cho

cally and on local levels there are almost crushing needs for housing for
seniors with a service component to it,"he said."Palo Alto isn't immune
to that. When we started here, all the senior citizen houses were full and
had long waiting lists. Palo Alto was also very attractive because there are
large numbers of age and income-qualified people in the area."
Johnson went on to explain the criteria used in determining the site
for Classic Residence by Hvatt facilities.
"To qualify for senior housing, people or at least one member of a
couple, have to be 62 or older," he said. "Also, it costs a certain amount of
money to live in our community and potential residents have to be able
to afford the costs in order to receive the services and enjoy the ameni
ties we provide."
In addition to offering continuing care, the Palo Alto facility also in
cludes assisted living and skilled nursing care for residents that may de
velop health problems while living in the community. There are 388 in
dependent living residences, 38 assisted living residences, 24 memory
support suites and 44 skilled nursing suites.
The Hyatt has all the amenities of a vacation resort, replete with a
pool, fitness center and spa.There is also a library and computer resource
center along with an art studio and a beauty salon/barbershop.
Life at this facility, while certainly luxurious and comfortable, is also
very expensive. Most residents must pay an initial fee of about $ 1 million
