## El Centro Chicano celebrates Day of the Dead 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
El Centro Chicano and MEChA
will be hosting the Carnaval de los
Muertos tonight at the Old Union
Courtyard to celebrate the Day of the

Dead. The Carnaval will bring to a
close a week of commemorating the
lives of those who have passed away.
The Day of the Dead, or El Dia de
los Muertos, was originally an Aztec
holiday during which people remem
bered their deceased loved ones. With

the coming of Christianity, the festival
came to be associated with All Souls
Day, which falls traditionally on Nov. 2
and used to be a pagan ritual in Europe.
The holiday at Stanford began last
Friday with the creation of an altar to
call to the spirits of loved ones. The

altar-building ceremony was conclud
ed with an all-night vigil of song and
prayer.
"The altar is in the El Centro
lounge, and it'll be up until the end of
the celebration, Saturday morning,"
said Daniel Herrera, a program direc
tor for El Centro Chicano."The altar is
open to anyone. It's a space for people
to hang out and pray or to leave an of
fering for someone who's passed on."
"People bring in food to feed the
spirits who come by and visit the altar
or something that reminds them of a
loved one," he continued. "It's be
lieved that if you put that there, the
spirit of your loved one will find it. It's
not so much of a solemn holiday, but
more of a celebration. In a quite literal
sense, you're having the spirits cele
brate with you."
Hie main event of the Day of the
Dead is the Carnaval, which will fea
ture food and live music.There will also
be a haunted house, arts and crafts and
face-painting for kids, many of whom
are from the Barrio Assistance tutoring
program.The night will culminate in a
final ceremony to honor the dead and a
performance by Los Soneros del Este.
a group that performs traditional music
from southeastern Mexico that is often
associated with the Day of the Dead.
Gabriel Erandi Rico, a second year
Ethnic Studies graduate student at
Berkeley, gave a lecture about the ori
gins of the holiday.
"For Mexicans, death is not some
thing that's necessarily feared," Rico
said. "It's not something that's neces
sarily in the occult, something macabre
that you don't talk about. It's some
thing that's embraced and celebrated
and played with. And the reason why
