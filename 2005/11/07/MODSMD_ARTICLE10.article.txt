## Warning: Tinfoil nipples are too hot to handle 
### 
In addition to my litany of attractive
qualities — namely a quick wit and
large breasts — I now have a halt
ing limp that causes me to shuffle from
side to side like Stumpy, the Peg-
Legged Pirate.
The immediate cause of this injury
was slipping on my flip-flop and
falling down a flight of stairs, a context
that frames me as a bumbling, grace
less idiot. So if anyone asks why I'm
dragging around my leg like a dead
weight, I just tell them that my feet
were shot off in 'Nam. That usually
shuts them up.
The fact of the matter is that I was
running down the stairs in order to
borrow a blonde wig for my Femßot
Halloween costume. For those of you
who have never seen "Austin Powers,"
a Femßot is a robot-woman who se
duces men and shoots bullets out of
her nipples. I couldn't find anyone
who owned such weapons of mass de
struction (Iraq refused to return my
calls),so I created my own nipple guns
out of tinfoil and pinned them to a
purple negligee. I assure you that they
were still extremely dangerous —
while performing the dance step
known as the "Crunk," I accidentally
poked a young gentleman in the eye
with a nipple gun and severed his
cornea. Sorry, friend.
In the end, all that drama was worth
it because my costume was, in the im
mortal words of Thomas Jefferson,
"f***ing hot." I decided to commemo
rate the occasion by changing my Face
book picture to a photo of the Femßot,
and within seconds I had 2,435 new
friend requests. Most of them were
from men who listed "porn" as an in
terest, job and favorite book.
But as much as I treasured my new
found popularity, it made me question
a) the apparently supernatural powers
of a blonde wig and purple lingerie and
b) the role of appearances on this cam
pus. It also made me wonder if I should
spend the next three hours poking
men with brooding artist/actor/musi
cian profile photos, the answer to
which was a resounding "Yes!"
I have often heard it said that the
students here are not the most attrac
tive lot, especially compared to say,
UC-Santa Barbara, where one can
submit a Glamour Shot in lieu of an
application for admission. One honest
chump went so far as to say that the
main reason why Stanford has a non
existent dating scene is because the
alpha males assume they will find
much more qualified candidates for
TVophy Wife once they graduate. Why
waste time trying to pursue anything
other than a hookup when you think
you can do much better?
I have to admit that I was a little of
fended by this comment. Personally, I
think I would make an excellent Tro
phy Wife. I can cook, clean, bear chil
dren and carry out an illicit affair with
the pool boy. I can also look hot when
I want to, as evidenced by the Femßot
experiment. But sometimes I don't
want to. Why? Because I am busy
doing other things, like writing
scathing social commentary or work
ing at corporate headquarters or mak
ing tinfoil nipples.
In other words, I don't think that
Stanford attracts the shallow end of
the beauty gene pool; I think there are
simply a lot of people around here who
choose to spend their time doing
something other than making them
selves look pretty. Not that there's any
thing wrong with those of us who do
spend hours trying to find a competent
hairdresser and end up with Jane, the
Cracked-Out Stylist With No Thumbs,
and then leave the salon with hair that
looks like shaved-off pubes haphaz
ardly glued to a bald man's scalp. You'll
be hearing from my lawyer, Jane.
The take-home point here is that
looks are quite possibly the most im
portant component of a successful life.
Perhaps we should all step away from
our computers and try to look a little
more appetizing in order to jump-start
the social scene and pursue the Amer
ican dream of becoming a Trophy Wife
or Husband. Look for me now in a lec
ture hall near you, staring submissively
out the window and dreaming about
the things a man will one day be able to
buy for me.
I'll be the blonde with a limp.

that frames me as a bumbling, grace
less idiot. So if anyone asks why I'm
dragging around my leg like a dead
weight, I just tell them that my feet
were shot off in 'Nam. That usually
shuts them up.
The fact of the matter is that I was
running down the stairs in order to
borrow a blonde wig for my Femßot
Halloween costume. For those of you
who have never seen "Austin Powers,"
a Femßot is a robot-woman who se
duces men and shoots bullets out of
her nipples. I couldn't find anyone
who owned such weapons of mass de
struction (Iraq refused to return my
calls),so I created my own nipple guns
out of tinfoil and pinned them to a
purple negligee. I assure you that they
were still extremely dangerous —
while performing the dance step
known as the "Crunk," I accidentally
poked a young gentleman in the eye
with a nipple gun and severed his
cornea. Sorry, friend.
In the end, all that drama was worth
it because my costume was, in the im
mortal words of Thomas Jefferson,
"f***ing hot." I decided to commemo
rate the occasion by changing my Face
book picture to a photo of the Femßot,
and within seconds I had 2,435 new
friend requests. Most of them were
from men who listed "porn" as an in
terest, job and favorite book.
But as much as I treasured my new
found popularity, it made me question
a) the apparently supernatural powers
of a blonde wig and purple lingerie and
b) the role of appearances on this cam
pus. It also made me wonder if I should
spend the next three hours poking
men with brooding artist/actor/musi
cian profile photos, the answer to
which was a resounding "Yes!"
I have often heard it said that the
students here are not the most attrac
tive lot, especially compared to say,
UC-Santa Barbara, where one can
submit a Glamour Shot in lieu of an
application for admission. One honest
chump went so far as to say that the
main reason why Stanford has a non
existent dating scene is because the
alpha males assume they will find
much more qualified candidates for
TVophy Wife once they graduate. Why
waste time trying to pursue anything
other than a hookup when you think
you can do much better?
I have to admit that I was a little of
fended by this comment. Personally, I
think I would make an excellent Tro
phy Wife. I can cook, clean, bear chil
dren and carry out an illicit affair with
the pool boy. I can also look hot when
I want to, as evidenced by the Femßot
experiment. But sometimes I don't
want to. Why? Because I am busy
doing other things, like writing
scathing social commentary or work
ing at corporate headquarters or mak
ing tinfoil nipples.
In other words, I don't think that
Stanford attracts the shallow end of
the beauty gene pool; I think there are
simply a lot of people around here who
choose to spend their time doing
something other than making them
selves look pretty. Not that there's any
thing wrong with those of us who do
spend hours trying to find a competent
hairdresser and end up with Jane, the
Cracked-Out Stylist With No Thumbs,
and then leave the salon with hair that
looks like shaved-off pubes haphaz
ardly glued to a bald man's scalp. You'll
be hearing from my lawyer, Jane.
The take-home point here is that
looks are quite possibly the most im
portant component of a successful life.
Perhaps we should all step away from
our computers and try to look a little
more appetizing in order to jump-start
the social scene and pursue the Amer
ican dream of becoming a Trophy Wife
or Husband. Look for me now in a lec
ture hall near you, staring submissively
out the window and dreaming about
the things a man will one day be able to
buy for me.
I'll be the blonde with a limp.

In addition to my litany of attractive
qualities — namely a quick wit and
large breasts — I now have a halt
ing limp that causes me to shuffle from
side to side like Stumpy, the Peg-
Legged Pirate.
The immediate cause of this injury
was slipping on my flip-flop and
falling down a flight of stairs, a context
that frames me as a bumbling, grace
less idiot. So if anyone asks why I'm
dragging around my leg like a dead
weight, I just tell them that my feet
were shot off in 'Nam. That usually
shuts them up.
