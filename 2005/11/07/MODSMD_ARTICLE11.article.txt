# Et tu, Brute?
## Students put on play, explore the mind of a serial killer 
### MARISSA KLEIN 
Murder, rape and mayhem consumed the stage in
"Roberto Zucco," the Stanford Drama Depart
ment's latest production that ran from Nov. 2 to 5.
Written by contemporary French playwright Bernard-Marie
Koltes and directed by Stanford master's of fine arts student
Ljubi Matic, the show explored alienation in a materialistic,
self-interested modern society where people must use others
— or be used themselves.
The anti-hero, Roberto Zucco, committed horrific crimes
of passion, including killing his parents. The character is
based on Roberto Succo, an Italian serial killer who roamed
France and Italy in the 1980s and was a "psychotic, compul
sive liar," according to an article published Sept. 25,2004 by
the British Broadcasting Corporation.
But Zucco's charisma and rejection of the shallow values
of those around him rendered him somewhat sympathetic.
Although a natural response to his actions may have been
horror and the need to dissociate oneself from the intense
subject matter, the actors had to set aside their personal val
ues and internalize their characters.
"We had to try not to judge them and to find the truth of
what was behind them," says senior Chris Ryan, who played
Roberto Zucco. "It was easy to point the finger or just to say
he was crazy. We wanted to try to distance ourselves and to
marginalize them, but we couldn't do that."
Rvan adds that he and the cast had to convey loss and

hopelessness as primary components of their roles.
"You couldn't judge them and you couldn't show con
tempt, but you had to push yourself to get into the mind and
body of the character," Ryan says. "[Zucco] didn't just want
to just wreak havoc. What did he think and feel?"
Costumes, set design, props and lighting helped the actors
enter their characters' worlds. The production design was the
most striking technical element, setting the tone of stark des
peration. A raised platform across the stage provided ample
opportunity for innovative staging and creative use of space.
The high physical demands of the play proved trying for
the 15-person cast, according to Ryan.
"Movement, violence and physicality were the most diffi
cult." he explains. "The biggest challenge was trying to play
these high emotions but to do it safely."
Another difficulty was the fast-paced schedule in which
the show was produced. Although the play was selected last
spring, the actors had only a month to rehearse.
"We didn't really feel rushed, but we didn't ease into it ei
ther," Ryan says.
But working on such a tight schedule and spending sev
eral hours a night rehearsing can create close ties between
cast members quite quickly.The ability to bond with a diverse
group of peers is another benefit of acting in a large ensem
ble show.
"I got the opportunity to work with over a dozen incred
ible actors, only a few of whom 1 had worked with before."
says sophomore Alex Mallory. "It was great to be a part of a

mixture of Ram's I lead regulars with StanShakes veterans,
dedicated drama majors and English, computer science and
chemical engineering majors...l never quite realized that
there were other people who love theatre as much as 1 do,
and' Roberto Zucco' has made me a dozen fantastic, theater
crazy friends and companions in future endeavors."
In addition, the intense subject matter was a welcome act
ing exercise for other cast members. Mallory says. Because
the cast is so large, some characters appeared onstage only
briefly as Zucco's victims.
"The opportunity to die onstage does not come along very
often," Mallory remarks. "My character, the Child, had only
10 lines and appeared for only 10 minutes of the show, and yet
played a significant part in illuminating Zucco's reaction to
the world around him."
"Roberto Zucco" also tested the audience members by
challenging assumptions about their community and them
selves. The jarring violence — which is at once realistic and
artistic — is depicted in startling honesty that does not shy
away from the gritty underside of life that one rarely encoun
ters somewhere like Stanford.
"The idea was to speak to the Stanford community." Ryan
comments. "Here its such an idyllic, ivory tower. People
think that something like Roberto Zucco' could never hap
pen here. We're not trying to say that there's a murderer on
the Stanford campus or something, but we're trying to say
that there are passions like this that are in humanity and are
possible in everyone." he adds.
