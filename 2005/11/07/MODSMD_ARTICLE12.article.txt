Rocketbook provides the Spark Notes of the 21st cen
tury — classic literature study guides delivered to you on
animated*DVD.The company takes digitization to anoth
er level as it merges paper with pixels. Unlike existing on
line materials that rely solely on text. Rocketbook em
ploys various visual and audio stimuli to deliver an ani
mated "Pride and Prejudice" or "Beowulf."The question
is whether such a shortcut will wipe out all need for read
ing. period.
"I would be pretty skeptical of using it,"says freshman
Javier Fernandez. "I would be afraid that it would become
a habit and I'd lose my ability to absorb information
through reading."
Fernandez is not alone in his less-than-welcoming re
ception, as many bloggers have already lamented the po
tentially discouraging effects of Rocketbook.
Rocketbook founder Steve Emerson, however, deems
such questions as misdirected. "We're trying to help stu
dents read, not hinder them," Emerson says. "We're talking
about a generation of students raised with TV. high speed
internet and video games. You take students like that and
drop a 400 page Jane Austen in front of them and they just
don't get it. It's not visually stimulating."
What's needed to stimulate such a readership is a break
from traditional text, according to Emerson.
"The seed of the company is that it doesn't make a lot
of sense to give a student, who doesn't like to read, more to
read in the form of Cliffs Notes or Spark Notes," Emerson
explains. "They'll read them, be bored by them and never
make it to the original material."

At Rocketbook.a team of visual artists and graphic de
signers collaborate to illustrate an entire novel into visual
packets. Each DVD contains an animated storyline while a
speaker guides listeners through summary, analysis and
pop-up questions.
"The content on the screen doesn't remain static." Emer
son says. "There is something constantly happening."
Even Fernandez consents to the perks of medium.
"I can definitely see how someone telling you how it's
happening plus flash animations help readers to under
stand." Fernandez says. "It's like a mixture between watch
ing a movie and reading condensed Spark Notes."
78 universities, including Stanford, sell Rocketbook
products on their campuses, according to Emerson. The
products have also been adopted by the New Jersey pub
lic school system and at least a dozen independent retail
ers. and they have also been shipped abroad to Canada.
The company has grown exponentially this past month,
Emerson says.
"These are fantastic stories that deserve to be shared in
any way possible," he continues. "Of course. I'm not so
naive as to say that there won't be students out there who
are going to use this and not read the book. Hut I say these
students wouldn't have read the book anyway. At least
they'll know the story and be better students."
The product is also meant for those with literacy prob
lems. Emerson contends that behind publicity acclaiming
America's improved education. literacy still remains a crit
ical obstacle.
"The reality is that there are many teenagers and adults
in this country that struggle with reading and literature."
Emerson says. A portion of the company's proceeds is do
nated to the International Dyslexia Association to help

those with reading
disabilities.

etbook's practicali
ty is apparently not
so picture-perfect
With each DVD
costing $9.yy. the
product suffers in
accessibility com
pared to existing
study guides that
post their material
online for free.
I still think I
would just use Spar
k Notes because I'm
not willing to pull
out $10 every time,"
Fernandez says.
Anne Kim, a
junior, argues that
the DVD format
actually entails too
many inconven
iences.

"It's not accessible anywhere like notes online are," she
says. "I'd have to earn' it to wherever I'm going and also
need a DVD player to watch it."
Although Rocketbook is still breaking the ice with some
users, its essence remains solid: to bridge two coexisting but
separate spheres — the hyped digital world of the readers
and the stagnant, text-based realm of classic literature.
