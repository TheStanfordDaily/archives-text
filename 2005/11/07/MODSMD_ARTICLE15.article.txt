# Michael Brown redecorates your home
## 
### 
Recently, former Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency director Michael
Brown's e-mails have been made public. I
have a certain amount of sympathy for the guy,
because you never want your e-mails to be made
public. People then get to make fun of you for
your poor misspellings, terrible grammar and roy
ally screwing up the relief effort of a hurricane.
While many of the e-mails that were directed
to him described the horrible situation in New
Orleans — the levees breaking, the Superdome
breaking, etc. — Michael Brown remained calm
and declared himself a "fashion god."
It seems our former FEMA director was
hired because of his keen fashion sense. Many of
his e-mails, surprisingly, did not deal with the
topic of the hurricanes per se, but were about his
wardrobe and his insecurities in front of the
camera.
I don't think he was being insensitive or igno
rant of the disaster, I just think that while he was

looking at the images of the hurricane victims on
TV, he was wearing pumps, bell bottoms, aviator
sunglasses, was taking a long drag on a cigarette
and saying "Hurricane victims make me look
FA AAA AT."
I'm willing to give this man the benefit of the
doubt here. Maybe his e-mails are a different side
of him than the public side. Maybe this man was
calm and composed on his cell phone, explaining


Chris
Holt
Holt's Harangue
"The levee broke, we've got prob
lems at the Superdome and my
handbag doesn't match my belt."
I think people might be overre
acting when they say that he was
being, well, an idiot. He just cares
about fashion. OK? That's perfectly
fine. It's not like you've suddenly
hired Christian Dior or Paul Frank
to run a war. "Camo was sooo Viet
nam. I see all of you in black, some
thing that goes with red easily."
His aides weren't exactly helping.
In his many e-mails on the subject,
one of his aides suggested to him.
"ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES" to
make him look more hardworking.
He's working hard, alright — coor
dinating an outfit and looking "fabu
lous" takes time when you are a
high-profile celebrity like the
FEM A director. Ile must know what
Paris Hilton feels like — I smell a
new Fox show.
While his aides were discussing
with him the possibility of police
looting, he probably retorted that
there was nothing in those people's
closets worth salvaging, what with
the "awful pants-suit combination"
he kept seeing.
I mean, he's not a complete
moron. In his e-mails, he was pre
sented with the problem of FEMA's
policy on rescuing pets. He realized
that something had to be done be
cause people were either too loyal or

too stupid to leave their animals. He
wrote in an e-mail,"Please get some
sort of plan together to start han
dling the pets." See, he only had to be
informed of the problem 10 times
and then decided to have someone
else come up with the plan. That's
the sign of a good lawyer.
In his e-mails, he also asked
whether or not he could "quit now"
and "go home." This may have been
taken out of context, but it at least
shows that the director of FEMA
probably didn't have his head in the
game. And dude, I feel ya. I mean,
I'm a senior. I've totally checked out
on some things. Like, I'm barely writ
ing this column anymore; I usually
just have my cadre of ghostwriters
do it. So I got your back, it's not like,
you know, thousands of people died
because you "checked out" and did
n't do your damn job. And when I
don't do mine, I sometimes let my
sarcasm slip and actually say what I
mean. 1
Now let's just keep in mind what
FEMA actually stands for. It is not
the FASHION EMERGEN( Y
MANAGEMENT AGENCY.
Brown is not part of the Fab Five, and
although he probably has plenty of
home decorating options in the wake
of the hurricane, that's not why he
was hired. He was the man who
would have been in charge of the
emergency response if. God forbid, a
terrorist attack occurred. This is the
man who would have been frantically
trying to figure out tie combinations
and e-mailing his people about that
rather than. I dunno, doing his job.
But people have not been asking

the right questions. For instance:
"What kind of experience does this
man have?" Brown served as the un
dersecretary of the National Inci
dent Management System and the
Nuclear Response Team.
So this is the man that was. at one
time,partly responsible fora nuclear
incident response.There weren't any
nuclear incidents, so he was either
really good at his job or didn't have
any experience handling it. But he
did have experience with FEMA
and hurricanes prior to Katrina. In
2004, FEMA sent Miami-Dade
County an estimated $30 million in
disaster relief funds for Hurricane
Frances.
Unfortunately, Miami-Dade was
relatively unaffected by Frances. He
claimed that there were no serious
mistakes, but the South Florida Sun-
Sentinel investigated, found him re
sponsible and called for his removal.
Let's think about this here. If LA got
attacked, this guy might send relief
funds to Dayton, Ohio. That is. of
course, if he was able to decide
whether to wear the sleeves rolled
up or not.
1 Cronyism has been called an in
evitable product of the system but a
thousand deaths is not an "inevitable
product." It will be years till we truly
understand the scope of this disaster
and how ineffective this administra
tion was.

Chris's team of ghostwriters would
like to point out he has no fashion
sense. Send complaints to cholt@stan
ford.edu.
