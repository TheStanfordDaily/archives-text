# Michael Brown redecorates your home

### 
Recently, former Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency director Michael
Brown's e-mails have been made public. I
have a certain amount of sympathy for the guy,
because you never want your e-mails to be made
public. People then get to make fun of you for
your poor misspellings, terrible grammar and roy
ally screwing up the relief effort of a hurricane.
While many of the e-mails that were directed
to him described the horrible situation in New
Orleans — the levees breaking, the Superdome
breaking, etc. — Michael Brown remained calm
and declared himself a "fashion god."
It seems our former FEMA director was
hired because of his keen fashion sense. Many of
his e-mails, surprisingly, did not deal with the
topic of the hurricanes per se, but were about his
wardrobe and his insecurities in front of the
camera.
I don't think he was being insensitive or igno
rant of the disaster, I just think that while he was

looking at the images of the hurricane victims on
TV, he was wearing pumps, bell bottoms, aviator
sunglasses, was taking a long drag on a cigarette
and saying "Hurricane victims make me look
FA AAA AT."
I'm willing to give this man the benefit of the
doubt here. Maybe his e-mails are a different side
of him than the public side. Maybe this man was
calm and composed on his cell phone, explaining
