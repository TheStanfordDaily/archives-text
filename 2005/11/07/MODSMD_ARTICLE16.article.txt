# Did you say feminism?
## 
### 
If you're at a dinner party and conver
sation is stalling, try mentioning fem
inism. I guarantee that you'll get
some strong reactions. The term "femi
nism" has taken on so many connota
tions over the years that it's hard to know
what exactly it means; unfortunately, it
often elicits the image of a militant, male
bashing woman who doesn't shave.
People will try to explain a woman's
feminism by attacking her personally:
She must be frustrated, single, lesbian,
etc. Some — men usually — will also
put forth the argument that equality was
attained at least 40 years ago, so why are
feminists persisting in their belligerent
attitudes?
But has equality been attained? What
are gender relations like nowadays? Ac
cording to The New York Times' colum
nist Maureen Dowd, in some ways not
that different from the 19505. Courting
strategies are pretty much unchanged.
Apparently, guys like to "hunt," but hate
to be chased, so women have to brush up

on the "tricks of the trade": an airy
laugh, a toss of the hair, hatting eyelids.
Women's magazines help them in this
endeavor by publishing the same articles
month after month: "200 ways to look
hot." "10 strategies to get and keep your
man," etc.
Equality of pay was one of the main
themes of the feminist movement in the
19605. Today, although it has still not
been achieved, people seem bored of the
topic. The inequality is accepted almost
complacently — even by women. Ac
cording to Dowd, there is now a term for
a woman's inferior pay: "girl money."

Are men attracted to powerful women
or not? Several studies suggest that men
are intimidated by them. For example,
Dowd cites a University of Michigan psy
chology study using college undergradu
ates which suggests that men looking for
long-term relationships would rather
marry women in subordinate jobs than
women who are supervisors. Men think
that women with important jobs are more
likely to cheat on them.
TTie article also refers to a 2005 report
by researchers at four British universi
ties, which indicates that a high I.Q. ham
pers a woman's chance to marry, while it
is a plus for men. The prospect for mar
riage increased by 35 percent for guys
for each 16-point increase in 1.Q.; for
women, there is a 40 percent drop for
each 16-point rise.
Statistics and studies aside, there are
day-to-day situations which make me
wonder about the state of male-female

equality and gender relations. At the
end of the summer. I was watching a
women's U.S. Open match (Amelie
Mauresmo versus Anna-Lena
Groenefeld) with my grandfather,
when my mother came in and said
that if Groenefeld couldn't make a
successful career out of tennis, she
could certainly be a model.To which
my grandfather responded that al
though Groenefeld had a rather nice
body, she couldn't be a supermodel
because "faut qu'il y ait du monde au

balcon." (1 write down his comment
in French because the expression is
amusing. Literally, it means that
"there needs to be a crowd on the
balcony," but figuratively it means
that she would need to have bigger
breasts).
His comment raises some inter
esting questions. My grandfather has
always described himself as a
women's advocate, and his life story
confirms that he is. From his perspec
tive, admiring women's bodies is just
a way of showing his appreciation
for women. But by focusing on
women's bodies, don't we run the
risk of reducing them to that body?
Groenefeld is a top-level tennis
player, and she should be admired at

least as much for her athletic ability
as for her good looks. When female
athletes are featured in the media,
they are women first, then athletes.
The reverse is not true for men.
Feminism is often regarded as a
thing of the past, and feminists are
considered dinosaurs, trying to stir
up trouble unnecessarily. But clearly,
many issues still need to be ad
dressed, both on a societal level and
on a more day-to-day level. So why
not address them in a calm,objective
way, instead of flying off the handle
and judging feminists before even
hearing their arguments?

If you're at a dinner party and conver
sation is stalling, try mentioning fem
inism. I guarantee that you'll get
some strong reactions. The term "femi
nism" has taken on so many connota
tions over the years that it's hard to know
what exactly it means; unfortunately, it
often elicits the image of a militant, male
bashing woman who doesn't shave.
People will try to explain a woman's
feminism by attacking her personally:
She must be frustrated, single, lesbian,
etc. Some — men usually — will also
put forth the argument that equality was
attained at least 40 years ago, so why are
feminists persisting in their belligerent
attitudes?
But has equality been attained? What
are gender relations like nowadays? Ac
cording to The New York Times' colum
nist Maureen Dowd, in some ways not
that different from the 19505. Courting
strategies are pretty much unchanged.
Apparently, guys like to "hunt," but hate
to be chased, so women have to brush up

on the "tricks of the trade": an airy
laugh, a toss of the hair, hatting eyelids.
Women's magazines help them in this
endeavor by publishing the same articles
month after month: "200 ways to look
hot." "10 strategies to get and keep your
man," etc.
Equality of pay was one of the main
themes of the feminist movement in the
19605. Today, although it has still not
been achieved, people seem bored of the
topic. The inequality is accepted almost
complacently — even by women. Ac
cording to Dowd, there is now a term for
a woman's inferior pay: "girl money."

Are men attracted to powerful women
or not? Several studies suggest that men
are intimidated by them. For example,
Dowd cites a University of Michigan psy
chology study using college undergradu
ates which suggests that men looking for
long-term relationships would rather
marry women in subordinate jobs than
women who are supervisors. Men think
that women with important jobs are more
likely to cheat on them.
TTie article also refers to a 2005 report
by researchers at four British universi
ties, which indicates that a high I.Q. ham
pers a woman's chance to marry, while it
is a plus for men. The prospect for mar
riage increased by 35 percent for guys
for each 16-point increase in 1.Q.; for
women, there is a 40 percent drop for
each 16-point rise.
Statistics and studies aside, there are
day-to-day situations which make me
wonder about the state of male-female

equality and gender relations. At the
end of the summer. I was watching a
women's U.S. Open match (Amelie
Mauresmo versus Anna-Lena
Groenefeld) with my grandfather,
when my mother came in and said
that if Groenefeld couldn't make a
successful career out of tennis, she
could certainly be a model.To which
my grandfather responded that al
though Groenefeld had a rather nice
body, she couldn't be a supermodel
because "faut qu'il y ait du monde au

balcon." (1 write down his comment
in French because the expression is
amusing. Literally, it means that
"there needs to be a crowd on the
balcony," but figuratively it means
that she would need to have bigger
breasts).
His comment raises some inter
esting questions. My grandfather has
always described himself as a
women's advocate, and his life story
confirms that he is. From his perspec
tive, admiring women's bodies is just
a way of showing his appreciation
for women. But by focusing on
women's bodies, don't we run the
risk of reducing them to that body?
Groenefeld is a top-level tennis
player, and she should be admired at

least as much for her athletic ability
as for her good looks. When female
athletes are featured in the media,
they are women first, then athletes.
The reverse is not true for men.
Feminism is often regarded as a
thing of the past, and feminists are
considered dinosaurs, trying to stir
up trouble unnecessarily. But clearly,
many issues still need to be ad
dressed, both on a societal level and
on a more day-to-day level. So why
not address them in a calm,objective
way, instead of flying off the handle
and judging feminists before even
hearing their arguments?
