# Did you say feminism?

If you're at a dinner party and conver
sation is stalling, try mentioning fem
inism. I guarantee that you'll get
some strong reactions. The term "femi
nism" has taken on so many connota
tions over the years that it's hard to know
what exactly it means; unfortunately, it
often elicits the image of a militant, male
bashing woman who doesn't shave.
People will try to explain a woman's
feminism by attacking her personally:
She must be frustrated, single, lesbian,
etc. Some — men usually — will also
put forth the argument that equality was
attained at least 40 years ago, so why are
feminists persisting in their belligerent
attitudes?
But has equality been attained? What
are gender relations like nowadays? Ac
cording to The New York Times' colum
nist Maureen Dowd, in some ways not
that different from the 19505. Courting
strategies are pretty much unchanged.
Apparently, guys like to "hunt," but hate
to be chased, so women have to brush up

on the "tricks of the trade": an airy
laugh, a toss of the hair, hatting eyelids.
Women's magazines help them in this
endeavor by publishing the same articles
month after month: "200 ways to look
hot." "10 strategies to get and keep your
man," etc.
Equality of pay was one of the main
themes of the feminist movement in the
19605. Today, although it has still not
been achieved, people seem bored of the
topic. The inequality is accepted almost
complacently — even by women. Ac
cording to Dowd, there is now a term for
a woman's inferior pay: "girl money."

Are men attracted to powerful women
or not? Several studies suggest that men
are intimidated by them. For example,
Dowd cites a University of Michigan psy
chology study using college undergradu
ates which suggests that men looking for
long-term relationships would rather
marry women in subordinate jobs than
women who are supervisors. Men think
that women with important jobs are more
likely to cheat on them.
TTie article also refers to a 2005 report
by researchers at four British universi
ties, which indicates that a high I.Q. ham
pers a woman's chance to marry, while it
is a plus for men. The prospect for mar
riage increased by 35 percent for guys
for each 16-point increase in 1.Q.; for
women, there is a 40 percent drop for
each 16-point rise.
Statistics and studies aside, there are
day-to-day situations which make me
wonder about the state of male-female
