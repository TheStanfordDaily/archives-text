# Prop. 75 would be unnecessary, inefficient

### MARGOT ISMAN, ERIC ZIMMERMANN GABE WINANT 
It is ridiculous that The Daily editorial
board believes it knows how to spend
union dues better than union members do.
If union members are actually unhappy
with how their dues are spent, they can
elect new union leaders.
Proposition 75 supporters would have
you believe that union members currently
have no say in determining how their dues
are spent.This is completely false. Current
ly, all public employee union members

must give consent to have their dues used
for political purposes when they join the
union, and can opt out at any time (as ap
proximately 25 percent do). Prop.7s would
change this system only by forcing unions
to obtain such consent repeatedly each
year — increasing paperwork, draining re
sources from union activity and hurting
working Californians.
Compare the structure of unions to
large corporations. As the system currently
stands, unions are already much fairer in
their political practices than corporations.
Pharmaceutical companies, for instance.

don't have to ask their stockholders' con
sent to donate money to Republicans. Why
a double standard for working people, es
pecially when corporations outspend
unions 24 to one on politics?
Prop. 75 is nothing but an attempt by
Republicans to permanently weaken their
political opponents.
