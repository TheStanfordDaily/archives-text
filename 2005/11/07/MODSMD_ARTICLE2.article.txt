## ASSU receives fewer special fees refund requests 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Every spring students vote on
ASSU special fees to support over 40
student organizations and services,
which if approved increase every
student's programming fees. Every
quarter they have the option to ob
tain refunds on each special fee ac
cording to the Constitution of the
ASSU. Refunds exceeding a buffer
amount collected by the ASSU will
reduce the student group's special
fee allocation.
The overall fall quarter 2005 re
fund rate was 4.17 percent of the
budget, resulting in a loss in organi
zational funding of over $30,000.
The highest refund rate was 4.86
percent of undergraduate students
for The Stanford Progressive and
the lowest was 3.07 percent for the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter.
"We are pleased with the relative
stability of special-fee refunds this
year, and we hope that students will
continue to support and appreciate
the diversity of student groups on
this campus by declining their spe
cial fee refunds in the future and vot
ing in the spring elections," said
ASSU Vice President Aneto
Okonkwo, a senior.
According to Undergraduate
Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a senior,
these refund rates for the fall quarter
were lower than usual.
"Most students, especially fresh
men, probably were not aware of the
Student Activity Fee Refund due to
poor publicity," Nguyen said.
However, Okonkwo felt that
freshmen did receive adequate noti
fication.
"Special fees refunds were adver
tised on the ASSU Web site,"
Okonkwo said. "The fee is also on
every student's University bill. Fresh
men were notified of the refunds in
an ASSU booklet that was mailed to
them over the summer and these
booklets were also distributed to
freshman dorms."
Justin Fishner-Wolfson, ASSU fi
nancial manager and chief executive
officer of Stanford Student Enter
prises, stated that high refunds can
"cripple activities on campus fora
year," however, if this occurs, affect
ed student groups will still be able to
apply for funding in future years. Just
such a crisis occurred in 2003 when
refund rates rose to 17.2 percent in
the spring, bringing special fees close
