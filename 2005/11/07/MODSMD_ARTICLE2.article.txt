## ASSU receives fewer special fees refund requests 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Every spring students vote on
ASSU special fees to support over 40
student organizations and services,
which if approved increase every
student's programming fees. Every
quarter they have the option to ob
tain refunds on each special fee ac
cording to the Constitution of the
ASSU. Refunds exceeding a buffer
amount collected by the ASSU will
reduce the student group's special
fee allocation.
The overall fall quarter 2005 re
fund rate was 4.17 percent of the
budget, resulting in a loss in organi
zational funding of over $30,000.
The highest refund rate was 4.86
percent of undergraduate students
for The Stanford Progressive and
the lowest was 3.07 percent for the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter.
"We are pleased with the relative
stability of special-fee refunds this
year, and we hope that students will
continue to support and appreciate
the diversity of student groups on
this campus by declining their spe
cial fee refunds in the future and vot
ing in the spring elections," said
ASSU Vice President Aneto
Okonkwo, a senior.
According to Undergraduate
Senate Chair Chris Nguyen, a senior,
these refund rates for the fall quarter
were lower than usual.
"Most students, especially fresh
men, probably were not aware of the
Student Activity Fee Refund due to
poor publicity," Nguyen said.
However, Okonkwo felt that
freshmen did receive adequate noti
fication.
"Special fees refunds were adver
tised on the ASSU Web site,"
Okonkwo said. "The fee is also on
every student's University bill. Fresh
men were notified of the refunds in
an ASSU booklet that was mailed to
them over the summer and these
booklets were also distributed to
freshman dorms."
Justin Fishner-Wolfson, ASSU fi
nancial manager and chief executive
officer of Stanford Student Enter
prises, stated that high refunds can
"cripple activities on campus fora
year," however, if this occurs, affect
ed student groups will still be able to
apply for funding in future years. Just
such a crisis occurred in 2003 when
refund rates rose to 17.2 percent in
the spring, bringing special fees close
to bankruptcy and forcing the ASSU
to reform the system.
There is currently discussion
about further amending the special
fees processes within the ASSU
Constitution.
"Proposals have ranged from
abolishing the refund to increasing
the requirements to get a special fee
on the ballot," Nguyen said.
Okonkwo hopes to provide an
online special fees process for spring
elections in 2006.
"We hope to reform the process
by which student groups join the
ballot for special fees because the
physical signature collection that
many groups undertake for thou
sands of signatures is tedious for
both student leaders and ASSU of
ficials," he said.
Director of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau Adam Kahn, a coterminal
master?s student in communication,
is proud that his group received one
of the lowest refund rates on campus
with a rate of 3.63 percent amongst
undergraduates and 4.26 percent
amongst graduates.
"This low refund rate is a testa
ment to the quality and importance
of our programming." Kahn said.
"Because we bring a wide array of
speakers to campus, it is likely that

most students would have an inter
est in attending at least one of our
events. Speakers are expensive, and
without special fees we could not put
on our events. In addition, we are
one of the few groups on campus
that checks Special Fees refund lists.
Student who request refunds do not
get advance tickets to our events and
will only be admitted once students
with tickets are accommodated."
Kahn said he believes that more
special fee recipients should take
advantage of the fact that they do
not have to provide their services
for free to students who request re
funds.
"If groups limit opportunities to
those who receive refunds, this will
truly encourage students to only re
quest refunds if they ideologically
oppose a group and not because
they want to get money back for the
sake of getting money back," Kahn
said.
Special Fees currently support 44
student groups and services includ
ing Alternative Spring Break. ASSU
Legal Counseling, the Cardinal Bal
let, KZSU, the Leland Stanford Ju
nior University Marching Band.
Stanford Club Sports, Stanford
Dance Marathon, Stanford News
Readership Program and Student
Organizing Committee for the Arts.
Most groups only receive Special
Fees from undergraduates; six
groups receive special fees from
both graduate and undergraduate
students.
