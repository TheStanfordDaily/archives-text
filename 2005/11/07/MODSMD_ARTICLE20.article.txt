# Prop. 76 encourages restraint
## 
### DONALD STEVENS 
As students, many of us are managing our
bank accounts for the first time. We've learned,
hopefully not through personal experience,
that our spending is limited by our bank bal
ance. This lesson in mind, most students would
agree that deficit spending is inappropriate.
Why is it, then, that some voters oppose
Proposition 76, an initiative designed to force
state government to live by the same restric
tions we abide by as private citizens?
Some have framed Prop. 76 as a "power
grab" by the governor. I'm not going to lie to
you; the initiative does give the governor — re
gardless of party affiliation — additional
power to cut spending. However, this is no
blank check. The governor cannot make cuts
except in the event of fiscal emergency', and he
cannot arbitrarily declare such an emergency.
Furthermore, his/her cuts may not interfere
with federally-required programs, or cause the
state government to renege on contracts.

Some also complain that Prop. 76 eliminates
the minimum funding guarantee for K-14 edu
cation. This may sound like a bad thing, but
consider this: Under current law, if the legisla
ture increases school funding, the next year's
minimum guarantee will be based on that
value. Without such a guarantee, policy-makers
may actually be more likely to increase educa
tion spending in any given year, since law
would not require them to permanently guar
antee such a level of funding.
Prop. 76 does more than simply reign in
deficit spending. For example, the initiative re
quires the government to save surplus revenue
for later and forces the state government to
repay local governments for state-mandated
programs in a timely fashion.
A vote for Prop. 76 is a vote for fiscal re
sponsibility in California.
