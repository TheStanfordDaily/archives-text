## Prof questions Americans' attitude toward Constitution 
### RICARDO GILB 
"Why are Americans always ar
guing about their constitution?"
asked American History Prof. Jack
Rakove last Friday at the Ziff Center
for Jewish Life, the on-campus home
of Hillel. Rakove spent the better
part of the lunchtime talk trying to
answer that question. The event is
part of Hitlers "Friday Faculty
Forum." which will bring professors
to the center monthly to give presen
tations on a range of topics.
Rakove's presentation was based
on a talk he originally gave in China
to students he was teaching during
the summer. As a result, Rakove
joked that he had inadvertently
made a "Mao-ist style presentation,"
with "three problems and three puz
zles." In its emphasis on the impor
tance of debate and interpretation,
however, Rakove's talk was — in the
end — far from anything Mao would
have applauded.
Among the problems and puzzles
Rakove tackled were why the Amer
ican Constitution is discussed so
much, unlike any other nation's, and
why — two hundred years after it
was written — citizens still haven't
figured out what the document real
ly means.
Rakove mentioned that one pos

sible explanation is that constitution
al debates, such as those taking place
in the Supreme Court, have come to
loom very large in American life be
cause of the rise of "judicial ac
tivism." Rakove, however, claimed
the term was too vague to be useful,
and the argument attached to it "just
doesn't make sense."
He explained that the phrase was
often used to refer to decisions made
by the Earl Warren and the Warren
Burger courts during the mid-s()s to
the early 70s. during which decisions
such as Brown v. Board of Education
and Roe v. Wade were handed down.
The 60s. known for so many
changes in the political and social
fabric of American life, was, in consti
tutional terms, a "decade of incorpo
ration," during which rights of citi
zens were beginning to be protected
under the Constitution's Fourteenth
Amendment. This caused a sudden
increase in the "public interest in liti
gation. and the Warren Court indi
cated it was'open for business."'
But Rakove said he believes that
the real "judicial activists" are inter
est groups who arc trying to achieve
their goals any way they can, whether
it is through the judicial system or
any other political route. This is the
basis for what Rakove said was his
main point.

"In a system that divides power as
much as the United States Constitu
tion does, we want decisions to he
made by the institution where our
own views have the best chance of
prevailing," Rakove said.
This creates arguments about
who will make decisions, which
throw the Constitution into the mix.
Rakove called this whole process of
interpreting the Constitution strate
gically the "politicization of the Con
stitution and the constitutionaliza
tion of politics."
The fact that the talk took place in
the Ziff Center prompted some in
teresting comparisons. One student
suggested that constant textual de
bate was perhaps the best way to
keep the Constitution alive, similar
to the Talmudic tradition of continu
ous debate over and interpretation
of the text of theTorah.
"It is remarkably similar to de
hates over our holy texts," said My
chal Copeland, the rabbi at Hillel.
Sophomore Alana Kinrich, a
member of the Jewish Leadership
Council — Hillel's student govern
ment — said that this interpretive
tradition provides a feeling of conti
nuity with history, and that it inter
ests her that "we're grappling with
ideas that Jews were grappling with
three thousand years ago."
