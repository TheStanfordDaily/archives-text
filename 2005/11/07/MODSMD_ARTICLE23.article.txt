Editorial board's argument
for Prop. 77 is flawed
I would like to take issue with the statement that
the editorial hoard made on Friday in support of
Prop. 77: "We think this plan will make elections
more competitive." It was a little disappointing not
to see any facts to hack up this statement, since "in
dependent commissions" in other states exist where
this statement could he evaluated.
The Arizona Independent Redisricting Com
mission is widely praised as a model for how redis
ricting should he done and is similar to the idea pre
sented in Prop. 77. If removing politicians from the
drawing of district lines increases competition, as
the editorial hoard suggests, then we would expect
that the A IRC drawn districts would increase the
competition in Congressional and State Senate
races. In fact, the actual numbers indicate otherwise.
Not only did all Congressional incumbents retain
their seats, hut their average margin of victory actu

ally increased from the "gerrymandered" districts of
2(MX) (28 percent in 2(KK) to 35 percent in 2004 by my
arithmetic).
Nearly every proponent of Prop. 77 explicitly
states that it is not perfect and lacking. Furthermore,
results from commission-based districting states
such Arizona and lowa (where no Congressional
seats changed hands and competition decreased be
tween 2(X)4 and 2(X)2) indicate that the success of
these programs hasn't been able to generate drastic
changes in competition.
The editorial board and proponents of Prop. 77
want me to put legislation into the state constitution
that they admit isn't likely to be the best, while sim
ilar initiatives resulted in demonstrably poor results.
That seems like a reckless way to treat the Constitu
tion. I tend to regard the Constitution in high re
gards and shudder at the thought of putting some
thing so dubious into it.
