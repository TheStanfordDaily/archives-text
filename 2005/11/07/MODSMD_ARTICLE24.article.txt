## Top-ranked USC plays near-perfect first half to cruise 51-21 Card exposed at No. 1 USC 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal finally got an up
close look at the No. 1 Southern Cal
ifornia offense and it looked pretty
good. Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the defense didn't look too bad
either, and Stanford had to face ar
duous challenges on both sides of
the ball.
The Trojans (9-0, 6-0 Pacific-10
Conference) scored on their first
seven possessions — while Stanford
failed to pick up a first down in the
first quarter — en route to a 51-21
victory over Stanford (4-4. 3-3) in
front of a rowdy crowd of over
90,000 people at the LA Coliseum.
USC's stars lived up to all expec
tations as tailbacks Reggie Bush,
LenDale White and quarterback
Matt Leinart showed why they're
the most potent offensive trio in the
nation.
Bush, Heisman Trophy frontrun
ner, looked as exciting as ever, danc
ing his way to 113 yards rushing, 27

yards receiving and one touchdown.
The score came one play after a
fumble by Stanford senior receiver
Gerren Crochet — one of five Stan
ford turnovers on the evening. Bush
took a handoff 41 yards off-tackle
fora touchdown on the first play of
the USC possession. The Cardinal,
who hadn't turned the ball over in
their last four games, struggled to
hang onto the ball, especially in the
first half.
"It was fun seeing the explosion
of this team today," USC head coach
Pete Carroll said. "We love playing
at home, and it was certainly fun to
watch them. At the start, we just
started getting those turnovers,
which makes us very proud knowing
how stingy Stanford is with the
ball."
Three of the giveaways were on
interceptions by senior quarterback
Trent Edwards, who had only two
pick-offs coming into the contest.

plays and not turn the ball over, and
that wasn't the case in the first half,"
Edwards said. "Because of those
turnovers we couldn't get our of
fense going and the defense was on
the field fora long time."
The Trojans got on the board
early and didn't look back, opening
the game with a nine play, 80-yard
drive that ended on a two-yard
scoring run by White. White fin
ished the day with 61 yards on 13
carries with two scores. It was the
1 bth time in the careers of Bush and
White that they both scored in the
same game.
The 44 points that USC put up in
the first half were the most scored
by the Trojans in one half since
1975.
"They have weapons. They have
[receiver Dwayne] Jarrett, Leinart
won the Heisman, they have the
runner up in the Heisman and they
have White," senior defensive line
man Julius Jenkins said. "They play
great as a team and they have great
individuals and they jumped on us."
Leinart was in Heisman form
once again, passing for 259 yards
and four touchdowns before being
taken out of the game late in the
third quarter.
USC receiver Dwayne Jarrett
also showed why he's one of the na
tion's elite pass-catchers. Jarrett
made a series of fantastic catches
including one fora 19-yard score in
the corner of the endzone early in
the second half.
Stanford didn't get back on the
board until the second quarter.
Down 37-0, the Cardinal were final
ly able to move the ball down the
field, marching 55 yards on five
plays. The drive culminated on a 14-
yard touchdown pass from Edwards
to senior receiver Justin McCullum.
McCullum had one of the best
games of his career grabbing nine
balls for 138 yards and one score,
but it wasn't enough to keep the
Trojans from picking up their 31st
straight win.

"With Evan Moore out for the
season and Mark Bradford unable
to play, we needed someone for
Trent [Edwards] to go to and Justin
really came on and did an outstand
ing job," Stanford head coach Walt
Harris said. "He caught some deep
balls that were big and played
maybe his best game."
McCullum was forced to step
into the number one receiver role
as injuries claimed the two opening
week starting receivers. Junior re
ceiver Evan Moore has been out
with an injured hip since the sea
son's first game and junior receiver
Mark Bradford didn't play after in
juring his ankle in last week's game.
Injuries affected Edwards as
well, who was pulled out from one
second-half play after taking a big
hit on a quarterback draw at the
USC one-yard line. On the ensuing
play, junior back-up quarterback
T.C. Ostrander couldn't handle the
snap, and USC recovered the fum
ble in the endzone.
Edwards took some huge hits
throughout the game, as USC's
powerful defensive line usually had
little trouble getting by Stanford's
injury riddled pass protectors, and
he was eventually pulled from the
game in the fourth quarter.
Edwards finished the contest
with 245 yards passing, one touch
down and one interception. He also
was the team's leading rusher with
44 yards.
Stanford did make a rally in the
second half, scoring two second half
touchdowns. The first of the two
scores came on a long 14-play, 80-
yard drive, highlighted by a 22-yard
scramble by Edwards.
Junior tailback Jason Evans was
able to just push the ball into the
endzone on an option run on
fourth-and-goal.
The Cardinal also scored in the
final minute of the game when Os
trander led a drive that culminated
with a one-yard touchdown run by
senior Gerald Commissiong.

90,000 people at the LA Coliseum.
USC's stars lived up to all expec
tations as tailbacks Reggie Bush,
LenDale White and quarterback
Matt Leinart showed why they're
the most potent offensive trio in the
nation.
Bush, Heisman Trophy frontrun
ner, looked as exciting as ever, danc
ing his way to 113 yards rushing, 27

yards receiving and one touchdown.
The score came one play after a
fumble by Stanford senior receiver
Gerren Crochet — one of five Stan
ford turnovers on the evening. Bush
took a handoff 41 yards off-tackle
fora touchdown on the first play of
the USC possession. The Cardinal,
who hadn't turned the ball over in
their last four games, struggled to
hang onto the ball, especially in the
first half.
"It was fun seeing the explosion
of this team today," USC head coach
Pete Carroll said. "We love playing
at home, and it was certainly fun to
watch them. At the start, we just
started getting those turnovers,
which makes us very proud knowing
how stingy Stanford is with the
ball."
Three of the giveaways were on
interceptions by senior quarterback
Trent Edwards, who had only two
pick-offs coming into the contest.

plays and not turn the ball over, and
that wasn't the case in the first half,"
Edwards said. "Because of those
turnovers we couldn't get our of
fense going and the defense was on
the field fora long time."
The Trojans got on the board
early and didn't look back, opening
the game with a nine play, 80-yard
drive that ended on a two-yard
scoring run by White. White fin
ished the day with 61 yards on 13
carries with two scores. It was the
1 bth time in the careers of Bush and
White that they both scored in the
same game.
The 44 points that USC put up in
the first half were the most scored
by the Trojans in one half since
1975.
"They have weapons. They have
[receiver Dwayne] Jarrett, Leinart
won the Heisman, they have the
runner up in the Heisman and they
have White," senior defensive line
man Julius Jenkins said. "They play
great as a team and they have great
individuals and they jumped on us."
Leinart was in Heisman form
once again, passing for 259 yards
and four touchdowns before being
taken out of the game late in the
third quarter.
USC receiver Dwayne Jarrett
also showed why he's one of the na
tion's elite pass-catchers. Jarrett
made a series of fantastic catches
including one fora 19-yard score in
the corner of the endzone early in
the second half.
Stanford didn't get back on the
board until the second quarter.
Down 37-0, the Cardinal were final
ly able to move the ball down the
field, marching 55 yards on five
plays. The drive culminated on a 14-
yard touchdown pass from Edwards
to senior receiver Justin McCullum.
McCullum had one of the best
games of his career grabbing nine
balls for 138 yards and one score,
but it wasn't enough to keep the
Trojans from picking up their 31st
straight win.

"With Evan Moore out for the
season and Mark Bradford unable
to play, we needed someone for
Trent [Edwards] to go to and Justin
really came on and did an outstand
ing job," Stanford head coach Walt
Harris said. "He caught some deep
balls that were big and played
maybe his best game."
McCullum was forced to step
into the number one receiver role
as injuries claimed the two opening
week starting receivers. Junior re
ceiver Evan Moore has been out
with an injured hip since the sea
son's first game and junior receiver
Mark Bradford didn't play after in
juring his ankle in last week's game.
Injuries affected Edwards as
well, who was pulled out from one
second-half play after taking a big
hit on a quarterback draw at the
USC one-yard line. On the ensuing
play, junior back-up quarterback
T.C. Ostrander couldn't handle the
snap, and USC recovered the fum
ble in the endzone.
Edwards took some huge hits
throughout the game, as USC's
powerful defensive line usually had
little trouble getting by Stanford's
injury riddled pass protectors, and
he was eventually pulled from the
game in the fourth quarter.
Edwards finished the contest
with 245 yards passing, one touch
down and one interception. He also
was the team's leading rusher with
44 yards.
Stanford did make a rally in the
second half, scoring two second half
touchdowns. The first of the two
scores came on a long 14-play, 80-
yard drive, highlighted by a 22-yard
scramble by Edwards.
Junior tailback Jason Evans was
able to just push the ball into the
endzone on an option run on
fourth-and-goal.
The Cardinal also scored in the
final minute of the game when Os
trander led a drive that culminated
with a one-yard touchdown run by
senior Gerald Commissiong.
The Cardinal finally got an up
close look at the No. 1 Southern Cal
ifornia offense and it looked pretty
good. Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the defense didn't look too bad
either, and Stanford had to face ar
duous challenges on both sides of
the ball.
The Trojans (9-0, 6-0 Pacific-10
Conference) scored on their first
seven possessions — while Stanford
failed to pick up a first down in the
first quarter — en route to a 51-21
victory over Stanford (4-4. 3-3) in
front of a rowdy crowd of over
90,000 people at the LA Coliseum.
