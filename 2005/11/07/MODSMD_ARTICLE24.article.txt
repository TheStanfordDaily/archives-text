## Top-ranked USC plays near-perfect first half to cruise 51-21 Card exposed at No. 1 USC 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal finally got an up
close look at the No. 1 Southern Cal
ifornia offense and it looked pretty
good. Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, the defense didn't look too bad
either, and Stanford had to face ar
duous challenges on both sides of
the ball.
The Trojans (9-0, 6-0 Pacific-10
Conference) scored on their first
seven possessions — while Stanford
failed to pick up a first down in the
first quarter — en route to a 51-21
victory over Stanford (4-4. 3-3) in
front of a rowdy crowd of over
90,000 people at the LA Coliseum.
USC's stars lived up to all expec
tations as tailbacks Reggie Bush,
LenDale White and quarterback
Matt Leinart showed why they're
the most potent offensive trio in the
nation.
Bush, Heisman Trophy frontrun
ner, looked as exciting as ever, danc
ing his way to 113 yards rushing, 27

yards receiving and one touchdown.
The score came one play after a
fumble by Stanford senior receiver
Gerren Crochet — one of five Stan
ford turnovers on the evening. Bush
took a handoff 41 yards off-tackle
fora touchdown on the first play of
the USC possession. The Cardinal,
who hadn't turned the ball over in
their last four games, struggled to
hang onto the ball, especially in the
first half.
"It was fun seeing the explosion
of this team today," USC head coach
Pete Carroll said. "We love playing
at home, and it was certainly fun to
watch them. At the start, we just
started getting those turnovers,
which makes us very proud knowing
how stingy Stanford is with the
ball."
Three of the giveaways were on
interceptions by senior quarterback
Trent Edwards, who had only two
pick-offs coming into the contest.
"We knew we had to make some
