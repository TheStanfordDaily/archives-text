unreleased interview.
Ali G: Booyakasha! Check it, lis 'ere wit
me main man Mike "Monty" Montgomery;
he be de best male stipper in all de UK. Yo.
Respek.
Monty: He110...
AG: So, wuz it hard when they kicked you
out of Stanford for showing de full Monty?
MM: Excuse me?
AC: You know, in that flick when you woz
a stripper...and you, yah know, you went de
full Monty. You was like, yo', I iz going to do
dis thing, even if me lose me job, because dis
iz what I believe in. The full Monty. Respek.
MM: I wasn't in"The Full Monty."
AG: For real? Not that I saw it — 1 ain't a
homosapien — but it wuz a big step for the
rights of male strippers, innit.
MM: Fm the coach of the Golden State
Warriors.
AG: Wicked. So you're like, attack, attack!
And den you show 'em de full Monty?
MM: N0... "The Full Monty" has absolute
ly nothing to do with it.
AG: [LONG PAUSE] You know me iz a
ballah meself. Can you hook a brotha up?
MM: Fm not the one to ask.
AG: I can do fakes well good. You go to de
right, den it's like, oh. I tricked yah, den you
go to de left, den you dunk on dey noggins.
MM: What if they don't fall for the fake?
AG: Well, den you go back to de right and
back to de left, until dey is well good fallen
for it, innit.
MM: What if they don't?
AG: [LONG PAUSE] I an't thought of dat.
You iz a well smart coach. [PAUSE] Wot do
you say when you dunk on someone's 'ead?
Is it like, yo, I wuz wid yo' mum last night or

Sean
Howell
Go Robber Barons!
AG: Wot do you think about de NBA dress code?
Dey's tryin' to throw de backwater out with de cul
ture, innit?
MM: Well, I don't think they're trying to throw the
culture out. 1 think they're just trying to clean up
the game's image.
AG: But doesn't dat have a bad influence on the
tykes?
MM: Excuse me?
AG: Where are de kids going to learn how to dress
like dey is from de wesside?
MM: I don't think that's really an issue here.
AG: Ain't it a bit racialist? 1 mean, cuz players
can't sport their bling?
MM: People have accused it of being that, but I
don't personally think it is. It's not an attack on hip
hop culture. The commissioner just wants his play
ers looking presentable. And I agree with that.
AG: Are you a bit peeved you can't show de full
Monty anymore?
MM: [SIGHS] Look. I wasn't in the movie "The
Full Monty." I have nothing to do with it. I didn't
even see it.
AG: But dat's part of yo' team strategy.innit. Like,
instead of a fake, you give 'em de full Monty.
MM: I don't even know how to answer that. No.
AG: Aight. Well, wot about short shorts?
MM: What about them?
AG: Iz players still allowed to wear dem? Who
wuz dat lil' bloke, wid de tiny shorts?
MM: John Stockton?
AG: [LAUGHS] He wuz pasty, wasn't he?
MM: Yes, he was white.
AG: Wot do you do when a white guy wants to
play for you? Do you have to take him aside and be
like, hey.sorry lil' fella, but dis just isn't the sport for
yah?
MM: I don't think race has anything to do with it.
There have been a number of great white basket
ball players.
AG: Wot? [LONG PAUSE] Who?
MM: Well, Larry Bird.
AG: He wasn't a brotha?
MM: No.
AG: But he was on de inside. Aight. wotevah. Wot
is de bestest place to coach at?
MM: Well, I enjoy coaching the Warriors, but the
Farm will always have a special place in my heart.
AG: Wot? De Farm ? Dey must be well smart am
inals.
MM: Sure.
AG: Wicked. Yo, you best lissen up to de words of
Mike Montgomery, he be de general of de Golden
State Warriors. He is real proof that a stripper can
use his talents to bettah da world. Big up yo'self.

man who claims to be of African-
American and Jamaican descent, sat
down with former Stanford basketball coach
Mike Montgomery last weekend to discuss,
among other things, the NBAs new dress
code and the challenges of coaching animals
on the Farm.This is a transcript of the as-yet
unreleased interview.
Ali G: Booyakasha! Check it, lis 'ere wit
me main man Mike "Monty" Montgomery;
he be de best male stipper in all de UK. Yo.
Respek.
Monty: He110...
AG: So, wuz it hard when they kicked you
out of Stanford for showing de full Monty?
MM: Excuse me?
AC: You know, in that flick when you woz
a stripper...and you, yah know, you went de
full Monty. You was like, yo', I iz going to do
dis thing, even if me lose me job, because dis
iz what I believe in. The full Monty. Respek.
MM: I wasn't in"The Full Monty."
AG: For real? Not that I saw it — 1 ain't a
homosapien — but it wuz a big step for the
rights of male strippers, innit.
MM: Fm the coach of the Golden State
Warriors.
AG: Wicked. So you're like, attack, attack!
And den you show 'em de full Monty?
MM: N0... "The Full Monty" has absolute
ly nothing to do with it.
AG: [LONG PAUSE] You know me iz a
ballah meself. Can you hook a brotha up?
MM: Fm not the one to ask.
AG: I can do fakes well good. You go to de
right, den it's like, oh. I tricked yah, den you
go to de left, den you dunk on dey noggins.
MM: What if they don't fall for the fake?
AG: Well, den you go back to de right and
back to de left, until dey is well good fallen
for it, innit.
MM: What if they don't?
AG: [LONG PAUSE] I an't thought of dat.
You iz a well smart coach. [PAUSE] Wot do
you say when you dunk on someone's 'ead?
Is it like, yo, I wuz wid yo' mum last night or
is it more den dat ?
MM: You shouldn't say anything.


Sean
Howell
Go Robber Barons!
AG: Wot do you think about de NBA dress code?
Dey's tryin' to throw de backwater out with de cul
ture, innit?
MM: Well, I don't think they're trying to throw the
culture out. 1 think they're just trying to clean up
the game's image.
AG: But doesn't dat have a bad influence on the
tykes?
MM: Excuse me?
AG: Where are de kids going to learn how to dress
like dey is from de wesside?
MM: I don't think that's really an issue here.
AG: Ain't it a bit racialist? 1 mean, cuz players
can't sport their bling?
MM: People have accused it of being that, but I
don't personally think it is. It's not an attack on hip
hop culture. The commissioner just wants his play
ers looking presentable. And I agree with that.
AG: Are you a bit peeved you can't show de full
Monty anymore?
MM: [SIGHS] Look. I wasn't in the movie "The
Full Monty." I have nothing to do with it. I didn't
even see it.
AG: But dat's part of yo' team strategy.innit. Like,
instead of a fake, you give 'em de full Monty.
MM: I don't even know how to answer that. No.
AG: Aight. Well, wot about short shorts?
MM: What about them?
AG: Iz players still allowed to wear dem? Who
wuz dat lil' bloke, wid de tiny shorts?
MM: John Stockton?
AG: [LAUGHS] He wuz pasty, wasn't he?
MM: Yes, he was white.
AG: Wot do you do when a white guy wants to
play for you? Do you have to take him aside and be
like, hey.sorry lil' fella, but dis just isn't the sport for
yah?
MM: I don't think race has anything to do with it.
There have been a number of great white basket
ball players.
AG: Wot? [LONG PAUSE] Who?
MM: Well, Larry Bird.
AG: He wasn't a brotha?
MM: No.
AG: But he was on de inside. Aight. wotevah. Wot
is de bestest place to coach at?
MM: Well, I enjoy coaching the Warriors, but the
Farm will always have a special place in my heart.
AG: Wot? De Farm ? Dey must be well smart am
inals.
MM: Sure.
AG: Wicked. Yo, you best lissen up to de words of
Mike Montgomery, he be de general of de Golden
State Warriors. He is real proof that a stripper can
use his talents to bettah da world. Big up yo'self.
