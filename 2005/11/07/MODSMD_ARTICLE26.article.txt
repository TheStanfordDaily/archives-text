## Return to the court results in big victory Stanford pulls away for win in first exhibition gamey 87-52 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
With the starters watching most of the con
test from the bench, the role players and true
freshman of Stanford men's basketball weath
ered a shaky first half before pulling away in the
second half against Sonoma State in the first ex
hibition game this season.
Freshman guard Lawrence Hill led Stanford
with 14 points and eight rebounds, while sopho
more center Peter Prowitt added 13 and senior
forward Matt Haryasz chipped in another 12
points and seven rebounds, in Stanford's Satur
day exhibition opener at Maples Pavilion.
"Obviously it went pretty good from our
standpoint — we had the opportunity to play
everybody and everybody's healthy," head
coach TYent Johnson said of the 87-52 win.
Seniors guards Dan Grunfeld and Chris Her
nandez — both pre-season Wooden All-Ameri
can Candidates — senior forward Matt
Haryasz, redshirt sophomore guard Tim Morris
and junior forward Fred Washington started
both halves for the Cardinal.The starters built a
20-8 lead in the first six minutes of the game and
expanded a 39-31 halftime lead into a 49-37 edge
in the first five minutes of the second.
"I thought [the starters] were efficient offen
sively, very productive," said Johnson, whose
Cardinal were picked to finish second to Ari
zona in the Pacific-10 Conference preseason
media poll. "Defensively, we had some mental
lapses where we relaxed, and this is a basketball
team that cannot afford to relax on any defen
sive possession. There were a lot of times when

that veteran group gambled and
took themselves out of plays trying
to make a steal."
Hernandez and Haryasz are each
coming off All-Pac-10 seasons, so
Hernandez' five points and three as
sists in 16 minutes and Haryasz'
strong performance came as little
surprise. A more significant differ
ence from the end of last season was
a right knee brace — the only sign
of the torn ACL that ended Grun
feld's 2004-05 season — as the River
Hills, Wise, native demonstrated
good mobility, often beating defend
ers around screens for open
jumpers.
"I felt really good, and it was
great to be back out there playing
again," said Grunfeld, who finished
with nine points on three-of-five
shooting in only 15 minutes of play.
"I've been playing with [the brace]
and 1 definitely felt confident and
comfortable out there."
Morris displayed great athleti
cism in his first return to action since
sitting out the last 19 games of 2004-
05 season due to academic ineligibil
ity. Morris led the Cardinal with two
steals and offered one for the high
light reel: while in mid-air, he threw
the ball off a Sonoma State player a
split-second before falling out of
bounds to maintain Stanford pos
session. His signature play, though,
came with 16:38 remaining in the
second, as the Atlanta native
brought a packed Sixth Man section
to a fever pitch with an alley-oop off
a Grunfeld lob.
"1 ran the sideline and saw Dan,"
Morris said. "I saw 1 had the angle
on the hoop. 1 pointed up and Dan
just threw it."
Though according to Johnson,
only Hernandez, Haryasz and
Grunfeld have secured starting
spots, the 6-foot-4 Morris looks like
ly to be the fourth starter and could
see significant minutes this upcom
ing season. No matter Morris' role,
Johnson says that the explosive
guard needs to improve in some of
the game's finer points.
"We need him to step up with a
defensive presence and do the little
things besides scoring the basket
ball," the second-year head coach
said. "Those are things that fans
don't always realize but will help
him become a more complete play
er."
Starters accounted for Stanford's
first 24 points as the Cardinal used a
9,7 and 6-point runs to build to a 24-
10 lead with 12:49 to go in the first
half. The Seawolves responded with
a 12-2 run later in the period, howev
er, and Stanford entered the locker
room with a only an eight point lead.
In the early second half, the
teams traded points and the Cardi
nal held a 49-39 lead with 14:36 re
maining. However, Stanford then
unleashed a 29-2 run on the visiting
Seawolves to build to a 68-41 lead
with 7:36 to play, and cruised to the
final 35-point margin.

Haryasz, redshirt sophomore guard Tim Morris
and junior forward Fred Washington started
both halves for the Cardinal.The starters built a
20-8 lead in the first six minutes of the game and
expanded a 39-31 halftime lead into a 49-37 edge
in the first five minutes of the second.
"I thought [the starters] were efficient offen
sively, very productive," said Johnson, whose
Cardinal were picked to finish second to Ari
zona in the Pacific-10 Conference preseason
media poll. "Defensively, we had some mental
lapses where we relaxed, and this is a basketball
team that cannot afford to relax on any defen
sive possession. There were a lot of times when

that veteran group gambled and
took themselves out of plays trying
to make a steal."
Hernandez and Haryasz are each
coming off All-Pac-10 seasons, so
Hernandez' five points and three as
sists in 16 minutes and Haryasz'
strong performance came as little
surprise. A more significant differ
ence from the end of last season was
a right knee brace — the only sign
of the torn ACL that ended Grun
feld's 2004-05 season — as the River
Hills, Wise, native demonstrated
good mobility, often beating defend
ers around screens for open
jumpers.
"I felt really good, and it was
great to be back out there playing
again," said Grunfeld, who finished
with nine points on three-of-five
shooting in only 15 minutes of play.
"I've been playing with [the brace]
and 1 definitely felt confident and
comfortable out there."
Morris displayed great athleti
cism in his first return to action since
sitting out the last 19 games of 2004-
05 season due to academic ineligibil
ity. Morris led the Cardinal with two
steals and offered one for the high
light reel: while in mid-air, he threw
the ball off a Sonoma State player a
split-second before falling out of
bounds to maintain Stanford pos
session. His signature play, though,
came with 16:38 remaining in the
second, as the Atlanta native
brought a packed Sixth Man section
to a fever pitch with an alley-oop off
a Grunfeld lob.
"1 ran the sideline and saw Dan,"
Morris said. "I saw 1 had the angle
on the hoop. 1 pointed up and Dan
just threw it."
Though according to Johnson,
only Hernandez, Haryasz and
Grunfeld have secured starting
spots, the 6-foot-4 Morris looks like
ly to be the fourth starter and could
see significant minutes this upcom
ing season. No matter Morris' role,
Johnson says that the explosive
guard needs to improve in some of
the game's finer points.
"We need him to step up with a
defensive presence and do the little
things besides scoring the basket
ball," the second-year head coach
said. "Those are things that fans
don't always realize but will help
him become a more complete play
er."
Starters accounted for Stanford's
first 24 points as the Cardinal used a
9,7 and 6-point runs to build to a 24-
10 lead with 12:49 to go in the first
half. The Seawolves responded with
a 12-2 run later in the period, howev
er, and Stanford entered the locker
room with a only an eight point lead.
In the early second half, the
teams traded points and the Cardi
nal held a 49-39 lead with 14:36 re
maining. However, Stanford then
unleashed a 29-2 run on the visiting
Seawolves to build to a 68-41 lead
with 7:36 to play, and cruised to the
final 35-point margin.
