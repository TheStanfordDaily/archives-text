# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## No. 4 women show off power against Cougars 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
111 an offense depleted by injury, Sta
nford junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards is thriving in the spotlight. For
the first time in her career, Richards is
the primary offensive threat for the No 4
women's volleyball team, and she shoul
dered the responsibility admirably with a
career performance in Washington State
on Friday.
For her first two years with Stanford
(21-4, 10-3 Pacific-10 Conference),
Richards shared the court with four-time
Ail-American and Honda/Broderick
Cup winner Ogonna Nnamani.This sea
son, the Cardinal's balanced attack had
been dealt a blow with a season-ending
injury to freshman outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza, leaving Richards, supported by
freshman middle blocker Foluke Akin
radewo to lead the offense.
In Friday's 3-1 victory over Washing
ton State (8-17, 1-11 Pac-10), Richards
pounded 31 kills — demolishing her pre

vious career high of 24 — while hitting at
a .426 clip.
"I think she felt like she had not
played well enough the night before,"
head coach John Dunning said of
Richards, who had only 13 kills and hit
.140 in a loss to Washington on Thursday.
"She has really been stepping up to be
come someone we can count on. She
played very aggressive and focused
against WSU. She just really decided to
go for it."
Richards was not the only Stanford
player with a career night at Washington
State. With her second dig of the match,
senior libero Courtney Schultz reached
the I,(XK)-dig mark in her career. Her 20
digs on the night leave her one short of
breaking into the all-time Stanford top
10 in career digs.
Senior setter Katie Goldhahn, who
stepped in after sophomore setter Bryn
Kehoe broke her hand last week, had ca
reer highs with 68 assists and six kills.

many sneaky tips that caught the Cougars off-guard.
"Katie and the hitters were really connecting and getting it
done," Dunning said.
Richards received support on the offensive side as well. Ak
inradewo had 16 kills on .467 hitting, and junior right side Nji
Nnamani chipped in 14 kills and 10 digs. Junior middle blocker
Lizzie Suiter anchored the defense at the net with a team-high
three blocks.
Stanford took the first point of the match on a kill by
Richards, but the Cougars fought back to take a five-point lead
at 9-4. The Cardinal managed to regain the lead at 16-15 on a
Richards kill, but could not go up by more than two, and the
Cougars came back to take the 29-25 lead. Nnamani came up

with a kill to keep the Car
dinal alive, but the
Cougars closed out the
game 30-26 with a kill.
"Washington State had
some confidence after
going five (games] with
Cal the night before,"
Dunning said." They are a
dangerous team. We came
out maybe a little nervous,
playing in front of about
1.600 people, their largest
crowd of the season."
In game two. a WSU
error gave Stanford the
first point, and the Cardi
nal would not relinquish
the lead, holding a four
point advantage at the

for us and a good
step forward toward

midway point after a Goldhahn ace. The Cardinal had a scare
when Nnamani went to the sideline with an injury (a bruised
knee cap) at 21-16, but she returned to the game six points later.
Nnamani recorded her fifth kill of the game to seal the 30-22 win
and tie the match.
The Cardinal jumped out to an early lead in game three,
going up 11 -4 after Richards recorded an impressive six kills and
a block assist in a 10-point span. The Cardinal continued to
steamroll the Cougars, leading by as much as 13. WSU managed
to close in slightly, but Stanford won 30-22 on Richards's 11th
kill of the third game.
The fourth game was more evenly played, with neither team
able to break away. Stanford led by four at one point, but held
only a two-point advantage, 15-13, at the media timeout. The
Cougars fought hard to come back but the Cardinal extended
their lead, and took the game 30-25.
"It was a good win for us and a good step forward toward the
Arizona schools next week," Dunning said.
The Cardinal host Arizona State and No. 8 Arizona — who
beat Stanford in Arizona a few weeks ago — on Thursday and
Friday. The homestand looks like a welcome break after the gru
eling trip between Seattle and Pullman on Friday.
"The team loves playing in front of people who love the pro
gram. the local crowds," Dunning said. "And they love to play in
Maples. Washington is a tough place to go."
