# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## No. 4 women show off power against Cougars 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
111 an offense depleted by injury, Sta
nford junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards is thriving in the spotlight. For
the first time in her career, Richards is
the primary offensive threat for the No 4
women's volleyball team, and she shoul
dered the responsibility admirably with a
career performance in Washington State
on Friday.
For her first two years with Stanford
(21-4, 10-3 Pacific-10 Conference),
Richards shared the court with four-time
Ail-American and Honda/Broderick
Cup winner Ogonna Nnamani.This sea
son, the Cardinal's balanced attack had
been dealt a blow with a season-ending
injury to freshman outside hitter Cynthia
Barboza, leaving Richards, supported by
freshman middle blocker Foluke Akin
radewo to lead the offense.
In Friday's 3-1 victory over Washing
ton State (8-17, 1-11 Pac-10), Richards
pounded 31 kills — demolishing her pre

vious career high of 24 — while hitting at
a .426 clip.
"I think she felt like she had not
played well enough the night before,"
head coach John Dunning said of
Richards, who had only 13 kills and hit
.140 in a loss to Washington on Thursday.
"She has really been stepping up to be
come someone we can count on. She
played very aggressive and focused
against WSU. She just really decided to
go for it."
Richards was not the only Stanford
player with a career night at Washington
State. With her second dig of the match,
senior libero Courtney Schultz reached
the I,(XK)-dig mark in her career. Her 20
digs on the night leave her one short of
breaking into the all-time Stanford top
10 in career digs.
Senior setter Katie Goldhahn, who
stepped in after sophomore setter Bryn
Kehoe broke her hand last week, had ca
reer highs with 68 assists and six kills.
