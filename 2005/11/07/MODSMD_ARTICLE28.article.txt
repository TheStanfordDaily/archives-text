# FIELD HOCKEY
## One up, two down for Card 
### ROHAN PURANIK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ilie .Stanford women's field hockey team
managed to pick up a victory against Ap
palachian State in its last weekend of play
but suffered two tough losses against rivals
California and Radford in the Northern Pa
cific Conference championship at Berkeley
The Stanford squad (6-12) began the
tournament on a strong note with a domi

nant 5-1 victory over the Mountaineers last
Thursday.
Junior defender/midfielder Julia Drewes
scored Stanford's first goal of the tourna
ment 8:11 minutes into the game to give
Stanford an early lead in the match. Jess
Zutz, a sophomore midfielder/forward,
scored two additional unassisted goals at
10:07 and 63:06 to build Stanford's lead.
Close loss to Cal devastating

Junior forward Liz Robinson
and freshman forward/midfielder
Hilary Braun also scored in the last
minutes of the game to cap off the
Stanford victory.
The Cardinal outshot the
Mountaineers 21-7. with the only
goal for Appalachian State (3-12)
coming from senior defender Car
rie Johnson at 33:26.
Stanford's three goals in the
final 10 minutes of the game gave
the Cardinal confidence going into
the semifinals against top-seeded
Cal.
The Golden Bears' junior for
ward Valentina Godfrid, who leads
the NorPac in points, scored both
of the Bears' goals as Berkeley
emerged triumphant over the Car
dinal squad, 2-1.
"This was a disappointing loss,
especially when we competed so
well," Stanford head coach Lesley
Irvine said. "All three games be
tween Cal and Stanford have been
phenomenal games of field hockey.
Our girls played a great game, and
I'm very proud of them."
Godfrid scored 11 minutes into
the game to give Cal an early lead,
but the Cardinal were able to hold
off the Cal offense for over 50 min
utes — until Godfrid scored again
to give the Bears the victory.
"We dominated the field and let
balls slip past the posts of the goal
and just couldn't finish,"

"A// three games
between Cal and
Stanford have been
phenomenal games of
field hockey. Our girls
played a great game,
and Vm very proud
of them

minutes of the game to cap off the
Stanford victory.
The Cardinal outshot the
Mountaineers 21-7. with the only
goal for Appalachian State (3-12)
coming from senior defender Car
rie Johnson at 33:26.
Stanford's three goals in the
final 10 minutes of the game gave
the Cardinal confidence going into
the semifinals against top-seeded
Cal.
The Golden Bears' junior for
ward Valentina Godfrid, who leads
the NorPac in points, scored both
of the Bears' goals as Berkeley
emerged triumphant over the Car
dinal squad, 2-1.
"This was a disappointing loss,
especially when we competed so
well," Stanford head coach Lesley
Irvine said. "All three games be
tween Cal and Stanford have been
phenomenal games of field hockey.
Our girls played a great game, and
I'm very proud of them."
Godfrid scored 11 minutes into
the game to give Cal an early lead,
but the Cardinal were able to hold
off the Cal offense for over 50 min
utes — until Godfrid scored again
to give the Bears the victory.
"We dominated the field and let
balls slip past the posts of the goal
and just couldn't finish,"

"A// three games
between Cal and
Stanford have been
phenomenal games of
field hockey. Our girls
played a great game,
and Vm very proud
of them
