# Dalai Lama visits Stanford
## Community welcomes the 14th Dalai Lama to the Stanford campus 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was perhaps not as coveted as a guest
spot on "The O.C" or an acceptance to a top
law school, but a ticket to see the Dalai
Lama speak last Friday was certainly a hot
commodity.
Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama,
spiritual leader of the Tibetan people and
winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, spent
a total of four hours discussing his views on
meditation, non-violent resistance and
other topics on Friday.
The 70-year-old leader delighted
crowds with his mischievous wit. After
lofty introductions from Rev. Scotty
McLennan, dean for Religious Life, and
University President John Hennessy, he
carefully unlaced his shoes and told the
crowd "1 first have to sit more comfort
ably," before sitting cross-legged on his or-

nate chair and chuckling to himself.
The Dalai Lama's English is conversationally fluent,
but lacking in technical terms, and when he stumbled
for words he made use of his translator, Geshe Thupten
Jinpa, who sat at his side. At one point he gestured to
ward his long-term translator and marveled at the fact
that "My study of English started before this one's
birth," in 1958. Poking fun at Jinpa, he added."His Eng
lish is better, but my voice is better."
The morning session, which took place in Maples
Pavilion, was attended by approximately 6.5(H) people.
The Dalai Lama, wearing his familiar red-and-yellow
robes, took the stage bowing with his hands together in
front of his face in his famous gesture of peace. Among
other points, he commented on the power of education
to allow people to better recognize truths and the abili
ty of negative emotions to obscure that truth.
"Negative emotions are actually one of the greatest
obstacles of seeing reality clearly," he said.
He concluded his morning talk by leading a five
minute meditation session for the crowd.
"So now let us meditate," he said. "But if you take
this opportunity for sleep, you should not snore," he
added, eliciting laughter from the crowd.
His afternoon appearance in Memorial Church, be
fore a full-capacity audience of 1,500 people, consisted
of a dialogue between himself and McLennan on the
topic of non-violent resistance. He advocated a position
that was far from that of a strict pacifist, to the surprise
of many in the audience.
"Any action motivated by social concern, compas
sion— that's essentially non-violent," he said in re

sponse to a question from McLennan on the acceptabil
ity of violence in self-defense.
Asked about the moral Tightness of the Iraq war. the
Dalai Lama offered only historical examples and ambi
guity.
"History showed that the Second World War served
us, protected," he said. "TTie Vietnam War — same mo
tivation. same goal — protect Vietnam. But eventually,
very wrong."
The current Iraq war, he said, will be judged by his
tory.
"Up to now. difficult to say," he said.
Even so, he gave a tangential answer to the same
question by saying emphatically that "the concept of
war is outdated."
Audience members were able to submit questions
via the Internet ahead of time, and event coordinators
selected a number to pose to the Dalai Lama at the end
of each session. Some skewed toward the ridiculous, in
cluding, "What's the best thing about being the Dalai
Lama?" and another asked the Dalai Lama for his posi
tion on massages.
Even if the questions were less than incisive at times,
students said they enjoyed every moment of their op
portunity to see the religious figure.
"I thought he was probably one of the most adorable
public speakers I've ever seen." said Niko Malkovich. a
sophomore who attended the morning session on med
itation. "I don't know how you could not like him.There
were some questions that bothered me a little bit. but
his answers were perfect. He's very funny, so endearing
that I could not help but like him."
