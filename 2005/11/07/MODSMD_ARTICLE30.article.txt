### KELLEY FONG 
Students will soon he reaping the benefits of
Stanford's recently unveiled International Ini
tiative, which aims to strengthen the connection
between Stanford University and the global
community, as well as confront international is
sues.
"One of the things I like most about Stanford
is its global feel," said freshman Adam Cole.
"When I came here. I feel like 1 left the United
States and entered this world state. I'm in close
contact with people from such different geo
graphical and ideological locations."
Indeed, Stanford prides itself on its emphasis
on and commitment to issues extending beyond
those of the United States. It is with this global
perspective in mind that Stanford brings such
studies to the forefront through the Initiative.
The Faculty Steering Committee of the Initia
tive is co-chaired by Political Science Prof. Coit
Blacker, director of the Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies, and Management Sci
ence and Engineering Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cor
nell,senior fellow at the Institute for Internation
al Studies.
Blacker called the Initiative "a campus-wide
effort, involving all seven of Stanford's schools, to
deepen and extend the University's global reach

and to enhance our ability to contribute to the
consideration and resolution of key international
challenges."
This will be done in several ways. According to
Blacker, Stanford will use the funds it has secured
so far to "increase the number of faculty focusing
on international issues, to attract more under
graduates from countries other than the United
States, and to support promising new research
and teaching programs that will span existing
schools and departments."
The International Initiative has collected a
total of approximately $100 million in gifts and
pledges from various sources.
The money will support many programs, in
cluding the Presidential Fund for Innovation in
International Studies. Launched last spring, it
will support interdisciplinary faculty teams en
gaged in research about and in the teaching of in
ternational studies.
In a presentation to the Faculty Senate on Oct.
27, Blacker and Pate-Cornell emphasized the "in
tegration of curiosity-based and problem-orient
ed research," which will help confront the inter
national challenges cited by the Steering Com
mittee.
The challenges identified include enhancing
the prospects for peace and security worldwide,
reforming and improving governance within all
forms and levels of society and advancing human
health and well-being.These issues will be the ini
tial focus of the International Initiative's work.
Blacker added that "other themes and issues

will emerge as the Initiative develops and ma
tures."
ITie results and procedures of the Internation
al Initiative will directly impact students at Stan
ford.
"Students will benefit in numerous ways, from
having more internationally oriented courses
from which to choose to having a more diverse
student body," Blacker said. "We also anticipate
more opportunities for students to take part in
cutting-edge research projects, to become more
deeply involved in more policy-oriented research
and to study and work abroad."
Some students, however, said they were un
aware of the initiative.
"To be honest I've never heard of this Interna
tional Initiative, which leads me to believe they
need to work on their advertising more," said
senior Mike Sciler. an international relations
major. "In theory it sounds interesting, almost
like an international version of the Roosevelt In
stitution."
Blacker also said he encourages students to
share their ideas for new courses and programs
with faculty members, as the initiative is student
focused and student-driven.
"Much of the impetus behind the Internation
al Initiative comes from our students, whose in
terest in global issues — from alleviating world
poverty and halting the spread of HIV/AIDS to
preventing conflict and protecting the human
rights of those most at risk — has never been
greater," Blacker said.
