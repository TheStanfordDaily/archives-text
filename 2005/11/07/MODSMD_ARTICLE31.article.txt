## ME student to be reality TV star 
### KAT LEWIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sun Koo Kim, a second-year master's student in
mechanical engineering, flew to Australia to compete
in the new reality show "Chasing Nature" on Thurs
day, Nov. 3. The show, set to premiere on Discovery
Channel's Animal Planet next year, will feature me
chanical engineering students from universities across
the nation attempting to recreate animal attributes
with their mechanical know-how.
"Our objective is to make machinery that is sup
posed to resemble the function of an animal, like an
eagle wing or an orangutan hanging onto a tree," Kim
said. "The interesting part is that you have to test it
out yourself. If you make a wing, you have to fly. You
jump off a cliff; you have to test it with your own
body."
Contestants are separated into teams of four stu
dents and given four days to conceptualize and imple
ment their design — one day to design it, two to build
it and one more to test it.
Kim will spend 10 days in Australia.The trip is part
of his educational experience on the show, according
to his girlfriend Lily Chu, Class of 20()5.
"It's a full-expense paid trip to Australia." Chu
said. "They're taking him out on little field trips here
and there. For him, someone who really wants to de
sign in the future, it will really increase his expo
sure."
Kim is not the only Stanford student to have partic
ipated in the show. Last May, four graduate students
were flown to Australia to tape the pilot episode. One
of the four, Mark Bianco, a mechanical engineering
student with a focus in design, called the show "a great
experience."
"We had to build something fairly complex in a
short amount of time." Bianco said. "There was defi
nitely a lot of engineering involved. I think that our de
sign program here is really a great program and it def
initely helped."
Kim said he is confident that his work at Stanford
will help him on "Chasing Nature."
"The reason I think they started out with Stanford
is because Stanford has one of the best product design
and mechanical engineering programs in the nation."
he said. "Especially in the graduate departments, they
have great curricula to make students creative and
help them come up with wacky ideas. I have benefit
ed in the last year by taking courses and doing proj
ects."
Chu is also optimistic about Kim's chances on the
show. She said she believes that his personality and ex
perience in the field — such as working in Germany at

BMW — should help him.
"He really looks to nature for inspiration," Chu
said. "He feels that the world is the most complex and
well-created thing we have at our fingertips.This show
is perfect for him — and they always say that pressure
induces creativity."
The entertainment aspect of the show makes this
experience unique from most mechanical engineering
projects. Although the dialogue is unscripted, accord
ing to Bianco, the presence of cameramen adds an un
usual element.
"I'd say it's kind of tough to combine engineering
and acting into one thing," Bianco recalled. "We went
into there thinking, we're engineers, we've got to build
this thing, we've got to design it; but at the same time,
they're trying to make a television show, so there's al
ways a camera in your face."
However. Kim said that he is "not worried" about
being on camera.
"We've been doing projects all along," he said. "It's
what we're trained to do. We're going to come up with
a solution, whether it be good or not. We're just going
to enjoy the process."
The show is, according to Kim, targeted toward
children and their parents, and it will provide informa
tion about both nature and engineering.
"In terms of reality shows, this is as good as it gets,"
Chu said."lt's something that will hopefully show kids
how engineering can be fun. how it's exciting and use
ful. It will definitely be educational for the people who
watch it."
