# Buddhists, neurologists and psychologists discuss craving and suffering
## 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The Dalai Lama, sitting cross-legged
and shoeless on a large red chair, joined re
ligious and medical experts in a sold-out
Memorial Auditorium on Saturday to dis
cuss the Buddhist and medical approaches
to craving and suffering.
The day-long seminar on spiritual and
scientific explorations of the human expe
rience focused on discovering the basis of
these two impulses. The two sessions were
billed by planners as the continuation of a
long dialogue between religious and med
ical experts aimed at building a common
understanding of how the brain functions
and how suffering can be alleviated. As the
1,7(X) people watched in the audience,
more listened to the event on Stanford's
KZSU or watched it live on the Internet.
"We chose these two topics [craving
Buddhists debate scientists

and suffering] because they are so
central to Buddhist thought and so
interesting to our scientists," said
William Mobley, moderator of the
conference and director of the Neu
roscience Institute at Stanford.
A friendly but sometimes heated
exchange among neurologists, psy
chologists and Buddhist theorists
covered a wide-ranging and mostly
unscripted variety of issues. But both
religious and medical panelists ex
pressed a strong desire to work to
gether and learn from each other.
"This is not about trying to apply
scientific method to religion or ap
plying faith to science," said Philip
Pizzo, dean of the School of Medi
cine. "These are all parts of the
human experience. It's about bound
aries and where they overlap and
connect."
Telling the audience that "we are a
bit backwards," Tenzin Gyatso, the
14th Dalai Lama, said Buddhists
could learn from science. "For Bud
dhists, it is extremely useful to learn
from scientific findings, scientific ex
ploration."
In the morning session, the pan
elists discussed why humans crave.
Much of the talk surrounded differ
ing definitions of craving and desire.
Neurologists use craving to describe
any desire, including breathing and
eating. Buddhists define craving as
only unhealthy desires.
"Buddhists define craving as a
kind of desire in which one falsely su
perimposes agreeable qualities upon
an object, cognitively screens out its
disagreeable qualities, and then de
sires the object as a true source of
pleasure and well-being," said Allan
Wallace, the founder of the Santa
Barbara Institute for Consciousness
Studies. "None of these objects are
actual sources of genuine well
being."
Howard Fields, director of the
Wheeler Center for the Neurobiolo
gy of Addiction at UC-San Francisco,
provided the audience with the neu
roscientific definition of the same
term.
"Craving is the subjective corre
late of strong motivation for any
goal," he said. "The goal could be
something needed to maintain a
state that is necessary for individual
survival, including food, drink,
warmth or rest. The goal could be
something needed for species sur
vival. Whatever the goal, the neuro
biological view is that cravings arise
from chemical changes in the brain
that lead to activity in neurons that
are connected to the sense organs
and muscles."
The scientists debated the reli
gious leaders about whether or not
modern medicine could or should be
used to alleviate craving. The Bud
dhists contended that drugs alter per
ception and cause recklessness. The
scientists countered that medicine
can help focus the mind and suppress
unhealthy desire.
After listening to the doctors ex
plain progress in developing hunger
suppression drugs, the 70-year-old
Dalai Lama wondered if a drug could
be designed to kill all cravings.
"Such a drug might produce a
state of coma," replied Fields.
"That's a disaster," the Dalai
Lama said, drawing laughter from the
audience.
"The opposite of awakening,"
Fields agreed.
Wallace added that drugs used to
kill cravings were anathema to Bud
dhists, who believe that the mind can
overcome craving and desire through
thoughtful meditation and strength

of will.
"The drug suppressing craving
could stop you from developing the
wisdom to understand and move on
from craving," he said.
In the second session, the panelists
discussed causes and treatment for
pain and suffering.
The neuroscientific definition was
highly technical and explained in a
PowerPoint presentation with maps
of the brain and the central nervous
system.
"Neuroscience defines suffering
as activation of neural subsystems
that trigger emotions associated with
distress — pain, fear,sadness, depres
sion, anxiety," said Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences Prof. David
Spiegel. "They are often tied to pri
mary external sensory experience in
volving body damage, threat, grief
and loss and then have secondary
elaborations more removed from
such trigger stimuli that yield a more
pervasive result from a less specific
stimulus."
He also explained how western
medicine deals with suffering.
"The strain in pain lies mainly in
the brain," he said. "The traditional
western approach has been to reduce
pain input into the nervous system.
Sometimes it has worked, but it's not
the whole answer."
The Buddhists offered a nuanced
definition that differentiated pain
and suffering from unhappiness.
"Suffering can be triggered by nu
merous causes over which we some
times have some power, and some
times none," said Mathieu Ricard, a
French monk philosopher. "Unhap
piness is altogether different, being
the way in which we experience our
suffering. Unhappiness may indeed
be associated with physical or moral
pain inflicted by exterior conditions,
but it is not essentially linked to it."
Ricard offered a more nuanced in
terpretation of Buddhist views by
discussing the challenge of translat
ing from Sanskrit to English.
"The Sanskrit word dukha, usual
ly translated as affliction, misery or
suffering does not define simply an
unpleasant sensation, but rather re
flects a fundamental vulnerability to
suffering and pain," he said.
Helen Mayberg, professor of Psy
chiatry and Neurology at Emory
University, questioned the Buddhist
claim that suffering could be alleviat
ed only through changing the way
one thinks about their pain. She ex
plained an electrical stimulation ex
periment she has been conducting
with extremely depressed patients
that disables some brain functions
and shows early indications of suc
cess.
"Looking at extremely ill patients,
the brain is hijacked," she said, noting
that meditation in and of itself can
not solve severe depression or de
mentia. "The limbic system enslaves
the cortex. The process of recovery
becomes one of trying to establish
balance."
The panelists discussed different
kinds of emotion and how compas
sion for others is generated. They
agreed that there is an important dis
tinction between self-importance
and self-confidence.
The Dalai Lama, whose followers
believe he is the reincarnation of the
Buddha of Compassion, tried to draw
a distinction between experiencing
personal pain and empathy for oth
ers.
"I think our brain is really fool
ish," the Dalai Lama said, after neu
rologists explained that the same
area of the brain reacts both when

sensing one's own pain and sensing
another's pain.
One neurologist offered an idea of
studying adept people who use voli
tion in order to better understand
how compassion affects the brain.
"Neuroscience is still largely
primitive, but I think we can
progress," said Psychology Prof.
Brian Knutson.
At the end of the talk, the Dalai
Lama and the panelists expressed
great satisfaction at having the op
portunity to speak to each other and
discuss deep underlying issues in
both their fields.
"One strong feeling 1 have as a re
sult of this exchange is that there is
definitely potential for real inter
faith," the Dalai Lama said. "This has
reinforced my beliefs that all these
discussions are leading to good bene
fits."
The Dalai Lama's visit to the
Unites States has sparked some con
troversy. A scheduled speech to the
Society for Neuroscience next week
in Washington, DC. has prompted
more than 6(H) neuroscientists to sign
a petition encouraging the organiza
tion to un-invite the Dalai Lama, as
serting that his research is not replic
able or valid.
The speakers at the conference —
while avoiding direct references —
made allusions to the conflict.
"A lot of my colleagues would dis
agree with this forum," said Neurobi
ology Prof. William Newsome, calling
the School of Medicine "courageous"
for hosting the event.
"In this time when things are so
polarized, when both sides can be so
closed-minded and dogmatic, today
has been a joy," Wallace said.
The Dalai Lama is known in many
circles for his efforts to create an in
dependent Tibet and to allow Ti
betans the right to freely practice
their Buddhism once again. Politics
were avoided on Saturday, however,
with the exception of a defiant refer
ence made by Pizzo in his closing re
marks.
"I hope that the world will be
come enlightened enough to support
the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism in
Tibet," he said to rousing applause,
cheers and a standing ovation.
The conference was the culmina
tion of a two-year effort made by
Pizzo's wife Peggy. According to the
current issue of Stanford Medicine
Magazine, she said she was inspired
by the Dalai Lama's teachings during
her recovery from a car accident. She
was later motivated by a Continuing
Studies course to invite the leader to
campus. The Dalai Lama, who last
visited Stanford in 1994, said he was
drawn to the University because of
its preeminent neuroscience faculty
and field-leading research.
Some members of the audience
said they were moved by the event.
"Toward the end, it was really a
conversation," said Mary Coady of
Menlo Park. "1 felt what the scientists
were saying about Buddhism aiding
some of their work on relieving
human suffering made fora .really
powerful day."
Attendee Bill Thompson brought
his family from Phoenix to attend the
event.
"The dialogue was unstructured
enough, but there was a framework,"
he said. "It was a great dialogue, as
opposed to a lecture. The view points
were juxtaposed without placing one
above another. I think they came to
the realization that they need to get
through the semantics before they
move on."
Many said they were energized by

the sessions.
"The objective of Buddhists and
scientists is the same in that both
want to know the truth," said Susie
Egri. a practitioner of Buddhism.
"That's what the Buddhist perspec
tive has been all along. For the scien
tists, their means of study are an op
portunity to prove the same objec
tive."
Some were impressed by how the
seemingly conflicting topics of reli
gion and science could find so much

in common so quickly.
"I think toward the end they start
ed to really come together," said Lisa
Voyer, who drove up from Orange
County to listen to the religious
leader. "The neurologists began to
open up more toward the end."
Others expressed a hope that Sat
urday's session would lead to contin
ued dialogue and discussion.
"1 hope they can find a way to go
past this event to have more discus
sions and keep these discussions

going," said Paula Jones of Santa
Clara.
Sophomore Mathew Velasco
echoed this sentiment.
"The prospect of an overlap be
tween science and religion is an in
triguing one," he said. "I liked the
parts of the symposia where they ad
dressed the concrete possibility of
marrying Buddhism and science.This
was a great opportunity for Stanford
students — spending a Saturday with
the Dalai Lama isn't all bad."
