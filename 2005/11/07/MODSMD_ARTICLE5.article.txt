## Students weigh in on props 
### AMIT ARORA 
California special election fervor
continues to run high on campus and
across the state, as polling begins to
morrow. The eight initiatives on the
ballot have elicited controversy, and
various lobbying groups have heavily
funded support and opposition cam
paigns for the propositions.
Some of the key issues to be decid
ed in the Nov. 8 election include
teacher tenure, the political use of
union dues and budget reform poli
cies. Propositions 74, 75 and 76 are
outlined below.
Prop. 74:
Prop. 74 outlines an expansion of
the teacher probation period from
its current two-year span to five
years. The measure would signifi

cure tenure and would mark a dra

California.
Supporters for the bill contend
that California schools have been
consistently below average in the na

held accountable for the low per
formance scores of their students.
Prop. 74 would change this by allow
ing school districts the ability to re
move teachers after two consecutive
unsatisfactory performance evalua
tions.
Opponents, however, argue that
teachers are not to blame for low stu
dent achievement scores in the state.
Rather, public education has not
been adequately funded, and some
suggest that the current administra
tion has refused the necessary grants
needed to improve the state's schools.
On campus, a number of organiza
tions have been active in the initia
tives and election process. The Stan
ford College Republicans have held
speakers' forums to discuss the ballot
and its various political issues. Senior
Bob Sensenbrenner, former presi
dent of the student group, discussed
his own opinions regarding the meas
ure with The Daily.
"Proposition 74 will streamline
the ability of the districts to get rid of
the bad apples in the school system,"
he said. "Currently the process for
teacher removal can cost up to
$120,000, and the initiative provides
some relief for that."
The Stanford Democrats have
also been active in encouraging stu
dents to vote and have campaigned
extensively regarding the initiatives.
