## Students weigh in on props 
### AMIT ARORA 
California special election fervor
continues to run high on campus and
across the state, as polling begins to
morrow. The eight initiatives on the
ballot have elicited controversy, and
various lobbying groups have heavily
funded support and opposition cam
paigns for the propositions.
Some of the key issues to be decid
ed in the Nov. 8 election include
teacher tenure, the political use of
union dues and budget reform poli
cies. Propositions 74, 75 and 76 are
outlined below.
Prop. 74:
Prop. 74 outlines an expansion of
the teacher probation period from
its current two-year span to five
years. The measure would signifi
cantly affect a teacher's ability to se
cure tenure and would mark a dra
matic change of education policy in
California.
Supporters for the bill contend
that California schools have been
consistently below average in the na
tion. They argue that teachers are not
held accountable for the low per
formance scores of their students.
Prop. 74 would change this by allow
ing school districts the ability to re
move teachers after two consecutive
unsatisfactory performance evalua
tions.
Opponents, however, argue that
teachers are not to blame for low stu
dent achievement scores in the state.
Rather, public education has not
been adequately funded, and some
suggest that the current administra
tion has refused the necessary grants
needed to improve the state's schools.
On campus, a number of organiza
tions have been active in the initia
tives and election process. The Stan
ford College Republicans have held
speakers' forums to discuss the ballot
and its various political issues. Senior
Bob Sensenbrenner, former presi
dent of the student group, discussed
his own opinions regarding the meas
ure with The Daily.
"Proposition 74 will streamline
the ability of the districts to get rid of
the bad apples in the school system,"
he said. "Currently the process for
teacher removal can cost up to
$120,000, and the initiative provides
some relief for that."
The Stanford Democrats have
also been active in encouraging stu
dents to vote and have campaigned
extensively regarding the initiatives.
Through "Get Out the Vote'' rallies in
White Plaza and posting fliers in the
dormitories, the Stanford Democrats
said they hope to attract students to
polling booths.
Sophomore Margot Isman, presi
dent of the Stanford Democrats,
noted the possible consequences of
the initiative in terms of employment.
"The last thing California needs is
scaring away qualified young people
interested in teaching in its schools,"
she said. "Proposition 74 blames the
schools' performances on teachers
and ignores the fact that schools are
under-funded."
Currently, Prop. 74 is the most con
troversial on the ballot.The Field Re
search Corporation reported that 44
percent support the initiative, while
50 percent oppose it.The Los Angeles
Times indicated an even closer vote,
with 45 percent in favor of the meas
ure and 47 percent against.
Prop. 75:
Prop. 75 introduces restrictions on
California's public unions and re
quires that union members express
written consent for the use of their
dues for political activities.The initia
tive aims to regulate the lobbying ef
forts of public unions and mandates
that detailed records be maintained
for union expenditures.
The measure has received support
from the Republican Party and has
been backed by the business commu
nity. These groups argue that individ
ual union members often endorse
certain political agendas without
fully understanding the issues. By re
quiring consent, union members will
have more control over political
spending.
Sensenbrenner addressed the cur
rent failings of regulations for union
contributions.
"It is important to compare the
political contributions of the unions
with the political preference of rank
and-file members," Sensenbrenner
said. "Proposition 75 addresses that
disparity in support."
Opponents to Prop. 75, however,
argue that the initiative purposefully
targets public unions only. They as
sert that the proposition unfairly hin
ders the ability of teachers, nurses,
firefighters, police and other public
employees to participate in the polit
ical process. These groups, such as the
Alliance fora Better America, often
cite the billions of dollars spent on
lobbying interests by big business
and special interests groups in Cali
fornia state politics.
The Stanford Democrats shared
these concerns,and Isman questioned
the validity of a measure like Prop. 75.

"Currently public union members
have the ability of opting out of polit
ical contributions and as many as 25
percent already do," she said. "It's
ridiculous that the governor thinks
he knows how the unions should
spend the money instead of the union
members themselves."
Both the Field Poll and the Los
Angeles Times reported that 40 per
cent of those surveyed would support
Prop. 75. However, 50 percent op
posed the initiative in the Field Poll
and 51 percent were against the
measure in the Los Angeles Times.
Statistical research also indicates
that support for the initiative has
steadily fallen in the last eight weeks,
as unions have increased their adver
tisement spending in opposition.
Prop. 76:
Prop. 76 has been titled the "Cali
fornia Live Within Our Means Act."
The measure limits the annual
growth of the budget by the average
growth in revenue during the past
three years. The proposed initiative
aims to control state spending and re
duce the deficit.
The bill has been heavily backed
by the governor and the Republican
Party. Advocates for Prop. 76 argues
that California's economic growth
has been hampered by the
unchecked spending of the state leg
islature. These groups maintained the
need fora balanced budget and
called for broad-based cuts in spend
ing.
Prop. 76 has been actively op
posed by teachers' unions, who as
serted that the governor has pushed
for the initiative to avoid funding
public education as Prop. 98 mandat
ed. These groups even cited that the
measure was initially drafted by the
attorney general to curtail education
spending.
"The governor has broken his
promise on Prop. 98 for two years in a
row now," Isman noted. "Education
spending must be the first priority."
Other opponents questioned the
unilateral control the governor
would hold over budget cuts if the
initiative passed. Katie Quan,chair of
the Center for Labor Research and
Education at UC-Berkeley, high
lighted these concerns.
"Three times each year, outside of
the regular budget cycle, the gover
nor can willfully declare a budget
emergency," she said. "The budget
process must involve the legislature
and lawmakers. Schwarzenneger is
bypassing the entire political
process."
Some supporters for the measure
argue that it is not about cuts in edu
cation; rather, the budget must be
balanced and state spending must be
limited.
"From 1998 to 2004, spending

grew by 44 percent," Sensenhrenner
noted. "The legislature has had con
trol over the budget and has not been
able to properly manage it."
Current polls indicate that oppo
sition to Prop.76 is quite strong in
California. The Field Foil showed
only 32 percent in support of the
measure, with 60 percent opposed.
The Los Angeles Times revealed sim
ilar numbers with 31 percent and 60
percent respectively.
Although there is disagreement
over the election issues, activists from
both political parties continue to en

courage Californians to participate in
the process.
"If you look at the polling a month
ago. most of the propositions were
going to get blown out of the water,"
Sensenbrenner said. "Now it's quite
close. Election results are not decid
ed till election day."
Both the College Republicans
and the Stanford Democrats will con
tinue to encourage students to vote.
Polling booths will be open until 8
p.m. in the Faisan Lounge in Florence
Moore Hall and the Graduate Stu
dent Community Center.

California special election fervor
continues to run high on campus and
across the state, as polling begins to
morrow. The eight initiatives on the
ballot have elicited controversy, and
various lobbying groups have heavily
funded support and opposition cam
paigns for the propositions.
Some of the key issues to be decid
ed in the Nov. 8 election include
teacher tenure, the political use of
union dues and budget reform poli
cies. Propositions 74, 75 and 76 are
outlined below.
Prop. 74:
Prop. 74 outlines an expansion of
the teacher probation period from
its current two-year span to five
years. The measure would signifi
cantly affect a teacher's ability to se
cure tenure and would mark a dra
matic change of education policy in
California.
Supporters for the bill contend
that California schools have been
consistently below average in the na
tion. They argue that teachers are not
held accountable for the low per
formance scores of their students.
Prop. 74 would change this by allow
ing school districts the ability to re
move teachers after two consecutive
unsatisfactory performance evalua
tions.
Opponents, however, argue that
teachers are not to blame for low stu
dent achievement scores in the state.
Rather, public education has not
been adequately funded, and some
suggest that the current administra
tion has refused the necessary grants
needed to improve the state's schools.
On campus, a number of organiza
tions have been active in the initia
tives and election process. The Stan
ford College Republicans have held
speakers' forums to discuss the ballot
and its various political issues. Senior
Bob Sensenbrenner, former presi
dent of the student group, discussed
his own opinions regarding the meas
ure with The Daily.
"Proposition 74 will streamline
the ability of the districts to get rid of
the bad apples in the school system,"
he said. "Currently the process for
teacher removal can cost up to
$120,000, and the initiative provides
some relief for that."
The Stanford Democrats have
also been active in encouraging stu
dents to vote and have campaigned
extensively regarding the initiatives.
Through "Get Out the Vote'' rallies in
White Plaza and posting fliers in the
dormitories, the Stanford Democrats
said they hope to attract students to
polling booths.
Sophomore Margot Isman, presi
dent of the Stanford Democrats,
noted the possible consequences of
the initiative in terms of employment.
"The last thing California needs is
scaring away qualified young people
interested in teaching in its schools,"
she said. "Proposition 74 blames the
schools' performances on teachers
and ignores the fact that schools are
under-funded."
Currently, Prop. 74 is the most con
troversial on the ballot.The Field Re
search Corporation reported that 44
percent support the initiative, while
50 percent oppose it.The Los Angeles
Times indicated an even closer vote,
with 45 percent in favor of the meas
ure and 47 percent against.
Prop. 75:
Prop. 75 introduces restrictions on
California's public unions and re
quires that union members express
written consent for the use of their
dues for political activities.The initia
tive aims to regulate the lobbying ef
forts of public unions and mandates
that detailed records be maintained
for union expenditures.
The measure has received support
from the Republican Party and has
been backed by the business commu
nity. These groups argue that individ
ual union members often endorse
certain political agendas without
fully understanding the issues. By re
quiring consent, union members will
have more control over political
spending.
Sensenbrenner addressed the cur
rent failings of regulations for union
contributions.
"It is important to compare the
political contributions of the unions
with the political preference of rank
and-file members," Sensenbrenner
said. "Proposition 75 addresses that
disparity in support."
Opponents to Prop. 75, however,
argue that the initiative purposefully
targets public unions only. They as
sert that the proposition unfairly hin
ders the ability of teachers, nurses,
firefighters, police and other public
employees to participate in the polit
ical process. These groups, such as the
Alliance fora Better America, often
cite the billions of dollars spent on
lobbying interests by big business
and special interests groups in Cali
fornia state politics.
The Stanford Democrats shared
these concerns,and Isman questioned
the validity of a measure like Prop. 75.

"Currently public union members
have the ability of opting out of polit
ical contributions and as many as 25
percent already do," she said. "It's
ridiculous that the governor thinks
he knows how the unions should
spend the money instead of the union
members themselves."
Both the Field Poll and the Los
Angeles Times reported that 40 per
cent of those surveyed would support
Prop. 75. However, 50 percent op
posed the initiative in the Field Poll
and 51 percent were against the
measure in the Los Angeles Times.
Statistical research also indicates
that support for the initiative has
steadily fallen in the last eight weeks,
as unions have increased their adver
tisement spending in opposition.
Prop. 76:
Prop. 76 has been titled the "Cali
fornia Live Within Our Means Act."
The measure limits the annual
growth of the budget by the average
growth in revenue during the past
three years. The proposed initiative
aims to control state spending and re
duce the deficit.
The bill has been heavily backed
by the governor and the Republican
Party. Advocates for Prop. 76 argues
that California's economic growth
has been hampered by the
unchecked spending of the state leg
islature. These groups maintained the
need fora balanced budget and
called for broad-based cuts in spend
ing.
Prop. 76 has been actively op
posed by teachers' unions, who as
serted that the governor has pushed
for the initiative to avoid funding
public education as Prop. 98 mandat
ed. These groups even cited that the
measure was initially drafted by the
attorney general to curtail education
spending.
"The governor has broken his
promise on Prop. 98 for two years in a
row now," Isman noted. "Education
spending must be the first priority."
Other opponents questioned the
unilateral control the governor
would hold over budget cuts if the
initiative passed. Katie Quan,chair of
the Center for Labor Research and
Education at UC-Berkeley, high
lighted these concerns.
"Three times each year, outside of
the regular budget cycle, the gover
nor can willfully declare a budget
emergency," she said. "The budget
process must involve the legislature
and lawmakers. Schwarzenneger is
bypassing the entire political
process."
Some supporters for the measure
argue that it is not about cuts in edu
cation; rather, the budget must be
balanced and state spending must be
limited.
"From 1998 to 2004, spending

grew by 44 percent," Sensenhrenner
noted. "The legislature has had con
trol over the budget and has not been
able to properly manage it."
Current polls indicate that oppo
sition to Prop.76 is quite strong in
California. The Field Foil showed
only 32 percent in support of the
measure, with 60 percent opposed.
The Los Angeles Times revealed sim
ilar numbers with 31 percent and 60
percent respectively.
Although there is disagreement
over the election issues, activists from
both political parties continue to en

courage Californians to participate in
the process.
"If you look at the polling a month
ago. most of the propositions were
going to get blown out of the water,"
Sensenbrenner said. "Now it's quite
close. Election results are not decid
ed till election day."
Both the College Republicans

and the Stanford Democrats will con

California special election fervor
continues to run high on campus and
across the state, as polling begins to
morrow. The eight initiatives on the
ballot have elicited controversy, and
various lobbying groups have heavily
funded support and opposition cam
paigns for the propositions.
Some of the key issues to be decid
ed in the Nov. 8 election include
teacher tenure, the political use of
union dues and budget reform poli
cies. Propositions 74, 75 and 76 are
outlined below.
Prop. 74:
Prop. 74 outlines an expansion of
the teacher probation period from
its current two-year span to five
years. The measure would signifi
cantly affect a teacher's ability to se
cure tenure and would mark a dra
matic change of education policy in
California.
Supporters for the bill contend
that California schools have been
consistently below average in the na
tion. They argue that teachers are not
held accountable for the low per
formance scores of their students.
Prop. 74 would change this by allow
ing school districts the ability to re
move teachers after two consecutive
unsatisfactory performance evalua
tions.
Opponents, however, argue that
teachers are not to blame for low stu
dent achievement scores in the state.
Rather, public education has not
been adequately funded, and some
suggest that the current administra
tion has refused the necessary grants
needed to improve the state's schools.
On campus, a number of organiza
tions have been active in the initia
tives and election process. The Stan
ford College Republicans have held
speakers' forums to discuss the ballot
and its various political issues. Senior
Bob Sensenbrenner, former presi
dent of the student group, discussed
his own opinions regarding the meas
ure with The Daily.
"Proposition 74 will streamline
the ability of the districts to get rid of
the bad apples in the school system,"
he said. "Currently the process for
teacher removal can cost up to
$120,000, and the initiative provides
some relief for that."
The Stanford Democrats have
also been active in encouraging stu
dents to vote and have campaigned
extensively regarding the initiatives.
Through "Get Out the Vote'' rallies in
White Plaza and posting fliers in the
dormitories, the Stanford Democrats
said they hope to attract students to
polling booths.
Sophomore Margot Isman, presi
dent of the Stanford Democrats,
noted the possible consequences of
the initiative in terms of employment.
"The last thing California needs is
scaring away qualified young people
interested in teaching in its schools,"
she said. "Proposition 74 blames the
schools' performances on teachers
and ignores the fact that schools are
under-funded."
Currently, Prop. 74 is the most con
troversial on the ballot.The Field Re
search Corporation reported that 44
percent support the initiative, while
50 percent oppose it.The Los Angeles
Times indicated an even closer vote,
with 45 percent in favor of the meas
ure and 47 percent against.
Prop. 75:
Prop. 75 introduces restrictions on
California's public unions and re
quires that union members express
written consent for the use of their
dues for political activities.The initia
tive aims to regulate the lobbying ef
forts of public unions and mandates
that detailed records be maintained
for union expenditures.
The measure has received support
from the Republican Party and has
been backed by the business commu
nity. These groups argue that individ
ual union members often endorse
certain political agendas without
fully understanding the issues. By re
quiring consent, union members will
have more control over political
spending.
Sensenbrenner addressed the cur
rent failings of regulations for union
contributions.
"It is important to compare the
political contributions of the unions
with the political preference of rank
and-file members," Sensenbrenner
said. "Proposition 75 addresses that
disparity in support."
Opponents to Prop. 75, however,
argue that the initiative purposefully
targets public unions only. They as
sert that the proposition unfairly hin
ders the ability of teachers, nurses,
firefighters, police and other public
employees to participate in the polit
ical process. These groups, such as the
Alliance fora Better America, often
cite the billions of dollars spent on
lobbying interests by big business
and special interests groups in Cali
fornia state politics.
The Stanford Democrats shared
these concerns,and Isman questioned
the validity of a measure like Prop. 75.

"Currently public union members
have the ability of opting out of polit
ical contributions and as many as 25
percent already do," she said. "It's
ridiculous that the governor thinks
he knows how the unions should
spend the money instead of the union
members themselves."
Both the Field Poll and the Los
Angeles Times reported that 40 per
cent of those surveyed would support
Prop. 75. However, 50 percent op
posed the initiative in the Field Poll
and 51 percent were against the
measure in the Los Angeles Times.
Statistical research also indicates
that support for the initiative has
steadily fallen in the last eight weeks,
as unions have increased their adver
tisement spending in opposition.
Prop. 76:
Prop. 76 has been titled the "Cali
fornia Live Within Our Means Act."
The measure limits the annual
growth of the budget by the average
growth in revenue during the past
three years. The proposed initiative
aims to control state spending and re
duce the deficit.
The bill has been heavily backed
by the governor and the Republican
Party. Advocates for Prop. 76 argues
that California's economic growth
has been hampered by the
unchecked spending of the state leg
islature. These groups maintained the
need fora balanced budget and
called for broad-based cuts in spend
ing.
Prop. 76 has been actively op
posed by teachers' unions, who as
serted that the governor has pushed
for the initiative to avoid funding
public education as Prop. 98 mandat
ed. These groups even cited that the
measure was initially drafted by the
attorney general to curtail education
spending.
"The governor has broken his
promise on Prop. 98 for two years in a
row now," Isman noted. "Education
spending must be the first priority."
Other opponents questioned the
unilateral control the governor
would hold over budget cuts if the
initiative passed. Katie Quan,chair of
the Center for Labor Research and
Education at UC-Berkeley, high
lighted these concerns.
"Three times each year, outside of
the regular budget cycle, the gover
nor can willfully declare a budget
emergency," she said. "The budget
process must involve the legislature
and lawmakers. Schwarzenneger is
bypassing the entire political
process."
Some supporters for the measure
argue that it is not about cuts in edu
cation; rather, the budget must be
balanced and state spending must be
limited.
"From 1998 to 2004, spending

grew by 44 percent," Sensenhrenner
noted. "The legislature has had con
trol over the budget and has not been
able to properly manage it."
Current polls indicate that oppo
sition to Prop.76 is quite strong in
California. The Field Foil showed
only 32 percent in support of the
measure, with 60 percent opposed.
The Los Angeles Times revealed sim
ilar numbers with 31 percent and 60
percent respectively.
Although there is disagreement
over the election issues, activists from
both political parties continue to en

courage Californians to participate in
the process.
"If you look at the polling a month
ago. most of the propositions were
going to get blown out of the water,"
Sensenbrenner said. "Now it's quite
close. Election results are not decid
ed till election day."
Both the College Republicans
and the Stanford Democrats will con
tinue to encourage students to vote.
Polling booths will be open until 8
p.m. in the Faisan Lounge in Florence
Moore Hall and the Graduate Stu
dent Community Center.
