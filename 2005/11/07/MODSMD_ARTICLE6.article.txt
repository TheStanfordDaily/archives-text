Organized by students from the

their legal skills in the struggle for
social justice and to provide a
forum for the discussion of cre
ative strategies used by legal ad
vocates and activists to further
progressive goals," according to
the mission statement on the con
ference's Web site.

cational aspects.
"Law students know they want to
go out and fight the good fight but
don't know where," Copeland said.
"The conference can help them identi
fy an area for invoking change."
"The conference was started
seven years ago and is focused on pro
gressive lawyering.
The conference is geared toward
law students, but people from
around the nation attended — in
cluding faculty, practitioners,
lawyers, community activists and
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents from all disciplines.
One of the panel topics this year
was entitled "Against the Law: Direct
Action, Civil Disobedience, and Social
Change." It featured four panelists, in
cluding animal rights activist Kevin
Jonas, who is facing trial with a poten
tial sentence of more than 20 years in
jail for the operation of a Web site on
the direct action campaign to close
Huntington Life Sciences, a company
at the center of controversy for its test
ing practices involving animals.

"I think it's going to educate a new
generation of attorneys on issues of
direct action and social change and
protest culture and it could not have
come at a better time considering
today's very conservative climate,"
Jonas said when asked about the pos
sible impacts of the conference.
"You're not going to find this sort of
discourse or dialogue on the news or
being presented in the classroom so
it's important to supplement the reg
ular Stanford Law education with
this outside education."
Ray Ybarra, an Ira Glasser
Racial Justice Fellow focusing on
the border situation involving Mexi
can immigrants and the Minuteman
Civil Defense Corporation, a citizen
group aimed at preventing illegal
immigrants from entering the U.S.,
was another panelist on the direct
action panel. He has spent the last
two years following minutemen with
video cameras and trying to "stop
the unbelievable amount of suffer
ing migrants endure to cross the bor
der and rid the minutemen of their
fear and hatred."
Ybarra said he found the confer
ence a "great chance to engage with
others," especially after "working 17
to 18 hours a day, which leaves no
chance to theorize."

Copeland said the conference was
bigger this year than it has been in the
past but that "the mission statement
has definitely not changed — it has
always been a progressive confer
ence."
First-year law student Dorotha
Ocker said she loved the confer
ence.
"It reinforced why we're in law
school and that there are other peo
ple who think like us," she said while
leaving the panel about agricultural
and environmental concerns.
The entire conference is organ
ized by students and is headed by
the steering committee. In the spring
students are invited to submit appli
cations to put together a panel,
while the steering committee made
the final topic selections. When
choosing people to put on the panel,
the committee strived for diversity
of background and specialty.
According to Marc Tarfolla
Young, the other conference co
chair, they tried to choose "people
with the same goals but who dis
agree on how to get them."
Overall, according to the Web
site, the conference "provides a
forum to discuss innovative strate
gies to address our most pressing so
cial justice issues."
