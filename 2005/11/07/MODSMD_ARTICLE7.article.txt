# ON CAMPUS
## Poll shows few conservatives 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Despite the cardinal-bedecked fans filing out of the
football stadium on Saturdays, Stanford is about as blue as
it can get. About 7.8 percent of Stanford students identify as
conservative, while an overwhelming 58 percent call them
selves liberals, judging by the 7,690 students and recent
alumni who posted their political allegiances on
Facebook.com.
Stanford is far from the prodigal "Magic Town" — a poll
ster's ideal microcosm of national opinions. Instead, the cam
pus diverges rather drastically from national poll results — 41
percent of U.S. citizens nationwide claim to have an affiliation
with the Republican Party.closely following the 47 percent that
report affiliation to Democrats, according to a nationwide Oct.
12 poll conducted by George Washington
University.
"College students tend to be more
liberal than the older population," said
sophomore Chris Nguyen, a member
of the College Republicans. "The Bay
Area is more liberal than most of the
rest of the country. A Bay Area college
naturally has a liberal population."
As "natural" as Nguyen says Stan
ford's political demographics are, they
are anything but natural when consid
ering the national norms. The effect of
this skewed demographic, according to
the highly outnumbered College Re
publicans, is an equally biased tone to
political debate on campus.
"For example, in the last week. Har
vard Law Prof. Lani Guinier "made the
case for' affirmative action as part of the
Presidential Lecture Series and the
ASSU sponsored Ambassador Joseph
Wilson's anti-Bush administration
speech," said senior Duncan Stevens,

president of the College Republicans.
"Both speakers have a right to be heard,
but the University and the ASSU need
to do more to present both sides of the
argument. We must consider conflicting
perspectives to grow as thinkers."
However, it is not just in formal aca
demic debate that Republicans notice
the partiality against them. According
to conservatives, a subset of students
break the cardinal rule of not starting a
relationship by talking about politics or
religion, pulling politics into their per
sonal lives.
"There are the rational liberals who
agree to disagree with you. and then
there are irrational liberals who be
lieve Republicans are the enemy out to
destroy the world instead of just people
with different ideas," Nguyen said.
"Many of the irrational liberals refuse
to even be friends with people who are
even just slightly right of center."
Other Stanford Republicans said
they heard similar stories.
"I do get the 'go home' comments
when we are tabling in White Plaza,"
said junior Megan Reiss, communica
tions director for the College Repub
licans. "But I now view that as part of

the fun."
She added that she has learned to
keep her views to herself when her
peers go on political rants and aren't in
search of genuine debate.
In addition to creating an atmos
phere critical of those right-leaning stu
dents. the political breakdown of the
Stanford campus also seems to induce
more likeminded liberals. For this rea
son, the College Republicans have
taken much of their campaigning —
for the California special election in
particular — off campus and into the
local community.
"We feel we can have more of an
impact getting out the vote of our base
in the local community because so
many students on campus are liberal."
Reiss said. "We would be wasting ener
gy actively campaigning to them."
However, rather than letting their
views break down in face of the over
whelming campus opposition, many
conservatives feel that the need to de
fend their beliefs only further rein
forces them.
"Ultimately, my political views are
more defined because they are con
stantly being challenged," Reiss said.
