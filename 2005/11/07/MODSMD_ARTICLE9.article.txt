zation negotiations in Hong Kong. The talks
are aimed at cutting tariffs worldwide.
In the hope that success in the global talks
would invigorate the FTAA's chances. Bush
said he agrees with Brazilian President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva that the United States
must drop agriculture subsidies so it is easier
for farmers in the developing world to com
pete. Bush said the United States promises to
reduce and then eliminate those "trade-dis
torting subsidies" — as long as Europe does
the same.
"Only an ambitious reform agenda in agri
culture, and manufactured goods, and services
can ensure that the benefits of free and fair
trade are enjoyed by all people in all coun
tries," Bush said.
Bush's five-day trip, which concludes with a
visit to Panama Sunday and Monday, comes as
there is growing mistrust in Latin America
about the United States.
The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq revived mem
ories of the "gunboat diplomacy" era of U.S.-
Latin American relations of a century ago.
There also has been deep concern about the
failure to find the weapons of mass destruction
that Bush alleged Iraq had. Disclosures of pris
oner abuse by U.S. soldiers in Iraq and else
where added strains.
"I fully understand there's, at times, a view
of America that is, in my opinion, not an accu
rate view," Bush said earlier in the day at a
round-table with young Brazilian leaders.
Bush had good reason to make his push for
freer trade, a better image for the United
States and democracy here. Brazil has influ
ence with Venezuela and in Bolivia where the
leading candidate in the Dec. 4 presidential
election is the founder of the Movement To
ward Socialism political party. Evo Morales
has pledged to decriminalize the coca crop and
end the U.S.-backed drive to end its cultiva
tion. Chile also holds its presidential elections
in December and Brazil has balloting in 2(X)6.
" Only a generation ago, this was a continent
plagued by military dictatorship and civil war,"
Bush said. "The successful democracies of the

BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — In a clear jab at
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, President
Bush called on Latin Americans on Sunday to
boldly defend strong democratic institutions
and reject any drift back to the days of author
itarian rule.
Bush's remarks came after Chavez, the left
ist leader and friend of Cuba's Fidel Castro,
spent the past two days hurling criticism at the
United States at the Summit of the Americas in
Argentina.
Eyeing three upcoming presidential elec
tions in Latin America, Bush said citizens must
choose "between two competing visions" for
their future.
One, he said, pursues representative gov
ernment, integration into the world communi
ty and freedom's transformative power for in
dividuals.
"The other seeks to roll back the democrat
ic progress of the past two decades by playing
to fear, pitting neighbor against neighbor and
blaming others for their own failures to pro
vide for the people," he said. "We must make
tough decisions today to ensure a better to
morrow. "
Bush also urged Brazil, the continent's
largest economy, to use its considerable re
gional influence to prod into reality a U.S.-
backed Free Trade Area of the Americas. Bush
believes such a free-trade zone stretching from
Alaska to Argentina would create jobs and lift
the region's 220 million poor to better lives.
That could be a tall order for Brazil.
At the Americas summit, the United States
and 28 other countries supported setting a date
to restart negotiations on creating the trading
bloc. But because Brazil and four other nations
preferred to wait for world trade negotiations
to take place in December, no agreement was
reached on new talks.
So Sunday, Bush appeared determined to
move on from the divisions over the FTAA
talks and focus on those World Trade Organi

21st century will not be defined by blood and
soil. Successful democracies will be defined by
a broader ideal of citizenship — based on
shared principles, and shared responsibilities,
and respect for all."
The president's visit was also expected to
cement relations with Silva, the leader of a
country that represents a lucrative market for

U.S. products that Bush would like to expand.
"We carry on tranquil and mature discus
sions on specific issues that always come up as
part of any partnership on this scale," Silva said
after they met and before they dined on a what
Bush called an "unbelievably good" Brazilian
barbecue of beef, lamb and ox tail, and some
cheese.

Residents of Paris'suburbs at
mercy of criminal gangs,
thugs for 11th night

PARIS (AP) — President Jacques Chirac promised Sunday to restore
public order across France as unrest spread from suburban Paris to cities
south and north, with rioters injuring 10 police officers, throwing Molo
tov cocktails and ramming a car into a housing project during an 11th
night of mayhem.
Ten riot police were injured by birdshot in a clash in the southern Paris
suburb of Grigny, national police spokesman Patrick Hamon said. It was
unclear whether the officers were shot with hunting rifles or a less lethal
weapon, he said. Two officers were hospitalized; their lives were not in
danger.
Overnight Sunday-Monday, at least 764 vehicles were burned, and po
lice made 173 arrests, Hamon's office said. Across the country, rioters
pelted Molotov cocktails at cars and a school, and firefighters in some
areas worked under police escort. New unrest was reported in Toulouse

in the southwest and Rennes in the northwest.
Chirac spoke after a security meeting of his top ministers.
"The law must have the last word," Chirac said in his first public ad
dress on the violence. France is determined "to be stronger than those
who want to sow violence or fear, and they will be arrested, judged and
punished."
Chirac said France was determined to promote "respect for all,justice
and equal opportunities." Violence has been concentrated in poor sub
urbs with large immigrant populations.
The French president had faced criticism from opposition politicians
for not publicly speaking about France's worst civil unrest in more than a
decade. His only previous comments came through a spokesman.
The violence has escalated from an outburst of anger in suburban
Paris housing projects into a nationwide show of disdain for French au
thority from youths and minorities, most French-born children of Arab
and black Africans angered by years of unequal opportunities.
Youths set ablaze nearly 1.300 vehicles and torched businesses, schools
and symbols of French authority, including post offices.

Tornado rips through
southern Indiana and western
Kentucky, killing at least 22

EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) — A tornado with winds ex
ceeding 158 mph ripped a path of destruction through west
ern Kentucky and Indiana as residents slept early Sunday,
reducing homes to splinters and leaving entire blocks of
buildings in rubble. At least 22 people were killed and 2(X)
others injured.
Rescuers who reached the hard-hit Eastbrook Mobile
Home Park shortly after 2 a.m. found children wandering in
the broken glass and debris, looking for their parents, as par
ents called out for missing children.
One child was pulled alive from the debris more than 12
hours after the storm hit. But searchers said they were un
covering more bodies than survivors _ at least 17 victims in
the mobile home park alone.
"They were in trailer homes, homes that were just torn
apart by the storm." Deputy Vanderburgh County Coroner
Annie Groves said. "It's just terrible."
All around, broken tree limbs, chunks of insulation, fur
niture and children's toys littered the ground as rescuers lis
tened for survivors and used forklifts to move crushed mo
bile homes and cars.
The tornado, the deadliest to hit Indiana since 1974,
struck a horse racing track near Henderson, Ky., then
crossed into Indiana.
"It was just a real loud roar. It didn't seem like it lasted
over 45 seconds to a minute, then it was calm again," said
Steve Gaiser. who lives near the Eastbrook Mobile Home
Park in Evansville.

Attack on cruise ship underlines
increasing boldness of Somali pirates

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) —The violent attack on a cruise liner off So
malia's coast shows pirates from the anarchic country on the Horn of
Africa are becoming holder and more ambitious in their efforts to hijack
ships for ransom and loot, a maritime official warned Sunday.
Judging by the location of Saturday's attack, the pirates likely were
from the same group that hijacked a U.N.-chartered aid ship in June and
held its crew and food cargo hostage for 100 days, said Andrew Mwangu
ra, head of the Kenyan chapter of the Seafarers Assistance Program.
That gang is one of three well-organized pirate groups on the 1,880-
mile coast of Somalia, which has had no effective government since oppo
sition leaders ousted a dictatorship in 1991 and then turned on each other,
leaving the nation of 7 million a patchwork of warlord fiefdoms.
Illustrating the chaos, attackers in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, threw
grenades and exploded a land mine Sunday near a convoy carrying the
prime minister of a transitional government that has been trying to exert
control since late last year.
The attack, which killed at least five bodyguards, was the second in six
months involving explosions near Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi,
whose internally divided government spends much of its time in Kenya.
Even before the attack on the liner Seabourn Spirit, Gedi had urged
neighboring countries to send warships to patrol Somalia's coast, which is
Africa's longest and lies along key shipping lanes linking the Mediter
ranean with the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.
U.S. and NATO warships patrol the region to protect vessels in deep
er waters farther out, but they are not permitted in Somali territorial wa
ters. Despite those patrols, the heavily armed pirates approached the
cruise ship about 100 miles at sea, underlining their increasing audacity.

Death row inmate who walked out of
prison captured in Louisiana

HOUSTON (AP) — A death row inmate who slipped out of aTexas
jail last week wearing street clothes was captured Sunday as he talked
on a pay phone in Shreveport, La., about 200 miles away, authorities
said.
Charles Victor Thompson had a bicycle with him when Shreveport po
lice, acting on a tip. approached him around 8 p.m. Sunday, Harris Coun
ty Sheriff's Lt. John Martin said.
"He was standing in front of a liquor store and appeared to be intoxi
cated," Martin said.
When the officers asked his name, he said "You know who I am," then
he identified himself as Charles Thompson. Martin said.
Martin wouldn't discuss the tip that lead to Thompson's arrest and said
authorities were still trying to determine exactly how Thompson got from
Houston to Louisiana and if he had help in his escape. A $10,(XK) reward
had been offered for information leading to his capture.
Thompson, 35, is scheduled to be in court Monday in Shreveport, and
if he waives extradition, he will be returned to Texas immediately, Martin
said.
Thompson was convicted in 1999 for the shooting deaths a year earli
er of his ex-girlfriend. Dennise Hayslip and her new boyfriend, Darren
Keith Cain. An appeals court threw out his sentence, but on Oct. 28, an
other jury sentenced him to death.
Using a falsified ID badge, he got past at least four jail employees and
walked out of the building. Martin had said Friday that Thompson's es
cape resulted from "multiple errors" by jail personnel.
The escape frightened his victim's relatives, who were notified by au
thorities and given police protection.
