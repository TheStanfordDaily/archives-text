## The
						changing face of file-sharing 
### 
The internet just isn't what it used to be.
Six years ago, Shawn Fanning set off a
counter-culture revolution with the release
of Napster, the first widely-used filesharing net

work. From that point on, any geek worth half his
weight in hard disk space possessed the ability to
grab virtually any song off the Web for free. And
they did. Young and old went frolicking through cy
berspace in a frenzied downloading free-for-all.
Napster is now a pay-per-download service and
if you've bought an iPod recently, you know that
times have changed. Adhering to the front of any
nascent pod is a not-so subtle sticker reading "Don't
Steal Music." If that didn't catch your attention, per
haps Provost John Etchemendy's "Copyright Re
minder" sent this week to every student and faculty
member may have given you a hint that the good old
days of freeloading music are over.
The recording and movie industries — not to
mention the Department of Justice and college cam
puses — are all taking copyright infringement very
seriously. In this case, being ignorant could land you
in court. So here is what you need to know:
What is filesharing?
In case you've been niding in a cave since the turn
of the century, filesharing describes a whole class of
software clients and protocols that enables users to
share music, movies and other material on the web.
Napster was the first, followed in quick succession
by Lime Wire, Gnutella, WinMX, Kazaa, Grokster,
Bit Torrent and now OurTUnes. The popularity of
each client ebbs and flows, but the gist of each is the
same. Users log on, share their goods and download
music and sometimes movies from others.
How does it work?
Different systems employ different methods.
Napster started with a central server model. Users
would log in to Napster's computers and share from
there. As time passed, new systems become more de
centralized. Clients such as Limewire have no cen
tral computers and are considered to be true peer
to-peer (P2P) clients. One of the newer clients Our-
Tlines is not only decentralized, but it is also restrict
ed to local networks only. It uses Apple's Digital
Audio Access Protocol (DAAP) to disguise the
transfer of music files as legitimate traffic on a local
Apple iTUnes network.
Is filesharing illegal?
Yes. Distributing any copyrighted material is ille
gal, regardless of the means used.
Why would anyone want to share music?
Beats me.
Are you sure filesharing is illegal?
There are always exceptions. Section 107 of the
1976 U.S. Copyright Act explicitly spells out some
cases where you can copy copyrighted material.
Under the doctrine of "Fair Use," you are allowed to
use copyrighted material for certain educational pur
poses or in parodies or reviews. For example, no one
will care if you snag a picture off the Web to include
in your research paper. And, as long as it's significant
ly creative, you can make a parody of a tune you hear
on the radio. You are also allowed to make back-ups
of copyrighted material that you own.
The doctrine of fair use is nice, but it only goes so
far. If the Moving Picture Association of America
catches you downloading a pirated copy of "Troy" so
you and your girlfriends can ogle over Pitt's hot
body, don't expect to convince anyone that it was
part of an educational or scholarly pursuit.
How does this copyright thing work?
Copyrights require no formal registration. Any
time an author writes anything or arranges any col
lection of words, images or notes, he or she is auto
matically granted a copyright which permits him or
her the sole right to copy that material. Even after
the author dies, his or her copyrights remain valid for
at least 70 years. It is a safe bet that any music on the
radio is copyrighted.
Who thought up this whole copyright
shtick, anyway?
Some guys back in 1787 thought it would be a good
idea. Article 1 section 8 of the United States Constitu
tion reads, "The Congress shall have the power to
promote the Progress for Science and useful Arts, by
securing fora limited Times [sic] to Authors and In
ventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writ
ings and Discoveries."
The founding fathers intended to create an envi
ronment wherein artists and scientists could flourish
without worry of their work being immediately
stolen. All copyright law stems from this constitu
tional mandate.
If I share music online, can I actually get
caught? Because that sucks.
Yes. And many have already been caught.
Starting in July 2003. the Recording Industry Asso
ciation of America (RIAA) unleashed a barrage of
law suits against individuals who shared music online.
The RIAA has been known to sue students, children
and even a 13-year-old whose mother was on welfare.
And more recently, the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA) has also joined the fray.
