# WARY OF Wikipedia
## Online encyclopedia easy to update but prone to errors 
### MARK KOGAN 
It's Sunday morning and you're still recovering from
the weekend. You have a paper due in the next few days
but you don't have the willpower to get started. It's a
short paper, but it's research-heavy and you just aren't
in the mood to make the hike to Green to get the pre
liminary investigating done.
What's a chronic procrastinator to do?
Eventually, you decide to tear yourself away from
Facebook to Google your topic.The first result is a link
to a Web site called Wikipedia. Intrigued.you follow the
lead to discover an encyclopedia-quality entry contain
ing all the basic points of your topic with links and tex
tual references for further study.
Ah, the wonders of the Internet.
Wiki technology was first introduced to the Web in
1995 by Ward Cunningham, an electrical engineer and
computer scientist. The Web-based code provides an
open-source database that can constantly be edited,
changed and updated by anyone that visits the site.
Started in 2001 by Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia
(http://wikipedia.org) is an amalgamation of the words
"Wiki" and "encyclopedia." Since its launch, it has ex
ploded in popularity, now containing more than 715,000
articles and 224 million words published in dozens of
languages.
Wikipedia is nearly eight and a half times bigger
than the Encyclopedia Britannica and more than 13
times bigger than Encarta.
The effectiveness and popularity of Wikipedia have
stemmed from the ability of any user to make submis
sions. corrections and additions — all of which become
visible and searchable instantaneously. On its Web site,
Wikipedia states that "Wikipedia's goal is to create a
free, democratic, reliable encyclopedia — actually, the
largest encyclopedia in history, in terms of both breadth
and depth."
Freshman Stephan Goupille says that Wikipedia is the
first place he goes to get basic background information on
a topic.

"It's just
bigger and

easier to ac
cess than any

other encyclo
pedia," he says.

But many re
main skeptical of

Wikipedia's credibility.
Although the online encyclo-

pedia is relatively well self-policed.

there are occasional inaccuracies which cause

some critics to see it as a potential fountain of erro
neous data.
"It's just too open-ended to be relied on as a strong ac
ademic source." says freshman Maria Duzon. "You can
use it to get some basic information on a topic, but you
shouldn't cite it in a paper."
Faculty members have been very wary of the
Wikipedia revolution. In the past, many teachers have
been vehemently opposed to the use of the source in
formal papers.
However, while this still seems to be the majority
opinion, the concept of the Wiki is becoming more
widespread.
"I don't think it helps students to divide the world
into approved sources and forbidden sources," says
Jonathan Hunt, who teaches a course in the Program
in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR). "Obviously, an article
on Wikipedia is not the same kind of source as The
Wall Street Journal or a research article in a peer-re
viewed journal, but all sources should be regarded
with some suspicion."
"Critical thinking, we sometimes call this," Hunt
adds.

And the Wiki concept is not just limited to
Wikipedia. Some Stanford professors use Wiki technol
ogy to create forums for group discussions about course
materials or teaching issues.
Such use of Wiki is also making a definitive impact
on the academic world.
"This is a new kind of tool, and 1 think that the
scholarly consensus in writing studies and communi
cation studies hasn't yet solidified," Hunt says."For
that reason alone, it is reasonable to approach Wikis
with caution. However, this is true with any source —
even a professor's lecture. Even a 'reliable' source
should be approached with critical awareness rather
than blind acceptance."
So while Wikipedia is far from becoming an official
benchmark for research, it is definitely making strides
in reaching its goal of becoming the world's "biggest,
most diverse and most reliable" source of information.
"It's a great idea that has created a great resource," says
junior Rishi Mandal. "While it may not yet have the
credibility of the older information banks, it's definite
ly going in the right direction."

there are occasional inaccuracies which cause

some critics to see it as a potential fountain of erro
neous data.
"It's just too open-ended to be relied on as a strong ac
ademic source." says freshman Maria Duzon. "You can
use it to get some basic information on a topic, but you
shouldn't cite it in a paper."
Faculty members have been very wary of the
Wikipedia revolution. In the past, many teachers have
been vehemently opposed to the use of the source in
formal papers.
However, while this still seems to be the majority
opinion, the concept of the Wiki is becoming more
widespread.
"I don't think it helps students to divide the world
into approved sources and forbidden sources," says
Jonathan Hunt, who teaches a course in the Program
in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR). "Obviously, an article
on Wikipedia is not the same kind of source as The
Wall Street Journal or a research article in a peer-re
viewed journal, but all sources should be regarded
with some suspicion."
"Critical thinking, we sometimes call this," Hunt
adds.

And the Wiki concept is not just limited to
Wikipedia. Some Stanford professors use Wiki technol
ogy to create forums for group discussions about course
materials or teaching issues.
Such use of Wiki is also making a definitive impact
on the academic world.
"This is a new kind of tool, and 1 think that the
scholarly consensus in writing studies and communi
cation studies hasn't yet solidified," Hunt says."For
that reason alone, it is reasonable to approach Wikis
with caution. However, this is true with any source —
even a professor's lecture. Even a 'reliable' source
should be approached with critical awareness rather
than blind acceptance."
So while Wikipedia is far from becoming an official
benchmark for research, it is definitely making strides
in reaching its goal of becoming the world's "biggest,
most diverse and most reliable" source of information.
"It's a great idea that has created a great resource," says
junior Rishi Mandal. "While it may not yet have the
credibility of the older information banks, it's definite
ly going in the right direction."

It's Sunday morning and you're still recovering from
the weekend. You have a paper due in the next few days
but you don't have the willpower to get started. It's a
short paper, but it's research-heavy and you just aren't
in the mood to make the hike to Green to get the pre
liminary investigating done.
What's a chronic procrastinator to do?
Eventually, you decide to tear yourself away from
Facebook to Google your topic.The first result is a link
to a Web site called Wikipedia. Intrigued.you follow the
lead to discover an encyclopedia-quality entry contain
ing all the basic points of your topic with links and tex
tual references for further study.
Ah, the wonders of the Internet.
Wiki technology was first introduced to the Web in
1995 by Ward Cunningham, an electrical engineer and
computer scientist. The Web-based code provides an
open-source database that can constantly be edited,
changed and updated by anyone that visits the site.
Started in 2001 by Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia
(http://wikipedia.org) is an amalgamation of the words
"Wiki" and "encyclopedia." Since its launch, it has ex
ploded in popularity, now containing more than 715,000
articles and 224 million words published in dozens of
languages.
Wikipedia is nearly eight and a half times bigger
than the Encyclopedia Britannica and more than 13
times bigger than Encarta.
The effectiveness and popularity of Wikipedia have
stemmed from the ability of any user to make submis
sions. corrections and additions — all of which become
visible and searchable instantaneously. On its Web site,
Wikipedia states that "Wikipedia's goal is to create a
free, democratic, reliable encyclopedia — actually, the
largest encyclopedia in history, in terms of both breadth
and depth."
Freshman Stephan Goupille says that Wikipedia is the
first place he goes to get basic background information on
a topic.

"It's just
bigger and

easier to ac
cess than any

other encyclo
pedia," he says.

But many re
main skeptical of

Wikipedia's credibility.
Although the online encyclo-

pedia is relatively well self-policed.

there are occasional inaccuracies which cause

some critics to see it as a potential fountain of erro
neous data.
