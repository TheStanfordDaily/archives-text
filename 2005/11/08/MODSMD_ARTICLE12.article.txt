# Blogging brings political voices, gossip to a forefront
## 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Since the late 19905, online journaling —
also called "blogging" or "weblogging" —
has redefined the way people keep journals
and record ideas.
As time passes, blogging has proven it
self as a unique and innovative mode of
communication. With its format of posts or
ganized from most to least recent, blogs
offer readers the ability to comment on and
even discuss a variety of subjects, from the
everyday frustrations to breaking news
scandals.
But blogging has been denounced by
some as merely another way to spread gos
sip and melodrama among teens.
"I think online journals defeat the pur
pose of physically speaking to someone in a
society where discussion is already a dying
art," says freshman Zach Nevin.
Technorati, a Web site that tracks thou
sands of blogs and links, begs to differ.
"Blogs are a fluid, dynamic medium,
more akin to a 'conversation' than to a li
brary — which is how the Web has often
been described in the past," according to
Technorati's Web site. http://www.techno

rati.com.
For many, blogging is more than a simple
online diary. Rather, it represents a revolu
tionary method of information-sharing.
"A new wehlog is created every 7.4 sec
onds "according to Technorati's site. "Blog
gers — people who write weblogs — up
date their weblogs regularly. There are
about 275,(HX) posts daily."
People blog fora plethora of reasons.
"Over the summer my sister was in India
while I was in New Haven. Conn ," says
freshman Emily Grewal."lt was too expen
sive to call everyday, but we are really close
and wanted to stay in touch, so we started a
blog. It is a great way to give updates on the
important events in your life."
And freshman TVacy Chou says she
blogs to procrastinate, to practice Chinese
on her Chinese Xanga and to improve her
writing skills.
Some also say they believe a blog can
become an educational forum.
"While blogging is not well-respected
now. I think it has the potential to grow into
a robust avenue for [academic] information
exchange," says freshman Adam Cole.
Junior Tony Wang concurs.
"The stereotype is that blogging is only

for personal use," Wang says. "But most of
my blogging is about aggregating informa
tion so that it's easily accessible for people
who are interested."
Wang emphasizes key differences be
tween blogging and regular Web sites.
"When presenting information, a lot of
people build a Web site — [something that]
is made once and rarely updated." Wang
says. "When you create a blog. you're think
ing about the future. You're continuously
updating in a straight-forward,easy-to-nav
igate interface."
Wang wrote a research paper on blog
ging for his Program in Writing and
Rhetoric 2 (PWR) class last year. Of course,
he chose to create a blog — http://stanford
blogproject.blogspot.com — to present his
information. His blog elucidates the poten
tial of blogging in many areas, such as in
classroom seminars and research projects,
student government and student publish
ing groups.
For example, Wang notes that blogging
encourages student participation by mak
ing it easy to respond and by showing stu
dents that their ideas are being recognized
and heard. He adds that logs welcome new
ideas and feedback because they are online

and removed from sometimes intimidating
personal settings.
Blogging has already proven its mettle
in the political field. It offers a fast, easily
accessible news source where writers are
immediately held accountable for their
ideas by avid readers.
This stands in contrast to mainstream
media, where everything seems tainted by
partisan bias and reader response plays a
less prominent role.
Wang says he endorses blog use in the
political field.
"1 would be really excited if all of our
politicians had blogs of their own," he com
ments. "It's important to effectively com
municate with constituents. Also, blogs are
a great way to counteract the media bias to
wards sensationalism. I think it would en
courage a deeper dialogue in politics than
what we have today."
The future possibilities of blogging seem
endless, despite its vocal critics.
"It's important to for each person to find
his or her own way to express themselves,"
Wang says."For me, it's comforting to know
I can put my thoughts down — with audio,
video,and images — in a format I'll want to
look back on in a few years."

"I think online journals defeat the pur
pose of physically speaking to someone in a
society where discussion is already a dying
art," says freshman Zach Nevin.
Technorati, a Web site that tracks thou
sands of blogs and links, begs to differ.
"Blogs are a fluid, dynamic medium,
more akin to a 'conversation' than to a li
brary — which is how the Web has often
been described in the past," according to
Technorati's Web site. http://www.techno

For many, blogging is more than a simple
online diary. Rather, it represents a revolu
tionary method of information-sharing.
"A new wehlog is created every 7.4 sec
onds "according to Technorati's site. "Blog
gers — people who write weblogs — up
date their weblogs regularly. There are
about 275,(HX) posts daily."
People blog fora plethora of reasons.
"Over the summer my sister was in India
while I was in New Haven. Conn ," says
freshman Emily Grewal."lt was too expen
sive to call everyday, but we are really close
and wanted to stay in touch, so we started a
blog. It is a great way to give updates on the
important events in your life."
And freshman TVacy Chou says she
blogs to procrastinate, to practice Chinese
on her Chinese Xanga and to improve her
writing skills.
Some also say they believe a blog can
become an educational forum.
"While blogging is not well-respected
now. I think it has the potential to grow into
a robust avenue for [academic] information
exchange," says freshman Adam Cole.
Junior Tony Wang concurs.
"The stereotype is that blogging is only

for personal use," Wang says. "But most of
my blogging is about aggregating informa
tion so that it's easily accessible for people
who are interested."
Wang emphasizes key differences be
tween blogging and regular Web sites.
"When presenting information, a lot of
people build a Web site — [something that]
is made once and rarely updated." Wang
says. "When you create a blog. you're think
ing about the future. You're continuously
updating in a straight-forward,easy-to-nav
igate interface."
Wang wrote a research paper on blog
ging for his Program in Writing and
Rhetoric 2 (PWR) class last year. Of course,
he chose to create a blog — http://stanford
blogproject.blogspot.com — to present his
information. His blog elucidates the poten
tial of blogging in many areas, such as in
classroom seminars and research projects,
student government and student publish
ing groups.
For example, Wang notes that blogging
encourages student participation by mak
ing it easy to respond and by showing stu
dents that their ideas are being recognized
and heard. He adds that logs welcome new
ideas and feedback because they are online

and removed from sometimes intimidating
personal settings.
Blogging has already proven its mettle
in the political field. It offers a fast, easily
accessible news source where writers are
immediately held accountable for their
ideas by avid readers.
This stands in contrast to mainstream
media, where everything seems tainted by
partisan bias and reader response plays a
less prominent role.
Wang says he endorses blog use in the
political field.
"1 would be really excited if all of our
politicians had blogs of their own," he com
ments. "It's important to effectively com
municate with constituents. Also, blogs are
a great way to counteract the media bias to
wards sensationalism. I think it would en
courage a deeper dialogue in politics than
what we have today."
The future possibilities of blogging seem
endless, despite its vocal critics.
"It's important to for each person to find
his or her own way to express themselves,"
Wang says."For me, it's comforting to know
I can put my thoughts down — with audio,
video,and images — in a format I'll want to
look back on in a few years."
Since the late 19905, online journaling —
also called "blogging" or "weblogging" —
has redefined the way people keep journals
and record ideas.
As time passes, blogging has proven it
self as a unique and innovative mode of
communication. With its format of posts or
ganized from most to least recent, blogs
offer readers the ability to comment on and
even discuss a variety of subjects, from the
everyday frustrations to breaking news
scandals.
But blogging has been denounced by
some as merely another way to spread gos
sip and melodrama among teens.
