### 
□ &
Notification YES NO

Proposition 73, which would impose a
parental notification requirement on
minor girls seeking abortions, will
have consequences that are not visible on
the surface.
It's particularly important for voters to
make their decision based on a careful consid
eration of what Prop. 73 would actually do.
People who oppose abort it >ns should question
whether the initiative is actually in the interest
of the minors it ostensibly tries to protect.
Although research has shown that most
minors do talk to their parents before seeking
abortions,some do not. Many pregnant minor
girls have abusive or troubled families and
notifying their parents will have serious
repercussions for the girls' safety and well
being. Ihe impact of Prop. 73 on victims of
sexual abuse is a particularly serious concern.
Many minor girls who seek abortions became
pregnant through such abuse, in some cases

by one of the parents they are required to no
tify. For these girls, the requirement seems
counterproductive and possibly dangerous.
If. for whatever reason,girls are unable ei
ther to notify their parents or to get a waiver,
they are likely to seek abortions anyway —
but the abortions they end up getting will be
neither safe nor legal.
Students should also think carefully about
the wording of the proposition. The measure
defines abortion as a procedure that will
"cause the death of the unborn child, a child
conceived but not yet born." It is difficult to
see how this controversial language is neces
sary in an initiative that supposedly deals only
with parental notification.
Prop. 73 could create serious risks to the
health and safety of minor girls in California
and will write heated language into the Califor
nia constitution without thorough public de
bate. We urge students to vote "no" on Prop. 73.

® Teacher □ B
Tenure YES NO

Proposition 74 is intended to improve
the quality of public education by
making it more difficult for teachers to
become and remain permanent employees.
The idea pushed by proponents of this ini
tiative is that it is currently too easy for weak
teachers to earn tenure — and that once
they do, it is too difficult to dismiss them.
While we agree that California's public ed
ucation system needs reform, we do not think
that this proposition is the right solution. It ex
tends from two years to five years the amount
of time necessary to earn tenure, litis is a sig
nificant increase to enact all at once.
More disturbingly, it allows the school
board to dismiss permanent teachers after
only two unsatisfactory annual performance
evaluations — without the 90-day window
of opportunity they currently have in which
to show improvement, and without further
justification for employment-termination
than the evaluations. We believe that per

formance evaluations are not perfect meas
ures of teaching capability and should not be
the only justification for firing teachers.
We are also concerned that the increase in
time necessary to earn tenure could lead to nu
merous lawsuits, because untenured teachers
are not guaranteed a formal hearing prior to
being fired. Under Prop. 74. many more teach
ers would be subject to potential employment
termination without benefit of a hearing.
Furthermore, Prop. 74 provides no extra
incentive for good, hard-working teachers.
Instead, it forces them to go through an un
fairly rigorous process to achieve and main
tain permanent status, without the benefit of
extra compensation at the end of it. We be
lieve that combining this lack of incentive
for good teachers with too much unchecked
power in the hands of employers will only
turn potentially good teachers away from a
field that desperately needs them. We there
fore suggest a "no" vote on Prop. 74.

®SITION 75 r/L Ik
Union Dues IJLI lj
Protection YES NO

Proposition 75 changes an opt-out polit
ical contribution system into an opt-in
one, without affecting dues earmarked
for collective bargaining. We believe that
protecting the rights of workers is more im
portant than the potential harm suffered by
unions as a result, and thus support Prop. 75.
If the initiative passes, unions will have to
ask for each union members' permission be
fore collecting political campaign dues, in
stead of members asking to waive such dues.
'There's good reason to single out public
sector union participation in California pol
itics. When a public-sector union elects a
politician, it is electing its own boss. Accord
ingly, there is a legitimate fear that unions
are negotiating on both sides of the table.
According to a I J.S. Supreme Court rul
ing, union members have a right not to con
tribute to their union's political campaigns.
Yet it is all too easy to see how public-sector
unions can trick their members into givingto
political campaigns. A worker might not be
informed of his right to waive political dues.

Since dues are deducted straight from the
worker's paycheck, he might not even be
aware that he is paying political dues. Often,
if you refuse to pay such dues, you lose your
union vote. Finally, if you're new to a job.
would you really risk angering your union by
refusing to give to its pet political campaign?
We are wary of interfering with the inter
nal workings of unions, but feel that public
sector unions are a separate category. Gov
ernment employees are by default expected
to join public-sector unions. Even if an em
ployee leaves a union, his contract is still ne
gotiated by the union, and he still must pay
most union dues. Giving public-sector unions
a monopoly on representation also gives the
state a right to regulate those unions.
By forcing unions to denote how they use
dues. Prop. 75 adds needed transparency
and accountability into the union system.
Maybe these extra protections are not nec
essary. but wc feel that — in the long term
— transparency can never hurt. We encour
age a "yes" vote on Prop. 75.

©PROPOSITION 76 Ib
Budget LJ
Limits YES NO

California desperately needs to tighten
its fiscal policy, but Proposition 76 is
not the way to do it. If passed. Prop. 76
will curb state spending to some degree, but
will also place limits on education spending
and give the governor too much power over
the budget.
My promoting fiscal austerity. Prop. 76
triggers deep-seated fears among public
sector workers of severe budget cuts and
possible layoffs. But this is not why we op
pose the measure.
By allowing the governor to control
funding levels and possibly declare fiscal
emergencies, Prop. 76 would give both cur
rent and future governors an inordinate

amount of power over the state budget.
Additionally, one of the ways Prop. 76
seeks to reduce spending is by decreasing the
minimum guaranteed amount allocated to
education.This would work against the meas
ures put in place to ensure adequate educa
tion funding that were enacted through Prop.
98 in 1988. Given the fact that California has
among the most dismal K-14 education sys
tem in the nation, the measures put forward in
Prop. 76 seem especially uninspired.
California's inflated budget calls for
stricter fiscal policies; however, we feel that
these policies should not result in greater
centralized control and decreased educa
tion spending. Vote "no" on Prop. 76.

® PROPOSITION 77 Ik
State ijll LJ
Redistricting YES NO

Proposition 77 seeks to address the
problem of California legislators re
drawing the state's legislative dis
tricts by handing the redistricting job to
nonpartisan judges. We think this plan will
make elections more competitive (last No
vember, none of the 153 seats in the assem
bly, state senate and Congress changed par
ties), improve political dialogue and end
some of the current partisan gridlock in the
legislature.
The proposition lays out an elaborate
and well-designed method for avoiding
partisanship. It creates a panel of three re
tired judges to draw all the districts in Cal
ifornia. Judges cannot have held partisan
political offices, have changed their party
affiliation since their judicial appointment
or have received income over the past year
from specified political sources. The Judi
cial Council, an administrative body of the
court system, randomly selects 24 judges

from the pool of all willing, retired and
qualifying judges, and legislative leaders of
the major parties then narrow down the
list. A final random selection process nar
rows the number of judges to three, includ
ing at least one Republican and one De
mocrat.
This panel of judges draws the bound
aries for legislative districts with input
from the legislature, the governor and the
public. In the end, the panel releases a
unanimously agreed-upon redistricting
plan that is used for the next statewide
election. Voters would then get a chance to
vote on the new districts. If they rejected
the plan, the process would begin again for
the next election cycle.
We believe that Prop. 77 will improve
representation and district competitive
ness. and will reduce the influence of legis
lators in choosing their own constituents.
We advise a "yes" vote on Prop. 77.

PROPOSITIONS 78, 79,80 I h VVk
V^lr£ P rescr ipti° ns Al
VJxy & Electricity YES NO

Propositions on prescription drugs and
electricity regulation may not seem
to fit together. But their lack of con
gruence aligns perfectly with the general
problem with the initiative system — that
it puts too many complicated issues before
voters who usually don't have the time to
study them. Ihankfully there is a way to
remedy this problem: Vote no on all three
propositions.
We could rehash the talking points in any
voter guide. Proposition 78 has backing
from the pharmaceutical industry and is
modeled on a program in Ohio that has ei
ther been successful or unsuccessful de
pending on the measure. Prop. 79 is similar
to a Maine program that was abandoned
after it was tied up by lawsuits, but it is much
more generous to consumers and is manda
tory foi drug companies. It is endorsed by
the AARP and the California Public Inter
est Research Group.
While a prescription drug discount plan
is a good idea, the program should not be
decided through an initiative. It is the job of
legislators to understand the intricacies of
these measures and make decisions for the
rest of us. Thus we urge you to vote, but to

vote negative on both measures. If both fail,
we are sure that California lawmakers will
give it another shot.
Prop. 80 is even more complicated than
the prescription drug measures. It would
lead to another regulation of the electricity
industry. But it's not that simple. The Cali
fornia energy industry is already partially
regulated, and changes would only affect
large energy consumers who deal with in
dependent energy companies. These
changes would handicap the public utilities
commission by putting their current regula
tions into law and making them much more
difficult to change. It would move up re
newable energy commitments, but some
environmentalists are concerned that it will
make a future increase in requirements
more difficult. And no one knows how
these regulations will affect prices or future
energy supplies.
If even the experts are baffled by the ac
tual effects of Prop. 80, we should not write
new regulations that can only be changed
with a two-thirds vote of the legislature. Pre
venting blackouts and providing better pre
scription drug coverage are good ideas, but
propositions are not the way to do it.
