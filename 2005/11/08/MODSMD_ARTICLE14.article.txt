# 'This is just an indie rock story'

### 
I have a confession to make — I didn't
start listening to Radiohead until the
album "Amnesiac" came out. I'm
sorry. I'm a phony. It's true! Why, why
God did you let me stay in the darkness
for so long? The first summer I went to
nerd camp, when I met jazz-camp kids
who spoke in reverential tones about
"OK Computer," why did You let me
come away from it with only a love of
Oasis and The Mighty Mighty Bos
stones?
If only my ears had been opened ear
lier; I could have had a soundtrack to my
traumatic junior high career. Instead of
listening to Meatloaf records, with my fa
ther pleading with the narrator to make
it three out of three. I could have had my
own music — music my parents
would'vc haled. It would have given me
my first fight with my parents. Instead. I
had to wait until years later, when I was
kicked out of the same nerd camp for
"disrespect of authority."
It was around that time that I redis
covered Radiohead. when a friend hand

ed me nn unmarked CD-R full of metic
ulously organized mp3s. It contained a
terrible B-Sidc called "Bishop's Robes."
A throwaway droning number that
should have only resonated with a child
of a British boarding school. But it was
the first song I'd found on my own. I sat
in the dark with a pair of headphones
trying to find the words to describe it
and the reason why it meant so much to
me. I was hooked, (his was My Band.
I found other bands — ones that
were spoken of in the same sentence as
Radiohead, ones they covered and
name-checked, old openers. I had found
indie a movement that h;id come to

be centered around other bands that
spoke to (lie outcasts, the nerds and the
theater kids. I saw them live and I under
stood the difference between a concert
and a show. Iliis wasn't seeing the
Rolling Stones, old and boring, with my
father. This was a bunch of angry guys
who had a lot to say.
I wanted to hear it again. So I went
and saw them again in New Jersey nine
days later. When I realized it would be
infeasible (and not that interesting) to
follow them around the country, I dis
covered bootlegs and the obsessiveness
that follows from even the most tenta
tive entry into that community.
Collectors of these artifacts discover
hidden gems in them — unreleased
songs that few people have ever heard
and even fewer have ever appreciated. It
leads to a rabid desire for completeness,
the idea that if you try hard enough, you
can find the songs of your favorite band
that will be new and exciting. After
