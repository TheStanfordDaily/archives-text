# 'This is just an indie rock story'

### 
I have a confession to make — I didn't
start listening to Radiohead until the
album "Amnesiac" came out. I'm
sorry. I'm a phony. It's true! Why, why
God did you let me stay in the darkness
for so long? The first summer I went to
nerd camp, when I met jazz-camp kids
who spoke in reverential tones about
"OK Computer," why did You let me
come away from it with only a love of
Oasis and The Mighty Mighty Bos
stones?
If only my ears had been opened ear
lier; I could have had a soundtrack to my
traumatic junior high career. Instead of
listening to Meatloaf records, with my fa
ther pleading with the narrator to make
it three out of three. I could have had my
own music — music my parents
would'vc haled. It would have given me
my first fight with my parents. Instead. I
had to wait until years later, when I was
kicked out of the same nerd camp for
"disrespect of authority."
It was around that time that I redis
covered Radiohead. when a friend hand

ed me nn unmarked CD-R full of metic
ulously organized mp3s. It contained a
terrible B-Sidc called "Bishop's Robes."
A throwaway droning number that
should have only resonated with a child
of a British boarding school. But it was
the first song I'd found on my own. I sat
in the dark with a pair of headphones
trying to find the words to describe it
and the reason why it meant so much to
me. I was hooked, (his was My Band.
I found other bands — ones that
were spoken of in the same sentence as
Radiohead, ones they covered and
name-checked, old openers. I had found
indie a movement that h;id come to

be centered around other bands that
spoke to (lie outcasts, the nerds and the
theater kids. I saw them live and I under
stood the difference between a concert
and a show. Iliis wasn't seeing the
Rolling Stones, old and boring, with my
father. This was a bunch of angry guys
who had a lot to say.
I wanted to hear it again. So I went
and saw them again in New Jersey nine
days later. When I realized it would be
infeasible (and not that interesting) to
follow them around the country, I dis
covered bootlegs and the obsessiveness
that follows from even the most tenta
tive entry into that community.
Collectors of these artifacts discover
hidden gems in them — unreleased
songs that few people have ever heard
and even fewer have ever appreciated. It
leads to a rabid desire for completeness,
the idea that if you try hard enough, you
can find the songs of your favorite band
that will be new and exciting. After

ings filled with tape hiss and drunk
guys screaming "Freebird", but buried
underneath will be the songs you
haven't explored.
I now worry that in my fetishistic
relationship with music, I've lost
something important. The Internet
has done for music what pornography
did for relationships — it took away
all the intimacy and made everyone
restless. I'm jealous of everyone who
ever had to tape an LP off a friend,
wait for the next Sub Pop single or
send away to SST Records for their
catalog.
Owning an album used to mean
something — you paid for it, and
once you had it, you were stuck with
it. It would be only one of a limited
number you owned and could engage
with.
Thanks to the Internet, I will never
again know the joy of waiting months
for an album, making an expedition
out of the trip to buy it, opening the
thin plastic lining and listening to the
record while poring over the liner
notes that will elucidate or expand
the mysteries of the music. Maybe
I'm just hopelessly romanticizing
owning a copy of "Frampton Comes
Alive" on vinyl.
Much like the tech industry, it is
evolve or die in the music-snob
world. If you're not taking in at least
10 new albums a week (and pretend
ing to take in at least twice that),
you're falling behind. Someone will
find the next Arcade Fire before you
do, and the indie girls will love him
more and you may as well just kill
yourself.
Why exactly am I entangled in
this elitism? I got into music because
it spoke to me and it gave voice to un
expressed feelings. TVying to iterate
my musical taste on a weekly basis
means that I will never be able to
give as much time to a great album as

it deserves. I worry every time I listen
to "Automatic For The People" that
I'm doing a disservice by not explor
ing my complete and untouched
Massive Attack discography. This is
not healthy.
As much as we snobs claim that we
value indie ethos over all else, it's a lie.
If that were true, we wouldn't be
spending time trying to understand
the value of Pere Übu, just so we can
tell other members of our tribe that if
they don't get it, they don't understand
modern music.
If you were really indie, you'd lis
ten to bands that no one had ever
heard of. And then there would be no
point, because if they're really that
obscure, you wouldn't receive any
cred for finding them. The dispensers
of cred, your peers, need to know of
the band to appreciate your appreci
ation of them. Otherwise, you could
just be making this shit up. Oh yeah,
I'm real into The Hot Cells... they're,
ummm... a post-rock hand from Al
bany, sort of like minimalism meets
Mission of Burma. Bullshit.
Having a car with nothing but a
CD player has done wonders for my
relationship with music. I need to
choose which albums to buy and
which to burn, which to keep in the car
and which to rotate. Away from my
computer, I can't just pick 50 random
songs to play nor put my iPod on shuf
fle. It's forcing me to be much more
active in my music appreciation.
Do I burn "Nirvana Unplugged" or
the latest Pitchfork-It-Band that is ab
solutely required listening for any self
respecting snob (Animal Collective
and Wolf Parade being the two latest
disappointments)? No, I think I'd
rather put on the Mountain Goats
record I've had in my car since early
this summer. It's a good record for au
tumn driving.

David Blacknxan made a damn good
Ozzy Osboume before he cut his hair.
Now he looks like the lead singer of a
new wave band. He also turns 21 on Fri
day. Send him birthday wishes at black
