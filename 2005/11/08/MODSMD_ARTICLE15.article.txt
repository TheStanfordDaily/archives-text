# Where have all the nerds gone?
## 
### 
Iknew that there was something missing in my
Stanford career thus far, but I wasn't able to
put my finger on it until a friend of mine re
vealed that she, too, had sensed a void in her col
legiate experience. There we were at the CoHo,
feeling sufficiently intellectual-looking in our
corduroy jackets with Chai tea and books spread
in front of us, when we realized that — despite
our own undeniable nerdiness — there was a no
ticeable lack of nerdy guys in our lives.
Throughout high school, we were told that col
lege guys would be different — that they would
n't be intimidated by smart girls, that they would
be falling all over us. I assumed this was true; it
had always been my experience that the guys I
met at academic gatherings — that is, the nerdy
ones — were the ones with whom I had the best
connections. I assumed that a similar connection
would be easy to find at college.
But no such luck. My friend and I observed
that not only had we not connected with any
nerdy guys, but we had hardly met any nerdy guys
at all.
Let me clarify: In the eyes of many of the girls
whom I know (or, at the very least, according to
my CoHo cohort and me), nerdiness is an endear

ing quality. Math nerds, hand geeks, literature
dorks, drama freaks, we ll take them all. Glasses
are a bonus.
There's just something about a nerdy guy that
makes him irresistible to us nerdy girls (and pre
sumably to non-nerdy girls as well — sort of like
a reversed-role version of the classic 90s teen
movie, "She's All That"). Maybe it's the fact that
we can be ourselves around them, that their ac
ceptance of their own nerdiness convinces us that
they will accept all of our peculiar quirks and ec
centricities, too. Or maybe the reason is that we
are hopeless romantics and dream of a guy with
whom we can wile away the hours in the corner of
