# Where have all the nerds gone?
## 
### 
Iknew that there was something missing in my
Stanford career thus far, but I wasn't able to
put my finger on it until a friend of mine re
vealed that she, too, had sensed a void in her col
legiate experience. There we were at the CoHo,
feeling sufficiently intellectual-looking in our
corduroy jackets with Chai tea and books spread
in front of us, when we realized that — despite
our own undeniable nerdiness — there was a no
ticeable lack of nerdy guys in our lives.
Throughout high school, we were told that col
lege guys would be different — that they would
n't be intimidated by smart girls, that they would
be falling all over us. I assumed this was true; it
had always been my experience that the guys I
met at academic gatherings — that is, the nerdy
ones — were the ones with whom I had the best
connections. I assumed that a similar connection
would be easy to find at college.
But no such luck. My friend and I observed
that not only had we not connected with any
nerdy guys, but we had hardly met any nerdy guys
at all.
Let me clarify: In the eyes of many of the girls
whom I know (or, at the very least, according to
my CoHo cohort and me), nerdiness is an endear

ing quality. Math nerds, hand geeks, literature
dorks, drama freaks, we ll take them all. Glasses
are a bonus.
There's just something about a nerdy guy that
makes him irresistible to us nerdy girls (and pre
sumably to non-nerdy girls as well — sort of like
a reversed-role version of the classic 90s teen
movie, "She's All That"). Maybe it's the fact that
we can be ourselves around them, that their ac
ceptance of their own nerdiness convinces us that
they will accept all of our peculiar quirks and ec
centricities, too. Or maybe the reason is that we
are hopeless romantics and dream of a guy with
whom we can wile away the hours in the corner of

music to the meaning of life. (Person
ally, I would also appreciate someone
who won't make fun of me for using
the phrase "with whom" in everyday
conversation).
So. where are all these guys hiding?
It can't be that they don't exist. One
would imagine that, at a place like
Stanford, nerdy guys would be run
ning rampant around campus; I, for
one, am convinced that they are out
there somewhere. Could it be that

they have just become extra-profi
cient at blending into the crowd?
Could we be passing them everyday
on our way to class or waiting behind
them in the pizza line at lunch?
Long gone are the days of pocket
protectors, suspenders and other
overt displays of nerdiness; exposing
somebody as the nerd that he is now
requires more than a first impression.
Today's nerds make us work before
letting us see their charming idiosyn
crasies and social ineptitudes. But
when they finally do, we melt.
To hasten said melting, however,
nerds need to go out and actively pur
sue other nerds. The problem is that
the average nerd is not likely to be in

attendance at a frat party or whatever
strikingly similar social activity is tak
ing place on a Friday night. More like
ly they are the ones staying in, watch
ing a movie or just talking in some
one's room, which — while conducive
to strengthening bonds between
friends — doesn't help when you're
looking to meet new people.
My proposed solution is a compro
mise. It's plain that in order to get to
know other people (nerdy or other
wise), leaving the dorm is an impor
tant step — but that step doesn't have
to be toward a frat house. And it may
be true that you can meet people in
class, but it's hard to feel attractive
when you've just rolled out of bed at

8:30 fora 9 a.m. lecture (because, let's
face it. nerds have eyes, too). Ideally,
there would be a place where we
could all go to coalesce — a place
with cafe lattes, alternative music and
all those other things we nerds love.
(And it would be a plus if it were open
on Friday and Saturday nights).
Until we find that place, however,
my CoHo buddy and I have decided
to be proactive. If you need us, we'll be
in Green scoping out the prospects

hang out with them)? E-mail

there would be a place where we
could all go to coalesce — a place
with cafe lattes, alternative music and
all those other things we nerds love.
(And it would be a plus if it were open
on Friday and Saturday nights).
Until we find that place, however,
my CoHo buddy and I have decided
to be proactive. If you need us, we'll be
in Green scoping out the prospects

hang out with them)? E-mail
Stephanie at salessi@stanford.edu and

Iknew that there was something missing in my
Stanford career thus far, but I wasn't able to
put my finger on it until a friend of mine re
vealed that she, too, had sensed a void in her col
legiate experience. There we were at the CoHo,
feeling sufficiently intellectual-looking in our
corduroy jackets with Chai tea and books spread
in front of us, when we realized that — despite
our own undeniable nerdiness — there was a no
ticeable lack of nerdy guys in our lives.
Throughout high school, we were told that col
lege guys would be different — that they would
n't be intimidated by smart girls, that they would
be falling all over us. I assumed this was true; it
had always been my experience that the guys I
met at academic gatherings — that is, the nerdy
ones — were the ones with whom I had the best
connections. I assumed that a similar connection
would be easy to find at college.
But no such luck. My friend and I observed
that not only had we not connected with any
nerdy guys, but we had hardly met any nerdy guys
at all.
Let me clarify: In the eyes of many of the girls
whom I know (or, at the very least, according to
my CoHo cohort and me), nerdiness is an endear

ing quality. Math nerds, hand geeks, literature
dorks, drama freaks, we ll take them all. Glasses
are a bonus.
There's just something about a nerdy guy that
makes him irresistible to us nerdy girls (and pre
sumably to non-nerdy girls as well — sort of like
a reversed-role version of the classic 90s teen
movie, "She's All That"). Maybe it's the fact that
we can be ourselves around them, that their ac
ceptance of their own nerdiness convinces us that
they will accept all of our peculiar quirks and ec
centricities, too. Or maybe the reason is that we
are hopeless romantics and dream of a guy with
whom we can wile away the hours in the corner of

music to the meaning of life. (Person
ally, I would also appreciate someone
who won't make fun of me for using
the phrase "with whom" in everyday
conversation).
So. where are all these guys hiding?
It can't be that they don't exist. One
would imagine that, at a place like
Stanford, nerdy guys would be run
ning rampant around campus; I, for
one, am convinced that they are out
there somewhere. Could it be that

they have just become extra-profi
cient at blending into the crowd?
Could we be passing them everyday
on our way to class or waiting behind
them in the pizza line at lunch?
Long gone are the days of pocket
protectors, suspenders and other
overt displays of nerdiness; exposing
somebody as the nerd that he is now
requires more than a first impression.
Today's nerds make us work before
letting us see their charming idiosyn
crasies and social ineptitudes. But
when they finally do, we melt.
To hasten said melting, however,
nerds need to go out and actively pur
sue other nerds. The problem is that
the average nerd is not likely to be in

attendance at a frat party or whatever
strikingly similar social activity is tak
ing place on a Friday night. More like
ly they are the ones staying in, watch
ing a movie or just talking in some
one's room, which — while conducive
to strengthening bonds between
friends — doesn't help when you're
looking to meet new people.
My proposed solution is a compro
mise. It's plain that in order to get to
know other people (nerdy or other
wise), leaving the dorm is an impor
tant step — but that step doesn't have
to be toward a frat house. And it may
be true that you can meet people in
class, but it's hard to feel attractive
when you've just rolled out of bed at

8:30 fora 9 a.m. lecture (because, let's
face it. nerds have eyes, too). Ideally,
