## Prop. 73 would support, protect minors 
### NOELLE PATNO 
Currently, a girl in California as young as
12 years old may be taken to have an abor
tion without her parents' knowledge. This is
unfair to parents who are legally and finan
cially responsible for her. In the unemanci
pated minor's struggle with the serious and
emotional difficulty of the unplanned preg
nancy which does not necessarily include
her parents, she may face the potential influ
ences of profit-driven abortionists or older,
even abusive, boyfriends.
The solution is Proposition 73, which will
give pregnant girls the support they need.
And it will do so without the false fears of
the bill's opponents, who disregard parents'
rights and the best interests of minors.

For cases such as abusive homes, in which
parental notification may be disastrous, the
proposition makes the judicial bypass a sim
ple, form-based procedure. At the time of
her abortion request, a minor will face a
choice: She may fill out and mail a parental
notification form or the judicial bypass
form. If she chooses the latter, a judge must
hold a hearing with the girl — an informal,
one-on-one meeting, not an invasive trial —
within two days of receiving the form. If the
judge has not decided on whether or not to
grant the waiver by 5 p.m. on the third day,
the girl is not required to notify her parents.
The judicial bypass system established
by Prop. 73 will thus serve three important
purposes: It will protect minors who are in
rare but dangerous cases of potential

parental abuse; it will ensure that the ap
propriate child protection agency is noti
fied about such situations and it will avoid
delaying time-sensitive medical proce
dures any more than a matter of days. All
voters are encouraged to read the text of
the proposition —is it available on the
Web — before voting in order to dispel the
myths that are being circulated by those
who hope to defeat it on Tuesday.
It's common sense that parental involve
ment is essential for children to make ap
propriate decisions about health care. Go to
the polls Nov. 8 and vote "yes" on Prop. 73.
