# Prop. 74 would advance accountability

### WELLS WULSIN 
By removing some of the hurdles to dis
missing unsatisfactory teachers. Proposi
tion 74 takes a step toward filling every
classroom with a high-quality teacher. The
current tenure laws make it too easy for
inept or burned-out teachers to mark time
at their post, which is unfair to other moti
vated teachers who want those jobs and
certainly unfair to children who deserve
the best teacher a principal can find.
Authorizing the dismissal of a teacher
for two consecutive unsatisfactory ratings is
not punishment; it is a reasonable perform
ance standard on par with those for profes

sionals in most other industries. Teachers in
private and parochial schools commonly
sign contracts lasting just one or two years,
so adding qualifications to tenure job secu
rity is unlikely to discourage many teachers
from joining the public schools.
I saw first-hand the dangers of
unchecked tenure while teaching at an
inner-city public school in Washington,
D.C. I\vo teachers were transferred out of
my school, one for hurling a stapler at a stu
dent, another for behaving inappropriately
toward his female students. My principal
could have fired them â€” following lengthy
procedures and risking a lawsuit.
Instead, he made the same choice as

many other principals facing strict tenure
constraints: He shuffled the bad teachers
out and hoped the new ones would be bet
ter. This hot-potato game, with odds tilted
against tough schools, entrenches the
teacher-quality disparity between poor and
affluent schools in a district.
Opponents of Prop. 74 argue that other
problems in our schools need to be ad
dressed before we start replacing under
performing teachers with inspired ones. For
the sake of children in the neediest schools,
we cannot afford to wait any longer.
