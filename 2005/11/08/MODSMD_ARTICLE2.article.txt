# Students share stances on the remaining props

### AMIT ARORA 
With millions expected to vote
across the state in the California
special election, concerns regarding
redistricting, pharmaceutical drug
discounts and electricity regulation
will finally be addressed today. The
Daily concludes its three-part
overview of the initiatives, with
Propositions 77, 78, 79 and 80 dis
cussed below.
Prop. 77:
Prop. 77 involves the redrawing
of congressional district boundaries
and transfers control of reappor
tionment from the state legislature
to a panel of three retired judges. If
passed, redistricting would begin
immediately in 2(X)6 and would af
fect the allocation of seats in the
House of Representatives for the
next midterm election.
The initiative has sparked con
troversy, as many Democrats argue
that the Republicans are attempting
to upset the partisan balance in a
primarily Democrat-affiliated state.
While many opponents recognize
the need for the redrawing of dis
trict lines and preventive measures
against gerrymandering, they argue
that reapportionment should begin
in 2011 and not 200b.
Although the Stanford Democ
rats have not adopted an official
stance on the initiative. President
Margot Isman, a sophomore, de-
Scribed her personal opinions on the
issue.
"It's important to remember that

these three judges are political ap
pointees and that they are definitely
not non-political," she said.
In addition, Isman highlighted
the effects of the measure on minor
ity groups in California.
"Proposition 77 disenfranchises
minorities through mid-year redis
tricting," Isman argued. "Reappor
tionment is based on five-year-old
census data, and because minorities
are the fastest growing population,
they will not be adequately repre
sented by the initiative."
Supporters of the bill, however,
argue that current district lines sim
ply do not foster competition be
tween the major political parties.
Past election data, advocates assert,
reflect radically high re-election
numbers among congressional rep
resentatives. Promoters of the initia
tive contend that more moderate
congresspersons would be appoint
ed by Californians if the district
lines were fairer and non-partisan.
Senior Bob Sensenbrenner, for
mer president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans, discussed the im
partiality of the new process.
"The panel uses retired judges
and requires that at least one judge
be of a different political party," he
noted. "The initiative will reshape
state politics and will improve Cali
fornia's political health."
Current polls show that more
Californians are opposed to the ini
tiative than in support. The Field
Poll reported that only 35 percent of
those surveyed are for the measure
while 51 percent are against Prop. 77.
The Los Angeles Times reflected sim
ilar numbers, with 34 percent in favor
and 56 percent against.
Prop. 78 and 79:
Both Prop. 78 and 79 involve dis
counts for pharmaceutical drugs. As
both appear nearly identical in the
California Voter's Guide, it becomes
increasingly important to understand
the key differences between the two
initiatives.
Prop. 78suggests that pharmaceuti
cal companies provide rebates to low
and-middle-income families in the
state. The discounts would be volun
tary and would apply to individuals
with annual incomes of $28,000 or less
and families of four with incomes of
$56,000 or less.
Prop. 79 mandates prescription
drug discounts by participating phar
maceutical companies. The income
limits for this initiative are also high-

Erin comparison to Prop. 78, with
qualifying individual incomes of
$37,(KK) or less and $75,(XK) fora fam
ily of four.
Prop. 78 has largely been backed
by the pharmaceutical industry,
while Prop. 79 continues to receive
funding from consumer and health
groups.
On campus, many students are di
vided on this issue. Freshman Shams
Shaikh noted the huge profits of drug
manufacturers and expressed his sup
port for Prop. 79.
"The pharmaceutical companies
make billions of dollars every year,"
he said. "It is their obligation to the
community to make drugs more ac
cessible to lower-income Californi
ans."
Other students noted the increased
risks of Prop. 79 in terms of the state's
health needs
"The initiative would open phar
maceutical companies up to a large
amount of lawsuits, which would nega
tively affect their ability to introduce
new drugs to the market," Sensen
brennersaid.
Ultimately Props. 78 and 79 offer
two markedly different attempts at al

leviating the strains of drug costs on
Californians. Introduction to the Hu
inanities lecturer Margo Horn cap
tured the essence of the situation when
speaking on the opposing needs re
flected by the issue.
"The pharmaceutical companies
compete in a for-profit industry," she
noted. "Government regulation,
though, is necessary for lower-in
come individuals to afford prescrip
tion drugs. It is essential that Califor
nia find some sort of public-private
balance."
The Field Poll currently shows
that 36 percent of voters support
Prop. 78, while 45 percent are op
posed. Prop. 79, meanwhile, has the
approval of 37 percent of Californi
ans, with 43 percent against. With a
large percentage of the populace
undecided, the success of these two
initiatives will only be determined
on Election Day. If both are ap
proved, then the initiative with the
greater number of votes will be im
plemented.
Prop. 80:
Prop. 80 reauthorizes the Califor
nia Public Utilities Commission to reg
ulate electricity in the state. The bill

also establishes a 2010 deadline for
California to secure 20 percent of its
electricity from renewable energy
sources.
Opponents contend that regula
tion would limit the participation of in
dependent energy companies, while
supporters assert that the initiative
would prevent future electricity emer
gencies.
In the last two decades, California's
energy policy has resulted in the
deregulation of electricity. Prop. 80
would allow the state government in
creased control over energy produc
tion and distribution.
Due to minimal funding from both
support and opposition groups, a large
percentage of Californians are unde
cided on the measure, as reported by
Field Poll findings. The latest results
showed that only 24 percent are in sup
port of the measure while 48 percent
oppose it.
On campus, a number of student
groups have been active in raising pub
licity for the election. Polling booths
will be open until 8:00 p.m. in the
Faisan Lounge in Florence Moore
Hall and in the Graduate Student
Community Center.
