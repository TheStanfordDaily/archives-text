# Students share stances on the remaining props

### AMIT ARORA 
With millions expected to vote
across the state in the California
special election, concerns regarding
redistricting, pharmaceutical drug
discounts and electricity regulation
will finally be addressed today. The
Daily concludes its three-part
overview of the initiatives, with
Propositions 77, 78, 79 and 80 dis
cussed below.
Prop. 77:
Prop. 77 involves the redrawing
of congressional district boundaries
and transfers control of reappor
tionment from the state legislature
to a panel of three retired judges. If
passed, redistricting would begin
immediately in 2(X)6 and would af
fect the allocation of seats in the
House of Representatives for the
next midterm election.
The initiative has sparked con
troversy, as many Democrats argue
that the Republicans are attempting
to upset the partisan balance in a
primarily Democrat-affiliated state.
While many opponents recognize
the need for the redrawing of dis
trict lines and preventive measures
against gerrymandering, they argue
that reapportionment should begin
in 2011 and not 200b.
Although the Stanford Democ
rats have not adopted an official
stance on the initiative. President
Margot Isman, a sophomore, de-
Scribed her personal opinions on the
issue.
"It's important to remember that

these three judges are political ap
pointees and that they are definitely
not non-political," she said.
In addition, Isman highlighted
the effects of the measure on minor
ity groups in California.
"Proposition 77 disenfranchises
minorities through mid-year redis
tricting," Isman argued. "Reappor
tionment is based on five-year-old
census data, and because minorities
are the fastest growing population,
they will not be adequately repre
sented by the initiative."
Supporters of the bill, however,
argue that current district lines sim
ply do not foster competition be
tween the major political parties.
Past election data, advocates assert,
reflect radically high re-election
numbers among congressional rep
resentatives. Promoters of the initia
tive contend that more moderate
congresspersons would be appoint
ed by Californians if the district
lines were fairer and non-partisan.
Senior Bob Sensenbrenner, for
mer president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans, discussed the im
partiality of the new process.
"The panel uses retired judges
and requires that at least one judge
be of a different political party," he
noted. "The initiative will reshape
state politics and will improve Cali
fornia's political health."
Current polls show that more
Californians are opposed to the ini
tiative than in support. The Field
Poll reported that only 35 percent of
