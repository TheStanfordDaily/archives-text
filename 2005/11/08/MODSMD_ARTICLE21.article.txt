# Prop. 77's process is misguided
## 
### DEVON SWEZEY 
The U.S. Congress currently has an incum
bency rate of 93 percent.That rate is even high
er in the California state legislature, where not
a single seat changed parties in the last
statewide election. This statistic highlights the
important implications that redistricting has
for California's electoral process.
Proposition 77 seeks to amend the state
constitution by reforming state redistricting
laws. By drawing new district lines, proponents
of the measure hope to address the problem of
high incumbency rates. While voters should be
wary of a political system in which their repre
sentatives have almost no fear of being re
moved from office, this measure would do little
to increase competition among candidates for
elected office and would exclude the public
from political debate.
As the state constitution currently stands,
state legislators are given control of drawing
congressional maps of voting districts. The re
sulting maps often protect incumbents by
placing them in districts where the over
whelming majority of constituents are from
the incumbent's party — thus ensuring their
reelection.
Prop. 77 proposes that "legislative leaders"
select three retired judges to redraw district

lines. Because judges are politically neutral in
theory, proponents say the new districts will
be drawn more fairly than the current ones.
But in reality, judges are seldom divorced
from politics. A group of judges appointed by
legislative leaders seems unlikely to work for
increased competition among candidates for
elected office — especially because these
judges would be selected by current legisla
tors who, presumably, would prefer to keep
their jobs.
Californians should be concerned about the
potential for gerrymandering, or unfair redis
ricting, if Prop. 77 becomes part of the state
constitution. Prop. 77 is unlikely to encourage
the robust competition that ensures our elect
ed representatives will remain honest and cog
nizant of the needs of Californians.
California citizens should instead push for
national legislation designed to curb gerry
mandering. When this problem is solved na
tionally, all incumbents, regardless of party
or state, will face the challenging reelection
race they — and their constituents — de
serve.
