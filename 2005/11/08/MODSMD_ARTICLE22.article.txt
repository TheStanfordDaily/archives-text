# Blood center celebrates off-campus relocation
## Greater space allows for more comfortable blood donation settings Coordinators anticipate spike in number of blood contributors 
### ADA YEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Imagine sitting back in a comfortable, auto-re
clining chair to watch a DVD, check your e-mail and,
while you're at it, save a life.
Donors can now do just this at the Stanford Blood
Center's new building on Hillview Avenue, just
southeast of campus. The location opened in mid-
September, but donors, staff and surrounding com
munity members celebrated its launch Saturday af
ternoon with food.speakers and tours of the facilities.
The Hillview building houses the Blood Center's
base of operations, which used to be located on-cam
pus on Welch Road. It also features a larger and
more comfortable donation room with chairs that
recline with the push of a button and DVD players
at the donating stations.
Recently, the demand for blood at the Stanford
Hospital has gone up by 10 percent each year. The
hope is that creating a better experience for donors
will encourage them to continue donating in order
to fulfill this need.
"Donors are giving blood for free," said Blood

Center Administrator Vince Yalon. "So ambience
and comfort are a big deal. The question is 'how do
you get people to donate for life?'"
According to Yalon the extra space will create a
better environment for staff and enable them to in
teract more closely with donors, a key step in getting
them to return.
Public Relations Manager Michele Hyndman
said she believes that the response to the new center
has been positive and predicts that there will be a
spike in donations in about two months, when
donors who have seen the new center are again eli
gible to give blood.
"From the beginning, donors have been excited
and pleased with the new center," Hyndman said.
However, the new blood center was built for rea
sons beyond increasing donor comfort. The Stan
ford Blood Center's former location was old and
cramped, according to Hyndman and Yalon. While
the Hillview center's entrance may seem very fancy,
Yalon said, in terms of laboratory space, the move
was very practical.
The Welch Road building dates back to 1958. Dr.
Edward Engleman, the center's director and a re
searcher in Stanford Medical School's Department
of Pathology, said that it was originally designed as
office space and remodeled for use as a wet lab. Be-

fore the move to Hillview, the Welch
building housed 250 employees when its

' official maximum capacity was 80.
"Blood testing has moved to the molecu
lar level," Yalon said. "This requires larger
equipment and more space in order to min
imize contamination."
The new building was constructed in
1999 and was originally meant to house a

high-tech company of the kind that was

flourishing during the stock market boom.The

building has 50,(XX) square-feet, as opposed to the
18,000 square-feet in the Welch location.
One disadvantage that Engleman noted was that
the new center is located off campus, although blood
collection will continue at the Welch building.
According to Yalon, funding for the Hillview
center came from the Stanford Medical School's
Department of Pathology.
"The blood center would never have the money
to do this on its own — it's a break-even enter
prise," Yalon said. "To develop the funds would
have been difficult. The department has been ex
tremely important."
At the celebration on Saturday, Engleman made
a speech, elaborating on the blood center's history.
"For two years, the Stanford Blood center was
the only in the country to test for AIDS," Engleman
said in an interview with The Daily. "Combining ac
ademics and research with blood banking pays very
important dividends"
In addition to Engleman's speech, there were
talks by Stephen Galli. chair of the Department of
Pathology, and by Meghan Daily, a transfusion re
cipient. Daily unexpectedly fell victim to Thrombot
ic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( I I P), a disease
which causes internal bleeding, when she was 19-
years-old. She received 89 days worth of blood trans
fusions from 987 anonymous donors.
"No one knows whose going to need blood," said
Daily, who is a volunteer speaker for Blood Centers
of the Pacific and the Stanford Blood Center. "There
are a lot of people like me whose lives have been
saved and are okay because of anonymous people
who donate."

cramped, according to Hyndman and Yalon. While
the Hillview center's entrance may seem very fancy,
Yalon said, in terms of laboratory space, the move
was very practical.
The Welch Road building dates back to 1958. Dr.
Edward Engleman, the center's director and a re
searcher in Stanford Medical School's Department
of Pathology, said that it was originally designed as
office space and remodeled for use as a wet lab. Be-

fore the move to Hillview, the Welch
building housed 250 employees when its

' official maximum capacity was 80.
"Blood testing has moved to the molecu
lar level," Yalon said. "This requires larger
equipment and more space in order to min
imize contamination."
The new building was constructed in
1999 and was originally meant to house a

high-tech company of the kind that was

flourishing during the stock market boom.The

building has 50,(XX) square-feet, as opposed to the
18,000 square-feet in the Welch location.
One disadvantage that Engleman noted was that
the new center is located off campus, although blood
collection will continue at the Welch building.
According to Yalon, funding for the Hillview
center came from the Stanford Medical School's
Department of Pathology.
"The blood center would never have the money
to do this on its own — it's a break-even enter
prise," Yalon said. "To develop the funds would
have been difficult. The department has been ex
tremely important."
At the celebration on Saturday, Engleman made
a speech, elaborating on the blood center's history.
"For two years, the Stanford Blood center was
the only in the country to test for AIDS," Engleman
said in an interview with The Daily. "Combining ac
ademics and research with blood banking pays very
important dividends"
In addition to Engleman's speech, there were
talks by Stephen Galli. chair of the Department of
Pathology, and by Meghan Daily, a transfusion re
cipient. Daily unexpectedly fell victim to Thrombot
ic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( I I P), a disease
which causes internal bleeding, when she was 19-
years-old. She received 89 days worth of blood trans
fusions from 987 anonymous donors.
"No one knows whose going to need blood," said
Daily, who is a volunteer speaker for Blood Centers
of the Pacific and the Stanford Blood Center. "There
are a lot of people like me whose lives have been
saved and are okay because of anonymous people
who donate."

Imagine sitting back in a comfortable, auto-re
clining chair to watch a DVD, check your e-mail and,
while you're at it, save a life.
Donors can now do just this at the Stanford Blood
Center's new building on Hillview Avenue, just
southeast of campus. The location opened in mid-
September, but donors, staff and surrounding com
munity members celebrated its launch Saturday af
ternoon with food.speakers and tours of the facilities.
The Hillview building houses the Blood Center's
base of operations, which used to be located on-cam
pus on Welch Road. It also features a larger and
more comfortable donation room with chairs that
recline with the push of a button and DVD players
at the donating stations.
Recently, the demand for blood at the Stanford
Hospital has gone up by 10 percent each year. The
hope is that creating a better experience for donors
will encourage them to continue donating in order
to fulfill this need.
"Donors are giving blood for free," said Blood

Center Administrator Vince Yalon. "So ambience
and comfort are a big deal. The question is 'how do
you get people to donate for life?'"
According to Yalon the extra space will create a
better environment for staff and enable them to in
teract more closely with donors, a key step in getting
them to return.
Public Relations Manager Michele Hyndman
said she believes that the response to the new center
has been positive and predicts that there will be a
spike in donations in about two months, when
donors who have seen the new center are again eli
gible to give blood.
"From the beginning, donors have been excited
and pleased with the new center," Hyndman said.
However, the new blood center was built for rea
sons beyond increasing donor comfort. The Stan
ford Blood Center's former location was old and
cramped, according to Hyndman and Yalon. While
the Hillview center's entrance may seem very fancy,
Yalon said, in terms of laboratory space, the move
was very practical.
