## WOMEN'S SOCCER Women end season with sweep Cardinal hold both Oregon schools to finish 10-6-3 
### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With three goals in two wins this past week
end, Stanford women's soccer (10-6-3,4-3-2 Pa
cific* 10 Conference) silenced its critics and
ending its regular season on a high note.
Dominant on the field in Oregon, the Cardi
nal showed no trace of the team that had found
trouble scoring in recent matches. Stanford
notched consecutive victoriesl-0 over Oregon
State, 1-0, and against Oregon, 2-0.
The weekend's results not only put the Car
dinal at fourth place in the final conference
standings — behind overall winners UCLA.
California and USC — but are also vital in aid
ing Stanford's bid for the NCAA postseason
tournament.
Although the Cardinal's conference finish
was predicted in the preseason polls, the senti
ment is that the team's overall performance this
season deserved a better result.
"I think the Pac-10 is very difficult," head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "We had a few results
which were very, very close. We need a lot of
luck in the Pac-10. Against UCLA we tied 0-0
and could easily have beaten them. Things just
didn't go our way, and if it did we could have
placed higher."
Stanford's performance this weekend ap
peared to confirm this sentiment. Against Ore
gon State (10-8-1,3-5-1) on Friday, the Cardinal
set the tone for the weekend, dominating their
opponents.The team dictated the play early on,
threatening the Beavers' goal with 11 shots in
the first half.
Stanford's breakthrough, however, came in
the second half when midfielders Shari Sum
mers, a junior, and Kelley Birch, a freshman,
combined in the 68th minute. Birch's shot came
from 20 yards out and found the upper left cor
ner of the goal, beating junior keeper Melissa
Onstad.This goal was Birch's first this season.
The match also saw the return of freshman
Alex Gamble to goal after the rookie keeper
missed the last two weekends of conference
play due to injury. Gamble recorded two saves
in the game to pick up her seventh shutout of

the season.
Sunday's game against Oregon (9-9-1,1 -8-0)
saw another convincing performance from
Birch, who for the second time in as many
games scored the game-winner for the Cardi
nal.
Fifth-year senior midfielder Martha West
assisted on Birch's goal in the 30th minute of
the match before West found the back of the
net on her own in the 70th minute to seal the
victory for Stanford.
Despite the Duck's determination to secure
their first winning season in program history,
they were no match for the Cardinal's solid
backline.
Stanford's goal saw more changes this week
end with sophomore Erica Holland and senior
Elizabeth Barnard combining for the Cardi

nal's 11th shutout of the season. This brings
Stanford's goals against average to 0.76 per
game.
"I think we had two strong performances
from the entire team," Ratcliffe said. "Birch
turned out to be our hero this weekend; she
scored two goals and an assist over the week
end. But overall the team played very solidly,
and we didn't concede any goals."
The weekend's only unfortunate conse
quence was a slight injury picked up by Sum
mers early in Friday's match. However, after a
consultation with the trainer, the midfielder re
turned to play for the Cardinal for the remain
der of Friday's game and against the Ducks on
Sunday.
"Summers picked up a pretty hard knock,"
Ratcliffe noted. "It swelled a little bit after Sun

day but we're hoping she'll come back for the
next weekend."
With the regular season behind them, Stan
ford's sights now turn to the NCAA tourna
ment where the team is scheduled to play Saint
Louis in the opening round.The game is sched
uled for Friday at 7.30 p.m. in Santa Clara. It
also marks the Cardinal's eighth straight ap
pearance in the postseason tournament where
Stanford currently holds a 12-12-3 record. Bol
stered by this weekend's results, the team is set
to persevere over the week in preparation for
the postseason.
"This weekend's results definitely help us,"
Ratcliffe said. "But we still have work to do. In
particular, we need to focus on playing good
possession soccer for the upcoming matches in
the postseason."

uled for Friday at 7.30 p.m. in Santa Clara. It
also marks the Cardinal's eighth straight ap
pearance in the postseason tournament where
Stanford currently holds a 12-12-3 record. Bol
stered by this weekend's results, the team is set
to persevere over the week in preparation for
the postseason.
"This weekend's results definitely help us,"
Ratcliffe said. "But we still have work to do. In
particular, we need to focus on playing good
possession soccer for the upcoming matches in
the postseason."

Senior midfielder Martha West, seen here in action against Washington, assisted on Kelley Birch's 68th minute goal and added an insurance tally
for the Cardinal just two minutes later against Oregon on Sunday.
With three goals in two wins this past week
end, Stanford women's soccer (10-6-3,4-3-2 Pa
cific* 10 Conference) silenced its critics and
ending its regular season on a high note.
Dominant on the field in Oregon, the Cardi
nal showed no trace of the team that had found
trouble scoring in recent matches. Stanford
notched consecutive victoriesl-0 over Oregon
State, 1-0, and against Oregon, 2-0.
The weekend's results not only put the Car
dinal at fourth place in the final conference
standings — behind overall winners UCLA.
California and USC — but are also vital in aid
ing Stanford's bid for the NCAA postseason
tournament.
Although the Cardinal's conference finish
was predicted in the preseason polls, the senti
ment is that the team's overall performance this
season deserved a better result.
"I think the Pac-10 is very difficult," head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "We had a few results
which were very, very close. We need a lot of
luck in the Pac-10. Against UCLA we tied 0-0
and could easily have beaten them. Things just
didn't go our way, and if it did we could have
placed higher."
Stanford's performance this weekend ap
peared to confirm this sentiment. Against Ore
gon State (10-8-1,3-5-1) on Friday, the Cardinal
set the tone for the weekend, dominating their
opponents.The team dictated the play early on,
threatening the Beavers' goal with 11 shots in
the first half.
Stanford's breakthrough, however, came in
the second half when midfielders Shari Sum
mers, a junior, and Kelley Birch, a freshman,
combined in the 68th minute. Birch's shot came
from 20 yards out and found the upper left cor
ner of the goal, beating junior keeper Melissa
Onstad.This goal was Birch's first this season.
The match also saw the return of freshman
Alex Gamble to goal after the rookie keeper
missed the last two weekends of conference
play due to injury. Gamble recorded two saves
in the game to pick up her seventh shutout of

the season.
Sunday's game against Oregon (9-9-1,1 -8-0)
saw another convincing performance from
Birch, who for the second time in as many
games scored the game-winner for the Cardi
nal.
Fifth-year senior midfielder Martha West
assisted on Birch's goal in the 30th minute of
the match before West found the back of the
net on her own in the 70th minute to seal the
victory for Stanford.
Despite the Duck's determination to secure
their first winning season in program history,
they were no match for the Cardinal's solid
backline.
Stanford's goal saw more changes this week
end with sophomore Erica Holland and senior
Elizabeth Barnard combining for the Cardi

nal's 11th shutout of the season. This brings
Stanford's goals against average to 0.76 per
game.
"I think we had two strong performances
from the entire team," Ratcliffe said. "Birch
turned out to be our hero this weekend; she
scored two goals and an assist over the week
end. But overall the team played very solidly,
and we didn't concede any goals."
The weekend's only unfortunate conse
quence was a slight injury picked up by Sum
mers early in Friday's match. However, after a
consultation with the trainer, the midfielder re
turned to play for the Cardinal for the remain
der of Friday's game and against the Ducks on
Sunday.
"Summers picked up a pretty hard knock,"
Ratcliffe noted. "It swelled a little bit after Sun

day but we're hoping she'll come back for the
next weekend."
With the regular season behind them, Stan
ford's sights now turn to the NCAA tourna
ment where the team is scheduled to play Saint
Louis in the opening round.The game is sched
uled for Friday at 7.30 p.m. in Santa Clara. It
also marks the Cardinal's eighth straight ap
pearance in the postseason tournament where
Stanford currently holds a 12-12-3 record. Bol
