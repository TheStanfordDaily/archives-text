# MEN'S SOCCER
## Defense keeps men afloat 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
A major problem for Stanford
men's soccer this season has been the
team's struggle to score goals. Despite
a plethora of opportunities and near
misses, the Cardinal were once again
shut out this weekend in a 1-0 over
time loss to No. 7 UCLA and then
again in a scoreless draw against San
Diego State.
Stanford (4-10-3, 1-6-2 Pacific-10
Conference) opened Friday night's
game by honoring the three graduat
ing seniors: Cooper McKee, Bronson
McDonald and K.C. Coyne. Only
McKee saw playing time in his final
homestand, as the other two upper
classmen were sidelined with in
juries.
The Bruins (11-3-3,6-1-3) outshot
the Cardinal 3-1 in the first half, but the
squads split time of possession and
scoring opportunities fairly evenly. In
the second half, the Cardinal reined
the game in even more and kept pace
with UCLA, as both teams notched
five shots on the period. Junior mid
fielder Michael Brown led Stanford
with two shots, while the outside play
of junior midfielder Galen Thompson
and freshman defender Michael
Alexander also created numerous
scoring chances.
"UCLA is a great team and things
worked out for awhile for us," Brown
said. "We created the opportunities
and we should have had a couple
goals."
The Maloney Field faithful nearly
saw Stanford go up on a nemesis it has
not beaten since 2000, when a cross in
the middle of the second half came in
from the right flank and went to the far
post. UCLA junior goalkeeper Eric
Reed was slightly out of position but
the Cardinal forwards could not con
nect cleanly inside the box, and a
UCLA defender was able to block the
ball out of bounds.

Second-half injuries, including one
to sophomore defender Ryan Oblak,
depleted the reserves as the game
moved towards overtime. After regu
lation ended at 0-0, UCLA abruptly
ended the sudden-death extra frame
with a goal in the 92nd minute. Fresh
man Maxwell Griffin knocked in a re
hound from inside the six-yard box,
sealing another loss for the Cardinal.
The Bruins clinched the Pac-10 title for
the fourth consecutive year later in the
weekend.
"UCLA was another game where
our young team continued to grow
into a pretty good squad," head coach

Bret Simon said. "[The Bruins] are ar
guably the most talented team in the
country, and we had a couple opportu
nities to put one in that just didn't hap
pen. By the end, I think due to injuries
and fatigue, we weren't as sharp as we
were in the beginning, and they finally
capitalized."
The inability to finish off opportu
nities grew even more frustrating on
Sunday for Stanford, when San Diego
State (9-2-6,2-2-5) came to the Farm.
Stanford recorded 13 shots and 11 cor
ner kicks in the match, maintaining

Sophomore forward Dan Shapiro led the squad with five shots this weekend.
Neither Shapiro nor the rest of the Cardinal attack could find the back of the
net against the Southern California schools.
