# No.1 USC and No.6 Irvine defeat Cardinal
## MEN'S WATER POLO 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Before they left last Friday to take
on top-ranked Southern California
and No. 6 UC-Irvine,the No. 3 Cardi
nal water polo team was on a roll.
They were riding the momentum of
an impressive string of victories that
culminated with a thrilling overtime
defeat of 2(X)4 national champion
UCLA and a hard-fought 11-9 deci
sion over No. 5 Pepperdine.
They were playing shutdown de
fense and were converting their scor
ing opportunities. With only four
games remaining on the regular sea
son schedule, Stanford stood unde
feated in conference play and
seemed to be pulling everything to
gether fora NCAA title drive.
But the Cardinal (15-5,4-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) were
unable to continue their streak of
quality performances this weekend,
suffering a pair of disappointing de

feats at the hands of the Trojans and
the Anteaters by scores of 8-7 and 8-
5, respectively.
The Cardinal entered the week
end coming off two strong wins
against UCLA and Pepperdine. Not
only did Stanford's defenders consis
tently pressure their marks hut they
also managed to contain the opposi
tion's six-on-five advantage. The
squad's ability to defend shorthand
ed proved a critical factor in both
wins and had the Cardinal eager for
the chance to knock off the Trojans
for the first time this year.
"We are excited to have this
chance to go down to L.A. and play
good Stanford water polo" junior
Peter Finlayson said prior to the
weekend. "They've beaten us two
times this year, [so] it would be great
for our momentum going in the post
season to knock them off this week
end and avenge those losses."
But from the outset of the match
against USC,it was apparent that Stan
ford would not enjoy the same success
on the penalty-kill. The TVojans took
the early advantage by capitalizing on
all three of their six-on-five opportuni
ties in the first half to build a 4-2 lead.
The TYojans stretched their lead to
three on the strength of senior two
meter defender Juraj Zatovic's first
tally of the game.
Midway through the third period,
the Cardinal finally hit stride offen
sively and roared back with three
unanswered goals. Senior captain
Peter Varellas keyed the comeback
by notching two of those three to
bring the Cardinal back even with
the Trojans.
The two teams played a scoreless
fourth period, sending to contest to
overtime. USC sophomore two-meter
Tommy Corcoran emerged to lead his
squad, earning a four-meter penalty
shot that Zatovic buried. Corcoran
then forced a Cardinal exclusion 30
seconds into the second overtime peri
od, and the TYojans converted the six
on-five advantage to go up by two.
Nevertheless, Stanford refused to
quit and mounted an improbable
comeback to tie the game at 7-7. With
40 seconds left in the period, the Cardi
nal offense worked a shot that looked
destined to decide the game in Stan
ford's favor.
But the ball rebounded off the
crossbar and was quickly collected by

Corcoran. The sophomore two-meter
sent a perfect outlet to streaking jun
ior Juan Delgadillo, who found the
back of the cage to put the Trojans
ahead 8-7. In doing so, Delgadillo
recorded a final-second game-winner
for the second time this season against
the Cardinal.
The Cardinal tried to salvage a
weekend split as they took on UC-
Irvine Sunday afternoon, but an early
Anteater offensive explosion left the
Cardinal fighting an uphill battle the
entire game.
The underdog Anteaters, who have
won four of their last five decisions, tal
lied three goals in the opening period
of play while thoroughly stifling the
Cardinal offense. Stanford battled
back to within two as time expired in
the first half of play, but that was as
close as the Cardinal would get. Irvine
senior Nate White paced his squad
with three goals in the Anteaters' 8-5
victory.
With only two games remaining
before the MPSF tournament in Mal
ibu, Calif., the Cardinal face the diffi
cult task of regaining their momen
tum against a pair of tough squads —
UC-Santa Barbara and No. 2 Califor
nia. But the Stanford squad has re
sponded to adversity in numerous
times this season, so it is possible that
this past weekend's disappointment
may be just the motivating force the
team needs to excel in the coming
postseason.

Cardinal fighting an uphill battle the
entire game.
The underdog Anteaters, who have
won four of their last five decisions, tal
lied three goals in the opening period
of play while thoroughly stifling the
Cardinal offense. Stanford battled
back to within two as time expired in
the first half of play, but that was as
close as the Cardinal would get. Irvine
senior Nate White paced his squad
with three goals in the Anteaters' 8-5
victory.
With only two games remaining
before the MPSF tournament in Mal

cult task of regaining their momen

UC-Santa Barbara and No. 2 Califor

sponded to adversity in numerous
times this season, so it is possible that
this past weekend's disappointment
may be just the motivating force the
team needs to excel in the coming
postseason.

Sophomore goalie Sandy Hohener notched eight saves in Stanford's 8-7 loss to UC-lrvine Sunday afternoon.
Before they left last Friday to take
on top-ranked Southern California
and No. 6 UC-Irvine,the No. 3 Cardi
nal water polo team was on a roll.
They were riding the momentum of
an impressive string of victories that
culminated with a thrilling overtime
defeat of 2(X)4 national champion
UCLA and a hard-fought 11-9 deci
sion over No. 5 Pepperdine.
They were playing shutdown de
fense and were converting their scor
ing opportunities. With only four
games remaining on the regular sea
son schedule, Stanford stood unde
feated in conference play and
seemed to be pulling everything to
gether fora NCAA title drive.
But the Cardinal (15-5,4-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) were
unable to continue their streak of
quality performances this weekend,
suffering a pair of disappointing de

feats at the hands of the Trojans and
the Anteaters by scores of 8-7 and 8-
5, respectively.
The Cardinal entered the week
end coming off two strong wins
against UCLA and Pepperdine. Not
only did Stanford's defenders consis
tently pressure their marks hut they
also managed to contain the opposi
tion's six-on-five advantage. The
squad's ability to defend shorthand
ed proved a critical factor in both
wins and had the Cardinal eager for
the chance to knock off the Trojans
for the first time this year.
"We are excited to have this
chance to go down to L.A. and play
good Stanford water polo" junior
Peter Finlayson said prior to the
weekend. "They've beaten us two
times this year, [so] it would be great
for our momentum going in the post
season to knock them off this week
end and avenge those losses."
But from the outset of the match
against USC,it was apparent that Stan
ford would not enjoy the same success
on the penalty-kill. The TVojans took
the early advantage by capitalizing on
all three of their six-on-five opportuni
ties in the first half to build a 4-2 lead.
The TYojans stretched their lead to
three on the strength of senior two
meter defender Juraj Zatovic's first
tally of the game.
Midway through the third period,
the Cardinal finally hit stride offen
sively and roared back with three
unanswered goals. Senior captain
Peter Varellas keyed the comeback
by notching two of those three to
bring the Cardinal back even with
the Trojans.
The two teams played a scoreless
fourth period, sending to contest to
overtime. USC sophomore two-meter
Tommy Corcoran emerged to lead his
squad, earning a four-meter penalty
shot that Zatovic buried. Corcoran
then forced a Cardinal exclusion 30
seconds into the second overtime peri
od, and the TYojans converted the six
on-five advantage to go up by two.
Nevertheless, Stanford refused to
quit and mounted an improbable
comeback to tie the game at 7-7. With
40 seconds left in the period, the Cardi
nal offense worked a shot that looked
destined to decide the game in Stan
ford's favor.
But the ball rebounded off the
crossbar and was quickly collected by

Corcoran. The sophomore two-meter
sent a perfect outlet to streaking jun
ior Juan Delgadillo, who found the
back of the cage to put the Trojans
ahead 8-7. In doing so, Delgadillo
recorded a final-second game-winner
for the second time this season against
the Cardinal.
The Cardinal tried to salvage a
weekend split as they took on UC-
Irvine Sunday afternoon, but an early
Anteater offensive explosion left the
Cardinal fighting an uphill battle the
entire game.
