# No.1 USC and No.6 Irvine defeat Cardinal
## MEN'S WATER POLO 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Before they left last Friday to take
on top-ranked Southern California
and No. 6 UC-Irvine,the No. 3 Cardi
nal water polo team was on a roll.
They were riding the momentum of
an impressive string of victories that
culminated with a thrilling overtime
defeat of 2(X)4 national champion
UCLA and a hard-fought 11-9 deci
sion over No. 5 Pepperdine.
They were playing shutdown de
fense and were converting their scor
ing opportunities. With only four
games remaining on the regular sea
son schedule, Stanford stood unde
feated in conference play and
seemed to be pulling everything to
gether fora NCAA title drive.
But the Cardinal (15-5,4-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) were
unable to continue their streak of
quality performances this weekend,
suffering a pair of disappointing de

feats at the hands of the Trojans and
the Anteaters by scores of 8-7 and 8-
5, respectively.
The Cardinal entered the week
end coming off two strong wins
against UCLA and Pepperdine. Not
only did Stanford's defenders consis
tently pressure their marks hut they
also managed to contain the opposi
tion's six-on-five advantage. The
squad's ability to defend shorthand
ed proved a critical factor in both
wins and had the Cardinal eager for
the chance to knock off the Trojans
for the first time this year.
"We are excited to have this
chance to go down to L.A. and play
good Stanford water polo" junior
Peter Finlayson said prior to the
weekend. "They've beaten us two
times this year, [so] it would be great
for our momentum going in the post
season to knock them off this week
end and avenge those losses."
