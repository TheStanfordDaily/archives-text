# Breaking news: USC plays well
## 
### 
As I watched USC slap Stanford
silly Saturday, 1 blinked into
the dewy Los Angeles night
and took hold of the idea that I was
watching something special.
I have seen national champi
onship teams. 1 was living in Seattle
when the 1991 Washington Huskies
mowed through their championship
season. 1 got to see Michigan's im
penetrable 1997 defense — one of
the best in decades —in person. 1
also saw Miami live in 2001, when it
won the national title.
If the Trojans hold on to win their
third straight title, they deserve to be
discussed in the same sentences as
those.
Let me disclaim that 1 have no ties
to USC. I have spend most of my days
rooting for teams that often butt
heads with the Trojans, such as Michi
gan, Stanford and Washington State.
1 am the last person one would ex
pect to suck up to Southern Califor
nia. And I resisted it — at least until
this weekend.
But I am also a journalist (and
also not stupid), and to put it simply,
the hype is for real. I will spare the su
perlatives — USC is a great team.
The pure dominance was expressed
by KZSU play-by-play man Andy
Aymeloglu: "Folks, there IS a profes
sional football team in Los Angeles."
Still, the TVojans are not without
their doubters.
Critics point to closer-than-ex
pected games against the Arizona
schools, where USC needed fourth
quarter surges to seal victory. They
say Notre Dame was one play away
from winning and should have beat
en the Trojans. Notre Dame certainly
could have.
But the Irish didn't. And neither
has anyone else in 31 games, since the
Trojans blew a triple-overtime deci
sion to Cal in early 2003. Say it slowly
now: 31 college games.
Far from being an Achilles heel,
duking out the close game might be
USC's secret weapon. Last season
the Trojans needed all 60 minutes to
fight off Stanford, Cal and UCLA.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma blew through
its Big 12 schedule with abandon.
But when it came time to play for
all the oranges, USC slammed the
door with 38 first-half points, elevat
ing its game against an opponent that
was certainly not a phony. It is not dif
ficult to imagine that the team's abil
ity to play loose was boosted by
knowing it could handle any sort of
challenge.
On paper, this year's team might
not even be as good as last year's,
with the absence of defensive stal
warts and offensive genius Norm
Chow. But forget the individual sea
sons. Taken as a continuum, the Th>
jans have an indomitable formula for
winning — recruiting, coaching, BCS
money and head coach Pete Carroll's
enthusiasm. With no evidence of
cheating or hubris emanating from
Los Angeles, the Trojans are not
going away.
Now. for equal time.
I saw Texas live at the Rose Bowl
in January.The Longhorns have great
ballplayers and are playing even bet
ter now than they did at the end of
last season, running up a 16-game

The Turnaround
winning streak in the process.
They are an impressive football
team with a lot of character that
seemingly does everything right and
has pounded every challenger since
mid-September.There's no reason to
believe they will undergo an OU-like
collapse in the Rose Bowl.
That being said, Texas could be in
real trouble come January. Texas
might want to make a uniform in
Bevo's size because their bull mas
cot might have to step on the field
himself if the Longhorns want a
shot.
I can imagine ways for Texas to
win;however, they all require playing
the perfect game; the Trojans are not
going to make the mistakes that
make it easy to beat them. Hell, they
could play perfect and still lose;
USC's mental focus has kicked in,
and with an October of questions
now in the rear-view mirror, this
team is at the top of its game.
Carroll's tremendous confidence
was illustrated in a gutsy Halloween
stunt early last week. Coaches staged
an argument with tailback LenDale
White, who told the team he was
quitting and left the field. Shortly
thereafter, the head coach told the
team they needed to "forget
LenDale White."
White and a coach reappeared on
top of an adjacent building, where a
dummy dressed in White's jersey was
thrown off the roof. Horror turned to
laughs as the team realized they had
been hooked.
The point: From the head coach
on down, the TYojans are never too
busy to have fun. That will keep them
winning for as long as they're huncry.

But the Irish didn't. And neither
has anyone else in 31 games, since the
Trojans blew a triple-overtime deci
sion to Cal in early 2003. Say it slowly
now: 31 college games.
Far from being an Achilles heel,
duking out the close game might be
USC's secret weapon. Last season
the Trojans needed all 60 minutes to
fight off Stanford, Cal and UCLA.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma blew through
its Big 12 schedule with abandon.
But when it came time to play for
all the oranges, USC slammed the
door with 38 first-half points, elevat
ing its game against an opponent that
was certainly not a phony. It is not dif
ficult to imagine that the team's abil
ity to play loose was boosted by
knowing it could handle any sort of
challenge.
On paper, this year's team might
not even be as good as last year's,
with the absence of defensive stal
warts and offensive genius Norm
Chow. But forget the individual sea
sons. Taken as a continuum, the Th>
jans have an indomitable formula for
winning — recruiting, coaching, BCS
money and head coach Pete Carroll's
enthusiasm. With no evidence of
cheating or hubris emanating from
Los Angeles, the Trojans are not
going away.
Now. for equal time.
I saw Texas live at the Rose Bowl
in January.The Longhorns have great
ballplayers and are playing even bet

last season, running up a 16-game

The Turnaround
winning streak in the process.
They are an impressive football
team with a lot of character that
seemingly does everything right and
has pounded every challenger since
mid-September.There's no reason to
believe they will undergo an OU-like
collapse in the Rose Bowl.
That being said, Texas could be in
real trouble come January. Texas
might want to make a uniform in
Bevo's size because their bull mas
cot might have to step on the field
himself if the Longhorns want a
shot.
I can imagine ways for Texas to
win;however, they all require playing
the perfect game; the Trojans are not
going to make the mistakes that
make it easy to beat them. Hell, they
could play perfect and still lose;
USC's mental focus has kicked in,
and with an October of questions
now in the rear-view mirror, this
team is at the top of its game.
Carroll's tremendous confidence
was illustrated in a gutsy Halloween
stunt early last week. Coaches staged
an argument with tailback LenDale
White, who told the team he was
quitting and left the field. Shortly
thereafter, the head coach told the
team they needed to "forget
LenDale White."
White and a coach reappeared on
top of an adjacent building, where a
dummy dressed in White's jersey was
thrown off the roof. Horror turned to
laughs as the team realized they had
been hooked.
The point: From the head coach
on down, the TYojans are never too
busy to have fun. That will keep them
winning for as long as they're huncry.

As I watched USC slap Stanford
silly Saturday, 1 blinked into
the dewy Los Angeles night
and took hold of the idea that I was
watching something special.
I have seen national champi
onship teams. 1 was living in Seattle
when the 1991 Washington Huskies
mowed through their championship
season. 1 got to see Michigan's im
penetrable 1997 defense — one of
the best in decades —in person. 1
also saw Miami live in 2001, when it
won the national title.
If the Trojans hold on to win their
third straight title, they deserve to be
discussed in the same sentences as
those.
Let me disclaim that 1 have no ties
to USC. I have spend most of my days
rooting for teams that often butt
heads with the Trojans, such as Michi
gan, Stanford and Washington State.
1 am the last person one would ex
pect to suck up to Southern Califor
nia. And I resisted it — at least until
this weekend.
But I am also a journalist (and
also not stupid), and to put it simply,
the hype is for real. I will spare the su
perlatives — USC is a great team.
The pure dominance was expressed
by KZSU play-by-play man Andy
Aymeloglu: "Folks, there IS a profes
sional football team in Los Angeles."
Still, the TVojans are not without
their doubters.
Critics point to closer-than-ex
pected games against the Arizona
schools, where USC needed fourth
quarter surges to seal victory. They
say Notre Dame was one play away
from winning and should have beat
en the Trojans. Notre Dame certainly
could have.
