## Logar falls short of title at Indoor 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's Theresa Logar has
found herself entangled in a whirl
wind series of close calls and final
upsets in recent weeks. At the ITA
National Intercollegiate Indoor
Tennis Championships this past
weekend, the stage was set for the
junior to take her opponents by
storm on the fast-paced courts in
Columbus.
Logar grew up playing on
cramped indoor courts, and the ex
perience figured to assist the
Rochester Hills, Mich, native. But
just as the Indoor tournament
changed venues this year, moving
from Michigan to the Ohio State

endorsed Racquet Club, the hearty
Midwesterner was displaced just
enough to let the 2005 Indoor title
slip through her grasp.
Florida's Diana Srebovic broke
Logar's serve to clinch Sunday's
final in straight sets, 7-5,6-4.
"It was a good match but the
outcome wasn't what I wanted,"
Logar said. "[Diana] played really
well and stepped up her game
when she needed to."
The results at Indoor resonated
with those at the ITA Northwest
Regional Championships, which
Stanford hosted two weeks earlier.
Logar broke through to the Oct. 24
final without dropping a single set
only to stumble against Califor
nia's Suzi Fodor, 1-6,6-2,6-1.

Logar. the tournament's eighth
seed, refused to resign herself to
any disappointment over finishing
runner-up.
"I would have liked to have won
those matches hut it didn't end up
happening," Logar said. "I fought
really hard to get to the finals. I just
have to keep working to fix the er
rors I made in the match."
Logar, 8-2 after just five weeks
of play, survived two three-setters
en route to Sunday's final.
No. 8 Kristi Miller of Georgia
Tech gave the Cardinal a run for
their money at Indoor. Miller dis
patched Stanford's Anne Yelsey in
the first round before Logar
