## Logar falls short of title at Indoor 
### MIA LEE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's Theresa Logar has
found herself entangled in a whirl
wind series of close calls and final
upsets in recent weeks. At the ITA
National Intercollegiate Indoor
Tennis Championships this past
weekend, the stage was set for the
junior to take her opponents by
storm on the fast-paced courts in
Columbus.
Logar grew up playing on
cramped indoor courts, and the ex
perience figured to assist the
Rochester Hills, Mich, native. But
just as the Indoor tournament
changed venues this year, moving
from Michigan to the Ohio State

endorsed Racquet Club, the hearty
Midwesterner was displaced just
enough to let the 2005 Indoor title
slip through her grasp.
Florida's Diana Srebovic broke
Logar's serve to clinch Sunday's
final in straight sets, 7-5,6-4.
"It was a good match but the
outcome wasn't what I wanted,"
Logar said. "[Diana] played really
well and stepped up her game
when she needed to."
The results at Indoor resonated
with those at the ITA Northwest
Regional Championships, which
Stanford hosted two weeks earlier.
Logar broke through to the Oct. 24
final without dropping a single set
only to stumble against Califor
nia's Suzi Fodor, 1-6,6-2,6-1.

Logar. the tournament's eighth
seed, refused to resign herself to
any disappointment over finishing
runner-up.
"I would have liked to have won
those matches hut it didn't end up
happening," Logar said. "I fought
really hard to get to the finals. I just
have to keep working to fix the er
rors I made in the match."
Logar, 8-2 after just five weeks
of play, survived two three-setters
en route to Sunday's final.
No. 8 Kristi Miller of Georgia
Tech gave the Cardinal a run for
their money at Indoor. Miller dis
patched Stanford's Anne Yelsey in
the first round before Logar
stopped her in the semifinals, 6-7 (5), 6-2,6-1.
No. 13 Logar opened Indoor play with a
drawn-out decision of her own, taking three
sets to overcome Southern California's Anca
Anastasiu, 6-1,4-6,6-1. Logar considered her
self fortunate to already be acclimated to the
speed of indoor courts, acknowledging that she
wasn't alone in navigating the hemmed-in
struggle.
"1 played on the surface seven months out
of the year," Logar said. "I felt it catered to my
game better — the ball bounces and gets to the
opponent faster. But it also helped my [final]
opponent. She's kind of a [baseline] banger the
way I am, and you have to be prepared a lot
earlier."
Yelsey and doubles partner Alice Barnes
overcame this obstacle to take top doubles
honors at indoor.
No. 6 Barnes and Yelsey (8-2) claimed their
second career title as they downed the No. 16
North Carolina duo of Jenna Long and Sara
Anundsen,B-5.
"We were a little bit nervous at the start, and
twice we were a break down," Barnes said. "We
weren't playing badly [at that time] — they just
got in a couple of good points. We got a little bit
more aggressive at the midway point."
Barnes, whose team was unseeded in the
doubles event, is pleased that she and Yelsey
got to square off against a new opponent.
"Sometimes you face a Pac-10 player and it
can seem like kind of a
waste of a trip," she said.
While Barnes, Yelsey and Logar headed to
the Buckeye State for their competition, soph
omores Whitney Deason and Celia Durkin
competed in the Arizona State Thunderbird In
vitational.
Deason clinched three consolation singles
matches, including a 6-2, 6-0 win over Michi
gan's Lindsay Howard.
In doubles, Deason and Durkin (2-1) played
their first matches together in the team's quest
to find new doubles pairings for the season.The
tandem dropped its first match to Arizona
State but bounded back with a 9-7 upset of
Michigan's Kara Delicata and Elizabeth Exon
in the consolation bracket.
Stanford plans to spend the next couple of
weeks in intensive training. The team extends
its court hiatus until Nov. 22. when it travels to
Hawaii fora weeklong invitational match.
"This is a time when you can put in a lot of
good work physically," Barnes said. "We're
going to make sure everyone works very hard
for NCAA's in May."
