# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Swimming gears up for Cal scrimmage 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a precursor to the intense rivalry of Big
Game week, the men's swim and diving team
is scheduled to face California in a triple-dis
tance exhibition this Wednesday at Avery
Aquatic Center. Meant more as a rally for Big
Game spirit than an actual meet, the compe
tition should provide both teams with some
experience.
"This meet is more about creating some
Big Game excitement, some Big Game spirit
between the two schools," said assistant coach
Ted Knapp. "It's not meant as a do-or-die
competition. We'll get up on the blocks and
race well, but there's no preparation going
into this meet."
Instead, the meet acts as a preparation for
a Feb. 18,20()6 dual meet. After losing for the
first time since 1991 to Cal this past Febru
ary, the men's swimming and diving team fig
ures to be excited about the opportunity for
revenge.
This time around, however, the squad's
Wednesday meet against Cal is likely to be
similar to its easy victory over Washington a
few weeks ago, in that freshmen have ample
opportunity to gain experience.
"As with all other preseason meets, we are
looking to sharpen our skills and learn from
our races," junior Ben Wildman-Tobriner
said. "Likewise, despite the fact that this is a
preseason meet, we always like the chance to
race against our rivals and the fast competi
tion that they bring."
Indeed, Cal does represent strong compe
tition. Ranked No. 6 in the country, the team
placed second to Stanford in last year's Pacif
ic-10 Conference Championships and fourth
in the NCAA Championships.
"Thev have a very good team with talent-

Ed swimmers in all strokes," Knapp said. "I
think that every event, every swim is going to
have some good match ups."
The men also got a sense of the Golden
Bears from their performance in the Pacific
Tiger Invitational Oct. 28 and 29. There, Cal
finished first, followed by USC. Stanford was
third but only competed in the second day.
Cal swimmers placed higher than Stanford's
in six of 10 events on the day.
In particular, Wildman-Tobriner's 45.91
seconds placed him third to Cal's Jonas Tilly
and William Copeland in the 100-yard
freestyle. In last February's dual meet, Wild
man-Tobriner placed second in the 100 free
with a time of 43.18 and third (19.52 seconds)
in the 50 free.
"Personally, I am looking to go faster at

this | Wednesday's] meet than 1 did the year
before," he said. "Scrutinizing my times and
results at this point in the year is not as im
portant as making sure 1 am progressing to
wards my year-end goals, so 1 am simply
looking to have some races that 1 can feel
good about."
In a triple-distance meet such as the
Wednesday event, swimmers compete in
their individual categories. Their total time
from racing three distances in that category
determines their place.
"This isn't so much about times or winning
races," Knapp said."But Wednesday, when we
get up on the blocks, we'll put forth a great
racing attitude."
The men's next competition is the Speedo
Cup in Long Beach, Calif., Nov. 17-19.
