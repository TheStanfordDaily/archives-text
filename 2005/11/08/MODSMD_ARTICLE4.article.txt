# ASSU recognizes student groups
## MSAN named student group of the year 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Oak Lounge in the Tressider
Student Union was filled nearly to ca
pacity yesterday evening by student
leaders for the 2(X)5 Student Volun
teer Organizations (VSO) Collabora
tion Dinner. ITie meeting served as a
multipurpose event at which awards
were given, new policies were un
veiled and many questions were an
swered.
"The purpose of this event tonight
is threefold." began ASSU President
Melanie kannokada, a senior, as she
spoke last night. "We want to recog
nize all of you. provide an opportunity
for networking between student lead
ers and encourage collaboration be
tween different student groups on
campus."
She was followed by an illuminat
ing personal history from the Associ

ate Vice Provost for Student Affairs
and Dean of Students Greg Board
man who went on to thank the stu
dents involved in the organizations.
"You have advanced student re
sources and strengthened the commu
nity on campus," Boardman said. "We
can work together to create an atmos
phere that stimulates the student body
intellectually."
The highlight of the evening was
the awarding of the VSO of the Year
plaque for the 2(X)4-2(X)5 academic
year. This year the honor was be
stowed upon the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN). The
organization's president, Omar
Shakir, a junior, accepted the award.
"If you'd have told me a year ago
that I would be standing here accept
ing this award, I'd have told you you
were crazy," Shakir said. "We have
grown from a group of eight that used
to meet in Wilbur to a group that has a
mailing list of more than S(X) people."
Shakir also acknowledged the con
troversial nature of his organization.
"Don't be afraid to generate dia

logue," he said. "I think over the
course of the past year we've angered
basically every student group on cam
pus, at one point even a campus news
paper called for our charter to be re
voked."
When asked if MSAN was going to
attempt a repeat, Shakir was opti
mistic.
"We'll try, but it's hard you know,"
he said. "It's like winning the Super
Bowl two years in a row, there are a lot
of expectations. It's not about the
award, it's about raising awareness for
our issues."
Junior Faris Mohiuddin.the appro
priations chair for the ASSU, ad
dressed the crowd about the new
funding policies going into effect this
year.
"The ASSU has been overspend
ing fora number of years now," Mohi
uddin said. "This year there will be a
significant amount of belt-tightening.
It will make your organizations more
productive, self-sufficient and ulti
mately more effective."
The ASSU is trying to avoid the re

curring problem of running out of
money well before June, even if that
means raising fees for clubs and cut
ting funding, Mohiuddin said.
To counteract the across-the
board belt-tightening, the student
government announced a new plan
called the VSO Collaboration Initia
tive. With the new program, if two
groups choose to join forces, they are
eligible for their ASSU funds to be
matched by Boardman's Office.
"We want to start encouraging you
guys to talk to each other and work to
gether," said ASSU Executive Cabi
net member Lauren Graham, a junior,
who pitched the new program. "Be
tween your money, the other group's
money and our money, there will be
substantial funds."
As the students finished their din
ners of pasta, garlic bread and cookies
on tables bedecked with red and white
balloons, many began to head out into
the darkening November evening.
"We're going to keep doing what
we're doing," Shakir said, "and if the
awards come, so be it."

called the VSO Collaboration Initia
tive. With the new program, if two
groups choose to join forces, they are
eligible for their ASSU funds to be
matched by Boardman's Office.
"We want to start encouraging you
guys to talk to each other and work to
gether," said ASSU Executive Cabi
net member Lauren Graham, a junior,
who pitched the new program. "Be
tween your money, the other group's
money and our money, there will be
substantial funds."
As the students finished their din
ners of pasta, garlic bread and cookies
on tables bedecked with red and white
balloons, many began to head out into
the darkening November evening.
"We're going to keep doing what
we're doing," Shakir said, "and if the
awards come, so be it."

Junior Faris Ali Mohiuddin speaks to student groups at the VSO event in Tressider Union last night.
The Oak Lounge in the Tressider
Student Union was filled nearly to ca
pacity yesterday evening by student
leaders for the 2(X)5 Student Volun
teer Organizations (VSO) Collabora
tion Dinner. ITie meeting served as a
multipurpose event at which awards
were given, new policies were un
veiled and many questions were an
swered.
"The purpose of this event tonight
is threefold." began ASSU President
Melanie kannokada, a senior, as she
spoke last night. "We want to recog
nize all of you. provide an opportunity
for networking between student lead
ers and encourage collaboration be
tween different student groups on
campus."
She was followed by an illuminat
ing personal history from the Associ

ate Vice Provost for Student Affairs
and Dean of Students Greg Board
man who went on to thank the stu
dents involved in the organizations.
"You have advanced student re
sources and strengthened the commu
nity on campus," Boardman said. "We
can work together to create an atmos
phere that stimulates the student body
intellectually."
The highlight of the evening was
the awarding of the VSO of the Year
plaque for the 2(X)4-2(X)5 academic
year. This year the honor was be
stowed upon the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN). The
organization's president, Omar
Shakir, a junior, accepted the award.
"If you'd have told me a year ago
that I would be standing here accept
ing this award, I'd have told you you
were crazy," Shakir said. "We have
grown from a group of eight that used
to meet in Wilbur to a group that has a
mailing list of more than S(X) people."
Shakir also acknowledged the con
troversial nature of his organization.
"Don't be afraid to generate dia

logue," he said. "I think over the
course of the past year we've angered
basically every student group on cam
pus, at one point even a campus news
paper called for our charter to be re
voked."
When asked if MSAN was going to
attempt a repeat, Shakir was opti
mistic.
"We'll try, but it's hard you know,"
he said. "It's like winning the Super
Bowl two years in a row, there are a lot
of expectations. It's not about the
award, it's about raising awareness for
our issues."
Junior Faris Mohiuddin.the appro
priations chair for the ASSU, ad
dressed the crowd about the new
funding policies going into effect this
year.
"The ASSU has been overspend
ing fora number of years now," Mohi
uddin said. "This year there will be a
significant amount of belt-tightening.
It will make your organizations more
productive, self-sufficient and ulti
mately more effective."
The ASSU is trying to avoid the re

curring problem of running out of
money well before June, even if that
means raising fees for clubs and cut
ting funding, Mohiuddin said.
To counteract the across-the
board belt-tightening, the student
government announced a new plan
called the VSO Collaboration Initia
tive. With the new program, if two
groups choose to join forces, they are
eligible for their ASSU funds to be
matched by Boardman's Office.
"We want to start encouraging you
guys to talk to each other and work to
gether," said ASSU Executive Cabi
net member Lauren Graham, a junior,
who pitched the new program. "Be
tween your money, the other group's
money and our money, there will be
substantial funds."
As the students finished their din
ners of pasta, garlic bread and cookies
on tables bedecked with red and white
balloons, many began to head out into
the darkening November evening.
"We're going to keep doing what
we're doing," Shakir said, "and if the
awards come, so be it."
