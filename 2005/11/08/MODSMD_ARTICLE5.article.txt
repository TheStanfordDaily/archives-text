# SPECIAL EVENT
## Solutions to Katrina disaster pitched Failures of Katrina response debated, explained by faculty members 
### JAMES HOHMANN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of Stanford faculty discussed how government
and private organizations failed the people they were sup
posed to protect from Hurricane Katrina and explored ways
they could be made more effective. Four professors partici
pated in the third panel of a four-part series sponsored by
the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
(CSRE) at Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Before the backdrop of a slide show with pictures of the
Katrina tragedy and the relief effort, the director of the cen
ter implored the audience to learn from the disaster.
"Katrina impelled us to think about and to see the deep
problems rooted in the social fabric," said Lawrence Bobo,
director of the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity.
While stating that this event was motivated by the New
Orleans tragedy, Bobo urged the panelists not to dwell on the
one specific disaster but to talk about how to deal with still
present underlying problems.
The moderator began the event with an opening state

ment that included a harsh rebuke of President George W.
Bush and his administration for making special tax exemp
tions and awarding no-hid contracts to corporations like Hal
liburton in the aftermath of the tragedy.
"New Orleans could be considered a third-world coun
try," said Comparative Literature F'rof. David Palumbo-Liu,
highlighting the city's impoverished conditions. "Bush and
the GOP Congress drastically cut the budget for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FE-MA).the Army Corps
of Engineers and other projects for New Orleans.. This gov-

Orleans...This government has si
phoned public resources into the un
common good."
Each of the three panelists spoke
for 15 minutes about a different as
pect of Katrina and then answered
questions at the end of the event.
The first panelist explored the
government's obligation to protect
its people from natural disasters.
Using the example of famine, Philos
ophy Prof. Debra Satz explored dis
tinction between misfortune and in
justice.
"Society's institutions caused or
exacerbated Katrina from a natural
disaster to a human injustice," she
said. "Government inaction harmed
the population."
The second panelist explained
why FEM A failed as an organization
to prepare for and respond to Katri
na. Political Science Prof. David
Brady of the Graduate School of
Business explained that FEMA was
not set up to be a first responder, but
to be a flood insurer. To get away
from the charged politics of Hurri
cane Katrina, Brady focused on the
1993 Great Flood on the Mississippi
River as an example to illustrate his
points.
He noted that the federal govern
ment usually reacts after a disaster
by over appropriating funds for re
covery efforts. As a result, he said,
state and local governments do not
feel a pressing need to invest in
preparations for natural disasters.
"Congress and the president use
FEMA to distribute and redistribute
pork to ensure their re-election," he
said, pointing to high incumbent re
election rates as a result.
The third panelist discussed the
role of altruism in the public's re
sponse to social needs. Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode, director of the
Center on Ethics, examined people's
varying motivations for giving, bene
fits of altruism, influences on chari
table behavior and options for in

creasing people's sense of compas
sion.
"[Hurricane Katrina's] exposure
of racial apartheid has mobilized ef
forts that will focus on the have
nots," she said. "We want to nurture
the altruistic instinct because over
the long run, it is more likely to pro
mote public service."
Rhode said that private and gov
ernment donations for Hurricane
Katrina are at an all-time high. Near
ly $2 billion of private money has
been donated, and the stream has
not ended. She noted that domestic
disasters receive far more attention
and money than disasters in Africa
or the Indian subcontinent.
Organizers estimated that 250 to
3(X) people turned out for the event.
Freshman Haley Minick attended
the lecture as part of the CSRE 51
lecture course "Confronting Katri
na," which gives students the oppor
tunity to earn credit for attending
the discussions. She called the third
panel the most interesting so far in
the series.
"I really liked that they talked
about more solution-oriented activi
ties and how to get the public moti
vated to help," she said. "This session
delved really well into the role the
public can play to prevent and deal
with these kinds of disasters."
Some said they are glad that the
series has generated such a large
turnout.
"It's a gift to the community to be
able to have this kind of conversa
tion," said Laura Selznick, special as
sistant to the vice provost of under
graduate education."This gives a
window into new ways of doing
things. I think it was a real treat that
the whole community was invited,
not just students."
The fourth and final panel in the
series will be held on Nov. 28 from 7-
9 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium. Provost
John Etchemendy will preside, and
CNN White House Correspondent
Suzanne Malveaux will deliver a
keynote address. The Dean of the
Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University will come to
Stanford to participate in the panel
on "Lessons from Katrina."

sistant to the vice provost of under
graduate education."This gives a
window into new ways of doing
things. I think it was a real treat that
the whole community was invited,
not just students."
The fourth and final panel in the
series will be held on Nov. 28 from 7-
9 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium. Provost
John Etchemendy will preside, and
CNN White House Correspondent
Suzanne Malveaux will deliver a
keynote address. The Dean of the
Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University will come to
Stanford to participate in the panel
on "Lessons from Katrina."
A panel of Stanford faculty discussed how government
and private organizations failed the people they were sup
posed to protect from Hurricane Katrina and explored ways
they could be made more effective. Four professors partici
pated in the third panel of a four-part series sponsored by
the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity
(CSRE) at Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Before the backdrop of a slide show with pictures of the
Katrina tragedy and the relief effort, the director of the cen
ter implored the audience to learn from the disaster.
"Katrina impelled us to think about and to see the deep
problems rooted in the social fabric," said Lawrence Bobo,
director of the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity.
While stating that this event was motivated by the New
Orleans tragedy, Bobo urged the panelists not to dwell on the
one specific disaster but to talk about how to deal with still
present underlying problems.
The moderator began the event with an opening state

ment that included a harsh rebuke of President George W.
Bush and his administration for making special tax exemp
tions and awarding no-hid contracts to corporations like Hal
liburton in the aftermath of the tragedy.
"New Orleans could be considered a third-world coun
try," said Comparative Literature F'rof. David Palumbo-Liu,
highlighting the city's impoverished conditions. "Bush and
the GOP Congress drastically cut the budget for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FE-MA).the Army Corps
of Engineers and other projects for New Orleans.. This gov-

aster at the "Confronting Katrina" discussion yesterday in Cubberly Auditorium.
Orleans...This government has si
phoned public resources into the un
common good."
Each of the three panelists spoke
for 15 minutes about a different as
pect of Katrina and then answered
questions at the end of the event.
The first panelist explored the
government's obligation to protect
its people from natural disasters.
Using the example of famine, Philos
ophy Prof. Debra Satz explored dis
tinction between misfortune and in
justice.
"Society's institutions caused or
exacerbated Katrina from a natural
disaster to a human injustice," she
said. "Government inaction harmed
the population."
The second panelist explained
why FEM A failed as an organization
to prepare for and respond to Katri
na. Political Science Prof. David
Brady of the Graduate School of
Business explained that FEMA was
not set up to be a first responder, but
to be a flood insurer. To get away
from the charged politics of Hurri
cane Katrina, Brady focused on the
1993 Great Flood on the Mississippi
River as an example to illustrate his
points.
He noted that the federal govern
ment usually reacts after a disaster
by over appropriating funds for re
covery efforts. As a result, he said,
state and local governments do not
feel a pressing need to invest in
preparations for natural disasters.
"Congress and the president use
FEMA to distribute and redistribute
pork to ensure their re-election," he
said, pointing to high incumbent re
election rates as a result.
The third panelist discussed the
role of altruism in the public's re
sponse to social needs. Law Prof.
Deborah Rhode, director of the
Center on Ethics, examined people's
varying motivations for giving, bene
fits of altruism, influences on chari
table behavior and options for in

creasing people's sense of compas
sion.
"[Hurricane Katrina's] exposure
of racial apartheid has mobilized ef
forts that will focus on the have
nots," she said. "We want to nurture
the altruistic instinct because over
the long run, it is more likely to pro
mote public service."
Rhode said that private and gov
ernment donations for Hurricane
Katrina are at an all-time high. Near
ly $2 billion of private money has
been donated, and the stream has
not ended. She noted that domestic
disasters receive far more attention
and money than disasters in Africa
or the Indian subcontinent.
Organizers estimated that 250 to
3(X) people turned out for the event.
Freshman Haley Minick attended
the lecture as part of the CSRE 51
lecture course "Confronting Katri
na," which gives students the oppor
tunity to earn credit for attending
the discussions. She called the third
panel the most interesting so far in
the series.
"I really liked that they talked
about more solution-oriented activi
ties and how to get the public moti
vated to help," she said. "This session
delved really well into the role the
public can play to prevent and deal
with these kinds of disasters."
Some said they are glad that the
series has generated such a large
turnout.
"It's a gift to the community to be
able to have this kind of conversa
tion," said Laura Selznick, special as
sistant to the vice provost of under
graduate education."This gives a
