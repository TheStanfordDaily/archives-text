## Riots in France continue to rage 
### ANGELA DOLAND ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PARIS (AP) — Rioting by French youths spread to
300 towns overnight and a 61-year-old man hurt in the vi
olence died of his wounds, the first fatality in 11 days of
unrest that has shocked the country, police said yesterday.
As urban unrest was reported in neighboring Belgium
and Germany, the French government faced growing
criticism for its inability to stop the violence, despite mas
sive police deployment and continued calls for calm. One
riot-hit town in suburban Paris said it was preparing to
enforce a curfew.
Governments worldwide urged their citizens to be
careful in France.
President Jacques Chirac, in private comments more
conciliatory than his warnings Sunday that rioters would
be caught and punished, acknowledged that
France has failed to integrate the French-born children
of Arab and black African immigrants in poor suburbs
who have been participating in the violence, according to
Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga, who met with
the French leader on Monday.
She said Chirac "deplored the fact that in these neigh
borhoods there is a ghettoization of youths of African or
North African origin" and recognized "the incapacity of
French society to fully accept them."
Chirac said unemployment runs as high as 40 percent
in some suburban neighborhoods, four times the nation
al rate of just under 10 percent, Vike-Freiberga said.
On Sunday night, vandals burned more than 1,400 ve
hicles, and clashes around the country left 36 police in
jured, setting a new high for overnight arson and violence
since rioting started last month, national policc chief
Michel Gaudin told a news conference.
Attacks overnight Sunday to Monday were reported in
274 towns and police made 395 arrests, Gaudin said. The
Justice Ministry said Monday that 27 people had been con
victed in fast-track trials since the beginning of the unrest.
Australia, Britain, Germany and Japan advised their
citizens to exercise care in France, joining the United
States, Russia and at least a half dozen other countries in
warning tourists to stay away from violence-hit areas.
French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy
sought to reassure his European counterparts about vis
iting his country, telling them at a meeting in Brussels
that "France is not a dangerous country. France is still a
country where one can go."

The victim was identified as Jean-Jacques Le
Chenadec, a retired auto industry worker who died after
being beaten by an attacker. He was trying to extinguish
a trash can fire Friday at his housing project in the north
eastern suburb of Stains when an attacker caught him by
surprise and beat him into a coma, police said.
In the Paris suburban town of Raincy, the mayor was
preparing to enact a nighttime curfew expected to go into
force Monday or TUesday, said one of his top aides.
Apparent copycat attacks spread outside France for
the first time, with five cars torched outside Brussels'
main train station, police in the Belgian capital said.
German police were investigating whether the
overnight burning of five cars early Monday in Moabit.a
Berlin neighborhood with a large TUrkish immigrant
population, was a copycat crime.
The mayhem started as an outburst of anger in subur
ban Paris housing projects and has fanned out nation
wide among disaffected youths, mostly of Muslim or
African origin, to become France's worst civil unrest in
more than a decade.
"This spread, with a sort of shock wave spreading

across the country, shows up in the number of towns af
fected," Gaudin said, noting that the violence appeared
to be sliding away from its flash point in the Parisian sub
urbs and worsening elsewhere.
It was the first time police had been injured by
weapons' fire and there were signs that rioters were de
liberately seeking out clashes with police, officials said.
Among the injured police, 10 were hurt by youths fir
ing fine-grain birdshot in a late-night clash in the south
ern Paris suburb of Grigny, national police spokesman
Patrick Hamon said. Two were hospitalized, but the in
juries were not considered life-threatening. One was
wounded in the neck, the other in the legs.
The unrest began Oct. 27 in the low-income Paris sub
urb of Clichy-sous-Bois after the deaths of two teenagers
of Mauritanian and Tunisian origin. The youths were ac
cidentally electrocuted as they hid from police in a power
substation. They apparently thought they were being
chased.
About 4,700 cars have been burned in France since
the rioting began and 1.200 suspects were detained at
least temporarily, Gaudin said.

PARIS (AP) — Rioting by French youths spread to
300 towns overnight and a 61-year-old man hurt in the vi
olence died of his wounds, the first fatality in 11 days of
unrest that has shocked the country, police said yesterday.
As urban unrest was reported in neighboring Belgium
and Germany, the French government faced growing
criticism for its inability to stop the violence, despite mas
sive police deployment and continued calls for calm. One
riot-hit town in suburban Paris said it was preparing to
enforce a curfew.
Governments worldwide urged their citizens to be
careful in France.
President Jacques Chirac, in private comments more
conciliatory than his warnings Sunday that rioters would
be caught and punished, acknowledged that
France has failed to integrate the French-born children
of Arab and black African immigrants in poor suburbs
who have been participating in the violence, according to
Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga, who met with
the French leader on Monday.
She said Chirac "deplored the fact that in these neigh
borhoods there is a ghettoization of youths of African or
North African origin" and recognized "the incapacity of
French society to fully accept them."
Chirac said unemployment runs as high as 40 percent
in some suburban neighborhoods, four times the nation
al rate of just under 10 percent, Vike-Freiberga said.
On Sunday night, vandals burned more than 1,400 ve
hicles, and clashes around the country left 36 police in
jured, setting a new high for overnight arson and violence
since rioting started last month, national policc chief
Michel Gaudin told a news conference.
Attacks overnight Sunday to Monday were reported in
274 towns and police made 395 arrests, Gaudin said. The
Justice Ministry said Monday that 27 people had been con
victed in fast-track trials since the beginning of the unrest.
Australia, Britain, Germany and Japan advised their
citizens to exercise care in France, joining the United
States, Russia and at least a half dozen other countries in
warning tourists to stay away from violence-hit areas.
French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy
sought to reassure his European counterparts about vis
iting his country, telling them at a meeting in Brussels
that "France is not a dangerous country. France is still a
country where one can go."

The victim was identified as Jean-Jacques Le
Chenadec, a retired auto industry worker who died after
being beaten by an attacker. He was trying to extinguish
a trash can fire Friday at his housing project in the north
eastern suburb of Stains when an attacker caught him by
surprise and beat him into a coma, police said.
In the Paris suburban town of Raincy, the mayor was
preparing to enact a nighttime curfew expected to go into
force Monday or TUesday, said one of his top aides.
Apparent copycat attacks spread outside France for
the first time, with five cars torched outside Brussels'
main train station, police in the Belgian capital said.
German police were investigating whether the
overnight burning of five cars early Monday in Moabit.a
Berlin neighborhood with a large TUrkish immigrant
population, was a copycat crime.
The mayhem started as an outburst of anger in subur
ban Paris housing projects and has fanned out nation
wide among disaffected youths, mostly of Muslim or
African origin, to become France's worst civil unrest in
more than a decade.
"This spread, with a sort of shock wave spreading

across the country, shows up in the number of towns af
fected," Gaudin said, noting that the violence appeared
to be sliding away from its flash point in the Parisian sub
urbs and worsening elsewhere.
It was the first time police had been injured by
weapons' fire and there were signs that rioters were de
liberately seeking out clashes with police, officials said.
Among the injured police, 10 were hurt by youths fir
ing fine-grain birdshot in a late-night clash in the south
ern Paris suburb of Grigny, national police spokesman
Patrick Hamon said. Two were hospitalized, but the in
juries were not considered life-threatening. One was
wounded in the neck, the other in the legs.
The unrest began Oct. 27 in the low-income Paris sub
urb of Clichy-sous-Bois after the deaths of two teenagers
of Mauritanian and Tunisian origin. The youths were ac
cidentally electrocuted as they hid from police in a power
substation. They apparently thought they were being
chased.
About 4,700 cars have been burned in France since
the rioting began and 1.200 suspects were detained at
least temporarily, Gaudin said.
