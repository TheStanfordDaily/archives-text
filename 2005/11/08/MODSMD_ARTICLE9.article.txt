INDIA-PAKISTAN LINE OF CONTROL (AP) â€”
Pakistani police fired tear gas to disperse Kashmiri vil
lagers trying to cross into Indian territory illegally, mar
ring an unprecedented frontier ceremony by the South
Asian nuclear rivals to exchange earthquake aid.
U.N. agencies announced a shortfall of $42.4 million
for relief aid in the month of November, warning the
death toll could surge as the onset of the bitter Hi
malayan winter cuts off communities.
Several hundred protesters gathered on the Pakistan
side of the Punch Valley in disputed Kashmir, frustrated
by a delay in plans to let civilians cross the frontier as
part of relief efforts. Nobody was reported hurt, but au
thorities arrested at least two men carrying young boys
who made a dash to the Indian side of the region.
"We want a free Kashmir and we want to travel
freely," said Mohammed Saffir Abbasi, a 57-year-old re
tired Pakistani army soldier, as he wiped his eyes that
were watering from the tear gas that wafted across the
fields, just 2(X) yards from the Line of Control.
The trouble broke out less than an hour after Indian
and Pakistani officials shook hands across a length of
white tape run across a ceremonial dirt square. India
then started handing over 25 truckloads of tents, blan
kets, food and medicine, while Pakistan sent one truck
of relief goods to India.
"Some enthusiasts tried to cross. It's a military zone
and we fired tear gas as we didn't want anyone to lose a
limb," Pakistani army Brig. Tahir Naqvi, the area com
mander. said. He added that while the area had been
cleared of land mines,"you don't want to take chances."
Some gunfire rang out, possibly warning shots,
though police denied they had fired anything but tear
gas canisters.
Earlier, India began handing over tents, food and
medicine to Pakistan as part of a much-heralded partial
opening of their frontier, following the region's devas
tating Oct. 8 earthquake.
Naqvi shook hands with Indian Brig. A-.K. Bukshi
across a white line at the crossing and they declared it
open for aid exchanges.
