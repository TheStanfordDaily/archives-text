UCLA
(8-1,5-1 Pac-10)
Arizona scored touchdowns on its first four
possessions to spoil UCLA's perfect season.
In between ground touchdowns from Wild
cat rushers Michael Bell and Gilbert Harris, fresh
man quarterback Willie T\iitama threw for two early
strikes, and Arizona led 28-0 less than five minutes
into the second quarter.
Though UCLA had come back to win four Pac-10
contests this season after trailing by double digits,
Arizona scored another two straight touchdowns to
start the second half and cruised from that 45-7 lead
to the 52-14 final margin.
UCLA's ground defense, which had been porous all
season, yielded to Arizona 318 yards on 8.5 yards per at
tempt. Bell and Harris each scored a touchdown and
topped 100 yards, andTiutama threw for 204 yards and
two scores on the day. A smothering Wildcat defense al
lowed Bruin tailback Maurice Drew only 64 total yards,
though tight end Marcedes Lewis did explode for 128
receiving yards and two scores in the losing effort.

The homestanding Ducks leapt into a tie with
UCLA for second place in the Pac-10 and took
a giant step towards a potential at-large BCS
berth in a game in which they never trailed.
With starting quarterback Kellen Clemens side
lined for the season with a broken ankle and backup
Dennis Dixon ineffective, Oregon turned to third
stringer Brady Leaf, a sophomore who had complet

inexperience, however, Leaf was magnificent in re

Meanwhile, lackluster quarterbacking did in Cal

the first time in three years. Halloween came late for
Cal signal-caller Joseph Ayoob, whose stat line ap
peared to have come out of a B-horror flick: 10-of-26
for 88 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions.
Ayoob and the Bears converted only two of 13 third

In a contest with 1,064 total yards and 56 first

its defense. While two third-quarter touchdowns
rallied Washington State from a 27-10 halftime
deficit, the Sun Devils held the Cougars scoreless
over the final 18-plus minutes to eke out a narrow
road victory.
After replacing Sam Keller in the 45-35 loss to
Stanford, Sun Devil signal-caller Rudy Carpenter has
been on fire, and Saturday's contest was no excep

67 percent of his passes for 373 yards and two scores.
Meanwhile, Cougar tailback Jerome Harrison
solidified his standing as one of the country's most
underrated rushers. Harrison rumbled for 237 yards
and two touchdowns on Saturday, and the senior has
rushed for more than 100 yards in every contest this
season.The Kalamazoo, Mich., native currently has

Oregon State kicker Alexis Serna connected on
all six of his field goal attempts, and 10 fourth

the Huskies, who are only two losses away from their
second-straight one-win season.
Oregon State struggled offensively, notching only
275 total yards and converting just 5-of-18 third
downs. However, tailback Yvenson Bernard's 132
rushing yards, coupled with Serna's right leg, proved

enough for the Beavers, who must win either this
week versus Stanford or next week at nationally
ranked Oregon to become bowl-eligible.
Washington's offense continued to struggle. De
spite rushing 22 times, the Huskies netted only 15
ground yards, and quarterback Isaiah Stanback was
benched at halftime for futility. Furthermore, the
Huskies' only touchdown came with 56 seconds re
maining and the game already out of reach.

NO. 7
UCLA
(8-1,5-1 Pac-10)
Arizona scored touchdowns on its first four
possessions to spoil UCLA's perfect season.
In between ground touchdowns from Wild
cat rushers Michael Bell and Gilbert Harris, fresh
man quarterback Willie T\iitama threw for two early
strikes, and Arizona led 28-0 less than five minutes
into the second quarter.
Though UCLA had come back to win four Pac-10
contests this season after trailing by double digits,
Arizona scored another two straight touchdowns to
start the second half and cruised from that 45-7 lead
to the 52-14 final margin.
UCLA's ground defense, which had been porous all
season, yielded to Arizona 318 yards on 8.5 yards per at
tempt. Bell and Harris each scored a touchdown and
topped 100 yards, andTiutama threw for 204 yards and
two scores on the day. A smothering Wildcat defense al
lowed Bruin tailback Maurice Drew only 64 total yards,
though tight end Marcedes Lewis did explode for 128
receiving yards and two scores in the losing effort.

The homestanding Ducks leapt into a tie with
UCLA for second place in the Pac-10 and took
a giant step towards a potential at-large BCS
berth in a game in which they never trailed.
With starting quarterback Kellen Clemens side
lined for the season with a broken ankle and backup
Dennis Dixon ineffective, Oregon turned to third
stringer Brady Leaf, a sophomore who had complet
ed only eight passes before the contest. Despite his
inexperience, however, Leaf was magnificent in re
lief, completing nine of 13 passes for 93 yards, includ
ing the game-winning four-yard touchdown strike to
NO. 23
CAL
(6-3,3-3 Pac-10)
James Finley in overtime.
Meanwhile, lackluster quarterbacking did in Cal
ifornia, and the Bears dropped out of the Top 25 for
the first time in three years. Halloween came late for
Cal signal-caller Joseph Ayoob, whose stat line ap
peared to have come out of a B-horror flick: 10-of-26
for 88 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions.
Ayoob and the Bears converted only two of 13 third
downs and were held scoreless after the third quar
ter. Bear tailback Marshawn Lynch was the sole
bright spot for the Cal offense, as the freshman
scored two touchdowns on 189 rushing yards.

WASH.
STATE
(3-6, 0-6 Pac-10)
In a contest with 1,064 total yards and 56 first
downs, Arizona State preserved its victory with
its defense. While two third-quarter touchdowns
rallied Washington State from a 27-10 halftime
deficit, the Sun Devils held the Cougars scoreless
over the final 18-plus minutes to eke out a narrow
road victory.
After replacing Sam Keller in the 45-35 loss to
Stanford, Sun Devil signal-caller Rudy Carpenter has
been on fire, and Saturday's contest was no excep
tion. The freshman from Westlake, Calif, completed
67 percent of his passes for 373 yards and two scores.
Meanwhile, Cougar tailback Jerome Harrison
solidified his standing as one of the country's most
underrated rushers. Harrison rumbled for 237 yards
and two touchdowns on Saturday, and the senior has
rushed for more than 100 yards in every contest this
season.The Kalamazoo, Mich., native currently has
1,310 rushing yards on the season, with two games
remaining.
OREGON

Oregon State kicker Alexis Serna connected on
all six of his field goal attempts, and 10 fourth
quarter points proved too little too late for
the Huskies, who are only two losses away from their
second-straight one-win season.
Oregon State struggled offensively, notching only
275 total yards and converting just 5-of-18 third
downs. However, tailback Yvenson Bernard's 132
rushing yards, coupled with Serna's right leg, proved
(3-6, 0-6 Pac-10) >HSF \=/ .
enough for the Beavers, who must win either this
week versus Stanford or next week at nationally
ranked Oregon to become bowl-eligible.
Washington's offense continued to struggle. De
spite rushing 22 times, the Huskies netted only 15
ground yards, and quarterback Isaiah Stanback was
benched at halftime for futility. Furthermore, the
Huskies' only touchdown came with 56 seconds re
maining and the game already out of reach.
