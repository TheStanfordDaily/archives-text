# Rate of common STDs on the rise

ATLANTA — Gonorrhea has fallen to the lowest
level on record in the United States, while the rates of
other sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise, fed
eral health officials said Tuesday.
The seemingly paradoxical findings can be explained
by the cyclical nature of syphilis outbreaks and a rise in
risky sexual behavior among gay men, researchers said.
The nation's gonorrhea rate fell to 113.5 cases per
100,000 people last year, the lowest level since the gov
ernment started tracking cases in 1941. according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Health official saw increases in syphilis, which is far
more rare but has been increasing since 2000. The rate
of reported early-stage syphilis was 4.7 cases per
100,000 in 2004, up 81 percent since 2000.
The chlamydia rate rose to 319.6 cases per 100,000 in
2004, up about 6 percent from the year before. Re
searchers said it is not clear whether the rise represents
a real increase in the prevalence of the disease, or sim
ply reflects better awareness and detection.
All three diseases are caused by sexually transmitted
bacteria.
London researchers reported earlier this year that
because of the life cycle of the syphilis bacteria, infec
tions tend to peak at eight- to 11-year intervals. Sexual
behavior affects the overall number of people infected,
but regular ups and downs are intrinsic to the disease,
the researchers said. Gonorrhea does not follow the
same pattern, they said, and rates have been gradually
falling since the 1980s.
Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, acting director of the CDC's
National Center for HIV,STD andTß Prevention,said
that may be part of the explanation for the rebound in
syphilis, but a primary reason appears to be an increase
in risky sexual behavior.
In 2004, about 64 percent of reported early-stage
syphilis infections occurred among men who had sex
with men, up from 5 percent in 1999, according to the
CDC.
"It's very clear that for the last four years, when we've seen
an increase it's primarily been in men and predominantly in
men who have sex with men," Valdiserri said." We know that's
being fueled by increases in high-risk sexual behavior. We have
good data to substantiate that."
