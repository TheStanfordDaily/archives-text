## Stanford undergrads: Not active learners? 
### 
1 recently received an e-mail on the GSB
distribution list that gave me pause. A lec
turer wanted tutors to help undergrads
who had struggled with a midterm (or in his
words, had "gotten hammered by the test").
Though I'm sure the professor meant well,
one of his comments was especially discon
certing. He expressed the following blanket
opinion of the greater Stanford undergrad
community:"Memorization and rote learning
are just not enough, and the typical Stanford
undergrad, although highly intelligent, is not
a very active learner and often has not been
expected to apply skills to new and challeng
ing situations."
"Damn," I thought, "Where did you go to
school?"
I looked him up, and he did not, in fact, go
to Stanford undergrad.
What I found most ironic (and unsettling)
about the e-mail was that he had casually im
plied that GSB students have significantly
more "critical thinking" capability and are
more "active learners" than the everyday
Stanford undergrad. At the risk of the GSB
ego, I would suggest to our mystery prof that
he look to the undergrads to find talented
tutors.
Graduate school at Stanford is, of course,
competitive. It's the top half of the Stanford
class redistributed to the specific disciplines in
which they have a particular strength and in
terest. The GSB could, theoretically, fill its
class entirely with 770+ GM AT scorers, or en
tirely with 4.0 GPAs. But intangibles like lead
ership, execution and charisma carry as much
or more weight. In other words, I don't know
why the hell I got in.
Similarly, the grad students you'll find in
engineering are quantitative gods, and many
fuzzy Ph.D.s could dazzle their way into na
tional book deals. But these people aren't that
much different from the undergrads at Stan
ford, just a little more focused. My former
SymSys peers would definitely kick the GS-
Bers' asses in our core statistics course, but at
the same time, undergrads would get lambast
ed in our case-oriented courses.
So what am I getting at? Stanford profes
sors should strive to be fair in their view of un
dergrads versus grads and their relative in
vestment in each. I am amazed by the re
sources poured into the education of profes
sional degree students. Here's a taste: free
coffee bar, free food, responsive professors,
famous guest lectures as routine (Steve Young
and Colin Powell lately) and an administra
tion constantly begging for feedback.
I suppose this phenomenon is explainable
to some degree. Stanford's undergraduate
reputation derives much of its strength from
graduate programs, which are almost always
among the top two or three in the world aca
demically. Such strengths though, in an insti
tution where grads and undergrads exist in
equal numbers, can have consequences for
undergrads.
Compare Stanford to Princeton, for in
stance. Princeton has comparable academics
and research to Stanford but has an under
grad-to-grad ratio of 2.5 to 1. Professors have
no choice but to focus their efforts on the un
dergraduate community and to rely on them
to support their research projects. If a Prince
ton professor wants to derive satisfaction
from the enrichment of the students around
him, he will have a more difficult time doing so
just by focusing on grad students than at a uni
versity like Stanford.
Studies of elementary school teachers
demonstrate the power of preconception in
education. If five students are chosen ran
domly, but an "expert" opinion is communi
cated to their teacher that these children will
begin to excel markedly in the next year, the
teacher will invest more attention in these
children. Results show that these randomly
selected students then significantly outper
form their peers.
Stanford professors should do their best to
avoid this psychological and pedagogical fal
lacy and to not hold prejudices like the one ar
ticulated in the e-mail to my GSB class. They
should divide their attention equitably and
presume undergrads as intelligent and hard
working as the grads. The solution should be
mostly cultural — with the administration
setting the relevant tone. The Stanford under
grads of today will invariably be the grads of
tomorrow at America's finest institutions, and
the Steve Youngs of the world have a place
speaking to both.
Still. I'm a bit jealous of Cameron Diaz's
recent appearance in an undergrad class. The
students of CEE 100 should have no problem
with "active learning" this quarter.

grads of today will invariably be the grads of
tomorrow at America's finest institutions, and
the Steve Youngs of the world have a place
speaking to both.
Still. I'm a bit jealous of Cameron Diaz's
recent appearance in an undergrad class. The
students of CEE 100 should have no problem
with "active learning" this quarter.

1 recently received an e-mail on the GSB
distribution list that gave me pause. A lec
turer wanted tutors to help undergrads
who had struggled with a midterm (or in his
words, had "gotten hammered by the test").
Though I'm sure the professor meant well,
one of his comments was especially discon
certing. He expressed the following blanket
opinion of the greater Stanford undergrad
community:"Memorization and rote learning
are just not enough, and the typical Stanford
undergrad, although highly intelligent, is not
a very active learner and often has not been
expected to apply skills to new and challeng
ing situations."
"Damn," I thought, "Where did you go to
school?"
I looked him up, and he did not, in fact, go
to Stanford undergrad.
What I found most ironic (and unsettling)
about the e-mail was that he had casually im
plied that GSB students have significantly
more "critical thinking" capability and are
more "active learners" than the everyday
Stanford undergrad. At the risk of the GSB
ego, I would suggest to our mystery prof that
he look to the undergrads to find talented
tutors.
Graduate school at Stanford is, of course,
competitive. It's the top half of the Stanford
class redistributed to the specific disciplines in
which they have a particular strength and in
terest. The GSB could, theoretically, fill its
class entirely with 770+ GM AT scorers, or en
tirely with 4.0 GPAs. But intangibles like lead
ership, execution and charisma carry as much
or more weight. In other words, I don't know
why the hell I got in.
Similarly, the grad students you'll find in
engineering are quantitative gods, and many
fuzzy Ph.D.s could dazzle their way into na
tional book deals. But these people aren't that
much different from the undergrads at Stan
ford, just a little more focused. My former
SymSys peers would definitely kick the GS-
Bers' asses in our core statistics course, but at
the same time, undergrads would get lambast
ed in our case-oriented courses.
So what am I getting at? Stanford profes
sors should strive to be fair in their view of un
dergrads versus grads and their relative in
vestment in each. I am amazed by the re
sources poured into the education of profes
sional degree students. Here's a taste: free
coffee bar, free food, responsive professors,
famous guest lectures as routine (Steve Young
and Colin Powell lately) and an administra
tion constantly begging for feedback.
I suppose this phenomenon is explainable
to some degree. Stanford's undergraduate
reputation derives much of its strength from
graduate programs, which are almost always
among the top two or three in the world aca
demically. Such strengths though, in an insti
tution where grads and undergrads exist in
equal numbers, can have consequences for
undergrads.
Compare Stanford to Princeton, for in
stance. Princeton has comparable academics
and research to Stanford but has an under
grad-to-grad ratio of 2.5 to 1. Professors have
no choice but to focus their efforts on the un
dergraduate community and to rely on them
to support their research projects. If a Prince
ton professor wants to derive satisfaction
from the enrichment of the students around
him, he will have a more difficult time doing so
just by focusing on grad students than at a uni
versity like Stanford.
Studies of elementary school teachers
demonstrate the power of preconception in
education. If five students are chosen ran
domly, but an "expert" opinion is communi
cated to their teacher that these children will
begin to excel markedly in the next year, the
teacher will invest more attention in these
children. Results show that these randomly
selected students then significantly outper
form their peers.
Stanford professors should do their best to
avoid this psychological and pedagogical fal
lacy and to not hold prejudices like the one ar
ticulated in the e-mail to my GSB class. They
should divide their attention equitably and
presume undergrads as intelligent and hard
working as the grads. The solution should be
mostly cultural — with the administration
setting the relevant tone. The Stanford under
grads of today will invariably be the grads of
tomorrow at America's finest institutions, and
the Steve Youngs of the world have a place
speaking to both.
