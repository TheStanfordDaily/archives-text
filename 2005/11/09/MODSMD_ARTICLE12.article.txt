# ECO-FRIENDLY ENTREPRENEURSHIP
## Stanford alumnus extends fair trade practices to new juice blends 
### ANJALEE SUJANANI 
In true Stanford tradition, alumnus Greg Steltenpohl
combines entrepreneurial spirit and a visionary dedica
tion to sustainable growth to express his concern for the
social and environmental health of our planet.
After spending two decades building Odwalla Inc., a
strong player in the premium juices market, Steltenpohl

has now spearheaded another beverage
company with a social mission — Adina
World Beat Beverages.
Steltenpohl, who describes himself as J
being "cursed with the entrepreneurial -
gene," graduated from the Farm in 1977
with a self-designed bachelor's degree in
biomedical science.
"Being able to pursue a self-designed
major at Stanford gave me the self- confi
dence to trust my own ideas," Steltenpohl says.
"I did it with my own degree and so thought
along the same lines to start a company."

Odwalla was created in 1980 with nothing more
than a $20() hand juicer and a box of oranges. Stel
tenpohl says the idea came to him after reading a
book about 100 businesses you can start for $ 100.
"I wanted to create a business that had a positive
environmental impact," he explains. "At the time, nat
ural juices were a whole new field. They were really

just relegated to juice bars in LA"
After Coca Cola bought Odwalla in 2000, Steltenpohl
says that he was open to new possibilities, but adds that he
"hadn't expected to go back to juice companies."
What made him change his mind was a meeting with
Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade-Marchand who
was frustrated by the fact that the traditional beverages
of her homeland were being replaced by off-the-shelf of
ferings from Western multi-national drink companies.
Steltenpohl says that Wade-Marchand spoke to him
about creating a Fair Trade company to restore the tra
ditional recipes by making them popular first in Western
countries and then bringing them back to their places of
origin.
"I liked the idea of almost reverse colonialism — tak
ing agricultural products indigenous to a country and
helping them grow by using western branding tech
niques," Steltenpohl says.
He continues, "Expanding the idea of Fair Trade into
products other than just coffee or chocolate was an eye
opening concept to me. 1 felt it was worth the challenge
of re-entering a startup environment."
The company born of this vision was Adina World
Beat Beverages. While still less than a year old, Stel
tenpohl says that their products have had very good re
sponses from the test market in the Bay Area.
Steltenpohl elaborates on the difference between
Odwalla and Adina.
"Odwalla was a juice company with a focus on health
and organic, natural products," he explains. "We em
ployed unique marketing that supported grass roots and
environmental organizations."
On the other hand, the focus of Adina is to "defend
juice independence by working with small farmers to
spread their vision of Fair Trade practices," according to
the Web site http://www.adinaworld.com.
"...We have begun a commitment to equitable trade
by working with women's cooperatives to source our
major ingredients," the Web site says.

Steltenpohl says he feels that it is the creative activity
of the entrepreneur that attracts him to the business.
"Entrepreneurs have a unique attribute — the abili
ty to visualize to a high degree of detail and clarity, and
have the will power to connect that vision to current re
ality," he says. "Adina has enabled me to work fora
greater social mission and to put my entrepreneurial and
venture capital energy behind it."
But Adina is not the only project that Steltenpohl is
involved with that blends strategic social vision and
greater market opportunity.
In collaboration with Dee Hock, founder of Visa In
ternational, Steltenpohl has co-established The Interra
Project, which, according to its Web site http://www.in
terra.org, aims to "empower consumers to take back
ownership of their communities, improving environ
mental, cultural and economic health through their
everyday purchasing decisions."
Steltenpohl explains that Interra is a coalition mar
keting program using credit and debit cards.
"Just like frequent flyer programs award customers
for corporate loyalty, here we want to award customers
for shifting their economic behavior towards more sus
tainable patterns," he says.
According to Steltenpohl, there is a lot of opportuni
ty for both graduate and undergraduate students to

work for Adina and Interra.
Stanford senior and economics major Grissel Ramirez
undertook an internship at Adina this past summer.
" I enjoyed it." she says of her experience. "Working in
a startup environment let me interact with more levels of
management than just my own During her intern
ship Ramirez worked on business product development,
which sometimes required her to visit stores that sold
Adina products and discover how customers were re
ceiving them.
ITie social mission behind Adina was another aspect
of her internship that Ramirez appreciated.
"It was refreshing," she says. "They were addressing
situations faced globally.The marketing is unique for the
company, and there are both social and environmental
benefits."
For those interested in meeting Steltenpohl, he will
be on campus Nov. 10 to 13 as a keynote speaker for the
Net Impact 2005 Conference,"Bridging the Gap: Lead
ing Social Innovation Across Sectors," to be hosted by
the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
The annual conference brings together graduate
business students and professionals to' discuss corporate
social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, communi
ty development and environmental management, all of
which are themes to which Steltenpohl is committed.

In true Stanford tradition, alumnus Greg Steltenpohl
combines entrepreneurial spirit and a visionary dedica
tion to sustainable growth to express his concern for the
social and environmental health of our planet.
After spending two decades building Odwalla Inc., a
strong player in the premium juices market, Steltenpohl

has now spearheaded another beverage
company with a social mission — Adina
World Beat Beverages.
Steltenpohl, who describes himself as J
being "cursed with the entrepreneurial -
gene," graduated from the Farm in 1977
with a self-designed bachelor's degree in
biomedical science.
"Being able to pursue a self-designed
major at Stanford gave me the self- confi
dence to trust my own ideas," Steltenpohl says.
"I did it with my own degree and so thought
along the same lines to start a company."

Odwalla was created in 1980 with nothing more
than a $20() hand juicer and a box of oranges. Stel
tenpohl says the idea came to him after reading a
book about 100 businesses you can start for $ 100.
"I wanted to create a business that had a positive
environmental impact," he explains. "At the time, nat
ural juices were a whole new field. They were really

just relegated to juice bars in LA"
After Coca Cola bought Odwalla in 2000, Steltenpohl
says that he was open to new possibilities, but adds that he
"hadn't expected to go back to juice companies."
What made him change his mind was a meeting with
Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade-Marchand who
was frustrated by the fact that the traditional beverages
of her homeland were being replaced by off-the-shelf of
ferings from Western multi-national drink companies.
Steltenpohl says that Wade-Marchand spoke to him
about creating a Fair Trade company to restore the tra
ditional recipes by making them popular first in Western
countries and then bringing them back to their places of
origin.
"I liked the idea of almost reverse colonialism — tak
ing agricultural products indigenous to a country and
helping them grow by using western branding tech
niques," Steltenpohl says.
He continues, "Expanding the idea of Fair Trade into
products other than just coffee or chocolate was an eye
opening concept to me. 1 felt it was worth the challenge
of re-entering a startup environment."
The company born of this vision was Adina World
Beat Beverages. While still less than a year old, Stel
tenpohl says that their products have had very good re
sponses from the test market in the Bay Area.
Steltenpohl elaborates on the difference between
Odwalla and Adina.
"Odwalla was a juice company with a focus on health
and organic, natural products," he explains. "We em
ployed unique marketing that supported grass roots and
environmental organizations."
On the other hand, the focus of Adina is to "defend
juice independence by working with small farmers to
spread their vision of Fair Trade practices," according to
the Web site http://www.adinaworld.com.
"...We have begun a commitment to equitable trade
by working with women's cooperatives to source our
major ingredients," the Web site says.

Steltenpohl says he feels that it is the creative activity
of the entrepreneur that attracts him to the business.
"Entrepreneurs have a unique attribute — the abili
ty to visualize to a high degree of detail and clarity, and
have the will power to connect that vision to current re
ality," he says. "Adina has enabled me to work fora
greater social mission and to put my entrepreneurial and
venture capital energy behind it."
But Adina is not the only project that Steltenpohl is
involved with that blends strategic social vision and
greater market opportunity.
In collaboration with Dee Hock, founder of Visa In
ternational, Steltenpohl has co-established The Interra
Project, which, according to its Web site http://www.in
terra.org, aims to "empower consumers to take back
ownership of their communities, improving environ
mental, cultural and economic health through their
everyday purchasing decisions."
Steltenpohl explains that Interra is a coalition mar
keting program using credit and debit cards.
"Just like frequent flyer programs award customers
for corporate loyalty, here we want to award customers
for shifting their economic behavior towards more sus
tainable patterns," he says.
According to Steltenpohl, there is a lot of opportuni
ty for both graduate and undergraduate students to

work for Adina and Interra.
Stanford senior and economics major Grissel Ramirez
undertook an internship at Adina this past summer.
" I enjoyed it." she says of her experience. "Working in
a startup environment let me interact with more levels of
management than just my own During her intern
ship Ramirez worked on business product development,
