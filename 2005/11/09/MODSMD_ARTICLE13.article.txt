# Law School provides interpretation, legal services for underprivileged; non-law students find a way to help out
## 
### PAMELA SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With reading piling up and a high likeli
hood of being put on the spot in lecture, Stan
ford law students tirelessly learn the intrica
cies of the U.S. legal system. But can they en
sure that legal resources are available to
every citizen? Initiatives like the Stanford
Community Law Clinic (SCLC) seek to pro
mote equality injudicial processes by provid
ing representation, advice and education to
underprivileged residents of the Bay Area.
The SCLC trains Stanford law students
to become highly-qualified public-interest
attorneys through hands-on action in legal
counseling and trials.
The clinic provides legal representation
free of charge to low-income residents of
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Redwood
City. Spearheaded and funded by the Stan
ford Law School, the SCLC tallies roughly
300 to 400 cases per year that might other
wise go unnoticed.
Second-year Stanford law student Adair
Ford is one of 15 to 20 Stanford law students
who is participating in the SCLC this semester.
"After my first year in law school I was
really not working with the populations I
wanted to serve," Ford says."I wanted expe
rience with low-income populations."
Through the SCLC, Ford has worked
under a supervising professional attorney to
reinstate housing vouchers, negotiate hous
ing settlements and represent employees
who have not been fairly compensated for
work or on-the-job injuries.
"Our clients are often not a population
of power," Ford says. "They come to us and
they win a judgment against their employer
who is not paying minimum wage, or against
their landlord who is cheating them on rent.
Watching our clients feel empowered is def
initely the most rewarding part."

Although Ford has not completed her
law degree, she is still certified to represent
clients in court. Eligibility requirements are
two fold — one must be enrolled in law
school and must have completed a course
about evidence.
SCLC Director Peter Reid. who is also an
attorney, has run the SCLC since it started in
2002, and he describes his job as "training the
next generation of public interest attorneys."
In addition to managing the cases that he
and his staff represent, Reid also teaches a
public-interest training class that promotes
dialogue between law students about the
ethical problems of cases they work on

through the SCLC.
Reid says the SCLC faces various chal
lenges, such as trying to educate entire sec
tors about legal issues.
"We see some of the same employers come
back from time to time after we've attempted
to use the law to change their ways," Reid says.
"We've seen a trend of clients working in
restaurants, so we've set up a special restaurant
program to educate restaurant employees and
employers about their workers' rights"
language barriers present another ob
stacle that Reid points out.
"Finding interpreters is always a crucial
issue, and we are lucky to have Stanford un

dergraduates working with ushe says.
One of these undergraduates is Valenti
na Conde, a junior majoring in political sci
ence. Conde and other interpreters partici
pate in a training session before accompany
ing law students to SCLC meetings with
Spanish-speaking clients.
"A good interpreter is supposed to be in
visible so that the law student can establish a
working rapport with the client," Conde ex
plains. "Sometimes, though, it is hard not to
become emotionally engaged."
Conde, who also works with the restau
rant workers' project in Mountain View,
says she has learned a lot about wage and
housing law during her interpreting sessions
— information that she will be able to apply
in subsequent cases.
"1 just love seeing the amount of good
public interest law can do." Conde says."lm
migrants and low-income people in our
community find it difficult to gain access to
justice although there are laws out there to
protect them. Interpreting for SCLC clients
breaks that barrier."
Conde adds that she has enormous re
spect for her clients.
"They are hard workers, tremendously
noble, and far too grateful for our efforts in
helping them get the justice they deserve,"
she says.
The SCLC is one of several public-inter
est law programs that the Stanford Law
School supports. Through Stanford's Street-
Law program, for example, law students can
meet with minors in juvenile detention facil
ities to teach them about their rights. Similar
ly, through the Capital Defense Clinic, those
enrolled at the I>aw School can work on re
search and other aspects of death penalty
cases currently in the appeal stage.
