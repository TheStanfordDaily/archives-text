## Editorial Simplify and expand class cross-registration 
### 
Whether in the sciences or the hu
manities, law or medicine, Stan
ford's academic programs are
among the strongest in the nation. Sadly, few
Stanford students take advantage of the
strength and breadth of Stanford's course
offerings. This is because the current system
of cross-registration discourages many from
taking classes outside their schools, especial
ly in the professional schools.
Such a state of affairs is inexplicable,
given that universities are moving towards
more interdisciplinary modes of education.
Surely prospective doctors, lawyers and
businesspeople would do well to learn a bit
about fields outside of their professions. In
the same vein, many undergraduates think
ing about graduate school would benefit
from taking a few classes in the Law, Medical
and Business Schools.
Ironically, the problem is worst at these
pre-professional schools, where undergrad
uates tend to be excluded from classes and
graduate students have little incentive to ex
plore beyond their narrow academic inter
ests. The situation is exacerbated because
these pre-professional schools provide limit
ed information about their classes to inter
ested undergraduates.
The Graduate School of Business is pos
sibly the most opaque in this respect.
With its cryptic one-page write-up in the
undergraduate course bulletin, the Business
School shrouds itself in an impenetrable fog
of exclusivity. This is unacceptable. After all,
Stanford does not offer an undergraduate
degree in business for the many students
considering careers in investment banking
and consulting after graduation.
The Law School faces a different prob
lem because it is on a semester system, un
like the rest of the University. This prevents
many undergraduates in the quarter system
from taking classes there. Conversely, stu
dents sequestered by the Law School's aca
demic calendar find it inconvenient to take
courses in the rest of the University.
The Law School may be moving away
from this exclusive schedule and joining the
rest of the University soon, and we will push
for even more integration in the future.
One notable exception is the School of
Education. Even though it does not offer a

bachelor's degree, the school offers many
classes to undergraduates interested in
teaching careers. It offers both a coterminal
master's program and an honors program,
and it even furnishes a list of undergraduate
friendly courses in the bulletin. By doing so,
the School of Education fosters intellectual
exchange between undergraduates and
graduate students that is sorely lacking in
other parts of campus.
Clearly, more needs to be done to create
opportunities for students to take classes
outside of their fields. One way to do this
would be to create incentives for pre-profes
sional schools to offer courses to undergrad
uates as well as their own graduate students.
This can be done by allocating more finan
cial resources for undergraduate education
within the pre-professional schools.
Another concrete step would to establish
a grading basis translation among all
schools. The University administration
should set up some rough equivalence be
tween the letter grades used by the general
University, the specific system at the Law
School and the pass-fail grading systems
used by the GSB and School of Medicine.
The University should push schools to
open up as many classes as possible. All these
courses should then be listed on a simple
Web site so that students from other Stan
ford schools can easily locate the offerings
and know where to find more information.
The administration also needs to develop
infrastructure to cater to more cross-regis
tration. Otherwise, undergraduates eager to
jumpstart their careers in investment bank
ing could trigger massive over-enrollment in
Business School finance and accounting
classes. The University could consider open
ing up online pre-registration for popular
graduate classes, possibly using an interface
similar to that used for applications for in
troductory seminars. In this way, students
could express interest and professors could
select, based on merit or lottery, which stu
dents would add the most to their classes.
The University needs to seriously consid
er taking steps to foster more interdiscipli
nary education among undergraduate and
graduate students. Only in this way can Stan
ford harness the synergy that results from
the meeting of minds across campus.

graduate students that is sorely lacking in
other parts of campus.
Clearly, more needs to be done to create
opportunities for students to take classes
outside of their fields. One way to do this
would be to create incentives for pre-profes
sional schools to offer courses to undergrad
uates as well as their own graduate students.
This can be done by allocating more finan
cial resources for undergraduate education
within the pre-professional schools.
Another concrete step would to establish
a grading basis translation among all
schools. The University administration
should set up some rough equivalence be
tween the letter grades used by the general
University, the specific system at the Law
School and the pass-fail grading systems
used by the GSB and School of Medicine.
The University should push schools to
open up as many classes as possible. All these
courses should then be listed on a simple
Web site so that students from other Stan
ford schools can easily locate the offerings
and know where to find more information.
The administration also needs to develop
infrastructure to cater to more cross-regis
tration. Otherwise, undergraduates eager to
jumpstart their careers in investment bank
ing could trigger massive over-enrollment in
Business School finance and accounting
classes. The University could consider open
ing up online pre-registration for popular
graduate classes, possibly using an interface
similar to that used for applications for in
troductory seminars. In this way, students
could express interest and professors could
select, based on merit or lottery, which stu
dents would add the most to their classes.
The University needs to seriously consid
er taking steps to foster more interdiscipli
nary education among undergraduate and
graduate students. Only in this way can Stan
ford harness the synergy that results from
the meeting of minds across campus.

Whether in the sciences or the hu
manities, law or medicine, Stan
ford's academic programs are
among the strongest in the nation. Sadly, few
Stanford students take advantage of the
strength and breadth of Stanford's course
offerings. This is because the current system
of cross-registration discourages many from
taking classes outside their schools, especial
ly in the professional schools.
Such a state of affairs is inexplicable,
given that universities are moving towards
more interdisciplinary modes of education.
Surely prospective doctors, lawyers and
businesspeople would do well to learn a bit
about fields outside of their professions. In
the same vein, many undergraduates think
ing about graduate school would benefit
from taking a few classes in the Law, Medical
and Business Schools.
Ironically, the problem is worst at these
pre-professional schools, where undergrad
uates tend to be excluded from classes and
graduate students have little incentive to ex
plore beyond their narrow academic inter
ests. The situation is exacerbated because
these pre-professional schools provide limit
ed information about their classes to inter
ested undergraduates.
The Graduate School of Business is pos
sibly the most opaque in this respect.
With its cryptic one-page write-up in the
undergraduate course bulletin, the Business
School shrouds itself in an impenetrable fog
of exclusivity. This is unacceptable. After all,
Stanford does not offer an undergraduate
degree in business for the many students
considering careers in investment banking
and consulting after graduation.
The Law School faces a different prob
lem because it is on a semester system, un
like the rest of the University. This prevents
many undergraduates in the quarter system
from taking classes there. Conversely, stu
dents sequestered by the Law School's aca
demic calendar find it inconvenient to take
courses in the rest of the University.
The Law School may be moving away
from this exclusive schedule and joining the
rest of the University soon, and we will push
for even more integration in the future.
One notable exception is the School of
Education. Even though it does not offer a

bachelor's degree, the school offers many
classes to undergraduates interested in
teaching careers. It offers both a coterminal
master's program and an honors program,
and it even furnishes a list of undergraduate
friendly courses in the bulletin. By doing so,
the School of Education fosters intellectual
exchange between undergraduates and
graduate students that is sorely lacking in
other parts of campus.
