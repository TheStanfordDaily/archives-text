Thanks 6th Man
I want to thank the Stanford 6th Man
Club members for their fantastic support at
our exhibition game against Sonoma State
on Saturday. I have coached at quite a few
schools, and 1 have never seen a turnout like
that for an exhibition game.
When I was an assistant coach at Stan
ford, 1 always thought that the 6th Man Club
was the best student fan club in the country.
Performances like last Saturday only con
firm that belief for me and for everyone as
sociated with Stanford Basketball. When
you were at your loudest, it sounded like we
were playing in a late February Pac-10 game
on national television.
I know I am not alone in my opinion that
we have the best student section in the coun
try. Our players and staff share my belief that
the 6th Man Club makes Maples one of the
most feared arenas in the nation.
Thank you again for your support, and I
look forward to seeing you at our next game
this Saturday at 1 p.m. against Cal Poly
Pomona.
Go Cardinal!

Speakers not biased
As director of the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau, I would like to comment on a quota
tion from Monday's Daily made by Duncan
Stevens, president of the Stanford College
Republicans ("Poll shows few conserva
tives," Nov. 7). First of all, I would like to cor
rect Stevens. It was not the ASSU who
brought Ambassador Joseph Wilson, but the
ASSU Speakers Bureau. Though we are af
filiated with the ASSU, we are a separate or
ganization that operates like any other vol
untary student organization.
As for Stevens' point that the ASSU
(Speakers Bureau) needs to do more to pres
ent conflicting perspectives, I would like to
agree with him. The Speakers Bureau strives
to present speakers with diverse ideologies
and backgrounds. But this is a difficult task.
I won't lie. Our lineup over the years has
been more liberal or moderate than conser
vative, but that has nothing to do with the
political views of the Bureau's members. It is
important for the Bureau to bring speakers
with name recognition, and given the stu
dent body's liberal leanings, the number of
recognizable liberal names outweighs the
number of recognizable conservative names.
In addition, well known conservative speak
ers usually have higher speaker fees than

well known liberal or moderate speakers.
In addition to bringing our own speakers,
the Bureau provides logistical and financial
support to other student groups to bring
speakers of their own. When deciding how
much financial assistance we will provide a
group, we do not consider the politics of the
event. In this respect, the Speakers Bureau
does all it can to allow students to hear
speakers with variety of perspectives.

Not really a poll
I was very amused to read about the
"poll" showing that only 7.8 percent of Stan
ford students identify themselves as conser
vative ("Poll shows few conservatives," Nov.
7). The article later describes how conserva
tives are ostracized for their beliefs on cam
pus. Since the "poll" consisted of non-anony
mous posts on Facebook.com, could it not be
that many conservatives on campus choose
not to reveal their political views on a public
forum? Or perhaps conservatives use Face
book.com to a lesser extent than liberals?
Perhaps if The Daily conducted a real
poll, the presence of conservatism on cam
pus wouldn't appear so bleak.

Labor is our problem
In response to the letter "TVaffic Blocking
Unproductive," (Nov. 4): I am sorry to hear
that Cary Ttoy and other commuters were in
convenienced by the protest. I am not sorry to
know that the students and workers together
exercised a common voice against a grave in
justice and raised people's awareness of it.
Whether people agreed with the action
or not, I would ask them to look past their in
convenience. Contrary to what TVoy said, I
believe that the hundreds of commuters who
were delayed by the protest have everything
to do with the workers' grievances.
Whether we are students, faculty, admin
istrators or maintenance workers, we are all
part of the Stanford community. When peo
ple in our community are being treated un
fairly and exploited, it is all of our concern.
When people are paid less than what a per
son can live on and are being denied the
right to a comfortable retirement, it is not
just their problem, it is our problem. These
