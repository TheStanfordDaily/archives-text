# A 						lesson learned the hard way
## 
### 
I admit it: I used to steal music like it was
bulk candy at Safeway, and I never felt
bad about it. The other day I was walking
through the Stanford Shopping Center when
I suddenly found myself in the Apple Store,
and I accidentally slipped and bought a
brand new iPod (oops!). When 1 got home, I
was converted into a law-abiding down
loader, and 1 spent the majority of my after
noon downloading songs from iTunes and
creating fabulous new playlists.
I'm not much of a pop culture junkie, but
for some reason I decided to make a playlist
of pop songs from the early-to-mid '00s. Con
tent with my mad DJ skills, I minimized
iTtines and carried on with my regular pro
crastination routine when it hit me. Just as
Britney sang, "I'm addicted to you. but you
know that you're toxic," I was caught staring
at an online gallery of Hayden Christensen
pictures. It's true, Britney. It's true!
I'm addicted to Hayden Christensen but I
know that he's toxic.
It all started last spring when I went down
to Santa Clara with a friend to see "Star Wars
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" — or as I
like to call it, "Star Wars Episode At-Least-
Three-Times-A-Day: Revenge of the
Crush." From the moment I first saw him un
sheathe his light saber; I was hooked — and
not just in an ordinary fan sort of way. I devel
oped legitimate feelings for Anakin, or Hay
den (sometimes I confuse the two).
For the life of me, I still couldn't under
stand why Hayden only existed in a galaxy

far, far away. Couldn't he ride his star cruiser
over to my Escondido Village apartment and
return peace to my universe? It seems clear
now as I look back that I exhibited all six
stages of substance addiction.
Experimentation. At first it seemed rather
harmless. A lot of people have crushes on
celebrities, right? I can't say I was initially all
that impressed with his acting skills, but he
was easy on the eyes,so I didn't mind. Besides,
I had previously dabbled a bit with Andy
Roddick, Jake Gyllenhaal, Tom Welling and
Christian Bale without much consequence.
Use. Last summer I was living in New
York City and it was brutally hot and humid
for the majority of the season. My only
refuge was to seek air conditioning in 140-
minute spurts, and I figured there were
worse things to do than spending quality
time with my favorite celebrity. Unfortu
nately, the heat was relentless, so what start
ed out as an escape from the urban oven be
came a recipe for disaster.
Misuse. I should have known that some
thing was wrong after I found no less than six

used ticket stubs in my wallet.Thanks to the re
quired statistics courses for my Ph.D., I was
able to calculate that I had spent well over $100
and roughly 14 hours of my life devoted to this
crush. What's more, I began to develop serious
feelings for Hayden, and 1 sympathized with
him and his struggle to choose between the
dark and opposite-of-dark sides of the force.
Abuse. My troubles worsened when I no
ticed a fat lady selling bootleg copies of the
movie in the 14th street subway. 1 desperately
bought a copy, ran home, and immediately put
it in my DVD player before 1 noticed that it
had no audio at all. The worst part was that it
didn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, I much
preferred to look at Hayden without hearing
that Natalie Portman chick's annoying voice.
Dependency. I didn't fully recognize my
dependency on Hayden until the movie was
no longer in the theaters. I was forced to rec
oncile the fact that Hayden had left me and
was no longer playing on the big screen of my
life. It's no exaggeration to say that I felt as
though I had lost my best friend (keep in
mind that I don't have that many friends, for
obvious reasons).
Addiction. Again this past week —as I
spent 20 minutes riding my bike to the East
Palo Alto Best Buy so that I could buy the very
first copy of the DVD — 1 had to face the fact
that 1 had a serious problem. At the time it felt
like the best $14.99 I've ever spent. Cut to me
lowering my head in disappointment when I

discovered that there was no deleted
scene of Hayden in Ewan McGregor
having gay sex. Shoot.
You might think this entire arti
cle is a joke, which is partially true.
But hey, now you've learned the six
stages of substance abuse. Congrat
ulations. Now get help if you need it.

came a recipe for disaster.
Misuse. I should have known that some
thing was wrong after I found no less than six

used ticket stubs in my wallet.Thanks to the re
quired statistics courses for my Ph.D., I was
able to calculate that I had spent well over $100
and roughly 14 hours of my life devoted to this
crush. What's more, I began to develop serious
feelings for Hayden, and 1 sympathized with
him and his struggle to choose between the
dark and opposite-of-dark sides of the force.
Abuse. My troubles worsened when I no
ticed a fat lady selling bootleg copies of the
movie in the 14th street subway. 1 desperately
bought a copy, ran home, and immediately put
it in my DVD player before 1 noticed that it
had no audio at all. The worst part was that it
didn't bother me in the slightest. In fact, I much
preferred to look at Hayden without hearing
that Natalie Portman chick's annoying voice.
Dependency. I didn't fully recognize my
dependency on Hayden until the movie was
no longer in the theaters. I was forced to rec
oncile the fact that Hayden had left me and
was no longer playing on the big screen of my
life. It's no exaggeration to say that I felt as
though I had lost my best friend (keep in
mind that I don't have that many friends, for
obvious reasons).
Addiction. Again this past week —as I
spent 20 minutes riding my bike to the East
Palo Alto Best Buy so that I could buy the very
first copy of the DVD — 1 had to face the fact
that 1 had a serious problem. At the time it felt
like the best $14.99 I've ever spent. Cut to me
lowering my head in disappointment when I

discovered that there was no deleted
scene of Hayden in Ewan McGregor
having gay sex. Shoot.
You might think this entire arti
cle is a joke, which is partially true.
But hey, now you've learned the six
stages of substance abuse. Congrat
ulations. Now get help if you need it.

I admit it: I used to steal music like it was
bulk candy at Safeway, and I never felt
bad about it. The other day I was walking
through the Stanford Shopping Center when
I suddenly found myself in the Apple Store,
and I accidentally slipped and bought a
brand new iPod (oops!). When 1 got home, I
was converted into a law-abiding down
loader, and 1 spent the majority of my after
noon downloading songs from iTunes and
creating fabulous new playlists.
I'm not much of a pop culture junkie, but
for some reason I decided to make a playlist
of pop songs from the early-to-mid '00s. Con
tent with my mad DJ skills, I minimized
iTtines and carried on with my regular pro
crastination routine when it hit me. Just as
Britney sang, "I'm addicted to you. but you
know that you're toxic," I was caught staring
at an online gallery of Hayden Christensen
pictures. It's true, Britney. It's true!
I'm addicted to Hayden Christensen but I
know that he's toxic.
It all started last spring when I went down
to Santa Clara with a friend to see "Star Wars
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" — or as I
like to call it, "Star Wars Episode At-Least-
Three-Times-A-Day: Revenge of the
Crush." From the moment I first saw him un
sheathe his light saber; I was hooked — and
not just in an ordinary fan sort of way. I devel
oped legitimate feelings for Anakin, or Hay
den (sometimes I confuse the two).
For the life of me, I still couldn't under
stand why Hayden only existed in a galaxy

far, far away. Couldn't he ride his star cruiser
over to my Escondido Village apartment and
return peace to my universe? It seems clear
now as I look back that I exhibited all six
stages of substance addiction.
Experimentation. At first it seemed rather
harmless. A lot of people have crushes on
celebrities, right? I can't say I was initially all
that impressed with his acting skills, but he
was easy on the eyes,so I didn't mind. Besides,
I had previously dabbled a bit with Andy
Roddick, Jake Gyllenhaal, Tom Welling and
Christian Bale without much consequence.
Use. Last summer I was living in New
York City and it was brutally hot and humid
for the majority of the season. My only
refuge was to seek air conditioning in 140-
minute spurts, and I figured there were
worse things to do than spending quality
time with my favorite celebrity. Unfortu
nately, the heat was relentless, so what start
ed out as an escape from the urban oven be
came a recipe for disaster.
