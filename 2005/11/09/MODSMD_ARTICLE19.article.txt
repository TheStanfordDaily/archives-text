# From the grad student ghetto
## 
### 
The Daily is a very helpful paper. As well
as telling you how to vote, providing a
forum for endless debates on the Mid
dle East and keeping you informed on the
various road-widening projects around cam
pus, it also tells you what day it is.
The latter juicy nugget is usually just a
subtle hint in the top corner of page, unim
posing. yet reassuring. Once a week, though,
the editors make a special effort to really
publicize the temporal status and let every
one know that, yes, today is Wednesday. And
how do they do this? With a weekly broad
cast from the Grad Ghetto.
There are three graduate student opin
ions columnists and each one appears today.
Compounding this sharp demarcation, we
also have the Graduate Life page (on which
graduate students can read about how to
have a life or something).
Now, as a general rule, there is, of course,
nothing wrong with building barriers by
ghettoizing particular social groups. I mean,
all the major newspapers have their Jewish
days, their Muslim days and their Xenu-wor
shipper days. There is, though, a small differ
ence between this and what The Daily does.
While it's all very well to do your part for

affirmative action by boosting the profile of a
minority, that only really works if the minor
ity is really a minority
If, for example, the graduate student pop
ulation was, say, twice that of the undergrad
uate one, you might wonder how such a ma
jority ended up with its representation in the
free press squeezed into a single, solitary day.
In all fairness to The Daily (look editorial
types, I'm being nice) it's not its fault that the
paper lacks adequate numbers of grownup
writers. No, that one is your fault. I suppose,
though, that "fault" may not be the right
word — you probably just don't care.
Boxes, pigeonholes, lines in the sand and
other such metaphors are not solely the
purview of this newspaper. For all its mar
velous variety, Stanford is very much a place

of pockets.
There are around 12,(X)0 graduate, profes
sional, and continuing studies students here,
versus little over half that number of under
graduates. Yet if you read the paper, went to
the shows, watched the sporting events and
so on, you would swiftly conclude that the
ratio had to be at least the reverse.
Graduate student integration into the
most visible parts of campus life is practical
ly non-existent. And, even when it's there,
you'd hardly notice.
There's a particular chant that goes up
during football games, '"06, '07, '08, '09," that
highlights the transparency of the graduate
student population. We sit, we cheer and we
care. Yet there is nary a mention of us.
I suppose to some large degree this is un
derstandable. We have different roles than
the undergraduates.They are here to develop
as human beings, explore new avenues and
expand their horizons (all of which usually
translates as filling out their resumes).
On the other hand we're here to hide away
in dark little corners busily working to ensure
that Stanford maintains its status as one of

worlds leading research institutions.
However, coming to grad school
is not just about burying yourself in
your books. Rather it's a commit
ment to a lifestyle. The rarefied at
mosphere of academia should pro
vide more than just a place to do re
search, it should also be a communi
ty. And the occasional sense of being
marginalized within that communi
ty is frustrating.
You know, 1 can live with the dif
ferent social circles. I even appreci
ate them to some degree — but the
absence of integration in so much
else, that bothers me.
1 write many of my columns sit
ting at the bar in The 750. This is

mostly to try to cultivate an image as
a modern day Hemingway, tapping
away in a strange land.
Anyway, as I put on this act, peo
ple talk to me.That's happened twice
during this particular piece and each
time I made the same mistake.
The charming couple who ap
proached first were seniors major
ing in economics, not grad students.
And the somewhat tipsy young man
was a first-year medical student, not
an undergrad.
All of which says... Probably
nothing, other than if it's this easy to
mistake the young for the old, per
haps the prospect of a greater sense
of integration is not such a distant
dream.

absence of integration in so much
else, that bothers me.
1 write many of my columns sit
ting at the bar in The 750. This is

mostly to try to cultivate an image as
a modern day Hemingway, tapping
away in a strange land.
Anyway, as I put on this act, peo
ple talk to me.That's happened twice
during this particular piece and each
time I made the same mistake.
The charming couple who ap
proached first were seniors major
ing in economics, not grad students.
And the somewhat tipsy young man
was a first-year medical student, not
an undergrad.
All of which says... Probably
nothing, other than if it's this easy to
mistake the young for the old, per
haps the prospect of a greater sense
of integration is not such a distant
dream.

The Daily is a very helpful paper. As well
as telling you how to vote, providing a
forum for endless debates on the Mid
dle East and keeping you informed on the
various road-widening projects around cam
pus, it also tells you what day it is.
The latter juicy nugget is usually just a
subtle hint in the top corner of page, unim
posing. yet reassuring. Once a week, though,
the editors make a special effort to really
publicize the temporal status and let every
one know that, yes, today is Wednesday. And
how do they do this? With a weekly broad
cast from the Grad Ghetto.
There are three graduate student opin
ions columnists and each one appears today.
Compounding this sharp demarcation, we
also have the Graduate Life page (on which
graduate students can read about how to
have a life or something).
Now, as a general rule, there is, of course,
nothing wrong with building barriers by
ghettoizing particular social groups. I mean,
all the major newspapers have their Jewish
days, their Muslim days and their Xenu-wor
shipper days. There is, though, a small differ
ence between this and what The Daily does.
While it's all very well to do your part for

affirmative action by boosting the profile of a
minority, that only really works if the minor
ity is really a minority
If, for example, the graduate student pop
ulation was, say, twice that of the undergrad
uate one, you might wonder how such a ma
jority ended up with its representation in the
free press squeezed into a single, solitary day.
In all fairness to The Daily (look editorial
types, I'm being nice) it's not its fault that the
paper lacks adequate numbers of grownup
writers. No, that one is your fault. I suppose,
though, that "fault" may not be the right
word — you probably just don't care.
Boxes, pigeonholes, lines in the sand and
other such metaphors are not solely the
purview of this newspaper. For all its mar
velous variety, Stanford is very much a place

of pockets.
There are around 12,(X)0 graduate, profes
sional, and continuing studies students here,
versus little over half that number of under
graduates. Yet if you read the paper, went to
the shows, watched the sporting events and
so on, you would swiftly conclude that the
ratio had to be at least the reverse.
Graduate student integration into the
most visible parts of campus life is practical
ly non-existent. And, even when it's there,
you'd hardly notice.
There's a particular chant that goes up
during football games, '"06, '07, '08, '09," that
highlights the transparency of the graduate
student population. We sit, we cheer and we
care. Yet there is nary a mention of us.
I suppose to some large degree this is un
derstandable. We have different roles than
the undergraduates.They are here to develop
as human beings, explore new avenues and
expand their horizons (all of which usually
translates as filling out their resumes).
On the other hand we're here to hide away
in dark little corners busily working to ensure
that Stanford maintains its status as one of

However, coming to grad school
is not just about burying yourself in
your books. Rather it's a commit

vide more than just a place to do re

marginalized within that communi
