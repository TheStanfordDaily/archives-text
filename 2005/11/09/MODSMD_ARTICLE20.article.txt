## "The whole team knows what they have to do right now" HANGING TOUGH Cardinal host Arizona State at Maples tomorrow night

â€” JOHN DUNNING, head coach

With hopes of a Pacific-10 Conference title
starting to slip away, the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team knows that each play
er needs to step up in the final month of the
regular season in order to carry momentum
into the NCAA Tournament.
Still adjusting to the recent loss of sopho
more setter Bryn Kehoe, who broke her right
hand last week during practice, the Cardinal
(21-4,10-3) defeated Washington State, 3-1. in
Pullman, Wash, last Friday after being swept by
No. 2 Washington the previous night.
"It was hard for us to immediately adjust
and play in Washington in front of 5,000 peo
ple," head coach John Dunning said. "1 felt we
learned a lot in the Washington contest, and I
am extremely proud of the team effort."
Senior setter Katie Goldhahn filled in for
the injured Kehoe last weekend after having
only two days to transition into her new role of
running Stanford's offense. Goldhahn adjusted
well, recording a career-high 68 assists as well
as six kills in the Washington State contest. Ju
nior outside hitter Kristin Richards, who col
lected a career-high 31 kills against the
Cougars, attributed much of the team's success
offensively to Goldhahn's tremendous effort.
"Losing Bryn is a very big deal, since she's a
core part of our lineup, both in talent and per
sonality," Richards said. "We are very lucky to
have Katie doing a phenomenal job setting up
our offense."
Team chemistry has played a vital role recent
ly, with each athlete having to fill in the spots left
by their fallen colleagues. Dunning found it diffi
cult to pinpoint one player that has led the group
and instead said the entire team has worked to
gether to push each other to new heights.
"The whole team knows what they have to
do right now," Dunning said. "Everybody is
coming to practice focused on what we need
to work on. We have a month left in the sea
son, and we can definitely get better in that
period of time."
Goldhahn echoed Dunning's sentiments on
the team's growth.
"Everyone has stepped up in a way," she
said. "If anything, our connection and chem
istry has grown because of what has happened
to our team. We've come together and said
we're capable of doing as well right now as
three weeks ago when everyone was healthy."
The Cardinal return to Maples Pavilion to
morrow night to host Arizona State (7-15, 2-
10). Despite being eighth in the Pac-10,the Sun
Devils offer one of the conference's fastest of
fenses as well as a strong serving game. Junior
outside hitter Nicole Morton leads Arizona
State's attack with a little more than three kills
per game.
As a team, the Sun Devils are hitting .207
and averaging 2.12 blocks per game.The Cardi
nal enter the match hitting .289 and are holding
opponents to .162.
"We've been working on fundamental
things to get us ready for Arizona State," Dun
ning said. "Their offense is faster than anyone
else we play. We need to block differently and
we need to be very aware on our passing be
cause they have some really deep servers."
Dunning said he does not know exactly
when to expect Kehoe's return to action,
though he offered a positive outlook on her
cardiovascular work and continued attendance
at team practices.
Freshman outside hitter Cynthia Barboza,
who suffered a season-ending torn ACL last
month, underwent successful surgery last
Thursday. Dunning said doctors cleaned out an
area in her knee that had been bothering her
before the injury, so he expects her to return
better than ever.
Despite many injuries and the recent loss to
