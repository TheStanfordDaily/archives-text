# RACQUETBALL
## Club dominates men's competition in opener Squad takes second due to roster's lack of female representation 
### TERESA MOLINA 
Though the lack of racquethall courts at
the new Arrillaga Center for Sports and
Recreation has dampened the Stanford rac
quethall club's hopes for greater popularity
and participation, it didn't prevent this small
yet enthusiastic group from making an im
pressive show of talent at their first tourna
ment last month.
The first competition for the Western
Collegiate Racquethall Conference was
held at California on Oct. 29. Stanford com
peted against six fellow WCRC universities:

UC-Santa Cruz, California. UC-Davis,
Sacramento State, CSU-East Bay and San
Jose State. Of the four separate tournament
divisions (three men's and one women's),
Stanford players competed in all except the
women's division.
While participating in this daylong tourna
ment meant waking up in time for registration
at 7 a.m., at the end of the day, Stanford's ded
icated racquethall players found that sacrific
ing their weekend lie-in had been worth
while.
The squad finished second overall, 38
points behind first place Sacramento State.
The second-place finish was impressive con
sidering the team's lack of female partici
pants. Under this particular tournament for
mat. where points in the women's division
were given more weight than the those in the
men's divisions, Stanford would have earned

enough points to surpass Sacramento State in
the overall tally if the team had even a single
woman compete.
"One girl would have won it for us. even
if she stood there and didn't win a point,"
sophomore president David Medina said.
Nevertheless, the individual successes of
the Stanford athletes speak for themselves. In
the men's second division, graduate student
Aaron Plotnik took third place, sophomore
Tom James finished in second, and junior
Ouang Nguyen won the championship to
complete a decisive Stanford sweep of the top
three spots.
Stanford also dominated the third
men's division, where Medina claimed first
place and senior Ro-el Cordero finished in
second.
Stanford proved to be the
strongest men's team in the field,
capturing more than half of nine top
three men's positions.
The fact that the team's represen
tation failed to contain a single fe
male team member points to a
plunge in overall participation for
the racquetball club. This plunge is
potentially due to the team's need to
use expensive and inconvenient off
campus facilities and was likely
played a role in the narrow loss to
Sacramento State.
When it was first established in
1993 by Ryan Kaltman, a junior at
the time, Stanford's racquetball pro
gram was highly organized and com
petitive; the squad secured a place in

the national top 10 in both 1994 and
1995. After this, however, the club
deteriorated from its nationally
ranked status to a virtual nonexis
tence that lasted until Cordero and
Todd McLaughlin pulled the club
out of dormancy last year when they
sought former racquetball athletes
and obtained official coaching.
Since its period of inactivity, the
racquetball club has come a long way.
Club coordinators undoubtedly have
several challenges yet to tackle, but
judging from the team's performance
last month, the squad appears to be
thriving in spite of difficulties.
Even without the Arrillaga courts
they were counting on, members of
the racquetball squad are making do
with what they have. With a few more
able-bodied and willing athletes —
women in particular — the club has
the potential to dominate its confer
ence and perhaps return to the high
standards it upheld a decade ago.

several challenges yet to tackle, but
judging from the team's performance
last month, the squad appears to be
thriving in spite of difficulties.
Even without the Arrillaga courts
they were counting on, members of
the racquetball squad are making do
with what they have. With a few more
able-bodied and willing athletes —
women in particular — the club has
the potential to dominate its confer
ence and perhaps return to the high
standards it upheld a decade ago.
