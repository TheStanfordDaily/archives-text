## Club dominates men's competition in opener Squad takes second due to roster's lack of female representation

Though the lack of racquethall courts at
the new Arrillaga Center for Sports and
Recreation has dampened the Stanford rac
quethall club's hopes for greater popularity
and participation, it didn't prevent this small
yet enthusiastic group from making an im
pressive show of talent at their first tourna
ment last month.
The first competition for the Western
Collegiate Racquethall Conference was
held at California on Oct. 29. Stanford com
peted against six fellow WCRC universities:

UC-Santa Cruz, California. UC-Davis,
Sacramento State, CSU-East Bay and San
Jose State. Of the four separate tournament
divisions (three men's and one women's),
Stanford players competed in all except the
women's division.
While participating in this daylong tourna
ment meant waking up in time for registration
at 7 a.m., at the end of the day, Stanford's ded
icated racquethall players found that sacrific
ing their weekend lie-in had been worth
while.
The squad finished second overall, 38
points behind first place Sacramento State.
The second-place finish was impressive con
sidering the team's lack of female partici
pants. Under this particular tournament for
mat. where points in the women's division
were given more weight than the those in the
men's divisions, Stanford would have earned

enough points to surpass Sacramento State in
the overall tally if the team had even a single
woman compete.
"One girl would have won it for us. even
if she stood there and didn't win a point,"
sophomore president David Medina said.
Nevertheless, the individual successes of
the Stanford athletes speak for themselves. In
the men's second division, graduate student
Aaron Plotnik took third place, sophomore
Tom James finished in second, and junior
Ouang Nguyen won the championship to
complete a decisive Stanford sweep of the top
three spots.
Stanford also dominated the third
men's division, where Medina claimed first
place and senior Ro-el Cordero finished in
second.
