# The 						value of being overrated
## 
### 
One of the biggest, if not the
biggest, story of the NBA off
season this past summer was
the contract restructuring and trade of
guard Joe Johnson from the Phoeniz
Suns — the team with the best record
in 2004-05 — to the Atlanta Hawks —
the league's cellar team last season.
Johnson was traded for the second
time in his four-year career and, on this
occasion, was exchanged fora third
year role-playing guard, Frenchman
Boris Diaw, and two future first-round
draft picks.
Much of the publicity arose when
one of Atlanta's co-owners, who also
happened to represent the team on
the NBA Board of Governors, object
ed to the decision and was forcibly
bought out of his 30 percent share in
order for the trade to go through. But
the issue in my mind is this: why was
such a ridiculous amount of coin
thrown at Johnson in the first place?
There are many critics of both the
NBA and pro sports in general who
believe that the amount of money
professional athletes make at the
highest levels is ludicrous. To these
critics, the complaints that athletes
voice about not making their "market
value" are even more appalling.Their
salaries are likely be in the top 5 per
cent of the country's moneymakers
— at the minimum. And in all likeli
hood, if the casual fan even hears
about a contract dispute in the news,
the player is probably complaining
about a contract that pays well over a
couple million dollars annually.
1 am not one of these critics,
though. 1 don't really have an issue
with the players in the sports or
other entertainment industries
making the big bucks. While I don't
have a well thought-out argument as
to why the average NBA player
should make in one year ($4.9 mil
lion) more than double what the av
erage owner of a college bachelor's
degree will make in his or her entire
lifetime ($2.1 million), I can simply
acknowledge that the entertain
ment value of bringing superior tal
ent into these specific "fields" is
worth it. Or perhaps I've just accept
ed the truth that this is the way it is
and this is the way it's going to be.
In the case of Joe Johnson,
though, all the hubbub and excite
ment was about a contract that was
going to pay him $70 million over
the next five years (with about $20
million of the sum being paid this
upcoming season). I just don't know
how anyone can justify this amount
of money without providing an ex
planation that would be met only
with laughter (if only by me).
Selected with the 10th pick in the
2001 draft, Johnson has been touted
as an über-athletic combo guard
who has bettered his points per
game average each year. From the
looks of his numbers, though, he has
hardly been a consistent producer
— much less a star.
This begs the question of
whether he was hindered or helped
by being on the same team as Steve
Nash, Amare Stoudemire and
Shawn Marion? If I were a GM, the
answer to this question would not be
worth $70 million. At least not at this
stage fora 24-year old who, coming
into the NBA, already had a ques

tionable reputation for coasting.
From another standpoint, the
Johnson signing simply constitutes
yet another marker on the wacky
road the money-minded NBA has
been traveling. Sure, there are con
tracts larger than Johnson's in the
league. But speaking only of this sea
son, the fact is that Johnson will be
making top-three, if not the largest
paycheck in the NBA.
Just take a look at this. His $20 mil
lion will be matched only by Shaq,and
it will exceed the individual contracts

of Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan. Tracy
McGrady and Vince Carter by at least
four million dollars each for the entire
season. Additionally, he will be mak
ing more than $15 million more than
NBA posterchildren Yao Ming and
Leßron James.
I can't blame GMs who have given
gargantuan contracts to players who
were bona fide stars when they signed
(read: Grant Hill, Chris Webber,
Michael Finley) — some of those guys
are still worth those millions. I just
don't see how someone like Johnson
— who led the entire league in min
utes in the 2003-04 season yet only av
eraged a tad under 17 points, and then
followed that up with an 04-05 cam
paign in which his assists dipped from
4.4 to 3.5 — could possibly garner top

echelon money to be the next great
point guard for the Hawks.
Shouldn't that be the expectation
with that kind of money? Or is it just
common practice to hand out $20 mil
lion a year fora Smush Parker-esque
routine (yes, the two are each averag
ing about 17 points, four rebounds
and four assists several games into the
season, with Parker at the helm of the
LA Lakers).
But alas, this is the business of
sports. It can hardly ever be ex
plained. But that's what makes the
sports universe so great and sports
stories so intriguing.
