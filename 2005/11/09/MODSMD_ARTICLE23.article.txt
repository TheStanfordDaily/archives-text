## Cardinal pair battle into the Elite Eight 
### CARLING NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
T\venty-one games had passed in the
semifinal match between Stanford senior
KC Corkery's and Duke's Ludovic Walter
and neither player had broken the other's
serve. Corkery had narrowly lost the first set
to Walter in a tiebreaker and was trailing 4-
5 in the second set at the ITA National In
door Championships.
The two seniors met in 2(X)4 in the first
round of the same tournament, and the
Blue Devil prevailed in two tiebreakers,
without a single service break throughout
the two sets. So when the two players faced
off last Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, each
held hopes that he would be able to put an

end to the serving stalemate. After 45 con
secutive games of service holds, Walter fi
nally capitalized and broke Corkery s serve
to close out the match 7-6.6-4 and move on
to the singles title match.
"Both of us had 15 to 20 aces, and there
was a lot of big serving back and forth,"
Corkery said. "[We went] 45 games in a row
without a [service] break,so it was bound to
happen eventually."
En route to his first national semifinal,
Corkery picked up a 6-2,6-1 first round win
on Thursday against Texas A&M Corpus
Christi's Raul Morant-Rivas before defeat
ing Radford's Martin Sayer, 6-2,6-4 on Fri
day. Corkery's quarterfinal match later that
day lasted a little longer as Embry-
Riddle's Mislav Hizak stretched
Corkery to three sets. The Cardinal
eventually claimed a 6-4,5-7,6-4 win
to earn a spot in the semifinals, where
he was defeated by Walter.
"I think KC had undoubtedly the
best fall of his college career," assis
tant coach Dave Hodge said. "In his
semifinal] match he played well;
Walter] just played a little better."
Also doing his share of damage in
the singles draw was freshman Matt
Bruch. Bruch caught people's atten
tion in October when he advanced to
the semifinals of the All-American
Championships before dropping a
close two-setter to the eventual
champion, Georgia's John Isner.
"[Bruch's] a bit of a perfectionist
and doesn't like losing to anybody,"
Hodge said. "So I think he'll keep
working and hopefully be able to
take [the tennis] he's been playing
with him into the spring."
This past weekend, Bruch's run
was once again halted by the eventu
al champion, only this time Bruch
lost to UCLA's Ben Kohlloeffel,with
a score of 6-1,7-5. In his straight-set
defeat over Walter on Sunday, the
Bruin punctuated a run in which he
gave up only one set throughout the
entire tournament.
Prior to his quarterfinal exit, Bruch
battled back after being down a set in
the first round to defeat Oklahoma
State's Tomas Bohunicky 6-7,6-3,6-1.
In the Round of 16, the Cardinal de
feated the winner of the Southeast re
gional tournament, Erling Tveit of
Miss., in straight set tiebreakers.
"[Matt's] come in and has really
been a bright spot for the team,"
Corkery said."He's come into col
lege and has not been intimidated by
the older guys. I think he can get a lot
better than he is right now, and obvi
ously, he's already really good."
In addition to participating in the
singles draw, Corkery teamed up with
junior James Pade to take another
shot at the Indoors doubles title. The
duo competed at the Indoors in 2002
and fell in the semifinals of the conso
lation bracket. In 2004, Corkery and
recent graduate Sam Warburg fell in
the finals of the main draw.
This year, Corkery and Pade were
not able to get off on the right foot, as
the Cardinal pair fell to Georgia, 8-5,
in the first round.
"I think it took us awhile to wake
up and by that time we were already
down a break," Corkery said. "In an
eight game pro-set, you just can't let
that happen. You can't give anybody
anything, especially not in a tourna
ment like this where all the teams
are good."

However, the tandem picked up a
pair of 8-4 wins in consolation against
Santa Fe and Brown before facing
Baylor in the finals. Although Stan
ford had a few opportunities to close
out the pro-set after breaking Bay
lor's serve, the Bears hung on and
forced the Cardinal to earn the win in
a tiebreaker.
"They were up a break twice in a
pro-set," Hodge said. "Generally
when there's one break of serve,
that's pretty much the pro-set. If they
had taken care of their own serve, the
match probably wouldn't have come

down to a tiebreaker."
Despite the shaky performance in
the finals and the loss in the first
round, Corkery and Pade were still
able to buckle down and win the con
solation draw.
"Neither of us was enthusiastic
about having to play the back draw,"
Corkery said. "We went there to win
the main draw, but I think we handled
our first round loss pretty well. We
would have rather played well and
won, obviously, but if you can still
manage to find a way to win playing
poorly, that's a bitÂ» key to success."
