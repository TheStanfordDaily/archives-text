# SPECIAL EVENT
## Disability rights activist speaks at SDRC 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Leading disability rights activist
Paul Longmore dissected what he
called centuries of misinformation
and discrimination last night when
he challenged a packed audience at
the Student Disability Resource
Center (SDRC) to break out of
contemporary paradigms and view
many disability issues as products
of social interactions rather than
biology.
Specifically, he provided a histor
ical overview of the disability rights
movement to underscore the limita
tions of the dominant disability par
adigm known as the "medical
model." According to Longmore.
this model classifies disability as the
result of physiological or psycholog
ical shortcomings, which he said
fails to acknowledge the impact of
social, societal and political factors
also at play for the disabled.
"Advocates of the medical model
look solely into the bodies of the in
dividuals," Longmore said. "Essen
tially, they make biology destiny."
Longmore, a published author
and history professor at San Fran
cisco State University, highlighted
the historical impact that this med
ical model has had on shaping the
perceptions of the disabled. Accord
ing to Longmore, the model's deter
ministic assumptions were used to
justify discriminatory practices, laws
that remained on the books since
the 1970'5.
He then explored an alternative
paradigm that focuses on the impact
that environment plays in influenc
ing views, stereotypes and policy
goals.
"The assumption is this: as with
people of color and women, biology
acts as a flag," Longmore said. "It
signals social and political artifacts
about the individual. If this particu
lar trait is stigmatized, the trait is
globalized, and it then triggers anxi
ety, biases, avoidance and discrimi
natory treatment."
Looking at disability as a sys
temic rather than an individual
problem subsequently allows poli
cymakers to view disability discrim
ination as an issue that requires a
systemic remedy, Longmore said.
Longmore concluded the event
with a question-and-answer session,
fielding questions concerning
everything from alleged disability
discrimination posed by CalTrain to
the role of caregivers working for
disabled students.
When asked about the future sta
tus of the disability movement,
Longmore offered an ominous pre
diction.
"The situation isn't good, and the
U.S. has essentially gutted much of
the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA)," Longmore said. "Many
people with disabilities no longer
have protection under the ADA,
and it is likely that the Supreme
Court will continue to weaken the
Act's protection."
Yet, Longmore said that proac
tive change remains possible so
long as members of the disability
rights movement establish cross
disability alliances to increase po
litical clout.
Joan Berry, coordinator for the
Barbara and Bowen McCoy Pro
gram in Ethics in Society at Stan
ford, praised Longmore for shed
ding light on the oft overlooked is

sues faced by disabled persons.
"I wanted to raise the awareness
of these issues," Berry said. "And I
was very lucky that Paul, who is so
incredibly knowledgeable about
this field, was willing to come to
campus to talk about his work."
Kristen Sullivan, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Education, was
pleased that the event facilitated
substantive discussion about issues
facing disabled persons.
"1 really enjoyed it," Sullivan
said."lt was really informative and I
found it helpful because it's a topic
that's avoided by the general popu
lation. This event is exactly what we
need more of."
While recent graduate Elizabeth
Phillips, who is blind, praised the

event as a step in the right direction,
she said that the University does not
do enough to increase discourse on
these issues.
"Though of the most part stu
dents with disabilities are accepted,
a great deal of education still needs
to occur, and it is usually the respon
sibility of the particular student with

a disability to provide this education
when needed," Phillips said.
Nevertheless, the talk ended on a
high note, and faculty members like
Stanford Law School Prof. Stephen
Rosenbaum lauded the years of ex
perience that Longmore brought to
the table.
"He is one of the pioneer chroni

clers of the disability civil rights
movement," Rosenbaum said. "He
literally breathes disability rights."
Teri Adams, assistant director
and program coordinator for Stu
dents with Physical Disabilities put
it even more bluntly — "He blows a
lot of preconceptions about disabil
ities out of the water."
