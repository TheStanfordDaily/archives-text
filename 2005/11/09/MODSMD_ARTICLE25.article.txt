## Grades not disclosed to HPACs, RAs University maintains strict adherence to FERPA guidelines 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
For those students who are curious or worried
whether their head peer academic coordinators
(HPACs) or resident fellows (RFs) ever see their grades
or academic transcripts. University officials have put to
rest any reasons for concern.
'The Undergraduate Advising Program does not
share student records with HPACs or PMs [Peer Men
tors)," Lorraine Sterritt. associate vice provost of aca
demic programs and director of undergraduate advising
programs wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Students are protected by the Federal Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act of N74 (FERPA), which
generally requires consent of the student or his or her
family before the school may release "any information
from a student's educational record," according to the
US. Department of Education Web site.
The Office of the University Registrar annually in
cludes the FERPA in the Stanford Bulletin within the
"Academic Policies and Statements" section.
Resident Assistants and HPACs alike maintain that
no such disclosure of records ever takes place.
"In our training."said senior Jcnna Boiler, the HPAC
in I\vain,"We were never taught how to view other peo
ple's grades. I don't have any special login to Axess."
Senior David Louk.an RAin TVancos, concurred.
"RAs don't know anything about how well residents
do in their courses," he said.
Boiler said that the voluntary sign-up sheets in her
dorm lounge — posted to help students find classmates
to studv with — are the only way she can see in which

classes her residents are
enrolled.
Sophomore Jennifer
Sloat. who lived in Don
ner her freshman year,
had a lurking suspicion
that her RAs were not
totally uninformed.
"Last year. I had
some feeling my RAs
knew my grades," Sloat
recalled. "But it was no
big deal. I was just like,
'whatever.'"
But what really trou
bled Sloat was that she
felt as if her RAs "com
peted over who had the
smartest floor."

"Last year, I had
some feeling my
RAs knew my
grades... [RAs]
competed over who
had the smartest
floor."

Many more students have voiced their concerns that
FERPA seems to be violated, or at least impinged, when
non-University officials — such as HPACs and RAs —
have access to a student's record.
"It's just not a good idea." said sophomore Casey
Carter, who acknowledged that while a well-intentioned
HPAC may want to check on a student's progress, it is
hard to "imagine having your RA come up to you and
say.'So. I hear you didn't do so hot in your chem class.' I'd
just be like,' Get out of my face.'"
Junior Casey Irvin added,"RAs are your peers; they
shouldn't see our transcripts or anything like that."
While transcripts show only courses and grades re
ceived. some students are concerned other official Uni
versity student records may reveal different sensitive in
formation, such as financial aid standing.
