## Univ. receives Steinbeck Nobel medal Author's medallion to be added to Green archives 
### DEBORAH SOHN 
John Steinbeck may have died 37 years
ago, but his legacy as a great American
writer lives on — especially with regards to
Stanford's recent acquisition of his Nobel
Prize gold medallion. The medallion, which
was given to Steinbeck upon receipt of the
1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, was recent
ly donated to Stanford University Li
braries.
Steinbeck, the author most famous for
"The Grapes of Wrath," was enrolled as a
student at Stanford University from 1919 to
1925, although he never graduated. Accord
ing to William McPheron, librarian for Spe
cial Collections, "he is certainly the most fa
mous author associated with the University."
The gold medallion was given to Stanford
fora number of reasons.
"We have had very good working rela
tionships with members of the Steinbeck
family, and the family and estate seem to un
derstand that Stanford will both preserve
those materials and make them available to
scholars and students," said Andrew
Herkovic, director of communications and
development.
It was at the request of Elaine Steinbeck
— the author's wife — that the medallion
was given to the University.
"It came to us at her explicit wish that it be
joined with the other materials here as a
monument to Steinbeck's career,"
McPheron said.
After leaving Stanford in 1925, Steinbeck
went to New York in hopes of establishing
himself as a writer. After a few unsuccessful
years, however, he returned to California,
where his career in writing eventually began.
In addition to "The Grapes of Wrath," for
which he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940,
Steinbeck also wrote many other successful
novels and short stories, including "Of Mice
and Men" (1937), "The Pearl" (1947) and
"East of Eden" (1952). His works generally
dealt with the social and economic issues of
rural America.
Since Steinbeck's death in 1968, "the li
brary has made a conscientious effort to col
lect rare books and manuscripts associated
to him," McPheron said. Although the Stan

ford libraries do not hold many artifacts
other than the recently acquired medallion,it
does have a considerable collection of Stein
beck archives.
"Our Department of Special Collections
has the largest and most significant archive of
Steinbeck archival materials," Herkovic said.
have a comprehensive collection of
his first editions; we have a lot of photo
graphs, both of him and his family going back
several generations, and we have thousands
of letters by him, as well as many manuscripts
of his books and short stories," McPheron ex
plained. "Uiey are testimony to his life and
career."
Among this large collection are the
"framed certificates of the Nobel award...as
well as the text of Steinbeck's acceptance
speech," Herkovic said. "These have a great
deal more direct scholarly value than the
medal itself."
As a lone physical object, the medallion
does not have extensive research value and
will be kept "as an adjunct to the research
archive collections," said Herkovic. "We will
display it in conjunction with future exhibits
of Steinbeck's archives and works."
However, Herkovic also noted, "I do not
think it will be on permanent display, there

being no particularly good place or reason
for doing so."
Although the medal does not have re
search value per se, it does have "collector
market value," he added.
"The Steinbeck medal is a fine way to re
mind people of the other Steinbeck materials
we house — so it has value to us as an em
blem or token of the research collection it
adorns," he said. "And if someone visits
Green Library to see the medal, but then
finds other materials of research interest,
then the medal will be a means of fulfilling
our educational mission."
At the Nobel Prize Banquet in 1962,
Steinbeck said, "In my heart there may be
doubt that I deserve the Nobel award over
other men of letters whom I hold in respect
and reverence — but there is no question of
my pleasure and pride in having it for my
self."
Similar sentiments are felt at Stanford
today as the library accepts the medallion
into its collection.
The Steinbeck archives are located in the
Department of Special Collections at Green
Library, a place that "has a million stories,"
according to Herkovic. "I recommend you
visit sometime."

writer lives on — especially with regards to
Stanford's recent acquisition of his Nobel
Prize gold medallion. The medallion, which
was given to Steinbeck upon receipt of the
1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, was recent
ly donated to Stanford University Li
braries.
Steinbeck, the author most famous for
"The Grapes of Wrath," was enrolled as a
student at Stanford University from 1919 to
1925, although he never graduated. Accord
ing to William McPheron, librarian for Spe
cial Collections, "he is certainly the most fa
mous author associated with the University."
The gold medallion was given to Stanford
fora number of reasons.
"We have had very good working rela
tionships with members of the Steinbeck
family, and the family and estate seem to un
derstand that Stanford will both preserve
those materials and make them available to
scholars and students," said Andrew
Herkovic, director of communications and
development.
It was at the request of Elaine Steinbeck
— the author's wife — that the medallion
was given to the University.
"It came to us at her explicit wish that it be
joined with the other materials here as a
monument to Steinbeck's career,"
McPheron said.
After leaving Stanford in 1925, Steinbeck
went to New York in hopes of establishing
himself as a writer. After a few unsuccessful
years, however, he returned to California,
where his career in writing eventually began.
In addition to "The Grapes of Wrath," for
which he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940,
Steinbeck also wrote many other successful
novels and short stories, including "Of Mice
and Men" (1937), "The Pearl" (1947) and
"East of Eden" (1952). His works generally
dealt with the social and economic issues of
rural America.
Since Steinbeck's death in 1968, "the li
brary has made a conscientious effort to col
lect rare books and manuscripts associated
to him," McPheron said. Although the Stan

ford libraries do not hold many artifacts
other than the recently acquired medallion,it
does have a considerable collection of Stein
beck archives.
"Our Department of Special Collections
has the largest and most significant archive of
Steinbeck archival materials," Herkovic said.
have a comprehensive collection of
his first editions; we have a lot of photo
graphs, both of him and his family going back
several generations, and we have thousands
of letters by him, as well as many manuscripts
of his books and short stories," McPheron ex
plained. "Uiey are testimony to his life and
career."
Among this large collection are the
"framed certificates of the Nobel award...as
well as the text of Steinbeck's acceptance
speech," Herkovic said. "These have a great
deal more direct scholarly value than the
medal itself."
As a lone physical object, the medallion
does not have extensive research value and
will be kept "as an adjunct to the research
archive collections," said Herkovic. "We will
display it in conjunction with future exhibits
of Steinbeck's archives and works."
However, Herkovic also noted, "I do not
think it will be on permanent display, there

being no particularly good place or reason
for doing so."
Although the medal does not have re
search value per se, it does have "collector
market value," he added.
"The Steinbeck medal is a fine way to re
mind people of the other Steinbeck materials
we house — so it has value to us as an em
blem or token of the research collection it
adorns," he said. "And if someone visits
Green Library to see the medal, but then
finds other materials of research interest,
then the medal will be a means of fulfilling
our educational mission."
At the Nobel Prize Banquet in 1962,
Steinbeck said, "In my heart there may be
doubt that I deserve the Nobel award over
other men of letters whom I hold in respect
and reverence — but there is no question of
my pleasure and pride in having it for my
self."
Similar sentiments are felt at Stanford
today as the library accepts the medallion
into its collection.
The Steinbeck archives are located in the
Department of Special Collections at Green
Library, a place that "has a million stories,"
according to Herkovic. "I recommend you
visit sometime."
