## Road trip gives job insight 
### JENNIFER MARTINEZ STAFF WRITER 
On the way to Chemistry 33 last spring
quarter, a green Road Trip Nation RV
parked in the Oval caught the attention of
then-freshman human biology major Will
Rogers. After attending the road trip infor
mation session presented by the Career
Development Center later that evening,
Rogers was inspired by the group's philos
ophy.
"Last summer was a summer when I
couldn't get into some internship in [a par
ticular] career," Rogers said two nights ago
at the CDC-sponsored presentation on
Road Trip Nation, a program that helps
students figure out which career path they
want to take. "I tried, [but] I couldn't make
myself fill out an application for something
I didn't believe in. Road Trip Nation was
something I could believe in simply be
cause it was an opportunity to find what I
want to believe in."
Thanks to a grant Rogers received from
the program, two months later he and a
high school friend packed up his mom's
SUV and headed out on a five-city journey
around Texas to listen to the career success
stories of various business professionals.
During his road trip throughout the state,
Rogers had the opportunity to interview
Texas musician Jerry Jeff Walker, the
founder of http://www.naughtysecre
taryclub.com and Telecom.
Road Trip Nation is a movement found
ed in 2001 by three college graduates who
decided that they had no idea what they
wanted to do in the future career. Dis
mayed by their peers' aspirations to enter
into the typical fields of finance, medicine
and law, the three friends decided to go on
a road trip across the nation in a clunky
1985 RV to interview 80 U.S. business lead
ers.
What began as an innocent endeavor to
speak to business professionals about their
love for their careers,soon spawned into an
annual PBS documentary series, nationally
sold book and student movement across
100 partner college campuses.
Two nights ago at the CDC, representa
tives from Road Trip Nation presented
their personal experiences from their ad
ventures to inspire students to apply for
grants through the program and take their
own journeys.
"You don't have to have it all figured
out at 23 or 25," said Road Trip Nation rep
resentative Carmen Schmidt. A graduate
of UC-Irvine, Schmidt was looking for her
career path after she left a job with the
Princeton Review. After taking her own
road trip, Schmidt became passionate
about Road Trip Nation's philosophy and

mission. She has not left the program since.
"When you're in the workplace, you all
start to think the same and you get stag
nant in your life," she said. "You all take the
same freeway to get to work...do you ever
take a different route?"
The Road Trip Nation program offers
grants to college students to travel the na
tion and get details about fields they are in
terested in straight from the mouths of in
dustry leaders.
The interviews are conducted in hopes
that students will decide which career
paths they intend to pursue. Past inter
views have included Stanford alumni San
dra Day O'Connor, Rudolph Messenger,
head of recruitment of UNICEF, the Chief
Executive Officer of Dell computers,
Michael Dell and the Vice President of
marketing for Burton Snowboards, Bill
Schriber.
"Road Trip Nation is about following
your passion," Schmidt said. "Life doesn't
have to be like 'Office Space.'"
United Kingdom native Matt Maude
was able to participate in Road Trip Na
tion's Behind the Wheel program, which
consisted of a seven-week journey across
the US. to be shown as a documentary on
PBS.
"There's always a huge pressure from
everybody," Maude said. "[From] your par
ents, your friends. As soon as you leave col
lege you have to find immediate success, a
life [that's mostly] based on money."
Far from his hometown in Settle, York
shire, Maude was able to speak with the
head of Marvel Comics and the former
head of NASA.
"I was always interested in film-making,
directing, editing," he said. "But I wanted
to speak to people who interested me. I
wanted to speak to an astronaut because
I'll never be one."
The CDC's endorsement of Road TVip
Nation is an attempt to encourage Stan
ford students to step back and discover a
path they can be passionate about.
"Our staff believed in the idea of getting
students to go out and connect with people
in the world of work," said CDC career
counselor Marlene Scherer Stern. "It's the
norm to be confused about what you want
to do, and it's easy to think you're the only
one who feels that way."
Scherer said she hopes that the presen
tation two nights ago will help spread the
word about Road Trip Nation to Stanford
students and that more will be inspired to
apply for their own grants.
"[lt's] not just about investment bank
ing and consulting, the majority of students
aren't doing that," Scherer said. "That's the
vocal minority, but the silent majority
aren't doing that."

What began as an innocent endeavor to
speak to business professionals about their
love for their careers,soon spawned into an
annual PBS documentary series, nationally
sold book and student movement across
100 partner college campuses.
Two nights ago at the CDC, representa
tives from Road Trip Nation presented
their personal experiences from their ad
ventures to inspire students to apply for
grants through the program and take their
own journeys.
"You don't have to have it all figured
out at 23 or 25," said Road Trip Nation rep
resentative Carmen Schmidt. A graduate
of UC-Irvine, Schmidt was looking for her
career path after she left a job with the
Princeton Review. After taking her own
road trip, Schmidt became passionate
about Road Trip Nation's philosophy and

mission. She has not left the program since.
"When you're in the workplace, you all
start to think the same and you get stag
nant in your life," she said. "You all take the
same freeway to get to work...do you ever
take a different route?"
The Road Trip Nation program offers
grants to college students to travel the na
tion and get details about fields they are in
terested in straight from the mouths of in
dustry leaders.
The interviews are conducted in hopes
that students will decide which career
paths they intend to pursue. Past inter
views have included Stanford alumni San
dra Day O'Connor, Rudolph Messenger,
head of recruitment of UNICEF, the Chief
Executive Officer of Dell computers,
Michael Dell and the Vice President of
marketing for Burton Snowboards, Bill
Schriber.
"Road Trip Nation is about following
your passion," Schmidt said. "Life doesn't
have to be like 'Office Space.'"
United Kingdom native Matt Maude
was able to participate in Road Trip Na
tion's Behind the Wheel program, which
consisted of a seven-week journey across
the US. to be shown as a documentary on
PBS.
"There's always a huge pressure from
everybody," Maude said. "[From] your par
ents, your friends. As soon as you leave col
lege you have to find immediate success, a
life [that's mostly] based on money."
Far from his hometown in Settle, York
shire, Maude was able to speak with the
head of Marvel Comics and the former
head of NASA.
"I was always interested in film-making,
directing, editing," he said. "But I wanted
to speak to people who interested me. I
wanted to speak to an astronaut because
I'll never be one."
The CDC's endorsement of Road TVip
Nation is an attempt to encourage Stan
ford students to step back and discover a
path they can be passionate about.
"Our staff believed in the idea of getting
students to go out and connect with people
in the world of work," said CDC career
counselor Marlene Scherer Stern. "It's the
norm to be confused about what you want
to do, and it's easy to think you're the only
one who feels that way."
Scherer said she hopes that the presen
tation two nights ago will help spread the
word about Road Trip Nation to Stanford
students and that more will be inspired to
apply for their own grants.
"[lt's] not just about investment bank
ing and consulting, the majority of students
aren't doing that," Scherer said. "That's the
vocal minority, but the silent majority
aren't doing that."
On the way to Chemistry 33 last spring
quarter, a green Road Trip Nation RV
parked in the Oval caught the attention of
then-freshman human biology major Will
Rogers. After attending the road trip infor
mation session presented by the Career
Development Center later that evening,
Rogers was inspired by the group's philos
ophy.
"Last summer was a summer when I
couldn't get into some internship in [a par
ticular] career," Rogers said two nights ago
at the CDC-sponsored presentation on
Road Trip Nation, a program that helps
students figure out which career path they
want to take. "I tried, [but] I couldn't make
myself fill out an application for something
I didn't believe in. Road Trip Nation was
something I could believe in simply be
cause it was an opportunity to find what I
want to believe in."
Thanks to a grant Rogers received from
the program, two months later he and a
high school friend packed up his mom's
SUV and headed out on a five-city journey
around Texas to listen to the career success
stories of various business professionals.
During his road trip throughout the state,
Rogers had the opportunity to interview
Texas musician Jerry Jeff Walker, the
founder of http://www.naughtysecre
taryclub.com and Telecom.
Road Trip Nation is a movement found
ed in 2001 by three college graduates who
decided that they had no idea what they
wanted to do in the future career. Dis
mayed by their peers' aspirations to enter
into the typical fields of finance, medicine
and law, the three friends decided to go on
a road trip across the nation in a clunky
1985 RV to interview 80 U.S. business lead
ers.
