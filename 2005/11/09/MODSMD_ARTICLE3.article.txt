## Calif. votes against all eight props Schwarzenegger takes a hit as sponsored props all fail 
### AMIT ARORA 
With closely-contested campaigns on a number
of propositions, Stanford students may be sur
prised to learn that all of the California special
election initiatives have failed. Groups on campus
have been active in their support or opposition of
the ballot proposals over past months, and reac
tions to these results were varied.
The Stanford Democrats and Students for
Choice spent the night intently watching elec
tion reporting at the LGBT-CRC Center. Junior

described her enthusi
asm about the failure of
Proposition 73, regard
ing parental notifica
tion before a minor's
abortion.
"It's been really en
couraging here on cam
pus," she said. "In the last
couple of months we have
tabled, posted fliers and
phone-banked. We called
1.5(X) registered women
in San Jose and Santa
Clara Counties that were
'declined to state' or non
partisan and encouraged
them to vote. I'm glad
there has been reception
in California against the
initiative."
Sophomore Mishan
Araujo from Students for
Choice described the or
ganization's voter educa
tion efforts.
"We had a panel on
gender and power in pol
itics sponsored by Cam
pus Progress," she said.
"Our panelists included a
representative from
Planned Parenthood and
a director of research at
UC-San Francisco."
Sophomore Margot
Isman, president of the
Stanford Democrats,
shared the excitement of
Students for Choice mem
bers and referred to the
outcome as "a victory for
the state of California."
"1 am very excited,"
she said. "The election re
sults prove that you can
not attack public service
for political gains. Califor
nians will not stand for it."
However, Isman re
mained wary of the long
term significance of the
election results.
"A year is an eternity
in politics," she said. "The
close nature of this elec
tion means there is a fight
to be fought in 2006.
There are real issues that
have to be dealt with in
California."
The Stanford College
Republicans also looked
toward the future and
were not too disappoint
ed by the failure of sever
al initiatives in the elec
tion.

election was a close one," said junior Mark Grimal
di, executive director of the College Republicans.
" It indicates to me that Californians do feel strong
ly about these reforms."
Grimaldi remarked on the activism of the
College Republicans before the election as well
as their efforts to attract people to the polling
booths.
"We held community walks, made sure people
