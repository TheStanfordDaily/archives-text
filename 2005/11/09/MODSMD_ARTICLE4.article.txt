## "My goal is to continue a successful program and maintain a presence at the cutting edge of intercollegiate sports." Sports management legend ready to take Stanford's reins 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
- BILL WALSH

Hall of Fame coach and gen
eral manager of three Super
Bowl-winning San Francisco
49ers squads. Bill Walsh will be
playing a more active role with
Stanford Athletics come January
as the department's interim di
rector. Stanford students know
Walsh a little better than most
other Bay Area 49ers fans, as he
led the Cardinal to three bowl
victories during his 1977-1978
and 1992-1994 seasons as the
Cardinal's football coach.
Stanford announced last
week that Walsh would tem
porarily fill Ted Leland's vacated
position. Since stepping down
from coaching football, Walsh
has been an active member of
the Stanford community. He was
hired in March 2004 as an assis
tant to Ted Leland and has
served as a lecturer at the Grad
uate School of Business.
Beginning in January, Walsh
will strive to maintain the level
of athletic excellence Stanford
has achieved during Leland's 14-
year directorship.

"My goal is to continue a suc
cessful program and to maintain a
presence at the cutting edge of in
tercollegiate sports" Walsh said
in an interview with The Daily.
"'lTie Athletics Department cur
rently has 250 employees work
ing towards this goal. My focus
will be to manage a large group of
people and keep everyone fo
cused on the role they play. I am
also looking forward to serving as
a counsel to the athletes."
According to Walsh, he and
Ted Leland have a history dating
hack to the 19705, during Walsh's
first coaching campaign at Stan
ford.
"Leland worked with me in
the late '70s while he was a grad
student here at Stanford." Walsh v
said. "He helped coach on our
staff. Since then, we've been col
leagues and good friends. Our
management style is very much
alike."
Many feel that Stanford has
made the right decision in choos
ing Walsh to step temporarily
into Leland's shoes while a
search committee looks fora
permanent replacement.
Chuck Evans, a former Stan
ford football player under
Walsh, praised the decision.
Evans was recently inducted into
the Stanford Athletics Hall of

Fame Class of 2005. He played at
Stanford from 1976 to 1979, and was
a three-year starter as a defensive
tackle. After a brilliant senior year
which saw him earn All-American
honors and finish among the top in
career tackles for the Cardinal,
Evans was drafted by the New Or
leans Saints.
"Bill is the most accomplished
administrator in all of athletics,"
Evans said in an interview with The
Daily. "He understands Stanford
and knows what it takes to be suc
cessful in major sports. There is a
reason why he is the most sought
after figure in athletic manage
ment."
There is also hope among Cardi

nal community members that
Walsh's excellent background will
serve to benefit Stanford's current
football program.
"Football is in need of more top
caliber players, and Walsh under
stands the type of student athlete
that can succeed here," Evans said.
"He has an affinity for Stanford Uni
versity. He is the only coach in 65
years to win 10 games [in a season]."
Walsh expressed enthusiasm
about providing support for the
Cardinal football team.
"I am currently well-acquainted
with the coaches," Walsh said. "The
football program is in good hands
with Walt Harris. I root for them
passionately. They've done well for
us so far this year. I look forward to
upcoming winter and spring sport
ing events as well."
Sophomore Ray Jones, a running
back for the Cardinal, was positive
about Walsh's new role.

"Bill Walsh is one of the greatest
minds in sports," he said. "His expe
rience will pay dividends for our
athletic program."
Once Walsh begins serving as
the interim athletic director, he
does not expect to be involved with
the search committee to find a per
manent director. His main focus
will be to manage and maintain
Stanford's athletic programs. In ad
dition. his position at the Graduate
School of Business will be reduced
from full- to part-time lecturer.
"I look forward to my new role
here at the University," Walsh said.
"I served as president and general
manager of the 49ers for 10 years.
This management experience gives
me a broad base of skills. I've also
been in the arena of managing peo
ple under stress and competition,
having served as head coach both
here at Stanford and with the
49ers."

Evans was drafted by the New Or
leans Saints.
"Bill is the most accomplished
administrator in all of athletics,"
Evans said in an interview with The
Daily. "He understands Stanford
and knows what it takes to be suc
cessful in major sports. There is a
reason why he is the most sought
after figure in athletic manage
ment."
There is also hope among Cardi

nal community members that
Walsh's excellent background will
serve to benefit Stanford's current
football program.
"Football is in need of more top
caliber players, and Walsh under
stands the type of student athlete
that can succeed here," Evans said.
"He has an affinity for Stanford Uni
versity. He is the only coach in 65
years to win 10 games [in a season]."
Walsh expressed enthusiasm
about providing support for the
Cardinal football team.
"I am currently well-acquainted
with the coaches," Walsh said. "The
football program is in good hands
with Walt Harris. I root for them
passionately. They've done well for
us so far this year. I look forward to
upcoming winter and spring sport
ing events as well."
Sophomore Ray Jones, a running
back for the Cardinal, was positive
about Walsh's new role.

"Bill Walsh is one of the greatest
minds in sports," he said. "His expe
rience will pay dividends for our
athletic program."
Once Walsh begins serving as
the interim athletic director, he
does not expect to be involved with
the search committee to find a per
manent director. His main focus
will be to manage and maintain
Stanford's athletic programs. In ad
dition. his position at the Graduate
School of Business will be reduced
from full- to part-time lecturer.
"I look forward to my new role
here at the University," Walsh said.
"I served as president and general
manager of the 49ers for 10 years.
This management experience gives
me a broad base of skills. I've also
been in the arena of managing peo
ple under stress and competition,
having served as head coach both
here at Stanford and with the
49ers."

Hall of Fame coach and gen
eral manager of three Super
Bowl-winning San Francisco
49ers squads. Bill Walsh will be
playing a more active role with
Stanford Athletics come January
as the department's interim di
rector. Stanford students know
Walsh a little better than most
other Bay Area 49ers fans, as he
led the Cardinal to three bowl
victories during his 1977-1978
and 1992-1994 seasons as the
Cardinal's football coach.
Stanford announced last
week that Walsh would tem
porarily fill Ted Leland's vacated
position. Since stepping down
from coaching football, Walsh
has been an active member of
the Stanford community. He was
hired in March 2004 as an assis
tant to Ted Leland and has
served as a lecturer at the Grad

Beginning in January, Walsh
will strive to maintain the level
of athletic excellence Stanford
has achieved during Leland's 14-
year directorship.

"My goal is to continue a suc
cessful program and to maintain a
presence at the cutting edge of in
tercollegiate sports" Walsh said
in an interview with The Daily.
"'lTie Athletics Department cur
rently has 250 employees work

will be to manage a large group of
people and keep everyone fo
cused on the role they play. I am
also looking forward to serving as
a counsel to the athletes."

Ted Leland have a history dating

first coaching campaign at Stan

the late '70s while he was a grad
student here at Stanford." Walsh v
said. "He helped coach on our
staff. Since then, we've been col
leagues and good friends. Our
management style is very much
alike."
Many feel that Stanford has
made the right decision in choos
ing Walsh to step temporarily
into Leland's shoes while a
search committee looks fora
permanent replacement.
Chuck Evans, a former Stan
ford football player under
Walsh, praised the decision.
