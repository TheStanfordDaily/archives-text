Hall of Fame coach and gen
eral manager of three Super
Bowl-winning San Francisco
49ers squads. Bill Walsh will be
playing a more active role with
Stanford Athletics come January
as the department's interim di
rector. Stanford students know
Walsh a little better than most
other Bay Area 49ers fans, as he
led the Cardinal to three bowl
victories during his 1977-1978
and 1992-1994 seasons as the
Cardinal's football coach.
Stanford announced last
week that Walsh would tem
porarily fill Ted Leland's vacated
position. Since stepping down
from coaching football, Walsh
has been an active member of
the Stanford community. He was
hired in March 2004 as an assis
tant to Ted Leland and has
served as a lecturer at the Grad
uate School of Business.
Beginning in January, Walsh
will strive to maintain the level
of athletic excellence Stanford
has achieved during Leland's 14-
year directorship.

"My goal is to continue a suc
cessful program and to maintain a
presence at the cutting edge of in
tercollegiate sports" Walsh said
in an interview with The Daily.
"'lTie Athletics Department cur
rently has 250 employees work
ing towards this goal. My focus
will be to manage a large group of
people and keep everyone fo
cused on the role they play. I am
also looking forward to serving as
a counsel to the athletes."
According to Walsh, he and
Ted Leland have a history dating
hack to the 19705, during Walsh's
first coaching campaign at Stan
ford.
"Leland worked with me in
the late '70s while he was a grad
student here at Stanford." Walsh v
said. "He helped coach on our
staff. Since then, we've been col
leagues and good friends. Our
management style is very much
alike."
Many feel that Stanford has
made the right decision in choos
ing Walsh to step temporarily
into Leland's shoes while a
search committee looks fora
permanent replacement.
Chuck Evans, a former Stan
ford football player under
Walsh, praised the decision.
Evans was recently inducted into
the Stanford Athletics Hall of
