# Senator proposes extension of Green hours
## 
### ANURADHA SIVARAM 
With midterms and projects due before
Thanksgiving break and finals just around
the corner, students searching for late-night
studying options may just be in luck. ASSU
Undergraduate Senator Brittany Clark, a
sophomore, met with Cheryl McGrath, a
Green Library representative, on Nov. 3 to
propose an extension of Green Library's
hours. Currently, Green closes at 6 p.m. on
Fridays. Clark said she hopes that adminis
trators will agree to keep the library open

until 10 p.m. on Fridays, in what would be the
first step toward keeping the library open
later on the weekdays as well.
"I went in with these major concerns,"
Clark said. "First, students wanted to see
Green Library open for more hours during
the week, especially on Friday.They like the
environment and the research opportunities
there; Meyer doesn't have that. Therefore,
students would want to go for both the com
fort and for the educational value."
Clark said she believes administrators as
sume students wouldn't go to the library on

Friday evenings, because they would want to
go out instead. However,she argued that stu
dents actually like going to the library to
study before getting ready to go out.
"I talked with Cheryl McGrath, who said
she was very happy that I came to her with
these concerns," Clark said. "She said that
though others have talked to her about
changing library hours, many didn't come to
her with the proper approach. She had con
ducted a survey of students two years ago
library
may extend hours

during Dead Week, and the results showed that
students would frequent the library more on
Friday evenings."
While McGrath seemed supportive of the
proposal, there still may be budget issues stand
ing in Clark's way.
"[McGrath] said that in order for the library
to stay open, there needs to be three staff mem
bers; one of them needs to be a union member,"
Clark said. "They are short on budget, though, so
if the proposal doesn't pass it would most likely
be because of an outside factor like budget is
sues."
No decision has been made yet as to whether
or not the library will extend its hours. Clark
plans to submit a new budget proposal within
the next two weeks that would aim to solve the
library's logistical problems.
Clark said that she came up with the propos
al because of her own thoughts and other stu
dents' concerns.
"I enjoy going to Green,"she said."But I did
n't like having to leave at 12 a.m. when it
closed."
Clark also explained that she heard other
students express similar opinions during her
ASSU office hours and in advocacy committee
meetings, where members talked about a pro
posal and "thought it deserved our attention."
Freshman Anita Verma said she would ap
prove of any extension of Green's hours.
"If Green and Meyer had the same hours, 1
would study at Green because there are more
alcoves and little corners in which to study, as
opposed to Meyer where you're in one room
surrounded by computer screens," she said.
"Meyer just has a more impersonal feeling."
Clark said that though McGrath was "very
enthusiastic" about her proposal, there has yet
to be an indication whether there will be any ul
timate changes. McGrath said that she will meet
with Green Library's supervisor soon, but until
then, the only time during which the library will
have extended hours is Dead Week.
