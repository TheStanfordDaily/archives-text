### ANURADHA SIVARAM 
With midterms and projects due before
Thanksgiving break and finals just around
the corner, students searching for late-night
studying options may just be in luck. ASSU
Undergraduate Senator Brittany Clark, a
sophomore, met with Cheryl McGrath, a
Green Library representative, on Nov. 3 to
propose an extension of Green Library's
hours. Currently, Green closes at 6 p.m. on
Fridays. Clark said she hopes that adminis
trators will agree to keep the library open

until 10 p.m. on Fridays, in what would be the
first step toward keeping the library open
later on the weekdays as well.
"I went in with these major concerns,"
Clark said. "First, students wanted to see
Green Library open for more hours during
the week, especially on Friday.They like the
environment and the research opportunities
there; Meyer doesn't have that. Therefore,
students would want to go for both the com
fort and for the educational value."
Clark said she believes administrators as
sume students wouldn't go to the library on

Friday evenings, because they would want to
go out instead. However,she argued that stu
dents actually like going to the library to
study before getting ready to go out.
"I talked with Cheryl McGrath, who said
she was very happy that I came to her with
these concerns," Clark said. "She said that
though others have talked to her about
changing library hours, many didn't come to
her with the proper approach. She had con
ducted a survey of students two years ago
