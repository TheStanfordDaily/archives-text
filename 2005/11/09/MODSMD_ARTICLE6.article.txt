## Sigma Chi raises funds for renovations 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR WRITER 
From the producers of Cowabunga.the Graf
fitti Party and Derby Days comes a new kind of
event—call it Sigma Chi —The Capital Im
provement Fundraiser.
Sigma Chi, the only Greek house owned by
its members — and. along with the co-op Chi
Theta Chi, one of only two non-University
owned residences on campus — faces the chal
lenge of raising $2.5 million to complete essen
tial structural upgrades or risk losing its claim on
the house.

In an effort to raise $2.5 million for renovations and retrofitting, Sigma Chi threw a noon
kickoff barbeque yesterday on the house's front porch attended by the Band.
The campaign began about three
years ago, back when today's seniors
had not even begun to think about
rushing. University administrators
told the house's then-leadership that
they had to comply with certain
structural upgrades — including
earthquake retrofitting — as part of
the University's Capital Improve
ment Plan (CIP), an ongoing proj-

ect begun in 1993 to eventually

make all residences earth-

quake-proof and up-to-

code.

"Stanford came to

us three years ago

and said, 'You've
got to renovate
your house 1
just like every-

body else,"' said

Sigma Chi alumnus

Bob Ottilie, Class of

1977, a trial lawyer from

San Diego who is heading up

the fundraising efforts. "The

University trustees committed
hundreds of millions of dollars to
their CIP program after the earth
quake in 1989 — literally, they're
renovating every residence on cam
pus."
When administrators gave the
fraternity the opportunity to hand
back the title and save themselves
the time and effort of raising $2.5
million, fraternity members chose to
take up the challenge.
"The entire house unanimously
voted [in 2002] to fight to save the
house," Ottilie said.
The $5 million house, which was
built in 1939 by Sigma Chi members
and has been in the fraternity's
hands since, must raise around $2.5
million for upgrades — including
$600,000 worth of earthquake retro
fitting — by next summer. Fundrais
ers have already secured $1.6 million

in pledges, including about $625,000
in promises from current residents
and recent graduates.
Looking forward to the next
$900,000, Ottilie and current Sigma
Chi President Kunal Gullapalli, a
senior, hosted a fundraising kickoff
barbecue at lunchtime yesterday on
the front porch of the house. In front
of dozens of red-and-white balloons
and a high-tech sound system, cur
rent residents and a smattering of
alumni bobbed their heads to the
acoustic antics of the Stanford band
and enjoyed hamburgers. A giant
novelty thermometer, its red mercu-

ry hovering at $1.6 million.

recorded the progress of the

chapter's efforts.

"Kunal and the
guys were optimistic.

so they've got a $3

[million mark] up

there at the top
of the ther
mometer," Ottilie

said during his re-

marks.

"1 really like

Sigma Chi," said fifth-year

student Erin Lashnits, better

known as the Tree, who per-

formed with two Dollies and a num
ber of musicians. "I think they've got
a great house, and they contribute a
lot to the University. I heart Sigma
Chi."
Of course, the hard work put in
by residents and alumni isn't just
about hard cash. It has the pleasant
side effect, according to Ottilie and
Gullapalli, of forging connections
between alumni and currents resi
dents.
"We've always had pretty strong
alumni and good connections, and
now it's really been organized and
led to a lot of other things, like a job
recruiting program," Gullapalli said.
"And having that more organized di
mension is what's going to allow us
to raise more money, and the process
of raising the money makes the con
nections stronger. It's kind of a
chicken or the egg thing."
