## Senate aims to revive legal aid Groups in need of funding face a filled senate schedule 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
ITic ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate tackled various issues at last
night's meeting related to student
use of legal counseling services and
the possibility of reestablishing the
Friday shuttle to the AMC Merca
do theaters, among others.
l"he number of students seeking
legal counseling is down, reported
Senate Communications Chair
Rong Xu. a junior. Undergraduates
only account for about 30 percent
of the services' patronage. The of
fice that offers these services gener
ally helps students with cases in
volving tort law. negligence and
traffic violations. It can help them
draw up wills as well. Those in
charge of the services said they
have considered meeting with fra
ternity and sorority leaders to in
crease the office's undergraduate
traffic.
Next, Appropriations Chair
Faris Mohiuddin, a junior, ex
plained that many student groups
claim to be in desperate need of
funding this quarter. However, due
to the limited number of interview
spots open for group leaders to
make their cases, many of these
groups may not be able to receive
the monies they are requesting. The
Senators said they are currently
strategizing ways to maximize the
number of interview slots, as well as
the amount of funding available.
"Out of fairness to promote op
portunity for groups, we have to be
stricter with the groups that have
funding now," Mohiuddin said.
"Every group should at least have
the chance to get funding."
During a recent meeting devot
ed to parking and transportation is
sues, undergraduates present ex
pressed interest in reinstating the
free movie shuttle that used to
transport 50 to 100 students to the
AMC Mercado theaters every Fri
day between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m.
While the Office of Student Ac
tivities previously funded the shut
tle service, it can no longer afford
to do so. The Senate pitched ways
to raise the money necessary to
bring back the service and consid
ered whether or not there would be
enough interested freshmen to
make it worthwhile. Senator

Macarrin Morton, a junior, said
that a funding proposal is currently
in the works and will be presented
to administrators upon its comple
tion.
The Senate also discussed chang
ing dinnertime dining hall hours —
currently set at 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at
most facilities —to accommodate
athletes who miss dinner due to af
ternoon practices, as well as other
students who have classes sched
uled during these times.
•Campus Advocacy Chair An
drew Hendel. a senior, suggested
combining student contact informa
tion stored by Information Technol
ogy Systems and Services (ITSS)
and the University Registrar's Of
fice to produce a more comprehen
sive student directory.
"ITSS has a way to match rooms
to phone numbers, while the Regis
trar's Office through Housing can
match names to rooms," explained
Deputy Senate Chair Danny Ar
beiter. a sophomore. "No one can
map names to phone numbers yet,
so we're trying to bridge the gap. so
this information can be published
on Stanfordwho.stanford.edu and
in the Stanford Directory."
The Senate is also deliberating
the possibility of extending Friday
hours for Green Library from 6
p.m. to 10 p.m. A survey conducted
two years ago showed that more
students use the library during Fri
day extended hours than previously
thought, and many will often study
before going out at night.
