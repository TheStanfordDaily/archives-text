## Fujimori charged with corruption Former Peruvian president arrested after five years of exile

SANTIAGO, Chile — Former Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori was arrested Monday on charges in
volving corruption and massacres at home as he tried to
return to Peru to run for re-election after five years in
exile in Japan.
Fujimori, target of an international arrest warrant,
now faces extradition from Chile to Peru as people
across the world wonder: What was he thinking?
Some believe he simply miscalculated. Others think
he is confident Chile's Supreme Court will reject his ex
tradition and release him, as it has for other Latin Amer
icans who have sought political refuge.
Police arrested Fujimori, 67, at his Santiago hotel
hours after his surprise arrival Sunday and took him to
the investigative police academy. The arrest was ordered
after the Peruvian government told Chile it would make
a formal request for Fujimori's extradition.
He asked to be granted provisional freedom during
the extradition proceedings.
Later Monday, Fujimori was transferred to a training
academy for corrections officers. He smiled at reporters,
responding to shouted questions by waving his hand and
giving a thumbs-up sign.
Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo thanked Chile
for "taking this first step" by arresting the fugitive leader.
Fujimori fled to Japan in November 2000 as his 10-year au
tocratic government crumbled amid corruption scandals. He
faces 21 charges ranging from abuse of power and corruption to
sanctioning a paramilitary death squad accused of two mas
sacres of suspected rebel collaborators in which 25 people were
killed, including an 8-year-old boy.
Peruvian prosecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence
and a $28.6 million fine for his alleged role in the death
squad killings, the most serious charge he faces.
Fujimori had long vowed to return to Peru to seek a
fourth presidential term in April's election despite the
charges, and a congressional ruling barring him from
holding public office until 2011.
He remains popular with some Peruvians for leading
an economic rebound in the early 1990s and crippling the

Shining Path rebels who terrorized the country for years.
His construction of schools, roads and potable water sys
tems also won him a strong following among the poor.
He had support as high as 30 percent in voter prefer
ence polls last year, putting him among Peru's favorites,
until pollsters decided to drop his name since Congress had
banned him in 2001 from holding public office for 10 years.
Peruvian authorities have 60 days to ask for Fujimori's ex
tradition, but they were moving fast. On Monday, Toledo sent a
high-level delegation led by Interior Minister Romulo Pizarro
to try to expedite proceedings in Chile.
The region was left pondering why Fujimori left the
safety of Japan, where he had been granted citizenship as
the son of Japanese parents who immigrated to Peru.
Ricardo Israel, a Chilean political scientist, speculat
ed Fujimori felt Chile's courts would let him stay here
and prepare his comeback bid for Peru's election.
"He knows Chile's Supreme Court almost certainly
wouldn't authorize the extradition of a person with polit
ical prominence," Israel said.
He noted the court last year rejected Argentina's re
quest for the extradition of former President Carlos
Menem. He said the court also refused to extradite an

Argentine publicist accused of running smear campaigns
against Fujimori opponent and a Peruvian newspaper
publisher accused of taking bribes to support him.
Some Peruvians felt Fujimori made a big mistake.
"He miscalculated," said former Foreign Minister Diego
Garcia. "1 do not think he made such a long trip only to be ar
rested in Chile. I don't think he considered that possibility."
Radioprogramas of Peru reported that Fujimori told
a Japanese journalist before he left Tokyo that he didn't
expect to be arrested because Chile and Peru have tense
relations from a dispute over maritime limits.
"It was a very imprudent, irresponsible decision to
come here at this time." said Chilean Foreign Minister
Ignacio Walker.
Walker dismissed suggestions that Fujimori be expelled
from Chile instead of allowing for his extradition to Peru.
"That's impossible now. An administrative decision is
out of the question," Walker said. "The situation is in the
hands of the courts."
President Ricardo Lagos said he did not expect Fuji
mori's arrival to "affect the normal process of our rela
tions" with Peru, including the way the two countries re
solve their dispute over sea boundaries.

Fujimori fled to Japan in November 2000 as his 10-year au
tocratic government crumbled amid corruption scandals. He
faces 21 charges ranging from abuse of power and corruption to
sanctioning a paramilitary death squad accused of two mas
sacres of suspected rebel collaborators in which 25 people were
killed, including an 8-year-old boy.
Peruvian prosecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence
and a $28.6 million fine for his alleged role in the death
squad killings, the most serious charge he faces.
Fujimori had long vowed to return to Peru to seek a
fourth presidential term in April's election despite the
charges, and a congressional ruling barring him from
holding public office until 2011.
He remains popular with some Peruvians for leading
an economic rebound in the early 1990s and crippling the

Shining Path rebels who terrorized the country for years.
His construction of schools, roads and potable water sys
tems also won him a strong following among the poor.
He had support as high as 30 percent in voter prefer
ence polls last year, putting him among Peru's favorites,
until pollsters decided to drop his name since Congress had
banned him in 2001 from holding public office for 10 years.
Peruvian authorities have 60 days to ask for Fujimori's ex
tradition, but they were moving fast. On Monday, Toledo sent a
high-level delegation led by Interior Minister Romulo Pizarro
to try to expedite proceedings in Chile.
The region was left pondering why Fujimori left the
safety of Japan, where he had been granted citizenship as
the son of Japanese parents who immigrated to Peru.
Ricardo Israel, a Chilean political scientist, speculat
ed Fujimori felt Chile's courts would let him stay here
and prepare his comeback bid for Peru's election.
"He knows Chile's Supreme Court almost certainly
wouldn't authorize the extradition of a person with polit
ical prominence," Israel said.
He noted the court last year rejected Argentina's re
quest for the extradition of former President Carlos
Menem. He said the court also refused to extradite an

Argentine publicist accused of running smear campaigns
against Fujimori opponent and a Peruvian newspaper
publisher accused of taking bribes to support him.
Some Peruvians felt Fujimori made a big mistake.
"He miscalculated," said former Foreign Minister Diego
Garcia. "1 do not think he made such a long trip only to be ar
rested in Chile. I don't think he considered that possibility."
Radioprogramas of Peru reported that Fujimori told
a Japanese journalist before he left Tokyo that he didn't
expect to be arrested because Chile and Peru have tense
relations from a dispute over maritime limits.
"It was a very imprudent, irresponsible decision to
come here at this time." said Chilean Foreign Minister
Ignacio Walker.
Walker dismissed suggestions that Fujimori be expelled
from Chile instead of allowing for his extradition to Peru.
"That's impossible now. An administrative decision is
out of the question," Walker said. "The situation is in the
hands of the courts."
President Ricardo Lagos said he did not expect Fuji
mori's arrival to "affect the normal process of our rela
tions" with Peru, including the way the two countries re
solve their dispute over sea boundaries.

SANTIAGO, Chile — Former Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori was arrested Monday on charges in
volving corruption and massacres at home as he tried to
return to Peru to run for re-election after five years in
exile in Japan.
Fujimori, target of an international arrest warrant,
now faces extradition from Chile to Peru as people
across the world wonder: What was he thinking?
Some believe he simply miscalculated. Others think
he is confident Chile's Supreme Court will reject his ex
tradition and release him, as it has for other Latin Amer
icans who have sought political refuge.
Police arrested Fujimori, 67, at his Santiago hotel
hours after his surprise arrival Sunday and took him to
the investigative police academy. The arrest was ordered
after the Peruvian government told Chile it would make
a formal request for Fujimori's extradition.
He asked to be granted provisional freedom during
the extradition proceedings.
Later Monday, Fujimori was transferred to a training
academy for corrections officers. He smiled at reporters,
responding to shouted questions by waving his hand and
giving a thumbs-up sign.
Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo thanked Chile
for "taking this first step" by arresting the fugitive leader.
