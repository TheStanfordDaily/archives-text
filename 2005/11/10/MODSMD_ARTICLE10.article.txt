JACKSBORO.Tenn. (AP) â€” Principal Gary Seale was shot
while wrestling with a student who had opened fire in school and
killed an administrator, then managed to get to the intercom and
order a lockdown, helping to end the rampage, authorities say.
Seale was shot in the lower abdomen and Assistant Principal
Jim Pierce was hit in the chest Tuesday, authorities said. Both were
in serious condition in intensive care at University of Tennessee
Medical Center in Knoxville, spokeswoman Lisa McNeal said.
The administrators and a teacher helped wrestle the gun
away from the 15-year-old student, deputies said. Assistant Prin
cipal Ken Bruce was shot in the chest and died at a LaFollette
hospital, authorities said.
"This situation could have gotten much worse," said Mark
Wells, vice chairman of the Campbell County Board of Educa
tion. "It did not because our staff followed the (emergency)
plan in place."
No students were hurt in Iliesday's shooting at Campbell
County Compehensive High School. The 1,400-student school
about 35 miles northwest of Knoxville was closed for the rest of
the week, officials said.
The suspect. Ken Bartley Jr., was taken to a juvenile deten
tion facility. Sheriff Ron McClellan said. The boy's family de
clined comment.
"He has been in trouble before, but 1 just wouldn't expect
something like this out of him," said classmate Courtney Ward,
17. "He is a big jokester. He is rowdy. But I just couldn't see him
doing this."
Authorities didn't know whether Bartley would be charged
as an adult.They said he was grazed in the hand by a bullet fired
from his own .22-caliber handgun when he was subdued.
"I don't know what he was thinking or what his motives
were," McClellan said. "Investigators are piecing together...
what exactly transpired."
Parents rushed to the school to pick up their children, causing a
massive traffic jam when police closed the campus.
"It is scary, it is terrifying," said Darren Davidson, waiting for
his son, Justin.
Davidson's wife, Kizzie, added: "I thought 1 would have a
heart attack before I got here."
Seale and Pierce have been educators more than 30 years,
said former assistant principal Clifford Kohlmeyer. Bruce had

been a lieutenant colonel in the Army and came back to teach
ing about eight years ago, Kohlmeyer said.
Tuesday's shooting marked the second time this year that a
school employee was fatally shot.
Stewart County school bus driver Joyce Gregory, 47, was
killed as she stopped to pick up a student on her route on
March 1. Jason Clinard, 15. is charged with her slaying and will
be tried as an adult.
In August, a boy was accidentally shot in the leg in a middle
school restroom in Jefferson County. The investigation led to
charges against two students accused in a plot to kill a teacher at
Maury Middle School.
On the Campbell County high school's Web site, Seale wel
comed incoming students, saying the staff would do its best "to
make these four years as safe and enjoyable as possible."
"The next four years will be the best times of your life," he
said. "Many wonderful memories will be made."
