# French riots continue

PARIS (AP) — Authorities in the French
Riviera city of Nice imposed a curfew on minors
and authorized police raids yesterday, and the
nation's interior minister said the government
should deport the 120 foreigners convicted of
crimes during the wave of rioting and unrest.
Looters and vandals defied a state of emer
gency with attacks on superstores, a newspaper
warehouse and a subway station.
The unrest began Oct. 27 and has grown into
a nationwide insurrection by disillusioned sub
urban youths who complain of discrimination
and unemployment.
Although many of the French-born children
of Arab and black African immigrants are Mus
lim. police say the violence is not being driven by
Islamic groups.
The extraordinary 12-day state of emergency,
which began at midnight Tuesday, covered Paris,
its suburbs and more than 30 other French cities
from the Mediterranean to the border with Ger
many and to Rouen in the north — an indication
of how widespread arson, riots and other unrest
have become.
The measures imposed in Nice also require
some bars to close from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. for the
next 10 days, the regional government said.
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who previ
ously inflamed passions by referring to trouble
makers as "scum," said 120 foreigners have been
convicted for roles in the violence, and he called
on local authorities to expel them.
"I have asked regional prefects to expel for
eigners who were convicted — whether they
have proper residency papers or not — without
delay," he said during a National Assembly ses
sion.
In the past, Sarkozy has vowed that France
would expel Muslim prayer leaders who preach
hatred and strip them of their citizenship. More
than three dozen imams whose preachings are
violent or do not conform with French values
have been expelled since 2003, he said last
month.
The emergency decree invoked a 50-year
old security law that dates to France's colonial
war in Algeria that empowers officials to put
troublemakers under house arrest, ban or limit

the movement of people and vehicles, confis
cate weapons and close public spaces where
gangs gather.
It also paved the way for curfews in areas
where officials feel they are needed. By midday
yesterday, only a few municipalities and regions
imposed them; Paris had not.
In Normandy, the Seine-Maritime depart
ment announced curfews until TUesday for mi
nors in four towns, including Rouen and Le
Havre.
During late TUesday through early yesterday,
youths torched 617 vehicles, down from 1,173 a
night earlier, national police spokesman Patrick
Hamon said. Incidents were reported in 116
towns, down from 226.
Police made 280 arrests, raising the total to
1,830 since the violence erupted 13 nights ago.
National Police Chief Michel Gaudin said an
additional 1,000 officers were deployed
overnight, bringing the total to 11,500. He attrib
uted the drop in attacks to police sweeps and co
operation from community groups.
"The arrests are bearing fruit," Interior Min
istry spokesman Franck Louvrier said. "It's clear
there has been a significant drop, but we must
persevere."
Christian Gaillard de Lavernee, head of the
national civil security brigade, said firefighters
responded to 30 percent fewer calls overnight
than the previous day. In some towns, concerned
residents have banded together to keep
overnight watch on public buildings and to pa
trol their neighborhoods, armed only with fire
extinguishers.
Riot police fired tear gas to disperse youths
throwing gasoline bombs in the southwestern
city of Toulouse, and rioters exploded an unoc
cupied bus with Molotov cocktails in the town of
Bassens, near Bordeaux. No injuries were re
ported.
Officials were forced to shut down the south
ern city of Lyon's subway system after a fire
bomb exploded in a station late TUesday, a re
gional government spokesman said. No one was
hurt. Transport officials said bus and subway
service will be halted at 7 p.m. each day at least
until Sunday as a precaution.
Arsonists also set fire to a warehouse used by
the Nice-Matin newspaper in Grasse, national
police spokesman Patrick Reydy said.
