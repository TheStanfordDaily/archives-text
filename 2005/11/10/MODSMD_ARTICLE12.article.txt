## Don't let eating be as hard as your thesis 
### 
Perhaps the hardest part about going to
college is something that seems so
easy: eating. Making new friends and
balancing a difficult course load are by no
means easy tasks, but figuring out how to
eat well in the college setting may be the
biggest challenge. College students are
known to exhibit some of the poorest eating
habits know to man.
If your childhood was anything like
mine, it included regularly scheduled and
balanced meals. Dinner, in particular, was
always at a fixed time and was mandatory
for all family members. My mom was no
chef, but she certainly knew how to throw
together a healthy meal. An average dinner
at the Ramos house usually consisted of a
salad, a protein-rich entree and then fruit
for dessert. If we were really lucky, we were
allowed some Fat-Free Cool Whip on top of
the strawberries.
College meals could not be any further
from the picture-perfect meals of my youth.
Now, food intake rarely starts before noon
and problem sets take priority over dinner,
which may or may not occur around mid
night. Lunch can be particularly difficult to
schedule since morning classes run late and
afternoon classes start early.
In addition to timing meals, regulating
the food you eat on campus can be incredi
bly tricky. Finding something healthy to eat
in the dining hall can also be a tiine-con
suming task. One must scour the pizza,
cheeseburger and saucy Asian stations in
search of something with less grease and
more nutritional value. But how many days
in a row can you realistically eat a veggie
burger patty or the same tofu dish?
Before I completely trash Stanford Din
ing, however, I must note that Lag Dining's
center station of salad fixens and fruits is
typically fresh and well-stocked. Dining
halls at Stanford usually have enough fresh
fruit on hand to feed a small country. The
salad and sandwich bars —if your dining
hall has them — are also great resources for
throwing together a nutritious meal. Make
a salad and/or pile some lean deli meat and
a bunch of veggies onto whole-grain bread
and you have a low-fat, mineral and pro
tein-rich meal. Fora super-healthy meal,
you'll want to skip the mayo and go light on
oil and dressings, though.
The main thing to remember is to main
tain a diet with variety, and remember mod
eration. Envision your food guide pyramid
from elementary school: Fats, sugars and
oils should be consumed sparingly while the
base of your diet should consist of mostly
plant-based foods like vegetables and fiber
rich whole grains. In addition to vegetables
and fruits, calcium-rich foods like low-fat
milk and yogurt are also key since they
allow your body to build critical bone mass
that you'll need later in life.
Another good guideline to follow is the
80/20 rule of healthy eating. You don't have
to eat well 100 percent of the time in order
to maintain a healthy diet. If about 80 per
cent of your diet consists of nutrient-rich
foods, the other 20 percent can be less-nu
tritious and higher in calories. And alcohol
fits into the 20 percent category, just in case
you were wondering.
