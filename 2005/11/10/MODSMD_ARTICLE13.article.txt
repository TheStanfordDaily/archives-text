# an apple a day won't keep the FLU Away
## Vaccine is your best bet this season, CDC says 
### LOREN NEWMAN 
Once again, flu season is upon us. From
October through early spring, the in
fluenza virus overwhelms many Stan
ford students with crippling symptoms ranging
from aches and pains to extreme exhaustion to
high body temperatures.
The best way to avoid getting sick is to get a
flu shot or a nasal spray vaccine, according to the
Center for Disease Control (CDC). While the
nasal spray should only be taken by healthy peo
ple ages 5 to 49, the shot is safe for healthy peo
ple over the age of 6 as well as people with chron
ic medical conditions. The CDC estimated on
Oct. 28 that there will be close to 70 million doses
of flu vaccines, including 3 million nasal vaccines,
this flu season. It adds that although some manu
facturers say they may distribute a smaller sup
ply of doses than they originally predicted, they
"anticipate that there will be significantly more
vaccine doses produced this year than were
available last year."
Vaden will offer immunizations for students,
faculty and staff members on Nov. 15 and 29 as
well as on Dec. 6 from 3 to 6 p.m. Shots are free
for faculty and staff, according to Vaden's Web
site, but students must pay for shots — $11 for
those with Cardinal Care and $22 for those with
other insurance carriers.
According to Corry Dekker, medical direc
tor of the Lucile Packard Children's Hopsital
Vaccine Program, the flu virus mutates very
quickly. After extensive tests, the World Health
Organization develops a vaccine for each season
that is most likely to keep everyone flu-free,
Dekker says. To be fully protected, therefore, it
is important to get a vaccine each year.
TTiis fall, a number of children,students and
adults participated in flu vaccination clinical
trials at the Stanford School of Medicine and
the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, ac
cording to a School of Medicine news release
issued Sept. 28. Experiments involved tracking
the efficacy of giving vaccines in lower doses;
comparing adults' reactions to two different
kinds of flu shots; and comparing children's re
actions to different shots.
The flu shots were free for volunteers, who
also received $30 for each hospital visit connect
ed to the study, the news release says.
But don't get too excited — the clinical tri
als are already filled to capacity, according to
Dekker, so there is no place on campus for stu
dents to obtain free vaccinations.
For those who have a particular aversion to
paying Vaden for a flu shot, the Kaiser Perman
tente offices in Mountain View are offering
nasally-administered flu vaccinations to healthy,
non-pregnant adults Monday through Friday
from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 5
p.m., according to a pre-recorded phone mes
sage. The vaccinations are available for children
from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Kaiser
ran out of traditional flu shots on Nov. 8.
Dekker says that this year's scare surround
ing the infamous avian flu — also known as the
bird flu — in southeast Asia has increased anx
ieties about the flu in general this season.
"The bird flu is a new flu strain that has been
infecting birds in southeast Asia," Dekker ex
plains. "Only About 64 to 65 cases of humans con-

trading the bird flu have been reported world
wide. However in those 64 to 65 cases, the mortal
ity rate has been about 50 percent. The danger is
that the bird flu [could] mix with some other
strands of flu and become more transmissible per
son to person. So far that has not happened."
Flu shots offered in the United States this fall
are not engineered to protect people from an
avian flu pandemic, according to Dekker.
"[They] will just protect you against the rou
tine annual strains," she says.
Dekker adds that it is not more important to
get vaccinated this year as opposed to any other
year, but says, "We would like more and more
people to take this seriously."
Many students echo her sentiment.
"I'm going to get a flu shot," says freshman
Evan Purcell. "It's a good idea to protect myself
for the upcoming weeks of studying."
Others, however, do not share this enthusi
asm for vaccinations.
"I'm not getting one," says sophomore Pam
Geist."l don't think I've ever gotten one."
Others are simply disenchanted.
"I don't believe in flu shots," says freshman
Erika Amaya.'Thev just don't work for me."
