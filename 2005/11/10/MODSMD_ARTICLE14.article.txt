# New radiation therapy boasts short treatment time, few side effects
## 
### KATIE JONES 
Cancer still persists as one of the United
States' leading killers despite millions of dol
lars poured into research every year. Accord
ing to the American Cancer Society, cancer
ranks as the second highest cause of death in
the United States. Breast cancer alone is ex
pected to affect over 200.000 women in 2005.
Despite these startling statistics, new hope
hovers on the horizon for current and future
breast cancer patients. Xoft Inc., a Fremont
based biotechnology company, has recently
introduced a new type of radiation treatment
called electronic brachytherapy. Even though
electronic brachytherapy appears promising,
it has yet to be approved by the FDA.
A variety of treatment options exist for
these women.The CancerTYeatment Centers
of America cites tumor removal surgery fol
lowed by radiation therapy as the most pre

scribed treatment program. Traditional radi
ation therapy uses an external machine to
send radiation in the direction of the cancer
ous area rather than target and destroy spe
cific cancerous cells. This treatment can take
as long as seven weeks to complete, and
many women — especially those who work
and live far away from radiation treatment
centers — cannot afford to undergo such a
prolonged procedure.
Brachytherapy offers a potentially more
affordable option by reducing the duration of
treatment from seven weeks to five days.
Richard Hoppe. the Henry S. Kaplan-Harry
Lebeson professor of cancer biology and the
department chair of radiation oncology at
Stanford, says that brachytherapy generally
refers to the permanent or temporary implan
tation of radioactive sources into the body.
According to Hoppe, this method is most
commonly administered on prostate, cervix

and uterus cancer patients, but brachytherapy
can also be used to treat breast cancer.
Imaginis.com. an Internet breast-health
resource, elaborates on how brachytherapy
can be applied specifically to breast cancer.
Plastic catheters are surgically placed into the
breast tissue and are briefly connected to a
high-dose-rate brachytherapy machine. The
machine delivers radiation dosages only nine
times over the course of a week. Each radia
tion treatment is painless and lasts between
10 and 15 minutes.
Brachytherapy not only provides breast
cancer patients with a more time-efficient
treatment method, but it also mitigates the
severity of radiation side effects. Because it
directly targets the specific cancer site,
brachytherapy minimizes the irritation of
healthy breast tissue and also results in fewer
skin reactions like redness and rashes.
Xoft Inc.'s electronic brachytherapy prod

uct is a variation on brachytherapy and could
further improve patients' quality of life during
cancer treatment. Todd Pawlicki, a radiation
physics professor at the School of Medicine,
comments that electronic brachytherapy is not
really a revolutionary approach to cancer
treatment, but is rather "an evolution based on
previous work." However. Pawlicki says that
electronic brachytherapy differs from stan
dard radiation therapy in two key ways.
"First, the low-energy radiation is pro
duced as x-rays as opposed to a radioactive
isotope," Pawiicki explains. "This adds a new
level of safety to both doctor and patient.
Secondly, the calibration, treatment planning
and delivery have been packaged into a sin
gle system. This adds potentially new meth
ods to optimize the treatment to each indi
vidual patient."
Nicholas Denko, a professor of radiation
and cancer biologv at the Stanford School of

Medicine, further explains that electronic
brachvtherapy has a major advantage over
standard brachvtherapy because doctors can
switch radiation delivery on and off.
"Brachvtherapy is traditionally done using
a small amount of a radioactive nuclide that
emits radiation as it decays," Denko says.
"The major difficulty in using the nuclide is
that you cannot 'turn it off.' Instead, you must
shield the radiation with lead when it needs to
be off. Electronic brachytherapy uses very
small x-ray tubes to generate radiation and
these can be turned off when they are placed
in a patient. ITiis should result in increased
safety and ease of use to patients and technol
ogists."
Both doctors agree that electronic
brachytherapy has a low rate of complica
tions. Yet. they add that the glowing poten
tial does not negate the method's lack of
proven efficacy.

and delivery have been packaged into a sin
gle system. This adds potentially new meth
ods to optimize the treatment to each indi
vidual patient."
Nicholas Denko, a professor of radiation
and cancer biologv at the Stanford School of

Medicine, further explains that electronic
brachvtherapy has a major advantage over
standard brachvtherapy because doctors can
switch radiation delivery on and off.
"Brachvtherapy is traditionally done using
a small amount of a radioactive nuclide that
emits radiation as it decays," Denko says.
"The major difficulty in using the nuclide is
that you cannot 'turn it off.' Instead, you must
shield the radiation with lead when it needs to
be off. Electronic brachytherapy uses very
small x-ray tubes to generate radiation and
these can be turned off when they are placed
in a patient. ITiis should result in increased
safety and ease of use to patients and technol
ogists."
Both doctors agree that electronic
brachytherapy has a low rate of complica
tions. Yet. they add that the glowing poten
tial does not negate the method's lack of
proven efficacy.
Cancer still persists as one of the United
States' leading killers despite millions of dol
lars poured into research every year. Accord
ing to the American Cancer Society, cancer
ranks as the second highest cause of death in
the United States. Breast cancer alone is ex
pected to affect over 200.000 women in 2005.
Despite these startling statistics, new hope
hovers on the horizon for current and future
breast cancer patients. Xoft Inc., a Fremont
based biotechnology company, has recently
introduced a new type of radiation treatment
called electronic brachytherapy. Even though
electronic brachytherapy appears promising,
it has yet to be approved by the FDA.
A variety of treatment options exist for
these women.The CancerTYeatment Centers
of America cites tumor removal surgery fol
lowed by radiation therapy as the most pre

scribed treatment program. Traditional radi
ation therapy uses an external machine to
send radiation in the direction of the cancer
ous area rather than target and destroy spe
cific cancerous cells. This treatment can take
as long as seven weeks to complete, and
many women — especially those who work
and live far away from radiation treatment
centers — cannot afford to undergo such a
prolonged procedure.
Brachytherapy offers a potentially more
affordable option by reducing the duration of
treatment from seven weeks to five days.
Richard Hoppe. the Henry S. Kaplan-Harry
Lebeson professor of cancer biology and the
department chair of radiation oncology at
Stanford, says that brachytherapy generally
refers to the permanent or temporary implan
tation of radioactive sources into the body.
According to Hoppe, this method is most
commonly administered on prostate, cervix

and uterus cancer patients, but brachytherapy
can also be used to treat breast cancer.
Imaginis.com. an Internet breast-health
resource, elaborates on how brachytherapy
can be applied specifically to breast cancer.
Plastic catheters are surgically placed into the
breast tissue and are briefly connected to a
high-dose-rate brachytherapy machine. The
machine delivers radiation dosages only nine
times over the course of a week. Each radia
tion treatment is painless and lasts between
10 and 15 minutes.
Brachytherapy not only provides breast
cancer patients with a more time-efficient
treatment method, but it also mitigates the
severity of radiation side effects. Because it
directly targets the specific cancer site,
brachytherapy minimizes the irritation of
healthy breast tissue and also results in fewer
skin reactions like redness and rashes.
Xoft Inc.'s electronic brachytherapy prod

uct is a variation on brachytherapy and could
further improve patients' quality of life during
cancer treatment. Todd Pawlicki, a radiation
physics professor at the School of Medicine,
comments that electronic brachytherapy is not
really a revolutionary approach to cancer
treatment, but is rather "an evolution based on
previous work." However. Pawlicki says that
electronic brachytherapy differs from stan
dard radiation therapy in two key ways.
"First, the low-energy radiation is pro
duced as x-rays as opposed to a radioactive
isotope," Pawiicki explains. "This adds a new
level of safety to both doctor and patient.
Secondly, the calibration, treatment planning
and delivery have been packaged into a sin
gle system. This adds potentially new meth
ods to optimize the treatment to each indi
vidual patient."

and cancer biologv at the Stanford School of
