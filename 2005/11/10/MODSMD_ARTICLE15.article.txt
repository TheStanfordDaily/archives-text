## Editorial Law School should adopt quarter system calendar 
### 
Since assuming his position as dean of
the Law School, Prof. Larry Kramer
has championed a proposal to amend
Stanford Law School's calendar from a se
mester system to a quarter system. The pri
mary purpose of this switch would be to
synchronize the Law School with the rest
of the University. We believe that, despite a
few potential drawbacks, there are sub
stantial benefits to such a change and so
endorse Kramer's proposal.
In today's society, law students need
more than a mere legal education. There is
a growing emphasis on being interdiscipli
nary in the legal profession, so to be well
rounded lawyers, law students need to have
taken courses in a breadth of fields. Practi
cal legal training is no longer sufficient for
preparing students to be competitive in the
job market. The professional training must
extend to other disciplines, which is why
joint degrees have become so popular. A
legal education should be a "mixed educa
tion from the get-go," according to Kramer.
However, under the current semester
system, Stanford law students are largely
prevented from enrolling in courses at the
other schools. Their calendar does not cor
respond to the calendar used by the Grad
uate School of Business, the Medical
School, the School of Education or the var
ious graduate departments — all of which
use the quarter system. At the very least,
the lack of synchronization in calendars se
verely hinders students' attempts to take
classes outside of the Law School.
Similarly, the school's semester system
prevents non-law students from enrolling
in most law classes — despite much inter
est in such courses at both the graduate and
undergraduate level. These cross-registra
tion difficulties are disheartening for law
students and non-law students alike.

Joint degrees would become easier to
earn and take less time to complete if the
Law School moved to a quarter system.
One obvious benefit of calendar synchro
nization is greater coordination of classes
and degree programs.
Beyond the cerebral benefits of taking
classes outside one's professional or aca
demic discipline, greater interdisciplinary
cross-registration will also help to forge
connections among the next generation of
professionals. Law students will gain access
to potential future clients in their particu
lar areas of interest — be it medicine, busi
ness, engineering, education or interna
tional policy — and graduate students in
these schools will make valuable contacts
with the future attorneys of America.
A final advantage of the switch to quar
ters is that law students would be able to
take more classes each year— 12 instead
of the eight they currently take under the
semester system — and would have many
more classes from which to choose. Stu
dents will be able to explore more and con
sider fields they are unable to with the cur
rent calendar. They will have the opportu
nity fora much more varied education.
What's more, 12 classes a year means 12
grades a year, so each class will carry less
weight. The larger set of grades makes it
less likely that one outlier will drag one's
entire GPA down.
However, there are also some legiti
mate concerns about the switch to a quar
ter system. Many on the Law School facul
ty feel strongly that 10 weeks is simply too
short to adequately cover all the content in
their courses. They are accustomed to the
rhythm of semesters and worry that quar
ters would cheat them out of valuable in-

struction time. They believe, quite
simply, that their courses would be
better if they retained the 14-week
semester. Further, the first-year
curriculum at law schools is so stan
dard nationwide that many cannot
understand why or how one would
restructure the program to accom
modate quarters.
These apprehensions seem
valid. However, it is important to
note that the faculty members who
have taught under the quarter sys
tem — as at the University of
Chicago's law school — endorse
Kramer's proposal and would like

to switch to quarters. Their support
is particularly significant, as is the
University of Chicago's success
with bucking the semester trend
and adapting the legal curriculum
to fit quarters.
Another concern, expressed pri
marily by law students, is that the
switch would drive the Law School's
ranking down. Stanford is currently
ranked third in the country (behind
Yale and Harvard). Some worry that
because Stanford would be one of
only two elite law schools (the other
being the University of Chicago) on
the quarter system, prospective stu
dents would find the schedule
strange. They would be wary of at
tending and fewer would apply. This
would raise the school's acceptance
rate and effectively make it less se
lective.This, in turn, would negative

ly affect its ranking.
We can understand the anxiety
over the school's ranking, but we do
not think this argument is com
pelling enough to discount Kramer's
proposal. Besides, it seems very pos
sible that the stronger interdiscipli
nary approach that the quarter sys
tem would offer would actually
make the Law School better. Stan
ford could easily improve its status
as a result of this change.
Regardless of rankings, howev
er, the fact remains that Stanford
has the opportunity to integrate
the Law School into the rest of the
University to a greater extent.
This should enrich both the Law
School and the campus in general.
We encourage the faculty to vote
for the implementation of the
quarter system.
