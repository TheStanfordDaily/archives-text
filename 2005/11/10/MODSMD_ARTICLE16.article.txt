## New rec center's issues addressed 
### TED LELAND 
The campus community is very excited
about the recent opening of the Arrillaga
Center for Sports and Recreation. Approxi
mately 1,500 students, faculty and staff have
used the facility on a daily basis. We expect
these numbers to grow.
At the same time, we are aware of sever
al issues that have arisen, and I'd like to take
a moment to address these:
I.The Rec Center has no locker rooms or
shower facilities. This issue was considered
during the planning phase of the new build
ing. While we are aware that this may cause
some inconvenience, there are and have
been lockers available for students, faculty
and staff across the street in the Arrillaga
Family Sports Center. We made the decision
not to include locker rooms and shower facil
ities because we had excess capacity across
the street. This is not a perfect solution and
we apologize for inconveniences caused by
our decision, but it allowed us to maximize
the recreation space in the new facility.
2.The ventilation in the weight room is in
adequate. Our staff is working with the

building designers and other University ex
perts to improve this condition. The provost
has instructed the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation
(DAPER) to do its best and "fix this." We're
working hard to remedy this unanticipated
difficulty.
3. Lack of racquetball courts. DAPER
made the conscious decision to significantly
augment and improve the squash facilities.
This decision was made after due delibera
tion weighing the campus-wide interest in
squash vs. campus-wide interest in racquet
ball. We are actively searching for off-cam
pus sites to house racquetball activities.
We will also soon be expanding the hours
of the weight room by opening the building
at 6 a.m. during the week.
While we recognize these challenges in
the building design, we are certain that Stan
ford students, faculty and staff will enjoy the
Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation
for years to come. It is a campus jewel.
