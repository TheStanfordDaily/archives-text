## Trails bargain needs to be upheld 
### GINGER HOLT 
The Stanford Daily's Nov. 3 article,"Uni
versity blazes trail of contention" revealed a
major gulf between documented fact and
Stanford's misrepresentations and spin. I
would like to clarify some of the confusion.
1. Alpine Road is not, as Stanford Direc
tor of Government and Community Rela
tions Larry Horton states, an official CI trail
route in the Santa Clara County Master
TVail Plan.The plan clearly depicts CI as sit
uated in Santa Clara County and not on
Alpine Road.
2. Alpine Road could not have been the
only "legal" route Stanford intended when it
signed the General Use Permit agreement.
That would be impossible, as Santa Clara
County could not legally bind San Mateo
County with the agreement. In addition, at
the time of the GUP's signing five years ago
there was a relevant legal dispute over the
Alpine Road right-of-way which was not re
solved until March 17, 2004. Finally, Santa
Clara County is required to evaluate alter
native alignments for CI. There is no way
Stanford could have concluded they had a
one-route scenario.
3. The alternative route proposed by the
community does not cut deeply into Stan

ford's property. It hugs the perimeter of the
University's developable land. Unless Stan
ford declares its intentions to develop the
golf course and the northernmost portion of
the Dish trail, the alternative route is not an
interior one.
4. Finally, Stanford promised that it would
not propose Alpine Road over neighbor
hood safety concerns. Horton articulated
this clearly at a meeting of neighbors in Au
gust 2003. Confirming this in correspon
dence with us on Aug. 22, 2003, he wrote,
"And, as I have said before, I do not believe
an outcome will be approved that does not
have support from residents. Please note
that a route along Alpine Road is not the
only route that would satisfy the condition
with which Stanford must comply. Stanford
is also studying other options."
Despite all this obfuscation, the intent of
the GUP trail mitigation is clear. In return
for five million square-feet of new develop
ment rights, Stanford is required to provide
two new recreational hiking trails "crossing
Stanford lands."
Come on, Stanford. A deal is a deal.
