## Knight Fellows debate human rights coverage Visiting journalists share experiences from the field 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Students, faculty and various community
members braved yesterday evening's inclement
weather to participate in a forum on human
rights with journalists who have reported on is
sues ranging from human trafficking in Nepal to
the abuses that transpired at Abu Ghraib in Iraq.
The event, "Covering Human Rights: A Round
table Forum" involved three Knight Fellows —
distinguished visiting journalists spending an ac

ademic year on Stanford's campus. The forum
was organized by Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) instructor Paul Bator, with
PWR instructor Cheryl Greene co-moderating.
The forum featured Emily Harris, the Berlin
correspondent for National Public Radio;Suman
Pradhan, the founding editor of Nepal's first on
line news service; and Inday Esping-Varona, edi
tor in chief of The Philippine Graphic, a weekly
newsmagazine.The three spoke candidly on their
experiences and perspectives reporting on
human rights issues.
"I think a basic responsibility of journalists
and something that really drives most journalists
is the effort to see wrongs and point them out to

society — to lay it out to people that
this is wrong," Harris said.
The Fellows reflected on their
roles as journalists and the chal
lenges they face as they cover human
rights concerns both abroad and in
their home countries.
"It is always like a high-wire act,"
Esping-Varona said. "I am a citizen
of my country writing about conflicts
that have killed so many and driven
so many from their homes. Our job is
not to save them, but to give them
the space so their voices can be
heard. Our job is to be as accurate as
possible and let the distinct voices
come out and let individual people
speak out and tell their stories."
The journalists also delivered ad
vice to those in attendance on how to
address such sensitive issues and
how to present them in a feasible
and accessible manner.
"The first thing a journalist does
is get the story correct — is it fair? Is
it balanced? Then, there's always the
limited space," Pradhan said. "How

ever, if there is a story that can be
told in a very powerful way, we'll
make the space. It must be packaged
well. The reporter has a lot of work
to do."
Junior Cheng Boon Yap said she
appreciated the insights the journal
ists shared into how they choose to
present some topics.
"It was very interesting to hear
how the journalists present their
findings to the public, to hear
whether they take a stand on an
issue or just present a very objective
argument," Yap said. "It seemed to
be very different from what we
learn in school because in PWR, we
were always taught to have an argu
ment."
This quarter, Greene, whose re
search focuses on international
women's rights, is teaching the
Rhetoric of Gender and Violence.
Her course looks at global issues of
violence related to war, diasporas,
terrorism and genocide.
"I know my students can person
ally benefit from working with these
journalists and hearing more about
their research," Greene said."lt is in
valuable to speak with journalists
and professional writers and should
inform their own writing and re

search practices. I am hoping that
they will connect their individual re
search projects with the work pre
sented at the roundtable."
Freshman Melissa Schirmer, a
student in Greene's class, is re
searching the 1994 Rwandan geno
cide. She said that she greatly appre
ciates the light journalists like the
Knight Fellows have shed on lesser
known injustices around the world.
"1 feel human rights issues
around the world should be much
more publicized," Schirmer said. "So
many things happening around the
world are unknown to us,and though
we may want to take action, it is not
thrust into our attention, and we
don't consider sending help."
Bator said that his motivation for
organizing this event was to raise
awareness of the coverage or lack
thereof of human rights issues.
"PWR sponsored this program in
order to spotlight the inextricable
links among politics, rhetoric and
human rights," Bator said. "Also to
provide students with real-life exam
ples of writers who take risks, who
invest their lives in helping others."
The final advice the Knight Fel
lows imparted was the immediate
need for students at Stanford inter

ested in human rights to get in
volved.
"Witnessing something firsthand
is very important," Harris said.
"There is nothing like it. However,
you will be very powerful if you re
search the facts and know what you
are around. Listen, for the surprises."
"You have to have a very curious
and skeptical mind," Pradhan added.
This was not the first time PWR
has arranged for the Knight Fellows
to participate in forums with the
Stanford community. In 1994, the
PWR program sponsored "Investi
gating the World: Where Do I
Stand." It featured journalists from
Time Magazine, The Chicago Tri
bune, Rolling Stone, Wired and Na
tional Public Radio.
Every year, Stanford brings a col
lection of notable professional jour
nalists from around the country and
globe to campus as Knight Fellows.
While they are here, these mid-ca
reer journalists spend a year re
searching and taking part in semi
nars. They take paid time off from
their full-time professional careers
to focus exclusively on issues close to
their hearts and to improve their
own bodies of knowledge, hoping to
in turn enrich their future work.

links among politics, rhetoric and
human rights," Bator said. "Also to
provide students with real-life exam
ples of writers who take risks, who
invest their lives in helping others."
The final advice the Knight Fel
lows imparted was the immediate
need for students at Stanford inter

ested in human rights to get in
volved.
"Witnessing something firsthand
is very important," Harris said.
"There is nothing like it. However,
you will be very powerful if you re
search the facts and know what you
are around. Listen, for the surprises."
"You have to have a very curious
and skeptical mind," Pradhan added.
This was not the first time PWR
has arranged for the Knight Fellows
to participate in forums with the
Stanford community. In 1994, the
PWR program sponsored "Investi
gating the World: Where Do I
Stand." It featured journalists from
Time Magazine, The Chicago Tri
bune, Rolling Stone, Wired and Na
tional Public Radio.
Every year, Stanford brings a col
lection of notable professional jour
nalists from around the country and
globe to campus as Knight Fellows.
While they are here, these mid-ca
reer journalists spend a year re
searching and taking part in semi
nars. They take paid time off from
their full-time professional careers
to focus exclusively on issues close to
their hearts and to improve their
own bodies of knowledge, hoping to
in turn enrich their future work.
Students, faculty and various community
members braved yesterday evening's inclement
weather to participate in a forum on human
rights with journalists who have reported on is
sues ranging from human trafficking in Nepal to
the abuses that transpired at Abu Ghraib in Iraq.
The event, "Covering Human Rights: A Round
table Forum" involved three Knight Fellows —
distinguished visiting journalists spending an ac

ademic year on Stanford's campus. The forum
was organized by Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) instructor Paul Bator, with
PWR instructor Cheryl Greene co-moderating.
The forum featured Emily Harris, the Berlin
correspondent for National Public Radio;Suman
Pradhan, the founding editor of Nepal's first on
line news service; and Inday Esping-Varona, edi
tor in chief of The Philippine Graphic, a weekly
newsmagazine.The three spoke candidly on their
experiences and perspectives reporting on
human rights issues.
"I think a basic responsibility of journalists

is the effort to see wrongs and point them out to

society — to lay it out to people that
this is wrong," Harris said.
The Fellows reflected on their
roles as journalists and the chal
lenges they face as they cover human
rights concerns both abroad and in
their home countries.
"It is always like a high-wire act,"
Esping-Varona said. "I am a citizen
of my country writing about conflicts
that have killed so many and driven
so many from their homes. Our job is
not to save them, but to give them
the space so their voices can be
heard. Our job is to be as accurate as
possible and let the distinct voices
come out and let individual people
speak out and tell their stories."
The journalists also delivered ad
vice to those in attendance on how to
address such sensitive issues and
how to present them in a feasible
and accessible manner.
"The first thing a journalist does
is get the story correct — is it fair? Is
it balanced? Then, there's always the
limited space," Pradhan said. "How

ever, if there is a story that can be
told in a very powerful way, we'll
make the space. It must be packaged
well. The reporter has a lot of work
to do."
Junior Cheng Boon Yap said she
appreciated the insights the journal
ists shared into how they choose to
present some topics.
"It was very interesting to hear
how the journalists present their
findings to the public, to hear
whether they take a stand on an
issue or just present a very objective
argument," Yap said. "It seemed to
be very different from what we
learn in school because in PWR, we
were always taught to have an argu
ment."
This quarter, Greene, whose re
search focuses on international
women's rights, is teaching the
Rhetoric of Gender and Violence.
Her course looks at global issues of
violence related to war, diasporas,
terrorism and genocide.
"I know my students can person
ally benefit from working with these
journalists and hearing more about
their research," Greene said."lt is in
valuable to speak with journalists
and professional writers and should
inform their own writing and re

search practices. I am hoping that
they will connect their individual re
search projects with the work pre
sented at the roundtable."
Freshman Melissa Schirmer, a
student in Greene's class, is re
searching the 1994 Rwandan geno
cide. She said that she greatly appre
ciates the light journalists like the
Knight Fellows have shed on lesser
known injustices around the world.
"1 feel human rights issues
around the world should be much
more publicized," Schirmer said. "So
many things happening around the
world are unknown to us,and though
we may want to take action, it is not
thrust into our attention, and we
don't consider sending help."
Bator said that his motivation for
organizing this event was to raise
awareness of the coverage or lack
thereof of human rights issues.
"PWR sponsored this program in
