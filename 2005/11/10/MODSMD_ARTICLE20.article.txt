# The 						mystique of equality

£ £ thing that attracts ordinary
men to socialism and makes them
A willing to risk their skins for it, the
'mystique' of socialism, is the idea of equali
ty," wrote George Orwell in "Homage to Cat
alonia," his account of the Spanish Civil War.
"To the vast majority of people, socialism
means a classless society or it means nothing
at a11..."
The mystique of equality had taken
George Orwell from the serene meadows of
England to the muddy, reeking trenches of
Catalonia to fight Franco's fascists forces.
Last Wednesday, that same mystique of
equality took me from the cozy enclosure of
my room to the workers' rally in White Plaza.
I knew that fora brief time, I'd march in
equality with fellow workers and students. I
knew that this was the closest I'd get to the
mystique of equality fora long time.
I excitedly went up to the registration
booth and signed my name. I placed a sticker
that said "Fair Contract Now!" on my chest,
right above where my heart was beating. I
was early, so I had time to reflect before the
march started.
I thought of my upbringing — the socioe
conomic conditions I was born into. I was,
after all, from a wealthy background. Never
theless, I was never the stereotypical rich kid.
All my friends in high school were from mid
dle-class families, and I never really let my
self get mixed up with spoiled, rich brats — a
fact on which I pride myself. Partly, I think
this has to do with the fact that both my par

ents had very poor childhoods; partly, it's just
me and partly, it's a book I read. (It's called
"The Catcher in The Rye"). Then I thought
of the approximately $10 to $15 million that
would satisfy the workers' demands and of
the billons of dollars our University has. I
could not understand.
As the crowd continued to grow, I could
feel the increasing sense of solidarity that is
lacking among most Stanford students.
(Sorry, we are too busy, too important and
too grade-conscious to form real friend
ships). I hadn't talked to anyone but I could
feel that I was welcome. Anyone was wel
come. We were all equal.
The cheers slowly faded as people lined
up and began to march. "No justice! No
peace!" That was my favorite slogan. Some
workers looked at me funny as I shouted in
tensely. I'm guessing that I was shouting
louder than most people around me. As we
started to march through the Oval, I saw the
sheer magnificent green grass around me and
my mind once again wandered onto a pas
sage from "Homage To Catalonia."

After his return to England, Orwell
wrote,"Down here it was still England: ...the
deep meadows where the great shining
horses browse and meditate... the green bos
oms of the elms.... the huge peaceful wilder
ness of outer London... all sleeping the deep,
deep sleep of England, from which I some
times fear that we shall never wake till we
are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs." As
the marching figures ahead of me pro
gressed, surrounded by acres of land and
lush vegetation, I, too, thought of what it
would take us to wake from the "deep, deep
sleep" of Stanford.
When, despite numerous honks, we bold
ly blocked a junction on Palm Drive, a
woman got out of her car and defiantly
shouted, "I have an ill baby here." And we
have got an ill-willed administration, I
thought. Ignoring the angry honks of drivers,
I kept on shouting,"No justice! No peace!"
As the protest neared its end, I heard one
worker say to the other,"Let's go home. 1 am
cold and tired." I, too, was getting a bit chilly.
I returned my sign to the protest's organizers
and started speedily running away, with a
sense of satisfaction I hadn't felt fora long
time.
Late that night, as I hunched over a math
problem set, the chanting of the workers kept
burning in my frozen mind: "No justice! No
peace!"
