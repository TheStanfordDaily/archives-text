# Adventures in Deutschland
## Pearls of wisdom from abroad 
### 
Study abroad is the biggest vacation ever.
That's what a friend of mine text-mes
saged me when I informed him of a par
ticularly inappropriate urination episode in
Riga, Latvia.
There is much truth in his statement. Mrs.
Bing and other donors shower us with all-ex
pense-paid trips to far-flung lands, adminis
trators handle all of the paperwork and pro
fessors are understanding when you roll into
class 15 minutes late and more than a little
hung-over — smelling like a Sage Club ice
bucket (sorry, Kelsey). And as far as I can tell,
the classes here — with the exception of
German — exist primarily to keep you in a
safe, warm and alcohol-free environment for
a few hours each week. Without this regimen,
I'm sure some of us would devolve into tran
sient alcoholics, spending our days in Tier
garten drinking 28-cent beers and talking to
hobos in broken German (sorry again,
Kelsey).
This is not to say I haven't picked up any
thing in my time here so far. On the contrary,
I have learned quite a bit about the world, my

fellow man and myself. For your benefit. 1 will
go ahead and list a few choice morsels from
my newfound knowledge.
1) Wheat beer sucks. Known here as
Weissbier, it is cloudy, made from wheat and
has a faintly fruity taste. Oh, and it tastes
like piss. I accidentally bought a bottle on
my way to the Oktoberfest fairgrounds and
actually poured it in a gutter. Later, in
Weimar, Chris mistakenly bought us each a
half-liter because it was 10 cents cheaper
than the other beers. I ended up pouring
that out as well. I was so upset that I then
tried to jump over a garbage can and ended
up tearing my jeans and messing up my hip.
I still haven't forgiven Chris.
2) All other German beer is amazing.
Someone asked me what my favorite Ger
man brew was the other day. I deliberated for
a minute and then rattled off seven different
brands. Name seven American beers you like.
Better yet, name seven you can drink without
the aid of a ping-pong ball or quarter. More
than delicious, the beer here is cheaper and
more alcoholic than American stuff. I buy

half-liter bottles of Beck's Gold for 60 cents at
the grocery store — which is about what a 12-
ounce bottle of PBR costs at Safeway, if 1 re
member correctly Then 1 drink them on the
street with impunity.
3) Riga is lame. Yes, I spent most of my
time there under the influence, recovering
from being under the influence or planning
how to once again become under the influ
ence. But what I saw in those few hours of
mental clarity was not impressive. It wasn't
as cheap as "Eurotrip" had led me to believe
it would be, the clubs were terrible and the
U.S. Ambassador to Latvia — whom we
Stanford-in-Berlin students met at the em
bassy — talked to us for about 45 seconds
before handing us off to some lackey. In fact,
the only cool person 1 met in Riga was the
Latvian president, who talked with us for 30
minutes at her palace. I even managed to
ask a fairly intelligent question about EU
expansion. Jo, on the other hand, was sitting
next to the president and almost passed out.
TWice.
4) Most American students study
ing abroad are obnoxious. I can't tell
you how many times I have over
heard the following conversation.
European: "Oh, you're from
America?"
American college student: "Yeah,
but 1 hate it there. You guys are like
so much better at everything. I love it
here. America is terrible. I hate
George Bush."
Seriously, have some fucking self
respect. Yes, Kansas just approved
the teaching of intelligent design. No,
we don't have a national healthcare

plan. Yes, we would sooner eat shit
than sign Kyoto. But we'll fuck you
all up in basketball. Sac up!
5) Rugby is a sport for men. The
conclusion I drew after two practices
is that I am still a boy. A very tall,
good-looking, smart, funny and inter
esting boy, but a boy nonetheless. In a
few short hours, I was horrified by the
violence of the sport while also awed
by the bravery of its combatants. But
when one German took a cleat to the
face while lying on the bottom of a
scrum and Chris dislocated his shoul
der five minutes later, I knew my
rugby career was over. You may call
me a coward for sticking to squash.
But I would remind you of another
athlete who returned to the game he
had dominated. Michael Jordan.
Enough said.
Anyway, that's all I can think of

right now. In a minute, I have to go
visit Chris in the hospital. He's having
surgery tomorrow to extract a bone
flake from his shoulder that chipped
when he fell playing rugby. Touche.
