## WRESTLING Men hit mat in Missouri New coach Kerry McCoy takes team to challenging season-opener 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
The Stanford wrestlers launch into
the 2005-2006 regular season as they
travel to Kansas City, Mo. this Friday
to take on the Missouri squad in the
Cardinal's first dual meet. The Cardi
nal open the season with a significant
challenge in the Tigers, but the newly
coached Stanford team is excited,
with a newfound determination.
"Missouri is ranked very high,
and on paper they're supposed to
beat us pretty bad," first-year head
coach Kerry McCoy said. "We just
have to make sure our guys don't
worry about what the rankings are
and who they're wrestling. If they
just go out and wrestle hard, the re
sults will take care of themselves."
In his first year at Stanford,
McCoy — who replaced former
coach Steve Buddie after he resigned
in May — has focused on building a
technically sound and well-condi
tioned team for this season. Bv

stressing technique and condition
ing, he has set his sights on the kind of
long-term growth and improvement
achieved through tapping into the
squad's competitiveness and deter
mination.
"I look for our guys to show a lot
of heart, show a lot of guts, show a lot
of intensity," McCoy said. "Every
time a guy steps off the mat or some
one meets one of our guys, they're
going to know they wrestled a guy
from Stanford and the guy from
Stanford left their mark on that com
petition. We want everyone to know
that we're in good shape."
"We're well coached, well trained,
and technically sound," he added."So
at the end of the year they'll be say
ing, 'Those guys from Stanford are
the real deal.' Wins and losses will
take care of themselves, but we know
that Stanford is on the rise."
This year's captains — fifth-year
seniors Ray Blake, Ryan Hagen,
Imad Kharbush and redshirt sopho
more Tanner Gardner — will be in
strumental in providing the leader
ship needed to propel the Cardinal
to reach their goals.
"Everyone has shown some signs
of greatness," McCoy said. "Down
the line, everyone has been really
committed and done everything

we've asked. It's been a great situa
tion and should lead to a good year."
Adding to the wealth of leader
ship on the team is Matt Gentry, a
national champion for Stanford last
year, who has returnetVafter gradu
ating to serve as a volunteer assis
tant coach.
"He set the standard for Stanford
wrestling," McCoy said. "So it's good
to have him around. The guys get
along well with him."
Ultimately, McCoy hopes to bring
respect and recognition to the Stan
ford wrestling program, and the first
step on that path is coming up in Fri
day's meet.
"(We want to prove] that we can
do the work in the classroom, but we
also can get it done on the mat,"
McCoy said. "Gentry came here and
he showed that you could be a na
tional champion at Stanford. We
want to prove that it wasn't a fluke
— it wasn't a mistake. At the end of
the year we should have a lot of suc
cess. We have a lot of guys on the
team who can do really well. All-
American national champ is what
we expect."
After the dual meet this Friday,
the team remains in the Show-Me
State for the Central Missouri Open
on Sunday.
