For many students this winter, at
tending a Stanford men's basketball
game will entail more than merely
walking to Maples Pavilion minutes
before the tip. If previous years are
any indication, hundreds of fans will
sleep outside Maples the night be
fore games, paint their faces red and
scream their lungs hoarse between
now and March 4, the date of Stan
ford's home finale versus UCLA.
These rabid faithful comprise the
Sixth Man Club, the student fan
group for men's basketball.
"Coach Johnson feels that Sixth
Man are our most important fans,
and our first priority is to make the
Stanford basketball experience a
great one for them," Director of Ex
ternal Relations JT Batson said.
As the coordinator of Sixth Man,
Batson's job is to excite students
about men's basketball, so his com
ments were not surprising. But it
was Stanford head coach Trent
Johnson who had the strongest
praise for the club.
"The Sixth Man Club here is more
important than the coaches," said
Johnson, 18-13 in his one year on the
Farm. "It's more important than me.
[The basketball programj's not about
our coaches, and God bless our
donors, but it's about our students."
The club was founded 13 seasons
ago, and Johnson says it has steadily
grown in intensity.
"The Sixth Man is special â€” I re

Basketball officials are working to make improvements to the Sixth Man Club, including formal campouts before games and special
fan appreciation nights for grad students and alumni.
