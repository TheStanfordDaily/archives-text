# The 						basketball program's not about our coaches, and God bless our donors, but it's about our students.
## TRENT JOHNSON, head coach The 						Cardinal faithful Sixth Man Club in for positive changes as season draws near 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
For many students this winter, at
tending a Stanford men's basketball
game will entail more than merely
walking to Maples Pavilion minutes
before the tip. If previous years are
any indication, hundreds of fans will
sleep outside Maples the night be
fore games, paint their faces red and
scream their lungs hoarse between
now and March 4, the date of Stan
ford's home finale versus UCLA.
These rabid faithful comprise the
Sixth Man Club, the student fan
group for men's basketball.
"Coach Johnson feels that Sixth
Man are our most important fans,
and our first priority is to make the
Stanford basketball experience a
great one for them," Director of Ex
ternal Relations JT Batson said.
As the coordinator of Sixth Man,
Batson's job is to excite students
about men's basketball, so his com
ments were not surprising. But it
was Stanford head coach Trent
Johnson who had the strongest
praise for the club.
"The Sixth Man Club here is more
important than the coaches," said
Johnson, 18-13 in his one year on the
Farm. "It's more important than me.
[The basketball programj's not about
our coaches, and God bless our
donors, but it's about our students."
The club was founded 13 seasons
ago, and Johnson says it has steadily
grown in intensity.
"The Sixth Man is special — I re
member when I was an assistant

fan appreciation nights for grad students and alumni.
here,it went from enthusiastic to off
the-charts, and it's sustained over
the years," said Johnson, who was a
Stanford assistant from 1996 to
1999, before becoming Nevada's
head coach through 2004. "One of
the things Stanford has is a distinct
home-court advantage — you bet
ter believe that."
Today, that home-court edge has a
tangible outcome on the flow of con
tests. "The students here — they're a
part of our team." Johnson said. "The
students definitely affect the players.
All you have to do is watch Matt
Haryasz when he's introduced."
Not only can the fans shape the
outcomes of games, but the cheers
and jeers provide players with some
of their finest memories as Stanford
athletes.
"If you ask our players what
makes Maples so special, they all say
the Sixth Man Club.every last one of
them," said Batson, the second-year
director of Sixth Man. "[Just before
halftime of last season's home finale
versus Washington], everything
started shaking. The floor was liter
ally shaking. Coach J and I both
looked at each other and shrugged
our shoulders. They said we got rid
of the bouncy floor, but Sixth Man
put the bounce right back into it."
This season, the Sixth Man Com
mittee is instituting several changes
they hope will improve students'
game-day experience. First, the group
is looking for ways to make students'
waits more enjoyable. Before all
home contests. Sixth Man is planning
on providing students power strips
and making sure wireless access is
available. Other possibilities the
group is considering include arrang
ing for bands to play before games
and providing students with chairs
and food when they miss meals.
According to Batson, Sixth Man
has also doubled its budget on new
initiatives for this season.
Additionally, while students have

for years camped out the nights be
fore contests, this season Sixth Man
plans to host more formal campouts
the nights of January 28, February 18,
and March 3, before the Washington,
Arizona and UCLA contests, respec
tively. Sixth Man is exploring provid
ing food, music, video games and tel
evisions for these campouts.
This year. Sixth Man is subsidiz
ing tickets and coordinating rides
and hotels for road games, including
to Berkeley. The committee is also
looking to sponsor pregame give
aways and allow students to use Car
dinal Dollars at Maples concession
stands, but one change in particular
may please students the most.
According to Batson, the com
mittee is investing in a technology
that will allow students to e-mail
game tickets to a friend. Students
last year often had difficulty giving
fellow students their tickets.
And though most Sixth Man
members are undergraduates, the
group is attempting to reach out to
both graduate students and Sixth
Man Alumni — especially for
games during which undergraduates
are away on breaks — by designat
ing certain games as Grad Student
Nights. Students will be allowed to
purchase up to four tickets at $3
apiece. Alumni nights are also
scheduled.
"Season tickets at Maples are sold
out with a pretty long waiting list,"
Batson said."These guys are our most
loyal, best fans, so we created this pro
gram as a way for them to continue to
support the basketball program."
Ultimately, Batson suggests that
Sixth Man is more than just a stu
dent cheering section for basketball
contests but one of Stanford's few
traditions that, if only fora couple of
hours, succeeds in bringing the stu
dent body together.
"Our goal is to have the best stu
dent fan club in the country in a very
holistic sense —we want going to
the basketball game to be more than
just going to a basketball game,"
Batson said. "What Sixth Man has
become over the last 13 years is sort
of remarkable — it's a part of Stan
ford culture."

stands, but one change in particular
may please students the most.
According to Batson, the com
mittee is investing in a technology
that will allow students to e-mail
game tickets to a friend. Students
last year often had difficulty giving
fellow students their tickets.
And though most Sixth Man
members are undergraduates, the
group is attempting to reach out to
both graduate students and Sixth
Man Alumni — especially for
games during which undergraduates
are away on breaks — by designat
ing certain games as Grad Student
Nights. Students will be allowed to
purchase up to four tickets at $3
apiece. Alumni nights are also
scheduled.
"Season tickets at Maples are sold
out with a pretty long waiting list,"
Batson said."These guys are our most
loyal, best fans, so we created this pro
gram as a way for them to continue to
support the basketball program."
Ultimately, Batson suggests that
Sixth Man is more than just a stu
dent cheering section for basketball
contests but one of Stanford's few
traditions that, if only fora couple of
hours, succeeds in bringing the stu
dent body together.
"Our goal is to have the best stu
dent fan club in the country in a very
holistic sense —we want going to
the basketball game to be more than
just going to a basketball game,"
Batson said. "What Sixth Man has
become over the last 13 years is sort
of remarkable — it's a part of Stan
ford culture."
For many students this winter, at
tending a Stanford men's basketball
game will entail more than merely
walking to Maples Pavilion minutes
before the tip. If previous years are
any indication, hundreds of fans will
sleep outside Maples the night be
fore games, paint their faces red and
scream their lungs hoarse between
now and March 4, the date of Stan
ford's home finale versus UCLA.
These rabid faithful comprise the
Sixth Man Club, the student fan
group for men's basketball.
"Coach Johnson feels that Sixth
Man are our most important fans,
and our first priority is to make the
Stanford basketball experience a
great one for them," Director of Ex
ternal Relations JT Batson said.
As the coordinator of Sixth Man,
Batson's job is to excite students
about men's basketball, so his com
ments were not surprising. But it
was Stanford head coach Trent
Johnson who had the strongest
praise for the club.
"The Sixth Man Club here is more
important than the coaches," said
Johnson, 18-13 in his one year on the
Farm. "It's more important than me.
[The basketball programj's not about
our coaches, and God bless our
donors, but it's about our students."
The club was founded 13 seasons
ago, and Johnson says it has steadily
grown in intensity.

member when I was an assistant

here,it went from enthusiastic to off
the-charts, and it's sustained over
the years," said Johnson, who was a
Stanford assistant from 1996 to
1999, before becoming Nevada's
head coach through 2004. "One of
the things Stanford has is a distinct
home-court advantage — you bet
ter believe that."
Today, that home-court edge has a
tangible outcome on the flow of con
tests. "The students here — they're a
part of our team." Johnson said. "The
students definitely affect the players.
All you have to do is watch Matt
Haryasz when he's introduced."
Not only can the fans shape the
outcomes of games, but the cheers
and jeers provide players with some
of their finest memories as Stanford
athletes.
"If you ask our players what
makes Maples so special, they all say
the Sixth Man Club.every last one of
them," said Batson, the second-year
director of Sixth Man. "[Just before
halftime of last season's home finale
versus Washington], everything
started shaking. The floor was liter
ally shaking. Coach J and I both
looked at each other and shrugged
our shoulders. They said we got rid
of the bouncy floor, but Sixth Man
put the bounce right back into it."
This season, the Sixth Man Com
mittee is instituting several changes
they hope will improve students'
game-day experience. First, the group
is looking for ways to make students'
waits more enjoyable. Before all
home contests. Sixth Man is planning
on providing students power strips
and making sure wireless access is
available. Other possibilities the
group is considering include arrang
ing for bands to play before games
and providing students with chairs
and food when they miss meals.
According to Batson, Sixth Man
has also doubled its budget on new
initiatives for this season.
Additionally, while students have

for years camped out the nights be
fore contests, this season Sixth Man
plans to host more formal campouts
the nights of January 28, February 18,
and March 3, before the Washington,
Arizona and UCLA contests, respec
tively. Sixth Man is exploring provid
ing food, music, video games and tel
evisions for these campouts.
This year. Sixth Man is subsidiz
ing tickets and coordinating rides
and hotels for road games, including
to Berkeley. The committee is also
looking to sponsor pregame give
aways and allow students to use Car
dinal Dollars at Maples concession
stands, but one change in particular
