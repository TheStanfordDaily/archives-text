# Lightweight women, novice men win at Newport contest
## Calm weather helps Stanford boats to decisive victories in SoCal 
### EMILY CRAMER 
As predicted, the women's lightweight
eight and men's novice boat dominated the
water this past weekend at the Newport Au
tumn Rowing Festival. With sunny and calm
conditions, both boats won their races
handily against a field that lacked the com
petitive depth of fast West Coast crews.

"We went down there to win. and that's
exactly what we did," freshman sixth-seat
Mark Murphy said.
The novice men crossed the line with a
time of 15:05 for the 4.6(X)-metcr course. In
a time just under 15:30 and finishing second
was Occidental. Occidental also claimed
third in the race with its B boat.The novice
crews who competed included Sacramento
State, San Diego State, Southern California
and various other programs with little
men's crew reputation or record.
Murphy commented on the lack of com
petition but emphasized that Stanford's
boat had rowed an excellent race.
"There weren't many of our main com

petitorsat Newport, but our large margin of
victory is a testament to the progress we're
making as a crew.' he said.
Murphy was pleased with the boat's ac
complishment of several goals in the New
port race. He said that the boat achieved its
aim of a higher stroke rate, and the crew im
proved its boat set and ratio.
"We're back to training just as ferocious
ly as ever, and look forward to confronting
our competition in the spring." said Murphy
about the crew's plans for the remainder of
the season.
The lightweight women finished more
than 30 seconds ahead of the second place
boat, with a final time of 17:46.The race fea

tured five lightweight boats with no signifi
cant challengers for the Stanford crew.
The novice and lightweights will train
until they resume competition in March,
when they will begin the shorter, but more
intense, 2,(XM)-meter spring races. If the fall
was a preview of the spring, both the light
weights and novices should be poised to be
among the top boats in regional spring com
petition. The lightweights will have their
sights set on another impressive national
finish. Meanwhile, the novice men will
strive to secure an IRA Championship invi
tation for their eight, as they are scheduled
to face tough competition from Washing
ton, Oregon State and California.
