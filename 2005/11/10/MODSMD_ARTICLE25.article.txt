# Injuries and all, football still surprises us
## 
### 
This year's Cardinal football team has shown
itself to be one of the most unpredictable
teams in college football, which makes
them tough to write about for this columnist.
I wrote earlier this quarter that just a bit of
improvement and momentum for this year
would suffice.This was after a close win to Navy
and an embarrassing loss to UC-Davis. Howev
er, the Cardinal then surprised me by pulling off
two road wins against Washington State and
Arizona, stomping Arizona State on homecom
ing weekend and playing three and a half great
quarters of football against UCLA. Of course,
to shake things up, the Cardinal imploded
against USC as Pete Carroll took a 44-7 lead on
his old pal Walt Harris by halftime.
Then another unexpected event took place.
The Cardinal tried to fight back. Yes, the final
score was 52-21 and most of the Cardinal's yards
seemed to come against the USC second team.
I iowever, the team showed a sense of resilience
that seemed to be missing last year.
The point is that the Cardinal have shown
improvement. The USC game aside, the squad
has been much better at controlling the pace of
the game and limiting turnovers than the 2004
edition. Even the offensive line, missing ar
guably its best player, has allowed Trent Ed
wards the time needed to deliver in the air and
hell, even on the ground.
Unlike last year's team, when this season's
squad makes plays, it doesn't look fluky. More
over, people's frustration after the UCLA loss
indicates that the fans harbor some expecta
tion to win.
Now you may ask: Wasn't the Cardinal 4-2
last year also? Didn't they almost beat a top
ranked team? How is this year's team better?
For one, the Cardinal are doing more with
less. Harris's squad has gone through injury
after injury. The Cardinal marched into Los An
geles this past Saturday without top receivers
Mark Bradford and Evan Moore; starting tail
back Anthony Kimble; starting center Brian
Head; backup center Tim Mattran; linebacker
Michael Okwo and linemen Casey Carroll and
Pannel Egboh. Fora team that was not that deep
to begin with, those injuries were devastating.
The Card also face a much tougher schedule
than they did last year. TTieir "easy" games
against Arizona. Washington State and Oregon
State were away. This season, they missed play
ing doormat Washington. Last year, they beat
San Jose State, Washington, Washington State
and BYU. This year, their wins have come
against Arizona, Washington State. Arizona
State and Navy — a quartet that is more im
pressive than last year's.
If you remember that this is Harris' first year
and a transition year for the program, the future
for Stanford football holds some promise.
Am I saying the Card will win big next year?
No. I'm saying the Card are capable of doing
more than showing improvement — they are
