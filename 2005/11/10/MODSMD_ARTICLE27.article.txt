# NCAA's best do battle in three-day event
## 
### DEVIN MARSH 
This weekend, Stanford is one of 16 teams representing
some of the top collegiate golfing talent in the nation. The Car
dinal travel today to Florida to participate in the Collegiate
Match Play Championships, one of the most high-profile events
on the women's golfing collegiate calendar.
The three-day event pits the 16 teams against each other in
match-play tournament format, where instead of competing
to get the best mark against the course, golfers compete direct
ly against golfers on the other team. This year, the event is
held at the Mission Inn Golf & Tennis Resort at Howey-in-the
Hills, Fla.
Teams are invited to the tournament based on their order of
finish in the 2005 NCAA Championships.This weekend's atten
dees include: UCLA, No. 3 Purdue, Arizona State, Southern
California, No. 9 Arkansas, Texas A&M, Tennessee, Stanford,
TUlane and host Florida.
The 16-team field is incredibly competitive, with five top 10
teams and 12 of the top 25 ranked teams in attendance. Duke
has won the event the last two years but will not compete this
year.
A strong performance against an incredibly tough field
could potentially raise Stanford's national ranking. Currently
the Cardinal are ranked No. 14 in the nation, behind Pacific-10
Conference rivals UCLA (No. 2), USC (No. 7), and Arizona
State (No. 8).
Stanford is seeded 10th for the tournament and is scheduled
to tee off against seventh seeded Tennessee on Friday. Tennessee
is ranked No. 15 in the nation and is fresh off of a fifth-place fin
ish in the Auburn Derby Invitational. Tennessee is led by fresh
man Nicole Smith and sophomore Marci Hirner, who each
turned in top-five finishes in the Auburn Derby Invitational.The
winner of the Cardinal's first-round matchup moves onto the sec
ond round and plays the winner of the match between second
seeded Purdue and 15th-seeded Oklahoma State.
The Cardinal come into the tournament looking to follow up
on their strong performance last week at the Kent Youel Invita
tional in Hawaii. Senior Kelly Husted won the first individual
collegiate title of her career with a four-under-par and led Stan
ford to a second-place finish. Junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboon
tana finished in eighth place individually last week, and senior
Stephanie Lue finished in 18th place.
The Cardinal last played at the Match Play Championships
in November of 2003, when they finished with a record of 2-2,
losing in the first round to Arizona.The Cardinal then defeated
Pepperdine and Arizona State on the second day to advance to
the Consolation Championship, in which they eventually lost 3-
2 to Oklahoma State.
The Collegiate Match Play Championships begin tomorrow
and end Sunday.
