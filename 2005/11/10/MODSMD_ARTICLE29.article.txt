# AWARDS & HONORS
## Six profs, inducted into scientific society Fellows to travel to St. Louis for ceremony 
### GEORGIA WELLS 
Six Stanford professors have
been elected to join the American
Association for the Advancement of
Sciences (AAAS) — the world's
largest scientific society and publish
er of the esteemed journal Science,
in recognition of their work to ad
vance progress in their fields while
serving the greater good.
The nomination, announced in
September, means the professors
will travel as fellows of the AAAS to
St. Louis this spring, along with 370
other elected fellows, for the associa
tion's annual meeting where they
will be formally inducted.
"It's an honor," said Pathology
and Genetics Prof. Arend Sidow,
who was selected for his work in reg
ulatory sequences and computation
al quantification of constraints in
proteins and genomic DNA.
His colleague. Biochemistry Prof.
Daniel Herschlag. agreed.
"It's always nice to be recognized
by one's peers," he said.
According to Herschlag, the
AAAS is an "advocacy and informa
tion group for science." The organi
zation, he said,"serves as an effective
interface between the scientific com
munity and broader population."
Noting that as a professional as
sociation, its purpose was to educate
both professionals and lay people,
Herschlag said, "academic groups
like - these are critical, especially
since scientists and science educa
tors have not been effective in edu
cating the general population."
Herschlag was also concerned
about the nature of science educa
tion in today's political climate.
"This [ineffectiveness] is particu
larly the case in America,"he said,
"where the imposition of religious
views on science is having an increas
ing influence over elementary
school education."

Herschlag is being inducted into
the AAAS in recognition for his at
tempt to understand the molecular
mechanisms that underlie biological
processes at the most detailed level
of chemistry and physics.
While the six elected Stanford
professors' areas of research are di
verse, they all have shown initiative
and commitment to their respective
fields. The AAAS defines a fellow as
a member "whose efforts on behalf
of the advancement of science or its
applications are scientifically distin
guished," according to the group's
Web site.
Stanford also has one other im
portant tie to the organization —
former Stanford President Donald
Kennedy is editor in chief of Science.
The third elected fellow. Engi
neering Prof. Eric Roberts, was hon
ored for his work in computer sci
ence education, curriculum develop
ment and the role of computers in
society. According to Roberts, many
attend the AAAS conferences to
meet colleagues from different fields
who are interested in similar issues.
"It's informative to hear talks from
people who are finding success in
getting policy makers to listen to sci
entific data," he said. To be able to
communicate with such Washington
legislative policy makers is extreme
ly important for researchers depend
ent upon grants or laws and regula
tions pertaining to the work, he said,
"and the AAAS does as much as any
other organization in that regard."
The final three fellows elected to
the AAAS were Hoover Institution
Senior Fellow Paul M. Sniderman,
Comparative Medicine Prof. Linda
C. Cork and Physics Prof. C. W. Fran
cis Everitt.
According to the AAAS's Web
site, in order for one to become a fel
low, he or she must be nominated by
three current fellows, after which the
executive council votes on the candi
dates. A candidate must receive at
least five affirmative votes, with no
more than two opposing votes.
