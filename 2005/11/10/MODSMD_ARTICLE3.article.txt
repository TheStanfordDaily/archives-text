## Students question bicycle citations 
### KATHERINE HARVEY 
Many students, like senior Emi
Adachi, find it hard to believe that a
department of public safety so quick
to hand out bike citations is the same
one that emphasizes its customer
service to students.
While Adachi concedes that bicy
cle safety is a valid concern, she
thinks officers are too quick to and
out tickets.
"Boredom probably accounts for
the sheer volume of tickets they give
out," she said.
However, according to Stanford
Chief of Police Laura Wilson, it is
the Stanford Department of Public
Safety's emphasis on customer
service that sets it apart from po
lice departments on other college
campuses.
"There is a lot of hand-holding
that goes on here, in terms of trying
to help students out," Wilson said, in
an interview with The Daily last
week.
At a University where palm trees,
blue skies and 70 degree weather are
standard fare, criminal activity is off
most students' radars. How, then, do
Stanford officers spend most of their
days?
According to Wilson, traffic en
forcement and theft occupy the bulk
of officers' time.
"The major crimes here are
crimes of opportunity," she ex
plained. "Stanford is a research-rich
community, and people know the av
erage Stanford student probably has
a laptop computer and other [expen
sive] things."
Officers working weekday shifts
spend most of their time writing and
investigating stolen property re
ports, according to Wilson. They are
often successful in locating stolen
items such as bikes.
Pointing again to the depart
ment's customer service emphasis,
Wilson said, "In a lot of other juris
dictions, officers will tell you to go
online and file a report. But here
there is a lot of face-to-face support.
Officers will call you by phone.
They'll follow up with you."
Bike safety and security is an
other high priority for the Stanford
police. Three years ago, President
John Hennessy told the Depart
ment of Public Safety he wanted a
more extensive focus on bike safe
ty. As a result, Wilson said, a lot of
the department's resources have
gone to safety education and en
forcement programs.
While Wilson explained that

"most police officers don't like issu
ing hike tickets, they recognize it is a
crucial part of their job."
This year, the department added
a bike abatement program to their
exhaustive list of bike-related du
ties. The program, which the de
partment hosts several times a
year, resells abandoned bikes to
students for discount rates. Some
of the bikes are also donated to
local charities.

On night and weekend shifts, a
good deal of officers' time is spent
working with people throwing
parties and preparing necessary
safety precautions, according to
Wilson. As for the occasional
recreational drinker who attends
these parties, Wilson said officers
"will not pay that much atten
tion". as long as he or she is not
making a scene.
For students whose list of things

to do on the Farm does not include
quality time in the drunk tank, Wil
son imparted the following wis
dom: "The more egregious the be
havior, the more likely you are to
get in trouble."
Wilson also said she wants stu
dents to know 5-SURE and blue
tower phones are there to help stu
dents stay safe. They, too, are de
signed with customer service in
mind, she said.
