# GSB pitches in for worker's brother
## 
### MARINA LIEBAN STAFF WRITER 
The holiday spirit has hit the Stan
ford campus a little early this year. Over
the past few weeks, students and staff at
the Graduate School of Business (GSB)
have pulled together to support the
brother of Juan Rodriguez, a
groundskeeper at Schwab Residential

Center. Juan's brother. Jesus Rodriguez,
is in need of a liver transplant.
The donation efforts began with
Juan himself. After learning about a fel
low Schwab co-worker's success in solic
iting donations in a time of need, Juan
decided to follow suit.
"This [previous success] gave Juan an
idea to bring a donation box with his
brother's picture and a letter in Span

ish," said Karen Lundberg, assistant di
rector of finance and special projects at
Schwab. "We didn't feel that was most
appropriate and definitely not very ef
fective. so I asked my boss if we could
send an e-mail to the students."
Students and staff members re
sponded immediately, raising $572 in the
first weekend after the campaign
began.
"We have collected about $2,(XK) so
far, but our goal is to pass $10,0(X),
which is what Jesus needs for his sur
gery," Lundberg said.
Students have said they are
touched by the personal nature of the
situation.
"I decided to get involved in the ef
fort because I thought this was an op
portunity to help a person who is real
ly in need directly, rather than donate
to a larger organization or a more dis
tant cause," said Sebastian Schrott, a
student at the GSB.
Schrott is one of several students
who have decided to do more than
merely donate money towards Jesus'
medical expenses.
"So far, I have only issued an appeal
to my classmates to contribute more
for Jesus, which quickly resulted in a
tripling of the total amount raised,"
Schrott said. "However, we plan to
start further activities to continue the
drive for donations â€” for example, a
fundraising initiative over lunch at the
GSB next week."
Lundberg, along with several
other GSB students, has also begun
researching liver transplant organi
zations to handle the money donat
ed. Myriad costs await Jesus' family,
including hospital stays and post
surgical care. A transplant organiza
tion will help them to navigate these

different expenses.
"I talked to three organizations,
and we are now in the process of set
ting up an account with one, [the]
American Liver Foundation," Lund
berg said.
Besides the financial cost of the sur
gery. Jesus also faces difficulties with
the language barrier. All the necessary
paperwork for applying to a transplant
organization is in Lnglish, which is not
Jesus' native language. However, stu
dents have stepped in to help with this
challenge as well.
"1 first donated some money to
help with the transplant," said Javier
Legaria, also a student at the GSB.
"Currently, I am translating the insur
ance documents from English into
Spanish to make it easier for Juan and
his family to understand all the finan
cial aspects of the transplant and the
fund program that Karen has found
for them."
As of now, Jesus is on a 39-person
waiting list fora new liver. However, he
could move up if his condition wors
ens. On Oct. 28, Jesus received a minor
heart surgery in order to help strength
en his body for the liver transplant. So
far. his condition has been stable, and
he even contacted students to thank
them for all their hard work in securing
donations.
"On Monday morning Jesus called
me to thank me for the aid offered."
legaria said. "Not only were his hon
esty and recognition worth all the ef
forts I had done so far. but also his de
sire of meeting me was extremely
emotive. I sincerely hope I will have
the chance to meet him to celebrate
the success of the transplant."
