# STUDENT LIFE
## Party planning policy proves to be success Student groups, residences must register parties in order to access University funds By MATTHEW BOYD 
### 
College students definitely know how to get their kicks. In
fact, for students at infamous "party schools," it may be accurate
to say that college is about little other than partying. For Stanford
students struggling with I HUM and PWR projects, this is clearly
not the case. But with parties like Moonsplash, Cowabunga and
Exotic Erotic in its repertoire, Stanford is certainly capable of
hosting a party worthy of one of its more notorious brethren.
Though while in attendance a party may seem simply "out of
control," what most Stanford students are not aware of is that all
parties or events on campus go through a significant regulatory
process.
Before a party can even take place, it must comply with a num
ber of University-wide policies. The policy governing parties cur
rently states that to throw a party or hold a campus-wide event, all
student groups — including residences which are treated as stu
dent groups — must register with the University through the Of
fice of Student Activities (OSA) once a year.
This gives groups access to University funds, the ability to plan
events and parties, the opportunity to use the Stanford name in
promotions and also alerts the University to all the dealings of
student groups on campus.The OSA also provides party planning
resources and mandatory training for students in social leader
ship positions.
"This party planning system has been in place at Stanford for
10 to 12 years," said Nanci Howe, associate dean of students and
director of student activities. "During this time we have seen reg
istered parties increase over 400 percent. On average, we train 600
students and have over 4(H) parties a
year. The vast majority are well
planned and have few, if any prob
lems."
Ralph Castro, manager of the
Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden Health Center and
current interim party planning edu
cator, said he has a similar stance on
the University party policy.
"I think the party planning
guidelines enhance the overall qual
ity of parties at Stanford," Castro
said. "It allows students an opportu
nity to think through the planning
steps and ensure that the event will
be a safe, healthy and fun experi
ence for everyone. The party plan
ning policies and procedure help
both students and the University to
partner in encouraging a productive
social scene on campus."
In fact, Stanford has been so suc
cessful in protecting students' safety
— while simultaneously fostering a
vibrant social scene on campus —
that Stanford stands as a national
model for other universities.
"Our party planning guidelines
and process is nationally-known and
has received a national award,"
Howe said.
Castro reiterated Howe's state
ment on the Stanford reputation
based on his own experience.
"Other universities look to our
party planning guidelines and poli
cies as a model program," Castro
said. "I have spoken with many col
leagues form other schools that are
interested in developing similar ini
tiatives on their campuses.The Stan
ford party planning guidelines are
well-respected at a national level."
If such a system were to be imple
mented at colleges like UC-Santa

Barbara, renowned for its Hal
loween bash that attracts thousands
of students from all over the state, or
even California State University
Chico, another reputed "party
school," the students might rebel.
Stanford students, however,
seem to recognize the benefit of
having a series of regulations like
the one currently in place. Junior
Brandon Araujo, head eating club
manager (ECM) in Toyon, testified
to this point. Toyon Barristers, a
recreational space near the eating
clubs, is often the site of parties for
various student groups on campus.
One of Araujo's responsibilities as
the head ECM is to manage the
process of renting out the space for
parties, he said.
"One of the terms of the rental
agreement states that the renter
must register their party with the Of
fice of Student Activities," Araujo
said. "One may feel that he or she is
jumping through hoops by doing so
but 1 believe the advantages of doing
such vastly outweigh the disadvan
tages of not."
According to Araujo, while the
regulations are certainly more
stringent than those at peer institu
tions where there are few, if any,
university-endorsed restrictions,
the Stanford policies have worked
so far and are nowhere near as rig
orous as those at colleges with
stricter codes such as Brigham
Young University.
"It's a fine line between having a
'good time' at a party and remaining
safe especially on a college campus,"
Araujo said, "but registering your
party with the OSA is a small price to
pay."
Under its current party policy,
Stanford has found a way to walk the
fine line between permitting stu
dents to have fun while maintaining
their safety.That policy is likely to re
main a part of Stanford's party tradi
tion for many years in the future.

the one currently in place. Junior
Brandon Araujo, head eating club
manager (ECM) in Toyon, testified
to this point. Toyon Barristers, a
recreational space near the eating
clubs, is often the site of parties for
various student groups on campus.
One of Araujo's responsibilities as
the head ECM is to manage the
process of renting out the space for
parties, he said.
"One of the terms of the rental
agreement states that the renter
must register their party with the Of
fice of Student Activities," Araujo
said. "One may feel that he or she is
jumping through hoops by doing so
but 1 believe the advantages of doing
such vastly outweigh the disadvan
tages of not."
According to Araujo, while the
regulations are certainly more
stringent than those at peer institu
tions where there are few, if any,
university-endorsed restrictions,
the Stanford policies have worked
so far and are nowhere near as rig
orous as those at colleges with
stricter codes such as Brigham
Young University.
"It's a fine line between having a
'good time' at a party and remaining
safe especially on a college campus,"
Araujo said, "but registering your
party with the OSA is a small price to
pay."
Under its current party policy,
Stanford has found a way to walk the
fine line between permitting stu
dents to have fun while maintaining
their safety.That policy is likely to re
main a part of Stanford's party tradi
tion for many years in the future.
College students definitely know how to get their kicks. In
fact, for students at infamous "party schools," it may be accurate
to say that college is about little other than partying. For Stanford
students struggling with I HUM and PWR projects, this is clearly
not the case. But with parties like Moonsplash, Cowabunga and
Exotic Erotic in its repertoire, Stanford is certainly capable of
hosting a party worthy of one of its more notorious brethren.
Though while in attendance a party may seem simply "out of
control," what most Stanford students are not aware of is that all
parties or events on campus go through a significant regulatory
process.
Before a party can even take place, it must comply with a num
ber of University-wide policies. The policy governing parties cur
rently states that to throw a party or hold a campus-wide event, all
student groups — including residences which are treated as stu
dent groups — must register with the University through the Of
fice of Student Activities (OSA) once a year.
This gives groups access to University funds, the ability to plan
events and parties, the opportunity to use the Stanford name in
promotions and also alerts the University to all the dealings of
student groups on campus.The OSA also provides party planning
resources and mandatory training for students in social leader
ship positions.
"This party planning system has been in place at Stanford for
10 to 12 years," said Nanci Howe, associate dean of students and
director of student activities. "During this time we have seen reg
istered parties increase over 400 percent. On average, we train 600
students and have over 4(H) parties a
year. The vast majority are well
planned and have few, if any prob
lems."
Ralph Castro, manager of the
Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden Health Center and
current interim party planning edu
cator, said he has a similar stance on
the University party policy.
"I think the party planning
guidelines enhance the overall qual
ity of parties at Stanford," Castro
said. "It allows students an opportu
nity to think through the planning
steps and ensure that the event will
be a safe, healthy and fun experi
ence for everyone. The party plan
ning policies and procedure help
both students and the University to
partner in encouraging a productive
social scene on campus."
In fact, Stanford has been so suc
cessful in protecting students' safety
— while simultaneously fostering a
vibrant social scene on campus —
that Stanford stands as a national
model for other universities.
"Our party planning guidelines
and process is nationally-known and
has received a national award,"
Howe said.
Castro reiterated Howe's state
ment on the Stanford reputation
based on his own experience.
"Other universities look to our
party planning guidelines and poli
cies as a model program," Castro
said. "I have spoken with many col
leagues form other schools that are
interested in developing similar ini
tiatives on their campuses.The Stan
ford party planning guidelines are
well-respected at a national level."
If such a system were to be imple
mented at colleges like UC-Santa

Barbara, renowned for its Hal
loween bash that attracts thousands
of students from all over the state, or
even California State University
Chico, another reputed "party
school," the students might rebel.
