## Students leery of Munger Engineering student voices housing concerns at GSC meeting 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
With affordable graduate housing al
ready limited, graduate students, espe
cially those in the School of Engineer
ing, have raised concerns about how the
soon-to-be-built Munger Graduate Res
idences will impact the Crothers Memo
rial Hall graduate population. Con
cerned students voiced their opinions
and led a lively discussion on the topic at

last night's Graduate Student Council
(GSC) meeting.
With the completion of the Munger
residences, set for the spring of 2007,
graduate dorms Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial will be converted
into undergraduate housing. Conse
quently, graduate engineering students
will lose their assignment priorities,
which they currently hold at Crothers
Memorial.
This concerned Mohammed Mehdi
Jahanbakht, an electrical engineering
graduate student who presented at last
night's GSC meeting — partly because it
will be difficult for many engineering stu
dents to find comparably priced
housing.
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
offer the most affordable graduate
housing for the 2(X)5-2(K)6 academic
year, according to Stanford Hous
ing's Web site.
Jahanbakht said graduate engi
neering students, many of whom are
international, may have greater diffi
culty affording to live in Munger if it
ends up costing significantly more
than Crothers, as many graduate stu
dents expect it will.
GSC Member Donna Winston, a
second-year doctoral student at the
School of Education, acknowledged
that Jahanbakht'sconcerns were rea
sonable.
"He has a valid concern," Winston
said. "Crothers is one of the cheapest
places on campus,and it is important to
offer housing that is just as affordable."
Jahanbakht also asserted that en
gineers, more than other graduate
students, require "silent" residences.
Because of this unique engineering
culture. Jahanbakht proposed that
the engineering students receive
their own dorm.
While this particular recom
mendation was not readily accept
ed with many council members,
some suggested that he look into
other options, including advocating
fora sound-proof "engineering
floor" or an interdepartmental

"silent" residence.
GSC Co-chair Tom Lee, a fourth
year electrical engineering graduate
student, recommended that Jahan
bakht retool his current proposal, as
suring him that the GSC has already
raised many of these concerns with
the University administration.
Lee admitted that Munger will
likely be substantially more expen
sive than Crothers and saw this as a
potential economic issue, especially
for international students.
"We want to ensure that an ade
quate supply of affordable housing is
available," he said.
In addition to housing issues, the
GSC approved funding for two stu
dent groups — Street Law. a commu
nity service program that teaches
classes to incarcerated and other at
risk youth, and the French Student
Association, a group of more than
2(K) mostly graduate students.
The vote on a funding request for
a third group, the Redwood Outdoor
Club, was tabled until next week
pending further discussion.
Additionally, Chris Griffith, the
associate dean of graduate student
life, spoke to the GSC and an
nounced an arrangement with the
Athletic Department to sell tickets
to basketball games for $3 during the
Thanksgiving and winter breaks,
when most undergraduates are away
on vacation. These are seats that
would normally be occupied by the
6th Man Club.
Also, the GSC discussed innova
tive ways to bring more student traf
fic to ITie 750 Pub & Eatery in the
Graduate Communitv Center.
