# SPECIAL EVENT
## Deterrence a failure for India, Pakistan explains professor Last night's talk based on latest research 
### ROHAN BHOBE 
"The nuclear weapons in India and
Pakistan are the having the opposite ef
fect that they did in the Cold War," said
Visiting Prof. Paul Kapur of the Center
for International Security and Coopera
tion at Claremont-McKenna College.
"With the government in India not
cowed by the threat of a nuclear attack,
and Pakistan using its weapons as an ex
cuse for hostile action, the occurrence of
border clashes has increased."
Kapur spoke last night on nuclear se
curity considerations in South Asia at a
meeting of Stanford's International Se
curity Forum (ISF).
"My friend and I founded the ISF last
year because we believed that there was
not enough international security dis
cussion happening on campus," said
event organizer Zubin Agarwal. a junior.
"We believe that Prof. Kapur would pro
vide us with valuable insights into the se
curity issues of the (Indian) subconti
nent."
Kapur spoke on his latest research.

which provides insight into the security
environment in South Asia and how the
introduction of nuclear weapons has
changed the relationship between India
and Pakistan.
According to Kapur, nuclear
weapons have divided the scholarly
community into two opposing camps.
One holds that the weapons provide a
deterrent to conventional warfare, while
the other asserts that militaries are sub
ject to the same constraints as other
complex organizations and are therefore
just as likely to commit an error of judg
ment.
Analyzing the frequency of hostile
actions between the two nations prior to
and after their establishment as nuclear
powers, Kapur's research has found that
the probability of military action has in
creased by more than 60 percent since
the acquisition of nuclear weapons. The
majority of skirmishes have involved the
"Line of Control," which splits the dis
puted region of Kashmir into Indian
and Pakistani-governed halves.
Puzzled by this finding. Kapur dug
deeper and sought to understand why
nuclear weapons were not acting as de-
terrents, but were rather increasing the like
lihood of aggressive behavior.
He found that the issue could be traced as
far back as 1972, at the end of the
Bangladesh conflict. It was around this time
that studies conducted by the Pakistani gov
ernment showed political leaders that if they
were to ever engage in a full-scale conven
tional war with India, the chances of victory
or a standstill were minimal.
Kapur elucidated how nuclear weapons
acted as the trump card in Islamabad's poli
cy — the Indians could be bled of resources
and personnel by indirectly supporting the
anti-Indian insurgency in Kashmir, but the
threat of nuclear escalation would prevent
India from reacting with conventional
forces. The implementation of this strategy
resulted in huge financial losses for the Indi
an government, which had to deploy securi
ty forces year-round.
Responding to questions from the audi
ence, Kapur also speculated on the future of
Indo-Pakistan relations. He cited current
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf as a
source of stability for his nation, but — not
ing his unpopularity within the military and
intelligence branches — Kapur was quick to
acknowledge that a coup could easily change
the country's nuclear policy.The presence of
a nuclear flashpoint in the region, he added,
ensured that the battle over Kashmir would
continue as, in his view, neither side will re
scind their claim to the area in the near fu
ture.
With hands still raised in the audience,
Kapur concluded the seminar with a few last
comments.
"Nuclear weapons are not causing the
conflict between India and Pakistan, but it is
certainly not the case that things have gotten
better," he said. "They [nuclear weapons] are
not serving as a deterrent but have escalated
the tensions between the two nations. The
situation is much more tenuous than one
might think."

"We believe that Prof. Kapur would pro
vide us with valuable insights into the se
curity issues of the (Indian) subconti
nent."
Kapur spoke on his latest research.

which provides insight into the security
environment in South Asia and how the
introduction of nuclear weapons has
changed the relationship between India
and Pakistan.
According to Kapur, nuclear
weapons have divided the scholarly
community into two opposing camps.
One holds that the weapons provide a
deterrent to conventional warfare, while
the other asserts that militaries are sub
ject to the same constraints as other
complex organizations and are therefore
just as likely to commit an error of judg
ment.
Analyzing the frequency of hostile
actions between the two nations prior to
and after their establishment as nuclear
powers, Kapur's research has found that
the probability of military action has in
creased by more than 60 percent since
the acquisition of nuclear weapons. The
majority of skirmishes have involved the
"Line of Control," which splits the dis
puted region of Kashmir into Indian
and Pakistani-governed halves.
Puzzled by this finding. Kapur dug
deeper and sought to understand why
nuclear weapons were not acting as de-
terrents, but were rather increasing the like
lihood of aggressive behavior.
He found that the issue could be traced as
far back as 1972, at the end of the
Bangladesh conflict. It was around this time
that studies conducted by the Pakistani gov
ernment showed political leaders that if they
were to ever engage in a full-scale conven
tional war with India, the chances of victory
or a standstill were minimal.
Kapur elucidated how nuclear weapons
acted as the trump card in Islamabad's poli
cy — the Indians could be bled of resources
and personnel by indirectly supporting the
anti-Indian insurgency in Kashmir, but the
threat of nuclear escalation would prevent
India from reacting with conventional
forces. The implementation of this strategy
resulted in huge financial losses for the Indi
an government, which had to deploy securi
ty forces year-round.
Responding to questions from the audi
ence, Kapur also speculated on the future of
Indo-Pakistan relations. He cited current
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf as a
source of stability for his nation, but — not
ing his unpopularity within the military and
intelligence branches — Kapur was quick to
acknowledge that a coup could easily change
the country's nuclear policy.The presence of
a nuclear flashpoint in the region, he added,
ensured that the battle over Kashmir would
continue as, in his view, neither side will re
scind their claim to the area in the near fu
ture.
With hands still raised in the audience,
Kapur concluded the seminar with a few last
comments.
"Nuclear weapons are not causing the
conflict between India and Pakistan, but it is
certainly not the case that things have gotten
better," he said. "They [nuclear weapons] are
not serving as a deterrent but have escalated
the tensions between the two nations. The
situation is much more tenuous than one
might think."
