## Lawyer criticizes U.S. terror policies 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
"I think everyone in this country
feels that one of the true landmarks in
the U.S. is openness," said Stanford Law
School's 2005 Pubic Interest Lawyer of
the Year Barbara Olshansky in a
speech last night. She insisted that the
government should be accountable to
the people of the nation, but that "[the
current] administration has practices to
keep us ignorant and in fear."
The Stanford Law School and the
Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies sponsored the event
"Secret Practices of the War on Ter
ror," a talk by Olshansky, counsel of
the Global Justice Initiative and
deputy legal director of the Center
for Constitutional Rights.
Olshansky began her speech by
addressing the background of her
most recent book, "Democracy De
tained," which discusses America's
secret practices used in the "war on
terror," and "Secret Trials and Execu
tions," assessing the military commis
sions scheduled for Guantanamo de
tainees. Her latest book evolved
from a pamphlet she wrote after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The re
sponse from her pamphlet was so
positive, she said, that many asked
her to write an updated version.
The majority of her presentation
focused on the six weeks after Sept.
1 l,when she said she began receiving
calls from people in the Muslim com
munity that she had previously
worked with in New York. Callers,
she said, told her of family members
who were disappearing in the middle
of the night, taken away by govern
mental agencies.
"I was getting these calls saying
that my son, uncle, grandpa or hus

band are gone," she said. "Nobody
had any clue who had taken the male
members of their family. All they
could tell me was that Agent John or
Agent Mike, dressed in civilian
clothes, had taken them away."
Olshansky began investigating
these calls, asking different police
precincts to determine where the ar
rested had been taken. After they
searched area jails, police were unable
to find several of the people who were
reported missing. The first person she
did find was a man named Shakir who
had been missing for sue weeks. He
was being held at the Metropolitan
detention center of Brooklyn, and Ol
shansky had to get a court order be
fore being allowed to speak to him.
When she first met Shakir, a
Canadian citizen living in the U.S.,
Olshansky said she was shocked by
the conditions in which he was held.
"He was not allowed to make phone
calls, was held in solitary confinement
with the lights on for 24 hours a day and
had no blanket," she said. "Areas of his
face were caked with blood, some of his
teeth were broken and his hands were
shackled to his feet."
Olshansky immediately filed a
lawsuit for the immigration de
tainees, TUrkman v. Ashcroft. The
predominantly male detainees were
from counties as disperse as Canada
and Australia, but were mostly of
Arab and Southeast Asian descent.
The lawsuit won in the first round
and lost in the second. When Olshan
sky tried to get more information
about detainees,she said that she and
her colleagues were told by then-At
torney General John Ashcroft that
the freedom of information act was
suspended because the country was
