## Chem department implements grad pregnancy policy 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Chemistry Department recently imple
mented a policy that allows pregnant graduate students
"a 12-week period intended to accommodate late-stage
pregnancy, childbirth and the care of a newborn ," ac
cording to a letter addressed to all chemistry graduate
students.
The policy "will allow birthing mothers to maintain
full-time student status, and it will facilitate return to class
work, research and teaching duties in a seamless manner."
While post-doctoral students and faculty members in the
Chemistry Department have historically been granted
pregnancy leaves, no such policy has ever applied to grad
uate students.
"The Stanford Chemistry Department is committed to
achieving a diverse graduate student body and facilitating
the participation of women and underrepresented groups
in all areas of research and graduate and postdoctoral
training," wrote Department Chair Richard Zare in an e
mail to The Daily.
"To increase the number of women pursuing Ph.D. de
grees and to keep them pursuing academic as well as pro
fessional careers, it is important to acknowledge a
woman's prime childbearing years are the same years she
is likely to be a graduate student, post-doc or beginning

faculty member," he said.
The Chemistry Departments Childbirth Accommoda
tion Policy acknowledges the pressures that female stu
dents bear when it comes to starting families.
"A fundamental asymmetry exists between women
and men in regard to childbearing and providing infant
care," Zare noted. "I have explained that I am not going
down the road of providing something for fathers at this
time because until men start having babies, there is a dif
ferential impact of childbirth on men and women."
Many students said they welcome the policy.
"1 would surely take advantage of the policy if I were
expecting," said chemistry graduate student Marguerite
Desko.
But the policy is still likely to see some revision.
"Some of my faculty members have suggested that
three months is not enough time, especially for a woman
who is working in a laboratory in which she is exposed to
chemicals during pregnancy and who wishes to breastfeed
after the infant is born," Zare explained.
Chemistry students have expressed similar sentiments.
"One concern I do have about the policy is that expect
ing mothers may be expected to be in the lab around
harmful chemicals during the first trimester, when it's
most important that they stay away," Desko said. "Right
now. students are left to discuss this portion of the preg
nancy with their individual advisers, which 1 would not

consider an ideal situation."
Zare informed The Daily that the Chemistry Depart
ment's policy is based on a University-wide childbirth ac
commodation policy that is currently in the works. Guid
ed by Gail Mahood, associate dean of graduate policy and
associate provost for research, the policy would ease the
pressures of motherhood for all graduate students at Stan
ford.
"The proposed University-wide childbirth policy, on
which the chemistry policy is modeled, is currently being
reviewed by the deans of the various schools," wrote Ma
hood in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Vice Provost and Dean of Research and Graduate
Policy Artie Bienenstock and I plan to have a policy ready
for consideration by the University Executive Cabinet at
their December meeting. It will take some time to figure
out how to fund the policy and to arrange some of the ad
ministrative details, but I'm hopeful that we can have a
policy implemented by spring of 2(X)bMahood said.
Zare addressed the impact of the University's princi
ples on the creation of the policy.
"Stanford has traditionally been a place that under
stands the importance of living a full life that balances
many different goals," he said. "Our hope is that this poli
cy is another step in that direction. We want the Stanford
Chemistry Department to be known as a family-friendly
department."
