At the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday.
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff, director of the Stanford Institute for
the Environment, delivered a report on the En
vironmental Initiative. He was followed by Civil
and Environmental Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, who delivered a report on the Haas
Center for Public Service, for which he is the fac
ulty director.
The Environmental Initiative is dedicated to
finding solutions for a sustainable Earth that sup
port the needs of human beings while protecting
and restoring the environment. To this end it is
carrying out a variety of programs devoted to
generating new ideas and training leaders for the
next generation.
One such program is the Environmental Ven
tures project, which provides seed money of up
to $75,(XX) a year for two years for what Koseff
called,"potentially transformative research proj
ects." For instance, money has gone to a report on
the environmental implications of industrial
meat production and to a study of arsenic expo
sure in Asian drinking water. If they are success
ful, these projects could then graduate to larger,
more sustained funding from the federal govern
ment.
Another part of the Initiative is Strategic Col
laborations, which focuses on finding working

solutions. One of the projects under this heading
is working toward solutions for the problem of
California's climate change by reducing emis
sions. But this team is unique because it includes
several representatives from the social sciences,
who are there to determine how to implement
the emissions reduction and how the population
will react.
According to Koseff, one of the main reasons
Stanford is well-suited to this work is because it
has a history of translating "ideas to action" by
turning research into practical solutions through
collaboration with governments and firms.
The Environmental Initiative is also working
to develop a Center for Ocean Solutions, which
will more closely bind the scientific community
around Monterey Bay, which includes the Hop
kins Marine Center and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute, with the ocean sci
entists at Stanford and other area universities. By
bridging the gaps between these stellar and di
verse institutions, the Environmental Initiative
hopes to bridge the divide between the decision
makers and the scientists.
The program is also involved in training new
leaders in the environmental movement. Koseff
hopes to implement an I-Earth course of study
modeled after IHUM, which would include a
suite of introductory environmental courses that
focus on complex interdisciplinary problem
solving.
The Environmental Initiative also runs the
Aldo Leopold program, which takes 20 mid-ca
reer scientists from around the nation and gives
