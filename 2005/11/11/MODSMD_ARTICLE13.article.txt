## Faculty debates new Initiative Senate explores Haas Center, Environmental Initiative 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
At the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday.
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff, director of the Stanford Institute for
the Environment, delivered a report on the En
vironmental Initiative. He was followed by Civil
and Environmental Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, who delivered a report on the Haas
Center for Public Service, for which he is the fac
ulty director.
The Environmental Initiative is dedicated to
finding solutions for a sustainable Earth that sup
port the needs of human beings while protecting
and restoring the environment. To this end it is
carrying out a variety of programs devoted to
generating new ideas and training leaders for the
next generation.
One such program is the Environmental Ven
tures project, which provides seed money of up
to $75,(XX) a year for two years for what Koseff
called,"potentially transformative research proj
ects." For instance, money has gone to a report on
the environmental implications of industrial
meat production and to a study of arsenic expo
sure in Asian drinking water. If they are success
ful, these projects could then graduate to larger,
more sustained funding from the federal govern
ment.
Another part of the Initiative is Strategic Col
laborations, which focuses on finding working

solutions. One of the projects under this heading
is working toward solutions for the problem of
California's climate change by reducing emis
sions. But this team is unique because it includes
several representatives from the social sciences,
who are there to determine how to implement
the emissions reduction and how the population
will react.
According to Koseff, one of the main reasons
Stanford is well-suited to this work is because it
has a history of translating "ideas to action" by
turning research into practical solutions through
collaboration with governments and firms.
The Environmental Initiative is also working
to develop a Center for Ocean Solutions, which
will more closely bind the scientific community
around Monterey Bay, which includes the Hop
kins Marine Center and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute, with the ocean sci
entists at Stanford and other area universities. By
bridging the gaps between these stellar and di
verse institutions, the Environmental Initiative
hopes to bridge the divide between the decision
makers and the scientists.
The program is also involved in training new
leaders in the environmental movement. Koseff
hopes to implement an I-Earth course of study
modeled after IHUM, which would include a
suite of introductory environmental courses that
focus on complex interdisciplinary problem
solving.
The Environmental Initiative also runs the
Aldo Leopold program, which takes 20 mid-ca
reer scientists from around the nation and gives
them the tools to better communicate
with the press and government offi
cials on environmental matters. It is
looking to expand this training so that
Stanford students and teachers can
also take advantage of it.
In Ortolano's talk, he focused on
giving an overview of the Haas Cen
ter's activities.
"Many faculty members have a
very partial understanding of Haas
Center's work," he said.
One notable point he made was
that the center has recently under
gone a "change in the leadership
model." Instead of being run by a staff
member, as it has been for most of its
20-year existence, the Haas Center
now has a faculty director and a man
aging director.
Having a faculty member allows
the Haas Center to better integrate its
activities with the rest of the Universi
ty. Ortolano described the Center as
"the Switzerland of Stanford, people
feel good about coming to meet there
because it's nobody's place in particu
lar."
For example, the Haas Center re
cently brought a group of students in
terested in medical research together
with a four professors from the Med
ical School. Although both groups
were interested in working with each
other, Ortolano said, "They never
would have found each other by
themselves." He believes that having
a professor on the staff better allows
the center to build bridges with other
professors.
Ortolano has also worked to cre
ate "mini Haas Centers" in other de
partments, such as the Office of Engi
neering in Public Service. Ortolano
said that because the 1 laas Center has
little remaining space, "if anything
further is likely to happen it must hap
pen in other schools and depart
ments."

At the end of Ortolano's talk. Eco
nomics Prof. Roger Noll brought up
the point of the Haas Center's per
ception among the rest of the faculty.
"Because we have to go out and
explain these meetings to the rest of
the faculty, I'd just like to raise one ob
jection I've heard leveled at the I laas
Center," Noll said, "which is that it's
just for people who are building their
resume for law school and that it does
not contribute to the academic life of
the University."
To which Materials Science and
Engineering Prof. Arthur Bienen
stock, dean of research and graduate
policy, replied that when he worked at
the Office of Science and Technology
Policy in the White House, "we never
put out one of our important reports
without running it by one of our Stan
ford in Washington [sponsored by the
Haas Center] students. Our only con
cern is that they would get through
their work so quickly that we didn't
have anything else for them to do."

to $75,(XX) a year for two years for what Koseff
called,"potentially transformative research proj
ects." For instance, money has gone to a report on
the environmental implications of industrial
meat production and to a study of arsenic expo
sure in Asian drinking water. If they are success
ful, these projects could then graduate to larger,
more sustained funding from the federal govern
ment.
Another part of the Initiative is Strategic Col
laborations, which focuses on finding working

solutions. One of the projects under this heading
is working toward solutions for the problem of
California's climate change by reducing emis
sions. But this team is unique because it includes
several representatives from the social sciences,
who are there to determine how to implement
the emissions reduction and how the population
will react.
According to Koseff, one of the main reasons
Stanford is well-suited to this work is because it
has a history of translating "ideas to action" by
turning research into practical solutions through
collaboration with governments and firms.
The Environmental Initiative is also working
to develop a Center for Ocean Solutions, which
will more closely bind the scientific community
around Monterey Bay, which includes the Hop
kins Marine Center and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute, with the ocean sci
entists at Stanford and other area universities. By
bridging the gaps between these stellar and di
verse institutions, the Environmental Initiative
hopes to bridge the divide between the decision
makers and the scientists.
The program is also involved in training new
leaders in the environmental movement. Koseff
hopes to implement an I-Earth course of study
modeled after IHUM, which would include a
suite of introductory environmental courses that
focus on complex interdisciplinary problem
solving.
The Environmental Initiative also runs the
Aldo Leopold program, which takes 20 mid-ca
reer scientists from around the nation and gives
them the tools to better communicate
with the press and government offi
cials on environmental matters. It is
looking to expand this training so that
Stanford students and teachers can
also take advantage of it.
In Ortolano's talk, he focused on
giving an overview of the Haas Cen
ter's activities.
"Many faculty members have a
very partial understanding of Haas
Center's work," he said.
One notable point he made was
that the center has recently under
gone a "change in the leadership
model." Instead of being run by a staff
member, as it has been for most of its
20-year existence, the Haas Center
now has a faculty director and a man
aging director.
Having a faculty member allows
the Haas Center to better integrate its
activities with the rest of the Universi
ty. Ortolano described the Center as
"the Switzerland of Stanford, people
feel good about coming to meet there
because it's nobody's place in particu
lar."
For example, the Haas Center re
cently brought a group of students in
terested in medical research together
with a four professors from the Med
ical School. Although both groups
were interested in working with each
other, Ortolano said, "They never
would have found each other by
themselves." He believes that having
a professor on the staff better allows
the center to build bridges with other
professors.
Ortolano has also worked to cre
ate "mini Haas Centers" in other de
partments, such as the Office of Engi
neering in Public Service. Ortolano
said that because the 1 laas Center has
little remaining space, "if anything
further is likely to happen it must hap
pen in other schools and depart
ments."

At the end of Ortolano's talk. Eco
nomics Prof. Roger Noll brought up
the point of the Haas Center's per
ception among the rest of the faculty.
"Because we have to go out and
explain these meetings to the rest of
the faculty, I'd just like to raise one ob
jection I've heard leveled at the I laas
Center," Noll said, "which is that it's
just for people who are building their
resume for law school and that it does
not contribute to the academic life of
the University."
To which Materials Science and
Engineering Prof. Arthur Bienen
stock, dean of research and graduate
policy, replied that when he worked at
the Office of Science and Technology
Policy in the White House, "we never
put out one of our important reports
without running it by one of our Stan
ford in Washington [sponsored by the
Haas Center] students. Our only con
cern is that they would get through
their work so quickly that we didn't
have anything else for them to do."
At the Faculty Senate meeting yesterday.
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff, director of the Stanford Institute for
the Environment, delivered a report on the En
vironmental Initiative. He was followed by Civil
and Environmental Engineering Prof. Leonard
Ortolano, who delivered a report on the Haas
Center for Public Service, for which he is the fac
ulty director.
The Environmental Initiative is dedicated to
finding solutions for a sustainable Earth that sup
port the needs of human beings while protecting
and restoring the environment. To this end it is
carrying out a variety of programs devoted to
generating new ideas and training leaders for the
next generation.
