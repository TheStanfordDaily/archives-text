Stacks
600 Santa Cruz Ave., Menlo Park
Breakfast and lunch from $4.25 to $9.95

It's a busy morning at Stacks restaurant in
Menlo Park. Luckily, this American
breakfast joint has laid out free coffee
and tea to placate the waiting hordes. The
maitre d' is frantically taking names, reassur
ing patrons and calling out tables — business
is so frantic he refills his coffee mug three
times while we're waiting.
Stacks serves up hearty portions of pan
cakes, waffles, omelets and other breakfast
classics every morning. I've been here a few
times with friends, and today I'm sharing the
fun with Betsy and with my mom and sister,
who are visiting for the weekend.
"Why is it called 'Stacks?'" asks my sister
Teal. "Are all the waitresses stacked?"
She launches into her own rendition of the
Black Eyed Peas'"My Humps."
"My stacks," she sings, "my stacks, my
love-ly lady stacks"
Betsy and I join in. My mom looks con
fused. We dissolve into giggles.
"So, Betsy," says my mom after an awk
ward pause. "How are your classes?"
"Not bad," replies Betsy. "Chinese is
hard, but that's what I expected."
"Tell her about your last Chinese home
work." I laugh.
"Oh. yeah, I apparently confused the
characters for 'go' and 'swim." So my home
work reads: 'Let's swim to the cafe,' 'Let's
swim to the opera."'
"Shelby, table for four." interrupts our
discussion of aquatic transport. Despite the
large crowds of eager patrons. Stacks is very
efficient, and we've only waited for half an
hour. We follow a waiter past tables of waf
fle-devouring patrons to a booth in the back
of the restaurant.
Our menus are sticky with syrup — the
mark of a genuine pancake house. Stacks of
fers every breakfast food imaginable, but it
seems like most people are there for the
stacks of pancakes, not stacked waitresses.
You can order a short stack (two pancakes)
or a full stack (three pancakes) and choose
from options like banana wheat germ or co
conut macadamia nut. Classic plain and
blueberry pancakes are also available.
If pancakes aren't your style, try the waf
fles. Stacks serves apple, strawberry and ba
nana-pecan — I can personally vouch for
the deliciousness of the last choice.They also
have the unconventional bacon waffles,
"filled with fresh diced bacon." While none
of us were brave enough to try them, I'd be
impressed by anyone who did.
For egg lovers. Stacks has them in abun
dance. Steak and eggs, eggs Louis, eggs
Benedict, eggs Florentine, three-egg scram
bles, huevos rancheros and nine kinds of
omelets. There's even egg substitute for
those watching their cholesterol.
Still haven't found what you're looking
for? Stacks has frittatas, potato skillets.
French toast and some lighter choices like
yogurt and oatmeal.
Our food arrives soon after we order it.
My Chocolate Divine Waffle comes filled
with chocolate chips and is topped with a
dollop of whipped cream the size of an or
ange.
Teal tries a bite.
"Mmm, it melts in your mouth!" she
raves.
There is silence for almost a minute as
everyone digs into their meals. It's not
until my waffle has almost disappeared than
I take a second to look around the restau
rant.
Stacks is designed for efficiency. The ab
sence of tablecloths allows for quick wipe
downs and fast turnover. Still, Stacks has
tried to add some class with enormous artifi
cial flower arrangements and paintings on
the walls. It reminds me of getting ready for
a date, when you want to look good without
seeming like you're tryingto look good.
I feel like I shouldn't like Stacks. I want to
be too sophisticated, too health-conscious or
too cultured to enjoy this cholesterol-spiking
American diner. But I doenjoy it. I love it.
"This is why I like Stacks," Betsy says." Re
member going out to breakfast with your
family? It's like re-creating that with your
friends. It brings you back to childhood."
I agree. So swim on over to Stacks and
enjoy some chocolate chip waffles. Do it for
your inner child.
The Verdict
There's a reason the line for this restaurant
curves around the block on weekends. Treat
yourself and your friends to some delicious
all-American breakfast food.
