# Visions of femininity

### AMIN EL GAMAL 
James Brown may croon that "it's a
man's man's man's world" over the
speaker at the close of the Drama De
partment's hip and clever new produc
tion of Caryl Churchill's "Top Girls,"
but the male presence onstage is limit
ed to an obedient waiter. Though the irony is quite pal
pable, the show — which runs through tomorrow in Pig
ott Theatre — is anything but didactic. The culmination
of the talents of six seniors, Top Girls marks the first sen
ior project of its kind.
"It's about women, but it's not all activist-y,"says sen
ior Sarah Wilson, an actress in the play. "It's about real
stories of real women who aren't out to prove anything
— they're just doing what they do. It's just really fun and
not confrontational."
The play, which is considered by some to be the best
British play written by a female playwright, opens with a
posh dinner party whose guests range from a Medieval
courtesan-turned-Buddhist nun to a character from a
Bruegel painting to a transvestite pope.
"I am excited that everyone will get to see the culmi
nation of all these amazing women's experiences —
both the characters and the actresses," says senior Yana
Kesala, a drama major.
This parallel — the actresses' journey and that of the
characters — appears on a larger scale as the production
alludes to the dearth of women's plays in the theater
canon.
"The show pretty much reflects this condition on a
greater scale," says director and senior Kay Kostopoulos.
ITie remainder of the show is set in the questionably

more familiar realm of the 1980s — a world whose funky
music and mod colors seem far removed from the previ
ous scenes.
"Really nothing has changed, though." Kostopoulos
explains. "We think we're so far ahead, but we're not.
Women's identities' are still blurred. They are expected
to do everything and are criticized for it at the same
time."
The actresses all play multiple roles in the show, lend
ing continuity to the strikingly different first and second
acts.
"Both of the characters that I play don't quite fit in to
the worlds that they inhabit," Wilson says. "There's
something holding them back from trusting others or
feeling free to express themselves fully. Other than that,
the two characters couldn't be more different, which I re
ally love."
However different, the characters pursue some sort
of self-actualization, though their approaches are con
trasting and even contradictory.

"It's extremely powerful to see the six women on
stage being forces of their time," says senior Jeunee
Simon. "[But they] also realize different visions of femi
ninity and the drawbacks of being on top."
Through the different historic personas and modern
characters, the play explores women's roles in many dif
ferent dimensions.
"Women can be successful in the business sense, but
what about other aspects of life?" asks senior Malika
Williams. "It poses complex questions, but in an accessi
ble way — not through a directorial concept. There's no
higher message besides what's there."
Though true to Churchill's script, Stanford's take
adds new facets to the show.
"I think our production deals with a lot of issues that
women of color face," Wilson says."It is not something
the playwright had in mind, but it's something we've
brought to the play."
Kostopoulos also says she strives to further explore
gender and race by using music that accentuates the
rhythmic elements of Churchill's celebrated text.
"Music and rhythm were really important,"
Kostopoulos says. "[Churchill's] dialogue overlaps and
starts and stops in a very rhythmic way. I wanted the
music to reflect that and the messages in the script."
I n addition to the music, the actresses' chemistry radi
ates from the stage.
"The ladies in the show have been amazing to work
with," Wilson says. "We've all developed together as ac
tresses. It's just really fulfilling to finally be working with
all of them together on something amazing."
"The costumes are ridiculously fun," Williams adds.

Simon. "[But they] also realize different visions of femi
ninity and the drawbacks of being on top."
Through the different historic personas and modern
characters, the play explores women's roles in many dif
ferent dimensions.
"Women can be successful in the business sense, but
what about other aspects of life?" asks senior Malika
Williams. "It poses complex questions, but in an accessi
ble way — not through a directorial concept. There's no
higher message besides what's there."
Though true to Churchill's script, Stanford's take
adds new facets to the show.
"I think our production deals with a lot of issues that
women of color face," Wilson says."It is not something
the playwright had in mind, but it's something we've
brought to the play."
Kostopoulos also says she strives to further explore
gender and race by using music that accentuates the
rhythmic elements of Churchill's celebrated text.
"Music and rhythm were really important,"
Kostopoulos says. "[Churchill's] dialogue overlaps and
starts and stops in a very rhythmic way. I wanted the
music to reflect that and the messages in the script."
I n addition to the music, the actresses' chemistry radi
ates from the stage.
"The ladies in the show have been amazing to work
with," Wilson says. "We've all developed together as ac
tresses. It's just really fulfilling to finally be working with
all of them together on something amazing."
"The costumes are ridiculously fun," Williams adds.

James Brown may croon that "it's a
man's man's man's world" over the
speaker at the close of the Drama De
partment's hip and clever new produc
tion of Caryl Churchill's "Top Girls,"
but the male presence onstage is limit
ed to an obedient waiter. Though the irony is quite pal
pable, the show — which runs through tomorrow in Pig
ott Theatre — is anything but didactic. The culmination
of the talents of six seniors, Top Girls marks the first sen
ior project of its kind.
"It's about women, but it's not all activist-y,"says sen
ior Sarah Wilson, an actress in the play. "It's about real
stories of real women who aren't out to prove anything
— they're just doing what they do. It's just really fun and
not confrontational."
The play, which is considered by some to be the best
British play written by a female playwright, opens with a
posh dinner party whose guests range from a Medieval
courtesan-turned-Buddhist nun to a character from a
Bruegel painting to a transvestite pope.
"I am excited that everyone will get to see the culmi
nation of all these amazing women's experiences —
both the characters and the actresses," says senior Yana
Kesala, a drama major.
This parallel — the actresses' journey and that of the
characters — appears on a larger scale as the production
alludes to the dearth of women's plays in the theater
canon.
"The show pretty much reflects this condition on a
greater scale," says director and senior Kay Kostopoulos.
ITie remainder of the show is set in the questionably

more familiar realm of the 1980s — a world whose funky
music and mod colors seem far removed from the previ
ous scenes.
"Really nothing has changed, though." Kostopoulos
explains. "We think we're so far ahead, but we're not.
Women's identities' are still blurred. They are expected
to do everything and are criticized for it at the same
time."
The actresses all play multiple roles in the show, lend
ing continuity to the strikingly different first and second
acts.
"Both of the characters that I play don't quite fit in to
the worlds that they inhabit," Wilson says. "There's
something holding them back from trusting others or
feeling free to express themselves fully. Other than that,
the two characters couldn't be more different, which I re
ally love."
However different, the characters pursue some sort
of self-actualization, though their approaches are con
trasting and even contradictory.

"It's extremely powerful to see the six women on
stage being forces of their time," says senior Jeunee
Simon. "[But they] also realize different visions of femi
ninity and the drawbacks of being on top."
Through the different historic personas and modern
characters, the play explores women's roles in many dif
ferent dimensions.
