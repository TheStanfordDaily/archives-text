### ANURADHA SIVARAM 
Yearning for song, dance and samosas? The
wait is almost over.
Sanskriti, Stanford's South Asian organiza
tion, will host its annual cultural show, "Festival
of Lights," on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium.
Emceed by one undergraduate student and
one graduate student,"Festival of Lights" will fea
ture a variety of performances, ranging from clas
sical Bharatanatyam and Bhangra dances to mu
sical acts, a fusion band and an all-freshmen skit.
"We tried to create a mix between dance,
singing and drama acts," says sophomore Vijay
Vanchinathan, a member of the Sanskriti's spe
cial events committee.
According to Vanchinathan. the show cele
brates both Diwali — the five-day Hindu Festi
val of Lights — and the Muslim holy day of Eid
ul-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan's fast.
"We're trying to cater to people who celebrate
Diwali and Eid," Vanchinathan explains. "After
all, Sanskriti is a South Asian organization which
is accepting of all cultures and religions."
Vanchinathan and Sanskriti Co-Chair
Supriya Misra, a junior, began organizing the
event earlier this summer with help from com
mittee members Ankur Gupta and Ellora Kar
markar. sophomores.

"We started planning in August where we
just laid down ideas," Vanchinathan says. "We
discussed the ideas through September and
early October."
For Gupta, the process of putting together
the show has required a lot more organization
than expected.
"It's been quite an experience learning how
to organize all the various aspects of such a
large-scale production," he says. "There was
technical stuff with lighting and audio, publicity
with flyering, tickets and programs and just
dealing with the University and organizing the
actual acts and emcees."
ITiough the committee sought out a few
groups and students to ask them to participate,
Vanchinathan says that a lot of people volun
teered on their own.
"We approached individuals to be team
leaders, though some individuals also ap
proached us," he explains. "We then recruited
lots of freshman to work under those team
leaders. Basically we were looking for people
who were energetic."
One freshman who became involved was
Ooshma Garg.
While he has participated in other Indian per
formances, Garg found this experience unique.
"Not only did I get to spend a lot of time mak
ing new friends, but I also enjoyed the creative

experience of designing a skit that portrayed In
dian culture in an educational yet entertaining
manner," she says.
Festival of Lights is an annual tradition but
will be significantly different from previous years.
"It'll be more like an actual show, not a din
ner and a show like it was last year," Vanchi
nathan says.
Garg also notes that there will be greater op
portunity for audience involvement.
"I've heard that in the past. Festival of Lights
has been a showcase of culture." she says. "How
ever, this year, students will have the opportuni
ty to participate in activities themselves, outside
of the performance."
Junior Aarti Rao has performed in the last two
Festival of Lights shows and this year she helped
choreograph an Indian classical dance routine.
"It's a great experience and really just a great
honor to be doing something like this to get the
whole Stanford community involved," Rao says.
"I've seen others do such a great job of it.so lam
honored to choreograph this year."
Rao says she feels that having a show at this
time of year is a great bonding experience.
"It's really nice to see the community come
together at the beginning of the year. Now we
have a whole new group of freshman who are so
enthusiastic. It's just really exciting having
everybody on the team."

just laid down ideas," Vanchinathan says. "We
discussed the ideas through September and
early October."
For Gupta, the process of putting together
the show has required a lot more organization
than expected.
"It's been quite an experience learning how
to organize all the various aspects of such a
large-scale production," he says. "There was
technical stuff with lighting and audio, publicity
with flyering, tickets and programs and just
dealing with the University and organizing the
actual acts and emcees."
ITiough the committee sought out a few
groups and students to ask them to participate,
Vanchinathan says that a lot of people volun
teered on their own.
"We approached individuals to be team
leaders, though some individuals also ap
proached us," he explains. "We then recruited
lots of freshman to work under those team
leaders. Basically we were looking for people
who were energetic."
One freshman who became involved was
Ooshma Garg.
While he has participated in other Indian per
formances, Garg found this experience unique.
"Not only did I get to spend a lot of time mak
ing new friends, but I also enjoyed the creative

experience of designing a skit that portrayed In
dian culture in an educational yet entertaining
manner," she says.
Festival of Lights is an annual tradition but
will be significantly different from previous years.
"It'll be more like an actual show, not a din
ner and a show like it was last year," Vanchi
nathan says.
Garg also notes that there will be greater op
portunity for audience involvement.
"I've heard that in the past. Festival of Lights
has been a showcase of culture." she says. "How
ever, this year, students will have the opportuni
ty to participate in activities themselves, outside
of the performance."
Junior Aarti Rao has performed in the last two
Festival of Lights shows and this year she helped
choreograph an Indian classical dance routine.
"It's a great experience and really just a great
honor to be doing something like this to get the
whole Stanford community involved," Rao says.
"I've seen others do such a great job of it.so lam
honored to choreograph this year."
Rao says she feels that having a show at this
time of year is a great bonding experience.
"It's really nice to see the community come
together at the beginning of the year. Now we
have a whole new group of freshman who are so
enthusiastic. It's just really exciting having
everybody on the team."
