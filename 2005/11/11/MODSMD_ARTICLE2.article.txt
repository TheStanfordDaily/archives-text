# CHANCE TO BOUNCE BACK
## Football in a must-win situation 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford visits Oregon State tomor
row in a must-win game for both programs, the
Cardinal will need to overcome location, weath
er and several recent trends for the victory.
Stanford (4-4, 3-3 Pacific 10 Conference) is
aiming for its first bowl game in four years —
and must win two of its final three contests to
reach the six victories necessary to qualify. Fur
thermore, Stanford has won exactly four games
each of the past two seasons, and the last time the
Cardinal won more than four contests was 20()1.
Over the course of the season, players have
repeatedly spoken of the need to get over the
"four-win hump" and tomorrow looks to be
the best bet to do that, as the remaining con
tests come against California (6-3, 3-3) and
No. 7 Notre Dame (6-2).
"I know our football players realize the im
portance of this game," said head coach Walt
Harris, who led Pittsburgh to five consecutive
bowl berths before coming to the Farm.
While Stanford aims for its first bowl ap
pearance in four years, Oregon State (5-4,3-3)
stands one win shy of qualifying for their
fourth straight postseason trip. Like Stanford,
if the Beavers do not pull off the victory this
week, their task grows considerably tougher.
The only remaining contest on the Beavers'
schedule after Stanford is a visit to archrival
No. 11 Oregon (8-1,5-1).
The Beavers come off an ugly 18-10 deci
sion at Washington that was won on the foot of
sophomore placekicker Alexis Serna. Serna
kicked six field goals in the victory, tying him
with the single-season school record of 22.
With two games remaining, the Pac-10 record
of 29 is within striking distance for Serna, who
was named the conference's Special Teams
Player of the Week.
Another Beaver strength is a ground de
fense whose 109 yards allowed per game ranks
atop the Pac-10. The defense front appears to
grow stronger each week and has allowed just
68 rushing yards the last two contests combined.
"Their defense is really stout and not many
people have been able to run the football."
Harris said. "I'm very impressed with their
front seven and the way they play their
scheme. They make it impossible for a lot of
teams to run the ball."
However, running is not an offensive
