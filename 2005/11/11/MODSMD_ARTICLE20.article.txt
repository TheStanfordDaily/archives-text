## Editorial Staff payment should standardize 
### 
Halfway through fall quarter, most
dorms have gone on their scavenger
hunt, fountain-hopped around cam
pus, played capture the flag in the Quad, and
elected a dorm government. Behind all of this
is the tireless work of the resident staff in
dorms and row houses across campus. Clear
ly, enthusiastic staff are motivated by more
than their paychecks, but those paychecks,
and the issues surrounding them, can cause a
few problems that can distract staff from their
vital duties. With a "Thank You" to the staff
who make our experiences what they are, we
would like to take this opportunity to explore
and suggest potential structural changes to
improve the residential staffing experience.
First, we'd like to inform you that the
candy you ate in your resident assistant's
room last night was probably purchased out
of your staff s own pockets. In what seems to
be financial insensitivity. Residential Educa
tion has in the past and continues to be slow
to compensate staff for the purchases they
make early in the quarter. Part of this results
from the necessity of electing a treasurer in
each dorm to disburse dorm funds for staff
purchases. But with out-of-pocket expenses
in the high hundreds of dollars — in some
cases more than a staff member's quarterly
salary — Residential Education should take
steps to ensure that staff members are reim
bursed quickly. One possible solution would
be for Residential Education to create the
dorm bank account prior to the selection of
a dorm treasurer. Residential staff could
write checks from this bank account so that
out of pocket expenditures for Orientation
would be little to none. Disbursements
would be turned over to the treasurer once
elected.
On a separate but also monetary note, we
believe that non-RA staff salaries should be
equalized and standardized. As it currently
stands, some non-RA positions are paid a
couple hundred dollars while other positions
are compensated almost as generously as
RAs. We understand that there is a market for
these positions and that salaries, to some de
gree, are set to attract good applicants. But,

we also believe that salaries could be equal
ized without any noticeable change in appli
cant quality and with significant positive ef
fects on intra-staff dynamics. Disparate pay
structures can challenge a staffs ability to
take on equitable responsibilities. Equalizing
non-RA pay would fix this problem and more
fairly compensate some poorly paid non-RA
staff positions (notably, the peer health edu
cator).
Many positions have been established
over the years, often through different offices
and with different goals. In addition to RAs,
there are HPACs (head peer academic coor
dinators), RCCs (residential computer coor
dinators), and CAAs (cultural awareness as
sociates). The list goes all the way to RBCs
(resident bike coordinators). While we un
derstand that all had different origins, we
think that Residential Education should real
ize that staff members hold a certain authori
ty and responsibility just by being staff. Thus,
ResEd should do a better job of tying per
ceived and actual responsibility to salary,
even where they do not control the purse
strings.
A third suggestion we propose is the strat
ification of RA pay based on their resident
population. All-frosh dorm RAs work signifi
cantly harder than row house RAs To some
degree, self-selection ensures that RAs inter
ested in investing more time in their position
apply to all-frosh dorms. However, we feel
that the workload justifies paying all-frosh
RAs more than four-class dorm RAs and
four-class dorm RAs more than row RAs.
However, in order to ensure a fairer sys
tem of expectations and pay, residential staff
positions should be brought under a central
authority. This authority would be able to
compare staff salaries, respond to calls for eq
uity and quickly execute changes.
On the whole, we believe that Residential
Eduction is integral to the Stanford experi
ence. But we also believe there are potential
changes that can and should be made to im
prove the staff system. Stanford students
strive for perfection. Our ResEd system
should too.

are compensated almost as generously as
RAs. We understand that there is a market for
these positions and that salaries, to some de
gree, are set to attract good applicants. But,

we also believe that salaries could be equal
ized without any noticeable change in appli
cant quality and with significant positive ef
fects on intra-staff dynamics. Disparate pay
structures can challenge a staffs ability to
take on equitable responsibilities. Equalizing
non-RA pay would fix this problem and more
fairly compensate some poorly paid non-RA
staff positions (notably, the peer health edu
cator).
Many positions have been established
over the years, often through different offices
and with different goals. In addition to RAs,
there are HPACs (head peer academic coor
dinators), RCCs (residential computer coor
dinators), and CAAs (cultural awareness as
sociates). The list goes all the way to RBCs
(resident bike coordinators). While we un
derstand that all had different origins, we
think that Residential Education should real
ize that staff members hold a certain authori
ty and responsibility just by being staff. Thus,
ResEd should do a better job of tying per
ceived and actual responsibility to salary,
even where they do not control the purse
strings.
A third suggestion we propose is the strat
ification of RA pay based on their resident
population. All-frosh dorm RAs work signifi
cantly harder than row house RAs To some
degree, self-selection ensures that RAs inter
ested in investing more time in their position
apply to all-frosh dorms. However, we feel
that the workload justifies paying all-frosh
RAs more than four-class dorm RAs and
four-class dorm RAs more than row RAs.
However, in order to ensure a fairer sys
tem of expectations and pay, residential staff
positions should be brought under a central
authority. This authority would be able to
compare staff salaries, respond to calls for eq
uity and quickly execute changes.
On the whole, we believe that Residential
Eduction is integral to the Stanford experi
ence. But we also believe there are potential
changes that can and should be made to im
prove the staff system. Stanford students
strive for perfection. Our ResEd system
should too.

Halfway through fall quarter, most
dorms have gone on their scavenger
hunt, fountain-hopped around cam
pus, played capture the flag in the Quad, and
elected a dorm government. Behind all of this
is the tireless work of the resident staff in
dorms and row houses across campus. Clear
ly, enthusiastic staff are motivated by more
than their paychecks, but those paychecks,
and the issues surrounding them, can cause a
few problems that can distract staff from their
vital duties. With a "Thank You" to the staff
who make our experiences what they are, we
would like to take this opportunity to explore
and suggest potential structural changes to
improve the residential staffing experience.
First, we'd like to inform you that the
candy you ate in your resident assistant's
room last night was probably purchased out
of your staff s own pockets. In what seems to
be financial insensitivity. Residential Educa
tion has in the past and continues to be slow
to compensate staff for the purchases they
make early in the quarter. Part of this results
from the necessity of electing a treasurer in
each dorm to disburse dorm funds for staff
purchases. But with out-of-pocket expenses
in the high hundreds of dollars — in some
cases more than a staff member's quarterly
salary — Residential Education should take
steps to ensure that staff members are reim
bursed quickly. One possible solution would
be for Residential Education to create the
dorm bank account prior to the selection of
a dorm treasurer. Residential staff could
write checks from this bank account so that
out of pocket expenditures for Orientation
would be little to none. Disbursements
would be turned over to the treasurer once
elected.
On a separate but also monetary note, we
believe that non-RA staff salaries should be
equalized and standardized. As it currently
stands, some non-RA positions are paid a
couple hundred dollars while other positions
are compensated almost as generously as
RAs. We understand that there is a market for
these positions and that salaries, to some de
gree, are set to attract good applicants. But,

we also believe that salaries could be equal
ized without any noticeable change in appli
cant quality and with significant positive ef
fects on intra-staff dynamics. Disparate pay
structures can challenge a staffs ability to
take on equitable responsibilities. Equalizing
