# You make the call

While scrolling through the Facebook
one morning, we came across a
group entitled "I would be a Lakers
girl...but the NCAA prohibits it!" and while
neither of us were all that eager to don bright
yellow cheerleader outfits and spend our Fri
day nights at Kobe's, we did feel the group
brought up a valid point.
The NCAA never ceases to amaze us with
its endless sea of rules and guidelines. In fact,
if you Google "NCAA rules, ridiculous,"
around 1,300 results pop up. Just what does
that say?The fact is that the NCAA rule book
is an inch thick and about as easy to read as
one of Cassidy's dumb facial expressions (i.e.,
pretty hard to read; see photo above). Here
are a few intriguing possibilities.
Scenario A:
Billy Basketball is standing in line at his fa
vorite teriyaki stand, minding his own busi
ness and pondering what sort of pan-Asian
cuisine will tickle his palate today. As he inch
es closer to the counter, he spots his team nu
tritionist gorging herself on egg rolls and
deep-fried pot stickers. Billy, with his sharp
eyes and cat-like reflexes, hones in just in time
to notice a savory morsel fall off the plate and
hit pavement. He pounces. With a little help
from his shirt sleeve and the five-second rule,
he deems it fit for consumption and pops it in
his mouth without a second thought.
Much to Billy's chagrin, an undercover
agent from the Federal Bureau of NCAA Vi
olations was next in line and saw the whole
thing go down. Because the pot sticker was
paid for by an athletic staff member outside
the expenses of the basketball team, his ac
tions constitute an NCAA violation. In his of
ficial report back to the mother ship, the agent
states that Billy was spotted accepting fringe
benefits from a member of the athletic staff.
His blatant disregard for the NCAA rule
book is punishable by five months of proba
tion and a lifetime ban on savory teriyaki
treats.
Scenario B:
Sammy Swimmer is readying himself for
the race of his life. As he adjusts his goggles
and places his feet on the starting block, he
flashes a grin to the television camera on deck
that will soon capture his certain victory. The
gun fires, he springs off the block and as he en
ters the water he suddenly realizes that in his
pre-race ritual he somehow forgot to tighten
the strings of his Speedo, which is now at his
ankles. Unwilling to let this minor setback
break his concentration, he pushes forward
faster and faster until finally he touches the
wall to claim his miraculous victory.
In any normal situation, an athletic gov- #
erning body might have pity for the embar
rassment of Sammy's birthday-suit triumph.
Perhaps his exposed performance would be
seen as homage to the athletics of Ancient

Greece in their purest form. No such luck.
Sammy will he unable to claim his crown, as
the NCAA, in accordance with Rule 3, sec
tion 1, article 1. disqualified him for improper
uniform and use of a rudder.
Scenario C:
Linda Lacrosse is suffering from a killer
headache. Why? We're not sure. Maybe she
took a ball to the ear in practice yesterday. (Is
that what they play with? Balls? Pucks? Shut
tlecocks? Pigs' bladders? We've never actual
ly seen a game of lacrosse, but we're assuming
it has something to do with little alligators. No
wait,that's Lacoste. Uh,never mind.)
Anyway, Linda Lacrosse has a killer
headache. So she takes a couple of Advil be
fore bed. Much to Linda's surprise, the
NCAA Gestapo chooses that very night to do
a random drug test on select members of the
field hockey team. (Oh wait... field hockey?
We were talking about lacrosse. Sorry, we get
them confused sometimes). Linda pees into a
cup. waits nervously for results, and... comes
out clean. Don't be silly, the NCAA wouldn't
ban Advil. The institution of college athletics
rests on a foundation of over-the-counter
painkillers. Athletes have more aches than a
Billy Ray Cyrus song and more panes than a
glass factory. Not to mention more puns
than a... What? Too far? OK, we'll stop now.
Yes, Linda was fine, but that doesn't mean
this story has a happy ending. Her teammate
Lilly was not so lucky. It just so happened that
Not-So-Lucky Lilly had indulged in a lemon
poppy seed muffin for lunch. Poppy seeds are
narcotics. Narcotics are banned."Just say no to
muffins" is a lesson Lilly learned the hard way.
The sad thing is that no matter what ridicu
lous scenarios we come up with, we're simply
not up to the task of devising sillier scenes than
have already happened in real life. A few years
ago, the University of Utah basketball coach
got in trouble for buying a player a burger for
dinner. Are we kidding? No, we're not.
All these situations make us wonder:
There are 33 articles and 510 pages in the
NCAA rulebook — how many athletic ca
reers (not to mention trees) could be saved if
the powers-that-be stuck with the rule of
common sense?

While scrolling through the Facebook
one morning, we came across a
group entitled "I would be a Lakers
girl...but the NCAA prohibits it!" and while
neither of us were all that eager to don bright
yellow cheerleader outfits and spend our Fri
day nights at Kobe's, we did feel the group
brought up a valid point.
The NCAA never ceases to amaze us with
its endless sea of rules and guidelines. In fact,
if you Google "NCAA rules, ridiculous,"
around 1,300 results pop up. Just what does
that say?The fact is that the NCAA rule book
is an inch thick and about as easy to read as
one of Cassidy's dumb facial expressions (i.e.,
pretty hard to read; see photo above). Here
are a few intriguing possibilities.
Scenario A:
Billy Basketball is standing in line at his fa
vorite teriyaki stand, minding his own busi
ness and pondering what sort of pan-Asian
cuisine will tickle his palate today. As he inch
es closer to the counter, he spots his team nu
tritionist gorging herself on egg rolls and
deep-fried pot stickers. Billy, with his sharp
eyes and cat-like reflexes, hones in just in time
to notice a savory morsel fall off the plate and
hit pavement. He pounces. With a little help
from his shirt sleeve and the five-second rule,
he deems it fit for consumption and pops it in
his mouth without a second thought.
Much to Billy's chagrin, an undercover
agent from the Federal Bureau of NCAA Vi
olations was next in line and saw the whole
thing go down. Because the pot sticker was
paid for by an athletic staff member outside
the expenses of the basketball team, his ac
tions constitute an NCAA violation. In his of
ficial report back to the mother ship, the agent
states that Billy was spotted accepting fringe
benefits from a member of the athletic staff.
His blatant disregard for the NCAA rule
book is punishable by five months of proba
tion and a lifetime ban on savory teriyaki
treats.
Scenario B:
Sammy Swimmer is readying himself for
the race of his life. As he adjusts his goggles
and places his feet on the starting block, he
flashes a grin to the television camera on deck
that will soon capture his certain victory. The
gun fires, he springs off the block and as he en
ters the water he suddenly realizes that in his
pre-race ritual he somehow forgot to tighten
the strings of his Speedo, which is now at his
ankles. Unwilling to let this minor setback
break his concentration, he pushes forward
faster and faster until finally he touches the
wall to claim his miraculous victory.
In any normal situation, an athletic gov- #
erning body might have pity for the embar
rassment of Sammy's birthday-suit triumph.
Perhaps his exposed performance would be
seen as homage to the athletics of Ancient

Greece in their purest form. No such luck.
Sammy will he unable to claim his crown, as
the NCAA, in accordance with Rule 3, sec
tion 1, article 1. disqualified him for improper
uniform and use of a rudder.
Scenario C:
Linda Lacrosse is suffering from a killer
headache. Why? We're not sure. Maybe she
took a ball to the ear in practice yesterday. (Is
that what they play with? Balls? Pucks? Shut
tlecocks? Pigs' bladders? We've never actual
ly seen a game of lacrosse, but we're assuming
it has something to do with little alligators. No
wait,that's Lacoste. Uh,never mind.)
Anyway, Linda Lacrosse has a killer
headache. So she takes a couple of Advil be
fore bed. Much to Linda's surprise, the
NCAA Gestapo chooses that very night to do
a random drug test on select members of the
field hockey team. (Oh wait... field hockey?
We were talking about lacrosse. Sorry, we get
them confused sometimes). Linda pees into a
cup. waits nervously for results, and... comes
out clean. Don't be silly, the NCAA wouldn't
ban Advil. The institution of college athletics
rests on a foundation of over-the-counter
painkillers. Athletes have more aches than a
Billy Ray Cyrus song and more panes than a
glass factory. Not to mention more puns
than a... What? Too far? OK, we'll stop now.
Yes, Linda was fine, but that doesn't mean
this story has a happy ending. Her teammate
Lilly was not so lucky. It just so happened that
Not-So-Lucky Lilly had indulged in a lemon
poppy seed muffin for lunch. Poppy seeds are
narcotics. Narcotics are banned."Just say no to
muffins" is a lesson Lilly learned the hard way.
The sad thing is that no matter what ridicu
lous scenarios we come up with, we're simply
not up to the task of devising sillier scenes than
have already happened in real life. A few years
ago, the University of Utah basketball coach
got in trouble for buying a player a burger for
dinner. Are we kidding? No, we're not.
All these situations make us wonder:
There are 33 articles and 510 pages in the
NCAA rulebook — how many athletic ca
reers (not to mention trees) could be saved if
the powers-that-be stuck with the rule of
common sense?
