# Dating obsession everywhere
## 
### 
True to Stanford's obsession with dating
on campus, this Tuesday's Reformed
University Fellowship (RUF) meeting
was part of a series on sex. marriage and dat
ing. When we took this column gig, we vowed
never to write a dating column. And this is not
a dating column. Yet in the months since we
began pursuing weekly column topics, we've
learned that dating, or rather, thinking about
dating, is the one true force uniting the Stan
ford community. Sometimes joking, and
sometimes inappropriately serious,you'll hear
the same discussions at Christian Fellowships,
at the LGBTCRC, at the Women's Center, in
lamentable Daily columns and worst, in
apologetic conversations with your parents.
Even so, the RUF meeting, in the presence
of Jesus, was a place where we, with our nomi
nally Jewish backgrounds, were likely to feel
out of place. Instead, we felt welcome and only
a smidge out of place, as we sang along to
songs about Jesus with the other 40 Stanford
students in the room.
When the singing ended, the crowd took
out books and notes. Everyone paused in that
brief instant of awaiting wisdom. But this was
not a lecture, not a classroom. We were listen
ing to a sermon.
Using techniques that would be right at
home in the classroom, the Reverend David
Jones analyzed verses from Ezekiel." You may

think it surprising that Ezekiel has anything to
say about dating." We would have turned to
the passage, and been surprised, but we left
our Bibles at the library. The Reverend's
methods of analyzing the Bible could have
been mistaken for many a professor's inter
pretive humanities lecture. The talk was of
metaphors and motivations and insight. Song
writers were quoted frequently And in the
end. Rev. Jones attempted what every great
Stanford professor attempts: imparting wis
dom and inspiring students to use it in their
own lives.
As Stanford students, we are trained to be
rational, questioning thinkers. Cynical by na
ture and probing by training, we demand evi
dence and data to support our beliefs. Is scrib
bling notes on the idolatrous nature of dating
so antithetical to the ways of academia? After
all, Stanford students are writing theses on
everything from speed dating to animal hus

bandry.The Bible itself is probably studied in
as many classrooms as Shakespeare. Maybe
academia and religion aren't as far apart as we
think they are.
But the mingling, songs of praise, organiza
tion of pick-up football games and talk of hos
pital visits distanced the fellowship from typi
cal classrooms. But the greatest difference was
that in this room no one raised a hand after the
sermon with a question. There was no public
forum for debate, confusion or dissent. No one
offered or took any tests of faith. Mastery of
the material would show directly in the ac
tions of one's life.
As we walked away, we pondered the Rev
erend's message: Looking to another person
for satisfaction is a sign that you aren't finding
fulfillment in Jesus. Our hearts are broken cis
terns, and can never be entirely filled by the
limited love of another person. To fill us, we
need an unending waterfall of love that can
only come from God.
We momentarily questioned the idolatrous
power of our hearts, sounding the depths of
our private cisterns. We didn't know if our cis
terns were whole or broken, but one thing was
certain — we were still single.
