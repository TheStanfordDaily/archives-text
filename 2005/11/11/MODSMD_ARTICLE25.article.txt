## Green should sleep during the day 
### WOODY GLIER 
Regarding "Senator proposes Green
hours extension" (Nov. 9): It is a shame that
an academic institution of Stanford's caliber
has not yet taken steps to improve the study
environment on campus — especially in its
main library. As much as those in the admin
istration would like to believe otherwise, the
study habits of a typical Stanford student do
not conform nicely with the 12 to 18 hour
schedule of most corporate employees.
Rather, they tend to resemble a series of 5-
day benders where lecture, studying, paper
writing and sleeping occur as time permits
and demand necessitates.
When it's 4 a.m. and you're rapidly ap
proaching the 10 a.m. deadline for your 10-
page paper; are out of Red Bull; don't have a
car to go grab coffee and a burger at Jack in
the Box (because Stanford told your parents
that a car wasn't necessary and the campus
had everything); Moonbeans closes seeming
ly when the sun goes down and the CoHo not
long after that, you wish you were an engi
neer with access to the quiet labs and spa
cious study rooms of buildings like Packard

or Gates. Dorm study areas or the cramped
confines of a one-room double are not ade
quate substitutes for the private stacks or
spacious tables of Green Library.
I thought Stanford might have been on
the right track with the multi-million dollar
renovation of Tresidder Union a year or so
ago, but I was proven wrong. They decided
that it makes little sense to leave a spacious
area with wireless Internet and a plethora of
tables open for students to use when the li
brary closes at midnight. After all. who stays
up later than midnight working anyway?
Sure, I understand that keeping Green
Library open later on Fridays, and especially
in general, costs money. What doesn't? But
students deserve better; Stanford deserves
better. Students need to have an appropriate
working environment that doesn't resemble
an Internet cafe with 1960s decor, an envi
ronment that isn't the size of a jail cell and
one that isn't a dorm lounge with constant
interruptions from drunken revelers who
gave up on their problem sets hours ago.
Is it absurd for me to suggest that we look
to our illustrious Office of Development for
help in this matter? No lie folks, the individu

als in the Arrillaga Alumni Center work hard
to keep this University what it is and are
doing so at a record-setting pace (gifts to
Stanford just surpassed gifts to Harvard for
the first time ever).
Just about anything on a campus can be
named after alumni for the right price, so why
not extended hours at Green? It's just a mat
ter of branding. Late Night at Green brought
to you by Helen and Peter Bing. Introducing
Arrillaga Hours at Green. Green After
Hours sponsored by Google (corporate do
nations are really big these days). The possi
bilities are endless.
Although I hate to admit it, Stanford stu
dents are not inherently smarter than stu
dents at any of our East Coast imitators —
we just work harder. It's about time the Uni
versity recognizes that a little coin to im
prove our access to its world-class facilities
will go a long way in making us better stu
dents and better future leaders.
