# Men cross the Bay to face California in final game
## Cardinal with a chance to finish season on a high note against No.9 Bears 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer has two distinct, yet related objectives this
weekend when it travels to No. y California — one, to beat the high
ly touted Golden Bears in order to honor a battle-worn senior class;
and two, to build momentum for its young players, whose best season
is likely ahead of them.

The Cardinal (4-10-3,
1 -6-2 Pacific 10 Conference) are
coming off one of their most
promising but frustrating week
ends of the season, in which they
dominated possession and gen
erated numerous shots but were
still unable to get a goal in their
two contests. This Sunday, Stan
ford plans to keep the offensive
effort up and put some of these
scoring chances away against
the Bears (12-3-2.5-3-1).
"On Wednesday, we
only practiced finishing and
kept everything in front of the

goal," head coach Bret Simon said. "We need to keep working on our
team attack plays, and [in the longer run] continue to emphasize re
cruiting forwards and aggressive players."
Stanford entered the season with one of the youngest clubs in the
conference, and injuries have decimated much of the older leadership
that the team had. Last weekend, the Cardinal could only start one of
their seniors. Despite limited playing time, the program has benefited
greatly from the work of the class of 2006, and the team wants to send
off its three seniors with a victory.
"Rivalries just give us another reason to come out and play hard."

Sophomore defender Scott Bolkan and the Cardinal have a chance to upset the No. 9 Bears and end
[he season with a win in Berkeley this Sunday.
sophomore defender Kyle Hency
said. "We would love nothing more
than to send Cal into the playoffs
losing their last game to their biggest
rival. Also, we want to thank the sen
iors for their contribution over the
past four years with a win. Their
leadership and presence will without
a doubt be missed."
Taking down the Bears will not
be a simple task. Cal presents any
defense a challenge, as it currently
leads the Pac-10 in all scoring cate
gories with 31 goals, 83 total points
and 1.82 goals per game. The most
dynamic player in this offense is sen
ior forward Calen Carr, who leads
the conference with 10 goals and 23
points. But the Golden Bears are far
from a one-man show. The Stanford
coaching staff respects Cal's depth
of talent so much that on Simon's all
conference ballot, seven of his 22 se
lections play for Berkeley.
Emotion also runs high for the
Bears, who are on the heels of a
painful tie to UCLA that mathemat
ically eliminated their chances of
being conference champions.
The Cardinal not only have to
stop the lauded offense but also
must break down an underrated de
fense. In order to do this, they must
remedy the offensive inefficiency
that has been exacerbated by the de
parture of leading scorer sophomore
forward Marcus Ryan from the team
more than two weeks ago. Replace

ments sophomore Dan Shapiro and
sophomore Scott Bolkan — who
converted from defense to striker —
have done an admirable job and
started to emerge in last weekend's
home stand.
"Cal is a team that likes to keep
the ball and play a lot of one and two
touch, so the defense is going to have
to step up the pressure in order to
disrupt their flow of play," Hency
said. "Once we do that, we are going
to have to finish the chances given
us, and that is what we've been work
ing on this week thus far."
Stanford has fallen short of the
NCAA postseason for the third
straight season, so the significance of
the match for the Cardinal may be
the precedent they set for 2006. The
one benefit of its youth is that Stan
ford looks to return a strong core
that went through a trial-by-fire for
much of this year. Already, experi
ence has wrought improvement, and
a breakthrough win at the end of the
season could create momentum in
the offseason and pay dividends in
the future.
"[A win] could impact our team
very much in the offseason." Hency
said. "After last weekend, where we
saw some good things, there is al
ready a different feel on the team. If
we could top that off with a big win
against Cal it would send us into the
offseason with even higher expecta
tions for the coming year."
If this young squad can pull off
the upset, it would not only be a
crowning achievement on a season
that has seen so much adversity but
also a possible preview of success to
come.

must break down an underrated de
fense. In order to do this, they must
remedy the offensive inefficiency
that has been exacerbated by the de
parture of leading scorer sophomore
forward Marcus Ryan from the team
more than two weeks ago. Replace

ments sophomore Dan Shapiro and
sophomore Scott Bolkan — who
converted from defense to striker —
have done an admirable job and
started to emerge in last weekend's
home stand.
"Cal is a team that likes to keep
the ball and play a lot of one and two
touch, so the defense is going to have
to step up the pressure in order to
disrupt their flow of play," Hency
said. "Once we do that, we are going
to have to finish the chances given
us, and that is what we've been work
ing on this week thus far."
Stanford has fallen short of the
NCAA postseason for the third
straight season, so the significance of
the match for the Cardinal may be
the precedent they set for 2006. The
one benefit of its youth is that Stan
ford looks to return a strong core
that went through a trial-by-fire for
much of this year. Already, experi
ence has wrought improvement, and
a breakthrough win at the end of the
season could create momentum in
the offseason and pay dividends in
the future.
"[A win] could impact our team
very much in the offseason." Hency
said. "After last weekend, where we
saw some good things, there is al
ready a different feel on the team. If
we could top that off with a big win
against Cal it would send us into the
offseason with even higher expecta
tions for the coming year."
If this young squad can pull off
the upset, it would not only be a
crowning achievement on a season
that has seen so much adversity but
also a possible preview of success to
come.
Stanford men's soccer has two distinct, yet related objectives this
weekend when it travels to No. y California — one, to beat the high
ly touted Golden Bears in order to honor a battle-worn senior class;
and two, to build momentum for its young players, whose best season
is likely ahead of them.

The Cardinal (4-10-3,
1 -6-2 Pacific 10 Conference) are
coming off one of their most
promising but frustrating week
ends of the season, in which they
dominated possession and gen
erated numerous shots but were
still unable to get a goal in their
two contests. This Sunday, Stan
ford plans to keep the offensive
effort up and put some of these
scoring chances away against
the Bears (12-3-2.5-3-1).
"On Wednesday, we
only practiced finishing and
kept everything in front of the

goal," head coach Bret Simon said. "We need to keep working on our
team attack plays, and [in the longer run] continue to emphasize re
cruiting forwards and aggressive players."
Stanford entered the season with one of the youngest clubs in the
conference, and injuries have decimated much of the older leadership
that the team had. Last weekend, the Cardinal could only start one of
their seniors. Despite limited playing time, the program has benefited
greatly from the work of the class of 2006, and the team wants to send
off its three seniors with a victory.
"Rivalries just give us another reason to come out and play hard."

Sophomore defender Scott Bolkan and the Cardinal have a chance to upset the No. 9 Bears and end
[he season with a win in Berkeley this Sunday.
sophomore defender Kyle Hency
said. "We would love nothing more
than to send Cal into the playoffs
losing their last game to their biggest
rival. Also, we want to thank the sen
iors for their contribution over the
past four years with a win. Their
leadership and presence will without
a doubt be missed."
Taking down the Bears will not
be a simple task. Cal presents any
defense a challenge, as it currently
leads the Pac-10 in all scoring cate
gories with 31 goals, 83 total points
and 1.82 goals per game. The most
dynamic player in this offense is sen
ior forward Calen Carr, who leads
the conference with 10 goals and 23
points. But the Golden Bears are far
from a one-man show. The Stanford
coaching staff respects Cal's depth
of talent so much that on Simon's all
conference ballot, seven of his 22 se
lections play for Berkeley.
Emotion also runs high for the
Bears, who are on the heels of a
painful tie to UCLA that mathemat
ically eliminated their chances of
being conference champions.
The Cardinal not only have to
stop the lauded offense but also
must break down an underrated de
fense. In order to do this, they must
remedy the offensive inefficiency
