# Men cross the Bay to face California in final game
## Cardinal with a chance to finish season on a high note against No.9 Bears 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer has two distinct, yet related objectives this
weekend when it travels to No. y California â€” one, to beat the high
ly touted Golden Bears in order to honor a battle-worn senior class;
and two, to build momentum for its young players, whose best season
is likely ahead of them.

The Cardinal (4-10-3,
1 -6-2 Pacific 10 Conference) are
coming off one of their most
promising but frustrating week
ends of the season, in which they
dominated possession and gen
erated numerous shots but were
still unable to get a goal in their
two contests. This Sunday, Stan
ford plans to keep the offensive
effort up and put some of these
scoring chances away against
the Bears (12-3-2.5-3-1).
"On Wednesday, we
only practiced finishing and
kept everything in front of the

goal," head coach Bret Simon said. "We need to keep working on our
team attack plays, and [in the longer run] continue to emphasize re
cruiting forwards and aggressive players."
Stanford entered the season with one of the youngest clubs in the
conference, and injuries have decimated much of the older leadership
that the team had. Last weekend, the Cardinal could only start one of
their seniors. Despite limited playing time, the program has benefited
greatly from the work of the class of 2006, and the team wants to send
off its three seniors with a victory.
"Rivalries just give us another reason to come out and play hard."
