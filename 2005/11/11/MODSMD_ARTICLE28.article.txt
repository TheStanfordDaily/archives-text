# No.4 Stanford preparing for the upcoming MPSF tournament
## Cardinal face No.14 UC-Santa Barbara tomorrow at home 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
With two games remaining on their reg
ular season schedule. No. 4 Stanford men's
water polo team faces perhaps the greatest
challenge of its season this Saturday as it
takes on No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara.
It's not just a tough squad that the Cardi

nal (15-5,4-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation ) need to contend with this weekend —
it's also the fact that the critical MPSF con
ference tournament starts two weeks from
today, and the Stanford squad currently has
no momentum working to its advantage.
Hie Cardinal carried high hopes last
weekend as they traveled south to take on
top-ranked Southern California and No. 6
UC-Irvine. And coming off impressive vic
tories over 2004 national champion UCLA
and No. 5 Pepperdine, the Stanford men
had every reason to be optimistic — the of
fense was clicking, the defense was provid
ing key stops against the six-on-five advan

tage and sophomore goalie Sandy I lohener
was rock-solid in net.
But what started as a trip of great expec
tations slowly turned into a nightmare trip.
In the first half of their showdown against
powerful USC, the Cardinal failed to con
tain a single Trojan man-up advantage and
quickly fell behind 4-2. Stanford, led by sen
ior captain and driver Peter Varellas.
mounted a charge and managed to send the
game to overtime. But the Trojan attack got
the best of the Stanford defense in the final
seconds of overtime to clinch the 8-7 USC
