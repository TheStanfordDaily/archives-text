# No.4 Stanford preparing for the upcoming MPSF tournament
## Cardinal face No.14 UC-Santa Barbara tomorrow at home 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
With two games remaining on their reg
ular season schedule. No. 4 Stanford men's
water polo team faces perhaps the greatest
challenge of its season this Saturday as it
takes on No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara.
It's not just a tough squad that the Cardi

nal (15-5,4-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation ) need to contend with this weekend —
it's also the fact that the critical MPSF con
ference tournament starts two weeks from
today, and the Stanford squad currently has
no momentum working to its advantage.
Hie Cardinal carried high hopes last
weekend as they traveled south to take on
top-ranked Southern California and No. 6
UC-Irvine. And coming off impressive vic
tories over 2004 national champion UCLA
and No. 5 Pepperdine, the Stanford men
had every reason to be optimistic — the of
fense was clicking, the defense was provid
ing key stops against the six-on-five advan

tage and sophomore goalie Sandy I lohener
was rock-solid in net.
But what started as a trip of great expec
tations slowly turned into a nightmare trip.
In the first half of their showdown against
powerful USC, the Cardinal failed to con
tain a single Trojan man-up advantage and
quickly fell behind 4-2. Stanford, led by sen
ior captain and driver Peter Varellas.
mounted a charge and managed to send the
game to overtime. But the Trojan attack got
the best of the Stanford defense in the final
seconds of overtime to clinch the 8-7 USC

victory.
The very next day, the Cardinal
watched as the Anteaters came out
strong and tallied three unanswered
goals in the opening period of play to
take a commanding lead. The Stan
ford men finally got going offensive
ly in the second period, but the

Irvine squad hung on to win.B-5, and
sent the Cardinal to the showers
stunned by their second loss in two
days. It was the first time since 2002
that Stanford had lost consecutive
games in the same weekend.
The Cardinal now confront the dif
ficult challenge of regaining their lost
momentum in time for the upcoming
MFSF conference tournament, held
the weekend after Thanksgiving. At
stake in the MPSF tournament are
two bids to the NCAA tournament
the following weekend — a tourna

ment the Cardinal haven't missed in
the last four years.
To earn one of those two bids, the
Cardinal need to reach the title
match of the MPSF tournament —
no small task, considering the quali
ty of the teams they could face along
the way. Nevertheless, it's a task the
team knows it can accomplish with
the right combination of skill, mo
mentum and intelligent play.
"Our margin of error is slim,"
Varellas said. "But we definitely
have the talent and teamwork to

beat any team on any given day."
The Cardinal also realize that the
key to a successful stretch run is the
ability to focus their attention on one
game at a time. For Stanford, that
run starts Saturday against Santa
Barbara.
"We're taking things one game at
a time," said sophomore two-meter
defender Peter Finlayson."lf we take
care of business one game at a time,
then we will be where we want to be
at the end of the year — holding the
national championship trophy."
