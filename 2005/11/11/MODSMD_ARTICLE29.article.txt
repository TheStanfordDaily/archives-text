## The 						hottest new varsity sport: Procrastination 
### 
Did you know that in its entire lifetime,the av
erage worker bee produces 1/12 a teaspoon
of honey? I only mention it because that
output is a billion times more than I've produced
tonight.
For a guy who has a midterm tomorrow (which 1
will fail) anil a project due (which 1 haven't started),
I've really shot myself in the foot this time. Fortu
nately. there's a silver lining to this cloud: I've come
up with a column — " I"he Sport of Procrastination!"
Seriously, this is beyond your everyday wasting
of a few minutes by facebooking on the internet.
I've turned this into a true competition.The winner?
Me or she who wastes the most time without actual
ly getting any work done. Not that any of you need
the help, but I've compiled a list of a few activities in
which one may engage to avoid doing actual work
and increase your Procrastination Time.
First off, you aren't allowed to get drunk, high or
otherwise alter your mental state. TTie point of Pro
crastination is that you are doing something instead
of work.Thus, you must be able to do actual work. If
you are in no condition to complete your assign
ment. then you're not Procrastinating, you're just
worthless.
The easiest thing one can do is to surf the inter
net aimlessly. Once you get through your standards
(e-mail, facebook, ESPN, New York Times... what
ever). try this little exercise. You've all heard of
stream of consciousness writing? Try stream of con
sciousness surfing. Get on Google and just type in
whatever you're thinking of and start clicking away.
That's how I ended up with that fun fact you read at
the opening of this column.
You don't need a browser to waste time on a net
work though. Just open your instant messenger and
talk endlessly to the people who live less than a mile
from you. The best part? You're most likely talking
about absolutely nothing of consequence — bonus
points in the sport of Procrastination!
If you're nowhere near a modem, find that creepy
CS guy (come on girls, who are we kidding?) from
down the hall and ask him about his newest video or
computer game. TTien sit down and enjoy the wild
ride through the three-hour history of the Magic:
The (iathering — Battlefields saga. If you're lucky,
you'll find someone with an old-school Nintendo
(I'm talking eight-byte, baby!), which is about where
my video gaming proficiency ended.
So maybe electronics aren't your
thing. There are plenty of other moves
to be made to increase your P-Time.
Try indiscriminate grazing across the
open kitchen. Dinner leftovers, lunch
leftovers, snacks, cereals, it doesn't
matter. Just get out there and slowly
munch on whatever's there. Feeling
full at the moment? Well, now you've
got a second distraction. Everyone
poops! Head to the bathroom and
waste a few minutes taking the
Browns to the Super Bowl.
Now when was the last time you
cleaned up your room? Seriously,
that laundry is starting to stand up
without a hanger. Do the laundry',
pick up that paper draft that your I-
Hum TF used to run out the ink of
his red pen, or rearrange the books
on your shelf. And when was the last
time that your carpet was cleaned?
Bust out the vacuum! Rearrange the
posters! It's all good.
Here's another idea: read some
thing. Now the key here is that when
you read, it's got to have absolutely
nothing to do with school work (it's

not Procrastination if you accom
plish anything). Tonight, I reintro
duced myself to the magical world of
Calvin and Hobbes.
Finally, I'm going to suggest
something extremely drastic here:
Talk to the person next door. Noth
ing wastes time better than debating
who had the worst PWR class or
whether or not the Stanford football
team has a shot at a bowl game.
You'll learn so many things that still
won't get you any closer to finishing
that take-home midterm. Somehow
the history of "Family Guy" is an in
significant stitch in the fabric of
American history.
Okay, so these are just a few sug
gestions on how to get your P-Time
up and competitive. These are just a
start, however; get out there and try
new ways to get nothing done. I've
set my personal record at seven
hours in a single day. Remember, it
doesn't count unless you've actually
got something hanging over your
head. As for me, I'm banking on the
fact that I thrive under pressure.

amazed he was able to sit down and

to avoid doing anything productive.

my video gaming proficiency ended.
So maybe electronics aren't your
thing. There are plenty of other moves
to be made to increase your P-Time.
Try indiscriminate grazing across the
open kitchen. Dinner leftovers, lunch
leftovers, snacks, cereals, it doesn't
matter. Just get out there and slowly
munch on whatever's there. Feeling
full at the moment? Well, now you've
got a second distraction. Everyone
poops! Head to the bathroom and
waste a few minutes taking the
Browns to the Super Bowl.
Now when was the last time you
cleaned up your room? Seriously,
that laundry is starting to stand up
without a hanger. Do the laundry',
pick up that paper draft that your I-
Hum TF used to run out the ink of
his red pen, or rearrange the books
on your shelf. And when was the last
time that your carpet was cleaned?
Bust out the vacuum! Rearrange the
posters! It's all good.
Here's another idea: read some
thing. Now the key here is that when
you read, it's got to have absolutely
nothing to do with school work (it's

not Procrastination if you accom
plish anything). Tonight, I reintro
duced myself to the magical world of
Calvin and Hobbes.
Finally, I'm going to suggest
something extremely drastic here:
Talk to the person next door. Noth
ing wastes time better than debating
who had the worst PWR class or
whether or not the Stanford football
team has a shot at a bowl game.
You'll learn so many things that still
won't get you any closer to finishing
that take-home midterm. Somehow
the history of "Family Guy" is an in
significant stitch in the fabric of
American history.
Okay, so these are just a few sug
gestions on how to get your P-Time
up and competitive. These are just a
start, however; get out there and try
new ways to get nothing done. I've
set my personal record at seven
hours in a single day. Remember, it
doesn't count unless you've actually
got something hanging over your
head. As for me, I'm banking on the
fact that I thrive under pressure.

Andrew Rogers is a senior that is
amazed he was able to sit down and
write this column. E-mailing him at
arogers@stan ford.edu is a great way
to avoid doing anything productive.
Did you know that in its entire lifetime,the av
erage worker bee produces 1/12 a teaspoon
of honey? I only mention it because that
output is a billion times more than I've produced
tonight.
For a guy who has a midterm tomorrow (which 1
will fail) anil a project due (which 1 haven't started),
I've really shot myself in the foot this time. Fortu
nately. there's a silver lining to this cloud: I've come
up with a column — " I"he Sport of Procrastination!"
Seriously, this is beyond your everyday wasting
of a few minutes by facebooking on the internet.
I've turned this into a true competition.The winner?
Me or she who wastes the most time without actual
ly getting any work done. Not that any of you need
the help, but I've compiled a list of a few activities in
which one may engage to avoid doing actual work
and increase your Procrastination Time.
First off, you aren't allowed to get drunk, high or
otherwise alter your mental state. TTie point of Pro
crastination is that you are doing something instead
of work.Thus, you must be able to do actual work. If
you are in no condition to complete your assign
ment. then you're not Procrastinating, you're just
worthless.
The easiest thing one can do is to surf the inter
net aimlessly. Once you get through your standards
(e-mail, facebook, ESPN, New York Times... what
ever). try this little exercise. You've all heard of
stream of consciousness writing? Try stream of con
sciousness surfing. Get on Google and just type in
whatever you're thinking of and start clicking away.
That's how I ended up with that fun fact you read at
the opening of this column.
You don't need a browser to waste time on a net
work though. Just open your instant messenger and
talk endlessly to the people who live less than a mile
from you. The best part? You're most likely talking
about absolutely nothing of consequence — bonus
points in the sport of Procrastination!
If you're nowhere near a modem, find that creepy
CS guy (come on girls, who are we kidding?) from
down the hall and ask him about his newest video or
computer game. TTien sit down and enjoy the wild
ride through the three-hour history of the Magic:
The (iathering — Battlefields saga. If you're lucky,
you'll find someone with an old-school Nintendo
(I'm talking eight-byte, baby!), which is about where
my video gaming proficiency ended.
