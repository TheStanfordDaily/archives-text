## The
						hottest new varsity sport: Procrastination 
### 
Did you know that in its entire lifetime,the av
erage worker bee produces 1/12 a teaspoon
of honey? I only mention it because that
output is a billion times more than I've produced
tonight.
For a guy who has a midterm tomorrow (which 1
will fail) anil a project due (which 1 haven't started),
I've really shot myself in the foot this time. Fortu
nately. there's a silver lining to this cloud: I've come
up with a column — " I"he Sport of Procrastination!"
Seriously, this is beyond your everyday wasting
of a few minutes by facebooking on the internet.
I've turned this into a true competition.The winner?
Me or she who wastes the most time without actual
ly getting any work done. Not that any of you need
the help, but I've compiled a list of a few activities in
which one may engage to avoid doing actual work
and increase your Procrastination Time.
First off, you aren't allowed to get drunk, high or
otherwise alter your mental state. TTie point of Pro
crastination is that you are doing something instead
of work.Thus, you must be able to do actual work. If
you are in no condition to complete your assign
ment. then you're not Procrastinating, you're just
worthless.
The easiest thing one can do is to surf the inter
net aimlessly. Once you get through your standards
(e-mail, facebook, ESPN, New York Times... what
ever). try this little exercise. You've all heard of
stream of consciousness writing? Try stream of con
sciousness surfing. Get on Google and just type in
whatever you're thinking of and start clicking away.
That's how I ended up with that fun fact you read at
the opening of this column.
You don't need a browser to waste time on a net
work though. Just open your instant messenger and
talk endlessly to the people who live less than a mile
from you. The best part? You're most likely talking
about absolutely nothing of consequence — bonus
points in the sport of Procrastination!
If you're nowhere near a modem, find that creepy
CS guy (come on girls, who are we kidding?) from
down the hall and ask him about his newest video or
computer game. TTien sit down and enjoy the wild
ride through the three-hour history of the Magic:
The (iathering — Battlefields saga. If you're lucky,
you'll find someone with an old-school Nintendo
(I'm talking eight-byte, baby!), which is about where
my video gaming proficiency ended.
