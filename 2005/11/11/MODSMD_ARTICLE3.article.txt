# Card look past recent bowl history
## Stanford hasn't earned a bowl berth since 2001 and hasn't won since 1996 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
When the Cardinal return home
from Corvallis this weekend after fac
ing Oregon State in one of the most cru
cial games of the year, they'll likely
know if their postseason dreams are
still alive.
If the Cardinal are able to pick up
the victory on the road, they would
need just one more win in two home
games to reach the six-win mark — and
become bowl eligible for the first time
since 2(X)1.
But if they fall, it will take victories in
the final two games of the season —
one against archrival Cal and the other
against a Notre Dame team currently
ranked in the nation's top 10 — to earn
a coveted spot in a postseason game.
Stanford's recent bowl history hasn't
been particularly proud. Not only have
the Cardinal not participated in post
season play since the Tyrone Willing
ham era, they haven't won a bowl game
since the iy%Sun Bowl.
The recent failures put even more
pressure on how these next three games
go for the Cardinal, who are 4-4 overall
and 3-3 in the conference.
"I think that if we had players that
weren't good enough to win six games,
in our situation, [the season] couldn't be
a success," senior receiver Justin Mc-
Cullum said.
While making a bowl is important to
the team, the general feeling seems to
be that the Oregon State game comes
first — as hard as it may be to put the
need for two wins on the back burner.
"These are Stanford kids...they can
count," head coach Walt Harris said.
"They did pretty well on the math part
of their SAT's as you could imagine, but
my responsibility as a coach is to keep
them on track. We're not the kind of
TREVOR HOOPER

team that can envision more than one
game at a time,even though I think there is
some credence to the fact that it's down to
a three-game season. But right now our
focus has to be Oregon State."
Ultimately, it is up to the players to per
form on the field and prepare themselves
for the individual challenges each week.
"Every game we go out to win," McCul
lum said."Each week we play as hard as we
can to win. Our backs are to the wall now
and guys might be working a little harder. 1
don't think that it will change our prepara
tion — or it shouldn't at least."
If Stanford is to have a shot at picking
up the needed wins, it will have to bounce
back after two straight difficult losses: a 30-
27 meltdown loss to UCLA and a 51-21
blowout loss to USC.
"Nothing has changed because of the
two losses in the last two weeks," senior
safety Trevor Hooper said. "Our goal is to
be bowl-eligible and win all of the rest of
our games, but without a doubt two of our
next three. We're starting this week to try
to get that first win. Coach Harris is calling
it a three-game season, and we're trying to
go undefeated."
Stanford's last bowl appearance came
in 2001 when the then No. 11 Cardinal
earned a bid to the Seattle Bowl with a 9-2
regular season record. They squared off

against an unranked Georgia Tech team,
who proved too much to handle for the
heavily favored Cardinal, taking the con
test 24-14.
In that game Stanford missed a number
of opportunities deep in Georgia Tech ter
ritory and could only come away with field
goals.The Cardinal did cut the Yellow Jack
ets' lead to three after a short Teyo Johnson
touchdown reception in the fourth quarter
but couldn't complete the comeback.
Two years earlier, Stanford made its
first Rose Bowl appearance since 1972
against then No. 4 Wisconsin. The Badgers,
led by Heisman Trophy winner Ron
Dayne, trailed the Cardinal 9-3 at the half,
but their defense held strong and held on
for a 17-9 win.
The last Stanford postseason win came
in 1996 in the Sun Bowl against Michigan
State. The Cardinal dismantled the Spar
tans, dominating every aspect of the game
and winning 38-0. Stanford, led by quarter
back Chad Hutchison, recovered from a 2-
5 start on the season to clinch a bowl birth
and finish the year 7-5.
A late-season rally is exactly what the
Cardinal look to duplicate this season, as
they push to make what would be the 21st
bowl in school history. But to do it, they will
have to try to ignore some recent history
and create a little history of their own.

blowout loss to USC.
"Nothing has changed because of the
two losses in the last two weeks," senior
safety Trevor Hooper said. "Our goal is to
be bowl-eligible and win all of the rest of
our games, but without a doubt two of our
next three. We're starting this week to try
to get that first win. Coach Harris is calling
it a three-game season, and we're trying to
go undefeated."
Stanford's last bowl appearance came
in 2001 when the then No. 11 Cardinal
earned a bid to the Seattle Bowl with a 9-2
regular season record. They squared off

against an unranked Georgia Tech team,
who proved too much to handle for the
heavily favored Cardinal, taking the con
test 24-14.
In that game Stanford missed a number
of opportunities deep in Georgia Tech ter
ritory and could only come away with field
goals.The Cardinal did cut the Yellow Jack
ets' lead to three after a short Teyo Johnson
touchdown reception in the fourth quarter
but couldn't complete the comeback.
Two years earlier, Stanford made its
first Rose Bowl appearance since 1972
against then No. 4 Wisconsin. The Badgers,
led by Heisman Trophy winner Ron
Dayne, trailed the Cardinal 9-3 at the half,
but their defense held strong and held on
for a 17-9 win.
The last Stanford postseason win came
in 1996 in the Sun Bowl against Michigan
State. The Cardinal dismantled the Spar
tans, dominating every aspect of the game
and winning 38-0. Stanford, led by quarter
back Chad Hutchison, recovered from a 2-
5 start on the season to clinch a bowl birth
and finish the year 7-5.
A late-season rally is exactly what the
Cardinal look to duplicate this season, as
they push to make what would be the 21st
bowl in school history. But to do it, they will
have to try to ignore some recent history
and create a little history of their own.

When the Cardinal return home
from Corvallis this weekend after fac
ing Oregon State in one of the most cru
cial games of the year, they'll likely
know if their postseason dreams are
still alive.
If the Cardinal are able to pick up
the victory on the road, they would
need just one more win in two home
games to reach the six-win mark — and
become bowl eligible for the first time
since 2(X)1.
But if they fall, it will take victories in
the final two games of the season —
one against archrival Cal and the other
against a Notre Dame team currently
ranked in the nation's top 10 — to earn
a coveted spot in a postseason game.
Stanford's recent bowl history hasn't
been particularly proud. Not only have
the Cardinal not participated in post
season play since the Tyrone Willing
ham era, they haven't won a bowl game
since the iy%Sun Bowl.
The recent failures put even more
pressure on how these next three games
go for the Cardinal, who are 4-4 overall
and 3-3 in the conference.
"I think that if we had players that
weren't good enough to win six games,
in our situation, [the season] couldn't be
a success," senior receiver Justin Mc-
Cullum said.
While making a bowl is important to
the team, the general feeling seems to
be that the Oregon State game comes
first — as hard as it may be to put the
need for two wins on the back burner.
"These are Stanford kids...they can
count," head coach Walt Harris said.
"They did pretty well on the math part
of their SAT's as you could imagine, but
my responsibility as a coach is to keep
them on track. We're not the kind of
TREVOR HOOPER

team that can envision more than one
game at a time,even though I think there is
some credence to the fact that it's down to
a three-game season. But right now our
focus has to be Oregon State."
Ultimately, it is up to the players to per
form on the field and prepare themselves
for the individual challenges each week.
"Every game we go out to win," McCul
lum said."Each week we play as hard as we
can to win. Our backs are to the wall now
and guys might be working a little harder. 1
don't think that it will change our prepara
tion — or it shouldn't at least."
If Stanford is to have a shot at picking
up the needed wins, it will have to bounce
back after two straight difficult losses: a 30-
27 meltdown loss to UCLA and a 51-21
blowout loss to USC.
