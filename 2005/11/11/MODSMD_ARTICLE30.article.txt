Stanford Golf Course
on Saturday. Admis
sion is free,the weather
forecast predicts sunny
conditions and so far
this season, the Cardi
nal women are unde
feated and the men
have won all but one
meet.
Just two weeks ago
the men and women
swept the Pacific 10
Conference Champi
onships in Tucson,
Ariz. The women have
won West Regionals
the last six years, while
the men have claimed
the West Regional title
for the past 10.
The competition

kicks off at 11 a.m. when the No. 4 Cardinal men are slat
ed to race 1 (),(KK) meters against 27 other teams from the
West Coast.The men face talented teams like No. 9 Ari
zona, No. 13 Portland, No. 24 Cal Poly, No. 28 California
and No. 29 Washington.
The No. 2 women meet their biggest West Coast rival
once again — No. 5 Arizona State, who was only six
points behind the Cardinal at Pac-10 Championships.
Other nationally ranked women's teams include No. 21
Oregon and No. 26 Washington. The women's course is
6,000 meters.
The top two men's and women's teams from West
Regionals automatically qualify for the NCAA Nation
al Championship meet on Nov. 21. In addition to the top
two teams from each region, 13 at-large teams and two
at-large individuals will also be selected to compete at
the national championship race.
"Those teams that have been ranked in the top 30 na
tionwide would be teams that have a great chance to
participate at NCAA Nationals," head coach Peter
Tegen said.
Much work has gone into altering the course this year
because of the short rest time between Regionals and
Nationals.
"The course has been changed some," Tegen said.
"We had to eliminate some really tough spots, so that not
everyone is beaten up when they finally get to the Na
tional Championships."
Because the men run 10,000 meters — approximate
ly 6.2 miles — a back-to-back racing situation is more
taxing for them than for the women, who run approxi
mately 3.7 miles. Tegen plans to announce the 14 men
and women running on the morning of the race. The
seven men and seven women will be chosen from the
group that raced at the Pac-lOs two weeks ago.
At Regionals last year, sophomore Teresa McWalters
finished fifth, while junior Katy Trotter was seventh.The
Cardinal's own Alicia Craig, a 2005 graduate, won the
title for the third straight year.

On the men's side, sophomore Neftalem Araia was
third, while junior Jonathan Pierce was 10th. Another
2005 graduate. Ryan Hall, was the men's West Region
champion last year.
The meet kicks off with the men's competition. ITie
women's race begins at 12:15 p.m. Both courses begin and
end on Electioneer Road, near the stables and the Stan

ford Barn, north of the Stanford Golf Course.The meet is
only the second home meet for the Cardinal this season.
"I think it always helps to have the meet at home in a
way, because if nothing else, you don't have to travel,"
Tegen said. "That is a very welcome change.There is also
a great value in having it at home as far as spectator and
fan support."

dinal and held on the
Stanford Golf Course
on Saturday. Admis
sion is free,the weather
forecast predicts sunny
conditions and so far
this season, the Cardi
nal women are unde
feated and the men
have won all but one
meet.
Just two weeks ago
the men and women
swept the Pacific 10
Conference Champi
onships in Tucson,
Ariz. The women have
won West Regionals
the last six years, while
the men have claimed
the West Regional title
for the past 10.
The competition

kicks off at 11 a.m. when the No. 4 Cardinal men are slat
ed to race 1 (),(KK) meters against 27 other teams from the
West Coast.The men face talented teams like No. 9 Ari
zona, No. 13 Portland, No. 24 Cal Poly, No. 28 California
and No. 29 Washington.
The No. 2 women meet their biggest West Coast rival
once again — No. 5 Arizona State, who was only six
points behind the Cardinal at Pac-10 Championships.
Other nationally ranked women's teams include No. 21
Oregon and No. 26 Washington. The women's course is
6,000 meters.
The top two men's and women's teams from West
Regionals automatically qualify for the NCAA Nation
al Championship meet on Nov. 21. In addition to the top
two teams from each region, 13 at-large teams and two
at-large individuals will also be selected to compete at
the national championship race.
"Those teams that have been ranked in the top 30 na
tionwide would be teams that have a great chance to
participate at NCAA Nationals," head coach Peter
Tegen said.
Much work has gone into altering the course this year
because of the short rest time between Regionals and
Nationals.
"The course has been changed some," Tegen said.
"We had to eliminate some really tough spots, so that not
everyone is beaten up when they finally get to the Na
tional Championships."
Because the men run 10,000 meters — approximate
ly 6.2 miles — a back-to-back racing situation is more
taxing for them than for the women, who run approxi
mately 3.7 miles. Tegen plans to announce the 14 men
and women running on the morning of the race. The
seven men and seven women will be chosen from the
group that raced at the Pac-lOs two weeks ago.
At Regionals last year, sophomore Teresa McWalters
finished fifth, while junior Katy Trotter was seventh.The
Cardinal's own Alicia Craig, a 2005 graduate, won the
title for the third straight year.

On the men's side, sophomore Neftalem Araia was
third, while junior Jonathan Pierce was 10th. Another
2005 graduate. Ryan Hall, was the men's West Region
champion last year.
The meet kicks off with the men's competition. ITie
women's race begins at 12:15 p.m. Both courses begin and
end on Electioneer Road, near the stables and the Stan

ford Barn, north of the Stanford Golf Course.The meet is
only the second home meet for the Cardinal this season.
"I think it always helps to have the meet at home in a
way, because if nothing else, you don't have to travel,"
Tegen said. "That is a very welcome change.There is also
a great value in having it at home as far as spectator and
fan support."
