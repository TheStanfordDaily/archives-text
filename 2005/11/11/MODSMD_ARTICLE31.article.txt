## Crew heads to Seattle for HOTL event 
### EMILY CRAMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's and women's crew teams finish their
fail season in style this weekend, as they are set to
compete at the picturesque Head of The Lake Regat
ta (HOTL) in Seattle, Wash.
The men's team plans to send a varsity and J V boat
to the regatta. The same handful of collegiate pro
grams should be serious competition for both boats.
HOTL will feature fast crews, many of which Stan
ford has yet to face this season. Hometown crew
Washington poses a challenge for both squads â€” the
men's team came in fourth last year at the Intercolle
giate Rowing Association Championships (IRA),

and the Husky women's
team was invited to the
NCAA Championships
where it placed just below
Stanford at 12th. For the
men, the other yet-to-be
seen regional crew to beat
will be Oregon State,
which placed ninth at the
IRA in 2005.
Outside the region,
strong teams from Canada
are also scheduled to par
ticipate in this weekend's
race. British Columbia and
Victoria provide addition
al strength in an already
fast field.

"We have spent a lot of time in practice focusing
on the things we noted we needed to work on after
Head of the American, and we have made significant
improvements in both boats in the last couple of
weeks ," said senior four-seat Justin Brown.
Though California will be missing from the regat
ta, HOTL certainly gives the men's varsity a chance to
test its adjustments and demonstrate its competitive
ness in the face of fast crews.
For this race, the varsity eight returns with a vastly
different seat lineup. Many of the rowers in the boat at
Head of the American (HOA) are now in the JV boat.
Junior Jake Cornelius is set at stroke and senior Adam
Kreek at seven-seat. They combine to lead with exten
sive national and international competition experience.
The J V eight also have the advantage of race expe
rience; most of the rowers from the varsity boat at
HOA will row together again in the JV boat.
Similar to the men, the women also face a fast line
up at HOTL. Although none of their Cal rivals will be
in attendance, Washington and Yale are scheduled to
race, and both are fast crews.
"This is our last chance to see the competition be
fore the spring racing season, so we're really looking
for a good performance," senior stroke Sam Magee
said. "It's going to be tough."
The Stanford women finished second behind
Washington last year. However, Yale looks to add an
other challenge to the regatta. They finished sixth at
NCAA's last year, significantly better than both the
Huskies and Stanford.
