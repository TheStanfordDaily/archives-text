# Stanford prepares for Match Play
## Mens golf readies for a unique match play format this weekend in Florida 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A unique format of play awaits the Cardinal in
Howie-in-the-Hills, Fla., as the men's golf team looks
forward to a strong first round today at the Collegiate
Match Play Championship. The Cardinal face last year's

tournament champion,
No. 2 Oklahoma State, in
the first round of compe
tition on the El Campeon
course of the Mission Inn
Resort.
The tournament will be
played with match play, a
format that first became
popular in the Unites
States. In it, teams com
pete directly with one an
other, traveling the course
together and pitting op
posing players at each
hole. Score is not deter
mined by total stroke
count but instead by which
golfer wins each individ
ual hole. The player with
the most holes won takes
the victory for his team.
"It's an exciting for
mat," head coach Conrad
Ray said."We see it rarely

in college golf, except this
week and later in the Ryder Cup. It's a great format to
play; it hearkens back to yesteryear."
Other than the change in scoring, a change in attitude
is necessary for the squad to play well.
"In this case, you're not playing against the course —
you're playing against a person," said sophomore Rob
Grube.'it's a lot more adversarial, so it's also more of a
mental challenge."
Strategy can also be affected in such close competi
tion.
"If you're getting beat, and you're far down,you might
get a bit more aggressive, whereas in the short game you
would just stick to your game plan," Grube said.
The Cardinal will likely have to be aggressive if they
are to win today's first round against the Cowboys. Di
rect competition with such a prestigious team can be in
timidating, but the men are ready for the challenge.
"I'm excited to feel like a giant-slayer," Grube said.
"I don't think we're expected to win, which means that
[Oklahoma State is] going to have to prove itself. We're
going to fight for it, and we have a chance."
Under the match play format, as Ray described, any
one can win. Without having to focus on total strokes, ei
ther team can pull through. And, if nothing else, the
competition gives the squad first-hand experience with
a top-ranked team.
"We work hard every day to be able to test ourselves
against the best, and that's why we're here," Ray said.
"To get a chance against Oklahoma State is pretty neat,
so we're looking forward to it."
Whether the team advances beyond the first round is
up for question, but the team remains confident.
"We'll just wait to see what happens," Ray said. "You
never know, and that's the beauty of golf. But we would
n't be here if we didn't think we had a chance to win."
