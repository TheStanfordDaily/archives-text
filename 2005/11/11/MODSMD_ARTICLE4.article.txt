If nothing else, the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team has proven itself
adaptable in the face of adversity. Only a
week after two starters were lost and forced
to undergo surgery, the Cardinal looked
none the worse for wear in a quick three
game victory over Arizona State last night.
"When you change this much,there are
times on the court when it just feels differ

terms of handling the situation we are in, I
am really proud of them. We're working
hard and getting better each day. To have
someone step in to do what [senior setter]
Katie [Goldhahn] is doing is pretty neat."
Goldhahn. who took over for injured
sophomore Bryn Kehoe nine days ago, ran
the offense ably as the Cardinal (22-4,11-
3 Pacific 10 Conference) dominated the
Arizona State (7-16, 2-11) in straight
games by scores of 30-25,30-21, and 30-24.

able out there and I think the hitters are as
well. The team has really helped me come
