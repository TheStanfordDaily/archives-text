# No.4 Stanford takes care of Arizona State in three
## Cardinal face a tough Arizona team tonight in Maples Pavilion 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If nothing else, the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team has proven itself
adaptable in the face of adversity. Only a
week after two starters were lost and forced
to undergo surgery, the Cardinal looked
none the worse for wear in a quick three
game victory over Arizona State last night.
"When you change this much,there are
times on the court when it just feels differ
ent," head coach John Dunning said. "In
terms of handling the situation we are in, I
am really proud of them. We're working
hard and getting better each day. To have
someone step in to do what [senior setter]
Katie [Goldhahn] is doing is pretty neat."
Goldhahn. who took over for injured
sophomore Bryn Kehoe nine days ago, ran
the offense ably as the Cardinal (22-4,11-
3 Pacific 10 Conference) dominated the
Arizona State (7-16, 2-11) in straight
games by scores of 30-25,30-21, and 30-24.

three-game match. She also led the
way for the Cardinal in the back row,
tallying a match-high 23 digs.
"As a setter, I just need to recog
nize [that she is hitting well] and feed
her the ball as much as I can," Gold
hahn said. "I have to think of where
the block is going to be, who is hitting,
what set each person is hitting, but all
of that is overridden by who's hot."
Freshman middle blocker Foluke
Akinradewo chipped in 11 kills while
hitting .364 against the Sun Devils
and recorded a team-high four
blocks, including one solo. Sopho
more Franci Girard. who converted
from middle blocker to outside hitter
when freshman Cynthia Barboza
tore her ACL several weeks ago, had
one of her best hitting games, finish
ing with nine kills and a match-high
.412 hitting percentage.
Senior libero Courtney Schultz
played a solid defensive game with
11 digs on the night. She now has
1.029 in her career, only 18 away
from cracking the Stanford top 10.
After the first game started even,
the Cardinal began to break away
after gaining some momentum from
a rally in which they repelled five at
tacks by the Sun Devils before a
block by junior middle blocker
Lizzie Suiter finally hit the ground.
The Cardinal built a seven-point lead
before Arizona State sub Tierra
Burnley sparked a Sun Devil run that
closed the gap to three at 23-20. Ak
inradewo and junior right side Nji
Nnamani combined for two straight
blocks to finish the game 30-25.
The Cardinal started the second
game on a tear, reeling off seven
straight points. The Stanford offense
powered to a 15-4 lead at the
halfway mark by kills from Richards
and Nnamani. The Cardinal did not
let up as the game wore on, as
Richards put a smart tip over a triple

block attempt to cap a long rally and
end the game at 30-21.
Arizona State stayed closer to the
Cardinal in the third-game but ceded
a six-point lead halfway through.The
Sun Devils built some momentum
but a powerful swing from Richards
stopped the run. The Cardinal
wrapped up the game 30-24 on a
smash by Akinradewo who found the
sideline wide open.
Stanford finished the match hit
ting .267 as a team, slightly down
from the season average.
"We're going back and forth with
a few things," Dunning said. "Last
weekend we were pretty darn good
offensively...and struggled a little de
fensively, and tonight we flip
flopped. We did a nice job against
them and made them make errors.
Offensively, we struggled a bit and
picked it up in the last game."
The Cardinal face their next chal
lenge in No. 6 Arizona (17-5, 9-4)
tonight at Maples Pavilion.The Wild
cats took a hard-fought five-game
victory over the Cardinal in TUcson
on Oct. 13. At stake in tonight's
match is a second place in the Pac-10
behind still undefeated Washington.
Arizona hurt its chances slightly with
a four-game loss to California last
night but is still in the hunt.
"Part of the deal with playing a
team as good as Arizona is that you
get more excited [than against
ASU]," Dunning said. "You play as
hard as you can every day, but there
are the Washingtons and the Ne
braskas, and Arizona is right up
there now. They're hot. It's the best
year yet for their group of three real
ly good seniors."
In an effort to get a large crowd
into Maples, tonight has been desig
nated Dorm Night, with free admis
sion for Stanford students and prizes
for the biggest and most spirited
groups.
"Tomorrow night, we are looking
forward to a little revenge here"
Goldhahn said. "They are a great
team, and we are going to step up
and play hard."
If nothing else, the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team has proven itself
adaptable in the face of adversity. Only a
week after two starters were lost and forced
to undergo surgery, the Cardinal looked
none the worse for wear in a quick three
game victory over Arizona State last night.
"When you change this much,there are
times on the court when it just feels differ
ent," head coach John Dunning said. "In
terms of handling the situation we are in, I
am really proud of them. We're working
hard and getting better each day. To have
someone step in to do what [senior setter]
Katie [Goldhahn] is doing is pretty neat."
Goldhahn. who took over for injured
sophomore Bryn Kehoe nine days ago, ran
the offense ably as the Cardinal (22-4,11-
3 Pacific 10 Conference) dominated the
Arizona State (7-16, 2-11) in straight
games by scores of 30-25,30-21, and 30-24.
