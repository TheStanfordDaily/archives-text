## Al-Qaida blamed Local reaction harsh against Jordan bombers 
### JAMAL HALABY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
AMMAN, Jordan — Hundreds of angry Jordanians
rallied Thursday outside one of three U.S.-based hotels
attacked by suicide bombers, shouting, "Burn in hell.
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi!" after the terrorist's group
claimed responsibility for the blasts that killed at least 56
people.
In an Internet statement, al-Qaida in Iraq linked the
blasts at the Grand Hyatt, the Radisson SAS and the
Days Inn hotels to the war in Iraq and called Amman the
"backyard garden" for U.S. operations.
Police continued a broad security lockdown and au
thorities sent DNA samples for testing to identify the at
tackers. Land borders were reopened after being closed
for nearly 12 hours.
The Amman protest was organized by Jordan's 14
professional and trade unions — made up of both hard
line Islamic groups and leftist political organizations —
traditionally a vocal critic of King Abdullah ll's moder
ate and pro-Western policies.
Protesters — including women and children — gath
ered outside a bombed hotels, shouting, "Death to al-
Zarqawi, the villain and the traitor!" Drivers honked the
horns of vehicles decorated with Jordanian flags and
posters of the king. A helicopter hovered overhead.
"We sacrifice our lives for you, Amman!" the protest
ers chanted.
State television said a second rally was planned in the
Red Sea port of Aqaba, where attackers using Katyusha
rockets narrowly missed a US. ship and killed a Jordan
ian soldier in August.
The streets of the capital appeared deserted early
Thursday, which was declared a day of mourning. Public
and private offices were closed under government in
structions, apparently to allow tightened security meas
ures to take hold.
Government spokesman Bassel Tarawneh said 56
people were killed in the suicide attacks, but he said that
number likely would rise.The victims included 15 Jorda

nians, five Iraqis, one Saudi, one Palestinian, three Chi
nese, one Indonesian; 30 others had not been identified.
The nearly simultaneous attacks also wounded more
than 115 people, police said. They detained several peo
ple overnight, although it was unclear if they were sus
pects or witnesses.
The al-Qaida claim said Jordan became a target be
cause it was "a backyard garden for the enemies of the
religion, Jews and crusaders... a filthy place for the trai
tors ... and a center for prostitution."The authenticity of
the posting could not be independently verified, but it
appeared on an Islamic Web site that is a clearing house
for statements by militant groups.
The claim, signed in the name of the terrorist group's
spokesman, said the attacks put the United States on no
tice that the "backyard camp for the crusader army is
now in the range of fire of the holy warriors."
The hotels, frequented by Israelis and Americans
among other foreign guests, have long been on al-
Qaida 's hit list.
Iraqi government spokesman Laith Kubba said the
attack should alert Jordan that it needed to stop hosting

former members of Saddam Hussein's regime.
"I hope that these attacks will wake up the 'Jordan
ian street' to end their sympathy with Saddam's rem
nants ... who exploit the freedom in this country to have
a safe shelter to plot their criminal acts against Iraqis."
He also said Iraqis may have had a hand in the at
tacks.
"The al-Qaida organization has become as a plague
that affected Iraq and is now transmitted by the same
rats to other countries. A lot of Iraqis, especially former
intelligence and army officers, joined this criminal cell,"
Kubba said.
Deputy Prime Minister Marwan Muasher said short
ly after the blasts that al-Zarqawi was a "prime suspect."
The Jordanian-born al-Zarqawi is known for his ani
mosity to the country's Hashemite monarchy.The claim
of responsibility did not name King Abdullah II but
twice referred to the "tyrant of Jordan."
In the attacks, the suicide bombers detonated explo
sives at the three hotels just before 9 p.m. One explosion
occurred inside a hall where 300 guests were celebrating
a wedding.
