# Yahoo doesn't want AOL stake
## Microsoft and Google still in talks with Time Warner 
### ANICK JESDANUN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK — Yahoo Inc. has pulled out of dis
cussions over buying a stake in America Online Inc.,
leaving Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. as the leading
potential suitors.
The decision to abandon the talks came after
Yahoo chief executive Terry Semel and chief finance
officer Susan Decker met in late October with Time
Warner executives in New York, said Yahoo spokes
woman Joanna Stevens.
Stevens said Yahoo had "politely passed" on pro
posed terms and "walked away from any interest in a
deal."
TWo people close to the discussions said a key
stumbling block was Time Warner Inc.'s insistence
that it retain majority ownership in the AOL unit.
They spoke on condition of anonymity because public
discussions of any private negotiations were contrary
to their companies' policies.
One of the people, familiar with Time Warner's po
sition, said one arrangement under discussion had
called for Yahoo to pay Time Warner in stock worth
$13 billion for an 80 percent of AOL's content busi
ness, which is growing.
Under that proposal, the person said, Time Warner
would keep ail of AOL's Internet access business,
which is in decline as users abandon dial-up connec
tions for higher-speed cable and DSL lines.
The Yahoo withdrawal was reported earlier on the
Web site of The Wall Street Journal.
The interest in AOL comes as the company trans
forms itself from a declining business focused on pro
viding dial-up access to a provider of free content that
is tapping the recent boom in online advertising.
Late last year, AOL abandoned its longtime strate
gy of exclusivity and began making its rich offerings
— including concerts, news, sports and e-mail —
available through AOL.coni for free, a model Yahoo
drove to become the Web's top brand.
