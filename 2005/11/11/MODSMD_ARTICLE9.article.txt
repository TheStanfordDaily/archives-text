### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
A three-star general spoke with Air Force Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets yesterday about the
keys to a successful career in the military. Lieutenant Gen
eral Bruce A. Wright, commander of U.S. military forces in
Japan, spoke with approximately 70 cadets in battle dress
uniform (BDU) from Stanford and area schools as part of
a two-day visit to campus.
Wright, who graduated from the Air Force Academy in
1973, commended cadets for signing up to serve their coun
try and said that fears he had about the future of the repub
lic were assuaged whenever he met with young military
leaders.
"This nation is at war," he said. "In the history of the
U.S., we may have never been at more risk as a nation than
we are today. Certainly some of the risk is from AI Oaeda.
Some of it, thoughts from within the United States. It does
not take long watching MTV to become concerned about
the values of our nation. Seeing you all reassures me that
we are going to be okay.
"Together we will take on the external threats and con
tinue to make sure the United States has the strongest mil
itary and remains the most benevolent nation in the
world," he continued.
Wright cautioned cadets not to be overly worried by
pessimistic news media reports from Iraq. Pointing out that
50 million Iraqis and Afghanis are free because of Ameri
can intervention, the general estimated that the number of
insurgents in those countries is probably less than 20,000.
"As horrible as the loss of life is, we are taking this bat
tle to the enemy," he said. "We are going to fight the fight,
and we will prevail."
To the backdrop of a three-slide PowerPoint presenta
tion titled "What I Believe." Wright focused on eight key
concepts he wanted to impress upon cadets preparing for a
career in military service.
Calling character the most important value an Air
Force officer must strive to uphold, the F-16 pilot encour
aged airmen to prepare physically, mentally and spiritually
to ensure they are combat ready.
Telling the college-aged cadets to "put your family
first," Wright called good quality of life essential for good
morale.
"You will not find a better group to raise your children
with than the people you will find in the Air Force," he said.
"Nowhere else on campus exists a group like the one in this
room. I know I can walk into this room and trust you un
equivocally with the money in my pockets...and with my
life."
The general also told cadets to be bold.courageous,self
less and willing to take on difficult problems.
"I'll tell you what I tell my daughters,"he said, noting
that one of them was a lieutenant in the Air Force. "Take
advantage of the opportunity to be young and improve
yourself."
After finishing his talk. Wright took the audience's
questions, ranging from family life issues to spirituality in
the military to American strategic readiness in Asia.
The general spoke about strategic and tactical chal
lenges facing the region. Saying American and Japanese
forces are becoming more interoperable. Wright dismissed
criticisms of Japan as increasingly militaristic.
"Japan is a very free, democratic society with civilian
control of the military," he said. "Douglas McArthur had it
right. He wasn't looking back in 1945; he was looking for
ward to preserving in peace what we won in war.
"Military to military engagement will keep a lid on hos
tilities in the region," he added, referring to cooperative ef
forts among China, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. to plan
for a North Korea attack on its southern neighbor. The
Commander of the Fifth Air Force
predicted that North and South
Korea will eventually reunify.
The seeds for the Stanford visit
were first planted this August in
Australia when Wright met with re
tired Army Colonel Dan Young,
also the former director of service
operations for the University. Both
men were in Australia to celebrate
the ftOth anniversary of the end of
World War 11. Wright expressed in
terest in visiting Stanford and meet
ing with cadets.
Young, who introduced Wright
last night, told cadets about his own
experience being wounded during
World War Two. Commissioned as
an officer at 18 and sent to fight the
Japanese in Papua New Guinea, he

nearly died leading his platoon he
hind enemy lines to attack the rear
perimeter of the enemy. He lost
more than 60 pounds and went
without food for six days, but his
team was successful at dislodging
Japanese forces. After retiring from
the Army, he spent two decades at
Stanford.
Cadets were excited by the rare
opportunity to meet a senior military
officer. Some attending the event re
cently took the oath of allegiance and
committed to serve at least four years
in the Air Force.
Due to a Vietnam-era policy,
ROTC programs are prohibited at
Stanford. University students must
travel approximately one hour to San
Jose State University to participate.
There are approximately 10 Air Force
ROTC cadets on campus.
Stanford senior John Hamilton is
one of these cadets. The Cadet Wing
Commander of ROTC Detachment
45, Hamilton will be commissioned a

Second Lieutenant after graduating
in June. Poised for active duty, Hamil
ton listened intently to the general's
remarks.
"It is important for cadets who are
in college right now to see a senior
military officer and to take lessons
from his successful career," Hamilton
said. "General Wright offered out
standing advice and experience that
will enhance the future careers of all
the cadets."
The commander of Detachment
45, Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Hellen,
said he was delighted that Wright
asked to speak with the cadets and
felt that his message resonated
strongly.
"The Air Force has very few gen
erals," Hellen said after the speech.
"The perspective of listening to a sen
ior leader of the military is invaluable.
Cadets gained a big picture perspec
tive into Asian regional politics and
the Air Force tonight that you can't
read in a book or see in a movie."

first," Wright called good quality of life essential for good
morale.
"You will not find a better group to raise your children
with than the people you will find in the Air Force," he said.
"Nowhere else on campus exists a group like the one in this
room. I know I can walk into this room and trust you un
equivocally with the money in my pockets...and with my
life."
The general also told cadets to be bold.courageous,self
less and willing to take on difficult problems.
"I'll tell you what I tell my daughters,"he said, noting
that one of them was a lieutenant in the Air Force. "Take
advantage of the opportunity to be young and improve
yourself."
After finishing his talk. Wright took the audience's
questions, ranging from family life issues to spirituality in
the military to American strategic readiness in Asia.
The general spoke about strategic and tactical chal
lenges facing the region. Saying American and Japanese
forces are becoming more interoperable. Wright dismissed
criticisms of Japan as increasingly militaristic.
"Japan is a very free, democratic society with civilian
control of the military," he said. "Douglas McArthur had it
right. He wasn't looking back in 1945; he was looking for
ward to preserving in peace what we won in war.
"Military to military engagement will keep a lid on hos
tilities in the region," he added, referring to cooperative ef
forts among China, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. to plan
for a North Korea attack on its southern neighbor. The
Commander of the Fifth Air Force
predicted that North and South
Korea will eventually reunify.
The seeds for the Stanford visit
were first planted this August in
Australia when Wright met with re
tired Army Colonel Dan Young,
also the former director of service
operations for the University. Both
men were in Australia to celebrate
the ftOth anniversary of the end of
World War 11. Wright expressed in
terest in visiting Stanford and meet
ing with cadets.
Young, who introduced Wright
last night, told cadets about his own
experience being wounded during
World War Two. Commissioned as
an officer at 18 and sent to fight the
Japanese in Papua New Guinea, he

nearly died leading his platoon he
hind enemy lines to attack the rear
perimeter of the enemy. He lost
more than 60 pounds and went
without food for six days, but his
team was successful at dislodging
Japanese forces. After retiring from
the Army, he spent two decades at
Stanford.
Cadets were excited by the rare
opportunity to meet a senior military
officer. Some attending the event re
cently took the oath of allegiance and
committed to serve at least four years
in the Air Force.
Due to a Vietnam-era policy,
ROTC programs are prohibited at
Stanford. University students must
travel approximately one hour to San
Jose State University to participate.
There are approximately 10 Air Force
ROTC cadets on campus.
Stanford senior John Hamilton is
one of these cadets. The Cadet Wing
Commander of ROTC Detachment
45, Hamilton will be commissioned a

Second Lieutenant after graduating
in June. Poised for active duty, Hamil
ton listened intently to the general's
remarks.
"It is important for cadets who are
in college right now to see a senior
military officer and to take lessons
from his successful career," Hamilton
said. "General Wright offered out
standing advice and experience that
will enhance the future careers of all
the cadets."
The commander of Detachment
45, Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Hellen,
said he was delighted that Wright
asked to speak with the cadets and
felt that his message resonated
strongly.
"The Air Force has very few gen
erals," Hellen said after the speech.
"The perspective of listening to a sen
ior leader of the military is invaluable.
Cadets gained a big picture perspec
tive into Asian regional politics and
the Air Force tonight that you can't
read in a book or see in a movie."
A three-star general spoke with Air Force Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets yesterday about the
keys to a successful career in the military. Lieutenant Gen
eral Bruce A. Wright, commander of U.S. military forces in
Japan, spoke with approximately 70 cadets in battle dress
uniform (BDU) from Stanford and area schools as part of
a two-day visit to campus.
Wright, who graduated from the Air Force Academy in
1973, commended cadets for signing up to serve their coun
try and said that fears he had about the future of the repub
lic were assuaged whenever he met with young military
leaders.
"This nation is at war," he said. "In the history of the
U.S., we may have never been at more risk as a nation than
we are today. Certainly some of the risk is from AI Oaeda.
Some of it, thoughts from within the United States. It does
not take long watching MTV to become concerned about
the values of our nation. Seeing you all reassures me that
we are going to be okay.
"Together we will take on the external threats and con
tinue to make sure the United States has the strongest mil
itary and remains the most benevolent nation in the
world," he continued.
Wright cautioned cadets not to be overly worried by
pessimistic news media reports from Iraq. Pointing out that
50 million Iraqis and Afghanis are free because of Ameri
can intervention, the general estimated that the number of
insurgents in those countries is probably less than 20,000.
"As horrible as the loss of life is, we are taking this bat
tle to the enemy," he said. "We are going to fight the fight,
and we will prevail."
To the backdrop of a three-slide PowerPoint presenta
tion titled "What I Believe." Wright focused on eight key
concepts he wanted to impress upon cadets preparing for a
career in military service.
Calling character the most important value an Air
Force officer must strive to uphold, the F-16 pilot encour
aged airmen to prepare physically, mentally and spiritually
to ensure they are combat ready.
Telling the college-aged cadets to "put your family
first," Wright called good quality of life essential for good
morale.
"You will not find a better group to raise your children
with than the people you will find in the Air Force," he said.
