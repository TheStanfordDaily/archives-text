## Alum gives famous hip-hop artists their start on KZSU's 'The Drum,' 21 years and counting 
### MARISSA KLEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Busta Rhymes, Wu-Tang Clan and the Fugees
are not names one usually associates with KZSU,
Stanford's long-time, non-commercial radio station.
Yet these are only a few of the artists who have
played on KZSU's The Drum, the world's longest
running hip-hop show, according to DJ Kevvy Kev,
who graduated from Stanford in the 1980s. He has
been the man behind it all for the past 21 years, play
ing the hottest in underground hip-hop every Sun
day night from 6 to 9 p.m.
New York City native Kev and six of his friends
— the "Members Only Crew" — began the show as
undergraduates in 1984, bringing the burgeoning
sounds of hip-hop to the West Coast.
"Hip-hop wasn't the global force it is now," Kev
says."l brought back the way we were dressing and the
way we were talking. 1 missed it all, 1 missed those cats
There were a few guys here like me. We formed a nice
little crew. It was just an incredible time for hip-hop in
general. It was just starting to explode globally."
The Drum already existed when Kev arrived at
KZSU, but in a different form.
"It was mandated that Sunday nights had to be a
black music' show," Kev explains. "KSOL, [a com
mercial radio station], was the only big station, and
Sunday nights they weren't playing music —so
everyone in the Bay Area used to listen to KZSU on
Sunday nights. So I just fell into it."
With Kev and his crew spinning the freshest fla
vors of New York hip-hop every Sunday night, The
Drum began to build a reputation among the hip
hop community close to campus, and being featured
on the show became a necessary rite of passage for
many artists.
Kev recounts highlights like a legendary set by the
Wu-Tang Clan, a freestyling session by Busta Rhymes
and shows by the Fugees, Whodini and X-Clan. Kev
says he spotted many of the artists who played at The
Drum before they hit it big in the mainstream.
"I don't think it's that special to be able to spot
people who are talented," he says. "But it is unusual
to be in the position to make it happen. There's a be
wildering array of good music out there."
He continues, "Eminem came to the station back
when he was working out of Detroit. I just invoked
Eminem and he's one of the most commercial artists
out there, but he's ridiculously talented. Same with
Busta Rhymes. So he's hot and making money, but
good for him — he's talented. I won't play their
records because I don't need to do them anymore. I
can play Blackalicious or J-live."
Kev recently celebrated the 21st anniversary of
The Drum, and soon he will be entered in the Guin
ness Book of World Records as the host of the hip
hop radio program that has run the most consecutive
weeks without going off the air. Yet Kev, who gradu
ated with a degree in chemistry, emphasizes that his
radio career is a direction that he never could have
foreseen his life taking.
"I [worked in chemistry] for a year and said, 'Oh
hell no.' So I came back [to Stanford], knocked out
the English degree and started doing tech writing.
But now I'm a full-time entertainer, I guess you'd say.
When people ask what I do, I say I'm a Jedi knight."
Although he has DJ'd at other commercial radio
stations over the years, he says he loves the artistic
freedom he has at KZSU.
"You have to be prepared, in commercial radio,to
be a small cog in a very big wheel," he remarks. "They
tell you what to play and how."
Given Kev's acclaim in the hip-hop scene and his
longevity at Stanford, it seems odd that he flies well
below the radar of most Stanford students — many
say they have not heard of The Drum
But Kev does not seem phased by this local lack
of recognition.
"I love KZSU and I love Stanford," he says. "At
Stanford, you're always surrounded by special people.
The music industry is not one that rewards intelli
gence and Stanford is,so it's like a welcome respite —
a welcome balance to have,given the industry I'm in."
Kev says the show has become a part of who he is.
"I met this guy in San Francisco recently who I went
to school with," Kev recounts, reflecting on his years in
the industry. "He has wire-rimmed glasses and thin
ning hair, and he looks like a grown-up. And I'm not. I
don't know, I guess it's a part of what I do. Like I
stepped into a time warp, a whole other generation."
It's no surprise that Kev says there's no end in
sight, given how much he loves what he does.
"Make sure you're doing something you really
want to do, or you'll be sitting there, looking out the
window," Kev advises. "I've been lucky — I've seen
a lot of the world."

With Kev and his crew spinning the freshest fla
vors of New York hip-hop every Sunday night, The
Drum began to build a reputation among the hip
hop community close to campus, and being featured
on the show became a necessary rite of passage for
many artists.
Kev recounts highlights like a legendary set by the
Wu-Tang Clan, a freestyling session by Busta Rhymes
and shows by the Fugees, Whodini and X-Clan. Kev
says he spotted many of the artists who played at The
Drum before they hit it big in the mainstream.
"I don't think it's that special to be able to spot
people who are talented," he says. "But it is unusual
to be in the position to make it happen. There's a be
wildering array of good music out there."
He continues, "Eminem came to the station back
when he was working out of Detroit. I just invoked
Eminem and he's one of the most commercial artists
out there, but he's ridiculously talented. Same with
Busta Rhymes. So he's hot and making money, but
good for him — he's talented. I won't play their
records because I don't need to do them anymore. I
can play Blackalicious or J-live."
Kev recently celebrated the 21st anniversary of
The Drum, and soon he will be entered in the Guin
ness Book of World Records as the host of the hip
hop radio program that has run the most consecutive
weeks without going off the air. Yet Kev, who gradu
ated with a degree in chemistry, emphasizes that his
radio career is a direction that he never could have
foreseen his life taking.
"I [worked in chemistry] for a year and said, 'Oh
hell no.' So I came back [to Stanford], knocked out
the English degree and started doing tech writing.
But now I'm a full-time entertainer, I guess you'd say.
When people ask what I do, I say I'm a Jedi knight."
Although he has DJ'd at other commercial radio
stations over the years, he says he loves the artistic
freedom he has at KZSU.
"You have to be prepared, in commercial radio,to
be a small cog in a very big wheel," he remarks. "They
tell you what to play and how."
Given Kev's acclaim in the hip-hop scene and his
longevity at Stanford, it seems odd that he flies well
below the radar of most Stanford students — many
say they have not heard of The Drum
But Kev does not seem phased by this local lack
of recognition.
"I love KZSU and I love Stanford," he says. "At
Stanford, you're always surrounded by special people.
The music industry is not one that rewards intelli
gence and Stanford is,so it's like a welcome respite —
a welcome balance to have,given the industry I'm in."
Kev says the show has become a part of who he is.
"I met this guy in San Francisco recently who I went
to school with," Kev recounts, reflecting on his years in
the industry. "He has wire-rimmed glasses and thin
ning hair, and he looks like a grown-up. And I'm not. I
don't know, I guess it's a part of what I do. Like I
stepped into a time warp, a whole other generation."
It's no surprise that Kev says there's no end in
sight, given how much he loves what he does.
"Make sure you're doing something you really
want to do, or you'll be sitting there, looking out the
window," Kev advises. "I've been lucky — I've seen
a lot of the world."

Busta Rhymes, Wu-Tang Clan and the Fugees
are not names one usually associates with KZSU,
Stanford's long-time, non-commercial radio station.
Yet these are only a few of the artists who have
played on KZSU's The Drum, the world's longest
running hip-hop show, according to DJ Kevvy Kev,
who graduated from Stanford in the 1980s. He has
been the man behind it all for the past 21 years, play
ing the hottest in underground hip-hop every Sun
day night from 6 to 9 p.m.
New York City native Kev and six of his friends
— the "Members Only Crew" — began the show as
undergraduates in 1984, bringing the burgeoning
sounds of hip-hop to the West Coast.
"Hip-hop wasn't the global force it is now," Kev
says."l brought back the way we were dressing and the
way we were talking. 1 missed it all, 1 missed those cats
There were a few guys here like me. We formed a nice
little crew. It was just an incredible time for hip-hop in
general. It was just starting to explode globally."
The Drum already existed when Kev arrived at
KZSU, but in a different form.
"It was mandated that Sunday nights had to be a
black music' show," Kev explains. "KSOL, [a com
mercial radio station], was the only big station, and
Sunday nights they weren't playing music —so
everyone in the Bay Area used to listen to KZSU on
Sunday nights. So I just fell into it."
