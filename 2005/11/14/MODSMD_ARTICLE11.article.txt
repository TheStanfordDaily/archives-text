### CLAY BAVINGER 
If you have ever been to Wilbur Dining,
you probably remember the grill chef Max
Cardenas enthusiastically exclaiming. "Hey,
baby."
Max's greeting, along with the grilled fare
he serves up and his remarkable ability to re
member names, has become pretty well
known among students.
Max has worked for Stanford Dining since
September 1980 and has been the grill chef at
Wilbur for the last few years. He says he's
stayed so long because, quite simply, he loves
it here. The people at Stanford are all "happy
and lucky — beautiful people," Max says.
"This is my family — this is my big family."

He also claims that Wilbur is the best din
ing hall on campus.
"Everybody comes to Wilbur." he says.
The best thing served at Wilbur, according
to Max, is the Chicken Breast a la Max. He
prepares this student favorite according to a
strict recipe he developed years ago, he ex
plains. The chicken is flavored with vinegar,
garlic and black pepper. It tastes great by itself
or in a sandwich,
In fact. Stanford really has become a big
family for Max. He is a favorite among the
students.
"He's amazing," says freshman Kellen
Klein. "He always remembers just what I
want."
Students say they appreciate Max's friend

ly personality.
"He remembers my name," says freshman
Shaker Muasher. "His warmth makes Wilbur
Dining feel like mamma's kitchen all the way
back home in Jordan."
Some students like Max so much that
they've struck up close friendships with him.
"Two of my best friends were students
here," Max says. One graduated in 1992 and
moved to Spain shortly after.
"He calls on my birthday and Christmas,"
Max says. The other lives in Paraguay and
calls on holidays as well. Other old students
regularly stop by and say hello to Max.
"I get a lot of visitors during class re
unions," Max says. He claims to remember
most of their names.

Max has two daughters who live in Los An
geles. While he does not see them often, they
drive up to Stanford several weekends each
year. Max misses having his family near him
but insists that the sense of community on the
Farm keeps him company.
Max has served class after class of students
and says he has noticed one major similarity
in the students throughout his 25 years at
Stanford.
"They have always been such nice people,"
he says.
Max says he has no plans to leave Stanford
any time soon — Stanford is his home and his
family. He serves up an awesome burger
along with a friendly smile, and for that the
students love him.
