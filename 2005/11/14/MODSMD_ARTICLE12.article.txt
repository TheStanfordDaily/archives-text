## Scholar works to preserve Native American language Native American scholar Richard Grounds speaks on the importance of native languages 
### KATIE JONES 
"All the diverse ways of understanding and
living in the world are at risk," said visiting
Native American scholar Richard Grounds
about the importance and cultural value of
native languages at a luncheon last Wednes
day. Of Euchee and Seminole descent.
Grounds argued that native languages must
be preserved because they are crucial mark
ers of Native identity and history.
Grounds' four-day visit was a part of the
Native American Cultural Center's fall quar
ter Native American Awareness program
ming. While Grounds primarily spoke on top
ics regarding Native American languages, he
also focused on the issue of Indian mascots
and stereotypes.
Grounds, who received his Ph.D. in histo
ry of religions from Princeton Theological
Seminary, spearheaded and now directs a
tireless campaign to restore and preserve the
Euchee language.The Euchee Language Pro
ject enrolls 16-month to two-year-old Euchee
children in classes with fluent elders in an ef
fort to make Euchee one of the children's first
languages.
Grounds said that due to his commitment
to Euchee language reclamation, he left his
post in the Department of Anthropology at
Hilsa University several years ago to dedicate
his full time and attention to the cause. He
even removed his children from public school
to homeschool them in Euchee. For Grounds,
Euchee language restoration is essential to
keep his tribe contemporary. " We 're
Euchee people, and we're still here," he said.
His Wednesday talk, "The Importance and
Cultural Value of Native Languages," laid out
an argument for why Native American lan
guage preservation is imperative. Grounds
said that typical answers from linguistic liter
ature often center on keeping "a record of
human intellectual possibilities." However,
Grounds contends that language preserva
tion is an issue of identity.
"Language is central to who we are," he
said. "Our identity is tied into our language in
very deep ways."
Grounds explained that in indigenous lan
guages "ancient worldviews are at stake." Na
tive American ceremony, stories and songs all
depend on the use of language. Codes of be
havior are implicit in language as well. In the
Euchee community specifically, and in many
other Native American tribes, elders teach
that language is a gift from the creator, and
language, in turn, instructs the Euchee how to
live. While language is not the "total pack
age," or the sole bearer of Native American
traditions and cultural information, language
is still the most critical key in "carrying for
ward an enormous storehouse of accrued
knowledge."
"Our sense of alterity is carried even in the
grammar of our languages," Grounds said.
Those speaking the Euchee language artic
ulate things and situations in relation to na
ture. The word "chair" is not one word, but
rather "that which sits on the earth." Animals
are also not referred to as a separate category
from human beings. Instead, they are identi
fied as non-Euchees, as would any human

being who is not a part of the tribe. According
to Grounds, these grammatical devices reveal
a unique appreciation and relationship to the
environment — a worldview that is similarly
encoded in other Native American languages.
"It is the only way to talk," Grounds re
marked.
Grounds also highlighted the unwritten
history conveyed in Native American lan
guages through oral tradition. In particular,
he recounted recently attending an Interna
tional Indian Tteaty Counsel in Oklahoma.
Those present at the meeting drove home the
point that there are elders in Native Ameri
can communities today who know "what the
agreements were and what was said at the
treaty negotiations, regardless of what ended
up being written in the notes or in the final
treaty agreement."
According to Grounds, without the en
durance of language, this knowledge would
cease to exist.
"Oral history of those exchanges is still
alive," he said. "But what I was struck with is
that they are only there because there are
people who speak the language."
Grounds traced the generational shift in
language fluency within his own family — a
history that echoes the experience of most
Native American communities. His grand
mother only spoke Euchee. However, after
going to a boarding school where her mother
tongue was banned and after facing firsthand
the trouble associated with speaking Euchee,
she forbade Grounds' father to speak Euchee
at home. As a result. Grounds only heard Eu
chee spoken around his grandmother or
other elders.
Winona Simms, director of the Native
American Cultural Center and an assistant
dean of students, added her own anecdote to
Grounds' story.
"People used to apologize for not speak
ing English well," she said. "Now they apolo
gize for not speaking Muskogee well."
On the current status of native languages.
Grounds said that "things are getting pretty
rough." Of the indigenous languages still
alive today, over 70 percent of them are spo
ken only by the grandparent or older gener
ations. This means that children are not
learning their traditional tongues, and that
potential for keeping the language alive is
lost.
Native American language restoration
faces a myriad of challenges. Grounds cited
funding and the limited number and ages of
fluent speakers as chief impediments. He also
said that trying to "breathe life" into already
existing written documents is "immensely dif
ficult and time intensive." He added that
while young people are generally willing and
enthusiastic to learn their native languages,
time commitments from school and work
often restrict their ability to become fully im
mersed in the language.
"Native language has been under targeted
attack for generations," Grounds said. "It is
literally the last stronghold of colonial as
sault."
Simms said she hopes that Grounds will
inspire Native American Stanford students
to learn and speak their own native lan
guages.
While the discussions of Grounds' visit
primarily concentrated on topics regarding
Native American languages. Grounds also fo
cused on Indian mascots and stereotypes.
