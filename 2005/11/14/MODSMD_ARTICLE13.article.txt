# Respect is non-negotiable.
## DR. RICHARD GROUNDS 
### 
Such dialogue is particularly pertinent to
Stanford, which replaced its Indian mascot in
1972. However, this hotbed issue invariably
flares up every year during Big Game week,
with reminiscing alumni clamoring for the
mascot's reinstatement.
Stanford's former Indian mascot even
reemerged at this year's homecoming foot
ball game against Arizona State University.
Jessica Laurence, a Navajo sophomore, saw
the mascot on a T-shirt.
"It was weird," she said."l didn't know how
to react."
Grounds stressed in his Thursday dinner
talk,"lndian Mascots and Stereotypes," at the
Native American Cultural Center that any
discussion of Indian mascots must talk about
Native American genocide in the United
States.
He opened his discussion by presenting a
1939 H.T. Daniel catalogue and price list for
Indian relics. Grounds read part of a list of
"for sale" items which accompanied the
photo of a human skull.
"Mound-builders, whole skull, good con
dition, rare and hard to get, many diggers will
not take one out, $5 each. Extra nice one,
$7.50. Damaged skull, $3.50," he read.
The front page of the catalogue features a
photo of H.T. Daniel in Indian regalia, or in
what the caption refers to as "hobby attire."
Grounds said that historical writing and
popular culture frequently casts off Native
American genocide as penetrated by ex
tremists and impulsive hotheads. However,
he argued that the historical evidence and
statistics clearly show that massacres were
not "occasional slips," but a part of a system

atic "pattern of decimation and expansion."
"In every major area of expansion,
some process of direct genocide was de
ployed in order to gain control of those
lands and resources," Grounds said. "The
level of genocide typically was to kill
however many people it took to gain ac
quiescence, to get somebody to sign the
papers to say, 'It's okay, you can have our
land, our timber, our water.' "
Grounds claimed that a fundamental link
exists between this "ugly history" and current
mascot antics because "the curious thing of
playing Indian" started while the genocide
was being carried out.
"We must ground the mascot practice in
genocidal history to underscore its impropri
ety," Grounds said. "It's extraordinary how
deep the issue gets."
He gave several examples of the violent
backlash that advocates for Indian mascot re
moval have been subject to in recent years.
Many have received death threats. A father of
a Native American student in southern
Kansas who questioned the use of Indian
mascots received an e-mail threatening to kill
his horses and rape his wife.
Grounds said that he believes he has one
viable explanation that belies this.
"I think it has to do with the self-under
standing and core problem within American
society that America is the land of freedom,
the one place on earth where liberty is the
watch bird, where justice is executed," he
said. "At the same time, we have this history of
genocide. How can you have both?"
Grounds said he believes that the gener
al strategy for avoiding this contradiction is to

"turn it into a mockery."
"Take Native Americans and turn them
into cartoon figures, claim their identity so
not only have you displaced the people from
the land, but now you become the Indians,"
he said.
He argued an "American cultural religion
of nationalism celebrating the myth of con
quest," coupled with the "colonial logics of
dispossession" are issues underlying the mas
cot issue.
"Europeans wanted to belong, and what
better way to do this than to claim the identi
ty of those with the right title," he said. "Na
tive Americans are not to be respected in
their own right, but rather serve the national
agenda. It has to do with supercessionism, the
peoples of Europe come and take their place.
In fact, they're so superior, they can out-Indi
an the Indians."
Grounds offered a cookie jar analogy to
explain his position. He said that mascots
and similar imagery are not part of a "con
scious plan to cover up the history, but rather
a result of human nature attempting to ex
cuse and justify without admitting to wrong
doing.
Though many sports teams have followed
Stanford's lead in removing Indian mascots
since the 19705, about 100 U.S. colleges still
use Indian mascots or names. More than
1,000 high schools are represented by such
images. Five professional sports teams cling
to their Indian mascots: the NFL's Washing
ton Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs, the Al
tanta Braves and Cleveland Indians of Major
League Baseball, and the NBAs Golden
State Warriors.
Grounds touched on the Florida Semi
noles' current contract with Florida State
University to use the Seminole mascot. While
Grounds does not approve of the tribe's
arrangement, he said he cannot entirely fault
them.
"The tribe has other issues they're trying
to work on — economic and business ven
tures — they've got a lot going on," he said.
For Grounds, however, the issue is about
respect.
"Respect is non-negotiable," he insisted.

dition, rare and hard to get, many diggers will
not take one out, $5 each. Extra nice one,
$7.50. Damaged skull, $3.50," he read.
The front page of the catalogue features a
photo of H.T. Daniel in Indian regalia, or in
what the caption refers to as "hobby attire."
Grounds said that historical writing and
popular culture frequently casts off Native
American genocide as penetrated by ex
tremists and impulsive hotheads. However,
he argued that the historical evidence and
statistics clearly show that massacres were
not "occasional slips," but a part of a system

atic "pattern of decimation and expansion."
"In every major area of expansion,
some process of direct genocide was de
ployed in order to gain control of those
lands and resources," Grounds said. "The
level of genocide typically was to kill
however many people it took to gain ac
quiescence, to get somebody to sign the
papers to say, 'It's okay, you can have our
land, our timber, our water.' "
Grounds claimed that a fundamental link
exists between this "ugly history" and current
mascot antics because "the curious thing of
playing Indian" started while the genocide
was being carried out.
"We must ground the mascot practice in
genocidal history to underscore its impropri
ety," Grounds said. "It's extraordinary how
deep the issue gets."
He gave several examples of the violent
backlash that advocates for Indian mascot re
moval have been subject to in recent years.
Many have received death threats. A father of
a Native American student in southern
Kansas who questioned the use of Indian
mascots received an e-mail threatening to kill
his horses and rape his wife.
Grounds said that he believes he has one
viable explanation that belies this.
"I think it has to do with the self-under
standing and core problem within American
society that America is the land of freedom,
the one place on earth where liberty is the
watch bird, where justice is executed," he
said. "At the same time, we have this history of
genocide. How can you have both?"
Grounds said he believes that the gener
al strategy for avoiding this contradiction is to

"turn it into a mockery."
"Take Native Americans and turn them
into cartoon figures, claim their identity so
not only have you displaced the people from
the land, but now you become the Indians,"
he said.
He argued an "American cultural religion
of nationalism celebrating the myth of con
quest," coupled with the "colonial logics of
dispossession" are issues underlying the mas
cot issue.
"Europeans wanted to belong, and what
better way to do this than to claim the identi
ty of those with the right title," he said. "Na
tive Americans are not to be respected in
their own right, but rather serve the national
agenda. It has to do with supercessionism, the
peoples of Europe come and take their place.
In fact, they're so superior, they can out-Indi
an the Indians."
Grounds offered a cookie jar analogy to
explain his position. He said that mascots
and similar imagery are not part of a "con
scious plan to cover up the history, but rather
a result of human nature attempting to ex
cuse and justify without admitting to wrong
doing.
Though many sports teams have followed
Stanford's lead in removing Indian mascots
since the 19705, about 100 U.S. colleges still
use Indian mascots or names. More than
1,000 high schools are represented by such
images. Five professional sports teams cling
to their Indian mascots: the NFL's Washing
ton Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs, the Al
tanta Braves and Cleveland Indians of Major
League Baseball, and the NBAs Golden
State Warriors.
Grounds touched on the Florida Semi
noles' current contract with Florida State
University to use the Seminole mascot. While
Grounds does not approve of the tribe's
arrangement, he said he cannot entirely fault
them.
"The tribe has other issues they're trying
to work on — economic and business ven
tures — they've got a lot going on," he said.
For Grounds, however, the issue is about
respect.
"Respect is non-negotiable," he insisted.
Such dialogue is particularly pertinent to
Stanford, which replaced its Indian mascot in
1972. However, this hotbed issue invariably
flares up every year during Big Game week,
with reminiscing alumni clamoring for the
mascot's reinstatement.
Stanford's former Indian mascot even
reemerged at this year's homecoming foot
ball game against Arizona State University.
Jessica Laurence, a Navajo sophomore, saw
the mascot on a T-shirt.
"It was weird," she said."l didn't know how
to react."
Grounds stressed in his Thursday dinner
talk,"lndian Mascots and Stereotypes," at the
Native American Cultural Center that any
discussion of Indian mascots must talk about
Native American genocide in the United
States.
He opened his discussion by presenting a
1939 H.T. Daniel catalogue and price list for
Indian relics. Grounds read part of a list of
"for sale" items which accompanied the
photo of a human skull.
"Mound-builders, whole skull, good con
dition, rare and hard to get, many diggers will
not take one out, $5 each. Extra nice one,
