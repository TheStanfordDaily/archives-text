## Clubs forced to move from Knoll and Roble 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Outdoors and several other clubs
were recently informed that they would be forced
to move from their current storage space at the
Knoll and Roble Studios, formerly Roble Gym, by
the Office of Student Activities (OSA) last
Wednesday.
Stanford Outdoors, an umbrella organization
comprised of eight different student groups, has a
membership approaching 2,(XX) students. One of
the eight groups, the Redwood Outdoors Club,
runs equipment rentals to non-members on a reg
ular basis, especially for dorm ski trips. With the
other groups taken into consideration, the deci
sion has the potential to affect a significant frac
tion of the student body.
The OSA will purchase storage containers to
be placed in a fenced-in parking lot near Sand Hill.
All of the groups are expected to have moved their
equipment from its current location to the new
containers by Jan. 4.
Several of the groups, especially the cycling
team and the Redwood Outdoors club, are wor
ried that the new facilities will be inadequate and
would like more time to prepare.

One of the major concerns is the difficulty of
lighting the trailers since there will be no electrici
ty. The groups are also concerned about ventila
tion and shelving.
By law, the University is not supposed to have
anyone in one of the storage containers for more
than an hour, but the cycling team often needs
much more time to do repairs. The Redwood Club
rents out equipment to students at all hours of the
day and fears that if the containers are not well
lighted, organized and accessible they will have to
cease equipment rentals altogether.
There had been talk of the groups' having to
move out of the Roble basement for several years,
but nothing materialized until last Wednesday.
The decision was the result of renovations
planned for the Roble basement, to be paid for by
the Drama Department, and is the beginning of
the conversion of Roble from an athletic facility to
a center for drama.
Due to confusion and miscommunication, not
all of the student groups affected by the decision
were notified of the meeting last Wednesday.
Though the kayaking team, the cycling team and
the windsurfing club were contacted, Stanford
Outdoors President Matt Farrell simply heard of
the meeting by word of mouth. The kayaking club

has still not been officially informed of the move.
The groups were not told that the storage con
tainers would be delivered until Nov. 18, giving
them only a week and a half to prepare for the
change.
Each of the groups has different concerns. The
kayaking team said it has been hoping to move
into the Stanford Crew boathouse ever since it was
built, but is still waiting to hear back from the Ath
letic Department. In the meantime, they will have
difficulty fitting a 32-foot-long boat in a 20-foot
long trailer.
"Basically, we need to be given time to think
about what we need," said Mark Hesse, a member
of the Stanford windsurfing club.
The groups held a meeting to discuss their mu
tual concerns last night at the Geology Corner.
Most saw the move as acceptable as long as it is
temporary and they are given time to explain their
space needs to the OSA. However, the move to the
Sand Hill parking lots could last for five years or
more, and all of the group representatives fear that
new members will simply accept the situation as
the status quo.
A meeting between the affected groups and the
OSA will be held this afternoon to discuss the
