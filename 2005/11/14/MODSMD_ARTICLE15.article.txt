## Band's Tree costume stolen yet again A 						group of thieves heisted the broken Tree costume from a dumpster 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a heist fitting for the days leading up to Big Game, a group of
thieves allegedly stole the TVee costume from a dumpster outside the
Band Shak sometime last week.
The TVee was in the garbage because senior Erin Lashnits, who dons
the outfit at sporting events for the band, broke the costume during the
UCLA football game on Oct. 29. She explained that she ruined her old
costume in a fit of fury after the overtime loss to the Bruins.
"After the UCLA game I was understandably upset," she said. "I
came back to the Band Shak and started raging around and destroyed
my costume in the process. Everything was broken; all the layers were
ripped off, all the metal rings were bent and the top was completely
broken."
She deemed the mangled costume irreparable and decided to build a
new one, which she has been working hard on in preparation for next Sat
urday's Big Game.
"I'm almost done with the new costume," she said. "And this one is
much better than the old one. It won't break even if I try."
Senior Chris Holt, the Band's public relations director, said he sus
pects that a group of students from UC-Berkeley were the perpetrators.
"We're guessing it was people with a lot of time on their hands and
who f#el very at home in dumpsters, so probably a bunch of Cal stu
dents," he said.
Lashnits said that she also suspects that Cal students were responsi
ble and congratulated them for stealing what she called "some pieces of
trash."
Holt echoed Lashnits' comments that the new costume will be far su
perior to its predecessor.
"The TVee will have her costume ready for Big Game and we're real
ly psyched for that," he said. "The new costume is going to be 10,()00
times better than the old one."
Last year, a group of Cal students stole the costume during Big Game
Week and again in the middle of January when members of the Band
had let their guard down.
During the 2003-2004 school year, the costume was stolen on two
separate occasions, once during a Pier 39 band rally during Big Game
Week and again during winter break when the University was closed.
