# SPECIAL EVENT
## Walsh promotes diversity in sports 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
"Times have changed, and times are changing." That was
the message Interim Athletics Director Bill Walsh delivered,
speaking on the dynamics of competition and race in colle
giate and professional sports as he reflected on five decades of
coaching. The Hall of Fame football coach and winner of three
Super Bowl titles chronicled his career-long struggle to recruit
and mentor minority athletes during the hour-long event, held
in an overflowing classroom in a Friday lecture sponsored by
the African and African American Studies department.
"Some of us have sensitivity to others and a social con
sciousness," Walsh explained. "Some of us are bolder about
taking steps and taking action [to redress racial injustice].
Sports are the one common denominator that embraces
everyone â€” young or old, white or black."
Walsh said he developed racial tolerance as a young ath
lete.
"1 was on two different boxing teams when 1 was young
where I was the only white guy on the team," he said. "We
won all but one of our games. 1 was, in a sense, a minority
then."
Walsh first spoke about his time as a recruiter for UC-
Berkeley in the early 1 %os. Complaining that the "sterile ad
missions process" led to little diversity, Walsh said he was an
early believer that an applicant's potential should be re
viewed in addition to their grade point average and stan
dardized test scores.
"As a recruiter, 1 took it upon myself to go into Oakland
and see if there were young men who could qualify for

Berkeley," he said, noting that he found, recruited and men
tored three basketball players who would go on to become
successful professionals later in life.
As head football coach at Stanford in 1977 and 1978,
Walsh proudly told the audience that Stanford was the first
school to have three African American assistant coaches.
At the San Francisco 49ers, Walsh trumpeted a successful
internship program he personally implemented that gave
coaches of color opportunities to work in professional foot
ball. Everyone who joined Walsh's internship program at the
49ers went on to an assistant coaching position in the Nation
al Football League or a head coaching job in college football,
he said.
Walsh noted that football is far more minority inclusive
than it was when he first became involved.
"We now have minorities heavily involved in the NFL,"
he said. "There are six black head coaches, and more than
half of all coaches are minorities."
As a lecturer at the Graduate School of Business, Walsh
directs seminars that are dedicated to teaching minorities
about the inner workings of professional sports.
He explained that race is becoming less important in
sports as ability has become more important than color.
"If a coach, white or black, is living in the past, they're
looking backward." he said. "If you're looking backward,
someone will pass you. There is not time or room to be dis
tracted by color anymore."
The coach noted that race stereotyping and discrimina
tion goes down as contact between the races goes up.
"Once we come into contact with
each other and socialize, we wonder
what the problem is," he said.
Walsh outlined many challenges
that remain for African Americans.
"We still have segments of our
population that we are not connect
ing with," he said. "We saw that in
New Orleans and it got thrown in our
face. One of the problems in the
inner-city, or hoods, are the gangs.
Gangs do not want people playing
sports."
Walsh also extended his prognosti
cation about the current state of race
to college athletics.
"In college sports, we have not
been able to break through in terms of
coaches of color," he said. "But there is
a tide that is rising.The gates are open."
Walsh further explained the chang
ing demographics of sports teams.
"We see fewer and fewer white ath
letes," he added to laughter from the
diverse audience. "We [whites) are
going to be the ones selling the tickets
and parking the cars, I guess."
Walsh accepted questions from the
audience after finishing his talk.
Many audience members said they
enjoyed Walsh's speech and his out
look for minorities in sports.

"It's amazing to see someone who
has been so devoted to ensuring racial
equality," said Liz McCaslin, a market
ing associate for the Athletics Depart
ment. "He's taken a stance, opened
doors and not been concerned about
the repercussions."
Robyn Fields runs a college prepa
ration program called The Quad for
disadvantaged minority students in
grades five through 12. She brought 18
students to hear Walsh 's speech as part
of a Stanford campus visit.
"The students in our program have
never been exposed to anyone like
him before," she said. "He was a prolif
ic speaker who gave the students in
sight that 1 think will help them face
their academic decisions."
Walsh served as General Manager
and Vice President for the 49ers from
1999 to 2001. In 2004. Walsh was ap
pointed a special assistant to Athletics
Director Ted Iceland. Walsh agreed to
serve as Interim Athletics Director
until a replacement is found.
Friday's lecture was the sixth in an
eight-part series sponsored by the
African and African American Studies
department on "Sports and Race."
Some students are attending the series
to earn credit in the first quarter. The
next lecture will be delivered by Keith
I larrison of Arizona State University
Friday in Building 200, Room 30 at
noon. Harrison will speak on "the
Scholar-Bailer lifestyle in 21st century
athletics and high education."
