# SPECIAL EVENT
## Walsh promotes diversity in sports 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
"Times have changed, and times are changing." That was
the message Interim Athletics Director Bill Walsh delivered,
speaking on the dynamics of competition and race in colle
giate and professional sports as he reflected on five decades of
coaching. The Hall of Fame football coach and winner of three
Super Bowl titles chronicled his career-long struggle to recruit
and mentor minority athletes during the hour-long event, held
in an overflowing classroom in a Friday lecture sponsored by
the African and African American Studies department.
"Some of us have sensitivity to others and a social con
sciousness," Walsh explained. "Some of us are bolder about
taking steps and taking action [to redress racial injustice].
Sports are the one common denominator that embraces
everyone â€” young or old, white or black."
Walsh said he developed racial tolerance as a young ath
lete.
"1 was on two different boxing teams when 1 was young
where I was the only white guy on the team," he said. "We
won all but one of our games. 1 was, in a sense, a minority
then."
Walsh first spoke about his time as a recruiter for UC-
Berkeley in the early 1 %os. Complaining that the "sterile ad
missions process" led to little diversity, Walsh said he was an
early believer that an applicant's potential should be re
viewed in addition to their grade point average and stan
dardized test scores.
"As a recruiter, 1 took it upon myself to go into Oakland
and see if there were young men who could qualify for

Berkeley," he said, noting that he found, recruited and men
tored three basketball players who would go on to become
successful professionals later in life.
As head football coach at Stanford in 1977 and 1978,
Walsh proudly told the audience that Stanford was the first
school to have three African American assistant coaches.
At the San Francisco 49ers, Walsh trumpeted a successful
internship program he personally implemented that gave
coaches of color opportunities to work in professional foot
ball. Everyone who joined Walsh's internship program at the
49ers went on to an assistant coaching position in the Nation
al Football League or a head coaching job in college football,
he said.
Walsh noted that football is far more minority inclusive
than it was when he first became involved.
"We now have minorities heavily involved in the NFL,"
he said. "There are six black head coaches, and more than
half of all coaches are minorities."
As a lecturer at the Graduate School of Business, Walsh
directs seminars that are dedicated to teaching minorities
about the inner workings of professional sports.
He explained that race is becoming less important in
sports as ability has become more important than color.
"If a coach, white or black, is living in the past, they're
looking backward." he said. "If you're looking backward,
someone will pass you. There is not time or room to be dis
tracted by color anymore."
The coach noted that race stereotyping and discrimina
tion goes down as contact between the races goes up.
