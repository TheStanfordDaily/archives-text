## Editorial Ramp up the spirit; Win Big Game! 
### 
Today marks the beginning of Big
Game Week, and with the best chance
to win in four years and the last
chance for the Class of 2006, Stanford (and
that means you!) should really show school
spirit this week. Where Big Game has in the
past been mostly of a day of celebration
rather than a week of festivities, the Univer
sity is actively working to make the campus
visibly "Big" for the entire week before the
game.
Doing our part to improve school spirit,
we've made a cheat sheet for the most impor
tant events of the week.
It began last Wednesday when a group of
select Stanford fanatics met in secret to go
over Big Game Week plans and strategize
how to show support for the Cardinal
throughout the week.
The transformation starts today — all stu
dents should display their Stanford pride by
wearing red every day this week.
Today also marks the kickoff event,"the
Bearial procession" with the Band at the
Claw fountain at noon.
TUesday and Wednesday feature "Beat-a-
Bear" giveaways from 10:30 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.,
where students can get a free stuffed bear to
destroy for Big Game Week. Tliesday at 7
p.m. at Cubberley Auditorium is Big Sing,
featuring eight Stanford and eight Cal a
capella groups.
Curious what the übiquitous "Who Killed
Dean Julie?" signs are all about? On
Wednesday night, Gaieties, the beloved tra
ditional "trash-Cal" musical, opens at 8 p.m.
at Memorial Auditorium. This year's theme:
an elaborate murder mystery casting Julie
Lythcott-Haims as the victim and bigshot
donor John Arrillaga as a possible assassin.
Like many of the other festivities. Gai
eties has undergone many changes this year.
In particular, this year's show has been

trimmed to run in under two hours and a new
sound system has been set up in MemAud
that carries much better and allow all of the
principals and many of the ensemble cast to
have microphones. Thursday's 8 p.m. show is
the senior show, including free beer and wine
beforehand for over-21 seniors.
At 10 p.m. after the show is the pre-game
rally at Hoover Tower, with free food and T
shirts and appearances by the Band and foot
ball team. This event experienced a complete
transformation last year and went from ap
proximately 100 attendants to 1.300. It prom
ises to be even more popular this year.
Friday has in store one of the more cre
ative events of the week, a blue and gold
clothing drive from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in White
Plaza.
Friday night is the first of many "Big"
sports events against Cal over the weekend:
Big Spike features women's volleyball vs.
Cal at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion. Saturday
begins with women's diving vs. Cal at 10
a.m.. then Big Splash with men's water polo
at 1 p.m.
The entire week builds to the "Big" event
itself — Big Game against Cal. With its best
season since 2001 .the football team has given
Class of 2006 fans the faith that Stanford can
win a Big Game while they are still on the
Farm. Every student should wear red to the
game to ensure the "Cardinal Flood" in the
student section is in full effect.
With a week chock full of Big Game
events, the University should be commended
for working hard to get students pumped and
showing Stanford pride for the granddaddy
of all Stanford traditions.

Axe? Go to http://biggame.stanford.edu and

every day this week.
