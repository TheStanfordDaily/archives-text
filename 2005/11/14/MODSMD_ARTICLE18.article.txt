# On bananas
## 
### 
I'd never really given a second thought to
the plastic Del Monte bags that cover ba
nanas at the grocery store. That is, not
until I went to Costa Rica this summer and
visited a Del Monte banana plantation.
From the actual plants, an elaborate pul
ley system transports the bananas to a large
shed where, after a multistage selection
process, they are wrapped in the familiar
plastic bags and shipped to North America.
Tourists can observe the different steps of
the banana selection process from behind a
waist-high wall. For several minutes, I
watched the workers — mostly young peo
ple, a mix of male and female — repeat the
same task over and over. Some pulled the ba
nanas off the plant, threw out the bad ones
and placed the good ones in a huge basin of
water. The next group made sure the ba
nanas had been properly rinsed and subject
ed them to another selection process.The ba
nanas went through several more rounds of
selection before a group of workers finally
wrapped them in their plastic Del Monte
bags and sent them off on a conveyor belt
into the unknown.
Bananas were flying everywhere as they
were being thrown out or into the basins.'l he
workers executed their tasks as if on autopilot.
This is what Marx was referring to when he
talked about the alienation of the worker, I
thought. Once in a while, they would smile and
talk to each other. Ihey teemed almost un
aware that dozens of tourists were watching
them, whipping out their fancy digital cameras
and excitedly clicking away at the "pictur
esque" scene taking place in front of them.
1 really didn't know if it was an acceptable
thing for me to take pictures. On the one
hand, I wanted a record of the whole process,
especially the green banana bunches — they
pick them while they're still completely
green — but on the other hand it seemed
disrespectful. They were hard at work, and
yet some of the tourists were photographing
them as if they were curious animals at the
zoo. I really wanted to talk to them, which

would have re-humanized the experience,
but the wall separating us stopped me.
As I hesitated and continued to observe
the scene, my gaze met one of the worker's
and we stared at each other for a full second.
He was just a little older than me. As we
stared at each other, I felt our common
human bond. But the wall was still there, re
minding me that in spite of this bond, our
lives couldn't be more different.
1 was born into a relatively wealthy fami
ly. in a rich country. He and the other work
ers were born into poor families in a devel
oping country. Even if we worked the exact
same amount of time and put the exact same
effort into what we did, our lives would still
be very different.
Who has more merit? 1 wondered: some
one who achieves great success in a rich
country but has never known any financial
difficulties or someone who struggles to
make a decent living for himself and his fam
ily in a poor country? Does it even make
sense to compare such different human ex
periences?
Do people who were born into more fa
vorable circumstances owe something to
their fellow human beings? Is it their moral
duty to correct some of the inequalities that
are the product of pure chance?
As I left the banana plantation, my head
was swimming with these thoughts. I still
haven't found answers that satisfy me, but
every time I see the familiar Del Monte logo
on mv breakfast bananas, I wonder.
