Bicycle citations make sense
I would like to applaud the Stanford Police Department
for giving out bicycle citations ("Students question bicycle
citations," Nov. 10). As a Stanford resident who regularly
drives across the campus. I am appalled at the dangerous
manner in which many students cross intersections. Too
many completely ignore the stop signs and dash through as
if they have the priority to do so. I have often wondered why
the police do not cite these bicyclists who are endangering
not only themselves but others as well. I am happy to learn
that such citations are being given.
I strongly urge that every incoming student be required
to take a class in bicycle safety. It would make for a safer
and more pleasant trip across campus whether on a bike or
in a car.

Google results don't say anything
While Krug and Mclean's column ("You make the call",
Nov. 11) was extremely interesting and logical. I did have
one minor inaccuracy to point out: 1,300 results for a Google
search is nothing. Google indexes billions of web pages. If we
assume that every person on the planet has one web page
and Google has an index of 7 billion pages, then 1.300 results
means that less than one millionth of a percent of the people
in the world think that the NCAA rules are ridiculous. Heck,
even searching for "editorials, lameass" on Google comes up
with around 1,830 results. What does that say about how peo
ple think of your article?
