## I'm Al Gore—I used to be the next president of the United States. Al Gore speaks to business students Al Gore focuses on environmental issues at Net Impact Conference 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The Net Impact Conference's
keynote speaker introduced himself
at Memorial Auditorium Friday
morning far better than any reporter
could.
"I'm A 1 Gore — I used to be the
next president of the United States,"
said the former vice president, elicit
ing laughter from the 1,400 in atten
dance. "I don't think that's funny. I
used to fly on Air Force TWo for eight
years. Now I have to take off my shoes
to get on an airplane."
Beginning Friday Nov. 4, MBA stu
dents from around the country at
tended the Net Impact Conference, an
annual weekend-long meeting that
aims to promote social and environ

mental responsibility in business.
Gore noted that the attendance was
the largest ever for a Stanford-hosted
conference.
Gore focused upon environmen
tal issues in his 47-minute speech,
opening by saying that human activi
ty is significantly altering the environ
ment.
"It's very hard for people to imag
ine that we could be having a hard im
pact on something as large as the
Earth's system," Gore said. "That's
really a barrier to understanding for
many, many people, so you have to
start with recognition of the very
basic fact that the relationship be
tween human beings on the one hand
and planet Earth on the other hand is
a relationship that has been utterly
transformed in the past 100 years."
Perhaps most powerful was
Gore's conclusion, a call to action for
the younger audience.
"In situations where your person
al relationships or your career path
seems to be on the line, remember
that right is right even if the people
you're working with aren't doing it,
and wrong is wrong even if everyone
is doing it," Gore said before receiv
ing a standing ovation from the
crowd."Remember these values have
to be integrated. It's not too extreme
to say our survival depends upon it.
When you face that challenge, choose
the hard right over the easy wrong. It
will get easier, but you have to be
strong, and you have to take the com
mitments so strong in you now, pro
tect them, cherish them and be the
change you want to see in the world."
In a question-and-answer session
following his speech. Gore expressed
disappointment in the American pub
lic, suggesting that representatives
can enact wise policy only with a well
informed populace.
"On the eve of the Iraq war, ac
cording to public opinion polls, 77
percent of the American people gen-

uinely believed that Saddam Hussein was the person re
sponsible for crashing the planes into the buildings,"
Gore said. "If the public sphere produces mass delu
sions, then the questions of transparency and accounta
bility are important, but secondary to an effort to fix the
operation of our market of ideas."
Not known for his wit when serv ing as vice president
from 1993 to 2(X)1 or as a Democratic senator from Ten
nessee eight years prior. Gore opened his speech with
self-deprecating humor. 1 le took a jab at his home state
for the Scopes Monkey Trial but mainly joked about his
diminished prestige since narrowly losing the 2(MH) pres
idential election to George W. Bush.
"The waitress came over, and made a big commotion
over Tipper," Gore said, describing an encounter at a
Shoney's, a low-end chain restaurant. "Then she took
our order... and the man [at the next table] said/He's re
ally come down a long way.'"
Amid the jests. Gore briefly reflected on his eight
years in the Oval Office.
"Speaking of Bill Clinton, I think he and 1 did a pret
ty good job when we were in the White House," Gore
said, drawing thunderous applause.
Robert Joss, Dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness, introduced Gore, defending his centrality in the
launch of the Internet.
"David Letterman and Jay Leno had a lot of fun
about A 1 inventing the Internet," Joss said."Well, it's not
quite true, but he, probably more than any single indi
vidual in public policy in the '90s. was responsible for

laying that groundwork and framework that really has
made Internet and Web service possible today."
Gore last spoke at Stanford at the "View from the
Top" conference in March 2(X>4. His speech inspired
GSB students to create a primer on the science, politics
and economics of climate change.The primer, the first of
its kind at a top business school, reached thousands of
GSB alumni when it was included in the alumni maga
zine.
"Memorial Auditorium was packed, and he chal
lenged students to use their business skills to address
pressing social and environmental concerns," said Jen
nifer Ratay, acting director of the public management
program at the GSB.
This time. Ratay said Gore proved an even more
powerful draw.
"It's been unfortunate, but we had to turn away a lot
of people that wanted to come," Ratay said, whose de
partment was responsible for hosting the event. "If we
had the capacity to do it, the demand was certainly there
to host a conference twice this size."
Gore's speech highlighted the weekend-long con
ference. which featured two other keynote speakers, a
career fair and five breakout sessions where partici
pants could discuss environmental sustainability issues
in smaller groups. The conference also took several
steps to minimize its environmental impact — serving
organic meals and partnering with DuPont to purchase
carbon dioxide emission credits to offset the confer
ence's emissions.
