### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The Net Impact Conference's
keynote speaker introduced himself
at Memorial Auditorium Friday
morning far better than any reporter
could.
"I'm A 1 Gore — I used to be the
next president of the United States,"
said the former vice president, elicit
ing laughter from the 1,400 in atten
dance. "I don't think that's funny. I
used to fly on Air Force TWo for eight
years. Now I have to take off my shoes
to get on an airplane."
Beginning Friday Nov. 4, MBA stu
dents from around the country at
tended the Net Impact Conference, an
annual weekend-long meeting that
aims to promote social and environ

mental responsibility in business.
Gore noted that the attendance was
the largest ever for a Stanford-hosted
conference.
Gore focused upon environmen
tal issues in his 47-minute speech,
opening by saying that human activi

"It's very hard for people to imag

and planet Earth on the other hand is
a relationship that has been utterly
transformed in the past 100 years."
Perhaps most powerful was
Gore's conclusion, a call to action for
the younger audience.
"In situations where your person

seems to be on the line, remember
that right is right even if the people
you're working with aren't doing it,
and wrong is wrong even if everyone
is doing it," Gore said before receiv
ing a standing ovation from the
crowd."Remember these values have
to be integrated. It's not too extreme
to say our survival depends upon it.
When you face that challenge, choose
the hard right over the easy wrong. It
will get easier, but you have to be
strong, and you have to take the com
mitments so strong in you now, pro
tect them, cherish them and be the
change you want to see in the world."
In a question-and-answer session
following his speech. Gore expressed
disappointment in the American pub

can enact wise policy only with a well
informed populace.
