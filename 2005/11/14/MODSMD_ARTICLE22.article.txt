# S.F. secession and Bill O'Reilly
## 
### 
Apparently, San Francisco seceded
from the Union last week. I was not
aware that San Franciscans voted on
secession in the recent election, but accord
ing to conservative talk show host Bill
O'Reilly, that's exactly what they did. Some
how the population of SF managed to
forcibly remove the National Guard by
pelting them with hacky-sacks and Rice-a-
Roni.
It seems the two laws that San Francis
cans passed did not meet with O'Reilly's
approval. I'm guessing by his disapproval
that they either outlawed bullying people
on national television or bacon products.
One of the two.
I was on Pier 39 yesterday at a rally for the
Big Game. Representatives from both
schools were there, hundreds of fans, chil
dren of all ages, the bush guy — everybody. I
look and I see Coit Tower, that tourist icon I
visited when I was a young kid. And then in
my mind I hear Bill O'Reilly's quote to al
Qaeda: "You want to blow up the Coit
Tower? Go ahead." Now, he'll probably say
this quote is being taken out of context, and
it is. He earlier stated that if he were presi
dent of the United States, he'd tell al Qaeda
this. Thankfully, he will be president just as
soon as hell freezes over and Pat Robertson
starts waving the rainbow flag.
Pat, by the way, also had a nice gem of a
comment last week. He warned citizens of
Dover, a rural Pennsylvania town, that if
disaster struck the area, they should not
turn to God. Obviously Pat has never been
to Pennsylvania. If he had, he'd realize God
gave up on the Keystone State long ago.
Pat stated that Pennsylvanians rejected
God in an election last week. I did not know

you could vote to reject the Omnipotent, and
most Christians would say this is all part of
God's master plan, but apparently Pat has
less belief in God than most Christians. Pat
warned Pennsylvanians of God's wrath for
democratically electing pro-evolution mem
bers to a school board. Also, God wasn't
happy with the latest bake sale numbers.
This prophecy of destruction would
seem random if it wasn't for his 1998 com
ments that Orlando's allowance of rainbow
flags would "bring about terrorist bombs;
it'll bring earthquakes, tornadoes and possi
bly a meteor." Unless you count the 2000
election, Orlando hasn't been hit by a natu
ral disaster in seven years. 1 still haven't
seen Mickey Mouse impaled by a flaming
mass of space rock.
When I told my roommate about these
prophecies, he mused, "God is the ultimate
terrorist." 1 think he was hung over, but he
does have a point.
A terrorist is a "radical who employs ter
ror as a political weapon." Pat calls for hell
fire and brimstone. Bill calls for al Qaeda to
blow up a city he doesn't like. So does that
make Pat Robertson and Bill O'Reilly ter
rorists? And would Bush support torturing
them? Probably not. Both will likely be let
off the hook with a recanting or a "my quote

was taken out of context" blurb — neither
of which will be sincere.
As I drove down the 101,1 couldn't help
but think: you have to be crazy to not love
this city. I love it for its idiosyncrasies. I love
that its baseball stadium can't keep a name.
I love it because I can get a kilt in the
Haight, I can harass tourists at Union
Square, and I can walk through one of the
most loving places in the world in the Cas
tro. So maybe San Francisco is a bit in its
own world. 1 love the city because it knows
it's weird and quirky and out of touch with
the rest of the country and can bitch slap
you for thinking that's a bad thing. SF has
sass, dammit.
But Bill wants it blown up because it
voted to stop a discrimatory body from re
cruiting in its public schools? Some people
think that's progressive. It voted to ban
handguns, which if you know SF at all, is
probably because the color gray clashes
with tie-dye.
So here's what I propose: send Pat
Robertson and Bill O'Reilly images of ter
rorist bombings, natural disasters and gen
eral human suffering. If they want to see
such horror, then they should at least under
stand what it is they are encouraging. My
guess, however, would be that it's going to
be awfully hard to see suffering with one's
head shoved so far up one's ass.

Bill also called for the United Nations to be hit
by Hurricane Katrina. Feel free to call his
radio show or e-mail him at @billoreilly.com
to suggest other terrible human tragedies he
can use to slam his political enemies. As al
ways, send Chris complaints at cholt@Stan
