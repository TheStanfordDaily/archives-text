## Rugby: It'll have you in stitches 
### 
The referee yelled "Scrum!" after a
player threw an illegal forward pass
Saturday morning on Steuber field. I
looked on in fascination as eight players on
each team formed two lines, then ran into
each other as hard as they could.
The ref dropped a ball between them,
and the players tried to kick it out of the cir
cle so that someone else on their team could
pick it up and run until she got tackled, at
which point another player would pick it up
until she got tackled and so on, until the
team either scored a goal or lost possession.
Confused? I was. I sat in the stands
watching a women's rugby game, trying to
understand why so many of my friends have
become addicted to the sport. But I wasn't
getting any closer to finding out why many
see it as a better alternative to American
football. It was watching pile-up after pile
up except, unlike in football, these were en
couraged.
I knew that any attempt to understand
the actual rules would be futile, so I asked
Ryan Rennaker, who played in the men's
game that afternoon, if he could compare
rugby to another sport.
"Think of the very end of a football
game," he said. "One team is receiving a
kickoff and there's no time left on the clock
so they have to pitch the ball to each other
to try to keep the ball alive. Rugby is like
that all the time. You can't pass forward, so
you keep passing backwards to your team
mates The main difference is that when a
tackle is made, play continues."

would agree that those last few mo
ments are the most exciting part of a
football game. But even some of
those wild kickoff returns come from
rugby. Rennaker said. He told me
that we can thank (or blame) rugby
for"The Play." Berkeley's six-lateral
kickoff return touchdown to win Big
Game in 1982 as time expired. All of
the players involved played rugby in
the off-season, so they knew exactly
how to coordinate it.
Matt TUrnbull, who also plays on
the men's team,gave me a pretty com
prehensive definition, despite the fact
that he had just received 10 stitches
after getting his face split open in the
mens game that afternoon.
"Rugby is a game in which one
team advances the ball up the pitch
by running, kicking and passing in
order to score a 'try' in the rugby
equivalent to an 'end zone,"' Turn
bull said. "The other team tries to
prevent their advance by tackling
them and try ing to steal the ball."
He was as confused as I was when
he saw his first rugby game at Stan
ford but decided to join the team be
cause of the game's physicality and
its popularity around the globe, ri
valed only by soccer.
If you follow Turnbull home after
a game, you will learn that you really
do have to love the pounding you
take in rugby. He usually goes
straight from a match to the hospital
to be treated for anything from cuts
to concussions, dislocations and torn

ligaments.
"Because you don't wear any
pads in rugby, you really feel the
hits," he said. "It's difficult to walk,
and there are always nagging aches
and pains."
That made me scratch my head a
little over why Matt put physicality
in the "plus" column. It looks like fun
when you're the one doing the tack
ling. but. on the rare occasions when
1 actually play sports, I prefer to
leave feeling like I have not just been
involved in an 18 -car pile-up.
"Don't you have to be a little bit
crazy to play rugby?" I asked TUrn
bull.
"No," he said, then paused.
"Maybe I'm rationalizing here. I
don't think I'm crazy but my friends
do."
With several stitches in his head,
TUrnbull probably wasn't in much of
a state to rationalize at all. But Ren
naker backed him up.
"I play rugby because it is the best
sport in the world," he said. "I caught
the bug freshman year when they
told me I could go out and hit people
without any pads."
American football is often seen
as rugby's more civilized cousin, but
both Rennaker and TUrnbull dis
agreed with that assessment, insist
ing that rugby and football are vio
lent in different ways.
"In football you get guys running
full speed at each other and cracking
helmets," Rennaker said. "You can
get big hits in rugby as well but gen
erally people try to tackle safely and
intelligently. If I tackled like I did
when I played football, I'd probably
end up in a wheelchair.
"The flip side of that is that your

only protection is a mouth-guard."
TUrnbull pointed out that football
injuries,such as broken bones,blown
knees and severe concussions, are
more major than the ones he re
ceives on a weekly basis.
"In rugby, you have to be smart
about the physical contact," he said.
Rugby also seems more team-ori
ented. Players, not coaches, decide
which plays to run and have to make
decisions on the fly. Every position
does essentially the same thing: tack
ling, carrying the ball and blocking
opponents.
The players who I was watching
on Saturday certainly seemed to be
having fun. Two women playing for
Stanford's opponent, Cal Poly San
Louis Obispo, collided at one point
and fell to the turf. One walked off
with blood dripping out of her
mouth, having apparently bitten her
tongue, though 1 didn't check. Mo
ments later, the other woman was
helped off the field. She looked
dazed, and I'm guessing it had some
thing to do with the sand dollar-sized
bump on her forehead.
Five minutes later, they were
laughing and posing for photos to
gether.
That must be the sign of a good
sport: When you can walk off the
field with blood dripping down your
face and still muster a three-toothed
smile.

Sean Howell, a junior, wrote this col
umn while nursing a massive hang
over, so he has some idea of what
rugby players must feel like on Sunday
morning. E-mail him at

any good headache remedies.
