## Rugby: It'll have you in stitches 
### 
The referee yelled "Scrum!" after a
player threw an illegal forward pass
Saturday morning on Steuber field. I
looked on in fascination as eight players on
each team formed two lines, then ran into
each other as hard as they could.
The ref dropped a ball between them,
and the players tried to kick it out of the cir
cle so that someone else on their team could
pick it up and run until she got tackled, at
which point another player would pick it up
until she got tackled and so on, until the
team either scored a goal or lost possession.
Confused? I was. I sat in the stands
watching a women's rugby game, trying to
understand why so many of my friends have
become addicted to the sport. But I wasn't
getting any closer to finding out why many
see it as a better alternative to American
football. It was watching pile-up after pile
up except, unlike in football, these were en
couraged.
I knew that any attempt to understand
the actual rules would be futile, so I asked
Ryan Rennaker, who played in the men's
game that afternoon, if he could compare
rugby to another sport.
"Think of the very end of a football
game," he said. "One team is receiving a
kickoff and there's no time left on the clock
so they have to pitch the ball to each other
to try to keep the ball alive. Rugby is like
that all the time. You can't pass forward, so
you keep passing backwards to your team
mates The main difference is that when a
tackle is made, play continues."
