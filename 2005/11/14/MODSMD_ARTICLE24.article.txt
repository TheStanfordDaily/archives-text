# I hate losing...And I hate losing in overtime. You have to win those matches.
## JOHN DUNNING, head coach Glass, Wildcats defeat Cardinal in heartbreaker No. 4 Stanford squanders three match points at Maples 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All night long last Friday, the west end of
the Maples Pavilion court proved lucky.
Through the first four games of the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball's match against
No. 6 Arizona, the team on that side of the net
always won, leaving the contest tied heading
into the decisive fifth game.
When the Cardinal (22-5, 11-4 Pacific 10
Conference) ended up on that side with the
chance to put away the Wildcats (18-5,10-4)
at the end of the marathon match, it seemed
that the trend would hold but Stanford's luck
ran out. The team failed to convert three
match points and fell to the Wildcats for the
second time this season, losing 26-30. 30-17,
22-30,30-26,16-IS on Friday night.
"I hate losing," head coach John Dunning
said. "And 1 hate losing in overtime. You have
to win those matches. We thought we were in
the right place, catching up in the middle of
the fifth. We just couldn't put it away at the
end, even though we were on the right side of
the court."
As the Cardinal continue to retool follow
ing the loss of freshman outside hitter Cyn
thia Barboza and sophomore setter Bryn
Kehoe, many bright spots emerged in the Ari
zona loss.
"Given the situation we are in — what
we're dealing with, trying to get everybody
used to what they are doing — I thought we
played really good volleyball," Dunning said.
Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards's 29
kills came just shy of her career high of 31, set
last week at Washington State. Richards was
also one of three Cardinal players to finish
with nine digs, joining senior setter Katie
Goldhahn and senior libero Courtney Schultz
to lead the defense.
With Richards receiving the majority of

the sets, freshman middle blocker Foluke Ak
inradewo had a quiet hitting night, though she
still finished with 12 kills.
The match turned into a serving battle, and
the Cardinal had a strong showing from the
line with 11 service aces, including four from
Goldhahn and three from freshman defensive
specialist Jessica Fishburn.
"We showed that we can still play really
excellent volleyball regardless of who is out
there," junior middle blocker Lizzie Suiter
said. "We are not all just out there doing our
own thing; we're actually playing as a team.
We showed that we can fight and that we can
compete with the other top 10 teams."
Suiter, finally healthy after battling two
ankle sprains and an eye injury earlier this
season, was a dominant presence at the net
with eight total blocks, including two solo.
"We don't have room for any more in
juries," Suiter said. "So even if 1 did [still hurt],
we're not going to worry about it. A lot of peo
ple are in a lot worse shape than 1 am, so I am
lucky to be out there."
lliree solo blocks from Richards and one
from junior right side Nji Nnamani helped the
Cardinal out-block Arizona, 14.5-10, a
marked improvement from when Arizona
out-blocked the Cardinal 16-5 in the teams'
previous meeting.
"We knew that they hurt us a lot cross
court last time, so we decided to move the
block in," Suiter said. "That at least gave them
less court to hit at, more opportunity to make
mistakes. It worked a lot better and it also
helped our defense, redirecting the ball to
ward our diggers."
"We thought people were starting to pre
dict what we were doing and practicing to
beat that," Dunning added. "So now we have
two ways to [block] so people can't zero in on
any one."
The Cardinal started the match strong,
jumping out to an 18-10 lead on the strength
of an 11-3 run. Arizona closed the gap, but

Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards has filled the offensive vacuum created by freshman
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza's season-ending injury. Nonetheless, despite 29 kills,
Richards could not rally Stanford past the Wildcats on Friday.
Stanford rebounded, pulling ahead
26-21. The Cardinal then watched
the game slip away as Arizona pow
erhouse outside hitter Kim Glass
served nine straight points, including
two aces, to win 30-26.
"I think that is an issue of
matchups and distraction," Dunning
said. "When someone like Glass
starts serving and is really on with
her serve and we get a good first pass
hut can't get a kill, then on the next
play passing gets harder."
In the second game, it was Stan
ford's turn for long service runs.
Fishhurn stepped to the line with a
three-point advantage and did not
step away until Stanford led 27-16.
Richards tallied a pair of kills and
Arizona committed a hitting error to
give Stanford the 30-17 second game
victory.
The Arizona offense was hot in
the third game, putting down 23 kills
while Stanford mustered just nine.
The Cardinal trailed by only four at
the halfway point, but Arizona pow
ered to a 30-22 win behind nine kills
from Jennifer Abernathy and seven
from Glass.
Stanford came out fighting in the
fourth to for the must-win game.
The Cardinal took the first four

points of the game and jumped
ahead 9-3. But with Abernathy at
the service line, the Wildcats erased
their deficit with 10 straight points,
to suddenly lead by three. Stanford
came back and Richards capped the
30-26 win by stuffing Glass and
powering down a kill. The fourth
game was a defensive battle, with
the Cardinal hitting .(KM) as a team
and holding the Wildcats to a nega
tive percentage.
Arizona rebounded with a quick
start in the final game, going up by
three before the Cardinal fought
back to tie the game at seven. The
two teams traded points until Stan
ford reached match point after a
Glass hitting error.The Cardinal had
three opportunities to close out the
win but could not get the ball to go
down. One chance was all it took for
the Wildcats, who converted their
first match point on a Dominique
Lamb kill.
On Friday, the Cardinal host
cross-bay rivals No. 18 California in
the last home match of the confer
ence season. They will then wrap up
league play with a road trip to Los
Angeles after Thanksgiving.
"I think practice on Monday will
be very telling because everyone is
going to have this new fire under
neath them," Suiter said. "If we get
Cal, then maybe we can roll in and
get UCLA and USC. Every day we
get better, and I'm looking forward
to the next match."

served nine straight points, including
two aces, to win 30-26.
"I think that is an issue of
matchups and distraction," Dunning
said. "When someone like Glass
starts serving and is really on with
her serve and we get a good first pass
hut can't get a kill, then on the next
play passing gets harder."
In the second game, it was Stan
ford's turn for long service runs.
Fishhurn stepped to the line with a
three-point advantage and did not
step away until Stanford led 27-16.
Richards tallied a pair of kills and
Arizona committed a hitting error to
give Stanford the 30-17 second game
victory.
The Arizona offense was hot in
the third game, putting down 23 kills
while Stanford mustered just nine.
The Cardinal trailed by only four at
the halfway point, but Arizona pow
ered to a 30-22 win behind nine kills
from Jennifer Abernathy and seven
from Glass.
Stanford came out fighting in the
fourth to for the must-win game.
The Cardinal took the first four

points of the game and jumped
ahead 9-3. But with Abernathy at
the service line, the Wildcats erased
their deficit with 10 straight points,
to suddenly lead by three. Stanford
came back and Richards capped the
30-26 win by stuffing Glass and
powering down a kill. The fourth
game was a defensive battle, with
the Cardinal hitting .(KM) as a team
and holding the Wildcats to a nega
tive percentage.
Arizona rebounded with a quick
start in the final game, going up by
three before the Cardinal fought
back to tie the game at seven. The
two teams traded points until Stan
ford reached match point after a
Glass hitting error.The Cardinal had
three opportunities to close out the
win but could not get the ball to go
down. One chance was all it took for
the Wildcats, who converted their
first match point on a Dominique
Lamb kill.
On Friday, the Cardinal host
cross-bay rivals No. 18 California in
the last home match of the confer
ence season. They will then wrap up
league play with a road trip to Los
Angeles after Thanksgiving.
"I think practice on Monday will
be very telling because everyone is
going to have this new fire under
neath them," Suiter said. "If we get
Cal, then maybe we can roll in and
get UCLA and USC. Every day we
get better, and I'm looking forward
to the next match."
All night long last Friday, the west end of
the Maples Pavilion court proved lucky.
Through the first four games of the No. 4
Stanford women's volleyball's match against
No. 6 Arizona, the team on that side of the net
always won, leaving the contest tied heading
into the decisive fifth game.
When the Cardinal (22-5, 11-4 Pacific 10
Conference) ended up on that side with the
chance to put away the Wildcats (18-5,10-4)
at the end of the marathon match, it seemed
that the trend would hold but Stanford's luck
ran out. The team failed to convert three
match points and fell to the Wildcats for the
second time this season, losing 26-30. 30-17,
22-30,30-26,16-IS on Friday night.
"I hate losing," head coach John Dunning
said. "And 1 hate losing in overtime. You have
to win those matches. We thought we were in
the right place, catching up in the middle of
the fifth. We just couldn't put it away at the
end, even though we were on the right side of
the court."
As the Cardinal continue to retool follow
ing the loss of freshman outside hitter Cyn
thia Barboza and sophomore setter Bryn
Kehoe, many bright spots emerged in the Ari
zona loss.
"Given the situation we are in — what
we're dealing with, trying to get everybody
used to what they are doing — I thought we
played really good volleyball," Dunning said.
Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards's 29
kills came just shy of her career high of 31, set
last week at Washington State. Richards was
also one of three Cardinal players to finish
with nine digs, joining senior setter Katie
Goldhahn and senior libero Courtney Schultz
to lead the defense.
With Richards receiving the majority of

the sets, freshman middle blocker Foluke Ak
inradewo had a quiet hitting night, though she
still finished with 12 kills.
The match turned into a serving battle, and
the Cardinal had a strong showing from the
line with 11 service aces, including four from
Goldhahn and three from freshman defensive
specialist Jessica Fishburn.
"We showed that we can still play really
excellent volleyball regardless of who is out
there," junior middle blocker Lizzie Suiter
said. "We are not all just out there doing our
own thing; we're actually playing as a team.
We showed that we can fight and that we can
compete with the other top 10 teams."
Suiter, finally healthy after battling two
ankle sprains and an eye injury earlier this
season, was a dominant presence at the net
with eight total blocks, including two solo.
"We don't have room for any more in
juries," Suiter said. "So even if 1 did [still hurt],
we're not going to worry about it. A lot of peo
ple are in a lot worse shape than 1 am, so I am
lucky to be out there."
lliree solo blocks from Richards and one
from junior right side Nji Nnamani helped the
Cardinal out-block Arizona, 14.5-10, a
marked improvement from when Arizona
out-blocked the Cardinal 16-5 in the teams'
previous meeting.
"We knew that they hurt us a lot cross
court last time, so we decided to move the
block in," Suiter said. "That at least gave them
less court to hit at, more opportunity to make
mistakes. It worked a lot better and it also
helped our defense, redirecting the ball to
ward our diggers."
"We thought people were starting to pre
dict what we were doing and practicing to
beat that," Dunning added. "So now we have
two ways to [block] so people can't zero in on
any one."
The Cardinal started the match strong,
jumping out to an 18-10 lead on the strength
of an 11-3 run. Arizona closed the gap, but

Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards has filled the offensive vacuum created by freshman
outside hitter Cynthia Barboza's season-ending injury. Nonetheless, despite 29 kills,
Richards could not rally Stanford past the Wildcats on Friday.
