## Women, men both cruise at West Regionals 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
The NCAA West Regional Championship women's
race on Saturday seemed to be over before it began.
Sophomore Arianna Lambie blew away the competition,
and the Cardinal women claimed their seventh straight
team title.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal men powered down a notch
on Saturday and still placed second to Arizona in team
competition. The men did not run two of their best run
ners, and those who did race made sure to hold back for
a far more important meet. With their top-two finishes,
both the men and women

advance to the NCAA Na
tional Championships on
Monday, Nov. 21 in Terre
Haute, Ind.
The Cardinal women
appeared untouchable in
capturing the West Region
al title on the Stanford Golf
Course. The team racked
up 24 points, while second
place Arizona State had 48.
Lambie ran the 6,000-
meter race in 19:29.3 min
utes, leaving runner-up jun
ior Wildcat Amy Hastings
nearly 30 seconds behind at
19:58.4.
Stanford head coach
Peter Tegen believes Lam
bie is capable of an even
stronger race at Nationals.

Honestly, [Ari
zona's] not that
competitive with
us — we were
just playing
games.

Sophomore Teresa McWalters, junior Katy Irotter
and redshirt freshman Lindsay Flacks were fourth, fifth
and sixth overall, clocking in at 20:16.8, 20:17.1, and
20:17.3, respectively. Junior Amanda Trotter was eighth,
while sophomore Lauren Centrowitz was 12th. Redshirt
freshman Katie Harrington was seventh for the Cardinal
and 20th overall.
The men finished with 80 points, while champion team
Arizona had 33 points. This year was the first time in 10
years that the men have not captured the team title,
though Tegen was quick to point out that claiming a 1 Oth
straight title was not the objective.
"Clearly we were not set out to just win the Regional
title," Tegen said. "Second is just as good as first at this
meet. I felt really good about how they ran."
Sophomore Neftalem Araia, who finished eighth
overall in 30:23.5, echoed Tegen's sentiments.
"It's a regional race; we don't ever want to go in and
overthink it or make it a mini-national race, Araia said.

"1 definitely didn't run my hardest today," he added.
"We just tried to run as fast as possible and still qualify.
We were all picking guys off on the straightaway."
En route to victory, Arizona placed four runners in the
top 10, including first-place junior Robert Cheseret. But.
according to Araia, the Cardinal should not feel threat
ened.
"Arizona is a little bitter about what happened at Pac
10s because we beat them by thirty-something points on
their own home course." Araia said. "It was pretty public

that their goal was to beat us this year, at any chance they
got. When it didn't happen [at Pac-lOs] they really want
ed to prove they were competitive with us. Honestly,
they're not competitive with us — we were just playing
games today."
The second Cardinal finisher was junior Brett Gotch
er, who crossed in 11th overall in 30:26.3. Junior Jonathan
Pierce placed 14th in 30:36.4. while redshirt freshman

Freshman John McGuire runs just steps ahead of freshman Garrett Heath at the end of the 1 OK at the Stanford Golf
Course this past Saturday morning. Despite finishing second to Arizona, the men advance to Nationals next Monday.
Garrett Heath was 23rd in 30:54.4.
"I was very happy to see Heath
come back,"Tegen said. "He had a
tough race at Pac-lOs so I was real
ly pleased with his racing today."
Freshman John McGuire, red
shirt freshman Hari Mix and junior
Rolf Steier rounded out the Cardi
nal lineup. Two of the Cardinal's
best runners, senior David Vidal
and junior Jacob Gomez, sat out the
Regional race.
"We felt they would be better off
doing a little bit more tough train
ing throughout the week." Tegen
said. "We will bring them back for
Nationals and both of them will
run."
Araia is optimistic about the
men's last race at Nationals. Last
year, the men finished a disappoint
ing sixth but plan to rebound this
season.
"The team's a lot different this
year." Araia said. "We have a lot of
new faces, but we're handling the
responsibility well — it's not a bur
den trying to hold onto the tradi
tion. Last year, when we kind of fal
tered, people were really nervous,
angsty, unsure and not confident.
This year we just don't have those
problems."
