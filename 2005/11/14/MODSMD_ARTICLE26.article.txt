### WENDI GOH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Seven seniors departed the field tearfully Friday,
as Stanford women's soccer was knocked out of the
first round of the NCAA tournament in a 2-0 deci
sion to Saint Louis at Santa Clara University's Buck
Shaw Stadium.
The match kicked-off with the Billikens (16-4-0)
taking control early on. However, Stanford (10-7-3)
responded quickly, taking 11 first-half shots. As the
teams fought for control of the ball, Saint Louis
broke through in the 19th minute. Junior Dee Guem
pel recovered a loose ball on the left, and sent it over
the Cardinal defense to sophomore Cassi Winchell.
Winchell then tapped the ball back to senior Kelly
Ferguson, who rocked in the shot from 20 yards.
"I have to give Saint Louis a lot of credit," Cardi
nal head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "They scored a
great goal early against us.Then, we were chasing the
game, which is always difficult for us. I think psycho
logically, going down a goal in the first 20 minutes re
ally hurt us."
The goal, Ferguson's sixth game-winner of the
season, indeed marked a major turning point in the
match. Stanford had several chances in the closing
minutes of the first half but freshman defender Alli
son Falk's header went over the bar. In addition,
keeper Abby Goellner and the Billikens' defense de
nied attempts from junior Shari Summers and fresh
man Hilary Heath.
Despite the Cardinal's best efforts to find an
equalizer, conceding an early goal early proved too
much for the team to overcome, and Stanford contin
ued to struggle in the gamefs final third.
The Billikens delivered their finishing blow in the
63rd minute, when junior Maureen Hughes connect
ed on an insurance goal Freshman keeper Alex
Gamble stopped Hughes' first shot but the forward
fired the rebound inside the right post. While the
Cardinal continued pressing the Billikens. creating
six more shots in the second half, they were unable to
find a way past Goellner.
"The team played very hard," Ratcliffe said. "We
played with a lot of courage, but we were just unfor
tunate. We dominated most of the game with 21-7
shots, but we just couldn't finish our chances. I think
the team has had a very good season. We got good re
sults down the line and we got into the playoffs. I
think the only part that we're disappointed about is
losing in the first round. Other than that, the team
played really well."
