# Students teach mock trial skills to HS students
## 
### KAT LEWIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Close to 150 students from 12 local high
schools gathered on Saturday for the Stan
ford Mock Trial Team's fourth annual High
School Mock Trial Symposium. The event
is an outreach program during which team
members impart their knowledge to less
experienced high school mock trial teams,
according to Mock TVial Team Vice-Presi
dent John Fowler, a junior.
"We gather a big turn-out of high
schools," he said. "It's our biggest chance
to reach out to the community. A lot of
our time is spent on building our talents
over the year, so now we take those tal
ents and help those a few years behind
us."
The program, which was provided free
of charge to the attending high schools,
kicked off with a mini-trial to give stu
dents an idea of what a Mock Trial compe
tition looks like. From there, teams were
divided into groups and attended one
hour workshops on topics such as opening
statements and closing arguments, rules
of evidence, elements of the case, and di
rect and cross examinations.
The mini-trial was a new addition to
the event. In previous years, according to
Mock Trial President Brian Heckenlively,
a senior, the symposium has been run in

conjunction with the Stanford Pre-Law
Society and featured a keynote address in
the beginning of the program. However,
some members of the Mock Trial Team
said they felt that showing a sample trial is
a more effective hands-on approach.
"We didn't want to give a lecture, so we
put on a mini-trial," Fowler said. "For new
teams to walk into a trial is a scary thing.
We wanted inexperienced teams to see
the actual experience of a trial."
Many high school students who attend
ed the event said they enjoyed the trial.
Laura Wright, a junior at Ann Sobrato
High School in Morgan Hill, called it one
of her favorite parts of the symposium.
"I've never seen a trial before, and I
feel that helped us learn how to imitate
their team members and act appropriate
ly," Wright said.
The workshops were taught by mem
bers of the Stanford Mock Trial Team. Al
though in previous years each workshop
has been taught by a returning member
paired with a freshman, according to
event organizer sophomore Victoria
Degtyareva, who is also a Daily news edi
tor, an influx of freshman on the team this
year necessitated that the majority of the
workshop leaders were freshmen. Some
students in attendance, however, said this
did not create a problem.
"You can relate more to people closer

to your own age," said Los Altos High
School sophomore Tiffany Tsni. "It's a lot
more helpful than when attorneys come
to our school to help us out. You're not in
timidated by college students and their
presentations aren't as dry."
Some of the high school students ex
pressed gratitude for the Stanford Mock
Trial Team's willingness to help out. For
example, when senior Nolan Zandi from
Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill
missed the first workshop of the day, Stan
ford Mock Trial freshman James Barton
gave him and a teammate an impromptu
briefing on pre-trial evidence.
"This experience is really instructive,"
Zandi said. "It answered a lot of questions
I had that the Mock Trial manual doesn't
address. You just need someone who has
done it before. They're a very knowledge
able bunch."
Heckenlively said that he feels the
symposium is a learning experience not
just for the high school students, but also
for the Stanford Mock Trial members who
teach them.
"A lot of our members do enjoy doing
this and teaching what they learn," Heck
enlively said. "It helps the people on our
team who are younger to teach something
that we've just been teaching them—it
helps them learn it better and gives them
confidence."

Logistically, however, organizing the
different workshops required some jug
gling. The high schools that participate are
diversely ranked in terms of program size
and experience, according to Valicia
Saucedo, class of 2005, who helped organ
ize the event. Saucedo also said that some
of the teams participating will compete
against each other in future Mock Trial
tournaments, which makes them wary of
divulging too much information to one
another.
"It's become simplified," Saucedo said.
"We just try to get groups that make sense.
We have San Francisco County schools,
San Mateo County schools, Santa Clara
county schools—when you mix these to
gether you help bring students together
who wouldn't necessarily meet each other
otherwise. When you have small schools
and champion schools together, it gives
the small schools an idea of how successful
teams behave."
Many students and coaches attending
the symposium said they enjoyed the ex
perience. Live Oak High School coach
Michelle Vasquez, who has been with the
team for two years, said she saw the sym
posium as a good supplement to the work
she has done with her team.
"We're seeing other ideas, new per
spectives," Vasquez said. "We're definitely
going to come back next year."

divided into groups and attended one
hour workshops on topics such as opening
statements and closing arguments, rules
of evidence, elements of the case, and di
rect and cross examinations.
The mini-trial was a new addition to
the event. In previous years, according to
Mock Trial President Brian Heckenlively,
a senior, the symposium has been run in

conjunction with the Stanford Pre-Law
Society and featured a keynote address in
the beginning of the program. However,
some members of the Mock Trial Team
said they felt that showing a sample trial is
a more effective hands-on approach.
"We didn't want to give a lecture, so we
put on a mini-trial," Fowler said. "For new
teams to walk into a trial is a scary thing.
We wanted inexperienced teams to see
the actual experience of a trial."
Many high school students who attend
ed the event said they enjoyed the trial.
Laura Wright, a junior at Ann Sobrato
High School in Morgan Hill, called it one
of her favorite parts of the symposium.
"I've never seen a trial before, and I
feel that helped us learn how to imitate
their team members and act appropriate
ly," Wright said.
The workshops were taught by mem
bers of the Stanford Mock Trial Team. Al
though in previous years each workshop
has been taught by a returning member
paired with a freshman, according to
event organizer sophomore Victoria
Degtyareva, who is also a Daily news edi
tor, an influx of freshman on the team this
year necessitated that the majority of the
workshop leaders were freshmen. Some
students in attendance, however, said this
did not create a problem.
"You can relate more to people closer

to your own age," said Los Altos High
School sophomore Tiffany Tsni. "It's a lot
more helpful than when attorneys come
to our school to help us out. You're not in
timidated by college students and their
presentations aren't as dry."
Some of the high school students ex
pressed gratitude for the Stanford Mock
Trial Team's willingness to help out. For
example, when senior Nolan Zandi from
Live Oak High School in Morgan Hill
missed the first workshop of the day, Stan
ford Mock Trial freshman James Barton
gave him and a teammate an impromptu
briefing on pre-trial evidence.
"This experience is really instructive,"
Zandi said. "It answered a lot of questions
I had that the Mock Trial manual doesn't
address. You just need someone who has
done it before. They're a very knowledge
able bunch."
Heckenlively said that he feels the
symposium is a learning experience not
just for the high school students, but also
for the Stanford Mock Trial members who
teach them.
"A lot of our members do enjoy doing
this and teaching what they learn," Heck
enlively said. "It helps the people on our
team who are younger to teach something
that we've just been teaching them—it
helps them learn it better and gives them
confidence."

Logistically, however, organizing the
different workshops required some jug
gling. The high schools that participate are
diversely ranked in terms of program size
and experience, according to Valicia
Saucedo, class of 2005, who helped organ
ize the event. Saucedo also said that some
of the teams participating will compete
against each other in future Mock Trial
tournaments, which makes them wary of
divulging too much information to one
another.
"It's become simplified," Saucedo said.
"We just try to get groups that make sense.
We have San Francisco County schools,
San Mateo County schools, Santa Clara
county schools—when you mix these to
gether you help bring students together
who wouldn't necessarily meet each other
otherwise. When you have small schools
and champion schools together, it gives
the small schools an idea of how successful
teams behave."
Many students and coaches attending
the symposium said they enjoyed the ex
perience. Live Oak High School coach
Michelle Vasquez, who has been with the
team for two years, said she saw the sym
posium as a good supplement to the work
she has done with her team.
"We're seeing other ideas, new per
spectives," Vasquez said. "We're definitely
going to come back next year."

Team members Bryan Heckenlively and Amit Arora speak to the high school participants of the fourth annual Stanford Mock Trial High School Symposium.
Close to 150 students from 12 local high
schools gathered on Saturday for the Stan
ford Mock Trial Team's fourth annual High
School Mock Trial Symposium. The event
is an outreach program during which team
members impart their knowledge to less
experienced high school mock trial teams,
according to Mock TVial Team Vice-Presi
dent John Fowler, a junior.
"We gather a big turn-out of high
schools," he said. "It's our biggest chance
to reach out to the community. A lot of
our time is spent on building our talents
over the year, so now we take those tal
ents and help those a few years behind
us."
The program, which was provided free
of charge to the attending high schools,
kicked off with a mini-trial to give stu
dents an idea of what a Mock Trial compe
tition looks like. From there, teams were
divided into groups and attended one
hour workshops on topics such as opening
statements and closing arguments, rules
of evidence, elements of the case, and di
