### DIANNA BAI 
The 10th annual Asian-American issues confer
ence, "Listen to the Silence," (LTS) brought togeth
er Asian-American students and community ac
tivists from across the state this Saturday in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
Voicing this year's theme "Can't Stop, Won't
Stop: Sustaining the Asian-American Movement,"
speakers at the conference encouraged students to
organize and support each other in the movement
for social justice.
"Listen to the Silence" is about debunking a lot
of the stereotypes of Asian-Americans, but it's also
about how you as a student can get involved in the
work, because we as Asian-Americans have the
power to affect change in the community," said LTS
coordinator Linda Lee, a junior.
The conference offered 15 workshops address
ing topics ranging from queerness and homophobia
in the Asian-American community, to the shooting
deaths of two Korean men in Dublin, California, to
Hurricane Katrina's impact on Vietnamese-Amer
icans in New Orleans.
"These are issues that a lot of times people don't
talk or hear about so it's a good opportunity to be
educated about them," Lee said.
Many workshop attendees represented the
Asian-American organizations at Stanford and
other universities.
Senior Yinan Zhao, co-chair of the Undergradu
ate Chinese Students Association, commented on
the importance of being informed as Asian-Ameri
cans about such issues.
"After you leave Stanford, you might end up
being a doctor, lawyer, engineer and you might
switch between professions â€” but you'll always be
an Asian-American," he said. "That's indelible. So
whether or not you care about Asian-American is
sues, you'll always have to deal with them."
For other student leaders, LTS was an opportu
nity to learn about the issues and bring back ideas to

their own schools where the Asian-American com
munities are less vocal.
"1 feel that Asian Pacific Islanders are often la
beled as apolitical," said Jennifer Miyoshi, a senior
at UC-Santa Barbara and president of UCSB's
Japanese Nikkei Association. "It's hard for me to
find a place on my campus to be Asian and political,
so I feel like this conference is right on-point."
Peter Palath, another UC-Santa Barbara stu
dent, agreed that "the Asian American community
at UC-Santa Barbara is not very active," though
that has not stopped him from caring about related
issues, including the media's portrayal of Asian-
Americans.
The workshops also served as an intercollegiate
forum. In one small group session titled "Media
Representations of Asian-Americans," students
from Stanford. UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Davis and
the University of San Francisco debated the role of
Asians in American film and issues relating to the
Asian hip-hop culture.
Though the conference mainly focused on the
most recent and pertinent issues of the Asian-
American community, speakers also addressed his
torical discrimination against Asian Americans.

Cindy Ng, director of the Asian American Ac
tivities Center, spoke about the history of anti-im
migrant sentiments in the U.S., quoting as an ex
ample, Leland Stanford Sr.'s remarks against
Asian immigration during his time as governor of
California.
Kimi Lee, director of the Garment Workers'
Center in Los Angeles and this year's keynote
speaker, addressed the history of labor exploitation
in the United States.
Lee, whose own mother had worked at a gar
ment factory, told her personal story about becom
ing an advocate for worker's rights.
She encouraged students to become movement
role models for each other and emphasized that
every little bit counts.
"In terms of social justice, people shouldn't feel
like they have to do everything," Lee said. "You do
what you can."
To conclude "Listen to the Silence,' v Asian-
American hip-hop and spoken word artists Mush,
Magnetic North, Jocelyn de Leon, Native Guns and
Bao Phi performed at an evening concert.highlight
ing and illustrating many of the topics addressed
during the day with music and rhythm.
