# Thanksgiving dinner to be served on campus
## 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students staying on-campus for
Thanksgiving break can look for
ward to a feast thanks to the Grad
uate Student Council (GSC). On
Nov. 24, the GSC will present its
eighth annual Thanksgiving Din
ner. The GSC expects 1,500 stu
dents, faculty and staff members to
show up for a traditional roast
turkey dinner.
"Historically, large numbers of
graduate students — especially in
ternational graduate students —
have stayed on campus for the
Thanksgiving holiday, so providing
them with a Thanksgiving meal
seemed a logical extension of grad
uate student programming efforts,"
said second-year law student Jenny
Allen, co-chair of the GSC "This
year 1 will stay for Thanksgiving
break,and I appreciate the fact that
there is something special planned
for students like me to celebrate
with my Stanford family."
The celebration is budgeted at
$40,000, all of which was provided
by the Office of University Provost
John Etchemendy for the first time
in the event's eight-year history.
The event will be free to anyone
with a SUID.
It remains to be seen whether
the extended fall break this year
will affect turnout, since more stu
dents may be persuaded to fly
home for the holiday.
"We do not know [how the ex
tended holiday will affect turnout]
at this point," Allen said. "We are
obtaining RSVPs for the event and
will order food accordingly."
This year the menu will consist
of roast turkey and beef with cran

berry sauce and gravy, a choice of
side salads, a vegetarian entree, veg
etable stuffing, traditional veg
etable side dishes and pumpkin and
apple pie with cream. Traditional
hot apple cider will be served along
with other less traditional bever
ages.
The event is staffed entirely by
volunteers.
"In just a half day after being ad
vertised on the new "Grad An
nounce" newsletter, we have 15 vol
unteers," Allen said. "We still need
more helpers, but this response is a
wonderful, encouraging start."
People interested in volunteer
ing on Nov. 24 can contact the event
coordinator at
thanksgiving@gsc.stanford.edu or
simply choose from the available
times on their event registration
form.
There will also be a voluntary
canned food drive at the dinner.
Canned goods will be donated
to Second Harvest Food Bank of
Santa Clara and San Mateo Coun
ties — a non-profit organization
that collects and distributes food
every year to low-income children,
adults and seniors — according to
the event's Website.
"The event is coordinated on
behalf of the graduate student com
munity," Allen said. "However, we
welcome any student, staff or facul
ty member to join us for the
Thanksgiving celebration. '
The event sold out last year and
1,500 people attended.That level of in
terest is expected again with 750 peo
ple at both the 1 pm. and 4 p.m seat
ings. Interested parties are encour
aged to RS VP on the event Web site at
