## Stanford students safe in Paris Riots spark discussions with faculty members, host families 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
With Riots currently ravaging the northern
suburbs outside of Paris, there has been little to
no impact on the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) located in the sixth arrondisse
ment of the "isle de paris," or the center of the
city. There are currently 32 students participat
ing in the program, which has existed since 1991
as a major overseas program.
Those in Paris feel as though the American
media is exaggerating the extent to which the
chaos occurring in the suburbs has affected the city.
"The American media has portrayed the
riots as a huge social unrest, close to an apoca
lyptical breakdown, but the reality is much more
complex and diverse," said Assistant Professor
of French and Italian Cecile Alduy."Many cities,
and Paris in particular, have not been witness to
any riot. All the incidents are very localized,
which unfortunately means that the rioters are
destroying their own neighborhood and some
times burning their parents' cars or shops,
adding to the social problems of the cities."

These riots began in the end of October and
are confined primarily to poor, largely immi
grant communities with high unemployment.
Student participants in the program said they
feel removed from the violence on the outskirts
of the city.
"1 haven't been scared and still feel very safe
since the riots are not actually in the central city
of Paris where we all live and go to school," said
junior Saffronia Threatt, who first learned
about the riots when U.S.-based friends e
mailed her asking whether she was all right.
"It is a little unnerving to receive emails
from the U.S. Embassy advising you to stay
away from certain areas and avoid taking the
train to the airport," said junior TVacy White.
"While this is disconcerting, I have found the
situation to feel quite distant. It is odd that I am
probably about a half an hour by train from the
affected area, yet I feel like it is a world away."
Junior Jenn Jones said she also believes
there is no point in being scared because the
students are not directly affected by the riots.
"It feels like we are just as far away from the
riots as you are," Jones said. "We read about
them in the papers; we read about them online;
we watch the news. As far as I know, no one has
actually seen any violence."
The students in the Stanford in
Paris program are continuing to take
courses; their only connection with
the riots to date has been classroom
discussions of the current events.
"Every day we discuss the new
developments within the riots and
the French government," said junior
Yesenia Castro. "It becomes even
more controversial and interesting
when you realize that your French
professors differ in their opinions
and thoughts concerning the riots.
You come out of one class with a lib
eral interpretation and an hour later
in your second class you're hearing a
slightly more conservative view."
Since the program has not been
impacted by the riots, there have not
been and likely will not be any
changes to it.
"The events will no doubt create a
heightened interest on the part of
students to study and do research on
questions of immigration, integration
and unemployment in France," said
Estelle Halevi, director of the Stan
ford Center in Paris since 1989. "The
riots will inevitably have an impact

on the political and social questions
the government will address in the
next few months, and I am sure this
will solicit considerable debate
among the students attending the
program."
Many of the students mentioned
that it has been interesting to witness
history in the making.
"Watching the political situation
in France firsthand makes what you
learn in the classroom that much
more immediate and intense and re
ally helps you to understand how the
French suburban citizens feel and
the plight they face," said junior
Emily Gische. "I'm witnessing histo
ry here in France and gaining a much
deeper and more significant under
standing of a different culture and its
social and political problems."
Junior Robin Lee noted that the
current violence in France is a popu
lar topic of conversation.
"The riots are always on our
minds, and it's a very interesting time
to be in Paris," Lee said."We read the
newspapers and talk to our host fam
ilies and French friends about it. Lis
tening to their opinions and watch
ing the government react is a really
unique experience for all of us."
Junior Natalie Guido-Estrada
stated that she is hearing more about
the riots from friends and family in
the United States than in Paris.

"It's interesting to have this posi
tion and insight on an international
event and to see what's really going
on in Paris versus what the news tells
you." she said.
Like many of his classmates, jun
ior Zachary Gianos has not modified
his behavior as a result of the riots.
"I'm not worried." Gianos said. "I
heard that the French government
would instiute martial law if the vio
lence came into the city. Paris is a
world icon. They wouldn't let any
thing happen to it."
Some of the students studying
abroad planned to attend a soccer
game this past weekend in a location
where there has been rioting.
"We are all going together and
aren't too worried," Guido-Estrada
said. "I think the rioting is sad and
unfortunate and definitely danger
ous for some, but it seems to me that
the U.S. media is holding to its repu
tation of exaggeration."
Several students noted that their
host families are equally uninflu
enced by the events.
"My host family seems totally un
concerned about the situation," Jones
said. "My host father and mother basi
cally laughed in my face when I sug
gested that the rioters could come into
Paris and disrupt things here.They just
see the riots as part of the cyclical vio
lence that sometimes happens in the

suburbs."
Threatt noted that the riots do not
seem to be "a concern to the French
even though this has supposedly
been the biggest outbreak of vio
lence in Paris in 40 years."
Castro stated that it is interesting
for her to discuss the riots and politi
cal instability with her host family.
"It is interesting to hear their side
of the story," Castro said. "Being
from Los Angeles has allowed me to
draw many parallels to social prob
lems back at home with the current
events here in France. For me this so
cial instability is nothing new."
Students acknowledged that fam
ily and friends have been e-mailing
and calling them regularly out of
concern for their safety.
"My mom, a typical worrywart, is
scared, but there is little reason for
her to be," Jones said. "Most people
just hear the word riot and think
we're in the middle of street vio
lence, fighting our way to get our
daily baguette or something, which is
totally not the case."

Director of BOSP Norman
Naimark said that his office is close
ly following the events in Paris.
"Our communications have indi
cated that the students are complete
ly safe, though the BOSP administra
tion is following the situation very
carefully," Naimark said. "I also
think it is important that these dra
matic and sad events become a learn
ing experience for our students, as
well. I think there are some special
programs planned that will help the
students understand what is going on
around them."
All of the students interviewed
stated that they have felt safe while
participating in the program.
"The staff of the Stanford program
here in Paris has been doing a great
job of making us feel safe and reassur
ing us that everything is, and will be,
fine," Threatt said. "They are avail
able for us to contact at any time, and
they have several ways of contacting
each of the students here in case there
was an emergency or anything
changed that we would have to know

about."
According to Halevi, a phone tree
is in place that will allow staff to con
tact students rapidly on their cell
phones in case of emergency.
"On campus, we are particularly vig
ilant for the safety of our students, and
check news throughout the day to make
sure that no violence has occurred in
areas where students live," she said.
"Some of our students are doing volun
teer work with children outside the city
limits. We have asked them to phone the
person respoasible for the association
every day before going to make sure the
area has not been affected."
As a native Parisian and Stanford
faculty member in residence in Paris.
Alduy is concerned as well as out
raged by the lack of political response
to the situation.
"Americans have to be aware that
the measures announced by the gov
ernment are not addressing in any
way the core of the problem, which is
a sense of social, economical, and at
times radical discrimination and ex
clusion," Alduy said."
