## Stanford students safe in Paris Riots spark discussions with faculty members, host families 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
With Riots currently ravaging the northern
suburbs outside of Paris, there has been little to
no impact on the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram (BOSP) located in the sixth arrondisse
ment of the "isle de paris," or the center of the
city. There are currently 32 students participat
ing in the program, which has existed since 1991
as a major overseas program.
Those in Paris feel as though the American
media is exaggerating the extent to which the
chaos occurring in the suburbs has affected the city.
"The American media has portrayed the
riots as a huge social unrest, close to an apoca
lyptical breakdown, but the reality is much more
complex and diverse," said Assistant Professor
of French and Italian Cecile Alduy."Many cities,
and Paris in particular, have not been witness to

which unfortunately means that the rioters are
destroying their own neighborhood and some
times burning their parents' cars or shops,

These riots began in the end of October and
are confined primarily to poor, largely immi

Student participants in the program said they

of the city.
"1 haven't been scared and still feel very safe
since the riots are not actually in the central city
of Paris where we all live and go to school," said
junior Saffronia Threatt, who first learned
about the riots when U.S.-based friends e
mailed her asking whether she was all right.
"It is a little unnerving to receive emails
from the U.S. Embassy advising you to stay
away from certain areas and avoid taking the
train to the airport," said junior TVacy White.
"While this is disconcerting, I have found the
situation to feel quite distant. It is odd that I am
probably about a half an hour by train from the
affected area, yet I feel like it is a world away."
Junior Jenn Jones said she also believes
there is no point in being scared because the
students are not directly affected by the riots.
"It feels like we are just as far away from the
riots as you are," Jones said. "We read about
them in the papers; we read about them online;
we watch the news. As far as I know, no one has
