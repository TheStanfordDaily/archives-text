# Stanford Medical Center purchases buildings in Redwood City
## 360,000 square-feet will be added to the Medical Center 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
Within the next couple of years, Stanford
Hospital and Clinics will become much closer
to its Redwood City neighbor. Having recent
ly purchased four buildings totaling 360,000
square-feet of new space, the hospital will be
providing outpatient services in orthopedics,
ophthalmology, radiology and other primary
care services.
"These buildings are going to allow a huge

expansion of Stanford Medical Center," Said
General Internal Medicine Prof. Paul Ford in
an interview with The Daily."This will result
in nearly tripling the space for ambulatory
services, allowing the creation of an orthope
dic treatment center and allow Stanford
Medical Center to meet the needs of our pa
tients and researchers alike."
This purchase preceded the University's
latest purchase of eight buildings in Redwood
City's Mid-Point Technology Park. According
to Larry Carr, the director of government re
lations at the Stanford Hospital, these two
transactions are completely separate.
"While the University is the sole corpo
rate owner, the Stanford Hospital has its own

Chief Executive Office and budget," Carr
said in an interview with The Daily."The hos
pital recently bought a portion of these build
ings as a completely separate real estate
transaction. The University and the Hospital
maintain close communication. We both
know what the other is doing in terms of busi
ness management."
The outpatient services are expected to
open their doors in late 2007. Now, the pri
mary focus is in obtaining full ownership of
these buildings.
"Right now, we are working with the Red
wood City government to obtain entitle
ments, which allow us to use the buildings
however we choose — in this case, as outpa

tient facilities," Carr said.
Stanford Hospital already has an offer on
the table, which the owner is currently re
viewing. This period is expected to close be
fore the end of the year. At that point, the
focus will shift to planning and building.
According to Carr, there have been issues
with space in the past. Talks of possible con
struction and upgrades have come up due to
growth issues. Clinics are always in need of
more space, since services and technology are
constantly being developed.
This move is the first time the hospital will
provide off-site care. Those involved with the
relocation feel it will serve to benefit Red
wood City and other Bay Area community

members.
"Today, we are seeing a new wave of
health care. More services and more outpa
tient care are needed in communities," Carr
said. "This provides much more accessibility
to patients who are not as close to the Stan
ford campus. Furthermore, it provides the
hospital with an opportunity to expand in
areas other than space. We will have the abil
ity to use new technology and new services
for our patients."
Carr said that the Stanford Hospital is ex
cited to participate in a new community.
"Redwood City is a great location and a
great community. We look forward to work
ing with them in the future," he said.
