For the first three minutes, Stanford's Satur
day visit to Oregon State mirrored last week's
51-21 drubbing at the hands of Southern Cali
fornia. Much like USC a week ago, the Beavers
received the opening kick and marched down
the field to take an early 7-0 lead.
But the similarities ended there.This time,
the Cardinal (5-4,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
rebounded, grabbed a first half lead and held

on for a dramatic 20-17 victory over the
Beavers (5-5, 3-4) in front of a Reser Stadi
um-record 42,%0.
Despite the slow start, Stanford's defen
sive unit sealed the victory, stopping Oregon
State on a final wild drive.
After a Cardinal punt, the Beavers, down
by three, received the ball at their 26 with
2:54 remaining. After senior nose tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo's sack pushed Oregon
State into a third-and-16. Beaver backup
quarterback Ryan Gunderson threw deep for
receiver Justin Wheat-Brown.The ball tipped
up off the hands of Wheat-Brown and landed
squarely into the hands of tight end Dan
Haines for a 37-yard reception.

Safety Sabby Piscitelli can't bear to watch as senior receiver Justin McCullum knots the game 7-7 with a first-quarter three-yard touchdown catch.
