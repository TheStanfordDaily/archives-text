For the first three minutes, Stanford's Satur
day visit to Oregon State mirrored last week's
51-21 drubbing at the hands of Southern Cali
fornia. Much like USC a week ago, the Beavers
received the opening kick and marched down
the field to take an early 7-0 lead.
But the similarities ended there.This time,
the Cardinal (5-4,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
rebounded, grabbed a first half lead and held

on for a dramatic 20-17 victory over the
Beavers (5-5, 3-4) in front of a Reser Stadi
um-record 42,%0.
Despite the slow start, Stanford's defen
sive unit sealed the victory, stopping Oregon
State on a final wild drive.
After a Cardinal punt, the Beavers, down
by three, received the ball at their 26 with
2:54 remaining. After senior nose tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo's sack pushed Oregon
State into a third-and-16. Beaver backup
quarterback Ryan Gunderson threw deep for
receiver Justin Wheat-Brown.The ball tipped
up off the hands of Wheat-Brown and landed
squarely into the hands of tight end Dan
Haines for a 37-yard reception.

Safety Sabby Piscitelli can't bear to watch as senior receiver Justin McCullum knots the game 7-7 with a first-quarter three-yard touchdown catch.
Defense overcomes
turnovers, Edwards' hand injury

"We've had a lot of guys beat up, a
lot of guys limping, a lot of young
guys going in to play, and then, lo and
behold, the tipped ball — you ask
the Lord 'Why? Why now?'" said
head coach Walt Harris, shaking his
fists in frustration.
However, following the tipped
catch, Stanford's defense held strong,
as junior linebacker Udeme Udofia
stuffed tailback Yvenson Bernard for
a six-yard loss. The Cardinal defense
eventually forced Oregon State into a
52-yard field goal attempt, and place
kicker Alexis Serna's boot, though
dead-center, landed short.
"We fought way too hard to let
them come back and score that late
in the game," senior cornerback T.J.
Rushing said. "We work on finishing
hard with Coach Harris, and we
pulled it out."
Serna, who had made 15 straight
field goals entering the contest,
missed three on the rainy afternoon,
from 44.37 and 52 yards.
The Beavers committed plenty of
mistakes beyond Serna's misfires.
OSU was flagged for 11 penalties for
123 yards against Stanford. Many of
the calls were for personal fouls that
helped keep several Stanford drives
alive.
Senior receiver Mike Hass, the
Beavers' top playmaker who leads
the NCAA in receiving yards per
game, gained 140 yards on six catch
es, though much of the yardage came
on the Beavers' opening drive. Stan
ford similarly tightened against
Bernard, who gained only 81 ground
yards despite coming into the game
sixth in the nation with 123.6 yards
per contest.
While Stanford's defense shone,
the offense struggled. Much of the
difficulty came in the second half,
after junior quarterback Trent Ed
wards left the contest due to a left

'Why? Why now?'

(non-throwing) hand injury and was
replaced by junior T.C. Ostrander.
Edwards' status for next week's
Big Game has yet to be announced,
and while the Los Gatos, Calif, native
stated post-game that his hand was
neither broken nor fractured. Harris
is no more than guardedly optimistic
on whether Edwards will receive his
first career start against California.
"We'll have to wait and see," Har
ris said. "I think if the game tonight
had lasted longer, he probably could
have gone back in and played, but I
don't know that for sure. What I
know about Trent is that if there is
any way he can be cleared, he'll play."
Junior fullback Nick Frank, offen
sive lineman Allen Smith and junior
receiver Mark Bradford each also
missed portions of the contest due to
injuries.
In nearly three quarters of work.
Edwards threw for 1% yards, two
touchdowns and two interceptions,
one of which defensive end Jeff Van
Orsow returned for a Beaver score.
Stanford committed three turnovers
while forcing just one on the contest.
"[Turnovers! killed us, honestly,"
Harris said. "We have preached it,
taught it and done a pretty good job
with it, but when you throw one and
they return it for a touchdown, that's
obviously pretty devastating."
Edwards had company following
his early exit. Oregon State starting

quarterback Matt Moore left the
game on the Beaver's first drive of the
second quarter due to a knee injury.
For the Cardinal, senior receiver
Justin McCullum exceeded outside
expectations for the second straight
week. McCullum was Edwards' main
target, reeling in 119 yards and two
scores on seven catches.
The win was Stanford's fifth of the
season. Before Saturday's victory,
the Cardinal had lost 10 straight
games when faced with a chance at a
fifth victory.
"You've got to give a tremendous
amount of credit to our players,"
Harris said. "They've hung in there
through some tough times. But be
cause we putin so much before this
game and because of all the frustra
tions that these guys have gone
through being stuck on four wins, it
all came out."
The win sets up one of the most
important Big Games in recent
memory With five wins, Stanford
needs just one more victory in its re
maining two games to clinch a bowl
berth. No. 6 Notre Dame (7-2) visits
in the season-finale, so unranked Cal
(6-4,3-4) appears the best opportuni
ty to earn that sixth win.
"This will be the greatest Big
Game for me," senior defensive end
Julian Jenkins said. "Big Game
means so much more now. This is the
biggest Big Game. Ever."
