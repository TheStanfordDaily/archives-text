### AMIT ARORA 
"The California special election was a huge defeat for the gov
ernor; make no mistake about it," noted U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo
(District 14). "It is significant in politics when you, as a politician,
have lost your luster."
Eshoo. along with Hoover Senior Fellow David Brady and San
Jose Mercury News political reporter Phil Yost, sat on a panel of
speakers for a discussion regarding the significance of the recent
election last Friday. Sponsored by the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West, the event investigated the po
litical ramifications of the eight defeated initiatives and then ef
fect on direct democracy in the state.
From a statistical standpoint, the speakers linked the failure of
the propositions to increased Democrat activity in the days before
the election.
"As the election got closer, the Democrats were energized in
terms of voting." Brady said. "Our own statistical polling was se
verely affected by this late surge."
Eshoo explained the shift in voting with the governor's politi
cal activities in the last few days.
"I think Californians, most frankly, were disgusted," she said.
