## Panel dissects failed initiatives 
### AMIT ARORA 
"The California special election was a huge defeat for the gov
ernor; make no mistake about it," noted U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo
(District 14). "It is significant in politics when you, as a politician,
have lost your luster."
Eshoo. along with Hoover Senior Fellow David Brady and San
Jose Mercury News political reporter Phil Yost, sat on a panel of
speakers for a discussion regarding the significance of the recent
election last Friday. Sponsored by the Bill Lane Center for the
Study of the North American West, the event investigated the po
litical ramifications of the eight defeated initiatives and then ef
fect on direct democracy in the state.
From a statistical standpoint, the speakers linked the failure of
the propositions to increased Democrat activity in the days before
the election.
"As the election got closer, the Democrats were energized in
terms of voting." Brady said. "Our own statistical polling was se
verely affected by this late surge."
Eshoo explained the shift in voting with the governor's politi
cal activities in the last few days.
"I think Californians, most frankly, were disgusted," she said.

"The more Schwarzenegger pushed for the initiatives,
the more people were repulsed at the propositions."
Spending played a significant role in voter reaction
as well. Administrative costs for the special election, the
speakers noted, would likely exceed $50 million. With
state budget concerns, the panelists contended that
many Californians disagreed with the decision to host
an off-year election.
The governor's focus on public employees during
the year, Yost asserted, contributed to the defeat of the
initiatives.
"Last fall, Schwarzenegger attempted through exec
utive order, to revoke a law regarding the number of
nurses in the emergency room, alienating the nurses'
union," he said. "The governor then outraged unions
with his proposed reforms of public union pension
plans. Prop. 75 has further exacerbated that relationship
between unions and the governor."
The speakers cited a number of political mistakes
that Schwarzenegger made during the election, most
notably supporting four different propositions.
"There were people in the governor's administra
tion that asked him to choose one or two initiatives and
he did not listen," Brady said. "Now he is just another
politician; he is no longer the superstar who is going to
save the state."
The speakers also asserted that the governor failed
to appeal to moderates in California.
"The declined-to-state voters are the gold voters in
California," Eshoo noted. "The governor made a signif
icant tactical error in serving the right wing and not
these voters in the election."
With Schwarzenegger's re-election bid in 2006, the
speakers spoke of the long-term significance of these
results. Schwarzenegger relied on the support of a num
ber of minority groups in California during the recall
election, and many individuals in minority communities
believe that the proposed initiatives were detrimental
to their interests.The panelists contended that the Gov
ernor would have to considerably alter his image before
the 2006 election.
The speakers highlighted the necessity for certain
reforms in California state politics as well. Brady dis
cussed the inadequacies in the current nomination sys
tem for political candidates.
"The primary elections are characterized by low
voter-turnout," he said. "The candidates consequently
reflect the positions of the extreme left or the extreme
right, while Californians are generally more moderate
on the issues."
The failure of all eight propositions, the panelists ar
gued, was also significant to the use of the initiative
process in the state.
"The initiative process is something that needs to be
discussed with people," Brady said. "It has to be debat
ed and it has to be a last resort. The election results re
flected that."
