AMMAN. Jordan (AP) — Abu Musah al-
Zarqawi is on the move, or at least that 's the mes
sage he wants to send.
With Wednesday's attacks in his birthplace of
Jordan, the al-Qaida in Iraq chief signaled he has
the capacity and desire to export his suicide
bombing campaign outside Iraq's borders.
Now. many in the already volatile Middle East
worry his stated goals of toppling pro-American
Arab rulers, erecting an Islamic caliphate and
targeting Israel may be gaining momentum.
His threat is not new to the region, but the
three fiery hotel blasts that killed 57 people in
one of the Mideast's most secure cities sparked
instant calls for regional and international efforts
to fight terror.
Officials in Iraq, where al-Zarqawi's bloody
campaign is known all too well, repeated warn
ings that terrorism will only keep spreading in
the Mideast, unless countries work harder to
help Iraq end its raging insurgency.
Iraqi Defense Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi
warned Arab states that "if the Iraqi volcano ex
plodes, no neighboring capital will be saved."
"I told the world and neighboring countries
Don't make Iraq a hub for terrorism,"' he said in
Amman on Sunday.
Most regional analysts and officials say they
believe the U.S.-led war in Iraq has in fact creat
ed and worsened —not stamped out —a breed
ing ground for terrorism.
"Al-Zarqawi has proved a very fundamental
point, that the Americans can't control al-Qaida
in Iraq," said Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi senior secu
rity analyst with the Dubai-based Gulf Research
Center." Iraq is no longer a magnet attracting ter
rorism, but it is now exporting terrorist forces."
In Iraq itself, violence continues despite re

peated large-scale operations to try to wipe out
terror strongholds. And the insurgency shows a
level of resilience and even a spare capacity to
send forces abroad.
"It's like a franchise operation. You have sec
ond-generation jihadist groups all across the
world," Sen, Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said Sunday.
The threat that al-Zarqawi will set up terror fronts

beyond Iraq's borders is "extremely serious."
Significantly, al-Zarqawi demonstrated with
the Amman attacks that he has at least some
Iraqis, and not just foreign fighters, on his side.
The three suicide bombers who died in the
Grand Hyatt. Radisson SAS and Days Inn at
tacks were Iraqis, as was the wife of one of the
men, who failed in her attempt to blow herself up

and was arrested Sunday.
Some, however, cast doubt on whether al-Zar
qawi had the ability to wage a wider war and
whether the Amman attacks were a sign of worse
to come.
"One event does not mark a trend, and Jor
danian security repeatedly blocked prior attack
attempts," said Anthony Cordesman, a military
analyst at the Center for Strategic and Interna
tional Studies in Washington."It is also impor
tant to note that it is far from clear that al-Zar
qawi has a broad network."
Some speculate that Sunday's capture of 35-
year-old Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi, the
suicide bomber's wife and the sister of a slain al-
Zarqawi lieutenant in Anbar, may motivate al-
Qaida to launch fresh attacks here.
But al-Zarqawi has plenty of reasons to seek
new battlegrounds here and further field.
The 38-year-old militant holds a special
grudge against U.S.-allied Jordan, which has
handed down several death sentences against
him for terror crimes, such as the 2(M)2 slaying of
an American diplomat.
There is also Jordan's moderate brand of
Islam —at odds with al-Zarqawi's hard-line
Salafist Sunni Muslim approach — and Jordan's
1994 peace treaty with Israel.
Jordan also jailed him for several years for
terror-related crimes before letting him leave in
1999 to Afghanistan.
There, al-Zarqawi trained in explosives,
searched for somewhere to stamp his own brand
of terror and—after slipping through Iran — en
tered northern Iraq before the 2(X)3 U.S.-led in
vasion to topple Saddam Hussein.
While his commitment to waging his terror
campaign in Iraq seemed unparalleled, Iraq may
in the end prove just the beginning, says Alani.
"Al-Zarqawi is competing with the al-Qaida
headquarters," he said.

5 Rent difficulties plague
hurricane evacuees;
FEM A says help on way
WASHINGTON*AP)—OnIy $114 a month stands
between Shawn Williams, a Hurricane Katrina evac
uee, and eviction from her temporary apartment in
suburban Houston.
Williams can afford to pay out of her own pocket
and is willing to do so to make up the difference be
tween the $633 voucher she gets in federal housing aid
and the apartment's $747 rent. But a bureaucratic
snag prevents her from closing the gap on her own.
Now, after paying the entire rent herself for months
because the landlord cannot accept the voucher,
Williams says she is running out of money and fears
losing the two-bedroom apartment where she has
lived with her disabled husband since Katrina.

JERUSALEM (AP) —Secretary of State Con

Sunday to the renewed hardline Islamic leader
ship of Iran, saying that "no civilized nation" can
call for the annihilation of another.
Rice was referring to Iranian President Mah
moud Ahmadinejad's remark last month that Is
rael is a "disgraceful blot" that should be "wiped
off the map." Her words drew applause from
politicians, diplomats and others gathered for a
U.S.-Israeli symposium.
"No civilized nation should have a leader who
wishes ... another country should be pushed into
the sea," Rice said, speaking slowly and sternly.

PARIS (AP) — France's national police chief said
Sunday that the country's worst rioting since the 1960s
seemed to be nearing an end, but violence persisted into
the night, with at least two schools set on fire and dozens
of cars torched.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Bar
roso proposed that the European Union give $58 mil
lion to France for helping riot-hit towns recover. He said
the EU could make up to $ 1.2 billion available in longer
term support.
In scattered attacks overnight into Monday, vandals
rammed a car into a primary school in the southern city
of Toulouse before setting the building on fire. In north
ern France, arsonists set fire to a sports center.

Zarqawi is on the move, or at least that 's the mes
sage he wants to send.
With Wednesday's attacks in his birthplace of
Jordan, the al-Qaida in Iraq chief signaled he has
the capacity and desire to export his suicide
bombing campaign outside Iraq's borders.
Now. many in the already volatile Middle East
worry his stated goals of toppling pro-American
Arab rulers, erecting an Islamic caliphate and
targeting Israel may be gaining momentum.
His threat is not new to the region, but the
three fiery hotel blasts that killed 57 people in
one of the Mideast's most secure cities sparked
instant calls for regional and international efforts
to fight terror.
Officials in Iraq, where al-Zarqawi's bloody
campaign is known all too well, repeated warn
ings that terrorism will only keep spreading in
the Mideast, unless countries work harder to
help Iraq end its raging insurgency.
Iraqi Defense Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi
warned Arab states that "if the Iraqi volcano ex
plodes, no neighboring capital will be saved."
"I told the world and neighboring countries
Don't make Iraq a hub for terrorism,"' he said in
Amman on Sunday.
Most regional analysts and officials say they
believe the U.S.-led war in Iraq has in fact creat
ed and worsened —not stamped out —a breed
ing ground for terrorism.
"Al-Zarqawi has proved a very fundamental
point, that the Americans can't control al-Qaida
in Iraq," said Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi senior secu
rity analyst with the Dubai-based Gulf Research
Center." Iraq is no longer a magnet attracting ter
rorism, but it is now exporting terrorist forces."
In Iraq itself, violence continues despite re

peated large-scale operations to try to wipe out
terror strongholds. And the insurgency shows a
level of resilience and even a spare capacity to
send forces abroad.
"It's like a franchise operation. You have sec
ond-generation jihadist groups all across the
world," Sen, Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said Sunday.
The threat that al-Zarqawi will set up terror fronts

beyond Iraq's borders is "extremely serious."
Significantly, al-Zarqawi demonstrated with
the Amman attacks that he has at least some
Iraqis, and not just foreign fighters, on his side.
The three suicide bombers who died in the
Grand Hyatt. Radisson SAS and Days Inn at
tacks were Iraqis, as was the wife of one of the
men, who failed in her attempt to blow herself up

and was arrested Sunday.
Some, however, cast doubt on whether al-Zar
qawi had the ability to wage a wider war and
whether the Amman attacks were a sign of worse
to come.
"One event does not mark a trend, and Jor
danian security repeatedly blocked prior attack
attempts," said Anthony Cordesman, a military
analyst at the Center for Strategic and Interna
tional Studies in Washington."It is also impor
tant to note that it is far from clear that al-Zar
qawi has a broad network."
Some speculate that Sunday's capture of 35-
year-old Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi, the
suicide bomber's wife and the sister of a slain al-
Zarqawi lieutenant in Anbar, may motivate al-
Qaida to launch fresh attacks here.
But al-Zarqawi has plenty of reasons to seek
new battlegrounds here and further field.
The 38-year-old militant holds a special
grudge against U.S.-allied Jordan, which has
handed down several death sentences against
him for terror crimes, such as the 2(M)2 slaying of
an American diplomat.
There is also Jordan's moderate brand of
Islam —at odds with al-Zarqawi's hard-line
Salafist Sunni Muslim approach — and Jordan's
1994 peace treaty with Israel.
Jordan also jailed him for several years for
terror-related crimes before letting him leave in
1999 to Afghanistan.
There, al-Zarqawi trained in explosives,
searched for somewhere to stamp his own brand
of terror and—after slipping through Iran — en
tered northern Iraq before the 2(X)3 U.S.-led in
vasion to topple Saddam Hussein.
While his commitment to waging his terror
campaign in Iraq seemed unparalleled, Iraq may
in the end prove just the beginning, says Alani.
"Al-Zarqawi is competing with the al-Qaida
headquarters," he said.

5 Rent difficulties plague
hurricane evacuees;
FEM A says help on way
WASHINGTON*AP)—OnIy $114 a month stands
between Shawn Williams, a Hurricane Katrina evac
uee, and eviction from her temporary apartment in
suburban Houston.
Williams can afford to pay out of her own pocket
and is willing to do so to make up the difference be
tween the $633 voucher she gets in federal housing aid
and the apartment's $747 rent. But a bureaucratic
snag prevents her from closing the gap on her own.
Now, after paying the entire rent herself for months
because the landlord cannot accept the voucher,
Williams says she is running out of money and fears
losing the two-bedroom apartment where she has
lived with her disabled husband since Katrina.

bombing campaign outside Iraq's borders.
Now. many in the already volatile Middle East
worry his stated goals of toppling pro-American
Arab rulers, erecting an Islamic caliphate and
targeting Israel may be gaining momentum.
His threat is not new to the region, but the
three fiery hotel blasts that killed 57 people in
one of the Mideast's most secure cities sparked
instant calls for regional and international efforts
to fight terror.
Officials in Iraq, where al-Zarqawi's bloody
campaign is known all too well, repeated warn
ings that terrorism will only keep spreading in
the Mideast, unless countries work harder to
help Iraq end its raging insurgency.
Iraqi Defense Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi
warned Arab states that "if the Iraqi volcano ex
plodes, no neighboring capital will be saved."
"I told the world and neighboring countries
Don't make Iraq a hub for terrorism,"' he said in
Amman on Sunday.
Most regional analysts and officials say they
believe the U.S.-led war in Iraq has in fact creat
ed and worsened —not stamped out —a breed
ing ground for terrorism.
"Al-Zarqawi has proved a very fundamental
point, that the Americans can't control al-Qaida
in Iraq," said Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi senior secu
rity analyst with the Dubai-based Gulf Research
Center." Iraq is no longer a magnet attracting ter
rorism, but it is now exporting terrorist forces."
In Iraq itself, violence continues despite re

peated large-scale operations to try to wipe out
terror strongholds. And the insurgency shows a
level of resilience and even a spare capacity to
send forces abroad.
"It's like a franchise operation. You have sec
ond-generation jihadist groups all across the
world," Sen, Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said Sunday.
The threat that al-Zarqawi will set up terror fronts

beyond Iraq's borders is "extremely serious."
Significantly, al-Zarqawi demonstrated with
the Amman attacks that he has at least some
Iraqis, and not just foreign fighters, on his side.
The three suicide bombers who died in the
Grand Hyatt. Radisson SAS and Days Inn at
tacks were Iraqis, as was the wife of one of the
men, who failed in her attempt to blow herself up

and was arrested Sunday.
Some, however, cast doubt on whether al-Zar
qawi had the ability to wage a wider war and
whether the Amman attacks were a sign of worse
to come.
"One event does not mark a trend, and Jor
danian security repeatedly blocked prior attack
attempts," said Anthony Cordesman, a military
analyst at the Center for Strategic and Interna
tional Studies in Washington."It is also impor
tant to note that it is far from clear that al-Zar
qawi has a broad network."
Some speculate that Sunday's capture of 35-
year-old Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi, the
suicide bomber's wife and the sister of a slain al-
Zarqawi lieutenant in Anbar, may motivate al-
Qaida to launch fresh attacks here.
But al-Zarqawi has plenty of reasons to seek
new battlegrounds here and further field.
The 38-year-old militant holds a special
grudge against U.S.-allied Jordan, which has
handed down several death sentences against
him for terror crimes, such as the 2(M)2 slaying of
an American diplomat.
There is also Jordan's moderate brand of
Islam —at odds with al-Zarqawi's hard-line
Salafist Sunni Muslim approach — and Jordan's
1994 peace treaty with Israel.
Jordan also jailed him for several years for
terror-related crimes before letting him leave in
1999 to Afghanistan.
There, al-Zarqawi trained in explosives,
searched for somewhere to stamp his own brand
of terror and—after slipping through Iran — en
tered northern Iraq before the 2(X)3 U.S.-led in
vasion to topple Saddam Hussein.
While his commitment to waging his terror
campaign in Iraq seemed unparalleled, Iraq may
in the end prove just the beginning, says Alani.
"Al-Zarqawi is competing with the al-Qaida
headquarters," he said.

5 Rent difficulties plague
hurricane evacuees;
FEM A says help on way
WASHINGTON*AP)—OnIy $114 a month stands
between Shawn Williams, a Hurricane Katrina evac
uee, and eviction from her temporary apartment in
suburban Houston.
Williams can afford to pay out of her own pocket
and is willing to do so to make up the difference be
tween the $633 voucher she gets in federal housing aid
and the apartment's $747 rent. But a bureaucratic
snag prevents her from closing the gap on her own.
Now, after paying the entire rent herself for months
because the landlord cannot accept the voucher,
Williams says she is running out of money and fears
losing the two-bedroom apartment where she has
lived with her disabled husband since Katrina.

U.S. diplomat rebukes
Iranian leader over
Israel remarks
JERUSALEM (AP) —Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice gave her strongest rebuke yet on
Sunday to the renewed hardline Islamic leader
ship of Iran, saying that "no civilized nation" can
call for the annihilation of another.
Rice was referring to Iranian President Mah
moud Ahmadinejad's remark last month that Is
rael is a "disgraceful blot" that should be "wiped
off the map." Her words drew applause from
politicians, diplomats and others gathered for a
U.S.-Israeli symposium.
"No civilized nation should have a leader who
wishes ... another country should be pushed into
the sea," Rice said, speaking slowly and sternly.
