## Senior Pub Night: God's Gift to Singles 
### 
Pub Night is the highlight of the week
for any Stanford senior. In fact, the
event is so monumental that my
friends and I have started referring to
Thursday simply as "Pub Night" and every
other day of the week as "Not Pub Night."
"When are you free for dinner?" one of
my friends will ask.
"Not Pub Night," I'll answer, meaning
TUesday.
Pub Night, despite the slightly mislead
ing name, does not actually occur in a pub
per se.This is due to the fact that there are
no actual pubs in Palo Alto, because the
locals feel that such lowbrow establish
ments might attract vagrants and crimi
nals or possibly students.
No, Pub Nights occur in a variety of
places with names like "Nola's" or "Blue
Chalk" or "The Parsimonious Herring."
Drinks cost approximately $500 a pop, or
$679 if you want the drink served in a glass
instead of poured into your cupped hands.
While some people fund their Pub Nights
by auctioning their spleens on eßay, most
seniors resort to swigging nail polish re
mover on the bus ride over in order to
maintain an appropriate level of intoxica
tion.
A sober Pub Night, so the saying goes,
is a Pub Night destined to end in failure.
The event is one in which students are ac
tually supposed to do frightening things
like Hang Out in Public or Make New
Friends or even (god forbid) Talk to the
Opposite Sex. A little hard alcohol will
take the sting off of those activities real
quick, and before you know it you're a reg
ular Smoothy McSmootherson. You also
no longer have control of your bowels, but
hey, the ladies like that kind of thing.
The singletons live for this swanky af
fair because we get to mingle with the en
tire senior class, and there has to be some
one attractive/not weird out there that we
haven't met yet,right? RIGHT?! We try to
increase our chances of success by looking
especially hot, which usually means that
the guys wear a collared shirt and the
women wear nothing at all. You might
think it would be awkward to prance
about a crowded bar completely nude, but
it's not. We are so drunk at this point that
we think we are Tiny Kittens, and every
one knows that Tiny Kittens don't wear
clothes. Tiny Kittens also like to run in
front of the Marguerite, but that's a terri
ble, terrible story that does not embody
the joy and laughter found at Pub Night.
Several people have asked me how to
approach someone they don't know well
at Pub Night. The answer is that it doesn't
matter because they won't remember you
the next day. In fact, you don't even have
to go to Pub Night in order to hit on some
one. You just find an attractive senior on
the Facebook, call her up and say, "Hey, it
was great hanging out with you last night.
Would you like to go out to dinner or get
married as we discussed when you were
plastered?" Hot Senior will be too embar
rassed to admit that she doesn't remember
you to turn down your offer. And every
one knows that the healthiest relation
ships are based on manipulation and de
ception.
A more "traditional" option is to at
tend Pub Night semi-sober and strike up a
normal conversation by saying something
like "Hey, I see you all over campus but
I've never introduced myself." Unfortu
nately, this option carries with it the possi
bility of rejection — something you will
never have to deal with in the real world.
Other things not found in the real world:
poverty, discrimination, the harsh conse
quences of spending four years in college
avoiding emotional intimacy ...
But I digress. Pub Night is a wonderful
tradition that ranks up there with the Ca
reer Development Center in terms of pos
itively affecting the Stanford student
body. It positively affected my student
body last week, when I made out with a
guy who was — at least at the time — not
entirely unfortunate looking.
"What's your name?" he asked me af
terwards.
"Meow," I replied.
If you're out there, man, thanks for
showing me what Pub Night is really all
about: getting to know your fellow class
mates far better than was once thought to
be socially appropriate.
