# Rice tackles Israel border disputes
## Jordan will partner with United States to defend against terrorism 
### ANNE GEARAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) â€” Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice rearranged her travel schedule
at the last minute yesterday to try to win a deal on Is
raeli-Palestinian border issues.
Rice delayed her departure from the Middle East for
Asia in hopes of announcing an agreement on technical
issues regarding the opening of some crossings in the
Gaza Strip.
"We are still working some issues on both sides,"
Rice spokesman Sean McCormick said.
While negotiations continued in Jerusalem, Rice
made a quick side trip to Jordan to offer condolences for
the more than 50 people killed in terrorist hotel bomb
ings last week. She set a large yellow and white wreath be
side a temporary wall erected in place of blown out glass
at the Radisson SAS hotel, where many of the victims
had been attending a Palestinian wedding celebration.
Rice said the United States and Jordan will stand to
gether against terrorism.
"There is no justification for the wanton killing of in
nocents," Rice said before going inside the hotel to sur
vey the damage.
She also met with Jordanian King Abdullah 11.
She was to return to the Israeli capital last night local
time to work further on the border issue.
Rice urged Israelis and Palestinians to capitalize on
the opportunity for peace and cooperation offered by
Israel's unilateral pullout from the long-occupied Gaza,
saying a deal is "in sight" on the border issues.
Questions of security and authority at routes in and
out of Gaza have stalled progress between the two sides
since the Palestinians took nominal control of the sea
side territory bordering Israel two months ago.
As she has done three other times this year. Rice
shuttled between Jerusalem and the Palestinian head
quarters in Ramallah with a mix of praise and pressure
for both sides. She saw Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon over breakfast, then held a long one-on-one ses
sion with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the
old offices where Abbas' predecessor, Yasser Arafat,
holed up before his death last year.
