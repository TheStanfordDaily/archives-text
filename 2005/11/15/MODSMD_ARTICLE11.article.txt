## Online travel options for consumers increase as AOL and Yahoo! enter the price-slashing playing field 
### MARK KOGAN 
In the old days, booking any sort of vacation or trip
required spending countless hours calling differ
ent travel agencies, airlines and hotels and having
to put together complicated spreadsheets. This in
volved reams of paper, yards of string and usually
a copious amount of cursing.
But that all changed in 1995 when Expedia ap
peared on the Internet horizon, according to the com
pany's official Web site. Founded as a subsidiary com
pany of Microsoft, Expedia offered the unique ability
to browse and compare travel options and prices from
a variety of different sources.
Because of its popularity, Expedia went independ
ent in 1996, laying a foundation for the brand new mar
ket of Internet travel.
"Expedia, Inc. is on a mission to become the largest

and most profitable seller of travel in the world, by
helping everyone everywhere plan and purchase
everything in travel," the Web site says.
Expedia's success spawned a plethora of similar
sites that boomed in the late 1990s and early 2(XX)s.
Companies like Travelocity, Orbitz and Priceline began
offering not only price comparisons, but also the abili
ty to book hotels, rent cars and buy event tickets.
It was impossible to ignore the immense popular
ity and success of these Web sites. Large travel, air
line and hotel companies quickly began signing deals
and contracts for placement priority and advertising
rights. Seemingly overnight, the Internet travel in
dustry had exploded into a multi-million dollar busi
ness.
The application of these sites to college students
seems like a no-brainer.The ability to scour the Inter
net for the lowest prices or the most obscure tickets,
and to search for cheap ways to visit friends and fami
ly, has become an indispensable aspect of travel-plan
ning for many on the Farm.

Student-centered travel sites such as Student Uni
verse and Student Adventure Travel have also sprung
up, offering special fares and vacation packages tai
lored specifically for students.
The business keeps growing, with new offers and
packages being circulated as well as more and more
companies coming online, including the recent addi
tion of AOL Travel in partnership with TVavelocity and
Yahoo! Farechase.
Even Google may soon be joining the fray, accord
ing to an article published in The New York Times on
Nov. 7.
This continued growth has spawned competitive
luring of business partners as well as the race to come
up with new and better tools to make planning trips
quicker and easier.
AOL inked a deal with Peter Greenberg, the
travel editor of NBC's "Today" show, to produce
video segments exclusively for AOL, says The New
York Times article. And Travelocity will soon be fea
turing customer written reviews on destinations, ho-

tels and events,
k Meanwhile, Yahoo! has recently im-
I plemented a system that allows users
i to put together trips and post them
on a public database for other view
ers to look through and comment on,

easier and more effective travel planning for the tech
nology-savvy customer.
The Web sites' versatility and ease of use has kept
them popular among students as well as older travelers.
"It compares a bunch of different options from a va
riety of companies," says freshman Chris Marinelli."A
lot of college students don't have a ton of spare time, so
the ability to do all the research quickly makes these
sites very useful."
Senior Valerie Kruley says she agrees that these
sites can slice hours off of trip-planning endeavors.
"We're on the net all the time as students, so it's a
good place to look up info right away," she says.
So whether planning an elaborate summer jaunt
through Europe or a quick weekend flight home, stop
calling the travel agencies. Internet travel sites can
quickly become your best friend for finding great deals.
Plus, they'll save you a ton of headaches, and they're
only getting better.
