# Controlling your computer from overseas? Mais oui!
## 
### 
Controlling one computer from an
other is one of the coolest tricks on
the Web.
My roommate learned this the hard
way. I gave him quite a scare one after
noon when he looked over to my empty
desk only to see my computer become
suddenly possessed by some distant
power. Although there was no one else in
the room, my mouse pointer moved, win
dows opened, sounds boinged and the
printer began printing.
At the time, my roommate had no
idea that I was sitting at the library across
campus remotely accessing my computer
and that with some free software, he, too,
could easily manipulate his computer
from anywhere on the Web.
Keeping your computer perpetually
at your fingertips has its advantages.
When traveling, you can stop in any In
ternet cafe or Web kiosk and instantly
have your desktop, files and applications
just as you left them at home. Those in
the working world like the idea of access
ing their work computers from home,
and — when the boss isn't looking —
their home computers from work.
Commercial sites such as GoTo-
MyPC.com leave the false impression
that you have to pay for these services.
Don't be fooled by their slick ads and

trademarked slogans, as they could not
be farther from the truth. There is an en
tire class of free software — such as Vir
tual Network Computing and Remote
Desktop — that make remotely control
ling your computer a breeze.
How It Works
Let's say you are traveling to Paris
(lucky you!) and want to reach the com
puter you left in California. Before you
leave,you would install the server software
on your machine. You would leave your
computer online and record its Internet
address. When you get to Paris, you could
pop into an Internet cafe on the Champs-
Elysees and use software called a client to
connect to your computer in the States.
From Paris you would see a real-time
image of your screen exactly as it appears
in California and any keystrokes or
mouse clicks you made in Paris would be
sent to your home computer. This way,
you would have the same control of your

computer that you would if you were sit
ting right in front of it.
Each remote desktop program runs
on a protocol. The most versatile proto
col is Virtual Network Computing. Orig
inally developed by Oracle and AT&T to
run on ATMs, Virtual Network Comput
ing is now free for anyone to use and
modify. As a result, there are dozens of
VNC servers or clients for virtually every
operating system, including personal dig
ital assistants and cell phones.
One big advantage of VNC is that it
allows you to mix and match operating
systems. For example, you can use a VNC
client on your cell-phone to connect to a
Linux or Windows machine.
To use VNC, first download a server
on the computer you want to access.
Windows and Linux users should get
TightVNC—free at tightVNC.com.
After running the "Start TightVNC
Server" program, be sure to set a pass
word and record your IP address. If you
have trouble finding your IP address, go
to http://whatismyip.com.
On Windows, you know the server is
running when you see a small VNC icon
appear in your bottom right taskbar.
TightVNC users are done! Because
TightVNC invokes a Web server with a
Java applet, you can access your server

from any Java-enabled Web browser.
You don't even need to download a
client because the Web browser will now
act as your client.
Run off to Paris, open a browser and
in the address bar type in your IP ad
dress followed by ":5800", e.g.
" 192.168.1.1:5800." After entering your
password, you should see your comput
er flash onto the screen.
Mac users will need to install OS-
Xvnc. available for free at www.red
stonesoftware.com/vnc.html. Running
OSXvnc on the Mac is even easier as it
has a slick and intuitive user interface.
Unfortunately. OSXvnc does not yet
offer a Java Viewer. This means that to
connect to your Mac you will need to use
one of the many VNC clients available
on the Web.
On a Mac, download Chicken from
http://www.applc.com/downloads/ma
cosx/networking_security/chickenofthe
vnc.html.
Caveats
Virtual Network Computing has some
drawbacks. The first is that it only gives
you access to your screen. You can't listen
to any music or print out files remotely.
Also, in most cases you cannot transfer
files between the client and the server.

Furthermore, VNC is not strictly se
cure. Anyone worried about strict securi
ty should tunnel their VNC sessions
through a Virtual Private Network or
through an encrypted channel such as
Secure Shell.
And as with anything, security also in
corporates a human component. If you
neglect to set a password, anyone can hi
jack your computer.
In tests for this article, I neglected this
subtlety and my friend engaged me in a
game of mouse tug-of-war from across
campus.
Finally, users of Microsoft Windows
XP Professional have a free remote
desktop program already installed and
ready to run, called the Remote Desk
top Protocol. My friends, however,
found the Remote Desktop Protocol to
be more confusing and recommend
sticking to VNC.
Regardless of what protocol you
choose, remotely accessing your comput
er is a nifty trick that may come in handy
on your next vacation. Just remember to
tell your roommate.
