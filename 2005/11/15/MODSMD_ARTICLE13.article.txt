## Editorial Weeklong Thanksgiving break is a welcome trial 
### 
This Thanksgiving, don't forget to give
thanks for the extra-long break. Last
year, the Faculty Senate voted to ex
tend Thanksgiving break from two days to a
whole week on a provisional one-year basis.
To make up for the lost days, they started fall
quarter on Monday, two days earlier than
usual. This was a logical and relatively pain
less way to accomplish what appears to be a
beneficial reform.
However, while a longer Thanksgiving
break is a good thing for most students, we
worry that a minority of students will be ad
versely affected. International students and
others unable to go home may find them
selves bored and lonely on a largely-desert
ed campus.Therefore, it is crucial that the ad
ministration provide events and entertain
ment for those who choose not to leave for
Thanksgiving.
Additionally, there may be unanticipated
flaws with extending the break. For example,
how will this affect graduate students with
families, for whom the campus is home?
What about faculty members whose re
search activities could be interrupted or Law
School students who do not get the extend
ed break?
That is why the Faculty Senate was wise
to extend the vacation only on a provisional
basis. Why rush into making a permanent de
cision if you can have a trial run first? We ex
pect that in the coming months, the Faculty
Senate will seriously research how the ex
tended Thanksgiving break impacted the en
tire Stanford community.
The best way to do so, in our opinion, is to
provide a forum for community input. There
is really no excuse not to. The decision that
needs to be made is already on the table.
There is no time pressure that would neces
sitate a quick, highly-centralized decision
making process. And, after all, who is a bet
ter judge of success than those that the
change is supposed to help?
To echo a common theme in our editori
als, we hope the decision-makers seize this
opportunity to show that they value a line of
communication with the student bodv. The

more the administration takes advantage of
opportunities to solicit broad input and to
speak openly with the community about im
portant decisions and potential changes, the
better.
Our guess is that the extension will be
made permanent. Overall, it is a sensible re
form. Under the old system, students were
leaving campus early for Thanksgiving, dis
rupting classes and complicating professors'
course planning. Ihe new system allows out
of-staters more time at home, making it
more feasible for them to visit their families
for the holiday. In the past, many decided it
was not worth two full travel days and an ex
pensive plane ticket to be home for effec
tively only two or three days. Visits home
now seem more justified to these students;
many who have not gone home for previous
Thanksgiving breaks will likely do so this
year. Consequently, sentiments of gratitude
arc widespread among these students.
Starting the school year on a Monday is
also a reasonable change. It made the shop
ping period more rational; students did not
have to wait a whole week after the start of
classes for their second Tiiesday/Thursday
class meetings. And worries about the
change affecting Sophomore College
proved unfounded.
Further, we do not buy the claim that hav
ing a whole week off so close to finals is a bad
thing.This can be viewed as the reading peri
od that many other colleges enjoy, or as a
true "Dead Week." We imagine that those
who dislike the new system because it may
disrupt their academic momentum will easi
ly adjust to the change.
Finally, having Big Game at the begin
ning of a long break means students don't
have to choose between academics and the
Big Game festivities. I lopefully, this will lead
to a more packed student section at the Sta
dium than in years past. Admittedly, stu
dents now face the choice of attending Big
Game or going home a little earlier. These
are two pleasant options, however; better to
sacrifice Big Game for home cooking than
for writing a paper.

many who have not gone home for previous
Thanksgiving breaks will likely do so this
year. Consequently, sentiments of gratitude
arc widespread among these students.
Starting the school year on a Monday is
also a reasonable change. It made the shop
ping period more rational; students did not
have to wait a whole week after the start of
classes for their second Tiiesday/Thursday
class meetings. And worries about the
change affecting Sophomore College
proved unfounded.
Further, we do not buy the claim that hav
ing a whole week off so close to finals is a bad
thing.This can be viewed as the reading peri
od that many other colleges enjoy, or as a
true "Dead Week." We imagine that those
who dislike the new system because it may
disrupt their academic momentum will easi
ly adjust to the change.
Finally, having Big Game at the begin
ning of a long break means students don't
have to choose between academics and the
Big Game festivities. I lopefully, this will lead
to a more packed student section at the Sta
dium than in years past. Admittedly, stu
dents now face the choice of attending Big
Game or going home a little earlier. These
are two pleasant options, however; better to
sacrifice Big Game for home cooking than
for writing a paper.

This Thanksgiving, don't forget to give
thanks for the extra-long break. Last
year, the Faculty Senate voted to ex
tend Thanksgiving break from two days to a
whole week on a provisional one-year basis.
To make up for the lost days, they started fall
quarter on Monday, two days earlier than
usual. This was a logical and relatively pain
less way to accomplish what appears to be a
beneficial reform.
However, while a longer Thanksgiving
break is a good thing for most students, we
worry that a minority of students will be ad
versely affected. International students and
others unable to go home may find them
selves bored and lonely on a largely-desert
ed campus.Therefore, it is crucial that the ad
ministration provide events and entertain
ment for those who choose not to leave for
Thanksgiving.
Additionally, there may be unanticipated
flaws with extending the break. For example,
how will this affect graduate students with
families, for whom the campus is home?
What about faculty members whose re
search activities could be interrupted or Law
School students who do not get the extend
ed break?
That is why the Faculty Senate was wise
to extend the vacation only on a provisional
basis. Why rush into making a permanent de
cision if you can have a trial run first? We ex
pect that in the coming months, the Faculty
Senate will seriously research how the ex
tended Thanksgiving break impacted the en
tire Stanford community.
The best way to do so, in our opinion, is to
provide a forum for community input. There
is really no excuse not to. The decision that
needs to be made is already on the table.
There is no time pressure that would neces
sitate a quick, highly-centralized decision
making process. And, after all, who is a bet
ter judge of success than those that the
change is supposed to help?
To echo a common theme in our editori
als, we hope the decision-makers seize this
opportunity to show that they value a line of
communication with the student bodv. The

more the administration takes advantage of
opportunities to solicit broad input and to
speak openly with the community about im
portant decisions and potential changes, the
better.
Our guess is that the extension will be
made permanent. Overall, it is a sensible re
form. Under the old system, students were
leaving campus early for Thanksgiving, dis
rupting classes and complicating professors'
course planning. Ihe new system allows out
of-staters more time at home, making it
more feasible for them to visit their families
for the holiday. In the past, many decided it
was not worth two full travel days and an ex
pensive plane ticket to be home for effec
tively only two or three days. Visits home
now seem more justified to these students;
many who have not gone home for previous
Thanksgiving breaks will likely do so this
year. Consequently, sentiments of gratitude
arc widespread among these students.
Starting the school year on a Monday is
also a reasonable change. It made the shop
ping period more rational; students did not
