# Guaranteed not to offend: Self-censorship struggles
## 
### 
People tell me all the time how lucky I
am to be writing for The Daily. "You
can say whatever you want," they tell
me. "People will listen to you." Well, I don't
know if anybody actually listens, but I do
know that I can't just "say whatever I want."
There's a fine line between an interesting
column and a controversial, politically
charged editorial.
Don't get me wrong; a little bit of contro
versy can be a good thing. But I'm only a
freshman — I can't afford to ostracize my
self from the entire Stanford community this
early in my career.
Normally, I am as anti-political correct
ness as they come. There's nothing more an
noying than a guy who pretends to like
everyone and everything but secretly holds a
grudge against God for creating all this crap.
And the facade is so obvious; anybody can
see right through it, so he ends up just look
ing like a jerk in the end. At least if he had
told the truth, only a handful of people
would have thought he was a jerk.
But sometimes political correctness is a
necessary evil. Especially in the mass media.
(OK, so The Stanford Daily doesn't have
quite the circulation of The New York Times,
but it still qualifies as "mass media").
It's ironic that, as a columnist. 1 share the
inner workings of my mind with hundreds of
people every week. Anybody who knows me
will attest to the fact that it takes consider
able effort to get me to open up in real life.
So why this dichotomy?
It could be that writing is a private thing,
made public only after the fact. Like a guy
who sings in front of his Webcam in the pri
vacy of his bedroom and inadvertently be
comes a national phenomenon, a writer's au
dience is indirect.The writer doesn't have to
witness people's reactions firsthand, doesn't
have to stand in the spotlight with a roomful
of eyes fixated on him. waiting for them to
whip out the rotten fruit.
But as soon as that first tomato hits the
stage, live performers know it's time to call it
quits. Writers have no such luxury 'Iliey only
find out what people think when they arrive
at home to find a pile of nasty fruit on their
doorstep in response to something they
wrote a week ago (or sometimes longer).
I have grown to dread that "in-between"
time, when it's too early to know how peo
ple will respond but too late to take it all

back, even if some people's responses tell
me that I never should have said it. When
I'm sitting in class and the person in front of
me is reading the paper. I turn into a giraffe
as I surreptitiously (1 hope) check which
page she's reading, wondering if she's read
my column and, if she has. what she thought
of it... or if she wasn't even interested in the
first place.
If people don't want to read what I write,
that's fine with me;there's not much I can do
to change that. But the scary thing is that
those who do read my columns find out a lit
tle more about me than I would necessarily
tell them if I were to meet them on the street.
(And, thanks to my extensive utilization of
poetic license, they get an exaggerated, hy
perbolic version of me).
St), against my better judgment, political
correctness creeps in; I don't even try to fight
it. Yes, 1 can write about anything I want to
write about, but I can't just say anything I
want to say. My parents and friends from
home read this column, so I can't talk about
how much better my life is now that I'm
away from them. My friends and classmates
at Stanford read this column, so I can't com
plain about the"l-Hum kid" or the annoying
girl down the hall. Random people whom I
have never met read this column — but I
suppose it's OK to offend them, as long as I
never actually have to meet them.
Of course, now I have to clarify that I
love my friends and family at home, my I-
Hum section is one of my favorite classes
and I have nothing but love for all the girls
on my floor.
But if you're one of those random people
whom I don't know. I have no apologies for
you. Just please don't send me any rotten
fruit.

If you were offended bv anything in this col
umn, e-mail Stephanie at salessiC" Stanford, edit
to complain.

Moment of Zen
People tell me all the time how lucky I
am to be writing for The Daily. "You
can say whatever you want," they tell
me. "People will listen to you." Well, I don't
know if anybody actually listens, but I do
know that I can't just "say whatever I want."
There's a fine line between an interesting
column and a controversial, politically
charged editorial.
Don't get me wrong; a little bit of contro
versy can be a good thing. But I'm only a
freshman — I can't afford to ostracize my
self from the entire Stanford community this
early in my career.
Normally, I am as anti-political correct
ness as they come. There's nothing more an
noying than a guy who pretends to like
everyone and everything but secretly holds a
grudge against God for creating all this crap.
And the facade is so obvious; anybody can
see right through it, so he ends up just look
ing like a jerk in the end. At least if he had
told the truth, only a handful of people
would have thought he was a jerk.
But sometimes political correctness is a
necessary evil. Especially in the mass media.
(OK, so The Stanford Daily doesn't have
quite the circulation of The New York Times,
but it still qualifies as "mass media").
It's ironic that, as a columnist. 1 share the
inner workings of my mind with hundreds of
people every week. Anybody who knows me
will attest to the fact that it takes consider
able effort to get me to open up in real life.
So why this dichotomy?
It could be that writing is a private thing,
made public only after the fact. Like a guy
who sings in front of his Webcam in the pri
vacy of his bedroom and inadvertently be
comes a national phenomenon, a writer's au
dience is indirect.The writer doesn't have to
witness people's reactions firsthand, doesn't
have to stand in the spotlight with a roomful
of eyes fixated on him. waiting for them to
whip out the rotten fruit.
But as soon as that first tomato hits the
stage, live performers know it's time to call it
quits. Writers have no such luxury 'Iliey only
find out what people think when they arrive
at home to find a pile of nasty fruit on their
doorstep in response to something they
wrote a week ago (or sometimes longer).
I have grown to dread that "in-between"
time, when it's too early to know how peo
ple will respond but too late to take it all

back, even if some people's responses tell
me that I never should have said it. When
I'm sitting in class and the person in front of
me is reading the paper. I turn into a giraffe
as I surreptitiously (1 hope) check which
page she's reading, wondering if she's read
my column and, if she has. what she thought
of it... or if she wasn't even interested in the
first place.
If people don't want to read what I write,
that's fine with me;there's not much I can do
to change that. But the scary thing is that
those who do read my columns find out a lit
tle more about me than I would necessarily
tell them if I were to meet them on the street.
(And, thanks to my extensive utilization of
poetic license, they get an exaggerated, hy
perbolic version of me).
St), against my better judgment, political
correctness creeps in; I don't even try to fight
it. Yes, 1 can write about anything I want to
write about, but I can't just say anything I
want to say. My parents and friends from
home read this column, so I can't talk about
how much better my life is now that I'm
away from them. My friends and classmates
at Stanford read this column, so I can't com
plain about the"l-Hum kid" or the annoying
girl down the hall. Random people whom I
have never met read this column — but I
suppose it's OK to offend them, as long as I
never actually have to meet them.
Of course, now I have to clarify that I
love my friends and family at home, my I-
Hum section is one of my favorite classes
and I have nothing but love for all the girls
on my floor.
But if you're one of those random people
whom I don't know. I have no apologies for
you. Just please don't send me any rotten
fruit.
