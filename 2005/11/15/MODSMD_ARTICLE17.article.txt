# Bagels, but no world domination
## 
### 
I turned 21 this weekend. At 12:10 a.m., 1
pushed a cart full of alcohol through the
Safeway checkout and squirmed while
the cashier examined my ID before breaking
out in a grin and wishing me a happy birth
day. Ihen. a bunch of Paly kids asked me for
an objective opinion on whether or not Palo
Alto sucks (it does). They were relieved to
hear this and emphatically explained that
they would not be attending Stanford any
time soon.
Which got me thinking: As reasonable as
the argument for lowering the drinking age
to 18 is. there's one giant benefit to keeping it
at 21 — one last good birthday to look for
ward to. If the drinking age were 18, then
there would be no major positive milestones
after that. In fact.every one from then on out
would be downhill — running down the
clock of your youth onto middle age.
"Twenty would still be good." you say.
Your 20th birthday sucks. ITie day before
you turn 20. you can still blame your person
al failings in life on "being a teenager" — the
day after, your failings are all your own
damn fault.
I n any case, the one birthday present I was
hoping for didn't materialize. I had always se
cretly hoped that when I turned 21, my father
would call me and say."Son, it's all true. Your
copy of'The Protocols of the Learned Elders
of /ion' will show up in the mail in three to
five days." Since this is Stanford, the post of
fice would have delayed it for two weeks. But
that's OK. I could have borrowed my room
mate's copy. In the middle of the night,
cloaked members of AEPi would show up at
my door and say.'Mt's time." Using technolo
gy stolen from alien spaceships, we would be
transported to the secret Jewish headquar
ters in Antarctica from which the council
rules world events.
Hut none of this happened. Instead. I fell
asleep in the hallway outside my room — not
because I was locked out, but because my
body decided that was the only place I could
sleep that would not cause me to sponta
neously die, or puke or both.
I probably should have seen this coming.
Jews don't really rule the world. Firstly, if
AEPi had a say in anything, we'd at least
have a AEPhi chapter (the sorority of nose
jobs) at Stanford. Secondly, if 1 was going to
hear about Jewish world domination, 1
would have found out about it when I was
13 — the tender age when, according to
Jewish law. neurotic, insecure, nebbish Jew
ish boys become neurotic, insecure, nebbish
Jewish men. F inally, if we ran the world,
we'd be doing a much better job of prevent
ing crazy people from periodically trying to
kill us off.
The whole ITirow-the-Jew-Down-the-
Well sentiment is something I never quite un
derstood because 1 grew up in New York.
Growing up Jewish in New York distorts

your view of the world. I've never in my life
faced any anti-Semitism and can barely even
fathom it — especially when Seinfeld was
such a global success; you can't get much
more Jewish than that. I can easily go find all
the anti-Semitism I want online (and I did
just that in the process of writing this col
umn), but I generally try to stay away from
that stuff in the same way I try to stay away
from staring directly into lasers — it's bad
for the brain.
Ten percent of the worldwide Jewish pop
ulation lives in New York. Our senator is an
outspoken Zionist. When our mayor makes
bets with other cities, the wager is measured
in pounds of pastrami and loaves of rye
bread. In my high school history class, the
teacher asked what percentage of the world
we thought was Jewish and got answers like
20 percent. In reality? Possibly 0.23 percent.
So it's a shock when a Jew leaves the city.
Even in California, people don't understand
what it means to be a New York Jew; that is, a
Cultural Jew.
This is what it means to me.
I don't believe in God, I was never bar
mitzvahed and I've never voluntarily been
to temple. My favorite food is baby back
ribs. But I identify as Jewish whenever I'm
given the opportunity. These are my people.
I'm jealous of others whose cultural her
itage is distinct from their spiritual heritage.
No one considers a non-Catholic Italian
strange.
Being a New York Jew means aspiring to
live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan
and sending your parents off to live in south
Florida (pronounced "Flarida"). It means
being raised in a culture that values books
and education over almost anything else —
my maternal grandparents spent their whole
lives going to continuing education classes in
an effort to better understand Ingmar
Bergman films. It comes with a mixture of so
cial liberalism and traditionalism coexisting.
Ouoth my father."l don't care what lifestyle
you choose, I want grandkids."
It means understanding how to wield the
most powerful weapon God ever gifted us
with — guilt. "Oi! Too busy to call your
mother, Mr. Bigshot? Something more im
portant going on in your life than checking in
with the woman who gave you life?" — mut
ter — "No, no, its fine; don't call. I'll just sit
alone in the dark." It's only a stereotype be
cause it's true.

Being a New York Jew has a lot to do with
food. We have a stringent set of dietary laws.
No shellfish, no pork, no meat mixed with
dairy. Which is why, on the Sabbath, you goto
the next town over to eat pork lo mein at a
Chinese restaurant, so the neighbors won't
see. We even have our own criteria for rating
restaurants, sort of like the Michelin guide
except someone other than ITie New York
Times' food critic cares about it. Just ask my
grandmother: "How was the food?" — "Eh.
But the portions!" When it comes to the food
of our culture, we're very particular. Bagels
outside of New York are just pale imitations.
"It's the water," we say."lt's different outside
the city."
We're a people that aren't afraid to laugh
at how absurd we are. In our collective delu
sion, we sometimes think we do rule the
world, even though we're barely a blip on the
radar. Which is why you get so many Jewish
comedians. We're so self-deprecating as a
people that we invented a language with as
many words for loser as Eskimos have for
snow. When we decided that wasn't enough,
we decided that you could add "-nik" to the
end of any string of words to come up with a
new and nuanced explanation of exactly how
someone was a loser.
Our religion isn't very touchy-feely
friendly. We got the fire-and-brimstone Old
Testament God. The one who is really into
testing us. Moses, our prophet, is like a less
cuddly version of Jesus. We don't have a well
defined afterlife. As far as I've seen, there just
isn't a good hook. Christians get inner peace
and pearly gates. Hindus get nirvana and
reincarnation. We get sciatica problems and
overbearing mothers.
So you end up with a lot of Jewish atheists,
like me. A culture that combines cynicism
and education is dangerous for the faith that
backs it. Which is why, of late, people have
been trying to shoehorn a different faith into
the culture —this week it's Buddhism. All
the feel-good spirituality of the East mixed
with all the feel-bad culture of the West. But
that doesn't seem right, either; its like trying
to bake a cake with margarine so that it will
be parve (no daily safe for eating with any
Kosher meal) — it ends up tasting like it was
made with rancid butter.
But I don't ever intend or expect to
convert. In fact. I anticipate marrying a
Jewish girl.
Why?
Because, as Woody Allen conclusively ex
plained in "Annie Hall," a goy will never re
ally understand what it means to be a New
York Jew.

Are you a nice Jewish girl in need of a nice Jew
ish hoy to take home to Mommy and Daddy?
