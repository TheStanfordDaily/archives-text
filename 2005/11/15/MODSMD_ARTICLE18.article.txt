## Notes from a storied rivalry

books" is a familiar
A phrase during Rivalry
Weekend. Almost every team in col
lege football plays a rivalry game in
late November, with the pride of an
entire state (or states) on the line.
Even one-sided matchups on paper
can become wildly competitive on
the field.
Still, few could have expected the
pandemonium scene one snowy day
in Ann Arbor, when Michigan's
fresh-faced new coach pulled off one
of the biggest upsets in American
sports history.
Bo Schembechler arrived in the
winter of 1969 at a proud but sagging
program and immediately set the sea
son goal: beat Ohio State.
This was, of course, a yearly goal in
the minds of players and fans alike,
but this would be no ordinary rivalry
game. Ohio State had won the 1968
national championship by flattening
everyone in its path. OSU coach
Woody Hayes adhered to a strict phi
losophy of defense, reliance on the
ground game and mistake-free foot
ball. It was a meat-grinding machine
that no one could figure out how to
slow down.
Many in the media speculated that
the 1969 Buckeye squad was perhaps
the greatest college football team
ever assembled — and this was a
media old enough to collectively re
call the Army dynasty of the 1940's
and the Oklahoma powerhouse in the
mid-fifties.
This is all without mentioning that
the Buckeyes had hung 50 points on
Michigan the season before — the
final margin determined by an Ohio
State two-point conversion at the end
of the game.
Schembechler also had some per
sonal ties — Bo had been Hayes'
top assistant at Ohio State before his
successful stint at Miami of Ohio.
This set up a thrilling story: the old
coach's disciple taking the reins at a
big-time program that happened to
be the mentor's biggest rival. Hayes
refused to i*efer to Michigan by
name, instead calling it "that school
