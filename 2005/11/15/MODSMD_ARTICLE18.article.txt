## Notes from a storied rivalry 
### 
4 4 r I 1 hrowing out the record
books" is a familiar
A phrase during Rivalry
Weekend. Almost every team in col
lege football plays a rivalry game in
late November, with the pride of an
entire state (or states) on the line.
Even one-sided matchups on paper
can become wildly competitive on
the field.
Still, few could have expected the
pandemonium scene one snowy day
in Ann Arbor, when Michigan's
fresh-faced new coach pulled off one
of the biggest upsets in American
sports history.
Bo Schembechler arrived in the
winter of 1969 at a proud but sagging
program and immediately set the sea
son goal: beat Ohio State.
This was, of course, a yearly goal in
the minds of players and fans alike,
but this would be no ordinary rivalry
game. Ohio State had won the 1968
national championship by flattening
everyone in its path. OSU coach
Woody Hayes adhered to a strict phi
losophy of defense, reliance on the
ground game and mistake-free foot
ball. It was a meat-grinding machine
that no one could figure out how to
slow down.
Many in the media speculated that
the 1969 Buckeye squad was perhaps
the greatest college football team
ever assembled — and this was a
media old enough to collectively re
call the Army dynasty of the 1940's
and the Oklahoma powerhouse in the
mid-fifties.
This is all without mentioning that
the Buckeyes had hung 50 points on
Michigan the season before — the
final margin determined by an Ohio
State two-point conversion at the end
of the game.
Schembechler also had some per
sonal ties — Bo had been Hayes'
top assistant at Ohio State before his
successful stint at Miami of Ohio.
This set up a thrilling story: the old
coach's disciple taking the reins at a
big-time program that happened to
be the mentor's biggest rival. Hayes
refused to i*efer to Michigan by
name, instead calling it "that school


Topher
Anderson
The Turnaround
up north."
Bo made preparation for the game
a priority every week of the season.
He designed Michigan's base defense
to stop the Ohio State power running
attack. The Wolverine offense was
similar to the Buckeyes', giving the
defense daily practice against their
rival's schemes. Schembechler and his
staff planned to beat Ohio State at its
own game.
Years later, legendary radio broad
caster Bob Ufer described the stakes
during a visit by then-President and
Michigan football alum Gerald Ford.
"With what many said was the
Dream Team of the 1960'5, riding a 22-
garjje winning streak...Ohio came to
bury Michigan," Ufer said.
Prior to the game, Ufer recited a
highly stylized original poem describ
ing a mock funeral, in which Ohio
State's corpse was substituted for
Michigan's.
Despite the heat failing in the
hotel the night before, the Wolverines
were ready to play. Ohio State
opened the scoring but lost the lead
on the next possession, regained it,
then lost it for good. With UM leading
14-12. diminutive cornerback Barry
Pierson returned a punt to the three
yard line of Ohio State. Quarterback
Don Moorehead followed All Amer
ican tackle Dan Dierdorf into the end
zone fora nine-point lead that all but
slammed the door on the top-ranked
Buckeyes, who failed to score the rest
of the game.
Fans knew the game was in Michi
gan's hands when Ohio State went to

Woody Hayes' last resort — the for
ward pass. Hayes later told his stu
dent, "you beat my best team."
The crowd counted down the final
seconds, and Ufer bellowed out
"they've got Schembechler on their
shoulders. Look at the crowd. Ripley
couldn't have scripted it any better
than this!" The 24-12 victory put
Schembechler on the map and was a
validation of everything he had in
stalled — his tough spring camp, his
conservative style and his controver
sial discipline.
All this in a quaint college town
that had been invaded by the 60s —
when students at elite colleges
everywhere were burning draft
cards, smoking dope and rejecting
authority just because they could.
As conference co-champion, Michi
gan received the Rose Bowl bid, the
first of 10 trips to Pasadena for
Schembechler.
That new year began a maddening
sequence of hard-luck Rose Bowl
losses for the Wolverines, as Schem
bechler suffered a heart attack New
Year's Eve and the team lost to USC
10-3.
Under the rather byzantine rules
of the Big 10 Conference, Ohio
State would not have gone to the
Rose Bowl even if it had won (the
accursed 'no-repeat' rule), but the
upset did allow Texas, with its revo
lutionary wishbone offense, to win
the first of two consecutive national
titles. Bo finished with a record of 5-
4-1 against his mentor, but in the
words of Hayes, he would never win
a bigger game.

4 4 r I 1 hrowing out the record
books" is a familiar
A phrase during Rivalry
Weekend. Almost every team in col
lege football plays a rivalry game in
late November, with the pride of an
entire state (or states) on the line.
Even one-sided matchups on paper
can become wildly competitive on
the field.
Still, few could have expected the
pandemonium scene one snowy day
in Ann Arbor, when Michigan's
fresh-faced new coach pulled off one
of the biggest upsets in American
sports history.
Bo Schembechler arrived in the
winter of 1969 at a proud but sagging
program and immediately set the sea
son goal: beat Ohio State.
This was, of course, a yearly goal in
the minds of players and fans alike,
but this would be no ordinary rivalry
game. Ohio State had won the 1968
national championship by flattening
everyone in its path. OSU coach
Woody Hayes adhered to a strict phi
losophy of defense, reliance on the
ground game and mistake-free foot
ball. It was a meat-grinding machine
that no one could figure out how to
slow down.
Many in the media speculated that
the 1969 Buckeye squad was perhaps
the greatest college football team
ever assembled — and this was a
media old enough to collectively re
call the Army dynasty of the 1940's
and the Oklahoma powerhouse in the
mid-fifties.
This is all without mentioning that
the Buckeyes had hung 50 points on
Michigan the season before — the
final margin determined by an Ohio
State two-point conversion at the end
of the game.
Schembechler also had some per
sonal ties — Bo had been Hayes'
top assistant at Ohio State before his
successful stint at Miami of Ohio.
This set up a thrilling story: the old
coach's disciple taking the reins at a
big-time program that happened to
be the mentor's biggest rival. Hayes
refused to i*efer to Michigan by
name, instead calling it "that school


Topher
Anderson
The Turnaround
up north."
Bo made preparation for the game
a priority every week of the season.
He designed Michigan's base defense
to stop the Ohio State power running
attack. The Wolverine offense was
similar to the Buckeyes', giving the
defense daily practice against their
rival's schemes. Schembechler and his
staff planned to beat Ohio State at its
own game.
Years later, legendary radio broad
caster Bob Ufer described the stakes
during a visit by then-President and
Michigan football alum Gerald Ford.
"With what many said was the
Dream Team of the 1960'5, riding a 22-
garjje winning streak...Ohio came to
bury Michigan," Ufer said.
Prior to the game, Ufer recited a
highly stylized original poem describ
ing a mock funeral, in which Ohio
State's corpse was substituted for
Michigan's.
Despite the heat failing in the
hotel the night before, the Wolverines
were ready to play. Ohio State
opened the scoring but lost the lead
on the next possession, regained it,
then lost it for good. With UM leading
14-12. diminutive cornerback Barry
Pierson returned a punt to the three
yard line of Ohio State. Quarterback
Don Moorehead followed All Amer
ican tackle Dan Dierdorf into the end
zone fora nine-point lead that all but
slammed the door on the top-ranked
Buckeyes, who failed to score the rest
of the game.
Fans knew the game was in Michi
gan's hands when Ohio State went to

Woody Hayes' last resort — the for
ward pass. Hayes later told his stu
dent, "you beat my best team."
The crowd counted down the final
seconds, and Ufer bellowed out
"they've got Schembechler on their
shoulders. Look at the crowd. Ripley
couldn't have scripted it any better
than this!" The 24-12 victory put
Schembechler on the map and was a
validation of everything he had in
stalled — his tough spring camp, his
conservative style and his controver
sial discipline.
All this in a quaint college town
that had been invaded by the 60s —
when students at elite colleges
everywhere were burning draft
cards, smoking dope and rejecting
authority just because they could.
As conference co-champion, Michi
gan received the Rose Bowl bid, the
first of 10 trips to Pasadena for
Schembechler.
That new year began a maddening
sequence of hard-luck Rose Bowl
losses for the Wolverines, as Schem
bechler suffered a heart attack New
Year's Eve and the team lost to USC
10-3.
Under the rather byzantine rules
of the Big 10 Conference, Ohio
State would not have gone to the
Rose Bowl even if it had won (the
accursed 'no-repeat' rule), but the
upset did allow Texas, with its revo
lutionary wishbone offense, to win
the first of two consecutive national
titles. Bo finished with a record of 5-
4-1 against his mentor, but in the
words of Hayes, he would never win
a bigger game.
