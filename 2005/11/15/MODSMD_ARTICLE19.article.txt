## Wrestlers rebound from loss 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
The Stanford wrestlers had an up-and
down weekend in the Midwest, facing Mis
souri ih their opening dual meet of the sea
son on Friday and taking part in the Central
Missouri Open on Sunday. The downer
came first against Missouri, as the team lost
to the 14th ranked Tigers 32-8 in Kansas
City.
The Cardinal started strong in their reg
ular season opener, as sophomore captain
Tanner Gardner won a 14-5 major decision
over Missouri's Tim Kephart in the 125
pound weight-class. After true freshmen
Eric Minnick and Tyler Parker each fell to
their Tiger counterparts, another sopho
more, Josh Zupancic, won a second major
decision, 14-2, for the Cardinal at 149.
Sophomore Scott Loescher then suffered a
tough, 7-5 overtime loss to Missouri's

Michael Chandler, sending the meet into in
termission with the Tigers leading 10-8.
"We started off strong," Stanford head
coach Kerry McCoy said. "Tanner came
from behind for the win. then our two fresh
men went out and wrestled hard, but they
were a little out-matched. Josh got us back
on track, and that showed we had a chance."
Unfortunately, the rest of the night didn't
go nearly as well for the Cardinal wrestlers,
who failed to notch any more victories.That
didn't stop Stanford from putting up a fight,
though.
Senior captain Ray Blake put up an es
pecially strong effort at 165, losing a 9-7 de
cision to Missouri's Matt Pell immediately
following the intermission. It proved to be
the turning point of the evening, as the
Tigers followed up on the close wins with

two consecutive pins and a major de
cision.
"Ray's loss was another heart
breaker," McCoy said. "But he wres
tled hard and proved that he is in con
tention to be an Ail-American. At
174, [redshirt freshman Luke Feist]
fought hard and showed a lot of
heart, and then [senior Larry
Ozowara] showed a few moments of
greatness [at 197], but he never really
got going. [Junior lan Bork] got frus
trated early and gave up points, and it

was an uphill battle from there."
McCoy added that by redshirt
freshman Jared Boyer's match,
everyone was flat. But McCoy was
also quick to point out the positive
aspects of the tough opener, as the
Cardinal had gained quality experi
ence against a highly-ranked oppo
nent.
"It was disappointing, but come
March, we'll be better off because of
it,"he said. "We'll learn from it and
move forward. If we have a strong
showing on Sunday, then this won't
hurt us. It's tough for right now, but it
will get better."
Indeed, the Cardinal did rebound
with a strong performance on Sun
day in the Central Missouri Open, in

which six Stanford wrestlers placed.
Of those, three took first in their
class. Stanford recorded a solid 14
pins and 48 total wins in the tourna
ment. Each Cardinal wrestler took
something positive from the experi
ence's they all won at least one bout.
Stanford's first-place wrestlers —
Gardner, Blake and Zupancic —
each opened with pins, as Blake
strung together three and Gardner
two to start their days. All three went
5-0 en route to their first-place finish
es. Parker also won five bouts in a
row. but lost 1-0 to Kyle Evans of
Central Oklahoma in the final. Ju
niors Brian Perry at 165 and lan Bork
at 197 each took fifth place in their re
spective weight classes.

The weekend provided an inter
esting sample of the possibilities for
the new season. The strong rebound
the squad made after the loss to the
Tigers bodes well for its chances this
season. The meet against the Tigers
was an opportunity for the Cardinal
to test their mettle against a quality
opponent, while the Open was, as
McCoy put it, a chance to "get some
competition and just continue on
pace to be ready for the end of the
year."
While the season may be just un
derway. Stanford has already shown
some of the promise many had hoped
to see.
Next up for the Cardinal is the Cal
Open in Fullerton this Saturday.
