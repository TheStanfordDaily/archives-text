# MEN'S SOCCER
## Defeat ends season 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team
entered Edwards Stadium on Sun
day with the lofty goal of defeating
archrival No. 9 California. After a 4-
1 loss, however, the Cardinal left
Berkeley knowing that there is still
a long road ahead before their
young team can compete with the
nation's elite.
"The lesson from today is that
we can't take for granted that we
are young and improving from
week to week," head coach Bret
Simon said. "Last week, we made
some good strides but that doesn't
automatically translate into results
in the next match."
In a game that highlighted the
disparity between the two clubs, the
Golden Bears (13-3-2,6-3-1 Pacific
-10 Conference) showcased the con
ference's highest scoring offense
early and often against a Stanford
squad (4-11-3, 1-7-2) whose attack
has struggled to score all year.
A little over two minutes into
the match, Cal's junior midfielder
Andrew Jacobson lofted a corner
kick into the penalty area to junior
midfielder Eric Ebert who headed
the incoming pass into the net.
"Scoring early certainly gave
them confidence," Simon said.
"Right now, a one-goal deficit
seems like a mountain to us. It
forces us to play in ways that we
don't want to, and it exposes us to
dangerous teams."
In the 21st minute, the Bears
struck again when senior forward
Calen Carr found Jacobson two
yards outside the penalty area. Ja
cobson took a wide-open alley and
fired a 20-yard strike, which bent
back into the corner of the net away
from junior keeper Andrew Kar
tunen for Jacobsen's second point
of the game.
Even Cal's substitutions seemed
to be perfectly timed. With nearly
five minutes to go in the half, the
Bears subbed in freshman mid
fielder Pat Marion. Even though
his cleats had barely touched the
pitch, Marjon made an immediate
impact as he took a cross by junior
defender Justin Delacruz and float
ed a header between the cross bar
and Kartunen's outstretched fin
gertips.
Despite coming out with in
creased intensity at the beginning
of the second half, Stanford's de
fense still could not slow down the
potent California attack. In the
59th minute, Cal's leading play

maker hooked up with the team's
top scorer fora final time in the
2005 regular season. Sophomore
midfielder Luke Sassano notched
his team-leading seventh assist of
the year by sliding the ball across
the goalmouth to Carr. the Pac
10's leading scorer with 11 goals on
the season.
"I was just very impressed by
their play." Simon said. "They were
able to exploit weaknesses, and
they looked in absolute top form
all-around. They came out tremen
dously for their senior day."
Now up 4-0, Cal began to sub
out some of its star players to rest
and protect them for the NCAA
tournament. This peaked with
about 15 minutes left, and the near
wholesale substitution also pulled
out starting keeper senior Eric
Kronberg.
Stanford was finally able to cap
italize in the KOth minute against
this new line-up as the Cardinal
streaked down the right side and
were able to push the ball into the
middle, where freshman Tunji
Munabi knocked a five-yard score
into an open net.
Munabi. who accounted for half
of the Cardinal's six shots, nearly
netted a second goal in the waning
minutes. The freshman ran onto an
entry through-ball as a Bear de
fender chased him. As junior re
serve goalie Mike Oseguera
charged to cut off the angle,
Munabi pushed a shot just a few
feet wide right of the post.
Stanford is now forced to reflect
on a season that was filled with
growing pains. The loss marked the
last time seniors Cooper McKee,
K.C. Coyne and Bronson McDon
ald would suit up with the Cardinal.
The squad returns nearly its en
tire starting line-up next season,
with McKee being the exception —
freshman Tim Jones was added to
replace an injured Mac Donald ear
lier in the season
Stanford will try to use the off
season to patch-up its attack and
become more potent offensively
next year.
"All three of the seniors devel
oped over time into very good lead
ers and were able to do the kind of
things off the field even when they
couldn't play to help the team de
velop," Simon said. "Obviously our
goal was to be better than we were
this year on the field, even if a lot of
the things happening off the field
were very good. Certainly we im
proved on the field as well, but we
still have big strides to make."

cobson took a wide-open alley and
fired a 20-yard strike, which bent
back into the corner of the net away
from junior keeper Andrew Kar
tunen for Jacobsen's second point
of the game.
Even Cal's substitutions seemed
to be perfectly timed. With nearly
five minutes to go in the half, the
Bears subbed in freshman mid
fielder Pat Marion. Even though
his cleats had barely touched the
pitch, Marjon made an immediate
impact as he took a cross by junior
defender Justin Delacruz and float
ed a header between the cross bar
and Kartunen's outstretched fin
gertips.
Despite coming out with in
creased intensity at the beginning
of the second half, Stanford's de
fense still could not slow down the
potent California attack. In the
59th minute, Cal's leading play

maker hooked up with the team's
top scorer fora final time in the
2005 regular season. Sophomore
midfielder Luke Sassano notched
his team-leading seventh assist of
the year by sliding the ball across
the goalmouth to Carr. the Pac
10's leading scorer with 11 goals on
the season.
"I was just very impressed by
their play." Simon said. "They were
able to exploit weaknesses, and
they looked in absolute top form
all-around. They came out tremen
dously for their senior day."
Now up 4-0, Cal began to sub
out some of its star players to rest
and protect them for the NCAA
tournament. This peaked with
about 15 minutes left, and the near
wholesale substitution also pulled
out starting keeper senior Eric
Kronberg.
Stanford was finally able to cap
italize in the KOth minute against
this new line-up as the Cardinal
streaked down the right side and
were able to push the ball into the
middle, where freshman Tunji
Munabi knocked a five-yard score
into an open net.
Munabi. who accounted for half
of the Cardinal's six shots, nearly
netted a second goal in the waning
minutes. The freshman ran onto an
entry through-ball as a Bear de
fender chased him. As junior re
serve goalie Mike Oseguera
charged to cut off the angle,
Munabi pushed a shot just a few
feet wide right of the post.
Stanford is now forced to reflect
on a season that was filled with
growing pains. The loss marked the
last time seniors Cooper McKee,
K.C. Coyne and Bronson McDon
ald would suit up with the Cardinal.
The squad returns nearly its en
tire starting line-up next season,
with McKee being the exception —
freshman Tim Jones was added to
replace an injured Mac Donald ear
lier in the season
Stanford will try to use the off
season to patch-up its attack and
become more potent offensively
next year.
"All three of the seniors devel
oped over time into very good lead
ers and were able to do the kind of
things off the field even when they
couldn't play to help the team de
velop," Simon said. "Obviously our
goal was to be better than we were
this year on the field, even if a lot of
the things happening off the field
were very good. Certainly we im
proved on the field as well, but we
still have big strides to make."

Senior midfielder Cooper McKee makes his mark on the ball in a recent game. McKee was one of three seniors who
participated in their final game for the Cardinal in the 4-1 loss at Berkeley.
The Stanford men's soccer team
entered Edwards Stadium on Sun
day with the lofty goal of defeating
archrival No. 9 California. After a 4-
1 loss, however, the Cardinal left
Berkeley knowing that there is still
a long road ahead before their
young team can compete with the
nation's elite.
"The lesson from today is that
we can't take for granted that we
are young and improving from
week to week," head coach Bret
Simon said. "Last week, we made
some good strides but that doesn't
automatically translate into results
in the next match."
In a game that highlighted the
disparity between the two clubs, the
Golden Bears (13-3-2,6-3-1 Pacific
-10 Conference) showcased the con
ference's highest scoring offense
early and often against a Stanford
squad (4-11-3, 1-7-2) whose attack
has struggled to score all year.
A little over two minutes into
the match, Cal's junior midfielder
Andrew Jacobson lofted a corner
kick into the penalty area to junior
midfielder Eric Ebert who headed
the incoming pass into the net.
"Scoring early certainly gave
them confidence," Simon said.
"Right now, a one-goal deficit
seems like a mountain to us. It
forces us to play in ways that we
don't want to, and it exposes us to
dangerous teams."
In the 21st minute, the Bears
struck again when senior forward
Calen Carr found Jacobson two
yards outside the penalty area. Ja
cobson took a wide-open alley and
fired a 20-yard strike, which bent
back into the corner of the net away

tunen for Jacobsen's second point
