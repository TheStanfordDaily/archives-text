## Cardinal dump Cal Poly in final tuneup 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If the Sixth Man Club hadn't been in
full attendance in a half-empty and sud
denly small-seeming Maples Pavilion, the
Cardinal's exhibition game against Divi
sion 111 Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday
would have felt more like a practice.
As it was, head coach Trent Johnson
took the opportunity to tinker with the
roster in Stanford's final tune-up before
the games start counting. He used all 13
players, and most of his combinations
seemed to work fine against Bronco head
coach Greg Kamansky's overmatched
squad. Ilie Cardinal coasted to a 99-70
victory.
Johnson started junior Jason Haas at
point guard and sophomore Taj linger at
power forward. I laas,one of three players
who Johnson says will get consistent play
ing time at the shooting guard position,
along with junior Tim Morris and fresh
man Mitch Johnson, played smoothly.
Finger, meanwhile, injected his usual
burst of energy, scoring Stanford's first
four points on a lay-up and a dunk on his
way to 10 points.
"I liked starting Taj because he doesn't
make a lot of mistakes," Johnson said.
"He's ready to play on offense, which is
the difference between this year and last
year, and he's a good defensive player."
The Cardinal ran away with the game
early in the first half, going on a 20-4 run
over a five-minute span. The lead grew to
24 points, but Cal Poly cut it to 48-31 by
the end of the period.
Junior forward Fred Washington
poured in 17 points, often straddling the
line between acrobatic and out-of-control
but usually drawing a foul for his efforts.
He made two sensational layups in the
first half, falling to the floor after being
fouled each time, and sunk all nine of his
attempts from the line. Washington and
Johnson had spoken of having trouble
communicating last year, but they seem to
have developed a better understanding.
