## Cardinal dump Cal Poly in final tuneup 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If the Sixth Man Club hadn't been in
full attendance in a half-empty and sud
denly small-seeming Maples Pavilion, the
Cardinal's exhibition game against Divi
sion 111 Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday
would have felt more like a practice.
As it was, head coach Trent Johnson
took the opportunity to tinker with the
roster in Stanford's final tune-up before
the games start counting. He used all 13
players, and most of his combinations
seemed to work fine against Bronco head
coach Greg Kamansky's overmatched
squad. Ilie Cardinal coasted to a 99-70
victory.
Johnson started junior Jason Haas at
point guard and sophomore Taj linger at
power forward. I laas,one of three players
who Johnson says will get consistent play
ing time at the shooting guard position,
along with junior Tim Morris and fresh
man Mitch Johnson, played smoothly.
Finger, meanwhile, injected his usual
burst of energy, scoring Stanford's first
four points on a lay-up and a dunk on his
way to 10 points.
"I liked starting Taj because he doesn't
make a lot of mistakes," Johnson said.
"He's ready to play on offense, which is
the difference between this year and last
year, and he's a good defensive player."
The Cardinal ran away with the game
early in the first half, going on a 20-4 run
over a five-minute span. The lead grew to
24 points, but Cal Poly cut it to 48-31 by
the end of the period.
Junior forward Fred Washington
poured in 17 points, often straddling the
line between acrobatic and out-of-control
but usually drawing a foul for his efforts.
He made two sensational layups in the
first half, falling to the floor after being
fouled each time, and sunk all nine of his
attempts from the line. Washington and
Johnson had spoken of having trouble
communicating last year, but they seem to
have developed a better understanding.

Freshman guard Mitch Johnson drives strong to the hoop in Stanford's impressive victory over
Division 111 Cal Poly Pomona this past Saturdgy.
"We finally got to know each
other, and we're on the same page
now," Washington said. When asked
what Johnson expects from a player
when he's on the same page with him.
Washington half-joked. "He expects
you to be perfect."
Johnson also expects Washington
to log more minutes at the power for
ward position, a role shared by
Haryasz and the departed Nick
Robinson last year.
"I like the change," Washington
said. "A lot of guys like a little change
of pace. We have a lot of flexibility;
guys can play a lot of different posi
tions. That will make it hard for other
teams to lock us up."
This squad does seem to be deeper
than last year's, which was further de

pleted by injury. Finger. Washington
and freshman Lawrence Hill should
all spend time at power forward.
Tlie return of Morris from aca
demic suspension also adds depth at
guard. He looked smooth and confi
dent Saturday, scoring 13 points on
five of seven shooting from the field.
Both Morris and Washington
were on the floor to start the second
half along with seniors Matt
Haryasz, Chris Hernandez and Dan
Grunfeld, and they compose the
starting five that Johnson will likely
go with once the season begins. Stan
ford's regular rotation took control
of the game, extending the lead to
84-49 with nine minutes to play and
giving themselves a well-deserved
rest as they were replaced by the
second unit.
Grunfeld attacked the basket in
his second game back after recover
ing from a torn right ACL, showing
signs of rust but not hesitation, mak
ing only two of his seven field goal at

tempts, but recovering quickly after
being knocked hard to the floor on
two occasions. Grunfeld also dis
played some of his signature creativ
ity and basketball know-how,
snaking to the hoop several times
and throwing a heads-up alley-oop
to Haryasz on an inbound from be
hind the board.
Haryasz, meanwhile, dominated
the second half, playing like the inside
force he needs to be on a team that
starts the 6-foot-5 Washington at
power forward. Haryasz, who is 6-
foot-11, was often four inches taller
than anyone else on the floor and he
took advantage of that fact, making
six layups or dunks in the second half
on his way to a team-high 21 points.
Haryasz's energetic play some
times leads him into foul trouble, but
on Saturday, he and Washington
helped to foul out four Broncos. He
converted five of his six free throws
and the team made 34 of 44 — a sign
that the team has improved from its

sometimes shaky performance at the
line last year.
Stanford also seemed to be coming
together on defense, though not as
rapidly as on the offensive side of the
ball. The Cardinal point guard often
picked up the Bronco ballhandler at
full court, and Stanford's tactic of a
trapping defense helped to cause 23
turnovers.
But Stanford could not stop Cal
Poly s Dion Cook, who made four of
seven three-pointers and notched a
game-high 26 points — most of them
when Hernandez, the Cardinal's best
perimeter defender, was watching
from the sideline.
The game seemed to indicate that
Stanford is ready to begin the regular
season. Johnson, however, was con
cerned with more basic matters.
"We were able to get through two
exhibitions, and we're healthy," he
said.
If the team stays that way, it could
be a promising season.
