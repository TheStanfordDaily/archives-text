# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Men end two game slide with convincing 14-6 win Card emerge victorious over UC-Santa Barbara on Saturday 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Hoping to end their longest losing streak in the
last three years, the members of the No. 4 Stanford
men's water polo team rebounded with just the
performance they were looking for in a 14-6 win
over UC-Santa Barbara on Saturday afternoon.
The length of the Cardinal s losing streak stood
at a mere two games as the squad entered its
matchup against the No. 14 Gauchos; but fora
group of players who demand perfection every
time they jump in the pool, two games without a
win was more than long enough.
Despite facing a squad ranked 10 spots below
them in the national rankings, the Cardinal (16-5,4-
2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) did not un

derestimate the visiting Gauchos. Last weekend,
the Santa Barbara men came within minutes of
pulling off the biggest upset of the season in a nar
row 7-6 loss to No. 2 California. In their final tune
up before coming to the Farm, the Gauchos posted
an authoritative 10-3 victory over No. 10 Loyola
Marymount. In preparation for the match, Stan
ford made good note of those two particular per
formances as it readied itself for the Gauchos.
"(The Santa Barbara team] came in playing
well,so we approached them the way we would any
top five team." senior captain Thomas Hopkins
said.
That approach worked for the Cardinal, as they
jumped out to an early lead in the first period and
never looked back. Hopkins, sophomore two
meter Michael Bury and senior captain Peter
Varellas all scored within the opening minutes of
play to put Stanford ahead, and by the end of the
period the Cardinal held a 4-2 lead.
A dominant 6-1 Stanford run in the second pe

riod effectively put the game out of reach for the
overwhelmed Santa Barbara squad, and the Cardi
nal went on to cruise to their eighth consecutive
home victory this season. Varellas paced the Stan
ford offense with an impressive five goals and Bury
recorded a hat-trick while Hopkins and freshman
two-meter Will Hindle-Katel both netted two tal
lies on the day. In goal, freshman Jimmy Sandman
and junior Beau Stockstill combined to produce
seven saves.
In addition to remaining undefeated at home on
the season, the Cardinal also took a critical step to
ward regaining the momentum they lost two week
ends ago in back-to-back losses to top-ranked
Southern California and No. 6 UC-Irvine. Those
two losses together constituted the longest Stan
ford losing streak since 2003, when the Cardinal
dropped consecutive decisions to Cal and USC.
The Cardinal's regained rhythm and confidence
will likely prove to be a key factor as the Stanford
men head into the regular season finale against the
Golden Bears this weekend.
"We're always focused on sticking to our game
plan and playing smart team water polo," sopho
more two-meter defender Peter Finlayson said.
"We did that versus USC, despite the outcome of
the game, but we got away from it a bit against
Irvine. But now we've had the chance to refocus
and get our momentum back."
Additionally, Stanford has had a chance to re
cover from the most grueling stretch of its season,
where it played four of the top six teams in the na
tion within a span of 10 days.
"Going into our weekend against USC and
Irvine, we were still a little bit broken-down from
the weekend before versus UCLA and Pepper
dine," said Hopkins. "So this last week we had the
chance to rest up and get ready for Santa Barbara
and the end of the year."
From this point on, Stanford needs to play near
perfect water polo in order to realize its hopes of
bringing a national championship back to the
Farm. After their showdown this weekend against
the Bears, the Cardinal head south to Malibu,
Calif., for the MPSF conference tournament.
There, they will need to reach the tournament title
game in order to earn a bid to the NCAA champi
onship tournament.
"It's going to be a tough road," Hopkins said.
"We're going to be playing two teams arguably
among the top five in the league, so we're going to
have to give our all in every one of our games."
But all year long, the Cardinal have risen to the
occasion when faced with adversity. And given the
cohesive nature of this year's team, there isn't a sin
gle member of the Cardinal squad who views this
final challenge as insurmountable.
"The advantage we have is that we play well as
a team," Finlayson said. "We have everyone on our
squad playing for each other, so with our intelli
gence and experience, we know we can beat any
one out there."

Additionally, Stanford has had a chance to re
cover from the most grueling stretch of its season,
where it played four of the top six teams in the na
tion within a span of 10 days.
"Going into our weekend against USC and
Irvine, we were still a little bit broken-down from
the weekend before versus UCLA and Pepper
dine," said Hopkins. "So this last week we had the
chance to rest up and get ready for Santa Barbara
and the end of the year."
From this point on, Stanford needs to play near
perfect water polo in order to realize its hopes of
bringing a national championship back to the
Farm. After their showdown this weekend against
the Bears, the Cardinal head south to Malibu,
Calif., for the MPSF conference tournament.
There, they will need to reach the tournament title
game in order to earn a bid to the NCAA champi
onship tournament.
"It's going to be a tough road," Hopkins said.
"We're going to be playing two teams arguably
among the top five in the league, so we're going to
have to give our all in every one of our games."
But all year long, the Cardinal have risen to the
occasion when faced with adversity. And given the
cohesive nature of this year's team, there isn't a sin
gle member of the Cardinal squad who views this
final challenge as insurmountable.
"The advantage we have is that we play well as
a team," Finlayson said. "We have everyone on our
squad playing for each other, so with our intelli
gence and experience, we know we can beat any
one out there."

Freshman two-meter Will Hindle-Katel aims a shot at the goal in Saturday's 14-6 victory over UC-Santa
Barbara. Hindle-Katel was one of two scorers in the third quarter, helping Stanford ensure the victory.
Hoping to end their longest losing streak in the
last three years, the members of the No. 4 Stanford
men's water polo team rebounded with just the
performance they were looking for in a 14-6 win
over UC-Santa Barbara on Saturday afternoon.
The length of the Cardinal s losing streak stood
at a mere two games as the squad entered its
matchup against the No. 14 Gauchos; but fora
group of players who demand perfection every
time they jump in the pool, two games without a
win was more than long enough.
Despite facing a squad ranked 10 spots below
them in the national rankings, the Cardinal (16-5,4-
2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) did not un

derestimate the visiting Gauchos. Last weekend,
the Santa Barbara men came within minutes of
pulling off the biggest upset of the season in a nar
row 7-6 loss to No. 2 California. In their final tune
up before coming to the Farm, the Gauchos posted
an authoritative 10-3 victory over No. 10 Loyola
Marymount. In preparation for the match, Stan
ford made good note of those two particular per
formances as it readied itself for the Gauchos.
"(The Santa Barbara team] came in playing
well,so we approached them the way we would any
top five team." senior captain Thomas Hopkins
said.
That approach worked for the Cardinal, as they
jumped out to an early lead in the first period and
never looked back. Hopkins, sophomore two
meter Michael Bury and senior captain Peter
Varellas all scored within the opening minutes of
play to put Stanford ahead, and by the end of the
period the Cardinal held a 4-2 lead.
A dominant 6-1 Stanford run in the second pe

riod effectively put the game out of reach for the
overwhelmed Santa Barbara squad, and the Cardi
nal went on to cruise to their eighth consecutive
home victory this season. Varellas paced the Stan
ford offense with an impressive five goals and Bury
recorded a hat-trick while Hopkins and freshman
two-meter Will Hindle-Katel both netted two tal
lies on the day. In goal, freshman Jimmy Sandman
and junior Beau Stockstill combined to produce
seven saves.
In addition to remaining undefeated at home on
the season, the Cardinal also took a critical step to
ward regaining the momentum they lost two week
ends ago in back-to-back losses to top-ranked
Southern California and No. 6 UC-Irvine. Those
two losses together constituted the longest Stan
ford losing streak since 2003, when the Cardinal
dropped consecutive decisions to Cal and USC.
The Cardinal's regained rhythm and confidence
will likely prove to be a key factor as the Stanford
men head into the regular season finale against the
Golden Bears this weekend.
"We're always focused on sticking to our game
plan and playing smart team water polo," sopho
more two-meter defender Peter Finlayson said.
"We did that versus USC, despite the outcome of
the game, but we got away from it a bit against
Irvine. But now we've had the chance to refocus
and get our momentum back."
