scores were good for the 21st and 26th positions
following the preliminary competition.

In the three-meter platform event, Krug was
the sole place-winner, ultimately placing fourth
among a strong group of divers with a final
score of 248.40. Meanwhile, Arizona's Manning
took the top position, scoring 269.95.
