## Card take part in Match Play Championships 
### DEVIN MARSH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This past weekend, the Stanford
women's golf team traveled to Flori
da to compete in the Collegiate
Match Play Championships, one of
the most prestigious events on the
women's golf calendar.
The three-day event pitched 16
teams against each other in Match
Play Tournament format, where in
stead of competing to get the best
mark against the course, golfers
compete directly against the golfers
on the other team. Seeds for the
tournament were allotted based on
the order of finish from the 2005
NCAA championships.
On the first day, the 10th seeded
Cardinal faced off against seventh
seeded Tennessee, which was led by
sophomore Marci Ihrner and fresh
man Nicole Smith. Stanford came
off strong, as senior Kelly Husted,
junior Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
and freshman Mari Chun won their
individual matchups against Ten
nessee. Led by their the trio's strong
play, the Cardinal pulled off the
upset over the No. 15 Lady Vols and
were able to move on to the second
round of play where they were
matched up against second-seeded
Purdue.
Purdue, ranked fourth in the na
tion, had just defeated Oklahoma
State 3-2 in the first round. Against
Purdue, Husted was the only golfer
to win her individual matchup, de
feating the Boilermakers' Christel
Boeljon by two strokes.
Tangtiphaiboontana, Chun, jun
ior Lauren Todd and freshman Ki-
Shui Liao lost their matchups
against the talent-laden Purdue

team. Purdue proceeded to beat
Texas A& M and Arizona State on its
way to winning the tournament.
After the tough loss to Purdue,
Stanford moved toward the consola
tion bracket, where it squared off
against the No. 3 seed Arkansas,
which was led by senior Amanda
McCurdy, sophomore Stacy Lewis
and freshman Lucy Nunn. The Car
dinal played well, with Chun and
Husted winning their individual
matchups against Razorback seniors
Courtney Mahon and Sarah Trew,
but Stanford ultimately lost 3-2
against the No. 9 Arkansas squad.
The 16-team field proved to be
incredibly competitive, with five top
10 ranked teams and 12 of the top 25
ranked teams competing. Three of
Stanford's ranked Pacific-10 Con
ference rivals — Arizona State,
UCLA and Southern California —
were in attendance, with second
seeded UCLA leading the pack.
All four Pac-10 teams won their
first round matchups, leading way to
some key late round Pac-10 show
downs. Arizona State faced off
against fifth seeded USC in the sec
ond round, playing & close match
that came down to tie breakers, and
the Sun Devils ultimately ending up
victorious. Arizona State then
turned in the biggest upset of the
tournament when it defeated
UCLA in dominant fashion, 4-1.
ASU then lost in the finals to Purdue
3-1-1. UCLA went on to win the
third-place match 4-1 against Texas
A&M.
With the fall season over, the
Cardinal resume competition Feb.
13 at the Northrop Grunman Re
gional Challenge in Palos Verdes
Estates, Calif.
