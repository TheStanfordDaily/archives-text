## TECHNOLOGY Open-source sprints for five days Programmers gather in Santa Clara to develop new technology 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
Last week 20 open-source gurus from around the
world gathered in Santa Clara fora coding "sprint" to im
prove technology publicly available to businesses and in
dividuals in the programming community.
The five-day coding extravaganza was organized by
Cignex, an open-source services company that helps
businesses choose and implement the new technology.
This year's sprint focused on the improvement of a con
tent management system called Plone.
"Cignex has brought about 20 of the top software de
velopers from companies all over the world here to Santa
Clara with one goal in mind: to accomplish more than a
month's worth of work in five days," explained Navin Na
giah, chief executive officer of Cignex.
Open-source software refers to the source code avail
ability of computer software under an open-source li
cense for the purposes of modification, improvement and
study. The Linux operating system is open-source, as are
many widely-used compilers and the popular Internet
browser Mozilla Firefox.
Bringing top coders together was the capstone event
of Cignex's Goldegg initiative, which funds simultaneous
work on multiple layers of an existing open source soft
ware stack.
"Cignex is hosting this event because our mission is to
help businesses improve by using open-source technolo

gies," Nagiah said.
Among others, Plone manages Web sites for e√üay,
NASA. German airline Lufthansa and the non-govern
mental organization Oxfam. It is also the framework for
the Burning Man community site, which organizes more
than 30,000 people per year for the annual Burning Man
festival in Nevada. Included among the attendees were
several widely known open-source gurus, including Paul
Everitt, executive director of the Plone Foundation and
co-founder of the Zope Corporation, an open-source ap
plication server for building systems and applications;
Rob Miller, who masterminded Plone's use as a collabo
ration tool for Burning Man; Joel Burton.chairman of the
board of the Plone Foundation; and renowned Zope pro
grammer Michel Pelletier.
Unlike Google's coder challenge, the Cignex sprint is
not a competition between coders, and there is no money
prize. Instead, companies that traditionally compete
against one another joined forces to improve open source
technology for the enterprise.
"It's kind of weird to think that these volunteers
would pay their own airfare to get here and work for free
for five days, but that's the way it works," Everitt ex
plained. "The value that gets produced at a place like this,
and the chance to get to sit down with Cignex, which is
one of the biggest integrators for Plone in the world, is a
great opportunity."
Everitt said that participants considered open-source
methods as a way of "scratching your own itch."
"I lere, we have to try to balance the idea of going in a
single direction and having a clear focus with volunteer
