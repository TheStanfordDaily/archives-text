In the article "Deterrence a
failure for India, Pakistan ex
plains professor," published
Thursday, Nov. 10,The Daily inac
curately reported that the Center
for International Security and Co
operation was at Claremont
McKenna College.
In fact, the Center is located at
Stanford. In yesterday's article,
"Thanksgiving dinner to be served
on campus," The Daily inaccurate
ly reported that the event would
be staffed entirely by volunteers.
In fact, Stanford Dining employ
ees will be cooking and preparing
for the meal.
