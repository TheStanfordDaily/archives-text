## Gender can determine humor

Two atoms walk into a bar (why
is it always a bar?). One turns to the
other and says,"l think I lost an elec
tron!" The other replies, "Are you
sure?"
"Yes, I'm positive."
It might be the worst joke ever,
but if you're a man, you took longer
to decide that it was unfunny than a
woman would. This difference be
tween the sexes is just one of the
findings of a study performed by
Stanford researchers.
Published recently in the Na
tional Academy of Sciences and led
by Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences Prof. Alan Reiss, the study
was the first to examine how men
and women respond to humor dif
ferently by monitoring brain re
sponses. Researchers found that
women displayed more activity in
the parts of the brain involved with
language processing and feelings of
reward when shown a funny car
toon.
In the study, 10 females and 10
males were placed in a high-field
magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scanner and shown 70
black-and-white cartoons on a
screen. They then pressed one of
two buttons on a nearby box to ex
press whether they found the car
toon funny or not. The scanner
measured the subjects' brain activi
ty as they looked at the cartoons, al
lowing researchers to study how
brains respond to humor.
Past studies have shown that re
sponses to humor consist of two
parts — getting the joke and then
enjoying the hilarity.These steps are
associated with brain activity in the
prefrontal cortex and the nucleus
accumbens, which are in turn associ
ated with language processing and
feelings of pleasure, respectively.

While men and women displayed
similar responses to humor in most
regions of the brain, the new study
found that responses in those two
areas differ in men and women.
Women showed more activity
than men in their prefrontal cortex,
which controls in-depth analytical
processes and language interpreta
tion. Reiss explained that this dif
ference demonstrates that "women
may take a more discriminating ap
proach to the features of a car
toon." He also noted that although
women and men found the same
cartoons funny, women were faster
than men at deciding whether a car
toon was funny. He surmised that
women's greater analytical brain
activity contributed to this faster
decision-making.
The sexes also differed in brain
activity in the nucleus accumbens,
which is highly involved in response
to humor. Women responded to
funny cartoons with increased ac
tivity in the nucleus accumbens and
maintained normal activity with
unfunny cartoons. Men maintained
normal activity in response to
funny cartoons and decreased ac
tivity in response to unfunny car
toons, a pattern similar to non
human primates.
Reiss speculated that expecta
tions could explain the difference.
"Unexpected humor produces a
more intense response in brain ac
tivity, because you want to get some
thing more ingrained when it is un
expected," he said. "The results
imply that females experience
greater activity in the nucleus ac
cumbens because they don't expect
the cartoons to be as funny. Males
expect the cartoons to be funny, so
they don't increase activity if they
find the cartoons to be funny but dip
if they don't find the cartoon as
funny as expected."

In addition to determining dif
ferences between the sexes, the
study's findings could also have clin
ical applications. The different re
sponses to humor in men and
women may explain why women
are more likely than men to suffer
from depression.
"Women's depression could
stem from greater sensitivity to
stimuli; their reward centers are
more geared to receiving emotional
stimuli, causing a greater risk of de
pression," Reiss said.
"It's been well-documented that
women tend to experience symp
toms of depression twice as much as
men," said Eiman Azim, Class of
2(X)3, who also conducted the study.
"This type of questioning might
help us understand why emotive
processing in women is different,
and why they experience depres
sion differently."
The study could also assist stud
ies of cataplexy, a condition in which
people lose voluntary motor control
when exposed to strong emotional
stimuli.
"Humor is the most potent pre
cipitant of cataplexy," Reiss said, "so
having a template of humor re
sponses in people without cataplexy
will help us understand what causes
cataplexy."
He noted that the findings of the
humor study would assist Em
manuel Mignot, another Stanford
researcher, in his studies of nar
colepsy, one type of cataplexy.
But even if the study does not ad
vance the study of depression and
cataplexy, it still remains valuable in
its own right.
"We can better understand the
individual differences in style and
perception of humor," Reiss said.
"Humor is a good vehicle for com
munication, which is why funny
people are well-accepted."

may take a more discriminating ap
proach to the features of a car
toon." He also noted that although
women and men found the same
cartoons funny, women were faster
than men at deciding whether a car
toon was funny. He surmised that
women's greater analytical brain
activity contributed to this faster
decision-making.
The sexes also differed in brain
activity in the nucleus accumbens,
which is highly involved in response
to humor. Women responded to
funny cartoons with increased ac
tivity in the nucleus accumbens and
maintained normal activity with
unfunny cartoons. Men maintained
normal activity in response to
funny cartoons and decreased ac
tivity in response to unfunny car
toons, a pattern similar to non
human primates.
Reiss speculated that expecta
tions could explain the difference.
"Unexpected humor produces a
more intense response in brain ac
tivity, because you want to get some
thing more ingrained when it is un
expected," he said. "The results
imply that females experience
greater activity in the nucleus ac
cumbens because they don't expect
the cartoons to be as funny. Males
expect the cartoons to be funny, so
they don't increase activity if they
find the cartoons to be funny but dip
if they don't find the cartoon as
funny as expected."

In addition to determining dif
ferences between the sexes, the
study's findings could also have clin
ical applications. The different re
sponses to humor in men and
women may explain why women
are more likely than men to suffer
from depression.
"Women's depression could
stem from greater sensitivity to
stimuli; their reward centers are
more geared to receiving emotional
stimuli, causing a greater risk of de
pression," Reiss said.
"It's been well-documented that
women tend to experience symp
toms of depression twice as much as
men," said Eiman Azim, Class of
2(X)3, who also conducted the study.
"This type of questioning might
help us understand why emotive
processing in women is different,
and why they experience depres
sion differently."
The study could also assist stud
ies of cataplexy, a condition in which
people lose voluntary motor control
when exposed to strong emotional
stimuli.
"Humor is the most potent pre
cipitant of cataplexy," Reiss said, "so
having a template of humor re
sponses in people without cataplexy
will help us understand what causes
cataplexy."
He noted that the findings of the
humor study would assist Em
manuel Mignot, another Stanford
researcher, in his studies of nar
colepsy, one type of cataplexy.
But even if the study does not ad
vance the study of depression and
cataplexy, it still remains valuable in
its own right.
"We can better understand the
individual differences in style and
perception of humor," Reiss said.
"Humor is a good vehicle for com
munication, which is why funny
people are well-accepted."

Two atoms walk into a bar (why
is it always a bar?). One turns to the
other and says,"l think I lost an elec

sure?"
"Yes, I'm positive."
It might be the worst joke ever,
but if you're a man, you took longer
to decide that it was unfunny than a
woman would. This difference be
tween the sexes is just one of the
findings of a study performed by
Stanford researchers.
Published recently in the Na
tional Academy of Sciences and led
by Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences Prof. Alan Reiss, the study
was the first to examine how men
and women respond to humor dif
ferently by monitoring brain re
sponses. Researchers found that
women displayed more activity in
the parts of the brain involved with
language processing and feelings of
reward when shown a funny car
toon.
In the study, 10 females and 10
males were placed in a high-field
magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scanner and shown 70
black-and-white cartoons on a
screen. They then pressed one of
two buttons on a nearby box to ex
press whether they found the car
toon funny or not. The scanner
measured the subjects' brain activi
ty as they looked at the cartoons, al
lowing researchers to study how
brains respond to humor.
Past studies have shown that re
sponses to humor consist of two
parts — getting the joke and then
enjoying the hilarity.These steps are
associated with brain activity in the
prefrontal cortex and the nucleus
accumbens, which are in turn associ
ated with language processing and
feelings of pleasure, respectively.

While men and women displayed
similar responses to humor in most
regions of the brain, the new study
found that responses in those two
areas differ in men and women.
Women showed more activity
than men in their prefrontal cortex,
which controls in-depth analytical
processes and language interpreta
tion. Reiss explained that this dif
ference demonstrates that "women
may take a more discriminating ap
proach to the features of a car
toon." He also noted that although
women and men found the same
cartoons funny, women were faster
