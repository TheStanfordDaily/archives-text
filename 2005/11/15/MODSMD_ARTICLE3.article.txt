## Architects finally claim new major 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After nearly 20 years as a minor
or track of another department,
the architecture program at Stan
ford has finally found a home.This
month, it became a full-fledged
major with a brand new 700-
square-foot studio in the Terman
Engineering Building equipped
with and 20 workstations.
"There has been enough inter
est from students and enough sup
port from the School of Engineer
ing that we were able to create a
separate major, rather than just
being a track," said Patti Walters,
director of the new Architectural
Design major. "There used to be a
minor for Architectural Engineer
ing offered by the Engineering
school. That minor eventually be
came this new major, which is still
hosted by the Department of En
vironmental and Civil Engineer
ing."
The curriculum will focus on
three primary themes; representa
tion, process and sustainability.
Students will take courses in draw
ing, modeling, computer modeling
and oral presentation. Classes will
follow the design process of an ar
chitect and study the creative
process in a hands-on and open
ended way. However, being co
housed by the Environmental En
gineering department, it's no sur
prise that there will also be a heavy
emphasis on "green" architecture.
"We want to build not only
nice-looking, exciting and innova
tive buildings," Walters said, "but
we also want them to be sustain
able-
Administrators said they hope
that students who complete this
program for their bachelor's de
gree will be well-prepared for fu
ture training in the field.
"It's good preparation for ar
chitectural graduate school, but
it's still a liberal arts course," Wal
ters said. "It's important that some
one could not leave here and work
in architecture â€” there is additional
training necessary."
There are also opportunities for
collaboration between related de
partments.
"The major really crosses the line
between architecture and engineer
ing; a student from our program
could do very well in graduate-level
engineering as well," Walters said.
"There are enough math and sci
ence courses to consider our major
as being merged strongly with that
of engineering."
Prior to the conception of this
major. Walters said, there really was
only one track for "artsy techies" to
go down.
"Before our creation, product
design was really the only option for
more creative engineering stu
dents," Walters explained. "When I
talk to students and they are inter
ested in going down a creative track,
it's exciting because there are two
tracks now. We want to nurture that
individual who is interested in more
creative courses."

Interest among undergraduates
has been very high. More than 4() stu
dents came to the department's open
house, and there are already 14 en
rolled in the major. All this despite the
fact that the degree is not accredited.
"It's a good fit between my cre
ative brain and my math/science
brain," interested sophomore Alex
Gioe explained in a recent issue of
the Stanford Report.
Though the major has been inau
gurated, the minor still exists. It will
offer courses along the same lines as
the major, only with less of an em
phasis on preparation fora profes
sional career.
"The architecture minor is ap
propriate for individuals from a
wide variety of other majors," Wal
ters said. "The minor is not like a
baby major. It's not shooting for the
same thing."
In addition to the minor, a con
centration in architecture will be of
fered in civil engineering. The con
centration will allow engineering
students to get some exposure to the
hands-on. process-oriented design
classes that are typical for the field.
Students and faculty alike seem
to agree that this is certainly a step
forward for the University.
"It's a terrific major," Walters
said. "We're really excited about
what's going on."
