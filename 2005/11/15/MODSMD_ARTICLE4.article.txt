## Students take back Cal bases 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The rivalry between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley was unleashed last week in
anticipation of Saturday's Big Game
when groups of Stanford students recap
tured several baseball home plates lost to
a Cal fraternity, turned a Cal fountain
bright cardinal and painted red the letter
C on a Bear hillside.
Many bases have been stolen from
Stanford's Sunken Diamond, the base
ball stadium, in the past decade, accord
ing to a participant in last week's incident
who asked to remain anonymous. He told
The Daily that he and three other under
graduate students decided to bring back
the bases after receiving information that
they were kept at the Phi Kappa Tao fra
ternity in Berkeley.
