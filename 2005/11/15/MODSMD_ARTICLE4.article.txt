## Students take back Cal bases 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The rivalry between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley was unleashed last week in
anticipation of Saturday's Big Game
when groups of Stanford students recap
tured several baseball home plates lost to
a Cal fraternity, turned a Cal fountain
bright cardinal and painted red the letter
C on a Bear hillside.
Many bases have been stolen from
Stanford's Sunken Diamond, the base
ball stadium, in the past decade, accord
ing to a participant in last week's incident
who asked to remain anonymous. He told
The Daily that he and three other under
graduate students decided to bring back
the bases after receiving information that
they were kept at the Phi Kappa Tao fra
ternity in Berkeley.
Rivalry!

He said one of his affiliates entered the fraternity
last Thursday night, claiming to visit a friend who was
drunk and found the home plates hung in one of the
rooms. The group then furtively removed the plates
from the wall and stashed them in their car before they
were discovered by members of the fraternity
The student refused to say what they planned to do
next with the home plates, whose surfaces are now
covered with signatures and graffiti from the fraterni
ty, but he said he is likely to return them to the Athlet
ic Department eventually.
Stanford students pulled more pranks on their
nemesis on Friday, when another group spent $100 on
Kool-Aid and poured all the powder into the "1914
Fountain" on Berkeley's campus. The water turned
bright red within five minutes, the anonymous student
said.
The same group later attempted to recolor the let
ter C on the grassy hillside near Bowles Hall, the par
ticipant said. Three-quarters of the letter had been
sprayed from yellow to red when they had to flee be
cause some Cal students discovered the action and
were calling the police.
Although the mission was not fully accomplished, the
student seemed content with his groups' achievements,
"The rivalry [between Stanford and Cal] has been
pretty one-sided," he said, referring to the lack of re
sponse on Stanford's part to Berkeley's repeated
pranks. "The Cal kids are the ones who really care
about the rivalry. But we decided to get back at them
this year."
