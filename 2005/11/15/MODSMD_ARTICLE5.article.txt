As we sit here, people are dying in Darfur.
â€” RET. MARINE CAPTAIN BRIAN STEIDLE

A retired Marine captain who recently
spent six months as a ceasefire monitor with
the African Union force in Darfur shocked a
full lecture hall in the Geology Corner last
night with horrifying details of what he calls
an ongoing government-sponsored genocide.
The event was organized by Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND) and was co
sponsored by seven other student groups.
Captain Brian Steidle described his expe
riences as he said he watched powerlessly as
the government of Sudan or its proxies
killed and displaced tens of thousands of in
nocent civilians in mass attacks on villages.
As an unarmed U.S. State Department ob
server, he could do nothing but document
the mass killings in Darfur, a region the size
of Texas.
"All I was there to do was take their pic
tures, write down their names, write reports
and move on," he said, explaining that sur
vivors of the attacks he came to document
thought he was a doctor and cried for his as
sistance. "That's all we did every single day
for six months."
