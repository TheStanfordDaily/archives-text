As we sit here, people are dying in Darfur.
— RET. MARINE CAPTAIN BRIAN STEIDLE

A retired Marine captain who recently
spent six months as a ceasefire monitor with
the African Union force in Darfur shocked a
full lecture hall in the Geology Corner last
night with horrifying details of what he calls
an ongoing government-sponsored genocide.
The event was organized by Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND) and was co
sponsored by seven other student groups.
Captain Brian Steidle described his expe
riences as he said he watched powerlessly as
the government of Sudan or its proxies
killed and displaced tens of thousands of in
nocent civilians in mass attacks on villages.
As an unarmed U.S. State Department ob
server, he could do nothing but document
the mass killings in Darfur, a region the size
of Texas.
"All I was there to do was take their pic
tures, write down their names, write reports
and move on," he said, explaining that sur
vivors of the attacks he came to document
thought he was a doctor and cried for his as
sistance. "That's all we did every single day
for six months."


JAMES CHN/THe Stanford Daily
Former Marine captain Brian Steidle speaks yesterday about his experiences as a photographer in Darfur for the African Union. He spent six months
photographing what he called an "ongoing government-sponsored genocide."
Steidle emphasizes grassroots action

The most painful moment for
Steidle was watching the village of
Lahado, with a population of 20,(KK)
people, burn to the ground at the
hands of government soldiers.
"I stood there by the general in
charge and watched them burn down
the entire village, hut by hut." he said.
"This is a large scale military opera
tion orchestrated by the government
of Khartoum designed to eliminate
an ethnic group."
The speaker walked the audience
through the chronology of a typical
government attack on a village. He
fore an attack starts, cell phone sig
nals are blocked to ensure that vil
lages receive no advanced warning
from those near the base, he said.
Each helicopter gunship then fires
eight rockets filled with shrapnel de
signed specifically to kill humans.
Afterward, he said authorities come
in to burn the village and attack sur
vivors.
Steidle offered photographs to
support his claims. On a large dis
play. he flashed pictures of a three
year-old boy smashed in the face, a
man shot execution-style, a castrat
ed elderly man left bleeding to
death and children with their noses
cut off and eyes pulled out. He said
that villagers are locked in huts and
burned alive. Soldiers then pillage
and loot anything of value, he
added.
"After they steal everything, they
destroy anything they cannot carry."
he noted, describing how animal car

casses are dropped down wells to
render them unusable. "They do this
to make it impossible for the villagers
to live."
Steidle estimates that 3(M) Dar
furian civilians are dying every day
from violence or from hunger caused
by forced displacement.
"This is not over; it's ongoing," he
said."As we sit here.people are dying
in Darfur."
Steidle says that Sudanese gov
ernment leaders should ultimately be
held responsible.
"The root of the problem is the
government in Khartoum," he said,
adding that he was certain the direc
tor of intelligence and the vice presi
dent arc personally notified of and
authorize attacks on civilians.
Challenging the audience to act,
Steidle ended his slide show with a
picture of two girls playing.
"There's no difference between
these two kids and two kids in the
United States," he said."The only dif
ference is that they were born there,
and we were born here."
Steidle offered several steps indi
viduals and the U.S. government
could take to deal with what he called
genocide, from letter-writing and di
vestment campaigns to the deploy
ment of U.S. military forces.
"There are some bills before Con
gress that are not very strong, but
they send the right message," he said.
"Ultimately, it's going to take a
strong western force to protect the
people. It's very important to get

troops on the ground."
Encouraging everyone in the au
dience to write a letter, he noted that
politicians in Washington, D.C. do
not feel pressure to take serious ac
tion in Sudan.
"People at the White House say
they're feeling no heat," he said. "We
need the voices to be louder. We need
more letters and e-mails."
Steidle, who spent six months liv
ing with the African Union, ques
tioned the organization's ability to
bring peace. Stating that troops need
permission from Sudan to be there,
he argued that the African Union —
which has received $ 19() million from
the US. — cannot be successful with
out a wider mandate.
"A lot of aid does not get to the
people because the roads are inse
cure or blocked," he said.
Steidle also criticized the US. gov
ernment for failing to take a more
proactive role in the region.
"Our government has been back
tracking since the beginning," he
said, pointing out that Sudan has
been given some exemptions from a
trade embargo and that the govern
ment has the same ranking on sever
ity of human exploitation as Switzer
land.
Nicholas Kristof of The New York
Times reported in September that
Steidle has been blacklisted from all
U.S. government jobs because he has
spoken publicly about Sudan despite
three warnings from the US. State
Department not to. Steidle refused to

comment when asked whether he has
been blacklisted.
Members of the audience inter
viewed after the speech all expressed
that the pictures Steidle showed of
Darfur reflected a situation far worse
than they had imagined.
"After hearing him speak, I realize
1 had no idea this was going on," said
freshman Andrea Ayala. "1 didn't
know this event would be so intense.
How can this be happening? How is
the world not doing anything about
it?"
Event organizers were pleased
that Steidle discussed ways students
and audience members could help
the victims in Darfur.
"I thought he was very effective in
that he emphasized what each of us
can do to deal with this genocide,"
said senior Julia Spiegel, political ad
vocacy coordinator for STAND.
STAND collected money from
audience members as they left last
night's event. The money will be split
between Doctors Without Borders
and Global Crossroads, both groups
that are helping refugees and publi
cizing abuse. Green bracelets were
offered to anyone who gave more
than $5.
Senior Ben Elberger. who helped
plan the event, said that it is impor
tant to raise money for refugees and
increase campus awareness.
"The world needs to hear what is
happening in Darfur," he said. "The
world needs to hear people like Brian
Steidle."
As we sit here, people are dying in Darfur.

not feel pressure to take serious ac
tion in Sudan.
"People at the White House say
they're feeling no heat," he said. "We
need the voices to be louder. We need
more letters and e-mails."
Steidle, who spent six months liv
ing with the African Union, ques
tioned the organization's ability to
bring peace. Stating that troops need
permission from Sudan to be there,
he argued that the African Union —
which has received $ 19() million from
the US. — cannot be successful with
out a wider mandate.
"A lot of aid does not get to the
people because the roads are inse
cure or blocked," he said.
Steidle also criticized the US. gov
ernment for failing to take a more
proactive role in the region.
"Our government has been back
tracking since the beginning," he
said, pointing out that Sudan has
been given some exemptions from a
trade embargo and that the govern
ment has the same ranking on sever
ity of human exploitation as Switzer
land.
Nicholas Kristof of The New York
Times reported in September that
Steidle has been blacklisted from all
U.S. government jobs because he has
spoken publicly about Sudan despite
three warnings from the US. State
Department not to. Steidle refused to

comment when asked whether he has
been blacklisted.
Members of the audience inter
viewed after the speech all expressed
that the pictures Steidle showed of
Darfur reflected a situation far worse
than they had imagined.
"After hearing him speak, I realize
1 had no idea this was going on," said
freshman Andrea Ayala. "1 didn't
know this event would be so intense.
How can this be happening? How is
the world not doing anything about
it?"
Event organizers were pleased
that Steidle discussed ways students
and audience members could help
the victims in Darfur.
"I thought he was very effective in
that he emphasized what each of us
can do to deal with this genocide,"
said senior Julia Spiegel, political ad
vocacy coordinator for STAND.
STAND collected money from
audience members as they left last
night's event. The money will be split
between Doctors Without Borders
and Global Crossroads, both groups
that are helping refugees and publi
cizing abuse. Green bracelets were
offered to anyone who gave more
than $5.
Senior Ben Elberger. who helped
plan the event, said that it is impor
tant to raise money for refugees and
increase campus awareness.
"The world needs to hear what is
happening in Darfur," he said. "The
world needs to hear people like Brian
Steidle."
As we sit here, people are dying in Darfur.
— RET. MARINE CAPTAIN BRIAN STEIDLE

A retired Marine captain who recently
spent six months as a ceasefire monitor with
the African Union force in Darfur shocked a
full lecture hall in the Geology Corner last
night with horrifying details of what he calls
an ongoing government-sponsored genocide.
The event was organized by Students Taking
Action Now: Darfur (STAND) and was co
sponsored by seven other student groups.
Captain Brian Steidle described his expe
riences as he said he watched powerlessly as
the government of Sudan or its proxies
killed and displaced tens of thousands of in
nocent civilians in mass attacks on villages.
As an unarmed U.S. State Department ob
server, he could do nothing but document
the mass killings in Darfur, a region the size
of Texas.
"All I was there to do was take their pic
tures, write down their names, write reports
and move on," he said, explaining that sur
vivors of the attacks he came to document
thought he was a doctor and cried for his as
sistance. "That's all we did every single day
for six months."


JAMES CHN/THe Stanford Daily
Former Marine captain Brian Steidle speaks yesterday about his experiences as a photographer in Darfur for the African Union. He spent six months
photographing what he called an "ongoing government-sponsored genocide."
Steidle emphasizes grassroots action

The most painful moment for
Steidle was watching the village of
Lahado, with a population of 20,(KK)
people, burn to the ground at the
hands of government soldiers.
"I stood there by the general in
charge and watched them burn down
the entire village, hut by hut." he said.
"This is a large scale military opera
tion orchestrated by the government
of Khartoum designed to eliminate
an ethnic group."
The speaker walked the audience
through the chronology of a typical
government attack on a village. He
fore an attack starts, cell phone sig
nals are blocked to ensure that vil
lages receive no advanced warning
from those near the base, he said.
Each helicopter gunship then fires
eight rockets filled with shrapnel de
signed specifically to kill humans.
Afterward, he said authorities come
in to burn the village and attack sur
vivors.
Steidle offered photographs to
support his claims. On a large dis
play. he flashed pictures of a three
year-old boy smashed in the face, a
man shot execution-style, a castrat
ed elderly man left bleeding to
death and children with their noses
cut off and eyes pulled out. He said
that villagers are locked in huts and
burned alive. Soldiers then pillage
and loot anything of value, he
added.
"After they steal everything, they
destroy anything they cannot carry."
he noted, describing how animal car

casses are dropped down wells to
render them unusable. "They do this
to make it impossible for the villagers
to live."
Steidle estimates that 3(M) Dar
furian civilians are dying every day
from violence or from hunger caused
by forced displacement.
"This is not over; it's ongoing," he
said."As we sit here.people are dying
in Darfur."
Steidle says that Sudanese gov
ernment leaders should ultimately be
held responsible.
"The root of the problem is the
government in Khartoum," he said,
adding that he was certain the direc
tor of intelligence and the vice presi
dent arc personally notified of and
authorize attacks on civilians.
Challenging the audience to act,
Steidle ended his slide show with a
picture of two girls playing.
"There's no difference between
these two kids and two kids in the
United States," he said."The only dif
ference is that they were born there,
and we were born here."
Steidle offered several steps indi
viduals and the U.S. government
could take to deal with what he called
genocide, from letter-writing and di
vestment campaigns to the deploy
ment of U.S. military forces.
"There are some bills before Con
gress that are not very strong, but
they send the right message," he said.
"Ultimately, it's going to take a
strong western force to protect the
people. It's very important to get

troops on the ground."
Encouraging everyone in the au
dience to write a letter, he noted that
politicians in Washington, D.C. do
not feel pressure to take serious ac
tion in Sudan.
