# CRIME REPORT
## Computers stolen from EV cluster Twelve computers and two monitors have disappeared 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
Recent thefts in the Escondido Village
computer clusters have prompted a review of
safety protocols on campus. Three separate
incidents resulted in the loss of 12 Macintosh
computers and two Dell monitors. The first
theft occurred on Oct. 28 in EV 54D. Three
Macs and a Dell monitor were stolen. In the
second theft, which took place on Nov. 6, the
remaining three Macs and another Dell mon
itor in EV 54D were carried away. In the third
incident, all six Macintoshes in the computer
cluster for Studios 5 and 6 in Escondido Vil
lage were stolen.
Police investigations have not revealed the
perpetrators. However, the nature of the
crime suggests that they were premeditated.
"These were not crimes of opportunity;
someone didn't see a laptop lying around and
decide to take it," said Cluster Operations
Manager Surajit Bose in an interview with
The Daily. "These are well-planned, well-exe
cuted thefts that got around security meas
ures."
It is unclear whether the three incidents
are related. The means used to remove the
computers from the clusters is also unclear.
"The computers are cabled to the furni
ture in such a way that you can't steal the
computers without taking the furniture as
well," Bose said. "The locks are gone, but we
don't know how they were removed. Either
they used a cable cutter or they had a key."
Efforts to prevent future thefts are under
way.
"We've been in conversation with housing
and public safety," Bose said. "We've dis
cussed the possibility of increasing police pa-
trols, but the Department of Public
Safety doesn't have the personnel
at the moment."
Bose has also been working with
Residential Computing coordina
tors (RCCs) to increase student
awareness of the possibility of theft.
"ResComp is asking that every
one be very alert to the possibility
of theft in their cluster and their
rooms," said EV RCC Ugochi
Acholonu. "We are trying to make
sure that residents know that they
should not prop the cluster door
open at any time for any reason.

ResComp has notices to that effect
posted in the clusters. We are asking
residents to report any suspicious
persons or activity around the clus
ter to security immediately."
The ability of ResComp to re
place stolen cluster computers is
limited by both budgetary consider
ations and technical issues.
"We don't have spare computers
lying around, and the money, about
$ 15,000, to replace those computers
isn't readily available either," Bose
said. "Also, you can't run Panther
on the latest Macs. They use Tiger,
which isn't compatible with our cur
rent AFS networking client. We
would either have to acquire older
Macs or wait until the AFS client for
Tiger is released. But we have no
dates at the moment."
