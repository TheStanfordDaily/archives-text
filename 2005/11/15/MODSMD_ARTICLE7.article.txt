## MEChA protests for immigrants Students stage noontime die-in to protest U.S. immigration policy 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Members of MEChA and their supporters took over the
aptly-named "intersection of death" next to the clock tower
at noon yesterday fora "die-in" to protest current govern
ment policy toward Mexican immigrants.
Approximately 30 participants dressed in black
sprawled on the ground to represent the deaths of immi
grants who try to cross the border into the United States.
Others stood by with signs bearing information on the issue.
The "die-in" was part of MEChA's Latino Immigration
Week, which includes film screenings and panel discussions.
According to junior Luz Reyes, MEChA co-chair, it was
important for the group to educate the community about
this important issue.
"[The demonstration] was to inform the Stanford com
munity about the current, inhumane immigration policy,
which has led to the death of over 2,(XH) people in the last
five years," she said. "We also wanted to commemorate the
lives that have been lost in the pursuit of coming to the
United States."
MEChA co-chair Diego Martin, a senior, agreed.
"Our goal is to raise awareness." he said. "This is not an
issue that people hear about. So not only does it continue to
happen, but it gets worse. There has been at least a 40 per
cent increase in the number of deaths since last year."
Martin cited the Operation Gatekeeper policy, estab
lished in 1993, as the cause of the deaths along what
MEChA calls a highly militarized border.
According to the New York Times, Operation Gatekeep
er's objective was to blockade the busiest border-crossing
points between the United States and Mexico, such as San
Diego and El Paso. It tripled the number of armed U.S. Bor
der Patrol agents in San Diego to 2.4(H) and erected a 10-
foot-tall wall stretching more than 14 miles from the Pacif
ic Ocean.
While the Times reported that Operation Gatekeeper
succeeded in halving migration through the busiest sections
of the border, it also reported that the flow had only shifted
to other areas.
According to Martin, the military buildup along the Cal
ifornia border has forced immigrants trying to cross to seek
other points of entry, shifting to more remote desert and

these rural areas. The Mexican gov
ernment reports an average of two
migrant deaths per day along the
U.S.-Mexico border.
"While the policy was intended to
lower the flow of immigrants, it is in
fact leading to many deaths that we
consider completely unnecessary,"
Martin said.
In honor of Latino Immigration
Week. MEChA is advocating a poli
cy change, given the current situation
at the border and for immigrants al
ready in the United States.
"Some of the types of policies
MEChA advocates are a fairer and
more accessible pathway to legal res
idency and citizenship, equitable ed
ucation for immigrant students and
demilitarization of the border,"
Reyes said.
While some supported the goals
of the die-in, other students said they
were opposed to immigration.
"(By entering illegally],illegal im
migrants disregard the fact that the
U.S. is a sovereign nation, and they're
violating our laws," said junior Dan
Dickinson.
Others have a more nuanced ap
proach to immigration policy.

"It's a very complicated issue, but
crossing illegally doesn't seem like a
good course of action given the risks
involved," said senior Justin Liu, re
ferring to the choices that immi
grants make to come to America.
"It's like those people who try to
come from Cuba in tiny boats and
don't make it.
"The way to protest is to look at
other forms of legal immigration," he
continued. "To say that we should
not have these laws because people
will die is like saying that laws
against thieves will make thieves en
gage in behavior that risks their lives.
I'm against our immigration policy,
but we can't say that once we have
certain immigration laws that the
laws of our society shouldn't be en
forced."
MEChA was not the only group
represented at yesterday's protest.
Other supporters included the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN),the Stanford Labor Action
Committee (SLAC) and the Asian
American Students' Association
(AASA).
"MSAN shares MEChA's con
cern about the terrible situation fac
ing immigrants crossing the southern
border of the U. 5.." said MSAN Pres
ident Omar Shakir, a junior, 'immi
gration is a serious issue facing

America today, since there have also
been many injustices and civil rights
violations committed against immi
grants from South Asia and the Mid
dle East. So these kinds of issues
cross-culturally affect a lot of com
munities here."
The die-in caused some bicycle
and pedestrian traffic, since it
blocked the intersection during the
lunchtime hour. It also unintention
ally coincided with the Band's tradi
tional Bearial procession for Big
Game. The Band, also dressed in
black, was forced to walk around
protest participants, who lay on the
ground, in order to begin its rally in
White Plaza.
While some students may have
been frustrated by the inconven
ience, it was an intended outcome of
the event.
"It is a good protest if it disrupts
campus," said freshman Jarod Keller,
who stood watching the event with
his Spanish class. "I haven't heard
any negative sentiments, though â€”
mostly just curiosity."
Reyes said students who felt held
up should consider the number of
people who want the same opportu
nities that they have.
"It is nothing to ask students to
take a minute and face the truth
about immigration," she said.
