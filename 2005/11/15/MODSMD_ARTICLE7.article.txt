## MEChA protests for immigrants Students stage noontime die-in to protest U.S. immigration policy 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Members of MEChA and their supporters took over the
aptly-named "intersection of death" next to the clock tower
at noon yesterday fora "die-in" to protest current govern
ment policy toward Mexican immigrants.
Approximately 30 participants dressed in black
sprawled on the ground to represent the deaths of immi
grants who try to cross the border into the United States.
Others stood by with signs bearing information on the issue.
The "die-in" was part of MEChA's Latino Immigration
Week, which includes film screenings and panel discussions.
According to junior Luz Reyes, MEChA co-chair, it was
important for the group to educate the community about
this important issue.
"[The demonstration] was to inform the Stanford com
munity about the current, inhumane immigration policy,
which has led to the death of over 2,(XH) people in the last
five years," she said. "We also wanted to commemorate the
lives that have been lost in the pursuit of coming to the
United States."
MEChA co-chair Diego Martin, a senior, agreed.
"Our goal is to raise awareness." he said. "This is not an
issue that people hear about. So not only does it continue to
happen, but it gets worse. There has been at least a 40 per
cent increase in the number of deaths since last year."
Martin cited the Operation Gatekeeper policy, estab
lished in 1993, as the cause of the deaths along what
MEChA calls a highly militarized border.
According to the New York Times, Operation Gatekeep
er's objective was to blockade the busiest border-crossing
points between the United States and Mexico, such as San
Diego and El Paso. It tripled the number of armed U.S. Bor
der Patrol agents in San Diego to 2.4(H) and erected a 10-
foot-tall wall stretching more than 14 miles from the Pacif
ic Ocean.
While the Times reported that Operation Gatekeeper
succeeded in halving migration through the busiest sections
of the border, it also reported that the flow had only shifted
to other areas.
According to Martin, the military buildup along the Cal
ifornia border has forced immigrants trying to cross to seek
other points of entry, shifting to more remote desert and
