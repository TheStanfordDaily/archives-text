## Riots appear to be subsiding despite continued arson attacks French state of emergency extended until February 
### D'ARCY DORAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PARIS (AP) — The French Cabinet approved a bill
yesterday to extend the country's state of emergency for
three months, while youths set schools ablaze and waged
other scattered arson attacks across France.
Though the unrest is abating, the bill, if approved by
parliament as expected, would allow a 12-day state of
emergency to be prolonged until mid-February if need
ed.The emergency measures empower regions to impose
curfews on minors, conduct house searches and take
other steps to prevent unrest.
"It is a measure of protection and precaution," Presi
dent Jacques Chirac said.
Chirac stressed that the measure was "temporary"
and that regional officials would use it "only where it is
strictly necessary." About 40 French towns, including
France's third-largest city, Lyon, have used the measure
to put curfews for minors into effect.
Overnight, the number of car-torchings — a barome
ter of the unrest _ dropped sharply, with youths setting
fire to 284 vehicles, compared to 374 the previous night,
police said Monday. There were no clashes between po
lice and rioters.
"The lull is confirmed," national police spokesman
Patrick Hamon said. A week ago, 1,400 cars were incin
erated in a single night.
The 18 nights of arson attacks and riots — set off by
the accidental electrocution deaths of two teens who
thought police were chasing them — began in Paris'
poor suburbs, where many immigrants from North and
West Africa live with their French-born children in high
rise housing projects.
France's worst unrest since the 1968 student-worker
protests is forcing the country to confront decades of
simmering anger over racial discrimination, crowded
housing and unemployment.
In scattered attacks overnight Sunday-Monday, van
dals in the southern city of Toulouse rammed a car into a
primary school before setting the building on fire.
In northern France, arsonists set fire to a sports center
in the suburb of Faches-Thumesnil and a school in the
town of Halluin, the North regional government said.
A gas canister exploded inside a burning garbage can
in the Alpine city of Grenoble, injuring two police offi
cers, the national police said. Three officers were injured
elsewhere.
From Sunday to Monday, 115 people were taken into

custody, police said. Since the beginning of the
unrest, 2,767 people have been arrested.
Violence has decreased steadily since France de
clared a state of emergency Wednesday. The measure, un
less extended, is set to end next Sunday.
Government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope said the
bill approved by the Cabinet on Yesterday would
leave open the possibility of ending the emergency meas
ures before three months are up. if order is restored.
Officials already are turning their attention to helping
riot-hit towns recover: European Commission President
Jose Manuel Barroso proposed Sunday that the Euro
pean Union give $58 million to France, and said it could
make up to $ 1.17 billion available in longer-term support

for suburban jobs and social cohesion.
Later yesterday, Chirac was to make a televised state
ment about the violence — his third public comment
since the unrest began, the Elysee Palace said. His com
ments Monday to the Cabinet were reported to journal
ists by Cope, the spokesman.
Within the next few days, France is expected to start
deporting foreigners implicated in the violence, a plan by
law-and-order Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy that
has raised concerns among human rights groups, and
questions among other ministers.
Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said he
agreed that illegal immigrants could be sent home, but
not foreigners with permission to live in France.

Officials already are turning their attention to helping
riot-hit towns recover: European Commission President
Jose Manuel Barroso proposed Sunday that the Euro
pean Union give $58 million to France, and said it could
make up to $ 1.17 billion available in longer-term support

for suburban jobs and social cohesion.
Later yesterday, Chirac was to make a televised state
ment about the violence — his third public comment
since the unrest began, the Elysee Palace said. His com
ments Monday to the Cabinet were reported to journal
ists by Cope, the spokesman.
Within the next few days, France is expected to start
deporting foreigners implicated in the violence, a plan by
law-and-order Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy that
has raised concerns among human rights groups, and
questions among other ministers.
Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said he
agreed that illegal immigrants could be sent home, but
not foreigners with permission to live in France.
