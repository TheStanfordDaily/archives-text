# Graduate Life
## Tower isn't as ivory as it seems 
### 
1 heard an interesting anecdote from
an unnamed source (let's call him
"Deep Throat") the other day. Deep
'Throat's department has a renowned
and brilliant professor who is an object
of desire for grad students (no, not like
that; God you people have filthy minds).
It turns out that said professor often
requires services from grad students
that are a little beyond the call of duty.
Like, for example, picking up the dry
cleaning or doing a spot of work around
the house.
Now, I must confess that 1 see noth
ing wrong with this. I mean, this is where
I hope my chosen career will take me.
Where else in the world can you get in
dentured servants, and what's more,
ones that freely accept the role?
On the other hand, this little tale is il
lustrative of something broader: Acade-*
mic life is not the intellectual oasis you
might expect.
In the movies (and also as a market
ing ploy when dealing with the general
public) academia is portrayed as an idyl
lic place. We are all here sacrificing our
youth, our earning power and our sex
lives for the greater good of humanity.
This is not true.The pursuit of knowl
edge is a fine idea, but in reality, we're
chasing something else: money.
The purpose of academia is the same
as any other organism — it seeks to live.
And to live, we must feed. And to feed,
we must hunt. And to hunt... Well you
get the idea.
Research, of all kinds, is a quest for
funding. Funding that is then used to
generate more research that can be used
to justify more funds. This in turn lets us
spawn new ideas leading to more cash
and so it goes on. And on. And on.
Before the eight (perhaps nine) peo
ple who read this get over-excited and
bother me with e-mails, I should point
out that I'm not suggesting that all of
this money is wasted. On the contrary,
the academic world is very successful. It
has had a hand in every aspect of
progress since the birth of civilization.
TTiis bigger picture, however, is kind
of accidental. Everyday university life is
concerned far more with the mundane
and the monetary than the greater glory
of mankind.
I sit in around half a dozen colloquia
each week ("sit" is the operative word,
listening would presumably require un
derstanding — I'm still waiting on that).
A few of these seminars are newly-mint
ed, so I've been to a couple of organiza
tional meetings recently. Fascinating
stuff.
The enthusiasm with which we dis
cuss what to discuss, how to discuss it
and. most importantly, what food to
consume during the process, swamps
anything seen during an actual discus
sion. Bureaucracy is truly all-conquer
ing.
It's also übiquitous. Occasionally,
due to a misguided sense of curiosity, I
find myself stuck "doing" things (partic
ularly upsetting since I've always felt
"doing" was something best kept out of
work). As a consequence I've been for
tunate enough to glimpse parts of the
rusty, creaking machine that prevents
the University from keeling over.
All I've managed to learn is that said
machine is very impressive. Not just in
its size, but also in its relentless ability to
suck in time and spit out memos.
Thankfully, graduate-student life is
relatively free of organizational non
sense. Most of the form-filling, meeting
attending and presentation-giving tedi
um is left to faculty.
All of which. I suppose, should only
serve to increase our respect for these
professorial lions of the academic
world. Not only are they fearless preda
tors of stray government funds and con
querors of bureaucracy, but they man
age all of that while getting us to do their
household chores.

Big Game weekend is coming up and,
dear reader, I need your help. I'm looking
to experience the whole affair and regale
you with my thoughts after the Thanks
giving break. I have my Gaieties ticket
and my Red Zone season pass; what else
do / need to do for the fidl Stanford expe
rience? E-mail navins@stanford.edu with
suggestions.
