Ihave a low opinion of vegetarianism as a religion. It's
not just the mindless worship that generally accompa
nies the R-word that's bothersome — it's also the fact
that to deprive yourself of dead animals is to

shut out a whole world of pleasure.

Now, individual vegetarians
are not bad people, they're
• i. : M.j i J ,IA. i

just...misguided. I don t real
l ly understand why one

would choose to deny

oneself of the splendors
of meat.
Unfortunately, being

misguided rarely stops
people, and so I find my
self with a large number

of vegetarians in my life.
And they occasionally need
to be fed.

Last week I found

' myself cooking for my house
mates, half of whom are herbivores.

Since, sadly, a single carrot on a plate

does not qualify as haute cuisine, I was forced to produce a
meat-free meal in order to impress at the dinner party.
We started with a conversation on the nature of vegetari
anism accompanied by a goat's cheese mousse. The recipe is
courtesy of "The French Laundry Cookbook," written by
California-born chef Thomas Keller.
Goat cheese mousse with parmesan crisps
Blend 6 ounces of soft goat's cheese with 6 tablespoons
of heavy whipping cream. Use a food processor if you have
one, or a whisk and a lot of elbow grease if you don't. Once
blended (you should have something a little thicker than
toothpaste — add more cream if necessary) add a little
salt, freshly milled pepper and a tablespoon of finely
chopped Italian parsley.
In order to show off — and remember, when it comes
to entertaining, image is everything — one can present the
mousse in little parmesan baskets. To make these, spread
out 1.5 tablespoons of freshly-grated parmesan on a non
stick baking tray (preferably lined with parchment paper)
into as many 2-to 3-inch rounds as you need. You have
enough mousse for 8, but it's best to keep spares. Bake at
325 degrees Fahrenheit for 8 to 10 minutes

When golden brown, remove from the

oven, lift up the disc carefully (let it cool for

a couple of seconds first) and press

into a clean, empty egg carton,
v This will act as a mold, and

after the cheese has
cooled, you will have neat
little baskets in which you

can dollop your mousse
and astonish your friends.

A s the mousse was being de-

Zvvoured, we started on the thorny ques-

tion of why vegetarians shy away from our preda

Tory human nature.
The broad consensus — both from dinner and
other such conversations — is that acolytes give one of the
following reasons for their faith: taste (the"I don't like meat"
type), religion ("God told me not to eat animals"), health
("millions of years of evolution are wrong"), efficiency ("we
need to preserve our rapidly diminishing stock of cattle") and
ethics ("the bunnies are soooo cute").
As Hilary (one of my vegetarian housemates) related
her personal voyage of self-discovery — it started with
health and was completed by the forlorn lobster of the title
— we tucked into course number two.
Tourain Pcrigourdain (also known as garlic soup)
Garlic is probably the single greatest ingredient in the

culinary world...well, excepting salt and pepper, any

way. Unfortunately, this means that people —
mostly the French — have a tendency to overuse

it. However, sometimes such overindulgence
is merited. A

Making soup is easy and the end re
sult is generally infinitely better than
buying it in a can. For this dish, start by

sauteeing(on low heat) one finely
chopped large onion iti a few tablespoons

——e> — r >
of butter. Add a tablespoon of oil as well to

prevent the butter from burning easily.

Once the onion has softened and taken on a

little color, add 8 cloves of very finely-chopped gar

lie and let that brown for a couple of minutes.Then add 4
pints of chicken stock (vegetable if you're cooking for the
heathens. This is easiest to make bv cheating and using
stock cubes or powder). Simmer gently for at least an hour.
While this is going on, mix 3 egg yolks with 2 table
spoons of creme fraiche (use sour cream if you can't find
this). Once the yolks are blended, add the egg whites and
stir briefly to break them up (but do not combine the egg
mixture with the soup yet).
After the flavors have had a chance to develop, add salt
and pepper to taste. The amount of salt you need will vary
wildly depending on the stock you use. Take the soup off the
heat, add a tablespoon of finely-chopped sorrel and pour in
the egg mixture. Stir and serve immediately.
This recipe comes from a former French housemate of
mine. He tells me that the traditional way to finish the
soup is to pour in a little red wine to mix with the dregs and
down the concoction.
As the conversation turned from food to politics, the
meal stepped up a notch and out came the main course.
The hardest part of cooking for veggies is try ing to pro-

duce something sub
stantial for a center
piece. Most meals are .

built around meat.and
if you are going to re
place that, you need
omething suitably weighty.

Once again, Thomas Keller
(and this time the "Bouchon

cookbook) provided the answer — a Roquefort
and leek quiche. Quiche is a marvelous dish because

it's so rich that you can easily forget you've missed out
on the animal.

' On the downside, the dish is complex. You need to be
able to make pastry well, which is not the easiest of culi
nary skills to master. If you want to give it a try but don't
want to buy the cookbook, you can find the recipe with a
little help from Google.
I, however, am almost out of space, so I'm going to
move on to dessert (from Nigel Slater's cookbook "Real
Food").
Nigclki Lawson's Sticky Chocolate Pudding
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Mix 11 /4
cups of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, 1/4
cup of unsweetened cocoa. 1/2 cup of ground hazelnuts, 1
2/3 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 1/2 ounces of finely
chopped dark chocolate in a bowl. Whisk together 2 table
spoons of melted butter, 1 egg, 3/4 cup milk and a teaspoon
of vanilla extract.lhen add this mixture to the dry ingredi
ents and stir until blended.

Spoon the mixture in a well-buttered, 8-inch souffle
k dish. Next, mix 1 cup of dark brown sugar and 1 1/4

cups of cocoa power and sprinkle on top of the pud
ding mixture. Finally, pour 2 cups of boiling water di

rectly over the pudding and put it in the oven

Let it cook for 50 minutes, and do not open the

oven for the first 45. When the pudding is done, it
will be firm and spongy on the top (like a cake).
Underneath, however, will be a pool of sticky

' chocolate. Serve immediately with as much
cream as your arteries can handle.

There you have it — a vegetarian feast. Whilst in gen
eral I frown upon the encouragement of deviant be
havior, there as a tiny voice in the back of my mind mur
muring occasionally that there may well be something
wrong with eating sentient creatures. And just in case that
voice gets louder, it's a good idea to be prepared.
Now. we should be able to squeeze in one more of these
before Christmas. If you would like to be fed. e-mail
