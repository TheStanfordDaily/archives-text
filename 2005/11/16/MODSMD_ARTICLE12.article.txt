# E-newsletter launched for grad students, promotes inter-department mingling

"If you've been wishing that there were a
simple way to access information about activi
ties and events of interest to graduate students,
your wish has come true," so said last week's in
augural issue of Grad Announce, a monthly e
newsletter highlighting campus-wide events
organized by the Graduate Life Office (GLO),
Graduate Student Council (GSC) and Gradu
ate Student Programming Board (GSPB).
The graduate student population at Stan
ford outnumbers the undergraduate popula
tion by roughly 1,000. But the broad spectrum
of pursuits and the richness of the graduate
population's non-academic diversity have
made communicating among this corpus a
challenge.

"There are currently over B,(KK) graduate
students on campus and there has been no way
of contacting all of them until last week," says
GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen, referring to Grad
Announce. "Undergraduates have class lists to
contact their entire population, so it made
sense that graduate students should have that
same capability."
Allen continues that in the past, GSC mem
bers have had to rely on departmental adminis
trators and student life coordinators to forward
announcements to appropriate e-mail lists.
"The need for such a list has been recog
nized by several past GSCs," says GSC Co
chair Thomas Lee. "Our other methods miss
significant portions of the graduate communi
ty because students don't know about the opt
in lists or because of gaps in coverage in the de

partment lists."
Grad Announce will be received on a
monthly basis by every graduate and profes
sional student, which includes co-terminal stu
dents but not post-doctoral,according to Allen.
Second year computer science master's stu
dent Pei-Chin Wang supports the new initia
tive, saying she feels "it (will be] useful, espe
cially for new graduate students."
"When 1 first came to Stanford I felt over
whelmed by hearing about grad events from so
many different sources," she says.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs and Di
rector of the Graduate Life Office Chris Grif
fith says that graduate students have been ex
pressing a desire for "a kind of one-stop-shop
ping for event information."
As with many communication initiatives

aimed at more effective information dissemi
nation. the roll out of the newsletter did not
take place without its share of time and effort.
"llie GSC has been advocating for the ca
pability to contact the entire graduate student
community for several years," Allen says.
Lee explains that they had to seek permis
sion from the Registrar's Office to get access to
everyone's e-mail addresses.
"Discussing terms for access that would ad
dress security and privacy concerns took some
time." he says.
Griffith says that "the time was right" for
the newsletter's initiation.
"There is an increased number of events for
graduate students and more students are ex-
