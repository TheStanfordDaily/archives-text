# E-newsletter launched for grad students, promotes inter-department mingling
## 
### ANJALEE SUJANANI 
"If you've been wishing that there were a
simple way to access information about activi
ties and events of interest to graduate students,
your wish has come true," so said last week's in
augural issue of Grad Announce, a monthly e
newsletter highlighting campus-wide events
organized by the Graduate Life Office (GLO),
Graduate Student Council (GSC) and Gradu
ate Student Programming Board (GSPB).
The graduate student population at Stan
ford outnumbers the undergraduate popula
tion by roughly 1,000. But the broad spectrum
of pursuits and the richness of the graduate
population's non-academic diversity have
made communicating among this corpus a
challenge.

"There are currently over B,(KK) graduate
students on campus and there has been no way
of contacting all of them until last week," says
GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen, referring to Grad
Announce. "Undergraduates have class lists to
contact their entire population, so it made
sense that graduate students should have that
same capability."
Allen continues that in the past, GSC mem
bers have had to rely on departmental adminis
trators and student life coordinators to forward
announcements to appropriate e-mail lists.
"The need for such a list has been recog
nized by several past GSCs," says GSC Co
chair Thomas Lee. "Our other methods miss
significant portions of the graduate communi
ty because students don't know about the opt
in lists or because of gaps in coverage in the de

partment lists."
Grad Announce will be received on a
monthly basis by every graduate and profes
sional student, which includes co-terminal stu
dents but not post-doctoral,according to Allen.
Second year computer science master's stu
dent Pei-Chin Wang supports the new initia
tive, saying she feels "it (will be] useful, espe
cially for new graduate students."
"When 1 first came to Stanford I felt over
whelmed by hearing about grad events from so
many different sources," she says.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs and Di
rector of the Graduate Life Office Chris Grif
fith says that graduate students have been ex
pressing a desire for "a kind of one-stop-shop
ping for event information."
As with many communication initiatives

aimed at more effective information dissemi
nation. the roll out of the newsletter did not
take place without its share of time and effort.
"llie GSC has been advocating for the ca
pability to contact the entire graduate student
community for several years," Allen says.
Lee explains that they had to seek permis
sion from the Registrar's Office to get access to
everyone's e-mail addresses.
"Discussing terms for access that would ad
dress security and privacy concerns took some
time." he says.
Griffith says that "the time was right" for
the newsletter's initiation.
"There is an increased number of events for
graduate students and more students are ex-
pressing a desire to be involved in the
life of the campus community," Grif
fith explains. "It was particularly diffi
cult to reach students living off cam
pus. We are excited about reaching off
campus student families to invite them
to participate in events planned specif
ically for families with children."
The newsletter comes as part of
the GSC's initiative to forge a greater
sense of community within the grad
uate population and to foster more
cross-departmental interaction.
"Wouldn't you want to know there
was a free Thanksgiving dinner with
all the trimmings, free Yahoo! Music,
special workshops on launching a fac
ulty career and grad nights at the 750

Pub?" Allen asks. "We hope that
Grad Announce will connect more
people with the graduate student
community and broaden their social
and intellectual life by exposing them
to people outside their departments"
The monthly Grad Announce will
not replace the weekly Grad Events e
bulletin, according to Lee and Allen.
"We created this list to highlight
programming from the GSC, GSPB
and GLO, as well as services provid
ed by various University administra
tive units that are of interest to all
grad students," Lee explains.
Ability to submit announcements
is limited to these groups, according
to Allen.
"We arc trying to maintain a man
ageable size to the e-mail and there
fore will only highlight a select num
ber of campus-wide events." she says.
"If you have 30-plus events included
in any e-mail, few will bother to take

the time and scroll down."
First-year electrical engineering
master's student Hattie Dong says
she thinks the e-newsletter "has great
potential to be very useful."
"Until now. 1 either heard about
grad events through scattered
sources or did not hear about them at
all," she says.
Former GSC Chair Moriah
Thomason says she agrees that grad
uate students often do not hear about
special activities.
"Imagine the Thanksgiving din
ner for grads sponsored by the Presi
dent's Office, the Provost and depart
ments supporting grads all over cam
pus," she says.
She cites the CalTrain GO-Pass as
a second example of useful services
that the newsletter can help publicize.
GO-Passes are good for unlimited
CalTrain. VTA bus and light rail rides
until Jan. 1. 2(M)6, and graduate stu

dents who live off campus can acquire
the passes for free until that date.
"Those passes cost the same
amount whether they are used once
or I,(XX) times and grads should be
using them for maximum conven
ience to themselves and to gain max
imum benefit from the financial sup
port Stanford has put into this pro
gram " she says. "There are many
more examples - tax assistance work
shops, social events, health care issues
and support resources on campus."
All of these programs, Thomason
says, are "a ton of work and a ton of
reward, but they are dead in the
water if they are things grads do not
know about."
"Face it," she continues. "These
are the things that greatly affect a stu
dent's quality of life."
