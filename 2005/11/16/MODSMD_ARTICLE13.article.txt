## Editorial Graduate students need options besides Munger 
### 
Last week, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) convened to discuss
the future of graduate housing on
campus. In particular, concerns were
raised about the limited availability of af
fordable housing for graduate students
once the Munger Graduate Residences
are built and Crothers Hall and Crothers
Memorial are converted into undergradu
ate housing.
This is not the first time that such issues
have been discussed; similar concerns were
last presented to the GSC in May 2005. We
applaud the GSC's efforts to fully explore
the implications of these housing changes.
However, we believe that more sustained
dialogue is needed, especially regarding the
Munger project.
The construction of the Munger resi
dences has already become a lightning rod
of controversy. Many students are dis
mayed by the number of changes that have
been made to accommodate the structures.
Because of the building plans, the resident
fellow's cottage at Casa Zapata has had to
be rebuilt, the Campus Bike Shop is in the
process of moving from Salvatierra Walk to
Tresidder Union, and Wilbur Field is going
to have to make way for parking, at least
temporarily.
As disruptive as the construction plans
may be, the Munger residences offer ben
efits for the University. When completed,
it will house 600 graduate students and
free up over 350 spaces in Crothers Hall
and Crothers Memorial for undergradu
ates.
The Munger residences will offer more
comfortable living conditions than
Crothers, which has small rooms and limit
ed kitchen facilities. Indeed, the new resi
dential facility — with its plush four-bed
room apartments, in-suite bathrooms and
laundry facilities — looks poised to attract

graduate students who want both the rigors
of academic pursuit and the pleasures of
fine living.
Unfortunately, these benefits come at
the cost of some engineering graduate stu
dents who will be deprived of the cheap
housing options that these two dormitories
offer. Many of those affected are likely to
be international students who can least af
ford the changes. Also, engineering stu
dents will lose the priority they currently
receive to live in Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial. Efforts should be
made to ensure that some form of restitu
tion is allotted to engineering students af
fected by these changes.
What we find hard to swallow, however,
is the notion that engineering graduate
students require "silent residences." Some
engineering students are concerned that
they will lose the low-decibel living envi
ronments that Crothers currently offers,
and propose that special sound-proof
floors be built into the new Munger facili
ty. While we acknowledge that silence has
its virtues, we fail to see why engineering
graduate students need more quiet than
their peers. On the contrary, we think that
engineering students would benefit from
increased interaction with fellow graduate
students and with the Stanford community
at large.
Indeed, a larger concern that the GSC
should address is the interaction among
graduate students from different disci
plines and between graduate and under
graduate students that would result from
these housing changes. Situated along the
periphery of campus, graduate housing is
isolated and poorly integrated. Future
changes to graduate housing should not ex
acerbate the situation, but should open up
more possibilities for interaction and ex
change within the entire student body.
