# Lessons from McKinsey
## 
### 
lan Davis, the global head of McKin
sey & Company, fresh from taking
the pulse of Fortune 500 CEOs, re
cently told GSBers that "people" is a key
business theme of tomorrow.
When he spoke at the business school
two weeks ago, Davis demonstrated an
intimate understanding of everything
from history to economy to technology
and how they define the concerns of the
modern day corporation. His aim was to
distill his conversations with global busi
ness leaders into several key themes. In
cluded among these were information
technology, Asia, strategy and the rela
tionship between growth and risk. How
ever, what he stressed more was the im
portance of people: "If the 1980's were
about strategy, and the 1990's were about
information technology, then the next
decade will be about people." The ques
tion is, what exactly did Davis mean by a
term as broad as "people?"
After my brief stint at Lehman Broth
ers. I've often thought that the key lesson
of my experience was that business is
people. It's not so much the bricks, mor
tar, trucks or processes we immediately
associate with a functioning business â€”
these tools are ultimately the creations
of the people of an organization. The real
question is: how do you organize and mo
tivate your people? How do they think
and work? When are they irrational ver
sus rational? What makes them tick? In
other words: Congrats to the Psych and
SymSys majors, there is life after gradua
tion; Davis's talk suggested that psychol
ogy and cognitive science will have an in
creasingly prominent role in defining
global organizations.
The leadership of a company, and cul
ture they set.can make all the difference.

For example, some argue that the ex
traordinarily competitive atmosphere at
Enron contributed to its downfall. A
"rank-and-yank" system engendered
fear in employees and created a culture
in which authority and loyalty were fa
vored over dissent. The result was an ir
rational escalation of commitment to lu
dicrous accounting schemes. The compa
ny eventually toppled, and with it, the
fortunes of its investors. In a less hierar
chical organization where dissent was
encouraged, the Enron catastrophe
might have been avoided.
Studies also show that organizations
that have more "cross-border" interac
tion tend to be more successful as a result
of superior innovation. By "cross-bor
der" I mean that the people in marketing
talk to the people in engineering, and the
people in management talk to the folks in
the call center. People are more effective
at generating new ideas if constantly
learning from each other; this is why top
universities aim to have a diverse intel
lectual population. Achieving this struc
ture is so valuable to some businesses
that they use software to analyze e-mail
patterns and map the inter-company net
work. They use this data to reorganize
employees in a way that increases "cross
border" interaction.
Understanding how customers think

can lead to more effective marketing
campaigns and customer satisfaction.
For instance, some businesses use cogni
tive science and brain scan technology to
study consumer response to different
brand tactics. Instead of accepting a mar
keting firm's subjective recommenda
tion, companies can use brain surveys to
find the scientifically most "pleasing"
option. And at the point of sale, psychol
ogy leads to more effective interpersonal
tactics. Best Buy. for example, trains its
employees to first categorize customers
(like "Buzz," the early adopter) so they
can customize the interaction to achieve
the best results.
So how is Davis putting some of these
concepts into practice in his organization?
He is launching an initiative to transform
away from the usual smart, privileged
business type at McKinsey. A more di
verse personality base, he says, will enable
his company to focus on the nebulous
puzzles of organizational behavior in ad
dition to process solutions. He intends to
attract people with a range of back
grounds from different social clusters. For
instance, he recently hired a priest.
Organization is the difference be
tween excellence and anarchy in build
ing something greater than the sum of its
parts. In business, the building blocks are
human. Milton Friedman once remarked
that "the business of business is busi
ness." These days, and in the spirit of
Davis's talk, the adage might be more
aptly phrased, "The business of business
is people."
