You might be surprised to learn that I
haven't always been the well-put-to
gether package that you see week after
week writing these captivating, if not addictive,
columns. You see, prior to my Stanford days of
Ph.D. glamour and fame, I was actually a bit of
a dork.
If you were to look up my name in the back of
one of my old high school yearbooks, you'd see
me listed only twice: once for the required picture
(which was usually a painful display of acne, bad
hair and awkwardness) and my name listed al
phabetically under the marching band photo.
Back then I was at least 30 pounds overweight
and my unflattering circa-1972 band uniform only
exacerbated the genetic betrayal that was my
legacy. If you looked at the picture of the band on
the football field, you could see me plain as day: I
was the big, awkward dot, clutching a French horn
and probably out of breath.
My experience in the Blue Raider Marching
Band was definitely one of the highlights of my
high school career. At my school, the football
team was usually mediocre, but the band was
one of the best in the region. At most football
games there were as many fans to watch the
marching band halftime show as there were to
support the football team. You should have
heard their gasps when we made a block forma
tion, rotated it 360 degrees and then turned it
into the shape of a jet as we played "Maria" from
West Side Story! I defy you to find better enter
tainment during an athletic event.
One of the benefits of my marching band ex
perience was that I developed a greater apprecia
tion for the football team. Sure, I had once ad
mired the team's tight end. but more often than
not it got pummeled by the opposing team. At
times I would speculate that the lack of action on
the football field was compensated for with post
game showers. You can't blame me for wanting to
see the boys score from time to time. I had school
spirit, what could I say?

I have never been one to play sports myself,
mostly because 1 still throw like a girl (a girl with
poor throwing skills, mind you).To this day if you
ask me to toss you something from across the
room, 1 freak out and come up with some awk
ward excuse for why 1 need to walk it over to you.
Although they didn't teach me skills, the football
games I attended clued me in to some of the more
idiosyncratic aspects of the game. You can imag
ine my surprise when I found out that their "Hail
Mary" play wasn't just a funny way of saying hello
to the gay boys in the marching band. Who knew?
During my years in the marching band, 1 also
began to realize how reciprocal the "athlete-fan"
relationship is. As a member of the band, we
needed the athletes to provide reason for us to
rally around our school and team, and the athletes
needed us to support them to victory. We affec
tionately called the cheerleaders and dancers
"Band-Aids" because we worked together with
them to motivate the crowd, even in the moments
when our team was beyond hope. It wasn't about
the final score. It was about the game.
As Big Game approaches this year, I'd like to
encourage all the football players of the Stan
ford team to keep in mind the reciprocal rela
tionship that they have with us fans. In turn, it is
up to us fans to be firm athletic supporters. To
gether, we're all a part of the game, playing for
the same team.

room, 1 freak out and come up with some awk
ward excuse for why 1 need to walk it over to you.
Although they didn't teach me skills, the football
games I attended clued me in to some of the more
idiosyncratic aspects of the game. You can imag
ine my surprise when I found out that their "Hail
Mary" play wasn't just a funny way of saying hello
to the gay boys in the marching band. Who knew?
During my years in the marching band, 1 also
began to realize how reciprocal the "athlete-fan"
relationship is. As a member of the band, we
needed the athletes to provide reason for us to
rally around our school and team, and the athletes
needed us to support them to victory. We affec
tionately called the cheerleaders and dancers
"Band-Aids" because we worked together with
them to motivate the crowd, even in the moments
when our team was beyond hope. It wasn't about
the final score. It was about the game.
As Big Game approaches this year, I'd like to
encourage all the football players of the Stan
ford team to keep in mind the reciprocal rela
tionship that they have with us fans. In turn, it is
up to us fans to be firm athletic supporters. To
gether, we're all a part of the game, playing for
the same team.

Jocks and athletic supporters can e-mail Adam at
