Hyphenating "Asian-American"
implies foreignness
I would like to applaud The Daily ("Stu
dents praise LTS conference", Nov. 14) for
covering the Asian American issues confer
ence "Listen to the Silence" this past week
end. However, I would like to point out one
minor inaccuracy: placing a hyphen in
"Asian-Americans" is no longer common
practice by scholars and writers.
Richard Kim wrote a similar letter on
May 9,2003, noting that the hyphenated term
"Asian-American" "implies that Americans
of Asian descent are not fully American —
that the two are equally interchangeable in
both meaning and significance."

The hyphen creates a sense of "otherness"
where Asian Americans are neither fully
American nor Asian. Implying this foreignness
is opposite the goals of "Listen to the Silence"
and dehumanizing to Asian Americans. I
would urge the author and future articles by
The Daily staff to remain mindful of this seem
ingly trivial, hut significant distinction.

Protest should be aimed at Mexico
Those in MEChA who are protesting
("MEChA protests for immigrants," Nov.
15) should realize that their energy should
he directed toward Mexico. Mexico has a re

sponsibility to provide a better life for its cit
izens. It should also provide a better business
climate so young Mexicans can find work. It
is not the responsibility of the United States
to provide welfare for them. For those who
die trying to enter America, it is not our
fault, and we should not be made to feel
guilty about it. MEChA should realize that.

Lambdas should open marrow-typing
drives to all
Two years ago, I read an advertisement
for a Lambda Phi Epsilon-sponsored bone
marrow-typing drive. I stopped by the fra

ternity's booth intending to donate, but was
turned away because I am Caucasian and
the blood drive was for minorities only. Last
week, I was pleased to see that Lambda Phi
Epsilon was again running a marrow-typing
drive, but disappointed to discover that, as
before, I could not donate because I happen
to be white. This time — instead of being
turned away outright — I was told by a po
lite attendant that I could donate, but
would have to pay $65.
This is inappropriate. Especially for
something as important as the national
bone marrow donor database, asking peo
ple of one ethnic group to pay while allow
ing others to give for free is unacceptable. I
understand that minorities are underrep

resented in the database, but by no means
does that make my blood less valuable —
as forcing me to pay while others do not
would imply While it may be a less-likely
chance than with minorities' blood, my
blood could still be a life-saving match for
a victim of cancer or leukemia. I certainly
agree that the cause is noble but would en
courage Lambda Phi Epsilon to pursue
other funding so that people of all ethnic
groups might have equal access to the serv
ices offered. Encouraging minority donors
is absolutely worth doing, but excluding
non-minorities is not the way to accom
plish it.
