## Senate discusses Big Game security 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate met last night to de
bate issues concerning Big Game safety and student group
fundraising.The Senate also revisited discussion on the pro
posal to extend Green Library's hours and touched on a new
coffee shop opening on University Avenue.
Stanford Chief of Police Laura Wilson led a dialogue on
Big Game safety issues. She cautioned students against rush
ing the field after the game and warned of the dangers that
could occur if the stadium goal posts are torn down, as they
were at UC-Berkeley following the 2(X)2 game.
She cited two recent examples of students at other uni
versities suffering serious injuries after being crushed by
falling goal posts.
"It's not people trying to be malicious or mean; it's peo
ple getting caught up in the moment," Wilson said. "Crowds
take on a life of their own, and I don't think any fan wants
anyone to get hurt, but sometimes the crowd mentality takes
over."
Wilson also said that many police officers will be present
at the game, with riot gear on hand in case fans become too
rowdy.
"There is no number of police officers that can control
70,000 people, so we need to stop it before anything hap
pens," Wilson said.
In addition to safety concerns, the Senate heard from
eight student groups, requesting funds. The organizations
included the Stanford Cooking Club and Delta Sigma
Theta, an African-American sorority. Since very few stu
dent groups have been lucrative in their fundraising en
deavors, the Senate may host a fundraising workshop in the
near future.
"The Senate has been having to cut back on money for
student groups because we have less money than we've had
in the past," said ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Danny Arbeit
er, a sophomore. "There are two solutions — one is to lower
student group costs and the other is to increase the amount
of money student groups earn on their own. We're planning
on holding consultations along with the Office of Student
Activities for student groups to help educate groups on how
to hold lucrative fundraisers. We're in a good position to give
advice on that topic, as is the OS A, because we oversee fund
ing for over 250 student organizations per year."
Discussion continued from last week on the possible ex
tension of Green Library's hours until 10 p.m. on Fridays,
when there is the greatest demand for extended hours, but
no decisions have yet been made on the proposal.
Among other developments, a new eatery, Caffe Del
Dogee, will open on University Avenue near the end of the
year, challenging Palo Alto's coffee-house-to-rug-dealer
ratio. Stanford students will receive 20 percent off drinks
and 10 percent off other merchandise sold at the cafe.
