## CDC helps students in job search CDC offers reference file storage services 
### ANJALEE SUJANANI 
Each year, amid coursework and ex
tracurricular activities, a new priority
begins to loom large in the lives of final
year graduate and undergraduate stu
dents — the job search.
For students whose graduation is im
minent, or for those hunting for intern
ships, Stanford's Career Development
Center (CDC) offers a variety of servic
es and resources to aid the student job
quest.
One example is the Reference File
Service, which "offers a convenient way
for you to distribute your letters of ref
erence for employment, graduate ad
missions, fellowships, internships and
scholarships," according to the CDC
Web site.
Dietra Woods, from the CDC's refer
ence file and administrative services de
partment, said that students who use
the service are divided uniformly across
the undergraduate and graduate popu
lations and that most hear about it
through workshops offered by the
CDC, information on the Web site and
by word-of-mouth.
"We store the resumes, CVs and ref
erence letters of undergraduates, grad
uate students and alumni for up to 10
years since the last time they used our
service," Woods said.
Students can learn more and register
for Reference File Service through the
CDC Web site.
Another service offered by the CDC
is Cardinal Recruiting — Stanford's
on-campus interview program which,
the Web site states "provides students
with an opportunity to interview with
employers during the fall, winter and
spring quarters. Most interviews are for
full-time, regular positions for graduat
ing students, although some interviews
are for intern and summer positions."
In order to use this service, students
need to register online for a Cardinal
Careers account and activate the Cardi
nal Recruiting feature. This needs to be
done once every academic year. Once
registered, students are able to view
profiles of participant companies
and read job descriptions. More con
veniently, they can submit resumes
and sign up for interviews.
According to Lance Choy. direc
tor of the CDC, the University
switched from JobTRAK — since
re-named MonsterTßAK — to the
current system a little more than two
years ago.
"Job postings have been increas
ing over time since then," he said,
adding that one of the reasons for the
shift is that unlike the old system,
"our job postings service is free for
employers."
"On-campus recruiting is also es
sentially a free service," Choy contin
ued. "Our aim is to keep the program
low cost and accessible to employ
ers."
So, do students actually use Car
dinal Recruiting?
"Tons of my friends and fellow
seniors use Cardinal Recruiting," af
firmed senior Malinda Groom. "[ln
vestmentj-banking and consulting
are very popular career choices, and
it's before any other job deadlines, so
people try it and see if something
works out."
"I have used Cardinal Recruiting
for full-time job opportunities this
quarter — it is very convenient since
they bring the companies right to
you and hold interviews on campus,"
she said, adding that she used the
service "almost exclusively for strat

egy consulting."
"The breadth of companies and
industries is very limited, so it's only
helpful for certain majors and inter
ests," explained Groom, an econom
ics and art history double major.
Choy agreed that certain types of
companies and job sectors tend to
use Cardinal Recruiting more than
others.
"It's all about the economics," he
said. "Employers need to decide
whether it is worthwhile to recruit on
campus."
According to Choy, the result is
that many employers who use the
Cardinal Recruiting program fall
into the categories of consulting. In
vestment-banking and engineering,
although some companies from
other areas also participate.
"There is a competitive factor,"
he pointed out. "Some employers
have come in the past but cannot
compete with the salaries offered by
I-banking and consulting firms."
To address this issue, Choy ex
plained that the CDC is looking at
"new strategies to diversify," such as
holding boutique fairs like the recent
civil engineering career fair, which
was attended by a number of con
struction companies. He added that
similar events — such as a public
service career fair and a liberal arts
career fair — will also be held in the
coming months.
In addition, he said that around 40

percent of jobs are acquired through
contacts, networks, friends or faculty,
and that students and recent alumni
should take advantage of resources
such as the Stanford Career Network
and inCircle — the Stanford alumni
only social and professional net
work.
"The job search can be very
long," conceded Choy. "Cardinal
Recruiting only accounts for about
20 percent of hires. It can take
months after graduating to get a job.
Some career fields are all about net
working and some students hate
networking. Other students plan to
move to LA or DC before looking
for a job. It all depends on what they
w«nt to do."
"Some students are in a silent
panic, hearing about second-round
interviews and thinking that they are
behind," he added. "But the reality is
that they are making the wrong as
sumptions. They shouldn't lose moti
vation or feel inadequate.They need
to come up with a plan and do some
research."
He said that the CDC offers indi
vidual appointments with career
counselors and workshops on how to
develop effective job-search strate
gies.
"In some ways consulting and I
banking are the paths of least resist
ance," Choy observed. "There are
lots of other exciting things out
there."

"There is a competitive factor,"
he pointed out. "Some employers
have come in the past but cannot
compete with the salaries offered by
I-banking and consulting firms."
To address this issue, Choy ex
plained that the CDC is looking at
"new strategies to diversify," such as
holding boutique fairs like the recent
civil engineering career fair, which
was attended by a number of con
struction companies. He added that
similar events — such as a public
service career fair and a liberal arts
career fair — will also be held in the
coming months.
In addition, he said that around 40

percent of jobs are acquired through
contacts, networks, friends or faculty,
and that students and recent alumni
should take advantage of resources
such as the Stanford Career Network
and inCircle — the Stanford alumni
only social and professional net
work.
"The job search can be very
long," conceded Choy. "Cardinal
Recruiting only accounts for about
20 percent of hires. It can take
months after graduating to get a job.
Some career fields are all about net
working and some students hate
networking. Other students plan to
move to LA or DC before looking
for a job. It all depends on what they
w«nt to do."
"Some students are in a silent
panic, hearing about second-round
interviews and thinking that they are
behind," he added. "But the reality is
that they are making the wrong as
sumptions. They shouldn't lose moti
vation or feel inadequate.They need
to come up with a plan and do some
research."
He said that the CDC offers indi
vidual appointments with career
counselors and workshops on how to
develop effective job-search strate
gies.
"In some ways consulting and I
banking are the paths of least resist
ance," Choy observed. "There are
lots of other exciting things out
there."

Career fairs to diversify
Each year, amid coursework and ex
tracurricular activities, a new priority
begins to loom large in the lives of final
year graduate and undergraduate stu
dents — the job search.
For students whose graduation is im
minent, or for those hunting for intern
ships, Stanford's Career Development
Center (CDC) offers a variety of servic
es and resources to aid the student job
quest.
One example is the Reference File
Service, which "offers a convenient way
for you to distribute your letters of ref
erence for employment, graduate ad
missions, fellowships, internships and
scholarships," according to the CDC
Web site.
Dietra Woods, from the CDC's refer
ence file and administrative services de
partment, said that students who use
the service are divided uniformly across
the undergraduate and graduate popu
lations and that most hear about it
through workshops offered by the
CDC, information on the Web site and
by word-of-mouth.
"We store the resumes, CVs and ref
erence letters of undergraduates, grad
uate students and alumni for up to 10
years since the last time they used our
service," Woods said.
Students can learn more and register
for Reference File Service through the
CDC Web site.
Another service offered by the CDC
is Cardinal Recruiting — Stanford's
on-campus interview program which,
the Web site states "provides students
with an opportunity to interview with
employers during the fall, winter and
spring quarters. Most interviews are for
full-time, regular positions for graduat
ing students, although some interviews
are for intern and summer positions."
In order to use this service, students
need to register online for a Cardinal
Careers account and activate the Cardi
nal Recruiting feature. This needs to be
done once every academic year. Once
registered, students are able to view
profiles of participant companies
and read job descriptions. More con
veniently, they can submit resumes
and sign up for interviews.
According to Lance Choy. direc
tor of the CDC, the University
switched from JobTRAK — since
re-named MonsterTßAK — to the
current system a little more than two
years ago.
"Job postings have been increas
ing over time since then," he said,
adding that one of the reasons for the
shift is that unlike the old system,
"our job postings service is free for
employers."
"On-campus recruiting is also es
sentially a free service," Choy contin
ued. "Our aim is to keep the program
low cost and accessible to employ
ers."
So, do students actually use Car
dinal Recruiting?
"Tons of my friends and fellow
seniors use Cardinal Recruiting," af
firmed senior Malinda Groom. "[ln
vestmentj-banking and consulting
are very popular career choices, and
it's before any other job deadlines, so
people try it and see if something
works out."
"I have used Cardinal Recruiting
for full-time job opportunities this
quarter — it is very convenient since
they bring the companies right to
you and hold interviews on campus,"
she said, adding that she used the
service "almost exclusively for strat

egy consulting."
"The breadth of companies and
industries is very limited, so it's only
helpful for certain majors and inter
ests," explained Groom, an econom
ics and art history double major.
Choy agreed that certain types of
companies and job sectors tend to
use Cardinal Recruiting more than
others.
"It's all about the economics," he
said. "Employers need to decide
whether it is worthwhile to recruit on
campus."
According to Choy, the result is
that many employers who use the
Cardinal Recruiting program fall
into the categories of consulting. In
vestment-banking and engineering,
although some companies from
other areas also participate.
"There is a competitive factor,"
he pointed out. "Some employers
have come in the past but cannot
