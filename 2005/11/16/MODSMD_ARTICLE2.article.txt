Each year, amid coursework and ex
tracurricular activities, a new priority
begins to loom large in the lives of final
year graduate and undergraduate stu
dents — the job search.
For students whose graduation is im
minent, or for those hunting for intern
ships, Stanford's Career Development
Center (CDC) offers a variety of servic

quest.
One example is the Reference File
Service, which "offers a convenient way
for you to distribute your letters of ref

missions, fellowships, internships and
scholarships," according to the CDC
Web site.
Dietra Woods, from the CDC's refer

the service are divided uniformly across
the undergraduate and graduate popu

through workshops offered by the
CDC, information on the Web site and
by word-of-mouth.
"We store the resumes, CVs and ref
erence letters of undergraduates, grad
uate students and alumni for up to 10
years since the last time they used our
service," Woods said.
Students can learn more and register
for Reference File Service through the
CDC Web site.
Another service offered by the CDC
is Cardinal Recruiting — Stanford's
on-campus interview program which,
the Web site states "provides students
with an opportunity to interview with
employers during the fall, winter and
spring quarters. Most interviews are for
full-time, regular positions for graduat
ing students, although some interviews
are for intern and summer positions."
In order to use this service, students
need to register online for a Cardinal
Careers account and activate the Cardi
nal Recruiting feature. This needs to be
done once every academic year. Once
registered, students are able to view
