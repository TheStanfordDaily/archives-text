## Junior looks to win big in Jeopardy final 
### KELLEY FONG 
He may not be a starter on the varsity football
team, but junior Nico Martinez is in position to win a
big game for Stanford this week.
On last night's episode of College Championship
Jeopardy, aired on ABC, Martinez emerged victorious
from his semifinal round to advance to the final round
on the quiz show, which will air on Thursday and Fri
day nights.
Martinez, who is a member of Stanford's Quizbowl
team, competed in early October against 14 other stu
dents from universities across the country in the annu
al tournament, held this year in Raleigh, N.C. at North
Carolina State University.
In his quarterfinal round, which aired Nov. 11, Mar
tinez defeated Colin Brown, a senior at the University
of Rochester, and Anna Allie, a junior at the Universi
ty of Michigan-Dearborn, finishing the game with a
commanding sum of $14,399 compared with Brown's
$2,(XX) and Allie'ssl.
Unfortunately, the end of a Pacific-10 Conference
football game televised on ABC cut into the first half
of the episode, so Bay Area viewers were only able to
watch the end of the quarterfinal match. Though he
trailed for the first part of the game, Martinez had built
up a considerable lead by the end.
One memorable moment occurred when AlexTre
bek read the clue, "This American Idol singer from
Raleigh lost to Reuben in 2003," and an animated
Martinez answered with an enthusiastic smile —
"Who is Clay Aiken?"
Later, during the semifinal round. Martinez told
the audience how his sister had taken him to a Clay
Aiken concert, where he was selected to dance on
stage with Clay Aiken himself.
With this quarterfinal victory, Martinez advanced
to the semifinals, where he competed against Ben
Goldman, a sophomore at New York University, and
Alison Jenik, a junior at the University of Maryland.
The episode aired Tbesday night.
Martinez said he felt the most pressure during the
seminfals, but remarked, "I felt more confident with
the buzzer [during the semifinal round]. I had a better
feel for the timing and a better feeling onstage."
Boosted by this new confidence, Martinez used his
knowledge of composers, dead scientists, government
and politics, among other subjects, to build his lead
that only increased over the course of the game.
"He is doing well because he gets to answer the
questions quickest and does so authoritatively, never

second guesses himself" said Martinez's girlfriend,
junior Becky Garza. "Most importantly, he thinks on
his toes."
Before the Final Jeopardy question. Martinez had
a lead of more than $9,(XX). He was the only contestant
to answer the question correctly and once again dom
inated the competition, finishing the game with
$26,401 to his competitors' $5 and $1, respectively.
Sophomore Alex Williamson, who watched the
episode, remarked, "The point disparity at the end of
the match was the greatest I've seen on Jeopardy."
Martinez's victory in the semifinal round ensured
him a spot in the cumulative, two-day finals. Martinez
will compete for the top prize of $l(X).(XX), but he is
guaranteed $25,(XX) just for appearing in the finals.
Until the show airs at the end of the week, howev
er, Martinez cannot talk about the outcome of the final
round.
"It's been so hard just to not tell people what hap
pened." he said. "Everyone wants to know, but I really
want people to see it for themselves."
No matter what happens, though, Martinez consid
ered his experience extremely positive.
"Since high school, I've thought it'd be the coolest
thing ever to be on that show," Martinez said. "I used
to watch Jeopardy with my grandfather and compete
against him, and I think he's having a real good time
watching this."
Now that he has been on stage, buzzer in hand and
face-to-face with Alex Trebek, Martinez said his fa
vorite part of the Jeopardy experience was just "being

up there and playing the game — doing something
you like to do and being rewarded for it." He added,
"It's pretty cool to be representing your school, too —
it was a more collegiate atmosphere."
Garza said she believes that Martinez has been suc
cessful on the show "not only because he has a pletho
ra of knowledge in many disciplines of study and has a
great memory, but because he is level-headed," she
said. "1 knew he wouldn't be as nervous as other com
petitors because he is confident, and, as an athlete,
seems to revel in the pressures of competition."
Garza helped Martinez prepare for the show in the
months leading up to the taping.
"He would ask to be quizzed all the time," she said.
"Even when we'd be at the beach or just relaxing, I'd
have to quiz him on famous monarchs, Oscar winners,
etc. I think the funniest thing I did to help was read him
Jeopardy questions over the phone as he drove from
my house in Chicago back to Stanford at the start of
% this school year."
Martinez, a political science and geology major,
claimed his best subjects were geography and history,
but that they were "sort of the catalysts" for other
fields of study tested on the show. "I'm just an interest
ed person," he said.
Looking back on his Jeopardy experience but of
fering no hints as to the tournament's final outcome,
Martinez said, "I was really happy with how things
went. I'm very appreciative of the opportunity to do
something like that, and I've stayed in touch with a lot
of the other kids on the show. I had a lot of fun."
