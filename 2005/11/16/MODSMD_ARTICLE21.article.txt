## MEN'S GOLF Cardinal defy rankings to take third in tourney Stanford squad fires on all cylinders as it closes outfall season with strong effort 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its final event of the fall season, the Stanford men's golf team
saw its hard work pay off at the Collegiate Match Play Champi
onships in Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla. this past weekend. The No. 15
seeded Cardinal placed third in a strong field of 16 teams and
recorded a noteworthy win over No. 2 Oklahoma State in the first
round of play.
The Cowboys came in as the defending tournament champions,
but the Stanford men were able to overcome the challenge, 3-2-0.
In the second round of the tournament, the Cardinal defeated No.
10 seeded Coastal Carolina, 3-1-1.
However, the second day of play brought Stanford a disap
pointing loss to No. 3 Georgia Tech, 3-2-0. The men then entered
the consolation bracket, where they defeated Arizona 3-1-1 in a
narrow match to claim third place.
"It was a good week," head coach Conrad Ray said. "It's hard
to come by, and I feel that after that first day, the guys felt better
about themselves, the team and the game. So it was good to see that
outcome. Third in that field is a pretty big accomplishment for our
group of guys."
The odds weren't in the Cardinal's favor when they took on No.
2 seed Oklahoma State on Friday. But the team didn'f let the com
petition scare them.
"We absolutely were the underdog," senior Kyle Gentry said.
"Oklahoma State is a great team, but every one of our guys knew
that we could beat them. It wasn't a question about talent — it was
purely about who wanted it more."
After several disappointing finishes earlier in the season, the
men wanted to prove themselves. The match-play format of the
tournament offered an opportunity for an upset that the team de
livered upon.
"I was really proud of our team," sophomore Rob Grube said.
"I couldn't ask for a better or tougher group of guys. It takes a con
certed effort from all of the players to beat a team with Oklahoma
State's depth and talent."
Although Grube lost to the Cowboys' top-ranked Pablo Mar
tin (five and three), and junior Matt Savage lost to Tyler Leon
(seven and five), the Cardinal got three solid performances from
juniors Matt Shin and Zack Miller, who both won two-up, and
from Gentry, who won three and four.
"I was obviously very disappointed about my individual match,
but that disappointment was quickly replaced with jubilation as
soon as our team pulled out the victory," Grube said. "I was proud
that I never gave up, but I can't say that I was proud to lose. Pablo
is a very good player, and I learned a lot from our match. I'll work
hard this winter to close the gap between us."
Facing competition of Oklahoma State's caliber, closing the gap
as a team was a major accomplishment for the men after weeks of
inconsistent play.
"I feel like we've been working hard and the guys have been
doing the right things in terms of preparation," Ray said. "So, it

wasn't so much how we played as it
was that we just played solid against
them."
The Oklahoma State match
demonstrated the Cardinal's poten
tial given the right circumstances.
"The win shows a lot about our
team," Shin said. "We were ranked
18th in the preseason and had not
yet played to that level. But the
tournament definitely proved that
we are in fact better than a lot of the
teams."
But Stanford proved unable to
follow up its wins over the Cowboys
and Coastal Carolina the next day
when it faced Georgia Tech. The Car
dinal kept pace with the Yellow Jack
ets until falling in close defeat over
the final holes.

Georgia Tech fell to No. 1 Geor
gia, 3-2-0, in the championship round
as Stanford came into contention for
third place.
"I think we could have played
better against Georgia Tech," Gen
try said. "It was obviously close with
the deciding match coming down to
the final hole. It could just as easily
have been us against Georgia in the
final match. Unfortunately,their putt
went in."
The Cardinal missed the opportu
nity to defeat a No. 3 squad after de
feating a No. 2 squad, but Sunday
brought Stanford face to face with
Pacific-10 Conference rival Arizona.
The Cardinal played a close match
and posted three one-ups to win,
capping off their fall season with a

third place overall finish.
"It's a great way to end the fall,"
Ray said. "It'll give us some motiva
tion, a sense of what we can do in the
spring if we keep working hard."
For the spring to be as successful
as this past weekend, the Cardinal
have to transfer their confidence and
aggression from match to regular
play
"This tournament showed the in
tensity we need every time we play a
tournament," Shin said. "If we can
enter each stroke-play event with
the same intensity as a match-play
event, we should see strong play in
the spring."
The men's golf team next plays at
the Taylor Made Waikoloa in Kona,
Hawaii, Feb. 8-10.

"This tournament showed the in
tensity we need every time we play a
tournament," Shin said. "If we can
enter each stroke-play event with
the same intensity as a match-play
event, we should see strong play in
the spring."

Cardinal flash potential in Florida
In its final event of the fall season, the Stanford men's golf team
saw its hard work pay off at the Collegiate Match Play Champi
onships in Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla. this past weekend. The No. 15
seeded Cardinal placed third in a strong field of 16 teams and
recorded a noteworthy win over No. 2 Oklahoma State in the first
round of play.
The Cowboys came in as the defending tournament champions,
but the Stanford men were able to overcome the challenge, 3-2-0.
In the second round of the tournament, the Cardinal defeated No.
10 seeded Coastal Carolina, 3-1-1.
However, the second day of play brought Stanford a disap
pointing loss to No. 3 Georgia Tech, 3-2-0. The men then entered
the consolation bracket, where they defeated Arizona 3-1-1 in a
narrow match to claim third place.
"It was a good week," head coach Conrad Ray said. "It's hard
to come by, and I feel that after that first day, the guys felt better
about themselves, the team and the game. So it was good to see that
outcome. Third in that field is a pretty big accomplishment for our
group of guys."
The odds weren't in the Cardinal's favor when they took on No.
2 seed Oklahoma State on Friday. But the team didn'f let the com
petition scare them.
"We absolutely were the underdog," senior Kyle Gentry said.
"Oklahoma State is a great team, but every one of our guys knew
that we could beat them. It wasn't a question about talent — it was
purely about who wanted it more."
After several disappointing finishes earlier in the season, the
men wanted to prove themselves. The match-play format of the
tournament offered an opportunity for an upset that the team de
livered upon.
"I was really proud of our team," sophomore Rob Grube said.
"I couldn't ask for a better or tougher group of guys. It takes a con
certed effort from all of the players to beat a team with Oklahoma
State's depth and talent."
Although Grube lost to the Cowboys' top-ranked Pablo Mar
tin (five and three), and junior Matt Savage lost to Tyler Leon
(seven and five), the Cardinal got three solid performances from
juniors Matt Shin and Zack Miller, who both won two-up, and
from Gentry, who won three and four.
"I was obviously very disappointed about my individual match,
but that disappointment was quickly replaced with jubilation as
soon as our team pulled out the victory," Grube said. "I was proud
that I never gave up, but I can't say that I was proud to lose. Pablo
is a very good player, and I learned a lot from our match. I'll work
hard this winter to close the gap between us."
Facing competition of Oklahoma State's caliber, closing the gap
as a team was a major accomplishment for the men after weeks of
inconsistent play.
"I feel like we've been working hard and the guys have been
doing the right things in terms of preparation," Ray said. "So, it

wasn't so much how we played as it
was that we just played solid against
them."
The Oklahoma State match
demonstrated the Cardinal's poten
tial given the right circumstances.
"The win shows a lot about our
team," Shin said. "We were ranked
18th in the preseason and had not
yet played to that level. But the
tournament definitely proved that
we are in fact better than a lot of the
teams."
But Stanford proved unable to
follow up its wins over the Cowboys
and Coastal Carolina the next day
when it faced Georgia Tech. The Car
dinal kept pace with the Yellow Jack
ets until falling in close defeat over
the final holes.

Georgia Tech fell to No. 1 Geor
gia, 3-2-0, in the championship round
as Stanford came into contention for
third place.
"I think we could have played
better against Georgia Tech," Gen
try said. "It was obviously close with
the deciding match coming down to
the final hole. It could just as easily
have been us against Georgia in the
final match. Unfortunately,their putt
went in."
The Cardinal missed the opportu
nity to defeat a No. 3 squad after de
feating a No. 2 squad, but Sunday
brought Stanford face to face with
Pacific-10 Conference rival Arizona.
The Cardinal played a close match
and posted three one-ups to win,
capping off their fall season with a

third place overall finish.
"It's a great way to end the fall,"
Ray said. "It'll give us some motiva
tion, a sense of what we can do in the
spring if we keep working hard."
