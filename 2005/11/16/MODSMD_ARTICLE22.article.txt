It's not easy to concentrate on a test while
teammates storm up and down the hotel hallways.
It's probably even harder to focus on swimming
when there are papers to write and midterms to
tackle. In short, tomorrow's Speedo Cup comes at
a very hectic time for the members of the No. 3
Cardinal women's swim team â€” but that doesn't
mean they aren't ready to face this meet with a se
rious attitude.
For freshman Madeline Rovira, the upcoming
Speedo Cup will be only her fourth official com
petition as a collegiate athlete. Nevertheless, she is
prepared to deal with the combined burden of
swimming and schoolwork.
"It's tough, but the teachers and coaches seem
to understand," Rovira said.
Senior Dana Kirk, on the other hand, has been
through this countless times over her past three
years as a varsity swimmer. Though experienced
in juggling academic and athletic obligations. Kirk
acknowledges how difficult it can be to have to
think about school while on the road.
Still, she feels that this week can serve as good
practice for the new team members who will un
doubtedly face similar dilemmas in the future,
such as at the NCAA championships in March,
which take place during the same grueling week
as winter quarter finals.
While these athletes won't be able to escape
the midterms and papers, they can make sure that
these issues don't interfere with their perform
ance at the UC-Irvine-hosted meet tomorrow and
