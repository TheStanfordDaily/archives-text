# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Women set a high standard for SoCal trip Swim team looks to balance books with qualifying times

It's not easy to concentrate on a test while
teammates storm up and down the hotel hallways.
It's probably even harder to focus on swimming
when there are papers to write and midterms to
tackle. In short, tomorrow's Speedo Cup comes at
a very hectic time for the members of the No. 3
Cardinal women's swim team — but that doesn't
mean they aren't ready to face this meet with a se
rious attitude.
For freshman Madeline Rovira, the upcoming
Speedo Cup will be only her fourth official com
petition as a collegiate athlete. Nevertheless, she is
prepared to deal with the combined burden of
swimming and schoolwork.
"It's tough, but the teachers and coaches seem
to understand," Rovira said.
Senior Dana Kirk, on the other hand, has been
through this countless times over her past three
years as a varsity swimmer. Though experienced
in juggling academic and athletic obligations. Kirk
acknowledges how difficult it can be to have to
think about school while on the road.
Still, she feels that this week can serve as good
practice for the new team members who will un
doubtedly face similar dilemmas in the future,
such as at the NCAA championships in March,
which take place during the same grueling week
as winter quarter finals.
While these athletes won't be able to escape
the midterms and papers, they can make sure that
these issues don't interfere with their perform
ance at the UC-Irvine-hosted meet tomorrow and

The Stanford men's swimming team heads south this weekend for the 2005 Speedo Cup, hosted by UC-lrvine. Last year,
both the Cardinal men and women managed to successfully bring home championship titles from the meet.
Friday.
The Speedo Cup has the same
format as the NCAA meets that take
place after Christmas, in which com
petitors first swim preliminary races
in order to qualify for finals later that
same day Head coach Lea Maurer
sees the Speedo Cup as an opportu
nity to run through the trials-finals
format, giving the swimmers a
chance to race one last time this
quarter before the tough training pe
riod begins.
From Thanksgiving through
Christmas break, the team plans to
see less competition and more in

tense conditioning until its first dual
meet at the end of January.
Right now, however, Maurer has
a specific goal for the Speedo Cup.
While the upcoming meet will not be
as highly competitive as the meets
during the actual swimming season,
she still has high expectations for her
athletes. By the end of the meet, she
hopes to secure as many NCAA
qualifying times as possible.
This strategy marks quite a
change from previous years, when
Cardinal teams would typically aim
to qualify for the NCAA champi
onships at Pacific-1() Conference
meets in February.
Kirk and Maurer both acknowl
edge that it will be difficult to
achieve individual best times so
early in the year, but they are confi
dent that Stanford will have a hand

ful of NCAA qualifiers by the end of
the meet. As the team still has
months of training to refine form
and improve fitness, Maurer feels
that the Speedo Cup could be a chal
lenge for her swimmers, as she is
"sending them in half-prepared,
hoping for greatness."
While it might seem a difficult
task for team members to motivate
themselves for a preseason meet
with so many other things on their
minds. Kirk attests that the team will
not be hindered by a lack of enthusi
asm or determination.
"Motivation is something that
comes from making sure that you al
ways know why you're there," Kirk
said. "Personally, I'm going [to the
Speedo Cup] to make an A cut."
She is also convinced that her
teammates will do the same.

format, giving the swimmers a
chance to race one last time this
quarter before the tough training pe
riod begins.
From Thanksgiving through
Christmas break, the team plans to
see less competition and more in

tense conditioning until its first dual
meet at the end of January.
Right now, however, Maurer has
a specific goal for the Speedo Cup.
While the upcoming meet will not be
as highly competitive as the meets
during the actual swimming season,
she still has high expectations for her
athletes. By the end of the meet, she
hopes to secure as many NCAA
qualifying times as possible.
This strategy marks quite a
change from previous years, when
Cardinal teams would typically aim
to qualify for the NCAA champi
onships at Pacific-1() Conference
meets in February.
Kirk and Maurer both acknowl
edge that it will be difficult to
achieve individual best times so
early in the year, but they are confi
dent that Stanford will have a hand

ful of NCAA qualifiers by the end of
the meet. As the team still has
months of training to refine form
and improve fitness, Maurer feels
that the Speedo Cup could be a chal
lenge for her swimmers, as she is
"sending them in half-prepared,
hoping for greatness."
While it might seem a difficult
task for team members to motivate
themselves for a preseason meet
with so many other things on their
minds. Kirk attests that the team will
not be hindered by a lack of enthusi
asm or determination.
"Motivation is something that
comes from making sure that you al
ways know why you're there," Kirk
said. "Personally, I'm going [to the
Speedo Cup] to make an A cut."
She is also convinced that her
teammates will do the same.
