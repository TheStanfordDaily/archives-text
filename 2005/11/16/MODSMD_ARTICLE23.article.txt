## Promising fall finish for Stanford crew 
### EMILY CRAMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a day full of whitecaps and windy
conditions last Saturday in Seattle, Wash.,
Sunday dawned with miraculously calmer
skies and water, just in time for the 2005
Head of the Lake (HOTL) regatta.
In their respective races, the Stanford

women's varsity eight placed fifth, the
women's JV eight took third, and the
women's four finished 10th.The men's var
sity boat came in second behind Washing
ton.and the men's JV boat was excluded
after going off course.
After an interesting start to their season
at the Head of the American regatta, in
which they were defeated bv the JV boat.

the varsity women proved their power this
weekend with a fifth-place finish in a strong
field.
More telling than their placement was
the fact that the top seven boats all finished
within 10 seconds of each other on the
4.6(X)-nieter course. The Stanford women
completed the course in 16:39, with
UCLA, Washington and Yale finish
ing between them and the winning
Washington State boat.
Yale, UCLA, and UW all compet
ed alongside Stanford in last year's
NCAA championships, so the Stan
ford women fully anticipated a tough
race. The boats' close times at the
HOTL suggest that the Cardinal will
likely be among the top regional and
national crews come springtime.
"We got a taste of the tough com
petition in the west region and
proved that we can compete,"
women's head coach Aimee Baker
said.
Baker also commented on the in
tensity and strength of this year's
team as it heads into winter condi
tioning and complimented the
women on their progress compared
to last year's crew.
"We have a much stronger and
deeper group this season as com
pared to last," she said.
Sustained by the momentum of
their strong finish this weekend, the
team heads into winter conditioning
with their sights set on a successful
spring season.
"What motivates us in the winter,
through the rainy days on the water
and in the weight room, is that every
stroke brings us closer to whatever
goals we set for spring season and
NCAA's," senior Susan Beville said.
The men's team came off the
water at the HOTL with an equally
strong finish. Like the women, the
men placed second to powerhouse
Washington. But with a course time
of 14:57, the men beat out strong
Canadian crews from Victoria and
British Columbia in addition to re
gional rival Oregon State. The Cardi
nal lost to UW by a modest gap of 18
seconds, but senior Jake Cornelius
expressed confidence that his crew
can do much better than that.
"We were disappointed to finish

so far behind UW," he said. "It is their
home course, but that doesn't explain
away the large margin between our
crews."
Cornelius noted that the defeat of
the two Canadian crews was a signif
icant accomplishment for the Cardi
nal, as the Victoria and BC boats are
considered the top two boats in
Canada. Similarly, Stanford's victory
over Oregon State bodes well as a
measurement of the team's progress
since last year.
"This year we are well ahead of
our previous years, both in fitness and
in technical prowess," Cornelius said.
In addition to demonstrating the
team's rower power, the HOTL high
lighted the importance of leadership
in the coxswain box. Junior Alex Gar
cia, the varsity boat's coxswain, guid
ed the Stanford eight through the sce
nic course expertly.
"He has come a long way since last
year, and by spring he'll be a force to
be reckoned with at Redwood
Shores," Cornelius said.
As a testament to the importance
of boat guidance, the men's JV boat
was excluded from their race after
straying outside the course's buoy
markers.
The Stanford lightweights also
have set their sights on training for
spring after a successful fall season.
Head coach A 1 Acosta said that he
was looking forward to gaining addi
tional team experience when three of
the squad's rowers return from
abroad this winter.
Acosta emphasized that the light
weights already have an advantage of
experience over last year's team. The
team goals for the winter include
maintaining high morale, improving
fitness and continuing to develop the
novice rowers as important team
contributors.
After making their debut in colle
giate rowing this fall, the novice crews
of the men's, women's and light
weight squads also begin an intense
winter of conditioning. The teams are
looking to focus on efficiency and
technique — especially for the tal
ented, but less experienced, walk-on
rowers.

of boat guidance, the men's JV boat
was excluded from their race after
straying outside the course's buoy
markers.
The Stanford lightweights also
have set their sights on training for
spring after a successful fall season.
Head coach A 1 Acosta said that he
was looking forward to gaining addi
tional team experience when three of
the squad's rowers return from
abroad this winter.
Acosta emphasized that the light
weights already have an advantage of
experience over last year's team. The
team goals for the winter include
maintaining high morale, improving
fitness and continuing to develop the
novice rowers as important team
contributors.
After making their debut in colle
giate rowing this fall, the novice crews
of the men's, women's and light
weight squads also begin an intense
winter of conditioning. The teams are
looking to focus on efficiency and
technique — especially for the tal
ented, but less experienced, walk-on
rowers.
After a day full of whitecaps and windy
conditions last Saturday in Seattle, Wash.,
Sunday dawned with miraculously calmer
skies and water, just in time for the 2005
Head of the Lake (HOTL) regatta.
In their respective races, the Stanford

women's varsity eight placed fifth, the
women's JV eight took third, and the
women's four finished 10th.The men's var
sity boat came in second behind Washing
ton.and the men's JV boat was excluded
after going off course.
After an interesting start to their season
at the Head of the American regatta, in
which they were defeated bv the JV boat.

the varsity women proved their power this
weekend with a fifth-place finish in a strong
field.
More telling than their placement was
the fact that the top seven boats all finished
within 10 seconds of each other on the
4.6(X)-nieter course. The Stanford women
completed the course in 16:39, with
UCLA, Washington and Yale finish
ing between them and the winning
Washington State boat.
Yale, UCLA, and UW all compet
ed alongside Stanford in last year's
NCAA championships, so the Stan
ford women fully anticipated a tough
race. The boats' close times at the
HOTL suggest that the Cardinal will
likely be among the top regional and
national crews come springtime.
"We got a taste of the tough com
petition in the west region and
proved that we can compete,"
women's head coach Aimee Baker
said.
Baker also commented on the in
tensity and strength of this year's
team as it heads into winter condi
tioning and complimented the
women on their progress compared
to last year's crew.
"We have a much stronger and
deeper group this season as com
pared to last," she said.
Sustained by the momentum of
their strong finish this weekend, the
team heads into winter conditioning
with their sights set on a successful
spring season.
"What motivates us in the winter,
through the rainy days on the water
and in the weight room, is that every
stroke brings us closer to whatever
goals we set for spring season and
NCAA's," senior Susan Beville said.
The men's team came off the
water at the HOTL with an equally
strong finish. Like the women, the
men placed second to powerhouse
Washington. But with a course time
of 14:57, the men beat out strong
Canadian crews from Victoria and
British Columbia in addition to re
gional rival Oregon State. The Cardi
nal lost to UW by a modest gap of 18
seconds, but senior Jake Cornelius
expressed confidence that his crew
can do much better than that.
"We were disappointed to finish

so far behind UW," he said. "It is their
home course, but that doesn't explain
away the large margin between our
crews."
Cornelius noted that the defeat of
the two Canadian crews was a signif
icant accomplishment for the Cardi
nal, as the Victoria and BC boats are
considered the top two boats in
Canada. Similarly, Stanford's victory
over Oregon State bodes well as a
measurement of the team's progress
since last year.
"This year we are well ahead of
our previous years, both in fitness and
in technical prowess," Cornelius said.
In addition to demonstrating the
team's rower power, the HOTL high
lighted the importance of leadership
in the coxswain box. Junior Alex Gar
cia, the varsity boat's coxswain, guid
ed the Stanford eight through the sce
nic course expertly.
"He has come a long way since last
year, and by spring he'll be a force to
be reckoned with at Redwood
Shores," Cornelius said.
As a testament to the importance
of boat guidance, the men's JV boat
was excluded from their race after
straying outside the course's buoy
markers.
