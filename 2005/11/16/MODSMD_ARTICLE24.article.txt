# Six reasons not to miss Big Game
## 
### 
The frenzy surrounding Big
Game has started. If you take
a stroll pretty much anywhere
on campus, you can definitely see it.
Unquestionably one of the most
exciting times on campus all year,
this is the week that all Stanford-af
filiates can find an excuse to dress in
red all the time, dangle mangled
bears on backpacks and bikes and
yell/e-mail random hate slogans at
anything and everything that is or
could be associated with Cal. Okay,
so you can do all those things all the
time, but now is the time that these
can be expected.
Yet, with all the excitement and
widespread Cal-bashing going on,
what surprises me most is the num
ber of people who are not planning
on going to the actual game. I aim to
convince you that there isn't any
reason that you shouldn't be at
Stanford Stadium at 4 p.m. on Satur
day to see the 108 th Big Game.
First, let's get rid of the simple
excuses that I've either heard or can
anticipate:
1) "I've already made travel
plans to leave Friday night." You re
ally can't use this excuse without re
vealing that you just don't have any
other justification. Don't you re
member the barrage of e-mails,
postcards, letters and more post
cards from the university letting you
know that Big Game was going to
occur on the Saturday before
Thanksgiving break â€” that started
spring quarter when the schedule
was set?
2) "I have to study/work this
weekend." No, you don't! I don't
care how much needs to get done.
You can leave three hours on a Sat
urday afternoon for the game. For
once, this is a weekend that we don't
have to worry about classes for an
other nine days.
Now. let's tackle the excuses that
might be considered serious, if only
for a few seconds.
3) "I don't know anything about
football. I'd be lost and so it'd be a
waste." Football knowledge is most
definitely not a prerequisite for at
tending Big Game. You have three
more days to get yourself down to
White Plaza and let some Axe-
Comm maniac (and I only say this
with love and admiration for them)
act out all the rules of American
football and relive all the Stanford
football drama right before your
eyes until you're as well-versed in
Big Game history as they are. Or e
mail me.
4) "It's a fun idea, but it's not
thaaat big a deal." Did you know
that the Big Game is the l()th
biggest rivalry in college football
history? This 108 th game is going to
be followed by college football
gurus across the country And you
thought this was just a game be
tween two (or in some eyes, one)

teams of intellectuals.
5) "We're definitely not going to
win anyway." You couldn't be more
wrong. Stanford is fourth in the Pac
-10, and Cal is fifth. We have won
four of our last six games, with two
losses coming at the hands of two
then-undefeated squads in UCLA
and USC.Translation: we have a bit
of momentum in our favor.
Cal, on the other hand, has lost
four out of their last five and is rid
ing a two-game losing streak, strug
gling to find consistency in their
Pac-10 cellar-dwelling passing of
fense. And we are long overdue.
After all, we do lead the overall
head-to-head series 54-42-11.
6) "Neither team is that good. Do
I really want to go to a game where
1 won't see a possible national
championship team?" Slow down,
there. If you've resorted to making
an excuse that there isn't enough
drama on the table here, I strongly
encourage you to take a second
look. A win at this game makes
Stanford bowl-eligible. This would
be the first time that this has hap
pened since the 2001 season.
That's right, seniors might actu
ally see the Cardinal play in Decem
ber. A win would also give Stanford
a winning 5-3 mark in conference
play. And this is for a team that most
nationwide experts picked to finish
ninth or 10th in the conference and
discounted further after the Davis
loss.
And remember: This is BIG
GAME. That should be reason
enough. Anything can happen in
the 60 minutes the players are on
the field,so come out and represent.

If you are not convinced by Samuel's
argument anil think you have a good
reason to not be at Big Game, e-mail
him at samuelc@stanford.edu so that
he can convince you that this is the
place to be on Saturday afternoon.
