penultimate weekend.

A crippled Cal attack mustered only 299 yards
of offense and committed six turnovers
against No. 1 USC (10-0,7-0), who won easi
ly at the site of their last loss 32 games ago. So poor
was Cal quarterback Joe Ayoob (9-of-19,98 yards, 0
TD,4 INT) that head coach JeffTedford called upon
backup Steve Levy in the fourth quarter. In post
game comments,Tedford labeled his squad's passing
game "futile" and its offense "one-dimensional."
After a 5-0 start, Cal (6-4,3-4) has now lost four of its

last five contests.
One bright spot for the Bears was a defense that
slowed the Trojan attack. Though USC did hold the
ball for over 36 minutes, quarterback Matt Leinart
finished without a passing score, and the USC of
fense gained an unusually low 434 yards. The victory
guaranteed the Trojans a share of the Pac-10 title,
and only tussles with Fresno State and UCLA stand
between the undefeated Trojans and the Rose Bowl,
this year's national title game.

(9-1,6-1 Pac-10) (3-7,0-7 Pac-10)

Washington State pulled off another unlikely
collapse on Saturday. Already having
blown fourth-quarter leads against Oregon
State, Cal and UCLA, the Cougars (3-7,0-7) repeat
ed the act this weekend against visiting No. 11 Ore
gon (9-1,6-1). The Ducks won on Paul Martinez' 19-
yard field goal with one second remaining.
In defeat, Cougar quarterback Alex Brink
threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns, but
Washington State's offensive star was, yet again,
senior rusher Jerome Harrison (181 total yards, 2

TDs). Harrison has rushed for 100 yards in every
contest this season.
Though outgained by 11 yards, Oregon turned in
a balanced — if not flashy — performance, as quar
terback Dennis Dixon (197 passing yards, one TD)
was the only Duck to account for over 100 yards on
the day. If the Ducks can handle a visiting Oregon
State squad this week, Oregon looks likely to claim
one of two at-large BCS spots, as the Ducks would
sport a gaudy 10-1 record (the sole blemish being
their loss to USC).

uarterback Drew Olson, who has 30 touch-
I 1 downs and only three interceptions for No.
14 UCLA (9-1,6-1), had a career day against
a Sun Devil secondary that proved susceptible to the
deep pass. The Bruin posted as many incompletions
as touchdowns (five) en route to 510 passing yards
on 22-of-27 attempts. Tight end Marcedes Lewis
caught two of Olson's touchdown strikes, and tail
back Maurice Drew ran in another score.

Sun Devil quarterback Rudy Carpenter posted
brilliant numbers for Arizona State (5-5,3-4) in de
feat, completing 27-of-37 throws for 334 yards and
three scores. With 97 yards and a touchdown on
seven receptions, receiver Derek Hagan set the Pac
-10 record for career receptions at 249. Tailback Kee
gan Herring added 129 yards and a score for the Sun
Devils, who must now defeat visiting Arizona for
bowl eligibility.

tilts? A visit to Arizona (3-7, 2-5), who re
versed much of the momentum it had gained a week
earlier in an upset of then-undefeated UCLA.
Husky quarterback Isaiah Stanback accounted for
253 yards and three touchdowns, the most dramatic
of which came on a 69-yard Hail Mary to close the
first half. Unheralded tailback James Sims added
2(M) vards and a score for the Huskies, who finished

the contest with 333 rushing yards while holding the
Wildcats to just 87.
After looking brilliant since the midseason re
placement of Richard Kovalcheck, Arizona fresh
man quarterback Willie TUitama took a step back
wards Saturday, throwing three interceptions and
fumbling the ball twice. Arizona led 7-0 and 14-7, but
no tailback or receiver finished with over 80 yards,
and the Huskies scored 31 unanswered points for the
victory.

(9-1,6-1 Pac-10) (3-7,0-7 Pac-10)

Washington State pulled off another unlikely
collapse on Saturday. Already having
blown fourth-quarter leads against Oregon
State, Cal and UCLA, the Cougars (3-7,0-7) repeat
ed the act this weekend against visiting No. 11 Ore
gon (9-1,6-1). The Ducks won on Paul Martinez' 19-
yard field goal with one second remaining.
In defeat, Cougar quarterback Alex Brink
threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns, but
Washington State's offensive star was, yet again,
senior rusher Jerome Harrison (181 total yards, 2

TDs). Harrison has rushed for 100 yards in every
contest this season.
Though outgained by 11 yards, Oregon turned in
a balanced — if not flashy — performance, as quar
terback Dennis Dixon (197 passing yards, one TD)
was the only Duck to account for over 100 yards on
the day. If the Ducks can handle a visiting Oregon
State squad this week, Oregon looks likely to claim
one of two at-large BCS spots, as the Ducks would
sport a gaudy 10-1 record (the sole blemish being
their loss to USC).

uarterback Drew Olson, who has 30 touch-
I 1 downs and only three interceptions for No.
14 UCLA (9-1,6-1), had a career day against
a Sun Devil secondary that proved susceptible to the
deep pass. The Bruin posted as many incompletions
as touchdowns (five) en route to 510 passing yards
on 22-of-27 attempts. Tight end Marcedes Lewis
caught two of Olson's touchdown strikes, and tail
back Maurice Drew ran in another score.

Sun Devil quarterback Rudy Carpenter posted
brilliant numbers for Arizona State (5-5,3-4) in de
feat, completing 27-of-37 throws for 334 yards and
three scores. With 97 yards and a touchdown on
seven receptions, receiver Derek Hagan set the Pac
-10 record for career receptions at 249. Tailback Kee
gan Herring added 129 yards and a score for the Sun
Devils, who must now defeat visiting Arizona for
bowl eligibility.

(2-8, 1 -6 Pac-10) (3-7, 2-sPac-10) J

The perfect remedy for the Washington
Huskies (2-8,1-6), losers of 14 straight Pac-10
tilts? A visit to Arizona (3-7, 2-5), who re
versed much of the momentum it had gained a week
earlier in an upset of then-undefeated UCLA.
Husky quarterback Isaiah Stanback accounted for
253 yards and three touchdowns, the most dramatic
of which came on a 69-yard Hail Mary to close the
first half. Unheralded tailback James Sims added
2(M) vards and a score for the Huskies, who finished

the contest with 333 rushing yards while holding the
Wildcats to just 87.
After looking brilliant since the midseason re
placement of Richard Kovalcheck, Arizona fresh
man quarterback Willie TUitama took a step back
wards Saturday, throwing three interceptions and
fumbling the ball twice. Arizona led 7-0 and 14-7, but
no tailback or receiver finished with over 80 yards,
and the Huskies scored 31 unanswered points for the
victory.

Just one Pacific-10 Conference contest outside of Stanford's 20-
17 win in Corvallis came down to the final minutes in the league's
penultimate weekend.
S» use 35 10 cal (al
(10-0, 7-0 Pac-10) (6-4, 3-4 Pac-10)

A crippled Cal attack mustered only 299 yards
of offense and committed six turnovers
against No. 1 USC (10-0,7-0), who won easi
ly at the site of their last loss 32 games ago. So poor
was Cal quarterback Joe Ayoob (9-of-19,98 yards, 0
TD,4 INT) that head coach JeffTedford called upon
backup Steve Levy in the fourth quarter. In post
game comments,Tedford labeled his squad's passing
game "futile" and its offense "one-dimensional."
After a 5-0 start, Cal (6-4,3-4) has now lost four of its

last five contests.
One bright spot for the Bears was a defense that
slowed the Trojan attack. Though USC did hold the
ball for over 36 minutes, quarterback Matt Leinart
finished without a passing score, and the USC of
fense gained an unusually low 434 yards. The victory
guaranteed the Trojans a share of the Pac-10 title,
and only tussles with Fresno State and UCLA stand
between the undefeated Trojans and the Rose Bowl,
this year's national title game.
