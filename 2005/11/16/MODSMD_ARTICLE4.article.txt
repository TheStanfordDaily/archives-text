# WHO KILLED DEAN JULIE?
## JUST TELL US ALREADY New and improved Gaieties kicks off 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
You may have seen the signs around
campus, begging the question that has been
on every Stanford student's mind since Gai
eties began advertising — WHO KILLED
DEAN JULIE?
Rest assured, the cast and crew of this
year's Gaieties is willing to hold the cam
pus in suspense so that everyone will have
a great time figuring out who murdered
our beloved dean of freshmen and transfer
students.
This year's director, junior Mike McCun

niff-Reid, is very excited about the final
product.
"It has been a lot of fun to work on the
show," he said. "The cast is amazing, the tech
crew has gone all out and it's going to be
amazing."
But how is Gaieties "new and improved"
this year?
"What we did is look at the things people
liked about Gaieties, and also what they
weren't that happy about," McCunniff-
Reid said. "The three things we came up
with were length, plot and sound quality."
He elaborated on how each of these is
sues is being corrected this year.

"Gaieties is a fun time, a crazy show, a re
ally great event — but this year it has a real
ly coherent plot," he said.
Also improved is the sound quality of the
performance, something that many past au
diences believe has taken away from previ
ous shows. This year, the crew brought in
special speakers just for Gaieties.
According to McCunniff-Reid, the
music is also phenomenal, with more instru
mental music that adds a new dimension to
the show.
Another issue many people have had
with Gaieties in the past is that it tends to
run a tad too long, leaving the audience

squirming in their seats by the end. This
year, however, Gaities promises to last less
than two hours, including intermission, and
organizers hope to attract those who may
not want to dedicate the entire night before
Big Game to the show itself.
Another great feature of this year's
Thursday night show is that Senior Pub
Night will start at 6:30 p.m. and lead into
Gaieties. Beer and wine will be served to
seniors and the over-21 hoping to start the
night out in traditional Pub Night style.
