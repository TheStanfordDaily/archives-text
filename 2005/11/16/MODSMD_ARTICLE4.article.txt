# WHO KILLED DEAN JULIE?
## JUST TELL US ALREADY New and improved Gaieties kicks off 
### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
You may have seen the signs around
campus, begging the question that has been
on every Stanford student's mind since Gai
eties began advertising — WHO KILLED
DEAN JULIE?
Rest assured, the cast and crew of this
year's Gaieties is willing to hold the cam
pus in suspense so that everyone will have
a great time figuring out who murdered
our beloved dean of freshmen and transfer
students.
This year's director, junior Mike McCun

niff-Reid, is very excited about the final
product.
"It has been a lot of fun to work on the
show," he said. "The cast is amazing, the tech
crew has gone all out and it's going to be
amazing."
But how is Gaieties "new and improved"
this year?
"What we did is look at the things people
liked about Gaieties, and also what they
weren't that happy about," McCunniff-
Reid said. "The three things we came up
with were length, plot and sound quality."
He elaborated on how each of these is
sues is being corrected this year.

"Gaieties is a fun time, a crazy show, a re
ally great event — but this year it has a real
ly coherent plot," he said.
Also improved is the sound quality of the
performance, something that many past au
diences believe has taken away from previ
ous shows. This year, the crew brought in
special speakers just for Gaieties.
According to McCunniff-Reid, the
music is also phenomenal, with more instru
mental music that adds a new dimension to
the show.
Another issue many people have had
with Gaieties in the past is that it tends to
run a tad too long, leaving the audience

squirming in their seats by the end. This
year, however, Gaities promises to last less
than two hours, including intermission, and
organizers hope to attract those who may
not want to dedicate the entire night before
Big Game to the show itself.
Another great feature of this year's
Thursday night show is that Senior Pub
Night will start at 6:30 p.m. and lead into
Gaieties. Beer and wine will be served to
seniors and the over-21 hoping to start the
night out in traditional Pub Night style.
Sophomore Clea Alsip, one of the leads


ALVIN CHOW/ The Stanford Daily
Gaieties 2005 dress rehearsal
on Tuesday night
in the show, said of this year's cast,
"There is so much Gaieties love! We
all get along so well and are a really
tight unit, which makes doing the
show that much more amazing."
Alsip also commented on the pro
duction's leadership.
"The staff has also been absolute
ly phenomenal this year," she said.
"They really have worked hard and
have been working longer than we
have. They started putting all this to
gether last spring."
Of course, everyone must be won
dering what the REAL star of the
show thinks of all the publicity.
"The Gaieties producer was kind
enough to ask my permission," said
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Stu
dents Julie Lythcott-Haims, of her
starring role as murdered "Dean
Julie."
"However," she continued, "it is a
bit disconcerting to see rumors of

your death publicized all over cam
pus."
Students should also know that
even though Gaieties has been large
ly overhauled this year, it will still be
the same pre-Big Game show that
Stanford students all know and love.
Senior Nicole Schuetz, another
Gaieties' director, explained the
main reason people should be excit
ed to see the show.
"Beyond all the advertizing and
the new features, it's a celebration of
Stanford," she said. "Gaities is really
pure fun, and anyone who takes it too
seriously is missing the point.The fun
part is getting everyone revved up
for the hallowed tradition of Big
Game and beating Cal."
Watch out for this year's tradi
tional spectacle. Tickets are already
sold out for Friday, but Wednesday
and Thursday shows have tickets still
available, which will be on sale in
White Plaza, online at
www.killjulie.com or at the door.
In the words of McCunniff-Reid:
"Everything that's great is even bet
ter, and everything that you might
not have liked is gone!"

Another issue many people have had
with Gaieties in the past is that it tends to
run a tad too long, leaving the audience

squirming in their seats by the end. This
year, however, Gaities promises to last less
than two hours, including intermission, and
organizers hope to attract those who may
not want to dedicate the entire night before
Big Game to the show itself.
Another great feature of this year's
Thursday night show is that Senior Pub
Night will start at 6:30 p.m. and lead into
Gaieties. Beer and wine will be served to
seniors and the over-21 hoping to start the
night out in traditional Pub Night style.

Gaieties 2005 dress rehearsal
on Tuesday night
in the show, said of this year's cast,
"There is so much Gaieties love! We
all get along so well and are a really
tight unit, which makes doing the
show that much more amazing."
Alsip also commented on the pro
duction's leadership.
"The staff has also been absolute
ly phenomenal this year," she said.
"They really have worked hard and
have been working longer than we
have. They started putting all this to
gether last spring."
Of course, everyone must be won
dering what the REAL star of the
show thinks of all the publicity.
"The Gaieties producer was kind
enough to ask my permission," said
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Stu
dents Julie Lythcott-Haims, of her
starring role as murdered "Dean
Julie."
"However," she continued, "it is a
bit disconcerting to see rumors of

your death publicized all over cam
pus."
Students should also know that
even though Gaieties has been large
ly overhauled this year, it will still be
the same pre-Big Game show that
Stanford students all know and love.
Senior Nicole Schuetz, another
Gaieties' director, explained the
main reason people should be excit
ed to see the show.
"Beyond all the advertizing and
the new features, it's a celebration of
Stanford," she said. "Gaities is really
pure fun, and anyone who takes it too
seriously is missing the point.The fun
part is getting everyone revved up
for the hallowed tradition of Big
Game and beating Cal."
Watch out for this year's tradi
tional spectacle. Tickets are already
sold out for Friday, but Wednesday
and Thursday shows have tickets still
available, which will be on sale in
White Plaza, online at
www.killjulie.com or at the door.
In the words of McCunniff-Reid:
"Everything that's great is even bet
ter, and everything that you might
not have liked is gone!"
You may have seen the signs around
campus, begging the question that has been
on every Stanford student's mind since Gai
eties began advertising — WHO KILLED
DEAN JULIE?
Rest assured, the cast and crew of this
year's Gaieties is willing to hold the cam
pus in suspense so that everyone will have
a great time figuring out who murdered
our beloved dean of freshmen and transfer
students.
This year's director, junior Mike McCun

niff-Reid, is very excited about the final
product.
"It has been a lot of fun to work on the
show," he said. "The cast is amazing, the tech
crew has gone all out and it's going to be
amazing."
But how is Gaieties "new and improved"
this year?
"What we did is look at the things people
liked about Gaieties, and also what they
weren't that happy about," McCunniff-
Reid said. "The three things we came up
with were length, plot and sound quality."
He elaborated on how each of these is
sues is being corrected this year.

"Gaieties is a fun time, a crazy show, a re
ally great event — but this year it has a real
ly coherent plot," he said.
Also improved is the sound quality of the
performance, something that many past au
diences believe has taken away from previ
ous shows. This year, the crew brought in
special speakers just for Gaieties.
According to McCunniff-Reid, the
music is also phenomenal, with more instru
mental music that adds a new dimension to
the show.
Another issue many people have had
with Gaieties in the past is that it tends to
run a tad too long, leaving the audience

squirming in their seats by the end. This
year, however, Gaities promises to last less
