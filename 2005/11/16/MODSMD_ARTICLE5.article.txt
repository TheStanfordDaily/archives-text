## NASA seeks to save campus observatory 
### ADAM WIDMAN STAFF WRITER 
A new NASA proposal seeks to pre
vent the University from razing the
Bracewell Observatory, asking it instead
to consider using the facility for a number
of new programs largely aimed at com
munity outreach.
The Observatory, which consists of
five ft()-foot radio dishes, is located in the
foothills by The Dish, its larger cousin.
Stanford slated the small dishes for dem
olition after the fire marshal declared the
site a fire hazard.
In a letter provided to The Daily by
Bob Lash, president of the Friends of the
Bracewell Observatory Association,
Joseph Statman of NASA's Jet Propul
sion Laboratory (JPL) told Pat Dcvaney.
director of Stanford's Science Outreach
Office, that the facility could be pre
served without significant cost to the Uni
versity.

"We believe that
this conversion of site 515 —
the Bracewell Observatory — can be ac
complished with minimal or no financial
burden to the University, while gaining
Stanford and NASA/J PL significant good
will from the community." Statman said.
According to Lash, the proposal sug
gests that the facility be shared by four
groups of people — the JPL outreach
program, which will use the facility to give
high schools radio astronomy access, the
Friends of the Bracewell Observatory As
sociation, which will use the facility for
amateur radio astronomy. Stanford facul
ty and students, who will use the site for
research projects, and the JPL, which will
use the site for its own projects.
He added that if they are destroyed.

then the radio dishes carry a $10
million replacement cost and that
the restoration plan would refur
nish the Observatory so that it com
plies with all safety standards.
Lash added that he has found
faculty interest in preserving the
radio dishes.
"As of Friday, five members of
the Stanford faculty have commu
nicated to JPL their interest in
using the dishes under the new
NASA/JPL plan," Lash said.
"Therefore, any University state
ment that claims no faculty interest
or no identified uses for the site
would be, quite frankly, erroneous."
However, Charles Carter of
Stanford's Planning Office said that
NASA's proposal would have to be
evaluated and approved by an aca
demic department before it could
prevent the demolition of the Ob
servatory, and that to his knowl
edge so far, no such department has
done so.
Carter also added that the Uni
versity can demolish the Observa
tory when it chooses, as Santa
Clara County has given .Stanford a
demolition permit. According to
Carter, the University has not yet
made a final decision to demolish
the dishes.
