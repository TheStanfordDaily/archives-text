## EPA high school scores remain low California tests may not reflect student achievement 
### DENISE SOHN 
Despite efforts to improve standards, stu
dents attending Stanford-operated East Palo
Alto I ligh School continue to score low on Cal
ifornia's achievement test in comparison to
low-income students in other areas, according
to a San Francisco Chronicle article published
on October 30. The University opened the
school four years ago in Menlo Park.
Education Prof. Linda Darling Hammond
explained that there are large numbers of new
English language learners at the school, ac
counting for the lower test scores. California re
quires that all students take the tests immedi
ately in English, although other states allow up
to three years before requiring that tests be
taken in English.
In addition, Hammond noted that "the test
scores have been rising every single
year since the school has opened."
She explained that the school's Acad
emic Performance Index (API) has
also exceeded the state target growth,
adding that 93 percent of the students
last year graduated on time, and 90
percent were accepted to post-sec
ondary or four-year colleges. These
are impressive numbers, especially
relative to other East Palo Alto
schools.
From Hammond's perspective, a
cursory glance at only test scores neg
lects the considerable achievements
of the students, who often face serious
obstacles.
Having worked with students in
the Ravenswood Reads program,
senior Priti Sanghani noted,"Some of
the most difficult barriers students in
East Palo Alto have to overcome are
low expectations from their commu
nities and schools. When one is not ex
pected to do well in school or even go
to college, it is much more difficult to

be self-motivated to attain those
goals."
Ravenswood Reads is a program
directed by the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service and aims to help low-in
come students facing academic diffi
culties.
Freshman Ellen Truxaw had a dif
ferent take on the difficulties facing
the students.
"I think one of the biggest obsta
cles that many of the East Palo Alto
students face is the lack of opportuni
ties to excel academically prior to
high school," she said. "Working with
one junior high student, I've been told
that the most challenging math class
offered at her school is far too easy for
her. Many of these students have the
ability to succeed given the right op
portunities. Their currently limited
educational opportunities put them
at a great disadvantage to students at
other schools."
To remedy this, Stanford is cur
rently making plans to open up a
new K-8 school in the area. Ham
mond explained that students often
come into the high school several
grade levels behind, which accounts
for the lower test scores. Opening a
new school would offer students a

better education from the beginning.
Currently, plans are underway for
a school to open for kindergarten and
first-grade students next fall. The
school is searching for a principal
right now and will begin recruiting
teachers and students in January.
In addition, Stanford faculty mem
bers are deeply involved with the op
eration of the high school.
"We've got people from the
School of Education coaching begin
ning teachers and evaluating and ad
vising on the curriculum," Hammond
explained.
Ray Bacchetti, resident scholar at
the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching, had only
words of praise for East Palo Alto
High School. As a consultant with the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Bac
chetti has visited the school to see
how the programs have been imple
mented and how the school has im
proved.
After speaking with the students,
Bacchetti noted. "I was very im
pressed by their aspirations and abili
ty to express themselves. I saw a very
nice rapport and a sense of mutuality
between the students and teachers
which isn't commonly seen."

Freshman Ellen Truxaw had a dif
ferent take on the difficulties facing
the students.
"I think one of the biggest obsta
cles that many of the East Palo Alto
students face is the lack of opportuni
ties to excel academically prior to
high school," she said. "Working with
one junior high student, I've been told
that the most challenging math class
offered at her school is far too easy for
her. Many of these students have the
ability to succeed given the right op
portunities. Their currently limited
educational opportunities put them
at a great disadvantage to students at
other schools."
To remedy this, Stanford is cur
rently making plans to open up a
new K-8 school in the area. Ham
mond explained that students often
come into the high school several
grade levels behind, which accounts
for the lower test scores. Opening a
new school would offer students a

better education from the beginning.
Currently, plans are underway for
a school to open for kindergarten and
first-grade students next fall. The
school is searching for a principal
right now and will begin recruiting
teachers and students in January.
In addition, Stanford faculty mem
bers are deeply involved with the op
eration of the high school.
"We've got people from the
School of Education coaching begin
ning teachers and evaluating and ad
vising on the curriculum," Hammond
explained.
Ray Bacchetti, resident scholar at
the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching, had only
words of praise for East Palo Alto
High School. As a consultant with the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation, Bac
chetti has visited the school to see
how the programs have been imple
mented and how the school has im
proved.
After speaking with the students,
Bacchetti noted. "I was very im
pressed by their aspirations and abili
ty to express themselves. I saw a very
nice rapport and a sense of mutuality
between the students and teachers
which isn't commonly seen."
