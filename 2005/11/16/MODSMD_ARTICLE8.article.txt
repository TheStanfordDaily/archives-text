## Jordan takes steps to prevent terror Legislation would require citizens to identify foreigners renting property 
### PAUL GARWOOD ASSOCIATED PRESS 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) â€” Jordan introduced strict
security measures aimed at foreigners Tuesday and said
it was drafting the country's first anti-terror specific leg
islation to prevent further attacks like last week's the
triple hotel bombings.
The moves came as more details emerged about the
35-year-old Iraqi woman who failed in her bid to blow
herself up in an Amman hotel, with friends saying she
had three brothers killed by U.S. forces.
The U.S. Embassy also said four Americans were
among those killed in the attacks, raising the U.S. toll
from three.
Interior Minister Awni Yirfas announced new regula
tions demanding that all Jordanians notify authorities
within 48 hours of any foreigners renting an apartment or
house.
"Violators of this regulation will face legal ramifica
tions," Yirfas said without elaborating.
Authorities will demand that Jordanians provide the
names, nationalities and passport details of any foreign
er renting a property.
Jordan also has begun drafting tough new anti-terror
ism laws that will likely be ready for parliament debate
early next year, a top Interior Ministry official said.
The laws propose allowing any suspect to be held for
questioning indefinitely and imposing penalties on
"those who would expose the lives and properties of cit
izens to danger inside and outside the country," the offi
cial said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was
unauthorized to speak to the media.
Anyone condoning or justifying terror actions or sup
porting them financially will face penalties under the
proposed laws, he added.
Ad-Dustour, Jordan's second-largest daily, also said
the legislation was being drafted, citing the interior min
ister.
Jordanian security forces already wield far-reaching
powers to arrest and hold suspects, but the proposed laws
would be the country's first specifically designed to
counter terrorism.

Jordan's stepped up security posture follows the Nov.
9 bombings of the Radisson SAS, Grand Hyatt and Days
Inn hotels in Amman by a team of Iraqis. The attackers
included three men who blew themselves up _ and killed
57 others _ and one of the men's wives, who claims her ex
plosives-packed belt malfunctioned.
Jordanian authorities had said that the captured fe
male bomber. Sajida Mubarak al-Rishawi, who comes
from the Iraqi city of Ramadi in the volatile Anbar
province, was the sister of a slain lieutenant of Abu
Musab al-Zarqawi.
TWo of the woman's friends told The Associated Press
that three of her brothers were killed by U.S. forces, in
cluding known al-Qaida in Iraq cell leader Thamir al-
Rishawi, who died during the April 2(X)4 U.S. operations
in Fallujah when an air-to-ground missile hit his pickup.
Two other brothers, Animar and Yassir, were killed in
separate attacks against US. troops in Ramadi. said the
friends, who declined to be identified further because
fearing retribution from insurgents.
A security official said lights in sections of both the
Radisson and Hyatt hotels went out just before the near

simultaneous blasts in coordinated fashion.
A DJ at the Radisson, where a Jordanian-Palestinian
wedding reception was bombed, also recalled how the
ballroom where the party was being held mysteriously
descended into darkness.
"The lights at the wedding hall went off seconds,
maybe just one second, before the blast, although there
was electricity outside the room in the corridor, the near
by lobby area and the reception," Fadi al-Kessi told AP.
"For some reason, I looked to my right in the darkness
and saw what looked liked lightening, then there was a
loud boom. It felt like the explosion came from the ceil
ing, then people started running out."
U.S. National Intelligence Director John Negroponte
arrived in Jordan on Tuesday for talks with the country's
foreign minister, the state-run Petra news agency report
ed without providing further details. The U.S. Embassy
declined to comment on Negroponte's visit.
Two forensic crime experts from Interpol also arrived
in Amman to "exchange information and expertise (with
Jordanian counterparts) in the field of fighting crime,"
according to Petra.
