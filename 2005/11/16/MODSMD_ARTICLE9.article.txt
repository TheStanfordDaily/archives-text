funnel clouds that tore off roofs and destroyed or dam

Funnel clouds were also sighted in Indiana, Illinois
and Kentucky. There were no immediate reports of se

A tornado made a direct hit on Henry County's
emergency management center, forcing authorities to
relocate to another building to handle the disaster.
County Mayor Brent Greer said.
The county medical center treated 13 people with in

the county highway department, destroyed two smaller
shops and damaged a furniture manufacturer next door,

Most of the highway department staffers were able
to take cover in the basement. "We're very fortunate,"
Greer said.
Brenda Magee was just arriving for work at the fur
niture factory when the storm hit.
"We were there for about 10 minutes under tables,
dust and everything swirling around," she said. "It was a
big roar. We heard it hit."
Another business, Paris Industrial Services, was de

"They told us just to come back tomorrow. We'll fig

Deputies in Montgomery County, northwest of
Nashville, recovered a young girl in a trailer that had
tumbled down a hill. She was uninjured.
