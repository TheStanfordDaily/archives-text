### CHRIS TOMLINSON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq's main Sunni Arab
political party yesterday demanded an international in
vestigation into allegations that security forces illegally
detained and tortured suspected insurgents at secret
jails in Baghdad.
In fighting in western Iraq, five U.S. Marines were
killed and 11 wounded while searching a house yesterday,
according to an embedded New York Times reporter. The
U.S. military does not normally report deaths until 24
hours after they happen.
In Baghdad, Omar Heikal of the Iraqi Islamic Party
said it was now clear that majority Shiites in the U.S
backed government were trying to suppress minority
Sunnis ahead of the Dec. 15 parliamentary elections.
"Our information indicates that this is not the only
place where torture is taking place," he said, reading an
official party statement. The party "calls on the United
Nations, the Arab League and humanitarian bodies to de
nounce these clear human rights violations, and we de
mand a fair, international probe so that all those who are
involved in such practices will get their just punishment."
At least four Iraqi policemen were treated at
Yarmouk Hospital for injuries they said were suffered
in beatings by men who identified themselves as Inte
rior Ministry commandos after they were stopped
Monday on patrol in the Dora neighborhood of south
west Baghdad.
An Associated Press photographer and an AP Tele
vision News cameraman saw long, thin black and blue
bruises and welts on their backs and shoulders. None of
them appeared to be so seriously injured as to require
hospitalization.
The men were visibly nervous and refused to speak
in detail about their ordeal, fearing reprisals. They told
AP journalists that they were blindfolded and taken to
an unknown location but were released after the
"Americans interfered." They refused to give their
names or say more.being allies of Iran.
