# Senate Democrats raise concerns about Alito
## Abortion rights activists worried about fate of Roe

WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Senate
Minority Leader Harry Reid yester
day said he has "significant concerns"
about Supreme Court nominee
Samuel Alito, calling President Bush's
latest choice one of the most conserva
tive judges in the United States.
"A picture of Sam Alito is emerging
that may explain why the extreme
right-wing is popping champagne
corks," Reid, D-Nev., said in a Senate
speech, referring to a 20-year-old doc
ument in which Alito asserted "the
Constitution does not protect a right
to an abortion."
Abortion rights activists are con
cerned that Alito and recently con
firmed Chief Justice John Roberts
would move the Supreme Court to the
right and perhaps overturn the land
mark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that
established abortion rights.
Alito touted his anti-abortion work
in the solicitor general's office in his
application to be deputy assistant at
torney general in 1985.That was work,
the younger Alito said,"in which I per
sonally believe very strongly."
Alito, who has served on the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
last 15 years, distanced himself from
the document Tbesday. Democratic
senators said that he assured them he
would not act as an advocate on the
court, but senators plan to question
Alito closely on abortion at his Jan. 9
confirmation hearing in front of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
"I will work to ensure that Judge
Alito is treated with civility and re

spect" Reid said."But there is nothing
disrespectful about an open and fair
minded review of a nominee's ap
proach to the Constitution and his
commitment to core American values
like equality, privacy and fairness."
Bush nominated Alito last month
as the replacement for retiring Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, who has been
a crucial swing vote on contentious is
sues, including abortion, during her 24-
year high court career.
Alito was Bush's second choice
after White House counsel Harriet
Miers withdrew under withering criti
cism from conservatives.
"Harriet Miers was forced to with
draw by conservative activists who
want to change the legal landscape of
America," Reid said. "They decided
she was inadequately radical or insuf
ficiently aggressive for their purposes,
so they gave her the boot."
Reid also complained that Bush
did not consult with Democrats about
Alito's appointment, saying he got "a
pro forma telephone call about an
hour" before the Halloween nomina
tion. He also said Bush passed up the
chance to put another woman or the
first Hispanic on the high court, in
stead choosing a white male.
"The appointment of Judge Alito
largely fails to diversify the court,"
Reid said.
As Reid and other Democrats
planned a coordinated assault on
the conservative judge from the
Senate floor, Alito was continuing
his third week of private meetings
with Republican and Democratic
senators.
Conservative Republicans have
welcomed Alito's nomination, with
some senators, including Wayne Al
lard of Colorado and Jim DeMint of
South Carolina, already saying they
will vote to confirm.
