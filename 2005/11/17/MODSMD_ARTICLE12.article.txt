## Apathy—the mono of senior year 
### 
Senior year of high school, many of my
peers were afflicted with a serious dis
ease. The symptoms included lethargy,
academic apathy and procrastination. Yet
despite receiving that beautiful acceptance
letter from Dean Mamlet in mid-December
of Senior year — along with that sappy "for
all the times you stayed up late memorizing
integrals instead of becoming a teenage
binge drinker" folder — I managed to
maintain traceable enthusiasm for school
until graduation. My motivation to finish at
the top of my class was egotistical, but, hey,
who am I to judge my high school self? At
least I had work ethic back then.
These days, I've learned to embrace my
academic mediocrity and think about other
things. My main priorities — roughly in this
order — include being the highest bidder
for Fred Segal shirts on Ebay; working out;
laughing as much as possible; DVD sets; and
trying every new tea flavor at Neotte on
University Avenue.
What about grad school? I suppose on
some level 1 still care about those pending
med school apps, but logging hours on the
adductor machine at 24 Hour Fitness is a
much more immediate concern. What else
can I do with grad school anxiety? I already
check my status at the University of Wash
ington 10 times a day while fantasizing
about my surgical rotation with the cast of
Grey's Anatomy. To a large degree, it's out
of my hands, and graduation anxiety is a
great excuse to take a mental vacation.
What about classes? Well, 1 do go, usual
ly, which is more than I can say for most of
my senior friends. But then again, 1 only
have 13 academic units and two days of class
each week.This quarter is all about interme
diate tennis, with a little David Mamet
thrown in to round out my "liberal arts" ed
ucation. 1 never thought I'd see the day that
I took a drama class, but here it is. And it's a
fabulous break from being an uptight
premed for all those years.
Fortunately, I am not alone in my inabili
ty to prioritize work and my propensity for
relaxation. Hundreds of other Stanford stu
dents share in my affliction. This illness, de
fined eloquently by Wikipedia as "senioritis,"
is a lot like mono — we pass it back and forth
to each other at Pub Night and just when you
think it's finally cured, it comes back to bite
you in the ass during finals.
Speaking of Pub Night, there is evidence
that Stanford itself is a risk factor for se
nioritis. It's hard to make it to class or finish
your paper when you're at a bar until 2 a.m.
drinking with your peers. Drinking events
— Senior Pub Night, Senior Pub Crawl, al
cohol before Gaieties and alcohol before
Big Game, for instance — are undeniably
the crux of senior year. Checking your e
mail to find your latest Spanish assignment,
you are bombarded by a slew of tempting
invitations. My inbox is a recovering alco
holic's worst nightmare.
In the end, it's not really my fault that I
am lazy and apathetic. Being uncertain
about the future makes it difficult to care
about the present. I could explain further,
but I won't bother. It's not that I don't care,
it's that I don't care enough.
In fact, this is actually the first column
I've turned in on time all quarter. But it
doesn't matter — my editor and my editor's
editor are also seniors.

Letting your senioritis go undiagnosed could
lead to permanent brain damage. Go to Pub
Night tonight or e-mail nramos@stanford. edu
for diagnosis and treatment options.
