J / I / ith finals week rapidly ap
m a J J proaching, most students are
M 1/ / being bombarded with assign-
W / ments and bogged down by
stress. This year, experiment
with a new method of pre-finals rejuvenation — yoga.
With proper stretching and exercise, you can alleviate
some anxiety and turn your body into a lean, flexible
and strong machine.
According to a study conducted by the Yoga Journal,
16.5 million Americans now practice yoga. This marks a
5.6 percent increase since 2004 and a 43 percent increase
since 2002. The fastest-growing segment of yoga aficiona
dos is the 18 to 24 age group, whose allegiance to the ac
tivity increased by 46 percent in one year, the journal says.
In addition, the study reports that almost one in
seven people who have not tried yoga — or, about 25
million people — say they intend to try yoga within the
next 12 months.
"Anyone who has tried yoga can attest that what may
begin as a physical workout soon brings a sense of calm
and quiet to our minds and hearts," says Nanci Conniff, a
yoga instructor on campus. "When you can hold your
body still you can hold your brain still. Asana [another

word for yoga postures] can begin to teach us this."
Sophomore Niji Jain, who has practiced yoga for three
years, says she agrees with Conniff s claims.
"It helps me relieve stress because for the hour or half
hour during the day that I am doing yoga, 1 am totally fo
cused on that, and not thinking about things like school,"
Jain explains. "That comes without trying. I don't have to
force myself to focus on my yoga practice — it comes by
itself."
While holding each of the yoga positions, yogis (yoga
instructors) remind their students to breathe. These cues
allow people to "focus on breathing from the stomach,
which revitalizes [their] energy and helps to clear [their]
minds," says sophomore Beth Keolanui, who has prac
ticed yoga for about a year.
Conniff explains that people decide to take up yoga
for many reasons.
"I suspect that people hear that they will develop a
sense of calm, and who doesn't need that in our world
today?" Conniff says. "Others come to increase their flex
ibility and core strength and to burn a few extra calories.
Yoga doesn't disappoint any of them."
Jain says that she does yoga not only because it is good
for flexibility, toning, breathing control and relaxation,
but also because it strengthens her mind.
"It gives me energy, and it also teaches me a lot about
how the body works, and how to best sit and stand so that

my posture is good," Jain explains. "This, in turn, prevents
me from getting lower hack pain and tension in my neck.
Knowledge of yoga also gives me handy little things that
I can apply to my daily life — like how to sit to help diges
tion, or how to get rid of hiccups, or how to have better
balance. Basically, yoga keeps me more grounded, physi
cally and mentally."
Keolanui also says she does yoga because it challenges
her to hold positions that test her strength and flexibility.
"Although yoga does these things, it also gives me time
to focus on my body, like how it feels, and what is good
and bad — sort of a tune-up." Keolanui explains.
For sophomore Kat Kershner, yoga is "purely physi
cal."
"I think using your body takes your mind off of what
isn't going right and makes you appreciate what is," Ker
shner says."I mean, maybe you have I,(MK) pages of
reading to do, but at least your knees haven't given out
on you, right?"
Kershner says that she would definitely recommend
yoga —as well as any other physical activity — for
stressed out students during finals week.
"I think Stanford students often get too caught up in
the life of the mind to pay attention to how much better
they feel after having put their bodies to use in some
way." Kershner says. "Classes are important, but all in all
it's about balance and that is what yoga is all about."

hour during the day that I am doing yoga, 1 am totally fo
cused on that, and not thinking about things like school,"
Jain explains. "That comes without trying. I don't have to
force myself to focus on my yoga practice — it comes by
itself."
While holding each of the yoga positions, yogis (yoga
instructors) remind their students to breathe. These cues
allow people to "focus on breathing from the stomach,
which revitalizes [their] energy and helps to clear [their]
minds," says sophomore Beth Keolanui, who has prac
ticed yoga for about a year.
Conniff explains that people decide to take up yoga
for many reasons.
"I suspect that people hear that they will develop a
sense of calm, and who doesn't need that in our world
today?" Conniff says. "Others come to increase their flex
ibility and core strength and to burn a few extra calories.
Yoga doesn't disappoint any of them."
Jain says that she does yoga not only because it is good
for flexibility, toning, breathing control and relaxation,
but also because it strengthens her mind.
"It gives me energy, and it also teaches me a lot about
how the body works, and how to best sit and stand so that

my posture is good," Jain explains. "This, in turn, prevents
me from getting lower hack pain and tension in my neck.
Knowledge of yoga also gives me handy little things that
I can apply to my daily life — like how to sit to help diges
tion, or how to get rid of hiccups, or how to have better
balance. Basically, yoga keeps me more grounded, physi
cally and mentally."
Keolanui also says she does yoga because it challenges
her to hold positions that test her strength and flexibility.
"Although yoga does these things, it also gives me time
to focus on my body, like how it feels, and what is good
and bad — sort of a tune-up." Keolanui explains.
For sophomore Kat Kershner, yoga is "purely physi
cal."
"I think using your body takes your mind off of what
isn't going right and makes you appreciate what is," Ker
shner says."I mean, maybe you have I,(MK) pages of
reading to do, but at least your knees haven't given out
on you, right?"
Kershner says that she would definitely recommend
yoga —as well as any other physical activity — for
stressed out students during finals week.
"I think Stanford students often get too caught up in
the life of the mind to pay attention to how much better
they feel after having put their bodies to use in some
way." Kershner says. "Classes are important, but all in all
it's about balance and that is what yoga is all about."

J / I / ith finals week rapidly ap
m a J J proaching, most students are
M 1/ / being bombarded with assign-
W / ments and bogged down by
stress. This year, experiment
with a new method of pre-finals rejuvenation — yoga.
With proper stretching and exercise, you can alleviate
some anxiety and turn your body into a lean, flexible
and strong machine.
According to a study conducted by the Yoga Journal,
16.5 million Americans now practice yoga. This marks a
5.6 percent increase since 2004 and a 43 percent increase
since 2002. The fastest-growing segment of yoga aficiona
dos is the 18 to 24 age group, whose allegiance to the ac
tivity increased by 46 percent in one year, the journal says.
In addition, the study reports that almost one in
seven people who have not tried yoga — or, about 25
million people — say they intend to try yoga within the
next 12 months.
"Anyone who has tried yoga can attest that what may
begin as a physical workout soon brings a sense of calm
and quiet to our minds and hearts," says Nanci Conniff, a
yoga instructor on campus. "When you can hold your
body still you can hold your brain still. Asana [another

word for yoga postures] can begin to teach us this."
Sophomore Niji Jain, who has practiced yoga for three
years, says she agrees with Conniff s claims.
"It helps me relieve stress because for the hour or half
hour during the day that I am doing yoga, 1 am totally fo
cused on that, and not thinking about things like school,"
Jain explains. "That comes without trying. I don't have to
force myself to focus on my yoga practice — it comes by
itself."
While holding each of the yoga positions, yogis (yoga
instructors) remind their students to breathe. These cues
allow people to "focus on breathing from the stomach,
which revitalizes [their] energy and helps to clear [their]
minds," says sophomore Beth Keolanui, who has prac
ticed yoga for about a year.
