# Tryptophan may be key to treating MS
## 
### JULIE KLEIN 
As Thanksgiving nears. many of us anticipate a filling
turkey dinner followed by a satisfying nap on the couch.
The sleepiness that usually follows a Thanksgiving meal
is often attributed to tryptophan, an amino acid found in
turkey. This is just a myth as the acid only works on an
empty stomach, according to the Stanford News Ser
vice. But this year, tryptophan may find a new claim to
legitimate fame.
Researchers at Stanford Medical School's Lawrence
Steinman Neurology Lab have discovered that the trypto
phan metabolites people form as their bodies break down
amino acids may be used as a remedy for multiple sclero
sis, an autoimmune disease that causes damage to the cen
tral nervous system.
Professor of Neurological Sciences Lawrence Stein
man and a team of Stanford researchers recently showed
that TVanilast. a drug with a chemical composition akin to
trytophan metabolites, may reverse paralytic effects of
multiple sclerosis. The exact effects of the drug, however,
are not yet known. Steinman's latest study will wrestle
with the merits of this prospective treatment and will be

published in the Nov. 4 issue of the journal Science.
"My prediction is that it will reduce relapses and
block the progression of the disease," Steinman says. He
emphasizes that this is "just a prediction," since the
chemical has not yet undergone any human trials for ef
fectiveness.
Steinman began his work when Michael Platten, a Ger
man postdoctoral researcher, proposed a study of TVani
last in conjunction with Steinman's previous multiple
sclerosis research. Steinman has spent the past 25 years at
Stanford studying the disease.
The experiments were performed on mice who had the
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)
model of multiple sclerosis. Peggy Ho, a Stanford postdoc
toral scholar in neurology and the third research team
member, says that, while other animals like rats and
guinea pigs can also be used for testing, "it's easiest to use
mice." In contrast with other experiment alternatives,
mice are the most reliable option with the lowest amount
of experimental error, she explains.
"The main focus is to develop novel therapeutics to
treat the disease," Ho says. The tests show that TVanilast
helps the mice to regain the ability to walk. It is adminis

tered when signs of leg paralysis begin to appear. It also
results in less frequent and less severe relapses, and in a re
duction of inflammatory cells.
But Steinman says that it is much easier to cure multi
ple sclerosis in mice than in humans.
TVanilast has not yet been tested in human multiple
sclerosis patients, but Steinman says that he has "very
aggressive plans to move this ahead to begin clinical
trial [in humans]."
TVanilast was developed in Japan as an anti-inflamma
tory agent, according to BioMed Central, an independent
publishing house that provides access to peer-reviewed
biomedical research. The drug is currently used clinically
to treat asthma caused by allergies and keloids — over
growths of skin tissue — but has not been tested on hu
mans with multiple sclerosis.
"I have high hopes, but the proof is in testing it in hu
mans," Steinman says, and continues that the group needs
both approval and money before these tests can begin.
Steinman predicts that this could take a year, but says he is
confident that they'll eventually receive permission and
funding for tests. While the researchers do not know ex
actly what this drug will do once tested in humans for multi

pie

scle-

rosis.

they say

they do have

high expectations

that the human results will parallel
those in mice. Steinman says he

thinks that TVanilast could eventually be used for multiple
sclerosis as well as for rheumatoid arthritis. Crohn's disease
and possibly even diabetes.
"I'm sure that this will be very exciting, not only in
multiple sclerosis, but for other diseases." Ho concur*.
"Michael deserves all of the praise. This was his proj
ect, and I'm just thankful that he brought me on
board."
