## Editorial Univ. must explore late night library options 
### 
Green Library offers the best of Stan
ford.'l"he Bender Room has some of
the most comfortable furniture on
campus, the group study rooms are a great
excuse to get together with a group of
friends to "study" and, well, we all know
what the stacks in the basement are good for.
But Green Library's splendor is lost at
midnight when students are thrown out and
asked to make the 100-foot trek to Meyer.
We understand that there are costs to all de
cisions, but the Editorial Board believes that
Stanford should seriously consider keeping
Green open 24 hours a day.
This year. Harvard University made
Lamott Library open 24 hours a day in
order to accommodate student demand for
a good, comfortable study space. While the
Stanford of the East is certainly different
than our University, we believe that Har
vard's administration has captured an im
portant aspect of academic life. Students are
most likely to be studying — and conse
quently need a good study space — after
midnight between Sunday and Thursday.
Meyer Library, Stanford's current solution
to this need, is wholly insufficient.
For one thing, Meyer's central room is
small and often runs out of seats after mid
night. During busy weeks of the quarter, the
24-hour study room is also completely occu
pied late at night. As roommates go to sleep,
students begin the 10-page IHUM papers
due the next day — and with Green closed,
Meyer gets overcrowded to the point where
it fails to meet students' needs.
Furthermore, while the iMac cluster on
the first floor provides significant computer
terminals and some tables, it is not conducive
to the needs of students simply looking fora
comfortable place to read. Meyer is not
known for being particularly inviting — after
all, its acronym back when it was known as
the Undergraduate Library was UgLy. Stu
dents are unhappy enough to be working at 3
a.m.; surely they should be able to do so at a
library that is less institutional-feeling.
As an elite university that prides itself
on its responsiveness to student needs,
Stanford has certainly fallen behind in its
provision of good library space during the
late-night hours. Stanford should under
take a full cost-benefit analysis to investi
gate the marginal expenses associated with

expanding Green's hours.
Even if it would not make sense to keep
the library open 24 hours, it seems that the
University could at least increase the num
ber of hours it was open. Many students
would be satisfied with keeping Green open
until 2 a.m. Sunday through Thursday nights.
This increase of only 10 hours per week does
not seem too burdensome.
At the same time, however, we need to
consider that because of limited funding,
Green can only be open fora certain num
ber of hours each day. If an increase in
hours will truly prove too difficult or expen
sive for the University, perhaps students
can suggest which hours they would prefer
Green be open. It may be that it works best
for the majority of students to have Green
open at 10 a.m. on weekdays and after noon
on weekends. This would free up more
hours at night. Admittedly, this solution
may negatively affect students who need to
gain access to library materials in the morn
ing. However, we believe that some sort of
compromise can be achieved.
We think the ideal situation would in
volve keeping only the Bing Wing open and
blocking off the stacks and other areas of
Green that are not as important to students
who are primarily seeking a comfortable
place to read and work. However, due to a
fire marshal mandate,space in Green cannot
be blocked off. We do not know how feasible
negotiations would be, but it seems that it
would be worthwhile to further discuss this
matter with the fire marshal, If there are
changes that could be made to the library
and its evacuation system in order to circum
vent this ban, we strongly urge the Universi
ty to look into this option.
The final question that Stanford should
consider, though, is: Would keeping Green
open benefit students more than the margin
al costs of adding hours? We suspect the an
swer to this question is "yes," but we urge
Stanford to pursue this issue expeditiously.
We understand that change at this Uni
versity can be slow, and we welcome the use
of pilot programs and trial periods to test
out potential modifications, but we also
urge Stanford to think seriously about the
ways in which its students grow intellectual
ly and how quality study space impacts this
development.
