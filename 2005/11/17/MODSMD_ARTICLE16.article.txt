# Adventures in Deutschland
## Beer rocks, Cal sucks 
### 
On TUesday, I did something I never in
my wildest dreams though I would
ever do. I bought a bottle of Beck's
Alkoholfrei.
Before coming to Berlin, non-alcoholic
beer was a product that defied explanation,
seeming to lack purpose or market like sugar
free candy or Sophomore College. But as I
stood in a Turkish deli buying French fries 10
minutes before class, I realized no other bev
erage would suffice. I didn't have an opaque
container in which to sneak a real beer into
class. Besides, I already crack jokes and fall
asleep during the slideshows without the aid
of alcohol. Soda seemed too sweet, water too
bland. I almost bought apple juice, but that's
all I drink with my homestay family.
Beyond choosing Alkoholfrei through
this process of elimination, however, the
thought of sipping a beer with my food just
seemed really appealing. Three months ago,
I regarded beer as a nice way to get drunk,
but would have preferred a Coke or lemon
ade on a hot day. No longer. At the Mensa
(student cafeteria) at a nearby university
last week, I actually threw away half of my
bottle of Sprite because it was too sugary.
In other news, the Junior Class Cabinet
sent the Stanford-in-Berlin center a care
package this week. It was a very sweet ges
ture and the contents — a package of
gummi bears, a box of reduced-fat Cheez-Its.
a mix CD and a National Enquirer — were
much appreciated. Still, I cannot help imag
ining other items I might have preferred.
Here, then, are some suggestions for future
care packages:
1. A double-double with cheese. Chris,
Kelsey, Jo and I have resorted to eating at an

American diner called "The Sixties." The
bacon cheeseburgers cost eight euros and
while the burgers are pretty good, they're no
match for In-N-Out. I've started calling it
"The Embassy," though I don't think I can
expect sanctuary if I beat a German hobo to
death or something of the like.
2. Booze. No, I'm just kidding. We can get
plenty of that here.
3. Back issues of The Daily instead of
tabloids. The Daily is still fake news, but it
doesn't realize it, making it even funnier.
Why, for example, was the lead story on Nov.
4 a piece about a new luxury retirement
home opening in Palo Alto? I know Mikey
Lee reads the paper, but I can't think of any
other reason why that was newsworthy.
4.The Axe. Seriously, bring that shit home.
Oh, and apparently the Stanford-Cal ri
valry has now made its way to Europe. My
friend Cynthia went to the hotel in Florence
where Leland Stanford, Jr. died. She expect
ed to find a plaque making note of the signif
icance of the site and instead found a spot
where a plaque had clearly been fastened be
fore being forcibly detached from the wall.
Stealing the Tree's costume is one thing. Des
ecrating the memory of a dead teenage boy is
another. All signs point to those classless
sons-of-bitches from across the Bay.
Hope you enjoyed this potpourri/cop-out
column. I'll be back in top form after
Thanksgiving break.

David Herbert would like to assure the Over
seas Studies Program that he has had a very
cultural experience this quarter and that there
is a lot of "study" in "study abroad." E-mail
him at dherbert@stanford.edu.
