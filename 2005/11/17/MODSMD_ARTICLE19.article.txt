# Reflections from afar
## 
### 
Last Wednesday was my birthday. A mix
of emotions and thoughts that swirled
in my mind as I took a back step from
reality. Hesitantly, 1 ask you to follow my trail
through the hazy undulation of my thoughts.
The ensuing sentiments are the products of a
deep, personal meditation on life.
When I reflect on my life, my first reaction
is petty amazement at the speedy succession
of time. What is so interesting (or surprising)
is that I do not get a sense of unity or a com
pletion from my life, but rather 1 feel a break
from the traditional categories with which we
measure lives — that is, the state of one's ed
ucation, one's past accomplishments, one's
grades and a host of other rather tedious cri
teria. I do not think these categories measure
my life at all, nor do they have any say in who
I am. I would like to measure the worth of my
life according to how authentically 1 lived.
Twentieth-century existentialists defined
authenticity as the taking of ultimate respon
sibility for one's situation and constructing
an exclusively personal meaning for one's ex
istence. That is to say, I may choose to study
and do well in my classes, substantiating my
act with the thought, "This is what one does
or has to do." Or, I may choose to act moral
ly because I believe that it is rational and du
tiful to be moral; it is what one "has to do."
The authenticity defined by existential
ists rejects these familiar notions. If I
choose to act authentically, the reason is
that / want to act that way and / bear the re
sponsibility. ITie burden of responsibility
should not be shifted to some abstract
moral principle or societal expectations of
"what one does." I should not be a function
of the roles I find myself in; my roles should
be a function of who I am.
At first, this idea of authenticity gives the
impression that since all my values are
grounded in me (and not in anything external
to me, such as religion or society or abstract
moral principles) that I can choose values ar
bitrarily. As Sartre wrote, "I make my deci

sions concerning [values] — without justifi
cation and without excuse."
Sartre's own philosophy existed in curious
tension between objective moral standards
and his notion of authenticity and freedom.
For my part, I believe that if I accord a primary
value to authenticity in my acts, 1 must also ac
cord the same value to others' authenticity (or
the potential thereof). This should set some
limits to values I choose and should curb my
morality I should never act to harm or limit
others' right to authenticity. (For instance, in
my opinion, this entails viewing others always
as ends and not exclusively as means).
Authenticity is not really a set of choices
one must decide among, but rather the
mode of choosing or the style with which
one engages one's life. And I must admit
that so far I have not lived a very authentic
life. I remember in an IHUM discussion, we
were analyzing Kant's essay "What is en
lightenment?" in which he decreed enlight
enment is to think for one's self. I admitted
that I had not really given much thought,for
example, to why I had studied and stressed
myself out in high school to get into a really
good university. I had thought this was sim
ply what one "has to do." Other students
spoke in a similar vein and it was very clear
that our choice to attend Stanford was not
very authentic.
Do not get me wrong. If time could be re
wound and I were confronted with the same
choices, I would make the same decisions.
What would differ would be my particular
engagement with those choices. I would be

more aware of the limitations of any institu
tional education. I would always value my
self as my only educator. I would be skepti
cal of any goal in life. And, more important
ly, 1 would stand before the bottomless well
of upcoming years and, with a flavor of
irony, stare smilingly into it — like a child
who is easily amused by things he under
stands. (Some of these judgments come with
experience, so perhaps 1 should not assign
myself guilt).
I cannot do myself justice without ascrib
ing myself some authenticity. I won't say
much. One time, my spirit was dashed and I
found myself grappling with the encircling
gloom. I rode to the Stanford Bookstore,
picked up a book (I think it was Allen Wood's
"Kant") and started reading, completely ab
sorbed and oblivious to the worries that feed
on one's flesh.There was no reason for me to
be there, and the activity wasn't much more
than my wasting time in an already busy life.
When finally forced to leave by the Book
store's closing, 1 felt inner bliss. That, my
friends, was authentic.
Perhaps birthdays should not only launch
us into deep meditation about the past but
also entangle us deeply in a fundamental
human reality — our mortality. "The eternal
ly alight candle of existence should dicker for
a moment, and at that fleeting instant I shall
return to that darkness from whence 1 came,"
I thought to myself as I pondered not only my
birthday but also my death day.
Then I pulled myself back from my mus
ings, returned from Kimball's balcony to
my room and mingled with life again as I
waited for my "surprise" birthday celebra
tion to begin.

Do you want to replace "eternally alight candle
of existence " with a 20-watt light bulk? Do you

wound and I were confronted with the same
choices, I would make the same decisions.
What would differ would be my particular
engagement with those choices. I would be

more aware of the limitations of any institu
tional education. I would always value my
self as my only educator. I would be skepti
cal of any goal in life. And, more important
ly, 1 would stand before the bottomless well
of upcoming years and, with a flavor of
irony, stare smilingly into it — like a child
who is easily amused by things he under
stands. (Some of these judgments come with
experience, so perhaps 1 should not assign
myself guilt).
I cannot do myself justice without ascrib
ing myself some authenticity. I won't say
much. One time, my spirit was dashed and I
found myself grappling with the encircling
gloom. I rode to the Stanford Bookstore,
picked up a book (I think it was Allen Wood's
"Kant") and started reading, completely ab
sorbed and oblivious to the worries that feed
on one's flesh.There was no reason for me to
be there, and the activity wasn't much more
than my wasting time in an already busy life.
When finally forced to leave by the Book
store's closing, 1 felt inner bliss. That, my
friends, was authentic.
Perhaps birthdays should not only launch
us into deep meditation about the past but
also entangle us deeply in a fundamental
human reality — our mortality. "The eternal
ly alight candle of existence should dicker for
a moment, and at that fleeting instant I shall
return to that darkness from whence 1 came,"
I thought to myself as I pondered not only my
birthday but also my death day.
Then I pulled myself back from my mus
ings, returned from Kimball's balcony to
my room and mingled with life again as I
waited for my "surprise" birthday celebra
tion to begin.

Last Wednesday was my birthday. A mix
of emotions and thoughts that swirled
in my mind as I took a back step from
reality. Hesitantly, 1 ask you to follow my trail
through the hazy undulation of my thoughts.
The ensuing sentiments are the products of a
deep, personal meditation on life.
When I reflect on my life, my first reaction
is petty amazement at the speedy succession
of time. What is so interesting (or surprising)
is that I do not get a sense of unity or a com
pletion from my life, but rather 1 feel a break
from the traditional categories with which we
measure lives — that is, the state of one's ed
ucation, one's past accomplishments, one's
grades and a host of other rather tedious cri
teria. I do not think these categories measure
my life at all, nor do they have any say in who
I am. I would like to measure the worth of my
life according to how authentically 1 lived.
Twentieth-century existentialists defined
authenticity as the taking of ultimate respon
sibility for one's situation and constructing
an exclusively personal meaning for one's ex
istence. That is to say, I may choose to study
and do well in my classes, substantiating my
act with the thought, "This is what one does
or has to do." Or, I may choose to act moral
ly because I believe that it is rational and du
tiful to be moral; it is what one "has to do."
The authenticity defined by existential
ists rejects these familiar notions. If I
choose to act authentically, the reason is
that / want to act that way and / bear the re
sponsibility. ITie burden of responsibility
should not be shifted to some abstract
moral principle or societal expectations of
"what one does." I should not be a function
of the roles I find myself in; my roles should
be a function of who I am.
At first, this idea of authenticity gives the
impression that since all my values are
grounded in me (and not in anything external
to me, such as religion or society or abstract
moral principles) that I can choose values ar
bitrarily. As Sartre wrote, "I make my deci

sions concerning [values] — without justifi
cation and without excuse."
Sartre's own philosophy existed in curious
tension between objective moral standards
and his notion of authenticity and freedom.
For my part, I believe that if I accord a primary
value to authenticity in my acts, 1 must also ac
cord the same value to others' authenticity (or
the potential thereof). This should set some
limits to values I choose and should curb my
morality I should never act to harm or limit
others' right to authenticity. (For instance, in
my opinion, this entails viewing others always
as ends and not exclusively as means).
Authenticity is not really a set of choices
one must decide among, but rather the
mode of choosing or the style with which
one engages one's life. And I must admit
that so far I have not lived a very authentic
life. I remember in an IHUM discussion, we
were analyzing Kant's essay "What is en
lightenment?" in which he decreed enlight
enment is to think for one's self. I admitted
that I had not really given much thought,for
example, to why I had studied and stressed
myself out in high school to get into a really
good university. I had thought this was sim
ply what one "has to do." Other students
spoke in a similar vein and it was very clear
that our choice to attend Stanford was not
very authentic.
Do not get me wrong. If time could be re
wound and I were confronted with the same
choices, I would make the same decisions.
What would differ would be my particular
