Non-exclusive marrow-typing drive
would be prohibitively expensive
In a letter toThe Daily yesterday ("Lamb
das should open marrow-typing drives to
all," Nov. 16), the author asserted that Lamb
da Phi Epsilon should not exclude non-mi
norities who want to submit their blood in the
fraternity's bone marrow-typing drives.
While on the surface this is a reasonable re
quest, the issue is more complicated than
would first appear.
Those doing the typing may not have suf
ficient resources to type anyone and every
one who shows up, despite their altruistic in
tentions. Thus, typing the blood of a non-mi
nority during such a drive could mean that an
underrepresented minority will consequent
ly not be typed and added to the bone mar
row donor registry.
It would be senseless for the organization

to advertise the endeavor as a minority hone
marrow-typing drive and then not he able to
follow through on its stated intent because its
limited resources have been diverted toward
typing people in a cohort that is already well
represented .The letter's author seems to ac
knowledge this in suggesting that the Lamb
da fraternity pursue other funding to avoid
having to exclude anyone.
Rather than criticizing a campaign that
raises awareness and takes tangible steps to
ward addressing an important issue.it would
be more productive to encourage other gen
eral bone marrow-typing organizations to re
cruit more minority donors so that such a dis
parity in representation would cease to exist.
Perhaps then, a drive targeting minorities
would no longer be necessary.

Requests for behavior at Big Game
As a long time fan of Stanford student
athletes and a football season ticket holder
whose seats are in the DD section directly ad
jacent to the student section, I very much
hope that the student attendance and partic
ipation at this Saturday's Big Game is not im
pacted by the beginning of the weeklong
Thanksgiving break.
I also would very much welcome the yell
leaders taking the lead from their brethren
across the Bay and not sounding like Ivy
League rejects. The players who devote 25 to
30 hours a week to football, in addition to
their academic demands, certainly deserve
better than has been forthcoming from the
student attendance and the sophomoric yell
leaders.
