# PERFORMANCE
## Troupe dances for peace Group travels from West Bank to celebrate Palestinian culture 
### KAITLIN WOOD 
Through traditional dance, song and
theatrical choreography, the 20 girls and
boys of the Ibdaa Dance Troupe por
trayed Palestinian refugees' heritage and
dreams to an audience of Stanford stu
dents and community members last night
in Kresge Auditorium.
The young dancers, ranging from 10-
to 13-years-old, arrived in the United
States from Dheisheh, a refugee camp lo
cated in the occupied West Bank. Sur
rounded by violence, poverty and filth on
an average basis, these children — along
with 1,500 other women, children and
youth — receive guidance from the
Ibdaa Cultural Center, which provides
them with the tools to explore and ex
press their culture while educating the
world about the Palestinian refugee
struggle.
"We are not looking for charity," said
Ziad Abbas, co-founder and co-director
of the Ibdaa Cultural Center. "We are
looking for solidarity."
The word "Ibdaa" is Arabic for "to
create something out of nothing," and
that is exactly what the dancers did. The
performance reflected a passion for
Palestinian customs, all while reminding
spectators of the greater Palestinian
struggles and conflicts.
"We are coming here to learn and to
teach," said one dancer in a speech trans

lated by Abbas. "We are a people who
love life."
The Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (CJME), which seeks to create
awareness of current events and human
rights violations in the region, along with
the Middle Eastern Children's Alliance
were paramount in helping to bring the
Ibdaa Dance Troupe to Stanford, said
Olivia Sohns, a junior and co-president of
CJME.
"This performance sends a message of
the Palestinian hope for peace, and specif
ically a dream of a brighter future for the
younger generation of Palestinians,"
Sohns said. "The dancers hope to inspire
the audience to find out more about the
conflict, as a comprehensive understand
ing of its history is vital for us to better
help those in the region work towards a
peaceful and just coexistence in the land."
The troupe performed three dances,
each of which lasted for 20 to 30 minutes.
The first centered on the Palestinian be
lief that the land is a source of dignity and
freedom. Successive dances touched
upon the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the
plight of political prisoners and Palestin
ian social traditions, ending with the
Palestinian national anthem.
"The homeland is inside us," Abbas
said. "It is inside our heart."
This is the first time outside of the
West Bank for many of the dancers. For
several weeks, the Ibdaa Dance Troupe
will be traveling across the nation on a
21 -city tour, making several stops
throughout Northern California, to de
liver performances.

"In general, Ibdaa is hailed for its
moving and deeply inspirational per
formances," Sohns said. "In the national
tour organized by Coalition for Justice
and the Middle Eastern Children's Al
liance, they are performing at nine
other U.S. universities besides Stanford
in an effort to spread awareness in
many communities of the hopes of the
Palestinian people."
The performance was met by a warm
reception. Audience members clapped
alone and sang to the tunes of the various

songs. When the recital came to an end,
dancers and spectators shook hands and
mingled over traditional Palestinian
desserts.
"This is a unique event in that these
youths are coming directly from the West
Bank to Stanford," Sohns said. "We hope
their performance will help promote
awareness on campus about the plight of
refugees worldwide."
Additional performances will be held
in San Francisco on Wednesday, Nov. 23
and in Berkeley on Saturday, Nov. 26.

love life."
The Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East (CJME), which seeks to create
awareness of current events and human
rights violations in the region, along with
the Middle Eastern Children's Alliance
were paramount in helping to bring the
Ibdaa Dance Troupe to Stanford, said
Olivia Sohns, a junior and co-president of
CJME.
"This performance sends a message of
the Palestinian hope for peace, and specif
ically a dream of a brighter future for the
younger generation of Palestinians,"
Sohns said. "The dancers hope to inspire
the audience to find out more about the
conflict, as a comprehensive understand
ing of its history is vital for us to better
help those in the region work towards a
peaceful and just coexistence in the land."
The troupe performed three dances,
each of which lasted for 20 to 30 minutes.
The first centered on the Palestinian be
lief that the land is a source of dignity and
freedom. Successive dances touched
upon the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the
plight of political prisoners and Palestin
ian social traditions, ending with the
Palestinian national anthem.
"The homeland is inside us," Abbas
said. "It is inside our heart."
This is the first time outside of the
West Bank for many of the dancers. For
several weeks, the Ibdaa Dance Troupe
will be traveling across the nation on a
21 -city tour, making several stops
throughout Northern California, to de
liver performances.

"In general, Ibdaa is hailed for its
moving and deeply inspirational per
formances," Sohns said. "In the national
tour organized by Coalition for Justice
and the Middle Eastern Children's Al
liance, they are performing at nine
other U.S. universities besides Stanford
in an effort to spread awareness in
many communities of the hopes of the
Palestinian people."
The performance was met by a warm
reception. Audience members clapped
alone and sang to the tunes of the various

songs. When the recital came to an end,
dancers and spectators shook hands and
mingled over traditional Palestinian
desserts.
"This is a unique event in that these
youths are coming directly from the West
Bank to Stanford," Sohns said. "We hope
their performance will help promote
awareness on campus about the plight of
refugees worldwide."
Additional performances will be held
in San Francisco on Wednesday, Nov. 23
and in Berkeley on Saturday, Nov. 26.
