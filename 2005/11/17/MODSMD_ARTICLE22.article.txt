## Math latest weapon in war on terror 
### KATHERINE HARVEY 
Lattice theory — a branch of abstract mathe
matics that studies order and hierarchy — could
be used to break up terrorist cells and give law
enforcement and intelligence agencies more ac
curate assessments of U.S. vulnerability to future
terrorist attacks, according to Prof. Jonathon Far
ley, a Center for International Security and Co
operation (CISAC) science fellow at Stanford.
A crowd of approximately 20 gathered Tues
day afternoon to hear what the science fellow,
Summa Cum Laude Harvard graduate and Ful
bright distinguished scholar recipient had to say
about countering terrorism in a talk entitled
"Beauty and Terror: Does Mathematics Have a
Role to Play in Winning the Shadow War?"
Farley began his talk with a short clip from the
movie "A Beautiful Mind", the Oscar-winning
film that portrayed the life of mathematician
John Nash. Nash's work in game theory, which
was later applied to military strategy during the
Cold War, was Farley's inspiration, he said.
"That is where it all started," he said, refer
encing the film's opening line: "Mathematicians
won the war." Farley said he wondered whether
lattice theory — his mathematical field of ex
pertise — could similarly be applied to help fight
the war on terrorism.
Intrigued, Farley set out to create a program
based on lattice theoretical models that would
calculate the probability that a terrorist cell has
been disrupted. In Farley's program, terrorists
are represented as dots on a graph. The program
sifts through current intelligence data on indi
vidual terrorists and terrorist activity, searching
for patterns between individuals, locations and
events that would link one terrorist to another. If
enough patterns are discerned, the program
would literally "connect the dots," and establish
members of a terrorist cell.
While databases drawing on similar mathe
matical concepts and calculations are used by in
telligence agencies today, Farley said these exist
ing databases "ignore the fact that terrorist cells
have hierarchy," something that his lattice model
takes into account.
