## Math latest weapon in war on terror 
### KATHERINE HARVEY 
Lattice theory — a branch of abstract mathe
matics that studies order and hierarchy — could
be used to break up terrorist cells and give law
enforcement and intelligence agencies more ac
curate assessments of U.S. vulnerability to future
terrorist attacks, according to Prof. Jonathon Far
ley, a Center for International Security and Co
operation (CISAC) science fellow at Stanford.
A crowd of approximately 20 gathered Tues
day afternoon to hear what the science fellow,
Summa Cum Laude Harvard graduate and Ful
bright distinguished scholar recipient had to say
about countering terrorism in a talk entitled
"Beauty and Terror: Does Mathematics Have a
Role to Play in Winning the Shadow War?"
Farley began his talk with a short clip from the
movie "A Beautiful Mind", the Oscar-winning
film that portrayed the life of mathematician
John Nash. Nash's work in game theory, which
was later applied to military strategy during the
Cold War, was Farley's inspiration, he said.
"That is where it all started," he said, refer
encing the film's opening line: "Mathematicians
won the war." Farley said he wondered whether
lattice theory — his mathematical field of ex
pertise — could similarly be applied to help fight
the war on terrorism.
Intrigued, Farley set out to create a program
based on lattice theoretical models that would
calculate the probability that a terrorist cell has
been disrupted. In Farley's program, terrorists
are represented as dots on a graph. The program
sifts through current intelligence data on indi
vidual terrorists and terrorist activity, searching
for patterns between individuals, locations and
events that would link one terrorist to another. If
enough patterns are discerned, the program
would literally "connect the dots," and establish
members of a terrorist cell.
While databases drawing on similar mathe
matical concepts and calculations are used by in
telligence agencies today, Farley said these exist
ing databases "ignore the fact that terrorist cells
have hierarchy," something that his lattice model
takes into account.
"Ideally, we want to capture
everyone in the terrorist cell," Farley
said. "But that's not realistic. But
let's say we capture four of the 15
terrorists in the cell. We want to
know the probability that the cell has
been disabled."
Existing databases, Farley ex
plained, would interpret these re
sults without taking into account the
captured terrorists' rank in the hier
archy. If all four of the captured ter
rorists were in the lowest rank of the
hierarchy, the terrorist cell would not
necessarily have been broken, but
the old model might lead intelli

gence officials to believe it had.
With the old model, Farley said,
"We would feel safer than we would
have a right to."
Farley's model, on the other
hand, would take hierarchy into ac
count, calculating the probability
that a terrorist cell had been disabled
based on the number of terrorists
captured in a given cell and their hi
erarchal ranking in the cell. Farley
said the model would also help intel
ligence officers identify the most ef
ficient way to disable a cell by identi
fying which terrorists had to be re
moved from the cell in order to
break the chain of command.
Many attendees asked questions
about the model, which Farley field
ed after his presentation. US Army
Col. Bill Hix, a national security af
fairs fellow at Hoover Institution,

asked Farley about the model's abil
ity to adapt to the new global terror
ist threat.
Hix pointed out that terrorist net
works and communications systems
have become quite complex, adding,
"It is not something imminently ap
parent on how you can approach it."
"The model just deals with actual
cells or groups," Farley responded,
"not some kind of spiritual realm."
He said he didn't know the precise
structure of terrorist cells, adding
"the model has to be applied by peo
ple whose expertise is in that field."
For Farley, the program repre
sented a jumping-off point, a basic
model that could be later refined.
"I have presented a stripped
down version of the program, and it
is important to ask where we can go
from here," he said.
