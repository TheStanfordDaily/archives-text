### TERESA MOLINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's hard to forget — even fora second —
that Big Game is just around the corner:
whether it's the sea of students clad in red or
the countdown at White Plaza, constant re
minders are all over campus.
Amidst all this hype, it's easy to dismiss
the other intercollegiate competitions that
are coming up this weekend,such as the bad

minton team's first dual meet against San
Jose State. But with the hustling restlessness
and anticipation, there is definitely enough
school spirit to go around for all Stanford
competitions — varsity and club sports
alike.
The dual meets that the badminton team
competes in are organized by the Northern
California Intercollegiate Badminton
League. Stanford faces league members Cal
ifornia, UC-Davis, San Jose State, Sacra
mento State and Ohlone College in head-to
head tournaments from November to May.
The end of the Stanford squad's season
comes with the collegiate national champi

onships in the spring. ITiis year, the club
hopes to send a group of about 10 players to
compete in the national tournament, which
will be held at Yale.
Depending on the number ot players
each team is able to bring to the competi
tion, this weekends dual meet will likely
consist of a total of 13 matches. The three
singles and two doubles matches for men
and women, as well as the three mixed dou
bles matches, are each worth an equal num
ber of points.
As a club sport, the badminton team is
open to all skill levels and currently consists
of more than 40 players, the majority partic-

ipating as
recreational
athletes. The

club is not only diverse in terms of skill-level
but also in terms of nationality and age. Ac
tive club participants include undergraduate
and graduate students, as well as faculty and
staff members.
Everyone on the club has the opportuni
ty to work with Stanford's official coach Bill
Pickthorn, who takes charge of organizing
two of the three weekly practices. One of
these sessions is devoted to badminton shots
