## SPORTS Squad to play 13 matches against San Jose State 
### TERESA MOLINA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's hard to forget — even fora second —
that Big Game is just around the corner:
whether it's the sea of students clad in red or
the countdown at White Plaza, constant re
minders are all over campus.
Amidst all this hype, it's easy to dismiss
the other intercollegiate competitions that
are coming up this weekend,such as the bad

minton team's first dual meet against San
Jose State. But with the hustling restlessness
and anticipation, there is definitely enough
school spirit to go around for all Stanford
competitions — varsity and club sports
alike.
The dual meets that the badminton team
competes in are organized by the Northern
California Intercollegiate Badminton
League. Stanford faces league members Cal
ifornia, UC-Davis, San Jose State, Sacra
mento State and Ohlone College in head-to
head tournaments from November to May.
The end of the Stanford squad's season
comes with the collegiate national champi

onships in the spring. ITiis year, the club
hopes to send a group of about 10 players to
compete in the national tournament, which
will be held at Yale.
Depending on the number ot players
each team is able to bring to the competi
tion, this weekends dual meet will likely
consist of a total of 13 matches. The three
singles and two doubles matches for men
and women, as well as the three mixed dou
bles matches, are each worth an equal num
ber of points.
As a club sport, the badminton team is
open to all skill levels and currently consists
of more than 40 players, the majority partic-

ipating as
recreational
athletes. The

club is not only diverse in terms of skill-level
but also in terms of nationality and age. Ac
tive club participants include undergraduate
and graduate students, as well as faculty and
staff members.
Everyone on the club has the opportuni
ty to work with Stanford's official coach Bill
Pickthorn, who takes charge of organizing
two of the three weekly practices. One of
these sessions is devoted to badminton shots
and techniques while the other
places greater emphasis on foot
work. The third practice, without
Pickthorn, is less structured, allow
ing club members to play casual
matches against one another.
In addition to benefiting from of
ficial coaching sessions and regular
practice times, members of the bad
minton squad also get the chance to
socialize with their fellow athletes.
"I like to think that the friend
ships developed during badminton
go beyond practices," sophomore
captain Joseph Liu said. "A lot of the
members become close friends and,
in my case, even live together in
dorms."
At Stanford, there is a fair
amount of interest in the sport,
though numbers tend to dwindle as
individual schedules fill up over the

course of the quarter. Nevertheless,
the limited number of spots on the
traveling squad means that there is
still a need fora certain level of se
lectiveness when it comes to decid
ing who can participate on the com
petitive team.
"As captain, 1 usually pick the
members who are the most commit
ted to represent Stanford in these
matches," Liu said. "There is gener
ally a core group of players who are
the most dedicated."
The recent years have been build
ing years for the badminton squad,
but there are high hopes for success
this season.Though the club lost sev
eral graduate students and seniors to
graduation last year, the current
squad looks promising with a lot of
young talent.
As the weekend approaches,
there is a lot of activity for fans on
the Farm to look forward to. As it
gears up fora strong start to its sea
son, the badminton team hopes to
add another reason to celebrate the
Stanford spirit.
