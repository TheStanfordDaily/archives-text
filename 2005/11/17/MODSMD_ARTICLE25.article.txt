## Rivalry week hits Pac-10 Big Game, Civil War, Apple Cup raise stakes for conference teams 
### ANNE M. PETERSON AP SPORTS WRITER 
(AP) — It's rivalry week in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence. Mostly.
There's the Apple Cup between Washington and
Washington State, the Civil War between Oregon and
Oregon State and the Big Game between Stanford
and California.
The rivalries that don't have established nick
names are at least a few days away. Arizona and Ari
zona State play the day after Thanksgiving, while the
anticipated showdown between top-ranked Southern
California and UCLA doesn't happen until Dec. 3.
The Big Game is the oldest rivalry, having started
in 1892, but the Civil War has been played 108 times,
once more than Stanford-Cal.The Apple Cup started
in 19(H) and has been played 97 times.
Probably the most intriguing of this weekend's
conference rivalries will be the Big Game at Stanford
Stadium. Cal, which was ranked to start the season, is
now in a three-way tie for fifth place in the league at
6-4 and 3-4 in conference.
While the Golden Bears already have enough
overall wins for bowl eligibility, the Cardinal — at 5-4
overall — still need one more win. However, in the
Pac-10, Stanford is 4-3, placing them ahead of Cal.
The Golden Bears have a three-game winning
streak against their cross-bay rivals.
Cal coach Jeff Tedford added some drama to the
game this week by waiting to decide whether Joe
Ayoob would start at quarterback for the game. Steve
Levy is Ayoob's backup. Ayoob has struggled as Cal
has lost four of its last five.
At Stanford, coach Walt Harris hadn't yet been
able to evaluate starter TYent Edwards, who injured
his thumb in last weekend's 20-17 victory over Ore
gon State and didn't finish the game.
In the Civil War at Autzen Stadium, quarterbacks
are also the focus.
