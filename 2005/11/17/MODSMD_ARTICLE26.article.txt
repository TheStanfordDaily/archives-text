# Who wins the Biggest Game yet?
## 
### 
It's the moment you have all been
waiting for: the definitive, be all
end all Big Game between Cal
and Stanford. And it has nothing to
do with football.
Yes,you heard me.This columnist
will narrate the wackiest Big Game
without referencing a single player
on the rosters of Stanford or Cal. In
stead, I base the game off of the ran
dom attributes of both schools. Ran
dom but definitive.
Cal players begin the game by
bragging to Stanford players about
the abundant assortment of cheap
and greasy off-campus, hole-in-the
wall food joints. They describe won
drous places such as Zachary's, Top
Dawg, Fat Slice, Fenton's, the Asian
Ghetto and more: a murderer's row
(literally, the food in some joints can
probably kill you) of eateries. Pro
pelled by the greasy food, Cal rushes
off to a quick touchdown. 7-0 Cal.
Then they tell stories of Cal's sur
roundings — which give you that
feeling that Frank the Tank could be
streaking down any street. You also
feel you could get shot as you turn
any street corner, but that's another
story.
Stanford players realize that Uni
versity Avenue is a dream...for rich
yuppies who wish they were college
students. Plus, Berkeley doesn't just
shut down after bedtime. Demoral
ized by the Bear's superior off-cam
pus accommodations, the Stanford
defense allows another touchdown,
making it 14-0 Cal. Wait, 1 thought
Buddy Teevens left Stanford...
Fortunately, the numerous hip
pies and bums inhabiting Berkeley
slow the Cal team down, and we've
reached a new quarter of play.
Then Stanford players remember
how much better their on-campus
food is.
Never having dared to try Cal's
reportedly God-awful dorm food
and taking into account the amazing
special dinner I had this past week. I
think Stanford has better on-cam
pus food. Propelled by a hearty-
Wilbur brunch. Cardinal football
cuts the deficit in half, 14-7, with a
touchdown.
Then Stanford brings out Admis


Raghav
Thapar
Rants and Raves
sions Director Richard Shaw whose
mere presence reminds Cal players
and fans that they were rejected by
Stanford. This causes great anguish
on the Cal side and the defense
yields a field goal. 14-10 Cal.
Of course, no Cal-Stanford com
parison is complete without compar
ing the Campanile to Hoover. Theirs
is taller, but ours is wider. Who real
ly cares though?
Throughout their years, Cal play
ers have been told that Stanford
looks like aTaco Bell — a really nice
Taco Bell. Mystified by Stanford's
actual beauty, the Bears' defense
gives up another touchdown and
Stanford rolls into halftime with a
17-14 lead.
Heading into the second half, Cal
fans bring the crazy. They absolutely
hate us. You can wear a Go Cal shirt
here; you probably shouldn't wear
anything resembling red at Cal.
Stanford has some crazy sports fans
(see Sixth Man Club), but even if we
win Big Game, I can't see Stanford
fans tearing down the goalpost, run
ning it down University and per
forming in some animalistic ritual
like Cal fans did three years ago.
Fearing slaughter from their fans,
the Cal offense runs down the field
fora 21-17 lead.
They probably deserve another
field goal because I expect some Cal
kid to assassinate me once he reads
this full column. 24-17, Cal.
However, that craziness also
makes them a little too intense for
me. I can imagine their Big Game
festivities being Manchurian Candi
datesque indoctrination sections. I
bet every Cal student will curl up his
fist in a ball of rage for the rest of his
life at the mere mention of Stanford.
Fortunately, Stanford busts out Prof.
Zimbardo, and he hypnotizes them,
counteracting their rage fora few
minutes. The Cal section goes quiet,
and the mystified Cal defense yields
another field goal, 24-20.
The clock keeps ticking. Tiger
shows up with Elin and motivates
the Cardinal to march down the field
and kick a field goal. 24-23, Cal.
Then William Hung shows up and
everyone ever associated with Cal
gets a shiver of embarrassment as he
belts out his famous rendition of
"She Bangs." No William, she does

n't. At least not with you. Stanford
utilizes this moment of pure artistic
horror fora safety. 25-24, going into
the fourth quarter.
To start off the quarter, Jeff Ted
ford shows his team a clip of "The
Play," and on another extremely
odd, special teams play involving the
Stanford Band, the Bears reach the
endzone. But like its 1982 counter
part, this play should have been nul
lified thrice. The ball doesn't lie. Cal
misses the extra point. Cal 30-25.
To inspire his program, Ted Le
land brings out the shining Lexus
Gauntlet Cup. Stanford players don't
care, but its glimmer blinds Cal's
quarterback and Stanford gets anoth
er safety. 30-27 in favor of the Bears.
Stanford remembers it is "Quar
terback U" and thus brings in the re
tired John Elway to lead a march for
a game-tying field goal.
But Cal uses the Axe to cut
through the Stanford defense. 37-30
Cat
Cal is about to ice the game when
former Stanford provost turned Sec
retary of State Condoleezza Rice
uses her connections with the CIA to
kidnapTedford and replace him with
Tom Holmoe. Holmoe does what he
does best and lets the Cardinal score
an easy game-tying touchdown.
The Big Game goes to overtime,
and Stanford is on offense first.
The Tree busts out a crazy dance
and reminds Stanford players why
the University is so unique, for the
tree has been banned from most
major stadiums and probably from
every place not located on the imme
diate campus. Still, the Tree was in an
ESPN Sports Center ad and was in
terviewed by Playboy. Inspired by her
wackiness, the Cardinal score a
touchdown.
Cal fans look to their sideline and
see Oskii the Bear trying to get with
one of the Cal cheerleaders (I've
seen this in person, and it's not pret
ty). They realize that Oskii wouldn't
scare a little kid with his foolish side
line antics. He probably has a much
different relationship with Playboy
than the Tree. Demoralized by their
mascot, Cal turns the ball over to end
the game.
Stanford wins 44-37 just like they
will (by a different score) in the real
Big Game.

Raghav Thapar is a senior. If you too
hate Oskii the Bear and are praying
night and day fora long deserved Big
Game win, e-mail him at

datesque indoctrination sections. I
bet every Cal student will curl up his
fist in a ball of rage for the rest of his
life at the mere mention of Stanford.
Fortunately, Stanford busts out Prof.
Zimbardo, and he hypnotizes them,
counteracting their rage fora few
minutes. The Cal section goes quiet,
and the mystified Cal defense yields
another field goal, 24-20.
The clock keeps ticking. Tiger
shows up with Elin and motivates
the Cardinal to march down the field
and kick a field goal. 24-23, Cal.
Then William Hung shows up and
everyone ever associated with Cal
gets a shiver of embarrassment as he
belts out his famous rendition of
"She Bangs." No William, she does

n't. At least not with you. Stanford
utilizes this moment of pure artistic
horror fora safety. 25-24, going into
the fourth quarter.
To start off the quarter, Jeff Ted
ford shows his team a clip of "The
Play," and on another extremely
odd, special teams play involving the
Stanford Band, the Bears reach the
endzone. But like its 1982 counter
part, this play should have been nul
lified thrice. The ball doesn't lie. Cal
misses the extra point. Cal 30-25.
To inspire his program, Ted Le
land brings out the shining Lexus
Gauntlet Cup. Stanford players don't
care, but its glimmer blinds Cal's
quarterback and Stanford gets anoth
er safety. 30-27 in favor of the Bears.
Stanford remembers it is "Quar
terback U" and thus brings in the re
tired John Elway to lead a march for
a game-tying field goal.
But Cal uses the Axe to cut
through the Stanford defense. 37-30
Cat
Cal is about to ice the game when
former Stanford provost turned Sec
retary of State Condoleezza Rice
uses her connections with the CIA to
kidnapTedford and replace him with
Tom Holmoe. Holmoe does what he
does best and lets the Cardinal score
an easy game-tying touchdown.
The Big Game goes to overtime,
and Stanford is on offense first.
The Tree busts out a crazy dance
and reminds Stanford players why
the University is so unique, for the
tree has been banned from most
major stadiums and probably from
every place not located on the imme
diate campus. Still, the Tree was in an
ESPN Sports Center ad and was in
terviewed by Playboy. Inspired by her
wackiness, the Cardinal score a
touchdown.
Cal fans look to their sideline and
see Oskii the Bear trying to get with
one of the Cal cheerleaders (I've
seen this in person, and it's not pret
ty). They realize that Oskii wouldn't
scare a little kid with his foolish side
line antics. He probably has a much
different relationship with Playboy
than the Tree. Demoralized by their
mascot, Cal turns the ball over to end
the game.
Stanford wins 44-37 just like they
will (by a different score) in the real
Big Game.

It's the moment you have all been
waiting for: the definitive, be all
end all Big Game between Cal
and Stanford. And it has nothing to
do with football.
Yes,you heard me.This columnist
will narrate the wackiest Big Game
without referencing a single player
on the rosters of Stanford or Cal. In
stead, I base the game off of the ran
dom attributes of both schools. Ran
dom but definitive.
Cal players begin the game by
bragging to Stanford players about
the abundant assortment of cheap
and greasy off-campus, hole-in-the
wall food joints. They describe won
drous places such as Zachary's, Top
Dawg, Fat Slice, Fenton's, the Asian
Ghetto and more: a murderer's row
(literally, the food in some joints can
probably kill you) of eateries. Pro
pelled by the greasy food, Cal rushes
off to a quick touchdown. 7-0 Cal.
Then they tell stories of Cal's sur
roundings — which give you that
feeling that Frank the Tank could be
streaking down any street. You also
feel you could get shot as you turn
any street corner, but that's another
story.
Stanford players realize that Uni
versity Avenue is a dream...for rich
yuppies who wish they were college
students. Plus, Berkeley doesn't just
shut down after bedtime. Demoral
ized by the Bear's superior off-cam
pus accommodations, the Stanford
defense allows another touchdown,
making it 14-0 Cal. Wait, 1 thought
Buddy Teevens left Stanford...
Fortunately, the numerous hip
pies and bums inhabiting Berkeley
slow the Cal team down, and we've
reached a new quarter of play.
Then Stanford players remember
how much better their on-campus
food is.
Never having dared to try Cal's
reportedly God-awful dorm food
and taking into account the amazing
special dinner I had this past week. I
think Stanford has better on-cam
pus food. Propelled by a hearty-
Wilbur brunch. Cardinal football
cuts the deficit in half, 14-7, with a
touchdown.
Then Stanford brings out Admis


Raghav
Thapar
Rants and Raves
sions Director Richard Shaw whose
mere presence reminds Cal players
and fans that they were rejected by
Stanford. This causes great anguish
on the Cal side and the defense
yields a field goal. 14-10 Cal.
Of course, no Cal-Stanford com
parison is complete without compar
ing the Campanile to Hoover. Theirs
is taller, but ours is wider. Who real
ly cares though?
Throughout their years, Cal play
ers have been told that Stanford
looks like aTaco Bell — a really nice
Taco Bell. Mystified by Stanford's
actual beauty, the Bears' defense
gives up another touchdown and
Stanford rolls into halftime with a
17-14 lead.
Heading into the second half, Cal
fans bring the crazy. They absolutely
hate us. You can wear a Go Cal shirt
here; you probably shouldn't wear
anything resembling red at Cal.
Stanford has some crazy sports fans
(see Sixth Man Club), but even if we
win Big Game, I can't see Stanford
fans tearing down the goalpost, run
ning it down University and per
forming in some animalistic ritual
like Cal fans did three years ago.
Fearing slaughter from their fans,
the Cal offense runs down the field
fora 21-17 lead.
They probably deserve another
field goal because I expect some Cal
kid to assassinate me once he reads
this full column. 24-17, Cal.
However, that craziness also
makes them a little too intense for
me. I can imagine their Big Game
festivities being Manchurian Candi
datesque indoctrination sections. I
bet every Cal student will curl up his
fist in a ball of rage for the rest of his
