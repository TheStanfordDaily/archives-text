# Who wins the Biggest Game yet?

### 
It's the moment you have all been
waiting for: the definitive, be all
end all Big Game between Cal
and Stanford. And it has nothing to
do with football.
Yes,you heard me.This columnist
will narrate the wackiest Big Game
without referencing a single player
on the rosters of Stanford or Cal. In
stead, I base the game off of the ran
dom attributes of both schools. Ran
dom but definitive.
Cal players begin the game by
bragging to Stanford players about
the abundant assortment of cheap
and greasy off-campus, hole-in-the
wall food joints. They describe won
drous places such as Zachary's, Top
Dawg, Fat Slice, Fenton's, the Asian
Ghetto and more: a murderer's row
(literally, the food in some joints can
probably kill you) of eateries. Pro
pelled by the greasy food, Cal rushes
off to a quick touchdown. 7-0 Cal.
Then they tell stories of Cal's sur
roundings â€” which give you that
feeling that Frank the Tank could be
streaking down any street. You also
feel you could get shot as you turn
any street corner, but that's another
story.
Stanford players realize that Uni
versity Avenue is a dream...for rich
yuppies who wish they were college
students. Plus, Berkeley doesn't just
shut down after bedtime. Demoral
ized by the Bear's superior off-cam
pus accommodations, the Stanford
defense allows another touchdown,
making it 14-0 Cal. Wait, 1 thought
Buddy Teevens left Stanford...
Fortunately, the numerous hip
pies and bums inhabiting Berkeley
slow the Cal team down, and we've
reached a new quarter of play.
Then Stanford players remember
how much better their on-campus
food is.
Never having dared to try Cal's
reportedly God-awful dorm food
and taking into account the amazing
special dinner I had this past week. I
think Stanford has better on-cam
pus food. Propelled by a hearty-
Wilbur brunch. Cardinal football
cuts the deficit in half, 14-7, with a
touchdown.
