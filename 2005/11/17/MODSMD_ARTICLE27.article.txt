## Colletti leaves SF for Dodgers 
### JANIE McCAULEY AP SPORTS WRITER 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Brian Sabean always ex
pected Ned Colletti to become a general manager one day,
just not for the San Francisco Giants' fiercest rival.
Colletti was introduced as GM of the Los Angeles
Dodgers on Wednesday, leaving Sabean and his staff to
scramble heading into next month's winter meetings in
Dallas.
"Hopefully it won't ruin a friendship." Sabean said
Wednesday of Colletti's departure. "Obviously, he's in
hated Dodger Blue now. He'll probably hate a lot of pasta
dinners with Tommy (Lasorda). It is an interesting twist of
fate. You know how close we are. You spend so much time
with somebody in the profession."
For now, Sabean and Bobby Evans, the club's director of
minor league operations, will share the load. Sabean gath
ered Colletti's files on Monday once he knew his right
hand man likely was headed down the coast to Southern
California.
Sabean "did everything I could to contact everybody we
had interest in." though some of that work will have to wait
a few days. He is in St. Petersburg, Fla., where he will get
married Friday.
The Giants weren't close enough on any free agent
deals for Colletti's job change to affect negotiations,
Sabean said.
While the news of Colletti's promotion was bittersweet,
Sabean and the Giants are thrilled their colleague is final
ly getting his shot at age 50 and after nine seasons under
Sabean.
"It's something he richly deserves and is long overdue,"
Sabean said. "While it's gratifying for him, it's something
you take personally because you're losing something close
to the organization. ...This is something we all had hoped
for. He should have been in position long before this."
San Francisco's top offseason priority is to bolster its
starting pitching and perhaps find a left-handed bat as in
surance if Barry Bonds can't play every day. The Giants
also have decisions to make at first base and in the outfield
because of the injury problems of Bonds and right fielder
