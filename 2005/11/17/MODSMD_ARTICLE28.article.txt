# ON CAMPUS
## Panel promotes understanding 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
Religious Studies Prof. Arnold Eisen and Univer
sity of Hawaii Prof. Ramdas Lamb were keynote
speakers at yesterday's University panel aimed at
promoting dialogue between Jewish and Hindu com
munities on college campuses.
"This is the first time in my 20 years at Stanford
that I've been invited to share a platform with the
Hindu community," Eisen said.
Titled "Countering Bias Against Hindus and Jews
in the College Campus." the panel was a landmark ef
fort in building common ground between the minori
ty religious groups. Co-sponsored by the American
Jewish Committee and the Hindu American Founda
tion, the event also drew student support from I fillet
and the Hindu Student Council.
The talk aimed to voice and analyze cases of bias

against both factions in contemporary academia. Mod
erator Aaron Gross, a doctoral student from UC-Santa
Barbara, summed up the philosophy behind the event.
"It's not only the academic presentation of our
communities that affects us," he said. "It also works
the other way, where our collaborative efforts can
bring about positive change in scholarship as well."
ITie panel brought to the surface numerous cases
of academic hostility against both minorities. Bias
took a range of forms, from offensive elementary
school textbooks to suggestions for changing one's
name to hide personal creed.
According to Eisen, a fifth-grade textbook that
had come up for review before a state board of educa
tion contained a student exercise enacting the cruci
fixion of Christ, in which a Jew was portrayed as the
killer of Jesus.
