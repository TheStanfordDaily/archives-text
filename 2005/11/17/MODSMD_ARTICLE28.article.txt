# ON CAMPUS
## Panel promotes understanding 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
Religious Studies Prof. Arnold Eisen and Univer
sity of Hawaii Prof. Ramdas Lamb were keynote
speakers at yesterday's University panel aimed at
promoting dialogue between Jewish and Hindu com
munities on college campuses.
"This is the first time in my 20 years at Stanford
that I've been invited to share a platform with the
Hindu community," Eisen said.
Titled "Countering Bias Against Hindus and Jews
in the College Campus." the panel was a landmark ef
fort in building common ground between the minori
ty religious groups. Co-sponsored by the American
Jewish Committee and the Hindu American Founda
tion, the event also drew student support from I fillet
and the Hindu Student Council.
The talk aimed to voice and analyze cases of bias

against both factions in contemporary academia. Mod
erator Aaron Gross, a doctoral student from UC-Santa
Barbara, summed up the philosophy behind the event.
"It's not only the academic presentation of our
communities that affects us," he said. "It also works
the other way, where our collaborative efforts can
bring about positive change in scholarship as well."
ITie panel brought to the surface numerous cases
of academic hostility against both minorities. Bias
took a range of forms, from offensive elementary
school textbooks to suggestions for changing one's
name to hide personal creed.
According to Eisen, a fifth-grade textbook that
had come up for review before a state board of educa
tion contained a student exercise enacting the cruci
fixion of Christ, in which a Jew was portrayed as the
killer of Jesus.
"When American textbooks pres
ent minority religions, they portray
minority religions in a very unfair
way," Eisen said. "If this was the way
religion was going to be taught at
schools, I thought I'd rather not have
religion taught at all." Although the
book was not approved for use, this
trend of negative portrayals is still
present in 21st century academia, he
said.
Lamb offered a subtler but more
personal case of prejudice against
himself as a Hindu. During his aca
demic career toward obtaining pro
fessorship, he claimed he was asked
not once, but twice, to change his
name.

"They told me that Ramdas was a
convert Hindu name," he said. "It
would impede me from obtaining a
job since the perception is that con
verts are very subjective and lack
ability to objectively criticize."
This issue of name-switching
spurred the panel to discuss the larg
er question of personal creed as a
breeder of subjectivity and hence an
impediment to religious scholarship.
Must you be a closet Hindu in order
to teach Hinduism from the critical
perspective required in a university
setting? Both speakers fervently de
nied the proposition.
"We can still be critical scholars
without having to hide our personal
belief systems," Lamb said. "In fact. I
think personal creed enhances criti
cal understanding since I know both
the inside and the outside. Some
people say that you can only know
something from the outside to stay

objective, but in my perspective,
both inside and outside are halves of
a whole that are needed fora more
complete understanding."
Today, Jews have already paved
the way into the upper ladder of
American professions while the
number of Hindus in America grows
at exponential speed, topping two
million according to the Hindu
American Foundation. As such,
Mihir Meghani, president of the
Hindu American Foundation, said
that cooperation between the two
prominent minorities was not only
advisable, but vital.
"We held this program at Stan
ford because education has always
been highly valued in both com
munities," Meghani said. '"And as
both minorities in this country
coming from religions that don't
believe in evangelism, we face sim
ilar challenges in the academic set

ting that need to be shared and
taught."
Out of the constructive criticism
of the strife in modern religious
scholarship, the evening also
brewed optimism. Senior Carla
Fenves, a religious studies major
and a student speaker on the panel,
stated that the University, despite
its faults, still provided an excellent
arena for dialogue with those of
different faiths.
"I have not encountered a single
person at Stanford that's not been
open to learning about other tradi
tions," Fenves said. "I'm a reformed
Jew. After college, I'll probably re
turn to a reformed synagogue and
celebrate my opinion with other fel
low reformed Jews — which is in and
of itself segregated. For me, the Uni
versity and the religious studies envi
ronment has been a wonderful op
portunity for diverse learning."

The talk aimed to voice and analyze cases of bias

against both factions in contemporary academia. Mod
erator Aaron Gross, a doctoral student from UC-Santa
Barbara, summed up the philosophy behind the event.
"It's not only the academic presentation of our
communities that affects us," he said. "It also works
the other way, where our collaborative efforts can
bring about positive change in scholarship as well."
ITie panel brought to the surface numerous cases
of academic hostility against both minorities. Bias
took a range of forms, from offensive elementary
school textbooks to suggestions for changing one's
name to hide personal creed.
According to Eisen, a fifth-grade textbook that
had come up for review before a state board of educa
tion contained a student exercise enacting the cruci
fixion of Christ, in which a Jew was portrayed as the
killer of Jesus.
"When American textbooks pres
ent minority religions, they portray
minority religions in a very unfair
way," Eisen said. "If this was the way
religion was going to be taught at
schools, I thought I'd rather not have
religion taught at all." Although the
book was not approved for use, this
trend of negative portrayals is still
present in 21st century academia, he
said.
Lamb offered a subtler but more
personal case of prejudice against
himself as a Hindu. During his aca
demic career toward obtaining pro
fessorship, he claimed he was asked
not once, but twice, to change his
name.

"They told me that Ramdas was a
convert Hindu name," he said. "It
would impede me from obtaining a
job since the perception is that con
verts are very subjective and lack
ability to objectively criticize."
This issue of name-switching
spurred the panel to discuss the larg
er question of personal creed as a
breeder of subjectivity and hence an
impediment to religious scholarship.
Must you be a closet Hindu in order
to teach Hinduism from the critical
perspective required in a university
setting? Both speakers fervently de
nied the proposition.
"We can still be critical scholars
without having to hide our personal
belief systems," Lamb said. "In fact. I
think personal creed enhances criti
cal understanding since I know both
the inside and the outside. Some
people say that you can only know
something from the outside to stay

objective, but in my perspective,
both inside and outside are halves of
a whole that are needed fora more
complete understanding."
Today, Jews have already paved
the way into the upper ladder of
American professions while the
number of Hindus in America grows
at exponential speed, topping two
million according to the Hindu
American Foundation. As such,
Mihir Meghani, president of the
Hindu American Foundation, said
that cooperation between the two
prominent minorities was not only
advisable, but vital.
"We held this program at Stan
ford because education has always
been highly valued in both com
munities," Meghani said. '"And as
both minorities in this country
coming from religions that don't
believe in evangelism, we face sim
ilar challenges in the academic set

ting that need to be shared and
taught."
Out of the constructive criticism
of the strife in modern religious
scholarship, the evening also
brewed optimism. Senior Carla
Fenves, a religious studies major
and a student speaker on the panel,
stated that the University, despite
its faults, still provided an excellent
arena for dialogue with those of
different faiths.
"I have not encountered a single
person at Stanford that's not been
open to learning about other tradi
tions," Fenves said. "I'm a reformed
Jew. After college, I'll probably re
turn to a reformed synagogue and
celebrate my opinion with other fel
low reformed Jews — which is in and
of itself segregated. For me, the Uni
versity and the religious studies envi
ronment has been a wonderful op
portunity for diverse learning."
Religious Studies Prof. Arnold Eisen and Univer
sity of Hawaii Prof. Ramdas Lamb were keynote
speakers at yesterday's University panel aimed at
promoting dialogue between Jewish and Hindu com
munities on college campuses.
"This is the first time in my 20 years at Stanford
that I've been invited to share a platform with the
Hindu community," Eisen said.
Titled "Countering Bias Against Hindus and Jews
in the College Campus." the panel was a landmark ef
fort in building common ground between the minori
ty religious groups. Co-sponsored by the American
Jewish Committee and the Hindu American Founda
tion, the event also drew student support from I fillet
and the Hindu Student Council.
