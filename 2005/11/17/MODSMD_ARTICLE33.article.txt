Ast season Stanford faced
about as much adversity on
the court as any other team in
the country. It lost its leading
* scorer to an injury, its athletic
freshman to academic ineligibility and the
team was in its first season without the
winningest coach in school history.
Yet when March rolled around, the
Cardinal were where they always seem
to be, playing in their 11th straight
NCAA Tournament.
This year. No. 13 Stanford is hoping
that things do go a little smoother, but
even if they don't, the Cardinal feel ready
for the worst.
"Given what we went through last year.
1 know I'm ready for anything," said sec
ond-year head coach Trent Johnson, who
led the team to an 18-13 record last season.
But Johnson will have help navigating
the treacherous waters of Pacific-10 Con
ference basketball from a trio of experi
enced seniors: guards Chris Hernandez
and Dan Grunfeld and forward Matt
Haryasz. The team's success depends
heavily upon the ability of the three se
niors in the starting lineup to fight through
any adversity that the Cardinal face.
None of the misfortune that struck last
season was more damaging to the Cardi
nal than Grunfeld's season-ending ACL
tear two-thirds of the way through the
year. Before the injury, Grunfeld's scor
ing average had shot up by 14.5 points
from the previous season to lead the team
through the first 22 games. He is just now
starting to get back to the level at which he
played last season.

"(My knee] is feeling better," Grunfeld said. "It
is a process getting back to full go, but I'm getting
there. I feel pretty comfortable with where I am at.
I've worked pretty hard throughout the whole
process to put myself in the best possible position."
Grunfeld scored 19 points in just 31 minutes on the
court in Stanford's two preseason exhibition games,
but there is some concern that his injury will limit the
aggressiveness that propelled his success last season.
"Dan has looked good in practice," Johnson
said. "He's been consistent offensively, but obvi
ously it's goingjo take some time."
While Grunfeld eases his way back, Hernandez
will be responsible for picking up much of the slack

RIDING THE BENCH

in the backcourt. Hernandez, who along with
Grunfeld is a preseason John Wooden Ail-
American candidate, has been one of the most
consistent players for the Cardinal over the
last two years. Last season he was second tin
the team in points per game with 15.2 and first
in assists and minutes played.
Many Cardinal fans didn't expect to see
Hernandez back at Maples Pavilion this sea
son after he entered the 2005 NBA Draft, but
fortunately for the Cardinal he withdrew just
before the deadline to return for his final sea
son of eligibility.
"He knows that at crucial points in a game
the ball is going to be in his hands," Johnson said.
"There is no doubt that we need him out there."
The Cardinal will also rely heavily on
Haryasz, who is their only proven inside force.
He finished second in the conference in re
bounding and needs to step that up even more,
in light of the lack of depth at the center and
power forward positions — perhaps the Cardi
nal's most glaring weakness.
The three starting seniors are as good as any
trio in the county, but Stanford's success this
season may depend more on how the contribu
tors around them play. With the loss of gradu
ating seniors Rob Little and Nick Robinson,
the Cardinal are left at the post positions with a
collection of young big men with little game ex
perience, such as sophomore power forward
Taj Finger and players whom conventional wis
dom would dictate are too small to play down
low, like junior Fred Washington. Washington
appears to have earned the starting spot at
power forward, despite standing just 6-foot-5.
"Just because you're not 6-foot-10 or 6-
foot-11, it doesn't mean you can't play big,"
Johnson said. "1 feel comfortable with Fred
playing as a big man."
Washington is one of the most athletic play
ers on the team's roster, but his lack of size
could force some of the team's smaller guards
to get into the mix picking up boards.
If Stanford is looking fora larger body, it
will likely go to sophomore center Peter
Prowitt, who saw limited action off the

bench last season. Prowitt. who
stands 6-foot-10, should see plen
ty of floor time, but there are

questions about his ability to stay out of foul
trouble and contribute offensively.
"Prowitt is going to have no choice but to
contribute," Johnson said. "He has worked ex
tremely hard to get better. He has a physical
presence and needs to use that to get rebounds.
While he has worked and tried very hard, it is
also on us not to put him in situations where we
ask too much from him."
Freshman Lawrence Hill presents another
option for the Cardinal. At 6-foot-8 he may be
tall enough to play down low but lacks the
strength and experience to be a viable inside
force. Hill did, however, lead the Cardinal in
rebounding during their two exhibition games.
Hill is one of three freshman added to this
year's squad, along with point guard Mitch
Johnson and guard Anthony Goods. Johnson is
expected to have the biggest impact of the three
this season and will likely play the point at
times, while Hernandez or senior guard Jason
Haas shifts over to shooting guard. Redshirt
sophomore Tim Morris is expected to start at
the position and contribute after missing much
of last season due to academic ineligibility.
"'Hie freshmen have come in and responded
really well," Grunfeld said. "It is tough to come
from high school to college because you have to
learn a new system and you're probably not the
biggest or the strongest guy anymore. But they
have done a great job in adapting to our system."
Adaptation is one of the hallmarks of any
Stanford team, and that is in large part what the
Cardinal need to do again this year.
Stanford kicks off its season when UC-
Irvine (1-1) comes to Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday. 'Hie Anteaters are coming off a 94-40
thrashing of Mississippi Valley State.
"Any time you beat a Division I school by 54
points, that speaks volumes," Johnson said.
"We're going to have our hands full on Saturday.
They are a very skilled squad, and if you make a
mistake defensively they will make you pay."
Point guard Aaron Fitzgerald leads the
Anteaters' offensive attack, averaging nearly
10 points and eight assists per game in the
young season.
The Cardinal hope that Saturday's game
does not present much of a hurdle, but if it does,
thev should be readv for it. ♦
