Ast season Stanford faced
about as much adversity on
the court as any other team in
the country. It lost its leading
* scorer to an injury, its athletic
freshman to academic ineligibility and the
team was in its first season without the
winningest coach in school history.
Yet when March rolled around, the
Cardinal were where they always seem
to be, playing in their 11th straight
NCAA Tournament.
This year. No. 13 Stanford is hoping
that things do go a little smoother, but
even if they don't, the Cardinal feel ready
for the worst.
"Given what we went through last year.
1 know I'm ready for anything," said sec
ond-year head coach Trent Johnson, who
led the team to an 18-13 record last season.
But Johnson will have help navigating
the treacherous waters of Pacific-10 Con
ference basketball from a trio of experi
enced seniors: guards Chris Hernandez
and Dan Grunfeld and forward Matt
Haryasz. The team's success depends
heavily upon the ability of the three se
niors in the starting lineup to fight through
any adversity that the Cardinal face.
None of the misfortune that struck last
season was more damaging to the Cardi
nal than Grunfeld's season-ending ACL
tear two-thirds of the way through the
year. Before the injury, Grunfeld's scor
ing average had shot up by 14.5 points
from the previous season to lead the team
through the first 22 games. He is just now
starting to get back to the level at which he
played last season.

"(My knee] is feeling better," Grunfeld said. "It
is a process getting back to full go, but I'm getting
there. I feel pretty comfortable with where I am at.
I've worked pretty hard throughout the whole
process to put myself in the best possible position."
Grunfeld scored 19 points in just 31 minutes on the
court in Stanford's two preseason exhibition games,
but there is some concern that his injury will limit the
aggressiveness that propelled his success last season.
"Dan has looked good in practice," Johnson
said. "He's been consistent offensively, but obvi
ously it's goingjo take some time."
While Grunfeld eases his way back, Hernandez
will be responsible for picking up much of the slack
