The college basketball landscape changes every year, and the Pacific-10 Conference is no ex
ception. Gone are Pac-1() Player of the Year Ike Diogu, Arizona sharpshooter Salim
Stoudamire and big man Channing Frye and Washington's magnificent trio. Losses like these
are par for the course, but we think the standings won't be too shaken up. Will this be just an
other year in the Pac-10? That depends on how deep these teams are able to.advance in March.E

d-s NO. 13 STANFORD
\vß Chris Hernandez, Matt Haryasz and
Dan Grunfeld make up one of the
strongest trios of seniors in the country.
Fred Washington and Tim Morris are good
athletes who will grow to become solid role
players. An easy out-of-conference sched
ule should allow Stanford to figure out its
frontcourt rotation and shore up its de
fense before the Pac-10 season begins.
NO. 10 ARIZONA
Senior guard Hassan Adams is per
haps the most athletic player in the
conference, but the Wildcats squad may
have trouble coping with the departure of
Salim Stoudamire and Channing Frye, the
team's leading scorer and rebounder, re
spectively. Junior Mustafa Shakur deftly
runs the point and should take the helm of
the relatively inexperienced team while
some of the younger players develop.
O WASHINGTON
Nate Robinson, Will Conroy and
Tre Simmons all depart from the
Huskies, who will have to find replace
ments for their top two scorers and all time
assists leader. Senior guard Brandon Roy
will have to develop into a leader. Fresh
man forward Jon Brockman, one of the
most highly-touted recruits in the country,
will also be expected to make an impact.
4 NO. 19 UCLA
— Sophomores Jordan Farmar and
~ Aaron Afflalo should hold down the
Bruin backcourt until their classmate,
forward Josh Shipp, returns in December.
Cedric Bozeman, a 6-foot-6 guard who
started at point guard in his first three sea
sons but missed all of last year with a torn
ACL, returns to the lineup and could be a
key player off the bench.

C OREGON
\)gjP " Like Stanford, the Ducks are loaded
in the backcourt hut have questions
up front. Unlike Stanford, none of last
year's players graduated in the offseason,
though center lan Crosswhite was dis
missed from the team. Sophomore Malik
Hairston and junior Aaron Brooks form a
potent young backcourt tandem. Front
court transfer Ivan Johnson could spell the
difference between N-C-A-A and N-I-T.

Leon Powe was forced to miss the entire

2(X)4-2(X)5 season due to an ACL tear, after

one of the best freshman campaigns in Pac-10 his-

lory. The redshirt sophomore returns this season to

lead the Bears in what many see as a rebound year in
Berkeley. Senior guard Richard Midgley didn't quite live
up to expectations last season, and junior guard Ayinde
Übaka missed a large portion of the year due to injury. If
they play up to expectations, the Bears could make their
first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2(X)3.

OREGON STATE
The Beavers lost forward David Lucas, the
second-leading scorer in the Pac-10 last season.
Forwards Nick DeWitz and Sasa Cuic will attempt
to do their best to replace Lucas' production, but
they will need help from a backcourt that last year
was one of the weakest in the conference. Speedy
guard Jason Fontanet and Lamar Hurd need to step
up their games for the Beavers to contend.
© WASHINGTON STATE
— The departure of guard Thomas Kelati, the
Cougars' leading scorer last season, should hurt
the team. So will the loss of grinder Jeff Varem, a
Cardinal nemesis last year. Dick Bennett is one of
the game's finest defensive coaches, so look for his
team to be strong once again on that side of the ball.
The Cougars may hold conference opponents to
fewer than 60 points per game for the second year in
a row but they may again be hard-pressed to score 50.

0 usc
— USC was an in-between
team last year, caught in a re
building phase without a coach
when Rick Majerus resigned and
Tim Floyd opted to wait to take the
helm until this season. With a new
coach and the return of its top three
scorers, Floyd's team may be
poised fora climb up the Pac-10
standings this year. Sophomores
Gabe Pruitt and Nick Young team
up with junior Lodrick Stewart to
form a fast, offensively-minded
backcourt, but the difference in the
Trojans' season may be how well
they fill in holes at the posts.
