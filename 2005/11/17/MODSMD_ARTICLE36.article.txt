## looking to rebound After returning from academic suspension, guard Tim Morris is locked in and ready to contribute. 
### SEAN HOWELL 
Redshirt sophomore Tim
Morris is one of the quickest
and most explosive players
on the Stanford basketball
team. For evidence, look no
further than the second half of Saturday's
exhibition against Cal Poly Pomona, dur
ing which he blazed past the defense and
laid in a cross-court pass from junior Fred
Washington.
Seeing Morris in the open court was a
welcome sight. He wasn't able to bring
his high-flying style of play to the floor for
much of last season, making fora frus
trating year.
Morris' ability to slice to the hoop and
lead fast-breaks earned him almost 20
minutes per game early in the season.
The high point came when head coach
Trent Johnson inserted him into the
starting lineup against Washington on
Jan. 2. Morris proved that he deserved

Johnson's trust, scoring 12 points in a sea
son-high 33 minutes and emerging as a
reliable scoring threat on a team that des
perately needed one.
But then the NCAA put the brakes on
his breakout season. Two days after Mor
ris' big game at Washington, the sport's
governing body declared him academi
cally ineligible for winter quarter, citing a
rule that requires athletes to pass at least
six units every term. It was designed to in
crease graduation rates and make sure
that players continued to take at least a
few classes, but it didn't seem to apply to
Morris, who was attempting to pass the
intensive 10-unit Human Biology core.
He appealed the ruling because he
had been trying to challenge himself aca
demically, not avoid doing schoolwork.
But the NCAA denied it, cutting the
electricity on Stanford's spark plug.
"'Disappointment' is the one word

that basically sums it up," the soft-spo
ken, level-headed guard said of his reac
tion to the decision. "Disappointed in
myself, and in not being able to play. The
rule was set for people who weren't try
ing to challenge themselves, who were
just trying to get through school. But I
still failed the class."
A situation that would have been
painful enough became agonizing when
point guard Chris Hernandez sat out the
Cardinal's next game against Arizona
State with back spasms, forcing a fa
tigued Jason Haas to start and play 36
minutes while guard Dan Grunfeld
stayed on the floor for the full 40. Stan
ford lost, 81-69.
After that, it only got worse for the
Cardinal backcourt. Hernandez was way
laid by the flu on the team's next road trip
to Los Angeles. Three weeks later, Grun
feld's season ended when he fell awk-

wardly in a game
against California
and tore his ACL.
Morris could
only watch in
street clothes as
Haas spelled Her
nandez and Wash
ington assumed
Grunfeld's start
ing spot. During
the crucial stretch
run, the Pacific-10
and NCAA tour
naments, he would
only see one other
healthy guard
when he looked
down the bench.
Morris knew that

he could help at the precariously thin po
sition, but, while most defenders were
powerless to slow him, a slip of paper by
from the NCAA shut him down.
'The hardest part was watching when
we were losing games where I could see
myself helping the team, by driving, cre
ating offensive opportunities, making
people better," he said. "That was the
hardest part, knowing that I could have
helped us win in a few games."
While the Cardinal rebounded to go
12-5 after the Arizona State contest and
secure an NCAA Tournament berth,
Morris hit the gym. He continued to prac
tice with the team, and when the other
players traveled, he worked out and
honed his jump shot, previously his
biggest weakness. The time Morris spent
improving his jumper seems to have paid
off: His first three baskets in Saturday's
exhibition came on a runner in the lane, a
long-range pull-up and a three-pointer.
He also did what few defenders could
and slowed himself down.
"I had the idea that I wasn't being
quick if I wasn't going fast all the lime,"

Morris said of his mental approach last
season. "Now, I try to slow the game
down and let things come to me. I try to
take what the defense gives me."
Johnson noticed the improvement on
Saturday.
"Sometimes he has the tendency to
get out of control in transition, but he
made some pretty good decisions today,"
Johnson said of Morris' play.
He will still have to convince his coach
that he can pull down rebounds, however;
over three scrimmages and the two exhibi
tion games this fall, Morris grabbed fewer
boards per minute than anyone else on the
team except Haas, according to Johnson.
Morris scored 13 points in only 17 min
utes against Pomona on Saturday, mak
ing five of seven shots from the field. He
had also played well in the Cardinal's first
exhibition game against Sonoma State
the previous weekend, scoring eight
points in 13 minutes and snatching two
steals. Perhaps most importantly, Morris
didn't commit a turnover in either game.
Morris will always find ways to score,
but he prides himself more on his defense
these days, saying that his offensive out
put feeds off the energy created during a
defensive stand. He averaged nine re
bounds per game during his senior year
in high school and claimed that he is pre
pared to fight for rebounds in Stanford's
smaller lineup.
That's a big change in mindset fora
player who admits that, not too long ago,
he felt he wasn't playing well if he wasn't
scoring.
"I rushed a lot last year, and the way
that showed itself was in charges," Morris
said. "Now, if 1 draw two defenders, I
kick it to somebody else. If I'm trapped
on the baseline, I try to get the ball to the
perimeter. I read defenses a lot more
than I used to."
Johnson called Morris' overall de
fense decent, saying he thought that the
guard did a good job tracking Pomona's
ball-handlers on Saturday. But Morris
will have to improve on that side of the
ball if he is going to earn minutes.
After playing in a semi-pro league in
San Francisco and a tournament in Eu
rope over the summer, Morris again feels
comfortable in competitive situations.
He is meshing with the starting lineup
that he will likely join when the Cardinal
kick off their season Saturday.
But for now, basketball is fun again.
School is, too. Morris has put aside his
ambition to be a doctor, at least for the
time being, and has decided to major in
English, taking classes in British Litera
ture, Shakespeare and poetry. Does
Morris' affinity for interpreting texts
have anything to do with his improved
ability to read defenses?
"No," he said, shaking his head em
phatically. "There are no similarities." â™¦

ing spot. During
the crucial stretch
run, the Pacific-10
and NCAA tour
naments, he would
only see one other
healthy guard
when he looked
down the bench.
Morris knew that

he could help at the precariously thin po
sition, but, while most defenders were
powerless to slow him, a slip of paper by
from the NCAA shut him down.
'The hardest part was watching when
we were losing games where I could see
myself helping the team, by driving, cre
ating offensive opportunities, making
people better," he said. "That was the
hardest part, knowing that I could have
helped us win in a few games."
While the Cardinal rebounded to go
12-5 after the Arizona State contest and
secure an NCAA Tournament berth,
Morris hit the gym. He continued to prac
tice with the team, and when the other
players traveled, he worked out and
honed his jump shot, previously his
biggest weakness. The time Morris spent
improving his jumper seems to have paid
off: His first three baskets in Saturday's
exhibition came on a runner in the lane, a
long-range pull-up and a three-pointer.
He also did what few defenders could
and slowed himself down.
"I had the idea that I wasn't being
quick if I wasn't going fast all the lime,"

Morris said of his mental approach last
season. "Now, I try to slow the game
down and let things come to me. I try to
take what the defense gives me."
Johnson noticed the improvement on
Saturday.
"Sometimes he has the tendency to
get out of control in transition, but he
made some pretty good decisions today,"
Johnson said of Morris' play.
He will still have to convince his coach
that he can pull down rebounds, however;
over three scrimmages and the two exhibi
tion games this fall, Morris grabbed fewer
boards per minute than anyone else on the
team except Haas, according to Johnson.
Morris scored 13 points in only 17 min
utes against Pomona on Saturday, mak
ing five of seven shots from the field. He
had also played well in the Cardinal's first
exhibition game against Sonoma State
the previous weekend, scoring eight
points in 13 minutes and snatching two
steals. Perhaps most importantly, Morris
didn't commit a turnover in either game.
Morris will always find ways to score,
but he prides himself more on his defense
these days, saying that his offensive out
put feeds off the energy created during a
defensive stand. He averaged nine re
bounds per game during his senior year
in high school and claimed that he is pre
pared to fight for rebounds in Stanford's
smaller lineup.
That's a big change in mindset fora
player who admits that, not too long ago,
he felt he wasn't playing well if he wasn't
scoring.
"I rushed a lot last year, and the way
that showed itself was in charges," Morris
said. "Now, if 1 draw two defenders, I
kick it to somebody else. If I'm trapped
on the baseline, I try to get the ball to the
perimeter. I read defenses a lot more
than I used to."
Johnson called Morris' overall de
fense decent, saying he thought that the
guard did a good job tracking Pomona's
ball-handlers on Saturday. But Morris
will have to improve on that side of the
ball if he is going to earn minutes.
After playing in a semi-pro league in
San Francisco and a tournament in Eu
rope over the summer, Morris again feels
comfortable in competitive situations.
He is meshing with the starting lineup
that he will likely join when the Cardinal
kick off their season Saturday.
But for now, basketball is fun again.
School is, too. Morris has put aside his
ambition to be a doctor, at least for the
time being, and has decided to major in
English, taking classes in British Litera
ture, Shakespeare and poetry. Does
Morris' affinity for interpreting texts
have anything to do with his improved
ability to read defenses?
"No," he said, shaking his head em
phatically. "There are no similarities." â™¦

ON HIS SUSPENSION
NINA GONZALUDO/The Stanford Daily
u.
Redshirt sophomore Tim
Morris is one of the quickest
and most explosive players
on the Stanford basketball
team. For evidence, look no
further than the second half of Saturday's
exhibition against Cal Poly Pomona, dur
ing which he blazed past the defense and
laid in a cross-court pass from junior Fred
Washington.
Seeing Morris in the open court was a
welcome sight. He wasn't able to bring
his high-flying style of play to the floor for
much of last season, making fora frus
trating year.
Morris' ability to slice to the hoop and
lead fast-breaks earned him almost 20
minutes per game early in the season.
The high point came when head coach
Trent Johnson inserted him into the
starting lineup against Washington on
Jan. 2. Morris proved that he deserved

Johnson's trust, scoring 12 points in a sea
son-high 33 minutes and emerging as a
reliable scoring threat on a team that des
perately needed one.
But then the NCAA put the brakes on
his breakout season. Two days after Mor
ris' big game at Washington, the sport's
governing body declared him academi
cally ineligible for winter quarter, citing a
rule that requires athletes to pass at least
six units every term. It was designed to in
crease graduation rates and make sure
that players continued to take at least a
few classes, but it didn't seem to apply to
Morris, who was attempting to pass the
intensive 10-unit Human Biology core.
He appealed the ruling because he
had been trying to challenge himself aca
demically, not avoid doing schoolwork.
But the NCAA denied it, cutting the
electricity on Stanford's spark plug.
"'Disappointment' is the one word

that basically sums it up," the soft-spo
ken, level-headed guard said of his reac
tion to the decision. "Disappointed in
myself, and in not being able to play. The
rule was set for people who weren't try
ing to challenge themselves, who were
just trying to get through school. But I
still failed the class."
A situation that would have been
painful enough became agonizing when
point guard Chris Hernandez sat out the
Cardinal's next game against Arizona
State with back spasms, forcing a fa
tigued Jason Haas to start and play 36
minutes while guard Dan Grunfeld
stayed on the floor for the full 40. Stan
ford lost, 81-69.
After that, it only got worse for the
Cardinal backcourt. Hernandez was way
laid by the flu on the team's next road trip
to Los Angeles. Three weeks later, Grun
feld's season ended when he fell awk-

wardly in a game
against California
and tore his ACL.
Morris could
only watch in
street clothes as
Haas spelled Her
nandez and Wash
ington assumed
