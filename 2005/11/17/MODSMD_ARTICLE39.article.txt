Most women's basket
hall teams would
fear a disappointing
season after the
graduation of five
talented seniors, including three
starters. But despite these losses. No.
11 Stanford once again has lofty goals
this year.
"As a team, we want what we al
ways want," sophomore guard Cissy
Pierce said. "That's to earn an NCAA
berth, win the Pac-10 title, then hope
fully make it to the Final Four and be
yond."
These aspirations are by no means
pipe dreams. Behind one of the na
tion's elite inside-outside combina
tions of junior center Brooke Smith
and sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins, the Cardinal were once again
picked by the coaches and media to
win the Pacific-10 Conference for the
sixth straight season.
"Candice and Brooke are our go
to players, and therefore a lot of other
players have to step up because the at
tention will be around them," junior
forward Kristin Newlin said. "They'll
be getting double, triple-teamed, so
that provides a lot of openings for the
rest of the team."
The supporting cast's youth could
prove to be a hurdle, especially early
in the year. Smith and Wiggins are the
only returning starters. Along with
Newlin, who averaged 16.4 minutes
last season, they are the only players
with solid game experience.
"When you have players like
|graduated| Kelley Suminski, who
started 128 games, there's a sense of
confidence you get," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Experience is a
valuable teacher. Without it, things
aren't as automatic or as smooth. This
season all the pieces are there, but we
just haven't fit them together yet and
it may take a little while."
The three other spots in the start
ing lineup are still open and have been
fought for in every practice. Newlin,
who averaged 8.2 points and five re
bounds per game in 20()4-2(X)5, is a
likely candidate for the starting five
after her production last year and an
