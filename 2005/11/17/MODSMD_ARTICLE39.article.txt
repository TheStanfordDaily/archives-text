Most women's basket
hall teams would
fear a disappointing
season after the
graduation of five
talented seniors, including three
starters. But despite these losses. No.
11 Stanford once again has lofty goals
this year.
"As a team, we want what we al
ways want," sophomore guard Cissy
Pierce said. "That's to earn an NCAA
berth, win the Pac-10 title, then hope
fully make it to the Final Four and be
yond."
These aspirations are by no means
pipe dreams. Behind one of the na
tion's elite inside-outside combina
tions of junior center Brooke Smith
and sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins, the Cardinal were once again
picked by the coaches and media to
win the Pacific-10 Conference for the
sixth straight season.
"Candice and Brooke are our go
to players, and therefore a lot of other
players have to step up because the at
tention will be around them," junior
forward Kristin Newlin said. "They'll
be getting double, triple-teamed, so
that provides a lot of openings for the
rest of the team."
The supporting cast's youth could
prove to be a hurdle, especially early
in the year. Smith and Wiggins are the
only returning starters. Along with
Newlin, who averaged 16.4 minutes
last season, they are the only players
with solid game experience.
"When you have players like
|graduated| Kelley Suminski, who
started 128 games, there's a sense of
confidence you get," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Experience is a
valuable teacher. Without it, things
aren't as automatic or as smooth. This
season all the pieces are there, but we
just haven't fit them together yet and
it may take a little while."
The three other spots in the start
ing lineup are still open and have been
fought for in every practice. Newlin,
who averaged 8.2 points and five re
bounds per game in 20()4-2(X)5, is a
likely candidate for the starting five
after her production last year and an

impressive preseason. Freshman for
ward Jillian Harmon's scoring ability
is getting the team's attention, and she
could play major minutes.
"Jillian's done really well," Smith
said. "She's a smart player who makes
good decisions and just knows basket
ball really well."
Regardless of who is on the court
for tip-off, the Cardinal intend to play
many different combinations all year
long. By playing a large rotation, Stan
ford plans to utilize the depth it has
gained with the addition of another
skilled freshman class, the return of ju
nior Eziamaka Okafor from injury
and the addition of junior Clare Bo

densteiner, who redshirted last sea
son. This substitution pattern could
also keep fresh a potentially fast of
fense against less athletic opponents.
"We have the potential to be a very
up-tempo team, run the floor and run
opponents off the floor," Pierce said.
"This particular team is more ath
letic, though not as experienced as last
year's," VanDerveer added. "We
want to run, and we want to be more
extended defensively by pressing and
being more aggressive. I think our
style will be more successful [this year
than it was last year]."
Though the offense promises to be
potent, Stanford is constantly working
on shoring up the defensive holes left
by the graduated seniors with new
Cardinal players boldly stepping up to
the challenge.
"I want to fill the void left by T'Nae

Thiel, who was an amazing post de
fender," Newlin said. "I want to be a
defensive stopper against good post
players down low that the team can
count on."
Stanford garnered a 99-65 exhibi
tion win last Sunday over Love & Bas
ketball. The coaching staff was
pleased with the play of the front-line
and the free throw shooting but is
looking for improved play out of its
guards.
"The exhibition game was a good
way to see where we are right now and
what we need to work on, on both
sides of the ball," Pierce said. "Also, it
was just nice to play against other peo
ple besides ourselves after a long pre
season where you just play against
each other."
This weekend, the regular season
opens in Minnesota when Stanford

takes on Long Island in the Minnesota
Tournament. The Blackbirds are a
small and scrappy team that will con
stantly pressure Stanford and force
the Cardinal to knock down outside
shots. If the Cardinal are successful in
the first-round match, they could po
tentially play the host Minnesota
Golden Gophers.
"Minnesota can really bring in
their fans, so it will be important for us
as a young team to keep our compo
sure," Pierce said.
These early tests will prove just
how far the Cardinal have come and
how far they need to go before they
are out of the shadows of last year's se
niors. If the team's collective talent
and tenacity is any indication, they're
ready to run out and make a name for
themselves as one of the nation's top
teams.

Stanford garnered a 99-65 exhibi
tion win last Sunday over Love & Bas
ketball. The coaching staff was
pleased with the play of the front-line
and the free throw shooting but is
looking for improved play out of its
guards.
"The exhibition game was a good
way to see where we are right now and
what we need to work on, on both
sides of the ball," Pierce said. "Also, it
was just nice to play against other peo
ple besides ourselves after a long pre
season where you just play against
each other."
This weekend, the regular season
opens in Minnesota when Stanford

takes on Long Island in the Minnesota
Tournament. The Blackbirds are a
small and scrappy team that will con
stantly pressure Stanford and force
the Cardinal to knock down outside
shots. If the Cardinal are successful in
the first-round match, they could po
tentially play the host Minnesota
Golden Gophers.
"Minnesota can really bring in
their fans, so it will be important for us
as a young team to keep our compo
sure," Pierce said.
These early tests will prove just
how far the Cardinal have come and
how far they need to go before they
are out of the shadows of last year's se
niors. If the team's collective talent
and tenacity is any indication, they're
ready to run out and make a name for
themselves as one of the nation's top
teams.

Most women's basket
hall teams would
fear a disappointing
season after the
graduation of five
talented seniors, including three
starters. But despite these losses. No.
11 Stanford once again has lofty goals
this year.
"As a team, we want what we al
ways want," sophomore guard Cissy
Pierce said. "That's to earn an NCAA
berth, win the Pac-10 title, then hope
fully make it to the Final Four and be
yond."
These aspirations are by no means
pipe dreams. Behind one of the na
tion's elite inside-outside combina
tions of junior center Brooke Smith
and sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins, the Cardinal were once again
picked by the coaches and media to
win the Pacific-10 Conference for the
sixth straight season.
"Candice and Brooke are our go
to players, and therefore a lot of other
players have to step up because the at
tention will be around them," junior
forward Kristin Newlin said. "They'll
be getting double, triple-teamed, so
that provides a lot of openings for the
rest of the team."
The supporting cast's youth could
prove to be a hurdle, especially early
in the year. Smith and Wiggins are the
only returning starters. Along with
Newlin, who averaged 16.4 minutes
last season, they are the only players
with solid game experience.
"When you have players like
|graduated| Kelley Suminski, who
started 128 games, there's a sense of
confidence you get," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Experience is a
valuable teacher. Without it, things
aren't as automatic or as smooth. This
season all the pieces are there, but we
just haven't fit them together yet and
it may take a little while."
The three other spots in the start
ing lineup are still open and have been
fought for in every practice. Newlin,
who averaged 8.2 points and five re
bounds per game in 20()4-2(X)5, is a
likely candidate for the starting five
after her production last year and an

is getting the team's attention, and she
could play major minutes.
"Jillian's done really well," Smith
said. "She's a smart player who makes
good decisions and just knows basket
ball really well."
Regardless of who is on the court
for tip-off, the Cardinal intend to play
many different combinations all year

ford plans to utilize the depth it has
gained with the addition of another
skilled freshman class, the return of ju
nior Eziamaka Okafor from injury
and the addition of junior Clare Bo

densteiner, who redshirted last sea
son. This substitution pattern could
also keep fresh a potentially fast of
fense against less athletic opponents.
"We have the potential to be a very
up-tempo team, run the floor and run
opponents off the floor," Pierce said.
"This particular team is more ath
letic, though not as experienced as last
year's," VanDerveer added. "We
want to run, and we want to be more
extended defensively by pressing and
being more aggressive. I think our
style will be more successful [this year
than it was last year]."
Though the offense promises to be
potent, Stanford is constantly working
on shoring up the defensive holes left
by the graduated seniors with new
Cardinal players boldly stepping up to
the challenge.
"I want to fill the void left by T'Nae
