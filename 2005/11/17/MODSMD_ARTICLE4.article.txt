## Shaw implements several changes to admission office 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
With an admit rate of under 13 percent and falling, every
undergraduate who has been successfully admitted to Stan
ford has had to prove their worth and potential to the Office
of Undergraduate Admission in their applications.
While students have a good sense of what characteris
tics and portions of the undergraduate applications are
most important, many are mystified about what happens
between the time that they submit their applications to
when acceptance letters go out. This even applies to mem
bers of the Class of 2009, who went through this process a
little over a year ago.
"I don't know who makes decisions, but I know that

Prospective applicants to Stanford face a different admis
sions process once their applications are reviewed.
Committee review system set

there are admissions officers who
read the applications," said freshman
Jeff Cornelius.
"I'm not sure exactly what goes
on, but it must be really tough to de
cide," added freshman Wilson Velas
co.
While current Stanford students
may recall the signature of then Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Robin Mamlet on their acceptance
letters, the Class of 2010 will be wel
comed by a someone new.
That someone is Richard Shaw,
the current dean of admission and fi
nancial aid. Already busy conduct
ing his first admission cycle at Stan
ford and acclimating himself to the
University's environment and cul
ture, Shaw has also presided over a
number of changes in the Admission
Office.
A major change that Shaw is im
plementing is a modification of the
process by which applications are re
viewed. As before, there will still be
an initial review of all submissions by
admission officers assigned to differ
ent regions of the country.
"We'll be looking for the same
characteristics and same outcomes in
the coming classes," Shaw said. "We
want the most competitive appli
cants. I have the same commitment to
bringing a diverse class to Stanford."
However, Shaw is implementing a
committee-review system to replace
the system of passing applications up

to more senior officers before final
approval by the dean.
"It is more in concert with how the
admission process is conducted at
other comparable, competitive
schools," Shaw said, adding that this
was the system in place at Yale where
he formally worked as dean of admis
sion and financial aid.
"Candidates will be heard in a
committee environment," he said.
"This makes fora more democratic
process.The committee members will
have the opportunity to listen, ask
questions and discuss candidates.
This will ensure we give each candi
date a fair hearing."
Upon hearing about this shift in
the review process, current students
were enthusiastic about the change
and its possible outcomes.
"I think it's a good idea because
each admission officer can have dif
ferent perspectives on different stu
dents," said junior Nicole Bonoff.
"One thing that stands out to a partic
ular officer can be better brought out
in the committee system."
"I wouldn't want my fate to rely
on one person," Velasco said. "In a
committee, different people can
highlight different traits."
Shaw also noted that this will
bring about a different sort of envi
ronment inside the Admission Of
fice.
"This will also give the staff a
sense of the whole and give them an

opportunity to get their voices
heard," he said.
Other changes this year include a
move to an entirely electronic review
process. Along with electronically
submitted applications, paper appli
cations that come in will be scanned
into a computer system. Admission
officers will be able to go online to
read the applications, instead of hav
ing to sift through piles of papers. Ac
cording to Shaw, this project has
been in the works for nearly a year.
He also added that he has several
other goals for the office that he
hopes to explore over the course of
the next few years.
"I also hope to increase the level
of outreach nationwide and world
wide; 1 want to attract the most com
petitive students," he said. "Our ef
forts will be focused on convincing
competitive students that Stanford is
a viable option."
Though his office is already busy
reviewing applications, Shaw is en
joying his transition to Stanford and
embracing the current student body.
"I'm having an incredible time
here," Shaw said. "The sunshine is
wonderful. This is an incredible place
with a lot of tradition."
While his office could not disclose
much information on the potential
Class of 2010, he did have one fore
cast for the near future.
"1 predict that we will beat Cal this
weekend," he said.

Class of 2010, he did have one fore
cast for the near future.
"1 predict that we will beat Cal this
weekend," he said.
With an admit rate of under 13 percent and falling, every
undergraduate who has been successfully admitted to Stan
ford has had to prove their worth and potential to the Office
of Undergraduate Admission in their applications.
While students have a good sense of what characteris
tics and portions of the undergraduate applications are
most important, many are mystified about what happens
between the time that they submit their applications to
when acceptance letters go out. This even applies to mem
bers of the Class of 2009, who went through this process a
little over a year ago.

Prospective applicants to Stanford face a different admis
sions process once their applications are reviewed.
Committee review system set

there are admissions officers who
read the applications," said freshman
Jeff Cornelius.
"I'm not sure exactly what goes
on, but it must be really tough to de
cide," added freshman Wilson Velas
co.
While current Stanford students
may recall the signature of then Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Robin Mamlet on their acceptance
letters, the Class of 2010 will be wel
comed by a someone new.
That someone is Richard Shaw,
the current dean of admission and fi
nancial aid. Already busy conduct
ing his first admission cycle at Stan
ford and acclimating himself to the
University's environment and cul
ture, Shaw has also presided over a
number of changes in the Admission
Office.
A major change that Shaw is im
plementing is a modification of the
process by which applications are re
viewed. As before, there will still be
an initial review of all submissions by
admission officers assigned to differ
ent regions of the country.
"We'll be looking for the same
characteristics and same outcomes in
the coming classes," Shaw said. "We
want the most competitive appli
cants. I have the same commitment to
bringing a diverse class to Stanford."
However, Shaw is implementing a
committee-review system to replace
the system of passing applications up

to more senior officers before final
approval by the dean.
"It is more in concert with how the
admission process is conducted at
other comparable, competitive
schools," Shaw said, adding that this
was the system in place at Yale where
he formally worked as dean of admis
sion and financial aid.
"Candidates will be heard in a
committee environment," he said.
"This makes fora more democratic
process.The committee members will
have the opportunity to listen, ask
questions and discuss candidates.
This will ensure we give each candi
date a fair hearing."
Upon hearing about this shift in
the review process, current students
were enthusiastic about the change
and its possible outcomes.
"I think it's a good idea because
each admission officer can have dif
ferent perspectives on different stu
dents," said junior Nicole Bonoff.
"One thing that stands out to a partic
ular officer can be better brought out
in the committee system."
"I wouldn't want my fate to rely
on one person," Velasco said. "In a
committee, different people can
highlight different traits."
Shaw also noted that this will
bring about a different sort of envi
ronment inside the Admission Of
fice.
"This will also give the staff a
sense of the whole and give them an

opportunity to get their voices
heard," he said.
Other changes this year include a
move to an entirely electronic review
process. Along with electronically
submitted applications, paper appli
cations that come in will be scanned
into a computer system. Admission
officers will be able to go online to
read the applications, instead of hav
ing to sift through piles of papers. Ac
cording to Shaw, this project has
been in the works for nearly a year.
He also added that he has several
other goals for the office that he
hopes to explore over the course of
the next few years.
"I also hope to increase the level
of outreach nationwide and world
wide; 1 want to attract the most com
petitive students," he said. "Our ef
forts will be focused on convincing
competitive students that Stanford is
a viable option."
Though his office is already busy
reviewing applications, Shaw is en
joying his transition to Stanford and
embracing the current student body.
"I'm having an incredible time
here," Shaw said. "The sunshine is
wonderful. This is an incredible place
with a lot of tradition."
