### BLAIR CRITCHLOW 
Women's
Basketball

Both the media and coaches preseason polls picked the No. 10 Stanford women's
basketball team to defend their conference crown for the sixth straight season.
However, other teams made giant leaps last season and have taken dead aim on the
reigning queens of West Coast basketball. To evaluate these threats, the Daily
handicapped the Pacific-10 Conference for the 2(X)5-2006 season.

;| NO. 10 STANFORD
Defending Pac-10 Player of the Year
Candice Wiggins and All Pac-10 center
Brooke Smith were two key cogs in last
year's Elite Eight run and will continue to be the
team's focal points. Both are preseason all-Pac
-10 picks, and they form one of the most formi
dable inside-outside duos in the nation. The loss
of five seniors is a potential hazard this season,
but Stanford believes the athleticism of their
supporting cast will pay dividends.
O NO. 15 ARIZONA STATE
The Sun Devils made a splash nationally
by reaching the Pac-10 tournament finals
and then advancing all the way to the NCAA
regional semifinals last season. Arizona State re
turns three starters from last year including pre
season all-conference pick in junior forward
Emily Westerbcrg. The Sun Devils are already
off to a quick 2-0 start, with victories over Mis
souri and a tough non-conlerence win over No. 20
Vanderbilt, 69-60.
O UCLA
The Bruins are coming off a sixth-place
finish in the conference, but they return so
much talent — including all five starters —
that most expect the Bruins to catapult up the
conference ladder. The team will rely heavily on
the guard play of senior Nikki Blue and junior
Noelle Quinn, who were selected as two mem
bers of the preseason All-Pac-10 team. This duo,
along with senior Lisa Willis, averaged over 16
points and six rebounds a game last year. The
Bruins are currently hovering just outside the top
25 in the national polls.
4 use
— The Trojans excelled last year under new
head coach Mark Trakh. earning their first
trip to the Big Dance in seven seasons. USC is
deepest in the junior class with six solid contribu
tors. The leaders of the team, however, are likely
to be sophomore guards Camille LeNoir and
Brynn Cameron. Cameron was named to the con
ference All-Freshman team last year, while
LeNoir received an honorable mention.
5 OREGON
— The Ducks, who currently stand at 1-1,
handed the Cardinal their only conference
loss last year in a 62-58 nail-biter in Eugene.
Oregon has emphasized tough team defense in
the offseason, which was the team's hallmark
last year. Continued vigilance could be even
more important this season, as the Ducks do
not bring back any proven offensive threats.
Their leading returning scorer, Chelsea Wagn
er, averaged 8.8 points per game last season.

WASHINGTON
— Like UCLA, the Huskies return
~ their entire starting lineup which
includes three players who averaged
almost 10 points per game. Last year,
Washington was one of the few pro
grams in the nation that did not have a
senior. This season, the team has three
seniors, and Washington will count on
their experience to defeat some of the
younger teams in the conference.
T ARIZONA
VW In one of the most tragic stories in col
legiate athletics, the Lady Wildcats are
mourning the loss of center Shawntice
Polk, who collapsed and died suddenly this
fall from a blood clot that moved to her
lungs. Polk, who would have been a senior
this season, was not only an outstanding
shot-blocker and rebounder, but also a team
leader. Arizona has dedicated their season
to honor their friend.
O CAL
'\^P — California, who stands at 1-1, is in the
midst of a youth movement that the
Bears hope will resurrect the program. Nei
ther the media or coaches poll predict them
to jump up in the standings, but the Bears
promise to be more competitive behind
sophomore center Jessica Lawson's 10.6
points and five rebounds per game along
with a highly touted recruiting class that in
cludes Oakland Tech graduates and Mc-
Donald's All-Americans Devanei Hampton
and Alexis Gray-Lawson.
9~| WASHINGTON STATE
— The Cougars climbed up one rung last
season and finished ninth after spend
ing three years in the conference cellar. Ju
nior forward Kate Benz is the top returning
scorer with 10.4 points. Benz led the confer
ence with 9.4 rebounds per game last year, in
one of the few bright spots last season.
1A OREGON STATE
111# Oregon State returns four starters
from last year's club, which stumbled to
only one conference win. This year the
Beavers are led by senior forward Kim But
ler and senior guard Mandy Close, who av
eraged 10.5 and 8.5 points per game, respec
tively, last season. Hie Beavers can only
hope that their stay at the bottom of the Pac
-10 will be short-lived.
