# THE 						FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Jillian Harmon #33â€”
A 6-foot-1 forward from Oregon, Harmon
is expected to bring intelligence and
quick, wise decision-making to the Car
dinal. She's an effective passer and has an excel
lent jump shot. As an inside and outside threat.

Harmon is in contention to be a starter, de-

spite her youth.

Morgan Clyburn #31
Clybum is a 6-foot-4 forward from
Texas. Her posting, consistent 3-
point shot and fast learning in the

preseason should make Clyburn a

strong presence on the team.

Rosalyn
Gold-
Onwude #23

From New York, this 5-foot-10 guard is ex
pected to bring toughness and skill to
Stanford. Gold-Onwude is a solid passer,
and jumping into the position of point guard, she
has made a smooth transition that will quickly
bring her into the Cardinal fold.
