### CHRISTIAN TORRES 
- Brooke Smith

s Pacific-10 Conference
champions and the cur
rent No. 11 team in the
country, Stanford
JL - basketball isn't
used to large deficits on the court. But,
with the loss of five graduates last year,
who combined accounted for almost
half of the team's points and rebounds,
and stixxl as leaders, the Cardinal are
looking for certain players to fill their
place.
Fortunately, sophomore Candice
Wiggins and junior Brooke Smith are
up to the challenge.
"I think we're comfortable; I think
we're ready for it," Wiggins said. "Both
of us were relatively new last year, so
that took some adjustment, but now
we're ready to step up, and I'm excited."
Wiggins and Smith have the most
game-time experience on the team as
the only starters returning this year.
"For me, even though I'm a young
player, I don't feel like it," Wiggins said.
"I think that a lot of that has to do with
[the fact that| I stepped up at a pretty
young age into a mature role, and I had
to grow up pretty fast. I don't feel like a
rookie, 1 feel like I have a lot of experi
ence."
In her fourth year of college athletics.
Smith feels the same. However, both
Wiggins and Smith bring more history
than just playing time.
Last year. Wiggins was named Pac-10
Freshman and Pac-10 Player of the
Year, as well as a Kodak All-American.
She was the team's leading scorer, aver
aging 17.5 points per game, and she led
Stanford in free throw percentage.
Smith, a junior transfer from Duke,
also earned Pac-10 honors, and led the

Cardinal in rebounds and blocks.
Both Smith and Wiggins possess a
great deal of ability, but bringing out the
abilities of the entire team is one chal
lenge they'll have as team leaders.
"I think our biggest goal this season is
to bring our team up to speed," Wiggins
said. "I think that with the two of us out
there, our game experience immediate
ly causes us to be leaders."
Smith and Wiggins were welcomed to
the Stanford team last year by the senior
class, and hope to emulate the leader
ship skills of those players this season.
"1 feel like they've left us good in
structions on how to be leaders and how
to help other players come along,"
Smith said.
Recently graduated posts T'Nae
Thiel and Azella Perryman helped
Smith come along after a year as a red
shirt at Stanford.
"I think 1 learned a lot about post de
fense, from T'Nae especially," Smith
said. "They taught me things like how to
play at this level of competition, and al
ways know what we're doing — a lot of
the intangible things. They were just
very good leaders and smart players."
Guards Kelley Suminski, Susan King
Borchardt and Sebnem Kimyacioglu
exemplified for Wiggins how to handle
oneself in the intensity of the game.
"For me personally, with the guards, I
think the biggest thing they taught me
was poise, and just playing within the
flow of the game," Wiggins said. "A lot
of times, when you haven't played a lot,
you get excited, and you have the ten
dency to do things quickly."
Wiggins will bring her wisdom and ex
perience to the court for the Cardinal,
and she accepts the responsibility.

"Now that I'm a point guard, it's defi
nitely a responsibility of just knowing
what's going on at all times, making
everyone around me feel comfortable
and getting everyone else going on the
court," Wiggins said.
Getting the team moving and pumped
will be easy for Wiggins. Her excite
ment, aggression and strong vocals are
characteristics beloved by the team.
When players were asked who was the
loudest on the team, the majority of the
responses were "Candice."
"I take that as a very strong compli
ment," Wiggins said, laughing. "I m
very glad that my teammates appreciate
my vocal abilities."
Talking is key to success on the court,
as both Wiggins and Smith pointed out.
"I think it definitely helps her [that
she's vocal,]" Smith said. "She's a point
guard, and that helps her direct. She's
like that on and off the court, so it helps
her be a more effective leader."
Smith balances out with Wiggins as
someone many of the players on the
team can turn to in quieter moments.
"I think it helps having someone you
can always trust and you can always de
pend on," Wiggins said.
Together, with their personalities
and leadership. Smith and Wiggins are
looking forward to another successful

year for the Cardinal.
"You set up your goals at the begin
ning of the year and I think coming into
it you always have things you want to ac
complish," Smith said. "Some of our
goals this year definitely include win
ning another Pac-10 Championship,
going to the Final Four and ultimately
winning the national championship."
"We also understand it goes day by
day, though, and we take each day one
at a time," Wiggins said.
For now. Smith and Wiggins will focus
on bringing the team together, turning
the wake of a deficit from graduating se
niors into an opportunity to go further
in their games.
"I think I have a long way to go indi
vidually, and we have a long way to go as
team," Smith said. "I think we're just
scratching the surface of where we hope
to be in March." ♦

ship skills of those players this season.
"1 feel like they've left us good in
structions on how to be leaders and how
to help other players come along,"
Smith said.
Recently graduated posts T'Nae
Thiel and Azella Perryman helped
Smith come along after a year as a red
shirt at Stanford.
"I think 1 learned a lot about post de
fense, from T'Nae especially," Smith
said. "They taught me things like how to
play at this level of competition, and al
ways know what we're doing — a lot of
the intangible things. They were just
very good leaders and smart players."
Guards Kelley Suminski, Susan King
Borchardt and Sebnem Kimyacioglu
exemplified for Wiggins how to handle
oneself in the intensity of the game.
"For me personally, with the guards, I
think the biggest thing they taught me
was poise, and just playing within the
flow of the game," Wiggins said. "A lot
of times, when you haven't played a lot,
you get excited, and you have the ten
dency to do things quickly."
Wiggins will bring her wisdom and ex
perience to the court for the Cardinal,
and she accepts the responsibility.

"Now that I'm a point guard, it's defi
nitely a responsibility of just knowing
what's going on at all times, making
everyone around me feel comfortable
and getting everyone else going on the
court," Wiggins said.
Getting the team moving and pumped
will be easy for Wiggins. Her excite
ment, aggression and strong vocals are
characteristics beloved by the team.
When players were asked who was the
loudest on the team, the majority of the
responses were "Candice."
"I take that as a very strong compli
ment," Wiggins said, laughing. "I m
very glad that my teammates appreciate
my vocal abilities."
Talking is key to success on the court,
as both Wiggins and Smith pointed out.
"I think it definitely helps her [that
she's vocal,]" Smith said. "She's a point
guard, and that helps her direct. She's
like that on and off the court, so it helps
her be a more effective leader."
Smith balances out with Wiggins as
someone many of the players on the
team can turn to in quieter moments.
"I think it helps having someone you
can always trust and you can always de
pend on," Wiggins said.
Together, with their personalities
and leadership. Smith and Wiggins are
looking forward to another successful

year for the Cardinal.
"You set up your goals at the begin
ning of the year and I think coming into
it you always have things you want to ac
complish," Smith said. "Some of our
goals this year definitely include win
ning another Pac-10 Championship,
going to the Final Four and ultimately
winning the national championship."
"We also understand it goes day by
day, though, and we take each day one
at a time," Wiggins said.
For now. Smith and Wiggins will focus
on bringing the team together, turning
the wake of a deficit from graduating se
niors into an opportunity to go further
in their games.
"I think I have a long way to go indi
vidually, and we have a long way to go as
team," Smith said. "I think we're just
scratching the surface of where we hope
to be in March." ♦

with the loss of five graduates last year,
who combined accounted for almost

looking for certain players to fill their

Fortunately, sophomore Candice
Wiggins and junior Brooke Smith are
up to the challenge.
"I think we're comfortable; I think
we're ready for it," Wiggins said. "Both

Wiggins and Smith have the most
game-time experience on the team as
the only starters returning this year.
"For me, even though I'm a young
player, I don't feel like it," Wiggins said.
"I think that a lot of that has to do with

Smith feels the same. However, both
Wiggins and Smith bring more history

Last year. Wiggins was named Pac-10
Freshman and Pac-10 Player of the

She was the team's leading scorer, aver
aging 17.5 points per game, and she led
Stanford in free throw percentage.
Smith, a junior transfer from Duke,
also earned Pac-10 honors, and led the

Cardinal in rebounds and blocks.
Both Smith and Wiggins possess a
great deal of ability, but bringing out the
abilities of the entire team is one chal

to bring our team up to speed," Wiggins
said. "I think that with the two of us out
