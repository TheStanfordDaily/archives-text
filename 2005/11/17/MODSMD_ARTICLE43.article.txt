# IMPORTANT GAMES TO WATCH
## 
### 
Nov. 27 at Texas Tech
The Cardinal leads the all-time series 7-4, having
won last season after two previous losses. The Lady
Raiders made it to their regional semifinal in last
year's NCAA Tournament.
Dec. 4 vs. Tennessee
The No. 2 Lady Vols currently lead their series with
Stanford, having won the past nine matches. They
came from behind to beat the Cardinal 70-67 last
year on their home floor. Tennessee also competed
in last year's Final Four, so Stanford will have to prove
itself in Maples Pavilion if it is to reach the same
heights in the postseason.
Dec. 30 vs. Southern California
The Cardinal defeated the Trojans last year in the
Pac-10 tournament with a close 73-69 in the semifi
nals. USC returns looking for redemption, ranked
No. 3 in pre-season media polls for the Pac-10.
Jan. 1 vs. Ucla
Stanford has a 13-game winning streak against the
Bruins, but with two pre-season AII-Pac-10 Team
members, Nikki Blue and Noelle Quinn, this year's
UCLA squad could prove a greater challenge. UCLA
is also ranked second to Stanford in preseason media
polls.
Jan. 21 vs. Arizona State
The Sun Devils lost to Stanford in last season's Pac
-10 tournament championship, 56-42. They were
also the only other Pac-10 team to advance past the
NCAA second round, losing in the regional semifi
nals.
