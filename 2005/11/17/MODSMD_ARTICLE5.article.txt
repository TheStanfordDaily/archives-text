# STUDENT GROUPS
## GSC cooks up diversity 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
Diversity Committee and the Grad
uate Student Council (GSC) both
held their regular meetings last
night at the Graduate Community
Center. The latter discussed the up
coming GSC Thanksgiving Dinner
and GSC cooking classes and ap
proved funding requests from four
student groups.
The Diversity Committee, meet
ing directly before the regular GSC
meeting, focused on the impending
release of the Commission on
Graduate Education (CGE) re
port. Hoping to increase the num
ber of women and underrepresent
ed ethnic minorities in the Univer
sity's graduate programs, members
of the Diversity Committee said
they believe that the CGE should
result in a strong push for signifi-
cant gains in these areas. Committee
members said they hoped they would
have input in any developments that
occur after the report's release. Accord
ing to mechanical engineering student
Cullen Buie, the CGE will likely be pre
sented at the Dec. 1 meeting of the Fac
ulty Senate.
The GSC, meeting after the Diversity
Committee, called its first round of grad
uate cooking classes held last Sunday a
rousing success.

The event was designed to help gradu
ate students socialize among different de
partments. Students from all schools and
departments formed three groups to cook
together. Over 50 students applied ap
plied to participate and 27 of them at
tended.
GSC councilmember Tracy Terry, a
graduate student in chemistry also on
the Diversity Committee, led one of the
cooking teams and said she was happy
with how the event turned out.
"There was a nice cross-section from
different departments," she said. "There
was also a good representation of both
men and women."
Terry added that the three groups
made delicious dishes like Caesar salad.

lasagna. bruschetta and chicken alfredo,
and she encouraged more students to
participate in the next round of cooking
classes.
"These classes will be held again next
quarter," she said. "Applications can be
found on the GSC Web site."
The GSC also discussed the eighth
annual Thanksgiving Dinner, to be held
Thursday, Nov. 24 at Wilbur Dining Hall.
There are currently two scheduled eat
ing times for 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., but GSC
Councilmember Hannah Scherer, from
the School of Earth Sciences, said the
number of eating times is subject to
change.
"We budgeted for 1,500 people and
that is already full," Scherer said. "Peo

pie can still register and we can add a
seating if we need to."
She added that the high registration
numbers were due to thorough publicity
efforts, attributing the strong undergrad
uate RSVP rates to GSC intern Cassidy
Vuong, a freshman.
"We had really good efforts with pub
licity that got the word out," Scherer
said.
Also, during the meeting, the GSC
unanimously approved funds for the
Hindu Students Council, C.U.L.T.U.R.E.
— a group of students associated with
the Department of Cultural and Social
Anthropology — the Romanian Student
Association (RSA) and, after much de
liberation, the Redwood Outdoor Club.
