## The 						Interview 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
The Daily recently sat down
with men's basketball head coach
Trent Johnson as he and the Cardi
nal ready themselves for this week
end's season opener. Read on for
his thoughts on Chris Hernandez's
heart, the Sixth Man Club, Stanford
academics on the court and his ex
pectations for his second year as
head coach.
The Daily: After a 6-7 start last
year, your squad fought through
key injuries to win 12 of 17 down
the stretch before losing in the
NCAA Tournament's first round.
What stands out most to you?
Trent Johnson: rhere were a group of
guys and a staff that someway, some
how managed to stay competitive.The
players should lie complimented, be
cause they were very resilient. This
basketball program last year probably
went through as much of a change as
anywhere in the country, and for these
guys to continue to compete and be
lieve they could win. I felt speaks vol
umes for them. If we were completely
healthy last year, who knows where
we could have ended up.
TD: What are Chris Hernandez's
strengths, and what role do you
want him to fill this year?
77: Chris' strengths are his leader
ship qualities, his toughness and his

shooting...Sometimes I think we
put too much stock in a guy being
athletic, quick, strong, all those
things, and of course there's a lot of
players throughout the country that
are probably blessed with more
physical attributes than Chris, but
what makes Chris special is inside
his head, inside his heart. Of any
one player in the country, he de
serves to enjoy his senior year. I
want him to relax and just play.

Trent Johnson paces the sideline. He enters his second year as head coach of the Cardinal after
posting a 18-13 record last season.
Johnson discusses admissions standards

He does not have to bear the bur
den of being the sole leader of this
team, because there are three other
seniors. But make no mistake about it,
when the game's in the balance, when
there's crucial parts of the game. Chris
is going to have the ball in his hands.
TD: Let's talk about the other seniors.
[Guard] Jason Haas stepped up last
season, and [forward] Matt Haryasz
and [guard] Dan Grunfeld are two
All-Pac-10 players.
TJ: Jason Haas is one of the more un
derappreciated basketball players on
our team, except by the coaches. He's
the most unselfish player you've ever
been around.
We're going to be very, very care
ful with Danny and bring him along
slowly. Our first exhibition game, we
were excited as a staff and his team
mates to see him back on the floor
doing some of the things he did in the
past. But we don't want to compare
this year to last year even if he was
completely healthy.
Consistency is the key for Matt.
He's a little banged up, he is playing
with plantar fasciitis and we're being
awfully careful with him too. His foot
flared up on him this summer, and we
want to get it under control to where
hopefully by league play [Dec. 29],
he's able to play pain-free.
TD: What are the areas you think the
team needs the most work on heading
into the season?
TJ: Without question, we've got to get
better defensively than we were last
year because, my goodness, our
ieague is extremely challenging.
We've got to rebound the ball better
than we did last year, and we've got to
take care of the ball better. Last year,
our assist-to-turnover ratio was not
very good, and defensively, it wasn't a
solid Stanford team of the past. We
have to do a better job putting ball
pressure on perimeter players when
they have it on the wing, and we have
to do better with post defense.
TD: During a basketball game, it's im
possible to watch every single player

at every single moment, so what do
you try to focus on?
TJ: My big emphasis is seeing the
whole picture. Instead of dwelling on
any one individual at any specific time
during the course of the game, I worry
about the flow of the game, clock man
agement. I don't watch for effort as
much as mental breakdowns...That's
my emphasis as opposed to worrying
about any individual guy not playing
well. Well, we'll get the next guy in. sit
him down, talk to him and go from
there. Coaching's done during the
week; during the game it's about ad
justments. If you see a coach having to
draw up a play every 20 seconds,
something's wrong there.

"If you see a coach having to
draw up a play every 20
seconds, something s wrong."
TRENT JOHNSON

When you've been around the
game of basketball as long as I have,
you're able to see things I think a lot
of people wouldn't see. As loud as it
gets in Maples, as loud as it gets in
places like Arizona, 1 never hear the
crowd. I can speak at this tone, and
Mitch or Chris can be thirty feet away,
and they can hear me.
TD: You come to Stanford from
Nevada, where you took a lower
seeded team deep into the tourna
ment. Stanford over those same years
has often been knocked out early as a
higher seed. Do you prepare for those
games differently than you would in
any other month?
TJ: It's nothing different in terms of
what happens in March and what
happens in October or November —
I think a big emphasis is treating

every game, treating every practice,
like it could be our last. The bottom
line for me and our program is if
there's any key to being successful in
March, it's worrying about it from Oc
tober until March every day, and not
[looking ahead], because if you do,
you're going to get beat by Cal Irvine.
USF.CaI Poly.
TD: You mentioned not to take the
Tournament out of focus, but at the
same time. I can't help but notice you
have laminated copies of newspaper
recaps of the Mississippi State loss [in
last year's first round] on your desk...
TJ: ...And I'm glad you brought that
up. because the guys have it on their
workout program.The message is not

that it was one-and-done, but that
you're only as good as your last game.
It talks about playing our best 15 min
utes against Mississippi State, and
then our worst 15 minutes. That loss
was a microcosm of our season in
terms of our lack of consistency, and I
want these guys to remember the
feeling they had.
Everyone says it was a good year,
but was it? I don't know. Everyone
talks about all the injuries we had.
Well, everyone goes through injuries.
Its laminated on my desk not because
of the Tournament, but because of
how we played at the tail-end of the
year.
TD: How do Stanford's academics
make coaching here different?
TJ: [Players] hide a lot of coaching
deficiencies because they're bright

people and they understand.
There's a negative to that. Some
times they try to over-analyze
things; you're not in Econ class.
You're not trying to invent the
moon. You defend, rebound and
take care of the ball, and you're
going to have a pretty good chance.
TD: What about [admissions stan
dards' effects on] recruiting?
TJ: Our recruiting pool is smaller
than lot of other places', but I don't
worry about that.The positive out of
it is you know what you get. and it's
pretty evident it's been successful
over the years. Is there pressure to
get the one or two top guys? I Jnfor
tunately, we're in a situation recruit
ing-wise where if a guy like Casey Ja
cobson, Curtis Borchardt or Josh
Childress leaves early, we can't go
out, recruit and replace those guys.
There are not very many guys flint
play at that level in the country that
can get into school here, so I hope
our fan base and our alums under
stand that.
If Josh Childress didn't decide to
leave early, who knows how good tlm
team would have been last year. Of
this '(Hi class, there were probably Id
kids in the country that play at a high
level who potentially could get into
school here.Ten.
TD: Is there anything in particular
you would like to see out of Sixth Man
this year?
TJ: You can stack our Sixth Man up
anywhere — the Cameron Crazies. I
don't care. It's just a different level,
and what I like is their wit. along w itli
their excitement.
TD: Arc you looking for some wit
from Sixth Man this year?
TJ: It's funny.you know. I don't notice
that stuff until I review the tape be
cause I'm so locked in. I'm pretty sure
you see my little deal on the sideline.
I'm always pacing. But then when I go
back and watch the videotape, it's
nice to see the students are having
fun, and that's what's so exciting and
so special about Stanford.


NOAH HAWTHORNE/The Stanford Daily
Cardinal men's basketball coach Trent Johnson finds the Stanford Sixth Man Club full of wit that is not found at other collegiate basketball student groups. He
doesn't notice it much during the game, he says, but the tapes he analyzes afterwards make him smile.
