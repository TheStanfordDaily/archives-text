## Students left out of special election 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
The disappointment every Stanford student feels when
faced with an empty P.O. Box was multiplied last week as
many did not receive the absentee ballots they requested for
the California Special Election in time to have their votes
count. Sophomore Tom McFadden was one such student.
"I decided to vote absentee because I wanted to be able
to vote for my own local issues even though I'm not living
at home," said McFadden. "I received my absentee ballot
the day after the election."
Although McFadden was seriously planning on voting,
he did not consider it a huge loss that he got his ballot late.
"When I didn't receive my absentee ballot, I felt angry
and guilty for not voting, but my disillusionment with the
entire initiative process lulled me into inaction," he said."l
hate the initiative process — I think it is inappropriate and
dangerous for the mass public to make legislation and
complicated issues. I therefore did not pay much attention
to the election in general."
McFadden's delayed ballot has also discouraged him
from voting absentee in future elections.
"I found myself wishing I could simply go to a polling
place and vote.but 1 didn't think I could because I was reg-
Voters should track their ballots, county says

istered in a different county," he said.
Sophomore Desiree Fabunan had
a similar reaction when she too failed
to receive an absentee ballot.
"It makes me apathetic toward
voting at all because this is the sec
ond time it has happened to me," she
said. "The first time was with the
presidential election. I don't know if
I will really be voting seriously in the
future."
Sophomore Royce Cheng also
encountered problems with absentee
ballots during the presidential elec
tion last year, in addition to this
year's special election.
"Come next election, I'm going to
re-register for Santa Clara County,"
Cheng said. "Democracy doesn't
work if you don't get a ballot."
Neither Fabunan nor Cheng com
plained to anyone about their miss
ing ballots.
"I had intended to take it a step
further, but I didn't feel so strongly
about any of the propositions that I'd
feel cheated if my vote were not rep
resented," Cheng said.
Fabunan had already studied up
on the propositions, but did not com
plain because she felt it would not
make a difference.
"Our post office is notorious for
not putting out stuff on time, [so) 1

felt it would be a lost cause," she said.
Senior Natasha Chen said she was
committed to voting on Proposition
73, but believes she did not receive a
ballot because she was studying
abroad last year during the elections.
"I'm a senior, and I've received [a
ballot] every year," Chen said.
"There's a chance there could have
been confusion because last year I
was abroad and they sent it to Ox
ford, but 1 clearly told them it was
only for that election."
Problems with absentee ballots
do not appear to occur solely in Cali
fornia, however. Sophomore John
Maas decided to vote absentee in the
presidential election of last year be
cause his home state of Wisconsin
was a swing state.
"The ballot didn't come until the
week before the election," Maas said.
"As far as I can remember, I mailed it
back the day it came, or at the very
latest the day after. But when I went
home for winter break, the village
clerk told me that the ballot had not
arrived in time and that she was
sorry. 1 had heard nothing of this."
Maas said he decided not to com
plain because he was unsure of who
to hold responsible for the delay.
"I didn't know who to complain
to, quite frankly," he said. "Is it the

post office's fault? Certainly the
problem wasn't in a specific branch,
but rather a flaw in the system as a
whole."
In the latest election, Maas decid
ed to not vote absentee.
"This year for the California Spe
cial Election. I voted at the polling
station after reregistering in Califor
nia," he said."lt was fast and conven
ient, and I knew I would be responsi
ble enough to get to the polls, so why
risk the mail system which failed me
last year?"
According to Diane Jones, voter
services manager for Sacramento
County, the voter-registration offices
make every effort to ensure that peo
ple receive their absentee ballots
well before Election Day.
"We begin 60 days before the
election when we mail out absentee
ballots to voters overseas," Jones
said. "We then start mailing ballots to
permanent absentee voters 29 days
before the election. The last day we
mail out absentee ballots is seven
days before the election. In between
29 days and a week before the elec
tion, we are mailing ballots every day,
just as soon as we get the requests."
Jones stressed that voters often
do not follow up enough when they
have not received their absentee

ballots.
"It is the voter's responsibility to
check on the status of their ballot,"
she said. "If you haven't gotten one
yet and it is less than a week before
the election, you should call or e-mail
the voter-registration office in the
county that you are registered and in
quire about it."
Jones said it is often the procrasti
nation of voters that leads to prob
lems.
"Many people wait until the very
last day to register, which creates a
huge stress on our office," she said.
"Then if there is any sort of problem
with the mail, they get the ballot
late."
Jones recommends that in order
for voters to avoid problems with ab
sentee ballots in future elections,
they should either register as a per
manent absentee voter or get their
absentee-ballot request forms in as
early as possible.
"Alternately, if you get the ballot
on the day of the election, you can fill
it out and turn it in at any polling
place," she said. "You can also go to
the polling place, surrender your ab
sentee ballot and vote at the polls.
Or, if you haven't received a ballot
yet at all. you may vote at the polls on
a provisional ballot, which will be

held until officials have verified that
you have not voted absentee also."
Jones also said that voters may
submit an official complaint by writ
ing to their county registrar of voters.
They should include their name, ad
dress and date that they received
their ballot. All contact information
for county registrars is available on
the California Secretary of State's
Web site.

on the day of the election, you can fill
it out and turn it in at any polling
place," she said. "You can also go to
the polling place, surrender your ab
sentee ballot and vote at the polls.
Or, if you haven't received a ballot
yet at all. you may vote at the polls on
a provisional ballot, which will be

held until officials have verified that
you have not voted absentee also."
Jones also said that voters may
submit an official complaint by writ
ing to their county registrar of voters.
They should include their name, ad
dress and date that they received
their ballot. All contact information
for county registrars is available on
the California Secretary of State's

The disappointment every Stanford student feels when
faced with an empty P.O. Box was multiplied last week as
many did not receive the absentee ballots they requested for
the California Special Election in time to have their votes
count. Sophomore Tom McFadden was one such student.
"I decided to vote absentee because I wanted to be able
to vote for my own local issues even though I'm not living
at home," said McFadden. "I received my absentee ballot
the day after the election."
Although McFadden was seriously planning on voting,
he did not consider it a huge loss that he got his ballot late.
"When I didn't receive my absentee ballot, I felt angry
and guilty for not voting, but my disillusionment with the
entire initiative process lulled me into inaction," he said."l

dangerous for the mass public to make legislation and
complicated issues. I therefore did not pay much attention
to the election in general."
McFadden's delayed ballot has also discouraged him
from voting absentee in future elections.
"I found myself wishing I could simply go to a polling
place and vote.but 1 didn't think I could because I was reg-
Voters should track their ballots, county says

istered in a different county," he said.
Sophomore Desiree Fabunan had
a similar reaction when she too failed
to receive an absentee ballot.
"It makes me apathetic toward
voting at all because this is the sec
ond time it has happened to me," she
said. "The first time was with the
presidential election. I don't know if
I will really be voting seriously in the
future."
Sophomore Royce Cheng also
encountered problems with absentee
ballots during the presidential elec
tion last year, in addition to this
year's special election.
"Come next election, I'm going to
re-register for Santa Clara County,"
Cheng said. "Democracy doesn't
work if you don't get a ballot."
Neither Fabunan nor Cheng com
plained to anyone about their miss
ing ballots.
"I had intended to take it a step
further, but I didn't feel so strongly
about any of the propositions that I'd
feel cheated if my vote were not rep
resented," Cheng said.
Fabunan had already studied up
on the propositions, but did not com
plain because she felt it would not
make a difference.
"Our post office is notorious for
not putting out stuff on time, [so) 1

felt it would be a lost cause," she said.
Senior Natasha Chen said she was
committed to voting on Proposition
73, but believes she did not receive a
ballot because she was studying
abroad last year during the elections.
"I'm a senior, and I've received [a
ballot] every year," Chen said.
"There's a chance there could have
been confusion because last year I
was abroad and they sent it to Ox
ford, but 1 clearly told them it was
only for that election."
Problems with absentee ballots
do not appear to occur solely in Cali
fornia, however. Sophomore John
Maas decided to vote absentee in the
presidential election of last year be
cause his home state of Wisconsin
was a swing state.
"The ballot didn't come until the
week before the election," Maas said.
"As far as I can remember, I mailed it
back the day it came, or at the very
latest the day after. But when I went
home for winter break, the village
clerk told me that the ballot had not
arrived in time and that she was
sorry. 1 had heard nothing of this."
Maas said he decided not to com
plain because he was unsure of who
to hold responsible for the delay.
"I didn't know who to complain
to, quite frankly," he said. "Is it the

post office's fault? Certainly the
problem wasn't in a specific branch,
but rather a flaw in the system as a
whole."
In the latest election, Maas decid
ed to not vote absentee.
"This year for the California Spe
cial Election. I voted at the polling
station after reregistering in Califor
nia," he said."lt was fast and conven
ient, and I knew I would be responsi
ble enough to get to the polls, so why
risk the mail system which failed me
last year?"
According to Diane Jones, voter
services manager for Sacramento
County, the voter-registration offices
make every effort to ensure that peo
ple receive their absentee ballots
well before Election Day.
"We begin 60 days before the
election when we mail out absentee
ballots to voters overseas," Jones
said. "We then start mailing ballots to
permanent absentee voters 29 days
before the election. The last day we
mail out absentee ballots is seven
days before the election. In between
29 days and a week before the elec
tion, we are mailing ballots every day,
just as soon as we get the requests."
Jones stressed that voters often
do not follow up enough when they
have not received their absentee

ballots.
"It is the voter's responsibility to
check on the status of their ballot,"
she said. "If you haven't gotten one
yet and it is less than a week before
the election, you should call or e-mail
the voter-registration office in the
county that you are registered and in
quire about it."
Jones said it is often the procrasti
nation of voters that leads to prob
lems.
"Many people wait until the very
last day to register, which creates a
huge stress on our office," she said.
"Then if there is any sort of problem
with the mail, they get the ballot
late."
Jones recommends that in order
for voters to avoid problems with ab
sentee ballots in future elections,
they should either register as a per
manent absentee voter or get their
absentee-ballot request forms in as
early as possible.
"Alternately, if you get the ballot
on the day of the election, you can fill
it out and turn it in at any polling
place," she said. "You can also go to
the polling place, surrender your ab
