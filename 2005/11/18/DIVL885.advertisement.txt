The End
of Oil?
For much of the past two centuries, modern society has prospered due to the steady supply of
cheap, abundant oil. In the past several months, oil prices have skyrocketed and the future of
supplies is again of great concern. In this lecture, we will learn about oil as a vital commodity,
how it formed, and where it occurs, and two experts will present differing perspectives on how
much oil is left and what the future holds.
