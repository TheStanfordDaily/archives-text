It's a fact that many fire deaths
are caused by people attempting
to cook or smoke while under the influence of alcohol.
There's more to responsible drinking
taking a cab. Don't put yourself—
or your family— at risk to fire.
Dear members and friends of the Cal an J St.iiiTord comiituntfies:
On Saturday, November 19, the C"al Bears and Stanford Cardinal will play the 1.08"' annual
Big Game at Stanford Stadium. Big Game is a tradition-laden event, and our spirited rivalry
has become one of the most storied in all of collegiate football.
We ask that you do your part in maintaining Big C lame as an enjoyable experience for all
Unfortunately, some of the past Big Gaines have been diminished by the behavior of .1 few
people, whose actions have resulted in property damage and injuries. Such behavior is
unfortunate and demeans the strong athletic and academic heritage C'al and Stanford share.
We ask that all members of our respective communities refrain from engaging in mean
spirited "pranks," excessive drinking and other activities that may draw law enforcement,
security personnel and resources away from responding to more pressing matters. Please
discourage these activities among others. I hose attending the Big C lame, including families
with small children and elderly alumni, should not have to fear for their safety. I et's instead
encourage a Big Game culture based on lively competition, team loyalty and fun.
You should know that fans who engage in incidents of field trespass, physical assault and/or
property damage will be ejected from the stadium and may be arrested.
Please respect the Big Game tradition and celebrate your school spirit, pride and
sportsmanship in a safe, positive and friendly manner. Enjoy the game!
Sincerely,
Robert Birgoneou
