Getting Back To Basics
Recycling is really just common sense, and until the
"modern era," it was a common household activity.
Before the 19205, 70% of II.S. cities rati programs to recy
cle certain materials. During World
War 11, industry recycled and reused
about 25% of the waste stream.
Because of concern for the environ
ment, recycling is again on the
upswing. The nation's composting j&r
and recycling rate rose from 7.7% of
the waste stream in 1960 to 17% in
1990. It's currently up to around ■||
30%. California is at about 48%.
The Garbage Crisis
The world has changed a lot in the past century. From
individually packaged food servings to disposable diapers,
more garbage is generated now than ever before. The aver

Recycling - An Important Part Of
The Solution
The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our
landfills and incineration plants. By
reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics,
and other materials, we can save produc
tion and energy costs, and reduce the neg
ative impacts that the extraction and pro
cessing of virgin materials has on the envi
ronment.
It all comes back to you.
Recycling gets down to one person taking
action. New products can be made from your recyclable
waste material. Recycling is good for our environment,
our communities, and our economy.
