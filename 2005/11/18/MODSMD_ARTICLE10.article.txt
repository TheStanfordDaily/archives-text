## Practice field chosen as Commencement site 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, University President John
Hennessy announced via e-mail to the Class
of 2006 and their parents that this year's Uni
versity-wide graduation ceremonies will be
held at the football practice field, not at Frost
Amphitheater as was originally planned.
Hennessy's letter came after University
administrators received approximately 750
responses from various seniors and their par
ents expressing their preferences for the site
of this year's Commencement exercises.
These responses were in reaction to an

Oct. 26 letter from Hennessy to seniors and
their parents which proposed three sites —
the football practice field. Frost Amphithe
ater, and Roble field — as potential locations
for this year's graduation ceremony, which
cannot be held in Stanford Stadium due to
renovations that will be taking place next
June. That letter also encouraged students
and their parents to submit their preferences
for this year's site.
Yesterday's letter stated that the foot
ball practice field "was favored by nearly
three-quarters of respondents and by a
roughly equal ratio of both students and
their parents."

Of the three proposed sites, the football
practice field can accommodate the greatest
number of people, and each graduate will be
able to invite nine guests to the graduation
ceremonies.
In previous years, when Commencement
was held in Stanford Stadium, graduates
were allowed to invite up to 50 guests. But
with limited seating this year, the University
plans on setting up a ticket exchange system
whereby students who do not need their full
allotment of tickets will be able to redistrib
ute them to those who want to invite more
than nine guests.
Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to the presi

dent, explained that while University admin
istrators have not yet hammered out the de
tails of the exchange program, they will work
with the senior class presidents to set up a fair
system in which all extra tickets will be col
lected and then re-allotted according to de
mand.
He also explained that most students will
likely not need all nine invitations.
"Last year, each student had an average
of six guests, so for most students the allotted
tickets will he more than sufficient," he said.
"There should be plenty of extra tickets for
