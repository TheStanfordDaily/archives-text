## Practice field chosen as Commencement site 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, University President John
Hennessy announced via e-mail to the Class
of 2006 and their parents that this year's Uni
versity-wide graduation ceremonies will be
held at the football practice field, not at Frost
Amphitheater as was originally planned.
Hennessy's letter came after University
administrators received approximately 750
responses from various seniors and their par
ents expressing their preferences for the site
of this year's Commencement exercises.
These responses were in reaction to an

Oct. 26 letter from Hennessy to seniors and
their parents which proposed three sites —
the football practice field. Frost Amphithe
ater, and Roble field — as potential locations
for this year's graduation ceremony, which
cannot be held in Stanford Stadium due to
renovations that will be taking place next
June. That letter also encouraged students
and their parents to submit their preferences
for this year's site.
Yesterday's letter stated that the foot
ball practice field "was favored by nearly
three-quarters of respondents and by a
roughly equal ratio of both students and
their parents."

Of the three proposed sites, the football
practice field can accommodate the greatest
number of people, and each graduate will be
able to invite nine guests to the graduation
ceremonies.
In previous years, when Commencement
was held in Stanford Stadium, graduates
were allowed to invite up to 50 guests. But
with limited seating this year, the University
plans on setting up a ticket exchange system
whereby students who do not need their full
allotment of tickets will be able to redistrib
ute them to those who want to invite more
than nine guests.
Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to the presi

dent, explained that while University admin
istrators have not yet hammered out the de
tails of the exchange program, they will work
with the senior class presidents to set up a fair
system in which all extra tickets will be col
lected and then re-allotted according to de
mand.
He also explained that most students will
likely not need all nine invitations.
"Last year, each student had an average
of six guests, so for most students the allotted
tickets will he more than sufficient," he said.
"There should be plenty of extra tickets for
students who want to invite more
guests."
Students, like senior Jennifer Lee,
have responded positively to this
proposed ticket exchange program.
"I think it's great that there will
be a system to redistribute extra
tickets," Lee said. "I know I for one
would be more than happy to give up
any extras I might have."
Hennessy's letter went on to de
scribe the logistics of the cere
monies. Folding chairs will be set up
on the practice field, the raised stage
from previous ceremonies will still
be used and two Jumbotron-style
screens will be set up to enhance
viewing.
In addition, indoor seating for
guests who prefer alternate accom
modations will be available at a
nearby site with a video feed of the
ceremony, according to the letter. Fi
nally, guests will be able to use the
parking lots at Stanford Stadium and
walk the short distance to the prac
tice field.
Wachtel explained that parking
was one of the main concerns that
went into selecting this year's site.
"One of the things that was more
appealing to us about the football
practice field site was the fact that
we could use the football stadium
parking lots," he said. "With the
graduate and undergraduate cere

monies split up, there should be
more than enough parking for
everyone."
With regard to expenses, Wach
tel explained that the costs of Frost
and the football practice field are
"probably comparable," but he went
on to explain that money was never
an issue in the decision process.
He also expressed gratification to
the students and parents who re
sponded to Hennessy's Oct. 26 let
ter, and he assured graduates that
this year's ceremonies will go
smoothly.
"We're glad that people respond
ed to the president's message," he
said. "And we hope that people are
happy and looking forward to what
promises to be a great graduation."
Students expressed their thanks
to University administrators for lis
tening to their suggestions.
"1 think it's a great solution," Lee
said. "1 appreciate the administra
tion's time and effort in listening to
the opinions of the senior class and
our parents."
Senior class presidents Shyam
Ravindran, James Mitchell, Pamela
Kum and Kevin Gao agreed.
"We think this is a great out
come," they wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "The University heard
the concerns of students and parents
after the initial decision, sought
feedback on new venues, and
reached a decision that clearly has
the popular support of students and
parents. They went the extra mile for
graduating students and should be
thanked by all of us for that."
