# STUDENT LIFE
## Students buy more tickets for Big Game 
### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Penetrate, penetrate! Score,score!"
Whether this cheer from the Stanford student
section will be heard across the stadium at Big
Game tomorrow depends in large part on how
many students show up to the game. However, the
Cardinal are off to a good start, with 2,330 student
tickets sold as of press time, and more than 2,500
tickets are expected to be sold by Saturday.
This total has already surpassed the 1,950 stu
dent tickets that were sold two years ago. Some of
the increase can be attributed to successful ticket
sales in White Plaza, increased odds for victory and
more perceived student spirit surrounding the an
nual faceoff.
"The Big Game is always good, but this year,
with the improved play of the team, the new stadi
um on the horizon and the importance of the game
regarding bowl ramifications, there is more excite
ment than the last Big Game," said Bob Carruesco,
director of marketing and ticket sales for Stanford
Athletics." It is always an added plus when the stu
dent body really gets into it."
But Stanford's chances of maintaining an ob
servable home court advantage are dwindling,
with 37.000 Cal tickets already purchased, com
pared to Stanford's 26.000, according to Car
ruesco.
Another reason for the increased
student participation might be the
lowered ticket prices, falling from
$60 two years ago to $40 this year for
the All-Axess pass.
"I almost didn't want to go be
cause the ticket price is really high,"
said senior David Post, who missed
the game two years ago. "More stu
dents would go if it were cheaper.
But I decided to go because I think
we have a chance this year, and I'm
excited about tailgating. Since I'm a
senior. I'd hate to miss out on a win,
and it's a Stanford tradition."

This is the first year tickets are
being sold in White Plaza, according
to Krista Zizzo, director of outreach
and assessment in the Freshman
Dean's Office. The Big Game Com
mittee thought that if football tickets
were sold in White Plaza, students
could purchase them more easily.
The Ticket Office agreed to let the
Athletics Marketing team sell tickets
in White Plaza from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
There were 60 tickets sold outside
yesterday, and 150 total sold in the
last three days.
The Big Game Committee also
wants to turn the student section into
a "sea of red," requesting all RAs to
order red or cardinal Big Game
shirts for their houses. ITie official
"Red Zone" student section shirts
will also be available from 2 p.m. to

4:30 p.m. to all students with tickets.
"Student response has been
great," said junior Troy Steinmetz,
student chair of the Big Game Com
mittee. "It seems that there's been a
tangible difference this year in the
hype for Big Game. People are wear
ing red and attitude seems to have
changed. If given a nudge, students
will show their school spirit."
The week of planned Big Game
events has also been noticeably more
successful this year than last. On
Iliesday, the Class of 2007's "Beat-A-
Bear" giveaway saw 350 bears
given out in less than two hours. It
was supposed to be a two-day event,
but they gave all of the bears away
before the end of the first day. In con
trast. last year only 200 bears were
distributed, according to Zizzo.

Bear" giveaway saw 350 bears
given out in less than two hours. It
was supposed to be a two-day event,
but they gave all of the bears away
before the end of the first day. In con
