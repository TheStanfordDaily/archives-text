## Students buy more tickets for Big Game

"Penetrate, penetrate! Score,score!"
Whether this cheer from the Stanford student
section will be heard across the stadium at Big
Game tomorrow depends in large part on how
many students show up to the game. However, the
Cardinal are off to a good start, with 2,330 student
tickets sold as of press time, and more than 2,500
tickets are expected to be sold by Saturday.
This total has already surpassed the 1,950 stu
dent tickets that were sold two years ago. Some of
the increase can be attributed to successful ticket
sales in White Plaza, increased odds for victory and
more perceived student spirit surrounding the an
nual faceoff.
"The Big Game is always good, but this year,
with the improved play of the team, the new stadi
um on the horizon and the importance of the game
regarding bowl ramifications, there is more excite
ment than the last Big Game," said Bob Carruesco,
director of marketing and ticket sales for Stanford
Athletics." It is always an added plus when the stu
dent body really gets into it."
But Stanford's chances of maintaining an ob
servable home court advantage are dwindling,
with 37.000 Cal tickets already purchased, com
pared to Stanford's 26.000, according to Car
ruesco.
