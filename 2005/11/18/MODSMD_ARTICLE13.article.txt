## Early Action applications up this year 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
For high school seniors across the
nation, Nov. 1 marked the deadline for
early application to their dream
schools. Nearly 4.400 of those applica
tions ended up at the Bakewell Build
ing. the new home of Stanford's Office
of Undergraduate Admission and Fi
nancial Aid.
Richard Shaw, recently appointed as
Stanford's dean of admission and finan
cial aid. said in an interview with The
Daily that though it is too early to com
mit to exact figures, "it is clear this
year's number of applicants is ahead of
last year."
For the Class of 2009. Stanford re
ceived 4,321 applications under its non
binding, Early Action plan. Shaw said
his office has already received approxi
mately 30 more completed applications
than last year.
He also noted that there are 265 ap
plications that are incomplete, and
therefore have yet to be evaluated or
added to any totals.
The Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission has not yet started sorting the
applicants by geography, sex,education
al background or any other criteria,
Shaw said.
The office has also not begun to com
pile an official or final number of appli
cants because it is still early in the eval
uation process.
"We know we are relatively close to
last year's final count," Shaw said. "We
are expecting an increase of about 1 to 4
percent."
Shaw added that depending on how
many of the incomplete applications are
ultimately finished, the jump might be
as high as 6 percent.
"We are not talking about a 15 or 20
percent increase," said Shaw. "But we
are looking at good, solid, stable num
bers."
The Harvard Crimson reported yes
terday that Harvard University re
ceived approximately 4,000 applica
tions for Early Admission, approxi
mately a 5 percent decline compared to
their previous year's total of 4.214. Har-
