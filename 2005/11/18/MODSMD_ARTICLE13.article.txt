## Early Action applications up this year 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM 
For high school seniors across the
nation, Nov. 1 marked the deadline for
early application to their dream
schools. Nearly 4.400 of those applica
tions ended up at the Bakewell Build
ing. the new home of Stanford's Office
of Undergraduate Admission and Fi
nancial Aid.
Richard Shaw, recently appointed as
Stanford's dean of admission and finan
cial aid. said in an interview with The
Daily that though it is too early to com
mit to exact figures, "it is clear this
year's number of applicants is ahead of
last year."
For the Class of 2009. Stanford re
ceived 4,321 applications under its non
binding, Early Action plan. Shaw said
his office has already received approxi
mately 30 more completed applications
than last year.
He also noted that there are 265 ap
plications that are incomplete, and
therefore have yet to be evaluated or
added to any totals.
The Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission has not yet started sorting the
applicants by geography, sex,education
al background or any other criteria,
Shaw said.
The office has also not begun to com
pile an official or final number of appli
cants because it is still early in the eval
uation process.
"We know we are relatively close to
last year's final count," Shaw said. "We
are expecting an increase of about 1 to 4
percent."
Shaw added that depending on how
many of the incomplete applications are
ultimately finished, the jump might be
as high as 6 percent.
"We are not talking about a 15 or 20
percent increase," said Shaw. "But we
are looking at good, solid, stable num
bers."
The Harvard Crimson reported yes
terday that Harvard University re
ceived approximately 4,000 applica
tions for Early Admission, approxi
mately a 5 percent decline compared to
their previous year's total of 4.214. Har-
vard Admissions refused to specify
the exact number of applications for
the Class of 2010, stating that it was
premature to release the statistics to
The Daily.
Admission officers at Columbia,
Duke, Princeton and Yale were not
immediately available for comment.
Stanford admission operates
under the Single Choice Early Ac
tion (SCEA) plan, a system favored
by many peer institutions such as
Harvard and Yale. Under this sys
tem, students who choose to apply
early to Stanford may not apply
early to any other university. How
ever, if accepted, students are not
bound to that decision and may elect
to apply to other universities for reg
ular review.
Two years ago, Stanford moved
away from Early Decision, a system
whereby students were bound by
their application to attend if accept
ed. The move to SCEA "basically
doubled the number of early appli
cants," Shaw explained. The in
creased flexibility and removal of
the binding clause lured many more
students.
Shaw, who previously worked as
the dean of admission at Yale, said he
saw a similar shift in the number of
applications the year Yale changed
its policy.
Early application is a popular op
tion for students, offering them the
chance to show their commitment to
Stanford, he explained.
Additionally, many foreign stu
dents appreciate the Early Action
program. British universities also

evaluate applications on a time
schedule closer to the early sched
ule.
"If I hadn't gotten in early, I
wouldn't have come here," ex
plained freshman Tim Lim, who
completed his high school studies in
England and applied to colleges
both in the United States and the
United Kingdom. "I would have
been waiting for my letters from
American universities when I had to
decide about enrollment for schools
in England."
While applying early has its bene
fits and is clearly an effective way for
students to show their interest in a
school, both high school seniors and
current college students have their
reservations.
"The admit rates are a lot higher,
so I can't understand why you
wouldn't [apply early]," said Mia
Hamamoto, a high school senior at
the Brearley School in New York
City who applied early to Stanford
this year.
"But, if you're confused or not in
love with the school, there is clearly
a downside," she added.
"Even if you think you are in
love with the school, I think high
school students just don't put
enough thought into college appli
cations," said junior Daniel Fisher,
who transferred from Amherst
College, a school to which he ap
plied early three years ago. "I had
my heart set on Amherst, so I never
seriously considered other
schools."
The Undergraduate Admission
Web site warns prospective appli
cants to resist the urge to complete
their applications by the early admis
sion deadline "unless you are con
vinced that Stanford is your clear
first-choice school."
