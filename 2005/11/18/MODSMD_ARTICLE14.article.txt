Mr. Chau's Chinese
Fast Food
3781 El Camino Real, Palo Alto
Combo plates from $4.75 to $6.75

I have three aims for the evening. 1) Obtain
food for myself and my parents. 2) Obtain
that food cheaply and 3) locate a restau
rant interesting enough to generate an amus
ing review. I do succeed in finding inexpen
sive dining, but at an "interesting" restau
rant? Be careful what you wish for...
The night before our latest dining adven
ture, Adam and 1 were discussing where 1
should take my parents to eat.
"I heard of this place on El Camino," he
says. "It's Chinese fast food. Mr. Chau's, I
think it's called."
I Google it. The first review 1 click on is
from a San Jose newspaper. "Fast Food
Frightmare" it's called, and it details how
county health officials ordered the restaurant
to shut down due to a rat infestation in 2000.
But Adam and I are undeterred by such
petty concerns.
"That was a long time ago," he says."The
food sounds good."
"Let's not tell my parents," 1 say.
Fast forward one evening. My unsuspect
ing parents pull up in front of Mr. Chau's.
Through the front glass, we can see Adam
saving us a table. He's the only customer in
the neon-lit restaurant. The huge front win
dows make the restaurant seem cavernous
and eerie, and Adam looks like the last per
son in the world.
The creepiness only increases when we
walk through the doors. The bored servers
seem to welcome our intrusion. It suddenly
feels like there are 10 people behind the
counter.
"Can I help you?" says one member of the
small army.
The food is laid out cafeteria-style in large
steel pans. The food smells good but looks a
little like Lag dining at the end of dinner
hour. There are two lonely egg rolls and the
lemon chicken pan is a little crusty around
the edges. You can get a one, two or three
item combo that comes with fried rice or
chow mein. I go for dai chin chicken and
sweet and sour pork.
"Can I have a taste of the lemon chicken?"
asks my dad, who seems to have mistaken this
Chinese restaurant for an ice cream parlor.
We make it to our table with our food be
fore any further faux pas can transpire. We in
spect our surroundings.The place looks like it
was at least two other restaurants before be
coming Mr. Chau's. The booths are candy
pink and light teal, but the counter is heavy
gray and black marble. There's a giant mirror
alongside one wall, serving only to accentuate
the fact that we are still the only customers.
Adam is 50 percent Chinese and thus 50
percent more qualified than 1 am to comment
on this restaurant.
"This is such a weird Chinese restaurant,"
he says. "There are no chopsticks, no Chi
nese characters on the menu and no large
paintings of bridges of the wall. Nothing is
even red."
We are amused.
"It kind of feels like a bowling alley."
Adam concludes.
Nevertheless, our food is not half bad. The
portions are bigger than we can handle. My
dai chin chicken is the perfect amount of
spicy. My dad likes his barbecue ribs and my
mom likes her mushroom chicken.
Mushrooms remind me of my dad's latest
commercial real estate deal.
"I told Adam you leased the Pacific Mush
room Warehouse," I say to my dad.
"Oh yeah!" he says, getting excited. "The
Pacific Mushroom Warehouse!"
"So, it's full of mushrooms?" I ask.
"That and peat moss," my dad explains.
"Speaking of mushrooms, did you hear about
the Forest Service's battle with the mush
room pickers?"
"Um,no," I respond."Haven't been keep
ing up with the mushroom-picking world."
"I wasn't, either, until the Pacific Mush
room Warehouse deal," my dad says.
Just when I think things can't get any
stranger, the lights dim. It's 9 p.m. — time for
the employees to go home. I guess our expe
rience with Mr. Chau's is over.
The Verdict:
Mr. Chau's food is cheap and tastes fine. It's
comparable in price to fast food a la McDon
ald's, and I'd rather eat Mr. Chau's than Mick
ey D's any day. However, the weird vibe of the
place means take-out only for me.
