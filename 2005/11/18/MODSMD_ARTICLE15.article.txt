# GENDER BENDER BLAST

### Courtney Weaver 
Boys in shoulder pads not
your style? How about
guys in tiaras? Set to take
place Saturday.Nov. 19 at the Re
gency Center in San Francisco, the
10th Annual Trannyshack Pageant will offer
a different breed of competition in contrast
to the age-old Stanford-Cal rivalry. A city's
worth of drag queens will battle it out in
bathing suit and talent competitions, and the
show's Web site guarantees a display of the
human ideal — specifically, "the heavenly
highs, the lumbering lows, the dizzying daz
zlement, the visceral vortex and ruthless re
ality."
But don't let the glitz and glamour fool you.
As pageant creator and local drag superstar
Heklina says,"lt was really a contest that I pulled
out of my ass."
The annual contest stems from its weekly
counterpart Trannyshack, a Tuesday-night drag
show held by the South Market District's Stud
Bar. Both the pageant and the club are MCed by
Heklina herself — the 2004 Community grand
marshal of the San Francisco gay, lesbian, bisex
ual, transgender and questioning parade and a
former guest on the Jerry Springer and Ricki
Lake shows.
Though Heklina is praised by the Tran
nyshack Web site for running the club with "un
flappable humor," "sparkling wit" and "an iron
heel," she actually started the club on an irrever
ent whim.
"TYannyshack was a complete fluke that I
began as a lark back in February 19%," she says.
"It was never meant to last more than a couple of
months. When it became successful I thought it
would be funny to do a pageant."
Since then, Trannyshack and the annual
pageant "have become these huge, larger
than-life things," she continues. "The Miss

Trannyshack Pageant in particular is some
thing people now take so seriously as this
huge event."
As the self-proclaimed "last stop for Bo
hemian San Francisco," Trannyshack offers
refuge to both cross-dressers and those simply
looking for apparel a little more alternative
than Urban Outfitters.
According to the San Francisco guide Web
site — http://www.posthoc.com — the Tran
nyshack crowd comprises one-third transves
tites and "tranny-chasers (you'll recognize
them by their suits)" and two-thirds "club hip
sters." Club music can be characterized as
eclectic or campy, with a practical guarantee of
at least "one Dolly Parton song and several 80s
hits every week," the Web site explains.
Besides the actual pageant component, this
Saturday's event will differ from the weekly
gatherings in its size and scope.
"The stage at Trannyshack is about the size of
a postage stamp," Heklina explains. " The pag
eant is the one time every year when we get to
perform on a huge stage with lighting, video
[and] better sound."
The pageant will by judged by local celebri
ties, including adult film director Chi Chi Laßue,
drag superstars Fauxnique, Glamamore and
Leigh Crow (a.k.a. Elvis Herselvis), as well as

Jane Wiedlin and Gina Schock of
the 1980s girl group the Go-Go's.
While there is a bathing suit component to the
pageant, it is really the participants' "gender
bender performance" that will determine who
will take home the crown, Heklina says.
"The main thing the contestants will be
judged on is their performance in the talent cat
egory," Heklina explains. "This is what Tran
nyshack is all about."
Though having talent is a must, it is one of few
restrictions.
"The conventional drag pageant rules of gen
der go out the window," Heklina says. "Drag
kings, faux queens and even faux kings (men im
personating drag kings) are all welcome to com
pete."
"All that matters is what you do once you get
out on that stage," she adds.
Voted Best Drag Club 2005 by San Francis
co Weekly Readers and Best Transsexual Club
2005 by Bay Guardian readers,Trannyshack is
"an event that is quintessential San Francis
co," Heklina says. "Words don't do it justice."
However, a haiku on the club's Web site
makes a valiant effort:
"i love trannyshack
some get blown, some wear make-up
extravaganza"
