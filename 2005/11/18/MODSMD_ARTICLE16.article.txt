# Students find clarity, balance in MemChu labyrinth
## 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When you stand at the center of
the labyrinth in Memorial Church,
look up and see the light pouring in
from the domed skylight. Look in
front of you and see the quiet, or
derly pews. Look behind you and
see the colored sunlight filtered
through the stained glass windows.
Labyrinths such as the one in
MemChu are often thought of as
mazes, but they are actually quite
different.
"Mazes contain cul-de-sacs and
dead ends," says Reverend Lauren
Artress, canon of special ministries
at the Grace Episcopal Cathedral in
San Francisco and founderof Verdi
tas, the Voice of the Labyrinth
Movement — a nonprofit organi
zation that aims to help people
meditate and heal by walking
through labyrinths. "[Labyrinths]
have more than one entrance and
more than one exit and are designed

to make us lose our way."
In contrast. Artress explains
that labyrinths are designed to help
people find their way.
"They have only one path —
from the outer edge into the center
and back out again." she tells The
Daily.
The labyrinth at Memorial
Church is an 18-square-foot white
mat with a dark purple pattern. It is
laid out in front of the altar on
Wednesdays, according to the Stan
ford News Service. Students and
the general public can walk
through it from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Nearby is a sign with guidelines for
walking and a small information
table with a guest journal.
Some comments in the journal
span a couple of sentences — "My
experience was calming," someone
writes. "The stained glass windows
are so beautiful with the sun shin
ing through them." Others consist
of a few simple words, such as
"thank God."

Though some walkers focus on
what they see as God, navigating
the labyrinth can be a spiritual
journey for anyone — the activity
is not limited to people with partic
ular religious affiliations.
From the Celtic Never Ending
Circle to the Kabala in Judaism,
variations of the spiral-like pattern
in the labyrinth appear in many cul
tures and can be traced back some
4,000 years. The configuration also
mirrors patterns found in nature.
"The idea of walking this path is
parallel to walking the journey of
life," says Rev. Joanne Sanders, as
sociate dean for religious life here
at Stanford. "Because there is only
one path in the labyrinth, you will
often meet other people walking
on the path. The human communi
ty shares the reality of being on the
same path together."
But Sanders says she advises stu
dents to walk the path by themselves
and focus on their personal journeys.
Additionally, the sign says pa

trons should set aside at least 20 to 30
minutes for walking and respect the
space of the people in front of them.
The sign reads, however, that "if
a person is slower than your pace,
simply go around them. Don't
worry — Your pace is your pace."
In light of the often hectic, fren
zied speed of everyday life,
labyrinth walks are making a come
back. Not limited to churches,
labyrinths are now found in medical
centers, parks, schools, retreat cen
ters and even in backyards — any
location where people may need a
way to slow down and reflect.
Sanders says she sympathizes
not only with students' stressful
school schedules, but also with
their dismay over current events.
"We live in difficult times right
now — there is this whole sense of
suffering that so many people
face," she says. "Walking the
labyrinth gives you something solid
to experience —to provide
strength and hope."

It was with students in mind that
the labyrinth was purchased last
year, Sanders says.
"Our hope is that some people
will build [the labyrinth] into their
lives as an anchor every Wednes
day to build a sense of meaning in
life," she continues, adding that she
hopes to help more people take ad
vantage of the opportunity. She
says she plans to hold workshops,
train facilitators and volunteers for
the walks and provide additional
evening hours to accommodate
packed schedules.
"Walking the Labyrinth" is also
free, another encouragement for
people to go as often as they desire.
As the "Walking the Labyrinth"
informational pamphlet states,
"Enter the labyrinth and discover
that walking in circles can actually
put direction back in your life — that
the rhythm and simplicity of follow
ing a clear path can quiet your mind,
help you find balance, facilitate med
itation, insight and celebration."
