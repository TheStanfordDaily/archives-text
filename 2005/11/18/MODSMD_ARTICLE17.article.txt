## BCSC raises funds for renovations Nearly $1 million has been raised in the University-wide campaign 
### KELLEY FONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Black Community Services Center (BCSC) has
raised nearly $1 million to fund the Black House Facility
Expansion Project, a University-wide campaign to in
crease space for the Community Center.
With thd black community continually growing at
Stanford, it has been hard for the BCSC to meet its mem
bers' needs with the limited space they currently occupy.
"We need more space," said junior Macarrin Morton,
a staff member at the Center.
Although the need had been recognized for years, it
was not until the 2002-2003 academic year that, according
to the BCSC Web site, "student leaders in the black com
munity mobilized around their increasing concerns that
the programs and events sponsored and supported by the
black community were being hampered by the limited
space of the BCSC."
In February 2003, Provost John Etchemendy ap
proved the proposal for added facility space and pledged
to match the BCSC's fundraising efforts up to $650,000.
Etchemendy recognized, according to the Web site, "the
breadth and depth of academic and cultural program
ming [offered by the BCSC] and the limitations of the ex
isting facility."
In order to start construction on the additional facilities,
which will be an extension of the current center, the BCSC
must raise a total of about $1.1 million. According to the
BCSC Web site. $800,000 was raised by the end of October.
"The response has been wonderful and has exceeded
the required $650,000 which was matched by The Stan
ford Fund and the University," said Barbara Frerichs
from the Office of Development. She noted that contri
butions had come from more than 350 individuals and
mentioned that "funds in excess of the required amount
will be used for renovations of the existing BCSC facility
to better integrate it with the new addition."
Morton also called the fundraising efforts "pretty suc
cessful." He added that fundraising was "primarily done
through bigger BCSC receptions across the country, in
cities such as Atlanta, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and
Chicago."
"The fundraising was done with student involve
ment. including individual donations, participation in

alumni information receptions and help in outreach to
alumni," Frerichs added.
Much of the expansion project is student-driven and
focused.
"A committee of students met extensively with project
consultant Marji Shaw to determine program priorities,"
Frerichs said.
A new building will be constructed behind the existing
facility, located on the corner of Santa Teresa Street and
Lomita Drive. The two buildings will be connected by a
large deck and outdoor area, which will serve as program
ming space for events such as lectures, performances and
informal gatherings. Part of the deck will face the Harmo
ny House, which is where the Committee for Black Per
forming Arts is located.
"When you have large performances," Morton said,
"the audience can spill out onto the Harmony House
lawn."This will encourage interaction among the current
Black House, the new facility and the Harmony House.
"The addition features a large multipurpose room, a
large deck, a small kitchen and rest rooms," said Frerichs.
"To make it possible to build the building, the University
allocated a total of 2,500 square-feet of space from the
total available under the General Use Permit."
However, Frerichs said, "The project is still in the de
sign phase and we are working on the final drawings be
fore submission for permitting. We don't yet have a start

date, hut it should take about six months to build."
Once completed, the expansion will enhance and im
prove hlack community life at Stanford.
"Black House is a great, historic location, but it is very
small fora community that has grown to several hundred
students," Frerichs said. "This addition will provide a siz
able meeting, activity and event space and deck that will
make it possible for the community to host a variety of
events and activities."
"It's not just a community center," Morton said. "A lot
of resources flow in and out of the house." Morton cited the
Black Graduation Celebration, BlackFest and visiting
speakers and artists as examples of events that the BCSC
organizes.
As an academic resource center, the BCSC does "all
kinds of things to help support the black community. It's
a center not just for activities, but also for student devel
opment," Morton said.
He agreed with Frerichs that the expanded BCSC will
strengthen the black community.
"It'll create more options for the black community in
the long run."he said."lt will help shift a lot of the burden
off Ujamaa as the "unofficial black center,' which will help
create a more unified community. 1 don't see any draw
backs to the project. 1 think it will make Stanford as a
whole better, because [the center] isn't exclusive to the
black community."

consultant Marji Shaw to determine program priorities,"
Frerichs said.
A new building will be constructed behind the existing
facility, located on the corner of Santa Teresa Street and
Lomita Drive. The two buildings will be connected by a
large deck and outdoor area, which will serve as program
ming space for events such as lectures, performances and
informal gatherings. Part of the deck will face the Harmo
ny House, which is where the Committee for Black Per
forming Arts is located.
"When you have large performances," Morton said,
"the audience can spill out onto the Harmony House
lawn."This will encourage interaction among the current
Black House, the new facility and the Harmony House.
"The addition features a large multipurpose room, a
large deck, a small kitchen and rest rooms," said Frerichs.
"To make it possible to build the building, the University
allocated a total of 2,500 square-feet of space from the
total available under the General Use Permit."
However, Frerichs said, "The project is still in the de
sign phase and we are working on the final drawings be
fore submission for permitting. We don't yet have a start

date, hut it should take about six months to build."
Once completed, the expansion will enhance and im
prove hlack community life at Stanford.
"Black House is a great, historic location, but it is very
small fora community that has grown to several hundred
students," Frerichs said. "This addition will provide a siz
able meeting, activity and event space and deck that will
make it possible for the community to host a variety of
events and activities."
"It's not just a community center," Morton said. "A lot
of resources flow in and out of the house." Morton cited the
Black Graduation Celebration, BlackFest and visiting
speakers and artists as examples of events that the BCSC
organizes.
As an academic resource center, the BCSC does "all
kinds of things to help support the black community. It's
a center not just for activities, but also for student devel
opment," Morton said.
He agreed with Frerichs that the expanded BCSC will
strengthen the black community.
"It'll create more options for the black community in
the long run."he said."lt will help shift a lot of the burden
off Ujamaa as the "unofficial black center,' which will help
create a more unified community. 1 don't see any draw
backs to the project. 1 think it will make Stanford as a
whole better, because [the center] isn't exclusive to the
black community."

The Black Community Services Center will be renovated and expanded with the funds raised by the Black House
Facility Expansion Project.
The Black Community Services Center (BCSC) has
raised nearly $1 million to fund the Black House Facility
Expansion Project, a University-wide campaign to in
crease space for the Community Center.
With thd black community continually growing at
Stanford, it has been hard for the BCSC to meet its mem
bers' needs with the limited space they currently occupy.
"We need more space," said junior Macarrin Morton,
a staff member at the Center.
Although the need had been recognized for years, it
was not until the 2002-2003 academic year that, according
to the BCSC Web site, "student leaders in the black com
munity mobilized around their increasing concerns that
the programs and events sponsored and supported by the
black community were being hampered by the limited
space of the BCSC."
In February 2003, Provost John Etchemendy ap
proved the proposal for added facility space and pledged
to match the BCSC's fundraising efforts up to $650,000.
Etchemendy recognized, according to the Web site, "the
breadth and depth of academic and cultural program
ming [offered by the BCSC] and the limitations of the ex
isting facility."
In order to start construction on the additional facilities,
which will be an extension of the current center, the BCSC
must raise a total of about $1.1 million. According to the
BCSC Web site. $800,000 was raised by the end of October.
"The response has been wonderful and has exceeded
the required $650,000 which was matched by The Stan
ford Fund and the University," said Barbara Frerichs
from the Office of Development. She noted that contri
butions had come from more than 350 individuals and
mentioned that "funds in excess of the required amount
will be used for renovations of the existing BCSC facility
to better integrate it with the new addition."
Morton also called the fundraising efforts "pretty suc
cessful." He added that fundraising was "primarily done
through bigger BCSC receptions across the country, in
cities such as Atlanta, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and
Chicago."
"The fundraising was done with student involve
ment. including individual donations, participation in

alumni information receptions and help in outreach to
alumni," Frerichs added.
Much of the expansion project is student-driven and
focused.
