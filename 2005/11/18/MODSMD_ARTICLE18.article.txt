## Groups aim to raise funds at Big Game 
### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Students anxious to beat Cal can help Stanford
take home a more metaphysical Axe by donating
money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and
the Pakistan Earthquake. The drive, which runs
through Nov. 20. is orchestrated by Stanford Stu
dents for Relief (SSR) and Pakistanis at Stanford
(PAS).The event is also being coordinated in tan
dem with a fundraiser led by Berkeley Hurricane
Relief Efforts.
The groups have been raising money through
out the week through donation boxes at most Big
Game events, a stand in White Plaza and a link
through the ASSU Web site. But the primary
fundraiser will be at Saturday's Big Game, where
relief efforts spearheaded by both Stanford and
Cal will be tabling inside the stadium and compet
ing to see whose fans can raise the most funds.
President of SSR Donna Winston, a doctoral
student at the School of Education, assessed the
current state of the competition.
"Last time I checked." Winston said, "we were
ahead. But the levels are not the levels we were an
ticipating, especially considering how many people
there are on campus. There'll be 70,(K)() people at
Big Game, if they can all just give one dollar, think
how much can be done."
The money donated to the Stanford side will be
split between the hurricane and earthquake relief
efforts. Part will go to Habitat for Humanity, which
is building houses for victims of Hurricane Katri
na. The other part will be distributed by Pakistanis
at Stanford.
Junior Rana Uzair, president of PAS, comment
ed on how the relief money has been used.
"We've raised about $19,000 in a month." he
said. "This has been entirely from students. So
we're proud of that. We transferred about half the
money to the Edhi, which is probably the most ef
ficient relief organization running in Pakistan.
Their ambulances got to the scene of the disaster
even before those of the government. In the future
we're planning on making transfers to Unicef or Is
lamic Relief."
Uzair also stated that while the scope of the re
lief effort for Hurricane Katrina has been impres
sive, the Pakistan Earthquake was on "horrific
scale." According to Uzair. the presi
dent of Pakistan estimated that his
country needed about $5.2 billion to
rebuild and they have received only
$500 million to date.
But he added that every dollar in
aid would make a huge difference.
"If you convert it to rupees" he
said. "Five dollars is basically three

meals in Pakistan,so there's a poten
tial to impact people in a very signif
icant way."
Uzair cited several possible rea
sons for the lack of response.
"There's the whole issue of donor
fatigue," he said. "We've been really
unfortunate in that we've had two or
three disasters and maybe people
are just really tired of giving. This is
also a part of the world that is really
misunderstood in the media anil
people are probably hesitant to give
as much as they would fora domes
tic issue."

Winston also noticed a certain
amount of donor fatigue, even in the
case of Hurricane Katrina.
"A lot of people will react to an
emergency and give something at
that time," she said. "And once time
moves on, they lose interest. They
feel that they did their part. We had a
fundraiser at Homecoming Game
; where we were selling Mardi Gras
beads to fund the Alternative Spring
I Break trip to build houses. And a lot
of people walked by and said. Oh, 1
already gave.' The interest just was
n't there."
