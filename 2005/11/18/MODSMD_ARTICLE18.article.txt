### RAHUL KANAKIA STAFF WRITER 
Students anxious to beat Cal can help Stanford
take home a more metaphysical Axe by donating
money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and
the Pakistan Earthquake. The drive, which runs
through Nov. 20. is orchestrated by Stanford Stu
dents for Relief (SSR) and Pakistanis at Stanford
(PAS).The event is also being coordinated in tan
dem with a fundraiser led by Berkeley Hurricane
Relief Efforts.
The groups have been raising money through
out the week through donation boxes at most Big
Game events, a stand in White Plaza and a link
through the ASSU Web site. But the primary
fundraiser will be at Saturday's Big Game, where
relief efforts spearheaded by both Stanford and

Big Game, if they can all just give one dollar, think

The money donated to the Stanford side will be
split between the hurricane and earthquake relief
efforts. Part will go to Habitat for Humanity, which
is building houses for victims of Hurricane Katri

at Stanford.
Junior Rana Uzair, president of PAS, comment
ed on how the relief money has been used.
"We've raised about $19,000 in a month." he
said. "This has been entirely from students. So
we're proud of that. We transferred about half the
money to the Edhi, which is probably the most ef
ficient relief organization running in Pakistan.
Their ambulances got to the scene of the disaster
even before those of the government. In the future
we're planning on making transfers to Unicef or Is
lamic Relief."
Uzair also stated that while the scope of the re
