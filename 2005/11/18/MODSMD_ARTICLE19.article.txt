## Editorial Celebration should be loud but civil 
### 
The celebration after our win tomorrow
should be glorious: a victory after
three years of defeat, staking a final
claim on Stanford Stadium one game before
its last. And while we would love to be able
to rush the field tomorrow, we somewhat re
luctantly recommend that fans celebrate
where they are.
Considering the current situation — a
dangerous fence, large security forces and a
potentially rowdy crowd — we encourage
everyone to remain safely in the stands.
Past incidents should remind fans to think
twice before they do anything they might
later regret.
The last time students rushed the field at
Stanford Stadium was in 1997. when the
fence separating the field and the stands had
to be opened because people were being
crushed against it. The result — brawls be
tween Stanford and Cal fans, a broken goal
post and a few injuries — was a black eye on
the 100 th Big Game.
The melee resulted in just six arrests, but
the danger of serious injuries was real.
Around the country, students and fans have
been injured and killed, especially by dis
mantled goal posts.
At the next Big Game held at Stanford, in
1999, a large number of police marched onto
the track in riot gear midway through the
third quarter, diverting attention from the
field and silencing the fans.
This response, which has continued since,
suggests that students cannot be trusted to
regulate themselves. The University should
be in the business of promoting trust, not di
viding the campus.
The two options the administration sees
are keeping the fans confined to the stands
or letting them onto the field. The latter is
undesirable because it involves the risk of
liability and the responsibility of cleaning
up the enormous damage that may be left.
These may be the options, but if students
are urged to move cautiously, restrain their
peers and celebrate without causing dam
age, there is a solution where everyone can
win.
Instead of treating fans as enemies, ath

letic administrators need to treat fans as
partners in the whole event, even after the
game is over and the celebration has begun.
Sure, an excessive amount of security and
imposing fences can keep us off the field. But
does that send the right message?
The dangers of rushing the field should
not be trivialized. Many Stanfordbth Man
members can remember rushing the court
after Nick Robinson's buzzer-beater against
Arizona in 2004. Not as many know that the
previous day a Stanford volleyball recruit
suffered a stroke in the dogpile that followed
a victory for his high school team.
In order to improve the safety of the
whole experience, the University needs to
concede something to students. Victory ex
citement after Big Game in 2007 should in
clude a celebration on the field in the new
Stanford Stadium. In return, administrators
should explain, through word of mouth, e
mail lists, student publications and talks by
the coaching staff, how students should con
duct themselves. If students were persuaded
that rushing the field is a privilege, instead of
a right they were being denied, they would
act much more respectfully.
And please, give the coaches a pre-game
message that they actually believe; everyone
just laughs at Walt Harris when he reads the
telepronipter urging civil behavior.
Outreach is already being attempted. In
addition to Harris's less-than-authentic pre
game coach's message, there have been ad
vertisements, announcements and solicita
tion of Daily articles. The Athletic Depart
ment already thinks that it is trying as hard
as possible to keep fans safe. But the mes
sage — don't rush the field — doesn't make
sense to most students. While individuals
can be persuaded that rushing the field is a
poor choice given the risks that mobs can
create, the campus as a whole will never buy
this argument.
A better argument — be careful and con
siderate, watch out for others and don't take
down the goal posts — would promote the
right attitude, show fan appreciation and.in
the end. would most effectively keep every
one safe.

Considering the current situation — a
dangerous fence, large security forces and a
potentially rowdy crowd — we encourage
everyone to remain safely in the stands.
Past incidents should remind fans to think
twice before they do anything they might
later regret.
The last time students rushed the field at
Stanford Stadium was in 1997. when the
fence separating the field and the stands had
to be opened because people were being
crushed against it. The result — brawls be
tween Stanford and Cal fans, a broken goal
post and a few injuries — was a black eye on
the 100 th Big Game.
The melee resulted in just six arrests, but
the danger of serious injuries was real.
Around the country, students and fans have
been injured and killed, especially by dis
mantled goal posts.
At the next Big Game held at Stanford, in
1999, a large number of police marched onto
the track in riot gear midway through the
third quarter, diverting attention from the
field and silencing the fans.
This response, which has continued since,
suggests that students cannot be trusted to
regulate themselves. The University should
be in the business of promoting trust, not di
viding the campus.
The two options the administration sees
are keeping the fans confined to the stands
or letting them onto the field. The latter is
undesirable because it involves the risk of
liability and the responsibility of cleaning
up the enormous damage that may be left.
These may be the options, but if students
are urged to move cautiously, restrain their
peers and celebrate without causing dam
age, there is a solution where everyone can
win.
Instead of treating fans as enemies, ath

letic administrators need to treat fans as
partners in the whole event, even after the
game is over and the celebration has begun.
Sure, an excessive amount of security and
imposing fences can keep us off the field. But
does that send the right message?
The dangers of rushing the field should
not be trivialized. Many Stanfordbth Man
members can remember rushing the court
after Nick Robinson's buzzer-beater against
Arizona in 2004. Not as many know that the
previous day a Stanford volleyball recruit
suffered a stroke in the dogpile that followed
a victory for his high school team.
In order to improve the safety of the
whole experience, the University needs to
concede something to students. Victory ex
citement after Big Game in 2007 should in
clude a celebration on the field in the new
Stanford Stadium. In return, administrators
should explain, through word of mouth, e
mail lists, student publications and talks by
the coaching staff, how students should con
duct themselves. If students were persuaded
that rushing the field is a privilege, instead of
a right they were being denied, they would
act much more respectfully.
And please, give the coaches a pre-game
message that they actually believe; everyone
just laughs at Walt Harris when he reads the
telepronipter urging civil behavior.
Outreach is already being attempted. In
addition to Harris's less-than-authentic pre
game coach's message, there have been ad
vertisements, announcements and solicita
tion of Daily articles. The Athletic Depart
ment already thinks that it is trying as hard
as possible to keep fans safe. But the mes
sage — don't rush the field — doesn't make
sense to most students. While individuals
can be persuaded that rushing the field is a
poor choice given the risks that mobs can
create, the campus as a whole will never buy
this argument.
A better argument — be careful and con
siderate, watch out for others and don't take
down the goal posts — would promote the
right attitude, show fan appreciation and.in
the end. would most effectively keep every
one safe.
