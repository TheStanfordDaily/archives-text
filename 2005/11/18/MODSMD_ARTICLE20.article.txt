# French riots represent broader issues
## 
### 
The riots that spread through France in
the last three weeks are one of the
major news events of the year. That
much is clear. But what is less clear, and what
deserves more attention, is that these upris
ings are not just another headline that stands
alone. Instead, they are a symptom of a
growing problem that demands the atten
tion of Stanford students and the American
public at large. It is not uncommon for the
Editorial Board to call for students to pay
more attention to a specific event or trend
occurring in the world. Ihough this is also
the case here, we believe that the French
riots are indicative of something that is not
only important in its own right, but that also
directly affects students here and Americans
everywhere.
These uprisings come as the latest in a
string of incidents in the last few years in
volving Muslim unrest in Europe. This in
cludes the bombings in London this summer
by Islamic radicals and the assassination of
flieo van Gogh, an outspoken Dutch direc
tor critical of Islam, by a Muslim extremist in
the Netherlands a year ago. And while the
riots in France are not classic acts of terror
ism, they are a violent expression of the dis
content of a minority that is mostly Muslim
and North African and Arab.
It is easy to discard the bombings and as
sassination as unrelated acts of Islamic ter
rorism or, in the case of the riots, as a French
problem, without appreciating that there
might be a shared underlying structure.
What is so striking about these events is the
identity of the bombers in the United King
dom and the rioters in France. They are not
the battle-hardened fanatics that some may
imagine them to be. Three of the four Lon

don bombers were born and raised in the
United Kingdom: one was even a recent fa
ther. And many of the rioting youth in
France are not immigrants or rabble
rousers, but rather French-born youth of
Arab and North African descent.
Radicalism and fundamentalism, in all
their secular and religious forms, are un
doubtedly global problems, and the events in
Europe over the last few years show that Is
lamic extremism is more than just an Amer
ican issue. Iliere is something terribly wrong
with the situation facing Muslims in many of
Europe's democracies, and this problem —
characterized by high unemployment, social
segregation and a disgruntled youth —
could be as much a contributing factor to
global Islamic radicalism as some believe
American foreign policy to be. What we
need to do now is look more closely at this
problem, not so that we can make excuses
for terrorism and extremism, but so that we
can better understand and deal with what
has become a potent and significant force.
It is easy to ignore what is happening
thousands of miles away. After all. it's not in
our suburbs that are burning, it is not our mi
norities that are involved and it is not our
backyards that are being destroyed. Yet, if
we are to really believe that terrorism is a
global problem, if we are to understand it in
its global context, we cannot overlook what
happens in the news as unrelated and irrele
vant. In a very real sense, the problems in
France, in the United Kingdom, in the
Netherlands, and in much of the rest of Eu
rope are our problems. And we encourage
anyone who cares about t he fate of their own
communities to start caring and thinking
about what happens overseas.
