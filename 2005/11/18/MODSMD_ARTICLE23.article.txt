# A
						few predictions for tomorrow
## 
### 
In the spirit of the week we thought we
might devote today's column to the legacy
of Big Game. We figured we would start off
by using our highly developed powers of sta
tistical analysis to predict the outcome of the
game (after all, Cassidy is almost done with
Stat 60), then wow you with our extraordinary
knowledge of players, stats, obscure rules and
Big Game history.
Just kidding.
Lets be honest: If you look in the diction
ary under "football fans," you probably won't
find our picture. And that's not just because
"football fans" isn't actually listed in the dic
tionary. We'll tell it to you straight: If football
were a section on the SATs, we'd both be
going to Foothill College. I mean, who woul
da thought that linebacker isn't synonymous
with lineman? And who knew third down
didn't refer to the number of injured players?
And are you absolutely certain that that ball's
puffed not stuffed? Really? Because it sure
looks stuffed to us.
Anyway, if we were to write the column de
scribed above, we would probably just steal
our nifty facts and stats from one of the 637
other Big Game 2005 articles we've seen,
which would in turn cause us to roll around at
night wrestling with our consciences. And we
athletes need sleep. So we'll spare you the
agony of two divers' attempt to express enthu
siasm fora sport that doesn't give you a nice
Speedo tan line.
Are we still planning to write about the
game? Of course.
"But Kevin and Cassidy... you just got done
tellinc us that you don't know a football from

a hackysack. Why on earth would you want to
spend four hours cramping your backsides on
stadium bleachers and staring vacantly into
space?"
The answer is simple. Silly kids, there's
more to a football game than a football game.
The Superbowl has sweet commercials. The
Cowboys have sweet cheerleaders. And Big
Game... well. Big Game has The Axe Commit
tee.
Think back to freshman year (for you
freshmen this shouldn't be that hard). Re
member orientation: the new surroundings,
the energetic people, the excitement of your
classmates. Now dig a little deeper. Remem
ber the creepy upperclassman wearing an old
man Stanford cardigan leading a shockingly
morbid cadence about slashing necks or
something to that degree? Remember the
awkward silence that followed? Well that, my
Daily friends, is the Stanford Axe committee,
and Big Game Week is their time to shine.
But for you campus regulars, what can we
tell you that you don't already know? You've
probably already heard the story: The Stan
ford Axe... big axe, red handle, bladed, origi
nally used for cutting stuff... created in 1899...

then stolen by Cal... stolen back by Stanford...
stolen by Cal... stolen back by Stanford...
stolen by Cal... vadda yadda vadda. But did
you know that the handle of the original Axe
was made out of Leland Stanford Junior's
wooden leg? And that Axe committee alumni
include the likes of Chelsea Clinton. Paul Mc-
Cartney, and the guy who played Yoda in Star
Wars? And that the Axe Committee kid
napped the Lindberg baby? (At this point.our
editors would like us to interject that we're
compulsive liars and none of these facts is re
ally "true." Carry on.)
Alright, something true about the Axe
Committee: They're creepy. Something else:
They're responsible for that train whistle
countdown that you've probably heard every
hour, on the hour, if you live anywhere closer
to White Plaza than Suites, Narnia or Min
nesota. That's not all. It gets better. Football
players may run. throw and tackle, but do they
ever do anything really cool like set off can
nons and burn fires with teddy bear kindling?
In our opinion, the question's not, "Why
would anyone pay $40 to go to the game if
they don't like football." The question is,
"Who could possibly resist paying a mere $40
for an afternoon packed with the Axe Com
mittee's rabble-rousing on the sidelines?"
(Not that we're going to be paying anyway.)
But it's all in good fun. Though we might
at times be weirded out or annoyed by our
beloved Axe Committee and their crazy an
tics, we know they're just upholding our
good old Stanford traditions. And besides, it
will all be worthwhile when we BEAT CAL.
Go Card.
