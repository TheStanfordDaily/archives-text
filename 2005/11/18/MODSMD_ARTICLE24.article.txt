# Story of the intellectual crush
## 
### 
Disclaimer: This is not a column about
dating. Or sex. It is a column about
love.
Introduction:
Attraction falls into three distinct cate
gories (Pam and Hutcherson 2003): the aver
age romantic crush, the friend crush and a
final type that transcends that paradigmatic,
historical implication of the word crush. This
is the intellectual crush.
Symptoms of this type of attraction can be
summarized in one exemplary instance: our
coherent thoughts melt like butter in a mi
crowave when we walk into certain class
rooms.
Case Study: Accents
The following testimonials come from ac
tual Daily columnists.
"I love Gavin Jones for his insightful com
mentary on the short stories of Zora Neale
I lurston. But what really made me get up and
go to lecture was his Scottish brogue. Who
wouldn't love an American literature profes
sor from the British Isles?"
Or take Tom Kealey, in creative writing,
whose Southern drawl warms a room and
soothes the sting of criticism.
In a unique variation of this phenomenon.
Prof. Harry Elam invents alluring vocabulary
to draw his students in with his innovative.sexy
nomenclature such as "dis-elation," the strip
ping of all joy, or opposite of simple elation.

Analysis:
The intellectual crush inhabits the voice. It
is a romance of words. We press ourselves to
the pages of texts. We stare longingly into a
computer screen, writing papers like love let
ters late at night, by candle, oops, halogen,
oops. University-sanctioned lighting.
Case Study: Lanier Anderson
"Fora full quarter I thought I was in love
with Lanier Anderson. Gourmet chef, sensi
tive. existentialist philosopher, witty, insight
ful and earnest. He was everything I'd always
dreamed of, unlike any man I'd ever known.
For the first two weeks of class I couldn't
speak without trembling. I lost track of the
hours I spent reading Montaigne essays and
imagining them in his voice. I didn't know
what to do with myself."
Analysis:
This effect has been noted in several
IHtJM participants after lecture. It would

seem that his status, amplified by his place on
stage, his perfect enunciation and above all his
impeccable linen suits have allowed these stu
dents to "other" this professor, transforming
him into an embodiment of the ideal man.
Results:
Alter placing these columnists in the iso
lation of office hours, under careful scrutiny
by members of the psychiatry department, it
was determined that the ladies in question in
fact did not understand their own emotions.
After coaching and shock therapy one sub
ject was finally able to articulate it.
"I'm not saying that I'm actually in love
with Richard White, I just have this enor
mous intellectual crush." Experimenters
were unsuccessful in curing her of the desire
to return to office hours each week to bask in
the aura of genius.
Conclusion:
We were not in love and probably never
will be. Our teachers have spoiled us forever.
We will never again find their equals in intel
ligence and charm. That's what we spent our
$160,(XK) to find out. At least the knowledge
that we won't find true fulfillment in another
person leaves us free to marry well with im
punity.
