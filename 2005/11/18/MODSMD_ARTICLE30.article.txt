## Andrew Rogers Don't blame me: I have to hate Cal 
### 
Ihave to hate Cal. For the 108 th time, the
junior college from across the Bay will at
tempt to claim dominance over our presti
gious institution by taking on our football
team at Big Game. While Stanford can almost
taste victory, the weenies from Berkeley have
delusions of grandeur.
For some reason, they think winning three
Big Games in a row while Stanford was
coached by Buddy "...but I'm a good person"
Teevens means something in the grand
scheme of things. Stanford has always been
better than Cal, not only at football but in life.
For those of you who don't know, here are
some other reasons why Cal sucks:
Berkeley students have hypocrisy flowing
out of their unwashed asses. Here's a typical
Cal student:
"Oh, I'd never want to go to Stanford. It's
just a rich kid school, and the education is so
much better here at Cal. Plus, we're so much
more cultured and get real world experience
not living in that sterile bubble."
"Oh really" I say. "So I guess you didn't
apply to Stanford?"
"No,"comes the response."l was rejected."
Wow, fantastic! I guess we were a little elit
ist. I'm sorry, your 880 SAT score is com
pelling, but your personal hygiene is cause for
concern. When was the last time you bathed or
cut your hair? For the Stanford women out
there who feel like the guys at Cal might be a
better choice, let me lay down your options for
you. You can either have a guy with hair longer
than yours who hasn't seen a bar of soap since
the Nixon era (and he was probably in college
even then), or the guy sitting next to you who
finished with a medal at the last Olympics (we
had 17 in Athens).
As for that real world experience to which
you love to cling, let's take a look at that. What
makes Berkeley such a better place than Stan
ford? Hmm, let's ask one of your own. This is
an actual quote pulled from a recently distrib
uted Big Game video. It's from one of those
wonderful real-world women that provide
that culture. She had enough piercings to
shame Dennis Rodman. Here's her take on
Cal's recent success.
"Well, I think probably it is more meditat
ing, is always in perfect flow and Zen, is ener
gy forces, and the blue and the gold keep it
perfectly centered with the Tibetan Buddhist
temple right around the corner and this many
Chinese restaurants and Asian restaurants, it
has no choice but to be perfectly centered, in
mind and body control, through Zen, that they
win every time."*
Not bad, so why doesn't Stanford get this
Zen?
"They probably don't have as many Asian
restaurants as we do."
So. to recap, Stanford's chi is off-center
because we don't have enough Kung-Pao
chicken.
Real world experience sure is
valuable though. It's true, there are a
lot more situations that arise at
Berkeley that may prepare you bet
ter for life or some difficult challenge
down the line. The next time I use a
dirty needle to inject myself with
some reality-altering drug because I
can't stand where I am anymore, I'll
wish I went to Cal so I could figure
out how best to avoid contracting a
terminal disease.
You noticed at the beginning of
the column I said that I have to hate
Cal. Why not just straight hate Cal?
Well, it's because we here at Stanford
are too busy being successful at life to
care about the misguided self-hatred
directed at us. Don't get me wrong,
the rivalry may have been entertain
ing at some point in time, but now,
we're just too good at everything we
do.
Cal hates us for who they aren't.
Stanford, however, couldn't care less.
It's like Shaquille O'Neal hating on

Mugsy Bogues for being able to drib
ble well. But, hey, give the dog a bone
every once in a while. Freshman year,
we let them take a Big Game after
they lost seven in a row. As the stu
dents rushed the field at Memorial
Stadium, the Stanford student sec
tion goaded them into tearing down
their own goal posts. It's entertaining
to watch a dog try to hold onto a bone
and chew its own ass at the same
time.
Enough already. Cal has pro
duced a number of things to be proud
of. Why, even after the Bears lose to
morrow, they at least have their 11
consecutive Director's Cups to fall
back on.
What's that? Oh right, you wee
nies suck.
*1 want to thank the guys who put
together the movie that I drew mate
rial from. If you have a chance, watch
the whole thing at http://www.stan
ford.edu/~whaas/ â€” what I've given
here is only the tip of the iceberg.

Andrew Rogers is a senior who really
loves hating Cal, even though he is
forced to do so. E-mail him your best
