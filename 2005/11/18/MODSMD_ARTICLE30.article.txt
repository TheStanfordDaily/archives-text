## Andrew Rogers Don't blame me: I have to hate Cal 
### 
Ihave to hate Cal. For the 108 th time, the
junior college from across the Bay will at
tempt to claim dominance over our presti
gious institution by taking on our football
team at Big Game. While Stanford can almost
taste victory, the weenies from Berkeley have
delusions of grandeur.
For some reason, they think winning three
Big Games in a row while Stanford was
coached by Buddy "...but I'm a good person"
Teevens means something in the grand
scheme of things. Stanford has always been
better than Cal, not only at football but in life.
For those of you who don't know, here are
some other reasons why Cal sucks:
Berkeley students have hypocrisy flowing
out of their unwashed asses. Here's a typical
Cal student:
"Oh, I'd never want to go to Stanford. It's
just a rich kid school, and the education is so
much better here at Cal. Plus, we're so much
more cultured and get real world experience
not living in that sterile bubble."
"Oh really" I say. "So I guess you didn't
apply to Stanford?"
"No,"comes the response."l was rejected."
Wow, fantastic! I guess we were a little elit
ist. I'm sorry, your 880 SAT score is com
pelling, but your personal hygiene is cause for
concern. When was the last time you bathed or
cut your hair? For the Stanford women out
there who feel like the guys at Cal might be a
better choice, let me lay down your options for
you. You can either have a guy with hair longer
than yours who hasn't seen a bar of soap since
the Nixon era (and he was probably in college
even then), or the guy sitting next to you who
finished with a medal at the last Olympics (we
had 17 in Athens).
As for that real world experience to which
you love to cling, let's take a look at that. What
makes Berkeley such a better place than Stan
ford? Hmm, let's ask one of your own. This is
an actual quote pulled from a recently distrib
uted Big Game video. It's from one of those
wonderful real-world women that provide
that culture. She had enough piercings to
shame Dennis Rodman. Here's her take on
Cal's recent success.
"Well, I think probably it is more meditat
ing, is always in perfect flow and Zen, is ener
gy forces, and the blue and the gold keep it
perfectly centered with the Tibetan Buddhist
temple right around the corner and this many
Chinese restaurants and Asian restaurants, it
has no choice but to be perfectly centered, in
mind and body control, through Zen, that they
win every time."*
Not bad, so why doesn't Stanford get this
Zen?
"They probably don't have as many Asian
restaurants as we do."
So. to recap, Stanford's chi is off-center
because we don't have enough Kung-Pao
chicken.
