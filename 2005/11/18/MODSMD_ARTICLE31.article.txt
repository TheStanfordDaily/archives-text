# No. 5 volleyball takes on No. 13 Cal
## Cardinal coming off of a tough loss to No. 6 Arizona last weekend 
### ANDY LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite dropping a crucial Pacific-10 Confer
ence match to No. 6 Arizona last Friday, the No. 5
Stanford women's volleyball team is far from push
ing the panic button.
Rather, head coach John Dunning remains con
fident in the Cardinal's (22-5,11-4 Pac-10) abilities
and said the athletes can take a lot from the loss.
"It just killed our team to lose [to Arizona]," he
said. "But we can recover by having an awareness
of what we accomplished. I think we found we are
still a good team because we played a very great
team and did well."
One major bright spot for Stanford is the play
ers' tremendous adjustment to new roles. With

freshman outside
hitter Cynthia Bar
boza out for the
season, sophomore
outside hitter
Franci Girard has
shared Barboza's
left-side job with
junior Jennifer
Wilson. Freshman
Jessica Fishburn,
meanwhile, has
gained more expe
rience defending
the back row.
Senior Katie
Goldhahn — fill
ing in for injured
sophomore setter
Bryn Kehoe —
made quick work
of stepping in to
set up the Cardi
nal's offense, mak
ing 55 sets in the
Arizona contest.

Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards and fresh
man Foluke Akinradewo continue to ignite Stan
ford's attack, hitting .284 and .409, respectively.
Richards, perhaps feeling obligated to make up
for the lost hands of Barboza, maintains a recent
hot streak, recording a career-high 31 kills at Wash
ington State on Nov. 4 and collecting 29 more last
weekend against the Wildcats.
And with all the team's recent injuries in mind,
Stanford has and will continue to rely on these ad
justments to win with its current roster.
"Our number one goal is to still be playing vol
leyball after the regular season is over," Dunning
said. "To do that, we need to be the team that keeps
improving during the last week of play. If we can
improve until the last day of the season, then we're
doing good. If you're fighting through adversity
and still doing well, then you should be proud of
yourself."
No. 13 California (18-7, 10-5) visits Stanford
tonight for Senior Night at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal defeated the Golden Bears on Oct. 21 at
Cal, 3-1, losing Barboza in the process. Though
Stanford dominated the first two games, games
three and four remained close through the final
moments.
Richards and Akinradewo contributed 16 and
14 kills, respectively, to the Cardinal's offensive ef
fort. On the other end of the net, Stanford held Cal
to a .128 hitting percentage.

Junior middle blocker Lizzie Suiter and the No. 5 Cardinal must rebound from a devastating loss to No. 6 Arizona last week.
They face No. 13 California for their last home match tonight.

contest. Pressey also recorded a
match-high 22 kills against Stan
ford earlier in the season.
With just three games left in
!Stanford's Pac-10 schedule, a win
tonight would go a long way in
boosting the team's energy.
"We're looking forward to fin
ishing off our Pac-10 season with a
Ibang," Goldhahn said. "We need to
win to show ourselves that all our
hard work is actually paying off,
.and we need the momentum head
ling into the postseason."
As fora loss tonight. Dunning
would rather not think about it.
"There is no reason to think
about losing," he said. "When we
lose a match, we think plenty about
it for the next 24 hours. But by the
time we get back together, we have
a new set of goals for what to do
next. We're going into this match
thinking only about what a win
could do for us."
Despite dropping a crucial Pacific-10 Confer
ence match to No. 6 Arizona last Friday, the No. 5
Stanford women's volleyball team is far from push
ing the panic button.
Rather, head coach John Dunning remains con
fident in the Cardinal's (22-5,11-4 Pac-10) abilities
and said the athletes can take a lot from the loss.
"It just killed our team to lose [to Arizona]," he
said. "But we can recover by having an awareness
of what we accomplished. I think we found we are
still a good team because we played a very great
team and did well."
One major bright spot for Stanford is the play
ers' tremendous adjustment to new roles. With

freshman outside
hitter Cynthia Bar
boza out for the
season, sophomore
outside hitter
Franci Girard has
shared Barboza's
left-side job with
junior Jennifer
Wilson. Freshman
Jessica Fishburn,
meanwhile, has
gained more expe
rience defending
the back row.
Senior Katie
Goldhahn — fill
ing in for injured
sophomore setter
Bryn Kehoe —
made quick work
of stepping in to
set up the Cardi
nal's offense, mak
ing 55 sets in the
Arizona contest.

Junior outside hitter Kristin Richards and fresh
man Foluke Akinradewo continue to ignite Stan
ford's attack, hitting .284 and .409, respectively.
Richards, perhaps feeling obligated to make up
for the lost hands of Barboza, maintains a recent
hot streak, recording a career-high 31 kills at Wash
ington State on Nov. 4 and collecting 29 more last
weekend against the Wildcats.
And with all the team's recent injuries in mind,
Stanford has and will continue to rely on these ad
justments to win with its current roster.
"Our number one goal is to still be playing vol
leyball after the regular season is over," Dunning
said. "To do that, we need to be the team that keeps
improving during the last week of play. If we can
improve until the last day of the season, then we're
doing good. If you're fighting through adversity
and still doing well, then you should be proud of
yourself."
No. 13 California (18-7, 10-5) visits Stanford
tonight for Senior Night at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal defeated the Golden Bears on Oct. 21 at
Cal, 3-1, losing Barboza in the process. Though
Stanford dominated the first two games, games
three and four remained close through the final
moments.
Richards and Akinradewo contributed 16 and
