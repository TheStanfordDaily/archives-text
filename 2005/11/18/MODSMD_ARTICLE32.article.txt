## 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
Next Monday, the men's and
women's cross country squads aim to
make an impression at the NCAA
Championships in Terre Haute, Ind.
The women, led by sophomore Arian
na Lambie, are the NCAA West Re
gional champions and are second only
to Duke in the national polls. The men
— led by the eighth-place finish of
sophomore Neftalem Araia at the West
Regionals — enter Nationals ranked
N0.6 in the nation.
The runners have just nine days be
tween last week's Regional Champi
onships and next week's Nationals to
recover and gear up for the demanding
6,000-meter women's race and 10,000-
meter men's race.
"We are definitely slowing down the
intensity and volume of training for the
Championships," head coach Peter
Tegen said. "We have already begun to
focus on the task at hand. There are so
many different facets of preparation
involved, it always takes a lot of con
centration."
Eight women are traveling to Indi
ana University, and seven are set to
compete for the Cardinal, including
Lambie and fellow sophomore Teresa
McWalters. Hie duo has co-captained
the women's team this season, playing
an instrumental role in the squad's suc
cess.
"The team is very unified and mo
tivated to make all the hard work
done this season to fruition,"

Lambie said.
The women, who have won all six of
their races this season, finished fifth
last year at Nationals.The team is doing
everything in its power to ensure a bet
ter result this year.
"We've just been keeping each
other positive, physically resting our
bodies a little bit and getting each other
psyched up," Lambie said.
Along with Lambie and McWalters,
juniors Katy and Amanda Trotter,
sophomore Lauren Centrowitz, red
shirt freshmen Katie Harrington and
Lindsay Flacks and freshman Alicia
Follmar round out the Cardinal lineup.
Lambie has won every race this sea
son, except for the Pre-NCAA meet,
and captured the NCAA West Region
al title just six days ago. Now she is fo
cusing on preparing for Nationals.
r« 've just been keeping with my rou

tine, taking care of my body and staying
relaxed with everything," Lambie said.
"I am trying not to let the outside pres
sures influence me."
Eight men, including fifth-year sen
ior David Vidal — the oldest and most
experienced competitor on the team
travel to Nationals this morning.
ITie men finished first in four of their
six races this season and were sixth at
last year's competition.
After two of the team's best run
ners, Vidal and junior Jacob Gomez, sat
out last week's Regionals,Tegen is op
timistic about the complete squad's
prospects.
"We will have the full team together
this time, and we will certainly try to
fulfill all of the expectations that we are
having and end the season on a great
note,"Tegen said.
Along with Vidal, three juniors, in
cluding Gomez, Brett Gotcher and
Jonathan Pierce. Araia. redshirt fresh
men Garrett Heath and Hari Mix and
freshman John McGuire plan to repre
sent the Cardinal at Nationals.
As for any rivalry with fellow Pacif
ic* 10 Conference team Arizona,Tegen
says that it would be foolish at this
point to focus on conference con
tentions.
"We are going to Nationals to be
competitive at the national level,"
Tegen said. "Once your conference and
regional championships are over, it
would be silly to look to the left and
right to your competitors there. Na
tional championships are a different
competition altogether."

Championships," head coach Peter
Tegen said. "We have already begun to
focus on the task at hand. There are so
many different facets of preparation
involved, it always takes a lot of con
centration."
Eight women are traveling to Indi
ana University, and seven are set to
compete for the Cardinal, including
Lambie and fellow sophomore Teresa
McWalters. Hie duo has co-captained
the women's team this season, playing
an instrumental role in the squad's suc
cess.
"The team is very unified and mo
tivated to make all the hard work
done this season to fruition,"

Lambie said.
The women, who have won all six of
their races this season, finished fifth
last year at Nationals.The team is doing
everything in its power to ensure a bet
ter result this year.
"We've just been keeping each
other positive, physically resting our
bodies a little bit and getting each other
psyched up," Lambie said.
Along with Lambie and McWalters,
juniors Katy and Amanda Trotter,
sophomore Lauren Centrowitz, red
shirt freshmen Katie Harrington and
Lindsay Flacks and freshman Alicia
Follmar round out the Cardinal lineup.
Lambie has won every race this sea
son, except for the Pre-NCAA meet,
and captured the NCAA West Region
al title just six days ago. Now she is fo
cusing on preparing for Nationals.
r« 've just been keeping with my rou

tine, taking care of my body and staying
relaxed with everything," Lambie said.
"I am trying not to let the outside pres
sures influence me."
Eight men, including fifth-year sen
ior David Vidal — the oldest and most
experienced competitor on the team
travel to Nationals this morning.
ITie men finished first in four of their
six races this season and were sixth at
last year's competition.
After two of the team's best run
ners, Vidal and junior Jacob Gomez, sat
out last week's Regionals,Tegen is op
timistic about the complete squad's
prospects.
"We will have the full team together
this time, and we will certainly try to
fulfill all of the expectations that we are
having and end the season on a great
note,"Tegen said.
Along with Vidal, three juniors, in
cluding Gomez, Brett Gotcher and
Jonathan Pierce. Araia. redshirt fresh
men Garrett Heath and Hari Mix and
freshman John McGuire plan to repre
sent the Cardinal at Nationals.
As for any rivalry with fellow Pacif
ic* 10 Conference team Arizona,Tegen
says that it would be foolish at this
point to focus on conference con
tentions.
"We are going to Nationals to be
competitive at the national level,"
Tegen said. "Once your conference and
regional championships are over, it
would be silly to look to the left and
right to your competitors there. Na
tional championships are a different
competition altogether."
