# Big Splash a battle of two of nation's best
## No. 3 Cardinal face a gifted Bears squad in the final game of the 2005 regular season 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It's Saturday afternoon — time to jump on
your bike and head across campus to cheer on your
fellow Cardinal as they take on archrival Califor
nia in one of the most important games of the sea
son for both teams. According to national rank
ings, Stanford enters the game as the underdog, but
really the squad that plays with the most spirit,
tenacity and coordination will be the one that ulti
mately claims victory. So you know where you're
headed, right?
You've got it — Avery Aquatic Center at 1 p.m.
for the annual Big Splash showdown between the
Stanford and Cal men's water polo teams.
That 1 p.m. start means more than usual; it
marks the time when senior driver Peter Varellas
launches himself into 1 he game-opening sprint —
the final opening sprinit the graduating captain will
ever make in the Stanford pool that has been his
home for the last four years.
If the Big Splash ma tchups of recent years serve
as any indicator, there will likely be around 3,(XK)
fans on hand for the Card's final regular season
game. Fans should show up well before game time
if they want to stand any chance of finding a spot
where they'll be able to catch a glimpse of the ac
tion.
The No. 3 Cardinal (16-5,5-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) and the No. 2 Bears (19-5,5-2)
both know that they're headed for the postseason
two weeks from now at the MPSF conference tour
nament in Malibu,Calif. But that doesn't take away
from either team's focus on the Saturday afternoon
showdown.
The Stanford men are fully aware of the chal
lenge that their rivals from across the Bay pose. Cal
has established itself as one of the toughest and
deepest teams in the league. So despite the fact
that the Bears are coming off a shaky weekend
during which they lost to top-ranked Southern
California and blew a two goal lead before finish
ing off No. 8 Long Eieach State in overtime, the
Cardinal plan on seeing a full realization of Cal's
potential.
"Man for man, Cal has probably the most talent
ed team in the NCAA.," sophomore two-meter de
fender Peter Finlaysoin said. "We're watching a lot

of tape and working out the kinks of our game plan.
We're also focusing on our play in the defensive end
and having our offense come out of our defense."
Like Varellas. senior captain Thomas Hopkins
plans to make his final appearance at Avery this
Saturday.There's no other way he'd leave the Farm
than by knocking off the Bears. But in order to
achieve the upset, the Cardinal need contributions
from every member of the squad, starters and
bench players alike.
"Cal's got a lot of depth, so the three guys on the
bench are going to have to play well," Hopkins said
in reference to Finlayson, junior two-meter de
fender Forrest Schwartz and junior driver Marcel
lo Pantuliano.
Finjayson recognized the critical substitution
responsibilities he, Schwartz and Pantuliano need
to fulfill in order for the Cardinal to end their sea
son on a high note.
"We need to come out and play solid water polo
in support of the starters " Finlayson said. "That
doesn't necessarily mean coming out and scoring a
goal or making a huge play, but it means no break
downs on defense, smart decisions on offense and
focusing on our specific roles."
With a combined team effort and focused ap
proach to each game, the Card know they can take
on any team in the league. Factor in a touch of sen
timental motivation and they'll come out much
tougher.
"If we take care of business one game at a time
then we will be where we want to be at the end of
the year," Finlayson said. "It would be great to give
Peter and Thomas a great last home game on [Sat
urday]. Those guys have done so much for the pro
gram, it would be great to give them a last home
game to look back on. Also, our fans have been so
great this season that we'd like nothing more than
to do them proud and finish up the season unbeat
en at home and then come back from the postsea
son with a national championship trophy."

game to look back on. Also, our fans have been so
great this season that we'd like nothing more than
to do them proud and finish up the season unbeat

The Cardinal face No. 2 California in the Big Splash tomorrow. The game serves as the final tune-up for Stanford before the MPSF
Tournament begins in two weeks. This will also be the last home game for senior captain Peter Varellas.
It's Saturday afternoon — time to jump on
your bike and head across campus to cheer on your
fellow Cardinal as they take on archrival Califor
nia in one of the most important games of the sea
son for both teams. According to national rank
ings, Stanford enters the game as the underdog, but
really the squad that plays with the most spirit,
tenacity and coordination will be the one that ulti
mately claims victory. So you know where you're
headed, right?
You've got it — Avery Aquatic Center at 1 p.m.
for the annual Big Splash showdown between the
Stanford and Cal men's water polo teams.
That 1 p.m. start means more than usual; it
marks the time when senior driver Peter Varellas
launches himself into 1 he game-opening sprint —
the final opening sprinit the graduating captain will
ever make in the Stanford pool that has been his
home for the last four years.
If the Big Splash ma tchups of recent years serve
as any indicator, there will likely be around 3,(XK)
fans on hand for the Card's final regular season
game. Fans should show up well before game time
if they want to stand any chance of finding a spot
where they'll be able to catch a glimpse of the ac
tion.
The No. 3 Cardinal (16-5,5-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) and the No. 2 Bears (19-5,5-2)
both know that they're headed for the postseason
two weeks from now at the MPSF conference tour
nament in Malibu,Calif. But that doesn't take away
from either team's focus on the Saturday afternoon
showdown.
The Stanford men are fully aware of the chal
lenge that their rivals from across the Bay pose. Cal
has established itself as one of the toughest and
deepest teams in the league. So despite the fact
that the Bears are coming off a shaky weekend
during which they lost to top-ranked Southern
California and blew a two goal lead before finish
ing off No. 8 Long Eieach State in overtime, the
Cardinal plan on seeing a full realization of Cal's
potential.
"Man for man, Cal has probably the most talent
ed team in the NCAA.," sophomore two-meter de
fender Peter Finlaysoin said. "We're watching a lot

of tape and working out the kinks of our game plan.
We're also focusing on our play in the defensive end
and having our offense come out of our defense."
Like Varellas. senior captain Thomas Hopkins
plans to make his final appearance at Avery this
Saturday.There's no other way he'd leave the Farm
than by knocking off the Bears. But in order to
achieve the upset, the Cardinal need contributions
from every member of the squad, starters and
bench players alike.
"Cal's got a lot of depth, so the three guys on the
bench are going to have to play well," Hopkins said
in reference to Finlayson, junior two-meter de
fender Forrest Schwartz and junior driver Marcel
lo Pantuliano.
Finjayson recognized the critical substitution
responsibilities he, Schwartz and Pantuliano need
to fulfill in order for the Cardinal to end their sea
son on a high note.
"We need to come out and play solid water polo
in support of the starters " Finlayson said. "That
doesn't necessarily mean coming out and scoring a
goal or making a huge play, but it means no break
downs on defense, smart decisions on offense and
focusing on our specific roles."
With a combined team effort and focused ap
proach to each game, the Card know they can take
on any team in the league. Factor in a touch of sen
timental motivation and they'll come out much
tougher.
"If we take care of business one game at a time
then we will be where we want to be at the end of
the year," Finlayson said. "It would be great to give
Peter and Thomas a great last home game on [Sat
urday]. Those guys have done so much for the pro
gram, it would be great to give them a last home
game to look back on. Also, our fans have been so
great this season that we'd like nothing more than
to do them proud and finish up the season unbeat
en at home and then come back from the postsea
