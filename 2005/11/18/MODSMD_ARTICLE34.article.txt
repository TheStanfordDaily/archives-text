# Cardinal makes the hard work pay off
## Wrestling heads to Fullerton, Calif. for the Cal Open before facing SFSU next Tuesday 
### DENIS GRIFFIN 
While most Stanford students will
kick back and enjoy the extended
Thanksgiving break, the Cardinal
wrestlers plan to soldier on. Satur
day, they are scheduled to take part
in the Cal Open in Fullerton, Calif,
where the team will try to continue
their early season tournament suc
cess.
Then, on TUesday, Stanford hits
the road again to face San Francisco
State, in what will be the second dual
meet of the season for the Cardinal.
Both events present opportunities
for further growth from a promising
team.
"The Cal Open will give us a
chance to see a lot of our conference
opponents," head coach Kerry
McCoy said."Hopefully we'll be able
to see where we measure up against
the rest of the conference and some
other outside teams. It gives us a
chance to perform, get together as a
team and really go out there and get
the job done."
McCoy also recognizes the signif
icance of the team's meet against the
Gators.
"They're going to be a tough
team," McCoy said. "They're a [Div.
ll] program so they're not as highly
ranked as Missouri, per se, but
they're a tough program.They've got
some really good guys on their ros
ter, so we just have to go out there
and keep on rolling to make up for
the loss on Friday in the dual meet
and get ourselves back to even. We
can just keep building from there."
Though the season is still young,
the Cardinal have already shown
their potential, despite a rocky start
at Missouri and some key injuries.
"I like the way that our team has
competed," sophomore wrestler
Scott Loescher said. "I like the way
that we're working hard during prac

tices under our new coach. I like the
way that we've been getting our con
ditioning done."
"We've had a number of injuries,"
Loescher continued. "Imad [Khar
bush. a senior] and Ryan [Hagen, a
senior], our 174 and 184 pounders,
went down. We've had a couple of
other guys get sick. Battling injuries
has been tough,so 1 think we need to
get some guys healthy to really help
our chances."
Loescher praised the efforts of all
of his teammates so far this season,
but went on to single out some who
had done particularly well. He men
tioned senior Ray Blake and sopho
mores Tanner Garder and Josh Zu
panic as contributors who did well
last weekend before highlighting one
Cardinal newcomer.
"I've been really impressed by
Tyler Parker, our 149-pounder,"
Loescher said. "It's his first tourna
ment as a true freshman and he made
the finals. That's really awesome
progress."
After finishing last weekend on a
strong note in the Central Missouri
Open, the Stanford wrestlers have
good cause to be confident in their
abilities. Their hard work thus far
should pay big dividends down the
line.
"I think we're in great condition;a
lot of the matches that we won were
close in the end because we were in
better shape than the other guy,"
Parker said. "We've got a lot of team
unity, too. The meet against Missouri
was really exciting, especially at the
beginning. Everyone got into it."
Of course, the team isn't overcon
fident— just appreciative of what
hard work can earn, and hungry for
more.
"We've got to take it one match at
a time I guess," Parker said. "One of
the guys sent out an e-mail today that
showed us actually getting ranked in
the top 30 as a team, which was pret
ty cool to see."
The season rolls on for the Cardi
nal, who hope to keep rolling right
with it.The next steps come Saturday
at the Cal Open in Fullerton and
TUesday on the road against San
Francisco State.

panic as contributors who did well
last weekend before highlighting one
Cardinal newcomer.
"I've been really impressed by
Tyler Parker, our 149-pounder,"
Loescher said. "It's his first tourna

the finals. That's really awesome
progress."
After finishing last weekend on a
strong note in the Central Missouri
Open, the Stanford wrestlers have
good cause to be confident in their
abilities. Their hard work thus far
should pay big dividends down the
line.
"I think we're in great condition;a
lot of the matches that we won were
close in the end because we were in
better shape than the other guy,"
Parker said. "We've got a lot of team
unity, too. The meet against Missouri
was really exciting, especially at the
beginning. Everyone got into it."
Of course, the team isn't overcon
fident— just appreciative of what
hard work can earn, and hungry for
more.
"We've got to take it one match at
a time I guess," Parker said. "One of
the guys sent out an e-mail today that
showed us actually getting ranked in
the top 30 as a team, which was pret

With first-year head coach Kerry McCoy leading the program, Stanford wrestling hopes fora turnaround in the 2005-2006 season. The Cardinal were im
pressed with their play at Missouri last week and now prepare for two meets over the Thanksgiving break.
While most Stanford students will
kick back and enjoy the extended
Thanksgiving break, the Cardinal
wrestlers plan to soldier on. Satur
day, they are scheduled to take part
in the Cal Open in Fullerton, Calif,
where the team will try to continue
their early season tournament suc
cess.
Then, on TUesday, Stanford hits
the road again to face San Francisco
State, in what will be the second dual
meet of the season for the Cardinal.
Both events present opportunities
for further growth from a promising
team.
"The Cal Open will give us a
chance to see a lot of our conference
opponents," head coach Kerry
McCoy said."Hopefully we'll be able
to see where we measure up against
the rest of the conference and some
other outside teams. It gives us a
chance to perform, get together as a
team and really go out there and get
the job done."
McCoy also recognizes the signif
icance of the team's meet against the
Gators.
"They're going to be a tough
team," McCoy said. "They're a [Div.
ll] program so they're not as highly
ranked as Missouri, per se, but
they're a tough program.They've got
some really good guys on their ros
ter, so we just have to go out there
and keep on rolling to make up for
the loss on Friday in the dual meet
and get ourselves back to even. We
can just keep building from there."
Though the season is still young,
the Cardinal have already shown
their potential, despite a rocky start
at Missouri and some key injuries.
"I like the way that our team has
competed," sophomore wrestler
Scott Loescher said. "I like the way
that we're working hard during prac

tices under our new coach. I like the
way that we've been getting our con
ditioning done."
"We've had a number of injuries,"
Loescher continued. "Imad [Khar
bush. a senior] and Ryan [Hagen, a
senior], our 174 and 184 pounders,
went down. We've had a couple of
other guys get sick. Battling injuries
has been tough,so 1 think we need to
get some guys healthy to really help
our chances."

of his teammates so far this season,
