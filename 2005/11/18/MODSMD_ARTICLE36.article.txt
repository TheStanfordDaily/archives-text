## Stem cell agency fights for grants 
### PAUL ELIAS AP BIOTECHNOLOGY WRITER 
HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) â€” California's embattled
stem cell agency pleaded with a judge to toss out two law
suits that have prevented it from borrowing the money it
needs to dole out $3 billion in research grants.
It's been a little more than a year since voters passed
Proposition 71, which created the California Institute of
Regenerative Medicine, but two lawsuits challenging the
constitutionality of the agency have scared off potential
lenders.
On Thursday, a lawyer with the California Attorney
General's office asked Alameda County Superior Court
Judge Bonnie Lewman Sabraw to throw out the lawsuits
filed by politically conservative interest groups.
"We are here because the voters of this state enact
ed Proposition 71 last November and we haven't been
able to do what the voters asked us to do because we
are locked up in litigation," said Tamar Pachter, a
deputy attorney general, imploring the judge to resolve
the disputes.
Pachter said interest rates have risen 0.5 percent since
the agency was prepared to borrow money, costing the
state an estimated $15 million.
A ruling is expected at a later date.
The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the man

agers of the stem cell agency aren't state officials and
many of them have conflicts of interest because of their
ties to the biotechnology industry, or as employees of
universities that will receive grants.
Stem cell agency officials said its managers would re
cuse themselves from deciding issues that concern their
employers.
One of the lawsuits was filed by the People's Advocate
and the National Tax Limitation Foundation.The group is
represented by the Life Legal Defense Foundation, which
opposes abortion, and unsuccessfully fought in court ear
lier this year to keep a severely brain-damaged Florida
woman alive in a high-profile right-to-die case.
Lawyers for the foundation denied agency charges
that their suit was religiously motivated even though the
group opposes human embryonic stem cell research on
moral grounds.
The foundation argues that since agency board mem
bers are not elected, members aren't state officials and
should be prohibited from doling out public funds.
The second lawsuit was filed by a newly created non
profit called the California Family Bioethics Council,
which describes itself as a stem cell research watchdog
group.
"TTie conflict of interest is built into the selection
process," said David Llewellyn, lawyer of the bioethics
council.
