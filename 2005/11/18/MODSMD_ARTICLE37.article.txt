## White House to split Circuit Court 
### ERICA WERNER ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Bush administration's Justice De
partment is backing efforts by con
gressional Republicans to split up
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
the nation's largest federal appeals
court and the frequent source of
anti-administration rulings.
"The department believes that di
viding the 9th circuit would improve
the administration of justice," Assis
tant Attorney General William E.
Moschella wrote in a letter released
TUesday by Sen. John Ensign. R-
Nev., an advocate of breaking up the
San Francisco-based circuit.
"The sheer size of the 9th circuit
has led to serious administrative dif
ficulties that have adversely affected
its ability to render justice efficient
ly," Moschella wrote.
The letter was addressed to
House Judiciary Committee Chair

man James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
who is pushing legislation to break
up the circuit that covers nine west
ern states, arguing it's too big to be
effective.
Opponents allege political mo
tives by Republicans annoyed by rul
ings, including a 2002 opinion that
declared the Pledge of Allegiance
unconstitutional when recited in
public schools. The Bush administra
tion had maintained the pledge was
not an unconstitutional endorse
ment of religion.
The House GOP is seeking to
fast-track the circuit-split legislation
by making it part of a pending
deficit-cutting bill. That move is
meeting opposition in the Senate,
which didn't include the circuit split
in its version of the budget bill.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
strongly opposes breaking up the cir
cuit, and has enlisted Senate Judicia
ry Committee Chairman Arlen
Specter. R-Pa., to assert his jurisdic

tion over the issue and argue against
including it in the budget-cutting bill.
A Senate Judiciary subcommittee
held a hearing on the issue last
month but the full committee has not
yet considered it.
The 9th Circuit's territory encom
passes about 54 million people, and
the circuit has 28 judgeships. The cir
cuit with the next-largest number of
judges is the New Orleans-based sth
Circuit, with 17 judgeships.
Sensenbrenner's legislation
would create a 9th Circuit covering
California, Hawaii and the Pacific Is
lands, and a new 12th Circuit cover
ing Alaska, Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Ari
zona. A Senate bill by Ensign and
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala., would
accomplish the same split.
Republicans have long sought to
break up the 9th Circuit. The GOP
led House last year approved a split,
but the measure did not get a vote in
the Senate.
