## Bush and Putin meet, discuss terror 
### TERENCE HUNT ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BUSAN, South Korea (AP) â€”
Glossing over differences straining
their political relationship, Presi
dent Bush and Russian President
Vladimir Putin greeted each other
warmly Friday in talks that empha
sized cooperation in the war on ter
ror and the campaign to stop North
Korea's nuclear ambitions.
The two leaders met for more
than an hour. "The dynamic in the
room was very positive, very loose .
.. There was a lot of laughing, a lot
of joking," White House counselor
Dan Bartlett said.
Bush said Russia was a positive
force in six-party negotiations to
persuade North Korea to abandon
its nuclear program in exchange for
energy and security concerns,
Bartlett said. They did not discuss
Bush's eagerness to go to the U.N.
Security Council with suspicions
that Iran is trying to build a nuclear
arsenal, he said.
The two leaders focused on their
joint position that Iran should not
be allowed to use its nuclear pro
gram to make weapons. Bartlett
said the United States supports
Moscow's plan, which would allow
Iran to covert uranium into a gas
that is the precursor to making en
riched uranium. But the enrichment
itself would be done in Russia.
In theory, that would deny Iran
the capacity to produce weapons
grade uranium for nuclear
weapons.
TTie United States has expressed
concerns that Moscow is retreating
from democracy, but Bartlett indi
cated the leaders did not dwell on
that issue. "Our position is well
known on that," he said, saying the
focus was on issues such as trade
and Iran and the Middle East.
Putin has called for tough re
strictions on Western-funded non
governmental groups in Russia.
Bartlett said the issue was "raised
and discussed" but he would not
provide any details.
"Hey Vladimir. How are you?
Looking good," Bush said as the
two leaders began their meeting. "I
always enjoy a chance to have a
good discussion with you. You're
right. We've got a very important re

lationship. We value your advice."
Bush asked Putin if he wanted to
address reporters. Putin said he did
not. Bush shrugged and said, "OK,
me neither." The two leaders then
retreated to seats out of earshot
from reporters.
Far from home. Bush was on the
defensive about Democrats' criti
cism that he had misled the nation
about the need to go to war in Iraq.
He also was confronted with an an
nouncement that South Korea in
tends to bring home about a third of
its 3,200 troops in Iraq next year.
The announcement caught the
White House by surprise, coming in
the midst of Bush's trip here.
"They have not informed the
United States government of that,"
National Security Council
spokesman Frederick Jones said.
At a news conference Thursday,
Bush took issue with his domestic
critics and said it was "patriotic as
heck to disagree with the presi
dent." But he added, "What bothers
me is when people are irresponsibly
using their positions and playing
politics.That's exactly what is taking
place in America."
Friday's meeting was the fifth
between Bush and Putin this year,
following talks in Moscow; Wash

ington; Bratislava, Slovakia, and
Gleneagles, Scotland. Despite their
disputes, they're on a first-name
basis and emphasize their friend
ship, which was strengthened when
Putin stepped forward and support
ed Bush after the terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11,2001.
Bush and Putin met in a hotel
suite before the opening of the an
nual Asia Pacific Economic Coop
eration forum.
Bush met with Southeast Asia
leaders to underscore U.S. interest
in the region, one of the battle
grounds in the fight against terror
ists. Bush was interested in asking
the leaders to exert their influence
on the military junta in Myanmar,
which Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice said was "one of the
worst regimes in the world" for its
record on human rights and free
speech.
Putin has refused to support
Bush in the president's eagerness to
go to the U.N. Security Council with
suspicions Iran is trying to build a
nuclear arsenal. Over U.S. objec
tions, Russia is building a nuclear
reactor fora power plant in Iran, an
$800 million project the United
States fears could be used to help
develop nuclear arms.
