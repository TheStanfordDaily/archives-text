# IT'S CRUNCH TIME
## As Big as it Gets 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Last year's 41 -6 loss at the hands of California in
the 107 th Big Game was one of the most demoraliz
ing defeats in the history of Stanford football. The
Cardinal were outplayed in nearly every facet of the
game and, by the conclusion, the contest had de
volved into what was essentially a padded fist-fight.
A year later, things have changed on the Farm.
Then head-coach Buddy Teevens was sent packing,
the team is far more disciplined and the Cardinal (5-
4, 4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) are on the cusp of
their first bowl berth since 20()1.
Things have changed for the Bears (6-4,3-4) as
well. They came into last year's game ranked No. 4
in the country, on the verge of making their first
Rose Bowl since 1958, and with one of the best
quarterbacks in the country in Aaron Rodgers. To
morrow they'll back into Stanford Stadium with
four losses in their last five games and a highly-tout
ed passer who has had trouble hitting even the most
open receivers.
Regardless the records or expectations, the
108 th Big Game means a tremendous amount for
both clubs.

AFTER NINE
LONG GAMES
AND HOURS OF
HARD WORK...

"It's pretty hard to not pay attention to the
Big Game," Stanford head coach Walt Harris said.
"You can't help hut be focused and excited about
the Big Game."
Of course, it certainly adds to the intensity that
Stanford is sitting on five wins after last week's 20-
17 victory over Oregon State, and that it is just one
victory away from a bowl bid. Cal, who is already as
sured of an invite to a postseason game, needs to
win not only to retain the Axe but to enter the bowl
season with some semblance of momentum.
Adding intrigue to a game already packed with
story lines is the announcement that starting quar
terback Joe Ayoob has been pulled from the start
ing lineup in favor of junior Steve Levy, who played
fullback last season.
Ayoob came to Cal this season with huge expec
tations after he transferred from San Francisco City
College in the offseason, during which he was
named California Junior College Offensive Player
of the Year. He was beat out for the starting job in
training camp by redshirt freshman Nate Long
shore, but Longshore broke his leg in Cal's opener
and Ayoob inherited the job.
