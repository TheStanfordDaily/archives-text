# IT'S CRUNCH TIME
## As Big as it Gets 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
Last year's 41 -6 loss at the hands of California in
the 107 th Big Game was one of the most demoraliz
ing defeats in the history of Stanford football. The
Cardinal were outplayed in nearly every facet of the
game and, by the conclusion, the contest had de
volved into what was essentially a padded fist-fight.
A year later, things have changed on the Farm.
Then head-coach Buddy Teevens was sent packing,
the team is far more disciplined and the Cardinal (5-
4, 4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) are on the cusp of
their first bowl berth since 20()1.
Things have changed for the Bears (6-4,3-4) as
well. They came into last year's game ranked No. 4
in the country, on the verge of making their first
Rose Bowl since 1958, and with one of the best
quarterbacks in the country in Aaron Rodgers. To
morrow they'll back into Stanford Stadium with
four losses in their last five games and a highly-tout
ed passer who has had trouble hitting even the most
open receivers.
Regardless the records or expectations, the
108 th Big Game means a tremendous amount for
both clubs.

AFTER NINE
LONG GAMES
AND HOURS OF
HARD WORK...

"It's pretty hard to not pay attention to the
Big Game," Stanford head coach Walt Harris said.
"You can't help hut be focused and excited about
the Big Game."
Of course, it certainly adds to the intensity that
Stanford is sitting on five wins after last week's 20-
17 victory over Oregon State, and that it is just one
victory away from a bowl bid. Cal, who is already as
sured of an invite to a postseason game, needs to
win not only to retain the Axe but to enter the bowl
season with some semblance of momentum.
Adding intrigue to a game already packed with
story lines is the announcement that starting quar
terback Joe Ayoob has been pulled from the start
ing lineup in favor of junior Steve Levy, who played
fullback last season.
Ayoob came to Cal this season with huge expec
tations after he transferred from San Francisco City
College in the offseason, during which he was
named California Junior College Offensive Player
of the Year. He was beat out for the starting job in
training camp by redshirt freshman Nate Long
shore, but Longshore broke his leg in Cal's opener
and Ayoob inherited the job.

The Cardinal head into tomorrow's Big Game coming off of a victory at Oregon State last weekend. Meanwhile, Cal has lost four of its last five games.

Since then, it has been a rough road for
Ayoob. After entering the game following
Longshore's injury, he threw 10 straight in
completions against Sacramento State. It
didn't get much better from there for
Ayoob, who has thrown 14 interceptions
this season.
Hie situation came to a head last week
end when he was pulled in favor of Levy,
late in USC's 35-10 beat-down of the Bears.
Ayoob threw four picks and only 98 yards in
three-plus quarters of work.
"Confidence and fundamentals, they
both go hand-in-hand," said Cal head coach
Jeff Tedford on his quarterback after the
USC loss." When you start pressing,that be
comes a confidence issue. He's very com
petitive, very tough. But we need to work
harder on fundamentals to hopefully help
him get his confidence back."
It looks as though Ayoob won't have a
chance to get back into a rhythm as it was
disclosed late Thursday that he would be
pulled from the lineup.That announcement
puts enormous pressure on Levy, who has
made just four brief appearances this sea
son and is making his first career start.
While Levy did convert to fullback last sea
son. he was recruited to play quarterback.
The good news for the Bears is that while
their passing game struggles, their ability to
run the ball seems as solid as ever. The tan
dem of sophomores Marshawn Lynch and
Justin Forsett have put up nearly 220 yards
per game on the ground combined.
In last year's Big Game, then-senior J.J.

Arrington stole the show for Cal, rushing
for 169 yards and a score, but Stanford fans
also got a glimpse at Lynch, who as a fresh
man ran for 122 yards on only nine carries.
Stanford is not free of issues when it
comes to the quarterback position, either.
Junior Trent Edwards was forced to leave
last week's game after injuring his non
throwing hand. However, he did not frac
ture or break the hand, and it appears that
he will make his first career Big Game start
tomorrow, yet questions still linger regard
ing his health. If Edwards is unable to play,
the starting job falls to sophomore T.C. Os
trander, who started last year's Big Game
only to get sacked six times.
In his three years as the primary starter
at Stanford, Edwards has yet to start a Big
Game, but he knows that while Stanford is
an underdog, in this matchup, anything can
happen.

Levy gets the nod for Bears

It is a feeling that we haven't had in a
long time, and we're excited to have
that chance to get that sixth win.

â€” TRENT EDWARDS

"It's exciting to be in a situation like
this," Edwards said. "We learned a lot from
that UC-Davis loss. We learned that any
team can beat any team on any given day,
and you have to come ready to play regard
less of the opponent. We learned a lot from
that and have taken that mindset into a lot
of our games."
But with all that is riding on the line for
the Card, they must stay focused and avoid
any of the on-field behavior that marred
last year's game.
"It's definitely a different atmosphere,"
Edwards said. "You can't approach it like any
other game. Stanford Stadium is going to be
full.There's going to be a lot of things on cam
pus going on during the week. That's part of
the territory. But coach Harris has been in sit
uations like this and coached in games like
this. He knows how to handle players and
prepare them for big games like this."
