## On the off-chance you have not had enough Star Wars yet... 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION JEDI MASTER 
Released simultaneously with the spectacu
lar DVD of "Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of
the Sith," the multi-platform video game, "Star

Wars: Battlefront II," is frosting on a very deli
cious, extremely decorated cake. The eye-pop
ping graphics and exciting gameplay are not
only fun to look at, but create the most elaborate
and in-depth Star Wars game to date.
The game follows the adventures/massacres
of the elite squadron of Stormtroopers, called
the 501st, as they travel across the galaxy per
forming services for the Empire. You get to play
as a wide assortment of Stormtroopers, each

with their own specialized weaponry crucial to
achieving goals like securing the beachheads on
the Wookie planet of Kashyyyk or recovering
the stolen Death Star plans. While the story is
not particularly easy to follow if "Battlefront

II" is your first exposure to the Star Wars
universe, if you are in any way familiar with
the story, you will revel in the ability to

shoot, jump and swing your
lightsaber in such a rich vari-

ety of worlds.
"Battlcfront II" is a
game for the fans. In
fact, the legion of sol
diers in the game are
named after a group of
Star Wars fans who dress

in Stormtrooper out
fits and make ap-

pearances at spe
cial events (Think .
your cousin's bar |
mitzvah). As such,
the game takes
some liberties in
tying storylines to-

gether.
However, for
a Star Wars
J

fan,these
gaps

make the
game all the

more appealing. Lu
cas Arts wastes no time with sto
ries about the relationships be-

tween the soldiers, but sticks to the
flashy battles to keep your controller
buttons dancing and your MTV-at
tention-span entertained. Remember
all those short scenes in "Episode

Ill" where we see the Jedi lead
ing troops on an assortment of
alien planets? In "Battlefront
II," Lucas Arts drops you smack
dab in the middle and you get to

weave your way through the laser
fire of the gruesome battles.

One of the coolest features
of the game are the new, added
gameplay modes. Because the

fans begged for it, Lu
cas Arts included the ability
to play as a Jedi. Taking
control of characters like
Ki-Adi-Mundi, Mace

Windu and Shaak Ti is not only de
lectably fun, but their names are also im-

possible to say with a straight face.
If you get tired of shooting droids with
a laser cannon, why not slice them

down with your trusty lightsaber? Un
fortunately, you only get to play as a
Jedi fora limited amount of time since

they tend to die quickly. Most of the game
focuses on the Stormtroopers, so it's a real
treat when you get to use the Force as a
Jedi.

Also a result of fan whining,
missions in space were added. Hop
ping into the cockpit of a T.I.E. fight-

er or a droid bomber divides up the missions and

adds a little variety to
what could have poten
tially been a straight 3rd
person shooter. Dog
fights from the movies
were amazing to watch,
and are even more as
tounding to play in.
For me though, the
real fun wasn't getting to
play through the
"Episode 111" levels or
even playing as a Jedi.
When 1 really started to
geek out was when the
story (voiced by
Temuera Morrison who
played Jango Fett), ex
plained why the
Stormtroopers in the
original trilogy sound

nothing like the clones of the new trilogy. If you
want to know why, play the game.
Afterwards, the game transcended from
"cool" to "Oh my God. that's freaking amazing"
when it places you on the Death Star. Being able
to run around the halls of thai small moon...er, I
mean space station was one of the most nostal
gic moments I've ever had in my gaming career.
For all the drawbacks of the game (short mis
sions, limited Jedi usage and enemies spawning
at inopportune moments), "Battlefront II" de
livers a satisfying gaming experience. If you re
ally want to live and breathe Star Wars, pick up
a copy in a galaxy far, far away. Actually, they
probably have it at Target.

The game follows the adventures/massacres
of the elite squadron of Stormtroopers, called
the 501st, as they travel across the galaxy per
forming services for the Empire. You get to play
as a wide assortment of Stormtroopers, each

with their own specialized weaponry crucial to
achieving goals like securing the beachheads on
the Wookie planet of Kashyyyk or recovering
the stolen Death Star plans. While the story is
not particularly easy to follow if "Battlefront

II" is your first exposure to the Star Wars
universe, if you are in any way familiar with
the story, you will revel in the ability to

shoot, jump and swing your
lightsaber in such a rich vari-

ety of worlds.
"Battlcfront II" is a
game for the fans. In
fact, the legion of sol
diers in the game are
named after a group of
Star Wars fans who dress

in Stormtrooper out
fits and make ap-

pearances at spe
cial events (Think .
your cousin's bar |
mitzvah). As such,
the game takes
some liberties in
tying storylines to-

gether.
However, for
a Star Wars
J

fan,these
gaps

make the
game all the

more appealing. Lu
cas Arts wastes no time with sto
ries about the relationships be-

tween the soldiers, but sticks to the
flashy battles to keep your controller
buttons dancing and your MTV-at
tention-span entertained. Remember
all those short scenes in "Episode

Ill" where we see the Jedi lead
ing troops on an assortment of
alien planets? In "Battlefront
II," Lucas Arts drops you smack
dab in the middle and you get to

weave your way through the laser
fire of the gruesome battles.

One of the coolest features
of the game are the new, added
gameplay modes. Because the

fans begged for it, Lu
cas Arts included the ability
to play as a Jedi. Taking
control of characters like
Ki-Adi-Mundi, Mace

Windu and Shaak Ti is not only de
lectably fun, but their names are also im-

possible to say with a straight face.
If you get tired of shooting droids with
a laser cannon, why not slice them

down with your trusty lightsaber? Un
fortunately, you only get to play as a
Jedi fora limited amount of time since

they tend to die quickly. Most of the game
focuses on the Stormtroopers, so it's a real
treat when you get to use the Force as a
Jedi.

Also a result of fan whining,
missions in space were added. Hop
ping into the cockpit of a T.I.E. fight-

er or a droid bomber divides up the missions and

adds a little variety to
what could have poten
tially been a straight 3rd
person shooter. Dog
fights from the movies
were amazing to watch,
and are even more as
tounding to play in.
For me though, the
real fun wasn't getting to
play through the
"Episode 111" levels or
even playing as a Jedi.
When 1 really started to
geek out was when the
story (voiced by
Temuera Morrison who
played Jango Fett), ex
plained why the
Stormtroopers in the
original trilogy sound

nothing like the clones of the new trilogy. If you
want to know why, play the game.
Afterwards, the game transcended from
"cool" to "Oh my God. that's freaking amazing"
when it places you on the Death Star. Being able
to run around the halls of thai small moon...er, I
mean space station was one of the most nostal
gic moments I've ever had in my gaming career.
For all the drawbacks of the game (short mis
sions, limited Jedi usage and enemies spawning
at inopportune moments), "Battlefront II" de
livers a satisfying gaming experience. If you re
ally want to live and breathe Star Wars, pick up
a copy in a galaxy far, far away. Actually, they
probably have it at Target.


Though small, I am, kick your ass, I will

Playstation 2
Released simultaneously with the spectacu
lar DVD of "Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of
the Sith," the multi-platform video game, "Star

Wars: Battlefront II," is frosting on a very deli
cious, extremely decorated cake. The eye-pop
ping graphics and exciting gameplay are not
only fun to look at, but create the most elaborate
and in-depth Star Wars game to date.
