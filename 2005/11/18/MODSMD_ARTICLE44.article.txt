### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION BALLER 
Every day 1 expect to find news of hell freezing over now that
one of the coolest and most addictive portable titles out right
now is a pinball game. If you don't believe me, I dare you to
check out "Metroid Prime: Pinball" for the Nintendo DS, an
awesome addition to a steadily growing selection of great titles
for the portable platform.
The premise of the game is deceptively simple: "Metroid Pin
ball" mimics in a very broad sense the story line the hit Game
cube game, "Metroid Prime." Samus Aran, the heroine featured
in all the previous "Metroid" titles returns as the ball in this game
(in previous games, she would gain the ability to morph into a
ball to access different areas). There are six "tables" available to
play, and the game progresses by having the player start at one
and run through all the scoring mechanisms, picking up rewards
known as "artifacts" every time a board objective is completed.
Players start out only able to teleport to four initial boards, with
a fifth being opened after 12 artifacts are collected. If the boss on
that board is defeated, then the final board is opened up with fea
tures a simple, yet deceptively hard board for the final boss.

I'm sure by now the biggest
question is, "How the hell can
you have a boss fight in a pin
ball game?" All I can tell you is
not only is it possible, but it's
definitely one of the coolest
features in the game. Boss bat
tles typically have four flippers
on the board, with the object
being to send the ball flying
hard and fast towards the boss.
If the ball hits the boss hard
enough, it causes some dam
age.
Hie hard part is balancing

the ball between hitting the boss and preventing it from falling
into the gutter, while trying to avoid the plethora of attacks sent
out by the boss and its minions. Missiles, shockwaves and bombs
all send the pinball flying erratically in all directions, while caus
ing shield damage (another interesting addition, if Samus gets hit
enough times, she'll blow up and a new ball will be launched).
The second to last boss is a wonderful exercise in multi-track-

ing: up to 5 balls will be on the table simultaneously
and it's in your best interest to keep them alive while
attacking the boss.
Obviously, I love the boss battles the best, but
the rest of the game shines as well. The two non
boss boards feature a more comprehensive and tra
ditional pinball arena, with bumpers, multi-ball and
lots of railings to light up letters and score big points.
Mini-games are excellently integrated that allow
players to take a small break from pinballing to blast
enemies or wall jump for extra balls or artifacts.
Finally, to top it off, the music and graphics for
this game are superb. Remixed tracks from
"Prime," ensue a great soundtrack to listen to while
trying to stay alive. The graphics make this definite-

ly one of the coolest looking pinball simulations ever, with loads
of special effects and just a really great attention paid to the small
details. My only complaint? I wish there were more levels.
With all this, plus wireless multiplayer, time-trials, the inclu
sion of a rumble pack, and the ability to tilt the board by touch
ing the screen (so cool), "Metroid Pinball" is a must-have for any
DS library. Check it out, you might just surprise yourself.
