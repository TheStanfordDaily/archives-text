Not onlflVvou left wondering why the hell
these in Kansas — not exactly a hot
bed of organized crime — but more so. how they
became so morally deprived in the first place.
You know if you're knocking back whiskeys at a
joint called the Sweet Cage on Christmas Eve
that something isn't right. The setup itself is in
teresting. providing some chuckles at the very
start, but ultimately it goes nowhere. The second
half of the movie drops the comedy almost en
tirely as it spirals downward — and not in an en
ticing "Barton Fink" kind of way.
Overlooking the cliched storyline, what real
ly made the film so disappointing was its waste of
great talent. I can understand why Cusack and
Thornton as champions of rich dark comedies
would be attracted to the premise. And to be
fair, they both turn in performances as solid as
can be in roles lacking any sense of development

obviously greasy and devious from the moment
we meet him, even though we're probably sup
posed to trust him initially...l think. Then again
almost everyone in the movie is

greasy and devious.
Still. Connie Nielsen —
known solely for her role as the
soiled sister in "Gladiator." — stars
as the hands-down most obnoxious
character in the movie, maybe in
any movie. Her portrayal of Sweet
Cage owner Renata. an out-of

tales of motion picture history. She's so
unreal that you start to wonder whether her
scenes were shot fora different movie and some
how edited in afterward. Needless to say it's a lit
tle difficult to care about what happens to her.
and the fact that Arglist is taken in by her smoky
phoniness only makes you respect him less.
In the end. Oliver Piatt's boozehound Pete
(Arglist's buddy who is also incidentally married
to his ex-wife, but who cares) is the only remote
ly redeemable member of the cast. His impro
vised lines supply at least 80 percent of the comic
relief, and he even succeeds marginally at mak
ing Cusack likable by the finale. Not an easy task
when you're fall-down drunk for the entire du
ration of a movie.
In sum. the only warmth there is to derive
from"The Ice Harvest" is the knowledge that by
the end you might be just bitter enough to relate
to its ever more bitter and broken characters.
Then again, it would be ill-advised to get at
tached.
