ssively tall, his
hair hastily
Seeming infi-
than his
s, he speaks in
lice and punc
his sentences
with a slow smile ago
nizingly reminiscent
of Lloyd Dobbler.
Ramis, 100. is friendly
and energized, with
the demeanor of ;
everyone's favorite;
high school
teacher. Very fitting
for the man who

end up in his life. It's basically this
sexual bus stop in purgatory.

Q: John, I know that music has
played a huge role in your life
and career; is this true for this
movie?
i JC: Yeah, I gave Harold mixes
to try out for some scenes. I
often run soundtracks in my
head. Music is really the best

way to show the guts and soul of a
character. I'm constantly listening
to music. iTunes is basically the best
invention since the combustion en
gine. I think my iPod was actually in
one of the scenes in the movie ac
cidentally... I use music to think
like a poet. You have to find ways
i to re-inspire yourself.

Q: What are the challenges as
sociated with playing a deeply
flawed, at times morally-bank
rupt character?
OP: It's your job no matter
how flawed the character.
There's this old idea that you
have to imagine your character
up in heaven at the pearly gates

played Igon in "Ghost
busters."

QUESTION: It seems as
though both Oliver and
John were fascinated in the
movie with the idea of the
mob and the influence of
the mafia. What old mafia

making his case to get in. You
have to make that case for
him. You have to take a char
acter who is morally chal
lenged and make his behav
ior understandable. You
have to communicate the

movies would you have wanted to star in | og j c 0 f his or her universe. You can t
and why.' judge the characters that you play.
