## 'Bee Season' eliminated in Round One 
### CHRIS CHAN TAM VO INTERMISSION ALPHABET MASTERS 
The true mark of a good haircut is if it still looks good wet and
unstyled. The same can be said of a film; a truly effective work will
have substance, regardless of how carefully it is groomed. Unfor
tunately, this cannot be said of "Bee Season," the latest adapta
tion from Fox's Searchlight Films. So in an attempt to combine
both form and functionality, we present to you, dear Reader, our
Children's Alphabet of reasons why Richard Gere should stick to
tapdancing and Broadway showtunes.
Bis for the setting of our wondrous movie,
which was originally supposed to be set back East, but the
nasty weather and a limited production budget wouldn't
allow for it. San Francisco, here we come! Being that we're in the
midst of Big Game Week and such, this should be reason enough
to reject the film and its goddamn hippies. Gere plays a Reli-

gious Studies professor who exposes his youngest
daughter to the secrets of Kabbalah. We still

don't know exactly what the "mystic rites
and passages of Judaism" are. On second

thought, there is one hippie worth see
ing — Kate Bosworth, everyone's fa
vorite surfer chick from "Blue

Crush." How does she pull off play
ing an ardent follower of Hare Kr-

ishna named Chali? I have no
idea...

Eis for EIIZV the
star child who seems
to have a knack for
spelling things. And no, she's
not played by Dakota Fan
ning. Although that would be
interesting... do I smell a se
quel?
Eis for Editil\^an
excessive sort of con
trol exercised by di
rectors Scott McGehee and
David Seigel. To say it is

"loosely based" on the book '
by Myla Goldberg would be an
understatement. The screen
play. by Naomi Foner Gyllen
haal, takes such liberties and
lightens the ending so much that
it ruins any emotional whallop
"Bee Season" could have had.

Throw in " Amelie"-esque special effects, such as the sprouting of
ornate flowers (that form the shapes of the letters she spells!)
from Eliza's blouse while she spells the word "cotyledon," and
you'll find even the French laughing at these overwrought at
tempts at art. We'll admit, we couldn't contain our smirks and gig
gles throughout the entire film. Neither could the homeless guy
sitting three rows in front of us.
Sis for IIi tthe central theme of the movie. Not to
toot our own horns, but we both won spelling bees once,
Tam in 4th grade and Chris in Bth grade. Tam misspelled
"vacuum" after a grueling five hours at the district-level, after all
but one competitor (the other representative from her elemen
tary school) had been eliminated. But the desire for pizza won out

over sparkly plastic trophies, so she settled for fourth place by
adding an extra "c" to "recommend."

Eis for E 110 ty or lack thereof. With of
ficial taglines like "Words may define us, but
it's love that connects us" and "Family isn't
just about talking, it's about understanding" this
movie reads like an ABC after-school special. So if
you find yourself mysteriously being able to spell
words, stop now and don't tell anyone! Because if you
do, your older brother will hate you. When he finds
out that he's not daddy's favorite anymore, he will
abandon Judaism for the sheet-wearing Hare Krishna
clan. And your kleptomaniac mommy will start steal-

ing shiny objects again, abandon you, get arrested and be placed

in a mental institution. Best of all,

your emotionally-dead daddy will
try to live vicariously through

your connection to the words
and try to channel the spirit of
God through you.— through
Kabbalah. Given all of this
emotional conflict and drama,
we were surprised to find our
selves unconvinced and un
moved.

There's a scene in
"Family Guy" in which
Chris Griffin, in mid-con-

versation, suddenly
screams, 'Tm...so...awk

the room. I'd estimate
that every five min-

utes or so a character
in "Bee Season"
had the opportuni-

is for
and the most
d e -

pressing sex scene I've ever seen in a movie. Picture this. You're
Richard Gere (you stud, you) and have been practicing your vio
lin for some time, when your wife suddenly barges in and jumps
you. Hot. Here's the twist: her face is riddled with angst, depres
sion, fear and perhaps even a dash of self-loathing. Less hot.
"Hold me," she pleads as you have barely enough time to drop
your Stradivarius (so to speak). Thankfully, a few awkward
thrusts and it's over. There is no gratuitous nudity, nor is there any
groping. I think my new nickname for Gere will be Two Pump.
Ois for
Ov«r
, as in Strongbad's classic "It's Over!"
This definitely characterizes the relief I felt at the end of
the movie. Although part of me was immensely happy
that it was over, another part wondered, "That was it?" I was be

wildered as to how an hour and 44 minutes had passed by without
anything really happening. Even "Seinfeld," a television show
about nothing, has more plot and

character development. Perhaps I'm a
victim of Jerry Bruckheimer and his
attention-span-destroying escapades,
but never have I seen a movie that
dabbled in so many themes yet failed
to convey anything cohesive or mean
ingful.

spelled by an unknown kid
actor named Corey Rateau

in the National Spelling Bee scene. If we had been cast in this
movie, we'd want to be officially credited as "'Ecchymosis'
Speller" and "'Hoodlum's Speller."
In a special post-film Q& A with the directors, we learned a lot
about Scott McGehee and David Siegel. Sorta. "We found her
[Fiora Cross, who plays Eliza Naumann] on a mountain in
Nepal," Siegel deadpanned, when they talked about the cast.
"She's not a Tibetan, she's a little girL.she was just a little weirdo
on the tape she sent us. She would make funny faces, crinkle up
the script, rub it against her head...she really put out in a way that
was infectious." On the emotional impact they wanted for the
film, Siegel (who hogged the microphone) stated, "We were in
terested in four individuals reaching for each other and beyond
themselves."
The directing duo conceded that Goldberg's book had a dark
er ending, and that they had to refashion elements of the story for
a lighter resolution. "We wanted to give a glimmer of hope for the
family," they explained. Deftly avoiding an awkward question
about the casting of director Anthony Minghella's son. Max,
McGehee and Siegel acknowledged that Richard Gere did not
make that much money from the film, and that he was their num
ber one choice for the part of Saul Naumann because "we felt he
could be Jewish," among other reasons. Intermission managed to
sneak in a question, asking, "Do either of you own kaleidoscopes
[a very important object and artistic tool in the film] or do you
have any such objects of significance?"
"I was never superinvested in them," McGehee replied. "But
what David has is one of the world's premier floaty pen collec
tions. We've made them for our last two movies." Pulling it out of
his jacket pocket for good effect, he refused to give it to anyone.
That didn't stop Tam from successfully wheedling it from him af
terwards. So. at least we got a cool promotional floaty pen out of
the deal.


"And those, Eliza, are the birds and the bees. Can you spell 'prophylactic'?"

both form and functionality, we present to you, dear Reader, our
Children's Alphabet of reasons why Richard Gere should stick to
tapdancing and Broadway showtunes.
Bis for the setting of our wondrous movie,
which was originally supposed to be set back East, but the
nasty weather and a limited production budget wouldn't
allow for it. San Francisco, here we come! Being that we're in the
midst of Big Game Week and such, this should be reason enough
to reject the film and its goddamn hippies. Gere plays a Reli-

gious Studies professor who exposes his youngest
daughter to the secrets of Kabbalah. We still

don't know exactly what the "mystic rites
and passages of Judaism" are. On second

thought, there is one hippie worth see
ing — Kate Bosworth, everyone's fa
vorite surfer chick from "Blue

Crush." How does she pull off play
ing an ardent follower of Hare Kr-

ishna named Chali? I have no
idea...

Eis for EIIZV the
star child who seems
to have a knack for
spelling things. And no, she's
not played by Dakota Fan
ning. Although that would be
interesting... do I smell a se
quel?
Eis for Editil\^an
excessive sort of con
trol exercised by di
rectors Scott McGehee and
David Seigel. To say it is

"loosely based" on the book '
by Myla Goldberg would be an
understatement. The screen
play. by Naomi Foner Gyllen
haal, takes such liberties and
lightens the ending so much that
it ruins any emotional whallop
"Bee Season" could have had.

Throw in " Amelie"-esque special effects, such as the sprouting of
ornate flowers (that form the shapes of the letters she spells!)
from Eliza's blouse while she spells the word "cotyledon," and
you'll find even the French laughing at these overwrought at
tempts at art. We'll admit, we couldn't contain our smirks and gig
gles throughout the entire film. Neither could the homeless guy
sitting three rows in front of us.
Sis for IIi tthe central theme of the movie. Not to
toot our own horns, but we both won spelling bees once,
Tam in 4th grade and Chris in Bth grade. Tam misspelled
"vacuum" after a grueling five hours at the district-level, after all
but one competitor (the other representative from her elemen
tary school) had been eliminated. But the desire for pizza won out

over sparkly plastic trophies, so she settled for fourth place by
adding an extra "c" to "recommend."

Eis for E 110 ty or lack thereof. With of
ficial taglines like "Words may define us, but
it's love that connects us" and "Family isn't
just about talking, it's about understanding" this
movie reads like an ABC after-school special. So if
you find yourself mysteriously being able to spell
words, stop now and don't tell anyone! Because if you
do, your older brother will hate you. When he finds
out that he's not daddy's favorite anymore, he will
abandon Judaism for the sheet-wearing Hare Krishna
clan. And your kleptomaniac mommy will start steal-

ing shiny objects again, abandon you, get arrested and be placed

in a mental institution. Best of all,

your emotionally-dead daddy will
try to live vicariously through

your connection to the words
and try to channel the spirit of
God through you.— through
Kabbalah. Given all of this
emotional conflict and drama,
we were surprised to find our
selves unconvinced and un
moved.

and the most
d e -

pressing sex scene I've ever seen in a movie. Picture this. You're
Richard Gere (you stud, you) and have been practicing your vio
lin for some time, when your wife suddenly barges in and jumps
you. Hot. Here's the twist: her face is riddled with angst, depres
sion, fear and perhaps even a dash of self-loathing. Less hot.
"Hold me," she pleads as you have barely enough time to drop
your Stradivarius (so to speak). Thankfully, a few awkward
thrusts and it's over. There is no gratuitous nudity, nor is there any
groping. I think my new nickname for Gere will be Two Pump.

This definitely characterizes the relief I felt at the end of
the movie. Although part of me was immensely happy
that it was over, another part wondered, "That was it?" I was be

wildered as to how an hour and 44 minutes had passed by without
anything really happening. Even "Seinfeld," a television show
about nothing, has more plot and

character development. Perhaps I'm a
victim of Jerry Bruckheimer and his
attention-span-destroying escapades,
but never have I seen a movie that
dabbled in so many themes yet failed
to convey anything cohesive or mean
ingful.

movie, we'd want to be officially credited as "'Ecchymosis'
Speller" and "'Hoodlum's Speller."
In a special post-film Q& A with the directors, we learned a lot
about Scott McGehee and David Siegel. Sorta. "We found her
[Fiora Cross, who plays Eliza Naumann] on a mountain in
Nepal," Siegel deadpanned, when they talked about the cast.
"She's not a Tibetan, she's a little girL.she was just a little weirdo
on the tape she sent us. She would make funny faces, crinkle up
the script, rub it against her head...she really put out in a way that
was infectious." On the emotional impact they wanted for the
film, Siegel (who hogged the microphone) stated, "We were in
terested in four individuals reaching for each other and beyond
themselves."
The directing duo conceded that Goldberg's book had a dark
er ending, and that they had to refashion elements of the story for
a lighter resolution. "We wanted to give a glimmer of hope for the
family," they explained. Deftly avoiding an awkward question
about the casting of director Anthony Minghella's son. Max,
McGehee and Siegel acknowledged that Richard Gere did not
make that much money from the film, and that he was their num
ber one choice for the part of Saul Naumann because "we felt he
could be Jewish," among other reasons. Intermission managed to
sneak in a question, asking, "Do either of you own kaleidoscopes
[a very important object and artistic tool in the film] or do you
have any such objects of significance?"
"I was never superinvested in them," McGehee replied. "But
what David has is one of the world's premier floaty pen collec
tions. We've made them for our last two movies." Pulling it out of
his jacket pocket for good effect, he refused to give it to anyone.
That didn't stop Tam from successfully wheedling it from him af
terwards. So. at least we got a cool promotional floaty pen out of
the deal.


"And those, Eliza, are the birds and the bees. Can you spell 'prophylactic'?"

tunately, this cannot be said of "Bee Season," the latest adapta
tion from Fox's Searchlight Films. So in an attempt to combine
both form and functionality, we present to you, dear Reader, our
Children's Alphabet of reasons why Richard Gere should stick to
tapdancing and Broadway showtunes.
Bis for the setting of our wondrous movie,
which was originally supposed to be set back East, but the
nasty weather and a limited production budget wouldn't
allow for it. San Francisco, here we come! Being that we're in the
midst of Big Game Week and such, this should be reason enough
to reject the film and its goddamn hippies. Gere plays a Reli-

gious Studies professor who exposes his youngest
daughter to the secrets of Kabbalah. We still

don't know exactly what the "mystic rites
and passages of Judaism" are. On second

thought, there is one hippie worth see
ing — Kate Bosworth, everyone's fa
vorite surfer chick from "Blue

Crush." How does she pull off play
ing an ardent follower of Hare Kr-

ishna named Chali? I have no
idea...

Eis for EIIZV the
star child who seems
to have a knack for
spelling things. And no, she's
not played by Dakota Fan
ning. Although that would be
interesting... do I smell a se
quel?
Eis for Editil\^an
excessive sort of con
trol exercised by di
rectors Scott McGehee and
David Seigel. To say it is

"loosely based" on the book '
by Myla Goldberg would be an
understatement. The screen
play. by Naomi Foner Gyllen
haal, takes such liberties and
lightens the ending so much that
it ruins any emotional whallop
"Bee Season" could have had.

Throw in " Amelie"-esque special effects, such as the sprouting of
ornate flowers (that form the shapes of the letters she spells!)
from Eliza's blouse while she spells the word "cotyledon," and
you'll find even the French laughing at these overwrought at
tempts at art. We'll admit, we couldn't contain our smirks and gig
gles throughout the entire film. Neither could the homeless guy
sitting three rows in front of us.
Sis for IIi tthe central theme of the movie. Not to
toot our own horns, but we both won spelling bees once,
Tam in 4th grade and Chris in Bth grade. Tam misspelled
"vacuum" after a grueling five hours at the district-level, after all
but one competitor (the other representative from her elemen
tary school) had been eliminated. But the desire for pizza won out

over sparkly plastic trophies, so she settled for fourth place by
adding an extra "c" to "recommend."

Eis for E 110 ty or lack thereof. With of
ficial taglines like "Words may define us, but
it's love that connects us" and "Family isn't
just about talking, it's about understanding" this
movie reads like an ABC after-school special. So if
you find yourself mysteriously being able to spell
words, stop now and don't tell anyone! Because if you
do, your older brother will hate you. When he finds
out that he's not daddy's favorite anymore, he will
abandon Judaism for the sheet-wearing Hare Krishna
clan. And your kleptomaniac mommy will start steal-

ing shiny objects again, abandon you, get arrested and be placed

in a mental institution. Best of all,

your emotionally-dead daddy will
try to live vicariously through

your connection to the words
and try to channel the spirit of
God through you.— through
Kabbalah. Given all of this
emotional conflict and drama,
we were surprised to find our
selves unconvinced and un
moved.

A is for Au/ku/Xrd
There's a scene in
"Family Guy" in which
Chris Griffin, in mid-con-

versation, suddenly
screams, 'Tm...so...awk
ward!" and bolts out of

the room. I'd estimate
that every five min-

utes or so a character
in "Bee Season"
had the opportuni-

ty to do just
£ that.
is for
and the most
d e -

pressing sex scene I've ever seen in a movie. Picture this. You're
Richard Gere (you stud, you) and have been practicing your vio
lin for some time, when your wife suddenly barges in and jumps
you. Hot. Here's the twist: her face is riddled with angst, depres
sion, fear and perhaps even a dash of self-loathing. Less hot.
"Hold me," she pleads as you have barely enough time to drop
your Stradivarius (so to speak). Thankfully, a few awkward
thrusts and it's over. There is no gratuitous nudity, nor is there any
groping. I think my new nickname for Gere will be Two Pump.
Ois for
Ov«r
, as in Strongbad's classic "It's Over!"
This definitely characterizes the relief I felt at the end of
the movie. Although part of me was immensely happy
that it was over, another part wondered, "That was it?" I was be

wildered as to how an hour and 44 minutes had passed by without
anything really happening. Even "Seinfeld," a television show
about nothing, has more plot and

character development. Perhaps I'm a
victim of Jerry Bruckheimer and his
attention-span-destroying escapades,
but never have I seen a movie that
dabbled in so many themes yet failed
to convey anything cohesive or mean
ingful.
N is for NoctlVfcffcfct,
spelled by an unknown kid
actor named Corey Rateau

in the National Spelling Bee scene. If we had been cast in this
movie, we'd want to be officially credited as "'Ecchymosis'
Speller" and "'Hoodlum's Speller."
In a special post-film Q& A with the directors, we learned a lot
about Scott McGehee and David Siegel. Sorta. "We found her
[Fiora Cross, who plays Eliza Naumann] on a mountain in
Nepal," Siegel deadpanned, when they talked about the cast.
"She's not a Tibetan, she's a little girL.she was just a little weirdo
on the tape she sent us. She would make funny faces, crinkle up
the script, rub it against her head...she really put out in a way that
was infectious." On the emotional impact they wanted for the
film, Siegel (who hogged the microphone) stated, "We were in
terested in four individuals reaching for each other and beyond
themselves."
The directing duo conceded that Goldberg's book had a dark
er ending, and that they had to refashion elements of the story for
a lighter resolution. "We wanted to give a glimmer of hope for the
family," they explained. Deftly avoiding an awkward question
about the casting of director Anthony Minghella's son. Max,
McGehee and Siegel acknowledged that Richard Gere did not
make that much money from the film, and that he was their num
ber one choice for the part of Saul Naumann because "we felt he
could be Jewish," among other reasons. Intermission managed to
sneak in a question, asking, "Do either of you own kaleidoscopes
[a very important object and artistic tool in the film] or do you
have any such objects of significance?"
"I was never superinvested in them," McGehee replied. "But
what David has is one of the world's premier floaty pen collec
tions. We've made them for our last two movies." Pulling it out of
his jacket pocket for good effect, he refused to give it to anyone.
That didn't stop Tam from successfully wheedling it from him af
terwards. So. at least we got a cool promotional floaty pen out of
the deal.


"And those, Eliza, are the birds and the bees. Can you spell 'prophylactic'?"



You like me. You really like me!
