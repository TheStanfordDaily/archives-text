# Harry Potter AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE
## Get your wands and Sharpies ready 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION POTTERHEAD 
If you're reading this while already in line
for "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" at
theAMC Merc ado, that temple and cr\>ptoj
our society, I have one thing to say to you
don't vou dare wipe that Sharpied lighten
ing bolt scar off your forehead and turn
back You'd be missing the best installment
yet in the magical "Potter" franchise.

Translating an over 700-pagc book into
a scant 157 minutes would require a spell
at a pretty impressive Ordinary' Wizarding
Level (the wizard test for those few who
haven't read the boohs yet), and director
Mike Newell must have scored an Out
standing. The first Briton to direct a "Pot
ter" film, Newell doesn't let the home team
down, refusing to be eaten b) the same
trolls as his predecessors, Alfonso Cuardn
(an allerg\> to a coherent ending) and Chris
Columbus (never realizing that books and
film are indeed different media these days).
The result is a bigger, louder, scarier, hipper
and sexier film than any of the previous
three.
The fourth foray into the adventures of
heroic Harry, loveable Ron Weasley and
brainy Hermione Granger starts with the
enchanted grandeur of the Quidditch
World Cup, which is such a spectadc that I
someone could have shouted "jinx!" afterM
Harry and the audience simultaneously, : A
and lustfully, sighed "I love magic."
The ecstas\' is quick to wear off, howev
er, as Death Eaters (think Klan members
dressed in black, wands replacing burning
crosses) descend upon the tournament.
From there, things get only murkier for
Harr\>. Upon arrival at Hogwarts School of

Witchcraft and Wizardry, he learns that the
annual Quidditch Cup has been replaced
by the decennial I riwizard Tournament, a
competition between Hogwarts, the French
femmes fatales of Beauxbatons Academy
and the beefy' Eastern European boys of
Durmstrang Institute, ■£
After Harry is puzzlingly selected to
compete in the I oumarnent along with in
ternational Quidditch sensaticm Viktor

pl\. Not only
must Harry

face the tasks of the tournament — a
breathtaking battle with a Hungarian
Horntail being the most mundane but
also his newfound hormones. (Harry on de
ciding between the prospects of skirmishing
with a dragon or asking a girl to dance: "I
think I'd take the draqon.") All this, of
course is just a preamble to the specter of
coming face-to-face with He Who Must
Not Be Named, otherwise known here as a
not quite scary enough Ralph Fiennes.
"Goblet of Fire" stirs the cinematic cal
dron so well because of the hard choices
Newell makes as director. In choosing ex-
I Kinsive visuals and wiz-bang pacing over a
literary adaptation akin to a 10-part PBS
mini-series seen in the first two "Potter"
flicks, Newell has crafted a real movie. This
of course has its drawbacks: the book's first
150 pages are condensed to 15 minutes on
the screen and entire subplots arp reduced
or eliminated entirely.
The filrrt is, as a result, Mvlully Harry
centric, arid Dapiel Radcliffe finally conies
through with a performance with enough
complodf v to show he has a little more
going for him than Jimmy Stewart's stam
mer. Rupert Grint's Ron is bs charmingly
awkwbrd as always, and Emma Wesson's
Hermione is as cute as a button and at

least twice as sharp as in previous films. The
best addition here is Miranda Richardson
as Rita Skccter, the platinum blonde "Daily
Prophet" reporter who would be at home as
a Rat Pack groupie.
The other, more serious sacrifice "Goblet
of Fire" makes is to let the visual gadgetr\
hamper character development. Indeed,
characterization takes the back of the
broomstick to the more shorn■ aspects of the
movie. The film's best sequence, the Yule
Ball, shines because of the teenage melo
drama dripping from the enchanted walls.
Clueless Harry and Ron juxtaposed against
Hermione doing her best Lolita is priceless
— though the Ball's spooky live band,
which includes two members of Radiohead,
certainly doesn't hurt.
It's a pity wc don't get more of this, of
what it means to be a nascently pubic Harry
Potter. But the magic is still alive, as evi
denced by torches on the Hogwarts walls
that are delightfully and magically on dim
mers. "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"
with its exuberance and bewitching visuals
is the best "Potter" flick to date.

of Fire'
