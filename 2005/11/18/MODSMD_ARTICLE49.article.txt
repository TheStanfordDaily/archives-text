10. Your sister, who loves
Daniel Radcliffe.
9. You, who are fairly neutral
on the subject of Daniel Rad
cliffe.
8. Librarians, who have to
check out the damn book to li
brary patrons everyday yet
never get to read it themselves
because there is a never-end
ing waiting list of cheapskates
who are too cheap to buy it.
7. Conservative Christians
fretting over the witchcraft
and sorcery depicted, who will
then be able to "better ex
plain" why the movie
shouldn't be viewed by others.
0. Witches and sorcerers, who
don't really care about the
naysayers since such individu
als can easily be turned into
toads.
5. Your dorm, which realizes
this is probably a better call
than going to"The Matrix 4."
4. The first three Harry Potter
movies, which all want to find
out what happens to them
selves.
3. Leonard Maltin, who would
never dream of reviewing a
movie he hasn't actually seen.
2. Roger Ebert, who regularly
reviews movies he hasn't actu
ally seen but has nothing bet
ter to do this Friday night de
spite his celebrity status.
1. Martians, who are desper
ately sick of watching "Wel
come Back, Rotter!" re-runs
on TV Land.

5. Learn to play Quidditch
— flying around on a broom
stick is cool enough, but
when you combine it with a
lighting fast aerial mutation
of polo, it just gets even cool
er. What position would I
play? Beater, of course.
4. Master the Polyjuice po
tion — nothing is more per
fect for pranks than looking
and sounding like an entirely
different person. Your room
mate sucks? Drink some
Polyjuice potion then cuss
out his Charms professor and
dump his girlfriend. Bril
liant!
3. Drink butterbcer and fire
whiskey at the Three Broom
sticks — as a young wizard, I
would take full advantage'of
the lowered drinking age.
Although I apologize in ad
vance for any racist com
ments (i.e. "filthy little rnud
blood") that may ensue from
my drunken stupor.
2. Learn the Aveda Kedavra
— So what if it's an unforgiv
able cursc? Sometimes cer
tain greasy haired, slithering
people (who will not be
named for the sake of those
who haven't read "Half-
Blood Princc") just need to
die.
1. Hermione Granger — Say
what you will, but smart girls
are more attractive than
Veela any day of the week.



Hey Ron and Harry! In case you didn't notice, they're twins!


Maggie Smith is a cradle robber.
