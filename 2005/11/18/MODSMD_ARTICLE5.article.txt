# POINT OF VIEW
## Harris set for first Big Game Stanford coach trying to bring the Axe back to Palo Alto for the first time since 2001 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Often forgotten amid the passion of the players and
fans eagerly awaiting this year's Big Game is the tale of
Stanford head coach Walt Harris. For the rookie Cardi
nal leader, the outcome of tomorrow s tilt will add an

important chapter to his reputation and richness to
his personal tale.

Not only do performances in rivalry
games shape and define players and sea
sons, but coaches across the nation put
their legacies on the line come the third
week of November. One needs to look
no further than the California/Stan
ford rivalry of the last three years for
two poignant examples. Cal's Jeff Ted
ford swept the series and was reward
ed with a $10-million five-year con
tract extension this off-season. Mean
while, former Cardinal coach Buddy
Teevens departed the Farm just two
days after last year's 41-6 loss to Cal —
Teevens' third straight to the Bears.
While results outside the Big
Game largely dictated Tedford and
Teevens' respective fates, plenty of
college football coaches across the na
tion are seemingly judged solely on ri
valry games. Consider Texas' Mack
Brown, whose 0-5 mark against Okla
homa the last five years nearly got him
fired, despite a 52-6 record against
everyone else over the same span. An
other coach punished for lack of suc
cess versus his rival is former Ohio
State coach John Cooper, who aver
aged nine wins per season during his
13-year career in Columbus. Too few
of those wins came against arch neme
sis Michigan, however, and, following
the 2000 season. Cooper was fired for
his 2-10-1 mark against the Wolver
ines.
As Ohio State's quarterback coach
in 1995 and 1996, Harris witnessed a
bittersweet moment in Cooper's
tenure, as the Buckeyes posted a 21-2
regular-season record but both losses
came to Michigan. At his next head

coaching position in Pittsburgh, Har
ris closed strong against traditional
rival West Virginia, winning three of
his last five, including a 2004 victory
that propelled the Panthers into the
BCS. This year, at Stanford, Harris
recognizes the added importance of
the Cal rivalry and the additional
focus it demands.
"This is such a big game from a
coaching perspective that I wish we
didn't have to participate in all (these
media appearances]," Harris said. "I
know I was at an Ohio State/Michigan
game and 1 don't remember coach
Cooper talking much about having to
do a lot of these things. I'd rather focus
on getting our team ready."
Indeed, Harris enters this year's
Big Game with familiarity. He was
born and raised in the Bay Area, so his
words on junior quarterback Trent
Edwards' desire to play in Saturday's
game can also be read as his own de
sire to coach in it.
"I'm sure that being a Bay Area
boy has something to do with adrena
line and wanting to play in this game,"
Harris said. "Like a lot of coaches, I
believe the mind is everything."
Many Cardinal fans would also be
surprised to learn that one of Harris'
first coaching jobs came at Cal, where
he led the linebacker corps from 1974

Harris' legacy on the line

to 1977.Though he left Berkeley near
ly 30 years ago, Harris still vividly re
calls Stanford head coach Jack Chris
tiansen being carried onto the field
before the 1974 Big Game, as well as
later contests with Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh and running back
Darren Nelson.
"Unless you're brain-dead it's
pretty hard not to pay attention to
Big Game," Harris said. "[This year,]
the fact that it's a Big Game at our
place, in one of the last games ever in
Stanford Stadium, is a tremendous
honor for our players as well as our
coaches."
As Harris points out, this season's
contest brings added drama, as it is the
last Big Game in the soon-to-be-re
modeled stadium and a Cardinal bowl
bid hangs in the balance. Stanford fans
can only hope Harris and his team
tune out the distractions by kickoff.
The team's work starts tomorrow if it
wishes to restore the Big Game to its
historically lofty perch.
"What you [need] to have a rivalry
is good football teams, and lately Cal
has been the good football team, and
Stanford has not been the good foot
ball team," Harris said. "We have a job
to do to make it a rivalry, and the way
you do that is winning once in awhile.
So far, it hasn't been very good."

Indeed, Harris enters this year's
Big Game with familiarity. He was
born and raised in the Bay Area, so his
words on junior quarterback Trent
Edwards' desire to play in Saturday's
game can also be read as his own de
sire to coach in it.
"I'm sure that being a Bay Area
boy has something to do with adrena
line and wanting to play in this game,"
Harris said. "Like a lot of coaches, I
believe the mind is everything."
Many Cardinal fans would also be
surprised to learn that one of Harris'
first coaching jobs came at Cal, where
he led the linebacker corps from 1974

Harris' legacy on the line

to 1977.Though he left Berkeley near
ly 30 years ago, Harris still vividly re
calls Stanford head coach Jack Chris
tiansen being carried onto the field
before the 1974 Big Game, as well as
later contests with Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh and running back
Darren Nelson.
"Unless you're brain-dead it's
pretty hard not to pay attention to
Big Game," Harris said. "[This year,]
the fact that it's a Big Game at our
place, in one of the last games ever in
Stanford Stadium, is a tremendous
honor for our players as well as our
coaches."
As Harris points out, this season's
contest brings added drama, as it is the
last Big Game in the soon-to-be-re
modeled stadium and a Cardinal bowl
bid hangs in the balance. Stanford fans
can only hope Harris and his team
tune out the distractions by kickoff.
The team's work starts tomorrow if it
wishes to restore the Big Game to its
historically lofty perch.
"What you [need] to have a rivalry
is good football teams, and lately Cal
has been the good football team, and
Stanford has not been the good foot
ball team," Harris said. "We have a job
to do to make it a rivalry, and the way
you do that is winning once in awhile.
So far, it hasn't been very good."

Often forgotten amid the passion of the players and
fans eagerly awaiting this year's Big Game is the tale of
Stanford head coach Walt Harris. For the rookie Cardi
nal leader, the outcome of tomorrow s tilt will add an

important chapter to his reputation and richness to
his personal tale.

Not only do performances in rivalry
games shape and define players and sea
sons, but coaches across the nation put
their legacies on the line come the third
week of November. One needs to look
no further than the California/Stan
ford rivalry of the last three years for
two poignant examples. Cal's Jeff Ted
ford swept the series and was reward
ed with a $10-million five-year con
tract extension this off-season. Mean
while, former Cardinal coach Buddy
Teevens departed the Farm just two
days after last year's 41-6 loss to Cal —
Teevens' third straight to the Bears.
While results outside the Big
Game largely dictated Tedford and
Teevens' respective fates, plenty of
college football coaches across the na
tion are seemingly judged solely on ri
valry games. Consider Texas' Mack
Brown, whose 0-5 mark against Okla
homa the last five years nearly got him
fired, despite a 52-6 record against
everyone else over the same span. An
other coach punished for lack of suc
cess versus his rival is former Ohio
State coach John Cooper, who aver
aged nine wins per season during his
13-year career in Columbus. Too few
of those wins came against arch neme
sis Michigan, however, and, following
the 2000 season. Cooper was fired for
his 2-10-1 mark against the Wolver
ines.
As Ohio State's quarterback coach
in 1995 and 1996, Harris witnessed a
bittersweet moment in Cooper's
tenure, as the Buckeyes posted a 21-2
regular-season record but both losses
came to Michigan. At his next head

coaching position in Pittsburgh, Har
ris closed strong against traditional
rival West Virginia, winning three of
his last five, including a 2004 victory
that propelled the Panthers into the
BCS. This year, at Stanford, Harris
recognizes the added importance of
the Cal rivalry and the additional
focus it demands.
"This is such a big game from a
coaching perspective that I wish we
didn't have to participate in all (these
media appearances]," Harris said. "I
know I was at an Ohio State/Michigan
game and 1 don't remember coach
Cooper talking much about having to
do a lot of these things. I'd rather focus
on getting our team ready."
