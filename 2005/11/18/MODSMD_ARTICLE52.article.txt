## Rocking longer than you've been alive 
### LISA KERNER INTERMISSION BONO 
"Elevation" is not just the name qf a U2 song.
For Bono, charismatic front mm of the 25
year-old Irish rock band U2, "elevation" is also
a state of mind. It is a sensation that U2 achieves
at every concert, a direct and intimate connec
tion forged between the band and its audience.
As the lyrics of their song clearly indicate, "the
goal isel-e-va-tion!"
And clearly they're doing something right,
because for just over two hours in Oakland on
Nov. 8, my feet never touched the
Ever since U2 began playing sold-out shows
in the '80s, their concerts immediately gained

fame for their raw energy, wild spontaneity and
endless interaction with fans. Partially as i result
of their live performances, U2 has even been
christened "the greatest rock'n'roll band in the
world," a title that has endured for dfcades.
Their concerts can be described as giantlcxplo
sions of continuous energy, and as Bon< >, The
Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen J| chan
nel their excitement into their vocals, guitar and
bass riffs or drum beats, the crowd responds with
enthusiasm lhat only fuels the;band's
momentum.
With this legendary reputation, the band is
under tremendous pressure to give the best per
formance of their lives with each succeeding
night. Considering that this was their 95th con-

cert in eight months of
touring across the
United States and Eu
rope, the energy and
passion the band
brought to the stage
was phenomenal and
undeniably magical.
The setlist, dominated
by songs from their
most recent album,
"How to Dismantle an
Atomic Bomb," and
their 1991 album
"Achtung Baby," was
high-energy and per
fectly balanced, cater
ing to both casual and
die-hard fans. The tra
ditional crowd
pleasers, including
"Sunday Bloody Sun
day" and "Where the
Streets Have No

Name," received an electric response from the
audience, while quieter favorites like "One" and
"With or Without You" stunned the fans, fea
turing Bono's gorgeous voice that sent shivers
down their spines.
Bono seemed less animated and energetic
than usual, taking fewer trips out onto the ellip
tical walkway than in previous concerts, but his
voice was 10 times clcarer and stronger than dur
ing the first show at San Jose's HP Pavilion in
April, my very lirst U2 concert experience.
The Edge threatened to steal the show at
times, especially during his spectacular guitar
solos in "Until ttie Fnd of the World" rind "Mir
acle Drug," while bassist Clayton charmed the
females with his adorable and persistent grin.

Even Mullen, the famously shy drummer,
was given a turn in the spotlight during
"Love and Peace or Else," during which A

he pounded his drums from the "ellipse"
that extended out into the fans.
Although the seven 13-foot-long J
LED panels, whose 12.000 spheres of f|
light illuminated the stage and bathed \
the arena in pulsating colors, were

breathtaking, I will most remember Bono 1
pulling a young woman up from the audi- '
ence and proceeding to carry her on his
back across the ellipse, and when he had a

young girl chant the classic "Sunday Bloody \
Sunday" anthem "No more!" into the micro
phone.
As a self-proclaimed obsessive U2 fan (my
senior thesis in high school was a 16-page paper
analyzing the effect of Christianity on U2's
lyrics), I can't deny that there are songs 1 wish
they had played (have they forgotten that the
album "Pop" even exists?), and songs I wish
they hadn't ("Yahweh" just doesn't do it for
me). But when it comes to U2, there's just no

going wrong.
Bono seems to have a supernatural ability to
strike at the emotional core of each audience
membCTTdry eyes at a U2 concert are more un
usual than not. At certain points, the roar of the
' surrounding crowd faded into oblivion, and I
suddenly became the only person in the entire
arena. This overwhelming sense of a private
concert, merged, with the comforting sense of
unity that the company of fellow U2 fans pro
vides. kept us all singing the chorus of the last
ballad long after'the band had exited the stage.
And it's what will always keep us coming back
f or more.


Man, we are cool. Just look at us. Plus, our names definitely trump yours.
