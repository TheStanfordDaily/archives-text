# UMPHREY'S MCGEE ARE AN UNKNOWN BAND THAT CAN JAN
## 
### MATTY SMITH INTERMISSION UMPHER 
Yes, I know what you're wonder
ing: Who in the world is Umphrey?
What is his McGee? And, more im
portantly, can you maintain your sta
tus as a college music snob without
having the slightest clue who they
are? These questions, and more, will
be answered indue time.
Umphrey's McGee is an improvi
sational-rock-jamband out of Chica
go, whose members take pride in live
shows loaded with energy and charac
ter. Their second DVD release,
"Wrapped Around Chicago," docu
ments their Dec. 31,2004 New Year's
Eve concert and tries to capture the
live spint of the band. For the most

part, it succeeds, but greater focus and
tighter editing could have elevated
what is essentially a standard concert
DVD to a much higher plane.
The concert stretches across two
discs. Most of the problems lie on the
first, and. conveniently enough, the
band's opening song "Divisions"
sums up most of the flaws with the
performance. The song starts off
catchy enough, boding well for the
rest of the show â€” until the band goes
into the "jam" portion of their perfor
mance. The result? A repetitive song
that's about 15 minutes too long.
The rest of the hour-and-a-half
long disc continues that way, with laid
back grooves and catchy riffs contend
ing for stage time with forgettable,
meandering, sleep-inducing scat. It

doesn't help that much of the time the
band lacks charisma; for the most part,
the members seem averse to making
any sort of facial expressions or ges
tures throughout their show.
If one makes it through the 90 min
utes of the first disc without packing it
in for the night, however, they're in
fora real treat when they pop in the
second disc. Beginning with the sec
ond-half opener, a cover of The
Band's "Ophelia," a newfound ener
gy and sense of direction are present,
and by the time the group comes to
their cover of Peter Gabriel's
"Sledgehammer," they've really hit
their stride.
Their original songs are well-writ
ten and lively, and finally we get to see
why the group works so well as a live

band. Of course, they do wander off
into the forest of improv once in a
while, but the overall tightness of the
second half makes these interludes
far more listenable.
In case the three McGee fans out
there are upset with my critique of the
"jam" style: yes, I'm well aware that
really long instrumental solos and im
provised lines are a huge part of what
makes jamband music work. It's just
that McGee's prewritten stuff is so
much better than their improvisation
al bits that every 15 minute jam ses
sion becomes an endurance test in
wait for the next well-written, undeni
ably enjoyable part. The group has all
the makings of a really strong album
band, but their attachment to the jam
rock style in the vein of Phish keeps

them from realizing their potential for
universal appeal.
The concert DVD is also an ex
tremely tricky business. Capturing the
excitement of a live show on a DVD.
especially when the production bud
get is limited, is extremely difficult.
There are also few bands able to
muster the amount of live energy re
quired fora great concert DVD.
Umphrey's McGee s "Wrapped" is a
good DVD, to be sure, and fans most
certainly won't be disappointed. But if
the performance could have been
packed into one single-disc, two-hour
show, and if the members on stage had
put a little more effort into looking
like they were having fun, a standard
show could have turned out to be a
rockin' one.
