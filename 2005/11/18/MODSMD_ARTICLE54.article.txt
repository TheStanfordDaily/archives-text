## We made Steve Carell laugh 
### VICTOR FUSTE CAMILLE RICKETTS INTERMISSION OFFICERS 
I recently sat down with mega superstar Steve
Carell fora Q&A session. The conference call from
New York City promoted the NBC sitcom, "The
Office " and was one of the single most gratifying ex
periences of my life. Granted, like a piglet shoving
his way to the teat, I had to fight fora turn to ask
questions among the other rabid journalists, but I
can humbly say that the few question I managed to
slip in were some of the most insightful, magnificent
and..dare I say?...brilliant questions ever asked in an
inter\'iew. Ever. Read on and revel in his glory.

Intermission: The "Office" shows the commercial
istic/materialistic nature of modern day corporate

America. Do you think the
show provided you with the
skills that if you were given a
hatchet and a piece of flint,
you could survive in the
Yukon wilderness?
Steve Carell: 1 think that is the
only thrust of the show. That's
really all the show lias hoped
to achieve. To be able to teach
people how to survive in the
wilderness. If you just watched
five minutes of one episode,
you have enough survival
skills to, um..l would say climb
Everest. But, that goes with
out saying. I think most situa
tion comedies on the major
networks will give you the
same valuable life lessons.
Honestly [chuckles as if he's
thinking, "What the hell?"], I

think our show just tries to make people laugh. If
anyone takes any sort of greater lesson from it,
then perhaps you've been watching too much tele
vision.
INT: You might have a point there. Thanks.
SC: [Laughs.] "'Writer's note: That's right, I made
Steve Freaking Carell laugh.*
0: What single gem of advise do you have for em
barrassingly old virgins eveiywhere
SC: Untm...boy. A single gem of advice? [uncom
fortable silence] Ummm...keepon truckin'?
Q: [Laughs]
SC: You know, that movie...there were "Virgin"
websites started relating to the movie and it caused
a bit of an uproar in terms of bringing middle-age
virginity to the forefront and it certainly wasn 't our
agenda in anyway. We just wanted to write a funny
movie that might have a heart or a charm to it. But
in terms of making any sort of political statement
about virginity, that was not our agenda in any way,

shape or form. Even jokingly, I can't even speak to
people who are middle-aged virgins. I have no idea
what I would say. 1 would say I hope they enjoyed
the movie.
Q: If you could do college all over again, what
would you different this time around?
SC: Wow. [Pauses to think] You know what? I kind
of liked the way I did college in the sense that I re
ally saw as a sort of kid in a candy store. I tried to
take advantage of every opportunity I could. 1
don't really have any regrets that way. 1 did my fair
amount of studying. I did my fair amount of party
ing. I did what I wanted to do. I don't think I would
have done anything more or less. And that includes
studying and drugs and sex. I think 1 did about

enough of each of them.
INT: I am really curious as
to what you were like as a
child. What were you like in
Kindergarten?
SC: I don't think I was a
class clown, I was kind of
quiet. There's one thing I do
remember from Kinder
garten — and 1 don't know
if this is a depiction of who I
was at all — its just a mem
ory. 1 was walking along the
edge of the sandbox and I
fell. But I fell on top of the
sandbox with my legs in a
split. So I had to go to the
nurse — I don't even know
why I'm telling you this —
with a cut, a boo-boo, on my
private parts. And it was

one of the most traumatic moments of my life and
obviously one that stayed with me.
Q: Where did you get the inspiration for your
Michael Scott character fin "The Office"]?
SC: The inspiration came from a conglomeration
of every boob and idiot that I've met in my life.
Certain teachers and bosses that I've had, but I
think everybody knows somebody like Michael
Scott in that he's a guy who doesn't understand
how other people perceive him. If you don't know
a Michael Scott, you are a Michael Scott. And that
is a scary thought.
Q: If you and Ricky Jervis were to get into a fight,
what weapon would you choose from around the
office?
SC: I would have a stapler and I would try to staple
him with it. And he would have a three hole punch
and he would be trying to punch holes in that web
of skin between my thumb and my forefinger. That

picture of Steve Carell in your shrine to him.
would be the extent of our fight. It
would be bloody. It would be a
bloody awful mess. The worst. They
could put that on PAY-PER-VIEW
and earn millions of dollars. Because
who wouldn't want to see that fight?
INT: Oh they have, I especially en
joyed that last one. Where in mythol
ogy did you get the inspiration for the
spiritually profound character of
"Brick Tamland" in Anchorman?
SC: You know what Brick is? Brick is
the minotaur. Because I don't think
everyone completely understands
the minotaur and what his signifi
cance is because he's sort of half
man/half-beast in a way. I think Brick
is mostly beast and partly man. I don't
know what I'm talking about. I think
there's a little bit of Brick in every
body. I don't think he's necessarily
mythological.

INT: Was that actually you riding the
bear?
SC: Oh God no. You know what?
They had a professional bear rider.
That's what the guy does fora living.
They superimposed my face over
him. But when someone who does it
professionally looks like he's about to
pee his pants he's so scared before he
gets on the bear, that's a really bad
sign. You know? That even a profes
sional bear guy doesn't know if he's
going to die that day. That same day,
working with the bears, one of them
charged Christina Applegate. That
was the end of the actors interacting
with the bears. The bears were
grumpy because they should have
been hibernating. So they were a little
pissed off about the whole shooting
schedule. You won't find me on a
bear anytime soon.

would be the extent of our fight. It
would be bloody. It would be a
bloody awful mess. The worst. They
could put that on PAY-PER-VIEW
and earn millions of dollars. Because
who wouldn't want to see that fight?
INT: Oh they have, I especially en
joyed that last one. Where in mythol
ogy did you get the inspiration for the
spiritually profound character of
"Brick Tamland" in Anchorman?
SC: You know what Brick is? Brick is
the minotaur. Because I don't think
everyone completely understands
the minotaur and what his signifi
cance is because he's sort of half
man/half-beast in a way. I think Brick
is mostly beast and partly man. I don't
know what I'm talking about. I think
there's a little bit of Brick in every
body. I don't think he's necessarily
mythological.

INT: Was that actually you riding the
bear?
SC: Oh God no. You know what?
They had a professional bear rider.
That's what the guy does fora living.
They superimposed my face over
him. But when someone who does it
professionally looks like he's about to
pee his pants he's so scared before he
gets on the bear, that's a really bad
sign. You know? That even a profes
sional bear guy doesn't know if he's
going to die that day. That same day,
working with the bears, one of them
charged Christina Applegate. That
was the end of the actors interacting
with the bears. The bears were
grumpy because they should have
been hibernating. So they were a little
pissed off about the whole shooting
schedule. You won't find me on a
bear anytime soon.
I recently sat down with mega superstar Steve
Carell fora Q&A session. The conference call from
New York City promoted the NBC sitcom, "The
Office " and was one of the single most gratifying ex
periences of my life. Granted, like a piglet shoving
his way to the teat, I had to fight fora turn to ask
questions among the other rabid journalists, but I
can humbly say that the few question I managed to
slip in were some of the most insightful, magnificent
and..dare I say?...brilliant questions ever asked in an
inter\'iew. Ever. Read on and revel in his glory.

Intermission: The "Office" shows the commercial
istic/materialistic nature of modern day corporate

America. Do you think the
show provided you with the
skills that if you were given a
hatchet and a piece of flint,
you could survive in the
Yukon wilderness?
Steve Carell: 1 think that is the
only thrust of the show. That's
really all the show lias hoped
to achieve. To be able to teach
people how to survive in the
wilderness. If you just watched
five minutes of one episode,
you have enough survival
skills to, um..l would say climb
Everest. But, that goes with
out saying. I think most situa
tion comedies on the major
networks will give you the
same valuable life lessons.
Honestly [chuckles as if he's
thinking, "What the hell?"], I

think our show just tries to make people laugh. If
anyone takes any sort of greater lesson from it,
then perhaps you've been watching too much tele
vision.
INT: You might have a point there. Thanks.
SC: [Laughs.] "'Writer's note: That's right, I made
Steve Freaking Carell laugh.*
0: What single gem of advise do you have for em
barrassingly old virgins eveiywhere
SC: Untm...boy. A single gem of advice? [uncom
fortable silence] Ummm...keepon truckin'?
Q: [Laughs]
SC: You know, that movie...there were "Virgin"
websites started relating to the movie and it caused
a bit of an uproar in terms of bringing middle-age
virginity to the forefront and it certainly wasn 't our
agenda in anyway. We just wanted to write a funny
movie that might have a heart or a charm to it. But
in terms of making any sort of political statement
about virginity, that was not our agenda in any way,

shape or form. Even jokingly, I can't even speak to
people who are middle-aged virgins. I have no idea
what I would say. 1 would say I hope they enjoyed
the movie.
Q: If you could do college all over again, what
would you different this time around?
SC: Wow. [Pauses to think] You know what? I kind
of liked the way I did college in the sense that I re
ally saw as a sort of kid in a candy store. I tried to
take advantage of every opportunity I could. 1
don't really have any regrets that way. 1 did my fair
amount of studying. I did my fair amount of party
ing. I did what I wanted to do. I don't think I would
have done anything more or less. And that includes
studying and drugs and sex. I think 1 did about

enough of each of them.
INT: I am really curious as
to what you were like as a
child. What were you like in
Kindergarten?
SC: I don't think I was a
class clown, I was kind of
quiet. There's one thing I do
remember from Kinder
garten — and 1 don't know
if this is a depiction of who I
was at all — its just a mem
ory. 1 was walking along the
edge of the sandbox and I
fell. But I fell on top of the
sandbox with my legs in a
split. So I had to go to the
nurse — I don't even know
why I'm telling you this —
with a cut, a boo-boo, on my
private parts. And it was

one of the most traumatic moments of my life and
obviously one that stayed with me.
Q: Where did you get the inspiration for your
Michael Scott character fin "The Office"]?
SC: The inspiration came from a conglomeration
of every boob and idiot that I've met in my life.
Certain teachers and bosses that I've had, but I
think everybody knows somebody like Michael
Scott in that he's a guy who doesn't understand
how other people perceive him. If you don't know
a Michael Scott, you are a Michael Scott. And that
is a scary thought.
Q: If you and Ricky Jervis were to get into a fight,
what weapon would you choose from around the
office?
SC: I would have a stapler and I would try to staple
him with it. And he would have a three hole punch
and he would be trying to punch holes in that web
of skin between my thumb and my forefinger. That
