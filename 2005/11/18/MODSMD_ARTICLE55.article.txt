### JEREMY JACOBS INTERMISSION BLONDE MAGNET 
Last Sunday, I, along with other
college journalists, had the opportuni
ty to chat with Charlize Theron about
her upcoming film "Aeon Flux." The
film, due to he released Dec. 2, is the
film adaptation of Peter Chung's sci-fi
cartoon that aired late night on MTV. It
follows Theron as Flux, an expertly
trained operative, as she seeks to de
stroy an oppressive government 400
years in the future. Judging from the
trailer, there is little to fault in this film:
gravity-defying stunts, well-choreo
graphed fight scenes, fantastic visuals
and the gorgeous Theron. She sat
down with us to discuss the selection of
her first sci-fi role, it's grueling physical
demands and why the film is more rel
evant today than it might initially seem.
Q: Did you ever meet with "Aeon
Flux" creator Peter Chung? Did you
watch the MTV show? Since it's sci-

ence fiction, a genre you're new to, what
did you do differently to prepare for the
character?
Charli/e Theron: I did meet with Peter
and he also came onto the set. This was his
baby so we wanted to keep him involved.
He obviously came up with this creation
and this woman so I wanted him to be
happy. I wanted him to feel like we were
being authentic to what he created. No, I
didn't (watch the show]. 1 was raised in
South Africa; we didn't have MTV in
South Africa so 1 never knew about the
show. When the offer came through 1
rented a couple of tapes and started
watching it and really liked it. I thought it
was really edgy and different... kind of a
female superhero.
Q: How did the fact that you and karyn
Kusama were new to the science fiction
genre effect the film's production?
CT: I think the studio took a chance on
both of us. There's something that I like
about studios giving directors who come
from a character background, the way
Karyn did with "Girlfight," the chance to
do these kinds of films. I find that an ele
ment of humanity is often missing in these
kind of stories and that so much focus gets
placed on just the visual and futuristic as
pect that the human core of it is always
lost.
Q: How difficult is it for you to change
your body so often for your roles?
CT: It's challenging, but its part of the chal

lenge that I like. A huge part of this film for
me was the physical aspect and I said pret
ty early on that I didn't want to just be in a
gym and change my body to look a certain
way. 1 really wanted to go and learn these
skills. So what happened to my body was
really secondary. 1 wanted to go learn gym
nastics. and I wanted to learn Capoeira,
and I wanted to actually do these things
versus just making my body look like I
could do them but I couldn't. So my body
just naturally changed and at the same time
I learned incredible skills. I became a gym
nast on this film.
Q: You're known for presenting strong
social commentary in your roles. Do you
feel this story comments on our current
political situation in any way?
CT: Very much. The whole film is really
about questioning your government. 1
think that right now... the majority of
America is doing that. So 1 think it's a very
relevant film. It's [about] not being blind
sided and just sitting back and thinking
everything is fine. [It's about] really tak
ing a stance and asking questions about
what your government is doing. That's re
ally what Aeon does. Aeon is that quin
tessential character who stands up against
the government and doesn't give in. She
doesn't live in a gilded cage and just stay
quiet. She's not okay with that and she be
lieves in the freedom of speech and indi
vidual rights. So it's really quite shocking
how... a film that takes place 4(X) years in
the future is very relevant today.

ty early on that I didn't want to just be in a
gym and change my body to look a certain
way. 1 really wanted to go and learn these
skills. So what happened to my body was
really secondary. 1 wanted to go learn gym
nastics. and I wanted to learn Capoeira,
and I wanted to actually do these things
versus just making my body look like I
could do them but I couldn't. So my body
just naturally changed and at the same time
I learned incredible skills. I became a gym
nast on this film.
Q: You're known for presenting strong
social commentary in your roles. Do you
feel this story comments on our current
political situation in any way?
CT: Very much. The whole film is really
about questioning your government. 1
think that right now... the majority of
America is doing that. So 1 think it's a very
relevant film. It's [about] not being blind
sided and just sitting back and thinking
everything is fine. [It's about] really tak
ing a stance and asking questions about
what your government is doing. That's re
ally what Aeon does. Aeon is that quin
tessential character who stands up against
the government and doesn't give in. She
doesn't live in a gilded cage and just stay
quiet. She's not okay with that and she be
lieves in the freedom of speech and indi
vidual rights. So it's really quite shocking
how... a film that takes place 4(X) years in
the future is very relevant today.


We are not the ones objectifying Charlize
Theron here. But feel free to cut her out and use
her as such.
Last Sunday, I, along with other
college journalists, had the opportuni
ty to chat with Charlize Theron about
her upcoming film "Aeon Flux." The
film, due to he released Dec. 2, is the
film adaptation of Peter Chung's sci-fi
cartoon that aired late night on MTV. It
follows Theron as Flux, an expertly
trained operative, as she seeks to de
stroy an oppressive government 400
years in the future. Judging from the
trailer, there is little to fault in this film:
gravity-defying stunts, well-choreo
graphed fight scenes, fantastic visuals
and the gorgeous Theron. She sat
down with us to discuss the selection of
her first sci-fi role, it's grueling physical
demands and why the film is more rel
evant today than it might initially seem.
Q: Did you ever meet with "Aeon
Flux" creator Peter Chung? Did you
watch the MTV show? Since it's sci-

ence fiction, a genre you're new to, what
did you do differently to prepare for the
character?
Charli/e Theron: I did meet with Peter
and he also came onto the set. This was his
baby so we wanted to keep him involved.
He obviously came up with this creation
and this woman so I wanted him to be
happy. I wanted him to feel like we were
being authentic to what he created. No, I
didn't (watch the show]. 1 was raised in
South Africa; we didn't have MTV in
South Africa so 1 never knew about the
show. When the offer came through 1
rented a couple of tapes and started
watching it and really liked it. I thought it
was really edgy and different... kind of a
female superhero.
Q: How did the fact that you and karyn
Kusama were new to the science fiction
genre effect the film's production?
CT: I think the studio took a chance on
both of us. There's something that I like
about studios giving directors who come
from a character background, the way
Karyn did with "Girlfight," the chance to
do these kinds of films. I find that an ele
ment of humanity is often missing in these
kind of stories and that so much focus gets
placed on just the visual and futuristic as
pect that the human core of it is always
lost.
Q: How difficult is it for you to change
your body so often for your roles?
CT: It's challenging, but its part of the chal

lenge that I like. A huge part of this film for
me was the physical aspect and I said pret
ty early on that I didn't want to just be in a
gym and change my body to look a certain
way. 1 really wanted to go and learn these
skills. So what happened to my body was
really secondary. 1 wanted to go learn gym
nastics. and I wanted to learn Capoeira,
and I wanted to actually do these things
