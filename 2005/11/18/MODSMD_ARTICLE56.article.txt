## Roxy's open letter to cal kids: why try? 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Dear Weenie... I mean
you poor unfortunate soul
who goes to Cal,
You might occasional
ly win on the field, but we
all know who's champ be
tween the sheets. Let
Roxy count the ways...
Difference #1:
Fucking a Cal student is
fucking the amorphous
blob in the before shot of a
Jenny Craig, Bowflex, or
hair removal ad.

Sleeping with a Stanford
student is sleeping with the gorgeous model in the
after shot.
Difference #2:
Sleeping with a Stanford student is like making

sweet love to Anna Kor
nakova.
Fucking a Cal co-ed is like,
well, doing (Roxy doesn't
think you can call it sweet
love) Anna Nicole Smith.
Difference #3:
Fucking a Cal student is like
locking lips with a joint, pos
sibily the unsexiest drug
known to man.
Sleeping with a Stanford
student is like kissing a guy
from one of the hottest
male student bodies in the
country, from no less an au
thority than Playboy Maga
zine.

Difference #4:
Even if, by some freak occurrence, the actual
fucking of a Cal student is great, just wait until
she gets talking about women's lib afterwards.
Here at Stanford, women know what the word
"razor" means.

Difference
#5:
Cardinal is
the color of
passion
and love.
Blue is the

color of a whale, or what
most Cal girlfriends
look like in lingerie.

Difference #6:
Fucking a Cal stu
dent? Missionary,
missionary, mis
sionary. Your
grandparents prob
ably make sweeter
whoopee. Pat
Robertson just
called. He wants
you to be more
sexually adventur
ous.
Stanford's sexual
positons? Well,
we call it the Farm
fora reason. Dog-

There s no denying Hoover
Tower. It's just that dead sexy.

gie? Froggie? Millipede?
Flamingo? Truly, it's all right
now.

Difference #7:
You think you're fucking

a Cal student, hut it's ac
tually the homeless guy
on Telegraph.
Here at Stanford, we
don't sleep in our own
piss.

Difference #8:
The romantic view out
the window at Cal? Just a
concrete bunker of a
dorm and maybe that
same homeless guy on
Telegraph if you're lucky.
Stanford's scenery? Oh,
just Spanish-influenced
architectures, stunning
sunsets, foothills, palm
trees. Not to mention Pi
Phi.
Difference #9:
Here at Stanford, we ac
tually know our partners'
names. We even run into
each other from time to
time.
Hey Weenie, when's the

last time you saw #26304?
Difference #10:
Hoover Tower — 285 feet.
Campanile — 307 feet. Can you spell "compen
sating"?
Oh, nevermind, you go to Cal, which auto
matically means any sensible advice Roxy dis
penses will go in one ear and right out the other.
Better luck in your next life!
XOXO,
Roxy Sass


I wonder what his mother thinks of his
new 100k... oily.



Does this robe make me look
fat?
