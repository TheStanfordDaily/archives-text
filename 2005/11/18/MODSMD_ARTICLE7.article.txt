## Poultry outbreaks reported Chinese leaders react to bird flu 
### AUDRA ANG ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BEIJING (AP) — Health workers arrived 30 minutes
after Qin Zhijun reported finding dead chickens. Within
11 hours, tests confirmed it was bird flu and his flock of
7,000 birds was destroyed.
Then China's normally slow, secretive government
did something even more unusual. Instead of imposing
an information blackout, it flew foreign reporters to the
northern region of Inner Mongolia to meet Qin and see
his farm.
In contrast to its sluggish, widely criticized response to
severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, China has re
acted quickly to recent bird flu cases and released infor
mation with unprecedented swiftness.
"I think the government realized what the problems
with not be being open can bring," John Mackenzie, an
Australian disease specialist who helped investigate
S ARS, said Thursday.
The government reported two new outbreaks in poul
try Thursday, the 12th and 13th since Oct. 19. A day earli
er, the Health Ministry announced it had confirmed the
first human cases of the virulent HSNI strain of bird flu _
a 24-year-old woman who died and a 9-year-old boy who
recovered. It said the boy's 12-year-old sister, who died,
was a suspected case.
During the early days of SARS. the government re
fused to release any details about the disease, feeding ru
mors and public fear.
Its attitude began to change after the communist lead
ership was sharply criticized abroad. The government set
up a disease-warning network and promised to be open
and cooperative.
In recent weeks, anti-bird flu measures have been im
posed on an almost unimaginable scale in a country with
1.3 billion people and 14 billion chickens, ducks and
other poultry.
Health officials have slaughtered millions of chickens.
Live poultry sales are banned. China's chief veterinary of
ficial says all poultry will be vaccinated. People are quar
antined and monitored by the thousands.
"We swiftly enacted our emergency plan and took a se
ries of preventive measures to put the epidemic under

control within the shortest possible time," said Li Bohong,
the Communist Party representative in the district where
Qin's poultry farm is located.
State media that took months to start reporting on
SARS run daily coverage of anti-flu efforts.
The official Xinhua News Agency sends urgent dis
patches on each newly reported outbreak. The Agricul
ture Ministry has short videos on bird flu prevention on
its Web site.
"The Chinese government has taken a very responsible
attitude," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao.
"It is not necessary for us to cover up."
Despite such promises of openness, the govern
ment still tries to control information about out
breaks. Local officials often refuse to answer re
porters' questions.
From Chinese leaders to village officials, all proclaim
their dedication to stopping the virulent HSNI virus,
which has infected at least 126 people in Asia, killing at
least 64 of them, since 2003.
Premier Wen Jiabao warned last week that China faced

an "arduous task."
On Thursday, he urged officials not to be complacent.
"In 2003, we triumphed over S ARS," Wen was quoted
as saying on state television. "It shows that we will triumph
over bird flu as well."
The same attention that went into detecting human dis
eases after S ARS wasn't given to monitoring outbreaks in
animals, said Linfa Wang of the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory.
"They weren't ready to lift animal health to the level of
human health," said Wang, a member of a WHO team that
searched southern China two years ago for animals carry
ing the SARS virus.
"The infrastructure is not ready to handle a major dis
ease outbreak," he said. "The human area is way ahead of
the animal health area."
A key problem was a typical lack of communication
among China's insular bureaucracies, Wang said.
The health and agriculture ministries failed to cooper
ate on bird flu outbreaks until ordered by the senior Chi
nese leadership to do so this fall, the experts said.

as saying on state television. "It shows that we will triumph
over bird flu as well."
The same attention that went into detecting human dis
eases after S ARS wasn't given to monitoring outbreaks in
animals, said Linfa Wang of the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory.
"They weren't ready to lift animal health to the level of
human health," said Wang, a member of a WHO team that
searched southern China two years ago for animals carry
ing the SARS virus.
"The infrastructure is not ready to handle a major dis
ease outbreak," he said. "The human area is way ahead of
the animal health area."
A key problem was a typical lack of communication
among China's insular bureaucracies, Wang said.
The health and agriculture ministries failed to cooper
ate on bird flu outbreaks until ordered by the senior Chi
nese leadership to do so this fall, the experts said.

The medical community in China has been working in tandem with the nation's government to combat the spread of
the fatal bird flu. The leaders have shared information much more freely than they did during the SARS epidemic.
BEIJING (AP) — Health workers arrived 30 minutes
after Qin Zhijun reported finding dead chickens. Within
11 hours, tests confirmed it was bird flu and his flock of
7,000 birds was destroyed.
Then China's normally slow, secretive government
did something even more unusual. Instead of imposing
an information blackout, it flew foreign reporters to the
northern region of Inner Mongolia to meet Qin and see
his farm.
In contrast to its sluggish, widely criticized response to
severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, China has re
acted quickly to recent bird flu cases and released infor
mation with unprecedented swiftness.
"I think the government realized what the problems
with not be being open can bring," John Mackenzie, an
Australian disease specialist who helped investigate
S ARS, said Thursday.
The government reported two new outbreaks in poul
try Thursday, the 12th and 13th since Oct. 19. A day earli
er, the Health Ministry announced it had confirmed the
first human cases of the virulent HSNI strain of bird flu _
a 24-year-old woman who died and a 9-year-old boy who
recovered. It said the boy's 12-year-old sister, who died,
was a suspected case.
During the early days of SARS. the government re
fused to release any details about the disease, feeding ru
mors and public fear.
Its attitude began to change after the communist lead
ership was sharply criticized abroad. The government set
up a disease-warning network and promised to be open
and cooperative.
In recent weeks, anti-bird flu measures have been im
posed on an almost unimaginable scale in a country with
1.3 billion people and 14 billion chickens, ducks and
other poultry.
Health officials have slaughtered millions of chickens.
Live poultry sales are banned. China's chief veterinary of
ficial says all poultry will be vaccinated. People are quar
antined and monitored by the thousands.
"We swiftly enacted our emergency plan and took a se
ries of preventive measures to put the epidemic under

control within the shortest possible time," said Li Bohong,
the Communist Party representative in the district where
Qin's poultry farm is located.
State media that took months to start reporting on
SARS run daily coverage of anti-flu efforts.
The official Xinhua News Agency sends urgent dis
patches on each newly reported outbreak. The Agricul
ture Ministry has short videos on bird flu prevention on
its Web site.
"The Chinese government has taken a very responsible
attitude," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao.
"It is not necessary for us to cover up."
Despite such promises of openness, the govern
ment still tries to control information about out
breaks. Local officials often refuse to answer re
porters' questions.
From Chinese leaders to village officials, all proclaim
their dedication to stopping the virulent HSNI virus,
which has infected at least 126 people in Asia, killing at
least 64 of them, since 2003.
Premier Wen Jiabao warned last week that China faced

an "arduous task."
On Thursday, he urged officials not to be complacent.
"In 2003, we triumphed over S ARS," Wen was quoted
as saying on state television. "It shows that we will triumph
over bird flu as well."
The same attention that went into detecting human dis
eases after S ARS wasn't given to monitoring outbreaks in
animals, said Linfa Wang of the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory.
"They weren't ready to lift animal health to the level of
human health," said Wang, a member of a WHO team that
searched southern China two years ago for animals carry
ing the SARS virus.
