# Campaign targets smoking in movies
## Attorney generals send letters to request anti-smokings PSAs 
### SANDY COHEN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kids, don't try this at
home. With a new study showing that exposure to on
screen smoking prompts many American adolescents
to light up, state prosecutors from across the country
want Hollywood to slap anti-smoking admonitions on
all new DVDs.
Attorneys general from 32 states signed a letter sent
this week to 10 movie studios asking executives to add
anti-smoking public service announcements to all
home-viewing releases that depict smoking.
"We're urging (studios) to do more," said Maryland
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr., author of the
letter.
"The industry's leaders are responsible Americans,"
he said, "and I'm sure they're just as concerned about
the health of their children as the doctors are."
The attorneys general suggest that studios include a
public service announcement with all upcoming DVDs.
A spot has already been developed by several organiza
tions for theatrical use beginning in January.
Kori Bernards, spokeswoman for the Motion Picture
Association of America, said studios will consider the
request individually.
"There's no collective decision at this point," she
said, pointing out that MPAA ratings already indicate
whether a movie depicts underage smoking.
Researchers at Dartmouth Medical School conclud
ed that exposure to smoking in movies is a "primary
risk factor" in determining whether kids will take up
the habit.
The study, released Nov. 7, looked at 6,522 adoles
cents and found that 38 of every 1(X) who tried smoking
did so because of their exposure to smoking in movies.
The more on-screen smoking that kids see, the more
likely they are to light up, the study found, regardless of
where they live or whether their parents or peers
smoke.
"No child is immune to the influence of smoking in
movies," study author Dr. James Sargent said in a state
ment.
