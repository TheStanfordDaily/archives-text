## Pre-game festivities successful Security measures taken to discourage rushing of field 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
The Big Game Committee has been working over
time to make this Saturday's 108 th Big Game memo
rable, incorporating new activities to the tailgate and or
ganizing a Big Party to take place prior to the game
across the street from the tailgate area.
"We hope it will increase in size and scope over time
and become a Stanford tradition," said ASSU Under
graduate Senator and Big Game Committee member
Kat Kershner, a sophomore, referring to the Big Party.
The committee has additionally been involved in
boosting school spirit throughout the week prior to Bigg
Game.
"The Big Game Week Committee has introduced the
Spirit Table to White Plaza," Kershner said. "Every year
the Axe Committee camps out at the Birdcage to rally
support, and this year we've launched the Spirit Table
where students can come and get their faces painted,
their hair sprayed red, put on temporary tattoos and win
shirts by exhibiting their Stanford pride and fanaticism."
"The ASSU Undergraduate Senate also sponsored
rally towels to be given out to the first 1,400 students at
the game," she added.
Members of the committee come from most of the
student groups involved in or affected by the Big Game,
including the Axe Committee, the ASSU, the Inter-
Sorority and Fraternity Councils, the Band, the staff of
Gaieties and the yell leaders; there are nearly a dozen
student members.
The main security concerns posed by the Big Game
were addressed by the Stanford Chief of Police Laura
Wilson atTiiesday night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting.
The security presence at the game will be significant.

According to Wilson, large numbers of personnel will be
present.There will be more than 100 police officers from
the Stanford Department of Public Safety, the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office and the UC-Berkeley Po
lice Department.
The California Highway Patrol and Palo Alto Police
Department will provide traffic assistance. The Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office helicopter will also be
there to assist with traffic control and to observe any
post-game issues that might arise. Monitoring will occur
with high quality television cameras, used to videotape
incidents that may occur inside the venue arena.
In terms of students rushing the field, as occurred in
years past at the Big Game, on-field security is a concern
for officials, although not the main one.
"1 know that many people think that celebrating on
the field with the team is 'fun.' And it can be," Wilson said.
"The problem is that you never know when things will
turn from fun to tragic. As I mentioned at the ASSU Sen-

ate meeting, a University of Minnesota student
lost his life just last month when a goal post
that was ripped off by celebrating fans

struck him in the head."
"I've seen happy crowds turn into
angry crowds in the blink of an eye," she
said. "Once the momentum turns, stop
ping it is like trying to squelch a raging
forest fire with a pitcher of water. So,
the police try to keep that fire from
ever starting. That doesn't mean that
we don't want fans to have fun and
enjoy the game."

If the crowd is "easy going" and there
are no significant problems during the
game,police officers will stand at the bottom
of the student sections at the end to keep the

peace. If there is unrest, police officers
will move further into the stands.
According to Wilson, if students
see police officers wearing helmets,
that means people have already
started throwing things at them.
"I know the helmets invoke a neg
ative reaction from fans, which is why
we generally don't wear them unless
absolutely necessary," Wilson said.
There will he several "no flv
zones," which are essentially the
walkways in front of the Stanford
student section and the Cal student
section inside the fence. People will
not be allowed to use these walkways
and instead will have to climb the
stairs and use the concourse level to

travel between sections.
"Obviously, we will make excep
tions for someone who might be mo
bility impaired or elderly," Wilson
said. "The idea is to keep Stanford
fans wearing red from becoming tar
gets when they walk in front of the
Cal section and, at the same time,
prevent Stanford fans from inciting
the Cal fans by walking through
'their' section. The same applies to
Cal fans in the Stanford section."
Security personnel will be sta
tioned in these areas to advise peo
ple of the rules. Violators can be
ejected immediately from the venue.
The mascots and the flag bearers
have similar "no fly zones" and can

also be ejected for violations.
Wilson explained that people
who bring alcohol into the stadium
will be ejected immediately and not
allowed to return.
"People who are heavily intoxi
cated will be refused entry." she said.
"Fruit must be cut into pieces that
would not injure someone if thrown.
Sticks — like for holding up banners
— are not allowed. Obviously, no
weapons or dangerous items."
Wilson said she hopes people will
not rush the field and attempt to
take down the goal posts, especially
since the goal posts on Stanford's
football field are not the kind that
can come down.

across the street from the tailgate area.
"We hope it will increase in size and scope over time
and become a Stanford tradition," said ASSU Under
graduate Senator and Big Game Committee member
Kat Kershner, a sophomore, referring to the Big Party.
The committee has additionally been involved in
boosting school spirit throughout the week prior to Bigg
Game.
"The Big Game Week Committee has introduced the
Spirit Table to White Plaza," Kershner said. "Every year
the Axe Committee camps out at the Birdcage to rally
support, and this year we've launched the Spirit Table
where students can come and get their faces painted,
their hair sprayed red, put on temporary tattoos and win
shirts by exhibiting their Stanford pride and fanaticism."
"The ASSU Undergraduate Senate also sponsored
rally towels to be given out to the first 1,400 students at
the game," she added.
Members of the committee come from most of the
student groups involved in or affected by the Big Game,
including the Axe Committee, the ASSU, the Inter-
Sorority and Fraternity Councils, the Band, the staff of
Gaieties and the yell leaders; there are nearly a dozen
student members.
The main security concerns posed by the Big Game
were addressed by the Stanford Chief of Police Laura
Wilson atTiiesday night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting.
The security presence at the game will be significant.

According to Wilson, large numbers of personnel will be
present.There will be more than 100 police officers from
the Stanford Department of Public Safety, the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office and the UC-Berkeley Po
lice Department.
The California Highway Patrol and Palo Alto Police
Department will provide traffic assistance. The Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office helicopter will also be
there to assist with traffic control and to observe any
post-game issues that might arise. Monitoring will occur
with high quality television cameras, used to videotape
incidents that may occur inside the venue arena.
In terms of students rushing the field, as occurred in
years past at the Big Game, on-field security is a concern
for officials, although not the main one.
"1 know that many people think that celebrating on
the field with the team is 'fun.' And it can be," Wilson said.
"The problem is that you never know when things will
turn from fun to tragic. As I mentioned at the ASSU Sen-

ate meeting, a University of Minnesota student
lost his life just last month when a goal post
that was ripped off by celebrating fans

struck him in the head."
"I've seen happy crowds turn into
angry crowds in the blink of an eye," she
said. "Once the momentum turns, stop
ping it is like trying to squelch a raging
forest fire with a pitcher of water. So,
the police try to keep that fire from
ever starting. That doesn't mean that
we don't want fans to have fun and
enjoy the game."

If the crowd is "easy going" and there
are no significant problems during the
game,police officers will stand at the bottom
of the student sections at the end to keep the

peace. If there is unrest, police officers
will move further into the stands.
According to Wilson, if students
see police officers wearing helmets,
that means people have already
started throwing things at them.
"I know the helmets invoke a neg
ative reaction from fans, which is why
we generally don't wear them unless
absolutely necessary," Wilson said.
There will he several "no flv
zones," which are essentially the
walkways in front of the Stanford
student section and the Cal student
section inside the fence. People will
not be allowed to use these walkways
and instead will have to climb the
stairs and use the concourse level to

travel between sections.
"Obviously, we will make excep
tions for someone who might be mo
bility impaired or elderly," Wilson
said. "The idea is to keep Stanford
fans wearing red from becoming tar
gets when they walk in front of the
Cal section and, at the same time,
prevent Stanford fans from inciting
the Cal fans by walking through
'their' section. The same applies to
Cal fans in the Stanford section."
Security personnel will be sta
tioned in these areas to advise peo
ple of the rules. Violators can be
ejected immediately from the venue.
The mascots and the flag bearers
have similar "no fly zones" and can

also be ejected for violations.
Wilson explained that people
who bring alcohol into the stadium
will be ejected immediately and not
allowed to return.
"People who are heavily intoxi
cated will be refused entry." she said.
"Fruit must be cut into pieces that
would not injure someone if thrown.
Sticks — like for holding up banners
— are not allowed. Obviously, no
weapons or dangerous items."
Wilson said she hopes people will
not rush the field and attempt to
take down the goal posts, especially
since the goal posts on Stanford's
football field are not the kind that
can come down.
