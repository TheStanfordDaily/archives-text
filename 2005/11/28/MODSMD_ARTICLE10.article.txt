A but spend only modestly
as holiday season begins
NEW YORK (AP) — The 2005 holiday shop
ping season got off to only a modest start over
the Thanksgiving weekend as consumers re
sponded initially to aggressive discounting and
then retreated.
"There was a lot of hype, a lot of promotions
and lot of people, but the results were on the luke
warm side," said Michael Niemira, an economist
at the International Council of Shopping Centers.
He said heavy markdowns forced retailers to sell
more goods in order to meet sales targets. Analysts
said there was heavy shopper traffic early Friday.
When the early-bird specials were over, con
sumers lost their enthusiasm.

bus with 44 people aboard ran off the freeway,
rolled onto its side and slid at least 100 yards be

major injuries.

not reveal any mechanical problems on the bus.
Four U.S. soldiers face
disciplinary action for
burning Taliban bodies
KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) — Four U.S.
soldiers face disciplinary action for burning the
bodies of two Taliban rebels — a videotaped inci
dent that sparked outrage in Afghanistan — but
they will not be prosecuted because their actions
were motivated by hygienic concerns, the military
said Saturday.
TV footage recorded Oct. 1 in a violent part of
southern Afghanistan showed American soldiers
setting fire to the bodies and then boasting about
the act on loudspeakers to taunt insurgents sus
pected to be hiding in a nearby village.
Islam bans cremation, and the video images
were compared to photographs of U.S. troops
abusing prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison.
