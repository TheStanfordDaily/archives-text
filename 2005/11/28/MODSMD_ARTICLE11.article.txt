## Chinese city restores running water after shutdown caused by toxic spill 
### JOE Mcdonald ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
HARBIN, China (AP) â€” Running
water returned to this northeast city of 3.8
million people Sunday, ending a five-day
shutdown blamed on a chemical spill that
embarrassed the government and high
lighted China's mounting environmental
problems.
However, officials warned that what
was coming out the tap in frigid Harbin
still was too dirty to drink.
Water service started returning to this
provincial capital shortly before 6 p.m.
after the government said toxins spewed
into the Songhua River by a chemical
plant explosion had returned to safe lev
els. Residents said service did not resume
in some areas for several more hours.
"When that running water came back
on, it was a completely wonderful feeling.
It's been four days since I had a shower,"
said grinning taxi driver Cao Sijun,46.
Local television showed the governor
of Heilongjiang province, where Harbin is
located, drinking a glass drawn from the
tap in a Harbin family's home after serv
ice resumed.
But the government warned the public
that supplies lying in pipes for five days
were too dirty to drink, although safe
enough for housecleaning and laundry. It
said it would announce on radio and tele
vision when the water was safe enough
first to bathe in and later to drink.
"We still have to wait a little longer,"
sighed Wang Yixin, a 34-year-old entre
preneur. However, she said, "tomorrow
we'll clean the whole apartment and wash
all our clothes."
The deadly Nov. 13 chemical plant ex
plosion in Jilin, a city upstream, was a po
litical disaster for President Hu Jintao's
government and cast a harsh light on the
environmental costs of China's break
neck development.
Hu's government issued embarrassing
apologies to China's public and to Russia,
where a border city downstream is brac
ing for the arrival of the benzene slick that
was 50 miles long.
The pollutants were expected to reach
Russian territory within days and
Khabarovsk, a city of 580.000, within
weeks. A top Russian environmental offi
cial, Oleg Mitvol, told the Ekho Moskvy
radio Sunday that the nation will airlift 50
tons of activated carbon to treatment
plants along the Amur River in a bid to
absorb the toxins.
Environmentalists criticized China's
response to the spill and questioned the
decision to allow a facility handling such
dangerous materials near a key water
source.
The government has promised to in
vestigate the spill and punish any officials
found responsible. The plant is operated
by a subsidiary of China's biggest oil com
pany, state-owned China National Petro
leum Corp.
State media have accused local offi
cials of first concealing and then lying
about the explosion, which killed five
people and forced the evacuation of
10.000 others.
It was not until this week that the gov
ernment said the accident dumped 100

tons of benzene into the Songhua. Ben
zene is used in the manufacture of plas
tics, detergents and pesticides.
The announcement that Harbin would
suspend water service triggered panic
buying of bottled water, soft drinks and
milk. Schools closed and residents
stocked up on water in bathtubs and tea
kettles.
"We filled every pot and bucket," said
Cao, pointing to a row of vessels on the
floor of his family's second-story apart
ment in a concrete-slab building.
Despite the initial anxiety, many took
the water cutoff stoically, lining up in bit
ing cold for supplies from trucks sent
daily by the city government.The city also
trucked in millions of bottles of drinking
water and said it was drilling 1(X) new
water wells to supplement the 918 already
supplying hospitals and some residential
areas.
"It was a bit hard to take," said Wang,
who lugged supplies up seven flights of
stairs to her apartment.
On Sunday, television cameras fol

lowed Heilongjiang Gov. Zhang Zuoji
into the home of 75-year-old Pang
Yucheng. where he drank a glass of boiled
tap water.
"It tastes good," the governor said.
The city government did not say how
many days it might be until the water was
safe for public consumption.
"The first water is dangerous because
it's been sitting in pipes for five days. We
will advise citizens when they can drink
the water," Wang Minghe,deputy general
manager of the Harbin water depart
ment, told reporters touring a water treat
ment plant.
The city will cut fees to encourage
water use in coming days to flush out the
old supply and "enable it to be drinkable
sooner," Wang Minghe said.
China has suffered a string of such dis
asters in recent years, each leading to offi
cial promises of more rigorous enforce
ment of environmental rules or more sen
sitivity to public worries.
Industrial pollution is a sensitive issue,
with protests reported nationwide over

complaints that factory discharges are ru
ining crops and local water supplies.
Protesters often accuse officials of fail
ing to enforce environmental standards,
either in exchange for bribes or for fear of
harming economic growth. The govern
ment says all major rivers are dangerous
ly polluted, threatening water supplies for
millions.
With its huge population, China ranks
among countries with the smallest water
supplies per person. Hundreds of cities
regularly suffer water shortages.
In the southwest, authorities said con
tamination of a river from a second chem
ical plant explosion this week was under
control, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
The explosion Thursday in Dianjiang,
in the Chongqing region, killed one per
son and forced the evacuations of 6,000
others.
More than 800 people were helping
clean the Guixi River with screens made
of straw and activated charcoal, Xinhua
said.

province. Water service to the city resumed Sunday, five days after being cut when a toxic spill in the Songhua river threatened
Harbin's water supply.
