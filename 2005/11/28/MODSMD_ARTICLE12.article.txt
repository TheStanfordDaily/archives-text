## Body Language, or How to Get E.T. to Phone Home 
### 
I've always been one to do things a little
... differently. When the other middle
school kids were showing off their de
signer jeans, I was flaunting pink leggings
and a "World's Best Mom" sweatshirt.
While my classmates wrote their college
essays about what it was like to see a poor
person once, I wrote about my favorite pen
(I really am obsessed with office supplies).
So it seems logical that when everyone else
was applying for consulting or investment
banking internships last summer, 1 called
up the people that look for aliens.
If you've seen the movie "Contact"
with Jodie Foster, you've heard of the SETI
Institute — it's where they Search for Ex
traterrestrial Intelligence. They also per
form a bunch of other functions, like em
ploy physicists, astrobiologists and engi
neers to research "the origin, nature and
prevalence of life in the universe." But I
didn't care too much about that other stuff;
1 wanted to talk to the Martians!
Enter Douglas Vakoch, SETl's director
of interstellar message composition. I got
in touch with Dr. Vakoch through the "As
trobiology and Space Exploration" course
1 took winter quarter, and as soon as we
met I knew we had to work together. He
tries to communicate with aliens: I try to
communicate with men. It was a match
made in heaven (literally).
Although I didn't get the chance to talk
to any aliens per se, I did do a lot of research
on nonverbal communication that will be
used as a foundation for creating interstellar
messages. And I learned a great deal about
how humans use gesture, eye gaze, posture
and body orientation to convey information
like dominance and emotional state.
What I'm trying to say is that I can read
you like an open book. Your secrets are no
longer safe. With one studied glance I will
know who you are, what you're thinking
and the last time you went to the bath
room without washing your hands (an
swer: yesterday).
Some people are intimidated by my
newfound powers, which they express by
avoiding eye contact and orienting their
body toward the door whenever I walk into
the room. I, in turn, express dominance by
standing up straight and shouting, "I CAN
READ YOUR MIND AND SOME DAY
I WILL SPEAK TO THE ALIENS!" If
you've ever wondered how an attractive
and intelligent female like me manages to
stay single, well, now you have your answer.
But for those of you who would like to
experience the pleasures of companion
ship one day, you can learn the secrets of
body language and use them covertly to at
tract that hot guy/girl/Klingon.The follow
ing is what I've learned so far:
Appropriate eye contact screams "con
fidence." Inappropriate eye contact —
such as avoiding direct gaze or staring
without blinking — screams "serial killer."
Other things that scream "serial killer" are
carrying bloody knives, mumbling incoher
ently and introducing yourself as Bob the
Serial Killer.
Body orientation indicates direction of
attention. If you want to show someone
you're interested, you should orient your
body toward that person when you are
talking. Conversely, if they aren't oriented
toward you, they're not giving you their
maximum attention (unless this person is a
contortionist, in which case I will pay you
$20 to give me his or her number).
Mirroring your partner's movements
shows affiliation. Now this is a little tricky,
because if you mimic everything your part
ner does, you are going to look like a fool,
particularly if they have a nervous tic and
the two of you spend hours hitting your
selves while everyone else in the bar looks
on in fear. But subtly following your part
ner's body language cues (i.e. head move
ments, gestures, etc.) conveys a sense of as
sociation and friendliness.
Kicking a man in the groin with your
stilettos ruins his Special Dinner and de
stroys his dream of fathering children, but
indicates that you do not enjoy being
groped without express permission. Did
you pick up on that nonverbal cue. Bob?
The moral of the story: verbal commu
nication is only one way humans (and pre
sumably, extraterrestrials) express them
selves, and it is important to keep this in
mind when mingling with the opposite sex.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to retrieve
my stiletto from Bob, whose body is cur
rently oriented in the fetal position.

Marie can't really read your mind, hut she
can read your feedback. Comment on this ar
