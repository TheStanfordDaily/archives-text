# Teaching kids their ABC's
## Directors of STEP's new elementary teaching program say social change can start in young children's schooling 
### ARAM HUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Teach Education Program,
more widely known as STEP, launched a new
elementary teaching branch to its existing
secondary teaching program in 2004. This
year, its first cohort will complete their mas
ter's degrees and embark on their careers in
the teaching world. What is unique about this
band of graduates, however, is that they are
what the STEP program calls teacher leaders.
"Perhaps the best thing about STEP is that
they want to not only prepare their teacher
candidates to be great teachers in the class
room, they also prepare them to be leaders in
the schools," says Patrick Lewis-Jose, a current
trainee in the elementary teaching program.
But some people undercut the value of el
ementary education. A freshman who wishes
to remain anonymous says she believes
there's not much sense in attending Stanford
to become an elementary school teacher.
"Change tends to happen from top to bot
tom, from the policy makers to the recipients,"
she says. "Isn't it kind of a waste to spend four
years at such an acclaimed institution just to
become an elementary school teacher? Why
not use the time to train to get to a position
where you can make substantial change?"
In response, STEP coordinators argue
that education — especially elementary ed
ucation — is in fact the fundamental locus
for change.
"Change is carried on by the future chil
dren of the world," says Ruth Ann Costanzo,
student services coordinator for the School
of Education. "The best place to have that
important opportunity to impact future chil
dren is here, in education."
For STEP staff and trainees, education is
not an end in itself, but a means to promote
positive change in society. Therefore, STEP
is committed not only to equipping gradu
ates with expertise in literacy and math, but
also to helping them glean a broader con
sciousness about the work they do.

"STEP is very interested in issues of social
justice which are incorporated into our learn
ing about teaching," Lewis-Jose says. "To me,
teaching was more than reading, writing and
math. Making a difference meant that I
would have to inspire. So. I decided that I
needed to be aware of all the issues surround
ing education in the United States and look at
them through the lens of social justice."
STEP's addition of the elementary branch
is not only an expansion of the current pro
gram, but also an educational statement to
target youth education from the beginning.
"If we can get good quality teachers from
the elementary stage when children are just
starting to develop, I believe that is a way to
make a difference," says Gwyn Wachtel of
the School of Education. Wachtel is an affili
ate of the Elementary Education Program.
In order to train exceptional teachers,
STEP heralds the philosophy of combining
academics with field experience. According

to Costanzo, the program's small size allows
coordinators to be very selective for sites
used for field training.
"We work very hard to locate outstanding
teachers in excellent school environments to
mentor our students," Wachtel says."The
whole time students are with us, they are in a
teaching placement. They really get to see
the cycle of what the whole year is like so that
when they go into the profession, they al
ready know what to expect."
Unlike its high school education coun
terpart, the elementary school program
places greater emphasis on a broad range of
courses, as well as the psychological mold
ing of students. Undergraduate pre-requi
sites include courses ranging from mathe
matics to psychology.
STEP constantly aims for self-betterment
by launching programs such as Teachers fora
New Era. This research initiative conducts
studies on the relationship between teacher

preparation and student achievement to cre
ate effective teacher training programs at
elite universities, according to the STEP Web
site. The program is spearheaded by School
of Education Lecturer Clare Kosnik and re
ceives funding from the Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York, the Annenberg Founda
tion and the Ford Foundation.
STEP is open to all Stanford undergradu
ates who wish to pursue a co-term or gradu
ate degree — undergraduates can apply in
their junior and senior years, and STEP se
lects 20 students each year.
"I always felt it was important for me to
give back to whatever community 1 was a
part of," Lewis-Jose says."I wanted to leave
Stanford and make a difference. After a lot
of thought. 1 realized that one of the best and
most powerful ways to make a difference
was teaching. STEP staff works with the
teacher candidates to make sure their needs
are being met. They'll take care of you."

to remain anonymous says she believes
there's not much sense in attending Stanford
to become an elementary school teacher.
"Change tends to happen from top to bot
tom, from the policy makers to the recipients,"
she says. "Isn't it kind of a waste to spend four
years at such an acclaimed institution just to
become an elementary school teacher? Why
not use the time to train to get to a position
where you can make substantial change?"
In response, STEP coordinators argue
that education — especially elementary ed
ucation — is in fact the fundamental locus
for change.
"Change is carried on by the future chil
dren of the world," says Ruth Ann Costanzo,
student services coordinator for the School
of Education. "The best place to have that
important opportunity to impact future chil
dren is here, in education."
For STEP staff and trainees, education is
not an end in itself, but a means to promote
positive change in society. Therefore, STEP
is committed not only to equipping gradu
ates with expertise in literacy and math, but
also to helping them glean a broader con
sciousness about the work they do.

"STEP is very interested in issues of social
justice which are incorporated into our learn
ing about teaching," Lewis-Jose says. "To me,
teaching was more than reading, writing and
math. Making a difference meant that I
would have to inspire. So. I decided that I
needed to be aware of all the issues surround
ing education in the United States and look at
them through the lens of social justice."
STEP's addition of the elementary branch
is not only an expansion of the current pro
gram, but also an educational statement to
target youth education from the beginning.
"If we can get good quality teachers from
the elementary stage when children are just
starting to develop, I believe that is a way to
make a difference," says Gwyn Wachtel of
the School of Education. Wachtel is an affili
ate of the Elementary Education Program.
In order to train exceptional teachers,
STEP heralds the philosophy of combining
academics with field experience. According

to Costanzo, the program's small size allows
coordinators to be very selective for sites
used for field training.
"We work very hard to locate outstanding
teachers in excellent school environments to
mentor our students," Wachtel says."The
whole time students are with us, they are in a
teaching placement. They really get to see
the cycle of what the whole year is like so that
when they go into the profession, they al
ready know what to expect."
Unlike its high school education coun
terpart, the elementary school program
places greater emphasis on a broad range of
courses, as well as the psychological mold
ing of students. Undergraduate pre-requi
sites include courses ranging from mathe
matics to psychology.
STEP constantly aims for self-betterment
by launching programs such as Teachers fora
New Era. This research initiative conducts
studies on the relationship between teacher

preparation and student achievement to cre
ate effective teacher training programs at
elite universities, according to the STEP Web
site. The program is spearheaded by School
of Education Lecturer Clare Kosnik and re
ceives funding from the Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York, the Annenberg Founda
tion and the Ford Foundation.
STEP is open to all Stanford undergradu
ates who wish to pursue a co-term or gradu
ate degree — undergraduates can apply in
their junior and senior years, and STEP se
lects 20 students each year.
"I always felt it was important for me to
give back to whatever community 1 was a
part of," Lewis-Jose says."I wanted to leave
Stanford and make a difference. After a lot
of thought. 1 realized that one of the best and
most powerful ways to make a difference
was teaching. STEP staff works with the
teacher candidates to make sure their needs
are being met. They'll take care of you."


The Stanford Teach Education Program,
more widely known as STEP, launched a new
elementary teaching branch to its existing
secondary teaching program in 2004. This
year, its first cohort will complete their mas
ter's degrees and embark on their careers in
the teaching world. What is unique about this
band of graduates, however, is that they are
what the STEP program calls teacher leaders.
"Perhaps the best thing about STEP is that
they want to not only prepare their teacher
candidates to be great teachers in the class
room, they also prepare them to be leaders in
the schools," says Patrick Lewis-Jose, a current
trainee in the elementary teaching program.
