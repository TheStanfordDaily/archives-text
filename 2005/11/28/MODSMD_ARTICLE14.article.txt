# Student group to hold gift fair, promote public health initiatives
## 
### JESSAMYN EDRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Do cranberries help prevent cavities?
Should you be devouring dark chocolate? Do
beer and good nutrition mix? These are just a
few health questions ripped from recent
headlines. Getting healthy is quickly becom
ing an obsession for most Americans, espe
cially after the release of "Super Size Me" and
"Fast Food Nation."
Yet these ostensibly important issues pale
in comparison to the basic struggle for survival
that many have to face on a day-to-day basis.
Well-known organizations such as The
United Nations Children's Fund and the Red
Cross battle starvation and the critical lack of
nutritional education. Now Stanford students
can add one more name to that list — the
Children's Public Health Initiative (CPHI).
Thursday, Dec. 1, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in
White Plaza. CPHI will hold an Alternative
Gift Fair where students and faculty can join
the fight for public health. The event is called
the Alternative Gift Fair because it hopes to
give people creative gift ideas.
"The basic idea is that by giving a donation

to an organization in someone's name, you
can give your friend or relative a very
thoughtful gift and support children's health
at the same time," says senior Regan Johnson,
co-founder of CPHI.
Because direct donations are prohibited
on campus. CPHI will give out holiday cards
and information on the organizations rather
than soliciting charity, Johnson explains.
"This will give people the option of do
nating in honor of someone or asking fora
donation as a gift from someone else," John
son continues. "People can donate online or
by mail."
Charities will be represented by poster
boards on tables in White Plaza and don't
worry if Thursday is a really busy day for you
— CPHI will hand out flyers and e-mail infor
mation to people who drop by and leave their
contact information.
Run by Stanford students, CPHI strives to
increase public health awareness on the local,
national and international level. When seniors
Johnson and Brian Bergmark realized the
dearth of student involvement in international
health issues, they founded the Student Cam
paign for Child Survival in autumn of 2003.

This summer, the campaign changed its
name to CPHI to expand the original organi
zation and clarify its goals, according to John
son. The group hopes to plan activities that
tackle a broader range of issues while still fo
cusing on child health.
The objectives of CPHI are best described
by Bergmark, who says, "CPHI has three
goals that further its mission of creating a safe
and healthy world for all children while giving
communities the tools to [help] their chil
dren: community education, political advoca
cy and community activism."
Not just written ambitions, these goals are
in the process of being fulfilled through a
number of projects. For example, community
education is accomplished through speaker
events and partnerships with senators and
representatives both in California and in
Washington, D.C.
As for getting the local community in
volved, Bergmark recounts CPHI's ongoing
activities with Cesar Chavez Elementary
School in East San Jose.
"At Cesar Chavez, CPHI works on nutri
tion and exercise education, and recently held
a field day to which it brought donated sports

equipment for the school," Bergmark says.
In addition to field days and nutrition
classes, CPU! lobbied local government offi
cials for more funding, Johnson says. There
are also plans to make nutrition classes avail
able to parents.
Johnson explains that proper public health
education is not available to certain schools,
and specifically Cesar Chavez.
"Most of the children at this school are
from low income immigrant families," John
son says. "There is a large problem with obe
sity and diabetes among children, in part due
to poor access to recreational facilities and
poor education regarding good nutrition."
CPHI has many plans for the future, includ
ing adding a garden program to the physical ed
ucation activities at Cesar Chavez and expand
ing these programs to other schools.The organ
ization is also working on building alliances with
other groups to limit childhwxl obesity and ad
vocate health-promoting policies.
Ultimately, however, Johnson says, "We
have many incredible new group members,
and much of our direction in the future will be
up to them — determined by their interests
and their passions."

The objectives of CPHI are best described
by Bergmark, who says, "CPHI has three
goals that further its mission of creating a safe
and healthy world for all children while giving
communities the tools to [help] their chil
dren: community education, political advoca
cy and community activism."
Not just written ambitions, these goals are
in the process of being fulfilled through a
number of projects. For example, community
education is accomplished through speaker
events and partnerships with senators and
representatives both in California and in
Washington, D.C.
As for getting the local community in
volved, Bergmark recounts CPHI's ongoing
activities with Cesar Chavez Elementary
School in East San Jose.
"At Cesar Chavez, CPHI works on nutri
tion and exercise education, and recently held
a field day to which it brought donated sports

equipment for the school," Bergmark says.
In addition to field days and nutrition
classes, CPU! lobbied local government offi
cials for more funding, Johnson says. There
are also plans to make nutrition classes avail
able to parents.
Johnson explains that proper public health
education is not available to certain schools,
and specifically Cesar Chavez.
"Most of the children at this school are
from low income immigrant families," John
son says. "There is a large problem with obe
sity and diabetes among children, in part due
to poor access to recreational facilities and
poor education regarding good nutrition."
CPHI has many plans for the future, includ
ing adding a garden program to the physical ed
ucation activities at Cesar Chavez and expand
ing these programs to other schools.The organ
ization is also working on building alliances with
other groups to limit childhwxl obesity and ad
vocate health-promoting policies.
Ultimately, however, Johnson says, "We
have many incredible new group members,
and much of our direction in the future will be
up to them — determined by their interests
and their passions."
Do cranberries help prevent cavities?
Should you be devouring dark chocolate? Do
beer and good nutrition mix? These are just a
few health questions ripped from recent
headlines. Getting healthy is quickly becom
ing an obsession for most Americans, espe
cially after the release of "Super Size Me" and
"Fast Food Nation."
Yet these ostensibly important issues pale
in comparison to the basic struggle for survival
that many have to face on a day-to-day basis.
Well-known organizations such as The
United Nations Children's Fund and the Red
Cross battle starvation and the critical lack of
nutritional education. Now Stanford students
can add one more name to that list — the
Children's Public Health Initiative (CPHI).
Thursday, Dec. 1, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in
White Plaza. CPHI will hold an Alternative
Gift Fair where students and faculty can join
the fight for public health. The event is called
the Alternative Gift Fair because it hopes to
give people creative gift ideas.
"The basic idea is that by giving a donation

to an organization in someone's name, you
can give your friend or relative a very
thoughtful gift and support children's health
at the same time," says senior Regan Johnson,
co-founder of CPHI.
Because direct donations are prohibited
on campus. CPHI will give out holiday cards
and information on the organizations rather
than soliciting charity, Johnson explains.
"This will give people the option of do
nating in honor of someone or asking fora
donation as a gift from someone else," John
son continues. "People can donate online or
by mail."
Charities will be represented by poster
boards on tables in White Plaza and don't
worry if Thursday is a really busy day for you
— CPHI will hand out flyers and e-mail infor
mation to people who drop by and leave their
contact information.
Run by Stanford students, CPHI strives to
increase public health awareness on the local,
national and international level. When seniors
Johnson and Brian Bergmark realized the
dearth of student involvement in international
health issues, they founded the Student Cam
paign for Child Survival in autumn of 2003.

This summer, the campaign changed its
name to CPHI to expand the original organi
zation and clarify its goals, according to John
son. The group hopes to plan activities that
tackle a broader range of issues while still fo
cusing on child health.
The objectives of CPHI are best described
by Bergmark, who says, "CPHI has three
