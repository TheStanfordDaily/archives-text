## Editorial Subway should serve weekend dinners 
### 
The editorial board is optimistic about
the recent changes Stanford Dining
has made to create more logical dining
plans and partnerships with student groups.
However, there is always room for improve
ment and, in addition to past suggestions, we
would like to propose two modifications to
Dining's maintenance of campus cafes and
eateries. First, we recommend thatTresidder
Express accept Cardinal Dollars, and sec
ond, we advocate an extension of the hours
of operation for the various restaurants in
TVesidder Union.
TresEx is a very useful convenience store
for students on the go. Lines tend to be short
er and move more quickly than at the CoHo
or Subway. Many students simply do not
have time to get something to eat during
lunch but can easily pick something up from
TVesEx in the morning to eat between class
es later in the day
We are aware that dining halls can
arrange for students to pick up a bag lunch in
the morning, but students should have the
option of getting lunch to-go from some
where besides their dining halls. Further, stu
dents can eat lunch more cheaply and have
much more flexibility in hours and choice at
TVesEx. Finally, students should be able to
use Cardinal Dollars to purchase food to
sustain them when they miss meals in the fu

ture — drinks and snacks like crackers and
candy — much like they used to be able to at
Wilbur Marketplace.
We would also like to see Union Square
or Subway, both housed in TYesidder, open
for dinner on weekends. Students living in
Suites, Toyon, Row Houses, Florence
Moore, Branner and Governor's Corner do
not get meals on weekends. These resi
dences house a significant portion of the
undergraduate student body, many of
whom do not have cars to get off campus to
eat dinner — and who find the TVeehouse
and The 750 repetitive after several week
ends of dining there. Graduate students as
well, though they are more likely to have
cars, would welcome more on-campus
weekend dining options.
We understand that many of the students
who do not get meals on weekends are not
under the auspices of Stanford Dining and
do not purchase meal plans. Nonetheless, it
would be an appreciated show of good faith
if Dining helped them and the students on
University meal plans who must travel to an
other dining hall for weekend meals.
Stanford Dining is already taking one
positive step by opening up Late Nite on
weekends, but adding a few hours to Subway
and Union Square would do much to relieve
a drought of food options on campus.
