# Missing the nuance
## 
### 
One of the defining experiences of my
freshman year was taking PoliSci 1
(Introduction to International Rela
tions) from Prof. Stephen Krasner in the fall.
And it had nothing to do with the fact that in
one of his lectures, after mentioning the
French concept of "cultural exception," Kras
ner asked, "Who would want to buy French
movies anyway, with unattractive French ac
tors in the equally unattractive French coun
tryside?" My patriotism kicking in, I went up
to Krasner at the end of lecture and informed
him that I was French and that the French
countryside was very attractive, on the con
trary. He muttered something about tele
phone poles making it seem unattractive in
movies and then said he had to leave.
No, Krasner's "freedom fry" attitude is
not what made Intro to IR one of the mark
ing events of my freshman year. Rather, it
was being exposed to his vision of the world.
While he introduced us to the various exist
ing theories of international relations, he
made it clear that he championed realism.
This theory views the nation-state as the
basic unit and actor in the world system.
Countries are in constant competition with
each other, vying for resources and power
and thus making conflict inevitable. In other
words, the world according to realism is a
large-scale reenaction of Hobbes' state of
nature,but with countries as the main actors.
From the onset, I found realism uncom
pelling as a way to conceive of the interna
tional arena. How can states be the basic
unit? States don't act and speak with one
voice. States as such don't make decisions.
People do; organizations do. So of course I
found organizational theory — according to
which organizational processes drive world
events — much more appealing.
The problem with this theory, according
to Krasner and other proponents of realism,
is that it is too complicated to be useful. Re
alism, now, that's clear and simple. Country
X wants more power; it feels threatened by
its neighbor; therefore it will launch an at
tack. Just like the list of bullet points on
Krasner's slides: clear, straightforward —
but completely lacking in nuance.
I agree with proponents of realism that
too much nuance kills the explanation and
defies the purpose of theorizing. But a good
dose of it is nevertheless necessary. The

world is complicated, and we have to face it,
or we risk making gross oversimplifications
that can have disastrous consequences.
What irks me even more about realism is
that it lacks all human dimension. By making
nation-states the basic actors in the world
system, it doesn't acknowledge the impor
tance and impact of individuals and organi
zations.
In fact, this is not just a characteristic of
realism. Often, when people in positions of
power at the international or national level
talk about future courses of action, they talk
in numbers and strategy, not in terms of how
their policies will affect individual citizens
and groups. I think they fear that they will
seem unscientific and unprofessional if their
evidence is partially anecdotal.
In my opinion, however, bearing in mind
the stories of individual citizens is key to
good decision-making at that level, where it
is easy for prominent political figures to stay
locked up in their official government build
ings and engage in cold strategizing. You
can't fully appreciate the effects of a policy
until you've seen it incarnated in a living,
breathing person. Talking about underprivi
leged schools with California Department of
Education officials during an Alternative
Spring Break trip would have meant far less
to me had our group not previously visited a
3,(XX) student, 98 percent Hispanic middle
school where we taught 6th grade history for
a period and discussed the school's issues
with Teach for America teachers.
Contrary to what some world leaders
seem to think, the world is not a giant chess
board. It is full of nuance and rich, diverse
human experiences which leaders should
absolutely take into account when making
decisions and formulating policies.

One of the defining experiences of my
freshman year was taking PoliSci 1
(Introduction to International Rela
tions) from Prof. Stephen Krasner in the fall.
And it had nothing to do with the fact that in
one of his lectures, after mentioning the
French concept of "cultural exception," Kras
ner asked, "Who would want to buy French
movies anyway, with unattractive French ac
tors in the equally unattractive French coun
tryside?" My patriotism kicking in, I went up
to Krasner at the end of lecture and informed
him that I was French and that the French
countryside was very attractive, on the con
trary. He muttered something about tele
phone poles making it seem unattractive in
movies and then said he had to leave.
No, Krasner's "freedom fry" attitude is
not what made Intro to IR one of the mark
ing events of my freshman year. Rather, it
was being exposed to his vision of the world.
While he introduced us to the various exist
ing theories of international relations, he
made it clear that he championed realism.
This theory views the nation-state as the
basic unit and actor in the world system.
Countries are in constant competition with
each other, vying for resources and power
and thus making conflict inevitable. In other
words, the world according to realism is a
large-scale reenaction of Hobbes' state of
nature,but with countries as the main actors.
From the onset, I found realism uncom
pelling as a way to conceive of the interna
tional arena. How can states be the basic
unit? States don't act and speak with one
voice. States as such don't make decisions.
People do; organizations do. So of course I
found organizational theory — according to
which organizational processes drive world
events — much more appealing.
The problem with this theory, according
to Krasner and other proponents of realism,
is that it is too complicated to be useful. Re
alism, now, that's clear and simple. Country
X wants more power; it feels threatened by
its neighbor; therefore it will launch an at
tack. Just like the list of bullet points on
Krasner's slides: clear, straightforward —
but completely lacking in nuance.
I agree with proponents of realism that
too much nuance kills the explanation and
defies the purpose of theorizing. But a good
dose of it is nevertheless necessary. The

world is complicated, and we have to face it,
or we risk making gross oversimplifications
that can have disastrous consequences.
What irks me even more about realism is
that it lacks all human dimension. By making
nation-states the basic actors in the world
system, it doesn't acknowledge the impor
tance and impact of individuals and organi
zations.
In fact, this is not just a characteristic of
realism. Often, when people in positions of
power at the international or national level
talk about future courses of action, they talk
in numbers and strategy, not in terms of how
their policies will affect individual citizens
and groups. I think they fear that they will
seem unscientific and unprofessional if their
evidence is partially anecdotal.
In my opinion, however, bearing in mind
the stories of individual citizens is key to
good decision-making at that level, where it
is easy for prominent political figures to stay
locked up in their official government build
ings and engage in cold strategizing. You
can't fully appreciate the effects of a policy
until you've seen it incarnated in a living,
breathing person. Talking about underprivi
leged schools with California Department of
Education officials during an Alternative
Spring Break trip would have meant far less
to me had our group not previously visited a
3,(XX) student, 98 percent Hispanic middle
school where we taught 6th grade history for
a period and discussed the school's issues
with Teach for America teachers.
