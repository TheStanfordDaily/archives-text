# I dress to depress
## 
### 
Through four years of prep school, I
never once learned how to tie a tie.
The tie, if you didn't know, originated
in the old west. Bad guys who had just es
caped from being hanged would wear the
cut nooses around their necks. Like baggy
pants, this symbol of rebellion became
"chic" and all the coolest banditos wore
nooses around their necks. So while women
may complain about high heels and "emo
tions," men have to wear mini-nooses for
formal wear. So that's why I never wore
them. I think it was an attempt at rebellion,
one of those idealistic revolts that made
sense at the time but seems ridiculous now
— like being really into DEVO.
When I got to college, 1 saw young busi
ness leaders and those who were seeking in
terviews to become young business leaders
all wearing their pressed pants and equally
pressed personalities. I'd quietly swear that
that would not be me; I wanted to get a job
where my lack of piercing and hair dye
made me seem moderate and even conven
tional. Logically, I wanted a writer gig at the
San Francisco Bay Guardian.
I didn't own nice clothes in high school
and I didn't own nice ones to do interviews
at college. I figured "It's California, I'll be
overdressed if I put on a shirt." Growing up
on the East Coast, for the most part my
image of California came from "Saved By
the Bell," "Baywatch" and "Miami Vice,"
which means I'm still in desperate need of
geography skills. So when I came here I was
a bit shocked that 1 was not overdressed,
and my love of all things plaid made me into.

well, Screech.
But growing up in Jersey, I was used to
that. My friends and I were the mall rats, the
kids who bought nothing but old Bad Reli
gion albums and gave in return only ridicule
and scorn to basically everyone. That's what
this column is: me sitting on a bench making
fun of people in a mall. The only differences
being that the mall is a whole lot bigger and
instead of my two best friends I get to share
my thoughts with you people. But unlike my
best friends, I will not give you noogies if
you disagree with me. Except Topher An
derson. I will give Topher noogies.
Then last spring, something happened. I
was asked to go to a formal dinner, and I was
underdressed and actually embarrassed
about it. Normally I had enjoyed my satirical
dress clothes — my red plaid blazer, my Reel
Big Fish tie, my shredded khakis and my
chain belt. This time though, I was hobnob
bing with University officials and I felt so out
of place, I spent most of the night playing
Karl Rove and hiding behind a bush. I even
asked the caterer if he'd be willing to let me
buy his pants off him, and that was the fastest
I've ever seen pigs in a blanket move.

So now I have this job on campus that ac
tually involves me wearing a tie and khakis
and a nice shirt. My mother, and I'm not
making this up, did not recognize me when I
came home from work one day. At first I was
worried I was selling out and becoming
those kids I hated in high school. But then I
realized I work at a job I enjoy, believe in,
and might actually have an interest in pursu
ing as a career option. I still listen to Bad Re
ligion (their old stuff is better), have a collec
tion of plaid clothes and have not ruled out
the possibility of dying my hair in the fore
seeable future.
I still think working at the Guardian
would be pretty damn cool, and the writer's
lifestyle has always appealed to me, but now
I'm also thinking of jobs that require
Brooks Brothers and necktie camouflage.
They won't know I'm weird, that way.
They'll only figure it out if they talk to me
about film noir, ska or my fascination with
pudding.
Now I have this suit in my closet, and I
know it's for job interviews and work and all
that. But every so often I put on shades and
a potpie hat and go dressed as a blues broth
er. And when they ask me what the hell I'm
doing here in this place of business, this
place where real work is being done by fu
ture young business leaders, I can tell them:
"I'm on a mission from God."
Then, I'll give them all noogies.

Chris's disgruntled roommate would like to
point out he still does not know how to tie ties.
