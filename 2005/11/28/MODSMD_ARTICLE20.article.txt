French riots are not terrorism
While I applaud the Editorial Board's
efforts to inspire reflection on the global
nature of Muslim issues and of terrorism. I
find its recent conflation of these affairs to
be misguided. There is nothing fundamen
tally Muslim about terrorism, which
stretches from Oklahoma City to Belfast
to Baghdad. To say that this latest in a line
of French Revolutions is a London- or
Madrid-like example of terrorism is to
confuse a social movement with politically
motivated violence. Acts of terrorism re
quire comprehensive planning that is ab
sent in France today.
It is true that today's particular form of
racism in Europe affords a link between the
disaffected/discriminated and political
movements abroad. But this is a product of
the search for solidarity, not for Allah. Arab
ness and Muslimhood are landscape features

of Europe's social problem; they are not
causal agents.

Borders don't end our obligation
The troubling letter in the Nov. 16 Daily
("Protest should be aimed at Mexico"),
which criticized MEChA's demonstrations
about immigrants deaths along the US-
Mexico border, offered a political and eco
nomic analysis that is deceptively short
sighted and rooted in a fundamentally op
pressive and dangerous ideological stance.
The author's underlying assertion — that
every government bears full and exclusive re
sponsibility for the provision of a "better life"
and favorable "business climate" to its citizens
— ignores the extent to which the opportuni
ties available to individuals and the resources
available to governments are determined by

international economic structures and rela
tionships. Applied to a foreign policy sphere,
this assertion would seem to advocate un
abashedly for the full elimination of foreign
aid, an abandonment of all diplomatic ties not
immediately beneficial to our country's citi
zens, and an economic policy of unrestrained
economic imperialism. Actually, now that I
write this, it's starting to sound familiar.
Additionally, the author's assertions imply
that a country's default stance towards peo
ple who have not been able to find economic
opportunity, should be one of militaristically
enforced exclusion. This stance, while it
avoids overt recourse to oppressive rhetoric,
advocates an ideology of territorially-delin
eated entitlement that can only be rational
ized through the adoption of nationalistic,
xenophobic and fundamentally racist notions
of natural difference and natural rights.

Football needs change
Fire Walt Harris. Do it now. Forget about
giving the guy a chance. How does a team
lose to UC-Davis and get blown out by a
mediocre Cal team and nearly beat UCLA
and Notre Dame?
The team was not prepared to play
week-in and week-out and that is the
coach's responsibility. The blown losses at
the end are also a reflection of the coach
— the kids were not mentally tough.
Keep Harris and we will endure season
after losing season while Cal's program just
continues to get better and better recruits.
And Bill Walsh as Athletic Director?
Has someone lost their mind?
Did they notice that he picked Terry
Donahue to lead the 49ers? What a de
bacle.
