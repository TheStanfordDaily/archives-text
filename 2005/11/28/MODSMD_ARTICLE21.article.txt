# SPECIAL EVENT
## Journalist recounts war experience 
### OLIVIA SOHNS 
"We can never close the door on
history," Robert Fisk, Britain's high
est decorated foreign correspon
dent, announced last Sunday after
noon to a packed Cubberley Audito
rium. His talk, "History Unlearned:
The Wars of the Middle East," reliv
ed much of his own personal history
as a reporter based in the Middle
East for 30 years and also discussed
history's large role in the present
and future of the Middle East.
Fisk said that if politicians and
journalists "carried a history book in
their back pocket" the current-day
events unfolding in the Middle East
could be seen in a more lucid, and, at
times, ironic way
Fisk pointed to the "parallels of
history" in the region by citing
Napoleon's declaration that he
would "rescue the Egyptians" by in
vading Egypt and Britain's claim to
be civilizing Iraq by occupying the
country. Fisk told the audience that
when he told U.S. soldiers in Iraq
about how the British succumbed
to an unrelenting Iraqi insurgency,
they understood how history would
perhaps repeat itself.
Fisk argued that all empires
seek to keep expanding the domain
under their control because of their
fear of being "perceived as weak."

In light of this, Fisk said he believes
that central to journalist's job is
"monitoring the centers of power,"
especially "when they go to war."
He referenced President George
W. Bush's repeated assertion that
the "world was changed forever"
after Sept. 11.
"Why should the world be
changed forever?" Fisk asked the
audience. He argued that Sept. 11
doesn't have to be world-altering if
the public condemns government's
political exploitation of it — cur
tailing civil liberties, rousing suspi
cions to "divide the innocent from
the innocent," and rendering the
reasons for war in Iraq a "taboo" of
discussion. Fisk also argued that
Osama bin Laden only has power
only in as much as nations allow
themselves to be remade into less
liberal, less democratic, and more
fearful societies.
Fisk's projections for the region's
future are dire based on his own ex
perience reporting from Baghdad.
He remarked that most coverage of
the Iraq war is unhelpful because re
porters usually resort to "hotel jour
nalism," fearing to venture out of
their hotel rooms.
Fisk said he feels that risking his
life to talk to ordinary people "is
worth it," because it is essential to
"show that Iraqis are humans too."

Fisk emphasized the high human
costs of the war, citing that officially
1,100 Iraqi civilians were killed in
Baghdad in July alone.
At the end of his talk, Fisk ad
dressed the Arab-Israeli conflict, an
issue that he believes the media does
not accurately depict. Fisk argued
that the media wrongfully casts the
Palestinians as "generically violent"
rather than seeking to convey the
longer history of the conflict. Fisk re
marked that, for the Palestinians,
"the Balfour Declaration is still very
much alive," alluding to what he be
lieves is the legacy of imperialism
and colonialism that is still present in
the collective memory of the region.
Several members of the audience
said they enjoyed Fisk's speech.
Freshman Felicity Grisham said
that the combination of Fisk's fiery
speaking style, narrative accounts
and historical acumen made for "an
amazing event."
Tala al-Ramahi, a junior and
member of the Coalition for Justice
in the Middle East (CJME),the stu
dent group that organized the
event, agreed that the event was"a
great success."
"Fisk sent a clear message that
Middle Eastern people are human
beings and that, in the end, we all be
long to one race — humanity," she
said.
