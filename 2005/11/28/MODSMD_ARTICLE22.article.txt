## Workers to strike; Univ. responds 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA DESK EDITOR 
Hospital workers ready for strike
A majority of the Stanford University Medical Cen
ter's 1,300 employees, including nursing assistants, oper
ating room assistants, food service workers, housekeep
ers and lab assistants, voted to authorize a strike last
Tliesday if their contract demands are not met. The
workers, whose contracts expired on Nov. 13, are asking
fora 10 percent cost-of-living raise for the first year of
their contract and a 9 percent raise for the second and
third years. Negotiators for the hospital, however, are
proposing annual wage increases of 4 percent. Workers
are also demanding that their families receive health in
surance at no cost and that a job-security clause be put in

the contract.
In an interview with The San Mateo County Times,
Sarah Staley, director of communications for Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital said,"We feel we've listened
to the employees, and we feel many of their concerns
have been addressed. We have placed our last, best and
final offer on the table."
The union is required by law to give the hospital a 10-
day notice before beginning the strike. The union has
called fora strike vote from hospital employees on
Monday.
University responds to union strike
The University issued a statement in response to the
union's call fora strike vote of the Stanford Medical
Center workers. After several ne
gotiation sessions, University offi
cials said they were surprised to
learn that — without any notice to
Stanford — the union issued a
press statement saying they will
ask fora strike vote on Monday,
the day that had previously been
scheduled for resuming negotia
tions. The University contends
that its benefit package is very
competitive, spending over 30
cents on employee benefits for
every salary dollar.
Laboratory explosion injures
professor
A laboratory explosion at the
Stauffer Building 111 last Tuesday
placed Rodolfo Salgado-Ro
driguez, a visiting scholar from
Mexico, in critical condition at the
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
Salgado-Rodriguez was working
in a chemical engineering laborato
ry at 6:30 p.m. when the explosion
occurred. Officials from the Univer
sity's Department of Public Safety,
firefighters, medics and hazardous

materials specialists from the Palo
Alto Fire Department, an engine
company from the Menlo Park Fire
District, and a University fire mar
shal responded to the scene.
After the building was declared
safe for decontamination, the Uni
versity's Environmental Health and
Safety hazardous-materials team
began clean-up. The building was
completely re-opened by 3 a.m. on
Wednesday.
The incident, according to Uni
versity police, is under investiga
tion.
No other injuries were reported.
Chemistry professor dies at age 89
Henry Taube. the emeritus Mar

A laboratory explosion at the
Stauffer Building 111 last Tuesday
placed Rodolfo Salgado-Ro
driguez, a visiting scholar from
Mexico, in critical condition at the
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
Salgado-Rodriguez was working
in a chemical engineering laborato

Hospital workers ready for strike
A majority of the Stanford University Medical Cen
ter's 1,300 employees, including nursing assistants, oper
ating room assistants, food service workers, housekeep
ers and lab assistants, voted to authorize a strike last
Tliesday if their contract demands are not met. The
workers, whose contracts expired on Nov. 13, are asking
fora 10 percent cost-of-living raise for the first year of
their contract and a 9 percent raise for the second and
third years. Negotiators for the hospital, however, are
proposing annual wage increases of 4 percent. Workers
are also demanding that their families receive health in
surance at no cost and that a job-security clause be put in

the contract.
In an interview with The San Mateo County Times,

Packard Children's Hospital said,"We feel we've listened
to the employees, and we feel many of their concerns
have been addressed. We have placed our last, best and
final offer on the table."
The union is required by law to give the hospital a 10-
