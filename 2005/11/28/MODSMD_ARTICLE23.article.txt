## Downsizing Stanford football's woes 
### 
As 1 watched the Stanford quarterbacks get
knocked around the past two Saturdays,
looking as if they had stepped into the
video game "NFL Blitz," 1 tried to figure out what
the football team needs, other than the ability to
leap halfway across the field.
Shorter pass routes? A fatter offensive line?
More of those mist machines on the sideline? The
triangle offense? Land mines?
Then Bill Walsh, Stanford's interim athletic di
rector, showed up on ABC during Big Game to talk
about the future of the program. When Walsh start
ed criticizing Cardinal head coach Walt Harris' strat
egy of having everyone go deep and wait until some
freak of a lineman pounded quarterback Trent Ed
wards into the turf, I was sure that Walsh's plan was
to march down to the sideline, put the headset on
and take over for Harris right then and there.
But the plan he discussed was even better.
Make the stadium smaller.
1 nearly leapt off my couch, the plan was so bril
liant, but 1 didn't have the energy. (What, you ex
pect me to actually go to games in that cavernous
death trap?)
The smaller stadium is scheduled to be complet
ed next year, just before the football team's annual
thrashing of a weak club like San Jose State or UC-
Dav...er, BYU. The main advantage is that it will
make the Tree look much bigger, frightening oppo
nents and energizing the crowd. But the California
and Notre Dame linemen,conversely, will also look
bigger. And the notes the Band misses will be that
much more obvious with the improved acoustics.
The Athletic Department's contribution to the
future success of the football program is a sweet
website that informs us all about the progress of
the construction. The biggest news item posted so
far is about the construction of the website. Stay
tuned, 1 guess.
According to the site, "Current stadium design
and occupancy lends itself to a cavernous setting;
therefore, reducing seat capacity will create a more
intimate, up-close game day experience for all our
fans."That's right: we will actually be able to feel the
ground shake when a USC player crushes a Cardi
nal quarterback's bones into powdered sugar.
Donors claim the new stadium will boost re
cruiting, because prospective players will see that
the University is committed to its football team
when they feast their eyes on the team's cozy new
home. Recruits are also sure to note that they will
not have to run as far when the coaches make them
sprint up and down the stadium steps after blowing
coverage assignments the week before.
The stands, now separated from the field by the
track that runs around it. will be brought 70 feet
closer, bringing viewers a mere 45 feet from the ac
tion. Still not as good as my TV at home, but it's an
improvement.
It will enable Walsh to shout out suggestions to
Harris without actually running onto the field. Fans
will sound louder to the players on the field. Stu
dents will also be able to chant their superior SAT
scores at the opposing team's bench. Cardinal
faithful can now confuse Oregon quarterbacks by
shouting out logging instructions, and all you Stan
ford women can confuse Matt Leinart by dressing
up like Jessica Simpson. On second thought, that
might confuse the Stanford team, as well.
The choice of artificial turf doesn't make much
sense to me because it is supposed to hurt more
than natural grass when your helmet is pounded
into it. Bouncy turf, a la pre-renovation Maples,
would have made more sense to me. Just picture
tailback Anthony Kimble catapulting over the de-
