### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over Thanksgiving break, the Stanford wrestling
squad competed in the Cal Open in Fullerton,
Calif., before notching its first dual meet win of the
season at San Francisco State. In the Cal Open on
Saturday Nov. 19, every Cardinal wrestler who took
part in the tournament scored at least one victory,
and three placed.
Sophomores Tanner Gardner at 125 pounds and
Scott Loescher at 165 took second and third place,
respectively, and senior Ray Blake took seventh in
the 165 weight-class.
"Our guys fought hard," head coach Kerry
McCoy said. "We have errors that we can concen
trate on and things we can work on. It was good for
us to see a lot of our Pacific-10 [Conference] com
petition, and next time, we'll be ready for them."
Stanford also took on the Gators last TUesday in
their second dual meet of the season. The win
against S.F. State evened the Cardinal's record this
season at 1-1 as Stanford wrestlers won in seven of
the 10 weight classes to defeat the Gators 30-9. The
Cardinal wrestle this Friday and Saturday at the Las
Vegas Invitational.
