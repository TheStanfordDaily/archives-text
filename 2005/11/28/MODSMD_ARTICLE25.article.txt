# Women earn NCAA crown
## Women claim second title in three years; men place sixth in Ind. 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
After finishing a trying race at the NCAA
Championships last Monday, the women of
Stanford cross country had no idea who had
captured the team title. For 15 minutes the Car
dinal had no idea they were moments away
from a national championship.
"At the end of the race, I thought if we made
the top four we could consider ourselves fortu
nate," head coach Peter Tegen said.
However, 15 minutes after the race had
ended, the official results came out. For the sec
ond time in three years, the Cardinal women
won the NCAA Cross Country Championships
in Terre Haute, Ind.. finishing with 146 points to
second-place Colorado's 181.

"Winning was a huge surprise to me, but I
also didn't pay much attention to the other
teams during the race," Tegen said. "I was fo
cused on our runners."
Sophomore Arianna Lambie, whose eighth
place finish paced the Cardinal, had no idea her
team had placed first.
"Not all of us had our best races, so right after
the race some of us were down and some of us were
happy," Lambie said. "But none of us expected the
victory, so when we found out we were thrilled."
Meanwhile, the men placed sixth among the
31 teams that competed last Monday, the highest
finish of a Pac-10 squad.
The women's race went out fast and Lambie
stayed up front throughout, finishing the 6,000-
meter course in 19:59.1.
"It was one of the hardest races I've ever
run," Lambie said. "I took a risk that caused me
to end in eighth-place, and I'm proud of having
gone for it. It was a hard race to finish â€” I was
depleted of all my energy at the end."
Junior Katy Trotter, redshirt freshman Lind

say Flacks and sophomore Lauren Centrowitz
were the Cardinal's second, third and fourth run
ners, respectively. They finished 20th, 25th and
47th of the 253 runners.
Sophomore Teresa McWalters was the fifth
and final scorer for the Cardinal, finishing 92nd
overall in 21:17.8. Redshirt freshman Katie Har
rington and junior Amanda Trotter were sixth
and seventh for the women.
"Teresa had difficulties in the last phase of
the race," Tegen said. "She did a tremendous
amount of work in the middle, so she was un
able to finish way up front. Everything was sort
of mixed up in terms of who you might expect
to see in front of whom. But it's to the credit of
the whole team that no matter which way they
finish in the end, they are all good enough to
battle it out with the best in the country."
The Cardinal entered the race ranked sec
ond, while Duke was ranked first in the nation.

breaking their season-long winning
streak.
"We were not the only team experi
encing that kind of topsy-turvy mix up
amidst our own team members,"Tegen
said. "It was true for Duke and for
Michigan, who went in ranked third
and finished sixth. None had a perfect
day, but that hardly ever happens."
According to Tegen, Centrowitz
felt the tides might be turning in
Stanford's favor when she passed a
group of Duke runners.
"Throughout the season we didn't
talk about it much, but the possibility
of winning the national championship
was on everyone's mind, "Tegen said.
"The idea wasn't totally out of reality."
On the men's side, the Cardinal
held their sixth-place rank with a
sixth-place finish.
Sophomore Nef Araia was 11 th
overall, finishing the l(),0(X)-meter race
in 29:51.6. Juniors Jonathan Pierce,
Jacob Gomez, and Brett Gotcher were
second, third and fourth-place finish
ers for the Cardinal.
Senior David Vidal was 84th over
all, the last scorer for the men. Red
shirt freshman Garrett Heath and
freshman John McGuire rounded
out the Cardinal lineup, coming in
85th and 101st out of 253 runners.
"Nef had a fantastic perform
ance,"Tegen said. "The men certain
ly had a very good performance
overall. A few guys did not have
their greatest day, but they still tried
to finish as strong as they possibly
could. No one threw in the towel."
Wisconsin won the team title eas
ily, with three of their runners finish
ing in the top 10. Arizona, who won
West Regionals two Saturdays ago,
finished 10th overall.
"I think we are on a good track, a
good beginning."Tegen said. "We can
build on this experience. The men
showed me there is a lot of upward
potential in this team."
Despite being a young team this
year (Vidal is the only graduating sen
ior) the men continued the tradition
of cross country domination. This
year marked the 12th straight season
that the men have finished sixth or
better at the NCAA Championships.
"As far as I am concerned, we lost
a bunch of strong athletes from last
year," Tegen said. "We have a few
youngsters waiting for their opportu
nity and a lot of potential."
