# Women earn NCAA crown
## Women claim second title in three years; men place sixth in Ind. 
### RACHEL HODARA STAFF WRITER 
After finishing a trying race at the NCAA
Championships last Monday, the women of
Stanford cross country had no idea who had
captured the team title. For 15 minutes the Car
dinal had no idea they were moments away
from a national championship.
"At the end of the race, I thought if we made
the top four we could consider ourselves fortu
nate," head coach Peter Tegen said.
However, 15 minutes after the race had
ended, the official results came out. For the sec
ond time in three years, the Cardinal women
won the NCAA Cross Country Championships
in Terre Haute, Ind.. finishing with 146 points to
second-place Colorado's 181.

"Winning was a huge surprise to me, but I
also didn't pay much attention to the other
teams during the race," Tegen said. "I was fo
cused on our runners."
Sophomore Arianna Lambie, whose eighth
place finish paced the Cardinal, had no idea her
team had placed first.
"Not all of us had our best races, so right after
the race some of us were down and some of us were
happy," Lambie said. "But none of us expected the
victory, so when we found out we were thrilled."
Meanwhile, the men placed sixth among the
31 teams that competed last Monday, the highest
finish of a Pac-10 squad.
The women's race went out fast and Lambie
stayed up front throughout, finishing the 6,000-
meter course in 19:59.1.
"It was one of the hardest races I've ever
run," Lambie said. "I took a risk that caused me
to end in eighth-place, and I'm proud of having
gone for it. It was a hard race to finish â€” I was
depleted of all my energy at the end."
Junior Katy Trotter, redshirt freshman Lind

say Flacks and sophomore Lauren Centrowitz
were the Cardinal's second, third and fourth run
ners, respectively. They finished 20th, 25th and
47th of the 253 runners.
Sophomore Teresa McWalters was the fifth
and final scorer for the Cardinal, finishing 92nd
overall in 21:17.8. Redshirt freshman Katie Har
rington and junior Amanda Trotter were sixth
and seventh for the women.
"Teresa had difficulties in the last phase of
the race," Tegen said. "She did a tremendous
amount of work in the middle, so she was un
able to finish way up front. Everything was sort
of mixed up in terms of who you might expect
to see in front of whom. But it's to the credit of
the whole team that no matter which way they
finish in the end, they are all good enough to
battle it out with the best in the country."
The Cardinal entered the race ranked sec
ond, while Duke was ranked first in the nation.
The Blue Devils finished the race in third place,
