## Cardinal wins out, home in early NCAAs 
### REBECCA HARLOW SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After finishing the Pacific-10
Conference season with three tough
wins over ranked opponents, the No.
5 Cardinal kickoff the NCAA Tour
nament this Friday, hosting Nevada.
A week ago, Stanford (25-5,14-4)
pulled out a five-game thriller over
visiting No. 12 California (18-10,10-
8), completing a season sweep of the
Bears. The Cardinal then spent
Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, where
they beat No. 16 UCLA (18-10,10-8)
and No. 13 Southern California (16-
10, 12-6) to close out the season.

Stanford took the Bruins down in
four games and fought off the
Women of Troy fora nail-biter of a
five-game victory.
"It was a phenomenal stretch for
us," head coach John Dunning said.
"We found out against Arizona [on
Nov. 11 ] that we are still good, but we
lost the match. What we had to find
out against Cal was that we could win
against a good team. We were really
tough when we had to be and we
won."
After a sluggish start in the first
game, Stanford rebounded to force a

decisive fifth game. Then, the Cardi
nal offense came alive while the
Bears sputtered, and Stanford tal
lied a 24-30.30-26,27-30,30-24,15-10
victory. Junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards paced the Cardinal with a
match-high 22 kills and 19 digs, while
junior middle blocker Lizzie Suiter
added five blocks at the net.
On the road against the Bruins,
Stanford again started slowly, drop
ping the first game 24-30. The Cardi
nal then rallied for the 30-28 win in
the second game and, after an easy
30-23 win in the third game, held off
a late rally for the 30-28 victory.
Richards again led the offense with a
then-career-high 31 kills on .367 hit
ting. Freshman middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo also had a ca
reer night with 12 total blocks in
cluding two solo. With 62 assists on
the day, senior setter Katie Gold
hahn topped 2,000 career assists.
USC pushed the Cardinal to the
limit and Stanford fought until the
end for the five-game win. Stanford
won the first game 30-27 but
dropped the second, 21-30. The next
two games mirrored the first two,
with the Cardinal winning 30-21 be
fore losing 27-30.
Stanford jumped out to a three
point lead early in the fifth game, but
the Trojans clawed back to a 9-9 tie.
The Cardinal once again managed to
pull away, ending the match 15-13 on
a block by Akinradewo and junior
right side Nji Nnamani. After tying
her career high the night before,
Richards shattered her old mark
with 35 kills.
"I just need to stay focused and
work hard for my team," Richards
said. "Everyone is doing a good job
and taking care of what they need to
for us to win."
Three other players had career
highs in kills for the Cardinal — Ak
inradewo with 22, Nnamani with 16
and freshman outside hitter Erin
Waller with 10, while Goldhahn
recorded a career-high 79 assists.
Akinradewo and Nnamani posted
seven block assists apiece and Waller
recorded the only solo block for the
Cardinal, who outdid the Trojans 12-
11 at the net.
"That road trip was really a chal
lenge, and I honestly had no idea
whether we would win one, two or
none," Dunning said. "But we were

just tough. We're tougher than a lot
of people might think we are."
After putting the exclamation
point on the conference season with
their hard-fought wins, the Cardinal
could only wait and watch as the
tournament seeding was an
nounced. Nervously munching on
pizza in the locker room, the team
counted down the minutes to the
11:30 a.m. start of the NCAA Selec
tion Show on Sunday morning.
When the wait finally ended, the
news was good for the Cardinal. The
fifth seed in the tournament, Stan
ford was preselected as a host of one
of the four NCAA Regionals in two
weeks and will also host the first and
second rounds this Friday and Satur
day. This news elicited lpud cheers
and pumped fists in the Maples lock
er room, especially from those mem
bers of the team and staff who re
member the long trip to Florida for
the first round last year.
"I have never been more excited
— the fact that we are playing at
home for the first four rounds,"
Richards said. "Obviously that will
be a huge advantage for us."
Stanford first faces unranked
Nevada (18-12,9-7 Western Athletic
Conference), who upset Cal in a
five-game match at a preseason
tournament in September. The Car
dinal have won all five matches be
tween the two teams.
If Stanford gets past Nevada, the
winner of the contest between Santa
Clara (23-4,12-2 West Coast Confer
ence) and Sacramento State (26-8,
13-1 Big Sky Conference) awaits
Saturday. The Cardinal is 23-0 all
time against Santa Clara and beat
Sacramento State 3-0 in the first
round of the 2003 NCAA Tourna
ment.
After the seeding was an
nounced, the team expressed some
concern upon hearing the rest of the
Stanford Regional bracket. If the fa
vorites win out, the Cardinal will
play host to No. 13 Ohio State and
conference foes No. 12 USC and No.
4 Arizona next week. The Cardinal
won both matches this season
against the Trojans but came up
short against the Wildcats twice.
"At this point, I think that for our
team, it is best for us to be confi
dent," Dunning said. "We just beat
USC on the road, and we just played
Arizona basically to a draw. We
know a lot about Santa Clara and
Nevada. I think confidence and fa
miliarity is better for us because that
is what we have been trying to gener
ate since the injuries."
