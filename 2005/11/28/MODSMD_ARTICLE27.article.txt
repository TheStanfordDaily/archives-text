# Hoops starts sluggishly
## Haryasz sorely missed against UC-Irvine, returns to spark victory against USF 
### DANIEL NOVINSON ALEX GYR DESK EDITORS 
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly. An old-fashioned tail-whooping.
— TRENT JOHNSON, following a 79-63 loss to UC-lrvine

Men's basketball started last season slow
ly, opening just 6-7 with unexpected defeats
at the hands of teams such as Santa Clara and
Tennessee. This year, fans had hoped the
trend would reverse, but Stanford again lost
an early contest to an undermanned oppo
nent, dropping its season-opener to UC-
Irvine, 79-63, on Saturday Nov. 19 at Maples
Pavilion.
"Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly," said head coach
TYent Johnson of a contest Stanford never led
after 2-0. "From start to finish, they were the
aggressor and they basically gave us an old
fashioned tail-whooping."'
In the loss, senior guard Dan Grunfeld
tied his career-high of 29 points, senior guard
Chris Hernandez added 13, and junior for
ward Fred Washington chipped in nine
points, eight of them coming in the second
half. Though medically cleared, senior for
ward Matt Haryasz sat out the contest after
spraining his left ankle in practice the day be
fore.
"Obviously, missing Matt is crucial," Her
nandez said. "On the one hand, he brings re
bounding, scoring and a defensive and emo
tional presence; but we did not guard the
three-point — same as last year — and we
just couldn't rebound."
Eight early points from senior guard Ross
Schraeder set the tone for UC-Irvine, as the
visiting Anteaters built a quick 14-2 lead.
Stanford (1-1) struggled defensively in the
first half, allowing UC-Irvine (3-2) to shoot
69 percent from the floor and 75 percent be
yond the arc en route to a 43-35 Anteater
halftime lead.
"A lot of the threes that they got, we were
just late," Hernandez said. "We hesitated for
a second — I got caught twice. Inside, we let
them get good post position, and they made
some tough turnaround shots as well."
Irvine started the second half in the same
dominant manner, gradually increasing its
eight-point margin to a 58-45 lead with 11:23
to play. Johnson said his squad failed to exe
cute the halftime adjustments made in the
locker room.
"One of the key parts of the game that re
ally disappointed me was the start of the sec
ond half," Johnson said. "At halftime, we had
talked about making a couple of adjustments
— three offensive calls, picking up full-court,
making sure they all had their assignments
and so forth — and then we come out and in
the first two minutes there's confusion."
Stanford rallied back, cutting the deficit to
61-56 with 3:54 remaining.The Cardinal drew
no closer as UC-Irvine's Shamar Armstrong
hit an off-balance three with the shot clock
running down and a defender in his face, and
the Anteaters cruised to the 16-point final
margin.
"TTiat was big for them," Grunfeld said.
"We played pretty good D' and he hit a fall
away three. But if you put yourself down five
with two minutes left, you can't afford for
them to get lucky, which will happen some
times."
Despite the pain of the defeat, Johnson
and his players are evaluating the perform
ance with a holistic view of the season.
"When you have a disappointing loss, you
never want to lose a game but it's not the end
of the world," Grunfeld said. "Maybe it teach
es you some things you could have done bet
ter, and hopefully we can use it to improve."
What a difference a big man makes. Four
days after Stanford fell to UC-Irivine without
their senior forward, the Cardinal and
Haryasz dominated the post and took a 71 -56
decision over San Francisco (1-2).
Haryasz made his presence felt from the
moment he stepped on the court, en route to
an 18-point, 11-rebound afternoon. He was
n't the only Stanford big man to contribute.
Sophomore Taj Finger, who made his first ca
reer start in the game, recorded career highs
of 15 points and six rebounds.
The play of the two forwards was encour
aging given Stanford's weak post play against
Irvine, that resulted in Stanford being out re
bounded by an underwhelming Anteater

frontcourt. Against USF the Cardinal mount
ed a 43-37 rebounding advantage.
The Cardinal took the lead early and
never faltered. Stanford jumped out to a 12
point lead 10 minutes into the first half and
went into the locker room at the half up by 15.
The Dons did manage to cut the lead to 10 in
the second half, but Stanford bumped the
lead up to 21 with eight minutes to go, cruis
ing to the victory.
Grunfeld. who took an astounding 28
shots in the loss to Irvine, was far more pa
tient against the Dons, taking only 11 shots
while scoring 16 points.
Stanford's defense did a good job shutting
down USF's highly touted backcourt of
Dommanic Ingerson and Armondo Surratt,
both transfers from big conference schools.
They combined for just 20 points.
Forward Alan Wiggins Jr., brother of Stan
ford women's basketball star Candice, had
the most success against a stingy Stanford de
fense, leading all scorers with 21 points.
The Cardinal face Cal Poly San Luis Obis
po (1-2) at home tonight. The Mustangs re
turn two starters from a team that last year
went just 5-22 last season and finished at the
bottom of the Big West Conference. If
Haraysz can repeat his performance against
the Dons, it could be a long night for the Mus
tangs, whose tallest player is 6-foot-9.

After sitting the 2004-05 season due to ineligibility, redshirt sophomore guard Tim Morris started strong
against UC-lrvine and USF, posting a combined six points and six rebounds.
Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly. An old-fashioned tail-whooping.
— TRENT JOHNSON, following a 79-63 loss to UC-lrvine

Men's basketball started last season slow
ly, opening just 6-7 with unexpected defeats
at the hands of teams such as Santa Clara and
Tennessee. This year, fans had hoped the
trend would reverse, but Stanford again lost
an early contest to an undermanned oppo
nent, dropping its season-opener to UC-
Irvine, 79-63, on Saturday Nov. 19 at Maples
Pavilion.
"Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly," said head coach
TYent Johnson of a contest Stanford never led
after 2-0. "From start to finish, they were the
aggressor and they basically gave us an old
fashioned tail-whooping."'
In the loss, senior guard Dan Grunfeld
tied his career-high of 29 points, senior guard
Chris Hernandez added 13, and junior for
ward Fred Washington chipped in nine
points, eight of them coming in the second
half. Though medically cleared, senior for
ward Matt Haryasz sat out the contest after
spraining his left ankle in practice the day be
fore.
"Obviously, missing Matt is crucial," Her
nandez said. "On the one hand, he brings re
bounding, scoring and a defensive and emo
tional presence; but we did not guard the
three-point — same as last year — and we
just couldn't rebound."
Eight early points from senior guard Ross
Schraeder set the tone for UC-Irvine, as the
visiting Anteaters built a quick 14-2 lead.
Stanford (1-1) struggled defensively in the
first half, allowing UC-Irvine (3-2) to shoot
69 percent from the floor and 75 percent be
yond the arc en route to a 43-35 Anteater
halftime lead.
"A lot of the threes that they got, we were
just late," Hernandez said. "We hesitated for
a second — I got caught twice. Inside, we let
them get good post position, and they made
some tough turnaround shots as well."
Irvine started the second half in the same
dominant manner, gradually increasing its
eight-point margin to a 58-45 lead with 11:23
to play. Johnson said his squad failed to exe
cute the halftime adjustments made in the
locker room.
"One of the key parts of the game that re
ally disappointed me was the start of the sec
ond half," Johnson said. "At halftime, we had
talked about making a couple of adjustments
— three offensive calls, picking up full-court,
making sure they all had their assignments
and so forth — and then we come out and in
the first two minutes there's confusion."
Stanford rallied back, cutting the deficit to
61-56 with 3:54 remaining.The Cardinal drew
no closer as UC-Irvine's Shamar Armstrong
hit an off-balance three with the shot clock
running down and a defender in his face, and
the Anteaters cruised to the 16-point final
margin.
"TTiat was big for them," Grunfeld said.
"We played pretty good D' and he hit a fall
away three. But if you put yourself down five
with two minutes left, you can't afford for
them to get lucky, which will happen some
times."
Despite the pain of the defeat, Johnson
and his players are evaluating the perform
ance with a holistic view of the season.
"When you have a disappointing loss, you
never want to lose a game but it's not the end
of the world," Grunfeld said. "Maybe it teach
es you some things you could have done bet
ter, and hopefully we can use it to improve."
What a difference a big man makes. Four
days after Stanford fell to UC-Irivine without
their senior forward, the Cardinal and
Haryasz dominated the post and took a 71 -56
decision over San Francisco (1-2).
Haryasz made his presence felt from the
moment he stepped on the court, en route to
an 18-point, 11-rebound afternoon. He was
n't the only Stanford big man to contribute.
Sophomore Taj Finger, who made his first ca
reer start in the game, recorded career highs
of 15 points and six rebounds.
The play of the two forwards was encour
aging given Stanford's weak post play against
Irvine, that resulted in Stanford being out re
bounded by an underwhelming Anteater

frontcourt. Against USF the Cardinal mount
ed a 43-37 rebounding advantage.
The Cardinal took the lead early and
never faltered. Stanford jumped out to a 12
point lead 10 minutes into the first half and
went into the locker room at the half up by 15.
The Dons did manage to cut the lead to 10 in
the second half, but Stanford bumped the
lead up to 21 with eight minutes to go, cruis
ing to the victory.
Grunfeld. who took an astounding 28
shots in the loss to Irvine, was far more pa
tient against the Dons, taking only 11 shots
while scoring 16 points.
Stanford's defense did a good job shutting
down USF's highly touted backcourt of
Dommanic Ingerson and Armondo Surratt,
both transfers from big conference schools.
They combined for just 20 points.
Forward Alan Wiggins Jr., brother of Stan
ford women's basketball star Candice, had
the most success against a stingy Stanford de
fense, leading all scorers with 21 points.
The Cardinal face Cal Poly San Luis Obis
po (1-2) at home tonight. The Mustangs re
turn two starters from a team that last year
went just 5-22 last season and finished at the
bottom of the Big West Conference. If
Haraysz can repeat his performance against
the Dons, it could be a long night for the Mus
