# Stadium, season tossed aside
## Cal wins fourth straight Bear defense stifles Cardinal attack 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
As they entered the 108 th Big
Game on Nov. 19, Stanford's seniors
had never beaten California or ad
vanced to a bowl, as the Cardinal last
accomplished those feats in 2001.Tty
as Stanford might, both streaks ex
tended another year, as the visiting
Golden Bears downed Stanford 27-3
on the strength of three second-half
touchdowns.
"You work all season towards a
game like this, and when things don't
work out your way, as a football play

er, as a competitor, it's extremely dis
appointing," junior quarterback
Trent Edwards said.
Early in the third quarter, Cal de
fensive tackle Brandon Mebane
sacked Edwards and knocked him
out of the contest with a shoulder
stinger. Sophomore quarterback TC
Ostrander filled in for the remainder
of a game in which both quarter
backs struggled. Edwards finished
with only 68 total yards and Ostran
der with 129.
"Trent's a great leader," senior
linebacker Jon Alston said. "I
thought TC came in and did well but
we've had a lot of key injuries and it's
difficult."
