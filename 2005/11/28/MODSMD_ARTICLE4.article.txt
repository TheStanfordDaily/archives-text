# Stadium, season tossed aside
## Cal wins fourth straight Bear defense stifles Cardinal attack 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
As they entered the 108 th Big
Game on Nov. 19, Stanford's seniors
had never beaten California or ad
vanced to a bowl, as the Cardinal last
accomplished those feats in 2001.Tty
as Stanford might, both streaks ex
tended another year, as the visiting
Golden Bears downed Stanford 27-3
on the strength of three second-half
touchdowns.
"You work all season towards a
game like this, and when things don't
work out your way, as a football play

er, as a competitor, it's extremely dis
appointing," junior quarterback
Trent Edwards said.
Early in the third quarter, Cal de
fensive tackle Brandon Mebane
sacked Edwards and knocked him
out of the contest with a shoulder
stinger. Sophomore quarterback TC
Ostrander filled in for the remainder
of a game in which both quarter
backs struggled. Edwards finished
with only 68 total yards and Ostran
der with 129.
"Trent's a great leader," senior
linebacker Jon Alston said. "I
thought TC came in and did well but
we've had a lot of key injuries and it's
difficult."

Three minutes into the second half,
Cal sophomore tailback Justin Forcett
received a right-side pitch and explod
ed past Stanford's defenders fora 21-
yard blow that put Cal ahead 13-3.
Bear quarterback Steve Levy scram
bled for 31 yards on two consecutive
plays to set up Forcett's score.
"Steve Levy — that guy did a great
job." Stanford head coach Walt Harris
said. "Those scrambles were a huge
part of that drive that broke our backs."
Cal iced the contest with two
fourth-quarter scores. First, freshman
tailback Marshawn Lynch — who fin
ished the contest with 121 rushing
yards en route to over 1,000 yards on
the season — punched in a three-yard
run with seven minutes remaining.
Then, with just two minutes left
and a 20-3 lead, Cal dug deep into the
playbook fora halfback pass, and
running back Terrell Williams found
tight end Craig Stevens in the corner
of the end zone.
"It's just what Cal does apparent
ly — Tedford's thing," Alston said.
"One could say that it was somewhat
classless, but, hey, it's a rivalry."
A failure to convert opportunities
haunted Stanford throughout the
contest. Senior cornerback TJ Rush
ing dropped a would-be interception

that hit him in both arms and the chest
on the drive that ended in Forcett's
score. Later, senior kicker Michael
Sgroi pushed a 41-yard field goal wide
right that would have cut the deficit to
just a touchdown with 9:31 to play.
Cal drew first blood when Levy hit
freshman receiver DeSean Jackson
fora 56-yard play action touchdown
over Rushing's outstretched arms. Se
nior safety Trevor Hooper blocked
the ensuing extra point, and Cal led 6-
0 with 9:29 remaining in the first.
The Cardinal cut the Bears' lead
to 6-3 with senior kicker Michael
Sgroi's 37-yard second-quarter field.
Neither team mustered another
score in the half, as both defenses
looked dominant early.The cross-bay
rivals combined for six sacks and
only 83 rushing yards and 221 total
yards in the first 30 minutes.
While Stanford yielded two sec
ond-half touchdowns, Cal's defense
remained stout throughout the con
test. Stanford finished with only 26
yards on 36 rushing attempts, and Cal's
defensive front sacked Ostrander and
Edwards a combined nine times.
"Today, primarily offensively, we
did not match up physically," Harris
said. "They had bigger, better,
stronger, faster guys."
