# Irish down Cardâ€”barely
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
The final contest at Stanford Stadium al
most lived up to the reputation of some of the
great players, teams and coaches that have
been there throughout its 84-year history.
Instead, it was a game that fit perfectly with
the trends of the 2005 season.
The Cardinal (5-6, 4-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) took the lead in the final two minutes
over No. 6 Notre Dame (9-2) but couldn't
hang on late, as a Darius Walker touchdown
run with 55 seconds to go gave the Irish a 38-
31 victory.
