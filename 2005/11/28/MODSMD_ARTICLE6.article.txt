can professor of African and African American
history at Stanford University and longtime resi
dent fellow of Branner Hall, passed away Mon
day, Nov. 21 in the Stanford Hospital. He suffered
from pulmonary fibrosis — a serious lung disease
— and lived to be 64.
Jackson influenced programs across the Uni
versity. He first joined the faculty in 1969 as an as
sistant professor and was involved in the Program
in African and African American Studies
(A A AS) for 35 years, serving as A A AS Director
from 1980 until 1989. He became the resident fel
low in Branner in 1985 and remained in the posi
tion for the past 20 years.
A memorial service will be held for Jackson at
Memorial Church in January and a memorial
Web site has been created to celebrate his life.
"For Branner, he had an amazing impact over

the last 25 years," said junior Mary Kate Hanlon,
resident assistant in Branner. "He was so in
volved, though it was not always obvious."
Hanlon stressed that Jackson was involved in
everything, "no matter how minor the detail" and
that his dedication was integral to Branner.
During his time at Stanford, Jackson pio
neered several programs, including the Under
graduate Scholars Program (USP), which pro
vides one-on-one mentoring and research guid
ance for minority and other students from faculty
members, in 1986.
Jackson also originated the tradition of Facul
ty Night in 1970 when he was a resident fellow for
Serra House in Stern Hall. Faculty Night gives
students a chance to interact with faculty mem
bers by inviting them to eat in the campus dining
halls for an evening.
Hanlon commented that since Jackson's
Campus mourns Jackson

death, the Branner staff has become aware of "how big
of an impact he had in programs across campus." She
said she remembered his comments at a staff meeting
before Faculty Night this year, especially when the staff
was deciding between paper and fabric tablecloths.
Jackson said paper was fine as long as they looked nice.
"He wanted the faculty to be proud to be here," she
said. Hanlon also mentioned she only recently learned
that he had developed Faculty Night and now under
stands why he was so involved and cared so much.
Jackson grew up in Virginia, attending segregated
schools as a child. He earned a bachelor's in biology and
chemistry in 1969 from Hampton University and later
won fellowships to study at UCLA, University of
Ghana and Cambridge University. He earned his doc
torate from UCLA in 1970.
Freshman Emily His, who lives in Branner, said she
was "captivated by Jackson's speech the first day we
moved in"and enjoyed his "witty, smart humor."
According to Hanlon, Jackson stayed full of humor
until the end. She visited him in the hospital and said he
was "still cracking jokes and asking about Branner."
"He wanted to know about the capture-the-flag

game two days before," Hanlon said.
The Branner staff is hoping to organize an informal
memorial or recognition for Jackson within the dorm.
More details will be decided at the staff meeting tomor
row evening.
In addition to his work at Stanford, Jackson is also
known for his book "America is Me: The Most Asked
and Least Understood Questions About Black Ameri
can History," published in 19%. He Co-edited a second
book with Stanford drama professor Harry J. Elam Jr.,
titled "Black Cultural Traffic: Crossroads in Global Per
formance and Popular Culture."The book is due out in
December.
Branner resident Julia Liebner, a freshman, remem
bered visiting Jackson's apartment for an ice cream so
cial and was struck by his "amazing collection of art
work. photographs and contemporary books."
"(His death] came as a shock to me," she said.

History Prof. Kennell Jackson, resident fellow in Branner hall, passed away last week in the Stanford Hospital of
pulmonary fibrosis.
Kennell A. Jackson, the only African Ameri
can professor of African and African American
history at Stanford University and longtime resi
dent fellow of Branner Hall, passed away Mon
day, Nov. 21 in the Stanford Hospital. He suffered
from pulmonary fibrosis — a serious lung disease
— and lived to be 64.
Jackson influenced programs across the Uni
versity. He first joined the faculty in 1969 as an as
sistant professor and was involved in the Program
in African and African American Studies
(A A AS) for 35 years, serving as A A AS Director
from 1980 until 1989. He became the resident fel
low in Branner in 1985 and remained in the posi
tion for the past 20 years.
A memorial service will be held for Jackson at
Memorial Church in January and a memorial
Web site has been created to celebrate his life.
"For Branner, he had an amazing impact over

the last 25 years," said junior Mary Kate Hanlon,
resident assistant in Branner. "He was so in
volved, though it was not always obvious."
Hanlon stressed that Jackson was involved in
everything, "no matter how minor the detail" and
that his dedication was integral to Branner.
During his time at Stanford, Jackson pio
neered several programs, including the Under
graduate Scholars Program (USP), which pro
vides one-on-one mentoring and research guid
ance for minority and other students from faculty
members, in 1986.
Jackson also originated the tradition of Facul
ty Night in 1970 when he was a resident fellow for
Serra House in Stern Hall. Faculty Night gives
students a chance to interact with faculty mem
bers by inviting them to eat in the campus dining
halls for an evening.
Hanlon commented that since Jackson's
Campus mourns Jackson

death, the Branner staff has become aware of "how big
of an impact he had in programs across campus." She
said she remembered his comments at a staff meeting
before Faculty Night this year, especially when the staff
was deciding between paper and fabric tablecloths.
Jackson said paper was fine as long as they looked nice.
"He wanted the faculty to be proud to be here," she
said. Hanlon also mentioned she only recently learned
that he had developed Faculty Night and now under
stands why he was so involved and cared so much.
Jackson grew up in Virginia, attending segregated
schools as a child. He earned a bachelor's in biology and
chemistry in 1969 from Hampton University and later
won fellowships to study at UCLA, University of
Ghana and Cambridge University. He earned his doc
torate from UCLA in 1970.
Freshman Emily His, who lives in Branner, said she
was "captivated by Jackson's speech the first day we
moved in"and enjoyed his "witty, smart humor."
According to Hanlon, Jackson stayed full of humor
until the end. She visited him in the hospital and said he
was "still cracking jokes and asking about Branner."
