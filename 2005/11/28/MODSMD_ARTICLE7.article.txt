# AWARDS & HONORS
## Two chosen for Rhodes Scholarships Seniors Tanya Haj-Hassan and Elizabeth Mayne picked 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Since 1905, Stanford has been home to 86
Rhodes Scholars, including two recent addi
tions as of Saturday, Oct. 19. Stanford seniors
Tanya Ali Haj-Hassan and Elizabeth Mayne
will be attending Oxford University next fall
on the world s oldest international fellowship
created by British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes in 1902.
Twenty-year-old Haj-Hassan of Amman.
Jordan, is majoring in human biology. While at
Stanford, her campus involvement has includ
ed co-founding the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East, serving as vice president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Network, volun
teering as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital and
researching neonatal mortality in Jordan with
an Undergraduate Research Opportunities
major grant. Haj-Hassan also initiated and ran
a summer camp for underprivileged children in
Jordan through a Haas Center for Public Ser
vice Fellowship. ALso, as one of the national di
rectors of the Aids Treatment Access Initiative,
she coordinated a walkathon in Chicago.
As part of the Bing Overseas Study Pro
gram, Haj-Hassan attended Oxford during her
junior year, which confirmed her interest in
pursuing a post-graduate degree there. Pedi
atrics Emeritus Prof. Raymond Hintz urged her
to apply for the Rhodes, writing one of her let
ters of recommendation.
"I know of no one more deserving," Hintz
said. "Tanya is an exceptional student and has
initiated several worthwhile health programs
beneficial to a diverse public. I fully expect we
will hear nothing but great accomplishments
from her in the future."
Starting next fall, Haj-Hassan will work to
ward a master of science degree in global health
science at Oxford. She described herself as
"stunned" when she learned she had been se
lected from the group of 16 Rhodes finalists in
the California district.
"I am extremely grateful that I have the sup
port to pursue a degree at Oxford, but I feel
very undeserving " Haj-Hassan said. "This is a
blessing from Allah, and I pray that 1 can make
the best out of it."
After completing her Oxford education,
Haj-Hassan plans to return to the Middle East,
particularly to her native Jordan, and work in
poverty alleviation and healthcare.
"With the region's recent rapid develop
ment, the well-being of the poorer segments of
the population is a serious concern," Haj-Has
san said. "I have always wanted to work with
the people of my country', and I hope that this
opportunity at Oxford will help prepare me for
this endeavor."
Those who know Haj-Hassan were proud to
learn of her accomplishment.
"She really deserves the Rhodes Scholar
ship and 1 am sure that she will utilize it to make
positive changes in the world," said Arabic Lan-
guage and Literature Lecturer Ramzi
Salti, who met Haj-Hassan in 2002
when she enrolled in a series of Arabic
literature courses. "Tanya has a
unique ability to balance East and
West, and scholars like her give us all
an undeniable sense of optimism re
garding East-West relations."
Arabic Prof. Khalil Barhoum, co
ordinator of Middle Eastern and
African languages and lit&'atures
who advised Haj-Hassan on her
minor in African and Middle Eastern
languages and literatures, noted that
she is well-liked and respected by her
colleagues.
"In my long career at Stanford and
my many close relationships with high
ly-gifted students, I can honestly say
that I have rarely come into contact
with a student matching the combina
tion of Tanya's discipline, devotion to
school work and commitment to one's
ethnic roots all at the same time,"
Barhoum said. "While her determina
tion and academic focus are exempla
ry, she is nonetheless very articulate
and well-spoken on Muslim and Arab
related matters. Not shying away from
her Arab background, she has used her
culturally diverse background as a mo
tivating force in her studies and in the
daily conduct of her life."
Pediatrics Prof. Susan Hintz was
Haj-Hassan's first reader for her
Human Biology Honors project
about neonatal mortality rates in

Jordan.
"As soon as 1 met her, I was utterly
and completely impressed by Tanya
â€” she was incredibly enthusiastic,
thoughtful, dedicated and one of the
most intelligent and organized stu
dents 1 had ever met," Hintz said. "She
planned and completed the data col
lection in five hospitals in Amman in
only a few months and is now deep
into her data analysis. She is truly fo
cused, and has done an amazing and
comprehensive job of looking at a
very complex yet crucially important
area of research."
Mayne, 23, of Denver, Colorado, is
majoring in biological sciences. A for
mer competitive freestyle skier, she
Ifflfe served as co-chair of the Denver
Mayor's Commission on Youth, per
formed with the Stanford Shake
speare Society and volunteered with
a Shakespeare workshop for at-risk
high school students that she helped
develop.
Mayne decided to apply for the
Rhodes Scholarship after taking Eng
lish Prof. Larry Friedlander's overseas
seminar in Oxford on Shakespearean
production.
"Elizabeth is a wonderfully gifted
student in literature and theater, so 1
was surprised to learn she was major
ing in biology, since she could have
easily had a career in the humanities,"
Friedlander said. "This kind of multi
talented student is rare and valuable.
She seems also to have a very pure in
terest in learning, in reflecting on and
in exploring the world."
Next fall at Oxford, Mayne will
pursue a master of science degree (by
research) in physiology, focusing on

ion flow and transport in information
transduction with either the Calcium
Signaling Group or the Oxford lon
Channel Initiative. She then plans to
earn a joint MDand Ph.D. to perform
translational research and practice in
academic medicine.
Mayne started her academic ca
reer by studying physics, but during
her junior year she decided to major
in biology.
"Changing my major so late has
made the past two years a bit hectic,
but 1 think it encapsulates one of the
best aspects of my experience at Stan
ford," Mayne said. "Throughout my
time here, my professors and advisors
have encouraged me to pursue learn
ing for its own sake. At Stanford, 1
think the focus is on becoming educat
ed, not just credentialed. and this at
mosphere has allowed me to study in
a wide variety of disciplines."
Mayne said she encourages other
Stanford students to apply for the
Rhodes.
"Applying entails a tremendous
amount of work, but writing the per
sonal statement and interviewing also
prepare you for job and graduate
school interviews," Mayne said. "It
forces you to evaluate your plans and
interests, which I found invaluable as 1
complete my education at Stanford."
Thirty-two American Rhodes
Scholars are selected each year for
two to three years of study at Oxford.
The scholarship covers educational
fees, travel costs and a maintenance
fund for necessary expenses while at
tending the university. Recipients
enjoy an average annual value of

culturally diverse background as a mo
tivating force in her studies and in the
daily conduct of her life."
Pediatrics Prof. Susan Hintz was
Haj-Hassan's first reader for her
Human Biology Honors project
about neonatal mortality rates in

Jordan.
"As soon as 1 met her, I was utterly
and completely impressed by Tanya
â€” she was incredibly enthusiastic,
thoughtful, dedicated and one of the
most intelligent and organized stu
dents 1 had ever met," Hintz said. "She
planned and completed the data col
lection in five hospitals in Amman in
only a few months and is now deep
into her data analysis. She is truly fo
cused, and has done an amazing and
comprehensive job of looking at a
very complex yet crucially important
area of research."
Mayne, 23, of Denver, Colorado, is
majoring in biological sciences. A for
mer competitive freestyle skier, she
Ifflfe served as co-chair of the Denver
Mayor's Commission on Youth, per
formed with the Stanford Shake
speare Society and volunteered with
a Shakespeare workshop for at-risk
high school students that she helped
develop.
Mayne decided to apply for the
Rhodes Scholarship after taking Eng
lish Prof. Larry Friedlander's overseas
seminar in Oxford on Shakespearean
production.
"Elizabeth is a wonderfully gifted
student in literature and theater, so 1
was surprised to learn she was major
ing in biology, since she could have
easily had a career in the humanities,"
Friedlander said. "This kind of multi
talented student is rare and valuable.
She seems also to have a very pure in
terest in learning, in reflecting on and
in exploring the world."
Next fall at Oxford, Mayne will
pursue a master of science degree (by
research) in physiology, focusing on

ion flow and transport in information
transduction with either the Calcium
Signaling Group or the Oxford lon
Channel Initiative. She then plans to
earn a joint MDand Ph.D. to perform
translational research and practice in
academic medicine.
Mayne started her academic ca
reer by studying physics, but during
her junior year she decided to major
in biology.
"Changing my major so late has
made the past two years a bit hectic,
but 1 think it encapsulates one of the
best aspects of my experience at Stan
ford," Mayne said. "Throughout my
time here, my professors and advisors
have encouraged me to pursue learn
ing for its own sake. At Stanford, 1
think the focus is on becoming educat
ed, not just credentialed. and this at
mosphere has allowed me to study in
a wide variety of disciplines."
Mayne said she encourages other
Stanford students to apply for the
Rhodes.
"Applying entails a tremendous
amount of work, but writing the per
sonal statement and interviewing also
prepare you for job and graduate
school interviews," Mayne said. "It
forces you to evaluate your plans and
interests, which I found invaluable as 1
complete my education at Stanford."
Thirty-two American Rhodes
Scholars are selected each year for
two to three years of study at Oxford.
The scholarship covers educational
fees, travel costs and a maintenance
fund for necessary expenses while at
tending the university. Recipients
enjoy an average annual value of
$40,(XX) per year.
Since 1905, Stanford has been home to 86
Rhodes Scholars, including two recent addi
tions as of Saturday, Oct. 19. Stanford seniors
Tanya Ali Haj-Hassan and Elizabeth Mayne
will be attending Oxford University next fall
on the world s oldest international fellowship
created by British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes in 1902.
Twenty-year-old Haj-Hassan of Amman.
Jordan, is majoring in human biology. While at
Stanford, her campus involvement has includ
ed co-founding the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East, serving as vice president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Network, volun
teering as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital and
researching neonatal mortality in Jordan with
an Undergraduate Research Opportunities
major grant. Haj-Hassan also initiated and ran
a summer camp for underprivileged children in
Jordan through a Haas Center for Public Ser
vice Fellowship. ALso, as one of the national di
rectors of the Aids Treatment Access Initiative,
she coordinated a walkathon in Chicago.
As part of the Bing Overseas Study Pro
gram, Haj-Hassan attended Oxford during her
junior year, which confirmed her interest in
pursuing a post-graduate degree there. Pedi
atrics Emeritus Prof. Raymond Hintz urged her
to apply for the Rhodes, writing one of her let
ters of recommendation.
"I know of no one more deserving," Hintz
said. "Tanya is an exceptional student and has
initiated several worthwhile health programs
beneficial to a diverse public. I fully expect we
will hear nothing but great accomplishments
from her in the future."
Starting next fall, Haj-Hassan will work to
ward a master of science degree in global health
science at Oxford. She described herself as
"stunned" when she learned she had been se
lected from the group of 16 Rhodes finalists in
the California district.
"I am extremely grateful that I have the sup
port to pursue a degree at Oxford, but I feel
very undeserving " Haj-Hassan said. "This is a
blessing from Allah, and I pray that 1 can make
the best out of it."
After completing her Oxford education,
Haj-Hassan plans to return to the Middle East,
particularly to her native Jordan, and work in
poverty alleviation and healthcare.
"With the region's recent rapid develop
ment, the well-being of the poorer segments of
the population is a serious concern," Haj-Has
san said. "I have always wanted to work with
the people of my country', and I hope that this
opportunity at Oxford will help prepare me for
this endeavor."
Those who know Haj-Hassan were proud to
learn of her accomplishment.
"She really deserves the Rhodes Scholar
ship and 1 am sure that she will utilize it to make
positive changes in the world," said Arabic Lan-
guage and Literature Lecturer Ramzi
Salti, who met Haj-Hassan in 2002
when she enrolled in a series of Arabic
literature courses. "Tanya has a
unique ability to balance East and
West, and scholars like her give us all
an undeniable sense of optimism re
garding East-West relations."
Arabic Prof. Khalil Barhoum, co
ordinator of Middle Eastern and
African languages and lit&'atures
who advised Haj-Hassan on her
minor in African and Middle Eastern
languages and literatures, noted that
she is well-liked and respected by her
colleagues.
"In my long career at Stanford and
my many close relationships with high
ly-gifted students, I can honestly say
that I have rarely come into contact
with a student matching the combina
tion of Tanya's discipline, devotion to
school work and commitment to one's
ethnic roots all at the same time,"
Barhoum said. "While her determina
tion and academic focus are exempla
ry, she is nonetheless very articulate
and well-spoken on Muslim and Arab
related matters. Not shying away from
her Arab background, she has used her
culturally diverse background as a mo
tivating force in her studies and in the
