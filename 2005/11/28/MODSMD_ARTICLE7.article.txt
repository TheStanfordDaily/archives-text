Since 1905, Stanford has been home to 86
Rhodes Scholars, including two recent addi
tions as of Saturday, Oct. 19. Stanford seniors
Tanya Ali Haj-Hassan and Elizabeth Mayne
will be attending Oxford University next fall
on the world s oldest international fellowship
created by British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes in 1902.
Twenty-year-old Haj-Hassan of Amman.
Jordan, is majoring in human biology. While at
Stanford, her campus involvement has includ
ed co-founding the Coalition for Justice in the
Middle East, serving as vice president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Network, volun
teering as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital and
researching neonatal mortality in Jordan with
an Undergraduate Research Opportunities
major grant. Haj-Hassan also initiated and ran
a summer camp for underprivileged children in
Jordan through a Haas Center for Public Ser
vice Fellowship. ALso, as one of the national di
rectors of the Aids Treatment Access Initiative,
she coordinated a walkathon in Chicago.
As part of the Bing Overseas Study Pro
gram, Haj-Hassan attended Oxford during her
junior year, which confirmed her interest in
pursuing a post-graduate degree there. Pedi
atrics Emeritus Prof. Raymond Hintz urged her
to apply for the Rhodes, writing one of her let
ters of recommendation.
"I know of no one more deserving," Hintz
said. "Tanya is an exceptional student and has
initiated several worthwhile health programs
beneficial to a diverse public. I fully expect we
will hear nothing but great accomplishments
from her in the future."
Starting next fall, Haj-Hassan will work to
ward a master of science degree in global health
science at Oxford. She described herself as
"stunned" when she learned she had been se
lected from the group of 16 Rhodes finalists in
the California district.
"I am extremely grateful that I have the sup
port to pursue a degree at Oxford, but I feel
very undeserving " Haj-Hassan said. "This is a
blessing from Allah, and I pray that 1 can make
the best out of it."
After completing her Oxford education,
Haj-Hassan plans to return to the Middle East,
particularly to her native Jordan, and work in
poverty alleviation and healthcare.
"With the region's recent rapid develop
ment, the well-being of the poorer segments of
the population is a serious concern," Haj-Has
san said. "I have always wanted to work with
the people of my country', and I hope that this
opportunity at Oxford will help prepare me for
this endeavor."
Those who know Haj-Hassan were proud to
learn of her accomplishment.
"She really deserves the Rhodes Scholar
ship and 1 am sure that she will utilize it to make
positive changes in the world," said Arabic Lan-
