## Business School receives $30 million Bass family pledges money to expand offerings 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford alumnus Robert M. Bass and
his wife, Anne, pledged $30 million to the
Graduate School of Business two weeks
ago.The gift, the single largest in the 80-year
history of the school, will help expand a new
form of small group seminars, enlarge the
faculty endowment and fund a matching
program for other alumni.
Ten million dollars will fund small-group
seminars that allow students to lead self-di
rected research with the help of faculty
members. The classes, which will be called
Bass Seminars, are billed as hands-on learn
ing experiences where instructors set a

loose agenda, student teams research issues
of interest to them and the groups report
back to the class what they learn. Enroll
ment will he capped at 20 or 30 students, the
school stated in a press release, instead of
the usual 60 to 72 for clectives.
Several courses meet the criteria to be
come Bass Seminars, but until now there
has not been adequate funding for each of
the 375 students in the MBA program to
take a class of this kind. The school said it
needs the equivalent of at least eight new
faculty members for each student to take at
least one Bass Seminar during their two
year course of study
The seminars are designed with a cross
discipline focus.The School gives the exam
ple of the kind of class that could become a
seminar called "Strategy Making in the In
formation Technology Industry." The
course is taught by Management Prof.

Robert Burgelman and former Intel chief
executive officer Andy Grove and allows
students to focus on personal areas of inter
est such as developments in China or the
role of IT (information technology) in the
music industry. The instructors lecture ini
tially, hut most of the course is the discus
sion of the teams' findings.
Potential Bass Seminar subjects, accord
ing to the press release announcing the gift,
include "macroeconomic analysis, projects
in international development, entrepre
neurial design for extreme affordability and
the human resource management of 'tal
ent.'"
"Stanford Business School is better posi
tioned than any of its peers to offer this type
of course because the seminars leverage
both the intimate nature of the Stanford
MBA Program and the tremendous
resources provided by Stanford Uni
versity," said Robert L. Joss, dean of
the GSB, in his announcement of the
gift.
"[The seminars] fit well the culture
of cross-school interaction being fos
tered by University President John
Hennessy," he added, noting that busi
ness students worked with students
from the Engineering and Medical
Schools to study bio-design innova
tion.
The Basses directed $15 million to
ward the Business School's faculty en
dowment, which allows the school to
hire new professors and support re
search.
Five million dollars is allotted for
an alumni matching program. Alumni
who increase their gift to the business
school by 50 percent year-over-year

will have the gift matched by the Bass
es in a program known as The Bass
Challenge.
Joss expects that the commitment
by the Basses to match donations by
alumni who increase their support for
the University will lead to more giving
than ever.
"This very generous and strategic
gift not only provides us with direct
funds but encourages other alumni to
leverage their donation and make a
larger gift to the school than might
otherwise have been possible," Joss
said.
Robert Bass said he hopes that
more alumni will give as a result of his
gift.
"Our hope is to encourage and cre
ate greater giving and support by of
fering recognition and matching op
portunities for our fellow alumni and
donors," Bass said in a statement re
leased by the school. "These funds will
enable the Stanford Graduate School
of Business to deepen and expand its
high-quality teaching programs and
resources across the board."

Bass, who graduated with a mas
ters in business administration from
the University in 1974, is the presi
dent of Keystone, Inc., a Fort Worth,
Tex.-based investment firm. Forbes
Magazine estimated Bass' net worth
earlier this year to be $3 billion. Bass
has made his fortune in oil, gas, real
estate, financial services and manu
facturing.
He has been active in Stanford
University affairs since his gradua
tion. He is a member of the Graduate
School of Business Advisory Council,
former chair of the University's
Board of Trustees and former chair
man of Stanford Management Com
pany. Anne and Robert Bass co-chair
the Stanford Campaign for Under
graduate Education. This fund has
raised $1 billion for undergraduates.
Anne Bass is a director of the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. She co
chaired the campaign that helped the
hospital raise $500 million.
According to the Associated Press,
Bass also personally donated $25 mil
lion to Stanford in June 1992.

otherwise have been possible," Joss
said.
Robert Bass said he hopes that
more alumni will give as a result of his
gift.
"Our hope is to encourage and cre
ate greater giving and support by of
fering recognition and matching op
portunities for our fellow alumni and
donors," Bass said in a statement re
leased by the school. "These funds will
enable the Stanford Graduate School
of Business to deepen and expand its
high-quality teaching programs and
resources across the board."

Bass, who graduated with a mas
ters in business administration from
the University in 1974, is the presi
dent of Keystone, Inc., a Fort Worth,
Tex.-based investment firm. Forbes
Magazine estimated Bass' net worth
earlier this year to be $3 billion. Bass
has made his fortune in oil, gas, real
estate, financial services and manu
facturing.
He has been active in Stanford
University affairs since his gradua
tion. He is a member of the Graduate
School of Business Advisory Council,
former chair of the University's
Board of Trustees and former chair
man of Stanford Management Com
pany. Anne and Robert Bass co-chair
the Stanford Campaign for Under
graduate Education. This fund has
raised $1 billion for undergraduates.
Anne Bass is a director of the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. She co
chaired the campaign that helped the
hospital raise $500 million.
According to the Associated Press,
Bass also personally donated $25 mil
lion to Stanford in June 1992.
Stanford alumnus Robert M. Bass and
his wife, Anne, pledged $30 million to the
Graduate School of Business two weeks
ago.The gift, the single largest in the 80-year
history of the school, will help expand a new
form of small group seminars, enlarge the
faculty endowment and fund a matching
program for other alumni.
Ten million dollars will fund small-group
seminars that allow students to lead self-di
rected research with the help of faculty
members. The classes, which will be called
Bass Seminars, are billed as hands-on learn
ing experiences where instructors set a

loose agenda, student teams research issues
of interest to them and the groups report
back to the class what they learn. Enroll
ment will he capped at 20 or 30 students, the
school stated in a press release, instead of
the usual 60 to 72 for clectives.
Several courses meet the criteria to be
come Bass Seminars, but until now there
has not been adequate funding for each of
the 375 students in the MBA program to
take a class of this kind. The school said it
needs the equivalent of at least eight new
faculty members for each student to take at
least one Bass Seminar during their two
year course of study
The seminars are designed with a cross
discipline focus.The School gives the exam
ple of the kind of class that could become a
seminar called "Strategy Making in the In
formation Technology Industry." The
course is taught by Management Prof.

Robert Burgelman and former Intel chief
executive officer Andy Grove and allows
students to focus on personal areas of inter
est such as developments in China or the
role of IT (information technology) in the
music industry. The instructors lecture ini
tially, hut most of the course is the discus
sion of the teams' findings.
Potential Bass Seminar subjects, accord
ing to the press release announcing the gift,
include "macroeconomic analysis, projects
in international development, entrepre
neurial design for extreme affordability and
the human resource management of 'tal
ent.'"
"Stanford Business School is better posi
tioned than any of its peers to offer this type
of course because the seminars leverage
both the intimate nature of the Stanford
MBA Program and the tremendous
resources provided by Stanford Uni
versity," said Robert L. Joss, dean of
the GSB, in his announcement of the
gift.
"[The seminars] fit well the culture
of cross-school interaction being fos
tered by University President John
Hennessy," he added, noting that busi
ness students worked with students
from the Engineering and Medical
Schools to study bio-design innova
tion.
The Basses directed $15 million to
ward the Business School's faculty en
dowment, which allows the school to
hire new professors and support re
search.
Five million dollars is allotted for
an alumni matching program. Alumni
who increase their gift to the business
school by 50 percent year-over-year

will have the gift matched by the Bass
es in a program known as The Bass
Challenge.
Joss expects that the commitment
by the Basses to match donations by
alumni who increase their support for
the University will lead to more giving
than ever.
"This very generous and strategic
gift not only provides us with direct
funds but encourages other alumni to
leverage their donation and make a
larger gift to the school than might
otherwise have been possible," Joss
said.
Robert Bass said he hopes that
more alumni will give as a result of his
