## Business School receives $30 million Bass family pledges money to expand offerings 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford alumnus Robert M. Bass and
his wife, Anne, pledged $30 million to the
Graduate School of Business two weeks
ago.The gift, the single largest in the 80-year
history of the school, will help expand a new
form of small group seminars, enlarge the
faculty endowment and fund a matching
program for other alumni.
Ten million dollars will fund small-group
seminars that allow students to lead self-di
rected research with the help of faculty
members. The classes, which will be called
Bass Seminars, are billed as hands-on learn
ing experiences where instructors set a

loose agenda, student teams research issues
of interest to them and the groups report
back to the class what they learn. Enroll
ment will he capped at 20 or 30 students, the
school stated in a press release, instead of
the usual 60 to 72 for clectives.
Several courses meet the criteria to be
come Bass Seminars, but until now there
has not been adequate funding for each of
the 375 students in the MBA program to
take a class of this kind. The school said it
needs the equivalent of at least eight new
faculty members for each student to take at
least one Bass Seminar during their two
year course of study
The seminars are designed with a cross
discipline focus.The School gives the exam
ple of the kind of class that could become a
seminar called "Strategy Making in the In
formation Technology Industry." The
course is taught by Management Prof.

Robert Burgelman and former Intel chief
executive officer Andy Grove and allows
students to focus on personal areas of inter
est such as developments in China or the
role of IT (information technology) in the
music industry. The instructors lecture ini
tially, hut most of the course is the discus
sion of the teams' findings.
Potential Bass Seminar subjects, accord
ing to the press release announcing the gift,
include "macroeconomic analysis, projects
in international development, entrepre
neurial design for extreme affordability and
the human resource management of 'tal
ent.'"
"Stanford Business School is better posi

of course because the seminars leverage
both the intimate nature of the Stanford
