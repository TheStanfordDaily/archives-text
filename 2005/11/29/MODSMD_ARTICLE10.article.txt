# Former Iraq minister points to new abuses
## Alleged human rights abuses equal to former regime 
### ROBERT H. REID ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) —
Iraq's former interim prime minis
ter complained Sunday that
human rights abuses by some in
the new government are as bad
now as they were under Saddam
Hussein.
Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite
Muslim, told the London newspa
per The Observer that fellow Shi
ites are responsible for death
squads and secret torture centers
and said brutality by elements of
Iraqi security forces rivals that of
Saddam's secret police.
"People are remembering the
days of Saddam. These were the pre
cise reasons that we fought Saddam
and now we are seeing the same
thing," the newspaper quoted Allawi
as saying.
In Canada, meanwhile, a Par
liament official said four aid
workers, including two Canadi
ans, had been kidnapped in Iraq
but refused to name their group
or say where they were seized.
Britain's Foreign Office identi
fied one of the four as Norman
Kember, a Briton, but provided
no further details.
Elizabeth Colton. a U.S. Em
bassy spokeswoman, said the
United States was investigating
whether an American also was
among the missing.
Most international organiza
tions fled Iraq last year following
a wave of kidnappings and be
headings of foreign and Iraqi

hostages. Many of them were car
ried out by al-Qaida in Iraq, led
by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-
Zarqawi.
The U.S. military reported that
a Marine assigned to the 2nd Ma
rine Aircraft Wing was killed Sat
urday when his vehicle struck a
roadside bomb near CampTaqad
dum, 45 miles west of Baghdad. At
least 2,106 U.S. military personnel
have died since the Iraq war start
ed in March 2003, according to an
Associated Press count.
Allawi's allegation of wide
spread human rights abuses fol
lows the discovery this month of
up to 173 detainees, some mal
nourished and showing signs of
torture, in a Shiite-led Interior
Ministry building in Baghdad.
"People are doing the same as
Saddam's time and worse," he
said."lt is an appropriate compar
ison."
His remarks appeared aimed at
winning favor among the Sunni
Arab minority as well as secular
Shiites ahead of the Dec. 15 parlia
mentary elections. Allawi is run
ning on a secular ticket that in
cludes several prominent Sunnis.
During his tenure as prime
minister, Allawi lost the support
of many Shiites because he
brought back former members of
Saddam's Sunni-dominated
regime back into the security
services to bolster the fight
against insurgents.
There was no comment from
Shiite politicians on Allawi's in
terview. However, the leader of
Iraq's biggest Shiite party said al
legations of torture were distor
tions and might be designed to
draw attention away from the
Saddam's trial, which resumes
Monday after a five-week break.
