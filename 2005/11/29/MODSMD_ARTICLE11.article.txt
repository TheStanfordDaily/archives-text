## Building a better laser Professor and grad student turn heads with quantum leap in technology 
### CHETAN SHARMA 
In today's information age, the turnover
of technology can occur at a miraculous
rate. While consumers see this progress in
the form of new generations of iPods made
on a bi-weekly basis and bantam-weight
laptops flying off the shelves, the driving
force behind these goods is an oft-unsung
piece of equipment: the laser.
Thanks to the work of Stanford Electri
cal Engineering Prof Jelena Vuckovic and
applied physics graduate student Hatice
Altug, computer chips could soon be based
not upon the flow of electricity through a
circuit, but rather upon the movement of
lasers through an optical system.
After all, what's faster than the speed of
light?
Earlier this month, Vuckovic and Altug
announced their creation of an energy-effi
cient, high-speed modulation laser that can
produce a significant amount of power.
Currently, lasers operate as vertical cav
ity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs).
These lasers consume a great amount of en
ergy before transmitting data at a rate of up
to 20 gigabits per second (Gbps).
But the new laser developed by Vuck
ovic and Altug consumes a mere fraction of
the energy and can theoretically transfer
data at rates exceeding 1 (X) Gbps.
"The new Stanford laser does in two di
mensions what VCSELs do in one. allowing
for considerably smaller lasers" wrote
Andy Patrizio in a Nov. 23 article published
on Extremephoton.com. an online technol
ogy news site.
Vuckovic and Altug's pint-sized and ac
tion-packed laser is based on photonic crys
tal wafers containing four layers of indium
phosphate. Each wafer layer contains a
nine-by-nine grid of holes measuring a mi
croscopic 400 nanometers in diameter.
By staggering the holes at fixed inter
vals, the laser gives rise to microcavities
capable of holding light photons. As light
hits the wafer, it energizes the electrons of
the indium phosphate, making them jump
to a higher energy level and then fall back
to the previous energy level, emitting light
of a specific wavelength as the electron
tails back.
The key to enhanced laser function is the
presence of these microcavities, which
speed up the continuous absorbance and re
lease of photons within the layer. When one
group of light photons becomes excited, the
presence of other photons of light increases
the speed at which light is emitted.
The idea of using microcavities is not en
tirely new. Others have tried manufacturing
lasers with a single laser, but are only able to
attain powers of a few billionths of a watt.
The new laser made by Vuckovic and Altug
is able to emit 12niillionthsofa watt.on the
order of 100 times the power of single mi
crocavity lasers.
Additionally, the wafer contains four
layers of indium-phosphate material of
varying refraction indices. As a result,
Vukovic and Altug make it possible to
transfer data along many different wave
lengths.
Meanwhile, the research team arbitrarily
chose a nine-by-nine grid of microcavities.

"We could have easily made more mi
crocavities than 81," Vuckovic says. "We
could increase the number and theoretical
ly make a chip with even more power."
Regardless of grid size, the new laser is
economically promising. For one. it's small
— 4()().()(M) lasers could fit on a one square
centimeter chip, allowing it to fit on the
smallest of computer chips.
What's more, a company with the suit
able resources to manufacture wafers on a
large scale could do so relatively inexpen
sively.
"We had to use electron lithography to
make our wafer, which is expensive," Altug

explains."But IBM or Intel can use [ultravi
olet] lithography to make wafers cheaply."
There are still many steps that Vuckovic
and Altug must take to improve the laser
technology. The pair wants to bring their
theories to life and show that the laser can
transfer data at 100 hits per second (bps).
Vuckovic has already written a paper on
a method to modulate lasers at 1(H) bps, so
all that remains is to combine the method
and the wafer.
Another goal is to power the laser with
electricity rather than light, so it can be in
tegrated into electrical systems such as
computers.

"Iliere is very little point in powering an
efficient laser with inefficient, wasteful
[current industry standards]," Vuckovic
says.
Nevertheless, Vuckovic and Altug say
they're optimistic about the technology and
the forms it could take.
"Iliere are many applications for the
laser — such biological sensing — as the
laser is extremely sensitive to the environ
ment" Altug says.
It may be some time before lasers are
fully incorporated into computer systems,
but this is certainly a step in the right di
rection.

THE FUTURE
The tech industry set a project
ed fiber optic data transfer rate
of 40 Ghps. Once fully realized,
Stanford's new laser will more
than double this limit. In the
next few years, Vuckovic and
Altug hope to improve efficien
cy by powering this new laser
electrically.
