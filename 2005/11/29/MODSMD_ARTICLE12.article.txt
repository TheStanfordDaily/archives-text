# Learn to play tag and you won't be intimidated by cryptic HTML
## 
### 
In today's day and age, everyone should
know a little bit of HTML. lITML stands
for HyperText Markup Language and is
the lingua franca of cyberspace. Everything
you see on the Web is wrapped in HTML.
Consequently, any content that makes its
way onto the Web will first have to be refor
matted into HTML.
So if you want to make a Web site, post to
certain blogs or just write fancy text in fo
rums. it is useful to understand HTML. Even
journalists have had to adopt the standard.
Before this article makes it to the Web. some
poor soul in the newsroom will go through it
and add in HTML tags.
And now it is more important than ever to
have a positive Web presence. A recent Wall
Street Journal article reported that corpora
tions such as Microsoft are increasingly reliant
on Web searches to weed out job applicants,
even before the first interview. Creating your
own homepage is one way you can regain
some influence over what those prospective
employers find when they go Googling for
your name.
This week's column will walk you through the
steps of creating your first (very simple) Web
page in 1 fTML.

TAG! You're it!
In 1993, Tim Berners-Lee developed
1 ITML to navigate files from one computer to
another. The language itself revolves around
"tags" — short descriptions that your com
puter's browser can read. Each browser gives
a little directive that says things like "Fetch an
image and place it here,""Make this bold" or
"Put me in the first column of this table."
Tags start with a less-than sign and end in
a greater-than sign. e.g. <title>. And tags
often come in pairs. For example, the tag to
make text bold is <b>, and the tag to stop
making text bold is </b>.When these tags are
placed into regular 'ol text documents with
the file extension ".html," your Web browser
can interpret them to turn regular text into
the vibrant Web sites we have grown to love.
To sec tags in action,open up any Web page
and view the source. In Internet Explorer or

Firefox, go "View" -> "Source." Among other
things, you should see lots and lots of tags.
No Such Thing as a Free Lunch
You may be saying to yourself,"There has
to be an easier way to make Web pages than
to write all of this HTML stuff by hand." You
would be partially correct. Dreamweaver,
Front Page. Mozilla Composer and even Mi
crosoft Word all allow you to create docu
ments in the usual fashion and will then
translate your work into HTML for you.
But these "WYSIWYG" — or. What-You-
See-Is-What-You-Get — programs are
finicky beasts. They each have their own
menus and user interfaces — and in the case of
Dreamweaver, learning to navigate the mess
can be more difficult than learning HTML in
the first place. Invariably WYSIWYG's will
make mistakes and misinterpret your docu
ment into code. At some point you will have to
crack open the code and edit it directly.so it's a
good idea to learn HTML from the get-go.
Your First Web page
To start out. open up a text editor, like
Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on a Mac.
Our first Web site will go something like this:

<html>
<body>
ITiis is my Web page! I'm <i>really</i>
<b>happy</b>. I visit <a href= "http://stan
forddaily.com ">The Stanford Daily</a>
</body>
</html>
The <HTML> tag tells our browser that
this is HTML. Next, we start the body of our
page with the body tag. <body>. Type your
message to the world in your body. To format
your text add in a bold tag.<b>,or an italics tag.
<i> , and then close these tags with </b> or
</i>, respectively. The highlight of our simple
site will be a link .To create a link,enclose some
text in the anchor tags. <a> and </a>. Inside
the first anchor tag add in the text "href=" fol
lowed by a Web site enclosed in quotations.
To view your Web page, save your file with
a ".html" extension. In TextEdit, be sure to
enable the plain-text format by going to
"Format" -> "Make Plaintext."
Next.open up your file in your favorite brows
er by going "File"->" Open". You should see
your masterpiece flash onto the screen.

icr than most people think. Fora quick but de

To the Web and Beyond!
Stanford students can share their new cre
ation with the world by using their free Stan
ford Web space. For more information, see my
column from Oct. 11. or search for directions

There is more to the Web than just
HTML. Countless technologies from Cas
cading Style Sheets to Javascript work next
to and behind HTML to create the flashy, dy
namic sites that you navigate everyday. But
HTML is at the core of all of these technolo
gies. and a familiarity with the basics should
carry you a long way.
With 11TML. any content on the Web is only
a few tags away.
