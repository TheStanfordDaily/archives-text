## Editorial CDC needs more funds to reach all students 
### 
Among the diverse majors that under
graduates study, the variety of pas
sions they develop while on the
Farm, one thing will eventually affect all of
them: Every one needs a job. Sure, many un
dergraduates postpone "the real world" by
co-terming, heading off to graduate school
or even traveling fora while, but this only de
lays the inevitable.
The University needs to recognize this
fact and provide more resources at the Ca
reer Development Center — the best vehi
cle for students to find out what jobs are
open, which employers are hiring and where
to go for summer internships.
The CDC caters well to students interest
ed in certain paths, especially those who
chose majors based on career prospects. But
seniors who opted to follow a fuzzier passion
— especially within the humanities — are
often left casting about, while friends who
majored in engineering or economics with
an eye toward the job market may already
have their first jobs.
This is not at all the fault of the CDC. It
cannot single-handedly alter corporate re
cruiting practices or cater to all liberal arts
undergraduates. But the CDC can and
should publicize its services more broadly to
clue in the rest of campus (freshmen, sopho
mores and juniors, history and communica
tion majors, for example) to the materials
and opportunities that are already there.
Students should not be making their first
contact with the CDC during fall quarter of
their senior years.
The CDC offers career counseling, re
sume reviews and mock interviews. It even
makes time for same-day appointments. It
hires students to do peer advising and pub
lishes print and online guides to hundreds of
careers — not only consulting and invest
ment banking.
These resources are underutilized and
probably always will be. Stanford is an aca
demic institution run by professors, so even
though the president and most board mem
bers have industry experience, the world
outside academia tends to go overlooked in
day-to-day interactions on campus.The Uni
versity implicitly encourages students to at
tend graduate school and pursue academic
careers.
The reality of the situation, however, is
that most students will not end up in acade
mia. Most will attend graduate school —
whether immediately or after spending time
in the workforce — but Stanford graduates
ultimately find themselves in a wide variety
of careers ranging from public service to
teaching to government to health care to
publishing to marketing to, of course, con
sulting and banking. Because virtually
everyone eventually gets some sort of job,
students should start thinking about what
they want to do as early as possible — and
the CDC should have the resources to help
them, no matter what their interests.
We have some concrete suggestions for
improving outreach. The CDC should be

given funds specifically to upgrade its Web
site. Although the design is better now than
it was at the beginning of the year, students
can only find what they need by examining
every option. Great resources like the Stan
ford Career Network — thousands of alum
ni who have volunteered to be contacted —
get lost among many other similarly named
resources.
The CDC should also allow students to
see where they fit in among their peers by
placing more statistics on its site. While stu
dents can currently find out that 40 percent
of graduates get jobs through networking, it
is not clear which industries rely more heav
ily on networking, where all the other jobs
come from or even how many students enter
the job market immediately. Salary statistics
are also woefully inadequate. Only some en
gineering fields are represented, forcing stu
dents faced with two weeks to decide on job
offers to rely on anecdotes and close friends
for guidance.
Cardinal Recruiting should be revamped
to make it more user-friendly for both stu
dents and employers. Earlier this year,
dozens of master's students were banned
from the program — the main resource for
on-campus interviews — after they claimed
to be undergraduate students ("Career Cen
ter bans master's students," Oct. 27). While
they should not have misrepresented them
selves, the system should allow students
more flexibility in presenting themselves to
employers. Biology majors who spend sum
mers programming Java should be able to at
least have their resumes considered along
side computer science majors, and graduate
students who desire entry-level jobs should
get the same chance as undergraduates.
Beyond the Web site, the CDC should
reach out to students through dorm pro
gramming, greater contact with advisers and
more career panels. It already offers resume
workshops and some sessions tailored to
ward academic job searches or preparation
for career fairs. But much more could be
done. It should team up with academic de
partments to bring in alumni who entered
the private sector or government after get
ting a degree in English, philosophy or
chemistry. In the end. the CDC should be
granted enough resources to reach every
student, as its goals affect almost everyone
on campus.
The prominence of software engineering,
consulting and investment banking firms on
campus is a boon for the CDC — students
can connect with employers more easily. But
it also presents a huge challenge. The Uni
versity should devote more resources to the
majority of students who choose not to enter
these industries immediately following grad
uation. A Stanford degree is not designed to
place students in certain careers, and most
degrees do not provide specific training, but
the University should see the reality that
most students get non-academic jobs and de
vote more resources to helping students re
gardless of their destinations.
