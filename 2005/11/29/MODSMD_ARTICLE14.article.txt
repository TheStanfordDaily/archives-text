Give Walt Harris a chance
I have to disagree with Bob Dugoni's
criticism of Stanford football head coach
Walt Harris and his suggestion to fire him
("Football needs change," Nov. 28). As
someone who wrote in to this page calling
for Buddy Teevens' firing after all three of
his miserable seasons, Harris deserves to
stay.
Yes, the loss to UC-Davis was embarrass
ing. However, this team had a chance against
UCLA and Notre Dame. Under Teevens,
this team may well have folded after the
Davis loss.
Harris also had to deal with major in
juries to the receiving corps and offensive
line this year. Regardless of those injuries,
this team left it on the field every game. The
players never quit — something I hadn't
seen at Stanford Stadium since 2001.
This was a disciplined team, too — an
other thing that was sorely missed during
the previous three seasons. No need for Har
ris to high-five a player after he gets ejected
for his second personal foul of the game.
As for recruiting. UC-Berkeley has had
three classes recruited by Jeff Tedford. while
our last three classes were recruited by an in
creasingly ineffective Teevens. Harris does
need to upgrade the talent, and he knows it.
Let's see what he comes up with. He de
serves that chance.
Harris also needs to make some changes
in the offense. He needs to better protect
TVent Edwards — not by improving the line,
but by changing the play-calling and Ed
wards' propensity to sit in the pocket until
he gets hit. Harris needs to run some shorter
routes — slant-ins and quick outs — and
find some screen passes other than to the
running back over the middle. He needs to
teach Edwards to get out of the pocket

and/or throw the ball away after four to six
seconds, rather than the seven to eight sec
onds we saw most of this year. No offensive
line can hold back a rush for that long with
any consistency.
I'm looking forward to next season with
Harris at the helm.
He has shown that he is a major upgrade
from Teevens — which isn't saying much
but is nonetheless true. At a minimum, he
has earned the right to lead the Cardinal
next year. But make no mistake that without
a bowl bid next year, there will be more crit
ics like Dugoni.

Vegetarianism justified
Regarding Navin Sivanandam's Novem
ber 16,2(X)5 article, "The lobster was look
ing straight at me, and I burst into tears,"
Sivanandam claims that vegetarians are
"misguided" in their "faith," and cites five
arguments that (supposedly) represent a
"consensus" among his vegetarian friends:
(1) dislike for the taste of meat, (2) the God
told-me-not-to-eat-meat argument, (3) per
sonal health concerns. (4) efficiency (which
Sivanandam characterizes as guided by our
need to "preserve our rapidly diminishing
stock of cattle") and (5) the ethics argument
(which he describes as the "bunnies are
soooo cute" argument). Actually, it would
appear that it is Sivanandam who is mis
guided (or, perhaps, more charitably, unin
formed).
There are (at least) three sound argu
ments for vegetarianism: (1) environmental
concerns (the amount of resources it takes
to produce meat is staggering), (2)
the health argument (vegetarians
suffer, on average, from lower mor
bidity rates than meat-eaters) and
(3) the ethical argument (not that
bunnies are so cute, but rather that

most food animals are sentient be
ings who are tortured, suffer greatly,
and executed before they make it to
your plate). Perhaps it would do
Sivanandam some good to explore
the facts surrounding the production
of animals for food before claiming
vegetarianism to be another "mind
less" form of "religious worship."
