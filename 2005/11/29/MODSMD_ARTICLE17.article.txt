# See America right
## 
### 
You want to see America right. You
want to have the quintessential Amer
ican experience before gas hits $5 a
gallon. You want to have adventures in corn
fields and at truck stops. You, my friend, want
a road trip.
Pick your traveling companions. Assem
ble a group of friends with complementary
strengths, like the A-Team. Take someone
who is calm and level-headed, who will dif
fuse the fights that occur when hungry and
cranky people are stuffed into a car for too
long. Take someone you are not terribly at
tached to — you inevitably will come to hate
at least one person on the trip, so you might
as well plan ahead. For the sake of group
drama, this person should be as passive-ag
gressive as humanly possible. Take someone
who can generate spontaneous fun while
you're stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic in
sweltering heat, and can come up with spur of
the moment plans in an unfamiliar city.
Hedge your bets and take two of these, as this
type of team member is the most likely to be
come violently ill for the duration of the trip
and spend most of his time sleeping. A navi
gator will come in handy as well — someone
who isn't likely to say. "My map disagrees.
The road is wrong!" or point to an exit as you
pass it and comment,"l think that was where
we wanted to get off."
Pick a destination. Make it far away so
that you will be forced to choose between
staying in a motel and taking shifts driving
white-knuckled and drowsy. It will only be an
authentic road trip if the drive is a struggle, a
fight between you. the car and the road.
Find friends and relatives you can stay
with. They won't really be able to house you

and your friends comfortably. Don't worry
your Asian friend will volunteer to sleep on
the floor. Constantly thank your host for her
hospitality until she secretly wishes for you to
leave so she can stop hearing about it.
Pick a car, a small car, the smallest you can
find, preferably a two-door. It will make the
trip that much more intimate. Pick the
newest car available so as to look cool while
on this journey. This, too, will help the group
bond, since the only person willing to drive
the car will be the owner. The group will thus
split cleanly into two camps — the driver vs.
everyone else. Everyone else will want to get
to the destination as quickly as possible; the
driver will want to get there in such a manner
that he does not get a speeding ticket.
Make sure the car has a sunroof, so that at
3 a.m., delirious from sleeping in a bed sized
fora six-year-old girl, you can look out at the
stars and notice that if you squint a certain
way, you can almost see them as points of
light hung in a three-dimensional matrix.
In preparation for the drive, go to the su
permarket. Wander up and down the aisles
trying to make decisions by consensus in
total silence. The shorter the trip, the more
food you should buy. Your band of intrepid
travelers is likely to die of starvation if you

don't have a box of cheese nips and a bag of
red seedless grapes in the car. Buy lots of en
ergy drinks. Not only do these help compen
sate for exhaustion, but they also help stave it
off. Tell your nervous system, "Don't wimp
out on me or I'll drink a Red Bull!" It will lis
ten.
During the drive, make sure to discuss
hot-button topics such as politics, the mean
ing of life, music, the relative attractiveness of
girls you've dated, global warming, Indian
off-shoring and Will Ferrell. Defend your po
sitions as if your life depended on it. This will
make the drive that much more interesting.
Alternate who gets to choose the next
CD. skipping over those whose musical tastes
are not worth speaking of. Burn up inside
when it's your turn to put in a CD and every
one else is talking over it. Periodically turn on
the radio for egregiously incorrect traffic
alerts that claim large portions of the United
States are inaccessible from the interstate
you are currently on, marvel when the radio
endlessly seeks through the empty spectrum
when driving through mountains, wait for it
to settle on a country music station for you
and your friends to mock mercilessly until
you find yourself singing along with the cho
ruses.
Do not plan activities in advance. Every
one will get sick and need to sleep for much
of the trip, so there's no point — it will just
cause you regret. Debate going to museums.
Rationalize your belief that culture is dead
with your desire to turn off your brain while
on vacation. Daydream about picking up a
girl at a bar/cafe/park and ditching your

friends to go home with her. Imagine
how you would explain it to them,
how you would get back to them.
Realize this will never happen.
Visit empty college campuses and
project onto them all the images of a
perfect school that you had when
you chose to come to Stanford.
Imagine midday trips to the
beach/slopes/downtown with a pic
turesque sitcom-style group of inces
tuous friends. Realize these are the
same thoughts you had when you
saw the Stanford campus for the first
time.
Leave your laptop at home.
Spend much of the trip fantasizing
about checking e-mail. Instead, take
too many books with you — big
heavy tomes that you've always
meant to get around to reading. Re
alize you didn't really want to spend
time with your friends anyway, you

just wanted to get away and read.
Wonder when you'll get a chance to
do this. Read the opening line of
"For Whom The Bell Tolls" over and
over. Pick up a Dan Brown novel just
to see. Read it voraciously. Pack a
change of clothes for each day of the
trip. Wear the same outfit you were
wearing when you started out until it
is stained with taco grease.
Run yourself ragged on the trip.
Get at everyone's throat. Make the
trip home a mad dash to remove
yourself from these peoples' compa
ny as quickly as possible. Return
home to your bed and your things
and your personal space. Wonder
why you ever left in the first place,
why you ever talked to these people
and if you ever will talk to them after
this. Swear never to do it again.
Make tentative plans to go to
Banff next time. Sleep on it.

David hopes to one day go on a suc
cessful road trip and not come back
with a tnono-like illness. Have sugges
tions on how to do this? E-mail him at

turesque sitcom-style group of inces
tuous friends. Realize these are the
same thoughts you had when you
saw the Stanford campus for the first
time.
Leave your laptop at home.
Spend much of the trip fantasizing
about checking e-mail. Instead, take
too many books with you — big
heavy tomes that you've always
meant to get around to reading. Re
alize you didn't really want to spend
time with your friends anyway, you

just wanted to get away and read.
Wonder when you'll get a chance to
do this. Read the opening line of
"For Whom The Bell Tolls" over and
over. Pick up a Dan Brown novel just
to see. Read it voraciously. Pack a
change of clothes for each day of the
trip. Wear the same outfit you were
wearing when you started out until it
is stained with taco grease.
Run yourself ragged on the trip.
Get at everyone's throat. Make the
trip home a mad dash to remove
yourself from these peoples' compa
ny as quickly as possible. Return
home to your bed and your things
and your personal space. Wonder
why you ever left in the first place,
why you ever talked to these people
and if you ever will talk to them after
this. Swear never to do it again.
Make tentative plans to go to
Banff next time. Sleep on it.

David hopes to one day go on a suc
cessful road trip and not come back
with a tnono-like illness. Have sugges
tions on how to do this? E-mail him at
hlackmad@stanford.edu.
You want to see America right. You
want to have the quintessential Amer
ican experience before gas hits $5 a
gallon. You want to have adventures in corn
fields and at truck stops. You, my friend, want
a road trip.
Pick your traveling companions. Assem
ble a group of friends with complementary
strengths, like the A-Team. Take someone
who is calm and level-headed, who will dif
fuse the fights that occur when hungry and
cranky people are stuffed into a car for too
long. Take someone you are not terribly at
tached to — you inevitably will come to hate
at least one person on the trip, so you might
as well plan ahead. For the sake of group
drama, this person should be as passive-ag
gressive as humanly possible. Take someone
who can generate spontaneous fun while
you're stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic in
sweltering heat, and can come up with spur of
the moment plans in an unfamiliar city.
Hedge your bets and take two of these, as this
type of team member is the most likely to be
come violently ill for the duration of the trip
and spend most of his time sleeping. A navi
gator will come in handy as well — someone
who isn't likely to say. "My map disagrees.
The road is wrong!" or point to an exit as you
pass it and comment,"l think that was where
we wanted to get off."
Pick a destination. Make it far away so
that you will be forced to choose between
staying in a motel and taking shifts driving
white-knuckled and drowsy. It will only be an
authentic road trip if the drive is a struggle, a
fight between you. the car and the road.
Find friends and relatives you can stay
with. They won't really be able to house you

and your friends comfortably. Don't worry
your Asian friend will volunteer to sleep on
the floor. Constantly thank your host for her
hospitality until she secretly wishes for you to
leave so she can stop hearing about it.
Pick a car, a small car, the smallest you can
find, preferably a two-door. It will make the
trip that much more intimate. Pick the
newest car available so as to look cool while
on this journey. This, too, will help the group
bond, since the only person willing to drive
the car will be the owner. The group will thus
split cleanly into two camps — the driver vs.
everyone else. Everyone else will want to get
to the destination as quickly as possible; the
driver will want to get there in such a manner
that he does not get a speeding ticket.
Make sure the car has a sunroof, so that at
3 a.m., delirious from sleeping in a bed sized
fora six-year-old girl, you can look out at the
stars and notice that if you squint a certain
way, you can almost see them as points of
light hung in a three-dimensional matrix.
In preparation for the drive, go to the su
permarket. Wander up and down the aisles
trying to make decisions by consensus in
total silence. The shorter the trip, the more
food you should buy. Your band of intrepid
travelers is likely to die of starvation if you

don't have a box of cheese nips and a bag of
red seedless grapes in the car. Buy lots of en
ergy drinks. Not only do these help compen
sate for exhaustion, but they also help stave it
off. Tell your nervous system, "Don't wimp
out on me or I'll drink a Red Bull!" It will lis
ten.
During the drive, make sure to discuss
hot-button topics such as politics, the mean
ing of life, music, the relative attractiveness of
girls you've dated, global warming, Indian
off-shoring and Will Ferrell. Defend your po
sitions as if your life depended on it. This will
make the drive that much more interesting.
Alternate who gets to choose the next
CD. skipping over those whose musical tastes
are not worth speaking of. Burn up inside
when it's your turn to put in a CD and every
one else is talking over it. Periodically turn on
the radio for egregiously incorrect traffic
alerts that claim large portions of the United
States are inaccessible from the interstate
you are currently on, marvel when the radio
endlessly seeks through the empty spectrum
when driving through mountains, wait for it
to settle on a country music station for you
and your friends to mock mercilessly until
you find yourself singing along with the cho
ruses.
Do not plan activities in advance. Every
one will get sick and need to sleep for much
of the trip, so there's no point — it will just
cause you regret. Debate going to museums.
Rationalize your belief that culture is dead
with your desire to turn off your brain while
on vacation. Daydream about picking up a
girl at a bar/cafe/park and ditching your
