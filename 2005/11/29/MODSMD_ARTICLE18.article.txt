# The 						Pinkeye Plague: A cautionary tale
## 
### 
By special request of my RA. today's
column is about pinkeye. Yes, that's
right. Pinkeye. You know, when your
eye turns a lovely shade of crimson and you
wake up in the morning unable to lift your
eyelid because a layer of nasty crustiness
has glued it to your face.
OK, so it's not a topic that everybody
(or anybody, probably) wants to read
about, especially over their morning
doughnut and cup of coffee. But it does
bring up some very real health concerns
and thus is worthy of a campus-wide public
service announcement:
Attention Stanford Student: It is winter.
You are living in a dorm. You are going to
get sick. But don't worry; we have already
added the medical fees to your winter-quar
ter hill
A couple of weeks ago. my dorm could
have used such a warning about the immi
nence of disease-season — although, more
than likely, it would not have prevented the

inevitable, considering how many people
and their germs all share the same door
knobs, stair-rails and remote controls. Alas,
a wave of illness swept the dorm as one
person after another contracted the pink
eye virus, unstoppable by even our most
valiant efforts at sanitation.
For days, we lived in fear that we would
be the next victims of "the eye." Notices ap
peared in the hallways: "Wash your hands
often. Don't touch your face." People
scrawled messages on their whiteboards:
"If you have pinkeye, stay out!" E-mails

flooded the dorm list: "I have pinkeye.
Don't come near me if you value your
health." I imagine that anyone who be
lieves in reincarnation suffered a night
marish week of flashbacks to London dur
ing the time of the Bubonic Plague.
Fortunately, the epidemic was relatively
short-lived (and not quite as tragic as the
Black Death), but we have not yet been
able to shake it from our minds. We haven't
forgotten how viciously it segregated the
dorm. The ill were quarantined in their
rooms and relegated to the "Pink Sink" in
the bathroom; people on "safe" floors
never even ventured to the disease-ridden
areas. The somewhat reasonable, but large
ly irrational fear was so widespread and
pervasive that pinkeye effectively became
our modern-day version of leprosy.
Though the dorm appears to have been
cleansed of this particular disease, the pos-

Moment of Zen
sibility of other outbreaks lingers at
the back of everybody's minds. It's
nearing that cold, rainy season
when illness is unavoidable. We
don't eat right — and even if we try
to. we're too busy stressing out
about classes (or. more likely, our
love lives) for it to have any posi
tive influence on our health. I won't
even mention how low sleep ranks
on a college student's to-do list.
On top of all that, the popula
tion density in a dorm is ridiculous
ly high, with roommate pairs
crammed into 10-foot by 12-foot
boxes with neighbors literally two
steps away from each other. Life —
both human and bacterial — is
everywhere. Every time a person
exhales, there is someone else right
there waiting to breathe in that air,
germs and all. The cleaning staff
could scrub down the bathrooms
and vacuum the hallways all day,
but their efforts would be in vain;
no matter how hard you try to
change it, the fact remains that a
dorm is just not a clean place.

There is a silver lining, however:
Everybody gets sick at the same
time. Granted, for about a week,
the whole dorm is quieter and
more miserable than usual. But, as
we all gain immunity to the ail
ment-of-the-month, dorm life
picks up again and pretty soon
things are back to normal.
Except, now that we know it
won't be long until the next epi
demic puts a damper on our lives,
we pull out all the stops to make
the most of our time while we are
still up for it.

love lives) for it to have any posi
tive influence on our health. I won't
even mention how low sleep ranks
on a college student's to-do list.
On top of all that, the popula
tion density in a dorm is ridiculous
ly high, with roommate pairs
crammed into 10-foot by 12-foot
boxes with neighbors literally two
steps away from each other. Life —
both human and bacterial — is
everywhere. Every time a person
exhales, there is someone else right
there waiting to breathe in that air,
germs and all. The cleaning staff
could scrub down the bathrooms
and vacuum the hallways all day,
but their efforts would be in vain;
no matter how hard you try to
change it, the fact remains that a
dorm is just not a clean place.

There is a silver lining, however:
Everybody gets sick at the same
time. Granted, for about a week,
the whole dorm is quieter and
more miserable than usual. But, as
we all gain immunity to the ail
ment-of-the-month, dorm life
picks up again and pretty soon
things are back to normal.
Except, now that we know it
won't be long until the next epi
demic puts a damper on our lives,
we pull out all the stops to make
the most of our time while we are
still up for it.

By special request of my RA. today's
column is about pinkeye. Yes, that's
right. Pinkeye. You know, when your
eye turns a lovely shade of crimson and you
wake up in the morning unable to lift your
eyelid because a layer of nasty crustiness
has glued it to your face.
OK, so it's not a topic that everybody
(or anybody, probably) wants to read
about, especially over their morning
doughnut and cup of coffee. But it does
bring up some very real health concerns
and thus is worthy of a campus-wide public
service announcement:
Attention Stanford Student: It is winter.
You are living in a dorm. You are going to
get sick. But don't worry; we have already
added the medical fees to your winter-quar
ter hill
A couple of weeks ago. my dorm could
have used such a warning about the immi
nence of disease-season — although, more
than likely, it would not have prevented the

inevitable, considering how many people
and their germs all share the same door
knobs, stair-rails and remote controls. Alas,
a wave of illness swept the dorm as one
person after another contracted the pink
eye virus, unstoppable by even our most
valiant efforts at sanitation.
For days, we lived in fear that we would
be the next victims of "the eye." Notices ap
peared in the hallways: "Wash your hands
often. Don't touch your face." People
scrawled messages on their whiteboards:
"If you have pinkeye, stay out!" E-mails

flooded the dorm list: "I have pinkeye.
Don't come near me if you value your
health." I imagine that anyone who be
lieves in reincarnation suffered a night
marish week of flashbacks to London dur
ing the time of the Bubonic Plague.
Fortunately, the epidemic was relatively
short-lived (and not quite as tragic as the
Black Death), but we have not yet been
able to shake it from our minds. We haven't
forgotten how viciously it segregated the
dorm. The ill were quarantined in their
rooms and relegated to the "Pink Sink" in
the bathroom; people on "safe" floors
never even ventured to the disease-ridden
areas. The somewhat reasonable, but large
ly irrational fear was so widespread and
pervasive that pinkeye effectively became
our modern-day version of leprosy.
Though the dorm appears to have been
cleansed of this particular disease, the pos-

sibility of other outbreaks lingers at
the back of everybody's minds. It's
nearing that cold, rainy season
when illness is unavoidable. We
don't eat right — and even if we try
to. we're too busy stressing out
about classes (or. more likely, our
love lives) for it to have any posi
tive influence on our health. I won't
even mention how low sleep ranks
on a college student's to-do list.
