# The
						Pinkeye Plague: A cautionary tale
## 
### 
By special request of my RA. today's
column is about pinkeye. Yes, that's
right. Pinkeye. You know, when your
eye turns a lovely shade of crimson and you
wake up in the morning unable to lift your
eyelid because a layer of nasty crustiness
has glued it to your face.
OK, so it's not a topic that everybody
(or anybody, probably) wants to read
about, especially over their morning
doughnut and cup of coffee. But it does
bring up some very real health concerns
and thus is worthy of a campus-wide public
service announcement:
Attention Stanford Student: It is winter.
You are living in a dorm. You are going to
get sick. But don't worry; we have already
added the medical fees to your winter-quar

A couple of weeks ago. my dorm could
have used such a warning about the immi
nence of disease-season â€” although, more
than likely, it would not have prevented the

inevitable, considering how many people
and their germs all share the same door
knobs, stair-rails and remote controls. Alas,
a wave of illness swept the dorm as one
person after another contracted the pink

valiant efforts at sanitation.
For days, we lived in fear that we would
be the next victims of "the eye." Notices ap

often. Don't touch your face." People
scrawled messages on their whiteboards:
"If you have pinkeye, stay out!" E-mails

flooded the dorm list: "I have pinkeye.
Don't come near me if you value your
health." I imagine that anyone who be
lieves in reincarnation suffered a night
marish week of flashbacks to London dur
ing the time of the Bubonic Plague.
Fortunately, the epidemic was relatively
short-lived (and not quite as tragic as the
Black Death), but we have not yet been
able to shake it from our minds. We haven't
forgotten how viciously it segregated the
dorm. The ill were quarantined in their
rooms and relegated to the "Pink Sink" in
the bathroom; people on "safe" floors
never even ventured to the disease-ridden
areas. The somewhat reasonable, but large
ly irrational fear was so widespread and
pervasive that pinkeye effectively became
our modern-day version of leprosy.
Though the dorm appears to have been
cleansed of this particular disease, the pos-
