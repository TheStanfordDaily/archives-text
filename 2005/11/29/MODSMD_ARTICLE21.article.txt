# Men trounce Cal Poly
## Cardinal come alive in the second half to pull away with convincing win

We have better players, better depth and better talent...
but we haven't played to that level yet.
HEAD COACH TRENT JOHNSON

During the first half of last night's
game against Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo at Maples Pavilion, the Car
dinal looked like the team that lost
to UC-Irvine in its season opener.
They were tentative on offense, set
tling for contested jumpers, and
lackadaisical on defense, allowing
the smaller Mustangs to penetrate
for easy lay-ups and pound the ball
inside.
The team that came out in the
second half looked more like the
Cardinal (2-1) that many expected
to see this season, dictating the pace
and using their size and quickness to
pull away to win, 82-58.
"1 wish I knew," head coach Trent
Johnson said when asked what
caused Stanford's energetic second
half performance. "It was a good
turnaround, but it's what I want to
see at the start of the game. We have
a lot of veterans on this team, and to
start games like we started this one is
disappointing."
After trading baskets with a
more aggressive Cal Poly team (1-3)
for much of the first half and taking
a 40-33 lead into the locker room,
Stanford sprinted out on a 15-6 run
to start the second period, stifling
the Mustang offense and scoring on
a series of lay-ups, put-backs and
free throws. It wasn't pretty but the
team showed that it can take control
of a game against a weaker oppo
nent when it chooses to, working the
ball inside and cutting to the hoop.
Stanford used its superior size
and strength to out-rebound the
Mustangs, 46-29. Junior forward
Matt Haryasz, who led the Cardinal
with 12 boards, said that it was nice
to get some help down low.
"We struggled with rebounding
last year, and it's something we've
stressed this season," Haryasz said.
"Guys are doing a good job of at
tacking the boards, especially the
guards, which helps a lot."
Cal Poly guard Dawin Whiten, a
sophomore, willed the Mustangs
back into the game in the second
half. With seven minutes to play, he
made two three-pointers and two
