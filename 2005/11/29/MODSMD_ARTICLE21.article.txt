# Men trounce Cal Poly
## Cardinal come alive in the second half to pull away with convincing win

We have better players, better depth and better talent...
but we haven't played to that level yet.
HEAD COACH TRENT JOHNSON

During the first half of last night's
game against Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo at Maples Pavilion, the Car
dinal looked like the team that lost
to UC-Irvine in its season opener.
They were tentative on offense, set
tling for contested jumpers, and
lackadaisical on defense, allowing
the smaller Mustangs to penetrate
for easy lay-ups and pound the ball
inside.
The team that came out in the
second half looked more like the
Cardinal (2-1) that many expected
to see this season, dictating the pace
and using their size and quickness to
pull away to win, 82-58.
"1 wish I knew," head coach Trent
Johnson said when asked what
caused Stanford's energetic second
half performance. "It was a good
turnaround, but it's what I want to
see at the start of the game. We have
a lot of veterans on this team, and to
start games like we started this one is
disappointing."
After trading baskets with a
more aggressive Cal Poly team (1-3)
for much of the first half and taking
a 40-33 lead into the locker room,
Stanford sprinted out on a 15-6 run
to start the second period, stifling
the Mustang offense and scoring on
a series of lay-ups, put-backs and
free throws. It wasn't pretty but the
team showed that it can take control
of a game against a weaker oppo
nent when it chooses to, working the
ball inside and cutting to the hoop.
Stanford used its superior size
and strength to out-rebound the
Mustangs, 46-29. Junior forward
Matt Haryasz, who led the Cardinal
with 12 boards, said that it was nice
to get some help down low.
"We struggled with rebounding
last year, and it's something we've
stressed this season," Haryasz said.
"Guys are doing a good job of at
tacking the boards, especially the
guards, which helps a lot."
Cal Poly guard Dawin Whiten, a
sophomore, willed the Mustangs
back into the game in the second
half. With seven minutes to play, he
made two three-pointers and two

for Stanford this year, paced the team in boards, hauling in 12 for the night.
free throws in a two-minute span,
cutting the deficit to 13. Whiten
drilled five of seven three-pointers
and finished with a game-high 22
points.
But Cal Poly could not pick up
the slack when a leg injury forced
Whiten to the bench a minute after
his scoring flurry. The Mustangs ap
peared disoriented on offense and
sloppy on defense without their
leading scorer, allowing the Cardinal
to go on a 14-0 run that iced the vic
tory.
The Cardinal shot poorly from
the floor, hitting only 41 percent of
their shots, but they made up for it by
drawing fouls and creating second
chance opportunities, a reflection of
their aggressiveness in the paint.
Stanford made 26 of its 33 free
throws and attacked the offensive
glass, pulling down 19 rebounds to
Cal Poly's seven.
Senior point guard Chris Her
nandez went to the basket more than
in his first two games, scoring 22
points and creating shots when Stan
lord could find none against the
Mustangs' zone defense. He also
dished out four assists.
Haryasz put an exclamation
point on the victory with an alley
oop from Hernandez with live min
utes to play, giving the Cardinal a 76-
51 lead. Haryasz was frustrated by
Cal Poly's double-team all night,
sometimes settling for off-balance
jumpers and making only six of his
15 shots, but he muscled his way to
the glass to finish with 16 points.
Stanford had trouble in the first
half working the ball inside to
Haryasz and its other big men
against the zone, a fact that wasn?t

helped by the squad's poor outside
shooting. The Cardinal made only
four of 14 from behind the arc, and
senior sharpshooter Dan Grunfeld
had an off-night, making just three
of his 12 shots and netting 11
points.
"The key against a zone is to not
get stagnant and just pass the ball
around," Haryasz said of what the
team seemed to do in the first half,
when it shot only 36 percent from
the field. "In the second half, guys
were moving and cutting more."
Sophomore forward Taj Finger
was the only player who appeared to
move much in the first half, scoring
nine points, many of them on sec
ond-chance opportunities. Five of
Finger's eight rebounds came on the
offensive glass.
But the Cardinal resurgence
started with defense. The Cardinal
held the Mustangs to 29 percent
from the field in the second half after
allowing them to shoot at 56 percent
in the first. Stanford forced C'al Poly
to settle for long shots — four of the
Mustangs' eight second-half field
goals came from behind the arc —
and got a hand in the shooter's face
on nearly every inside attempt.
"I told the team at halftime that
until you understand that you have
to be really nasty and aggressive on
defense, it's going to be a hard year,"
Johnson said.
But he was still shaking his head
over his squad's uninspired first half
in the postgame news conference.
"We have to play with a sense of
urgency," Johnson said. "Other
teams have come onto our home
floor and been the aggressor. When
you see Matt Haryasz lying on the
floor after being knocked down,
something's wrong. We have better
players, better depth and better tal
ent than the three teams we've
played, but we haven't played up to
that level."
