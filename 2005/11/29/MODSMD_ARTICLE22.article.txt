# Embarassing Yell Leaders have simply got to go
## 
### 
The past two weekends of Cardinal football
generated a slew of emotions and discussion
in the Stanford community. 'ITie one-sided
loss to Cal led naysayers to opine that the Card
couldn't be competitive in Division I-A football,
while the spirited play against Notre Dame sug
gested that maybe it wasn't time to give up on the
program just yet.
One thing, however, remains abundantly clear.
If Stanford wants to put on a respectable football
presentation each Saturday, the Yell Leaders have
got to go.
I could not believe what I saw when I first wit
nessed this ragtag outfit — dressed in no compre
hensible uniform, doing spontaneous dancing on
the track and shouting ridiculous chants at the stu
dent section through a set of speakers. At the time
the men were clad in auto-mechanic jumpsuits; the
women wore bondage outfits that were, 1 was told,
ordered from an erotic wear website.
Their website proudly states their renunciation
of any "traditional" aspects of cheer — no conic
megaphones, no legitimate uniforms, no lifts or
stunts.Their goal, as stated, is to look as disheveled
as possible and to act it too.They seem to think this
fits some kind of Stanford tradition of flaunting
the standards of propriety set by other schools.
Flaunting propriety is the Band's territory and
something it does in a cheeky and highly creative
manner. What these fake cheerleaders are really
attempting is to legitimize public stupidity. The
Yell Leaders should be disbanded on the grounds
that they are an embarrassment to the school, and
failing that, barred by the athletic department
from contests.
The first issue is the amplification. Yell leaders
at other schools use an acoustic megaphone to
lead the student section. If they don't need a
speaker system at Michigan Stadium (which regu
larly fills beyond its capacity of 107,501), we sure
as hell don't need one in our echo chamber.
The "big words" chants are mercilessly stupid.
Nothing makes me want to take a bathroom break
more than "make them relinquish the ball!" or "in
crease the aggregate yardage!" I heard one of
these chants once — at a Harvard game. Harvard!
By a (supposedly inebriated) student in the stands.
It was mildly funny. When it is initiated by kids
with microphones, it's not even close.
Another problem with speakers is that half the
stadium can hear them.Think about it — what are
attendees supposed to think when it looks like we
need a speaker system to get the student section to
chant? Probably the same thing they thought

The Turnaround
when they saw Buddy Teevens stalk
the sideline: that Stanford isn't seri
ous about football.
Well, I am and so are my friends,
but this tacky act doesn't convince
anyone else that they should be too.
Worse yet, the yell leaders create an
environment not conducive to suc
cess — encouraging the student sec
tion to make noise when Stanford
has the football. Last Saturday, they
excoriated the team to "block that
kick" as Notre Dame lined up fora
two-point conversion. Looks like
understanding the game is not their
strong point (something you would
think a cheerleading section might
need to know.)
The worst stroke came prior to
Big Game, when the Yell Leaders,
half-dressed in what appeared to be
Viking outfits, tore up a stuffed bear
and left a swath of cotton 10 yards
wide on the track in front of them.
Heaven forbid, the ABC cameras
caught a glimpse of the mess, broad
casting what looked like the remains
of a point-blank pigeon hunt to a
third of the country. Hopefully no
one saw it, because it would be an in
stant blow to the reputation of the
program and the University.
At least one can argue a cheer
leading purpose at football games.
The Yell Leaders add absolutely

nothing to the basketball experience.
Ihe Sixth Man section starts its own
chants.The only thing the jumpsuited
folk accomplish is obscuring the view
of the court for those Sixth Man stu
dents dedicated enough to stand in
line for hours to get onto the front
row riser.
It would be cynical of me to won
der if they were only in it for the on
the-floor access to hoops games, and
so 1 will not suggest such a thing.
If the Yell Leaders want to encour
age student support, get off the track
and onto the Axe Committee. If they
want to hop around and act crazy, they
can join the band. That is what the
Band does. At the very least, the
band's controversial antics are justi
fied by the fact that they play good
music that is pleasing to the ear.
The Band also features the classy
and highly choreographed Dollies, a
treat to watch. This is in addition to
Competitive Cheer, a group that ac
tually does what the Yell Leaders
should be doing.
Whoever has the appropriate au
thority, be it the athletic department
or the ASSU, should do the right
thing and send these louts back into
the stands where they belong. We
won't have a serious football atmos
phere until they do.

guest columnist Spencer Porter's rant
tomorrow.
The past two weekends of Cardinal football
generated a slew of emotions and discussion
in the Stanford community. 'ITie one-sided
loss to Cal led naysayers to opine that the Card
couldn't be competitive in Division I-A football,
while the spirited play against Notre Dame sug
gested that maybe it wasn't time to give up on the
program just yet.
One thing, however, remains abundantly clear.
If Stanford wants to put on a respectable football
presentation each Saturday, the Yell Leaders have
got to go.
I could not believe what I saw when I first wit
nessed this ragtag outfit — dressed in no compre
hensible uniform, doing spontaneous dancing on
the track and shouting ridiculous chants at the stu
dent section through a set of speakers. At the time
the men were clad in auto-mechanic jumpsuits; the
women wore bondage outfits that were, 1 was told,
ordered from an erotic wear website.
Their website proudly states their renunciation
of any "traditional" aspects of cheer — no conic
megaphones, no legitimate uniforms, no lifts or
stunts.Their goal, as stated, is to look as disheveled
as possible and to act it too.They seem to think this
fits some kind of Stanford tradition of flaunting
the standards of propriety set by other schools.
Flaunting propriety is the Band's territory and
something it does in a cheeky and highly creative
manner. What these fake cheerleaders are really
attempting is to legitimize public stupidity. The
Yell Leaders should be disbanded on the grounds
that they are an embarrassment to the school, and
failing that, barred by the athletic department
from contests.
The first issue is the amplification. Yell leaders
at other schools use an acoustic megaphone to
lead the student section. If they don't need a
speaker system at Michigan Stadium (which regu
larly fills beyond its capacity of 107,501), we sure
as hell don't need one in our echo chamber.
The "big words" chants are mercilessly stupid.
Nothing makes me want to take a bathroom break
more than "make them relinquish the ball!" or "in
crease the aggregate yardage!" I heard one of
these chants once — at a Harvard game. Harvard!
By a (supposedly inebriated) student in the stands.
It was mildly funny. When it is initiated by kids
with microphones, it's not even close.
Another problem with speakers is that half the
stadium can hear them.Think about it — what are
attendees supposed to think when it looks like we
need a speaker system to get the student section to
chant? Probably the same thing they thought

The Turnaround
when they saw Buddy Teevens stalk
the sideline: that Stanford isn't seri
ous about football.
Well, I am and so are my friends,
but this tacky act doesn't convince
anyone else that they should be too.
Worse yet, the yell leaders create an
environment not conducive to suc
cess — encouraging the student sec
tion to make noise when Stanford
has the football. Last Saturday, they
excoriated the team to "block that
kick" as Notre Dame lined up fora
two-point conversion. Looks like
understanding the game is not their
strong point (something you would
think a cheerleading section might
need to know.)
The worst stroke came prior to
Big Game, when the Yell Leaders,
half-dressed in what appeared to be
Viking outfits, tore up a stuffed bear
and left a swath of cotton 10 yards
wide on the track in front of them.
Heaven forbid, the ABC cameras
caught a glimpse of the mess, broad
casting what looked like the remains
of a point-blank pigeon hunt to a
third of the country. Hopefully no
one saw it, because it would be an in
stant blow to the reputation of the
program and the University.
At least one can argue a cheer
leading purpose at football games.
The Yell Leaders add absolutely

nothing to the basketball experience.
Ihe Sixth Man section starts its own
chants.The only thing the jumpsuited
folk accomplish is obscuring the view
of the court for those Sixth Man stu
dents dedicated enough to stand in
line for hours to get onto the front
row riser.
It would be cynical of me to won
der if they were only in it for the on
the-floor access to hoops games, and
so 1 will not suggest such a thing.
If the Yell Leaders want to encour
age student support, get off the track
and onto the Axe Committee. If they
want to hop around and act crazy, they
can join the band. That is what the
Band does. At the very least, the
band's controversial antics are justi
fied by the fact that they play good
music that is pleasing to the ear.
The Band also features the classy
and highly choreographed Dollies, a
treat to watch. This is in addition to
Competitive Cheer, a group that ac
tually does what the Yell Leaders
should be doing.
Whoever has the appropriate au
thority, be it the athletic department
or the ASSU, should do the right
thing and send these louts back into
the stands where they belong. We
won't have a serious football atmos
phere until they do.
