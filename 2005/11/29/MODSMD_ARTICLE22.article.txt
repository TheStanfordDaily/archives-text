# Embarassing Yell Leaders have simply got to go
## 
### 
The past two weekends of Cardinal football
generated a slew of emotions and discussion
in the Stanford community. 'ITie one-sided
loss to Cal led naysayers to opine that the Card
couldn't be competitive in Division I-A football,
while the spirited play against Notre Dame sug
gested that maybe it wasn't time to give up on the
program just yet.
One thing, however, remains abundantly clear.
If Stanford wants to put on a respectable football
presentation each Saturday, the Yell Leaders have
got to go.
I could not believe what I saw when I first wit
nessed this ragtag outfit — dressed in no compre
hensible uniform, doing spontaneous dancing on
the track and shouting ridiculous chants at the stu
dent section through a set of speakers. At the time
the men were clad in auto-mechanic jumpsuits; the
women wore bondage outfits that were, 1 was told,
ordered from an erotic wear website.
Their website proudly states their renunciation
of any "traditional" aspects of cheer — no conic
megaphones, no legitimate uniforms, no lifts or
stunts.Their goal, as stated, is to look as disheveled
as possible and to act it too.They seem to think this
fits some kind of Stanford tradition of flaunting
the standards of propriety set by other schools.
Flaunting propriety is the Band's territory and
something it does in a cheeky and highly creative
manner. What these fake cheerleaders are really
attempting is to legitimize public stupidity. The
Yell Leaders should be disbanded on the grounds
that they are an embarrassment to the school, and
failing that, barred by the athletic department
from contests.
The first issue is the amplification. Yell leaders
at other schools use an acoustic megaphone to
lead the student section. If they don't need a
speaker system at Michigan Stadium (which regu
larly fills beyond its capacity of 107,501), we sure
as hell don't need one in our echo chamber.
The "big words" chants are mercilessly stupid.
Nothing makes me want to take a bathroom break
more than "make them relinquish the ball!" or "in
crease the aggregate yardage!" I heard one of
these chants once — at a Harvard game. Harvard!
By a (supposedly inebriated) student in the stands.
It was mildly funny. When it is initiated by kids
with microphones, it's not even close.
Another problem with speakers is that half the
stadium can hear them.Think about it — what are
attendees supposed to think when it looks like we
need a speaker system to get the student section to
chant? Probably the same thing they thought
