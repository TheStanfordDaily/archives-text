### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
After an inspired comeback from a
seven-point halftime deficit. No. 15
Stanford women's basketball held a
narrow 64-62 lead in the waning sec
onds against No. 14 Texas Tech on Sun
day afternoon. All eyes were on the
Lady Raiders as they had two chances
to tie it at the line in the final three sec
onds. but they buckled under the pres
sure, missing three of four clutch free
throws, as Stanford eked out the 66-63
victory in Lubbock,Tex.
"Texas Tech had a lot of opportuni
ties down the stretch where they just
didn't convert," Cardinal junior center
Brooke Smith said. "We definitely got
lucky that they missed those free
throws at the end."
The Lady Raiders' (1-4,0-0 Big 12)
best chance came in their last posses
sion. After a time out, Texas Tech's
freshman guard LaVonda Henderson,
who lead her team with 16 points, re
ceived the ball and fired up a jumper.
The shot was off-target and on the re
bound, Smith — who led the Cardinal
(3-1, 0-0 Pacific-10) with 21 points —
was called fora foul underneath the
basket with 2.2 seconds remaining.
Texas Tech senior forward/center
LaToya Davis — who struggled at the
line shooting 1-7 on the day — missed
both of her shots, but senior guard Erin
Grant was fouled as she hauled in the
offensive board. Grant went 4-6 from
the charity stripe in the game but she
could not find the hoop when it count
ed. After missing her first shot, she at
tempted to miss her second shot off the
backboard, but the ball found its way
into the basket. Stanford then inbound
ed to sophomore guard Candice Wig

gins, who hit two free-throws bringing
her point total to 18 points and sealing a
crucial win.
"It was a really exciting win for us,"
Smith said. "Texas Tech is a good team.
We definitely didn't play our best bas
ketball, but I don't think they did either.
It was just good for us to play hard, be
tough and stick out a good game."
ITie Lady Raiders, who were coming
off two straight losses, played in aggres
sive style in front of l(),()(M) fans and
were able to jump out to a 33-26 first
half lead.The Cardinal responded after
halftime, going on a 9-0 run. capped off
by a Wiggins lay-up. Stanford took the
43-41 lead with 13:30 minutes left — the
Cardinal's first lead since being up 2-0
in the opening minutes.
Sophomore Kristin Newlin. who had
an impressive 17 rebounds, also solidi
fied the Cardinal defense and prevent
ed the second chance opportunities that
can kill rallies.
"I thought our team made good ad
justments at half-time," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We re
bounded much better in the second
half. We ran and got transition baskets
especially in the second half. I thought
(junior guard] Clare Bodensteiner was
a real key for the win, both offensively
and defensively."
Stanford was busy throughout the
Thanksgiving break as it opened the
season on Nov. 19 against Long Island
(1-3, 0-0 NEC) in Minnesota. The
Blackbirds could not get any offensive
production, shooting only 17.5 percent
from the field en route to a 69-28 drub
bing. With the game in hand early on,
the Cardinal were able to experiment
with many different combinations and
every player got at least six minutes on
the floor.
The following day.the Cardinal
faced their first legitimate test of the
season against tournament host No. 12
Minnesota (4-0,0-0 Big 10).The Golden
Gophers continually got to the free
throw line, going 30-45 while the Cardi

nal only went 11-17. Minnesota also ef
fectively spread the ball around, as four
of five starters and two bench players
scored in double figures. The Cardinal
kept it close, cutting the Gopher lead to
72-70 on a Wiggins three-pointer with
2:40 left. But Minnesota pulled away to
an 84-77 victory with a game ending a
12-7 run, including six straight points
following Wiggins' shot.
"Minnesota was a very good learn
ing experience for us," Newlin said. "It
was the second game of the season and
we played a lot better than we did the
day before even though we won the
game against Long Island. We came out
with a lot of good things to work on in
the next couple games."
Stanford's home opener was on Nov.
23 against an extremely athletic Fresno
State squad (2-2,0-0 W AC). The Cardi
nal, who have not lost in Maples in 23
straight games, rolled easily to a 89-67
vic\tory. Senior guard Krista Rappa
hahn shot a lights out 4 for 4 from be
hind the arc en route to a career-high 18
points.
"Fresno State was a very different
team, which helps because it forces you
to take a different approach," Newlin
said. "They were very athletic and very
guard oriented and in response we had
to do a lot of things defensively that will
help us in future games."
Stanford, who was stranded in the El
Paso airport for much of yesterday, will
continue practice tomorrow. Their sea
son continues Thursday in Stockton
against Pacific (1-3) and before top
ranked Tennessee (5-0) and highly
touted redshirt freshman Candace
Parker come to Maples on Dec. 4.
"Our team is a fun group to be with,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm really excited
about our team's improvement. We've
got a long way to go, but I like the direc
tion we're going in and that so many
people are contributing. This win will
give us great momentum and confi
dence going into this week against Ten
nessee."
