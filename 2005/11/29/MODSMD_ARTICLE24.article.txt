# Stanford secures NCAA tourney bid
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
Three weeks ago, the members of the Stan
ford men's water polo squad returned home a
beaten team. Not only were they battling the
physical fatigue of taking on four of the na
tion's top six teams within a nine-day span, but
they were also reeling from a pair of stinging
defeats at the hands of top-ranked Southern
California and then-No. 6 UC-Irvine.
With only two games remaining on their
regular season schedule, the Cardinal (17-5,6-
2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) faced
the daunting challenge of regaining their mo
mentum in time for the MPSF postseason con
ference tournament. And with their Big Splash
showdown against then-No. 2 California on
Nov. 19, the Cardinal knew they would need
every bit of momentum they could muster.

In the face of adversity, Stanford re
sponded. The Cardinal produced an author
itative 7-4 victory over the Bears in front of a
sellout Avery Aquatic Center crowd. In ad
dition to bringing the rivalry's bragging
rights back to the Farm, the victory sent
Stanford into this past weekend's MPSF
tournament in Malibu, Calif., on a roll.
The Cardinal continued their streak of re
cent dominance by posting a 9-7 win over
sixth-seeded Pepperdine and a resounding
11-5 victory over second-seeded Irvine to
reach the tournament title game, where they
lost 8-5 to top-seed USC. But with their sec
ond-place finish, the Cardinal secured a bid
to next weekend's NCAA Championships at
Bucknell, where the squad will pursue its
first NCAA title since 2001.
But were it not for their strong perform
ance against Cal in their regular season fi

nale, the Stanford men might not be packing
their bags for their trip to the NCAA tourna
ment in Lewiston, Penn.
"It all started last weekend at the Big
Splash." sophomore two-meter defender
Peter Finlayson said, in reference to the Car
dinal's success in the conference tourna
ment. "By beating [the Bears] then, we got a
good seed for MPSFs and got the edge over
Cal in the hunt for the at-large bid to the
NCAA tournament."
From the frist whistle, Stanford looked
sharp in every aspect. Junior driver Tyler
Drake gave the Cardinal an early 1-0 lead,
and the Stanford defense held the Cal of
fense scoreless for the first period of play.
After the Bears tied it up 1:46 into the sec
ond period, sophomore two-meter Michael
Bury buried a skip-shot at 4:42 to put the
Cardinal back ahead. Stanford bench play

ers Marcello Pantuliano and Ryan Fortune
tallied clutch shots to build the lead to three
as time expired in the first half.
The Stanford defense, anchored by soph
omore goalie Sandy Hohener's 13 saves,
kept the Bears at arms-length, as the Cardi
nal emerged victorious by a 7-4 margin.
In the first round of the MPSF tourna
ment. the Cardinal drew a tough Fepperdine
squad. After falling behind 2-1, Stanford ral
lied and went on an 8-3 scoring run in the
second and third periods to take control of
the game heading into the final period of
play. The Waves netted two unanswered
goals in the fourth, but it wasn't enough as
the Cardinal hung on to win 4-7 and ad
vanced to the semifinals.
Against Irvine in the semifinals, Stanford
had the opportunity to even the score after
their disappointing loss to the Anteaters
during the regular season. It was a rematch
that every member of the Stanford squad ea
gerly looked forward to, and the squad took
full advantage of the opportunity.
"As a team, we felt embarrassed by our
first meeting with Irvine," Hohener said.
"We were really excited to have the chance
to avenge our poor performance [earlier
this season] by beating them at MPSFs to
end their season and clinch a spot at
NCAAs. On Saturday, we actually executed
the game plan we came up with when we
played them a couple of weeks ago. Conse
quently, we controlled the entire game and
dominated."
There wasn't a more appropriate word for
the Cardinal's effort; Stanford netted five goals
before the Anteaters even got on the board,
and the defense maintained its stellar level of
play, limiting Irvine to a single first half score.
"The Irvine and Pepperdine games
showed some of our best team
play all season," freshman two-meter Will
Hindle-Katel said. "We knew that either of
those games could've been our last meaning
ful game, and our team did a great job of
coming together to put forth our best effort
when it mattered most."
Despite receiving four goals from senior
captain Thomas Hopkins, the Cardinal were
unable to claim the conference title on Sun
day. But the NCAA bid brought the team
back to the Farm satisfied and primed for its
next challenge.
"We came into the tournament trying to
qualify for NCAAs, and that's exactly what
we did," said senior captain Peter Varellas,
who notched 10 goals on the weekend. "The
finals against USC didn't go exactly how we
would have liked, but we know that the im
portant games now are next weekend."

in the finals of the MPSF championship game. For the tournament, the team's co-captain tallied six goals for the Card.
