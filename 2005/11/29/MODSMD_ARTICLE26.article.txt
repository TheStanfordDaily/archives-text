## Calif. congressman resigns 
### ELLIOT SPAGAT ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
SAN DIEGO (AP) —Rep. Randy
"Duke" Cunningham, an eight-term con
gressman and hotshot Vietnam War fighter
jock, pleaded guilty to graft and tearfully re
signed Monday, admitting he took $2.4 mil
lion in bribes mostly from defense contractors
in exchange for government business and
other favors.
"The truth is I broke the law. concealed
my conduct, and disgraced my office," the
63-year-old Republican said at a news con
ference. "I know that I will forfeit my free
dom, my reputation, my worldly possessions,
most importantly, the trust of my friends and
family."

He could get up to 10years in prison at sen
tencing Feb. 27 on federal charges of conspir
acy to commit bribery and fraud, and tax eva
sion.
Investigators said Cunningham, a member
of a House Appropriations subcommittee
that controls defense dollars, secured con
tracts worth tens of millions of dollars for
those who paid him off. Prosecutors did not
identify the defense contractors by name.
Cunningham was charged in a case that grew
out of an investigation into the sale of his home
to a defense contractor at an inflated price.
The congressman had already announced
in July — after the investigation became pub
lic — that he would not seek re-election next
year. But until he entered his plea, he had in
sisted he had done nothing wrong.
