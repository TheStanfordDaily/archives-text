### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Prof. Emeritus of Economics and Opera
tions Research Kenneth J. Arrow was one of
eight scientists to receive the 2(H)4 National
Medal of Science. The medal is the nation's
most prized scientific honor.
The awards were announced by President
George W. Bush at the White I louse on Nov. 13.
In a statement. White House representatives
noted Arrow's massive contributions to the the
ory of pure economics but focused more partic
ularly on the ways in which his work has been
applied practically.
"His fundamental research on risk percep
tion and behavior under uncertainty, and on
equilibrium in markets with imperfect informa
tion, began a revolution in the design and analy
sis of market allocation mechanisms." said a
White House statement.
Arrow's work has changed thinking in stock
markets as well as in health care, insurance and
other big business industries.
His writing on health care, in which he ex
amined the disjointed relationship between
those who provide the insurance and those who
determine the patients' needs, led to the usage
of health maintenance organizations (HMOs).
By having one organization serve as both
health care and insurance provider. HMOs at
tempt to surmount the problems of insurance
overuse.

I le closely studied risk bearing, looking at
how failures in one industry may lead to in
creased liabilities in another,as in the case of the
power and aluminum refining industries.
"I take this award as an approval of econom
ics and of operations research as scientific en
deavors," Arrow said.
In an interview with the Stanford News Ser
vice, Arrow drew attention to the fact that,
since the award's conception, social scientists
have been recognized less than half of the
years. Economics being merely a subset of the
social sciences, his receipt of the award brings
attention and honor to the sometimes under
recognized subject.
Arrow's career, however, has never been
without distinction. After earning a doctorate
from Columbia University, he went on to re
ceive approximately 20 honorary degrees. His
dissertation, published as "Social Choice and
Individual Values," has become a classic. In
1972. he was awarded the Nobel Prize in eco
nomics with John R. Hicks for work on general
economic equilibrium theory' and welfare the
ory. He is a member of the National Academy
of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine.
Arrow's receipt of the medal brings the
number of awarded Stanford scholars, includ
ing the I loovcr institution, to 32.
"Obviously, one cannot help being pleased
at the recognition of one's own work." Arrow
said in an interview with The Daily
"Ideally, I like to think that I am my
most severe critic and that my inner
approval or disapproval — or that of
a few colleagues that 1 respect — is
more important than any evaluation
by a formal institution. But 1 must ac
cept that any recognition is pleasing."
The National Medal of Science
was established in 1959 by the 86th
congress of the National Science
Foundation (NSF). According to the
NSF Web site, it is a presidential
award, intended for those who are
"deserving of special recognition by
reason of their outstanding contribu
tions to knowledge in the physical, bi
ological, mathematical, or engineer
ing sciences."
