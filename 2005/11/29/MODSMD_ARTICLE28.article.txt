## New hormone can suppress appetite 
### ADA YEE 
A college student's concern with weight,
diet and exercise may seem like nothing out
of the ordinary; however. Americans every
where have become increasingly alarmed
about the rise of national obesity rates.
Obesity has been linked to diverse causes
from psychological disorders to heart dis
ease to children who play too many video
games.
Obesity has also been notably linked to
genetics. On Nov. 11, a group of Stanford
Medical school researchers published their
discovery of a new hormone, dubbed
obestatin, which suppresses appetite, in Sci
ence Magazine. The lead author of the
paper was Jian V. Zhang, a postdoctoral fel
low in the laboratory of Obstetrics.and Gy
necology Prof. Aaron Hsueh. Hsueh and
Zhang's research was sponsored by John
son & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &
Development LLC.
Many reports have suggested that
obestatin might lead to developing a
'weight-control' drug that would help the
obese. One BBC report cited Prof. Steve
Bloom, from the Imperial College in Lon
don, who predicted that "we should be able
to control appetite within five to 10 years."
Whether or not a hunger-control pill is a
viable thing of the future, or whether
obestatin would provide the key to such a
drug is unclear. TTie hormone leptin, which
was discovered over 10 years ago, is also
known to suppress appetite, but promise of

a weight-control drug based on this mecha
nism is not yet in sight.
What is clear, however, is that research
methods informed by new knowledge of
the human genome helped Zhang, Hsueh
and other scientists to discover the new hor
mone.
Hsueh's team found obestatin is part of
an initial search fora certain type of hor
mone called peptide hormones, or biologi
cal messengers that happen to be made of
small protein molecules. Peptide hormones
bond to a specific type of receptor called a
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).
According to a news release by the Stan
ford News Service, Hsueh said that over
half the drugs on the market target GPCRs,
making them an area worthy of research.
Peptide hormones are small and conse
quently easy to manufacture and deliver.
The researchers used bioinformatics to
select a specific peptide hormone to study.
The logic used by scientists was — genes
shared by many different species have been
preserved by evolution and are therefore
biologically important.
Hseuh's team ended up picking the pepi
de hormone ghrelin, which was discovered
in 1999 and is known to increase appetite.
Ghrelin had long puzzled scientists, who
could not figure out why deletion of the
ghrelin gene in rats did nothing to change
their appetites.
Examination of the ghrelin gene showed
1 Isueh, Zhang and their colleagues that it in
fact codes fora second peptide hormone —

the hormone they named obestatin.
"Obestatin appears to act as an anorexic
hormone," said the Nov. 11 'Science' article,
"by decreasing food intake, gastric empty
ing activities, jejunal motility and body
weight gain."
These observations led to the christen
ing of the newly discovered hormone.
"On the basis of the bioinformatics
prediction that another peptide also de
rived from proghrelin exists, we isolated a
hormone from rath stomach and named it
obestatin — a contraction of obese, from
the Latin 'obedere,' meaning to devour,
and'statin,' denoting suppression," Hsueh
said.
The realization that ghrelin and
obestatin come from the same gene is sig
nificant towards solving the conundrum
which had puzzled scientists, as to why ghre
lin-gene deletion did nothing to change ap
petite — the two hormones had balancing
functions, but doing away with one hor
mone meant doing away with the other.
In the 'Science' article, Hsueh and Shang
stated that "a better understanding of roles
of ghrelin and obestatin in the intricate bal
ance of energy and body-weight control
may be essential for the successful treat
ment of obesity."
1 lowever, the implications for research
may be bigger.
According to the article, "the discovery
of obestatine underscores the power of
comparative genomic analyses in the
postgenoniic era."
