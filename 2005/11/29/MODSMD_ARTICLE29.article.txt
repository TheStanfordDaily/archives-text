## Students evaluate new phone bill policy Joint telecommunications fee launched this quarter 
### MELISSA FUSCO STAFF WRITER 
This is the first quarter that Informa
tion Technology Systems and Services
(ITSS) has implemented its new policy of
assessing a joint telecommunications fee,
which combines charges for both student
network services and landline phones in a
single required charge on students' quar
terly bills.
The goal of the telecommunications
fee is to streamline the payment process
and reduce overhead costs. Despite some
lingering student dissatisfaction with the
mandatory charges, Richard Holeton,
head of Residential Computing, said the
implementation of the new system has
been a success.
"The new policy makes a big differ
ence in how many students pay their fees
late," Holeton said.
Now that the telecommunications
charge has been combined with student
fees, penalties for not paying the fees are
equivalent to those for lapsed tuition,
housing and board payments. These can
include a hold on transcripts and suspen
sion from registering for classes until
outstanding payments and late fees have
been cleared.
Holeton reiterated ResComp's offi
cial stance on the combined network and
phone charges, noting that the student

body was consul

before the policy
changes were
made.

The proposal
for the telecom
munications fin

fee, designed by ITSS staffers, was
presented to the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate last spring. It was approved by
both the Senate and University Provost
John Etchemendy for the 2005*2006
school year.
Complaints about the new combined
fee continue to be heard, however. The
majority of dissent is centered not
around the combination of network
services with quarterly bills, but rather
focuses on the addition of the landline
into the fee. Students have lamented the
hassle and redundancy of in-room tele
phones and the annoyance of receiving
calls from telemarketers.
"I already pay $50 a month for my cell
phone bill," said sophomore Nicole
Wires. "I don't want to be forced to pay
an additional monthly fee fora room
phone that I have never used, don't plan
to use and don't even know the number
for."
"Last year I got a cell phone precise
ly because it was cheaper than the Uni
versity phone plan," added co-terminal
student Tim Telleen-Lawton. "Now my
five roommates and I arc paying the
same as anyone who lives in a single for
one phone that doesn't get any use ex
cept for re-mortgaging solicitation
calls."

In response

Holeton noted that

the allocation of the
quarterly $48 per-stu
dent charge is approxi
mately $5 for landline
telephones and $43 for

network access. While a
large number of students rely solely on
cellular phones to make calls, roughly 9K
percent of students living in on-campus
residences last year reported having net
work subscriptions.
The University's justification for
mandatory landlines is to assure student
safety. Emergency calls from landline
phones can be pinpointed by police and
rescue services, which is not true of calls
made from cell phones. Landline phones
in residences also interface with the
Door King Security system, which allows
students to unlock doors for visitors from
their rooms.
Last year, ITSS also became more ag
gressive in its collection policies for serv
ices that are not included in the telecom
munications fee. such as long-distance
calling plans and cable television sub
scriptions. In particular. ITSS began em
ploying collection agencies to go after
students who were repeatedly lax in
making their payments.
However, Holeton stressed that the
harsher policies are only for these special
services and do not affect the majority of
students who pay only the telecommuni
cations fee with their quarterly tuition.
"They are totally different things." he
said.

an additional monthly fee fora room
phone that I have never used, don't plan
to use and don't even know the number
for."
"Last year I got a cell phone precise
ly because it was cheaper than the Uni
versity phone plan," added co-terminal
student Tim Telleen-Lawton. "Now my
five roommates and I arc paying the
same as anyone who lives in a single for
one phone that doesn't get any use ex
cept for re-mortgaging solicitation
calls."

In response

Holeton noted that

the allocation of the
quarterly $48 per-stu
dent charge is approxi
mately $5 for landline
telephones and $43 for

network access. While a
large number of students rely solely on
cellular phones to make calls, roughly 9K
percent of students living in on-campus
residences last year reported having net
work subscriptions.
The University's justification for
mandatory landlines is to assure student
safety. Emergency calls from landline
phones can be pinpointed by police and
rescue services, which is not true of calls
made from cell phones. Landline phones
in residences also interface with the
Door King Security system, which allows
students to unlock doors for visitors from
their rooms.
Last year, ITSS also became more ag
gressive in its collection policies for serv
ices that are not included in the telecom
munications fee. such as long-distance
calling plans and cable television sub
scriptions. In particular. ITSS began em
ploying collection agencies to go after
students who were repeatedly lax in
making their payments.
However, Holeton stressed that the
harsher policies are only for these special
services and do not affect the majority of
students who pay only the telecommuni
cations fee with their quarterly tuition.
"They are totally different things." he
said.
