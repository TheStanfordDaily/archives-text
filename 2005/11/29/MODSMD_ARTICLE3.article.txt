## OSP keeps attracting students Number of applicants for spring equal to 2005 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program
has historically attracted a large number
of Stanford students, a pattern that has
continued this year.The overall number
of applicants for spring 2006 is on par
with the numbers from last year. A total
of 222 students applied to program cen
ters in Beijing, Berlin, Florence, Oxford,
Paris and Santiago, up from 215 last
spring.
"The most notable difference be
tween this spring and last year is that the
students are distributed more evenly
across the centers," said Shannon Mari
mon, outreach and student relations
manager at the BOSP. "We used to re
ceive far more applications for Oxford
than we could possibly accommodate,
and I think that figure has gone down a
bit this year."
The total number of applicants to the
Oxford center fell from 86 to 75. In con
trast, the number of applications for
Beijing rose from 12 to 26.
"Beijing was in its pilot stage last
year, so naturally the number of stu
dents who applied was not as high as
some of the other centers," Marimon
said. "But since more and more students
have heard about it, the numbers have
more than doubled.The other issue with
Beijing was the language requirement.
We used to require a year and two quar
ters of Mandarin, which was quite stiff.
Now we only require two quarters,
which more students are willing to do."
"I decided to apply to Beijing be
cause it was the farthest I could get from
home," said Cata Vejo, a junior majoring
in art history and Chinese. "Also, 1
have never been to Asia, and 1
thought it would be exciting to live
there fora while."
Some centers saw a spike in inter
est. Berlin, which is hosting the soc
cer World Cup in 2006, had 30 appli
cants. as opposed to 19 last year. San
tiago also saw a rise in applicants,
from 25 to 35. Paris — always a pop
ular center — had 52 applicants this
spring, up from 47 last year.
"Berlin seems very historically
relevant in a way that most old Euro
pean cities are not," said junior Sam
Tanzer, who will be in Berlin in the
spring. "It isn't someplace you go to
appreciate as a piece of art because
it's not static.The city is still in flux."

Other programs saw a relatively
constant number of students. Flo
rence stayed almost the same, with
25 applicants this year compared
with 23 last year.
"I wanted to go to Europe be
cause 1 live in Hawaii and I've never
really been out of the country," said
junior Jess Hara. "But 1 had a friend
in high school who spoke fluent
French, and she said 1 sounded like a
dying seal when I tried to speak it. So
I decided to apply to Florence in
stead. 1 hear the people there are
friendly and won't judge you on your
accent. Oh. and I've never tried to
speak French again."
The Kyoto program concluded its
application process for spring 2006
one quarter earlier than the other
programs. Forty-five students were
accepted for the upcoming spring
quarter.The number of students who
are actually going abroad has not
been finalized. However. Marimon

said she urges students to consider
their offers seriously and notes that
the BOSP does everything it can to
accommodate the maximum num
ber of students.
"Obviously, we don't like turning
students away from the more popu
lar programs, but we do have limita
tions in terms of staff, facilities and
budget," she said. "But all students
should know that we charge exactly
the same tuition that you would pay
if you were staying on campus. We
even take minute details like laundry
into account when we redistribute
funds. So there is very little cost dif
ference."
Marimon added that applications
for some of the centers are still being
accepted on a petition basis.
" ITie Overseas Studies Program
is really an extension of the Stanford
experience, and we do want every
one to be able to go regardless of fi
nancial situation," she said.
