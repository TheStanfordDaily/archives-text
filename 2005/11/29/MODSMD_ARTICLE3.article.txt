## OSP keeps attracting students Number of applicants for spring equal to 2005 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program
has historically attracted a large number
of Stanford students, a pattern that has
continued this year.The overall number
of applicants for spring 2006 is on par
with the numbers from last year. A total
of 222 students applied to program cen
ters in Beijing, Berlin, Florence, Oxford,
Paris and Santiago, up from 215 last
spring.
"The most notable difference be
tween this spring and last year is that the
students are distributed more evenly
across the centers," said Shannon Mari
mon, outreach and student relations
manager at the BOSP. "We used to re
ceive far more applications for Oxford
than we could possibly accommodate,
and I think that figure has gone down a
bit this year."
The total number of applicants to the
Oxford center fell from 86 to 75. In con
trast, the number of applications for
Beijing rose from 12 to 26.
"Beijing was in its pilot stage last
year, so naturally the number of stu
dents who applied was not as high as
some of the other centers," Marimon
said. "But since more and more students
have heard about it, the numbers have
more than doubled.The other issue with
Beijing was the language requirement.
We used to require a year and two quar
ters of Mandarin, which was quite stiff.
Now we only require two quarters,
which more students are willing to do."
"I decided to apply to Beijing be
cause it was the farthest I could get from
home," said Cata Vejo, a junior majoring
