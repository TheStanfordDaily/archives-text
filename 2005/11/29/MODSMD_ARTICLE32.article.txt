## Student takes Jeopardy! prize Junior takes home $100,000 grand prize on game show 
### KAT LEWIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Pizarro founded this city whose present name is
from a Quechua word meaning'talker'" The correct
answer is Lima — just ask junior Nico Martinez.
This is one of the many questions he answered to
win first place in Jeopardyl's 2005 College Champi
onship.
In the two-episode final round of this competition,
which aired Nov. 17 and 18. Martinez heat out his clos
est competitor by $12,101 in order to win the champi
onship and the $100,000 grand prize.
"After the first day of the finals, I knew he had it in
the bag, but even then he wouldn't tell me the results,"
said junior Ari Neumann, Martinez' roommate. "I
guess I always thought he would win. but it was still a
surprise to actually see it."
Martinez said he also experienced initial shock
after his victory. The three players' scores during the
two-day final round were cumulative, and Martinez
went into Final Jeopardy with a hefty lead.
"Right before Final Jeopardy of the second game,
I kind of figured out that unless I did something in
credibly stupid, I was going to win," Martinez said.
"Once that was over and I won the whole thing, I re
member looking up and feeling like,'l can't believe
this just happened!'. I've been talking about this with
friends for years and years."
Martinez has competed on Stanford's Quiz Bowl
team since his freshman year and participated in the
national tournament in April. According to Quiz
Bowl captain Eric Smith, a fourth-year computer sci
ence graduate student, Martinez' love for trivia makes
him a valuable player.
"He never played quiz bowl in high school," Smith
said. "Nico is sort of fresh — he could still compete
with the best players at Stanford even though he had
n't competed before. He just knows a lot. He'll show
up with a book of random facts and say, 'This is so
cool!'"
Martinez said he has been a fan of Jeopardy! long
before competing on the show.
"I remember when I was younger, nine or 10 years
old, when I went out to dinner with my family, when
ever we went to restaurants that had paper placemats
I'd turn them over and draw the Jeopardy! board," he
recalled. "I'd write out the categories and make my

family play. I was Alex."
In the weeks preceding the taping, Martinez spent
time practicing in more conventional ways. Martinez
said he enlisted the help of his girlfriend, senior Becky
Garza, and his sister in getting him up to speed with
popular culture.
"Before he went on the show, he was studying and
memorizing all kinds of trivia books," Neumann said.
"He also practiced a lot. We sat in front of the TV and
played along with buzzers and everything. We also
played a computer version of the game, but he always
won."
According to Martinez, there is more to successful
ly competing on Jeopardy! than just knowing the an
swers.
"What's amazing is that everyone there was so
smart," he said. "The most important thing was the
buzzer. You can't buzz in until Alex is done reading
the question, then these little lights flash. The trick is
to read the question through and wait until Alex is
done reading the question, then stare at the little lights
and buzz like crazy."
This strategy might come in handy when Martinez
competes in the next Jeopardy! Tournament of Cham
pions, which will be filmed sometime next year. In the
meantime, Martinez said he is thinking about how to
spend his prize money.
"I think I'm going to use some of it to pay for
school next year, and I'd really like to take a trip down
to South America," Martinez said. "I also think I'm
going to find a way to donate some money to my high
school for something specific — something like his
tory books or maybe basketball uniforms."
Martinez graduated from The Roeper School in
Bloomfield Hills and Birmingham, Michigan. He said
the school has been very supportive of his Jeopardy!
success.
"After I won I started getting messages from peo
ple who are still involved in the school and they want
ed me to go back." Martinez said. "My school is
kindergarten through twelfth grade, and they planned
a whole day for me to go back to the school.They said
that a lot of younger kids were incorporating Jeop
ardy! into their curriculum. It's neat that my high
school and Stanford get some pretty good representa
tion out of this."
Garza agreed that Martinez' Jeopardy! appear
ance made a positive impression.
"Overall, I think he did an amazing job represent
ing Stanford, and Nico showed his true personality on
the show," Garza said. "I thought it was really funny
that he looked surprised after every answer he got
right. I am really proud of him. and he truly deserves
all of his success."

Martinez said he has been a fan of Jeopardy! long
before competing on the show.
"I remember when I was younger, nine or 10 years
old, when I went out to dinner with my family, when
ever we went to restaurants that had paper placemats
I'd turn them over and draw the Jeopardy! board," he
recalled. "I'd write out the categories and make my

family play. I was Alex."
In the weeks preceding the taping, Martinez spent
time practicing in more conventional ways. Martinez
said he enlisted the help of his girlfriend, senior Becky
Garza, and his sister in getting him up to speed with
popular culture.
"Before he went on the show, he was studying and
memorizing all kinds of trivia books," Neumann said.
"He also practiced a lot. We sat in front of the TV and
played along with buzzers and everything. We also
played a computer version of the game, but he always
won."
According to Martinez, there is more to successful
ly competing on Jeopardy! than just knowing the an
swers.
"What's amazing is that everyone there was so
smart," he said. "The most important thing was the
buzzer. You can't buzz in until Alex is done reading
the question, then these little lights flash. The trick is
to read the question through and wait until Alex is
done reading the question, then stare at the little lights
and buzz like crazy."
This strategy might come in handy when Martinez
competes in the next Jeopardy! Tournament of Cham
pions, which will be filmed sometime next year. In the
meantime, Martinez said he is thinking about how to
spend his prize money.
"I think I'm going to use some of it to pay for
school next year, and I'd really like to take a trip down
to South America," Martinez said. "I also think I'm
going to find a way to donate some money to my high
school for something specific — something like his
tory books or maybe basketball uniforms."
Martinez graduated from The Roeper School in
Bloomfield Hills and Birmingham, Michigan. He said
the school has been very supportive of his Jeopardy!
success.
"After I won I started getting messages from peo
ple who are still involved in the school and they want
ed me to go back." Martinez said. "My school is
kindergarten through twelfth grade, and they planned
a whole day for me to go back to the school.They said
that a lot of younger kids were incorporating Jeop
ardy! into their curriculum. It's neat that my high
school and Stanford get some pretty good representa
tion out of this."
Garza agreed that Martinez' Jeopardy! appear
ance made a positive impression.
"Overall, I think he did an amazing job represent
ing Stanford, and Nico showed his true personality on
the show," Garza said. "I thought it was really funny
that he looked surprised after every answer he got
right. I am really proud of him. and he truly deserves
all of his success."

Junior Nico Martinez displays his first-place trophy on the game show Jeopardy! He won the $100,000 prize
on the show's annual College Championship.
"Pizarro founded this city whose present name is
from a Quechua word meaning'talker'" The correct
answer is Lima — just ask junior Nico Martinez.
This is one of the many questions he answered to
win first place in Jeopardyl's 2005 College Champi
onship.
In the two-episode final round of this competition,
which aired Nov. 17 and 18. Martinez heat out his clos
est competitor by $12,101 in order to win the champi
onship and the $100,000 grand prize.
"After the first day of the finals, I knew he had it in
the bag, but even then he wouldn't tell me the results,"
said junior Ari Neumann, Martinez' roommate. "I
guess I always thought he would win. but it was still a
surprise to actually see it."
Martinez said he also experienced initial shock
after his victory. The three players' scores during the
two-day final round were cumulative, and Martinez
went into Final Jeopardy with a hefty lead.
"Right before Final Jeopardy of the second game,
I kind of figured out that unless I did something in
credibly stupid, I was going to win," Martinez said.
"Once that was over and I won the whole thing, I re
member looking up and feeling like,'l can't believe
this just happened!'. I've been talking about this with
friends for years and years."
Martinez has competed on Stanford's Quiz Bowl
team since his freshman year and participated in the
national tournament in April. According to Quiz
Bowl captain Eric Smith, a fourth-year computer sci
ence graduate student, Martinez' love for trivia makes
him a valuable player.
"He never played quiz bowl in high school," Smith
said. "Nico is sort of fresh — he could still compete
with the best players at Stanford even though he had
n't competed before. He just knows a lot. He'll show
up with a book of random facts and say, 'This is so
cool!'"
