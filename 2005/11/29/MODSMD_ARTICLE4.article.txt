Tacked to the wall of senior Sanjay
Kairam's room in Durand House is a black
shirt proclaiming, "I directed the National
Champion South Asian A Cappella group,
and all I got was this lousy t-shirt." On Nov. 5,
under Kairam's direction, Raagapella —

Stanford's only South Asian a cappella group
— won Anahat, the second national South
Asian A Cappella Championship.
Raagapella was founded in 2(X)2 by Bobby
Ghosh, Class of 2(X)5, senior Jay Pandit,senior
Sudeep Roy and co-terminal student Mehul
Trivedi for just one performance. It rapidly
became something far bigger in scope.
The group presents a fusion of Western
and South Asian music. At the competition
earlier this month, it performed three songs
— "Vande Mataram," a patriotic salute to
motherhood, "Meri Jaan," a fusion hip-hop

piece and a mix of the Hindi song"Chak De"
and the Maroon Five pop hit "This Love."
Those three songs buoyed the group to vic
tory over its five competitors. Despite its
small size, the contest has become much more
competitive over the last few years as South
Asian a cappella experienced a boom.
"It's great to see how these groups have
developed across the country in the past few
years and spread awareness of and apprecia
tion for South Asian culture," said Sunil
