## Raagapella wins national a cappella title South Asian a cappella group to release first album 
### ANDREW BURMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tacked to the wall of senior Sanjay
Kairam's room in Durand House is a black
shirt proclaiming, "I directed the National
Champion South Asian A Cappella group,
and all I got was this lousy t-shirt." On Nov. 5,
under Kairam's direction, Raagapella —

Stanford's only South Asian a cappella group
— won Anahat, the second national South
Asian A Cappella Championship.
Raagapella was founded in 2(X)2 by Bobby
Ghosh, Class of 2(X)5, senior Jay Pandit,senior
Sudeep Roy and co-terminal student Mehul
Trivedi for just one performance. It rapidly
became something far bigger in scope.
The group presents a fusion of Western
and South Asian music. At the competition
earlier this month, it performed three songs
— "Vande Mataram," a patriotic salute to
motherhood, "Meri Jaan," a fusion hip-hop

piece and a mix of the Hindi song"Chak De"
and the Maroon Five pop hit "This Love."
Those three songs buoyed the group to vic
tory over its five competitors. Despite its
small size, the contest has become much more
competitive over the last few years as South
Asian a cappella experienced a boom.
"It's great to see how these groups have
developed across the country in the past few
years and spread awareness of and apprecia
tion for South Asian culture," said Sunil
Group
comes in first

Parekh, a sophomore.
Winning isn't too bad either.
"We've been saying national cham
pions in a semi-ironic way," Kairam
said. But the Raagapella men did take
top honors. One of their high points was
beating two teams they had lost to last
year. Their enthusiasm was shared by
the audience, which filled UC-Berke
ley's Julian Morgan Center.
"It's been really rewarding for us to
watch this sort of pet project become
something so much larger." said Trivedi,
the longest-standing member of the cur
rent group, which consists of mostly new
students and — for the first time —
non-South Asian singers.
For Raagapella members, the win at
Berkeley does not bring an end to their
hard work. Kairam referred to it as
merely "a good note on which to start
the year."
With the group's first album,"Raags
to Riches," a compilation of most of
Raagapella's pieces from the last sever
al years — including the three that won
them top honors at Anahat — in the
final stages of production, group mem
bers look forward to the rest of the year.
The group's success comes on the heels
of the Basmati Raas dance team's na
tional title and the competitive emer
gence of the Hindi Film Dance, helping
to make South Asian performance as
popular on Stanford's campus as it is na
tionally.
Before they next take the stage, Raa
gapella members will be selling copies
of their new album on Dec. 13 in White
Plaza.
