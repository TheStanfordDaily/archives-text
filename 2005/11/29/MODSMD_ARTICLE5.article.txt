## OSA looking for Greenwell replacement Asst. director of OSA oversees all Greek and student-planned parties 
### LOREN NEWMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student party planners across campus felt
the void when Assistant Director of the Of
fice of Student Affairs (OSA) Joey Cireenwell
resigned over the summer and moved on to
bigger and better things. His position encom
passes the oversight and approval of all stu
dent-planned parties on campus, including
those hosted by fraternities and Row houses.
"He was a friend to the Greek system in
the sense that when we had questions about
events we were planning, everyone was com
fortable going to him to get the official — and
even unofficial — standpoint," said senior

"When we had questions about events we were planning, every
one was comfortable going to [Joey Greenwell] to get the official
—and even unofficial —standpoint."
— DEREK ALLEY, senior

Derek Alley, president and former social
chair of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. "He was
definitely firm in upholding University policy,
but he was really easy to approach and
bounce ideas off of. Everybody who dealt
with him had his cell phone number, and you
could call him with questions at any time."
In late 20()3, The Daily reported that
Greenwell had "waived the normal 14-day
pre-approval deadline" for an alcoholic

ASSU tailgate party in the Mirrielecs Court
yard. However, Greenwell's occasional le
nicnce is a tradition that may not he carried
on by his successor.
"We're currently searching fora replace
ment for Mr. Greenwell," said OSA Director
Nanci Howe. "This is not a policy or leader
ship change. This is just a staff change. There's
really no story here."
Most of those involved are eager
to believe that Greenwell's absence
will not result in any permanent
party planning policy permutations.
"I don't think that there will be
any drastic policy changes," Alley
said. "He didn't make any special
considerations for Greeks."
The current, simple party ap
proval process is enjoyed by upper
and underclassmen alike.
"Planning parties is really easy —
I was actually surprised at how easy it
was; the only real obstacle is the
sober monitor requirement," said
freshman Sonia Poltoratski, social
chair for Branner Hall. "It's definite
ly harder to plan parties at other
schools, but it's good to have some
logical guidelines. However, it would
be very easy to make planning a
party more difficult than it is now."
The new director, yet to be
named, will face an uphill battle
against student expectations.
"People aren't going to be com
fortable with the new person at first,
and that's something that he or she
is going to have to combat," Alley
said. "There should be some sort of
round-table forum where the new
AD sits down with student leaders
and makes himself known. The new
person, whoever he or she is, will
have to make an effort to make
themselves as open to students as
Joey was.
"He really played the role of
friend and advisor better than any
one," Alley added. "He was always
there for us."
