# Union votes to allow strike
## Ninety-six percent of union members vote to authorize a strike to gain leverage with University officials 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford University service work
ers voted overwhelmingly last night
to give their union the right to strike.
The vote passed with 96 percent sup
port after leaders of the negotiating
team for Service Employee Interna
tional Union Local 715 (SEIU) told
members that a vote to authorize a
strike would be crucial to gain lever
age in talks with University officials.
While union leaders said that an
imminent strike is unlikely, the vote
means that more than 1,300 Univer
sity employees could go on strike as
early as today. Last night's vote
means that unionized University
workers can join the nearly 1,300
Stanford Hospital workers who
voted last Tliesday to authorize a
strike in a work stoppage that could
bring many University operations to
a standstill.
Workers gathered in three meet
ings through the afternoon to be
briefed by union representatives and
cast a small postcard-sized ballot. A
"yes" vote accepted University pro
posals — which union negotiators
called inadequate — while a "no"
vote rejected the University's offer
and gave the negotiating committee
the right to call fora strike at its dis
cretion.
SEIU Local 715 Chief Negotiator
John Vellardita said that both sides
were "very far apart" on the details
of the renegotiation and that the
University has not taken the talks se
riously.
"There are two major issues at
stake — health insurance and pen
sions," he said. "Our members are

damn serious about these issues, and
they're prepared to draw a line in the
sand over them."
The University strongly disputed
SElU's claims that the contract is not
fair to workers.
"Stanford's benefit package is
very competitive — Stanford spends
over 30 cents on employee benefits
for salary dollar," the University said
in an unsigned statement released on
Nov. 23. "Hie current contract pro
vides for competitive wages and also
offers a generous and complete ben
efit package including health bene
fits, dental, life insurance and pen
sion benefits.
"In addition, employees receive
generous educational benefits, in
cluding staff training assistance, staff
tuition reimbursement and tuition
grant benefits for children of eligible
employees," the University added in
the statement. "Stanford also pro
vides health benefits for its retired
employees."
Union and University represen
tatives have continued to meet even
while the union has prepared fora
strike. Both sides met yesterday
morning to continue negotiations
but made no progress. The union's
negotiators told workers and press
last night in a Bonair Siding meeting
room that the University has not
been willing to compromise. The ne
gotiators are not scheduled to meet
again until Dec. 8.
Union leaders said they hope that
the vote to authorize the strike will
force the University to "wake up and
smell the coffee."
"Our outlook is to go to theses-

Stanford service workers submit their ballots at yesterday's strike votes, which passed with 96 percent support. Ne
gotiations between Service Employee International Union Local 715 (SEIU) and the University are at an impasse.

sion [on Dec. 8] and bargain in good faith," Vel
lardita said in an interview with The Daily, noting
that a vote to authorize a strike does not mean a
strike is guaranteed. "We hope the LJniversity will
as well."
The University contended in its press release
last week that a no-strike provision in the contract
prohibits the union from stopping work until the
current contract ends on Aug. 31,2006.
Senior Assistant to the President Jeff Wachtel
declined to comment on behalf of the University.
"We arc discussing the situation and formulat
ing a plan," he said in a phone interview with The
Daily. "There's still a contract that does not expire
until August 2006."
Union representatives told The Daily that the
no-strike provision does not apply because the
University officially reopened negotiations on five
sections of the existing contract three months ago.
The agreement for the reopening of the contract
did not contain a no-strike provision, Vellardita
said.
Regardless of the outcome to the current nego
tiations over portions of the contract that have
been reopened, the entire contract will come up
for renegotiation next year. A win or perceived
win by union negotiators could embolden workers
to demand more benefits, salary increases and
pension guarantees next year. A loss could weak
en the union and decrease its credibility in the eyes
of its members.
The SEIU local chapter has already set aside $ 1

million fora fund to support workers if a strike be
comes necessary. Vellardita said.
Several union workers said in interviews after
closed meetings with union bosses that they would
not tolerate what they called benefit cuts.
"They're trying to put us back to where Leland
Stanford left his workers to suffer after finishing
the railroad," said Ted Gathright. a unionized
technician at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, who described himself as a reluctant strik
er. "It is not right for the University to unilateral
ly try to take away our benefits. The only way to
negotiate is to tell them that we are going to stand
up to them. The only way to do that is to vote to
authorize a strike."
"We have to show that we care about the issues
on the table," said groundskeeper Chris
McGilvery, likening the efforts of the union at
Stanford to his mother's struggle during the civil
rights movement. "We will do everything in our
power to show the University that these issues are
important to us. We won't rest until they are ad
dressed."
A coalition of pro-Union student groups met at
10 p.m. last night in El Centro Chicano to discuss
worker solidarity activities.The Student Labor Ac
tion Coalition (SLAC). pledged to fully support
workers in whatever they decide to do.
"It is SLAC's position that workers' voices
should be heard." said SLAC spokesman Matt
Seriff-Cullick. a sophomore. "We'll do every
thing we can to make sure the University knows

that students care about the workers and their
quality of life."
With both Stanford Hospital and University
employees free to strike, Vellardita described what
he called an "emerging labor crisis at Stanford."
Some experts warn that SEIU's strategy at
Stanford carries a high risk for the union. Nelson
Lichtenstein, a professor at UC-Santa Barbara
who specializes in organized labor issues, told the
San Jose Business Journal in its current issue that
traditional moves like strikes tend to be less effec
tive today, forcing unions to find other, more cre
ative means to push their causes, such as commu
nity outreach.
The debate to strike or try other approaches
for leverage with employers exposes a deep rift
within organized labor as leaders struggle to deal
with shrinking union rolls and dwindling contri
butions. The SEIU, which represents many but
not all of Stanford's unionized labor force, broke
away from the AFL-CIO in a summer meeting
this year.
Nonetheless, Vellardita said he was confident
that other unions with members on campus — in
cluding construction workers — would support a
strike.
The 1.300 University workers now eligible to
strike include maintenance employees, laboratory
support personnel, custodians, food service em
ployees, audiovisual operators, nonexempt com
puter operations personnel, production clerks and
tape librarians.
