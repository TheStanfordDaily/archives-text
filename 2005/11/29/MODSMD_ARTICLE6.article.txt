# Union votes to allow strike
## Ninety-six percent of union members vote to authorize a strike to gain leverage with University officials 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford University service work
ers voted overwhelmingly last night
to give their union the right to strike.
The vote passed with 96 percent sup
port after leaders of the negotiating
team for Service Employee Interna
tional Union Local 715 (SEIU) told
members that a vote to authorize a
strike would be crucial to gain lever
age in talks with University officials.
While union leaders said that an
imminent strike is unlikely, the vote
means that more than 1,300 Univer
sity employees could go on strike as
early as today. Last night's vote
means that unionized University
workers can join the nearly 1,300
Stanford Hospital workers who
voted last Tliesday to authorize a
strike in a work stoppage that could
bring many University operations to
a standstill.
Workers gathered in three meet
ings through the afternoon to be
briefed by union representatives and
cast a small postcard-sized ballot. A
"yes" vote accepted University pro
posals — which union negotiators
called inadequate — while a "no"
vote rejected the University's offer
and gave the negotiating committee
the right to call fora strike at its dis
cretion.
SEIU Local 715 Chief Negotiator
John Vellardita said that both sides
were "very far apart" on the details
of the renegotiation and that the
University has not taken the talks se
riously.
"There are two major issues at
stake — health insurance and pen
sions," he said. "Our members are

damn serious about these issues, and
they're prepared to draw a line in the
sand over them."
The University strongly disputed
SElU's claims that the contract is not
fair to workers.
"Stanford's benefit package is
very competitive — Stanford spends
over 30 cents on employee benefits
for salary dollar," the University said
in an unsigned statement released on
Nov. 23. "Hie current contract pro
vides for competitive wages and also
offers a generous and complete ben
efit package including health bene
fits, dental, life insurance and pen
sion benefits.
"In addition, employees receive
generous educational benefits, in
cluding staff training assistance, staff
tuition reimbursement and tuition
grant benefits for children of eligible
employees," the University added in
the statement. "Stanford also pro
vides health benefits for its retired
employees."
Union and University represen
tatives have continued to meet even
while the union has prepared fora
strike. Both sides met yesterday
morning to continue negotiations
but made no progress. The union's
negotiators told workers and press
last night in a Bonair Siding meeting
room that the University has not
been willing to compromise. The ne
gotiators are not scheduled to meet
again until Dec. 8.
Union leaders said they hope that
the vote to authorize the strike will
force the University to "wake up and
smell the coffee."
"Our outlook is to go to theses-
