## U.S. delays response to CIA jails 
### PAUL AMES ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BERLIN (AP) — The United
States has told the European Union
it needs more time to respond to
media reports that the CIA set up se
cret jails in some European nations
and transported terror suspects by
covert flights, the top EU justice offi
cial said yesterday.
Justice and Home Affairs Com
missioner Franco Frattini also
warned that that any of the 25 bloc
nations found to have operated se
cret CIA prisons could have their
EU voting rights suspended.
The Council of Europe — the
continent's main human rights
watchdog — is investigating the alle
gations, and EU justice official
Jonathan Faul last week formally
raised the issue with White House
and U.S. State Department represen
tatives, Frattini said.
"They told him: 'Give us the ap
propriate time to evaluate the situa
tion.' Right now, there is no re
sponse," he said.
The CIA has refused to comment
on the European investigation.
Frattini said suspending EU vot
ing rights would be justified under
the EU treaty, which stipulates that
the bloc is founded on the principles
of liberty, democracy, respect for
human rights, fundamental free
doms and the rule of law, and that a
persistent breach of these principles
can be punished.
Clandestine detention centers
would violate the European Con
vention on Human Rights.
Allegations that the CIA hid and

interrogated key al-Qaida suspects
at Soviet-era compounds in Eastern
Europe were first reported Nov. 2 in
The Washington Post. A day after the
report appeared. Human Rights
Watch said it had evidence indicating
the CIA transported suspected ter
rorists captured in Afghanistan to
Poland and Romania.
Poland President Aleksander
Kwasniewski reiterated Monday that
his country has never allowed the
CI A to hold prisoners on its territory.
Kwasniewski said he was not the
right official to comment on related
allegations that CIA flights carrying
terror suspects had secretly landed

in Poland.
"No president is informed if some
plane lands," Kwasniewski said.
Frattini said Romania's interior min
ister, Vasile Blaga. had assured him
the allegations were untrue and that
a base at Mihail Kogalniceanu was
not used as a detention center.
"It is very, very important to get
the truth. It is impossible to move
only on the basis of allegations,"
Frattini said.
Reports of secret CIA flights fol
lowed the allegations of secret pris
ons, as more and more countries
have decided to open investigations
into the issue. Frattini said if the

flights took place without the knowl
edge of local authorities, they would
be violations of international avia
tion agreements.
Other airports that might have
been used by CIA aircraft in some
capacity include Palma de Mallorca
in Spain, Larnaca in Cyprus and
Shannon in Ireland, as well as the
U.S. air base at Ramstein, Germany,
EU officials have said. Investiga
tions into alleged CIA landings or
fly overs have been launched in
Austria, Denmark, Iceland, Norway
and Sweden, and there have been
unconfirmed reports in Macedonia
and Malta.
