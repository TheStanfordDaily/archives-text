Winter Quarter Workshop in Jazz Oratorio:
"Bound for the Promised Land"
Taught by Marcus Shelby
Ford Resident Dialogues Artist-in-Residence Fellow
Presented by the Committee on Black Performing Arts
at Stanford University
January 10 - March 16, 2006
Winter Quarter Class Fuses Jazz with Investigation into Life of Underground Railroad
Heroine - Award-winning composer, arranger, and bassist Marcus Shelby offers Stanford students the
opportunity to participate in a unique artistic collaboration: a workshop developing the composition and
production of an oratorio for jazz orchestra and chorus based on the momentous life-story of Harriet
Tubman.
Through research and discussion of Tubman's impact on American history, this course explores how her
own relationship to song inspires jazz composition. The manner in which Tubman improvised spirituals to
communicate coded messages - forming a call-and-response dialogue with other slaves - represents, in
fact, the very roots of jazz improvisation.
Experimenting with jazz as a narrative tool, students conduct independent research, and work collective
ly, to create source material contributing to the final composition and presentation of this original work,
which will premiere at the 2006 Yerba Buena Gardens Festival in San Francisco. The Museum of the African
Diaspora is partnering with Shelby to design a K-12 curriculum resulting from this project.
This course is open to students with concentrations in African-American Studies, Education, Feminist
Studies, History, and Music. Admission is by application. MUSIC 185, 5 units, T/TH 3:15-6:00 pm.
