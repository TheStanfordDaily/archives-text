## Harry Potter and the Unbearable Closet 
### 
Dear J.K. Rowling,
I'm writing to congratulate you on
the successful film adaptation of
your amazing book, "Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire." I was fortunate
enough to see the film over Thanksgiv
ing break with a group of Muggle
friends of mine. Like those before it,
this film cast a spell on me, and I soon
found myself spending the majority of
my graduate student stipend on Harry
Potter merchandise and collectibles. In
case you haven't noticed, your books
have created quite a marketing sensa
tion!
In fact, last summer I found myself at
a DVD emporium in the Times Square
area of New York City and noticed a
film parody called "Hairy Pecker and
the Sorcerer's Bone." I flipped over the
DVD case and noticed that it was an
adult adaptation starring a charming
young fellow and his impressive magic
wand. Even though the production val
ues were far inferior and it lacked im
pressive special effects, there was some
thing about the parody that intrigued
me. For the first time I had to ask myself,
"Could Harry Potter be gay?"
Initially I laughed out loud at the
idea. I mean. I couldn't help but notice
how Harry and his friends had obvious
ly surpassed the cusp of puberty in this
last movie and Harry's rugged British
masculinity seemed to attract many of
the girls at Hogwarts. His attraction to
women was also evident in his close
friendship with Hermione. If he was gay.
why would he be interested in having a
girl fora best friend?
I admit that when the first book was
released, there were striking similarities
between Harry's story and my own. He
was forced to live under the stairs in a
broom closet and was ridiculed by his
family for being abnormal. I too was
forced to live in a closet of my own for
many years and felt very alienated for
being different. Also, had he not en
rolled at Hogwarts, Harry would have
gone to Stonewall High. If I had not en
rolled at Columbia University, I proba
bly would have been at the Stonewall in
New York, trying to make it as a go-go
boy or something. Thankfully, we both
escaped the brutality of the real world
by enrolling in prestigious academic in
stitutions; only I'm becoming a doctor
and he's becoming a wizard.
I think it's a bit too early to speculate
if Harry and I bat for the same Ouid
ditch team, but I can't say I'd be entire
ly surprised if your last novel is "Harry
Potter and the Unbearable Closet."
Should Harry be gay, I hope that you
would write about him,love him and ac
cept him for the remarkable wizard that
he is.
Regardless of his orientation,
though, it cannot be denied that the
hoy we see in the Harry Potter books
and movies is somewhat queer. He's
different, both from his Muggle family
and his peers. The challenges he faces
are not just with observable monsters
and ghosts, but also with his own inner
demons, the development of his identi
ty and his position in the world around
him. In truth, there are many aspects to
Harry's development that parallel the
stereotypical coming out story.
At the very least, his journey is a com
pelling coming of age story that res
onates with many adolescents and
young adults (and graduate students)
who contemplate what it means to be
different. I want to thank you for pre
senting Harry in a way that allows for
multiple interpretations of his character.
I appreciate these books and movies
because they remind us "different" is
not always "bad." I also appreciate the
British hottie Robert Pattinson who
plays Cedric Diggory. prefect and Cap
tain of the Hufflepuff I louse Quidditch
team. Next time you see him. put in a
word for me.
Keep up the good work. J.K. I can't
wait until your next book is released.
And if you decide to use my title sug
gestion. I'd kindly accept a small royal
ty token of your appreciation.

demons, the development of his identi
ty and his position in the world around
him. In truth, there are many aspects to
Harry's development that parallel the
stereotypical coming out story.
At the very least, his journey is a com
pelling coming of age story that res
onates with many adolescents and
young adults (and graduate students)
who contemplate what it means to be
different. I want to thank you for pre
senting Harry in a way that allows for
multiple interpretations of his character.
I appreciate these books and movies
because they remind us "different" is
not always "bad." I also appreciate the
British hottie Robert Pattinson who
plays Cedric Diggory. prefect and Cap
tain of the Hufflepuff I louse Quidditch

word for me.
Keep up the good work. J.K. I can't

Dear J.K. Rowling,
I'm writing to congratulate you on
the successful film adaptation of
your amazing book, "Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire." I was fortunate
enough to see the film over Thanksgiv
ing break with a group of Muggle
friends of mine. Like those before it,
this film cast a spell on me, and I soon
found myself spending the majority of
my graduate student stipend on Harry
Potter merchandise and collectibles. In
case you haven't noticed, your books
have created quite a marketing sensa
tion!
In fact, last summer I found myself at
a DVD emporium in the Times Square
area of New York City and noticed a
film parody called "Hairy Pecker and
the Sorcerer's Bone." I flipped over the
DVD case and noticed that it was an
adult adaptation starring a charming
young fellow and his impressive magic
wand. Even though the production val
ues were far inferior and it lacked im
pressive special effects, there was some
thing about the parody that intrigued
me. For the first time I had to ask myself,
"Could Harry Potter be gay?"
Initially I laughed out loud at the
idea. I mean. I couldn't help but notice
how Harry and his friends had obvious
ly surpassed the cusp of puberty in this
last movie and Harry's rugged British
masculinity seemed to attract many of
the girls at Hogwarts. His attraction to
women was also evident in his close
friendship with Hermione. If he was gay.
why would he be interested in having a
girl fora best friend?
I admit that when the first book was
released, there were striking similarities
between Harry's story and my own. He
was forced to live under the stairs in a
broom closet and was ridiculed by his
family for being abnormal. I too was
forced to live in a closet of my own for
many years and felt very alienated for
being different. Also, had he not en
rolled at Hogwarts, Harry would have
gone to Stonewall High. If I had not en
rolled at Columbia University, I proba
bly would have been at the Stonewall in
New York, trying to make it as a go-go
boy or something. Thankfully, we both
escaped the brutality of the real world
by enrolling in prestigious academic in
stitutions; only I'm becoming a doctor
and he's becoming a wizard.
I think it's a bit too early to speculate
if Harry and I bat for the same Ouid
ditch team, but I can't say I'd be entire
ly surprised if your last novel is "Harry
Potter and the Unbearable Closet."
Should Harry be gay, I hope that you
would write about him,love him and ac
cept him for the remarkable wizard that
he is.
Regardless of his orientation,
though, it cannot be denied that the
hoy we see in the Harry Potter books
and movies is somewhat queer. He's
different, both from his Muggle family
and his peers. The challenges he faces
are not just with observable monsters
and ghosts, but also with his own inner
demons, the development of his identi
ty and his position in the world around
him. In truth, there are many aspects to
Harry's development that parallel the
stereotypical coming out story.
At the very least, his journey is a com
pelling coming of age story that res
onates with many adolescents and
young adults (and graduate students)
who contemplate what it means to be
different. I want to thank you for pre
senting Harry in a way that allows for
multiple interpretations of his character.
