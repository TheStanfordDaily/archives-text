# BIG RAILROAD

With heavy traffic, aggressive
Marguerites and an exorbi
tant n umber of stop
signs, you can suffer more
whiplash while driving on
campus than you might
while teaching your 16-year-old brother the rules
of the road. And come January, the situation may
worsen.
Since March 2005, the University has purchased
CalTrain GO Passes for all graduate students that
live off campus, according to Tom Lee, co-chair of
the Graduate Student Council. GO Pass holders can
ride CalTrain for free whenever they desire and this
subsidized service encourages many graduate stu
dents to ditch their cars for public transportation.
"Trains are more inconvenient than driving
e.g., you will have to walk, bike or take public trans
portation to the CalTrain station, the weather may
be bad, the trains or you may be running late, etc.."
says Marcus Folch. a graduate student in classics.
"But 1 have heard from several students that the in
centive of having free passes is what makes them
take on the extra inconvenience."
The University, however, will stop giving out GO
Passes to graduate students in January.
"The University adopted the GO Pass for off
campus graduate students as a nine month pilot pro
gram," says Brodie Hamilton, director of Parking
and Transportation Services. "No intent to continue
with the program was identified at all. and no Uni
versity funds have been allocated for continuing GO
Pass funding [for off-campus graduate students] at
this point."
Notably, the University also gives free GO Pass
es to faculty and staff and will continue to do so,
I lamilton says.

"Stanford began providing the passes to faculty
and staff members three years ago to comply with
the General Use Permit (GUP) condition that no
net new peak hour trips be generated by the Univer
sity," Hamilton explains. "The GUP is the Santa
Clara County approved growth plan for the Univer
sity that identifies over 100 conditions with which
the University must comply in order to add 2 million
square feet of academic space over the next 10 to 15
years."
Providing GO Passes to faculty and staff has
helped keep the car traffic from exceeding the spec
ified trip limits, according to Hamilton.
" Hie University's resolution to keep giving facul
ty and staff passes — but discontinue funding for
graduate student passes — is rooted in the fact that
faculty and staff are the vast majority of people who
are coming and going during peak traffic times," he
says.
Folch says he, too. thinks the University made
this decision because CalTrain is increasing the
price of each pass from about $79.50 to $99.50. Ad
ditionally, CalTrain forces the University to pur
chase the passes for all off-campus graduate stu
dents — even those who will not use the passes. Ac
cording to Folch. this came out to about 3.200 pass
es in 2004-2005, and only 1,400 graduate students
picked them up.
"We do not have the details on how many of that
1.400 use it on a regular, semi-regular or irregular
basis," Folch continues."The University is still work
ing to gather that information."
Many students are upset by the prospect of hav
ing to pay for train rides once again, and Folch says
that canceling the GO Pass program could increase
"congestion and cars driving on campus, especially
during the morning rush hour when students are

coming in to teach classes or work in labs."
Discontinuing the GO Pass program for this
group could also be financially devastating for many
students, Lee says.
"Monthly passes to Palo Alto cost between $636
and $2,067 annually, depending on where the stu
dent lives," Lee explains. "A student living in San
Francisco will pay $1,590 per year. The budgets of
many students will be unable to absorb this kind
of increase."
Electrical engineering graduate student Logi Vi
darsson says he loves the GO Pass and uses it every
day for his South San Jose-to-Stanford commute. If
Stanford takes it away, he will have to pay about
$132.50 per month for transportation.
"That makes living on a modest grad-student
salary all the more difficult," Vidarsson says.
Discussions are underway between the Universi
ty and the Graduate Student Council Parking and
Transportation Advocacy Committee to address the
GO Pass program, says Committee Chair Hannah
Scherer, a doctoral student in the Department of
Geological and Environmental Sciences.
"I really appreciate all of the hard work that pre
vious committee members did for the current GO
Pass program and I want to continue their efforts."
Scherer says."Our committee is committed to work
ing with the administration to put together a sustain
able CalTrain subsidy program for graduate stu
dents."
And Folch says that the GSC and the University
may be able to find a different; less expensive way to
encourage students to take public transportation.
"What we may need to work on is developing a
more cost-effective commuter program — one that
reaches the same number of students (or more) but
may not involve the GO Pass," he says.
