## Two selected for scholarship founded in honor of Chinese engineering alumnus 
### KATIE BEARMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
A combination of outstanding academic
achievement and ripening industry in Tawain
has left two graduate students in the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering with a presti
gious award and an extra $ 10.(HH) in their
pockets.
Yifan Liang and Yijie Huo are this year's
winners of the Pan Wen-Yuan Scholarship,
distributed by the Pan Wen-Yuan Foundation,
an organization devoted to supporting schol
ars of Chinese ancestry in information science.
The foundation gives out a number of scholar
ships each year in the United States and
abroad to graduate students of such ancestry
studying electronics, information science and

communications. Monetary awards have been
offered to two Stanford students per year for
the past nine years.
The foundation was set up to honor the late
Wen-Yuan Pan, who received a Ph.D. in engi
neering from Stanford in 1940 and was one of
the founders of Taiwan's integrated circuit in
dustry. This industry has "played a vital role"
in Taiwan's "rapid economic progress" over
the past two decades, according to the founda
tion's Web site.
Pan was passionate about the "technical ed
ucation of Chinese descendants," the site
states.
Huo and Liang received top-ranking
scores on the Department of Electrical Engi
neering's qualifying exam and have the high
est CiPAs among all students of Chinese an
cestry in the program, says Natasha Newson,
the department's manager of academic pro
grams and student services director.
l.iang received a bachelor's degree in engi
neering and graduated summa cum laude
from the University of Science and Technolo

gy of China in 2002.There,he was a member of
the Special Class for the Gifted Young. This
program was established in 1978 for universi
ty students in China and supports a research
intensive academic environment,according to
the university's Web site. It also encourages
teamwork and personal integrity.
In 2<X)4, Liang earned a master's degree
from Purdue University and has been at Stan
ford since, conducting research with Electrical
Engineering Prof. Andrea Goldsmith on wire
less communication.
"Ongoing projects focus on multiple-an
tenna and multi user communication," l.iang
explains. "Every bit of progress I make, [Gold
smith] is an essential part of it. I should also
thank my associate adviser. [Electrical Engi
neering! ' >r °f John Cioffi. and my academic
adviser. [Electrical Engineering] Prof. John
Gill, for their invaluable advice."
Huo received a bachelor's degree in elec
trical engineering from Tsinghua University in
Beijing. Since coming to Stanford just over a
year ago. Huo has published a paper and has

received As and A-pluses in all of his electri
cal engineering courses. He is researching in
tegrated nonlinear optics.
"I locus on integrated nonlinear optics de
vices. which generate lasers at different wave
lengths than input ones in a short distance with
high efficiency." liuo explains. '■'Iliese kinds of
devices are very useful in optical fiber commu
nication and inter-chip connection."
Huo's faculty advisers are Electrical Engi
neering Profs. James Harris and Shanhui Pan
and Applied Physics Prof. Martin Fejer.
"[ Ilie professors] provide me a challenging
intellectual environment, talented and moti
vated colleagues, excellent resources and
many diverse opportunities," Huo says."I
could not do such a great job without their
support."
Huo adds that he's excited about the schol
arship and views it as encouragement to con
tinue working hard in the field.
"The money doesn't mean as much as the
honor." he remarks. "Maybe. 1 can spend the
money to visit my friends all over the world."
