The Daily Editorial Board has been
critical of the University's decision
process on the site for Commence
ment 2(X)6. But the University, and President
John Hennessy in particular, deserve credit
for their choice to reevaluate the location,
solicit public comment and use that input
meaningfully in their final decision.
No location could please everyone in
volved, and we can make arguments in favor
of Frost Amphitheater. Roble Field and the
football practice field. In the end, this board
decided that the original selection Frost
Amphitheater, with its smaller capacity, was
the wrong choice. But we have always seen
the merits and arguments against all three
possible locations.
Precisely because this was an important
and contentious issue, we think the Univer
sity took the right steps in opening up the de
cision-making process and publicizing the
results.

In our last editorial on Commencement,
we specifically called on I lennessy to release
the results of the informal survey he asked
seniors and their families to complete. In his
e-mail announcing the final decision on
Commencement 2(M)6, Hennessy cited ag
gregate measures from the survey, and we
applaud this decision to publicly disclose the
popular response.
We believe that this type of review, an
advisory referendum, has significant poten
tial. While surveys have limitations, they
can be used to get a sense of community
sentiment and put everyone on the same
page, especially at the beginning of decision
processes.
It is unfortunate that maximum guest ca
pacity cannot be combined with Frost's cozy
confines, but we appreciate the University's
decision to reconsider the 2(X)6 graduation
site and for its overall responsiveness to stu
dent input.
