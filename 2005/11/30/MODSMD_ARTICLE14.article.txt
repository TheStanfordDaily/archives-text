Student loans are a fact of life for many
students, and as Stanford students, we are
luckier than most. Our financial aid pro
gram is one of the most generous and well-ad
ministered in the country. Students at many
other schools are envious, and rightly so.
But we shouldn't be complacent about
our good fortune. It's too easy for us to sign
our names on the dotted line promising to
pay back huge sums of money and get our
checks at the beginning of the semester, only
to forget about them for the next four
months.
However, a few smart decisions about
where to borrow funds can end up putting
significantly more money in your pocket at
the beginning of the semester, when you
need it most.
Most importantly, not all financial
lenders are created equal. Many of you may
have noticed an item on your tuition bill to
taling as much as several hundred dollars la
beled "origination fees." This mysterious
item is a service charge assessed by many
lenders to cover the "administrative fees" in
volved in processing your student loan.
On federal Stafford loans, origination
fees typically start at 3 percent and go up

from there. On a $S,(KM) disbursement, that's
at least $150 taken off the top — by the very
lender you're borrowing the money from.
Is this some sort of scam? Maybe, maybe
not (the fees are regulated by federal legisla
tion). But if you don't like the idea of auto
matically paying hundreds of dollars every
semester, there are alternatives.To name just
a few. Access Group and Wells Fargo both
offer Stafford loans and rebate the origina
tion fees.
It's particularly important for students
whose financial aid packages designate a de
fault lender to examine their options. For ex
ample, the Law School designates Citibank
— which assesses origination fees — as the
default lender for recipients of federal loans.
However, by filling out just a few forms, stu
dents can get their loans through a different
lender — saving themselves money in the
process.
Every student's financial aid package is
different, and different lenders and loans
will be appropriate for different people.
However, when dealing with large sums of
money that you'll be paying back for years to
come, it never hurts to make sure you're get
ting the best deal.
