# Let's go Card
## 
### 
Post-Thanksgiving and possessed of
newly-rounded,turkey-filled bellies, I'm
sure that for many of you Big Game
weekend is a distant memory. So let me start
by refreshing that memory.
Precariously balanced on a rickety bench,
the chants ricocheting around me, I finally felt
like I belonged to the Stanford community.
The campus had been buzzing all week.
Rallies had been held. T-shirts had been
bought. Bears had been prepared for ritual
sacrifice. Gaieties had been performed. We
were ready.
On the day itself, the air was thick with an
ticipation* and the crowd was as one. We
steeled ourselves and rallied behind our boys
for the greater glory of the University. Victory
was inevitable-
Well. that was how I imagined the Big
Game would go down. In reality things didn't
quite work out as expected. Fora start,we lost.
While I have much to say about football (a
very odd game) and American sports in gen
eral. it seems best to leave the dissection of the
Cardinal performance against Cal to more
qualified folk.
(And, what's more, after this Saturday's
impressive performance against the Irish, the
football part of the festivities seems somewhat
less relevant.)
So, if not a detailed play-by-play break
down of the game, what can I talk about? Well,
I suppose I could start with expectations. Ah.
such expectations I had.
In fact, ever since arriving in America I've
been filled with ideas about college life (most
ly based on "Animal House"), none of which
have been realized.
This is partly (perhaps even mostly) be
cause the graduate student routine involves
eliminating all the fun from you life. It also ap
pears that the celluloid college experience was
not quite on the mark.
Take, for example, tailgating. This is an ac
tivity with distant cousins on the other side of
the Atlantic, but there is nothing quite on the
same scale. So. figuring that if the kids got wild
it would be on "Beat Cal" day. I decided it was
the perfect opportunity to try something new.
Obviously, my initial plan was to go to a
tailgate, get horribly drunk and find some Cal
folks to tar and feather. Recalling, however,
that I don't drink. I instead spent the time sur
veying the grounds around the stadium.
I may have missed something in my tour,
but frankly, I couldn't help but conclude that
the pre-game scene was a little... lame.
There was a lot going on.but a) it was most
ly folks from Berkeley, b) the Stanford atten
dance was sorely lacking in students and, most
distressingly.c) the whole affair was very, very.

very corporate.
The family-friendly atmosphere at Ameri
can sporting events has been a general disap
pointment,and I had hoped that on Big Game
day things would have a little more edge.
Sadly, it seems that the folks at Lexus (and
several other equally thrilling firms) would
disagree. Rather than stumbling college kids
and drunken debauchery, the most exciting
thing 1 found was a full size hologram of a car.
Unusual, but not quite Bluto.
Thankfully, while the corporate buzz of
game day was a letdown (plus the whole thing
was hardly a novel experience — I've been to
high school fairs before), the previous night
had been much more entertaining. I was at
Gaieties.
There I had fairly low expectations. I'd
been to a Ram's I lead production previously
("Pinkertons") and it was, by some margin,
the worst amateur production I had ever seen
performed on stage.
On the other hand. "Who Killed Dean
Julie?" was one of the funniest. Despite not
understanding many of the references (why
does "Branner Suck"?) and being a little
shocked by the innuendo (must be a sign of
age) I was still thoroughly entertained. And.
what's more. I was impressed to see the under
grads show a little life.
Funnily enough I found myself seated in
front of a cast member during the game,
which, as we watched our fourth quarter col
lapse, left me contrasting the two Stanford tra
ditions I had just ticked off my list.
While it had its moments. Big Game day it
self was a striking example of one of Stan
ford's great flaws — it's ability to absorb
everything into the vast corporate monolith,
blurring out features of interest and leaving
behind only the bland and the bleak.
On the other hand. Gaieties was Stanford
at its best. Irreverent, lively and unrepentant
ly sordid, it were a useful reminder that, de
spite how they appear from a distance, the un
dergraduate population is not entirely com
posed of soulless androids.
And there you have it; two more experi
ences have been chalked up. The march
through Stanford continues. Just have to find
that toga party now...
