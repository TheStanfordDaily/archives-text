# The 						Rowling Ratio
## 
### 
If Stanford were to release an album of stu
dent voices, it would sound something like
this: "I'm so behind," "I just found out I'm
in E40," "I drank a forty during my Psych
final," "I never do anything." Yeah right. Not
surprisingly, Princeton Review likens Stan
ford students to ducks on a pond: We appear
incredibly serene on the surface but paddle
like mad under the water. Clever metaphor,
but which is it, bums or ducks?
The answer is somewhere in between.
Stanford students don't sit around watching
their favorite posters succumb to gravitation
al force, nor do they read every last word of
their ridiculously long assignments. These
days, too many distractions exist for either to
be true. Our generation is faced with a serious
issue that will only become more difficult with
time. It's an issue that began long ago but
today is at an inflection point. That issue is
media saturation.
Imagine a giant chalkboard where every
person in the world is a node and any person's
ability to make a demand on another's time is
a connecting line. Now, imagine an illiterate
city-state during the B.C. period. What does
the board look like? Well, first off, there are
probably family clusters.Then there are prob
ably some friends connecting those clusters
here and there, and maybe even a couple
dozen interconnections for campfire story ses
sions. Then, lastly, there's a handful of royalty,
or supernodcs, who can call some kind of giant
assembly; they connect to thousands of people
but rarely use this power. The typical person
on this board probably has only a few dozen
incoming lines that can make demands on
their time. Easy living, eh?
OK, so you're a Stanford student, and de
spite never doing anything, you probably
know where this is going. Fast forward to the
printing press; suddenly anybody who can

write a book can be a supernode. Hit "»"
again, and you're in the 20th century with
radio, television and movies. A Hollywood
producer can spend three months perfecting a
story and then distribute it to tens of millions
of people.That's one hell of a campfire.
Finally, enter the digital age. You've got a
cell phone, which enables anybody you know
to make an instant demand on your time.
Meanwhile, anybody in the world can send
you an e-mail, making a delayed demand on
your time. With the popularization of blogs
(which about 30 percent of U.S. Internet users
read, with 91 percent of them in our age
group), anybody can access a printing press.
Or, if you prefer, you can broadcast through
MP3s, podcasts, text messages or Web pages
(there are now more of them than people on
Earth). Instead of isolated clusters, our chalk
board now has quadrillions of lines connect
ing every "connected" person in the world to
every other "connected" person.
If you took CSIO6B, you know that Met
calf's Law of networks says we are either em
powered or screwed, depending on how you
look at it. In a network, the number of connec
tor lines grows exponentially with each added
person. That means for every additional per
son who joins the digital age. you can add an
other billion lines to the chalkboard (versus a
few dozen in the B.C. era). Not sure what I'm
getting at? I lere are two examples:

Suppose you are a polite, unassuming Mir
rielees resident. Now suppose you spend a
solid 90 seconds crafting an especially witty "I
need a teaspoon of flour for my fun dinner
party" e-mail so the world won't despise you.
That e-mail goes out to 4(H) people. Say half of
them read it, and it takes them 12 seconds
each. That's 200 times 12, err 2 times 2, 1
times...carry the...holy sh*t,a lot of seconds —
2400 of them, or 40 minutes. You could have
gone to Safeway to get the pinch of flour your
self in that time; that's the power of networks.
Let's take it up a notch. J.K. Rowling's
Harry Potter series has about 250 million
books in print and $2 billion in box office sales.
I'll spare you the calculations, but if you as
sume it takes 10 hours to read a book and 2.5
hours to see a movie, then Rowling's creation
is responsible for consuming approximately
350,000 person-years of time, or about S,(XM)
lifetimes, or roughly the annual productivity
of Minnesota. Rowling is, quite literally, larger
than life.
So where's your E4O time going? To the
Rowlings. In the B.C. city-state days a typical
person did a lot more talking because he or
she could only communicate his or her mes
sage to one or a few people.These days there's
less distributed talking and more consump
tion of supernodes on a massive scale.
So, my advice? Cell phones and personal e
mail are safe — those are old school, one-on
one. But if you want to nail that final.be selec
tive in your mass media consumption.
In particular, you might want to start by
avoiding Daily columns that describe clearly
obvious phenomena. With that. I'm off to cal
culate my Rowling ratio.

self in that time; that's the power of networks.
Let's take it up a notch. J.K. Rowling's
Harry Potter series has about 250 million
books in print and $2 billion in box office sales.
I'll spare you the calculations, but if you as
sume it takes 10 hours to read a book and 2.5
hours to see a movie, then Rowling's creation
is responsible for consuming approximately
350,000 person-years of time, or about S,(XM)
lifetimes, or roughly the annual productivity
of Minnesota. Rowling is, quite literally, larger
than life.
So where's your E4O time going? To the
Rowlings. In the B.C. city-state days a typical
person did a lot more talking because he or
she could only communicate his or her mes
sage to one or a few people.These days there's
less distributed talking and more consump
tion of supernodes on a massive scale.
So, my advice? Cell phones and personal e
mail are safe — those are old school, one-on
one. But if you want to nail that final.be selec
tive in your mass media consumption.
In particular, you might want to start by
avoiding Daily columns that describe clearly
obvious phenomena. With that. I'm off to cal
culate my Rowling ratio.

What can Brown do for you?
If Stanford were to release an album of stu
dent voices, it would sound something like
this: "I'm so behind," "I just found out I'm
in E40," "I drank a forty during my Psych
final," "I never do anything." Yeah right. Not
surprisingly, Princeton Review likens Stan
ford students to ducks on a pond: We appear
incredibly serene on the surface but paddle
like mad under the water. Clever metaphor,
but which is it, bums or ducks?
The answer is somewhere in between.
Stanford students don't sit around watching
their favorite posters succumb to gravitation
al force, nor do they read every last word of
their ridiculously long assignments. These
days, too many distractions exist for either to
be true. Our generation is faced with a serious
issue that will only become more difficult with
time. It's an issue that began long ago but
today is at an inflection point. That issue is
media saturation.
Imagine a giant chalkboard where every
person in the world is a node and any person's
ability to make a demand on another's time is
a connecting line. Now, imagine an illiterate
city-state during the B.C. period. What does
the board look like? Well, first off, there are
probably family clusters.Then there are prob
ably some friends connecting those clusters
here and there, and maybe even a couple
dozen interconnections for campfire story ses
sions. Then, lastly, there's a handful of royalty,
or supernodcs, who can call some kind of giant
assembly; they connect to thousands of people
but rarely use this power. The typical person
on this board probably has only a few dozen
incoming lines that can make demands on
their time. Easy living, eh?
OK, so you're a Stanford student, and de
spite never doing anything, you probably
know where this is going. Fast forward to the
printing press; suddenly anybody who can

write a book can be a supernode. Hit "»"
again, and you're in the 20th century with
radio, television and movies. A Hollywood
producer can spend three months perfecting a
story and then distribute it to tens of millions
of people.That's one hell of a campfire.
Finally, enter the digital age. You've got a
cell phone, which enables anybody you know
to make an instant demand on your time.
Meanwhile, anybody in the world can send
you an e-mail, making a delayed demand on
your time. With the popularization of blogs
(which about 30 percent of U.S. Internet users
read, with 91 percent of them in our age
group), anybody can access a printing press.
Or, if you prefer, you can broadcast through
MP3s, podcasts, text messages or Web pages
(there are now more of them than people on
Earth). Instead of isolated clusters, our chalk
board now has quadrillions of lines connect
ing every "connected" person in the world to
every other "connected" person.
If you took CSIO6B, you know that Met
calf's Law of networks says we are either em
powered or screwed, depending on how you
look at it. In a network, the number of connec
tor lines grows exponentially with each added
person. That means for every additional per
son who joins the digital age. you can add an
other billion lines to the chalkboard (versus a
few dozen in the B.C. era). Not sure what I'm
getting at? I lere are two examples:

Suppose you are a polite, unassuming Mir
rielees resident. Now suppose you spend a
solid 90 seconds crafting an especially witty "I
need a teaspoon of flour for my fun dinner
party" e-mail so the world won't despise you.
That e-mail goes out to 4(H) people. Say half of
them read it, and it takes them 12 seconds
each. That's 200 times 12, err 2 times 2, 1
times...carry the...holy sh*t,a lot of seconds —
2400 of them, or 40 minutes. You could have
gone to Safeway to get the pinch of flour your
self in that time; that's the power of networks.
