Great teachers are just as necessary
To the anonymous freshman who suggest
ed that Stanford students shouldn't become
elementary school teachers ("Teaching kids
their ABCs," Nov. 28):
I agree that change often happens from
top to bottom in the field of education. In
fact, California's classrooms have been over
hauled in recent years by top-to-bottom leg
islation like No Child Left Behind and Eng
lish for the Children, which have stolen
funding from the neediest schools, robbed
teachers of autonomy and banned bilingu.ll
education. Interestingly, all these changes
were initiated by individuals without any
practical knowledge of today's classrooms.
STEP (Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram) strives to create teacher leaders —
those who will make waves not only in the
classroom, but also in the field as a whole.
One might argue that a year in STEP, train
ing "just to become an elementary school

teacher," followed by several years of actual
classroom experience, is in fact the only way
"to train to get to a position where you can
make substantial change." By your logic, a
student interested in charging the field of
healthcare should skip all those silly years of
research and medical school, and go straight
to the top.
Finally, for all those friends and relatives
who so frequently pepper the members of
my cohort with the question: "Why are you
wasting your education to become an ele
mentary school teacher?" I offer a question
in return:
Are you honestly saying you want some
one less intelligent teaching your children?

Pleasure or terror?
Regarding Navin Sivanandam's article

trashing vegetarians ("The lobster was look
ing straight at me. and I burst into tears "Nov.
16): He accuses us of being "misguided," but
demonstrates an extraordinary ignorance of
the ways that modern factory farming exploit
animals. Every year in the United States, 10
billion farm animals are slaughtered after en
during lives of trauma and fear, crammed
into disgusting conditions at factory farms.
Although they die in droves, they each suffer
as individuals.
Navin wonders why we "shut out a whole
world of pleasure" by depriving ourselves of
dead animals. I wonder why he insists on
forcing sentient and innocent animals to en
dure a whole world of terror and suffering to
satiate his selfish palate.
