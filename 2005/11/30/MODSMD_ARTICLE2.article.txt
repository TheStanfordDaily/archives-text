## Earth scientists spar over world oil supply 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
As the price of oil skyrockets
and the world's supply of petrole
um dwindles, earth scientists are
scrambling to answer a timely
question with heavy political and
economic implications — is this
the end of oil?
In the first of a three-part lec
ture series on energy and the envi
ronment, co-sponsored by the
School of Earth Sciences and the
Stanford Institute for the Environ
ment, a panel of earth science pro
fessors, Amos Nur and Steven
Gorelick, tackled this very ques
tion, arriving at starkly different
conclusions.
Associate Dean of Earth Sci
ences Stephan Graham opened
last night's discussion in front of a
packed audience that filled the Ar

rillaga Alumni Center past its seat
ing capacity.
"We all have felt the sting of ris
ing oil princes in the past year,"
Graham said. "Now more than any
time people ask me what the future
holds. One thing that is clear, we in
the U.S. are consuming more and
more petroleum and less and less
crude oil, which begs the question
— how much petroleum is really
left?"
Before attacking this question,
Graham provided audience mem
bers with an overview of petrole
um's status. He also pointed out
the uneven regional distribution of
oil,citing 12 countries that current
ly possess 90 percent of the world's
oil reserves.
Nur quickly raised the stakes of
the discussion when he described
the scientific community as "in a
panic" over the swift depletion of
oil resources. To substantiate these
concerns, he pointed to data from
M. King Hubbert's bell curve of oil
production, which predicts an im
pending oil shortage.
" This curve proves that in the
very near future we'll need to rely
on alternative energy sources." Nur
said. "We are panicking now be
cause we've ignored this problem
for far too long."
Nur said that the crisis of oil de
pletion contributed to U.S. involve
ment in foreign "skirmishes" such
as the Gulf War and the current war
in Iraq.To make matters worse. Nur
said that increasing competition
between consumers over shrinking
oil resources will push the United
States and these major consumers
into larger, global conflicts.
According to Nur, fear of such
large-scale conflicts with other na
tions has forced the U.S. to take in
terest in maintaining the stability
of oil-rich regions of the world. In
other words, the decreasing oil sup
ply directly impacts U.S. foreign
policy in the Middle East. Nur
warned that such a strategy spells
long-term disaster for America.
"We have to come up with a dif
ferent approach to energy security
policy," Nur said. "Using force to
secure stable global sources and
the free flow of oil will not work for
much longer."
In contrast, Gorelick called
Nur's concerns a "myth," and ar
gued that the world's oil supply is
not running low. In fact, he stated
that it is being replenished by in
creased fuel efficiency and im
proved technology. To prove his ar
gument, Gorelick provided coun
terexamples to chip away at the
empirical credibility of the 11ub
bert bell curve-a model which
formed the crux of Nur's argu
ment.
"Hubbert's original curves were
drawn by hand and with no mathe
matical equation," Gorelick said.
"They have had no success in pre
dicting world oil production."
Gorelick also challenged con
ventional wisdom ranging back
from the early 1900s that continu

ally predicted oil shortages that
have yet to materialize.
"Iliese predictions have been
wrong because the estimated vol
ume of oil remaining has been a
moving target," Gorelick said. "We
consistently have more resources
than are suspected because im
provements in technology increase
the success of our reserve discover
ies. Because of this, we keep finding
more oil out there than we think
there was."
More importantly, he argued
that gas prices are actually trend
ing downward when one controls
for income inflation, pointing to
this fact among others as proof that
there is no clear economic evi
dence of oil scarcity.
Following Gorelick's presenta
tion, both professors fielded a num
ber of audience questions ranging
from concerns on gas prices to
other issues of oil depletion.
Kurt Rhoads, a doctoral candi
date in environmental engineering,
said that he found the lecture
worthwhile and engaging because
of the way it paired Gorelick and
Nur's opposing arguments. Never
theless, he felt swayed by the effi
cacy of Gorelick's argument due to
its empirical basis.
"Gorelick used many interest
ing examples to show that oil sup
plies aren't a large concern,"
Rhoads said. "I was most disap
pointed by the lack of supporting
evidence for Hubbert's supply
driven model."
On the other hand. Albert Liu. a
doctoral candidate in materials sci
ence and engineering, shared
Rhoads' enthusiasm for the event
but was skeptical of Gorelick's ar
gument.
"Although Gorelick is obvious
ly intelligent and articulate, unfor
tunately he misleads rather than
informs," Liu said. "He makes no
mention at all on externalities.
Does price of oil reflect its true
cost? What about environmental
destruction, government subsidies
to the oil industry and human costs
during foreign wars? He needed to
address these points with more
than a passing mention."
The remaining two lectures in
this series include a discussion on
climate and pollution on Feb. 21, as
well as a talk about the latest ad
vances toward environment-friend
ly energy alternatives on March 7.
Both are free to the public.
