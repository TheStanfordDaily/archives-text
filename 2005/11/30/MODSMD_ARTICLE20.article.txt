7 knew we would do well, but quite honestly; I wasn't expecting our team to win the whole thing.'

Hie Stanford campus is certainly accus
tomed to hosting exciting, high-level tennis
but the competition at the Northern Califor
nia Regional Campus Championships on
Nov. 19 and 20 brought a bit of an unusual

twist.
It isn't everyday that you see a match
where members of opposing teams are all
Stanford athletes, going head to head in a con
frontation that ultimately comes down to a
single nerve-wracking tiebreaker. 'ITiis Stan
ford-Stanford semifinal showdown was one
of a kind.
Because of the unique World Team Tennis
(W IT) format of the championship, this tour
nament had its fair share of close individual
matches and surprising team comebacks. The
battle between the two Stanford teams was

one of the most intense.
In every tournament contest between two
teams, five matches were played, each one
consisting of a single six-game set: a singles
and a doubles match for both the men and the
women, as well as a mixed doubles match.
Individual games were particularly crucial
as final scores were determined by the total
number of games won, rather than the num
ber of sets.
One factor that spiced up the competition
for the tournament was the WIT rule regard
ing the mixed doubles match. If the team trail-

ing before the final match succeeded in win
ning the set, the match would continue until
either the trailing team overtook its opponent
in the overall games-won score, or until the
leading team captured a single game. Hie
mixed doubles match — which is always
played last — was several times responsible
for deciding down-to-the-wire competition
and unexpected last-minute turnarounds.
