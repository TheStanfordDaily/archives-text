7 knew we would do well, but quite honestly; I wasn't expecting our team to win the whole thing.'

Hie Stanford campus is certainly accus
tomed to hosting exciting, high-level tennis
but the competition at the Northern Califor
nia Regional Campus Championships on
Nov. 19 and 20 brought a bit of an unusual

twist.
It isn't everyday that you see a match
where members of opposing teams are all
Stanford athletes, going head to head in a con
frontation that ultimately comes down to a
single nerve-wracking tiebreaker. 'ITiis Stan
ford-Stanford semifinal showdown was one
of a kind.
Because of the unique World Team Tennis
(W IT) format of the championship, this tour
nament had its fair share of close individual
matches and surprising team comebacks. The
battle between the two Stanford teams was

one of the most intense.
In every tournament contest between two
teams, five matches were played, each one
consisting of a single six-game set: a singles
and a doubles match for both the men and the
women, as well as a mixed doubles match.
Individual games were particularly crucial
as final scores were determined by the total
number of games won, rather than the num
ber of sets.
One factor that spiced up the competition
for the tournament was the WIT rule regard
ing the mixed doubles match. If the team trail-

ing before the final match succeeded in win
ning the set, the match would continue until
either the trailing team overtook its opponent
in the overall games-won score, or until the
leading team captured a single game. Hie
mixed doubles match — which is always
played last — was several times responsible
for deciding down-to-the-wire competition
and unexpected last-minute turnarounds.

The semifinal round of the Northern California Regional Campus Championships pitted the Stanford tennis club's two squads against each other with a trip to the finals at stake.
day of the tournament after both prevailed in the
quarterfinals against California and Colorado, re
spectively.
As it headed into the mixed doubles match, the
Stanford Cardinal team was in the lead. It was denied
immediate victory, however, by freshman Ana Pena
and senior Vinay Mahagaokar of Stanford White,
who scraped a 6-5 win over second-year graduate
student Mike Mulligan and freshman Isa Perez.
Pena and Mahagaokar's mixed doubles victory
pushed the match into overtime and tied the over
all team tallies. It was the Stanford Cardinal team
that finally clinched the match victory by a 7-3
score in the final 13-point Supertiebreaker.
The Cardinal team found itself in yet another
tight situation in the finals against San Francisco.
Though holding the lead heading into the mixed
doubles match, the Cardinal was forced into over
time after losing the set 5-6. But the Cardinal re
sponded by securing the one game needed to end
the set and hand defending champion USF the 23-
21 defeat.
Junior Carling Nguyen, a member of the team,
noted that strong lineups from all 15 teams hailing
from nine schools set the stage for great competi
tion. She also acknowledged the quality of both
Stanford teams.
"Going into the weekend, I knew both of our
teams were pretty deep," she said. "I knew we
would do well, but quite honestly, I wasn't expect
ing our team to win the whole thing."

Nguyen said that Perez's arrival on Sunday —
in the middle of Cardinal's quarterfinal match
against Colorado —was a turning point for the
team. Initially unsure of whether or not she would
be able to participate in the tournament at all.
Perez ended up winning multiple sets as both a sin
gles and doubles player.
Perez's mindset going into the tournament was
confident.
"You always want to win," Perez said. "And no
matter what, I always want to have fun and enjoy
the experience, no matter the outcome."
For someone who was the only member of her
high school tennis team, Perez enjoyed the oppor
tunity to both compete against and work with other
talented tennis players.
"It was amazing playing mixed doubles with
Ben [Backes] and Mike [Mulligan) and having
them there to help come through in the end," Perez
said.
The Stanford Cardinal's victory earned the
squad an automatic bid to the National Campus
Tournament to be held at Texas in April. USF and
Stanford,as the tournament's respective runner-up
and champion, each received $ 1 .(KK) dollars for
their representation of Northern California at the
national competition.
And judging from the stellar performance of
not only one, but two. complete Stanford tennis
squads, there is reason to have high hopes for the
club tennis team when it heads to nationals.

Dramatic end to tourney
