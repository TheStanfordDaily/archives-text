# Similar stories of success
## 
### 
The end of the regular football
season has either arrived or is
Hearing for all 117 Division I-A
college squads. But rather than
lament the painful results of our own
University's team over the past few
weeks, an even greater football story
lies with the most successful of teams
in the recent past — the Southern
California Trojans.
Now. 1 understand that each week
there seems to be at least one column
about the incredible feats accom
plished by the mighty men of Troy.
Even a casual browse through any
sports Web site or periodical presents
a take on the tremendous run. But
USC's unprecedented campaign for
three straight national titles justifies
the talk of history in the making.
But just watching a handful of
games in the Trojans' incredible 33-
game run inspires thoughts regarding
the similarities between the most suc
cessful team in college football and
the so-far undefeated Indianapolis
Colts of the NFL.
'ITie Trojans and the Colts are re
markably similar, not only in their
currently matching 11-0 records. With
a glance at the rosters and several in
cidents this season, the similarities are
striking.
That's not to say that the Trojans
could match up with the Colts. I'm
one of those people who would laugh
and casually dismiss the idea of
matching up the best college team
with even the worst NFL team. It
wouldn't even be close. However,
within their respective sports (if col
lege and professional football could
be considered different sports), these
two teams have been put together
and structured in similar ways, leav
ing them with personnel who able to
breed success.
First, a look at the offenses. Matt
Leinart and Peyton Manning are
both accurate, low-risk, prototypical
pocket passers, who rarely make mis
takes and routinely make good plays
great as they lead their respective of
fensive attacks. Physically they are
both 6-foot-5, with a weight differ
ence of only five pounds. Though
competition for the "guy-everyone
wants-to-be" never ceases, Leinart
and Manning currently serve as the
poster-children of the worlds of col
lege and professional football. And
they always remain calm, cool and
collected.
These two men exemplify the idea
of the team game and, for the most
part, sacrifice individual accolades.
These two teams found the right men
to take to the line.
In the passing game,quarterbacks
usually get most of the acclaim; only
in special situations do wide receivers
get nearly the same publicity. But this
is the case for these two teams.
Though the Trojans have the dis
advantage of having to continually
bring new players into the position


Samuel
(hen
The Eternal Optimist
due to graduation and attrition rates,
this year sophomore Dvvayne Jarrett
and junior Steve Smith are both spec
tacular receivers. With Marvin I larri
son and Reggie Wayne leading the
way for the Colts' receiving corps.
Manning hardly needs to worry about
mistakes on the receiving end of the
passes he makes. While naming only
the top two receivers for each team
does a disservice to all the talented
pass-catchers that both teams have, it
gives the utmost respect to these
teams' passing games — it also lends
credibility to claims that anyone on
the field eligible to catch the ball could
do so fora first down or touchdown
reception.
At running back, we find more of
the same.The Colts feature F.dgerrin
James, a 6-foot veteran tailback who
can run for power and has the speed
to move outside against the fast de
fensive backs that roam the NFL sec
ondaries. The Trojans feature the
highly-acclaimed (and rightly so) pair
of Reggie Bush (6-feet) and Lendale
White (6-foot-2).
While some say Bush is the quick
back and White the power back, I've
seen enough to say that the duo could
handle both duties if necessary.

The offensive lines have also fac
tored into the success both teams
have had.There is nothing worse than
a sack on third or fourth down late in
the game, but for these two teams,
blocking the pass-rush has been spec
tacular this season. In 11 games thus
far, Leinart has been sacked 13 times,
while Manning has been sacked only
nine times — the fewest among NFL
quarterbacks in the top 32 for passer
rating.
Finally,on the defensive end, while
neither team is consistently spectacu
lar on the stats sheet, both the TYojans
and Colts have athletes as clutch as
they come. Just recall Indianapolis'
game against the Cincinnati Bengals
(and USC's own Carson Palmer) in
Week 11 .and USC's close calls against
Notre Dame and Fresno State.
For both the undefeated Trojans
and Colts, the home stretch is here or
approaching. Southern Cal faces its
final regular season test against
UCLA this Saturday, while the Colts
have five games left to close out a po
tentially storybook season. The ath
letic efficiency and entertainment
value these teams bring to the field
during the football season make them
worth watching.

University's team over the past few
weeks, an even greater football story
lies with the most successful of teams
in the recent past — the Southern
California Trojans.
Now. 1 understand that each week
there seems to be at least one column
about the incredible feats accom
plished by the mighty men of Troy.
Even a casual browse through any
sports Web site or periodical presents
a take on the tremendous run. But
USC's unprecedented campaign for
three straight national titles justifies
the talk of history in the making.
But just watching a handful of
games in the Trojans' incredible 33-
game run inspires thoughts regarding
the similarities between the most suc
cessful team in college football and
the so-far undefeated Indianapolis
Colts of the NFL.
'ITie Trojans and the Colts are re
markably similar, not only in their
currently matching 11-0 records. With
a glance at the rosters and several in
cidents this season, the similarities are
striking.
That's not to say that the Trojans
could match up with the Colts. I'm
one of those people who would laugh
and casually dismiss the idea of
matching up the best college team
with even the worst NFL team. It
wouldn't even be close. However,
within their respective sports (if col
lege and professional football could
be considered different sports), these
two teams have been put together
and structured in similar ways, leav
ing them with personnel who able to
breed success.
First, a look at the offenses. Matt
Leinart and Peyton Manning are
both accurate, low-risk, prototypical
pocket passers, who rarely make mis
takes and routinely make good plays
great as they lead their respective of
fensive attacks. Physically they are
both 6-foot-5, with a weight differ
ence of only five pounds. Though
competition for the "guy-everyone
wants-to-be" never ceases, Leinart
and Manning currently serve as the
poster-children of the worlds of col
lege and professional football. And
they always remain calm, cool and
collected.
These two men exemplify the idea
of the team game and, for the most
part, sacrifice individual accolades.
These two teams found the right men
to take to the line.
In the passing game,quarterbacks
usually get most of the acclaim; only
in special situations do wide receivers
get nearly the same publicity. But this
is the case for these two teams.

advantage of having to continually
bring new players into the position


Samuel

The Eternal Optimist
due to graduation and attrition rates,
this year sophomore Dvvayne Jarrett
and junior Steve Smith are both spec
tacular receivers. With Marvin I larri
son and Reggie Wayne leading the
way for the Colts' receiving corps.
Manning hardly needs to worry about
mistakes on the receiving end of the
passes he makes. While naming only
the top two receivers for each team
does a disservice to all the talented
pass-catchers that both teams have, it
gives the utmost respect to these
teams' passing games — it also lends
credibility to claims that anyone on
the field eligible to catch the ball could
do so fora first down or touchdown
reception.
At running back, we find more of
the same.The Colts feature F.dgerrin
James, a 6-foot veteran tailback who
can run for power and has the speed
to move outside against the fast de
fensive backs that roam the NFL sec
ondaries. The Trojans feature the
highly-acclaimed (and rightly so) pair
of Reggie Bush (6-feet) and Lendale
White (6-foot-2).
While some say Bush is the quick
back and White the power back, I've
seen enough to say that the duo could
handle both duties if necessary.

The offensive lines have also fac
tored into the success both teams
have had.There is nothing worse than
a sack on third or fourth down late in
the game, but for these two teams,
blocking the pass-rush has been spec
tacular this season. In 11 games thus
far, Leinart has been sacked 13 times,
while Manning has been sacked only
nine times — the fewest among NFL
quarterbacks in the top 32 for passer
rating.
Finally,on the defensive end, while
neither team is consistently spectacu
lar on the stats sheet, both the TYojans
and Colts have athletes as clutch as
they come. Just recall Indianapolis'
game against the Cincinnati Bengals
(and USC's own Carson Palmer) in
Week 11 .and USC's close calls against
Notre Dame and Fresno State.
For both the undefeated Trojans
and Colts, the home stretch is here or
approaching. Southern Cal faces its
final regular season test against
UCLA this Saturday, while the Colts
have five games left to close out a po
tentially storybook season. The ath
letic efficiency and entertainment
value these teams bring to the field
during the football season make them
worth watching.
