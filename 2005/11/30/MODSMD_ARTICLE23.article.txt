ASU defeats Arizona in onlv other
Pac-10 plav this week
Arizona State earned a howl bid — one
that might not be far from its home — with
its 23-20 victory over Arizona. The game
kept fans on the edge of their seats in Tempe,
as the Sun Devils came from behind to notch
the go-ahead field goal with six seconds to
play.
Hie Sun Devils (6-5, 4-4 Pacific-10 Con
ference) were down 15 points in the Territo
rial Cup as the Wildcats led 20-5 in the third
quarter. However, ASU's Rudy Burgess'
seven-yard touchdown run sparked 18 unan
swered points. A 71-yard punt return by
Terry Richardson and a two-point conver
sion from quarterback Rudy Carpenter to
Zach Miller tied the match for Arizona
State, and Jesse Ainsworth's 20-yard field
goal was enough for the win.
Arizona quarterback Willie TUitama fin
ished with yards and one touchdown,
while senior Mike Bell ran for 117 yards on
27 carries on the day. Burgess finished with
130 total yards, and while Carpenter had no
touchdowns, he threw for 246 yards.
The Sun Devils could end up in the In
sight Bowl in Phoenix this postseason.
