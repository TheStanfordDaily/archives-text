## Top-ranked Trojans risk win streak 
### JOHN NADEL AP SPORTS WRITER 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Pete Carroll
would rather not discuss the Bowl Champi
onship Series and how it works. The South
ern California coach says he doesn't under
stand it and has no desire to learn what it's
all about.
"I do know this — if we win, we'll proba
bly be playing in the Rose Bowl," Carroll
said with a smile yesterday."The BCS peo
ple are probably pretty happy with the way
things are now."
Ihere's no need for Carroll to use the
word "probably" in either instance.
Should Carroll's Trojans beat crosstown
rival UCLA at the Los Angeles Coliseum on
Saturday, they'll definitely play in the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 4 fora shot at an unprecedent
ed third straight national championship.
With No. 1 USC( 11 -0.7-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) and No. 2 Texas (11-0,8-0 Big 12)
the only unbeaten Division 1 teams in the
country, the BCS folks have to be pleased
since there won't be anything controversial
about the national championship game.
That's assuming, of course, that the Tro
jans beat the No. 11 Bruins (9-1, 6-1) and
the Longhorns beat unranked Colorado (7-
4, 5-3) in the Big 12 championship game,
also on Saturday.
The BCS pairings are to be announced
Sunday.
"We feel very fortunate to be in this situ
ation at this time of year," Carroll said. "It's
a beautiful time to be coaching and playing
football.This is the situation we all hope for.
We all want to get in the Rose Bowl.lhe sit
uation this year is a little different."
Carroll referred to the fact that the Rose
Bowl is to host this season's national cham
pionship game, as the Orange Bowl did last
January. USC beat Oklahoma 55-19 in that
game.

Ilie Trojans bring several significant
streaks into Saturday's game: They've won
33 consecutive games overall, 26 in a row at
the Coliseum and 22 straight against Pac-10
opponents.
Perhaps the most cherished streak is the
shortest — USC has won six straight over
the Bruins and is a 21 -point favorite to make
it seven.
"The rivalry means a lot," said USC de
fensive end Frostee Rucker, a senior from
nearby Ilistin. "I've been watching it ever

since I can remember. 1 can't say I hate
them. I dislike them a lot. let's put it that way.
It feels good to know that since I've been in
school, we haven't lost to them."
Quarterback Matt Leinart, last year's
Heisman Trophy winner and a senior who
will be playing in his final regular-season
game, has a different take.
"It's not that I dislike them at all," he said.
"It's just a big rivalry game. I'm friends with
some of the guys on the team. There's no ha
tred between the schools, I don't think.

We've been doing well against them recent
ly. I know they want to win badly. So do we."
Reggie Bush, who appears to be the Heis
man favorite entering this weekend, said
every game is big as far as he's concerned, al
though the UCLA and Notre Dame games
are perhaps a cut above the rest.
"Records don't matter, nothing matters
when you take the field," he said. "All the
hype is going to be there. It's one of the
biggest rivalries in college football. This is
one of the biggest games of the season.

With No. 1 USC( 11 -0.7-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) and No. 2 Texas (11-0,8-0 Big 12)
the only unbeaten Division 1 teams in the
country, the BCS folks have to be pleased
since there won't be anything controversial
about the national championship game.
That's assuming, of course, that the Tro
jans beat the No. 11 Bruins (9-1, 6-1) and
the Longhorns beat unranked Colorado (7-
4, 5-3) in the Big 12 championship game,
also on Saturday.
The BCS pairings are to be announced
Sunday.
"We feel very fortunate to be in this situ
ation at this time of year," Carroll said. "It's
a beautiful time to be coaching and playing
football.This is the situation we all hope for.
We all want to get in the Rose Bowl.lhe sit
uation this year is a little different."
Carroll referred to the fact that the Rose
Bowl is to host this season's national cham
pionship game, as the Orange Bowl did last
January. USC beat Oklahoma 55-19 in that
game.

Ilie Trojans bring several significant
streaks into Saturday's game: They've won
33 consecutive games overall, 26 in a row at
the Coliseum and 22 straight against Pac-10
opponents.
Perhaps the most cherished streak is the
shortest — USC has won six straight over
the Bruins and is a 21 -point favorite to make
it seven.
"The rivalry means a lot," said USC de
fensive end Frostee Rucker, a senior from
nearby Ilistin. "I've been watching it ever

since I can remember. 1 can't say I hate
them. I dislike them a lot. let's put it that way.
It feels good to know that since I've been in
school, we haven't lost to them."
Quarterback Matt Leinart, last year's
Heisman Trophy winner and a senior who
will be playing in his final regular-season
game, has a different take.
"It's not that I dislike them at all," he said.
"It's just a big rivalry game. I'm friends with
some of the guys on the team. There's no ha
tred between the schools, I don't think.

We've been doing well against them recent
ly. I know they want to win badly. So do we."
Reggie Bush, who appears to be the Heis
man favorite entering this weekend, said
every game is big as far as he's concerned, al
though the UCLA and Notre Dame games
are perhaps a cut above the rest.
"Records don't matter, nothing matters
when you take the field," he said. "All the
hype is going to be there. It's one of the
biggest rivalries in college football. This is
one of the biggest games of the season.
