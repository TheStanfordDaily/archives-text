Jar-Jar Binks. Lisa Simpson. Meg Grif
fin. Screech. Yell leaders. I"hey are an
noying. They are unnecessary. They in
validate, infuriate and offend the very rea
son why you exist. They are the gnats on
your proverbial potato salad, the uncom
fortable shirt tag rubbing against your neck
and the festering wound that never seems
to cease oozing its infectious pus.
And they won't stop.
TTiey return, week after week in a seem
ing barrage of the senses. Lisa is too preten
tious, Meg too annoying. Screech too clum
sy, Jar-Jar too irritating and the yell leaders
too damn infuriating.
But this column isn't about Star Wars.
Saved by the Bell or animated Fox sitcoms.
It is about yell leaders.
In my time here, 1 have said many things.
I have said that the field hockey team
"dumped" me. 1 have said that Buddy
Teevens should stay. 1 have said that 1 am
more sexually desirable than the entire
men's water polo team.
You may not have listened then but hear
me now: The yell leaders should be dis
banded.
Thanks to their appalling performance
at last week's Big Game, they sounded the
death knell of their own organization and
have forced even the most casual observer
of Stanford athletics to stand up and shout
— not against the opponent — but against
the yell leaders themselves.
Case in point: with just minutes left in
our own Big Game blowout loss, the yell
leaders took up the microphone in front of
the student section to call out "Who
Sucks?" as they had time and time again
during the game, expecting a chorus of'Cal
Sucks." But friends, when you are down 27-
3 at home, in a stadium mostly filled with
your enemy, it's best just to keep your
mouth shut.
Instead of chanting "Cal Sucks" back to
the yell leaders, the Stanford student sec
tion pointed at the yell leaders, yelling,
"YOU SUCK!"
And it was not unwarranted.To highlight
the many errors in judgment during the
game (by the yell leaders, of course), I will
ask a series of questions to which there are
no possible apologies, explanations or an
swers.
Why did the yell leaders dress up in
Caveman costumes? Was this ever ex
plained? Was 1 supposed to laugh in merri
ment at the fact that fur adorned their an
kles? Was 1 to take heartily in jest the idea
that they were dressed up as stupid Nean
derthals — wait for it — in an environment
usually defined by — wait for it — higher
learning? Oh mirth and merriment. Oh rib
ald jocularity! What laughs! Huzzah!
Second question: Why does the yell
leader on the microphone lack so much
rhythm? Regardless of which caveman
held the microphone, it seemed like they
were doing a Dustin Hoffman impression
from "Rain Man."
But I have so many questions. Who
thought that giving out randomly colored
construction paper was funny? Why did we
need that many people on the track? Why
did we have so many ridiculous chants? Why
did the yell leaders continue to chant "block
that punt" well after a punt was away? Why
was such a mess made on the track?
But above all else, why did the yell lead
ers start a chant of "Let's Go Stanford"
when our OB and best player, Trent Ed
wards, was injured on the field, just having
sustained a game-ending injury?
You know, yell leaders, 1 have given you
the benefit of the doubt in the past. I know
you mean well. 1 know you have school spir
it. But as you have shown over the last few
years, you are unable to command the atten
tion or respect of the student fan base.There
just comes a time where you have to say
enough is enough and take the putrid, sickly
and dying dog out behind the toolshed.
The fact is, the antics performed by the
yell leaders have no place at a Stanford
football game. They distract the audience
from the game, they pollute the stands with
unwanted noise, and they generally aggra
vate the Stanford fan. Or simply, as one
Stanford supporter screamed. "Would you
all shut the hell up? I'm trying to watch a
football game here!"
Now it is true. I am no longer a student
here. 1 have moved on. Graduated. But
when I come back to see that my alma
mater is being desecrated in such a disturb
ing way. when I imagine what other schools
must imagine Stanford kids are like and
when I see our athletes being overshad
owed by the overall incompetence of our
student-fan supporters, I can't help but
take a stand.
So please, students, faculty and alumni,
do not allow this to goon any further. As we
all move into a new stadium, let's leave
some of the detritus back in the past and
create new traditions that will quickly erase
some of the horrors of my time here.
No more irritating chants. No more an
noying chatter. No more yell leaders.
"But Stanford students are so quirky!"
Yeah. well, so was Jar-Jar Binks and he
sucked.
