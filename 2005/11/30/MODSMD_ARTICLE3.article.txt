## Four Stanford students receive Marshall

SENIOR STAFF WRITER
In the spring of 2003, then-sen
ior Trevor Sutton had little room in
his imagination for Swiss banks,
money laundering and internation
al scandal. Instead, much of his
gray matter was focused on his his
tory thesis, which centered on
Gabriel Naude, a French man of
letters and librarian to Cardinals
Richelieu and Mazarin.
Yet a little more than a year later,
Sutton found himself a part of the
team investigating the UN oil-for
food scandal, flying between South
east Asia and Australia and Western
Europe to interview diplomats and
tease out the web of kickbacks and
corruption that allowed Saddam
Hussein and his cronies to steal hun
dreds of millions of dollars from the
program.
This experience helped Sutton

become one of Stanford's four Mar
shall Scholars this year. The others
are Rajaie Batniji, '03, a history
major now studying medicine at
UC-San Francisco; Mark Otut
eye,'os, an African and African-
American Studies major from Ana
heim, Calif.; and senior PhilipTane
do, a math and physics major. Only
Sutton and Batniji are featured
today; Otuteye and Tanedo will he
profiled later this week.
The Marshall Scholarship is one
of the world's most prestigious
scholarship programs, giving hon
orees the opportunity to study at any
U.K. institution for two years. Histo
ry has shown that Marshall Scholars
often go on to become leaders in
their fields.
Batniji, now a third-year med
ical student at UCSF, plans to en-
roll in a development studies or in
ternational relations program at
Oxford this fall. Whereas many see
the social sciences and medicine as
incompatible as oil and water, Bat
niji finds their intersection unique
ly compelling.
"I've been using this [history
background] to understand how the
broader historical context influ
ences health." he told The Daily. "As
medical students, you learn how
physicians treat different elements
of disease, but 1 hope to learn how
development prevents and allevi
ates" illness.
"A little bit of social instability
can just throw someone off into a
downward spiral," he added.
Batniji, who grew up in South
ern California but was born in the
Gaza Strip, came to this conclusion
while working at the World Health
Organization after his first year of
medical school.
"I was looking at literature on
mental and social health in con
flicts and disasters and trying to in

tegrate what social scientists had
written for the elucidation of possi
ble public health recommendations
that we would give," he said. "That
was an exercise in both learning the
utility of the social sciences in plan
ning for health and also trying to
get a feel for the methodology."
He draws parallels between the
kind of distress experienced by
refugees from civil wars or natural
disasters and that experienced by
the urban poor in the United States.
"Domestically, I'm interested in
working on poverty medicine," he
said. When someone with meager
means becomes ill,"they have their
social fabric disrupted," he added.
"Their daily life becomes challeng
ing in just moving around and get
ting things done."
For Sutton, his expertise in deci
phering money trails and laundering
techniques came as something of a
surprise, he said. After writing a tu
torial for NGOs on how to conduct
money trail research at his first job
out of college, with the Washington,
D.C.-based Coalition for Interna
tional Justice, the topic quickly be
came one of international concern
when the scandal at the United Na
tions' oil-for-food program became
apparent.

"It was an extremely complicat
ed program that essentially asked
the United Nations to completely
manage the economy of the world's
second-largest oil producer for
seven years," he said.
A sub-committee of the U.N. Se
curity Council, called the 661 Com
mittee, quickly became the focus of
the investigation.
"(The 661 Committee] was re
sponsible for the day-to-day admin
istration of the program," he said.
"My project was to look at all the
records of their meetings, which had
been secret, and then interview the
various diplomats and the people
that had interacted with those diplo
mats and ask what they knew, and if
they knew anything that suggested
that all might not be right with the
program. I interviewed officials,
company executives. 1 did a lot of
document review in foreign capitals.
I also did a lot of analysis with
money trails, Swiss banks, that kind
of thing."
Sutton, who was active with veter
ans' health issues and the research
journal Herodotus as an undergradu
ate, plans to study at Oxford with Pol
itics and International Relations Prof
Ngaire Woods, who started the Glob
al Economic Governance Program.
