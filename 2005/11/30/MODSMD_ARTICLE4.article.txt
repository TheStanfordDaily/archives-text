# Some hesitate to report assault
## Reported number of assaults per year higher than that of UC-Berkeley 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Unfortunately," lamented sophomore Amanda
Johnson. "We live in a society which says:'if you report
a sexual assault, you're uncool.'"
If Johnson's observation is correct, it may partially
explain why many Stanford students believe that far
more sexual assaults occur than are reported.
Carole Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion
Services at Vaden Health Center said that a "conflu
ence of many reasons" factor into the underreporting
of sexual assault, most often fear.
Freshman Ivan Lee said that "feelings of danger,
being threatened or embarrassed" are sure to be com
mon motivations to "keep quiet."
Pertofsky added "confusion, guilt and cynicism" as
contributing reasons for the underreporting of abuse.
In addition, definitions of sexual assault or harass
ment may differ from student to student, and some
times even the letter of the law cannot shed light on
these gray areas.
Meagan Christian, a prevention and information
specialist at the YWCA Rape Crisis Center said, "A lot
of people are confused and don't know if what hap
pened was rape or not."
"Most girls want attention from
guys," Johnson added. "What one.
girl might consider sex assault, an
other might find flirting or flef
tery."
But every year, there are skujt'r
tions that are clearly assault. ' y
"From the start of this year, Jan..
1. there have been 10 reports of sex
offenses," said Deputy Ken Bates
of the Stanford Department of
Public Safety, "and no reported
rapes."
By comparison, according to re
cent figures available from the UC-
Berkeley Police Department, for
the three years 1998 to 2000, there
was an average of nine sexual of
fenses per year.
Bates reported, "All in all, Stan
ford is a relatively safe campus."
While some students' turn to
legal options such as filing charges
with Bates, many others instead
seek solace in confidential out
reach groups on campus.
Organizations such as the re
cently opened YWCA Sexual As
sault Center are designed to pro
vide confidential support to victims
of sexual crimes.
According to David Rasch of
the University Ombuds Office, his
office sees "about a half dozen sex
ual assault cases" a year. The Om
buds Office is primarily a self-pro
claimed "impartial dispute re
solver," according to its Web site.
Rasch says the Ombuds Office is
"generally not the first step fora
victim of sexual assault or harass
ment." He concluded that if six or
so victims each year come to his
door, there must be many more
who instead find other means of
coping.
Several students agreed that
they feel reluctant to report in
stances of sexual assault. They "feel
embarrassed about telling their
story more than anything else,"
said Johnson.
"More often than not, these
crimes are committed by someone
the victim knows," Christian
added, explaining that victims are
often worried that, "word will get
out and everyone will know."
Due to privacy concerns, peer
counseling — with residential ad

visors (RAs) or peer health educa
tors (PHEs) — is confidential, but
only to an extent.
"As RAs, we are required to re
port any mention of sexual harass
ment to the Residential Deans,"
said junior Mary Kate Hanlon, an
RAin Branner.

Despite the myriad of re
sources available, ranging from
residential help to the YWCA and
campus police, only a fraction of
sexual abuse cases are reported, a
trend echoed by statistics at the
national level.
"1 think part of it is that [sexual

attacks] can be anonymous," said
freshman Diana Jaffe. "You could
report it and file charges but they
might not be able to catch the guy.
Maybe they can only shut down the
frat where it happened. Do you re
ally want to be responsible for
that?"
