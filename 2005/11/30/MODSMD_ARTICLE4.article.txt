# Some hesitate to report assault
## Reported number of assaults per year higher than that of UC-Berkeley 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Unfortunately," lamented sophomore Amanda
Johnson. "We live in a society which says:'if you report
a sexual assault, you're uncool.'"
If Johnson's observation is correct, it may partially
explain why many Stanford students believe that far
more sexual assaults occur than are reported.
Carole Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion
Services at Vaden Health Center said that a "conflu
ence of many reasons" factor into the underreporting
of sexual assault, most often fear.
Freshman Ivan Lee said that "feelings of danger,
being threatened or embarrassed" are sure to be com
mon motivations to "keep quiet."
Pertofsky added "confusion, guilt and cynicism" as
contributing reasons for the underreporting of abuse.
In addition, definitions of sexual assault or harass
ment may differ from student to student, and some
times even the letter of the law cannot shed light on
these gray areas.
Meagan Christian, a prevention and information
specialist at the YWCA Rape Crisis Center said, "A lot
of people are confused and don't know if what hap
pened was rape or not."
