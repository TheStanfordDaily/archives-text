# Old Union slated for shuffle
## Union to be center of student life on campus 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
In the next few weeks,as students finish fi
nals and campus closes. Old Union and the
surrounding buildings will undergo drastic
changes. Beginning mid-December, offices in
Old Union will shut down and vacate, usher
ing in a series of moves that aim to establish
a new and improved center of campus.
According to Dean of Student Affairs,
Greg Boardman, over the past few years,
many students and faculty have felt the need
fora more centralized space for student
groups and activities.
"Beginning early in 2(X)2, a task force of
students, staff, and faculty developed a master
plan for spaces that support a variety of stu
dent activities," Boardman told the Daily.
"The plan recommended that Old Union be
returned to its historic student focus, and that
the campus center area, including White
Plaza and the surrounding buildings, be re-in
vigorated as a focus of student and Stanford
community life."
The plan involves reorganizing IVessider
Union, Old Union, the Clubhouse and the
Nitery. The Asian American Activities Cen
ter. Eil Centro Chicano, and the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center will move to temporary
locations during Winter Break. The Office of
Religious Life, previously located in the
Clubhouse, have temporarily moved to
Building 60. In addition,current administra
tive offices in the main Old Union building
will move to temporary locations until more
permanent space becomes available.
Many students are not aware of these
changes, and even fewer know exactly what
these changes entail. Omar Shakir, ASSU
Executive Cabinet Director of Student
Space and president of the Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN) has discussed
the layout of the new complex with the ad
ministrators and workers in charge of the
renovation.
"When Old Union reopens, there will be
many new lounge areas, couches, big screen
TVs. and possibly even a late-night restau
rant," Shakir said in an interview with the
Daily. "Although some of the specifics have
yet to be determined, the main idea is refocus
on meeting rooms and lounge type areas for
students to come together, hang out, or study
in groups, something that is currently lacking
on campus. This new complex will become a
real student union and 1 think students will
love it.

Old Union is scheduled to be renovated beginning mid-December. Currently housed offices will vacate and
move to temporary locations throughout campus.
Students will also see changes in
other areas. According to Scotty
McLennan, the Dean for Religious
Life, The Office for Religious Life
(ORL) oversees and supports more
than 30 student religious organiza
tions on campus. Many of these or
ganizations, along with the ORL, are
being relocated to Old Union. This
new space will enable these groups to
have both a common library and
seminar room - rooms that were not
available in the previous location.
"We are calling the entire space
the Stanford Interfaith Center,"
McLennan said. "It is an exciting,
once-in-a-lifetime chance to con
ceive and develop an environment
that will allow students from many
different religious groups to interact
and rub elbows on the same floor â€”
learning about each other, promot

ing interreligious understanding,
and helping develop truly global cit
izens for the 21st century.
In addition, ASSU offices and the
Office of Student Activities will
move from Tressider to the second
floor of Old Union. This area will
provide more space for group meet
ing rooms, which are currently hard
to find at Tressider.
Although there is a feeling of
overall enthusiasm from students
for this new student union, some stu
dent groups have raised some con
cerns.
"There have been concerns from
student groups regarding how their
new space will compare to their old
homes in terms of size and storage
possibilities," ASSU President
Melanie Kannokada told the Daily.
"The managers of this renovation
project have assured that the new
space of these groups will be equal
or greater to what they currently
have in either quality or size. The
ASSU continues to stress that every
affected party is consulted regarding

the space decisions being made."
The renovations are expected to
be complete next September. De
spite any uncertainty and concerns
during this interim period, those in
volved with the planning remain op
timistic about the overall benefits
the modifications will bring to the
student body.
"While the construction phase
may prompt some struggles in the
short term, the net gain of these ren
ovations is quite large and extreme
ly worthwhile for students. These
changes can bring substantial bene
fits to Stanford's campus," Kan
nokada said. "First of all, the con
cept of having a hub of student life in
the center of campus will provide
more students from other parts of
campus a venue to meet and relax
somewhere in the middle. In addi
tion, students will have more op
tions and access to space available
for conducting meetings for their
student groups, host speakers, give
performances, and hold other
events."
