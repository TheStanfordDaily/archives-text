# Old Union slated for shuffle
## Union to be center of student life on campus 
### MANDY KOVACH STAFF WRITER 
In the next few weeks,as students finish fi
nals and campus closes. Old Union and the
surrounding buildings will undergo drastic
changes. Beginning mid-December, offices in
Old Union will shut down and vacate, usher
ing in a series of moves that aim to establish
a new and improved center of campus.
According to Dean of Student Affairs,
Greg Boardman, over the past few years,
many students and faculty have felt the need
fora more centralized space for student
groups and activities.
"Beginning early in 2(X)2, a task force of
students, staff, and faculty developed a master
plan for spaces that support a variety of stu
dent activities," Boardman told the Daily.
"The plan recommended that Old Union be
returned to its historic student focus, and that
the campus center area, including White
Plaza and the surrounding buildings, be re-in
vigorated as a focus of student and Stanford
community life."
The plan involves reorganizing IVessider
Union, Old Union, the Clubhouse and the
Nitery. The Asian American Activities Cen
ter. Eil Centro Chicano, and the Native Amer
ican Cultural Center will move to temporary
locations during Winter Break. The Office of
Religious Life, previously located in the
Clubhouse, have temporarily moved to
Building 60. In addition,current administra
tive offices in the main Old Union building
will move to temporary locations until more
permanent space becomes available.
Many students are not aware of these
changes, and even fewer know exactly what
these changes entail. Omar Shakir, ASSU
Executive Cabinet Director of Student
Space and president of the Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN) has discussed
the layout of the new complex with the ad
ministrators and workers in charge of the
renovation.
"When Old Union reopens, there will be
many new lounge areas, couches, big screen
TVs. and possibly even a late-night restau
rant," Shakir said in an interview with the
Daily. "Although some of the specifics have
yet to be determined, the main idea is refocus
on meeting rooms and lounge type areas for
students to come together, hang out, or study
in groups, something that is currently lacking
on campus. This new complex will become a
real student union and 1 think students will
love it.
