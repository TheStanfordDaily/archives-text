## 
### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
Apple promotions, chcerleading
funding and possible dining hall
time changes were several issues
discussed last night, as the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate reconvened
following Thanksgiving break.
The Senate is evaluating student
feedback concerning space on cam
pus and the plans to renovate both
TYesidder Union and Old Union.
Additionally, the ASSU executives
have begun work on centralizing
the process to apply for room reser
vations for student groups.
The Senate also discussed the
possibility of altering hours of nor
mal operation for dining facilities.
Because of students' changing sleep
schedules from high school to col
lege, many often skip breakfast and
prefer to snack later at night.
Since early dinners lead to late
night snacking. the Senate is look
ing into extending dinner hours as
well as healthier late-night eating
options.
"They're evaluating it in a very
low-risk pattern," said ASSU Presi
dent Mclanie Kannokada. a senior,
explaining how dining services will
experiment with time changes at
Stanford's smaller dining halls be

fore making decisions on applying
the times campus-wide.
Later in the meeting. Appropria
tions Chair Faris Mohiuddin, a jun
ior, commented on the budget for
student groups.
"As opposed to being so strin
gent that we develop a surplus each
year, or so generous that we go into
deficit each year, we want to come
out with a reasonable sum at the
end," he said. "'lTiat is our goal for
the quarter."
lire Senate also made note of a
joint venture with Apple. In light of
the current promotion with Stan
ford, Apple will donate 6 percent of
all proceeds to the University, of
which the ASSU Senate has chosen
to give KM) percent to Hurricane
Katrina victims. This furthers
Apple's relationship with Stanford,
the first University to partner with
illines.
"The Apple music program is
doing their push, so you'll be seeing
lots and lots of flyers on campus
about it," according to Communica
tions Chair Rong Xu, a junior.
During the past few meetings,
the Senate has also debated the
possibility of allowing senators to
eo abroad during their terms.

ASSU senators voted on several issues at Tuesday night's meeting.
"In order to create a leave of ab
sence program for senators would
require an amendment to the
ASSU Constitution, and thus
would also require the undergradu
ate population at large to vote on
the matter in the spring general
election," wrote Deputy Chair
Danny Arbeiter, a sophomore, in an
e-mail to The Daily. "Over the past

couple weeks the Senate discussed
possible ways through which a
leave of absence program might be
implemented, although when voted
upon tonight, the Senate decided
not to place the matter on the gen
eral election ballot at this time.
There is always the chance the issue
will be revisited in the future, how
ever."
Of the student groups that re
ceived funding, Cardinal Competi
tive Cheer — in its fourth year of
existence — received $3,000 from
the Senate, which will be used pri
marily for safety items. The group

has received $6,000 in previous
years, but the ASSU said that this
sum was unreasonable given the
current budget.The Senate has also
approached the Department of
Athletics to increase funding and
resources for the group, such as ac
cess to coaches and facilities within
the department.
Funding was also granted to the
Hindi Film Dance Team, Cardinal
Calypso, Redwood Outdoor Club,
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Asia-
Pacific Student Entrepreneur Sum
mit and Preventative Women's
Health and Human Rights.
