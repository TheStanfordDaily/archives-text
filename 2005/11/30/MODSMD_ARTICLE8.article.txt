## Panda cub warmly received in D.C. 
### JACOB ADELMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON—Tai Shan, the
giant panda cub, showed Ttiesday that
he is a quick study, prancing about in
his den and otherwise mugging for
hordes of camera crews in this city
that's a veritable fishbowl for celebri
ties.
More than 1(X) reporters and cam
era crews from around the world got
their first look at the fuzzy creature as
they filed past his indoor enclosure in
five different shifts. And the 4 1/2-

month-old cub did not disappoint.
He chased his zoo keeper around, try
ing to nibble at the hems of her jeans. He
pulled himself over the ledge of the habi
tat's rocky centerpiece. He tumbled onto
his back, and he gummed at the bamboo
stalks that will someday form his diet.
Cameras snapped wildly every time
he did something especially cute.
"He's just a fantastic little bear,"
said Lisa Stevens, the zoo's assistant cu
rator for pandas. "He's climbing all
over his cage."
The news preview followed special
viewing sessions for members of the

zoo's support organization. Friends of
the National Zoo, and other financial
backers.
The cub gets his first visitors from
the general public Dec. 8, when those
who nabbed tickets during the zoo's
online ticket giveaway are permitted in
the panda house. Those 13,000 tickets
were exhausted about two hours after
they became available last week.
Zoo officials announced that peo
ple could only use the tickets that they
can prove they reserved themselves
after the tickets started showing up on
eßay for hundreds of dollars apiece.
