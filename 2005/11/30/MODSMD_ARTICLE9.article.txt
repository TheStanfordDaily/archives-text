BAGHDAD, Iraq — Photos broadcast TUesday
showed a blihdfolded German woman being led
away by armed captors in the latest kidnapping of a
Westerner in Iraq. Six Iranian pilgrims, meanwhile,
were abducted by gunmen north of Baghdad.
The aid group Christian Peacemaker Teams con
firmed that four people from the group had been
taken hostage Saturday and that Norman Kember, a
74-year-old Briton, was among them. The U.S. Em
bassy has confirmed an American is missing in Iraq.
Also TUesday, two US. soldiers assigned to Task
Force Baghdad were killed when their patrol was hit
by a roadside bomb north of the capital, the U.S. com
mand said.
A suicide car bomber killed eight Iraqi soldiers
and wounding five more when he drove into an army
patrol TUesday in Tarmiyah, 30 miles north of Bagh
dad, police Lt. Ali Hussein said. A U.S. Army medical
helicopter helped evacuate the wounded, he added.
Insurgents fired six mortars at Camp Falcon, a
U.S. base on the southern edge of Baghdad, police
and witnesses said, but there were no immediate re
ports of casualties. U.S. troops and Iraqi police shut
down the Baghdad's main highway heading south to
try to capture those responsible, police Capt. Taleb
Thamer said.
Iraq was rocked by a wave of foreigner kidnap
pings and beheadings in 2(X)4 and early 2005, but they
have dropped off in recent months as many Western
groups have left and security precautions for those
who remain have tightened. Insurgents, including al-
Qaida in Iraq, seized more than 225 people, killing at
least 38.
The pictures of Susanne Osthoff were taken from
a video in which her captors demanded that Ger
many stop any dealings with Iraq's government, ac
cording to Germany's ARD television. Germany has
ruled out sending troops to Iraq and opposed the
U.S.-led war.
Osthoff and her driver have been missing since
Friday and "according to current information, we
have to assume it is a kidnapping." German Chancel
lor Angela Merkel said in Berlin.

Osthoff, 43, is a fluent Arab speaker and a trained
archaeologist who has worked since 1998 for the Mu
nich-based management consulting firm FaktorM,
which said on its Web site that she has "organized and
supported the distribution of aid goods in Iraq since
1991." She was in Iraq working to help German or
ganizations distribute medicine and medical supplies.
"One can only hope and keep their fingers
crossed and remain optimistic" her mother, Ingrid
Hala, told Germany N24 news station.
Hala said she had not heard from her daughter for
about five years, and her uncle, Peter Osthoff, said his
niece had broken almost all ties with her family, in
cluding a daughter who will be 12 in December.
"She has almost no contact with any relatives," he
told The Associated Press.
Germany's Central Council of Muslims called for
Osthoffs immediate release. Christian Peacemaker
Teams said it has had representatives in Iraq since
October 2(K)2, working with U.S. and Iraqi detainees
and training others in nonviolent intervention and
human rights documentation. Kember and another
person were part of a visiting delegation, while two of
the group's staff based in Iraq also were taken, the
statement said.
The group said it would not identify the other
three people taken hostage. It stressed that it worked
on behalf of Iraqi civilians.
"The team's work has focused on documenting
and focusing public attention on detainee abuses,
connecting citizens of Iraq to local and international
human rights organizations, and accompanying Iraqi
civilians as they interact with multinational military
personnel and Iraq's government officials," the
group said.
The statement said those taken hostage knew the
risks when they went to Iraq.
The organization said it "does not advocate the
use of violent force to save our lives should we be kid
napped, held hostage, or caught in the middle of a
conflict situation."
On Monday, Deputy Interior Minister Hussein
Kamal said authorities had no leads. No group has
claimed responsibility and details of the apparent
kidnapping were unclear.
On Sunday, a Canadian official said two Canadi
ans were in the group. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Elizabeth Colton said only that an American had
been reported missing, and the person's name and
organization were being withheld.Britain has said
Kember, a retired professor, vanished in Iraq.

ports of casualties. U.S. troops and Iraqi police shut
down the Baghdad's main highway heading south to
try to capture those responsible, police Capt. Taleb
Thamer said.
Iraq was rocked by a wave of foreigner kidnap
pings and beheadings in 2(X)4 and early 2005, but they
have dropped off in recent months as many Western
groups have left and security precautions for those
who remain have tightened. Insurgents, including al-
Qaida in Iraq, seized more than 225 people, killing at
least 38.
The pictures of Susanne Osthoff were taken from
a video in which her captors demanded that Ger
many stop any dealings with Iraq's government, ac
cording to Germany's ARD television. Germany has
ruled out sending troops to Iraq and opposed the
U.S.-led war.
Osthoff and her driver have been missing since
Friday and "according to current information, we
have to assume it is a kidnapping." German Chancel
lor Angela Merkel said in Berlin.

Osthoff, 43, is a fluent Arab speaker and a trained
archaeologist who has worked since 1998 for the Mu
nich-based management consulting firm FaktorM,
which said on its Web site that she has "organized and
supported the distribution of aid goods in Iraq since
1991." She was in Iraq working to help German or
ganizations distribute medicine and medical supplies.
"One can only hope and keep their fingers
crossed and remain optimistic" her mother, Ingrid
Hala, told Germany N24 news station.
Hala said she had not heard from her daughter for
about five years, and her uncle, Peter Osthoff, said his
niece had broken almost all ties with her family, in
cluding a daughter who will be 12 in December.
"She has almost no contact with any relatives," he
told The Associated Press.
Germany's Central Council of Muslims called for
Osthoffs immediate release. Christian Peacemaker
Teams said it has had representatives in Iraq since
October 2(K)2, working with U.S. and Iraqi detainees
and training others in nonviolent intervention and
human rights documentation. Kember and another
person were part of a visiting delegation, while two of
the group's staff based in Iraq also were taken, the
statement said.
The group said it would not identify the other
three people taken hostage. It stressed that it worked
on behalf of Iraqi civilians.
"The team's work has focused on documenting
and focusing public attention on detainee abuses,
connecting citizens of Iraq to local and international
human rights organizations, and accompanying Iraqi
civilians as they interact with multinational military
personnel and Iraq's government officials," the
group said.
The statement said those taken hostage knew the
risks when they went to Iraq.
The organization said it "does not advocate the
use of violent force to save our lives should we be kid
napped, held hostage, or caught in the middle of a
conflict situation."
On Monday, Deputy Interior Minister Hussein
Kamal said authorities had no leads. No group has
claimed responsibility and details of the apparent
kidnapping were unclear.
On Sunday, a Canadian official said two Canadi
ans were in the group. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Elizabeth Colton said only that an American had
been reported missing, and the person's name and
organization were being withheld.Britain has said
Kember, a retired professor, vanished in Iraq.
