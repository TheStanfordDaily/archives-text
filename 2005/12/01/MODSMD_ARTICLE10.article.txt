## Rain, rain (and finals) go away 
### 
This is the one week of the quarter
when everyone is thinking the
same thing: "Shit, now why didn't
I start that earlier?" Freshmen are kick
ing themselves for falling so far behind
in IHUM reading and sophomores are
hating their science cores, while seniors
sweat over graduate school applications
due in a matter of days. I'm not sure
what the juniors are doing — probably
being thankful to be done with cores
and not yet applying to jobs or grad
schools.
Whether it's the question "Who am I
and what do I want to do with my life?"
or "What's the topic of my final project
that's due Monday?" that's keeping you
up all night, chances are you are feeling
pretty stressed and moody. Even the
weather seems to have turned against
us. As if we weren't miserable enough, it
has to rain. Nothing sucks more than
riding on a wet bike seat except riding
on a wet bike seat to the library.
I hate to say it, but these last few
weeks of fall quarter are really just a
preview of what's to come after won
derful winter vacation — winter quar
ter. Winter quarter is always the most
miserable quarter of the year. You did
n't just start school, you aren't about to
finish school, and it just won't fucking
stop raining.
One popular solution to the winter
quarter blues is to go abroad. It's still 80
degrees in Santiago. Last year I filed for
a leave of absence and skipped off to a
tropical island for the winter. This year
I'm not so lucky — I am stuck here, as
are most of you. It's going to be
wet...and depressing. So what can be
done to make the winter a little less mis
erable?
Some people choose to find a cuddle
buddy with whom they can keep warm.
Couples mysteriously hibernate during
the winter. I like to tell myself that they
died of frostbite, but the more likely sce
nario is that they are inside spooning.
My personal favorite solution, be
sides running away to a tropical para
dise, is to meet up with friends to com
miserate over coffee, hot chocolate or
tea. Misery loves company — it's the
truth. And if there's one thing we have
at our disposal in yuppie-dominated
Palo Alto, it's coffee and teahouses.
If you find yourself feeling particu
larly down, not just in the shitty
midterm grade way, you should defi
nitely discuss it with someone you trust.
It's common to have mood variations
and feel unhappy when something neg
ative occurs. However, if your "bad
mood" begins to affect day-to-day
functioning or you feel yourself losing
interest in activities, there is definitely
cause for concern.Talk to your RA or a
close friend or a family member about
how you feel. If you'd rather handle it
on your own, you can pick up some
reading material at Vaden and schedule
a chat with a trained counselor.
Whatever you do, don't just keep it
to yourself. Plenty of people at Stanford
suffer from depression, especially dur
ing winter quarter.

If you 're feeling down and out, you don 't
have to be alone. You could be with Natal
