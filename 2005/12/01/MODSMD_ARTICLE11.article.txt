In addition to
today's AIDS
observance event,
get informed about
treatment research.

The AIDS epidemic though relatively under
control in the comfy confines of the U.S., is
growing every day abroad. It is an issue that's
being addressed in a number of ways through
out the world. Highlighting this battle, today
has been declared World AIDS Day, and Stanford's Of
fice of Religious life will hold an observance and remem
brance service in Memorial Church at 12 p.m. to mark
the occasion. Although AIDS continues to pose an ex
treme threat to international health, events like today's
temporarily spotlight and raise questions about recent
developments, stereotypes about the issue, treatment
options and cures.
Associate Dean for Religious Life Joanne Sanders de
scribes the significance of the HIV/AIDS crisis and says,
"It is extremely important for us to not forget how many
lives are affected, and not only in this country."
She describes in particular the crisis in Africa, where
"entire villages are being wiped out" by the disease.
In 2(X)5, more than 40 million people are living with
HIV and about 3 million have already died from AIDS,
according to the World Health Organization.
While today's event will raise awareness about
HIV/AIDS within the Stanford community, students,
faculty and staff from the Farm have plans to participate
in other very public events, such as the annual AIDS
bike ride.
The ride to take place June 4 to 10.2006, is organized

by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the L.A. Gay
and Lesbian Center.
"I'm preparing to do it myself," Sanders says.
The ride is a great cause, as it "raises enormous amounts
of money for funding [AIDS] research," she continues.
Mark Holodniy, professor of medicine at the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Health Care System, says that one type
of AIDS treatment that's being tested in clinical trials is
the Chemokine,CC Motif, Receptor 5 (CCRS) Inhibitor.
"It works by blocking a particular receptor in a cell
from the virus," Holodniy says.
This is different from traditional treatments that only
work once the virus has already entered the cell, he ex
plains. The CCRS Inhibitor is a preventative measure that
prohibits the virus from ever entering a healthy cell.
Although one pharmaceutical company has given up
on the CCRS inhibitor because it has led to the develop
ment of toxicity in some patients, "other companies arc
still pursuing it," Holodniy tells The Daily.
Another treatment that's being developed uses inte
gration inhibitors. He explains that "this treatment works
once the virus has already entered the cell by blocking the
virus from integrating into [cell components]."
According to Holodniy, this treatment is in initial phas
es of development and therefore, "it is not clear when it
may be approved."
Fundraising efforts may not always impact AIDS re
search or development of treatments, but Holodniy em
phasizes that events like World AIDS Day attract atten
tion to the disease and the issues surrounding it.
It will take a lot of work to combat the "sense of com
placency concerning AIDS in the United States, where
the level of infection is not growing by leaps and bounds,"
Holodniy says.
He continues,"People recognize that this is a pretty big
problem — but an 'African' problem."
The problem persists in developing areas and "causes
a lot of grief in some third-world nations because of the

lack of prevention policies and initiatives, such as condom
use and the empowering of women to make decisions"
Holodniy says.
The United States' global initiatives in fighting AIDS
mainly consist of providing HIV drugs to poorer nations
rather than prevention.
Holodniy suggests a variety of alternative methods to
dampen the global AIDS crisis.
For one, he says that the world needs "smart people to
think about creative ways to cure and control the infec
tion."
In addition, he underscores the importance of private
and public partnerships.
"It costs from $500 million to $ 1 billion to bring a drug
from development to the market," he says. These costs
should be shared.
Finally, Holodniy stresses the significance of support
ing infrastructure in developing nations where the AIDS
crisis is great.
'The United States has demonstrated how effective
treatments can be," Holodniy says.
But these treatments cannot be extremely effective
without the proper infrastructure to support them, such as
proficient clinics, political will and effective training pro
grams for doctors and prevention counselors. Once these
are in place "then the drugs can have an impact," Holod
niy hypothesizes.
In the meantime, the public can help by raising money
specifically for AIDS research and educating people in
their communities about the virus.
Here at Stanford, attending the World AIDS Day
Observance and Remembrance Service is a good way
to start.
