# New hormone could be key for treating obesity
## 
### SILVIA SANCHEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With increasing awareness of Americans'
obesity, researchers have been working to dis
cover new ways to treat the condition. Re
cently, Obstetrics and Gynecology Prof.
Aaron Hsueh and his team of researchers dis
covered the hormone obestatin, which may
help to provide some answers to this growing
problem.
On Nov. 11, the journal Science published
the research on obestatin conducted by Jian
V. Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow in obstetrics
and gynecology who works in Hsueh's labo
ratory. Zhang is the lead author of the paper,
and Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical
Research and Development, LLC, sponsored
the research.
According to Hsueh, the discovery of the
appetite-inducing hormone ghrelin in 1999
gave researchers hope that they had found a
way to successfully fight obesity. But after
many tests, the removal of the hormone failed

to provide the weight-loss response re
searchers were hoping for.
Obestatin is part of a category of hormones
that consists of small protein molecules
named peptide hormones, says a Stanford
News Service article published Nov. 11 .These
hormones provide easy targets for the drug
developers because they are easily bound to
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
GPCRs "represent targets for almost 50
percent of the drugs in the market," Hsueh
told the Stanford News Service.
One particular tool that helped Hsueh
and his team of researchers isolate obestatin
were data collected from the Human
Genome Project, an initiative that — among
other goals — aimed to identify as many
genes in human DNA as possible and store
them in a database. The project was complet
ed in 2003,
Hsueh's team analyzed some of the gene
sequences in the database and found that hu
mans and fish have a common ancestor that
had a gene to control hunger. This ancestor's

gene caused it to feel hunger no matter how
much it ate.
As an example of this characteristic,
Hsueh says. "You can feed goldfish to death,
and they'll keep eating and never feel full."
As organisms evolved from this common
ancestor, they became more capable of decid
ing whether or not to eat. according to Hsueh.
Eventually, they could feel full when they'd
eaten enough.
While they were comparing the ances
tor's gene sequences with those of other
species. Hsueh and his team located
obestatin. According to Zhang, the hormone
was discovered mainly because it was a gene
that was "preserved" through the evolution
of this ancestor.
Hsueh says the most surprising finding is
that obestatin — which suppresses hunger —
was found in the same gene that holds ghrelin,
a substance traditionally thought to help con
trol body weight. The discovery of two hor
mones on one gene sequence is an incredibly
rare occurrence, Hsueh says. The fact that this

particular sequence holds both ghrelin and
obestatin, two opposing hormones, is in fact
remarkable.
The two hormones work together to con
trol appetite, according to the Stanford News
Service. As an organism eats, ghrelin informs
the body that it needs food, whereas obestatin
quells hunger when the body is full. Removal
of the gene would eliminate both hormones
as well as their effects.
"When we inject obestatin into a ventricle,
we can see the effect almost immediately,"
Hsueh explains. "It decreases food intake.
The command for this action might come
from the brain, or it could be produced local
ly, we don't know. However, when we inject it
into the whole animal, we see a decrease in
food intake. When we take the small intestine
out and look at [its] spontaneous contrac
tions, you can add obestatin. When the intes
tine does not contract, the food will not move
down.Therefore,you feel full already because
[the foodj stays right there."
Zhang adds that obestatin seems like it

could he an effective cure for obesity because
when it was injected into mice, they found
"that the peptide decreased the body weight
of the mice by 10 to 20 percent after long term
injections."
And Hsueh says that "there are more than
a dozen hormones regulating the overall
process of eating. The discovery of obestatin
is part of a bigger puzzle, especially for (those
with] extreme obese situations. I think psy
chology is a major influencer in this and the
discovery of obestatin is not going to solve
those psychological issues."
Zhang says she agrees that "lots of things
can affect appetite. A sad mood can affect
appetite. We have to test whether it really is
the peptide and not some other influencing
factor. We have to further test these possi
bilities."
According to Zhang, the team is working
on a treatment for obesity. Hopefully
obestatin can help in the development of
drugs that will one day reduce unhealthy
cases of obesitv across the countrv.

rare occurrence, Hsueh says. The fact that this

particular sequence holds both ghrelin and
obestatin, two opposing hormones, is in fact
remarkable.
The two hormones work together to con
trol appetite, according to the Stanford News
Service. As an organism eats, ghrelin informs
the body that it needs food, whereas obestatin
quells hunger when the body is full. Removal
of the gene would eliminate both hormones
as well as their effects.
"When we inject obestatin into a ventricle,
we can see the effect almost immediately,"
Hsueh explains. "It decreases food intake.
The command for this action might come
from the brain, or it could be produced local
ly, we don't know. However, when we inject it
into the whole animal, we see a decrease in
food intake. When we take the small intestine
out and look at [its] spontaneous contrac
tions, you can add obestatin. When the intes
tine does not contract, the food will not move
down.Therefore,you feel full already because
[the foodj stays right there."
Zhang adds that obestatin seems like it

could he an effective cure for obesity because
when it was injected into mice, they found
"that the peptide decreased the body weight
of the mice by 10 to 20 percent after long term
injections."
And Hsueh says that "there are more than
a dozen hormones regulating the overall
process of eating. The discovery of obestatin
is part of a bigger puzzle, especially for (those
with] extreme obese situations. I think psy
chology is a major influencer in this and the
discovery of obestatin is not going to solve
those psychological issues."
Zhang says she agrees that "lots of things
can affect appetite. A sad mood can affect
appetite. We have to test whether it really is
the peptide and not some other influencing
factor. We have to further test these possi
bilities."
According to Zhang, the team is working
on a treatment for obesity. Hopefully
obestatin can help in the development of
drugs that will one day reduce unhealthy
cases of obesitv across the countrv.
With increasing awareness of Americans'
obesity, researchers have been working to dis
cover new ways to treat the condition. Re
cently, Obstetrics and Gynecology Prof.
Aaron Hsueh and his team of researchers dis
covered the hormone obestatin, which may
help to provide some answers to this growing
problem.
On Nov. 11, the journal Science published
the research on obestatin conducted by Jian
V. Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow in obstetrics
and gynecology who works in Hsueh's labo
ratory. Zhang is the lead author of the paper,
and Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical
Research and Development, LLC, sponsored
the research.
According to Hsueh, the discovery of the
appetite-inducing hormone ghrelin in 1999
gave researchers hope that they had found a
way to successfully fight obesity. But after
many tests, the removal of the hormone failed

to provide the weight-loss response re
searchers were hoping for.
Obestatin is part of a category of hormones
that consists of small protein molecules
named peptide hormones, says a Stanford
News Service article published Nov. 11 .These
hormones provide easy targets for the drug
developers because they are easily bound to
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
GPCRs "represent targets for almost 50
percent of the drugs in the market," Hsueh
told the Stanford News Service.
One particular tool that helped Hsueh
and his team of researchers isolate obestatin
were data collected from the Human
Genome Project, an initiative that — among
other goals — aimed to identify as many
genes in human DNA as possible and store
them in a database. The project was complet
ed in 2003,
Hsueh's team analyzed some of the gene
sequences in the database and found that hu
mans and fish have a common ancestor that
had a gene to control hunger. This ancestor's

gene caused it to feel hunger no matter how
much it ate.
As an example of this characteristic,
Hsueh says. "You can feed goldfish to death,
and they'll keep eating and never feel full."
As organisms evolved from this common
ancestor, they became more capable of decid
ing whether or not to eat. according to Hsueh.
Eventually, they could feel full when they'd
eaten enough.
While they were comparing the ances
tor's gene sequences with those of other
species. Hsueh and his team located
obestatin. According to Zhang, the hormone
was discovered mainly because it was a gene
that was "preserved" through the evolution
of this ancestor.
Hsueh says the most surprising finding is
that obestatin — which suppresses hunger —
was found in the same gene that holds ghrelin,
a substance traditionally thought to help con
trol body weight. The discovery of two hor
mones on one gene sequence is an incredibly
