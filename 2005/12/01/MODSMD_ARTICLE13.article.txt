## Editorial Stadium plans should consider tickets and zeal 
### 
The bulldozers were ready to roll in im
mediately after the Notre Dame
game on Saturday, and the ground
breaking for the new Stanford Stadium has
not been ceremonial. Some may interpret
this haste as unseemly in the demolition of
a piece of Stanford history, and Stanford
alums who have witnessed glorious victo
ries will probably feel this loss particularly
keenly. Yet progress is clearly being made
on this building project, and we applaud the
University for starting the process right on
schedule. This accelerated construction
plan is promising; before anyone on campus
realizes, the new stadium will probably be
up and ready.
The University's plans for the new stadi
um are still being hammered out. plans that
will shape the football experience for fans
for generations to come. Accordingly, we'd
like to take this opportunity to provide some
input from a student perspective.
First, we thank the University for asking
for fan input. A survey was sent out to some
All-Axess members, asking them to com
ment on what they like and dislike about the
current stadium. While we know that student
input is probably not the most important fac
tor in the planning process, it's a great sign
that the University is asking for such input
even in a project as condensed as this stadi
um construction.
Whenever one destroys a landmark that
has outlasted many of those who played in it,
there is bound to be some grumbling. But we
have heard little of it. A more intimate stadi
um, a better noise profile and seatbacks are
all welcome improvements. The main con
cerns that have been expressed regard po
tential increases in ticket prices and the dan
ger that Stanford football could become too
exclusive — especially if the team starts win
ning more often.
Tickets
From a student perspective, ticket prices
are a huge concern. The administration de
serves thanks for not raising student prices
over the past four years. Unlike tuition, stu
dent tickets are clearly not seen as a primary
source of revenue. While we trust that this
trend of maintaining student ticket prices
will continue, we would like to emphasize
that even $40 — the current price of a stu
dent season ticket — seems high to manv

students — especially those who only attend
Big Game.
The University, therefore, should ab
solutely not increase ticket prices for stu
dents due to the fewer number of seats in the
new stadium. Supply-and-demand consider
ations should not even be involved when
pricing student tickets, because we expect
the administration will offer unlimited tick
ets to students.
Finally, the administration should work
hard to keep young alumni connected to the
football program. Men's basketball has
taken a great step in this direction by releas
ing heavily-discounted tickets to alumni of
the Sixth Man Club. The football program
should consider comparable actions — per
haps by holding a certain number of Big
Game tickets for young alumni and by simi
larly offering tickets to this group at a rate
that is discounted from the prices which we
anticipate will be inflated next year.
Enthusiasm
We are not just concerned with money. In
fact, some of the most promising improve
ments to the Stadium don't involve money at
all. Instead, they deal with enthusiasm and
noise.
The new stadium is smaller so that it can
be a more exciting venue. We propose that
one of the best ways to get students more in
volved is to place them all closer to the field.
Instead of limiting them to one section,
spread students out along the first ten rows
of several sections, and place the band next
to — not in front of — them. Similar to the
setup in Maples Pavilion, this would allow
students to transfer their excitement to the
field. It would also give the much-maligned
yell leaders a chance to be heard by the
whole student section, instead of just the first
ten rows.
In addition, and just as importantly, the
student section should be kept large. The
number of student tickets available must re
main unlimited and student attendance re
main unrestricted, even if this means that a
few seats will be empty at games or that
some Big Game tickets will have to be sold
on gameday. When Stanford starts the sea
son undefeated in the future, and student in
terest consequently increases, students need
the unconstrained opportunity to join the
football fervor.

schedule. This accelerated construction
plan is promising; before anyone on campus
realizes, the new stadium will probably be
up and ready.
The University's plans for the new stadi
um are still being hammered out. plans that
will shape the football experience for fans
for generations to come. Accordingly, we'd
like to take this opportunity to provide some
input from a student perspective.
First, we thank the University for asking
for fan input. A survey was sent out to some
All-Axess members, asking them to com
ment on what they like and dislike about the
current stadium. While we know that student
input is probably not the most important fac
tor in the planning process, it's a great sign
that the University is asking for such input
even in a project as condensed as this stadi
um construction.
Whenever one destroys a landmark that
has outlasted many of those who played in it,
there is bound to be some grumbling. But we
have heard little of it. A more intimate stadi
um, a better noise profile and seatbacks are
all welcome improvements. The main con
cerns that have been expressed regard po
tential increases in ticket prices and the dan
ger that Stanford football could become too
exclusive — especially if the team starts win
ning more often.
Tickets
From a student perspective, ticket prices
are a huge concern. The administration de
serves thanks for not raising student prices
over the past four years. Unlike tuition, stu
dent tickets are clearly not seen as a primary
source of revenue. While we trust that this
trend of maintaining student ticket prices
will continue, we would like to emphasize
that even $40 — the current price of a stu
dent season ticket — seems high to manv

students — especially those who only attend
Big Game.
The University, therefore, should ab
solutely not increase ticket prices for stu
dents due to the fewer number of seats in the
new stadium. Supply-and-demand consider
ations should not even be involved when
pricing student tickets, because we expect
the administration will offer unlimited tick
ets to students.
Finally, the administration should work
hard to keep young alumni connected to the
football program. Men's basketball has
taken a great step in this direction by releas
ing heavily-discounted tickets to alumni of
the Sixth Man Club. The football program
should consider comparable actions — per
haps by holding a certain number of Big
Game tickets for young alumni and by simi
larly offering tickets to this group at a rate
that is discounted from the prices which we
anticipate will be inflated next year.
Enthusiasm
We are not just concerned with money. In
fact, some of the most promising improve
ments to the Stadium don't involve money at
all. Instead, they deal with enthusiasm and
noise.
The new stadium is smaller so that it can
be a more exciting venue. We propose that
one of the best ways to get students more in
volved is to place them all closer to the field.
Instead of limiting them to one section,
spread students out along the first ten rows
of several sections, and place the band next
to — not in front of — them. Similar to the
setup in Maples Pavilion, this would allow
students to transfer their excitement to the
field. It would also give the much-maligned
yell leaders a chance to be heard by the
whole student section, instead of just the first
ten rows.
In addition, and just as importantly, the
student section should be kept large. The
number of student tickets available must re
main unlimited and student attendance re
main unrestricted, even if this means that a
few seats will be empty at games or that
some Big Game tickets will have to be sold
on gameday. When Stanford starts the sea
son undefeated in the future, and student in
terest consequently increases, students need
the unconstrained opportunity to join the
football fervor.

The bulldozers were ready to roll in im
mediately after the Notre Dame
game on Saturday, and the ground
breaking for the new Stanford Stadium has
not been ceremonial. Some may interpret
this haste as unseemly in the demolition of
a piece of Stanford history, and Stanford
alums who have witnessed glorious victo
ries will probably feel this loss particularly
keenly. Yet progress is clearly being made
on this building project, and we applaud the
University for starting the process right on
schedule. This accelerated construction
plan is promising; before anyone on campus
realizes, the new stadium will probably be
up and ready.
