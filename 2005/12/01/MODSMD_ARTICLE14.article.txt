## Hating on Housing 
### 
1 should have known this would happen.
But I made the classic blunder. Like Nick
Carraway, I believed that "reserving
judgments is a matter of infinite hope," and I
had faith that despite its bum rap. Housing
would do a good job of evenly meting out
room assignments. 1 believed that when I
drew a 2001 unpreferred, I would get one of
my top eight choices. I trusted that because I
was studying in a Stanford program, I would
get better housing than, say, Jon Casto or
Alexa Binns,who are in Spain and living in a
Roble single and ZAP. respectively. But, like
all beliefs built on lies and propaganda,
those myths have gone the way of Santa
Claus and the Easter Bunny. It is official:
Housing fucked me.
I'll be living in Murray House for the rest
of the year. And don't start in with some jive
about how it could be worse, because this is
pretty much bottom of the barrel. When the
best perk is that I can buy mozzarella sticks
from Late Nite down the block at 2 a.m.,
things are looking pretty grim. I lived in Eu
calipto freshman year, and I know pretty
much everything West Campus has to offer:
alcoholism,depression and cultural isolation
— so maybe making the transition from
Berlin back to Stanford won't be that hard
after all.
On the plus side, I may be in a two-room
double, which I guess is nice. If I could redo
that "note to your future roommate" admis
sions essay question, it would probably go as
follows:
Dear Future Roommate,
Please let me have the inside room. I will
give you $10().
— Dave
Of course, my future roommate probably
won't read this column, and he will definite
ly be taking the inside room anyway, mean
ing I'll enjoy two quarters of awkward, early
morning encounters.
"No. no you didn't interrupt. We were
just, umm. wrestling?"
Yes, I'm being a whiny asshole. Yes, I'm
sure Murray will be fine. And yes, it definite
ly could be worse. I have a friend, for exam
ple, who was assigned to Ujamaa. I'm not
going to say she won't fit in — but she sails.

came out of the womb wearing pearls and a
ribbon belt and nearly soiled herself when
she spotted a Lacoste store at the Madrid
airport. I just don't see it.
ITie real issue here, however, is not how
my friends and I got the scrooge. Rather,
this opens up a larger commentary on
housing at Stanford — which, frankly, is
pretty decent overall. At most schools, we'd
either be living off-campus or in some
crappy high-rise dorm by sophomore year.
And living on campus at most colleges
means limited dorm events and RAs polic
ing halls for booze.
At Stanford, dorm-life is the nexus of
your social life from day one, and an army of
residential staff throws itself into a frenzy
entertaining you. For five days at the begin
ning of the year, motley freshmen tramp
about cheering about what dorm sucks more
and what house may or may not be your girl
friend's baby's father.
Sure, this is a great way to make frosh feel
welcome, but is it possible the emphasis on
residential life has backfired? Is it possible
that undergrads have begun to identify too
closely with their dorms?
Freshman year, when I told people where
I lived, I could always detect for an instant a
sort of half-pitying look — the same one you
give kids from Foothill or DeAnza. I had
been taught to identify so closely with Eu
calipto that these slights had the inevitable
effect of making me feel robbed or even in
ferior — relegated to West Campus and
missing some sort of freshman experience
that I could only get a glimpse of at Big
Game or Wilbur brunch.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's
not where you live or who you live with, but
how you live.
PS. I just senii-drunkenly dictated that
last sentence to Whitney, my editor extraor
dinaire. over the phone from a bar in Ger
many.

David Herbert got kicked nut of the comput
er lab where he wrote this, thereby forcing
him to end his colnmn prematurely (and via
an international phone call). However; he
woidd like to say that, in summary, he got
fucked — and you will (me day, too. E-mail
him at dherbert@stanford.edu.
