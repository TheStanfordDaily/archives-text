# A 						mental diary
## 
### 
Sometimes, tender November rains will
dampen my soul. Sometimes, ghosts of
worry will creep into my mental realm.
Sometimes, storms will disturb the peace of
my inner seas. Sometimes, darkness will set
tle in a sunny morning and I will take to
writing.
It won't be the kind of the writing one
does in front of a computer or with a pen. I'll
start recording sentences, metaphors and de
scriptions in my mental diary, secluded from
anyone's scrutiny. I'll take a step back and
view myself as a character in a story. I'll start
writing in my mental diary:"Even though the
clamor of people in the dining hall penetrat
ed his mind, disturbing him, he closed his
eyes and tried to delve deeper to find silence
somewhere." Or, "He felt so unrestrained
that he was at a loss about what to do. Look
ing out the window, he began to wonder if
there was anything more to life than idle
chitchat."
People about whom I know very little are
always favorite items. I'll ponder to myself,
for instance, about a radio show host: "The
man kept speaking, but words were not nu
anced enough to reflect his eloquence and
willingness to speak."
Finally, I have begun to understand why
writing of this sort can be soothing. First and
foremost, this sort of reflection serves as a
way to abstract yourself from your immedi

ate environment. Thus, you tend to recog
nize yourself as someone else and briefly
believe the idea that the worries of this
stranger are not really yours. "Poor fellow,"
I occasionally think about myself,"how he is
going to survive this week is beyond me."
And, more ironically,"l really wouldn't like
to be in his shoes."
More personally, another reason why
writing is placating is that I like words. Some
times mere words can tickle my mind. (Did 1
tell you that I always get a big kick out of
using the word "flabbergast"? Oh, I didn't
know that would flabbergast you).
I remember once watching a documen
tary about a woman who suffered from a very
specific form of dyslexia that made her ex
tremely sensible to certain colors in the white
spectrum. She recounted how she had spent
one evening ceaselessly going up and down
in an elevator because the colors of the eleva
tor buttons fascinated her.

Likewise, I feel an unjustified and abnor
mal fascination with English words. A nor
mal speaker will perhaps realize nothing ex
traordinary about the word "ominous" —
but. like that woman who can't help enjoying
the colors of the elevator buttons, I get mild
ly amused at even the mention of "ominous."
(Now, don't tell me that this doesn't flabber
gast you).
There are unsatisfying aspects of keeping
such a mental diary, as well. For instance,
sometimes I'll search for words but will only
be greeted with mere silence, and I'll feel
worse because I can't write. Like a kite aim
lessly blown by the wind, my mind will wan
der to and fro.
This can lead to interesting consequences.
I have to be honest:This mental diary of mine
has rarely materialized. "This is so beautiful
that I have to get it on paper," I think from
time to time. What am I to do? If I write them
on paper, that isn't any different from just
keeping a real diary. So. I instead send e-mails
to people — sometimes people I barely
know.
These exchanges have occasionally devel
oped into correspondences — all of which
have ended painfully, with me usually over
whelming the other side with long e-mails.
On a more optimistic note, I still have friends


Cihan
Baran
Noumena
who don't mind my long e-mails.
This habit of keeping a mental
diary also describes why 1 began to
write for The Daily. (Such niceties as
to why one writes should perhaps
have been dealt with in my introduc
tory column). During the summer, I
corresponded sporadically with four
people. There was a time in late Au
gust when all four of my correspon
dents decided that they were too
busy to write to me. And I was just
craving to write.
My mental diary was overflowing
— whenever I closed my eyes.
Words, expressions, sentences kept
attacking me. I wanted to write, but
could not bring myself to write with
out first receiving replies from my

correspondents. So, I instead wrote a
bunch of quirky e-mails to a rather
random set of people. (For example,
one of them is called "Pain As The
Most Powerful Mnemonic").
That still did not quench my thirst
for words. And then I learned I could
become a columnist for The Daily. 1
submitted an application an entire
month before school started. The ap
plication was as idiosyncratic as its
timing. And that, dear reader, is how
I started to write.
To be honest, a regular writing
job is not quite the liberator that I
had imagined it to be. I really did not
know that my creative outbursts had
extreme fluctuations — a shortcom
ing regularity brutally punishes.
Nevertheless, such punishment is
much better than a deep hunger for
words.

view myself as a character in a story. I'll start
writing in my mental diary:"Even though the
clamor of people in the dining hall penetrat
ed his mind, disturbing him, he closed his
eyes and tried to delve deeper to find silence
somewhere." Or, "He felt so unrestrained
that he was at a loss about what to do. Look
ing out the window, he began to wonder if
there was anything more to life than idle
chitchat."
People about whom I know very little are
always favorite items. I'll ponder to myself,
for instance, about a radio show host: "The
man kept speaking, but words were not nu
anced enough to reflect his eloquence and
willingness to speak."
Finally, I have begun to understand why
writing of this sort can be soothing. First and
foremost, this sort of reflection serves as a
way to abstract yourself from your immedi

ate environment. Thus, you tend to recog
nize yourself as someone else and briefly
believe the idea that the worries of this
stranger are not really yours. "Poor fellow,"
I occasionally think about myself,"how he is
going to survive this week is beyond me."
And, more ironically,"l really wouldn't like
to be in his shoes."
More personally, another reason why
writing is placating is that I like words. Some
times mere words can tickle my mind. (Did 1
tell you that I always get a big kick out of
using the word "flabbergast"? Oh, I didn't
know that would flabbergast you).
I remember once watching a documen
tary about a woman who suffered from a very
specific form of dyslexia that made her ex
tremely sensible to certain colors in the white
spectrum. She recounted how she had spent
one evening ceaselessly going up and down
in an elevator because the colors of the eleva
tor buttons fascinated her.

Likewise, I feel an unjustified and abnor
mal fascination with English words. A nor
mal speaker will perhaps realize nothing ex
traordinary about the word "ominous" —
but. like that woman who can't help enjoying
the colors of the elevator buttons, I get mild
ly amused at even the mention of "ominous."
(Now, don't tell me that this doesn't flabber
gast you).
There are unsatisfying aspects of keeping
such a mental diary, as well. For instance,
sometimes I'll search for words but will only
be greeted with mere silence, and I'll feel
worse because I can't write. Like a kite aim
lessly blown by the wind, my mind will wan
der to and fro.
This can lead to interesting consequences.
I have to be honest:This mental diary of mine
has rarely materialized. "This is so beautiful
that I have to get it on paper," I think from
time to time. What am I to do? If I write them
on paper, that isn't any different from just
keeping a real diary. So. I instead send e-mails
to people — sometimes people I barely
know.
These exchanges have occasionally devel
oped into correspondences — all of which
have ended painfully, with me usually over
whelming the other side with long e-mails.
On a more optimistic note, I still have friends

This habit of keeping a mental
diary also describes why 1 began to
write for The Daily. (Such niceties as
to why one writes should perhaps
have been dealt with in my introduc
tory column). During the summer, I
corresponded sporadically with four
people. There was a time in late Au
gust when all four of my correspon
dents decided that they were too
busy to write to me. And I was just
craving to write.
My mental diary was overflowing
— whenever I closed my eyes.
Words, expressions, sentences kept
attacking me. I wanted to write, but
could not bring myself to write with
out first receiving replies from my

correspondents. So, I instead wrote a
bunch of quirky e-mails to a rather
random set of people. (For example,
one of them is called "Pain As The
Most Powerful Mnemonic").
That still did not quench my thirst
for words. And then I learned I could
become a columnist for The Daily. 1
submitted an application an entire
month before school started. The ap
plication was as idiosyncratic as its
timing. And that, dear reader, is how
I started to write.
To be honest, a regular writing
job is not quite the liberator that I
had imagined it to be. I really did not
know that my creative outbursts had
extreme fluctuations — a shortcom
ing regularity brutally punishes.
Nevertheless, such punishment is
much better than a deep hunger for
words.

Sometimes, tender November rains will
dampen my soul. Sometimes, ghosts of
worry will creep into my mental realm.
Sometimes, storms will disturb the peace of
my inner seas. Sometimes, darkness will set
tle in a sunny morning and I will take to
writing.
It won't be the kind of the writing one
does in front of a computer or with a pen. I'll
start recording sentences, metaphors and de
scriptions in my mental diary, secluded from
anyone's scrutiny. I'll take a step back and
