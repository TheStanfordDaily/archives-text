Justified philosophy
Contrary to Navin Sivanandam's claim
("The lobster was looking straight at me and I
hurst into tears," Nov. Ift), ethical vegetarian
ism is not a "religion" but a well-developed
and highly intuitive philosophical position. It
stems from the idea that it is morally arbitrary
to disregard the interests of certain beings just
because it is convenient to do so.
1 low many of us would condone the suffer
ing imposed on animals in factory farms and
slaughterhouses if the animals in question
were dogs and cats?

Doily shows conflict of interest
The Daily must keep to higher journalistic
standards in their news pieces ("Journalist re
counts war experience," Nov. 28). Having
Olivia Sohns, president of the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME) write an
article on a CJME event is not journalism, but
rather acclamation of an even by its own
leader. Even worse, the conflict of interest was
not disclosed anywhere in the article.
We see the results of this dangerous mis
take at the end of the article, where she attrib
utes only positive comments regarding Frisk's
opinionated speech and does not include any
critical or dissenting opinions from other audi

ence members.This piece belongs in the Opin
ions section, and if that is not possible, minimal
disclosure of the writers involvement with an
event or its organizers would be necessary to
preserve any journalistic honesty.

Editor's note: The Daily clearly made a mistake
in running the article, which violated our own
conflict-of-interest policies, which prohibits re
porters from covering events relating to any
group in which they are involved. We apologize
to our readers.
Yell leaders were unpopular
three years ago, too
I couldn't help but laugh to myself after
reading Spencer Porter's column ("The hope
fully (soon to be) missing link," Nov. 30) and
Christopher Anderson's column ("Embar
rassing yell leaders have simply got to go,"
Nov. 29) trashing the yell leaders. Why? Be
cause I wrote about the same damn thing
three years ago ("Yell leaders put Stanford to
shame," Nov. 12,2002). I didn't laugh because
I thought Porter or Anderson plagiarized me.
I laughed because things simply don't change
— the yell leaders were an embarrassment
then and they're an embarrassment now.
I wrote a ton of columns for The Daily over

a three-year period, and I got a ton of feedback
(positive and negative) — but I don't think any
single column elicited as big a response from
Stanford students as my column about the yell
leaders did. My inbox was filled with responses
by the end of the day the column ran, and the
overwhelming majority could not have been
more supportive of my rant. Students and alum
ni from all walks of life concurred, and football
players even wrote that they themselves were
embarrassed by their own supposed cheerlead
ers / supporters.
I said it in 2(X)2 and I'll say it again: The yell
leaders act like a bunch of whiny, spastic nerds
saying trite jokes that make the entire Stanford
student body look like geeks. Their cheers
aren t funny, they don't know jack about foot
ball and they're not even hot. And I can tell you
from watching a bunch of games at New York
sports bars after graduation, the spectacle
doesn't look any better on TV. The yell leaders
simply have no business taking up prime real
estate on the sidelines of a major college foot
ball game.
I ended my column in 2(X)2 with the follow
ing: "But all I know is that we have to put the
collective animal that is the yell leaders to
sleep, and remove its carcass from the football
field. Maybe that's all the Fun-and-Gun needs
to get going. The Fun-and-Gun clearly never
got going, and it's unfortunate that the yell
leaders have continued to do William
Hung-meets-Screech Powers-meets-
Jan Brady-meets-Clay Aiken impres
sions on the sidelines. But it's finally
time to cut our losses.The yell leaders
need to go.
