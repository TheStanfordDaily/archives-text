The photograph printed in yester
day's Daily of University workers
casting ballots to allow a strike was
incorrectly credited. The photo was
actually taken by Mehmet Inonu.
In the article "Some hesitate to re
port assault" published November
30,2005, the Daily inaccurately quoi
ed David Rasch of the University
Ombuds office as saying that the
Ombuds office sees a half dozen sex
ual assault cases per year, and that the
Ombuds Office is not generally a first
step for reports of sexual assault or
harassment. In actuality. Rasch said
that the Ombuds Office does not
tend to hear complaints of sexual as
sault, and saw a half dozen cases
where sexual harassment, not assault.
was involved. In addition, he said the
ombuds is not usually a first step for
reports of sexual assault, but it is a
place where students can take a first
step and talk confidently about sexu
al harassment concerns.
