# VADEN RESPONDS TO CRITICISM
## Students sick of campus health center 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
As winter and finals approach and
the sunlight wanes, students are bound
to feel a little below par. Many are far
from home and when they get a cold or
the flu, they find that they can't go to
their usual physician or rely on their
parents to care for them. While they al
ways have the on-campus option of
going to Vaden Health Center, many
have expressed reservations about
going to Vaden when they get sick.
Several students said that the center
has a reputation for inadequate service,
and that the caregivers at Vaden often
fail to properly address their problems.
Though freshman Nicole Ourada has
never gone herself, she has heard about
its shortcomings via word of mouth.
"I heard that all they do is give you a
band aid," she said.
Junior Nahid Yakuby has gone to
Vaden in the past fora fever and knee
pain but quickly developed doubts
about the quality of care following her
experiences.
"I go to Vaden when I am extremely
sick and feel like I'm dying, otherwise I
call my mom or aunt," Yakuby said. "I
go only in these circumstances because
I find that Vaden doesn't really help
much, especially if I just have a cold â€”
but no doctors help with little colds. I
have reservations going to Vaden even
with more serious things because they
just try and get rid of me."
Sophomore Brandon Silberstein
said that he has yet to utilize Vaden's
services during his time on campus be
cause he doesn't trust the kind of care
he would receive.
"Most of the time, when I'm sick it's
either a cold or viral," Silberstein said.
"If it's a cold, there isn't much anyone

can do for me and if it's viral, they
would probably say that it's a cold and
not do anything."
He mentioned a friend's experience
at Vaden during which the physician
asked if she was pregnant. Many fe
male students complain of this same
occurance despite the fact that their
symptoms were seemingly unrelated to
pregnancy. Silberstein also expressed
concern that patients are not seen by
actual doctors.
Director of Vaden Health Center
Ira Friedman said that Vaden has done
all it can to address these concerns.
Asking about a female patient's men
strual cycle is not an assumption that
she is pregnant, he said, but rather it is a
routine component of a high standard
of care.
"So much of what we do interacts
with a woman's menstrual cycle includ
ing X-rays, medications and screen
ings," Friedman said. "Also, it comes up
a fair amount of times that there are a
number of conditions that affect young
women that will first present them
selves through the menstrual cycle."
As for patients not seeing doctors,
Friedman said that having more care
givers such as nurse practitioners and
physician assistants helps to increase
appointment availability, and students
can request specifically to see a physi
cian if they wish.
Eric Romo, a second year-graduate
student, said he has experienced mixed
results with Vaden.
"One time, 1 was tested fora condi
tion and they never called me with the
results," he said. "Another time, they
had e-mailed me with my test results
and that was really convenient."
This past summer, Vaden upgraded
to an entirely electronic medical sys
tem, Friedman said. Records of visits
and new patient charts are now entered
into a computer system; physicians can
