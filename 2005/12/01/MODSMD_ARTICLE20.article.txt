## Cardinal size up Grizzlies Maintaining energy on court crucial for Stanford in Montana 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford team that has looked tentative at times
against smaller squads this season gets a chance to
size itself up against players of comparable height
when the Cardinal travel to Missoula, Mont., to play
the Montana Grizzlies tomorrow in Dahlberg Arena.
"We have a travel day, and then we're going to
play a team that is really physical," head coach Trent
Johnson said after Stanford's win over Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo on Monday. "They have a good level of
toughness and a good nucleus of guys."
Montana's roster includes six men who stand at 6-
feet-7 or taller, compared to Stanford's four.The Car
dinal (2-1) will be hard-pressed to stay competitive
with the Grizzlies (2-1) if they come out of the gate
without energy, as they did against the Mustangs.
"We have to play our game, not back down, and be
aggressive," senior guard Dan Grunfeld said after
Monday's win, making it clear that he was talking
about the whole 40 minutes. "That aggressiveness is
something we have to have as a part of our game."
The Cardinal will try to build on a second half dur
ing which they slashed to the basket and pounded the
ball inside, outscoring Cal Poly, 42-17.
The Grizzlies will try to prevent just that by send
ing a rotation of big men at Stanford center Matt
Haryasz, though Montana's attack actually starts
from the outside with senior guard Kevin Criswell,
who leads the team in scoring with 15.7 points per
game. Sophomore guard Matt Martin (12.7 ppg)
teams up with Criswell to make a formidable back
court duo. Sophomore Andrew Strait provides an in
side presence, scoring 15.3 points and gathering seven
rebounds per contest.
The Grizzlies are relatively young, starting two
sophomores and one freshman, but they also return
four of the five starters from last year's NCAA Tour
nament team. Montana won the Big Sky Conference
tournament last season and gave No. I seed Washing
ton a scare in the NCAA tournament, staying with
the Huskies but eventually losing 88-77 in its first
round match.
Boise State crushed the Grizzlies in this year's sea
son-opener, 90-69, but Montana rebounded to beat
Loyola Marymount and Western Oregon. The squad
hasn't played since Thanksgiving Day and may have
to shake off some rust before battling Stanford.
The Grizzlies' main asset is their depth — 10 play
ers average 11 or more minutes per game — and the
Cardinal need to counter the bevy of big bodies that
Montana is likely to throw at them. Haryasz, Stan
ford's leading rebounder with 11.5 per contest, will be
counted on to contribute more of the same, as will
Grunfeld (6.7 rpg) and sophomore forward Taj Fin
ger (5.7 rpg).
The team must also do a better job of capitalizing
on its offensive opportunities than it has thus far.
Stanford is shooting only 40 percent from the field
and 29 percent from behind the arc, compared to its
opponents' 45 percent and 42 percent success rates in
those respective categories. The Cardinal have relied
on their physical superiority to create second-chance
points and get to the line, pulling down 21 more offen
sive boards and shooting 28 more free throws than
their opponents over the first three games.

Montana will attempt to stifle the Cardinal's inside attack, which is led by senior center Matt Haryasz. Haryasz had 16 points and pulled
down 12 rebounds in Stanford's latest contest against Cal Poly.
Stanford may not be able to bail
itself out if it shoots poorly against
the Grizzlies, a team that has out-re
bounded its opponents by over six
boards per game. Still, the Cardinal
will have to bring the tough defense
and aggressive offense they dis
played in the second half of Mon
day's game to Montana if they hope
to fly home with a win.
"We have to establish a better
tone to start the game," Johnson
said. "We have to be physical, we
have to be the aggressor, and fore
most, we have to be tough on de
fense. If not, it is going to be a very
long year."

ford's leading rebounder with 11.5 per contest, will be
counted on to contribute more of the same, as will
Grunfeld (6.7 rpg) and sophomore forward Taj Fin
ger (5.7 rpg).
The team must also do a better job of capitalizing
on its offensive opportunities than it has thus far.
Stanford is shooting only 40 percent from the field
and 29 percent from behind the arc, compared to its
opponents' 45 percent and 42 percent success rates in
those respective categories. The Cardinal have relied
on their physical superiority to create second-chance
points and get to the line, pulling down 21 more offen
sive boards and shooting 28 more free throws than
their opponents over the first three games.

Montana will attempt to stifle the Cardinal's inside attack, which is led by senior center Matt Haryasz. Haryasz had 16 points and pulled
down 12 rebounds in Stanford's latest contest against Cal Poly.
Stanford may not be able to bail
itself out if it shoots poorly against
the Grizzlies, a team that has out-re
bounded its opponents by over six
boards per game. Still, the Cardinal
will have to bring the tough defense
and aggressive offense they dis
played in the second half of Mon
day's game to Montana if they hope
to fly home with a win.
"We have to establish a better
tone to start the game," Johnson
said. "We have to be physical, we
have to be the aggressor, and fore
most, we have to be tough on de
fense. If not, it is going to be a very
long year."
A Stanford team that has looked tentative at times
against smaller squads this season gets a chance to
size itself up against players of comparable height
when the Cardinal travel to Missoula, Mont., to play
the Montana Grizzlies tomorrow in Dahlberg Arena.
"We have a travel day, and then we're going to
play a team that is really physical," head coach Trent
Johnson said after Stanford's win over Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo on Monday. "They have a good level of
toughness and a good nucleus of guys."
Montana's roster includes six men who stand at 6-
feet-7 or taller, compared to Stanford's four.The Car
dinal (2-1) will be hard-pressed to stay competitive
with the Grizzlies (2-1) if they come out of the gate
without energy, as they did against the Mustangs.
"We have to play our game, not back down, and be
aggressive," senior guard Dan Grunfeld said after
Monday's win, making it clear that he was talking
about the whole 40 minutes. "That aggressiveness is
something we have to have as a part of our game."
The Cardinal will try to build on a second half dur
ing which they slashed to the basket and pounded the
ball inside, outscoring Cal Poly, 42-17.
The Grizzlies will try to prevent just that by send
ing a rotation of big men at Stanford center Matt
Haryasz, though Montana's attack actually starts
from the outside with senior guard Kevin Criswell,
who leads the team in scoring with 15.7 points per
game. Sophomore guard Matt Martin (12.7 ppg)
teams up with Criswell to make a formidable back
court duo. Sophomore Andrew Strait provides an in
side presence, scoring 15.3 points and gathering seven
rebounds per contest.
The Grizzlies are relatively young, starting two
sophomores and one freshman, but they also return
four of the five starters from last year's NCAA Tour
nament team. Montana won the Big Sky Conference
tournament last season and gave No. I seed Washing
ton a scare in the NCAA tournament, staying with
the Huskies but eventually losing 88-77 in its first
round match.
Boise State crushed the Grizzlies in this year's sea
son-opener, 90-69, but Montana rebounded to beat
Loyola Marymount and Western Oregon. The squad
hasn't played since Thanksgiving Day and may have
to shake off some rust before battling Stanford.
The Grizzlies' main asset is their depth — 10 play
ers average 11 or more minutes per game — and the
Cardinal need to counter the bevy of big bodies that
Montana is likely to throw at them. Haryasz, Stan
ford's leading rebounder with 11.5 per contest, will be
counted on to contribute more of the same, as will
Grunfeld (6.7 rpg) and sophomore forward Taj Fin
ger (5.7 rpg).
