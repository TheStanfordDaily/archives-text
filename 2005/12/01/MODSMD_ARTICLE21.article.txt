## Women take on UOP, Lady Vols 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a 3-1 record, the No.
12 Stanford women's basket
hall team is looking to add an
easy win over Pacific tonight
but is also focused on Sun
day's face-off with No. 2 rival
Tennessee.
Stanford leads its series
with UOP. 15-3, and is on a 6-0
run against the Tigers. The
Cardinal topped Pacific 82-26
last year and 86-25 the previ
ous year.
With the recent loss of
major players, the Tigers are
attempting to regain former
footing against the Cardinal.
Pacific's losses to Stanford in
2(X)2 and 2(X)0 were by only 11
and eight points, respectively.
"They're rebuilding,"
sophomore guard Candice
Wiggins said. "1 don't know
what to expect, but they're
going to put up a fight."
Similarly, the Cardinal are
looking to put up a fight
against Tennessee this Sunday
at Maples Pavilion. The l>ady
Vols are on a 9-0 run against
Stanford, with the three most
recent matches being decided
by four points or fewer.
The looming Tennessee
challenge, however, does not
overshadow the match
against UOP.
"We treat them like any
team," junior center Brooke
Smith said. "[We assume] that
they're going to be good and
bring their best game against

us. I don't think we're over
looking them at all."
Even if it's an easy win,
tonight's game will help the
young Cardinal team grow,
which is important this early
in the season.
"We've had some extreme
games, some games where it's
really close and others where
we have 20, 30-point leads,
and that allows us to play a lot
of people," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Each game
allows you to do different
things and grow in different
ways."
Smith knows that Ten
nessee is a greater threat than
UOP and won't let it interfere
with the squad's typical strong
play tonight.
"I think we're going to go
in and try just playing our
game, not worry about them,
but work on our stuff and im
proving the same way we al
ways want to improve," she
said.
"[ln] our UOP game, it is
really critical that we play
well," VanDerveer added.
"We want to come into Sun
day's game with great mo
mentum and people playing
well, being excited and com
ing off success. So, it's really
important that we play well.
We're scouting them — we're
not overlooking them in any
way — but there definitely is
a lot of focus this week in play
ing Tennessee."

Sophomore guard Cissy Pierce and the Cardinal face No. 2 Tennessee Sunday. The
Lady Vols have won their last nine contests against Stanford.
The Pacific game will be a testing
ground for the Cardinal before Sun
day, Van Derveer said. The team will
need to focus on taking care of the
ball and avoiding turnovers, along
with making good decisions. Anoth
er area to work on is rebounding, es
pecially boxing out. Individual per
formance tonight should be relevant
to performance on Sunday.
"If someone's not boxing out
[tonight], why would I think they're

against Tennessee this Sunday
at Maples Pavilion. The l>ady
Vols are on a 9-0 run against
Stanford, with the three most
recent matches being decided
by four points or fewer.
The looming Tennessee
challenge, however, does not
overshadow the match
against UOP.
"We treat them like any
team," junior center Brooke
Smith said. "[We assume] that
they're going to be good and
bring their best game against

us. I don't think we're over
looking them at all."
Even if it's an easy win,
tonight's game will help the
young Cardinal team grow,
which is important this early
in the season.
"We've had some extreme
games, some games where it's
really close and others where
we have 20, 30-point leads,
and that allows us to play a lot
of people," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Each game
allows you to do different
things and grow in different
ways."
Smith knows that Ten
nessee is a greater threat than
UOP and won't let it interfere
with the squad's typical strong
play tonight.
"I think we're going to go
in and try just playing our
game, not worry about them,
but work on our stuff and im
proving the same way we al
ways want to improve," she
said.
"[ln] our UOP game, it is
really critical that we play
well," VanDerveer added.
"We want to come into Sun
day's game with great mo
mentum and people playing
well, being excited and com
ing off success. So, it's really
important that we play well.
We're scouting them — we're
not overlooking them in any
way — but there definitely is
a lot of focus this week in play
ing Tennessee."


NOAH HAWTHORNE / The Stanford Daily
Sophomore guard Cissy Pierce and the Cardinal face No. 2 Tennessee Sunday. The
Lady Vols have won their last nine contests against Stanford.
The Pacific game will be a testing
ground for the Cardinal before Sun
day, Van Derveer said. The team will
need to focus on taking care of the
ball and avoiding turnovers, along
with making good decisions. Anoth
er area to work on is rebounding, es
pecially boxing out. Individual per
formance tonight should be relevant
to performance on Sunday.
"If someone's not boxing out
[tonight], why would I think they're
going to box out Sunday?" Van-
Derveer said. "Or, if we're not
sprinting back [tonight], why would
I think someone would sprint back
Sunday?"
After tonight's game in Stock
ton at 7 p.m., the Cardinal return
home to face Tennessee, at 2 p.m. on
Sunday.
