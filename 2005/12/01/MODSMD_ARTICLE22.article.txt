# Admissions to blame for Card losses
## 
### 
Two weeks ago, Stanford had
an athletic "Black Saturday"
as the basketball team was
decisively defeated in its home
opener by UC-lrvine and the foot
ball team fell flat for the fourth con
secutive Big Game.
After much deliberation and a
Thanksgiving trip to Las Vegas, I've
finally traced the culprit responsible
for Black Saturday. No, not Oskii the
Bear. And no, not some evil conspir
ator in the UC system (though it
would make a lot of sense). Rather,
it's Stanford's own admissions de
partment; the same admissions de
partment that admitted us and pre
vented thousands of weenies from
walking down Palm Drive.
It seems that our admission stan
dards have risen. Reputed Bay Area
columnist Glenn Dickey posted on
his web site on Nov. 23 that the "al
ready high admissions standards [at
Stanford] have been toughened."
Immediately after Trent Johnson
took the Stanford job in May 2004,
CBS Sportsline columnist Gregg
Doyel called Johnson "exceedingly
brave or foolish" for taking a job
where the "admissions department
seemed to get tougher as its basket
ball program's profile got higher."
With rising admissions standards,
it's nearly impossible for the football
program to bring in the caliber of
talent that USC (well, no one else re
ally matches up with them), UCLA,
Cal and Oregon can. Heck, Stanford
has a tough time matching up with
Arizona State, Arizona and Oregon
State in terms of talent. In past years,
the Cardinal could rely on their op
ponents underachieving (see Hol
moe,Tom).
However, now that USC is the
nation's top program and Cal, Ore
gon and UCLA are national powers,
the Pac-10 is very competitive. Ari
zona State is a solid program and
Arizona is a rising one. Add a re
vived Notre Dame to the schedule
and Stanford plays five ranked
teams a year in addition to a few
more tough matchups.
Remember Big Game? Cal's
linemen were physically dominating
ours. The Bears' receivers were
quicker, and Stanford lacked the
equivalent of a Marshawn Lynch on
offense. You need dynamic play
makers and solid backups to have a
chance against elite programs.
I'm not predicting the demise of
Stanford's football program. I just
can't envision us competing with the
top tier teams on our schedule in up
coming years. A few bowl trips are
possible in the next few seasons but
don't expect any Roses. Since Cal is
in a rebuilding year. Stanford fans
can probably count on a few more
one-sided Big Games in coming sea
sons. (Unless Jeff Tedford leaves.)
Now to explain the basketball
loss. Often the basketball program is
cited as evidence that football can
also succeed in the face of tight ad
missions standards. However, in
football you need at least 40 quality
athletes who are likely to see game
time. In basketball, it's 12.
Still, the Cardinal haven't filled
their scholarship quota this year.
Again.
One more post player (ideally
two) for Stanford could have pre
vented that loss against UC-lrvine.
The game showed how precarious
the Cardinal's depth is â€” one injury
to Matt Haryasz and boom, we have
ourselves a much different Stanford
squad.
Depth will remain a pressing
issue for Cardinal basketball. As a
consistently ranked program, Stan
ford finds it difficult to unearth aca
demically qualified kids with hops
and a jumpshot. As Johnson said in
his interview with The Daily a few
weeks ago, there were only about 10
players with the grades and skills ca
pable of being considered by the
Cardinal.
Well, aren't 10 enough? Nope.
Not when every other school has a
pool at least twice as large. Not when
you remember that those kids need
to have a strong interest in Stanford
and choose it over the likes of Duke,
Kansas, Arizona and North Caroli
na. Johnson is reputed for his re
cruiting, but for the Card to rise
again, he needs a larger pool to fish
from.

With Washington, USC and
UCLA rising in the Pac-10 (yes, 1
said USC),the talent level needed to
capture a conference championship
should increase. Therefore, while
the Card will be able to field solid
teams, Stanford can count on a few
ugly losses unless Johnson uncovers
a group of extremely academically
motivated superstar athletes.
Before 1 receive a plethora of e
mails about Stanford values, the
merits of the admissions policy or
the difference between Stanford
and "football factory" schools, I
want to make sure it's clear I'm trac
ing out the implications of rising ad
missions standards and not advocat
ing a reduction in those standards.
Frankly, my message is this: with
the current admissions policy, ex
pect more Black Saturdays.
