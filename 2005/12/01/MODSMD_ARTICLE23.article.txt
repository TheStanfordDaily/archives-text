— JULIAN HARMON, freshman forward

perclassmen leadership and advice
is becoming more precious. Luckily
for Harmon, the older players have
been liberal with guidance both on
and off the court.
"Clare [Bodensteiner] is a great
leader and has helped me out a lot
specifically," Harmon said. "Brooke
[Smith] and Candice [Wiggins] are
such great players, and Kristin
[Newlin] has also been a big help —
really all the upperclassmen are
amazing. They've made the transi
tion so smooth."
And the praise is mutual, as the
upperclassmen know they need to
nurture the talent to get solid con
tributions from the newcomers
down the road.
"[Jillian's] a smart player, who
makes good decisions and just
knows basketball really well,"
Smith said at the beginning of the
season.
Another adjustment that Har
mon has found surprisingly easy is
adapting to the blunt honesty of
VanDerveer and the tutelage of the
coaching staff.
"Tara's very straightforward,"
Harmon said. "She tells you exactly
what you have to do to get playing
time and I like that. She lets you
know what you're doing well, and
she doesn't shy away from telling
you what you need to improve."
Harmon relishes these chances
to develop her game with the same
enthusiasm that she shows in facing
all new challenges. For instance, de
spite looking a little road-weary
after being stranded with the team
for seven hours in El Paso on the
way back from No. 14 Texas Tech,
Harmon lit up when asked about
the roadtrip.
"We got to play in front of 8,00()
people at [No. 16] Minnesota and
10,(XH) people at Texas Tech.," Har
mon said. "This is what I've been
waiting for, so it was really exciting
and a lot of fun."
After a game in Pacific tonight,
Harmon and the Cardinal are
scheduled to take on No. 2 Ten
nessee at Maples on Sunday after
noon. Though the team faces its
toughest roadblock yet, the Lady
Vols provide a perfect opportunity
for the freshman to make another
good impression — this time on a
national stage.
"I'd love it if we could get a big
student section out for Tennessee,"
Harmon said. "They're No. 1 in the
country [USA Today/ESPN poll],
and it's always a great game be
tween the two teams. It's the one
we circle on our calendar every
year, and it's one of the reasons I
came here."

Jillian Harmon has been turning
heads within the Stanford women's
basketball community since she ar
rived on the Farm. And in the first
week of her Stanford career she's
starting to show fans why head
coach Tara VanDerveer and others
were impressed with her back in the
preseason.
Four games into the young sea
son, the freshman leads the team
with 14 assists, while contributing a
solid 5.3 points and 3.0 rebounds
per game. Harmon has started
every contest so far and plays an av
erage of 19.5 minutes a game, which
ranks fifth for the Cardinal.
"Jillian's been doing really well,"
VanDerveer said before last week's
season opener in Minnesota. "1
think that all five starters are start
ing to solidify their roles."
The 6-foot-1 forward from Lake
Oswego, Ore. earned EA Sports
All-American status in her senior
season as a standout on her Lak
eridge High School squad. At Lak
eridge, she became the fifth leading
scorer in Oregon high school girl?s
basketball history.
But her past successes or experi
ences could not prepare her for the
new array of challenges that come
with playing fora top-tier collegiate
program and its demanding NCAA
schedule.
"The biggest difference between
high school and college is the pace,"
Harmon said. "Everything's a lot
quicker, everyone's bigger, every
one's stronger so you have to work
harder."
In order to make the transition
easier, all three members of the
Class of 2009 got an early start.
Along with forward Morgan
Clyburn and guard Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude, Harmon spent the sum
mer adjusting to the rigors of Stan
ford's athletics and academics by
living on campus.
"We [the freshman] got the op
portunity to come down and take
two classes this summer," Harmon
said. "That way we were able to
work out with the team every morn
ing and play pick-up. It really got us
acquainted with the college life.
"As an athlete, you don't have as
much time as other students to get
your schoolwork done, but basket
ball gets you organized and gives
you a time-schedule in which you
have to get everything done, and the
summer was a great way to help me
learn that."
Now that the basketball and aca
demic schedule has intensified, up-

Freshman forward Jillian Harmon, who has started all four contests for the No. 12 Cardinal women, leads the squad
in assists (14) and contributes 5.3 points per game.
