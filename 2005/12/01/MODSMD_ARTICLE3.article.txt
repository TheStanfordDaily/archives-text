# STUDENT LIFE
## Anti-war talk increases but protests drop 
### AMIT ARORA STAFF WRITER 
According to the Associated Press,
1,967 United States military members
have died since President Bush's decla
ration hailing the end of major combat
operations in Iraq on May 1,2003.
Since the war began, more than
2,100 United States soldiers have died,
and almost 16,000 troops have been
wounded in action. Congressional rep
resentatives from both major political
parties have begun to call for the with
drawal of troops, while the internation
al community has also become increas
ingly active in its opposition to the war
effort.
Anti-war demonstrations have yet
to be seen, however, on Stanford's cam
pus this year. While protests to the war
were a common sight in 2003, similar
rallies have not occurred of late.
Senior Tanya Haj-Hassan, president
of the Coalition for Justice in the Mid
dle East (CJME), attributed the lack of
demonstrations to a change in student
mentality.
"Three years ago, before the war
started, people were very active and
outspoken to prevent the war," she said.
"Once it started, many people began to
change. Some people lost hope while
others feared that taking an anti-war
stance would be seen as an attack on,
or lack of support for.the American
troops fighting in Iraq. Many who had
initially taken an anti-war stance and
who are still against the war fear that
withdrawing the troops at this point in
time may increase the instability that
the war created and only worsen the
situation."
Haj-Hassan maintained, however,
that students are still committed to
discussing the war effort in Iraq.
"People are still very interested in
what is going on in the region," she
said. "More than 4(X) people attended
journalist Robert Fisk's talk on Iraq
last weekend. People are expressing
interest, concern and discontent with
the current foreign policy but are sim
ply doing so through different
means."
Haj-Hassan also said the specific
role of CJME on campus did not par
ticularly lend itself to protests, noting,
"CJME prefers to raise awareness
about human rights and justice in the
Middle East through education
rather than through protests and ral
lies."
The approach of CJME and other
student groups sharply contrasts with
that of student organizations in the

past, particularly those that took ac
tion in March 2003. In one instance
near the start of the war, over 200
Stanford students, faculty and com
munity members gathered in White
Plaza and marched to Palo Alto to
join in a citywide demonstration. Stu
dent organizations on campus addi
tionally held a "Books not Bombs"
rally to oppose the preemptive strike,
with at least 26 faculty members can
celing classes and 64 expressing sup
port.
Stanford's anti-war effort saw the
arrest of at least 30 Stanford students
in March 2003 as well. Less than 12
hours after President George W.
Bush announced the first strikes
against Iraq, almost 100 members of
the Stanford community protested
the military strike in San Francisco.
Part of a larger, coordinated protest,
students and faculty blocked traffic
at busy intersections by forming
human chains, and a number of pro
testers were arrested for their civil
disobedience.
Although student activity has no
ticeably changed over the last few
years, many assert that interest re
garding the war is still very much alive
on campus. Junior Omar Shakir, pres
ident of the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network, shared Haj-Hassan's
viewpoint on the anti-war effort.
"I think that student activism re
garding Iraq has not really diminished
but has assumed different forms over

the last couple of years," he said. "I still
think that Iraq is an issue of significant
focus on campus, as seen by the huge
turnout to events on this issue and the
large e-mail lists of interested people
organizations that deal with the Mid
dle East have amassed."
Shakir said he also recognizes the
distinction between present student
activity and past student war protests
and defends the current mentality.
"Our group usually does not or
ganize rallies or protests because we
have found that students on campus
are generally not receptive to that
kind of approach," he said. "Aware
ness and advocacy are critical and ul
timately more effective at Stanford."
An Iraqi-American, Shakir noted
his unique perspective on the war but
said he sets his sights beyond the con
flict in Iraq.
"Although this war strikes very
close to home, I, personally,devote my
energy to raising awareness about all
different kinds of human rights viola
tions," he said. "Iraq is undeniably in a
miserable situation, but I am a firm
believer that we must fight injustice
everywhere it is found, not just in our
backyards."

withdrawing the troops at this point in
time may increase the instability that
the war created and only worsen the
situation."
Haj-Hassan maintained, however,
that students are still committed to
discussing the war effort in Iraq.
"People are still very interested in
what is going on in the region," she
said. "More than 4(X) people attended
journalist Robert Fisk's talk on Iraq
last weekend. People are expressing
interest, concern and discontent with
the current foreign policy but are sim
ply doing so through different
means."
Haj-Hassan also said the specific
role of CJME on campus did not par
ticularly lend itself to protests, noting,
"CJME prefers to raise awareness
about human rights and justice in the
Middle East through education
rather than through protests and ral
lies."
The approach of CJME and other
student groups sharply contrasts with
that of student organizations in the

past, particularly those that took ac
tion in March 2003. In one instance
near the start of the war, over 200
Stanford students, faculty and com
munity members gathered in White
Plaza and marched to Palo Alto to
join in a citywide demonstration. Stu
dent organizations on campus addi
tionally held a "Books not Bombs"
rally to oppose the preemptive strike,
with at least 26 faculty members can
celing classes and 64 expressing sup
port.
Stanford's anti-war effort saw the
arrest of at least 30 Stanford students
in March 2003 as well. Less than 12
hours after President George W.
Bush announced the first strikes
against Iraq, almost 100 members of
the Stanford community protested
the military strike in San Francisco.
Part of a larger, coordinated protest,
students and faculty blocked traffic
at busy intersections by forming
human chains, and a number of pro
testers were arrested for their civil
disobedience.
Although student activity has no
ticeably changed over the last few
years, many assert that interest re
garding the war is still very much alive
on campus. Junior Omar Shakir, pres
ident of the Muslim Student Aware
ness Network, shared Haj-Hassan's
viewpoint on the anti-war effort.
"I think that student activism re
garding Iraq has not really diminished
but has assumed different forms over

the last couple of years," he said. "I still
think that Iraq is an issue of significant
focus on campus, as seen by the huge
turnout to events on this issue and the
large e-mail lists of interested people
organizations that deal with the Mid
dle East have amassed."
Shakir said he also recognizes the
distinction between present student
activity and past student war protests
and defends the current mentality.
"Our group usually does not or
ganize rallies or protests because we
have found that students on campus
are generally not receptive to that
kind of approach," he said. "Aware
ness and advocacy are critical and ul
timately more effective at Stanford."
An Iraqi-American, Shakir noted
his unique perspective on the war but
said he sets his sights beyond the con
flict in Iraq.
"Although this war strikes very
close to home, I, personally,devote my
energy to raising awareness about all
different kinds of human rights viola
tions," he said. "Iraq is undeniably in a
miserable situation, but I am a firm
believer that we must fight injustice
everywhere it is found, not just in our
backyards."
Tonight, Stanford in Government

According to the Associated Press,
1,967 United States military members
have died since President Bush's decla
ration hailing the end of major combat
operations in Iraq on May 1,2003.
Since the war began, more than
2,100 United States soldiers have died,
and almost 16,000 troops have been
wounded in action. Congressional rep
resentatives from both major political
parties have begun to call for the with
drawal of troops, while the internation
al community has also become increas
ingly active in its opposition to the war
effort.
Anti-war demonstrations have yet
to be seen, however, on Stanford's cam
pus this year. While protests to the war
were a common sight in 2003, similar
rallies have not occurred of late.
Senior Tanya Haj-Hassan, president
of the Coalition for Justice in the Mid
dle East (CJME), attributed the lack of
demonstrations to a change in student
mentality.
"Three years ago, before the war
started, people were very active and
outspoken to prevent the war," she said.
"Once it started, many people began to
change. Some people lost hope while
others feared that taking an anti-war
stance would be seen as an attack on,
or lack of support for.the American
troops fighting in Iraq. Many who had
initially taken an anti-war stance and
who are still against the war fear that
withdrawing the troops at this point in
time may increase the instability that
the war created and only worsen the
situation."
