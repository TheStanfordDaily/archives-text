# AFTER STANFORD
## Grads seek out nonprofit employment Peace Corps, Teach for America popular choices 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM STAFF WRITER 
While many of her classmates will be at
tending medical school or tackling their first
professional jobs next year, senior Maria
Palmer has chosen a different path for her
postgraduate career. The new year will find
Palmer in Latin America, volunteering as a

business advisor for the Peace Corps.
Palmer is not alone. According to Lance
Choy, the director of Stanford's Career De
velopment Center (CDC), 7 percent of the
respondents who report finding jobs at the
time of the CDC's annual postgraduate sur
vey obtain jobs with nonprofits or the U.S.
government, not including the military.Teach
for America and the Peace Corps are the
most popular of these options.
Palmer first heard about the Peace Corps
through her AP environmental studies class
as a junior in high school.
"Peace Corps was appealing for its inter

national focus — the opportunity to immerse
yourself in a foreign culture with such perks
as learning a new language while offering
your time to improve humanity around the
globe"she said.
Founded in 1%1, the Peace Corps is an in
ternational volunteering organization that
currently operates in 71 countries, with more
than 7,(XX) active volunteers. According to the
Stanford News Service. Stanford was ninth
among medium-sized universities in the
number of volunteers active in the Peace
Corps as of January 2(M)4. Stanford
ranked 12th on the list for the all
time number of volunteers, regard
less of college size.
According to the Peace Corps
Web site, interested students must fill
out a detailed application with two
written essays. A Peace Corps repre
sentative then contacts the student
for an in-person interview.This repre
sentative chooses to nominate or not
nominate the student. If the student is
nominated, he or she must undergo
an extensive medical examination in
preparation for his or her travels.
"The [medical evaluation) packet
includes such forms as getting a den
tist check-up. including X-rays, to get
ting three stool samples from your
primary-care physician," Palmer
said.
Because Palmer's medical review
is still pending, she does not yet know
exactly what her 27-month service
will require.
"ITie role of a business advisor
can range from working in the equiv
alent of our Chamber of Commerce
in a large Latin American city to
working in a rural setting helping ar
tisans and farmers bring their works
or crops to market," she said, "i will

know where I'm going six months be
fore 1 leave, at the earliest."
According to the Web site. Peace
Corps volunteers receive a living al
lowance while working in their as
signed countries, which enables them
to live in a manner similar to the local
people in their communities. The or
ganization also provides complete
medical and dental care and covers
the cost of transportation to and from
the country of service.
Although Palmer will be gone for
more than two years, she has not yet
ruled out graduate school.
"1 don't look at this as doing
something instead of going to gradu
ate school or getting a job; I look at it
as preparation for such things," she
said. "I will presumably become flu
ent in Spanish; 1 will learn how to
adapt in a new place and culture; 1
will hone business-advising tech
niques and all the while, I will be
learning how to interact and care for
people, all of which are invaluable
skills for future endeavors."
1 leather Sims, who graduated last
spring, is already pursuing a post
graduate career in a similar nonprof
it program — Teach for America, a
national association of recent college
graduates teaching in rural and urban
schools in 22 regions across the coun
try. According to the Teach for Amer
ica Web site, 3.5(H) of its members are
teaching in more than I.(MX) schools
nationwide.

Sims originally heard about Teach
for America from other Stanford
alumni, one who was teaching in San
Jose at the time, and the other who
had just finished her two-year com
mitment in New Orleans.
"1 wanted to apply because I'd
been involved in Ravenswood Reads
and always enjoyed tutoring," she
said. "I also really bought into Teach
for America's notion of equal educa
tional opportunity as a civil right.
And, honestly, I was ready to take a
break from school. Teach for Ameri
ca offers a lot more structure and
support in many ways than your av
erage non-profit gig."
Wendy Copp, a graduate of
Princeton University founded Teach
for America in 1990 with a $26,000
grant from the Mobile Corporation
after researching the public school
system's inequities for her senior the
sis and resolving to take action.
Competition fora spot in the or
ganization is fierce. According to
Sims, 17.000 students applied last
year, while only 2.5(H) were accepted
— a little less than 15 percent. Appli
cants must complete an online appli
cation. which includes a letter of in
tent. resume and essay. A selection
committee then reviews all of the ap
plications and invites the most prom
ising applicants to participate in a
daylong interview, which includes a
sample teaching lesson, a group dis
cussion and a personal interview. It is

during this time that the applicant in
dicates his or her preference for loca
tion, grade level and subject area.The
teachers then undergo an extensive
program at a summer training insti
tute, where they are involved in such
activities as teaching in summer
school programs.
Sims is currently teaching ninth
and l()th grade social studies at
Bronx International High School, a
secondary school in New York City
comprised entirely of children learn
ing English as a second language.
"All of the students are brand new
to the country, ranging from a few
months to a couple of years here," she
said.
Sims said there are many differ
ences between her own high-school
experience in Northern California
and the school at which she is now
working.
"My high school was nothing like
where I teach now, and I don't just
mean the metal detectors," she said.
"There is a very large emphasis on
collaborative learning and project
based learning at my school, which
means that my teaching style is sup
posed to be practically the opposite
of any lecture-style high-school or
university class that you've ever sat
through."
"My kids are also incredibly di
verse, in terms of both background
and academic ability," Sims contin
ued. "I have some students who

missed between two and 10 years of
formal education in their home coun
try and are therefore illiterate in their
home language, let alone English."
Sims lives with other teachers (not
from Teach for America) in Harlem,
a 30-minute commute from her
school.
"Teach for America provides
housing during the summer hut not
during our teaching stint, as we are
employees of the New York City
board of education," she said. "The
downside to living with other teach
ers is that you never seem to hear the
end of 'Today, this kid said to me...'
stories."
Sims is not certain that she will
continue teaching after her two-year
commitment with Teach for America
is completed.
"About 60 percent of Teach for
America alumni stay in education in
some form or another,"she said."But
I don't know if I will. It's impossible
to say in the first year. Most teachers
will tell you that there is nothing —
nothing — harder than your first
year of teaching. You live, sleep,
breathe, eat and dream teaching, les
son plans, grading and discipline. 1
hear my kids' voices in my head when
I'm on the subway, at the gym or try
ing to go to sleep. So it's impossible to
say whether I'll be good at this in the
long haul. I'm waiting until 1 have a
bit more experience before I say for
sure."

While many of her classmates will be at
tending medical school or tackling their first
professional jobs next year, senior Maria
Palmer has chosen a different path for her
postgraduate career. The new year will find
Palmer in Latin America, volunteering as a

business advisor for the Peace Corps.
Palmer is not alone. According to Lance
Choy, the director of Stanford's Career De
velopment Center (CDC), 7 percent of the
respondents who report finding jobs at the
time of the CDC's annual postgraduate sur
vey obtain jobs with nonprofits or the U.S.
government, not including the military.Teach
for America and the Peace Corps are the
most popular of these options.
Palmer first heard about the Peace Corps
through her AP environmental studies class
as a junior in high school.
"Peace Corps was appealing for its inter

national focus — the opportunity to immerse
yourself in a foreign culture with such perks
as learning a new language while offering
your time to improve humanity around the
globe"she said.
Founded in 1%1, the Peace Corps is an in
ternational volunteering organization that
currently operates in 71 countries, with more
than 7,(XX) active volunteers. According to the
Stanford News Service. Stanford was ninth
among medium-sized universities in the
number of volunteers active in the Peace
Corps as of January 2(M)4. Stanford
ranked 12th on the list for the all
time number of volunteers, regard
less of college size.
According to the Peace Corps
Web site, interested students must fill
out a detailed application with two
written essays. A Peace Corps repre
sentative then contacts the student
for an in-person interview.This repre
sentative chooses to nominate or not
nominate the student. If the student is
nominated, he or she must undergo
an extensive medical examination in
preparation for his or her travels.
"The [medical evaluation) packet
includes such forms as getting a den
tist check-up. including X-rays, to get
ting three stool samples from your
primary-care physician," Palmer
said.
Because Palmer's medical review
is still pending, she does not yet know
exactly what her 27-month service
will require.
"ITie role of a business advisor
can range from working in the equiv
alent of our Chamber of Commerce
in a large Latin American city to
working in a rural setting helping ar
tisans and farmers bring their works
or crops to market," she said, "i will

know where I'm going six months be
fore 1 leave, at the earliest."
According to the Web site. Peace
Corps volunteers receive a living al
lowance while working in their as
signed countries, which enables them
to live in a manner similar to the local
people in their communities. The or
ganization also provides complete
medical and dental care and covers
the cost of transportation to and from
the country of service.
Although Palmer will be gone for
more than two years, she has not yet
ruled out graduate school.
"1 don't look at this as doing
something instead of going to gradu
ate school or getting a job; I look at it
as preparation for such things," she
said. "I will presumably become flu
ent in Spanish; 1 will learn how to
adapt in a new place and culture; 1
will hone business-advising tech
niques and all the while, I will be
learning how to interact and care for
people, all of which are invaluable
skills for future endeavors."

spring, is already pursuing a post
graduate career in a similar nonprof

graduates teaching in rural and urban
schools in 22 regions across the coun
try. According to the Teach for Amer
ica Web site, 3.5(H) of its members are
teaching in more than I.(MX) schools
nationwide.

Sims originally heard about Teach
for America from other Stanford
alumni, one who was teaching in San
Jose at the time, and the other who
had just finished her two-year com
mitment in New Orleans.
"1 wanted to apply because I'd
been involved in Ravenswood Reads
and always enjoyed tutoring," she
said. "I also really bought into Teach
for America's notion of equal educa
tional opportunity as a civil right.
And, honestly, I was ready to take a
break from school. Teach for Ameri
ca offers a lot more structure and
support in many ways than your av
erage non-profit gig."

for America in 1990 with a $26,000
grant from the Mobile Corporation
after researching the public school
system's inequities for her senior the
sis and resolving to take action.
Competition fora spot in the or
ganization is fierce. According to
Sims, 17.000 students applied last
year, while only 2.5(H) were accepted
— a little less than 15 percent. Appli
cants must complete an online appli
cation. which includes a letter of in
tent. resume and essay. A selection
committee then reviews all of the ap
plications and invites the most prom
ising applicants to participate in a
daylong interview, which includes a
sample teaching lesson, a group dis
cussion and a personal interview. It is

during this time that the applicant in
dicates his or her preference for loca
tion, grade level and subject area.The
teachers then undergo an extensive
program at a summer training insti
tute, where they are involved in such
activities as teaching in summer
school programs.
Sims is currently teaching ninth
and l()th grade social studies at
Bronx International High School, a
secondary school in New York City
comprised entirely of children learn
ing English as a second language.
"All of the students are brand new
to the country, ranging from a few
months to a couple of years here," she
said.
Sims said there are many differ
ences between her own high-school
experience in Northern California
and the school at which she is now
working.
"My high school was nothing like
where I teach now, and I don't just
mean the metal detectors," she said.
"There is a very large emphasis on
collaborative learning and project
based learning at my school, which
means that my teaching style is sup
posed to be practically the opposite
of any lecture-style high-school or
university class that you've ever sat
through."
"My kids are also incredibly di
verse, in terms of both background
and academic ability," Sims contin
ued. "I have some students who

missed between two and 10 years of
formal education in their home coun
try and are therefore illiterate in their
home language, let alone English."
Sims lives with other teachers (not
from Teach for America) in Harlem,
a 30-minute commute from her
school.
"Teach for America provides
housing during the summer hut not
during our teaching stint, as we are
employees of the New York City
board of education," she said. "The
downside to living with other teach
ers is that you never seem to hear the
end of 'Today, this kid said to me...'
stories."
Sims is not certain that she will
continue teaching after her two-year
commitment with Teach for America
is completed.
"About 60 percent of Teach for
America alumni stay in education in
some form or another,"she said."But
I don't know if I will. It's impossible
to say in the first year. Most teachers
will tell you that there is nothing —
nothing — harder than your first
year of teaching. You live, sleep,
breathe, eat and dream teaching, les
son plans, grading and discipline. 1

professional jobs next year, senior Maria
Palmer has chosen a different path for her
postgraduate career. The new year will find
Palmer in Latin America, volunteering as a

business advisor for the Peace Corps.
Palmer is not alone. According to Lance
Choy, the director of Stanford's Career De
velopment Center (CDC), 7 percent of the
respondents who report finding jobs at the
time of the CDC's annual postgraduate sur
vey obtain jobs with nonprofits or the U.S.
government, not including the military.Teach
for America and the Peace Corps are the
most popular of these options.
Palmer first heard about the Peace Corps
through her AP environmental studies class
as a junior in high school.
"Peace Corps was appealing for its inter

national focus — the opportunity to immerse
yourself in a foreign culture with such perks
as learning a new language while offering
your time to improve humanity around the
globe"she said.
Founded in 1%1, the Peace Corps is an in
ternational volunteering organization that
currently operates in 71 countries, with more
than 7,(XX) active volunteers. According to the
Stanford News Service. Stanford was ninth
among medium-sized universities in the
number of volunteers active in the Peace
Corps as of January 2(M)4. Stanford
ranked 12th on the list for the all
time number of volunteers, regard
less of college size.
According to the Peace Corps
Web site, interested students must fill
out a detailed application with two
written essays. A Peace Corps repre
sentative then contacts the student
for an in-person interview.This repre
sentative chooses to nominate or not
nominate the student. If the student is
nominated, he or she must undergo
an extensive medical examination in
preparation for his or her travels.
"The [medical evaluation) packet
includes such forms as getting a den
tist check-up. including X-rays, to get
ting three stool samples from your
primary-care physician," Palmer
said.
Because Palmer's medical review
is still pending, she does not yet know
exactly what her 27-month service
will require.
"ITie role of a business advisor
can range from working in the equiv
alent of our Chamber of Commerce
in a large Latin American city to
working in a rural setting helping ar
tisans and farmers bring their works
or crops to market," she said, "i will

know where I'm going six months be
fore 1 leave, at the earliest."
According to the Web site. Peace
Corps volunteers receive a living al
lowance while working in their as
signed countries, which enables them
to live in a manner similar to the local
people in their communities. The or
ganization also provides complete
medical and dental care and covers
the cost of transportation to and from
the country of service.
Although Palmer will be gone for
more than two years, she has not yet
ruled out graduate school.
"1 don't look at this as doing
something instead of going to gradu
ate school or getting a job; I look at it
as preparation for such things," she
said. "I will presumably become flu
ent in Spanish; 1 will learn how to
adapt in a new place and culture; 1
will hone business-advising tech
niques and all the while, I will be
learning how to interact and care for
people, all of which are invaluable
skills for future endeavors."
1 leather Sims, who graduated last
spring, is already pursuing a post
graduate career in a similar nonprof
it program — Teach for America, a
national association of recent college
graduates teaching in rural and urban
schools in 22 regions across the coun
try. According to the Teach for Amer
ica Web site, 3.5(H) of its members are
teaching in more than I.(MX) schools
nationwide.

Sims originally heard about Teach
for America from other Stanford
alumni, one who was teaching in San
Jose at the time, and the other who
had just finished her two-year com
mitment in New Orleans.
"1 wanted to apply because I'd
been involved in Ravenswood Reads
and always enjoyed tutoring," she
said. "I also really bought into Teach
for America's notion of equal educa
tional opportunity as a civil right.
And, honestly, I was ready to take a
break from school. Teach for Ameri
ca offers a lot more structure and
support in many ways than your av
erage non-profit gig."
Wendy Copp, a graduate of
Princeton University founded Teach
for America in 1990 with a $26,000
grant from the Mobile Corporation
after researching the public school
system's inequities for her senior the
sis and resolving to take action.
Competition fora spot in the or
ganization is fierce. According to
Sims, 17.000 students applied last
year, while only 2.5(H) were accepted
— a little less than 15 percent. Appli
cants must complete an online appli
cation. which includes a letter of in
tent. resume and essay. A selection
committee then reviews all of the ap
plications and invites the most prom
ising applicants to participate in a
daylong interview, which includes a
sample teaching lesson, a group dis
cussion and a personal interview. It is

during this time that the applicant in
dicates his or her preference for loca
tion, grade level and subject area.The
teachers then undergo an extensive
program at a summer training insti
tute, where they are involved in such
activities as teaching in summer
school programs.
Sims is currently teaching ninth
and l()th grade social studies at
Bronx International High School, a
secondary school in New York City
comprised entirely of children learn
ing English as a second language.
"All of the students are brand new
to the country, ranging from a few
months to a couple of years here," she
said.
Sims said there are many differ
ences between her own high-school
experience in Northern California
and the school at which she is now
working.
"My high school was nothing like
where I teach now, and I don't just
mean the metal detectors," she said.
"There is a very large emphasis on
collaborative learning and project
based learning at my school, which
means that my teaching style is sup
posed to be practically the opposite
of any lecture-style high-school or
university class that you've ever sat
through."
"My kids are also incredibly di
verse, in terms of both background
and academic ability," Sims contin
ued. "I have some students who

missed between two and 10 years of
formal education in their home coun
try and are therefore illiterate in their
home language, let alone English."
Sims lives with other teachers (not
from Teach for America) in Harlem,
a 30-minute commute from her
school.
"Teach for America provides
housing during the summer hut not
during our teaching stint, as we are
employees of the New York City
board of education," she said. "The
downside to living with other teach
ers is that you never seem to hear the
end of 'Today, this kid said to me...'
stories."
Sims is not certain that she will
continue teaching after her two-year
commitment with Teach for America
is completed.
"About 60 percent of Teach for
America alumni stay in education in
some form or another,"she said."But
I don't know if I will. It's impossible
to say in the first year. Most teachers
will tell you that there is nothing —
nothing — harder than your first
year of teaching. You live, sleep,
breathe, eat and dream teaching, les
son plans, grading and discipline. 1
hear my kids' voices in my head when
I'm on the subway, at the gym or try
ing to go to sleep. So it's impossible to
say whether I'll be good at this in the
long haul. I'm waiting until 1 have a
bit more experience before I say for
sure."
