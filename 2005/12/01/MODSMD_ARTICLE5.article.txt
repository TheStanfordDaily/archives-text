## Students reluctant to visit profs Some faculty provide incentives to attend office hours 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford prides itself on its liberal learning
environment, where students supposedly have
the golden opportunity to approach interna
tionally-acclaimed professors in every field.
How many students actually take advantage of
this access, however, is questionable.
"In my classes I have to beg students to come
to my office hours and then have to shame them
into coming to visit their lonely professor sitting
all alone with no one to talk to," remarked Psy
chology Prof. Emeritus Philip Zimbardo,one of
several professors who said they spend extend
ed periods of their mandatory office hours un
accompanied.
"The fault, dear Brutus, lies in their shyness,"
Zimbardo said. "They are too shy to try, don't
know how to carry on a simple conversation in

face time and
may not have
anything to say
once they do. It is
a student myth
that faculty are
unapproachable;
it gets them off
the hook of initi
ating contact by
blaming us."
Some stu

told a radically
different story. A
freshman who
asked to remain
anonymous said
that the problem
is not so much
about shyness but
about professors
being difficult to
reach.
"I don't think
professors realize
how hard it is for

'Faculty are
humans and
they like to
encounter
students who
share their
interests'

said. "These are celebrities of the academic
world that are by nature so intimidating. One
unfriendly e-mail or an ignored hi. whether by
mistake or not, shoots down any confidence in
students to meet them."
Senior Daniel Kim said that cultural differ
ence is potentially another barrier for students.
As an international student from Korea, Kim
said that many cultures do not practice such a
liberal educational philosophy as Stanford.
"Some students are not used to the idea that
you can just go to professors and chat with them
unless you have a very specific agenda," he said.
"In other cultures, it is natural that professors
not be so easily accessible â€” they are supposed
to be revered and difficult to approach."
But according to the testimonials of both
students and professors, it is not so much shy
ness or inaccessibility that blocks communica-
