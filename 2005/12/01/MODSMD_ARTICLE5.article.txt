## Students reluctant to visit profs Some faculty provide incentives to attend office hours 
### ARAM HUR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford prides itself on its liberal learning
environment, where students supposedly have
the golden opportunity to approach interna
tionally-acclaimed professors in every field.
How many students actually take advantage of
this access, however, is questionable.
"In my classes I have to beg students to come
to my office hours and then have to shame them
into coming to visit their lonely professor sitting
all alone with no one to talk to," remarked Psy
chology Prof. Emeritus Philip Zimbardo,one of
several professors who said they spend extend
ed periods of their mandatory office hours un
accompanied.
"The fault, dear Brutus, lies in their shyness,"
Zimbardo said. "They are too shy to try, don't
know how to carry on a simple conversation in

face time and
may not have
anything to say
once they do. It is
a student myth
that faculty are
unapproachable;
it gets them off
the hook of initi
ating contact by
blaming us."
Some stu
dents, however,
told a radically
different story. A
freshman who
asked to remain
anonymous said
that the problem
is not so much
about shyness but
about professors
being difficult to
reach.
"I don't think
professors realize
how hard it is for

'Faculty are
humans and
they like to
encounter
students who
share their
interests'
LORRAINE STERRITT

regular students to even try to talk to them," she
said. "These are celebrities of the academic
world that are by nature so intimidating. One
unfriendly e-mail or an ignored hi. whether by
mistake or not, shoots down any confidence in
students to meet them."
Senior Daniel Kim said that cultural differ
ence is potentially another barrier for students.
As an international student from Korea, Kim
said that many cultures do not practice such a
liberal educational philosophy as Stanford.
"Some students are not used to the idea that
you can just go to professors and chat with them
unless you have a very specific agenda," he said.
"In other cultures, it is natural that professors
not be so easily accessible — they are supposed
to be revered and difficult to approach."
But according to the testimonials of both
students and professors, it is not so much shy
ness or inaccessibility that blocks communica-
Students find profs daunting

tion but rather mis
taken assumptions
about one another.
While professors
interpret an absence
at office hours as ei
ther diffidence or
lack of initiative on
the student's part,
the reality seems to
be that the bulk of
students are intimi
dated — either by
personality or cul
ture — and need an
extra push. Simulta
neously, the student
perception of pro
fessors as famed,
busy individuals
who are not really
interested in meet
ing them is likely in
accurate.
"Of course Stan
ford faculty work
hard, we would not

be here if we did not, but many of us value our connec
tion with students and welcome meeting them one on
one," Zimbardo said.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Robert Dutton agreed.
"In my own experience, I try to get to know as many
of my students as I can," he said.
Dutton also said that he even tried granting incentives
for students to come speak with him.
"I've tried the reward system for asking questions," he
said. "I've also given prizes for coming to office hours
with a good question."
To change student perceptions and facilitate commu
nication, the University and professors have collaborat
ed on a roster of academic ice-breakers. Freshman and
Sophomore Introductory Seminars — custom-tailored
for newcomers to Stanford's academic arena — grant a
natural opportunity for students to closely converse with
professors minus the awkward difficulty of randomly
dropping by office hours. General and departmental re

search programs are
also portals through
which many students
learn how to ap
proach faculty.
Apart from such
institutionalized pro
grams, however, Di
rector of Undergrad
uate Advising Pro
grams Lorraine Ster
ritt said she prods
students to just be
proactive in general.
She contends that
students must realize
they are not ap
proaching Nobel lau
reates or immaculate
researchers, but
rather fellow men
tors and colleagues
in the academic
world.
"Faculty were
once students them
selves," Sterritt said.

"Faculty are humans and they like to encounter students
who share their interests."
Sterritt also acknowledged that mustering courage for
the very first visit may be daunting, but that gradually in
teractions will become less formal and intimidating.
"It's like dating, it gets much easier after you've done
it once or twice," she said.
Next to courage, Dutton said a genuine interest in the
area of study is all he expects students to bring to the
table.
"The students who come to office hours with serious
questions and a real desire to learn more get off to a
good start in my book." he said. "This doesn't mean
they are doing well or poorly in the class. Students who
take the time to share who they are and where they
think they are going, or if they are confused and want
advice about what it ail means, get a lot more attention
and focus on my side than students who don't offer
much personally."

and focus on my side than students who don't offer
much personally."

Stanford prides itself on its liberal learning
environment, where students supposedly have
the golden opportunity to approach interna
tionally-acclaimed professors in every field.
How many students actually take advantage of
this access, however, is questionable.
"In my classes I have to beg students to come
to my office hours and then have to shame them
into coming to visit their lonely professor sitting
all alone with no one to talk to," remarked Psy
chology Prof. Emeritus Philip Zimbardo,one of
several professors who said they spend extend
ed periods of their mandatory office hours un
accompanied.
"The fault, dear Brutus, lies in their shyness,"
Zimbardo said. "They are too shy to try, don't
know how to carry on a simple conversation in

face time and
may not have
anything to say
once they do. It is
a student myth
that faculty are
unapproachable;
it gets them off
the hook of initi
ating contact by
blaming us."
Some stu
dents, however,
told a radically
different story. A
freshman who
asked to remain
anonymous said
that the problem
is not so much
about shyness but
about professors
being difficult to
reach.
"I don't think
professors realize
how hard it is for

'Faculty are
humans and
they like to
encounter
students who
share their
interests'
LORRAINE STERRITT

regular students to even try to talk to them," she
said. "These are celebrities of the academic
world that are by nature so intimidating. One
unfriendly e-mail or an ignored hi. whether by
mistake or not, shoots down any confidence in
students to meet them."
Senior Daniel Kim said that cultural differ
ence is potentially another barrier for students.
As an international student from Korea, Kim
said that many cultures do not practice such a
liberal educational philosophy as Stanford.
"Some students are not used to the idea that
you can just go to professors and chat with them
unless you have a very specific agenda," he said.
"In other cultures, it is natural that professors
not be so easily accessible — they are supposed
to be revered and difficult to approach."
But according to the testimonials of both
students and professors, it is not so much shy
ness or inaccessibility that blocks communica-
Students find profs daunting

tion but rather mis
taken assumptions
about one another.
While professors
interpret an absence
at office hours as ei
ther diffidence or
lack of initiative on
the student's part,
the reality seems to
be that the bulk of
students are intimi
dated — either by
personality or cul
ture — and need an
extra push. Simulta
neously, the student
perception of pro
fessors as famed,
busy individuals
who are not really
interested in meet
ing them is likely in
accurate.
"Of course Stan
ford faculty work
hard, we would not

be here if we did not, but many of us value our connec
tion with students and welcome meeting them one on
one," Zimbardo said.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Robert Dutton agreed.
"In my own experience, I try to get to know as many
of my students as I can," he said.
Dutton also said that he even tried granting incentives
for students to come speak with him.
"I've tried the reward system for asking questions," he
said. "I've also given prizes for coming to office hours
with a good question."
To change student perceptions and facilitate commu
nication, the University and professors have collaborat
ed on a roster of academic ice-breakers. Freshman and
Sophomore Introductory Seminars — custom-tailored
for newcomers to Stanford's academic arena — grant a
natural opportunity for students to closely converse with
professors minus the awkward difficulty of randomly
dropping by office hours. General and departmental re

search programs are
also portals through
which many students
learn how to ap
proach faculty.
Apart from such
institutionalized pro
grams, however, Di
rector of Undergrad
uate Advising Pro
grams Lorraine Ster
ritt said she prods
students to just be
proactive in general.
She contends that
students must realize
they are not ap
proaching Nobel lau
reates or immaculate
researchers, but
rather fellow men
tors and colleagues
in the academic
world.
"Faculty were
once students them
selves," Sterritt said.

"Faculty are humans and they like to encounter students
who share their interests."
Sterritt also acknowledged that mustering courage for
the very first visit may be daunting, but that gradually in
teractions will become less formal and intimidating.
"It's like dating, it gets much easier after you've done
it once or twice," she said.
Next to courage, Dutton said a genuine interest in the
area of study is all he expects students to bring to the
table.
"The students who come to office hours with serious
questions and a real desire to learn more get off to a
good start in my book." he said. "This doesn't mean
they are doing well or poorly in the class. Students who
take the time to share who they are and where they
think they are going, or if they are confused and want
advice about what it ail means, get a lot more attention
and focus on my side than students who don't offer
much personally."
