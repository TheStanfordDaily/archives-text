## GSC thankful for dinner success 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
Meeting last night for the first time since the
extended Thanksgiving break, members of the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) discussed the
discontinuation of the Caltrain GO Pass program
and declared last week's Thanksgiving Dinner a
success.
Several councilmembers expressed concern
about the proposed termination of the GO Pass
program, which provides graduate students who
live off campus with free rides on the Cal TYain.
Students may stop receiving this service when the
new year rolls around.
"The GO Pass was a pilot program for 2005,"
said Councilmember Hannah Scherer, a fifth-year
earth-sciences student. "We have a meeting next
week with Parking & Transportation to talk about
options."

Scherer added that the GO Pass provides stu
dents, the environment and the University with
countless advantages.
"Mostly people were driving to campus be
fore," she said. "There are a lot of other benefits to
taking the train, and there's a big environmental
benefit to not driving your car."
GSC Co-chair Jenny Allen, a second-year law
student, agreed with the value of the GO Pass pro
gram and said its tentative cancellation will contin
ue to be an important area of concern.
"It is a really critical issue," she said. "And will
become more so as time goes on."
Allen and the rest of the Council also took
time to acknowledge the efforts that went into
last week's well-attended GSC Thanksgiving
Dinner.

said she was pleased with how the
dinner turned out.
"The Stanford Dining staff worked
hard at preparing a great Thanksgiv
ing meal," she said. "The GSC really
appreciates the fact that they spent

Thanksgiving away from their fami
lies to make the event possible. We
could not have done it without them."
Allen agreed with Scherer and
extended compliments to the event's
many volunteers.
"Thanks to all the volunteers who
contributed time and energy to the
event; the dinner was a huge suc
cess," she said. "We had 1,4(X) to
1,500 attendees."
She also added that a large per

centage of the attendees were inter
national students and that the Coun
cil is "looking forward to having the
event next year."
In addition, the Council approved
funds for the Israeli Student Associa
tion, which is planning picnics and
parties; the German Student Associa
tion, which asked for money for an
upcoming event and the Golf Club,
which holds regular sessions at the
driving range.
