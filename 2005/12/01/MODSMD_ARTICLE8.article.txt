## Roberts Court hears its first challenge to abortion rights 
### GINA HOLLAND ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court wrestled yesterday with
how to handle a New Hampshire law that
requires a parent be told before a daugh
ter ends her pregnancy, an emotional
showdown in the court's first abortion
rights case in five years.
New Chief Justice John Roberts
seemed sympathetic to the state, but other
Justices said they were troubled that the
law does not make an exception for mi
nors who have a medical emergency.
The court did not appear satisfied with
an appeals court ruling that struck down
the law, one of dozens around the country
that require parental involvement when a
teen seeks an abortion.
Although the case does not challenge
the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that said
abortion is a fundamental constitutional
right, the stakes are still significant and
could signal where the high court is head
ed under Roberts and after the retire
ment of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Abortion was a prominent subject in
Roberts' confirmation hearings and has
emerged as a major issue in President
Bush's nomination of appeals court Judge
Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor, who
has been the swing vote in support of
abortion rights.
As protesters demonstrated outside,
the argument inside the court was at times
contentious, with justices talking over
each other and over the lawyers.
New Hampshire Attorney General
Kelly Ayotte struggled to field sharp
questions on why the state made an ex
ception to allow abortions when a moth
er's life is in danger.
The court has said before that abortion
restrictions should include a health ex
ception.
O'Connor, along with Justices Antho-

Ny Kennedy. Stephen Breyer and Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, zeroed in on how doc
tors would avoid being prosecuted or
sued if they performed an abortion if a se
verely sick minor did not want to notify a
parent and a judge was unavailable to
provide the necessary approval.
"That's the real problem here for the
doctor who's on the tine," Ginsburg said.
Justice Antonin Scalia, however, said:
"It takes 30 seconds to place a phone call"
to a judge.
If Alito is confirmed by the Senate
early next year his vote could be needed
to break a tie in the case, although justices
may find a consensus in resolving the ap
peal without a landmark decision. Jus
tices could tell the Ist U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston to review the mat
ter again.
A Senate vote is planned for January
on Alito, who is expected to be more re
ceptive to abortion restrictions than O'-
Connor.
When Alito worked for the Reagan
administration in the 1980s, he said that
he hoped the Supreme Court would one
day overturn Roe. In a memo released by
the National Archives yesterday, Alito
said that because a reversal was unlikely
the Reagan administration should instead
try to persuade justices to accept state
regulations on abortions.
The court could use this case to make it
extremely difficult for abortion rights
groups to challenge restrictions, without
dealing with the sticky issue of overturn
ing Roe itself. At issue is the legal stan
dard for courts in handling lawsuits over
abortion laws.
The New Hampshire case is being
closely watched by states that require mi
nors to tell a parent or get permission be
fore having an abortion. Justices were told
that 24 states mandate a parent's approval
and 19 states, including New Hampshire,
demand parental notice.
