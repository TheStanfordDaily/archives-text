# Vatican bans gays from priesthood
## 
### VICTOR L. SIMPSON ASSOCIATED PRESS 
VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican defended a
policy statement designed to keep men with "deep-seat
ed" homosexual tendencies from becoming priests, but
said there would be no crackdown on gays who are al
ready ordained.
The Vatican document, the first major policy state
ment of Pope Benedict XVl's papacy, was officially re
leased Tuesday after being leaked earlier. Conserva
tives have said it may help reverse the "gay culture" of
many U.S. seminaries, while liberal critics complain the
restrictions will create morale problems among clergy
and lead to an even greater priest shortage in the Unit
ed States.
The Rev. James Martin, a U.S. Jesuit who has writ
ten on the issue, said American theologians, canon
lawyers and other Roman Catholics will "hope that
the document won't really mean what it says." But he
believes it's clear the Vatican wants to keep gay men
from being ordained — even if they're committed to
celibacy — and hopes bishops and seminary rectors
will act accordingly.
Martin predicted "a slow, silent attrition among celi
bate gay men who cannot accept the idea of staying in
an organization that condemns their existence in the
priesthood."
Matt Foreman of America's National Gay and Les
bian Task Force called the document "appalling," saying
it was an affront to thousands of gay priests. He accused
the Vatican of "a calculated campaign to blame gay men
for the church's own criminal conduct in fostering and
covering up decades of sex abuse."
The official "Instruction" from the Congregation
for Catholic Education was released a week after an
Italian Catholic news agency posted a leaked copy on
its Web site.
The document has been in the works for years, but its
existence came to light in 2002 at the height of the cler
gy sex abuse scandal in the United States. A study com
missioned by U.S. bishops found most abuse victims
since 1950 were adolescent boys.
Experts on sex offenders say homosexuals are no
more likely than heterosexuals to molest young peo
ple, but that did not stifle questions about gay semi
narians.
