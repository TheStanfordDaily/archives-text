"Beneath the Ice: Coring the Arctic Ocean
for Clues on Ancient Climate"
Dr. Kathryn Moran,
Professor of Ocean Engineering and Oceanography,
University of Rhode Island
Friday, December 2nd
4:00 pm
Room 105, Braun Hall,
Building 320, Stanford Qaud
Reception to follow in Hartley
Conference Center
Dr. Kathryn Moran, professor of ocean engineering and oceanography at the University of Rhode
Island, will discuss the exciting new findings from the 2004 Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) in a
free public lecture on December 2,2005. Cores collected from the Integrated Ocean Drilling
Program's ACEX mission are surprising many who believed the Arctic Ocean lacked sufficient
remains to record evidence of ancient climate. Now scientists are able to analyze Earth's previous
conditions by studying deep ocean floor sediments.
The ACEX cores were collected from the Lomonosov Ridge, a major submarine mountain chain
that extends 1,100 miles and ends about 155 miles south of the North Pole. The Arctic Coring
Expedition achieved a tremendous feat by withstanding the thick moving sea ice on the ocean's
surface while drilling in waters more than 4.000-feet deep. Prior to the 2004 ACEX mission, the
floor of the Arctic Ocean had never been penetrated for scientific drilling.
Some of the cores taken are as old as 80 million years. Analysis of the sediments has uncovered
clues about the Arctic Ocean's past. A particularly exciting find was a hunk of sediment dating from
55 million years ago that contained animal and plant microfossils. These organisms are
characteristic of subtropical waters, indicating the Arctic Ocean was once ice-free. In addition,
other cores were chock-full of organic material that some believe may indicate the region holds
significant oil and gas deposits.
This lecture is a partof the Joint Ocaanographic Institutions Distinguished Lecturer Series. Support is $
provided by JOi and the Stanford Oceans Group.
