Earth Systems 169/269:
Nuclear Power and Radioactive Waste Disposal
Professors Mike McWilliams and Marc Zand
In 2005, 441 commercial nuclear generating units operating around the world.
Renaissance in international nuclear power industry due to greenhouse gas emissions concerns
Lack of repositories for high-level radioactive waste hinders industry expansion
Despite transfer and disposal laws, DOE not yet accepted waste from commercial power generators.
Disposal by geological isolation is consensus solution for high-level waste by international community.
No permanent repository has yet been built
Remediation of environmental damage estimated to cost more than $400 billion in the U S alone
.come learn morell
Winter Quarter: MW, 1:15- 2:45 p.m. 3 units
