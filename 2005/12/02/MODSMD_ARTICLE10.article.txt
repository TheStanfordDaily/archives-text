GAUHATI, India (AP) — Dozens of
HIV-infected women stepped out of the
shadows in eastern India to acknowledge
they have the disease and say they should
not be shunned. China, in its marking of
World Aids Day, began an educational
campaign targeting millions of migrant
workers Thursday.
In Jakarta, the head of UNAIDS criti
cized Indonesia's leaders for not taking a
more active role in combatting the dis
ease, and thousands marched in anti-
AIDS rallies in India's plagued northeast,
including in Golaghat.a town in the east
ern state of Assam, where HIV-infected
women spoke publicly.
"I marched through the town with
more than 70 HIV-positive women like
me ... I'm happy many women have paid
heed to our call and have openly admitted
to their HIV-positive status,"said Jahnabi
Goswami,2B."Men with the disease need
to follow suit."
An estimated 5.1 million people are
living with HIV in India — the most in
any single country except South Africa.
India's sparsely populated northeast,
where heroin traffickers cross from
Myanmar, is considered a flashpoint be
cause of its high rate of infections among
intravenous drug users.
In New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmo
han Singh said Indians must overcome
traditional taboos attached to sex and dis
cuss AIDS more openly within families
and in public.
Australia on Thursday announced it
will spend $7.4 million over five years to
help India fight the virus in the northeast
region.
China also focused attention on the
disease by launching a campaign aimed at
some 120 million migrant workers, with
Chinese Central Television showing con

doms being passed out to workers at a
Beijing construction site.
"Because of this publicity. I really feel
I learned something about the harm of
AIDS and I will share what I learned with
my co-workers, friends and relatives," said
Li Hongjian, a young worker in a hard hat
and work clothes with a large red ribbon
pinned to his chest.
China's government estimates about
840,1 KM) people could be infected with
HIV and 80.000 others are likely to be liv
ing with full-blown AIDS. However, only
about 167.(KM) are registered as being in
fected.
UNAIDS has warned up to 10 million
could be infected in China by 2010 with
out more aggressive prevention.
The official China Daily newspaper
said injecting drug users now account for
the bulk of infections, followed by unclean
blood selling practices and unsafe sex.
In Jakarta, UNAIDS head Peter Piot
on'lTuirsday said Indonesia must do more
faster to prevent a major epidemic, a day
after he criticized leaders for not taking a
more active role in fighting the disease.
He urged President Susilo Bambang Yud
hoyono step up and take charge of the
campaign.
"There are small but significant and
rising AIDS epidemics, and this is the
time for Indonesia to scale up its response
to it," Piot said.
An estimated 150,000 to 250,000 peo
ple are infected in the sprawling archipel
ago. but the virus is spreading quickly
among injecting drug users, as well as sex
workers and their clients, he said.
Countries across Asia said more focus
must be placed on educating young peo
ple if the world has any chance of getting
a grip on the disease. An estimated 8.3
million people are living with HIV in
Asia, wi. f h 1.1 million newly infected last
year, UNAIDS said in a recent report.
"Twenty-five years into the pandemic,
this disease is becoming more visible in
Pakistan yet continues to have an invisi
ble face, a missing face, a young person's
face.This needs to change," UNICEF rep
resentative Omar Abdi said in a state

ment Wednesday.
While its nationwide infection rate re
mains low, Pakistan contains all the ingre
dients fora potential HIV explosion, in
cluding poverty, illiteracy, a sex industry
and injecting drug users, said Samia
Hashim, UNAIDS senior national pro
gram officer in the country.
In South Korea, nearly 10,(XX) students
at 300 high schools in Seoul were given
HIV lessons.
"In Korea,people tend to think AIDS
is a problem that has nothing to do with
them," said Cha Hei-sun of World Vision
Korea, which sponsored the event along
with the United Nation's Children's
Fund. "People's awareness of the disease
is really needed here."
North Korea on Thursday said none of
its people are infected with the disease,
but that some foreigners have tested
HIV-positive and have been sent home at
their request.
"Preventive measures against AIDS
have been taken so thoroughly that peo

ple are leading a happy life free from its
damage thanks to the public health policy
of the government," the communist
North's Minju Joson newspaper said in a
report carried by its official Korean Cen
tral News Agency.
Meanwhile, 24 million of condoms
were expected to be distributed in Thai
land to help raise awareness there, said
Public Health Minister Phinij Jarusom
bat.
In Vietnam, U.S. Ambassador Michael
Marine said Wednesday more emphasis
must be placed on making sure the mes
sage reaches children to keep the disease
from spreading into the general popula
tion.
"I think that education has to start
very young," he said.
So far, the disease in Vietnam remains
largely concentrated in high-risk groups,
such as injecting drug users and sex work
ers, but health workers fear the virus will
eventually spread to the general popula
tion and result in a major epidemic.
