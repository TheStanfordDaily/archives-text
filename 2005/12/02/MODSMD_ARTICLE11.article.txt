MONTGOMERY. Ala. (AP) — A Smithsonian In
stitution exhibit featuring a collage of photos, quotes
and historical text that chronicle the Montgomery bus
boycott goes on view this week as part of the 50th an
niversary celebration of the landmark protest.
The exhibit "381 Days: The Montgomery Bus Boy
cott Story" opens Friday and runs through Jan. 14 at the
state Capitol before moving to Alabama A&M Univer
sity in Huntsville,Feb.4 to April 6. It then starts a 14-city
national tour through 2009.
"It's an American story," said Marquette Folley,proj
ect director for the Smithsonian's traveling exhibitions.
"This story allows us to know that one individual stand
ing with commitment will be joined by many and to
gether we can start a revolution."
'The boycott began four days after Rosa Parks, a
black woman, was arrested Dec. 1.1955, for refusing to
give up her seat to a white man. Some 40,000 blacks took
part in the 381 -day protest, walking, car pooling and tak
ing cabs until a legal challenge ended the city's racially
segregated bus system.
Although Parks' arrest was the catalyst for the boy
cott, the exhibit also examines the contributions of the
many Montgomery blacks whose refusal to ride the bus
drained the city financially and drew national attention
to the emerging civil rights movement.
"The lynchpin of all of this is that people did it non
violently," said Ruth Rambo, associate state director of
AARP, which is underwriting the exhibit."lt was a ques
tion of looking at the finances of the city and seeing
where they can make a difference, and here we are with
more opportunities than we had 50 years ago."
The exhibit, with assistance from the Alabama His
torical Commission and Troy University's Rosa Parks
Library and Museum, will be celebrated Thursday with
an opening reception at the Capitol. Anniversary kick
off events Thursday also include an eight-block chil
dren's march to the Capitol from the downtown site
where Parks was arrested.
While Parks' arrest inspired the boycott, other black
women were the plaintiffs in the federal court lawsuit
— known as Browder vs. Gayle — that led to the U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that outlawed segregated public
transportation.
