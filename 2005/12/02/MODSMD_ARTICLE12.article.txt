## THAT'S A WRAP 
### 
Rojoz Gourmet Wraps
60 Town and Country Village
Wraps from $2.55 to $6.45

It's the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and
Betsy and I are driving to pick up Debz
from the airport. Betsy's car is small, but
three people and a few suitcases should fit fine.
We're almost to SJC when we get a call from
Debz. "Hey," he says."I met another guy from
Stanford here — can he get a ride too?"
Betsy responds in the affirmative, and I
readjust my ideas about the ride back. Four
people and at least that many suitcases? With
the trunk space, hopefully we'll still be okay...
We fight traffic at the airport and finally get
to the arrivals, where Debz and his Stanford
hitchhiker are waiting. We're surprised to see
Matt with them.
"I just landed!" he tells us."Can I get a ride
too?"
We then play a fun game called "How many
people can fit in Betsy's car?" Matt is about 7-
feet-11 and takes up more than his fair share of
the back seat. He also brings our suitcase count
up to seven. Every cubic foot of space in
Betsy's car is full of suitcase, backpack or
human body parts.
"Good to see everyone again," I say, my
voice muffled by Debz' duffel bag.
We celebrate our joyful reunion by arguing
about where to get dinner. Matt wants In-N-
Out, but I don't want to smell like grease for
the rest of the day. Taco Bell is my suggestion,
but Matt soundly vetoes it. As he is significant
ly bigger than me, we have to compromise.
Betsy drives to Rojoz wraps in Town and
Country. It was first recommended to us by a
native Palo Altan and remains a perennial fa
vorite among our cohort.
Much as 1 like wraps, I don't really under
stand the wraps phenomenon. Where I come
from, we have burritos and that's it. But wraps
are much more diverse. Places like Rojoz and
World Wrapps seem to put a whole meal into a
tortilla. One of the wraps at Rojoz even has
mashed potatoes in it. I'm boycotting World
Wrapps because I think their creative spelling
is stupid, but I'm happy to support Rojoz.
My favorite item at Rojoz is the "My Thai
Chicken" wrap. I'm having an emotional af
fair with peanut sauce, and that wrap delivers
it in abundance. Rojoz also has tons of vege
tarian wraps and a good number of Mexican
wraps. 1 like the "Holy Frijole" —a black
bean burrito for only $2.55. You can make any
wrap a Mambo combo, which means it comes
with rice, beans, chips and a drink for just
$1.55 more.
On any weekday at lunch, Rojoz is teeming
with Paly kids — a testament to the restau
rant's cheap and tasty fare. As long as there
isn't an entire high school there, service is
speedy. We wait less than five minutes for our
food.
Matt, characteristically, orders the most ex
pensive thing on the menu. His Bayou shrimp
wrap has, according to the menu, "more Cajun
kick than Mardi Gras." It wins Matt's approval.
"What did you get?" Debz asks me.
"The chicken curry wrap," I answer.
Debz reads part of its description off the
menu: "...tangy cabbage tops this Indian mas
terpiece." I le pauses. "Your wrap is an Indian
masterpiece!" he informs me.
"Rather like you," I tell him.
Debz's choice is the "Best O' Pesto" wrap,
which comes in a spinach tortilla.
"Why is your wrap green?" Betsy asks him.
"It's a Grinch roll-up," Debz tells her. mat
ter-of-factly.
Betsy shakes her head and returns to her
salad. I gaze around the restaurant. One wall is
covered with those posters that artistically
show every kind of chili pepper. On the other
wall, a bright mural's cartoon figures happily
munch wraps while staring down at the diners.
The walls of the bathroom are covered with
newspaper clippings and posters of Stanford
sports teams, some only a few years old.
Debz breaks my concentration, squirming
uncomfortably and flailing his right arm.
"Are you — what are you doing?" Betsy
asks him.
"I got a piece of rice down my sleeve!" he
explains. Then he sees me taking notes. "Don't
write about this!" he protests.
We finish our wraps right as the restaurant's
front lights dim — closing time. Debz, still
shaking food from his coat, follows us to the
car. Another successful meal at Rojoz.
The verdict:
For variety and price, Rojoz is a winner.
