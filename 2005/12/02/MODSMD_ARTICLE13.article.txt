112 hile California's natural land-
I 4 / scape is a paradise for rock
y \J climbing aficionados, Stanford's
fans of this adventure sport can now polish
their skills closer to home.
The recently constructed Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation boasts a new
climbing wall, inaugurated Oct. 17 with a
competition and official opening event.
According to Chris Elmore, staff man
ager and route setting manager of the wall,
the new facility is "vastly larger" than the
one in the DeGuerre Building, tucked
away between Avery Aquatic Center and
Angell Field.
"The wall has been gaining great popu
larity in our new location," Elmore says.
"People can now find the wall, whereas
previously you needed to hunt it down."
He notes that there have already been
350 new climbers at the wall in its first
month, compared to a total 550 climbers at
DeGuerre last year.
Indeed, students have demonstrated
strong interest in the wall exploration ses
sion scheduled for this Saturday, according
to Zhao Ying Pearline Teo, a community
associate in Escondido Village who organ
ized the event.The session will feature free
rentals and snacks, and instructors will
teach participants how to belay, or spot,
climbers.
The wall is typically open Monday
through Thursday from 3 to 10:45 p.m. and
Friday from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. But Elmore says
they "are looking at extending hours" next
quarter, "possibly to include weekends."
All Stanford students can climb the wall
for free. Shoe rentals normally cost $2, but
the fee can be waived on each student's
first visit.
Staff members are always available
when the wall is open to provide basic
climbing and belaying instruction. For
those who want a more structured learning
environment, the Athletic Department also
provides classes to climbers of all abilities.
And although the wall is exciting for
many novices, some experienced climbers
have a few complaints.
Sophomore Kali Albright, president of
Stanford's Climbing Club, says her "great
est disappointment was the lack of a steep
overhang, which means less difficult boul
dering [low-to-the-ground, ropeless climb
ing] than the old wall."
However, she adds that "the new rope
climbs are taller and some are steeper, of
fering opportunities for all skill levels."
Matt Farrell, president of Stanford's
Alpine Club who frequents the wall, also
says he has mixed feelings about the new

facility.
"The wall is adequate but too short and
small to be awesome," he says."It can't
hold a candle to off-campus climbing walls
in terms of the actual climbing."
Despite these complaints, Albright re
marks that "new climbers come to the wall

nearly every day."
"It's just fun," says senior Sherly
Chavarria, who recently had her first
climbing experience at Arrillaga. "It's not

a big investment to try something new."
According to Elmore, the wall was
built to accommodate climbers of all
ability levels. The wall has "plastic

holds" that can be arranged in different
patterns on various areas of the wall

to provide varying difficulty levels.
"We currently have around 2,(XM)
holds that wc nut un in the wall." he

says. "We have a team of setters
that constantly changes the
routes."

Elmore says the flexible and
fluid nature of the wall's holds al
lows "people who have never
climbed to the most experienced
climbers" to have fun.
"I went for the first time last
week. I had a great time," says
freshman T.J. Harris. "And I only
got one blister."

All Stanford students can climb the wall
for free. Shoe rentals normally cost $2, but
the fee can be waived on each student's
first visit.
Staff members are always available
when the wall is open to provide basic
climbing and belaying instruction. For
those who want a more structured learning
environment, the Athletic Department also
provides classes to climbers of all abilities.
And although the wall is exciting for
many novices, some experienced climbers
have a few complaints.
Sophomore Kali Albright, president of
Stanford's Climbing Club, says her "great
est disappointment was the lack of a steep
overhang, which means less difficult boul
dering [low-to-the-ground, ropeless climb
ing] than the old wall."
However, she adds that "the new rope
climbs are taller and some are steeper, of
fering opportunities for all skill levels."
Matt Farrell, president of Stanford's
Alpine Club who frequents the wall, also
says he has mixed feelings about the new

facility.
"The wall is adequate but too short and
small to be awesome," he says."It can't
hold a candle to off-campus climbing walls
in terms of the actual climbing."
Despite these complaints, Albright re
marks that "new climbers come to the wall

nearly every day."
"It's just fun," says senior Sherly
Chavarria, who recently had her first
climbing experience at Arrillaga. "It's not

a big investment to try something new."
According to Elmore, the wall was
built to accommodate climbers of all
ability levels. The wall has "plastic

holds" that can be arranged in different
patterns on various areas of the wall

to provide varying difficulty levels.
"We currently have around 2,(XM)
holds that wc nut un in the wall." he

says. "We have a team of setters
that constantly changes the
routes."

Elmore says the flexible and
fluid nature of the wall's holds al
lows "people who have never
climbed to the most experienced
climbers" to have fun.
"I went for the first time last
week. I had a great time," says
freshman T.J. Harris. "And I only
got one blister."
