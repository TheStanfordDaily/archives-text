# Grab cheese, a Hitchcock flick in the Castro

### MOLLY ROBERTS 
If you ask students what they're doing on
Halloween night at Stanford, they'll proba
bly give you one of three answers/ITie boring
students lock the door, forget about cos
tumes and study for midterms. The average
students throw a few things together fora
costume and trick or treat on the Row. And
the wild child Stanford students will tell you
they're headed to Castro Street.
With its infamous costumes and raging

parties, the only
time most Stan-

ford students en
counter the gay
center of San
Francisco is on

Halloween night.
Instead, I decide

to check out Castro
on an ordinary day. I

find a jewel of

San Francisco — unconventional and origi
nal, yet comfortable in its own skin.
My first stop is the well-known Castro
Theater. Outside, movie-goers squint as
they pile out of the dark into the Saturday
afternoon sunshine. Step inside and you'll
find a theater with gold-plated balconies.
Renaissance paintings and a domed roof. 1
ask the ticket salesman if any interesting
shows are coming up.
"No, not really," he says. "Just the normal
stuff."
Apparently, the ticket man and I have
different definitions of normal. My friend
and I gasp as we look at the movie poster for
the "Sing-a-long Sound of Music."
"800 the Nazis. Hiss the Baroness. Come
in a costume of your own invention!" the
sign reads. Quickly, we scribble down the
dates on our calendars and rush out the
door, planning who will dress as what.

Besides interactive musicals, you'll also
find old movies, independent films and in
ternational films plavine at the Castro

I.IUM p.OJUIg l>. M.W VIWIIU
Theater. Upcoming features in
clude Hitchcock's 1959 action
thriller "North by Northwest"
and a series of films directed by
David Lynch, whose works are
best described as "strange and
surreal" by critic Jared Rapfogel
in the online cinema journal.

Be sure to step into the
Castro Cheesery, next door to the
theater. Its main walls are covered
with two enormous menus — one
for Italian and other cheeses and
one for coffee.The espresso menu
contains an impressive 26 vari-

eties of coffee, including Hawaiian coconut
and dark chocolate truffle flavored espresso.
I order a marvelous mocha and make con
versation with a friendly barista.The Castro
Cheesery began selling cheese in the 1970s
and in the 1980s moved to the next logical
product....coffee.
A store just for coffee and cheese. Begin
ning to appreciate Castro's originality, 1 grab
my delicious drink and set off to explore the
rest of the district.
Gay men started moving to the Castro
area in the 19705, and the street now caters
to this community. Walk up Castro Street to
find all sorts of stops geared toward this
population, including men's clothing shops
and gay bars. The neighborhood also in
cludes record shops that sell music by gay
musicians.
I stop by Castro's A Different Light
Bookstore to peruse its distinctive collec
tion of writing. This independent shop fea
tures lesbian-gay-biscxual-t ransgender
questioning literature, including Jeffrey Eu
genide's fabulous "Middlesex" and history
books that highlight the lives of gay and les
bian luminaries. It shows its pride with large
rainbow flags and a sign that says "We the
People Say No to the Bush Agenda."
After walking up and down the street a
few times, I'm getting hungry. Restaurants
abound, but I'm drawn to a sign that reads
"Squat and Gobble," marking a crepery on
the corner of Harvey Milk Plaza. I walk in
and find an overwhelming menu of crepes,
omelettes, sandwiches and salads.
My friend and I order omelettes and sit
down. It doesn't take us long to notice that
we are the only women in the restaurant,but
no one else seems to find this ratio trou

bling. The restaurant has incredible service,
and after our omelettes we order a delicious
desert crepe.
Willi stores for coffee and cheese and
theaters featuring sing-;i long musicals, the
Castro is the perfect place to go if you are
looking fora break from the cookie-cutter
restaurants and stores in downtown Palo
Alto. Especially if you're the "boring" or
"average" student on Halloween night like
me, try not to cross the Castro off your list of
places to go tin an idle weekend. And if you
happen to be a wild child, trust me. this dis
trict's just as great in the sunlight.
