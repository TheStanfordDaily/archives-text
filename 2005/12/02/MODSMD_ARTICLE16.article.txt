## Editorial Bus service improved 
### 
Unknown to most students, the Mar
guerite has been undergoing dramat
ic changes that aim to make the bus
service significantly more accessible and
useful. Last spring. Parking and Transporta
tion Services finished implementing a wire
less network that tracks the real-time status
of all running Marguerite shuttles and al
lows passengers to view this information on
line from the comfort of home (at
http://transportation.stanford.edu). Future
improvements, including information
screens at Marguerite stops with real-time
campus feeds, are also in the works.
We commend the University for taking
steps to better fit the Marguerite to the
needs and lives of students. Being able to see
online where buses are currently located is a
significant improvement over waiting at a
stop indefinitely, and students are more like
ly to use the Marguerite if they know that
they won't be stuck waiting fora bus for the
length of time the trip itself would take by
bike or foot.
Further, once this information becomes

available at Marguerite stops via comput
erized signs, students will be able to tell just
by walking past a stop whether it is worth
their while to wait. It is these kinds of
changes that make University services
more flexible and efficient and that best
help students. We are glad to see the Uni
versity making use of technology for this
purpose.
We would also like to encourage the ad
ministration to publicize improvements of
this sort more thoroughly to the student
body. While some efforts were made, many
students remain unaware of the real-time
tracking system available online, though it
has been in place for several months.
Perhaps more direct forms of advertising
these changes — such as e-mails to dorm
chat lists or large notices on the exterior of
Marguerite buses — would better spread
the news. Using technology to improve exist
ing services is only half the task — to be
truly useful, these changes must be accom
panied by efforts to make them more acces
sible to the student body.
