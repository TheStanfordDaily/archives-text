# Farewell, Kennell
## 
### 
Stanford University lost a beloved facul
ty member and resident fellow during
Thanksgiving break when Kennell
Jackson, professor of African history and the
resident fellow in Branner Hall, passed away
from pulmonary fibrosis.
Jackson was inspiring both personally and
professionally. Educated in segregated
schools in the south before earning a bache
lor's degree from Hampton University, he
went on to earn his doctorate at UCLA after
studying at the University of Ghana and
Cambridge University.
Jackson leaves behind a pioneering lega
cy at Stanford, especially for his research on
the history and culture of East Africa. He
served as the director for the Program in
African and African American Studies from
1980 to 1989.
Further. Jackson began teaching a semi
nar on the subject of black hair in the early
19905. Derided as being unfit for academic
study when it was first introduced, the topic
has since become widely recognized as im
portant to academia — due in no small part
to Jackson's efforts.
Closer to Stanford, Jackson also had a
major impact on residential campus life. He
instituted the first-ever Faculty Night in 1970
while he was the RF in Serra. That tradition
has since become a quarterly institution in
nearly every freshman dorm on campus.

Perhaps his most tangible influence on stu
dents' lives was the result of his work as the
Branner RF, a position he held for 25 years.
Jackson oversaw Branner during many of its
years as the biggest — and. if reputation
holds, wildest — all-freshman dorm on cam
pus. In Branner alone, 4approximately ,(MX)
current and former students had Jackson as
their RF: this number does not even include
the many others with whom he had daily con
tact while serving as Serra's RF for nine
years. Since Branner will probably be con
verted to upperclass housing in the near fu
ture as part of the imminent undergraduate
housing overhaul Jackson guided Branner in
its final years as the ultimate all-frosh dorm.
Many students can appreciate the reach
of Jackson's impact on the University
through this observation: In 1985, when
Dean Julie LythcoU-Haims lived in Branner
her freshman year (and again when she was
a Branner RA during her junior and senior
years), it was none other than Jackson who
was her RF.
Jackson's wit, commitment to academia
and passion for the University will be
missed. Individuals who wish to share how
Jackson touched their lives can go to
http://kennell-jackson.memory-of.com, the
memorial Web site created in his honor. A
service will be held in Memorial Church in
January.
