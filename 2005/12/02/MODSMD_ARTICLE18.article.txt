# Athlete pack phenomenon
## 
### 
Question: Why are athletes like rocks,
lions and piranhas? Answer: If suffi
ciently warned, you can probably deal
witn individuals, but if large quantities are
dropped on your head, invited into your dorm
or let loose in your bath tub, they become very
dangerous.
One gymnast doing cardio at Arrillaga
doesn't cause much of a fuss, but an entire
team of them all hitting the ellipticals at one
time makes fora pretty long and grumpy line
of would-be exercisers waiting for machines.
A single swimmer can put away a good-sized
quantity of food, but if the entire swim team
decides to sup at your eating club... well, you'd
better get there before 5:59, or your chances
of getting anything but cereal and ramen for
dinner are slim. A solitary basketball player
blends pretty well into the frat party scene,
but accidentally stumbling into an entire
flock of them in a dark corner of Kappa Sig
can give you Alice in Wonderland nightmares
for weeks.
Why do athletes clump the way they do? Is
it just to intimidate people? Some sort of "the
team that eats, drinks, studies, dances and
roller skates together wins together" thing?
Maybe.
One possible theory emerged by way of
dance floor encounter. A fairly smart, but not
all-that-wise techie came up to Cassidy at a
frat party and said. "I wouldn't mind being a
babe magnet where I am positively polarized,
and you'd be negatively polarized, and thus,
since opposites attract and like poles repel. I'd
have everything I could ever need, namely
you."
There's no doubt about it, pickup lines and
high school physics lectures make odd bedfel
lows. Cassidy found the combination less than
scintillating and made a hasty escape by latch
ing on to a chain of 11 freshmen head-butting
their way across the dance floor to the bath
room. Anyway, back to the point, or at least
the convoluted path that may lead to some
thing resembling the point. The fact that
Timmy the polarized babe magnet needed
some work in the coolness department does
n't mean his argument, scientifically, at least,
didn't have some merit. After all, a guy who
could use that many big words in a sentence
and still bob enthusiastically (albeit unrhyth
mically) to "Get Low" probably knew what
he was talking about.

So is the athlete pack phenomenon the re
sult of some magnetic force among team
mates? Probably not. At least Cassidy got to
brag about being hit on at a party.
But then where exactly does this bond
originate? Perhaps it is propagated by some
ritualistic initiation to the team. Strictly speak
ing. initiations and all other hazing activities
are banned by both the NCAA and Stanford.
But let's be honest, if this rule was taken that
seriously, then why do we see a steady stream
of freshmen traipsing around campus in their
spandex shorts, puff-painted T-shirts and
sparkling fairy wings? We could just be read
ing the situation wrong. Fashion moves pretty
fast, and believe it or not, neither of us read
every issue of Vogue cover to cover. Maybe we
missed the memo that purple tights and feath
er boas are what the cool kids are wearing
these days. Or maybe it was laundry day, and
that was all they had left. That's probably it.
Which means we need another theory.
Could it be the matching gear? After all,
you've got to admit that seeing any team all
decked out in their finest Stanford apparel can
be at least a little intimidating, especially if it's
the basketball, volleyball or even the fencing
team (they've got weapons). Maybe the confi
dence derived from this intimidating strut has
some sort of bonding power.
The athlete pack phenomenon is indeed a
mystery that could make Nancy Drew shud
der. But not to worry, friends — from the evi
dence at hand and our eloquent powers of
rhetorical analysis, it is clear that it's not the
animal magnetism or suspect team bonding
activities. Perhaps it's the spirit of camaraderie
inspired by a common love of excellence in
athleticism. No. it's got to be the gear. Thanks,

So is the athlete pack phenomenon the re
sult of some magnetic force among team
mates? Probably not. At least Cassidy got to
brag about being hit on at a party.
But then where exactly does this bond
originate? Perhaps it is propagated by some
ritualistic initiation to the team. Strictly speak
ing. initiations and all other hazing activities
are banned by both the NCAA and Stanford.
But let's be honest, if this rule was taken that
seriously, then why do we see a steady stream
of freshmen traipsing around campus in their
spandex shorts, puff-painted T-shirts and
sparkling fairy wings? We could just be read
ing the situation wrong. Fashion moves pretty
fast, and believe it or not, neither of us read
every issue of Vogue cover to cover. Maybe we
missed the memo that purple tights and feath
er boas are what the cool kids are wearing
these days. Or maybe it was laundry day, and
that was all they had left. That's probably it.
Which means we need another theory.
Could it be the matching gear? After all,
you've got to admit that seeing any team all
decked out in their finest Stanford apparel can
be at least a little intimidating, especially if it's
the basketball, volleyball or even the fencing
team (they've got weapons). Maybe the confi
dence derived from this intimidating strut has
some sort of bonding power.
The athlete pack phenomenon is indeed a
mystery that could make Nancy Drew shud
der. But not to worry, friends — from the evi
dence at hand and our eloquent powers of
rhetorical analysis, it is clear that it's not the
animal magnetism or suspect team bonding
activities. Perhaps it's the spirit of camaraderie
inspired by a common love of excellence in
athleticism. No. it's got to be the gear. Thanks,

Question: Why are athletes like rocks,
lions and piranhas? Answer: If suffi
ciently warned, you can probably deal
witn individuals, but if large quantities are
dropped on your head, invited into your dorm
or let loose in your bath tub, they become very
dangerous.
One gymnast doing cardio at Arrillaga
doesn't cause much of a fuss, but an entire
team of them all hitting the ellipticals at one
time makes fora pretty long and grumpy line
of would-be exercisers waiting for machines.
A single swimmer can put away a good-sized
quantity of food, but if the entire swim team
decides to sup at your eating club... well, you'd
better get there before 5:59, or your chances
of getting anything but cereal and ramen for
dinner are slim. A solitary basketball player
blends pretty well into the frat party scene,
but accidentally stumbling into an entire
flock of them in a dark corner of Kappa Sig
can give you Alice in Wonderland nightmares
for weeks.
Why do athletes clump the way they do? Is
it just to intimidate people? Some sort of "the
team that eats, drinks, studies, dances and
roller skates together wins together" thing?
Maybe.
One possible theory emerged by way of
dance floor encounter. A fairly smart, but not
all-that-wise techie came up to Cassidy at a
frat party and said. "I wouldn't mind being a
babe magnet where I am positively polarized,
and you'd be negatively polarized, and thus,
since opposites attract and like poles repel. I'd
have everything I could ever need, namely
you."
There's no doubt about it, pickup lines and
high school physics lectures make odd bedfel
lows. Cassidy found the combination less than
scintillating and made a hasty escape by latch
ing on to a chain of 11 freshmen head-butting
their way across the dance floor to the bath
room. Anyway, back to the point, or at least
the convoluted path that may lead to some
thing resembling the point. The fact that
Timmy the polarized babe magnet needed
some work in the coolness department does
n't mean his argument, scientifically, at least,
didn't have some merit. After all, a guy who
could use that many big words in a sentence
and still bob enthusiastically (albeit unrhyth
mically) to "Get Low" probably knew what
he was talking about.

So is the athlete pack phenomenon the re
sult of some magnetic force among team
mates? Probably not. At least Cassidy got to
brag about being hit on at a party.
