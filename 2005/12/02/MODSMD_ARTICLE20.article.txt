UAT J hat should 1 do with my life?"
\/V/ Google that. Hit the "I'm feel
▼ Y ing lucky" button. We stooped
this low after a Thanksgiving of lying to rela
tives and friends about our future plans. We
didn't actually read the article that came up,
but really we think that the bold section
headings pulled from the article say it all. All
we ever needed to know.
It's time to define the new era
The New Era (n.) — 2006. The year we
leave the nest.The object of all our terror and
hope. And the Chinese Year of the Red Dog.
We only have a month of feverish planning
before it is upon us. There are only two op
tions really.The Carter Development Center
and psychics. Or both.
MONEY doesn't fund dreams
But it does fund psychic readings. Any
Stanford student who's trekked to the El
Camino Safeway has seen the neon signs ad
vertising Madam Katherine's tarot and
palm readings. We rang the doorbell. Again
and again. We had an appointment. She was
a psychic. Mow could she not know we had
arrived and were waiting for her? Standing
on her stoop, we wondered how long we
were willing to wait to know the truth about
our futures.
The full spread costs $55 — palm reading.

tarot cards and financial portfolio advice. But
for $25. Madam Katherine did offer to tell
Miri about her past, present and future.
Mostly the present, actually. She told Miri
about her worries, problems, fears and diffi
culties. At least,she used those words a lot. In
her soft, distracted, mysteriously accented
(was that Spanish or Vietnamese?) voice,
Miri's situation began to sound direr than
ever imagined. But it would all pass quickly,
Madam Katherine assured her. The broken
love of her past, her losses and hardships
would give way to a profitable career, a life
long marriage, two kids and over 80 years in
which to enjoy them. Miri would be success
ful in the arts, Fridays were her lucky days,
odds her lucky numbers and she would meet
a nice young man soon — $25, and cheap at
the price.
SMARTS can't answer the question
The CDC will give you free tests that

point to futures in speech pathology or
floristry or athletic training — at least that's
what the center told Robin. Its handout for
liberal arts careers curiously lacked any men
tion of real careers. But it did suggest you
check out books with titles like "Zen and the
Art of Making a Living" and "What Color is
Your Parachute?" No doubt these books
were written by starving liberal artists, eking
out a living selling the generic fantasy of a
successful future to their academic heirs.
If we knew what color our parachutes
were, maybe we wouldn't be asking silly
questions. Our parachute is spotted from all
the holes in our knowledge of the world. We
will go skydiving out of the Stanford air
plane, with only our holey parachutes to sup
port us and our communication skills to pad
us as we plummet to earth weighed down by
all the glossy handouts we've picked up be
cause we didn't know what else to do.
On the way down, we will scan the tiny
print on the graphs, hoping to find the statis
tic on how likely we are to die in a parachut
ing accident and the list of possible careers in
the afterlife. Lord and Savior. Professional
haunter. Punisher of sinners. Walker of Cer
berus and grass-waterer in the Elysian Fields.
The numbers and bars will swarm before our
eyes and we won't be able to help wondering

if the tests are really that much more
accurate than a tarot card reading.
PLACE defines you
We should have known we
wouldn't find answers. Facts are slip
pery things, and at a university like
ours — in departments like ours —
they are downright naive. We came
to college expecting definitive
knowledge, but instead we've found
"frameworks" for "ongoing explo
ration." More and more, college
seems like a stone framework for
asking again and again, "What am I
supposed to do with my life?"
ATTITUDE is the biggest obstacle
At least we've learned to make

up the answers when we need to.
We've learned to assimilate, beg,
borrow and steal. Which is why, next
week, we're giving up the columnist
thing and you can find us at the new
Center for the Advancement of Bal
ance and Grace. Madam Katherine
charged $25 fora 15-minute reading.
That's $100 an hour. We, too, could
be psychics. Pick up a few mystical
figurines, magic crystal balls and an
exceptionally worn set of playing
cards. Put all those transferable com
munication skills that the CDC kept
crowing about to good use. Then we,
too, could tell college students and
suburbanites exactly what they want
to hear about their futures. Or
rather, exactly what we wanted to
hear about ours.

Feeling lucky? We have no current
plans for Friday the 9th. E-mail us at
