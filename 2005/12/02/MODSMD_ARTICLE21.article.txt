## NAACP protests Williams death sentence 
### YURITZI JONES 
The letters that fill his inbox exude grati
tude and appreciation for his uplifting and
motivational words of wisdom. His life story
is proof that redemption is possible and per
haps provides that small ray of hope for
many young men and women trapped in a
life of crime and drugs. A motivational
speaker and author of nine books
in addition to an autobiography, this well-es
tablished man has received nation-wide ac
claim and has been nominated four times for
the Nobel Peace Prize.
But what good is an award, praise, fame or
respect when you are confined to a prison
cell with an execution date only days away?
In recent weeks, Stanley "Tookie"
Williams has been the topic of hot debate.
Co-founder of the infamous Crips street
gang, Williams is on death row in San
Quentin State Prison, convicted of four mur
ders that occurred more than 20 years ago.
Williams has offered a public apology for
harming others in his past and now encour
ages young adults to lead clean lives.
Williams has made amends for his previ

ous lifestyle by influencing others to turn
away from gangs and crime and inspiring
young minds to focus on bettering them
selves and their community. In doing this,
Williams has saved countless lives — lives
that would have been lost to the mean streets.
What Williams needs now is for someone
to save his own life.
With an execution date set for Dec. 13,
Williams — along with his supporters — is
waiting on word from Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger, in hopes that he will grant
clemency. Williams' advocates are scamper
ing to gain as much support as possible in an
effort to persuade Schwarzenegger to grant
clemency.
Williams' supporters argue that prosecu
tors were never able to prove that Williams
had indeed committed the murders and that
their case was supported merely by circum
stantial evidence.
In light of this, the question at present is
how can the courts, the governor, the state of
California and we the people consent to the
execution of a now-redeemed man who may
not even be guilty of the alleged murders?
The National Association for the Ad

vanccment of Colored People (NAACP) has
pledged to take action to save Williams' life.
In considering this man's accomplishments
and positive impact on young people nation
wide, we view our stance to save Williams'
life not as a choice, hut as an obligation.
TTie NAACP chapter here on campus is
responding to the call for action by hosting a
number of events next week to publicize the
issue and to rally support. Chapter members
will participate in a die-in next Thursday,
which is the day Schwarzenegger is sched
uled to hear Williams' clemency petition. The
NAACP encourages everyone to wear all
black on this day to express support for
Williams, rhere is also an online petition,
available for anyone to sign, asking the gov
ernor to grant clemency to Williams. It can be
found at www.savetookie.org.
We cannot sit out on this issue — a man's
life is on the line. The NAACP strongly op
poses the death penalty because of its unfair
and disproportionate use on minorities. For
those who support the death penalty and feel
Williams should be executed, remember that
under the U.S. legal system, every
man is assumed innocent until
proven otherwise — and inTookie's
case it has yet to proven otherwise.
The NAACP encourages every
one to support Tookie Williams. At
tend upcoming events, sign the peti
tion, e-mail the governor — do
something. If we cannot open our
hearts to a man who denounces his
evils ways and embraces what is
good, how can we in turn ever expect
to he forgiven by others for our own
wrongdoings?

Williams' supporters argue that prosecu
tors were never able to prove that Williams
had indeed committed the murders and that
their case was supported merely by circum
stantial evidence.
In light of this, the question at present is
how can the courts, the governor, the state of
California and we the people consent to the
execution of a now-redeemed man who may
not even be guilty of the alleged murders?
The National Association for the Ad

vanccment of Colored People (NAACP) has
pledged to take action to save Williams' life.
In considering this man's accomplishments
and positive impact on young people nation
wide, we view our stance to save Williams'
life not as a choice, hut as an obligation.
TTie NAACP chapter here on campus is
responding to the call for action by hosting a
number of events next week to publicize the
issue and to rally support. Chapter members
will participate in a die-in next Thursday,
which is the day Schwarzenegger is sched
uled to hear Williams' clemency petition. The
NAACP encourages everyone to wear all
black on this day to express support for
Williams, rhere is also an online petition,
available for anyone to sign, asking the gov
ernor to grant clemency to Williams. It can be
found at www.savetookie.org.
We cannot sit out on this issue — a man's
life is on the line. The NAACP strongly op
poses the death penalty because of its unfair
and disproportionate use on minorities. For
those who support the death penalty and feel
Williams should be executed, remember that
under the U.S. legal system, every
man is assumed innocent until
proven otherwise — and inTookie's
case it has yet to proven otherwise.
The NAACP encourages every
one to support Tookie Williams. At
tend upcoming events, sign the peti
tion, e-mail the governor — do
something. If we cannot open our
hearts to a man who denounces his
evils ways and embraces what is
good, how can we in turn ever expect
to he forgiven by others for our own
wrongdoings?
