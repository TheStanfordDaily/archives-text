Author's response to criticism
or article bias
1 appreciate Jeremy Lorber's let
ter that states it is unfair to the
Daily's readership for the paper not
to have disclosed that I am co-presi
dent of the group that organized
Robert Fisk's speech on Nov. 20. In
fact, the article I originally submitted
made a point of stating at the bottom
my position in the organization. It
was subsequently edited out by The
Daily.
In truth,The Daily only accepted
my article because it was unable to
get one of its own writers to cover
Fisk's talk, which occurred over
Thanksgiving break.
Seeing as Robert Fisk is Britain's
most highly decorated foreign corre
spondent. The Daily agreed that the
event was important to publicize to
the Stanford community. Thus, I
wrote the article with the journalistic
intent to summarize Fisk's major
points, many of which I believed
were memorable and of interest to
the wider Stanford community. I also
wrote the article in The Daily with
the aim of promoting greater dia
logue on campus about several im

portant issues raised in his talk, in
cluding the relevance of history, the
role of journalism and the attendant
duties and obligations of democratic
citizenship.
It is unfair for Lorber to assume
that being the leader of an organiza
tion means that you cannot be objec
tive when writing about its events.
My article deserved publication â€”
but, as he says, he should have been
accompanied by the full disclosure of
my position in the organization, so
that readers could decide for them
selves how to appraise my journalis
tic integrity.
