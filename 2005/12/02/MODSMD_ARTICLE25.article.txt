"It's a great honor," Akinradewo said. "I came out
just trying to contribute to the team in any way I could.
Hopefully, I can keep up the good work for the team.
It's nice to know people are recognizing the hard work
we're putting into this."
The Cardinal host the Nevada Wolf Pack (18-12,10-
6 Western Athletic Conference) tonight at Maples
Pavilion in the first round of the tournament. Tonight's
winner will then play either Sacramento State (26-8,13-
1 Big Sky Conference) or No. 15 Santa Clara (23-4,12-2
West Coast Conference) in a second-round match to
morrow at Stanford.
Should the team get through the first two rounds, the
Cardinal (25-5, 14-4 Pac-10) advance to the NCAA Re
gional at Stanford next weekend and will most likely
meet fellow Pac-10 powerhouses USC and No. 6 Arizona.
The Cardinal defeated the Wolf Pack 3-2 in the final
match of last season's SBC/Sands Regional in Reno,
Nev. Richards collected 24 kills and 15 digs, while four
players other contributed double-digit digs for Stan
ford.

nals of the WAC tournament last Friday. The Wolf
Pack's Salaia Salave a.a senior middle blocker, collect
ed a match-high 20 kills as Nevada hit .207 collectively.

Salave'a leads the Wolf Pack's at
tack this season, averaging just
under four kills per game fora .293
percentage. Johnson, meanwhile, is
averaging .304 for the season. As a
team, Nevada is hitting .229 and
limiting opponents to .187.
Although Stanford head coach
John Dunning had not finalized the
lineup as of last night, he foresaw
sophomore Bryhn Kehoe return
ing to play for the first time since
she injured her hand in practice
early last month. Kehoe. who was
cleared by doctors last Tliesday,
could look for limited defensive
play in the back row. Senior Katie
Goldhahn should continue to set
the Cardinal's offense, as Kehoe
has not yet been cleared to block,
hit or serve.

Even without a set lineup. Dun
ning and many players said the
team is adjusting well to the post
season mentality.
"Our team is so focused right
now," Richards said. "We have a
goal, to get to San Antonio [for the
2005 NCAA Final Four]. We're
driven and excited. So long as we
improve on what we've been work
ing on — blocking and running a
solid offense — we have a good
chance of making it there."
Dunning added that the team
will continue to focus on its season
long goal of improving until the
last day — something that could
help lead Stanford to its second
straight national title.
"This is the most focused we've
been all year," he said. "When
you're playing a very good team in
a very good setting fora very cool
prize, that's when you have the
chance to be your best. That's how
you are judged as a player, and
that's what gets us excited."
