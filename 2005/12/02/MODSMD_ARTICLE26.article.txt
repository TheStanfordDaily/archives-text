# Andrew Rogers
## PE water polo: The joys of the deck change 
### 
BAM! BAM! BAM! My door's being
beat down. "Go away. Andrew's not
here right now," comes my response.
It is 10:45 a.m. on TUesday, and I've had
more beers than hours of sleep the night
before. (What? It was a rough Monday...)
BAM! BAM! BAM! Here it comes
again.
"Rogers, it's time for PE water polo,"
Pat Keelin bellows from the other side of
my fortress of solitude. "Get your ass out
of bed."
Sweet! PE water polo! While it normal
ly takes a forklift and a fire alarm to get me
out of bed, I spring into action because I m
heading to my favorite class. Avery, here I
come.
So we pile into the car (hey, I said I was
excited about getting in the water — that
doesn't change the fact that I'm still hung
over). We're usually about 5-7 minutes late
everyday, but Brian Inouye (the driver and
reason we're normally late) keeps saying
that it is by design as most of the work to set
up the pool is done by the time we roll in.
As we waltz in late, we get a strange
look from Susan Ortwein, the assistant
women's coach and our "instructor"
for the quarter. I use the term lightly
because basically all she does is call
the fouls and threaten that if we get
her wet, we fail. Everyone else is in
the pool warming up, so we execute a
quick deck change and join the pre
game ritual.
For those of you who didn't use
chlorine as cologne growing up, a
deck change is exactly what it sounds
like. You change on the pool deck,
using your towel to hide your butt
and other special parts from view.
Normally, it's executed flawlessly, but
it's not a perfect system. Let's just say
that I'm glad it's an athletic class that
already requires some semblance of
fitness. God help us if we had to deck
change in a weight loss class.
Okay, after we're in our sexy
Speedos, we're into the pool. Warm
up usually consists of lap swimming,
passing and shooting to get loose.
People start practicing real game sit
uations. For example, I repeatedly
work on my victory dance after I
score wide open in front of the goal
with no goalie. Hey, it's advanced
water polo, not advanced maturity.
Teams are divided into white and
blue. There are usually anywhere

from between 8-12 people per team.
It's a coed class, so guys and girls play
alongside one another and the gen
ders are equally divided. This is par
ticularly excellent because it saves
me half the embarrassment of being
outclassed by girls who are stronger,
faster and better than me. At least
half of them are on my team...
Water polo's a lot like soccer in its
set-up. Two big differences: I) You
use your hands instead of your feet;
and 2) You're in the water. The six
field players and one goalie start 30
meters apart in a men's game. Since
we're all pretty much boys, with the
exception of the aforementioned
healthier girls, we play a 20 meter
field. (Shut up, you're not out there!)
For the first few points of the
game, there's hustle and drive and
spirit. After everyone's done trying
to be a hero, the game relaxes and
the comedy sets in. I usually spend
more time under water than above it
(remember, this is my favorite class
— what does that say about the rest
of my schedule). There's a lot of trash
talking, a lot of laughing and general
ly a lot of asking when the next sub
stitution will be.
Recently the game has adopted a
Harlem Globetrotters feel to it, as
players are starting to swim the
length of the pool under water and
pop up in front of the opposing goal.
The other day, a player on my team
swam with the ball underwater be

tween his legs until he got to the of
fensive end. While I was busy yelling
at him to spread out and give me
space to operate, he popped the ball
out from between his legs and into
my hand. As surprised as I was, it
must have really thrown the goalie
fora loop because he was off enough
to let me score my third goal of the
season (one better than my room
mate Peter Finlayson, who is on the
real water polo team and only has
two on the year. BOOYA!)
All joking aside, the players be
come quite hardcore when there is
something worth playing for.
Whichever team scores the final goal
gets to get out of the pool and dry off
while the loser has to move the goal
back to big boy pool size and collect
all the balls and caps. All the wheez
ing, cramping and gulping disap
pears for one last drive to the finish.
When it's all said and done, 1
labor to hoist myself halfway out of
the pool and flop onto the deck. I
deck change again and head home,
grab some lunch and go to my room.
And then comes the best news of the
day: my only other class has been
canceled. 1 return to bed,.satisfied by
my productive morning and still
nursing a hangover.

Andrew Rogers is a senior who aspires
to eventually make the National Water
Polo Team. Wish him luck at

mate Peter Finlayson, who is on the
real water polo team and only has
two on the year. BOOYA!)
All joking aside, the players be
come quite hardcore when there is
something worth playing for.
Whichever team scores the final goal
gets to get out of the pool and dry off
while the loser has to move the goal
back to big boy pool size and collect
all the balls and caps. All the wheez
ing, cramping and gulping disap
pears for one last drive to the finish.
When it's all said and done, 1
labor to hoist myself halfway out of
the pool and flop onto the deck. I
deck change again and head home,
grab some lunch and go to my room.
And then comes the best news of the
day: my only other class has been
canceled. 1 return to bed,.satisfied by
my productive morning and still
nursing a hangover.

Andrew Rogers is a senior who aspires
to eventually make the National Water
Polo Team. Wish him luck at
arogers@stanford. edu.
BAM! BAM! BAM! My door's being
beat down. "Go away. Andrew's not
here right now," comes my response.
It is 10:45 a.m. on TUesday, and I've had
more beers than hours of sleep the night
before. (What? It was a rough Monday...)
BAM! BAM! BAM! Here it comes
again.
"Rogers, it's time for PE water polo,"
Pat Keelin bellows from the other side of
my fortress of solitude. "Get your ass out
of bed."
Sweet! PE water polo! While it normal
ly takes a forklift and a fire alarm to get me
out of bed, I spring into action because I m
heading to my favorite class. Avery, here I
come.
So we pile into the car (hey, I said I was
excited about getting in the water — that
doesn't change the fact that I'm still hung
over). We're usually about 5-7 minutes late
everyday, but Brian Inouye (the driver and
reason we're normally late) keeps saying
that it is by design as most of the work to set
up the pool is done by the time we roll in.
As we waltz in late, we get a strange
look from Susan Ortwein, the assistant
women's coach and our "instructor"
for the quarter. I use the term lightly
because basically all she does is call
the fouls and threaten that if we get
her wet, we fail. Everyone else is in
the pool warming up, so we execute a
quick deck change and join the pre
game ritual.
For those of you who didn't use
chlorine as cologne growing up, a
deck change is exactly what it sounds
like. You change on the pool deck,
using your towel to hide your butt
and other special parts from view.
Normally, it's executed flawlessly, but
it's not a perfect system. Let's just say
that I'm glad it's an athletic class that
already requires some semblance of
fitness. God help us if we had to deck
change in a weight loss class.
Okay, after we're in our sexy
Speedos, we're into the pool. Warm
up usually consists of lap swimming,
passing and shooting to get loose.
People start practicing real game sit
uations. For example, I repeatedly
work on my victory dance after I
score wide open in front of the goal
with no goalie. Hey, it's advanced
water polo, not advanced maturity.
Teams are divided into white and
blue. There are usually anywhere

from between 8-12 people per team.
It's a coed class, so guys and girls play
alongside one another and the gen
ders are equally divided. This is par
ticularly excellent because it saves
me half the embarrassment of being
outclassed by girls who are stronger,
faster and better than me. At least
half of them are on my team...
Water polo's a lot like soccer in its
set-up. Two big differences: I) You
use your hands instead of your feet;
and 2) You're in the water. The six
field players and one goalie start 30
meters apart in a men's game. Since
we're all pretty much boys, with the
exception of the aforementioned
healthier girls, we play a 20 meter
field. (Shut up, you're not out there!)
For the first few points of the
game, there's hustle and drive and
spirit. After everyone's done trying
to be a hero, the game relaxes and
the comedy sets in. I usually spend
more time under water than above it
(remember, this is my favorite class
— what does that say about the rest
of my schedule). There's a lot of trash
talking, a lot of laughing and general
ly a lot of asking when the next sub
stitution will be.
Recently the game has adopted a
Harlem Globetrotters feel to it, as
players are starting to swim the
length of the pool under water and
pop up in front of the opposing goal.
The other day, a player on my team
swam with the ball underwater be

tween his legs until he got to the of
fensive end. While I was busy yelling
at him to spread out and give me
space to operate, he popped the ball
out from between his legs and into
my hand. As surprised as I was, it
must have really thrown the goalie
fora loop because he was off enough
to let me score my third goal of the
season (one better than my room
mate Peter Finlayson, who is on the
real water polo team and only has
two on the year. BOOYA!)
