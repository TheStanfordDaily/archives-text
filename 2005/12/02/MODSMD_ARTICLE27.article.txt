Las Vegas, NV

and at the Central Missouri Open.The Cardinal hope
that the Las Vegas Invitational provides the opportu
nity for another step in the right direction against na
tionally respected opponents.
"There are going to be four or five of the top teams
in the country there," Stanford head coach Kerry
McCoy said. "So we're getting a chance to establish
ourselves. We've had chances to face Missouri and
some second-tier teams, and now we'll be able to face
some of the other top-tier teams. It will give us a
chance to see where we measure up against the rest of
the country."
In a season that has been up-and-down so far,
there have nevertheless been a few Cardinal
wrestlers who have been remarkably consistent in
their victories. Among them are team-captains Ray
Blake, a 165-pound senior, and sophomore Tanner
Gardner at 125 pounds. There can be no doubt re
garding the positive influence they've had on their
teammates and the Cardinal's season.
"1 think it gives [the team] a lot of motivation, be
cause they're two leaders â€” captains on the team,"
McCoy said. "They're going out there and setting the
tone for the rest of the team. It also gives them a little
extra fire because no one wants to be out-done, no
one wants to get out worked. So everyone's inspired
to try and reach the level they've reached."
TTieir leadership should be a continued positive
for the Cardinal (1-1) as the year progresses. As for
facing Las Vegas, the team is eager for another chance
to build momentum as the season gets started.
"We're hoping to place a lot of guys and wrestle
well," said sophomore Phil Doerner, a heavyweight.
"We've been wrestling pretty well throughout the sea
son but didn't do as well as we expected in Fullerton
[at the Cal Open], so we're just hoping to improve."
Doerner, like his coach, knows that level of com
petition Stanford is scheduled to face continues to
grow.
"There are going to be a lot of good teams," Do
erner said. "It's a really big tournament usually, and
there's a lot of tough competition. 1 know the num
ber one ranked heavyweight is going to be there."
The Las Vegas Invitational represents,to some de-
gree, the beginning of the end of
early season events. These are most
ly geared towards preparing for the
bulk of the schedule, which begins
after Winter Break. While not taking
the events for granted, the team is
looking forward to the upcoming
challenges and to the action heating
up.
"I think everyone's ready to get
to the heart of the season," freshman
Eric Minnick said. "I know I prefer
competing rather than practicing. So
anytime I get a chance to compete,
I'd rather do that."
As the squad moves forward, it
plans to continue working towards
improvement, but McCoy empha
sized that one of the most important
aspects of the upcoming challenges
will be the confidence gained from
facing quality opponents.
"I think the biggest thing now is
just getting the guys to believe that
they're ready to step it up to the next
level," McCoy said. "I think in their
minds and in their hearts they know
that they've been doing all the right
things, and they just have to make
sure that it comes out once they step
on the mat. Some of the guys ques
tion their conditioning here and
there, question their technical level,
and then once they get out in compe
tition they realize,'Hey,we are ready,
we can compete at this level.' So they
just need to continue to build that
confidence in themselves."
After the Las Vegas Invitational,
the Cardinal will take to the mat
next at the Reno Tournament of
Champions on Dec. 19.
