# No. 2 Stanford gets LMU in NCAA tourney
## 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
After dramatic late-season wins
over UCLA and archrival California,
there remains only one team in the
nation that Stanford's men's water
polo team has failed to upset this sea
son: top-ranked Southern California.
It has been a year of bitter endings
for Stanford in its matchups against
USC. Four times the Cardinal have
lost to the Trojans — three times by a
single goal and once in overtime.
But none of that would matter at
all if the Cardinal can find a way to
knock off the Trojans in the final
showdown of the season — the title
game of this weekend's NCAA
Championship tournament.
The Stanford squad earned
its trip to Bucknell. the site of this
year's NCAA tournament, by defeat
ing Pepperdine and UC-Irvine in
dominant fashion to reach the title
game of last weekend's Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation tournament.
In the MPSF final.the Cardinal fell to
the TYojans, 8-5, despite receiving an
impressive four-goal effort from sen
ior captain Thomas Hopkins.
But by securing the single at-large
bid to the NCAA tournament with
their runner-up finish at MPSFs, the
Cardinal put themselves in position to
fight for this year's national title.
"Overall, mission accomplished,"
said senior captain Peter Varellas, in
reference to the team's effort in the
conference tournament. "We came

competition as the No. 2 seed in the
tournament. On Saturday after
noon, the Cardinal are scheduled to
take on No. 3 seed Loyola Mary
mount (18-15), champions of the
Western Water Polo Association.
ITie Cardinal played the Lions once
this season, winning 10-3 on the
strength of hat tricks from Varellas
and Hopkins and a combined si\
saves from sophomore Sandy Ho
hener and junior Beau Stockst ill.
While Stanford isn't overlooking
its first round matchup, it is eagerly
anticipating its chance to exact sweet
revenge for the four narrow losses to
the tournament-favorite Trojans this
season.

"We're all geared up to take on
USC," sophomore two-meter de
fender Peter Finlayson said. "They
beat us four weeks ago on a last sec
ond shot in overtime, so we want to
get them back."
Hut the challenges that the
Southern California squad (24-1)
presents are plentiful. Led by first
team Ail-American two-meter de
fender Juraj Zatovic, junior driver
Juan Dclgadillo and sophomore
two-meter Tommy Corcoran, the
Irojans have established themselves
as a formidable foe in both ends of
the pool.
"Southern California is a great
team with a lot of weapons," Fin
layson said. "They are very well
coached and very disciplined, so it's
important that we play with confi
dence and as a team."
Key to the Cardinal's bid for the
national title is their ability to shut

down the opposition's power play —
a factor that has proven critical in
many of the Stanford's wins and
losses this season.
"We pride ourselves on [our five
on-six defense] because it shows
heart and toughness to be able to shut
down a team even when you are out
numbered," Finlayson said. "Coach
likes to talk about 'winning every pos
session' and making sure we don't do
anything to give our opponent goals.
But one of the great things about the
team this year is that we all know our
roles and play them."
While Stanford head coach John
Vargas' squad recognizes the diffi
culty of this weekend's coming test,
the Cardinal have voiced through
out the season that there is no mem
ber of the team who views the chal
lenge as insurmountable. They have
a chance prove themselves right in
Sunday's final at 6 p.m. EST.

anything to give our opponent goals.
But one of the great things about the
team this year is that we all know our
roles and play them."
While Stanford head coach John
Vargas' squad recognizes the diffi
culty of this weekend's coming test,
the Cardinal have voiced through
out the season that there is no mem
ber of the team who views the chal
lenge as insurmountable. They have
a chance prove themselves right in
Sunday's final at 6 p.m. EST.
After dramatic late-season wins
over UCLA and archrival California,
there remains only one team in the
nation that Stanford's men's water
polo team has failed to upset this sea
son: top-ranked Southern California.
It has been a year of bitter endings
for Stanford in its matchups against
USC. Four times the Cardinal have
lost to the Trojans — three times by a
single goal and once in overtime.
But none of that would matter at
all if the Cardinal can find a way to
knock off the Trojans in the final
showdown of the season — the title
game of this weekend's NCAA
Championship tournament.
The Stanford squad earned
its trip to Bucknell. the site of this
year's NCAA tournament, by defeat
ing Pepperdine and UC-Irvine in
dominant fashion to reach the title
game of last weekend's Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation tournament.
In the MPSF final.the Cardinal fell to
the TYojans, 8-5, despite receiving an
impressive four-goal effort from sen
ior captain Thomas Hopkins.
But by securing the single at-large
bid to the NCAA tournament with
their runner-up finish at MPSFs, the
Cardinal put themselves in position to
fight for this year's national title.
"Overall, mission accomplished,"
said senior captain Peter Varellas, in
reference to the team's effort in the
conference tournament. "We came

tournament. On Saturday after
noon, the Cardinal are scheduled to
take on No. 3 seed Loyola Mary

Western Water Polo Association.
ITie Cardinal played the Lions once
this season, winning 10-3 on the
strength of hat tricks from Varellas
and Hopkins and a combined si\
saves from sophomore Sandy Ho

While Stanford isn't overlooking
its first round matchup, it is eagerly
anticipating its chance to exact sweet
revenge for the four narrow losses to
the tournament-favorite Trojans this
season.

"We're all geared up to take on
USC," sophomore two-meter de
fender Peter Finlayson said. "They
beat us four weeks ago on a last sec
ond shot in overtime, so we want to
get them back."
Hut the challenges that the
Southern California squad (24-1)
presents are plentiful. Led by first
team Ail-American two-meter de
fender Juraj Zatovic, junior driver
Juan Dclgadillo and sophomore
two-meter Tommy Corcoran, the
Irojans have established themselves
as a formidable foe in both ends of
the pool.
"Southern California is a great
team with a lot of weapons," Fin
layson said. "They are very well
coached and very disciplined, so it's
important that we play with confi
dence and as a team."
Key to the Cardinal's bid for the
national title is their ability to shut

down the opposition's power play —
a factor that has proven critical in
many of the Stanford's wins and
losses this season.
"We pride ourselves on [our five
on-six defense] because it shows
heart and toughness to be able to shut
down a team even when you are out
numbered," Finlayson said. "Coach
