# No. 2 Vols next for Cardinal
## 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 12 Stanford women's
basketball team cruised to a 109-58
victory last night against Pacific, giv
ing Stanford three straight wins of 50
points or more over the Tigers. The
result was also Stanford's highest
score in eight seasons, falling just
short of an 111-point effort against
Howard in the 1997 NCAA Tourna
ment.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 31-
8 lead within the first 10 minutes of
the game and never looked back. Se
niors Carolina Ruiz and Tina Saner
ivi each got in early foul trouble, as
the Tigers struggled to keep their
best players on the court. The Tigers
did make a push late in the first half,
but the Cardinal ended the half on a
strong note and took a 59-34 lead
into the locker room.
Nearly the whole Stanford squad
contributed to the win. Six players
scored in the double digits, as play
ing time was shared with the com
fortable lead. Junior center Brooke
Smith led the scoring, with 20 points,
and sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins added 16. First-time starter, sen
ior guard Krista Rappahan, knocked
down a career-high five three-point
ers out of six attempts.
"I think IRappahan] did very well
tonight," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She looked poised,
did a good job putting the ball in and
did well on rebounding."
Rebounding was also a team ef
fort, as Wiggins pulled down eight
boards. Smith had seven and junior
forward Kristen Newlin had 12. Re
bounding was one of many focuses
of the night for Stanford, since it
next faces No. 2 Tennessee at home
on Sunday, where staying strong on
the glass will be key.
"We had a lot of long rebounds
tonight," VanDerveer said. "We still
need to focus on boxing-out, but
tonight was a good start and it's
something we'll continue working
on."

over UOP, the team's focus this

week was on the Lady Vols. Ten
nessee is on a 9-0 run against Stan
ford, with the three most recent
matches all decided by less than four
points. In 2003, Stanford lost 70-66 in
overtime, and in 2004 it was shut out
of the Final Four, losing, 62-60. Last
year also brought a crushing 70-67
defeat with a three-pointer at the
buzzer by then-junior Shanna Zol
man.
"We're excited," Smith said.
"They're a great team, hard to beat
and very talented. Last year doesn't
matter — just this year."
Despite the Lady Vol's intimidat
ing 9-0 record, the Cardinal are
ready for the challenge. Last night's
win provided momentum and confi

beat Tennessee.
"We're definitely pumped up,"

"We've had some really close games

rival."

winning streak at Maples Pavilion

this Sunday. The Lady Vols will be
pressing hard in what will most like
ly be a very up-tempo game. Smith
said the team will have to keep Ten
nessee off the glass and not give up
easy baskets.
"They're great offensive re
bounders," Smith said. "You want to
make sure you're boxed out and
keep their players in front, slowing

down their transitions. That's how
they get easy points, on fast breaks."
"1 think to win against Tennessee
we have to play good position de
fense, we have to box out and we
have to play smart," VanDerveer
added. "We have to do things we can
do: set good screens, make sure we
have good shot selection and make
good decisions."
Although the Cardinal shot 51.3
percent against UOP's 30.9, Ten
nessee should undoubtedly do bet
ter. Stanford needs to keep up, espe
cially when it comes down to the
end, since the three previous games

against the Lady Vols were decided
within the last minute.
"We want to make it a 15-round
game and get into round 15 and still
be swinging," VanDerveer said.
The 12:30 p.m. Sunday game
against Tennessee could be a
barometer for where the Cardinal
are at this point in the season. In
VanDerveer's opinion, facing some
of the top competition is the best
way to grow and prove the team's
current ability and potential.
"This is a game that helps you
grow no matter what happens," she
said.

be swinging," VanDerveer said.
The 12:30 p.m. Sunday game
against Tennessee could be a
barometer for where the Cardinal
are at this point in the season. In
VanDerveer's opinion, facing some
of the top competition is the best
way to grow and prove the team's
current ability and potential.
"This is a game that helps you
grow no matter what happens," she
said.
The No. 12 Stanford women's
basketball team cruised to a 109-58
victory last night against Pacific, giv
ing Stanford three straight wins of 50
points or more over the Tigers. The
result was also Stanford's highest
score in eight seasons, falling just
short of an 111-point effort against
Howard in the 1997 NCAA Tourna
ment.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 31-
8 lead within the first 10 minutes of
the game and never looked back. Se
niors Carolina Ruiz and Tina Saner
ivi each got in early foul trouble, as
the Tigers struggled to keep their
best players on the court. The Tigers
did make a push late in the first half,
but the Cardinal ended the half on a
strong note and took a 59-34 lead
into the locker room.
Nearly the whole Stanford squad
contributed to the win. Six players
scored in the double digits, as play
ing time was shared with the com
fortable lead. Junior center Brooke
Smith led the scoring, with 20 points,
and sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins added 16. First-time starter, sen
ior guard Krista Rappahan, knocked
down a career-high five three-point
ers out of six attempts.
"I think IRappahan] did very well
tonight," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She looked poised,
did a good job putting the ball in and
did well on rebounding."
Rebounding was also a team ef
fort, as Wiggins pulled down eight
boards. Smith had seven and junior
forward Kristen Newlin had 12. Re
bounding was one of many focuses
of the night for Stanford, since it
next faces No. 2 Tennessee at home
on Sunday, where staying strong on
the glass will be key.
"We had a lot of long rebounds
tonight," VanDerveer said. "We still
need to focus on boxing-out, but
tonight was a good start and it's
something we'll continue working
on."
As Stanford expected an easy win
over UOP, the team's focus this

ford, with the three most recent
matches all decided by less than four
points. In 2003, Stanford lost 70-66 in
overtime, and in 2004 it was shut out
of the Final Four, losing, 62-60. Last
year also brought a crushing 70-67
defeat with a three-pointer at the
buzzer by then-junior Shanna Zol

"We're excited," Smith said.
"They're a great team, hard to beat
and very talented. Last year doesn't
matter — just this year."
Despite the Lady Vol's intimidat
ing 9-0 record, the Cardinal are
ready for the challenge. Last night's
win provided momentum and confi

this Sunday. The Lady Vols will be
pressing hard in what will most like
ly be a very up-tempo game. Smith
said the team will have to keep Ten
nessee off the glass and not give up
easy baskets.
"They're great offensive re
bounders," Smith said. "You want to
make sure you're boxed out and
keep their players in front, slowing

down their transitions. That's how
they get easy points, on fast breaks."
"1 think to win against Tennessee
we have to play good position de
fense, we have to box out and we
have to play smart," VanDerveer
added. "We have to do things we can
do: set good screens, make sure we
have good shot selection and make
good decisions."
Although the Cardinal shot 51.3
percent against UOP's 30.9, Ten
nessee should undoubtedly do bet
ter. Stanford needs to keep up, espe
cially when it comes down to the
end, since the three previous games

against the Lady Vols were decided
within the last minute.
