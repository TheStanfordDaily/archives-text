### CHRISTIAN TORRES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 12 Stanford women's
basketball team cruised to a 109-58
victory last night against Pacific, giv
ing Stanford three straight wins of 50
points or more over the Tigers. The
result was also Stanford's highest
score in eight seasons, falling just
short of an 111-point effort against
Howard in the 1997 NCAA Tourna
ment.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 31-
8 lead within the first 10 minutes of
the game and never looked back. Se
niors Carolina Ruiz and Tina Saner
ivi each got in early foul trouble, as
the Tigers struggled to keep their
best players on the court. The Tigers
did make a push late in the first half,
but the Cardinal ended the half on a
strong note and took a 59-34 lead
into the locker room.
Nearly the whole Stanford squad
contributed to the win. Six players
scored in the double digits, as play
ing time was shared with the com
fortable lead. Junior center Brooke
Smith led the scoring, with 20 points,
and sophomore guard Candice Wig
gins added 16. First-time starter, sen
ior guard Krista Rappahan, knocked
down a career-high five three-point
ers out of six attempts.
"I think IRappahan] did very well
tonight," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "She looked poised,
did a good job putting the ball in and
did well on rebounding."
Rebounding was also a team ef
fort, as Wiggins pulled down eight
boards. Smith had seven and junior
forward Kristen Newlin had 12. Re
bounding was one of many focuses
of the night for Stanford, since it
next faces No. 2 Tennessee at home
on Sunday, where staying strong on
the glass will be key.
"We had a lot of long rebounds
tonight," VanDerveer said. "We still
need to focus on boxing-out, but
tonight was a good start and it's
something we'll continue working
on."
As Stanford expected an easy win
over UOP, the team's focus this

week was on the Lady Vols. Ten
nessee is on a 9-0 run against Stan
ford, with the three most recent
matches all decided by less than four
points. In 2003, Stanford lost 70-66 in
overtime, and in 2004 it was shut out
of the Final Four, losing, 62-60. Last
year also brought a crushing 70-67
defeat with a three-pointer at the
buzzer by then-junior Shanna Zol
man.
"We're excited," Smith said.
"They're a great team, hard to beat
and very talented. Last year doesn't
matter â€” just this year."
Despite the Lady Vol's intimidat
ing 9-0 record, the Cardinal are
ready for the challenge. Last night's
win provided momentum and confi
dence fora Stanford squad ready to
beat Tennessee.
"We're definitely pumped up,"
sophomore guard Cissy Pierce said.
"We've had some really close games
against them and they're a great
rival."
But Stanford needs more than
just enthusiasm to retain its 23-game
winning streak at Maples Pavilion
