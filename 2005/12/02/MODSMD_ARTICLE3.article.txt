## Week off continued next year Long Thanksgiving break effects evaluated 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
Students and faculty will once
again be given the full week off for
Thanksgiving break next year, the
chair of the Faculty Senate told mem
bers at its biweekly meeting last
night.
The announcement about next
year's calendar came in a wide-rang
ing Faculty Senate meeting where
members also heard an update from
the provost and unanimously ap
proved a new Master's degree pro
gram in Medicine for Ph.D. students.
Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts, chair of the Faculty Senate,
updated the group on the status of
the calendar change at the beginning
of the meeting. He told members that
giving students the entire week off
for Thanksgiving was an experiment
that the Steering Committee decided
last week should be tried again next
year.
He asked faculty to research if the
week-long break had the desired ef

students and encouraging people to
go home who otherwise might not
leave campus. He wondered if per
haps it also had a negative effect, as a
noticeable number of people skipped
Friday classes to leave campus early.
In addition to debating a report
about graduate education, the Senate
unanimously approved a new mas
ters of science degree in Medicine for
Ph.D. students. The program —
which will begin its implementation
next year — allows students to earn a
master's degree in translational med
icine co-terminally with their doctor
ate.
Being a Ph.D. student with a
strong background in the biological
sciences will be a pre-requisite fora
program that is designed to help stu
dents take theoretical findings of
their basic research and apply it into
clinical fields.
The M.D./Ph.D. program will still
be offered, program designers said.
Supporters said that the M.S. in Med
icine might be attractive for those
who do not want to invest the time
necessary fora full medical degree
(MD), but who are still interested in
studying the clinical applications of
medicine. Earning this degree is ex
pected to add an additional one to
one-and-a-half years to the timetable
for earning the Ph.D.
"We want this program to be seen
as elite," said Director of the program
and Neurobiology Prof. Ben Barres.
"We want the very best students to do
