# FACULTY SENATE
## Week off continued next year Long Thanksgiving break effects evaluated 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
Students and faculty will once
again be given the full week off for
Thanksgiving break next year, the
chair of the Faculty Senate told mem
bers at its biweekly meeting last
night.
The announcement about next
year's calendar came in a wide-rang
ing Faculty Senate meeting where
members also heard an update from
the provost and unanimously ap
proved a new Master's degree pro
gram in Medicine for Ph.D. students.
Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts, chair of the Faculty Senate,
updated the group on the status of
the calendar change at the beginning
of the meeting. He told members that
giving students the entire week off
for Thanksgiving was an experiment
that the Steering Committee decided
last week should be tried again next
year.
He asked faculty to research if the
week-long break had the desired ef
fect of reducing stress for first-year
students and encouraging people to
go home who otherwise might not
leave campus. He wondered if per
haps it also had a negative effect, as a
noticeable number of people skipped
Friday classes to leave campus early.
In addition to debating a report
about graduate education, the Senate
unanimously approved a new mas
ters of science degree in Medicine for
Ph.D. students. The program —
which will begin its implementation
next year — allows students to earn a
master's degree in translational med
icine co-terminally with their doctor
ate.
Being a Ph.D. student with a
strong background in the biological
sciences will be a pre-requisite fora
program that is designed to help stu
dents take theoretical findings of
their basic research and apply it into
clinical fields.
The M.D./Ph.D. program will still
be offered, program designers said.
Supporters said that the M.S. in Med
icine might be attractive for those
who do not want to invest the time
necessary fora full medical degree
(MD), but who are still interested in
studying the clinical applications of
medicine. Earning this degree is ex
pected to add an additional one to
one-and-a-half years to the timetable
for earning the Ph.D.
"We want this program to be seen
as elite," said Director of the program
and Neurobiology Prof. Ben Barres.
"We want the very best students to do
this program without the financial
constraints."
Barres told the group he expected
to start with six students next year.
He told the faculty that he already
had the funding for three of the stu
dents and was working on the rest.
One professor expressed concern
that this would add more students to
a University already constrained for
space. Another wondered whether
the M.S. in Medicine would be of any
value in the working world where it
would not be a credential, like the
M.D.
Provost John Etchemendy an
nounced the formation of a new per
manent Diversity Cabinet to focus
on diversity issues at Stanford. The
Cabinet will replace the temporary
Diversity Action Council, which has
been dissolved. The cabinet will be
composed by position, not individu
als.
"To keep issues of diversity on the
front burner of the University, we
have decided to form a Diversity
Cabinet," he said. "The cabinet will
be comprised of executive officers
who are key decision makers. We ex
pect the group to provide us with
strategic advice on how to continue
to improve campus diversity."
Later in the meeting, the provost
announced that a senior member of
the staff received a threatening
phone call late last night from a per
son identifying themselves as a Uni
versity student and a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition.
The assailant called twice and the
staffer did not answer the second
time. In an answering machine mes
sage, Etchemendy quoted the caller
as saying, "You can't escape. We
know where you live."
Etchemendy called the threat
very serious and said that police are
tracking down the caller.
"This is clearly a violation of the
Fundamental Standard,"he said, say
ing the student will be disciplined if
identified. "This is not the way labor
discussions should go on."
School of Medicine Dean Philip
Pizzo commented that these kinds of
harassment tactics are employed by
union leaders and their supporters.
"The tactics the provost described
is standard operating procedure," he

said. "There is a clear intent to harass
leaders at the workplace and at their
homes."
"The union not only is targeting
leaders, but they are also targeting
students to be bidders for their
deeds," he added. "Students are
being made complicit."
Etchemendy transitioned from
the announcement about the threat
against the staff member to a state
ment about the University's position
on the Monday vote by University
workers to authorize union bosses to
call a strike. While not involved in the
negotiations personally, he said that
there is a no-strike clause in the cur
rent contract which prevents the
union from striking. He said the
union's claim that % percent of those
who voted had supported the strike
was misleading because the union re
fuses to disclose how many voted.
He defended the University's
health care policies that union nego
tiators have called inadequate. All
Stanford employees have the same
healthcare plans, he said.
"The package pays 100 percent of
an employee's health care cost at the
least expensive provider," he added.
Etchemendy also provided up
dates on University fundraising ef
forts. Over the past year, the Univer
sity met or surpassed its goals for the
Stanford Fund ($ 100 million) and for
the Bing Overseas Studies Program
($5O million), he said. As of Wednes
day, he reported that the Campaign
for Undergraduate Education
(CUE) had raised more than $1 bil
lion.
"Without question, CUE has
been a tremendous success," he said.
"Thanks again to the faculty who
helped us in so many ways."
Some of the money raised for the
fund each year goes to support the
University Fellows for Undergradu
ate Education. Due to exceptional
fund raising, Etchemendy was able to
announce nine (instead of the
planned eight) fellowships for next
year.
The fellows were: Mechanical En
gineering Prof. David Beach, Philos
ophy Prof. Christopher Bobonich,
Math Prof. Ralph Cohen, Biological
Sciences Prof. Gretchen Daily, Civil
and Environmental Engineering
Prof. Jeffrey Koseff, Political Science
Prof. Jean C. Oi, German Studies
Prof. Orrin W." Rob" Robinson, Pop
ulation and Resource Studies Prof.
Peter Vitousek and Chemistry Prof.
Robert M. Waymouth.

day, he reported that the Campaign
for Undergraduate Education
(CUE) had raised more than $1 bil
lion.
"Without question, CUE has
been a tremendous success," he said.
"Thanks again to the faculty who
helped us in so many ways."
Some of the money raised for the
fund each year goes to support the
University Fellows for Undergradu
ate Education. Due to exceptional
fund raising, Etchemendy was able to
announce nine (instead of the
planned eight) fellowships for next
year.
The fellows were: Mechanical En
gineering Prof. David Beach, Philos
ophy Prof. Christopher Bobonich,
Math Prof. Ralph Cohen, Biological
Sciences Prof. Gretchen Daily, Civil
and Environmental Engineering
Prof. Jeffrey Koseff, Political Science
Prof. Jean C. Oi, German Studies

Students and faculty will once
again be given the full week off for
Thanksgiving break next year, the
chair of the Faculty Senate told mem
bers at its biweekly meeting last
night.
The announcement about next
year's calendar came in a wide-rang
ing Faculty Senate meeting where
members also heard an update from
the provost and unanimously ap
proved a new Master's degree pro
gram in Medicine for Ph.D. students.
Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts, chair of the Faculty Senate,
updated the group on the status of
the calendar change at the beginning
of the meeting. He told members that
giving students the entire week off
for Thanksgiving was an experiment
that the Steering Committee decided
last week should be tried again next
year.
He asked faculty to research if the
week-long break had the desired ef
fect of reducing stress for first-year
students and encouraging people to
go home who otherwise might not
leave campus. He wondered if per
haps it also had a negative effect, as a
noticeable number of people skipped
Friday classes to leave campus early.
In addition to debating a report
about graduate education, the Senate
unanimously approved a new mas
ters of science degree in Medicine for
Ph.D. students. The program —
which will begin its implementation
next year — allows students to earn a
master's degree in translational med
icine co-terminally with their doctor
ate.
Being a Ph.D. student with a
strong background in the biological
sciences will be a pre-requisite fora
program that is designed to help stu
dents take theoretical findings of
their basic research and apply it into
clinical fields.
The M.D./Ph.D. program will still
be offered, program designers said.
Supporters said that the M.S. in Med
icine might be attractive for those
who do not want to invest the time
necessary fora full medical degree
(MD), but who are still interested in
studying the clinical applications of
medicine. Earning this degree is ex
pected to add an additional one to
one-and-a-half years to the timetable
for earning the Ph.D.
"We want this program to be seen
as elite," said Director of the program
and Neurobiology Prof. Ben Barres.
"We want the very best students to do
this program without the financial
constraints."
Barres told the group he expected
to start with six students next year.
He told the faculty that he already
had the funding for three of the stu
dents and was working on the rest.
One professor expressed concern
that this would add more students to
a University already constrained for
space. Another wondered whether
the M.S. in Medicine would be of any
value in the working world where it
would not be a credential, like the
M.D.
Provost John Etchemendy an
nounced the formation of a new per
manent Diversity Cabinet to focus
on diversity issues at Stanford. The
Cabinet will replace the temporary
Diversity Action Council, which has
been dissolved. The cabinet will be
composed by position, not individu
als.
"To keep issues of diversity on the
front burner of the University, we
have decided to form a Diversity
Cabinet," he said. "The cabinet will
be comprised of executive officers
who are key decision makers. We ex
pect the group to provide us with
strategic advice on how to continue
to improve campus diversity."
Later in the meeting, the provost
announced that a senior member of
the staff received a threatening
phone call late last night from a per
son identifying themselves as a Uni
versity student and a member of the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition.
The assailant called twice and the
staffer did not answer the second
time. In an answering machine mes
sage, Etchemendy quoted the caller
as saying, "You can't escape. We
know where you live."
Etchemendy called the threat
very serious and said that police are
tracking down the caller.
"This is clearly a violation of the
Fundamental Standard,"he said, say
ing the student will be disciplined if
identified. "This is not the way labor
discussions should go on."
School of Medicine Dean Philip
Pizzo commented that these kinds of
harassment tactics are employed by
union leaders and their supporters.
"The tactics the provost described
is standard operating procedure," he

said. "There is a clear intent to harass
leaders at the workplace and at their
homes."
"The union not only is targeting
leaders, but they are also targeting
students to be bidders for their
deeds," he added. "Students are
being made complicit."
Etchemendy transitioned from
the announcement about the threat
against the staff member to a state
ment about the University's position
on the Monday vote by University
workers to authorize union bosses to
call a strike. While not involved in the
negotiations personally, he said that
there is a no-strike clause in the cur
rent contract which prevents the
union from striking. He said the
union's claim that % percent of those
who voted had supported the strike
was misleading because the union re
fuses to disclose how many voted.
He defended the University's
health care policies that union nego
tiators have called inadequate. All
Stanford employees have the same
healthcare plans, he said.
"The package pays 100 percent of
an employee's health care cost at the
least expensive provider," he added.
Etchemendy also provided up
dates on University fundraising ef
forts. Over the past year, the Univer
sity met or surpassed its goals for the
Stanford Fund ($ 100 million) and for
the Bing Overseas Studies Program
($5O million), he said. As of Wednes
day, he reported that the Campaign
for Undergraduate Education
(CUE) had raised more than $1 bil
lion.
"Without question, CUE has
