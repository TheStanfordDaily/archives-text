## AD Leland set to leave post for UOP 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
When outgoing Athletic Director Ted Le
land departs the Farm on Jan. 1, he knows what
will stand out in his mind from his 15 years at
the position.
"Stanford attracts a wonderful mix of
young people, and I'm going to miss the kids
the most," Leland said, as his final month as

AD rolls in. "It's been a lot of
fun to watch athletes come
here as freshmen with a lot of
dreams and aspirations, and
watch them leave four years
later having struggled to get
there but reaching their
dreams."
After leading Stanford to
11 straight Director's Cups,
an annual award given to the

strongest overall athletic program in the na
tion, Leland is ready to become Vice President
of Development at his alma mater, the Univer
sity of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. Amidst
praise for the University and the athletic de
partment, Leland, 56, emphasizes that he is
also looking forward to his new role.
"I'm looking forward to going back to
teaching," said Leland, who taught his first
four years at Stanford. "I'm also interested in
getting involved in issues in high education
other than sports."
Indeed, Leland adds that he is eager to
leave the constant intensity and pressure asso
ciated with a major athletic department.
"I've been in big-time athletics for 37 years,
and it's sort of a treadmill," said Leland, who is
married with two children. "If you're part of
the team, part of the struggle, it's a full-time fa
natical commitment. This department tends to
be all-consuming, and people down here are
crazy for their sport. I've shared that. Now I
get to step away from it."
One reason Leland may find it easier to de
part is his confidence in interim replacement
Bill Walsh, a former football coach at Stanford
(1977-778, 1992-794) and the San Francisco
49ers (1979-788), who won three Super Bowls
under him.
"Bill has great credibility with our coach
es," Leland said. "A large part of this job is
working with coaches on a day-to-day basis
and making sure they're confident that they
can be successful. Bill will certainly do a better
job of that than I ever could because of his rep
utation."
Walsh's biggest challenge will be managing
the reseating and funding of the new football
stadium and, according to Leland, he will like
ly hold the interim position at least through
the winter.
Leland identified the ever-increasing com
plexity of his job as the most significant
change he has seen in the past. NCAA regula
tions, construction projects, coaches' con
tracts and defense against lawsuits are all
more formidable obstacles now than they
were 15 years ago.
"I just think the world is more complex now
than 15 years ago, and it will probably be more
complex in 15 years than it is today," Leland
said.
Leland believes he has successfully navigat
ed the increasing difficulties of his job, howev
er, and leaves with his head held high.
"I take a lot of quiet professional satisfac
tion in knowing that we did about as well as we
could do," Leland said.
