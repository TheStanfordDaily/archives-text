# K.Flay is makin' Ill-i-noise
## 
### BRIA LONG INTERMISSION GANGSTA 
Forget your stereotypes about rap. This girl will make you
wanna "party real hard like 50 Cent up in the club,"and she's noth
ing you've ever heard or seen before. Think rap is only for gangsta
guys from the ATL? Think again.
Kristine Flahtery, a junior from Wilmette, 111., has just recently
come out with her debut album as K.Flay; "Surburban Rap
Queen." Not only are the lyrics and most of the beats her own, but
she can even credit the cover art to her name. It's different; it's dar
ing; it's original; it's fun; it will challenge your perceptions about
who can rap and what rap should be.
This album is a compilation of songs, some composed just this
year and others that have been evolving since K.Flay's freshman
year. Ironically, K.Ray started rapping at the end of her freshman
year when she was dared to write a rap song after she claimed, "any
body could write a [rap] song." When her RCC, Mark Slee, ended
up putting the parody she wrote to a beat and recorded it things
started rolling.
Though she admits she "basically didn't know what [she] was
doing," K.Flay's love of hip-hop and music inspired her to keep
writing throughout the summer and into her sophomore year.
Even if she concedes her music is "just what comes out" and is
sometimes her "at 3 am being insane," K.Flay certainly has her own
style. In fact, this is part of what makes her so unique: her songs
seem to blend opinions, ideas and stream-of-consciousness poetry.
And although her beats definitely have a more "poppy" feel, some
songs like "Hey Ladies" and "Time Stops," have quite serious mes
sages.

With "Hey Ladies," probably her most feminist inspired song,
there's "a message that's not out there at all," as K.Flay claims,
"most female rappers...are [still] playing to misogynistic culture in
general."

However, other songs,
like "Frat Party" and "Red
Meat" are to K.Flay "what
ever seems like fun." But if
you're only going to listen
to one of KFlay's songs,
make sure to check out
trade two, "Suburban Rap
Queen." Catchy with a
strong beat, this song will
introduce you to her
unique style.
K.Flay started perform
ing on campus this past
spring quarter and this year
has performed at Sigma
Nu's Moonsplash and for
the SOCA Unplugged se-

ries, where she not only showed off her skills but also did it acousti
cally with a guitar and djembe.
KJFlay is currently pursuing a double major in Psychology and
Sociology and lives in Otero as a writing tutor. In the future, K.Flay
plans on recording more albums, performing at other colleges and
"seeing where things go." For now, visit www.kflay.com or contact

and fun album, "Suburban Rap Queen."
