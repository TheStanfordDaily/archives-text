# New Xbox rocks your socks
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION GENERATION X-ER 
After months of hype, the launch of Mi
crosoft's latest foray into the gaming world
has finally arrived. There's been lots of talk
about graphics, processors, revolutions and
the dawning of a new gaming age, but there
are only two questions of significance: is it
cool, and are the games any good? Read on to
find out.
First off, let the record show that I'm not
one of those crazy gamers that preordered
the Xbox 360 months in advance by buying a
ridiculous gaming bundle. Rather, I'm one of
those ridiculous gamers who waited several
hours in front of Fry's and picked up a crappy
Core bundle because the

guy in front of me
got the last real sys
tem.
Yes, folks: Mi
crosoft's newest con
sole comes in two
different models.
There's the $400
good version that
comes with a wireless
controller, hard
drive, headset, DVD
remote and compo
nent cables, and
there's the crappy
$300 we're-releasing
this-so-you-suckers-
pay-tons-for-acces-
sories Core bundle
with just a wired con
troller. Suffice it to
say, I wasn't too
pleased with the Core

system, mainly because the lack of a hard
drive means you have to buy a $40 memory
card just to save your games (unless you can
find the hard drive attachment for $100, an
accessory that's hard to come by right now).
Also, the hard drive provides limited back
wards compatibility with the original Xbox.
So, no smoother, faster version of "Halo 2"
for you unless you find the hard drive attach
ment.
So enough about getting screwed over
with the hardware; it's a proven fact most
early adopters are going to shell out more
cash than they should. The real question is:
how does it look and run? Well, after taking it
out of the box and plugging it in, I have to say
that the 360 is definitely one of the prettiest
consoles I've ever seen. The sleek silver box
with hidden compartments for every thing is
extremely well designed and would look
great in any home entertainment system.
The controllers are slightly modified from
the original Xbox with one of the analog
sticks switching places with the D-pad fora
more natural feel when holding it. A big
green X on the system and controller acts as
the power switch and lets you know how
many controllers are plugged in based on the
rings of light that are lit up around it (the abil
ity to turn the system on from the controller is

really cool, for the record).
The Dashboard, the new

software hub for man-

aging the system

does a good job of

providing an en
joyable experi-

ence for the on
line Xbox Live

service and for
personalizing

your system. Its accessibility from within any
game is a welcome addition, as well.
The games are probably the most hit-or
miss aspect of the whole system. Games like
"Perfect Dark Zero" and "Call of Duty 2"
show a glimpse of the graphical prowess and
online capabilities of the system, while "Mad
den 2006" shows that the sports freaks will
continue to shell out cash every year for
minor enhancements and an updated roster.
Then there's "NBA Live 2006," a game
that possesses next to no legitimate gameplay
and manages to be the first game that crosses
the threshold into graphics so realistic that
their imperfections create an uncomfortable
feeling in the human soul.
I guess the moral of the story is that the 360
launch contains nothing innovative or truly
must-have other than some graphical updates
to titles that have already been out. But then
again, with the exception of Nintendo, most
systems have always endured poor launch ti
tles.
Gamers looking to pick up this new sys
tem before Christmas will probably have to
scour the weekly shipments at Best Buy and
Fry's, since any store that offered reserva
tions are completely filled through the year.
As a gamer, I have to say that the games are
sweet, the 360 does what it needs to do and
any one with a true interest in gaming will
most likely enjoy the system.
However, for everyone else looking to get
by just on interest, there's no reason to rush.
Great titles like "Dead or Alive 4" and
"Elder Scrolls: Oblivion" have yet to be re
leased, and with even more "must-have" ti
tles on the horizon, you can truly have a
choice to join the 360 scene now or later. Of
course, the console shortages might just force
you to choose that latter option.


Isn't is so pretty? You know you want one
