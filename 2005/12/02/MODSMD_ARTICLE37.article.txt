## Intermission Jrailer Jrash readies for the holidays 
### CALEY ANDERSON INTERMISSION TRAILER TRASH 
Nothing says winter break quite like sitting at
the theater, sipping on your grande Peppermint
Mocha and stuffing your face with buttery
movie popcorn. Repeatedly. To prepare you for
the cinema experience, Intermission offers a

tantalizing
glimpse at the
movies available
to you this Christ
mas (or so). The
reviews are based
upon the movie's
most current trail
er, and release
dates could
change, so double
check before you

go stand in line in
the snow 24 hours
in advance. rSy

Fun with Dick and Jane (Dec 21)
The trailer with Dick and Jane" left
me feeling ambiguous; I can't tell if it's going to
be a funny movie, or a really dull movie with a
few funny parts. The premise is clever: a broke
suburban couple decide to become thieves to

pay for their lifestyle. The cast is promising, as
Jim Carrey adds life to any movie he is a part of.
But the trailer doesn't flesh out any of the plot
other than a few solidly funny scenes, and
doesn't inspire me to run out and see it on open-

ing day.
Trailer rating:

The Ringer (Dec 23)
Who thought it was a good
idea to make a movie about
a guy pretending he's dis
abled to compete in and rig
the Special Olympics? Re
gardless of Johnny
Knoxville's general awe
someness, the poster for
"The Ringer" turned me
against the movie before I
even saw the trailer. Mo
ments in the trailer were
amusing, but really it only
served to let me know that

the conflict in the movie is that Knoxville's char
acter falls in love with the hot girl who works at
the Special Olympics. How can he win her heart
if he's mentally retarded? (Forget that the real
issue here really is a moral one. But what's a lit
tle lying amongst friends?)

Trailer rating:

Casanova (Dec 25)
Heath Ledger.
Heath Ledger as a
heartbreaker who
spends most of the
trailer looking as deli
cious and swoon-wor
thy as possible. What
is not to love about this
movie? Sure it has a
predictable plot (if
you can't guess it by
the trailer then you
have not seen enough
movies), but some
times easy movies are
the best kind. Espe
cially on Christmas. I
mean, who wants to
have to think really

hard over break anyway? The trailer makes
"Casanova" loisk like a great date movieâ€”one
that girls will line-up for and guys will be
dragged to (but secretly enjoy, of course).

Trailer rating:

The New World (Dec 25)
Apparently there are not enough Pocahon
tas movies in the world, and New Line Cinema
felt the need to release this one on Christmas.

Thanksgiving really would have
been the only worse release date.
Colin Farrell is a scruffy John
Smith, which should draw in the
ladies, and Christian Bale is John
Rolfe (the only reason I will rent the
movie in six months), but other than
that I can't see any reason to go see
this movie. It can only end badly,
and who wants to be depressed on
Christmas?

Trailer rating:

Grandma's Boy (Jan 6)
The premise of "Grandma's
Boy" is terribly unappealing: a thir
ty-something gamer gets kicked out
of his apartment and moves in with
his grandmother and her two elderly
roommates. However, instead of

telling his friends the truth, he tells them that
he's living with three hot chicks and they have
orgies pretty much every night. Sounds too stu
pid to be a movie, right? The trailer actually had
me laughing out loud, though. Doris Roberts (of
"Everybody Loves Raymond" fame) is a comic
genius, and her ghost scene in the trailer makes
it well worth watching.

Trailer score:


Look, Grandma, no hands!




Heath's not so gay now, is he?
