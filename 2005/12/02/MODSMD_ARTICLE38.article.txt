Superman " is arguably the greatest super-

hero movie to date. If you don 7 find this year's

holiday movies appealing,
consider revisiting the

movie that made
audiences believe

"a man can fly."

Superman (1978)
In the summer of 2006 director
Bryan Singer will unveil his own vision
of Superman in "Superman Returns."
Singer is a talented director. His "X-
Men" movies are among the best comic
book adaptations ever made and I have
no doubt that "Superman Returns"
will replicate their success. But there's
something a little strange about remak-

ing "Superman": the original is practical-

ly flawless. Christopher Reeve is perfect in
the lead role. The script is well written.

And the film's score is one of John Williams'
best compositions. In short, "Superman"
doesn't need updating.
Prior to 1975, Warner Bros, didn't

recognize the box-office potential of the
comic book hero. The studio was in a posi-

tion to make a "Superman" movie for
years but found the concept too campy.
However, when Marlon Brando. Gene

Hackman and "Godfather" scribe
Mario Puzo became attached to the
project, Warner Bros, finally brokered
a deal with producers Ilya and Alexan
der Salkind. Curiously, this preceded

the casting of Christopher Reeve in the
lead role, a casting decision that was cen-

tral to the film's success.
Director Richard Donner and the Salkinds

tested dozens of actors for the
dual role of Superman/Clark
Kent. They included Robert
Redford, Paul Newman and even
Ilya Salkind's wife's dentist. But
it was Reeve who gave the most
impressive audition. It's not hard
to guess why. Playing it straight
and never overacting, he is utter
ly convincing as the Man of Steel.
It's difficult to imagine anyone
else in the role. Reeve truly made
it his own.
Like Reeve's performance,
the screenplay never parodies
the Superman concept. Indeed,
Donner famously sent signs to
each of the film's creative depart
ments with the word "verisimili
tude" printed on them. The di
rector explains that "it was a con-

stant reminder to ourselves that, if we gave
into the temptation we knew there would be
to parody Superman, we would only be fool
ing ourselves." The film's screenplay wisely
emphasizes the relationship between Super
man and Lois Lane, making Superman a very
human and very "real" story.
John Williams' "Superman" score is in
stantly recognizable and, as is the case with
his work on "Indiana Jones" and "Star

Wars," one of the film's best qualities. The
opening credit sequence is a real treat simply
because of Williams' rousing, bombastic "Su
perman" theme. It is very telling that Singer
has chosen to use the same theme music in
"Superman Returns."
"Superman" spawned three sequels and
