# Tops 5 Worst Superpowers
## 
### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION POWERMONGER 
On the day the powers got passed out, while Su-

perman was up there snagging
super strength and flight, these
guys must have been off play-

ing hopscotch somewhere.

Here are the bottom of the

barrel when it comes to

superpowers:
5. Hawkniun: Power of
long distance vision.
Okay, 1 wouldn't say

no to being able to spot a

parking space from a mile

away or watch football games

up close from the 150 th row, but

when you compare this power to some-

thing like flight or laser eyes it clearly comes up
short.
4. Jubilee: Power to make pretty designs in the air

with mental energy.
Outside of the July 4 and interior decorating, this
power is likely to generate more derision than awe.
3. Ani-nian: Power to shrink to incredibly small sizes.

This might be useful for studying molecular biology,

but less so for fighting crime.

2. Aquaman: Power to communi-

cate with marine life.

This one sounds pretty

good.until you realize that

all fish ever talk about is
global warming and
other fish. Not too excit
ing.
1. Ma-Ti (of the Plane-

teers): Power of heart.

Though Ma-Ti did have

some telepathic abilities.

"heart" turned out to be, basically,

empathy. Which is great and all, but if some-

one told me I was getting a superpower and all I got
was heart, I'd punch him in the face. Of course, then
the damn heart would make me feel sorry for him...
