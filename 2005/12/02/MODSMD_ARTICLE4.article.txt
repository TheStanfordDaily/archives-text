# Univ. employees consider striking
## Final contract negotiations have yet to be discussed 
### SARAH BROUDY STAFF WRITER 
Last night roughly 50 students, service
workers, union leaders and University repre
sentatives gathered at a town hall meeting to
discuss labor issues and the possibility of an up
coming strike by the nearly 1,300 Stanford em
ployees in the Service Employee International
Union (SEIU) Local 715.

Only days after union leaders called the pos

Stanford Workers, sharply criticized the Uni

He firmly stated that if the final upcoming con

out." Kvitkv said.

The possible University worker strike paral

where workers seek higher wages and more job
security.
Union workers criticize the current health
care plan and the University's recent cuts to re
tiree health care. 'Hie union wants Stanford to
provide full health care coverage for employee
family members, an especially important issue
in a time when health care costs are rising at
record-breaking rates.
Further, the union demands that the Uni
versity revoke one of the most recent changes
to the contract that would reduce retirement

benefits for employees hired after Jan. 1,2006.
Kvitky claimed the retirement benefit reduc
tion will make low income employees unable to
afford health care during retirement.
"Because of the recent changes,there would
be a 10 percent cut to the benefits of the work
ers hired after January, which would divide the
union members and create a two-tiered system,
where one group has one set of benefits and
wages, and another group does the same work
for fewer benefits."
