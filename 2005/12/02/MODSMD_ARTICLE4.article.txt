# Univ. employees consider striking
## Final contract negotiations have yet to be discussed 
### SARAH BROUDY STAFF WRITER 
Last night roughly 50 students, service
workers, union leaders and University repre
sentatives gathered at a town hall meeting to
discuss labor issues and the possibility of an up
coming strike by the nearly 1,300 Stanford em
ployees in the Service Employee International
Union (SEIU) Local 715.

Only days after union leaders called the pos
sibility of a major strike at Stanford very im
probable, Zev Kvitky, the president of United
Stanford Workers, sharply criticized the Uni
versity's position in the contract negotiation.
He firmly stated that if the final upcoming con
tract negotiation on Dec. 8 does not stimulate
"meaningful discussion" on the subjects of em
ployee retirement plans and health care bene
fits, there will be a strike.
"The custodians, the workers in the dining
halls, the people in the maintenance organiza
tions and the grounds keepers will all walk
out." Kvitkv said.

The possible University worker strike paral
lels similar negotiations at Stanford Hospital
where workers seek higher wages and more job
security.
Union workers criticize the current health
care plan and the University's recent cuts to re
tiree health care. 'Hie union wants Stanford to
provide full health care coverage for employee
family members, an especially important issue
in a time when health care costs are rising at
record-breaking rates.
Further, the union demands that the Uni
versity revoke one of the most recent changes
to the contract that would reduce retirement

benefits for employees hired after Jan. 1,2006.
Kvitky claimed the retirement benefit reduc
tion will make low income employees unable to
afford health care during retirement.
"Because of the recent changes,there would
be a 10 percent cut to the benefits of the work
ers hired after January, which would divide the
union members and create a two-tiered system,
where one group has one set of benefits and
wages, and another group does the same work
for fewer benefits."
Diane Peck, the executive director of the
Department of Human Resources,
defended the University's position,
arguing that Stanford has "one of the
best [healthcare] benefit plans of any
employer in the Bay Area, maybe the
nation."
"Employees who work here pay
nothing to cover themselves, and fur
ther the University pays 82 percent of
the cost to insure additional family
members," she said.
Further. Peck explained that while
only 25 percent of California employ
ers provide retiree Medical care,
Stanford provides $4,000 a year
above Medicare for retirees who
have worked 40 years at the Univer
sity.
Kvitky called these benefits insuf
ficient.
" People who have given 20,30 and
40 years of service need to be able to
depend on the guarantee of a feasible
retirement in the future." he said.
Peck explained that the Universi
ty, like every organization, must un
dergo regular cost assessments to see
where it stands against other employ

ers in order to balance the cost of var
ious operations and stay competitive.
"We are not just thinking about
today, rather about what we can do to
keep the University strong for hun
dreds of years to come," she said.
Sophomore Alejandra Lopez
from Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) criticized the Universi
ty, comparing its priorities to that of a
giant corporation, while also empha
sizing the importance of providing
reasonable benefits for service work
ers.
"It is important to hold [the Uni
versity] accountable for the treat

ment of the people who work here "
Lopez said.
Kvitky also likened Stanford's
treatment of workers to that of a cor
poration.
"Employees, as in a large corpora
tion. are far down the bottom of the
list of priorities." Kvitky said.
He also emphasized that the
workers understand that walking off
the job is a "major commitment." and
that the negotiators are trying to
avoid a strike if possible, but that the
union will not be afraid to take action
if their contract negotiations are
unmet.
