# THE 						UNCANNY
## SUPER-MISSION It's a bird, it's a plane, it's ... you? 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION JOE SCHMOE 
Harken your ears to me. true believer! The
world is in peril! Do you have the skills and the
unstoppable will to uphold the standards of
truth, justice and the American way? Have you
always dreamed of punching out the lights of
evildoers and ne'er-do-wells while foiling their
plans to take over the world? Are you on a tight
budget? Do you enjoy wearing your underwear
on the outside?
If you answered "yes" to any of these ques
tions, "The Government Manual for New Su
pcrheroes" is for you, citizen! Written by su
perhero aficionados Matthew David Brozik
and Jacob Sager Wcinstein, "The Manual'' is
your ticket to saving the citizenry of your cho
sen base of operations (i.e., city). Everything
from choosing your superhero name to finding
your very own arch nemesis are painstakingly

detailed to assist the average Joe Schmoe in becoming
SUPER JOE SCHMOE: DEFENDER OF MEDIOCRITY!
Of course, "The Manual" is written for (and by) people
who weren't born with superpowers, who don't come from a
doomed alien planet or who weren't bitten by radioactive spi
ders. It is for the average human being, devoid of "special"

gifts but with a love for justice. If you happen
to be a billionaire playboy with a giant chip
on your shoulder, you may have a leg up on
the competition. Money goes a long way. But
be forewarned, fair citizen, register your
super identity name pronto as aliases are
quickly patented. In fact, by the time you
read this, PRONTO will already be a certi
fied hero with a certified sidekick, RAFIDO.
Beware! The tongue-in-cheek tone of this
book might throw you off as per its useful
ness. The humor is only there to ease your
transition into the hero-ing world as it is
wrought with peril, real estate issues and lax
fraud. Nothing is more embarrassing than
leasing an apartment with the intent of it
being the FORTRESS OF SOLIDARITY
only to find that you live next to your grand
mother. Holy pop-culture reference. Bat
man!
Fora quick read that does not strain the

brain muscle (but may strengthen the justice muscle), give
"The Government Manual for New Superheroes" a shot.
Who knows, you may end up dropping that lucrative job at
Goldman Sachs to fight your nemesis on the rooftops. And re
member, if it's sanctioned by the government, you know it
can't be all bad. Excelsior!


Yes, it's a government docu
ment.
