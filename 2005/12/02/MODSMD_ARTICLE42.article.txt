# The
						supervillains of today face superissues

### NATE SOLON INTERMISSION PSYCHIATRIST 
Superheroes haven't always fought bad guys with emo
tional complexes. If you watch the old "Superman" cartoons, Su-

perman spends most of his time taking down petty crooks. Their mo
tive is simple: to make a buck. These days, our supervillains are tortured
souls and broken hearts. These supervillains are dealing with superissues:
the loss of loved ones, disfigurement as a result of acid burns or just simple
rejection.
The first "Batman" movie does a good job of showing the transforma
tion. The Joker himself starts out as an unremarkable mob underling, but
while chasing Batman falls into a vat of acid. The knowledge of his own de
formity drives him mad. He cuts loose his trademark cackle for the first time
after seeing his own twisted reflection in the mirror. The insane Joker be
comes Batman's nemesis.
"Batman" continues to be probably the most relentlessly psychological
popular comic series. Consider a few examples of recurring villains: Two-
Face. the originally do-gooding Gotham Attorney General Harvey Dent,

acquires split-personality disorder as a result of having half of his face
burned away in another acid vat accident (they should really be more
careful around those things); Mister Freeze, once a cryogenics re
searcher, becomes a cold shell of a man after failing to save his wife from
a fatal illness: The Scarecrow has no superpower whatsoever except an
acute understanding of human psychology, which he uses to scare peo
ple, sometimes to death. Batman himself is the product of emotional
trauma: witnessing his parents' murder as a child.
The newest Batman television show, "Batman Beyond," takes the
psychology to a new level. In the show, Bruce Wayne has retired, but
taken on a teenage protege who attends a futuristic high school.
A few years of living with a 12-year-old brother and access to Car
toon Network gave me plenty of chances to watch the show. (I should
admit that what little "comics" knowledge I have comes from watching
Cartoon Network.) Every episode was a concentrated half-hour dose of
pop psychology. In one that seemed to be on particularly often, one of
the school's football jocks look to tormenting a brainy loner. The kid re
sponded like anyone would. He built a giant robot and ran amok with it
at prom (seriously, this really happened). Batman had to take down the

robot, but not before the jock learned his
lesson. This kind of moralizing goes
hand-in-hand with the blatant psycho
analysis.
The moral in this case, of course, was
this: Don't mess with the smart kid, be
cause he might come after you with a
giant robot. Another episode of the same
show went as far as to prominently fea
ture the school psychologist, who, if I re
member correctly, was hypnotizing kids
and forcing them to do evil things.
It does seem odd that a show so obsessed
with psychology would vilify the psychol
ogist, but it all points to a profound re
spect for, coupled with an immense fear
of, Ihe inner workings of the mind This
show dealt with psychology' like a chimp
operating a nuclear reactor. The new

"Superfriends" show, also on Cartoon Network, has a comparable fascina
tion with psychology.
Some people say that what we call evil is just what we don't understand.
Attempts to explain supcrvillains as products of psychological trauma don't
get rid of this fear of the unknown, they just displace it. We may feel we un
derstand the villains better, but now the mind has become a dark and mys
terious thing. When the comics wax psychological, you can bet that some
thing is wrong â€” as they might say, horribly wrong.
It is interesting that, while the writers of the "Batman" show, at least,
have accepted Freudian psychology whole-heartedly, our leaders do not
feel a similar need to explain our enemies. We don't talk about how the Axis
of Evil got that way. Commentators on the Saddam Hussein trial are un
likely to speculate on Mr. Hussein's rough childhood.
What would it look like if we tried to understand tyrants and terrorists in
the way we understand comic book villains? A lot like Kim Jong-11 singing
"I'm so Lonely" in Team America. That scenc is funny precisely because we
don't usually think of tyrants that way. In real life, unlike in the comics, we
do not always have the luxury of exploring our enemies' troubled child
hoods. Whereas we like to get cozy with our supcrvillains' psychoses, in
most cases we still prefer to see our real-life enemies as just plain evil.
