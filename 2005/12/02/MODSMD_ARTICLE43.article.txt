# Top Ten Super Anti-Heroes
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION ROOFTOP VIGILANTE 
1. Rorschach ("Watchmcn" by Alan Moore) Greatest moment: While impris
oned in a jail with convicts who were all put there by him, Rorschach kills a
criminal by throwing cooking fat on his face. He proceeds to scream "None of
you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. You're locked up in here
with me!"

2. Ilatman ("Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller) Greatest mo
ment: Settles the question of who would win in a fight by kicking
Superman's ass and then faking his own death of a heart attack

3. Marv ("Sin City: The Hard Goodbye" by Frank Miller)
Greatest moment: In his hunt for the man who framed
him, Marv must fight a mute cannibal named Kevin.
Armed with a hacksaw and a tourniquet, Marv saws off
Kevin's limbs and throws his stump into a hungry pack of
wolves. Kevin never screams.

i. The Punisher ("Welcome Back, Frank" by Garth Ennis)
Greatest moment: Frank Castle takes out mobsters left and
right. He gets cornered in the Bronx Zoo and a goon with
a machine gun follows him into the polar bear pit. In one
of the greatest uses of silhouette, the bear swipes the
goon's head off with one angry flick of his wrist.

5. Hellhuy ("Seed of Destruction" by Mike Mignola)

Greatest moment: Hellboy is the son of the Devil. You can't
get much more badass than that, especially if your right hand is
stone and you fight demons with a very large gun.

6. John Constantino ("Hellblazer" by Garth Ennis) Greatest mo
ment: Though the movie with *gag* Keanu Reeves doesn't quite
measure up to the foul-mouthed belligerent John of the Hellblazer
books, you can't deny that flipping Satan the bird is pretty classic.

7. Wolverine ("Uncanny X-men" by Chris Claremont) Greatest mo
ment: Logan gets separated from the rest of his X-friends and corners a
henchman. Painfully. He pops two of his three unbreakable adamantium
claws on each side of the man's neck and snarls, "Wanna go for three,
bub?"

8. Namor, the Sub-Mariner ("Marvel Comics" by Bill Everett) Greatest
moment: Back when the giant Marvel was still called Timely Comics,
Namor helped fight Nazis alongside heroes like Captain America and the
Human Torch. He often fought these same heroes because h»was Prince of
Atlantis and was pissed at the drylander's pollution. Oh, and he's nuts.

I The Incredible Hulk ("The Incredible Hulk" by Stan Lee) Greatest
Moment: Hulk smashes everything. 'NutT said.

10. Captain America ("Ultimates" by Mark Millar) Greatest
moment: T his hardcore Cap takes down the wife-beating
Giant man, kicks the Hulk in the babymaker, jumps out

of planes 6(H) feet up with no parachute and nails the
Wasp. After beating down an alien invader, he
points to the"A" on his forehead and says "You
think this letter on mv head stands for France?"

1. Rorschach ("Watchmcn" by Alan Moore) Greatest moment: While impris
oned in a jail with convicts who were all put there by him, Rorschach kills a
