## Roxy wants to make sure those sexy superpowers don't go to waste 
### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Not feeling so super these days are you? Let's
face it —no one looks sexy in either a parka or
Meyer Library. The rapid approach of finals has
taken its toll on our decently attractive peers. Even
sorority girls are sporting day-old mascara rings as
badges of all-nighter honor. In sum, no one's im
mune system is all that bullet-proof (Roxy thanks

victims of the pinkeye plague for the

temporary celibacy), and the only sin
gle-bound leap anyone's making is
into bed...alone.

Yes, there is a distinct lack of possible
Batmans a la Christian Bale, and not a i

single Charlize-like Aeon Flux to be

found — present company excluded.
So what is to be done? It would be a ,
critical error to lose the next twoj
weeks to the all-too-common pre-'
final/winter slump. If you think about

it, this is really your last chance to
get some serious play before a very
long three weeks back home. And
no. Sleeping with high school

friends is never cool. Not even for freshmen. Just
no. Don't even... No, stop looking at me like that.
Friends don't let friends throw away ripe sexu
al opportunities, and from here on out, Roxy is

your wing girl. You lucky duck you. My first order
of business is a) to prove to you that there are super
heroes who walk among us, and b) to show you
how to get them into bed in a timely manner that
will fit your finals schedule. What are friends for?
So without further ado, here are the superheroes
(and heroines) of Stanford University. Happy
hunting:

L The Tongue Twister: Couldn't help starting
off with my personal favorite. Alias: That mild
mannered Asian guy in your earth systems section,
you know, the one that can't make eye contact but

cares passionately about seal pups. Powers;

Whether or not this boy is packing downstairs,

he more than makes up for it with what he's
got behind that shy smile. His can do with his
tongue what the rest of us couldn't do with
the entire inventory of Good Vibrations.

What's more — he likes it. How to recog
nize him: He's always off to Braun to prac
-1 tice the French horn. He just can't help

gnawing on his Bics over Apuleius in
' the Bender Room. He's the guy who
actually buys Fun Dip in front of you
at Tres Ex. How to snag him: Flaunt
your teeth-marked pencils in lecture.

And I know it's cheap, but even Roxy's not above
sucking down an Astro-pop in front of a potential
target. After all, just because he likes dining down
town doesn't mean he's not going to expect some

thing for dessert.
2. Thunder Thighs: Everything you didn't
know you wanted. Alias: The cute rugby player
with the long blond ponytail who smiled at you

over the Wilbur salad bar. Powers: A grip that ri-

vals the jaws of life... but you know, in a good

way. Thunder Thighs puts the TH in thrust

baby. And I'm not just saying that because
we're BFF. She's even taught Roxy a trick or

two over the years. Rest assured, if you're

smart enough to bag this femme fatale, not only
will you have a permanent defense against the
winter chill, but you'll be feeling like a spoiled

stable pony in no time... what with all the rid-

ing and a11... oh you got it the first time?

Okay. How to snag her She's gonna
want a man who doesn't mind spending'
some time on his back, so it's up to you to

present yourself as exactly that. So

you're a bit metro... that's a start. Maybe
let her cut in line at Subway next time you see her.
Just don't utter the words "junk in the trunk" and
you should be home free.
3. The Freshman Phantasm: Sorry guys, but my
last one's gonna be for my girls. This has actually
been a topic of much debate among Roxy's posse,
but I believe we've arrived at a consensus. Fresh
man men (yes, men, not menchildren or any deriv
ative thereof) are where it's at. Hey wait, come
back! I'm serious! Just listen. Alias: That some

what nervous looking guy in the Bugle Boy T-shirt
agonizing over "Augustine's Confessions" at the
Bookstore coffee shop. Powers: If it was up to him,
you would never be uncomfortable for the rest of

your life. Not only is he undyingly loyal,

but if you are ever cold, hungry,

thirsty, lonely, down-and-out.

stressed out, grumpy or horny,

he will make it his mission to
remedy the situation for you.
Stat. Inexperienced you say?
Poppycock. Anyone who

knows you can't teach an old

dog new tricks knows you

can't train a jaded senior to

spoon you like you de
serve. Among other
things... How to recog
nize him: He's the one

who hands you his beer
when you take a step toward the keg, the one who
asks you about your URO grant with the enthusi
asm of a man hankering fora hummer, not to men
tion the one who's beyond grateful when a BJ is ac
tually in the cards. How to snag him: Show up. Tell
him to take off his pants.
Roxy could go on, but the clock is tickin' and
Pub Crawl's a callin'. But please, take my words to
heart. If you can't let a smile be your umbrella, a
good fuck is the perfect substitute.


Not to toot my own horn...


So cute I'd kill your sex drive.
