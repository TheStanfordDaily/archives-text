# Gift ideas for the one who has it all
## 
### SINI MATIKAINEN INTERMISSION SHOPAHOLIC 
The typical holiday
gift guide will offer
something for
"women," "children,"
"executive," maybe
even "the person who
has everything." But
what about those odd
balls in your life who
just refuse to fit into
traditional categories?
Luckily for you, the
delightfully "wacky"
funusual.com has you
covered.
For the child alcoholic:
small car martini glass

Some children have
moved beyond Legos and My Little Tony,
straight to martinis and vermouth. Recapture the
innocence of childhood with a gift that combines
the fun of toy cars with the tragedy of a young life
spiraling out of control.

For the ignorant, culture-destroying colonialist
Rudy the Tiki Head Tissue Box
Nothing screams "denigration of native cul

ture" like a poor mimicry of the Easter Island
statue which provides tissues instead of a site for

important religious rituals. Aunt
Victoria will love it!
For people who prefer anthropo
morphized kitchen utensils to real
people: Anna the corkscrew
Anna the corkscrew is always
happy to help. She'll never talk
back or question whether you real
ly need to open another bottle of
wine.

For Jewish people: Oy Vey Mug
Many Jewish people do not

celebrate
Christmas. This
may seem like
quite a conun
drum when

searching for
presents, but luckily, there is a
solution: a mug with some
thing written on it, presum
ably in some language spoken
by Jewish people.

For the sadist/cheapskate:
Don't break the bottle puzzle
Either you enjoy watching people suffer or

you see no reason to waste a good bottle of wine
on your obnoxious dormmates. Either way,

you'll be satisfied.
For the fisherman: Fish chair/ot
toman
There's nothing a fisherman loves
more than fish. Catching them, talk
ing about them, receiving dozens of
presents adorned with them. But is
just looking at a talking bass plaque,
wearing a fishing hat and using a
salmon watch enough? Shouldn't he
have an appropriately fishy chair to
sit in, too?

For people who have
trouble communicat
ing: Tonight/Not
Tonight pillow
Sometimes, peo-

ple get upset when you try to talk
to them. Better to let a pillow
convey all the important mes
sages while you sleep peacefully
in bed. Bonus: Doubles as an un
subtle sign to your roommate
when thrown into the hall.

For the (mildlv) wacky: Small Toucan Pen
Nothing says "eccentric" like taking notes in

Math 51 with a toucan pen. When you're using a
pen with feathers on it, hijinks can't help but

ensue!
Disclaimer: Hijinks do
not necessarily ensue.
See warranty for details.
For people who love
puns: Me-Owe Cat
Bank
This is actually a
trick. Nobody loves
puns.
For people who don't
actually know what ten
nis halls are for Mini
tennis balls for small
dogs
Conventional wis-

dom might dictate that
tennis balls are used for playing tennis. Some
might disagree. For them, the mini-tennis ball -
like a regular tennis ball, except smaller and de
signed exclusively for small dogs to slobber on.

For those who will never, ever be dean enough:
Wash Away Your Sins Soap
If only real sins could be washed away so easi
ly. But the stain from last Saturday night will
never really come out, will it?


Ah-choo! I have the snuffles


You want I should go thirsty?


Man, that's sure fishy
