# This duel ain't no Alexander Hamiliton vs. Aaron Burr

### TAM VO INTERMISSION DUELER 
I flew to New York fora press jun-

ket thinking that the only kind of
villainy I'd encounter would be in
the form of the Snow Witch from
"The Chronicles of Narnia" or
crazy former Women's Wear
Daily staffer Peter Braunstein in
the subway. Boy, was I wrong.
While most first-time visitors
head to Times Square, I found
myself heading to a fashion duel.
That's right, a modern-day battle
with pins and needles, not pistols
or bayonets. The location of the
2nd Annual Master-Disaster
Fashion Duel thrown by
LVHRD ("live hard") Founda
tion last Monday was as secret as
the Batcave, as the location is
never revealed until the last
minute, via text-message to its
members. LVHRD describes it
self as "part private club, part
flashmob (hence the last-minute
directions), part creative salon...a
new way of bringing creative peo
ple together." And what better
way than a fashion duel straight
out of "Zoolander," minus the
walk-off?

It's a veritable Justice League of
Style. The motley crew of LVHRD
members who show up are power
players in their field, whether they be
musicians, wordsmiths, tech geniuses,
artists, dancers, designers, editors or
appreciators of it all.
Given a parcel of fabrics and mate
rials/supplies (one needle, 50 straight
pins, Velcro, spray adhesive, scissors,
etc.), two designers must compete to
create an outfit on a live model that
best represents the night's theme. In
one hour. While everyone watches.

With a coin toss, the models were
chosen, the parcels of fabric were dis
tributed and the theme was declared.
As an "Iron Chef' junkie, I secretly

hoped that the theme would be food
related, something along the lines of
"Foie Gras," "Strawberry Cheese
cake" or "Salmon Roe." But no, vil
lainy it was!
Up-and-coming designer Rebecca
Turbow (www.rebeccaturbow.com)
of Safe Clothes was pitted against
well-established designer Corey Pak
of American Eagle Outfitters. A ris
ing newbie (taken from LVHRD's
members) always has to fight a sea
soned veteran of the field.
The two competitors were separat
ed by a black screen, so only the mod

els, towering on pedestals, could
glimpse each other.
Team Pak was swigging Coronas in
between mouthfuls of straight pins, in
tent on fashioning amber-colored

devil horns and a matching top for
their model. On the other side,
Turbow and her assistant, photog
rapher Alix Winsby, had looks of
steely determination, bent on in
corporating Turbow's trademark
motifs of circles and swirls into the
design.
Team Turbow fashioned a
luxe bead necklace out of dark
blue textured satin for her model,
transforming her into a vision fit
for Bergdorf Goodman. Channel
ing Wonder Woman, Turbow
whipped up a fabric tiara, wristlets
and a garter that every supermod
el supervillain should own.
Team Pak paired the sinister
devil horns with equally conical
Madonna-esque breasts (over
done and truly disturbing) and an
intricately draped and gathered
grey bubble skirt. They draped a
furry stole around her shoulders,
suggesting that the devil really
does wear Prada.

In the final five minutes, the
frenzy of the crowd, fueled by Red
Bull and vodka martinis, was more in
tense than the finishing touches the
designers put on the outfits. The two
models, Julia and Angel, glared at


Man, that blood sure doesn't come out
