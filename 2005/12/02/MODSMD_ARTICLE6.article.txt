## Hoover fellow outlines insurgency solution Diamond argues against immediate troop withdrawal 
### AARON QAYUMI 
Last night Prof. Larry Diamond, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution, talked about
the complex situation between Iraq and the
U.S. and advocated finding political means to
whittle down the Iraqi insurgent base.
Diamond acknowledged that the current
situation has many elements of a quagmire and

explained that presently "we rein a situation in
which we cannot stay and we cannot leave." 1 le
furthered explained that in order to narrow the
insurgency the U.S. needs to make it clear that
when Iraq is no longer in need of U.S. assis
tance, the troops will leave.
According to Diamond, the U.S.'s presence
is a destabilizing incentive for insurgency he
cause the people view their country as under
foreign occupation and "they want it back"
At the same time. Diamond stressed that
the troops cannot withdraw immediately — in
a matter of six months as one senator proposed

— because it would cause an eruption of re
gional strife.
The conflict would have regional implica
tions because Iraq's bordering countries
"think they have a stake" in what happens in
Iraq. Diamond said. The Sunni countries Jor
dan. Syria and Saudi Arabia would feel com
pelled to aid the Sunni Iraqis, while Iran would
support the Shiite Iraqis.
The solution that Diamond provided tar
geted at narrowing the base of insurgents in
Prof.

stays hopeful

Iraq. Since this base draws strongly from
Iraqis afraid of an indefinite US. occupa
tion, it must be made clear to them that we
are not seeking permanent military bases
in Iraq.
"It has baffled me why the administra
tion has been so reluctant to make a clear
and declarative statement in this regard,"
Diamond said. The only reason he could
offer for this is that the US. has in fact been
seeking permanent, long term military
bases in Iraq.
However, Diamond expressed cause
for hope. Since the late 2(X)3 transfer of
power over Iraq operations to the Nation
al Securities Council under then-National
Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, adjust
ments have been made.
Diamond said he felt that though the
outreach effort to marginalized Sunnis
and Iraqis angered by occupation seems
much too partial, too slow and too late, at
least it is accelerating.
Diamond summarized his main points
by concluding that it is possible for all eth
nic and political groups to realize that they
are more likely to protect their interests by
playing peaceful politics than they are with
descent into civil war.
Diamond further said he felt that the
U.S. suffers from low credibility within and
of its border and that it will need to mend
this credibility, because even if the country
manages to stabilize Iraq, the War on Ter
ror will rage on for decades.
