## World AIDS day raises support for victims 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Across the world — including Stan
ford's campus — people sported a red rib
bon yesterday as a sign of support for those
living with HIV/AIDS and to mark the an
nual international day of action against the
disease — known as World AIDS day.
World AIDS day was conceived and
adopted unanimously by 140 countries
meeting at the World Summit of Ministers
of Health on AIDS in London in January
1988.The day was envisaged as an opportu
nity for governments, national AIDS pro
grams, non-governmental and local organi
zations, as well as individuals everywhere,
to demonstrate both the importance they

attached to the fight against AIDS and their
solidarity in this effort.
Later that same year, the United Nations
General Assembly at its 38th plenary meet
ing on Oct. 27, "Prevention and control of
AIDS", noted that the World Health Orga
nization had declared Dec. I. 1968 World
AIDS Day and stressed the importance of
the appropriate observance of that occasion.
Through Stanford's campus, there were
several events to commemorate World
AIDS Day this week. In Hammarskjold
Lounge this past Wednesday, there was a
film screening of "Everyone's Child," which
explored the painful lives of AIDS orphans
in Africa amidst stigma and poverty.
Yesterday a service was held at Memor
ial Church at noon.The Office for Religious

Life, in cooperation with the Stanford com
munity organizational efforts for World
AIDS Day, put on the event to remember
those who have lost their lives to
HIV/AIDS and all those who lost family
members or friends to AIDS.
Speakers at the memorial service in
cluded Rev. Joanne Sanders, the associate
dean for religious life. Rev. Richard Foster,
the pastor of the Episcopal Lutheran Cam
pus Ministry at Stanford, and senior Jason
Sierra. In a ritual those in attendance were
allowed to light candles and say a few words
about those who had lost their lives to
AIDS, a tribute that moved nearly every
one in attendance to tears.

Attendees light candles in memory of AIDS victims
at yesterday's ceremony held in Memorial Church
to mark World AIDS day.
"There are 25 million orphans in
Africa being reared on the streets
without morals or any support; this
day will hopefully one day be com
memorated as something that has
passed, not as a day of mourning,"
Foster said.
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neuniann,
the senior associate dean for religious
life, closed the service with a Kaddish,
a mourner's prayer.
According to the UNAIDS Web
site, the United Nations joint pro
gram on HIV/AIDS in 2(X)5 estimat
ed 40 million people are now living
with HIV/AIDS, with more than
half of them living in sub-Saharan
Africa. Of every 50 HIV/AIDS vic
tims in Africa, only one on average
has access to treatment — on a con
tinent where more than half the vic
tims are women, where 10 million of
the victims are between 15 and 24
and where just 1 percent of pregnant
women are treated so as to avoid the
transmission of the virus to their
newborns.
This year, the grim figures have
risen again. By the end of the year,
HIV will have infected an additional
5 million people and will have killed 3
million. 95 percent of the victims live
in developing countries — and it is
believed that eventually China and
India could surpass Africa in the inci
dence rate of AIDS.
