# FACULTY SENATE
## Graduate student life analyzed Diversity and quality of education addressed 
### JAMES HOHMANN WORLD NATION EDITOR 
The Commission on Graduate Education
(CGE) recommended last night at the biweek
ly Faculty Senate meeting that a full-time vice
provost for graduate education be hired. This
position, which would be modeled on the vice
provost for undergraduate education job cur
rently held by John Bravman, was suggested as
one of 18 recommendations and 49 sub-recom
mendations in a wide-ranging report on how to
improve graduate education in all seven
schools and 15 degree programs at the Univer
sity.
Ilie Commission had been charged early in
the year to study how the University can create
leaders who are able to address large scale,
complex problems of the 21st century in a cre
ative, collaborative and interdisciplinary way.
"Our recommendations are intended to
create a framework that will begin a process
that will allow graduate students to have access
to an increasingly better graduate program,"
said GCE co-chair and Graduate School of
Business Prof. Charles Holloway of the report.
lhe report divided its recommendations
into three areas â€” fostering intellectual inno
vation, optimizing the graduate experience
and improving the University's organizational
responsiveness and flexibility.
Co-chair and Computer Science Prof. Mark
Horowitz explained some of the key recom
mendations to the faculty representatives.
In order to bring faculty members together
from different departments who might not
ever otherwise speak to one another, the com
mittee proposed internal sabbaticals fora Fac
ulty Academy. This would bring professors to
gether to study a broad topic and discuss ap
proaches from different disciplines and depart
ments.
The commission also recommended creat
ing a Stanford Graduate Institute that would
be modeled after the popular and successful
Sophomore College program available to un
dergraduates preceding their sophomore year.
The program could be made available to in
coming or first year master's students who seek
a broader perspective on an issue of interest to
them.
The commission leaders told faculty that
the report's recommendations were designed
to help improve the quality of graduate educa
tion, not hinder it with even more bureaucracy.
"We want to create new opportunities, not
enforce uniformity," Horowitz said.
After presenting a half-hour, 16-slide Pow
erPoint presentation summarizing the com
mission's recommendations, the co-chairs took
questions for 30 minutes.
Thomas Lee, a graduate student in the
School of Engineering and co-chair of the
Graduate Student Council, expressed three
concerns about the report. He said the ASSU
Diversity Committee felt the commission did
not place enough of a priority on ethnic and
gender diversity, did not mention supplemen
tary skills and did not provide enough support
for student activities at the graduate level.
The complaint about diversity was echoed
bv at least five members of the faculty. One
