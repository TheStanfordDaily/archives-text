Tired of sitting in a classroom?
Do you want to grind up plants,
grow red and green bacteria,
purify proteins,
and shine a laser at pigments?
Then this Freshman Seminar:
Light, Pigments and Organisms
(Biol7N/Cheml7N)
Is the course for you!
This is a multi-disciplinary lab
course, focusing on pigments and
their functions in organisms. It is
a great chance for freshman
students to get lab experience.
