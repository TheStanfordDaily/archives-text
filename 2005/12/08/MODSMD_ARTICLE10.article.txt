### HAMZA HENDAWI ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam
Hussein followed through Wednesday on
his threat to boycott his trial, and the
court adjourned until after next week's
national elections. Gunmen, meanwhile,
kidnapped the 8-year-old son of a body
guard fora judge in the case.
Inside the courtroom, one of Saddam's
seven co-defendants lashed out at condi
tions of his own detention, saying guards
offered only "the worst brands" of ciga
rettes.
Barazan Ibrahim's outburst came a
day after' Saddam, his half brother,
warned that he would not return to the
"unjust" court to protest the conditions of
his detention. The group is on trial in the
deaths of more than 140 Shiite Muslims
following a 1982 assassination attempt
against him.
The court convened Wednesday after
four hours of behind-the-scenes consulta
tions failed to resolve the standoff. After
hearing from two more witnesses. Chief
Judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin ad
journed the hearings until Dec. 21—six
days after the parliamentary elections,
which officials fear may coincide with a
spike in insurgent violence.
Court official Raid Juhi insisted that
Saddam did not boycott the hearing but
that the court "decided he should be re
moved" after the closed-door consulta
tions. Juhi said Saddam would be in court
Dec. 21.
However, a statement released in
Amman, Jordan, by Saddam s legal team
said the former president stayed away to
protest alleged mistreatment by an "ille
gal" court.
"President Saddam Hussein refused to
attend the sessions of the extraordinary
court that was created by the United
States government as the occupying
power of Iraq, claiming that the court is il
legal and cannot provide a fair trial," the
statement said.
Saddam's lawyers and the other defen
dants were on hand when Amin convened
the session at 3 p.m., about four hours
after the normal starting time. The chief
judge said the court would brief Saddam
on the proceedings that took place during
his absence.
The 8-year-old boy, Karim Salam, was
grabbed TUesday as he played in front of
his parents' house in the eastern Baghdad

neighborhood of Kamsarah. according to
his father, Salam Hirmiz Gorgis.
"At about 5:30 p.m. a car came here,"
Gorgis told AP Television News. "They
took my son, put him in the car and left,"
Gorgis works for one of the trial's five
judges. The judge's identity cannot be re
vealed because of special security meas
ures. Two attorneys representing co-de
fendants have been assassinated since the
trial began Oct. 19.
During Wednesday's session, Ibrahim,
head of Iraqi intelligence during the Dujail
incident, told the court that he had spent
more than eight months in solitary confine
ment in a windowless facility without air
conditioning, electricity or running water.
"I couldn't tell if it was day or night,"

he said.
"We are prisoners of the wealthiest
and most powerful nation, yet, since four
months ago, they are giving me six ciga
rettes a day from the worst brands."
Ibrahim said guards would force him
and other prisoners to exercise before
dawn or during the hottest time of the
day. At the slightest breach of prison
rules, punishment included the withhold
ing of cigarettes, tea or by reducing food
rations, he added.
" When I was detained I was wearing pa
jamas that I kept wearing for nine months
until my brother came and gave me a dish
dasha"—a traditional robe—he said.
"For one year I did not drink tea or
coffee. We had little food," he recalled.

Ibrahim said he lost nearly 40 pounds
in two months. He said things are better
now and they have air conditioning and
cold water.
"Is this America the protector of
human rights?" he said.
Ibrahim sought to distance himself
from the Dujail events, saying that his po
sition as head of intelligence then was a
"political post," and that the treatment of
prisoners was not the responsibility of the
security services.
"Once prisoners are handed over to
prisons, they are the responsibility of the
department of social affairs," he said. "I
am not a jailer. I am a political official."
The court also heard from a male wit
ness who testified behind a curtain to con
ceal his identity. He told of being arrested
after the assassination attempt and being
taken to the local Baath Party headquar
ters, where he found people "screaming
because of the beatings."
The witness said Ibrahim was present.
"When my turn came, the investigator
asked me my name and he turned to
Barazan (Ibrahim) and asked him/What
shall we do with him?'" the witness said.
" Barazan replied: Take him. He might be
useful.' We were almost dead because of
the beatings."
When questioned by Amin, however,
the witness said he was blindfolded at the
time and thought Ibrahim was present be
cause other prisoners told him so.
The witness said he was taken later to
Baghdad "in a closed, crowded van that
had no windows."
"When we arrived at the building,they
asked us to stand along the wall," he said.
"We were told to stand only on one
foot and we stayed in this position for two
hours before we were taken to cells with
red walls. I was thirsty, but the water was
very hot."
After a few days, the witness said, he
was moved to "Hall 63" where "we were
kept handcuffed for five days with little
food and very hot water (to drink). They
used to take some persons and bring them
back naked. The signs of torture were
clear on their bodies."
A second witness, whose identity was
also concealed, said he and his entire fam
ily were rounded up from their Dujail
home and imprisoned for four years.
He said that while in the notorious
Abu Ghraib prison, he and other de
tainees were subjected to torture, sleep
deprivation and beatings.

sition as head of intelligence then was a
"political post," and that the treatment of
prisoners was not the responsibility of the
security services.
"Once prisoners are handed over to
prisons, they are the responsibility of the
department of social affairs," he said. "I
am not a jailer. I am a political official."
The court also heard from a male wit
ness who testified behind a curtain to con
ceal his identity. He told of being arrested
after the assassination attempt and being
taken to the local Baath Party headquar
ters, where he found people "screaming
because of the beatings."
The witness said Ibrahim was present.
"When my turn came, the investigator
asked me my name and he turned to
Barazan (Ibrahim) and asked him/What
shall we do with him?'" the witness said.
" Barazan replied: Take him. He might be
useful.' We were almost dead because of
the beatings."
When questioned by Amin, however,
the witness said he was blindfolded at the
time and thought Ibrahim was present be
cause other prisoners told him so.
The witness said he was taken later to
Baghdad "in a closed, crowded van that
had no windows."
"When we arrived at the building,they
asked us to stand along the wall," he said.
"We were told to stand only on one
foot and we stayed in this position for two
hours before we were taken to cells with
red walls. I was thirsty, but the water was
very hot."
After a few days, the witness said, he
was moved to "Hall 63" where "we were
kept handcuffed for five days with little
food and very hot water (to drink). They
used to take some persons and bring them
back naked. The signs of torture were
clear on their bodies."
A second witness, whose identity was
also concealed, said he and his entire fam
ily were rounded up from their Dujail
home and imprisoned for four years.
He said that while in the notorious
Abu Ghraib prison, he and other de
tainees were subjected to torture, sleep
deprivation and beatings.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Saddam
Hussein followed through Wednesday on
his threat to boycott his trial, and the
court adjourned until after next week's
national elections. Gunmen, meanwhile,
kidnapped the 8-year-old son of a body
guard fora judge in the case.
Inside the courtroom, one of Saddam's
seven co-defendants lashed out at condi
tions of his own detention, saying guards
offered only "the worst brands" of ciga
rettes.
Barazan Ibrahim's outburst came a
day after' Saddam, his half brother,
warned that he would not return to the
"unjust" court to protest the conditions of
his detention. The group is on trial in the
deaths of more than 140 Shiite Muslims
following a 1982 assassination attempt
against him.
The court convened Wednesday after
four hours of behind-the-scenes consulta
tions failed to resolve the standoff. After
hearing from two more witnesses. Chief
Judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin ad
journed the hearings until Dec. 21—six
days after the parliamentary elections,
which officials fear may coincide with a
spike in insurgent violence.
Court official Raid Juhi insisted that
Saddam did not boycott the hearing but
that the court "decided he should be re
moved" after the closed-door consulta
tions. Juhi said Saddam would be in court
Dec. 21.
However, a statement released in
Amman, Jordan, by Saddam s legal team
said the former president stayed away to
protest alleged mistreatment by an "ille
gal" court.
"President Saddam Hussein refused to
attend the sessions of the extraordinary
court that was created by the United
States government as the occupying
power of Iraq, claiming that the court is il
legal and cannot provide a fair trial," the
statement said.
Saddam's lawyers and the other defen
dants were on hand when Amin convened
the session at 3 p.m., about four hours
after the normal starting time. The chief
judge said the court would brief Saddam
on the proceedings that took place during
his absence.
The 8-year-old boy, Karim Salam, was
grabbed TUesday as he played in front of
his parents' house in the eastern Baghdad

neighborhood of Kamsarah. according to
his father, Salam Hirmiz Gorgis.
"At about 5:30 p.m. a car came here,"
Gorgis told AP Television News. "They
took my son, put him in the car and left,"
Gorgis works for one of the trial's five
judges. The judge's identity cannot be re
vealed because of special security meas
ures. Two attorneys representing co-de
fendants have been assassinated since the
trial began Oct. 19.
During Wednesday's session, Ibrahim,
head of Iraqi intelligence during the Dujail
incident, told the court that he had spent
more than eight months in solitary confine
ment in a windowless facility without air
conditioning, electricity or running water.
"I couldn't tell if it was day or night,"

he said.
"We are prisoners of the wealthiest
and most powerful nation, yet, since four
months ago, they are giving me six ciga
rettes a day from the worst brands."
Ibrahim said guards would force him
and other prisoners to exercise before
dawn or during the hottest time of the
day. At the slightest breach of prison
rules, punishment included the withhold
ing of cigarettes, tea or by reducing food
rations, he added.
" When I was detained I was wearing pa
jamas that I kept wearing for nine months
until my brother came and gave me a dish
dasha"—a traditional robe—he said.
"For one year I did not drink tea or
coffee. We had little food," he recalled.

Ibrahim said he lost nearly 40 pounds
in two months. He said things are better
now and they have air conditioning and
cold water.
"Is this America the protector of
human rights?" he said.
Ibrahim sought to distance himself
from the Dujail events, saying that his po
sition as head of intelligence then was a
"political post," and that the treatment of
