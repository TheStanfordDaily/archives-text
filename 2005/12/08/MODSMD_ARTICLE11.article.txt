Alcohol is a wonderful thing. Sublime and lubri
cating, it stands alone among the panoply of
drugs. As alluring as happiness and as übiqui
tous as misery, nothing can caress and cajole
the mediocrity of everyday life into something more
with quite such effect.
1 would like to claim that 1 fell in love with booze at
first sight, but with alcohol the love is true and deep, not
sordid and shallow. So, as with girls and boys (and per
mutations thereof), it takes a little while to develop a
relationship.
The problem with love, however, is that it can be
blinding. And so it goes with drinking (and not just

when you're knocking back the moonshine like it's
water). When you immerse yourself in something for
long enough, it permeates every part of your life with
out the conscious realization of what's happening.
And. before you've noticed, you've lost something.
To find out what that something is, one needs time
apart — a trial separation, if you will. So, after nine
years of hitting the bottle to different degrees, I decid
ed to stop.
Fora year and a day 1 promised not to ingest any
thing that had even the smallest hint of ethanol. That
was 349 days ago, and now that the year is officially in
its death throes, 1 thought I share the story.
Hie most interesting thing about my experiment is
a word — a word that has been a constant refrain both
in quiet contemplative moments and in raucous,
rowdy bars. That word? Well, it's really a question:
"Why?"
The frequency of the question, and the tone in
which it is most often asked, is almost its own answer
— for the universal surprise at a decision not to drink
has within it shades of a deep-seated and invidious ad
diction.
Not the kind of addiction that leaves you in clinics
and threatens your life. Rather, the more subtle kind
that prevents you from trying anything new and
threatens your spirit.
Inevitability is not a good thing. Most of us (at least
while we're young) struggle to stand out, to be indi
vidualists. Yet all of us seem to unequivocally equate
going out, partying and having fun with drinking.

I've had several conversations this year about plans for the
evening that went something like this:
"What shall we do tonight?"
"Go out to a bar/party/club."
"But you don't drink..."
The notion that we need to drink in order to social
ize is discomforting. It's not a completely universal at
titude, but it is one that I and most of my friends held.
Having blissfully latched onto this idea for several
years, 1 found myself undergoing a change of perspec
tive in graduate school.
With our social lives now run by the GSC, pauses be
tween imbibition are greater and so one has more time
to reflect on the futility of it all. Without the ability to
lose oneself among the hordes of fellow drinkers, the na
ture of the "need" becomes all the more apparent.
Furthermore, here in the wasteland, it's easier to
see just how much we rely on the bottle to guide us
through those socially awkward moments.
I must admit, though, that being somewhat socially
awkward myself I generally felt that this particular
quality of alcohol was a serious bonus.
With sufficient numbers of stiff gins and tonics in
me, I used to find that my (entirely justified) reticence
to approaching the dance floor would drift away, leav
ing me free to make (as we used to say back in the
home country) some serious shapes.
Now, said shapes were fairly disturbing to anyone
who wasn't sloshing around in similar levels of moth
ers' ruin, so it's unclear whether getting me to dance
was really a serious benefit, either to society or to me.
(I'm reliably informed that my flailing arms were re
sponsible for several terrified girls and jat least one
bloody nose).
Anyway, without the drink to spur me on I found
myself spending most of my nights out at dancing ven
ues sitting at the bar or trying desperately to look enig
matic while leaning against a suitable pillar (difficult to
do in California — no cigarettes allowed and all that).
Sadly, fora physics graduate student "enigmatic" is
an even harder act to pull off than coordinated (espe
cially at the F&A on a Saturday night).and I think that
instead, I probably pulled off grumpy and miserable.
Of course, alcohol doesn't just get you strutting
your stuff — it also boosts your self-confidence. In
fact, if you wanted a single reason to explain the übiqui
ty of drinking, it would be that booze is confidence in a
bottle.
It evens a playing field in which a handful of tall, el
egant rich kids seem to stroll effortlessly by, leaving the
rest of us seeking an easy way to obtain such self-assur
ance.
When I started this little project of mine 1 was back
home in London, and very early on in the experiment I
found myself discussing the plan with an old university
buddy. After looking at me like I had gone mad. he laughed
and said: "Well, you're not getting laid fora year then."
This is, I suspect, one of the principal reasons peo
ple are willing to pay the price of a hangover. If alcohol is
the ultimate social lubricant, then it is at its slickest when
working to get eyes to meet across the proverbial crowd
ed room and doing the same for body parts at closer
quarters.
Prior to this year, I think that every time I hooked
up with someone new, both of us were under the influ
ence. Not necessarily drunk, but definitely possessing
measurable blood alcohol levels. And 1 don't think that's
