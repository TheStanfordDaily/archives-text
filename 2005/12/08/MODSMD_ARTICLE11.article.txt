Alcohol is a wonderful thing. Sublime and lubri
cating, it stands alone among the panoply of
drugs. As alluring as happiness and as übiqui
tous as misery, nothing can caress and cajole
the mediocrity of everyday life into something more
with quite such effect.
1 would like to claim that 1 fell in love with booze at
first sight, but with alcohol the love is true and deep, not
sordid and shallow. So, as with girls and boys (and per
mutations thereof), it takes a little while to develop a
relationship.
The problem with love, however, is that it can be
blinding. And so it goes with drinking (and not just

The notion that we need to
drink in order to socialize is
discomforting.

when you're knocking back the moonshine like it's
water). When you immerse yourself in something for
long enough, it permeates every part of your life with
out the conscious realization of what's happening.
And. before you've noticed, you've lost something.
To find out what that something is, one needs time
apart — a trial separation, if you will. So, after nine
years of hitting the bottle to different degrees, I decid
ed to stop.
Fora year and a day 1 promised not to ingest any
thing that had even the smallest hint of ethanol. That
was 349 days ago, and now that the year is officially in
its death throes, 1 thought I share the story.
Hie most interesting thing about my experiment is
a word — a word that has been a constant refrain both
in quiet contemplative moments and in raucous,
rowdy bars. That word? Well, it's really a question:
"Why?"
The frequency of the question, and the tone in
which it is most often asked, is almost its own answer
— for the universal surprise at a decision not to drink
has within it shades of a deep-seated and invidious ad
diction.
Not the kind of addiction that leaves you in clinics
and threatens your life. Rather, the more subtle kind
that prevents you from trying anything new and
threatens your spirit.
Inevitability is not a good thing. Most of us (at least
while we're young) struggle to stand out, to be indi
vidualists. Yet all of us seem to unequivocally equate
going out, partying and having fun with drinking.

I've had several conversations this year about plans for the
evening that went something like this:
"What shall we do tonight?"
"Go out to a bar/party/club."
"But you don't drink..."
The notion that we need to drink in order to social
ize is discomforting. It's not a completely universal at
titude, but it is one that I and most of my friends held.
Having blissfully latched onto this idea for several
years, 1 found myself undergoing a change of perspec
tive in graduate school.
With our social lives now run by the GSC, pauses be
tween imbibition are greater and so one has more time
to reflect on the futility of it all. Without the ability to
lose oneself among the hordes of fellow drinkers, the na
ture of the "need" becomes all the more apparent.
Furthermore, here in the wasteland, it's easier to
see just how much we rely on the bottle to guide us
through those socially awkward moments.
I must admit, though, that being somewhat socially
awkward myself I generally felt that this particular
quality of alcohol was a serious bonus.
With sufficient numbers of stiff gins and tonics in
me, I used to find that my (entirely justified) reticence
to approaching the dance floor would drift away, leav
ing me free to make (as we used to say back in the
home country) some serious shapes.
Now, said shapes were fairly disturbing to anyone
who wasn't sloshing around in similar levels of moth
ers' ruin, so it's unclear whether getting me to dance
was really a serious benefit, either to society or to me.
(I'm reliably informed that my flailing arms were re
sponsible for several terrified girls and jat least one
bloody nose).
Anyway, without the drink to spur me on I found
myself spending most of my nights out at dancing ven
ues sitting at the bar or trying desperately to look enig
matic while leaning against a suitable pillar (difficult to
do in California — no cigarettes allowed and all that).
Sadly, fora physics graduate student "enigmatic" is
an even harder act to pull off than coordinated (espe
cially at the F&A on a Saturday night).and I think that
instead, I probably pulled off grumpy and miserable.
Of course, alcohol doesn't just get you strutting
your stuff — it also boosts your self-confidence. In
fact, if you wanted a single reason to explain the übiqui
ty of drinking, it would be that booze is confidence in a
bottle.
It evens a playing field in which a handful of tall, el
egant rich kids seem to stroll effortlessly by, leaving the
rest of us seeking an easy way to obtain such self-assur
ance.
When I started this little project of mine 1 was back
home in London, and very early on in the experiment I
found myself discussing the plan with an old university
buddy. After looking at me like I had gone mad. he laughed
and said: "Well, you're not getting laid fora year then."
This is, I suspect, one of the principal reasons peo
ple are willing to pay the price of a hangover. If alcohol is
the ultimate social lubricant, then it is at its slickest when
working to get eyes to meet across the proverbial crowd
ed room and doing the same for body parts at closer
quarters.
Prior to this year, I think that every time I hooked
up with someone new, both of us were under the influ
ence. Not necessarily drunk, but definitely possessing
measurable blood alcohol levels. And 1 don't think that's

a terribly unusual situation to be in.
So how did I fare in 2005? Well,
I've heard it said that a gentleman
never tells, but I will say that al
though the year wasn't quite the
drought that my friend had antici
pated, there were numerous encoun
ters that I wish had turned out differ
ently. And during each one. in the
back of my mind I was turning over
the thought that if only I could have
had a drink to steel my nerves, things
would have worked out.
Actually, the frequency of that
thought and the fervor with which I
have been counting down the days to
the end of my year are perhaps a sign
that, at least in this respect, I've failed.
There should never be a "need" in
life fora drug to help you live. Part of
what drove me into this experiment
was the hope that I would emerge no
longer reliant on alcohol to interact
in the ways I would choose.
At best I could claim that I can
now get by flirting without a drink,
but I would prefer not to. At worst,
that's just a delusion, spun so I can
continue to kid myself that I'm not
hopelessly dependent.
That's a sobering thought (and
I'm going to need a lot of those in the
near future) and almost makes this
year seem like a futile exercise. I say
"almost" because there was another
reason behind the project.
I'm a firm believer that existence
should be an adventure. You should
never settle for doing the same thing

over and over again. Unfortunately,
as we go through life it becomes pro
gressively easier to fall into routines.
We go to the same places, eat the
same dishes and hang out with the
same people. We may let our lives
evolve as we find careers, mates and
kids, hut we live Bill Murray's
Groundhog Day in the minutiae, if
not. perhaps, in the larger things.
This fixation often holds an ele
vated status — knowing what you
like is a facet of maturity. However,
I'm not so sure about that. There is
an inherent danger in preference, for
there is far more variety in life than
we could ever hope to experience,
and shutting out anything seems to
me a dangerous policy.
For the more closed-minded of
you. this might seem to be a philoso
phy inconsistent with the idea of ab
staining from something fora year.
However, that would be taking a
very narrow view of experience.
The world is a very different place
when viewed completely without the
tint of a drink. As well as the fact that
everything is now in focus, much of
what you thought you understood
appears in a different light.
From Exotic Erotic to the ab
sence of a quiet post-work drink, life
looks different without the aid of al
cohol. Plus — and I realize that I'm
now treading awfully close to spout
ing pretentious nonsense — you
don't really get to understand and
appreciate a thing with doing the
same for its absence.
Before.during and after these 3bb
days, I held, am holding and will con
tinue to hold the view that drinking
is not a bad thing.
In fact. I'll go even further. Alco

hoi has far more in its favor than
against. Life would he poorer with
out it, and I believe that the fact that
so much of what we do is tied up with
a drug reflects positively on society,
rather than the converse.
I would even argue that America's
greatest problem with drink is not
over-indulgence, but instead the op
posite. The United States' absurd
legal drinking age of 21 is indicative
of a society that refuses to acknowl
edge what it is and who its people are.
To go beyond ourselves is a
dream held by many, and whoever
brewed the first beer set us on a path
that can enable us to do just that.
However, even with the aforemen
tioned benefits, I doubt that such a
dream could ever truly be realized
without a sense of perspective.
And. despite the fact that 1 will
not emerge from my period of absti
nence a stronger person, able to sur
vive equally well without a cocktail
clutched in hand as with. I hope I will
walk away with a more rounded view
on life.
Plus, even if that fails. I've at least
got one more story to tell. Speaking
of which, if you want to hear the rest
of it I'll be savoring my first hour
with alcohol after 8.784 without it by
sipping a martini at Bix as the clock
hits midnight on Dec. 23 — feel free
to join the party.
