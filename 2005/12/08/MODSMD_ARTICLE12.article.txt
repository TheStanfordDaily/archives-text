Buy Property on Mars
There are several billion pieces of
property on Mars, according to The
Lunar Embassy, which claims to be the
only authorized public dealer of non-
Earthly land. Grab a plot while they last!
"Please note that, due to the heavy de
mand, we sell one property after the
next,and are unfortunately unable to as
sure you (that) your property will have
any views on any craters," The Lunar
Embassy says.
With your purchase comes a Martian
Bill of Rights, a Martian Deed, a decla
ration of ownership and a map that
shows the general location of your alien
territory. This potential goldmine could
comfort a senior who was recently re
jected by McKinsey.
