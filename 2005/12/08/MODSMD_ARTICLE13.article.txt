## A
						hipster's guide to the holidays 
### 
You are young and jaded and
don't believe in anything.
You have already written off
the holiday season as a consumerist
orgy, and you are trying to have
your own holiday that will be anti
consumerist, anti-cheesy and thor
oughly ironic.
So you can print out this column
as a how-to guide and put it in your
duct-tape wallet right next to your
tickets to Radiohead.
First, you have to make it clear to
everyone that you are not one of
them. You are not a Happy Holidays
well-wisher, deluded into thinking
this good-natured cheer is genuine.
Thus, you tell people "Merry Fes
tivus," because you are clever and
timely and like quoting Seinfeld
episodes that are eight years old.
Put gifts on your wish list that are
only there to punish your family
members. You want your grand
mother to knit you a scarf that says
"Scarf." You ask your Republican
father for an A1 Franken book and
your liberal mother for an Ann
Coul — never mind, there are some
things that just aren't funny.
Buy fruitcake because that's
wholesome and such a nauseating
slice of Americana that you and
your friends laugh through the
clove-cigarette smoke in your par
ents' basement. You really stick it to
the man by not enjoying the cake —
even though you still paid the
$12.95 for the 30-second chuckle.
But dude, it was worth it.
Get high on sugar cookies.This is
not because you are a hipster, but
because you are human and those
things give you such a rush they
could make James Lipton tap dance
on the ceiling.
Go to Wal-Mart or the mall or Tar
get to laugh at the consumer society,
but realize that even though you are
above this all. that you're in on the en
tire joke that is the rat-race ridicu
lousness for materialistic goods con
cealing the flood of competitive sen
timent... you still have to wait in hours
of traffic for parking.
Look at the people who say
"Happy Holidays" outside the
aforementioned store, and notice
that they are very hesitant to say
anything at all because they are
afraid that from within the iPod
boxes, overflowing purses and
Medium Brown Bags is a team of
Christian Right lawyers ready to
sue for spreading misinformation
about Christmas. Jerry Falwell, dur
ing this season of goodwill, is creat
ing a "Friend or Foe" campaign to

sue people because they aren't
Christian enough for Christmas.
The spirit of giving (wait for it)...
subpoenas.
Wear one of those Santa hats and
try to dress like an Abercombie
model the entire month, fitting in
with the true-believers and the yup
pies that genuinely smile and get
excited about the holiday. And
while they're out at Christmas par
ties, you sit on your couch at home
and TiVo episodes of VHl's "I Love
the Holidays" to find out what else
is retro and ironic about the holi
days. You go to your local video
store and rent "It's a Wonderful
Life," only to prevent somebody
who really wants to watch it from
doing so. But since you're bored,
you end up watching it anyway.
[Hey Editor: what's funny about
this movie? Does anybody remem
ber it? Think of a joke and put it
here.)
So spare me the false cheer, the
sarcastic wishes and the ironic cloth
ing. Wear all black or all red or cor
duroy jackets and Buddy Holly
glasses. 1 don't care. I've convinced
myself the only way I'm going to
make it through this holiday season
is if I smile and nod a lot and save my
sarcasm for when my relatives are
good and drunk and don't know
what Fm saying — like last Thanks
giving, when I told several of them
that because they didn't serve
pumpkin pie, I was going to get a
large offensive tattoo that would ap
pear in all of the family photos. And
since I'm the only one who knows
how to use Photoshop, this threat is
very real.
Of course, the ultimate irony
would be to write a column mock
ing being a hipster and doing ironic
things when you yourself have done
most of these and are, in fact, a hip
ster. Or maybe just a complete jack
ass.

Chris gets bitter when he hasn't had
enough pumpkin pie. Chris's room
mate gets bitter when Chris makes
fun of him in his column on a weekly
basis. Send complaints and fruitcake
to cholt@stanford.edu.
