## Williams not a case for clemency 
### SARAH ESPINOSA 
Yuritzi Jones calls for those
who support the death penal
ity to remember that every
man is assumed innocent until
proven guilty ("NAACP protests
Williams death sentence," Dec. 2). I
have never forgotten that, but 1
strongly disagree with her assertion
that in the case of Stanley "Tookie"
Williams, guilt has not been proven.
Supporters of Williams claim that
the prosecutors based their case on
purely circumstantial evidence and
failed to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that Williams brutally and cal
lously murdered four people.
They ignore the fact that there
was an eyewitness to the crime be
cause the eyewitness, Alfred Cow
ard. was an accomplice who had
been granted immunity.
The prosecution reported the
deal to the jury, as is required by law,
and provided multiple other wit
nesses whose testimony supported
the story told by Coward. The jury
believed the testimony to be credi
ble. Another accomplice. Tony Sims,
who did not receive immunity and
was prosecuted and convicted for
his part in the murders, also gave tes
timony that supported Coward's.
His story has remained unchanged
for more than 25 years.
A friend of Williams, Jeremy
Garrett, testified that Williams ad
mitted to the murders. His testimony
is ignored because of a belief that he
was offered a sentence reduction by
the prosecution. This is. in fact, not
true. Garrett may have hoped that
his cooperation would help him out,
but no official agreement with the

prosecution existed.
Even if such an agreement had
existed, that would not automatical
ly mean that Garrett's testimony was
false. There is no evidence that the
prosecution attempted to shape the
testimony of any witnesses. Addi
tionally, Williams' attorney was
given the opportunity to question all
witnesses about their criminal histo
ries and any agreements to which
they were party.
in terms of physical evidence, a
gun registered to Stanley Williams
was matched to the bullets at one of
the murder scenes and found to be
consistent with the gun used at the
other murder scene.
Williams' trial and conviction
have been upheld more than once by
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
a court recognized by legal scholars
as the most liberal of the appeals
courts. He refuses to admit his guilt
and refuses to debrief with prison of
ficials. a process that would offer in
sight into the workings of street
gangs and the means of communica
tion between gang members in
prison and those still on the streets. If
Williams is so intent on stopping
gang violence, why has he not helped
law enforcement understand more
about how gangs work?
I respect the right of those op
posed to the death penalty to protest
executions, but I take exception to
the idea that an innocent man — or
even a rehabilitated man — is about
to be executed.The first step in reha
bilitation is admitting there is a prob
lem, and Williams has failed to do so.
