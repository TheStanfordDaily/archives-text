# Bah, Humbug

### 
In an astounding feat of generosity the Universi
ty has decided to give all off-campus graduate
students a Christmas present: freedom.
Freedom, that is. to travel by car. Yes, no longer
will we be forced to journey to work using Caltrain.
Instead, by taking away our free passes, Stanford
has ensured that we will be able to pour carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere while driving to work
without the slightest hint of guilt.
In fact, to complement the $1500 we're losing, we
also get the opportunity to give up the Clean Air
cash (around $200) given out by Parking and Trans
portation to those members of the University who
take the opportunity to commute to campus with
out using a car. Ah, the gifts just keep piling on.
The worst thing about this debacle is that, ulti
mately, my anger is futile. Not only because noth
ing will change (though I still hold out some hope),
but rather because there's no one to be justifiably
angry at.
At first you might think to blame the Graduate
Student Council. After all, they managed to get us
the GO pass in the first place, so why the hell could
n't they hang on to it?
That point of view, however, is a little unfair.
While completely unable to organize a social
event that wouldn't fit in better with a kinder
garten crowd, when it comes to more practical
things the GSC (as much as I'm loath to admit it)
does a good job.
I don't think it's reasonable to expect anything
more than effort from our esteemed student repre
sentatives, and when it comes to effort they seem to
have surpassed themselves with this Caltrain busi
ness.
In fact, if you take a closer look at the Universi
ty's motivation for giving graduate students GO
passes, it appears almost a miracle that we got them
in the first place. This motivation is the same as the
one for giving passes to staff and faculty: the Gener
al Use Permit.
This fascinating 42 page document is an agree
ment Stanford made with Santa Clara County in
order to expand (adding 2 million square feet) over
the next decade. Among the various clauses is one
that says no new peak hour trips should be generat
ed by the expansion.
According to the extraordinarily helpful director
of Parking and Transportation. Brodie Hamilton,
should Stanford fail to do this, the University will
have to contribute many millions of dollars to vari
ous road improvement projects. This, understand

ably, is viewed as a bad thing, and hence we have the
GO pass program.
Of course, such a program only really does any
good if the people using it would have traveled by
car during peak hours. For most graduate students
living off campus, that's not the case. They sleep in,
stay late and often live close enough to bike.
So the hundreds of thousands of dollars the pro
gram costs can be put to better use elsewhere, and,
even worse, we can hardly blame the powers that be
for making what appears to be a sensible financial
decision.
Now this sanguinity didn't strike me immediate
ly. As one of the several graduate students that use
Caltrain every day for the peak time commute, 1 was
feeling a little miffed.
I spent a couple of hours quietly fuming and plot
ting a complicated payback plan; though, after a lit
tle reflection, such a plan wouldn't really be fair.
In fact I wouldn't be at all justified in suggesting
that we declare war on Stanford. It would be com
pletely wrong to suggest that if passes are to cost us
$1,500 apiece, we should do our best to cost the Uni
versity millions.
We should definitely not drive repeatedly over
the traffic sensors that are laid out at each of the six
entrances to Campus during peak hours, while the
County's traffic monitoring goes on this spring. No,
that would be totally unethical. Perhaps even crimi
nal. Sigh.
Still, despite all of that, turning over the plan in
my mind has begun to restore the true spirit of
Christmas within me. And, while it's a little wicked,
I have a feeling that constructing ever more elabo
rate plans to engineer the University's downfall is
going to keep me sane, both over the break and
next quarter while I'm stuck in the early morning
traffic...

n't they hang on to it?
That point of view, however, is a little unfair.
While completely unable to organize a social
event that wouldn't fit in better with a kinder
garten crowd, when it comes to more practical
things the GSC (as much as I'm loath to admit it)
does a good job.
I don't think it's reasonable to expect anything
more than effort from our esteemed student repre
sentatives, and when it comes to effort they seem to
have surpassed themselves with this Caltrain busi
ness.
In fact, if you take a closer look at the Universi
ty's motivation for giving graduate students GO
passes, it appears almost a miracle that we got them
in the first place. This motivation is the same as the
one for giving passes to staff and faculty: the Gener
al Use Permit.
This fascinating 42 page document is an agree
ment Stanford made with Santa Clara County in
order to expand (adding 2 million square feet) over
the next decade. Among the various clauses is one
that says no new peak hour trips should be generat
ed by the expansion.
According to the extraordinarily helpful director
of Parking and Transportation. Brodie Hamilton,
should Stanford fail to do this, the University will
have to contribute many millions of dollars to vari
ous road improvement projects. This, understand

ably, is viewed as a bad thing, and hence we have the
GO pass program.
Of course, such a program only really does any
good if the people using it would have traveled by
car during peak hours. For most graduate students
living off campus, that's not the case. They sleep in,
stay late and often live close enough to bike.
So the hundreds of thousands of dollars the pro
gram costs can be put to better use elsewhere, and,
even worse, we can hardly blame the powers that be
for making what appears to be a sensible financial
decision.
Now this sanguinity didn't strike me immediate
ly. As one of the several graduate students that use
Caltrain every day for the peak time commute, 1 was
feeling a little miffed.
I spent a couple of hours quietly fuming and plot
ting a complicated payback plan; though, after a lit
tle reflection, such a plan wouldn't really be fair.
In fact I wouldn't be at all justified in suggesting
that we declare war on Stanford. It would be com
pletely wrong to suggest that if passes are to cost us
$1,500 apiece, we should do our best to cost the Uni
versity millions.
We should definitely not drive repeatedly over
the traffic sensors that are laid out at each of the six
entrances to Campus during peak hours, while the
County's traffic monitoring goes on this spring. No,
that would be totally unethical. Perhaps even crimi
nal. Sigh.
Still, despite all of that, turning over the plan in
my mind has begun to restore the true spirit of
Christmas within me. And, while it's a little wicked,
I have a feeling that constructing ever more elabo
rate plans to engineer the University's downfall is
going to keep me sane, both over the break and
next quarter while I'm stuck in the early morning
traffic...

In an astounding feat of generosity the Universi
ty has decided to give all off-campus graduate
students a Christmas present: freedom.
Freedom, that is. to travel by car. Yes, no longer
will we be forced to journey to work using Caltrain.
Instead, by taking away our free passes, Stanford
has ensured that we will be able to pour carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere while driving to work
without the slightest hint of guilt.
In fact, to complement the $1500 we're losing, we
also get the opportunity to give up the Clean Air
cash (around $200) given out by Parking and Trans
portation to those members of the University who
take the opportunity to commute to campus with
out using a car. Ah, the gifts just keep piling on.
The worst thing about this debacle is that, ulti
mately, my anger is futile. Not only because noth
ing will change (though I still hold out some hope),
but rather because there's no one to be justifiably
angry at.
At first you might think to blame the Graduate
Student Council. After all, they managed to get us
the GO pass in the first place, so why the hell could
n't they hang on to it?
That point of view, however, is a little unfair.
