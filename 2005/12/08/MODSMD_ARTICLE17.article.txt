## SOCC supports union cause 
### AHMED ASHRAF 
As students, it can be easy to forget that we are
not the only ones who make up the Stanford
campus. Other members of our Stanford
community play a vital role in the functioning of the
University but do not necessarily participate in its
triumphs as an academic institution. These people
cook, serve and clean up after us, keep our routines
stress-free and undertake a variety of difficult tasks
that are as essential to University function as our
own participation. This is why SOCC, the Students
of Color Coalition, believes that the union workers'
struggle for better pay and benefits is as much our
problem as it is that of the workers.
A decision to strike, if taken, is not one taken light
ly by Stanford Hospital workers and University work
ers. Union members consider it a last resort to be used
only if the University continues to place profitability
over the basic rights of people, as the University has
done in the past. As students, we need to be mindful
that if a strike occurs, it does not signify that Universi
ty employees are attacking our education or the stu
dent body. Instead, we must recognize their struggle
for basic rights as one that deserves our solidarity.
If a strike does occur, it reflects that the University
has refused to recognize its exploitation of its commu
nity members and that all available channels have
been exhausted. SOCC therefore calls on the Univer
sity to take the necessary steps to secure a mutually ac
ceptable agreement.
SOCC believes that workers deserve their funda
mental right to health and safety. Medical insurance

costs continue to multiply, and it's often lower-income
union workers that are left most vulnerable to the dev
astating consequences. The resources for intervention
exist: over the past five years, the Stanford endowment
has achieved an annualized growth of 7.9 percent.The
question is whether the University believes workers
deserve the rights they are requesting.
As an organization dedicated to fighting for pro
gressive social change and empowerment in our com
munities of color, SOCC remains committed to work
ers' rights. We recognize that workers' struggles are in
tricately tied to issues of concern for people of color.
We believe that equality and opportunity are not just
for Stanford students but are for the wider communi
ty that makes all our endeavors possible.
Union members have shown their loyalty and be
lief in this University through years of hard work and
dedication — it's time the University invested back in
their futures and livelihoods. Stanford's endowment
uniquely enables it to take bold, progressive steps that
raise the quality of life for all its dependents, students
and staff alike. SOCC envisions social justice on cam
pus as part of a larger momentum for social improve
ment in our society. We believe that the actions of Stan
ford University arc felt across the country and set a
powerful precedent for the respect of workers' rights.
