# SPECIAL EVENT
## Gore warns about global warming 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The polar ice caps will melt. Warmer water
temperatures mean hurricanes will be more in
tense and last longer, causing ever greater proper
ty damage. Heat records will continue to be bro
ken with each passing summer. Droughts, famines
and flooding will be the worst in millennia. Win
ters will shorten. Greenland will melt. The glob
al sea level would then rise 20 feet and large
swaths of the world's land would flood, including
Manhattan and large parts of Western Europe.
These nightmare scenarios, among others,
were outlined by former Vice President A1 Gore
in a speech TUesday night to a packed Memorial
Auditorium crowd. For more than an hour-and-a
half. Gore passionately made the case that global
warming is already exacting dangerous conse
quences on the planet and warned of catastroph
ic outcomes on earth in the decades to come if
nothing is done.
Acknowledging that not all of the above sce
narios may pan out and that a multitude of factors
could be at play, Gore nonetheless pushed the
case that global warming must be dealt with now
and highlighted what he said is a
changing relationship between hu
mans and the earth.
"Terrorism is a serious problem,
but we also ought to be worried
about other threats facing our socie
ty," he said, explaining that the world
is playing its own game of Russian
roulette by allowing the risk of cata
strophic climate change without tak
ing strong action.
Business as usual should not be
an option. Gore told the audience.
The former congressman who ini
tially built a national following in the
1980s and early 1990s by focusing on
environmental issues juxtaposed pic
tures of mountains and glaciers taken
decades ago with pictures from today.
"It is relentless, continuing and
accelerating," Gore said of carbon
dioxide releases, which he said will
lead to an even greater spike in glob
al temperatures in years to come.
He said he has no doubt that global
warming is real and mast be addressed.
"The misconception about
[whether] the science is an illusion is
deliberately created by those who
oppose government action," he said.
Invoking Winston Churchill's

warning to the British people about
appeasing Nazi Germany, Gore drew
parallels to what he termed a gather
ing storm. Gore called the years to
come, like those surrounding World
War TWo, "periods of consequence."
Gore singled out both U.S. State
Department Senior Climate Nego
tiator Harlan Watson and U.S. Am
bassador to the United Nations John
Bolton as politicians who he said
have tried to hide the truth about
global warming from the American
people by suppressing the release of
important reports.
He commended a collaboration of
Silicon Valley businesses that has suc
cessfully reduced its carbon dioxide
emissions over the past four years.
"This is not a political issue,"
Gore said."lt's a moral one...glaciers
really don't care about politics or
ideology. They just freeze or melt."
Gore also chided the United
States for failing to ratify the Kyoto
Protocol he helped spearhead as
Vice President.
"There are a lot of people who go
from denial to desperation without
the intermediate step of solving the
problem," he said. "It's actually
shockingly easy to reduce your CO2
emissions to zero and use offsets for
the remainder. We're capable of
doing big things."
Accompanied by his wife Tipper,
Gore received two standing ovations

for his second speech in less than a
month at Memorial Auditorium. In
November, Gore had a similar mes
sage for business school students
about the environment.
In the audience were the direc
tors of the National Wildlife Fund,
Natural Resource Defense Council,
the Sierra Club, Environmental De
fense Fund and World Resources In
stitute. Gore said that plans are still
tentatively and privately being dis
cussed fora partnership of these and
other organizations that could be
based in Palo Alto and specifically
be charged to raise awareness on cli
mate change issues.
Students, who entered a lottery
weeks ago for tickets, reacted posi
tively after the event.
Kimberly Heiman,a Ph.D. candi
date in Marine Biology, drove with
10 classmates from the Hopkins Ma
rine Station in Monterrey just to see
Gore's speech.
"There are many, many crises that
this planet is facing and some seem
far more dramatic than others," she
said, heaping praise on the scientific
evidence Gore used in his speech.
Junior Charlotte Helvestine said
that Gore was mostly preaching to
the choir in his speech. She said that
she wished people who did not be
lieve that global warming posed a
global threat could have heard
Gore's remarks.
