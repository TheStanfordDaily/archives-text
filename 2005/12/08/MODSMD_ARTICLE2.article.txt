## Gore warns about global warming 
### JAMES HOHMANN DESK EDITOR 
The polar ice caps will melt. Warmer water
temperatures mean hurricanes will be more in
tense and last longer, causing ever greater proper
ty damage. Heat records will continue to be bro
ken with each passing summer. Droughts, famines
and flooding will be the worst in millennia. Win
ters will shorten. Greenland will melt. The glob
al sea level would then rise 20 feet and large
swaths of the world's land would flood, including
Manhattan and large parts of Western Europe.
These nightmare scenarios, among others,
were outlined by former Vice President A1 Gore
in a speech TUesday night to a packed Memorial
Auditorium crowd. For more than an hour-and-a
half. Gore passionately made the case that global
warming is already exacting dangerous conse
quences on the planet and warned of catastroph
ic outcomes on earth in the decades to come if
nothing is done.
Acknowledging that not all of the above sce
narios may pan out and that a multitude of factors
could be at play, Gore nonetheless pushed the
case that global warming must be dealt with now
