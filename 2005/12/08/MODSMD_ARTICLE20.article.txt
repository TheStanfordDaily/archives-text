Yells should improve, not disappear
I found the back-to-back columns in The
Daily calling for the disbandment of the yell
leaders disappointing, not because the articles
were off base in their criticisms, but because I
believe that the role of the yells is critical to our
school spirit and our teams' success.
Obviously the organization is in desperate
need of reform; it was simply excruciating to
hear the yell leaders start chants while Stan
ford quarterbacks attempted to call audibles
and during injury timeouts as the entire stu
dent section implored them Jo stop. It is unac
ceptable that the fans should be better in
formed about when it is appropriate to cheer
than the school-sponsored, microphone
wielding yell leaders.
But the yell leaders are the natural com
plement to the Band and the Dollies, and with
the right improvements, they have the poten
tial to greatly enhance our home-field advan
tage. Every student section can benefit from
some direction, and the yell leaders should
serve this function. But first they must face the
criticism and improve in order to avoid fur
ther embarrassing themselves, their peers and
our University.
Making the yell leaders disappear would be
the easy solution, but demanding better of
them and insisting that they earn our respect
would, in the end, be best for our school.

Yell leaders widely detested
On the columns about yell leaders: Given
the choice between root canal and listening to
Stanford's yell leaders, I'm heading to the den
tist.To sense how widely this sentiment is held,
visit The Bootleg. Some of the opinion borders
on the felonious.
The yell leaders are not supporting Stan
ford sports; they are parodying them. Yes, par
ody can be entertaining, but the yell leaders
never are.
Losing football seasons hurt Stanford's
reputation; the yell leaders hurt it even more.

GO Pass is necessary
The impending cancellation of the GO
Pass ("Big Railroad Blues?" Nov. 30) is a mat
ter of enormous concern to the Stanford Envi
ronmental Law Society and to law students in
general. We are deeply concerned that Parking
and Transportation Services appears to be
considering shutting down the program with

out inviting students to participate in discus
sions on the right way forward. Here's why
shutting down GO Pass is a bad idea:
It puts financial pressures on those least
able to bear it. Many of us plan to go into pub
lic interest law after graduation and need to
keep our debt burdens low. CalTrain tickets
— at $ 10 for every trip into the city — rapidly
become prohibitively expensive.TTie GO Pass
is our only way to connect to the vibrant life of
the city and, even more importantly, to jobs
and externships throughout the Bay Area. A
significant number of us moved to the city
largely because of the availability of the pass
and will be forced to radically alter our budg
ets and schedules to compensate for losing it.
It will hurt community life. Stanford
should not and does not produce lawyers with
parochial world views. The law school needs to
be tied to the larger community to keep our
thinking connected to the larger realities of
urban life.
Finally, the GO Pass relieves pressure on
the environment.
We understand that financial realities may
mean that the program has to be somewhat re
configured. We do not, however, accept that
simply abandoning the program after only one
year?s trial is appropriate. Student voices have
not been heard on this issue; they need to be.

Ignore vegetarian criticism
Navin Sivanandam has been attacked re
cently on the pages of this esteemed newspa
per for his criticism of vegetarianism. As
Sivanandam's office-mate, I am used to rou
tinely ignoring his characteristic egotistical
philosophizing, and I strongly urge other cor
respondents to do the same.

Basketball doesn't look ready
If anyone is surprised by our basketball
team's recent troubles (losses to Montana,
UC-Irvine and UC-Davis) they shouldn't be.
Those who saw the exhibition games should
have realized that when a team can't play de
fense against powerhouse Sonoma State, they
can't play defense against any Division-I team.
Our team will have the amazing opportunity
to lose to four UC schools this year. It makes
me wonder about Coach J — his team was
picked to compete for the Pacific-10 title, yet
know thev will be luckv to make the NCAA

Tournament. Maybe Lexus should move the
Gauntlet to Stanford-Davis —it might be
more competitive.

Sexual assault resources
We would like to thank Christian Tom and
The Daily for raising awareness about the
fact that sexual assault is often underreport
ed. We are writing to clarify the resources
available at Stanford.
We would like to remind all members of the
Stanford community — faculty staff, students
and affiliates — that if you or someone you
know has experienced a sexual assault you
may contact the YWCA Sexual Assault Cen
ter@Stanford. They have a 24-hour hotline at
(650) 725-9955 and offer drop-in office hours,
Monday and Wednesday. 2-4 p.m., and Tues
day and Thursday, 3-5 p.m., at Vaden Health
Center. All of their services are completely
confidential.
Anyone wishing to report a crime to the
Stanford Department of Public Safety can call
9-911 .The police can assist a survivor in under
standing his or her options, obtaining a rape
collection examination or gaining a restraining
order.
Whether or not the police are contacted,
anyone interested in reporting a sexual assault
as a violation of the Fundamental Standard
may contact Judicial Affairs to learn more
about the process. Talking to the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs does not obligate a person to file
a complaint, and an investigation will not
begin until an official complaint is filed. Infor
mation about victims' rights may be found on
their Web site
(http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judi
cialaffairs/judicialprocess/victimsrights.htm).
In addition, students who feel unsafe in
their current living environment can receive
assistance from a Residence Dean or the
Graduate Life Office.
We encourage every survivor of a sexual as
sault to access the confidential resources avail
able for his or her own physical and emotional
well-being. We hope to empower anyone who
chooses to report the crime to do so and to
know that his or her rights and choices will be
respected during the whole process. Everyone,
regardless of gender or sexual orientation de
serves to be safe and respected and to have the
opportunity to receive support and justice.
