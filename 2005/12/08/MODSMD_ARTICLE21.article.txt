# In which our hero's plans are thwarted by mono
## 
### 
Remember when being sick used to be
fun? When it meant staying home
from school and having your parents
take care of you? You'd sleep until 11 a.m. be
cause there was nothing on TV until "The
Price is Right." Then at noon you could de
mand fast food or ice cream, and come 2 p.m.
you could start to feel better and commence
playing video games.
Being sick at college is not nearly as much
fun. Sicknesses aren't the compact 24-hour
bugs of old. but long, drawn-out affairs that
never seem to improve because you spend
four nights a week diverting your body's at
tention toward metabolizing ethanol instead
of fighting the disease. You spend weeks half
awake, dizzy with a light tickle in your throat,
wondering if you'll ever feel alive again.
When your body finally gives up on you and
decides that you are not leaving your bed, it's
inevitably on one of the days of the week
when you have a small section that you
shouldn't skip.
Missing class to spend a day temporarily
dead doesn't mean a reprieve from home
work; it just takes away from time you could
be working on it. Staying home doesn't hold
the same charm it did when you were young
and knew how wonderful being alone in your
house in the middle of the day would be. In
college, you can do that any day of the week
by skipping physics lecture.
Your parents had a vaguely defined num
ber in their heads of how many days you had
to be sick before they'd take you to the doctor
(in my case, this was 10). If I followed this rule
today, I'd be going to Vaden every 10 days,and
they'd start to look at me strangely.
It's cliche to beat up on Vaden, but I've
been sick fora month so I'm going to take the
easy way out. It's widely known that Vaden is
humorously incompetent, to the point where
many people try as hard as possible to avoid
going there.
Two of the most popular methods of alter
native medical care entail students trying to
pretend they're still in elementary school —
either by relying on the nonexistent medical

expertise of their parents or by waiting until a
trip home to see your former pediatrician
who still gives you safety pops at the end of
your visits.
The first method is to call your parents and
get a diagnosis based on a list of symptoms.
The diagnosis is usually some combination of
physical exhaustion, the flu and typhoid. I've
even gone so far as to e-mail my parents a
blurry cameraphone photo of a burn on my
hand to ask them if they thought 1 needed
medical attention. Why we continue to have
infinite faith in our parents' medically un
sound advice is beyond me. 1 get to pretend
that my father has some medical knowledge
because he was an untrained medic in the Air
Force.
None of this applies to the 30 percent of
Stanford students whose parents are doctors,
mostly plastic surgeons. These lucky kids get
to call their parents and, through the limitless
power of whining, force them to remember
knowledge they haven't been quizzed on
since second-year med school. Their parents
will usually just call in a prescription for an
tibiotics to a local pharmacy' to shut them up.
and then return to their loveless marriage —
as depicted in"The Secret Lives of Dentists."
The other option is to wait until a major
holiday break and see your competent and
friendly general practitioner back home. The
conversation usually goes something like this:
"Dr. Kugelmass, I don't feel well."
"Tell me, vut are ze symptoms?" (My GP is
very Russian.)
"General fatigue, muscle soreness, some-

times I get really dizzy."
"How many hours of sleep you
get?"
"Six? Maybe?"
"And are you eating good ?"
"I usually skip lunch and have a
burger and fries for dinner."
"So vut you are saying is you don't
take care of body and you don't feel
well? Da?"
"I guess."
"Take a multivitamin."
If you do not have MDs for par
ents and it's not close to a school
break, then you really only have one
option left...
"Hello, this is Vaden. How may we
humiliate you?"
"Hi. I'm having abdominal cramps
and would like to make an appoint
ment."
"I've got a few openings early next
week."
"I'm an athlete."
"Marvelous! Come in any time
today."
Vaden employs dozens of nurses
who get to pretend to be doctors.
They have the privilege of telling you
that you have strep throat or mono.
This diagnosis is confirmed when
they send you the results of your uri
nalysis— which is always odd, be
cause as far as vou can remember.

they only took blood samples. They
will rush into action by putting you on
the strongest antibiotics available to
mankind, resulting in you breaking
out in a full body rash. At which point
they realize that actually,you're preg
nant.
Being diagnosed with mono is one
of the most useless and depressing
pieces of information you're ever
likely to be given. It's like being told
you have the flu. but with no treat
ment options and no chance of get
ting better any time in the foresee
able future. Last year, I made a spe
cial deal with God that if it turned out
1 had strep and not mono, I'd stop
making fun of people with promise
rings. I was therefore conflicted when
Vaden told me I had strep, but not to
worry —10 days later, with no major
change in my condition, they
changed their diagnosis to mono. Un
fortunately, though, with mono you
need to spend the next year worrying
that you're infecting your friends
every time you share food. And no
kissing... forever!
While at Vaden. I encourage you
to visit the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, where members of
various queer-alliance groups pre
tend to be sexologists — and in the
process make straight people feel re
ally really uncomfortable.
Sophomore year, I decided I
should spend my sex dollars before
they expired like a bad condom. That
was a mistake.
"Hey, I'd like to spend my sex dol

lars now," I said
"Oh, what would you like to spend
them on?" (1 felt like a six-year-old
being given a dollar to buy candy at
the corner drug store — a compari
son that would become unpleasantly
true soon enough.)
"Can 1 just have my 12 condoms'?"
"Would you like any lubricant?"
"No." I'd had a bad experience
with lubricant freshman year, when
my ME 101 group had tried to use it to
salvage our final project.
"Are you sure? We have a pam
phlet about it. It's not just for gay sex
anymore."
"No, no, just the 12 condoms."
"OK then, what type would you
like? Ribbed for her pleasure? For
your pleasure? Cinnamon flavored?
We just got in a shipment of German
condoms, they're very popular. Ooh,
these are strawberry."
"Umm, look, could you just put
some condoms in the bag. this is real
ly uncomfortable."
This exchange was only slightly
more awkward than the most recent
time 1 visited Vaden and the nurse
asked me if 1 was sexually active.
"I wish," 1 replied.
"Is that a yes or a no?" she asked.
1 hate Vaden.

you could start to feel better and commence

Being sick at college is not nearly as much
fun. Sicknesses aren't the compact 24-hour
bugs of old. but long, drawn-out affairs that
never seem to improve because you spend
four nights a week diverting your body's at
tention toward metabolizing ethanol instead
of fighting the disease. You spend weeks half
awake, dizzy with a light tickle in your throat,
wondering if you'll ever feel alive again.
When your body finally gives up on you and
decides that you are not leaving your bed, it's
inevitably on one of the days of the week
when you have a small section that you
shouldn't skip.
Missing class to spend a day temporarily
dead doesn't mean a reprieve from home
work; it just takes away from time you could
be working on it. Staying home doesn't hold
the same charm it did when you were young
and knew how wonderful being alone in your
house in the middle of the day would be. In
college, you can do that any day of the week
by skipping physics lecture.
Your parents had a vaguely defined num
ber in their heads of how many days you had
to be sick before they'd take you to the doctor
(in my case, this was 10). If I followed this rule
today, I'd be going to Vaden every 10 days,and
they'd start to look at me strangely.
It's cliche to beat up on Vaden, but I've
been sick fora month so I'm going to take the
easy way out. It's widely known that Vaden is
humorously incompetent, to the point where
many people try as hard as possible to avoid
going there.
Two of the most popular methods of alter
native medical care entail students trying to
pretend they're still in elementary school —
either by relying on the nonexistent medical

expertise of their parents or by waiting until a
trip home to see your former pediatrician
who still gives you safety pops at the end of
your visits.
The first method is to call your parents and
get a diagnosis based on a list of symptoms.
The diagnosis is usually some combination of
physical exhaustion, the flu and typhoid. I've
even gone so far as to e-mail my parents a
blurry cameraphone photo of a burn on my
hand to ask them if they thought 1 needed
medical attention. Why we continue to have
infinite faith in our parents' medically un
sound advice is beyond me. 1 get to pretend
that my father has some medical knowledge
because he was an untrained medic in the Air
Force.
None of this applies to the 30 percent of
Stanford students whose parents are doctors,
mostly plastic surgeons. These lucky kids get
to call their parents and, through the limitless
power of whining, force them to remember
knowledge they haven't been quizzed on
since second-year med school. Their parents
will usually just call in a prescription for an
tibiotics to a local pharmacy' to shut them up.
and then return to their loveless marriage —
as depicted in"The Secret Lives of Dentists."
The other option is to wait until a major
holiday break and see your competent and
friendly general practitioner back home. The
conversation usually goes something like this:
"Dr. Kugelmass, I don't feel well."
"Tell me, vut are ze symptoms?" (My GP is
very Russian.)
"General fatigue, muscle soreness, some-

times I get really dizzy."
"How many hours of sleep you
get?"
"Six? Maybe?"
"And are you eating good ?"
"I usually skip lunch and have a
burger and fries for dinner."
"So vut you are saying is you don't
take care of body and you don't feel
well? Da?"
"I guess."
"Take a multivitamin."
If you do not have MDs for par
ents and it's not close to a school
break, then you really only have one
option left...
"Hello, this is Vaden. How may we
humiliate you?"
"Hi. I'm having abdominal cramps
and would like to make an appoint
ment."
"I've got a few openings early next
week."
"I'm an athlete."
"Marvelous! Come in any time
today."
Vaden employs dozens of nurses
who get to pretend to be doctors.
They have the privilege of telling you
that you have strep throat or mono.
This diagnosis is confirmed when
they send you the results of your uri
nalysis— which is always odd, be
cause as far as vou can remember.

they only took blood samples. They
will rush into action by putting you on
the strongest antibiotics available to
mankind, resulting in you breaking
out in a full body rash. At which point
they realize that actually,you're preg
nant.
Being diagnosed with mono is one
of the most useless and depressing
pieces of information you're ever
likely to be given. It's like being told
you have the flu. but with no treat
ment options and no chance of get
ting better any time in the foresee
able future. Last year, I made a spe
cial deal with God that if it turned out
1 had strep and not mono, I'd stop
making fun of people with promise
rings. I was therefore conflicted when
Vaden told me I had strep, but not to
worry —10 days later, with no major
change in my condition, they
changed their diagnosis to mono. Un
fortunately, though, with mono you
need to spend the next year worrying
that you're infecting your friends
every time you share food. And no
kissing... forever!

to visit the Sexual Health Peer Re

various queer-alliance groups pre

Sophomore year, I decided I
should spend my sex dollars before
they expired like a bad condom. That
was a mistake.
"Hey, I'd like to spend my sex dol

lars now," I said
"Oh, what would you like to spend
them on?" (1 felt like a six-year-old
being given a dollar to buy candy at
the corner drug store — a compari
son that would become unpleasantly
true soon enough.)
"Can 1 just have my 12 condoms'?"
"Would you like any lubricant?"
"No." I'd had a bad experience
with lubricant freshman year, when
my ME 101 group had tried to use it to
salvage our final project.
"Are you sure? We have a pam
phlet about it. It's not just for gay sex
anymore."
"No, no, just the 12 condoms."
"OK then, what type would you
like? Ribbed for her pleasure? For
your pleasure? Cinnamon flavored?
We just got in a shipment of German
condoms, they're very popular. Ooh,
these are strawberry."
"Umm, look, could you just put
some condoms in the bag. this is real
ly uncomfortable."
This exchange was only slightly
more awkward than the most recent
time 1 visited Vaden and the nurse
asked me if 1 was sexually active.
"I wish," 1 replied.
"Is that a yes or a no?" she asked.
1 hate Vaden.

never seem to improve because you spend
four nights a week diverting your body's at
tention toward metabolizing ethanol instead
of fighting the disease. You spend weeks half
awake, dizzy with a light tickle in your throat,
wondering if you'll ever feel alive again.
When your body finally gives up on you and
decides that you are not leaving your bed, it's
inevitably on one of the days of the week
when you have a small section that you
shouldn't skip.
Missing class to spend a day temporarily
dead doesn't mean a reprieve from home
work; it just takes away from time you could
be working on it. Staying home doesn't hold
the same charm it did when you were young
and knew how wonderful being alone in your
house in the middle of the day would be. In
college, you can do that any day of the week
by skipping physics lecture.
Your parents had a vaguely defined num
ber in their heads of how many days you had
to be sick before they'd take you to the doctor
(in my case, this was 10). If I followed this rule
today, I'd be going to Vaden every 10 days,and
they'd start to look at me strangely.
It's cliche to beat up on Vaden, but I've
been sick fora month so I'm going to take the
easy way out. It's widely known that Vaden is
humorously incompetent, to the point where
many people try as hard as possible to avoid
going there.
Two of the most popular methods of alter
native medical care entail students trying to
pretend they're still in elementary school —
either by relying on the nonexistent medical

expertise of their parents or by waiting until a
trip home to see your former pediatrician
who still gives you safety pops at the end of
your visits.
The first method is to call your parents and
get a diagnosis based on a list of symptoms.
The diagnosis is usually some combination of
physical exhaustion, the flu and typhoid. I've
even gone so far as to e-mail my parents a
blurry cameraphone photo of a burn on my
hand to ask them if they thought 1 needed
medical attention. Why we continue to have
infinite faith in our parents' medically un
sound advice is beyond me. 1 get to pretend
that my father has some medical knowledge
because he was an untrained medic in the Air
Force.
None of this applies to the 30 percent of
Stanford students whose parents are doctors,
mostly plastic surgeons. These lucky kids get
to call their parents and, through the limitless
power of whining, force them to remember
knowledge they haven't been quizzed on
since second-year med school. Their parents
will usually just call in a prescription for an
tibiotics to a local pharmacy' to shut them up.
and then return to their loveless marriage —
as depicted in"The Secret Lives of Dentists."
The other option is to wait until a major
holiday break and see your competent and
friendly general practitioner back home. The
conversation usually goes something like this:
"Dr. Kugelmass, I don't feel well."
"Tell me, vut are ze symptoms?" (My GP is
very Russian.)
"General fatigue, muscle soreness, some-

times I get really dizzy."
"How many hours of sleep you
get?"
"Six? Maybe?"
"And are you eating good ?"
"I usually skip lunch and have a
burger and fries for dinner."
"So vut you are saying is you don't
take care of body and you don't feel
well? Da?"
"I guess."
"Take a multivitamin."
If you do not have MDs for par
ents and it's not close to a school
break, then you really only have one
option left...
"Hello, this is Vaden. How may we
humiliate you?"
"Hi. I'm having abdominal cramps
and would like to make an appoint
ment."
"I've got a few openings early next
week."
"I'm an athlete."
"Marvelous! Come in any time
today."
Vaden employs dozens of nurses
who get to pretend to be doctors.
They have the privilege of telling you
that you have strep throat or mono.
This diagnosis is confirmed when
they send you the results of your uri
nalysis— which is always odd, be
cause as far as vou can remember.

they only took blood samples. They
will rush into action by putting you on
the strongest antibiotics available to
mankind, resulting in you breaking
out in a full body rash. At which point
they realize that actually,you're preg
nant.
Being diagnosed with mono is one
of the most useless and depressing
pieces of information you're ever
likely to be given. It's like being told
you have the flu. but with no treat
ment options and no chance of get
ting better any time in the foresee
able future. Last year, I made a spe
cial deal with God that if it turned out
1 had strep and not mono, I'd stop
making fun of people with promise
rings. I was therefore conflicted when
Vaden told me I had strep, but not to
worry —10 days later, with no major
change in my condition, they
changed their diagnosis to mono. Un
fortunately, though, with mono you
need to spend the next year worrying
that you're infecting your friends
every time you share food. And no
kissing... forever!
While at Vaden. I encourage you
to visit the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, where members of
various queer-alliance groups pre
tend to be sexologists — and in the
process make straight people feel re
ally really uncomfortable.
Sophomore year, I decided I
should spend my sex dollars before
they expired like a bad condom. That
was a mistake.
"Hey, I'd like to spend my sex dol

lars now," I said
"Oh, what would you like to spend
them on?" (1 felt like a six-year-old
being given a dollar to buy candy at
the corner drug store — a compari
son that would become unpleasantly
true soon enough.)
"Can 1 just have my 12 condoms'?"
"Would you like any lubricant?"
"No." I'd had a bad experience
with lubricant freshman year, when
my ME 101 group had tried to use it to
salvage our final project.
"Are you sure? We have a pam
phlet about it. It's not just for gay sex
anymore."
"No, no, just the 12 condoms."
"OK then, what type would you
like? Ribbed for her pleasure? For
your pleasure? Cinnamon flavored?
We just got in a shipment of German
condoms, they're very popular. Ooh,
these are strawberry."
"Umm, look, could you just put
some condoms in the bag. this is real
ly uncomfortable."
This exchange was only slightly
more awkward than the most recent
time 1 visited Vaden and the nurse
asked me if 1 was sexually active.
"I wish," 1 replied.
"Is that a yes or a no?" she asked.
1 hate Vaden.
