Remember when being sick used to be
fun? When it meant staying home
from school and having your parents
take care of you? You'd sleep until 11 a.m. be
cause there was nothing on TV until "The
Price is Right." Then at noon you could de
mand fast food or ice cream, and come 2 p.m.
you could start to feel better and commence
playing video games.
Being sick at college is not nearly as much
fun. Sicknesses aren't the compact 24-hour
bugs of old. but long, drawn-out affairs that
never seem to improve because you spend
four nights a week diverting your body's at
tention toward metabolizing ethanol instead
of fighting the disease. You spend weeks half
awake, dizzy with a light tickle in your throat,
wondering if you'll ever feel alive again.
When your body finally gives up on you and
decides that you are not leaving your bed, it's
inevitably on one of the days of the week
when you have a small section that you
shouldn't skip.
Missing class to spend a day temporarily
dead doesn't mean a reprieve from home
work; it just takes away from time you could
be working on it. Staying home doesn't hold
the same charm it did when you were young
and knew how wonderful being alone in your
house in the middle of the day would be. In
college, you can do that any day of the week
by skipping physics lecture.
Your parents had a vaguely defined num
ber in their heads of how many days you had
to be sick before they'd take you to the doctor
(in my case, this was 10). If I followed this rule
today, I'd be going to Vaden every 10 days,and
they'd start to look at me strangely.
It's cliche to beat up on Vaden, but I've
been sick fora month so I'm going to take the
easy way out. It's widely known that Vaden is
humorously incompetent, to the point where
many people try as hard as possible to avoid
going there.
Two of the most popular methods of alter
native medical care entail students trying to
pretend they're still in elementary school —
either by relying on the nonexistent medical

expertise of their parents or by waiting until a
trip home to see your former pediatrician
who still gives you safety pops at the end of
your visits.
The first method is to call your parents and
get a diagnosis based on a list of symptoms.
The diagnosis is usually some combination of
physical exhaustion, the flu and typhoid. I've
even gone so far as to e-mail my parents a
blurry cameraphone photo of a burn on my
hand to ask them if they thought 1 needed
medical attention. Why we continue to have
infinite faith in our parents' medically un
sound advice is beyond me. 1 get to pretend
that my father has some medical knowledge
because he was an untrained medic in the Air
Force.
None of this applies to the 30 percent of
Stanford students whose parents are doctors,
mostly plastic surgeons. These lucky kids get
to call their parents and, through the limitless
power of whining, force them to remember
knowledge they haven't been quizzed on
since second-year med school. Their parents
will usually just call in a prescription for an
tibiotics to a local pharmacy' to shut them up.
and then return to their loveless marriage —
as depicted in"The Secret Lives of Dentists."
The other option is to wait until a major
holiday break and see your competent and
friendly general practitioner back home. The
conversation usually goes something like this:
"Dr. Kugelmass, I don't feel well."
"Tell me, vut are ze symptoms?" (My GP is
very Russian.)
"General fatigue, muscle soreness, some-
