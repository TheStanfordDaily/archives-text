# Ten reasons why studying for finals is worth it
## 
### 
So it's Thursday of Dead Week, and we
think it's fairly safe to guess that 94 per
cent of you have been studying your lit
tle brains out over the last few days (and as
for the other 6 percent... well, all your friends
and your two favorite columnists pretty
much hate you right now).
Near the end of a monstrously painful all
nighter, somewhere between your sixth and
seventh Starbucks Double Shot — at around
the point where if you're a techie, you start
adding instead of multiplying and if you're a
fuzzy, "ambiguity" and "juxtaposition" stop
looking like words and start looking like a
bunch of dots crawling across your page —
comes the inevitable deep, dark, scary
thought: Oh man, how much easier would
my life be if 1 had gone to Joe State School?
Don't even think that. You go to the best
school in the country. At least, we certainly
think you do. But here are some facts... make
your own decision.
• At Michigan, non-athletes are referred
to as "nons" or "NAs" and are separated
from athletes by invisible force fields and
"invisifence" dog collars. We picture it being
kind of like the Sharks versus the Jets in
good old "West Side Story" — except that
everyone is played by cold, miserable under
grads in snowsuits.
• At Arizona, non-athletes are referred to
by the sporty crowd as "Normies" or "Ran
doms." Normies don't go to athlete parties
and athletes aren't welcome at frat parties.
Aren't welcome at frat parties?! Can you
picture a frat party around here with no ath

letes? *tumbleweeds roll through...*
• Remember your freshman dorm? Re
member the football player down the hall,
the gymnast upstairs and the breathtakingly
attractive diver the next hall over? Well, for
non-athletes at most schools this wouldn't
be such a common memory. However, due to
Stanford's policy against housing freshman
athletes together, most students — athlete
or not — are well acquainted with at least a
couple of their classmates on the field, in the
pool or 011 the court from the very beginning.
• As we've said, at Stanford, it's a federal
if two froshies from the same team somehow
wind up living within a mile of each other.
But at most other schools, they're together
from the start. Freshman athletes at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh are placed in Pitt's best
housing — and pretty much feel shafted if
they're not put with someone from the same
team. It's sort of the equivalent of sending all
the athletic freshmen to Wilbur and placing
the rest in a potato sack.
• And once those kids get to sophomore

year, they're off-campus faster than
a... than a... well, really fast. Athletes
at most schools begin a mass migra
tion as soon as possible to the "sport
houses" — off-campus dwellings
handed down from teammate to
teammate, year after year — thus
perpetuating their seclusion from
the rest of the student body.
• We may poke fun at the dumb
jocks, but at least we've got some
standards. At Stanford, you can be
relatively certain that all your class
mates — be they marvels of coordi
nation or absolute motor morons —
made it through high school. Are

cent article in The New York Times
reports that the Auburn, Central
Florida, Colorado State, Florida,
Florida State, Florida International,
Rutgers, South Carolina State, South
Florida, Tennessee and Temple foot
hall teams all feature players who
never really graduated. Instead, they
paid $399 (plus tax) to some ex-con
in Florida fora spiffy (but unaccred
ited) GED from "University High."
Ha. They should have called it "Uni
vershady High." (Kevin would like
to point out that he had absolutely
nothing, whatsoever, to do with that
pun.)
• Last, but certainly not least, if
you had decided to go to any school
other than Stanford, imagine the in
tellectual disadvantage you would
be at by not having immediate access
to a fabulous column such as ours.

(Sorry, but we just couldn't resist an
opportunity for shameless self-pro
motion.)
When you get down to it, yes,
school is hard. And yes, finals week is
going to be no fun at all. But when
you take a look at the craziness that
goes on at other schools, the thought
of being anywhere else is simply
chilling. And wouldn't you rather be
yourself, at school here, than a chilly,
crazy person with no face? (We don't
really know why you wouldn't have a
face, but it's our column, we can say
what we want.) Take care and good
luck on finals.

OK, so we only wrote seven. We tried,
hut 10 is just a really big number. If the
missing three bother you, shoot us
