# Finals relief for just a nickel
## 
### 
During finals week last spring, we took
a road trip to the nickel arcade. With
Dead Week now upon us again, we
delve deep into the coal beds of our pasts,
looking for any distraction from our present
obligations.
Nickel City, Cupertino's notorious nickel
arcade, clings like a gray barnacle to the side
of Highway 85. We had retreated there from
our phony interdisciplinary programs that are
full of students in classes driven by issues of
identity and the collapse of meaning. We
found the arcade such a relief that we consid
ered allowing a Nintendo system to occupy
valuable shelf space alongside "Chez Panisse
Desserts" and Foucault.
So we were in Heaven, pitting our finals
impoverished brains against Ms. Pac-Man,
Dance Dance Revolution and Skeeßall. It
smelled like an eight-year-old boy's dream. It
was a feminist studies nightmare.
We are not normally violent people. But
that changes during finals week. Rather than
taking our violence out on computers and
housemates, we took it out on griffins.
It was probably called something generic,
like "Medieval Attack," or "Quest of the
Sword." It lived on the back wall with all the
other outdated games. Choose your hero —
the Cleric, the Wizard, the Elf or the Dwarf.
Fight your way t0... well, surely there must
have been a goal, but our finals-addled brains
failed to grasp it. We willingly threw ourselves
into a meaningless electronic fray, felling ani
mated foes left and right.
As neophytes to this sort of combat, we
quickly developed a strategy of pressing as

many buttons as possible while spouting ar
cane and mild profanities. "Lordy!"
"Zounds!"" Gosh dammit." Something in the
air made us swear like the boys in "Lord of
the Flies." Certainly we gave in to violence
just as easily as they did. We willingly battled
dragons and undead skeleton monsters, col
lecting coins and jewels and potions.
But even in our moment of animalistic
abandon, while gleefully thrusting our swords
into goblins and calling lightning down from
the sky, we couldn't shake our training.
"You'll note there are no girls in this
game," we remarked in unison. "Surely there
must have been women in the Middle Ages.
And women have historically been excellent
fighters. Especially in the quasi-magical
realm. Why, look at the Amazons and Mae
nads."
And what subtle influence was this game
exerting over our impressionable concepts of
valor and action, we wondered? Thankfully, a
six-headed dragon descended in flames and
gnashing teeth, distracting us from the need
to provide definitive answers to this weighty
question.
Little did we know that after half an hour

of pummeling monsters, we'd be at our fuzzy
philosophizing again, crafting a feminist cri
tique of Ms. Pac-Man: Why is Ms. Pac-Man
just Pac-Man with a bow on the head? Ap
parently. all vestiges of medieval misogyny
had disappeared by the 1970s — given a
chance. Ms. Pac-Man could certainly hold
her own against Pac-Man in gobbling dots
and evading monsters. But she never gave up
her bow. the symbol of her deeply-rooted
feminine power. We've come a long way in
7(H) years.
It would seem that the empowered woman
of the coming generation was the slight, 13-
year-old Asian-American working out on the
DDR machine. She sported a spandex dance
top and racer stripes on her exercise bottoms.
Intensity streamed from her eyes, sweat from
her pores. She seemed completely oblivious
to the gaggle of prepubescent boys ogling her
as she gyrated to remixed Madonna hits. We
looked at each other,equally intimidated and
disgusted by her shocking redefinition of
femininity. When she left Nickel City, her
muscles would be taut and toned.
We, however,left Nickel City with only our
combined total of 12 tickets won at Skeeßall.
The neon rings and rubber monster finger
puppets staring at us from the glass display
case of prizes did not claim our tickets. After
all. we were only 34.988 tickets short of the in
finitely more alluring electric drill. Needless
to say. we'll be going back.

have been a goal, but our finals-addled brains
failed to grasp it. We willingly threw ourselves
into a meaningless electronic fray, felling ani

As neophytes to this sort of combat, we
quickly developed a strategy of pressing as

many buttons as possible while spouting ar

the Flies." Certainly we gave in to violence
just as easily as they did. We willingly battled
dragons and undead skeleton monsters, col

But even in our moment of animalistic
abandon, while gleefully thrusting our swords
into goblins and calling lightning down from
the sky, we couldn't shake our training.
"You'll note there are no girls in this

chance. Ms. Pac-Man could certainly hold
her own against Pac-Man in gobbling dots
and evading monsters. But she never gave up
her bow. the symbol of her deeply-rooted
feminine power. We've come a long way in
7(H) years.
It would seem that the empowered woman

her pores. She seemed completely oblivious
to the gaggle of prepubescent boys ogling her

looked at each other,equally intimidated and

femininity. When she left Nickel City, her
muscles would be taut and toned.
We, however,left Nickel City with only our
combined total of 12 tickets won at Skeeßall.
The neon rings and rubber monster finger
puppets staring at us from the glass display
case of prizes did not claim our tickets. After
all. we were only 34.988 tickets short of the in
finitely more alluring electric drill. Needless
to say. we'll be going back.

During finals week last spring, we took
a road trip to the nickel arcade. With
Dead Week now upon us again, we
delve deep into the coal beds of our pasts,
looking for any distraction from our present
obligations.
Nickel City, Cupertino's notorious nickel
arcade, clings like a gray barnacle to the side
of Highway 85. We had retreated there from
our phony interdisciplinary programs that are
full of students in classes driven by issues of
identity and the collapse of meaning. We
found the arcade such a relief that we consid
ered allowing a Nintendo system to occupy
valuable shelf space alongside "Chez Panisse
Desserts" and Foucault.
So we were in Heaven, pitting our finals
impoverished brains against Ms. Pac-Man,
Dance Dance Revolution and Skeeßall. It
smelled like an eight-year-old boy's dream. It
was a feminist studies nightmare.
We are not normally violent people. But
that changes during finals week. Rather than
taking our violence out on computers and
housemates, we took it out on griffins.
It was probably called something generic,
like "Medieval Attack," or "Quest of the
Sword." It lived on the back wall with all the
other outdated games. Choose your hero —
the Cleric, the Wizard, the Elf or the Dwarf.
Fight your way t0... well, surely there must
