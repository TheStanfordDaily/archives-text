## WEEKEND OF WOE Devastating losses dealt to four different Cardinal squads Second-round upset marks season's end Fifth-ranked Card lose a four-set elimination match to No. 15 Santa Clara on Saturday 
### ANDREW LOMELI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Maples Pavilion's loudest cheers this season
supporting the No. 5 women's volleyball team last
Saturday night, the Cardinal could only watch in dis
belief as freshman outside hitter Foluke Akinrade
wo's attack sailed over the net and landed just out of
bounds. Game, set, match: Santa Clara.
Thus ended a turbulent season plagued by in
juries, and thus ended any hope of repeating as na
tional champions.
No. 15 Santa Clara (25-4) eliminated Stanford
(26-6) in the NCAA Tournament's second round last
Saturday. 3-1 (23-30,30-19,30-27,31-29). The Bron
cos' win marks their first over Stanford in 20 meet
ings.
"I'm proud of my team," Stanford head coach
John Dunning said. "They've been through a lot this
season. It's been crazy with all the injuries, but we've
been resilient."
Santa Clara's offense proved too much for Stan
ford, as the Broncos hit .393 for the match, the high
est percentage posted by a Stanford opponent all
season. Junior Kim McGiven and sophomore Annal
isa Muratore notched 19 and 16 kills, respectively,
while three other Santa Clara players hit in double
figures. Stanford junior outside hitter Kristin
Richards collected 23 kills while the Cardinal hit just
.224.
Stanford began game four with passion, stealing
the early lead at 8-3. But the Broncos slowly clawed
back, forcing ties at 28-all and 29-all, setting up Ak
inradewo's match-point hitting error.
Sloppy play led to Stanford's demise in game
three. A combination of front row miscommunica
tion and a disputed out-of-bounds call ended a late
Cardinal run.
The Broncos dominated game two from start to
finish. Trailing for the first time in its tournament
run, Stanford hit an abysmal .057 to Santa Clara's
.474. The Broncos took the first point and led
throughout, with a Stanford foul ending the game.
In game one, three Richards kills propelled the
Cardinal to an early 7-2 lead and induced a Santa
Clara timeout. Perhaps energized by a strong visiting
fan contingent, the Broncos surged to catch Stanford
at 14-all.The teams would then exchange blows until
two more Richards kills put the Cardinal ahead for
good at 21-19. The Cardinal cruised to 30-23, with an
Akinradewo kill capping the spurt.
Dunning said he told his team that nothing he
could say would make them feel any better. Mean
while, Richards' tears did all the players' talking
postgame.
One night earlier, Stanford scored a decisive 3-0
(30-25,30-20,30-21) victory over Nevada (18-13) in
the tournament's first round. Freshman outside hit
ter Erin Waller added a career-high 11 kills to
Richards' 22, propelling Stanford to .287 hitting.The
Wolf Pack's Salaia Salave'a notched 12 kills, but her
team hit just .160.
Game one saw abysmal hitting from both teams,
as Stanford and Nevada hit. 114 and. 152, respective
ly. Early in the game, Richards notched her 500 th ca-
