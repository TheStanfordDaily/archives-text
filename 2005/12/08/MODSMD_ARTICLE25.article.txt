# Cardinal blow second-half lead in loss to UC-Davis
## Men’s basketball becomes second sport to fall to NCAA Division I newcomer, Davis MBBALL 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After falling to Montana by 19 points
two days earlier, Stanford (2-3) stalled yet
again on Sunday against an underdog op
ponent. And after yet another shocking set
hack — this time 64-58 at the hands of UC-
Davis — Stanford's flaws seem more seri
ous than anyone could have predicted.
The Cardinal seemed to be on their
heels for most of the game, allowing the
more aggressive Aggies — a small Division
II club in the midst of a transition to Divi
sion I that was winless before Sunday's con
test — to control the momentum down the
stretch.
After the game, Johnson said that a
"sense of panic" had set in for his players.
"Somewhere along the line these past
few weeks, we've lost confidence," he said.
The teams traded baskets down the
stretch to keep the score close, but UC-
Davis went on an 8-2 run to take a 60-52
lead with a minute remaining. At that point,
all Stanford could do was foul and hope
UC-Davis missed enough of its free throws
to keep Stanford in the game. The Aggies
made just seven of 12 from the line down
the stretch, but the Cardinal proved even
less productive on the offensive end and
failed to cut into the lead.
The Cardinal have often come out flat
footed this season, initially playing tenta
tively against smaller and less-talented op
ponents. They did just the opposite against
the Aggies, beginning the first half with a
20-8 run before shifting into neutral for
much of the rest of the game.
The Aggies, meanwhile, used the formu
la that Stanford has adopted repeatedly
this season, making up for poor shooting by
attacking the offensive glass and the bas
ket, resulting in second-chance opportuni
ties and free throw attempts. UC-Davts was
the aggressor, disconcerting considering its
tallest key player is 6-foot-9 Jesse Lopez
Low and the Cardinal's is 6-foot-ll Matt
Haryasz. The Aggies pulled down 40 re
bounds to the Cardinal's 33 and shot 13
more free throws.
The poor play of Stanford's two normal-
