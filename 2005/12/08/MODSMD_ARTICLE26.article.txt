# Tennessee extends streak to 10 over Cardinal women
## No. 12 Stanford picks up its second loss of the season with a loss to undefeated No. 2 Tennessee 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the first time since Dec. 27,2003. the
Stanford women's basketball team left
Maples Pavilion without a win. The streak
of 23 straight home victories, which includ
ed last year's perfect 13-0 record, ended
Sunday afternoon at the hands of top
ranked Tennessee by a score of 74-67.
The Lady Vols extended a streak of their
own,as Pat Summitt'steam has now won 10
straight against the Cardinal, dating back to
19%.
"The best thing is our team feels really
disappointed," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "We're hurt by the loss
and no one's saying, 'Oh gosh, we're happy
to be close.' We're not excited to be close."
After a late first-half lapse left No. 11
Stanford (4-2) with a seven-point deficit at
the break, the Cardinal jumped out of the
locker room aggressively, opening the sec
ond half with a 21-12 run. Stanford capped

the rally with a jumpshot from junior center
Brooke Smith to take a 49-47 lead with a lit
tle over eight minutes remaining.
However, the Lady Vols (7-0) responded
to the Cardinal's run with three key stretch
plays that swung the momentum and put
the game out of reach.
"I thought,at points, we had them on the
ropes a little bit, but we did not throw any
knockout punches," VanDerveer said."Tbe
game came down to a series of about five

plays in the second half. We have to be the
ones to make those kinds of plays."
Senior center Tye'sha Fluker took a
questionable charge call against Stanford
junior forward Kristin Newlin with 9:06 left,
sparking the Lady Vols' rally. Newlin had
thrived inside all game, scoring a career-high
21 points on 8-10 shooting and grabbing 10
boards, but her fourth foul forced her to play
conservatively in the final minutes.
"I think that her fourth foul took her out

of the game physically." sophomore guard
Candice Wiggins said. "It gave them the
ball, more of the momentum and it made it
hard for us on both ends of the court."
With Tennessee up 52-51 and 5:41 to go,
a familiar Cardinal killer returned to once
again haunt the Maples faithful in crunch
time. Senior guard Shanna Zolman, who hit
a game-winning three at the buzzer in last
year's 70-67 thriller in Knoxvillc. launched a
three from far outside. The ball clanked off
the back iron but popped straight up and
fell into the twine to widen the lead to four,
giving the Lady Vols some breathing room.
"Three points are three points — it
doesn't matter how it goes in," Zolman said,
laughing. "I thrive in — and love — the
pressure. If I've got an open look. I don't re
ally care where it is — I'm going to shoot."
The final blow came almost two minutes
later, when sophomore guard Alexis Horn
buckle stole a pass just past half-court fora
breakaway lay-in to put Tennessee up 59-53.
"We found a way to win in a very tough
place to play." Summitt said. "This Stanford
team is a very fine team. We did a better job
of getting the ball to the two people that
were making plays [Zolman and forward
Candace Parker]."
