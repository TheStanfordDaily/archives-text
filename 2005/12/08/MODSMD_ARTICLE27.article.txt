# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Cardinal take USC to brink in NCAA final 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It was a bittersweet moment for the members of
the Stanford men's water polo team as they
stepped together onto the second place platform to
receive their NCAA Championship runners-up
plaque.
Just minutes before, the Cardinal had fallen in
narrow defeat, 3-2, to top-ranked Southern Cali
fornia in the national title game. In the penultimate
game of the tournament, the Cardinal had stepped
up to produce perhaps their finest defensive effort
of the year. Holding the powerful Trojans to their
lowest goal total of the season, Stanford had come
within two goals of claiming the national champi
onship for the first time since 2001.
Still, the effort wasn't quite enough to upset the
highly-favored Trojans â€” and as the Cardinal
waited to be recognized as tournament runners-up,
the questions of what might have been no doubt
circled through every their minds: what if they had
managed to convert just one more of their eight
power play opportunities? What if had been them
that rallied to break the 2-2 fourth period tie in
stead of the Trojans? What if sophomore goalie
Sandy Hohener had been able to make his per
formance in goal one notch more impressive by
saving 12 shots instead of 11?
Regardless of all the ifs left by the title game, the
Cardinal can take full pride in the effort they put
forth against their southern California rivals. In the
lowest scoring championship game in NCAA tour
nament history, Stanford executed its game plan
successfully but was simply done one better by the
TYojans.
"I couldn't be more proud of how we played,"
Cardinal head coach John Vargas said. "We played
like we wanted to play in terms of controlling the
game. We had our matchups and had the right peo
ple on the right guys. It was a great defensive
game."
It became apparent early on in the contest that
the title game would showcase the talents of two of
the nation's most adept defensive squads. Neither
team managed to score until junior driver Juan
Delgadillo put the Trojans on the board midway
