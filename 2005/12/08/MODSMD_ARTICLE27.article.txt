# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Cardinal take USC to brink in NCAA final 
### WES MATEO DESK EDITOR 
It was a bittersweet moment for the members of
the Stanford men's water polo team as they
stepped together onto the second place platform to
receive their NCAA Championship runners-up
plaque.
Just minutes before, the Cardinal had fallen in
narrow defeat, 3-2, to top-ranked Southern Cali
fornia in the national title game. In the penultimate
game of the tournament, the Cardinal had stepped
up to produce perhaps their finest defensive effort
of the year. Holding the powerful Trojans to their
lowest goal total of the season, Stanford had come
within two goals of claiming the national champi
onship for the first time since 2001.
Still, the effort wasn't quite enough to upset the
highly-favored Trojans — and as the Cardinal
waited to be recognized as tournament runners-up,
the questions of what might have been no doubt
circled through every their minds: what if they had
managed to convert just one more of their eight
power play opportunities? What if had been them
that rallied to break the 2-2 fourth period tie in
stead of the Trojans? What if sophomore goalie
Sandy Hohener had been able to make his per
formance in goal one notch more impressive by
saving 12 shots instead of 11?
Regardless of all the ifs left by the title game, the
Cardinal can take full pride in the effort they put
forth against their southern California rivals. In the
lowest scoring championship game in NCAA tour
nament history, Stanford executed its game plan
successfully but was simply done one better by the
TYojans.
"I couldn't be more proud of how we played,"
Cardinal head coach John Vargas said. "We played
like we wanted to play in terms of controlling the
game. We had our matchups and had the right peo
ple on the right guys. It was a great defensive
game."
It became apparent early on in the contest that
the title game would showcase the talents of two of
the nation's most adept defensive squads. Neither
team managed to score until junior driver Juan
Delgadillo put the Trojans on the board midway

Senior captain Peter Varellas contributed a goal
early in the title game, but the Trojans broke a tense
2-2 tie midway through the final period to claim the
victory.
through the first period. Stanford
captain Peter Varellas responded on
the Cardinal's subsequent posses
sion, burying a power play goal to tie
the game up at one apiece.
Senior two-meter defender Ted
Zepfel regained the lead for USC at
6:39 in the second period, but the
Stanford defense buckled down and
held the Trojans scoreless for the re
mainder of the half.
The two teams played to a score
less third period, and the game en
tered the final period of play with
Stanford trailing 2-1. Sophomore

two-meter Michael Bury changed
that less than a minute into the
fourth period as he worked open for
a shot that brought the Cardinal
back even with 6:02 left to play.
A fierce and tense battle ensued
as the clock ticked down on regula
tion. The Cardinal managed to kill
two USC six-on-five advantages, but
Trojan utilityman Pavol Valovic
broke the tie by tallying the eventual
game-winner with 3:10 remaining.
Despite their best efforts, the Car
dinal could not answer with a goal of
their own. After Stanford failed to
convert a power play advantage fol
lowing a Zepfel ejection, the clock
ran out on both the squad's come
back and national title hopes.
But according to preseason pre
dictions, the Cardinal weren't shoe

ins for the NCAA tournament and
certainly weren't supposed to chal
lenge the Trojans for the national
title. Following the loss of water polo
legend Tony Azevedo and other sea
soned veterans to graduation last
year, the Cardinal were seen as lack
ing the size and scoring punch to con
tinue their four-year streak of
NCAA title game appearances.
But when they accepted their
NCAA tournament runners-up
plaque Sunday evening, Stanford
proved most preseason expectations
wrong — except for their own.
"At the start of this season, every
one was telling us we weren't going
to be any good," sophomore two
meter defender Peter Finhyson said.
"Everyone was overlooking us be
cause we lost a lot of key players last
season, including Azevedo. But we
came together and worked hard. We
played well-disciplined, unselfish
water polo. We put aside our egos
and worked as a team — we played
for each other, and as a result we had
a great season."
Stanford's ability to compete this
season came not from the depth of
its roster's talent; instead, it came
from an unmatched spirit of resolve
and the unwavering commitment
held by each member of the squad.
"One of the main reasons [we've

been able to defeat much larger and
stronger opponents] is that we are all
very close friends and have all been
living and playing together for the
last few years," said senior driver
Marcello Pantuliano. "You can see it
in the way we play and our interac
tions. Our bench is the most support
ive in the conference.
When we make mistakes in the
pool we move on, while other teams
self-destruct. With everyone con
tributing as much as possible in each
game — whether it be on offense,
defense or even just in moral support
— everyone is exceeding his role on
the team."
Varellas, who led the Cardinal in
scoring this season with 62 goals,
echoed Pantuliano's sentiment re
garding the cohesive nature of this
year's squad.
"I am absolutely positive that our
team this year was the closest and
most unified of any team 1 have ever
played with," Varellas said. "The
guys on the team are my best friends
and have given me more than any
championship could have. Each suc
cess this year took a complete and
balanced team effort, and I would
not have had it any other way. We
win as a team and we lose as a team.
[We were) a true team in a team
sport, and I couldn't be prouder."
