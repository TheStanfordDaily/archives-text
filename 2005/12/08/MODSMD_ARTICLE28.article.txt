# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Cardinal left singing the Rocky Mountain Blues in Montana Stanford squad outhustled by Grizzlies on both ends of the court 
### DANIEL NOVINSON DESK EDITOR 
Missoula, MT — "Our team's smarter," chanted Montana
students with four minutes to go in Stanford's visit to Missoula
last Friday. The point was hard to argue with after Montana out
played Stanford men's basketball in seemingly every facet of the
game, notching an 88-69 victory on the strength of a 13-0 open
ing spurt and 43 combined points from forwards Virgil Matthews
and Jordan Hasquet.
"In the end, we got out-shot and we got out-rebounded,"
head coach TYent Johnson said. "We've got to get tougher."
With Stanford trailing 69-60 and less than four minutes to go
in the game, senior guards Chris Hernandez and Dan Grunfeld
got tangled, resulting in a turnover and a two-on-none Grizzly
fast break. After Montana guard Kevin Criswell missed a wide
open lay-up, Matthews hit the uncontested put-back after soph
omore forward Taj Finger — who had been giving chase —
gave up pursuit.
Just a minute after Matthews made the layup, he stripped
Hernandez and dished to guard Matt Martin for another lay-in.
Already ahead by double figures, the Grizzlies (4-1) twice found
Matthews behind the Cardinal press on in-bound passes. John
son was whistled fora technical foul with 1:05 to go, and Finger
fouled out two seconds later with the game all but clinched for
Montana.
In their first away game of the season, Stanford (2-3) strug
gled in key situations in front of the 6,929 Montana faithful.

"That's something Stanford uses their student section so
right back at them," Montana head coach Larry Krystkowiak
said. "I'm not sure that many teams would have come in here
tonight and fared very well."
Though the Cardinal came up short, Grunfeld and senior cen
ter Matt I laryasz pioneered a spirited second-half rally. Stanford
started the second half shooting 8-12, and the duo combined for
all 20 Cardinal points in the period's first eight minutes.
Haryasz finished with 22 points and Cirunfeld added 16. but
the defense remained too porous — and the initial hole too
large — for the Cardinal to get any closer than seven points in a
game they never led. All five Grizzly starters finished in double
figures, and Montana shot 58 percent overall and an impressive
61 percent from beyond the arc in the game.
Montana jumped to a 13-0 lead in the opening minutes as
Stanford missed its first six shots, committed five turnovers, and
allowed the Grizzlies several open lay-ups and three-pointers.
Montana took a 44-31 halftime lead on the strength of 15-of-24
first-half shooting from the field, including five-of-seven on
three-pointers.
All the Grizzlies had to do then was hang on for what Has
quet, who finished with 20 points on six-of-seven shooting, called
one of their biggest wins since the Grizzlies beat Stanford three
seasons ago.
"I'm just going to soak it all up, sit in the hot tub tonight and
enjoy it," Krystkowiak said. "It was special."

"That's something Stanford uses their student section so
right back at them," Montana head coach Larry Krystkowiak
said. "I'm not sure that many teams would have come in here
tonight and fared very well."
Though the Cardinal came up short, Grunfeld and senior cen
ter Matt I laryasz pioneered a spirited second-half rally. Stanford
started the second half shooting 8-12, and the duo combined for
all 20 Cardinal points in the period's first eight minutes.
Haryasz finished with 22 points and Cirunfeld added 16. but
the defense remained too porous — and the initial hole too
large — for the Cardinal to get any closer than seven points in a
game they never led. All five Grizzly starters finished in double
figures, and Montana shot 58 percent overall and an impressive
61 percent from beyond the arc in the game.
Montana jumped to a 13-0 lead in the opening minutes as
Stanford missed its first six shots, committed five turnovers, and
allowed the Grizzlies several open lay-ups and three-pointers.
Montana took a 44-31 halftime lead on the strength of 15-of-24
first-half shooting from the field, including five-of-seven on
three-pointers.
All the Grizzlies had to do then was hang on for what Has
quet, who finished with 20 points on six-of-seven shooting, called
one of their biggest wins since the Grizzlies beat Stanford three
seasons ago.
"I'm just going to soak it all up, sit in the hot tub tonight and
enjoy it," Krystkowiak said. "It was special."
