# "He's in position to control this weight class." HEAD COACH KERRY McCOY ON TANNER GARDNER City of S-invitational
## 
### DENIS GRIFFIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford wrestling competed in
the Las Vegas Invitational over the
past weekend, searching for momen
tum with the heart of its season rapid
ly approaching. But Stanford
wrestling took a step back in Sin City,
with just one of 10 wrestlers placing.
"We're disappointed that we did
n't reach the goals we had," head
coach Kerry McCoy said. "We wanted
to have more guys do better, but over
all, I think it was good that we got ex
posed to some of the nation's top
teams. Even when we didn't get to
wrestle them, our guys got to see how
those guys are competing. Maybe
when they see that same stuff that
we're telling them — basic technical
points that the best guys are doing —
they see that we're telling them the
right stuff to do."
Sophomore captain Tanner Gard
ner proved the team's most reliable
performer yet again, taking fourth in
the 125-pound weight class; he was
the only Stanford wrestler to place in
the tournament. Gardner finished
with a 5-2 record and lost 4-3 in the
third-place match to eighth-ranked
Chad Mendes of Cal Poly.
Ironically, Gardner and Mendes
had already faced one another on the
mat once this year, and then too
Mendes captured a one-point victory.
McCoy emphasized, however, that
while their outcomes may have been
the same, the two matches had vastly
different tones.
"I think if that match this weekend
was seven minutes, he would have got

wrestlers. Zupancic won

his first two

bouts be
fore an in
jury.
"It was

sort of the

same thing as

happened in the Cal
Open," McCoy said.

"[Zupancic] was on a roll

pound sophomore Josh Zu
pancic. Loescher came within
a single match of placing, fin
ishing 4-2 after facing three of
the nation's top-ranked

but ended up getting hurt and

— r p c>
having to pull out of the whole

him." McCoy said. "[Gardner] still
made a couple of mistakes and wasn't
able to come back from it, but I think
to date that was one of the best
matches he's wrestled all year. He re
ally controlled the pace of the match."
McCoy sees big things down the
line for Gardner this season.
"He's made some adjustments and
put himself in a position to really con
trol this weight class in the conference
and be an Ail-American," McCoy
said. "If you don't get your hand
raised, you've got something to learn
from, something to work on."
Other Stanford performances of
note came from 157-pound sopho
more Scott Loescher and 149-

thing. He still hasn't lost a match,so he
has the potential to do some great
things."
The Cardinal take a two-week
break from competition for finals.
Then the squad is scheduled to take
part in two more tournaments before

the regular season swings into full
gear with the Lone Star Duals in
Grand Prairie, Texas, where the team
will face Harvard, North Carolina and
Army.
"I think the number one thing is
we've got to get our guys healthy,"
McCoy said. "Then, the biggest thing
is they've got to believe in themselves
and know that we're doing the right
thing, and they're doing the right
thing. Then, when the time comes,
we'll be where we need to be at the
end of the year."

"I think the number one thing is
we've got to get our guys healthy,"
McCoy said. "Then, the biggest thing
is they've got to believe in themselves
and know that we're doing the right
thing, and they're doing the right
thing. Then, when the time comes,
we'll be where we need to be at the
end of the year."

Sophomore Josh Zupancic opened the Las Vegas Invitational in grand style, winning his first two matches and building
up his momentum in the process, but an injury forced Zupancic to withdraw from the weekend's competition.

Stanford wrestling competed in
the Las Vegas Invitational over the
past weekend, searching for momen
tum with the heart of its season rapid
ly approaching. But Stanford
wrestling took a step back in Sin City,
with just one of 10 wrestlers placing.
"We're disappointed that we did
n't reach the goals we had," head
coach Kerry McCoy said. "We wanted
to have more guys do better, but over
all, I think it was good that we got ex
posed to some of the nation's top
teams. Even when we didn't get to
wrestle them, our guys got to see how
those guys are competing. Maybe
when they see that same stuff that
we're telling them — basic technical
points that the best guys are doing —
they see that we're telling them the
right stuff to do."
Sophomore captain Tanner Gard
ner proved the team's most reliable
performer yet again, taking fourth in
the 125-pound weight class; he was
the only Stanford wrestler to place in
the tournament. Gardner finished
with a 5-2 record and lost 4-3 in the
third-place match to eighth-ranked
Chad Mendes of Cal Poly.
Ironically, Gardner and Mendes
had already faced one another on the
mat once this year, and then too
Mendes captured a one-point victory.
McCoy emphasized, however, that
while their outcomes may have been
the same, the two matches had vastly
different tones.
"I think if that match this weekend
was seven minutes, he would have got

wrestlers. Zupancic won

his first two

bouts be
fore an in
jury.
"It was

sort of the

same thing as

happened in the Cal
Open," McCoy said.

"[Zupancic] was on a roll

pound sophomore Josh Zu
pancic. Loescher came within
a single match of placing, fin
ishing 4-2 after facing three of
the nation's top-ranked

but ended up getting hurt and

— r p c>
having to pull out of the whole

him." McCoy said. "[Gardner] still
made a couple of mistakes and wasn't
able to come back from it, but I think
to date that was one of the best
matches he's wrestled all year. He re
ally controlled the pace of the match."
McCoy sees big things down the
line for Gardner this season.
"He's made some adjustments and
put himself in a position to really con
trol this weight class in the conference
and be an Ail-American," McCoy
said. "If you don't get your hand
raised, you've got something to learn
from, something to work on."
Other Stanford performances of
note came from 157-pound sopho
more Scott Loescher and 149-

thing. He still hasn't lost a match,so he
has the potential to do some great
things."
The Cardinal take a two-week
break from competition for finals.
Then the squad is scheduled to take
part in two more tournaments before

the regular season swings into full
gear with the Lone Star Duals in
Grand Prairie, Texas, where the team
will face Harvard, North Carolina and
Army.
"I think the number one thing is
we've got to get our guys healthy,"
McCoy said. "Then, the biggest thing
is they've got to believe in themselves
and know that we're doing the right
thing, and they're doing the right
thing. Then, when the time comes,
we'll be where we need to be at the
end of the year."
