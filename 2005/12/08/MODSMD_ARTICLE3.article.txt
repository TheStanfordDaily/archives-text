## Katrina transfers prepare to leave life on the Farm Stanford hosted 38 students from Gulf Coast institutions 
### MARK KOGAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Aug. 29,2005 Hurricane Katrina battered
the Gulf Coast, sweeping through Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama, leaving desolation and
ruin in its wake. Among the millions of displaced
individuals were 38 students — 12 graduates and
26 undergraduates — from TUlane, Xavier, Dil
lard and Loyola who decided to make Stanford
their temporary home for the fall quarter while
their universities were repaired and rebuilt.
Now, with fall quarter winding to a close, these
students must make preparations to move back
home and continue their educations at their
home institutions.
For many, the transfer to Stanford came as a
surprise.
"Stanford initially said they weren't accept
ing anyone, that they weren't doing a guest pro-
gram," said junior Andreana Or
fitelli, a transfer from TUlane. "But a
few days later, they changed their
minds."
Once accepted, the applications
were quickly processed and closed
and the new students were prompt
ly en route to their temporary
school for the fall quarter.
"I applied TUesday or Wednes
day, got accepted Thursday and flew
out to Stanford that Friday," said
sophomore Meagan Minor, a trans
fer from Xavier.
This quick and streamlined
process continued as these transfers
were incorporated into New Stu
dent Orientation along with all
other transfer students and the in
coming freshman class.
"[Tlie administration] has been
wonderful and very supportive,"
Minor said "They treated us like
their own students."
As a whole, the Louisiana stu
dents also consider Stanford as one
of the more flexible schools in terms
of attempting to transfer into.
"When I went to UC-Berkeley
to see if I could get in there, they al
ways gave me the idea that it was
just the biggest hassle in the world
for them to even speak to me," said
junior Tom Connor, a transfer from
TUlane. "I got the exact opposite
here; everyone has been very help
ful, friendly and understanding."
When asked about their short
time spent here at Stanford, the
Gulf Coast students all seem happy
with their experiences.
"It's been fantastic from the per
spective that most students are nice
and down-to-earth and the school
has been helpful and accommodat
ing at every opportunity," Connor
said.
However, now that the quarter is
nearing an end, come Dec. 17 the
Gulf Coast transfer students must
be packed up and ready to head out,
either to their original schools or al
ternate locations.
"Students admitted through the
autumn quarter guest program
were offered enrollment for one
quarter so that they could continue
their studies until their universities
and colleges were functioning
again," said Interim Dean of Stu

dent Affairs Greg Boardman. "All
the universities that were affected
by hurricane Katrina have an
nounced that they will reopen in
January."
Unlike some other universities,
Stanford is not offering a perma
nent transfer opportunity for relo
cated students. Orfitelli's former
roommate, who is currently attend
ing UC-Irvine under their guest
program, has decided to make a full
transfer and stay at Irvine, an option
offered by the university. UC-
Berkeley is also considering a full
transfer option. However, Stanford
is limiting their offer to one quarter.
"Guest students are welcome to
apply for transfer status through
the usual admission process,"
Boardman said. "If admitted, stu
dents would be offered admission
for fall 2006."
Although many students en
joyed their time at Stanford, most
are excited to return to their other
schools.
"I'm glad I had an opportunity to
continue my education and I'm
grateful that Stanford had such a
program, but I'm looking forward
on going back to TUlane," Orfitelli
said."l'm ready to go back and pick
up where things left off."
Some students look forward not
only to heading back to school, but
also to helping their community re
build after the disaster.
"I miss TUlane, I miss my friends
there and I miss New Orleans,"
Connor said. "There's a lot of good
to be done there, and I think the TU
lane community realizes that. I
want to help with the recovery how
ever I can; the city's been good to
me, and now it's my turn."
As the students prepare for their
finals and begin to pack up their be
longings, they take with them the
best wishes from their Stanford
peers.
"We certainly hope that guest
students will stay in contact with the
friends they've made this quarter, as
well as their advisors and profes
sors," Boardman said.
Many plan to take Boardman up
on his offer.
"I'll definitely keep in touch,"
Minor said. "I've made a lot of
friends and enjoyed many of the
professors. I want to thank all the
students I had the pleasure of com
ing in contact with, and thanks to all
for making this life-changing transi
tion a little smoother."

here; everyone has been very help
ful, friendly and understanding."
When asked about their short
time spent here at Stanford, the
Gulf Coast students all seem happy
with their experiences.
"It's been fantastic from the per
spective that most students are nice
and down-to-earth and the school
has been helpful and accommodat
ing at every opportunity," Connor
said.
However, now that the quarter is
nearing an end, come Dec. 17 the
Gulf Coast transfer students must
be packed up and ready to head out,
either to their original schools or al
ternate locations.
"Students admitted through the
autumn quarter guest program
were offered enrollment for one
quarter so that they could continue
their studies until their universities
and colleges were functioning
again," said Interim Dean of Stu

dent Affairs Greg Boardman. "All
the universities that were affected
by hurricane Katrina have an
nounced that they will reopen in
January."
Unlike some other universities,
Stanford is not offering a perma
nent transfer opportunity for relo
cated students. Orfitelli's former
roommate, who is currently attend
ing UC-Irvine under their guest
program, has decided to make a full
transfer and stay at Irvine, an option
offered by the university. UC-
Berkeley is also considering a full
transfer option. However, Stanford
is limiting their offer to one quarter.
"Guest students are welcome to
apply for transfer status through
the usual admission process,"
Boardman said. "If admitted, stu
dents would be offered admission
for fall 2006."
Although many students en
joyed their time at Stanford, most
are excited to return to their other
schools.
"I'm glad I had an opportunity to
continue my education and I'm
grateful that Stanford had such a
program, but I'm looking forward
on going back to TUlane," Orfitelli
said."l'm ready to go back and pick
up where things left off."
Some students look forward not
only to heading back to school, but
also to helping their community re
build after the disaster.
"I miss TUlane, I miss my friends
there and I miss New Orleans,"
Connor said. "There's a lot of good
to be done there, and I think the TU
lane community realizes that. I
want to help with the recovery how
ever I can; the city's been good to
me, and now it's my turn."
As the students prepare for their
finals and begin to pack up their be
longings, they take with them the
best wishes from their Stanford
peers.
"We certainly hope that guest
students will stay in contact with the
friends they've made this quarter, as
well as their advisors and profes
sors," Boardman said.
Many plan to take Boardman up
on his offer.
"I'll definitely keep in touch,"
Minor said. "I've made a lot of
friends and enjoyed many of the
professors. I want to thank all the
students I had the pleasure of com
ing in contact with, and thanks to all
for making this life-changing transi
tion a little smoother."
On Aug. 29,2005 Hurricane Katrina battered
the Gulf Coast, sweeping through Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama, leaving desolation and
ruin in its wake. Among the millions of displaced
individuals were 38 students — 12 graduates and
26 undergraduates — from TUlane, Xavier, Dil
lard and Loyola who decided to make Stanford
their temporary home for the fall quarter while
their universities were repaired and rebuilt.
Now, with fall quarter winding to a close, these
students must make preparations to move back
home and continue their educations at their
home institutions.
For many, the transfer to Stanford came as a
surprise.
"Stanford initially said they weren't accept
ing anyone, that they weren't doing a guest pro-
gram," said junior Andreana Or
fitelli, a transfer from TUlane. "But a
few days later, they changed their
minds."
Once accepted, the applications
were quickly processed and closed
and the new students were prompt
ly en route to their temporary
school for the fall quarter.
"I applied TUesday or Wednes
day, got accepted Thursday and flew
out to Stanford that Friday," said
sophomore Meagan Minor, a trans
fer from Xavier.
This quick and streamlined
process continued as these transfers
were incorporated into New Stu
dent Orientation along with all
other transfer students and the in
coming freshman class.
"[Tlie administration] has been
wonderful and very supportive,"
Minor said "They treated us like
their own students."
As a whole, the Louisiana stu
dents also consider Stanford as one
of the more flexible schools in terms
of attempting to transfer into.
"When I went to UC-Berkeley
to see if I could get in there, they al
ways gave me the idea that it was
just the biggest hassle in the world
for them to even speak to me," said
junior Tom Connor, a transfer from
TUlane. "I got the exact opposite
here; everyone has been very help
ful, friendly and understanding."
