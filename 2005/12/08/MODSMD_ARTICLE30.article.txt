# One concussion won't make me wear a helmet
## 
### 
Ihope this will make you wear a bike helmet,"
my father told me, an hour or so after I had re
gained consciousness following a nasty spill in
front of TVessidder around this time last year.
1 did not remember much about the accident,
but the two-square-inch scrape on my temple indi
cated that I hadn't been wearing a helmet. I re
membered a long dream in which I walked around
in a world make up of Super Mario-esque blocks; a
faint vision of myself, from outside of my body,
talking to police officers as 1 sat on the walkway
from Tressidder to White Plaza and a brief glimpse
of an ambulance's interior before I closed my eyes
again.
When I came to in the hospital, 1 had a throb
bing pain in my right big toe from the stitches
sewed after I had apparently split it open. I also
sensed that I had been knocked out for longer than
the two hours the doctors claimed, and that I
should probably stay in the hospital overnight for
observation. I had a vague conviction that a bunch
of freshman girls, having heard about my accident,
would come in to comfort me, but the doctor took
an MRI and sent me on my way in less than an
hour. I got the feeling they'd seen a lot of cases like
mine.
The doctors told me my accident could have
been worse, but it was scary enough as it was. I still
have a scar on my left shoulder, and though my
memory of that day slowly came back to me — in
typical Stanford student mode, I was woozy from
skipping lunch and rushing to get work done — I
still have no memory of the actual crash and no
idea how I managed to injure both my right toe and
my left shoulder. And though I was able to use my
concussion as an excuse for behaving erratically for
about a week, my friends soon realized that this
wasn't any different from my usual behavior.
But I still laughed off my dad's suggestion. I have
never worn a bike helmet on campus, and it would
probably take an accident so bad I could never get
back on a bike for me to start wearing one.
My reasoning?
They look stupid. It was hard to explain to my
dad, but it's the same logic that the 98 percent of
Stanford students who don't wear bike helmets use.
If some of the smartest kids in the country decide
they don't need to protect the organ in which their
parents are investing $160,000 during their college
careers, that's good enough for me.
I have no problem wearing a helmet when I
road bike with my dad during the summer. It is ac
tually the least dorky part of my outfit, next to the
yellow, two-sizes-too-small bike jersey, spandex
shorts and clip-on shoes. I feel okay wearing a hel
met when I am racing out of control down a steep
hill at speeds approaching those of my dad's 1964
Volkswagen Bug.
But as much as I might need it, I don't want a
streamlined racing helmet sitting on my newly
coiffed hair when 1 am biking 200 yards from my
dorm to the quad.Though more accidents happen at
the Clock Tower (of death) than in the Tour de
France, I don't care to be mistaken for Lance Arm
strong as I cruise around campus, (ostensibly) pick
ing up girls who are also cruising, their hair blowing
freely in the wind, not constrained by some ostenta
tious piece of plastic.
I don't like the way the straps leave indents
from my ear to my chin. I don't like the way the slits
in the helmet leave three symmetrical ridges in my
hair. I especially don't like having to figure out
what to do with the thing when I go into class,
though I would be willing to bet the costs of yearly
ambulance rides from the Lag parking lot to the
hospital that the helmet would be safe just about
anywhere I left it.
Most Stanford students feel the same way that I
do. Life-threatening bike accidents are a part of
Stanford culture; getting into one is even listed as
one of the "101 Things to Do Before Graduating"
in the Stanford Unofficial Guide.
But according to a recent survey, only about 100
brave Stanford souls wear bike helmets, and you can
bet that many of them take circuitous routes to class
so as to avoid sneering classmates.
About 60 bike accidents are reported on campus
each year, though I'm sure most go unreported.
One of the participants would probably have to be
lying unconscious and bleeding on the pavement, as
I was, for someone to call the police. ("Hold on. It
appears as though my back wheel is slightly out of
alignment. I know we just embarrassed ourselves by
colliding in front of 50 people on the way to class,
but I really think we should forget about those fi
nals we were biking to and just call the police. Or at
least exchange phone and serial numbers.
Oh. You don't know where your bike's serial
number is? Check the inside of the right back fork,
you might have to wipe the grease off first...")
The Stanford hospital sees about 200 patients
from bike accidents per year. Though they don't
keep statistics on how many of those are from Stan
ford, it seems safe to assume that most are — there
aren't many other places in Santa Clara County
with a concentration of 12.000 bicycles in a one
mile radius.
The Transportation Department is working with
the Police Department and Vaden Health Center to
come up with a plan to educate students about bike
accidents, but I can't imagine that would cause stu
dents to sacrifice their vanity by wearing helmets.
At least not if they ask people like me to speak.
The only way we can make biking safer is by get
ting to the root of the problem — make cooler bike
helmets! Plain, white, and semi-circular, like the
ones that skaters wear. Maybe with a Stanford
block "S" on them. It could be the biggest non
book moneymaker for the Stanford Bookstore.
Even my dad and I can agree on that.

Sean Howell, a junior, would like to thank the anony
mous Good Samaritan who called for an ambulance
after his accident last year. If you start a company that
manufactures said hike helmets, send half of the prof
its to showell@stanford.edu.
