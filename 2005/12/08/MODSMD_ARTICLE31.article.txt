## a 						weekly look at arts, entertainment and style at stanford Step into the wonder of the ‘Wardrobe’ 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION WONDERER 
When I was seven, my attempts to get
to Narnia by way of garage, closet and
kitchen cupboard were disappointingly
fruitless. I chalked this up to not having
a proper wardrobe or being British, and
consoled myself by camping under the
dining room table fora weekend.
, fourteen years later, as I settled into
the plushy upholstered seats of New
York City's Ziegfeld Theater, the last
thing I expected to see was blitzkrieg
bombing of Great Britain in the opening
scenes of "The Chronicles of Narnia:
The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."
There's no sugarcoating here, and that's
what sets this movie apart from the
canon of Disney movies.
There is a flood of controversy sur
rounding C.S. Lewis' epic story, widely
regarded as a Christian allegory, and the
Christian-rock CD accompanying the
release of "Narnia," Forget about it. It's
not an issue, as the filmmakers never
waver from their goal of creating a gor
geous and universally meaningful film.
With the flurry of adaptations at the box

office this year, "Chroni
cles of Narnia" is perhaps
the most faithful and en
gaging one yet. one that
might just have Harry Pot
ter running for the hills.
C.S. Lewis never wanted to
see his story translated
onto the silver screen, but
even the late author would
have to admit that this film
comes pretty damn close
to capturing the essence of

Narnia.
Antoine St. Exupery's novel, "The
Little Prince," tells us that children often
have to make allowances for grown-ups.
"Chronicles of Narnia" has a similar
message, as it urges viewers to look at
the world with a sense of wonder. Go
hack, it tells us. Be curious. It is a re
minder to not grow old in mind and
heart, ironic because sonic of the re
porters around me grumbled at having
to interview the young actors who play
the Pcvensic children. "Why aren't we
interviewing Liam Neeson?" they
whined. "What can children possibly tell
us that we don't know?" Plenty.
At the round table press conference,
I found myself directed to table six. It
was oddly full. Paul Fischer, a critic from
Dark Horizons.com. tried to swat me
away as he would a fly hovering too

close to his breakfast pastry.
"Go over there, that table looks
empty." he urged."There's no room here
for you." Was I baby Jesus being refused
room at the inn? No. 1 defiantly pulled
up a chair and found myself seated next
to the only other film critic under the
age of 35, Jeff Sneider of New York Uni
versity. We immediately became allies.
Academy Award-winning producer
Mark Johnson ("Rain Man, ITie Note
book") was surprised when asked what
his favorite story (separate of the Narnia
series) was while he was growing up. But
his eyes lit up as he began to remember
what inspired him about these tales.
"1 remember loving 'The Wind in the
Willows.' I liked the characters and the
fact that the book had a map inside it, 1
liked being able to refer to it and to un
derstand where everyone was going.
And strangely enough, because he
writes so simply, Hemingway's 'The Old
Man and The Sea.'"
"Compassion and forgiveness are es
sential to the book, and hopefully to the
film. They are values that belong to
everybody, for however long we have
been around," says Johnson. "The reli-

gious parallels
you find in the
movie you can
find in other
movies, like
Star Wars and
the Matrix."
I wanted to
take Georgie
Hensley (who
plays Lucy
Pevensie) back
to California

with me the moment I see her skip up to
the table.
"I'm not allowed to start without
James [McAvoy, who plays the faun Mr.
TUmnus]," she says. "I'm going to take
roll now." Hensley informs us, grabbing
the sheet with our names on it and read
ing them aloud. I have a feeling that this
ten-year-old will pronounce my name
correctly while adults always mispro
nounce it "Tom Vu." She does.
It's immediately apparent that out of
a casting call of over 2,(XX) youngsters,
she is the perfect Lucy. She's bright, she's
precocious and more articulate than
most of my Stanford peers, exuding a
rare kind of optimism and curiosity that
she brings to playing the youngest
Pevensie. She'd never acted a day in her
life before "Narnia." a fact it's hard to
get over.

ct's a very good book to open, I
thought I'd look like Lucy...l was being
myself," she states matter-of-factly.
When asked what it was like seeing Nar
nia for the first time, Hensley beams like
it's already Christmas. "They blindfold
ed me, and they kept it a secret. So
Georgie's first reaction is actually
Lucy's first reaction! A lot of Lucy is
Georgie."
Her eyes grow as wide as saucers
when I ask her if she's been to Disney
land and what her favorite rides are.
She's astonished that American kids
don't learn "joined-up writing" (transla
tion: cursive) until they're in third grade,
exclaiming, "We learn that when we're
four or five, we get lines if we don't write
in joined-up writing!"
Frustrated by all the reporters jump
ing down each other's throats, I resorted
to writing a question to Skandar Keynes
(who plays Edmund Pevensie) on the
back of my notepad out of sheer desper
ation. It worked.
INT: If you could escape right now from
this press junket, through a wardrobe,
where would you go?
KEYNES: I'd go to some lush
Caribbean island somewhere, with sun.
New York is really dry. Some place that
is more moist.
TILDA SWINTON: You're looking at
the Fiji water bottle, Skander. that's
where you're going.
HENSLEY: Scotland, or maybe New
Zealand!
McAVOY: Argentina, up in the moun
tains, my friends are on a hiking trip

there right now. I'd hike.
Scotland's Tilda Swinton is delicious
ly scary, both onscreen and off. During
our interview, I half-expected her to turn
me into an ice sculpture the way she
does her enemies in Narnia. As Jadis the
White Witch, she channels all of her
frosty Elizabethan acting skills and is
quite the badass. In the way that "pure
evil must adore pure good," Swinton's
Jadis is Asian's biggest groupie and ad
versary. The filmmakers have made a
faithful adaptation of the children's
story, but "the Christians are welcome,"
Tilda smilingly remarks. Watch out for
the stone table scene; it's intense.
"It was roots from a tree, basically,
nailed onto the top of my head," she ex
plains cheerfully, regarding the White
Witch's intense wig and wardrobe.
That's dedication. She shoots me a
knowing smile after I ask her about to
recall some of her craziest college mem
ories of Cambridge, pleading,"l can't re
member them, they must've been that
good! You should've given me a day to
think about it."
Having been the last member of the
cast to read C.S. Lewis' story, she reaf
firms that the story will always find an
audience: "It takes a child to the place
that they're really dealing with in their
own time, which is the idea of a parent
less world where only they can prevail
and they encounter all the things
they're frightened or and encounter all
of the things they hope will happen to
them, and they turn it around. C.S.
Lewis set out to do this, and in my mind,
he did it."

Didn't your mother teach you not to take candy from strangers?

When I was seven, my attempts to get
to Narnia by way of garage, closet and
kitchen cupboard were disappointingly
fruitless. I chalked this up to not having
a proper wardrobe or being British, and
consoled myself by camping under the
dining room table fora weekend.
, fourteen years later, as I settled into
the plushy upholstered seats of New
York City's Ziegfeld Theater, the last
thing I expected to see was blitzkrieg
bombing of Great Britain in the opening
scenes of "The Chronicles of Narnia:
The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."
There's no sugarcoating here, and that's
what sets this movie apart from the
canon of Disney movies.
There is a flood of controversy sur
rounding C.S. Lewis' epic story, widely
regarded as a Christian allegory, and the
Christian-rock CD accompanying the
release of "Narnia," Forget about it. It's
not an issue, as the filmmakers never
waver from their goal of creating a gor
geous and universally meaningful film.
With the flurry of adaptations at the box

office this year, "Chroni
cles of Narnia" is perhaps
the most faithful and en
gaging one yet. one that
might just have Harry Pot
ter running for the hills.
C.S. Lewis never wanted to
see his story translated
onto the silver screen, but
even the late author would
have to admit that this film
comes pretty damn close
to capturing the essence of

Narnia.
Antoine St. Exupery's novel, "The
Little Prince," tells us that children often
have to make allowances for grown-ups.
"Chronicles of Narnia" has a similar
message, as it urges viewers to look at
the world with a sense of wonder. Go
hack, it tells us. Be curious. It is a re
minder to not grow old in mind and
heart, ironic because sonic of the re
porters around me grumbled at having
to interview the young actors who play
the Pcvensic children. "Why aren't we
interviewing Liam Neeson?" they
whined. "What can children possibly tell
us that we don't know?" Plenty.
At the round table press conference,
I found myself directed to table six. It
was oddly full. Paul Fischer, a critic from
Dark Horizons.com. tried to swat me
away as he would a fly hovering too

close to his breakfast pastry.
"Go over there, that table looks
empty." he urged."There's no room here
for you." Was I baby Jesus being refused
room at the inn? No. 1 defiantly pulled
up a chair and found myself seated next
to the only other film critic under the
age of 35, Jeff Sneider of New York Uni
versity. We immediately became allies.
Academy Award-winning producer
Mark Johnson ("Rain Man, ITie Note
book") was surprised when asked what
his favorite story (separate of the Narnia
series) was while he was growing up. But
his eyes lit up as he began to remember
what inspired him about these tales.
"1 remember loving 'The Wind in the
Willows.' I liked the characters and the
fact that the book had a map inside it, 1
liked being able to refer to it and to un
derstand where everyone was going.
And strangely enough, because he
writes so simply, Hemingway's 'The Old
Man and The Sea.'"
"Compassion and forgiveness are es
sential to the book, and hopefully to the
film. They are values that belong to
everybody, for however long we have
been around," says Johnson. "The reli-

gious parallels
you find in the
movie you can
find in other
movies, like
Star Wars and
the Matrix."
I wanted to
take Georgie
Hensley (who
plays Lucy
Pevensie) back
to California

with me the moment I see her skip up to
the table.
"I'm not allowed to start without
James [McAvoy, who plays the faun Mr.
TUmnus]," she says. "I'm going to take
roll now." Hensley informs us, grabbing
the sheet with our names on it and read
ing them aloud. I have a feeling that this
ten-year-old will pronounce my name
correctly while adults always mispro
nounce it "Tom Vu." She does.
It's immediately apparent that out of
a casting call of over 2,(XX) youngsters,
she is the perfect Lucy. She's bright, she's
precocious and more articulate than
most of my Stanford peers, exuding a
rare kind of optimism and curiosity that
she brings to playing the youngest
Pevensie. She'd never acted a day in her
life before "Narnia." a fact it's hard to
get over.

ct's a very good book to open, I
thought I'd look like Lucy...l was being
myself," she states matter-of-factly.
When asked what it was like seeing Nar
nia for the first time, Hensley beams like
it's already Christmas. "They blindfold
ed me, and they kept it a secret. So
Georgie's first reaction is actually
Lucy's first reaction! A lot of Lucy is
Georgie."
Her eyes grow as wide as saucers
when I ask her if she's been to Disney
land and what her favorite rides are.
She's astonished that American kids
don't learn "joined-up writing" (transla
tion: cursive) until they're in third grade,
exclaiming, "We learn that when we're
four or five, we get lines if we don't write
in joined-up writing!"
Frustrated by all the reporters jump
ing down each other's throats, I resorted
to writing a question to Skandar Keynes
(who plays Edmund Pevensie) on the
back of my notepad out of sheer desper
ation. It worked.
INT: If you could escape right now from
this press junket, through a wardrobe,
where would you go?
KEYNES: I'd go to some lush
Caribbean island somewhere, with sun.
New York is really dry. Some place that
is more moist.
TILDA SWINTON: You're looking at
the Fiji water bottle, Skander. that's
where you're going.
HENSLEY: Scotland, or maybe New
Zealand!
McAVOY: Argentina, up in the moun
tains, my friends are on a hiking trip

there right now. I'd hike.
Scotland's Tilda Swinton is delicious
ly scary, both onscreen and off. During
our interview, I half-expected her to turn
me into an ice sculpture the way she
does her enemies in Narnia. As Jadis the
White Witch, she channels all of her
frosty Elizabethan acting skills and is
quite the badass. In the way that "pure
evil must adore pure good," Swinton's
Jadis is Asian's biggest groupie and ad
versary. The filmmakers have made a
faithful adaptation of the children's
story, but "the Christians are welcome,"
Tilda smilingly remarks. Watch out for
the stone table scene; it's intense.
"It was roots from a tree, basically,
nailed onto the top of my head," she ex
plains cheerfully, regarding the White
Witch's intense wig and wardrobe.
That's dedication. She shoots me a
knowing smile after I ask her about to
recall some of her craziest college mem
ories of Cambridge, pleading,"l can't re
member them, they must've been that
good! You should've given me a day to
think about it."
Having been the last member of the
cast to read C.S. Lewis' story, she reaf
firms that the story will always find an

"It was roots from a tree, basically,

Didn't your mother teach you not to take candy from strangers?

When I was seven, my attempts to get
to Narnia by way of garage, closet and
kitchen cupboard were disappointingly
fruitless. I chalked this up to not having
a proper wardrobe or being British, and
consoled myself by camping under the
dining room table fora weekend.
, fourteen years later, as I settled into
the plushy upholstered seats of New
York City's Ziegfeld Theater, the last
thing I expected to see was blitzkrieg
bombing of Great Britain in the opening
scenes of "The Chronicles of Narnia:
The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."
There's no sugarcoating here, and that's
what sets this movie apart from the
canon of Disney movies.
There is a flood of controversy sur
rounding C.S. Lewis' epic story, widely
regarded as a Christian allegory, and the
Christian-rock CD accompanying the
release of "Narnia," Forget about it. It's
not an issue, as the filmmakers never
waver from their goal of creating a gor
geous and universally meaningful film.
With the flurry of adaptations at the box

office this year, "Chroni
cles of Narnia" is perhaps
the most faithful and en
gaging one yet. one that
might just have Harry Pot
ter running for the hills.
C.S. Lewis never wanted to
see his story translated
onto the silver screen, but
even the late author would
have to admit that this film
comes pretty damn close
to capturing the essence of

Narnia.
Antoine St. Exupery's novel, "The
Little Prince," tells us that children often
have to make allowances for grown-ups.
"Chronicles of Narnia" has a similar
message, as it urges viewers to look at
the world with a sense of wonder. Go
hack, it tells us. Be curious. It is a re
minder to not grow old in mind and
heart, ironic because sonic of the re
porters around me grumbled at having
to interview the young actors who play
the Pcvensic children. "Why aren't we
interviewing Liam Neeson?" they
whined. "What can children possibly tell
us that we don't know?" Plenty.
At the round table press conference,
I found myself directed to table six. It
was oddly full. Paul Fischer, a critic from
Dark Horizons.com. tried to swat me
away as he would a fly hovering too

close to his breakfast pastry.
"Go over there, that table looks
empty." he urged."There's no room here
for you." Was I baby Jesus being refused
room at the inn? No. 1 defiantly pulled
up a chair and found myself seated next
to the only other film critic under the
age of 35, Jeff Sneider of New York Uni
versity. We immediately became allies.
Academy Award-winning producer
Mark Johnson ("Rain Man, ITie Note
book") was surprised when asked what
his favorite story (separate of the Narnia
series) was while he was growing up. But
his eyes lit up as he began to remember
what inspired him about these tales.
"1 remember loving 'The Wind in the
Willows.' I liked the characters and the
fact that the book had a map inside it, 1
liked being able to refer to it and to un
derstand where everyone was going.
And strangely enough, because he
writes so simply, Hemingway's 'The Old
Man and The Sea.'"
"Compassion and forgiveness are es
sential to the book, and hopefully to the
film. They are values that belong to
everybody, for however long we have
been around," says Johnson. "The reli-

gious parallels
you find in the
movie you can
find in other
movies, like
Star Wars and
the Matrix."
I wanted to
take Georgie
Hensley (who
plays Lucy
Pevensie) back
to California

with me the moment I see her skip up to
the table.
"I'm not allowed to start without
James [McAvoy, who plays the faun Mr.
TUmnus]," she says. "I'm going to take
roll now." Hensley informs us, grabbing
the sheet with our names on it and read
ing them aloud. I have a feeling that this
ten-year-old will pronounce my name
correctly while adults always mispro
nounce it "Tom Vu." She does.
It's immediately apparent that out of
a casting call of over 2,(XX) youngsters,
she is the perfect Lucy. She's bright, she's
precocious and more articulate than
most of my Stanford peers, exuding a
rare kind of optimism and curiosity that
she brings to playing the youngest
Pevensie. She'd never acted a day in her
life before "Narnia." a fact it's hard to
get over.

ct's a very good book to open, I
thought I'd look like Lucy...l was being
myself," she states matter-of-factly.
When asked what it was like seeing Nar
nia for the first time, Hensley beams like
it's already Christmas. "They blindfold
ed me, and they kept it a secret. So
Georgie's first reaction is actually
Lucy's first reaction! A lot of Lucy is
Georgie."
Her eyes grow as wide as saucers
when I ask her if she's been to Disney
land and what her favorite rides are.
She's astonished that American kids
don't learn "joined-up writing" (transla
tion: cursive) until they're in third grade,
exclaiming, "We learn that when we're
four or five, we get lines if we don't write
in joined-up writing!"
Frustrated by all the reporters jump
ing down each other's throats, I resorted
to writing a question to Skandar Keynes
(who plays Edmund Pevensie) on the
back of my notepad out of sheer desper
ation. It worked.
INT: If you could escape right now from
this press junket, through a wardrobe,
where would you go?
KEYNES: I'd go to some lush
Caribbean island somewhere, with sun.
New York is really dry. Some place that
is more moist.
TILDA SWINTON: You're looking at
the Fiji water bottle, Skander. that's
where you're going.
HENSLEY: Scotland, or maybe New
Zealand!
McAVOY: Argentina, up in the moun
tains, my friends are on a hiking trip

there right now. I'd hike.
Scotland's Tilda Swinton is delicious
ly scary, both onscreen and off. During
our interview, I half-expected her to turn
me into an ice sculpture the way she
does her enemies in Narnia. As Jadis the
White Witch, she channels all of her
frosty Elizabethan acting skills and is
quite the badass. In the way that "pure
evil must adore pure good," Swinton's
Jadis is Asian's biggest groupie and ad
versary. The filmmakers have made a
faithful adaptation of the children's
story, but "the Christians are welcome,"
Tilda smilingly remarks. Watch out for
the stone table scene; it's intense.
"It was roots from a tree, basically,
nailed onto the top of my head," she ex
plains cheerfully, regarding the White
Witch's intense wig and wardrobe.
That's dedication. She shoots me a
knowing smile after I ask her about to
recall some of her craziest college mem
ories of Cambridge, pleading,"l can't re
member them, they must've been that
good! You should've given me a day to
think about it."
Having been the last member of the
cast to read C.S. Lewis' story, she reaf
firms that the story will always find an
audience: "It takes a child to the place
that they're really dealing with in their
own time, which is the idea of a parent
less world where only they can prevail
and they encounter all the things
they're frightened or and encounter all
of the things they hope will happen to
them, and they turn it around. C.S.
Lewis set out to do this, and in my mind,
he did it."
