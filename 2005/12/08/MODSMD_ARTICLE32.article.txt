# WANTED (preferably alive): Gyllenhaal and Lee
## 
### 
Jake Gyllenhaal saunters into the room, a long-in
the-limbs manchild garbed in navy blue. It's immedi
ately obvious that his groomed stubble is the only ac
cessory removing him from your average high school
student. The "Jarhead" muscles have apparently de
flated, and his slender frame seems vastly more fitting
and youthful. He's trailed by Ang Lee, a gentle-looking
Asian man in his 50s who dons an oversized sweatshirt
and looks like the perfect person to share a hot choco
late and the Sunday Times crossword puzzle with.
Intermission was fortunate enough to catch them at
a press junket for "Brokeback Mountain," a film that
showcases them both at the pinnacle of their abilities,

at least so far. And yet, making the rounds for perhaps
the most important and stereotype-shattering ro
mance made in the last ten years hasn't shaken their
modesty even an inch. Gyllenhaal counters Lee's airy
and aloof self-deprecation with a surprising intensity,
and their banter hits at a close bond.
Lee emphasizes that "Brokeback" was not made to
support gay rights, or to enter into the national debate
on the subject in any context. Gyllenhaal, on the other
hand, clearly thinks the film sends a bold message â€”
absolutely necessary fora country that might not nec
essarily be ready to receive it. The following interview
explores these themes.
QUESTION: There has been a lot of talk about
how this movie has been labeled "the gay cowboy
movie." How do you feel about that?
ANG LEE: Well, we invite all of those people to
come see it. So far most of the people who have seen it
left saying that it was just a love story.
JAKE GYLLENHAAL: We actually had one jour
nalist first report on it as "the gay cowboy movie" and
then apologize after he saw it... I have to say that if I
would have been given the script a few years ago, or if
it had been pitched that way to me, I wouldn't have
taken it.
AL: I don't have a problem with it being called that
really. What 1 do worry about is people think it would
be a funny movie like "Blazing Saddles" or something.
Q: Why did you both decide to take on this project
in the first place if you knew it would be so controver
sial?
AL: It was just a great piece of writing. That was
what was so attractive to me.
JG: The story on its own carries real weight. It has
power to it. I'm a city kid, so I've never ridden a horse,
and it was going to be a new experience. I think in the
end that worked out for me because my character Jack
is in a lot of ways always pretending to be better at
things than he is.
Q: How was it filming some of the more graphic sex
ual instances? How did you go about doing that?
AL: We found that the best thing to do was just roll
the camera and see what happens. We couldn't be shy.
JG: I 've done love scenes with women I haven't
been attracted to, and women I probably should have
been less attracted to, so it wasn't that much of a
stretch. Most of the love scenes come out of fighting
between the two guys, and the fighting was something
familiar. Plus, hey, we're all human beings, we all have
lips, you just get in there and do it.
Q: For Jake, you filmed "Brokeback" before "Jar
head," how was it to switch between two very different
roles?
JG: I actually have a friend who is a soldier right
now in Iraq and when I told him I was going to be play
ing a marine the first thing he said was 'Oh man, not the
gay cowboy.' But really, I like working in this gray area.
In a lot of ways 1 considered this one role preparation
for the other.

Q: Your co-star Heath Ledger will next be appear
ing as Casanova, the greatest lover of women of all
time. Do you feel like you need to find a new role to
validate your sexuality?
JG: I don't need to play any role to affirm my sexu
ality. I don't feel like I need to affirm anything to any
one. When someone offers you a job playing Casanova,
you take it whether you're gay or straight.
Q: Ang, what greater themes do you want to get
across in this film, underneath the fact that it is a love
story between two men?
AL: I really believe it is about free will versus social
obligations. As the story unfolds we see what society
does to the characters, and not only that but what the
characters do to themselves because of how they think
society will perceive them.
Q: Why is it that most of the love scenes in the movie
start off violent with a lot of tension between you and
Heath?
JG: I think we were both dealing with it being un
comfortable, and the fighting was just a more comfort
able, easier place to go. That's how Heath and I related
to each other. But there were other, harder, more ten
der scenes too. I have ex-girlfriends coming up to me
after they see it saying 'Hey, that's not how you treated
me!'
Q: Do you think this is important that this film, with
this message, come out at this point in time? If so, why?
AL: It's a love story. Love stories are important to
come out anytime. I'm always looking for new materi
al. 1 didn't do it because it was timely. People started
trying to make this story into a move eight years ago
and couldn't figure out how to do it. I figured I could
n't wait for the whole world to be ready for it before I
made it. It was definitely not calculated.
JG: Annie actually wrote a note in the limited edi
tion of the story she gave me saying that the name of
my character Jack TWist actually refers to the
strength a rodeo rider must have in his legs to hold on
to a bull, and that it is symbolic of the strength you need
to hold on to something you truly believe in that makeS
you feel alive. I think our generation feels like maybe,
hopefully somewhere out there is a majority that has a
different mentality toward this subject. Like I said, at
age 161 would have said no way to this movie. It gives
me hope that we're all growing.
Q: How was it to have Jake playing the clearly gajpj
cowboy?
AL: There is really i|o clear indication how gay J
Heath's character is. Yes, you can say Jake's character
is more gay, but they are both family men as well. Ennis
(Ledger) just hasn't ever known any other lifestyle. It's
not like he would ever go off to San Francisco. I
JG: 1 think my character is just more open and pro
gressive. There's a stereotype that if I'm the more gay
character then T also have to be more feminine, and
Heath has to be more of the John Wayne type. I think
this doesn't hold exactly true.
Q: Jake, how was it to work withjAng Lee for the
first time?

JG: I've gotta say that at times it could be very con
fusing. He would say things all the time... like with
Annie (Hathaway) and me. he would say 'You go to
gether like milk and water,' and I'd think what the heck
does that even mean? Milk and water don't really go
all that well together, but then again if you pour milk
into water is could kinda spread out all pretty? Is that
what he means? Who knows?
Q: Was it difficult to play such a large range of ages?
What did you do to make it clear that you were getting
older?
JG: It's somewhat subjective how much time passes
in the movie, but really we focused on making our voic
es deeper, slowing our mannerisms. There's a point in
the movie where I'm supposed to be about 40 carrying
a saddle to the truck. The first time we ran it I was all
'Errrgh' and stooped over, and some of the 40-year
olds on the set were like Hey. we're 40. not 80.'
Q: What about Oscar buzz? Do you think this film
will get some attention in that area?
AL: All I know is that Oscar buzz just means we
have to work longer promoting things and giving inter
views.
JG: When you work with Ang Lee, it's inevitable.
Q: Ang, did you ever consider hiring actual gay ac
tors to play the lead parts in this movie? Is there a rea
son you didn't?
AL: I just have to go with the best actors possible for
the roles I'm working with. I didn't even ask the people
I interviewed whether they were straight or gay. (Hirns
to Jake) I assume you're straight? Yes?
JG: That's a good supposition, Ang.
