# ‘Brokeback’ is a love story of mountainous proportions

### CAMILLE RICKETTS INTERMISSION HONORARY COWGIRL 
In every decade there comes a film that truly captures the American
experience in all its gritty, individualistic glory. In the' Bos it was "Terms of
Endearment," the '90s, "Forrest Gump." Today we're blessed with Ang
Lee's glistening "Brokeback Mountain" as our collective mirror, unique
in that it shows us both who we have been and where we are going. Far

more jarring and truthful than
any love story released in the past
several years, this quiet produc
tion packs the force necessary to
pry open closed minds in the red
dest of states.
Based on Ilie New Yorker
short story by "Shipping News"
authpr Annie ProuLx, the film be
came a source of controversy the
moment it began filming.The sto
ryline follows two sheepherders

in rural Wyoming whose friend-

ship develops into first a

giddy fling, and eventu
ally into a deep,

spiritual

love that

spans
se v
t eral

decades. It is an absolute triumph for actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyl
lenhaal who are handily rewarded for the risky choice with the most soul
ful and gut-wrenching performances of their careers. In this way,"Broke
back" finds itself in good company with "The Graduate" and"The God
father." films that have turned young men into Hollywood legends.
The film benefits immensely from its writing — the majority of the
sparse dialogue plucked directly from Proulx's pages — and Lee's direc
tion, which is both smooth and resourceful. He doesn't back down from
the more graphic sex scenes or the challenges associated with represent
ing many different time periods, starting in 1963. His connection to the
sweeping landscape alone suggests that he was born and raised in the
American heartland, not Pingtung,Taiwan.
And while the film never states its message outright — and Lee him
self will tell you that it has no social agenda — the sheer beauty of his cre
ation is enough to follow the emotional momentum to its logical conclu
sion: that powerful love in any form is something rare, and to be cherished.
It is also, for the most part, accidental, sparked suddenly between the
two leads, JEnnis del Mar (Ledger) and rodeo rider Jack TWist (Gyllen
haal), when an especially frigid night on the mountain pushes them into
the same tent.Their affection for one another is spontaneous and unthink
ing at times, and at others ravenous and addictive.Their chemistry is thick
and natural, leaving the audience with a persistent case of the butterflies.
It's generally forecasted that this movie will find a niche with straight
women and gay men. largely alienating the population that should prob
ably see it most. I beg to differ. There is plenty to be appreciated by the
straight, and dare I even say conservative, males who will inevitably be
dragged along by girlfriends or wives. Jack, and particularly Ennis, are the
same rouah and tumble variety seen in any John Wayne classic. In fact,
their hardships living off the land and fending off poverty with odd jobs
conae across as far more realistic. Lee skillfully resists endowing either of
hiSxharacters with the traits popularized by gay-friendly sitcoms, never
letting us their attraction to one another is a small sliver of who
they are as individuals.
In toasting Gyllenhaal and Ledger, it would be a mistake to overlook
the champion turns of both Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife Alma and

Anne Hathaway as Jack 's ever-blonder wife Noreen. You can't help
j| but think that a movie giving top billing to four performers in

this age group must be a brat pack flick a la "Breakfast Club"
or an extension of "LOThings I Hate About You." Which is,
of course, exactly why it is so deliciously shocking to see

them each standing on their own. fully mature (in some
case* literally playing 40-year-olds), making their previ
ous projects look like nothing more than puffy warm
ups for the real thing.

While Noreen
J embraces ignorance
of her husband's ten
dencies — indulged
during sporadic fish
ing trips with Ennis
over the duration of
his marriage — Alma

is faced with the truth a
short four years after
she weds and
s -w gives

birth to two daughters. Williams, virtually unrecognizable from her time
on "Dawson's Creek," is breathtaking to watch as she balances her mea
ger options against Ennis' crushing neglect. It wouldn't be at all surprising
if she's given a nod for best supporting actress this upcoming Oscar sea
son.
And though it's commonly understood that the only pictures to rack
up double-digits in Academy Award nominations are enterprising, big
budget spectaculars (think Peter Jackson's "King Kong"), there is no rea
son that "Brokeback" should be overlooked in any of the top categories,
not to mention in cinematography and adaptive screenwriting. I would
argue unwaveringly that this is Ang Lee's best movie thus far. trumping
his lavish "Sense and Sensibility" and chilling "Ice Storm."
Ledger and Gyllenhaal dig so deep it makes you wonder where they
have left to go. Seen already this year in "Proof' and "Jarhead," the latter
seems to exercise a whole new set of acting muscles no one knew he had.
And Ledger, shedding his Australian accent in favor of an enticing south
ern growl, succeeds wildly in a role so

completely original that he seems
to have had nothing to draw on
aside from a tremendous

amount of heart.
It's hard to imagine this

movie receiving
the reception it
deserves in places
like Crawford, Tex.,

or even the region in
which it was set. I hope, of
course, that I will be proved
wrong. But regardless of its
treatment in its broader re-

lease, I have no doubt that it will
withstand the test of time, and
that in itself makes it a promising

predictor of the national
attitude, and an ex-

tremely impor
tant submis-

sion to
American
culture.
