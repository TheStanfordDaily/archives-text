## Techie, fuzzy net Marshall Scholarships 
### NICK PARKER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Senior Philip Flip' Tanedo and Mark Otuteye,
Class of 2005, are, at least in their academic inter
ests, polar opposites. Yet they do have something in
common — both are Marshall Scholarship recipi
ents, joining Trevor Sutton and Rajaie Batniji.both
class of 2003.
Last Wednesday, The Daily profiled Sutton and
Batniji. Today,Tanedo and Otuteye are featured.
The Marshall Scholarship is an extremely presti
gious scholarship program that gives winners the
opportunity to study at any institution in the Unit
ed Kingdom for two years. Traditionally, Marshall
Scholars become leaders in their fields.
Tanedo — who earned the nickname 'Flip' in
seventh grade when a classmate called him Flip
Tomato, and the name stuck — is a double major in
physics and mathematics. He plans to spend the
first year of his Marshall Scholarship completing a
certificate of advanced studies in mathematics at
Cambridge, before doing research at the Institute
for Particle Physics Phenomenology at the Univer
sity of Durham in his second year.
Tanedo, who is from Los Angeles and is a rabid
Harry Potter fan, is a member of the Stanford
triathlon team and a leader of the Cardinal Calyp
so student group. He is also a stuffed-animal lover
who attempted to organize a campaign to rescue
the "beat-a-bears" that were distributed before Big
Game this vear.

He attributes his interest in physics to a child
hood obsession with Legos
"I'm interested in a kind of physics called
high-energy phenomenology, where we try to
build models of the behavior of elementary par
ticles that account for experimental observa
tions," Tanedo said in an interview with The
Daily. "As a child, I'd been preoccupied with a
different kind of model-building, namely playing
with Legos — and I sincerely believe that this
was a major influence for me to later become in
terested in physics."
Tanedo, who was awarded a Goldwater Scholar
ship last year for his research on the growth and
characterization of Spin Gap Dimer compounds,
hopes to grow not only academically but also cul
turally during his time in the U.K.
"I haven't spent very much time outside of Cal
ifornia, let alone the U.S., and I hope to gain per
spective in a broad and general sense," he said.
"Though some of my friends believe I'm really
going there to fall in love or, failing that, to pick up
a British accent."
Otuteye,on the other hand, is currently finishing
a master's in modern thought and literature at Stan
ford. He says that poetry has been the major inspi
ration in his life.
"Poetry is my heart," Otuteye said in an inter
view with The Daily. "I've written poems since the
second grade. I loved poetry so much that, in grade
school, I turned in poems in place of essays"
He plans to pursue a master's in literature at Ox

ford next year, and he will concentrate on spoken
word poetry, which he calls "a poetic movement
that has changed the way an entire generation
thinks about literature."
Otuteye credits Stanford's programs in African-
American Studies and Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity in shaping his intellectual inter
ests and preparing him for his upcoming study at
Oxford.
He said he hopes that his experience in the U.K.
will give him an international perspective on the
growing spoken word movement.
"Because Stanford encouraged my academic
exploration, 1 can now bring together technology
and literature to create innovative software that
helps writers create, revise and archive their work,"
he said.
Tanedo attributed some of his success to John
Pearson, the director of the Bechtel International
Center, who he said helped him focus his applica
tion.
"One of the things that makes Stanford fantastic
is how much guidance and assistance you can get
for these kind of endeavors," Tanedo said.
Pearson said in an interview with The Daily that
the Bechtel Center provides year-round informa
tion sessions, individual advising and other assis
tance for awards such as the Rhodes, Marshall and
Fulbright Scholarships. Beginning in January 2006,
weekly information sessions will be held for stu
dents interested in applying for these prestigious
awards in the fall of 2006.
