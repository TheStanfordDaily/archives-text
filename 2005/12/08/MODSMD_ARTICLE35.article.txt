## All students would need to pay for dorm lounge cable By ANDREA FULLER 
### 
Despite the seemingly overwhelm
ing enthusiasm of college students for
shows like "Six Feet Under" and
"Chappelle's Show," for students who
wish to watch cable TV in their dorm
lounges, it may come as a surprise that
every single resident must pay a fee in
order to have cable in the lounges
Information Technology Systems
and Services (ITSS) provides students

with 12 courtesy channels but not
basic cable. The University also does
not allow satellites in the residence
halls. Though dorm lounges serve as
potential locations for cable program
ming, individual students would have
to pay a cable fee for such services
"In the dorm lounges we have what
we call 'lounge service,"' said Nancy
Ware, director of planning for ITSS.
"This includes all of the courtesy chan
nels plus local channels, CNN and

Headline News. If the students in that
residence wanted the lounge TV to
have cable services like TBS, then every
student in that residence would need to
subscribe to the basic cable package."
Executive Director of ITSS Bill
Clebsch said that giving each dorm
room cable access was impractical.
"People pay on a per subscriber
basis," he said. "It has been looked at
to put cable television into the tech
nology fee, but that really drove the
price up insanely. What we're looking
at is a situation where not many peo
ple subscribe to television."
For this reason, many students said
they choose not to purchase cable.
"Unless every single room in Palo
ma, approximately 30 rooms, paid the

price of monthly cable for the year,
the dorm as a whole would have to
bear the cost of payment," said senior
Julie Lein,a resident assistant in Palo
ma. "About four dorm rooms actually
decided to pay for cable this year,
which would mean the dorm would
have to subsidize 26 cable bills. This
would completely wipe out our dorm
funds and eliminate enjoyable activi
ties like the ski trip, food at house
meetings and camping."
However, I I'SS said that it must charge
such fees to pay outside cable providers
"The reason for this policy is that
the University pays to have those chan
nels made available to it, and since
we're not for profit, we need to recover
those costs," Ware said. "The basic rate

for students is $28 a month but cable
costs in Palo Alto would be about $50."
Students felt that paying the price
for such services left them without a
real debate over whether or not dorm
lounges should subscribe to cable.
"There was no real decision not to
have cable in Paloma," Lein said.
"The decision was basically made in
advance by the sheer cost of paying
for cable. The costs just outnumber
the benefits so greatly that the idea of
paying for cable seems not only im
plausible but highly absurd."
Junior Alex Padilla agreed.
"I think it is fine without cable," he
said."Most people who really want cable
have it in their own room. It's not really
worth the cost, as most people aren't that
concerned about not having cable."
Instead of pnyingfordomicabkstudents
often find other ways to watch television.
"I usually go somewhere else if
there's something I really want to
watch." Padilla said. "People who
want to watch a specific program can
find another way â€” watching with a
friend, downloading it or going to a
sports bar. a cafe or the CoHo."
Lein agreed that other forms of en
tertainment replace cable viewing.
"Most of the residents substitute
by watching movies and DVDs, which
is commonly done in the lounge," she
said. "Plus, the people who are actual
ly willing to pay the price for lounge
cable are probably hardcore enough
not to be satisfied by having one cen
tral location with cable. They would
want to have a personal television at
their own disposal."
