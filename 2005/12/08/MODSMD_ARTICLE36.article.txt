## South Korean prime minister seeks peace through leadership 
### KELLEY FONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nearly 21K) students, faculty and
community members braved the
rain last Thursday evening to fill a
packed Bechtel Conference Center
to hear Goh Kun, the 35th prime
minister of the Republic of Korea,
who gave a lecture entitled "Beyond
Ideology and Toward Unity."
Goh lectured for about 30 min
utes on the need for effective leader
ship in Korea — emphasizing the
concept of creative pragmatism —
and then fielded questions from the
audience for the remainder of the
time.
Goh's appearance was a part of
the Asian Leaders Forum,a program
in its first year that brings leaders
from across Asia to Stanford. Ac
cording to Gi-Wook Shin, director of
the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center, which hosted the
event, the forum was launched be
cause "Asian societies are in transi
tion. If you look at Japan, China,
Korea, many countries are in transi
tion, and also, our relationship with
those Asian nations is also going
through a lot of changes. I thought it
would be important to bring leaders
from Asia and share their vision for
the future of their country and of
their own region with our students
and faculty."
Shin referred to Goh as "very in
fluential. so it is important to get his
views on Korea and the Korea-U.S.
relationship. I think he is a contender
for presidency next time. We are tar
geting those kinds of leaders."
Goh served as prime minister
from February 2(M)3 to May 2004. For
two months, beginning in March
2004, he served as acting president
when the current president Roh
Moo Hyun was impeached.
He had previously been the 30th
Prime Minister from 1997 to 1998
and has also held the positions of
mayor of the city of Seoul, minister
of Home Affairs, member of the Na
tional Assembly, minister of Agricul
ture and Marine Affairs and minister

of Transportation.
Goh drew on his extensive politi
cal experience in his lecture, which
focused on what the Korean govern
ment needs to do to find its identity
and move forward.
"I think political leadership in
Korea is not playing its proper role,"
Goh said. "The present state of af
fairs in Korea makes political leader
ship an inevitable, urgent and crucial
issue that needs to be attended to."
Goh first examined the current
state of the Korean nation, com
menting that "despair and division,
instead of hope and harmony, per
meate Korean society today."
He described the changes being
undergone by East Asia and the rest
of the world, which are "throwing
our present life into confusion while
making our future uncertain."
Such uncertain times, Goh said,
lead to risks to which Korea cannot
help being exposed.
Goh then spoke about the ideo
logical polarization of the Korean
government, which he said "should
be seen as a deadlock, not an ad
vance."
Goh remarked that a new type of
leadership is necessary, one that "de
termines social tasks and future vi
sions on the basis of historical reali
ty, not through a priori lens of ideol
ogy"
He called this concept creative
pragmatism — creative in that it
"positively opens the way to the fu
ture with vision," yet pragmatic in
that "it puts reality ahead of ideolo
gy and ideas."
Goh further described creative
pragmatism as a method to advance
"a leadership of integration that
stresses community, communication
and solidarity." He also stated that it
brings about "a liberal leadership
that is open to the global community
... It transcends the dichotomy of
independence and subordination."
Goh ended his lecture by calling
creative pragmatism "the key that
will unlock the door" to the opportu
nities hidden within the risks and
crises faced bv Korea.

Audience members then had the
opportunity to ask questions to
which Goh gave lengthy answers in
Korean, translated into English by
an interpreter.
The questions involved an assort
ment of different issues involving
Korea and its relationship with na
tions such as China, Japan and the
United States. A few questions also
centered on the relationship be
tween North and South Korea.
"The questions were various and
well-balanced," said Jin-Wok Kim, a
first-year MBA student. "They were
helpful in understanding Goh's feel
ings about various issues."
Hyun Kim, another first-year
MBA student, agreed, stating that
she "liked the Q&A better than the
speech itself."
Freshman Chang Kim called Goh
"very eloquent" and his lecture
"very informative." He added that
"Goh seemed to be very open and
tolerant to the opposition's opin
ions."
However. Kyungtae Ha, a first
year graduate student in statistics,
described the lecture as "ambigu
ous," and freshman Sinjae Kim
thought it was "really vague."
