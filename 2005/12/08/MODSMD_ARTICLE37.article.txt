## Congress proposes loan cuts 
### RONALD CHAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a bold attempt to curb the persistent soar in federal
spending under the Bush administration. Republicans in
Congress have been pushing for legislation that entails —
among other cost-cutting measures — the largest funding
reductions for student loan programs in history. If signed
into law, the proposed cuts could affect the ability of some
small lenders to stay in the student loan business and cur
tail many benefits currently available to student borrowers.
In a narrow vote of 217-215, the House of Represen
tatives approved last month a budget bill to cut funding
for the federal student loan programs by $14.3 billion.
The Senate had also passed a similar measure that pro
posed an $8.8 billion reduction.
The House and Senate are hammering out their differ
ences in a conference committee. I Tie compromise budg
et bill must then be passed by a majority of each house be
fore President George W. Bush can sign it into law.
Although the exact amount of cuts remains unclear, the
proposal will not have a significant affect on Stanford's finan
cial aid program because the University does not serve as a
lender in the Federal Stafford Loan Program — under which
the federal government offers subsidies and incentives to pri
vate lenders that grant student loans — according to Associ
ate Dean and Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
"At this point, I think the impact on students will be
minimal," Cooper said. "Changes will most likely affect
University staff and systems because there will be new in
formation and reporting requirement."
But the bill is still expected to have some influence on
the ability of students to take out and repay loans. The
majority of the cuts would come from reductions in gov
ernment subsidies to banks, credit unions and other pri
vate lending institutions that enroll in the Stafford pro
gram. The Senate bill puts some of the money saved back
into the pool of federal funds available to students as
Perkins loans, but the House version intends the $14.3

billion cuts mainly for trimming down the budget deficit.
Some of the smaller lenders. Cooper noted, may de
cide to opt out of the Stafford program as a result of the
cutback in government subsidies, thereby reducing the
number of options available to students who want to take
out loans in the future. Many of the benefits private
lenders currently offer to students — such as making the
1 percent insurance fee optional — may also be curtailed.
"The lenders on Stanford's lender list typically provide
benefits over and above the standard Stafford program
benefits for our students because they want to have you as
future customers," Cooper said. "Under the proposed leg
islation, they may no longer be able to offer those benefits."
In addition, the House bill proposes amending the fed
eral loan consolidation program, which allows students to
combine various loans taken out over the course of their
education fora fixed interest rate capped at 8.25 percent.
Under the House plan, students who want to consoli
date their loans must pay a I percent fee and choose be
tween the variable market rate and a fixed rate. The gov
ernment would set the fixed rate above the market rate
in order to hedge the risk it bears to pay for the difference
when the market rate rises.
TTie nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in
a report the House proposal would altogether create an
additional $7.8 billion of loan charges for students. A typ
ical college loan borrower is therefore expected to incur
$5,800 more in interests and fees during repayment.
On average, 35-40 percent of Stanford undergradu
ates and 20-25 percent of graduate students borrow
through the financial aid office. Of all students who re
ceived undergraduate degrees last year, 45 percent had
some debt, with their average debt totaling $15,172 ver
sus a national average of $ 17.5(H).

and numerous education and student organizations into
action.The United States Student Association, a nation
al education advocacy group, is leading a nationwide
campaign to oppose the cuts.

ernment subsidies to banks, credit unions and other pri
vate lending institutions that enroll in the Stafford pro
gram. The Senate bill puts some of the money saved back
into the pool of federal funds available to students as
Perkins loans, but the House version intends the $14.3

billion cuts mainly for trimming down the budget deficit.
Some of the smaller lenders. Cooper noted, may de
cide to opt out of the Stafford program as a result of the
cutback in government subsidies, thereby reducing the
number of options available to students who want to take
out loans in the future. Many of the benefits private
lenders currently offer to students — such as making the
1 percent insurance fee optional — may also be curtailed.
"The lenders on Stanford's lender list typically provide
benefits over and above the standard Stafford program
benefits for our students because they want to have you as
future customers," Cooper said. "Under the proposed leg
islation, they may no longer be able to offer those benefits."
In addition, the House bill proposes amending the fed
eral loan consolidation program, which allows students to
combine various loans taken out over the course of their
education fora fixed interest rate capped at 8.25 percent.
Under the House plan, students who want to consoli
date their loans must pay a I percent fee and choose be
tween the variable market rate and a fixed rate. The gov
ernment would set the fixed rate above the market rate
in order to hedge the risk it bears to pay for the difference
when the market rate rises.
TTie nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in
a report the House proposal would altogether create an
additional $7.8 billion of loan charges for students. A typ
ical college loan borrower is therefore expected to incur
$5,800 more in interests and fees during repayment.
On average, 35-40 percent of Stanford undergradu
ates and 20-25 percent of graduate students borrow
through the financial aid office. Of all students who re
ceived undergraduate degrees last year, 45 percent had
some debt, with their average debt totaling $15,172 ver
sus a national average of $ 17.5(H).
The plan before Congress has galvanized Democrats
and numerous education and student organizations into
action.The United States Student Association, a nation
al education advocacy group, is leading a nationwide
campaign to oppose the cuts.
