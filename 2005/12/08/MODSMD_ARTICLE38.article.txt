## Hospital opens child-friendly pediatric ER 
### KELLEY FONG STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday marked the opening of Stanford
Hospital's new pediatric emergency facility, which
creates a less frightening and more youth-cen
tered experience for the many children served by
the hospital's emergency department.
The facility is spacious and colorful, with art
work adorning the walls and bright lighting — a
drastic improvement from the environment previ
ously encountered by the young patients.
Bernard Dannenberg serves as the medical director
for the pediatric emergency department, a position cre
ated two years ago through a community endowment.
"The Stanford Emergency Department was
[previously] catering to both adults and children,"
Dannenberg said. "It did not and could not really
make a distinction.and the children were constant
ly mixed in with the adults."
According to Anne Trela, communications di
rector for fundraising and development at the
David and Lucile Packard Foundation, "the idea
of having a pediatric emergency room was identi
fied as something that the community wanted. The
children's hospital has a certain type of care they
provide that is very child-focused and family-fo
cused, and the desire was to bring that care to the
Emergency Department at Stanford, where our
community's children are seen."
Dannenberg agreed that the project was in large
part motivated by the community, which "said we
need to have a place that is child-friendly and pedi
atric-centered.with pediatric-trained doctors."
He called the new facility "a combined effort" be
tween Stanford University and the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital. Funds were raised through indi
vidual donations and matched by the David and Lu
cile Packard Foundation fora total of $11 million.
"Because it was so obvious what the benefit was
going to be for people, a number of our donors got
pretty excited about it and created a kind of grass
roots network."Trela said. "Throughout the course
of two to three years, we were really able to raise a
significant portion of the funding. It was a commu
nity effort — they really embraced the whole idea."
The facility features a waiting room with new toys
and activities, as well as computers and a big-screen
television. Each exam room is also equipped with a
television and iMac computer so children can enjoy
games, music.movies and free wireless Internet access.

However, Dannenberg emphasized that the
new facility is "not only entertainment."
"We have pediatric emergency medicine doc
tors, pediatric nurses and child life specialists," he
said. Such specialists "are there to explain in child
appropriate terms what is going to happen, take
away the fear factor as much as they can and assist
us when we do procedural sedation or anything
painful or scary for children."

The facility will be open 24 hours a day. I lowev
er. Dannenberg said,"we have only a few pediatric
emergency doctors, and unfortunately they're not
enough to cover this 24 hours a day."
"But all the doctors who work here are very
competent in taking care of children." Dannenberg
said. "And the nurses are just phenomenal. If you
work in a nice environment, the whole spirit comes
up. It i a difference and a better environment."
