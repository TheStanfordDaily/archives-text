# Time frozen at Intersection of Death
## Maintenance purely precautionary 
### DAVID KUO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lime stands still again at the cor
ner of Escondido and Lausen Mall.
A sign on its windows says it all â€”
"Clock under repair, will return
soon." The Stanford Tower Clock is
out of commission. The most recent
clock repair, also detailed by this re
porter, came earlier this year when
a leaky roof and unexpected flood
ing led to the precautionary freez
ing of the clock for almost two
months. Since then, the roof and
leaks have been repaired and a new
ladder and paint have been added.
Most of the clock was removed
last week, and the current repairs deal
with the clock mechanism itself.

Mechanical Engineering Prof.
David Beach, who headed up a proj
ect to refurbish the clock in the 198(js.
invited Dorian Gair, the clocksmith
that refurbished the clock before it
went in the tower, and Gibson An
derson, an associate of Dorian's, to re
visit the clock and check on its current
condition, said Karen Frey, adminis
trator of Facilities and Operations.
Notably, both Clair and Ander
son are volunteering their time to
the optimization of the clock. The
decision to remove the mechanism
for repairs came after a survey of
the clock's status.
"Dorian and Gibson decided
there were parts that needed clean
ing and parts that needed replac
ing, so along with the help of the
current clocksmith, Kevin Binkert,
they started the three to four week
project," Frey said.
Binkert. the primary caretaker of

the clock, explained that repairs are
rendered on an as-needed basis.
"These are maintenance con
cerns," Binkert said. "It wasn't like
the clock stopped working. This is
precautionary maintenance. During
cleaning or inspection, if we find a
worn part, we'll re-machine it."
Some students would be reassured
to know if the clock were running.
"Even though 1 don't use the
Tower Clock, it would be nice to
have it in the back of my mind that
it's working," said sophomore Pren
tice Miller.
"It's amazing [the clock] can last
so long considering its ticking away
24 hours a day, seven days week and
it was built in 1901" said Binkert.
He jokingly added, "It's out of its
warranty period."
The clock is expected to be up and
ticking by the beginning of winter
quarter.
