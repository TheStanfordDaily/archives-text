## Marine Lieutenant first Stanford casualty in Iraq Chemistry student had boyhood dreams of service 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Donald Ryan McGlothlin had a full
scholarship to Stanford's doctoral chem
istry program and was well on the fast
track to a career in chemistry, when he de
cided to settle fora .master's and leave the
lab to pursue his boyhood dream of be
coming a marine.
"He came home from Stanford once,
and when I asked him how he was he said,
'I want to do something else. I want to feel
like I'm serving my country. I want to pro
tect our lands from terrorists," his father,

Donald McGlothlin said. That is when
McGlothlin told his father he had joined
the Marines.
On Nov. 16, a little less than two years
later, his parents opened the door to an
other Marine standing outside their Vir
ginia home, who informed them that, the
26-year-old McGlothlin, a Marine 2nd
Lieutenant, had been killed during a fire
fight in Ãœbaydi, Iraq. His unit was part of
Operation Steel, a major offensive aimed
at insurgents near the Syrian border. Mc-
Glothlin is believed to be the first Stanford
student killed in the war in Iraq.
Despite his academic success, his deci
sion to join the military was not surprising
to those who knew him.
Ryan's interest in the military began at
a young age. While pursuing his under

graduate degree in chemistry at William
and Mary, he joined the Army Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps (ROTC) and was
awarded a three-year tuition scholarship
but was subsequently disqualified due to a
childhood respiratory problem.
McGlothlin then joined the Marine of
ficers program, where he was known for

his professionalism, his father said.
At Stanford, he will be remem
bered as exceptionally bright and fo
cused in the classroom and a wise
cracker after hours. McGlothlin re
searched the stabilization of persist
ent organic contaminants in marine
sediments with chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare and had made signifi
cant progress towards a doctorate in
chemistry when he decided that he
was needed elsewhere.
McGlothlin was also well-liked
among his peers.
"He was very easy to talk to and
genuinely cared about what was
going on with you," said McGlothlin's
friend Marion Martin, a graduate stu
dent in chemistry. "We spent a lot
time together, whether it was work
ing on problem sets, being TAs for
Chem 31.There was many a Saturday
when we would sit in his apartment
and watch college football from 9
a.m. to 10 p.m.; we joked that it was
one of the few benefits of living on
the West Coast."
His father recounted a conversa
tion with his son.
"Dad, I've been privileged, much
more so than most Americans," Mc-
Glothlin senior recalls his son saying.
"Why should people who aren't as

privileged have to hear all the brunt
of defending our nation?"
The poem found in McGlothlin's
wallet,"Don't Quit" by Edgar Guest,
was a favorite of his that he read dur
ing his valedictorian speech at
Lebanon High School.
"The poem captures [McGloth
lin's] personality well," Zare said.
In his home town of Lebanon, Vir
ginia flags are being flow at half-mast,
and the former varsity football play
er's number has been retired. At a
ceremony preceding his funeral, his
mother, Ruth McGlothlin, and his fa
ther pinned the sliver bars of a first
lieutenant on their son's uniform.
McGlothlin was posthumously pro
moted to first lieutenant on Nov. 25.
The family request that, in lieu of
flowers, contributions be made to the
Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund or to
a scholarship fund established in Mc-
Glothlin's memory at his former high
school.
"I think it is important to know
that Ryan was doing exactly what he
wanted to do," Martin said. "He had
an excitement when he talked about
being a Marine that wasn't necessari
ly there while he was at Stanford."
