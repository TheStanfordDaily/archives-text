# GRADUATE STUDENT COUNCIL
## Etchemendy fields concerns 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE STAFF WRITER 
At last night's special joint meet
ing between the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), University Provost
John Etchemendy heard student con
cerns about the possibility of an im
pending strike of University workers,
which could take place as soon as
Monday. Also at the meeting —
which happens only once a year —
the provost discussed a wide range of
other issues, including faculty diversi
ty, the Munger housing project and
graduate concerns over the cancella
tion of the Caltrain GO Pass.
University officials and represen
tatives of the United Stanford Work
ers are still in negotiations and have a
final meeting scheduled for today.
The results of this meeting will likely
determine whether next week's Uni
versity workers' strike will take place.
This strike is separate from the hospi
tal employees' strike, which is sched
uled to take place Monday,
Etchemendy said.
"We expect the University em
ployees to go on strike on Monday as
well or maybe have a sick-out,"
Etchemendy told the group. "We're
not sure and probably won't know
until Monday morning."
Undergraduate Senate Chair
Chris Nguyen, a junior, asked
Etchemendy what plans the Univer
sity has to prepare for the strike, in
case it does take place.
"While we all hope the University
and the union will be able to come to

an amiable resolution, what plans
does the University have in place in
order to ensure that student services
are able to continue during the
strike?" Nguyen asked. "Especially
since the strike is threatening to
occur during Finals Week."
Etchemendy proceeded to pro
vide Nguyen and the group with a
lengthy response about what the
University has planned in case a Uni
versity workers' strike does occur.
" The main effect for students will
be with the residence and dining en
terprise employees," he said. "We've
arranged to continue to serve food,
but we'll probably limit that to four
dining halls — Wilbur, FloMo, Lagu
nita and Manzanita.with the addition
of Tresidder and Lynx."
Etchemendy added that the din
ing halls that are open will offer ex
tended hours to accommodate for
longer lines and that there will still be
plenty of food to go around.
"We have enough food available
for days," he said. "It will be a hassle,
but there will be food."
Etchemendy also addressed
maintenance and transportation is
sues which students could also be
faced with come Monday.
"The maintenance will be done on
an as-needed emergency basis," he
said. "The Marguerite drivers are
unionized [but not apart of the same
union in negotiations] and probably
will not cross the picket line, so we
may need to adjust the routes."
He added that the University will
try to ensure that the buses continue
to run. but said thev mav run on un

usual routes.
GSC co-chair Tom Lee, a fourth
year electrical-engineering graduate
student, said that the issues being
ironed out between the University
and the unions are very difficult and
complex, but he said he hopes they
don't interfere too much with student
work during finals week,
"This issue came on fairly quickly,
so responding has been difficult." Lee
said.'i think our main concern is that
students are still able to function in
their studies."
He went on to say that the im
pending strike is complicated by
other issues, but throughout the
process the GSC is looking out for
the best interests of students.
"Certainly, there are other moral
and ethical issues that people want to
take positions on," he said. "But our
main concern as the GSC is to make
sure people can learn."
ASSU President Melanie Kan
nokada, a senior, echoed Lee's con
cerns and added that dining services
will be another area of concern for
students.
"I think our primary concern is
dining." she said. "That's one of the
biggest issues that we hear feedback
on from the students. It's comforting
to hear that the University has a
back-up plan."
Also at the meeting, the new
ASSU Elections Commissioner, sec
ond-year law student Tim Sanders,
was confirmed by a joint vote of the
Senate and the GSC. Additionally
three Nomination Commission ap
pointees were confirmed.
