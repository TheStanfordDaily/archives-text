### ALLISON DEDRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mary and Joseph finally found a
safe haven to give birth to baby Jesus
at El Centro Chicano on Saturday,
Dec. 3, after stopping at Ujamaa,
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Okada and
Casa Zapata earlier in the evening.
The procession was part of El Centro
Chicano's annual Posadas celebra
tion, which culminated in a party at
the ballroom in the Old Union.
Posadas is a Mexican tradition that
commemorates the journey Mary and
Joseph took in search of shelter be
fore the birth of Jesus. Annual
Posadas celebrations have been ob
served at Stanford for about 16 years
and are currently one of the main an
nual events organized by El Centro
Chicano,
The celebration began at Old
Union, where students congregated
and dressed as shepherds, dancers,
Mary and Joseph.The procession then
traveled to the ethnic theme dorms on
campus, ending up at Old Union
again. The participants carried can
dles and sang carols along the way. At
each house, the wanderers sang a song
asking if there was room for Mary and
Joseph to stay, and the dorm members
sang back, saying there was not. until
the procession reached El Centro
Chicano, where they were finally
granted permission to stay.
According to senior Rocio Carde
nas, a program coordinator at El Cen
tro Chicano who helped organize the
event,"participation is open to every
one," and the crowd was representa-

tive of the whole Stanford community
and the larger Bay Area.
Julie Nicholson, a Bay Area resi
dent, participated for the first time this
year, having wanted to since she
adopted her two youngest daughters
from Guatemala a couple of years
ago. She is part of a community of Bay
Area families who have adopted chil
dren from Guatemala and said the
group tries to get together and con
nect for cultural events. Nicholson
said she and her daughters "plan to
come again" and"this is the beginning
of a tradition."
Joseph was played by David
Miller, a freshman living in Casa Zap
ata. He said they talked about the
Posadas tradition in the dorm and also
practiced the traditional songs to pre
pare for the event.
After the procession, there was a
party with Salvadorian food, a skit
about the birth of Jesus — a Pastorele
— and performances by the Ballet
Folklorico de Stanford and a Puerto
Rican Band. Director of El Centro
Chicano Frances Morales said that
the Posadas celebrations are "one of
the signature cultural events that peo
ple remember" and pointed out the
numerous alumni and their children
attending the celebrations.
Sophomores Brenda Barajas and
Eutimia Montoya danced through
out the procession, performing a tra
ditional Mexica dance — Mexica is
the name of the Aztecs who lived in
Mexico before the Spanish con
quered the area.
Barajas said the celebration here is
different from those she participated

in back home in Anaheim. Calif.
"Generally you go to nine houses,
each one representing either nine
months of pregnancy or the nine days
it took to journey from Bethlehem to
Nazareth to have Jesus," she said.
"Usually Posadas last for nine days."
Barajas explained that the Posadas
tradition differs, depending on the
community.
"Here it's different because it's a
bunch of students. A lot of us are first
generation or second-generation, so
it's not exactly how you do it in Mexi
co," she said. "And I think even re
gionally it differs in Mexico. The
essence of it is still the same."
Sophomore Nydia Cardenas, who
sat on the planning committee for her
second year, said she thinks the cele
bration is "really important." adding
that she participates in Posadas in
Mexico with her family when she goes
back each Christmas.
"1 feel like a lot of times people
who move to the US. don't have the
same opportunity to hold the tradi
tion, so it's really nice to see the fami
lies come out with their kids and be
able to enjoy a tradition they did when
they were younger." she said.
Morales said the celebration hasn't
changed significantly in her 16 years
as director of El Centro Chicano. but
that it is changing slightly in response
to the increasing diversity in the Lati
no community, noting the Salvadorian
food and Puerto Rican band.
"Posadas is very much a communi
ty affair for the Stanford community
and the outside community," Morales
said.
