### JENNY BAER STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate convened Tues
day night to discuss issues involving residential housing
improvements and a possible labor strike in the future.
They also approved funding for various student groups
including Women's Club Soccer.
The Stanford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC) noti
fied the Senate of the possibility of a University and
hospital worker's strike, in hopes of passing a resolution
in favor of the workers. According to SLAC, hospital
workers may strike over several issues including safe
staffing and job security, while other University em
ployees demand better retirement benefits. However,
according to Senator Hershey Avula, a sophomore, the
Senate was not able to formulate a bill on the issue due

to time constraints.
"According to SLAC, around SO percent of the hos
pital workers authorized the strike and about 90 per
cent of the groundskeepers authorized the strike," said
Senator Andrew Hendel. a senior. "However, just be
cause a strike is authorized doesn't mean it will actual
ly happen."
The Capital Improvement Program has about three
years remaining in its installation of the "proxy system"
in all residential housing. This system would allow stu
dents to swipe their Stanford University Identification
Card to enter their housing instead of using keys.
The senate passed bills granting funds to organiza
tions including Stanford Women's Club Soccer, the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle East, the Stanford
Outdoor Outreach Program, Habla La Noche, the
Black Psychology Student Association, Alpha Kappa
Alpha Sorority and Flamenco Cardenal. Senator and
Appropriations Committee Chair. Faris Mohiuddin. a
junior.said that the senate is currently conducting more
research on the actual costs of student groups.
