## CAMPUS LIFE Administration reconsiders ceremony site Students protested original decision to use Frost Amphitheater 
### NICK PARKER SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
In response to intense student protest over the deci
sion to use Frost Amphitheater as the site for this year's
Commencement ceremonies, University administrators
announced Wednesday that they would reconsider that
decision.
In an open letter to graduating students and their par
ents, University President John Hennessy explained that
administrators will now consider Roble Field and the
football practice field, located behind Maples Pavilion, in
addition to Frost Amphitheater as potential sites for this
year's graduation festivities.
On Sunday, University officials announced that they
had chosen the 9,000-seat Frost — which has been the
site of graduation ceremonies in the past — as the re
placement site for the 85,000-seat Stanford Stadium,
which will be undergoing major renovations at the time
of Commencement.
Almost immediately, members of the class of 2006
began to protest the decision, generating at least two on
line petitions — one for faculty and students and anoth
er for parents. The graduates' main concern was the lim
ited seating capacity in the amphitheater.
"Everyone that I know sent some form of letter ac
knowledging their dislike of the choice to use Frost Am
phitheater for Commencement," said senior Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, former ASSU President.
The administration responded swiftly to the rapid
number of complaints they received regarding the deci
sion.
"Based on the feedback of those people who contact
ed us in the last few days, the most important criterion for
a Commencement site for many students is the ability to
accommodate the maximum number of guests," Hen
nessy's letter stated. "For that reason, we have decided to
reconsider the decision."
An e-mail was sent by the senior class presidents out
lining to their peers the new options for commencement

location and urged seniors to respond with their prefer
ences.
Additionally, they discussed a system that is in the
works to help accommodate everyone's attendance
needs.
"Regardless of the ultimate decision, the administra
tion has agreed to work with us to set up a ticket ex
change system so that students who have excess tickets
can redistribute them to students in need of additional

tickets stated the senior class presidents in the e-mail.
Some students, such as senior Rosemary Ndubuizu,
who created one of the online petitions, said they were
deeply upset hy the University's first decision.
"Honestly, I find the administration's decision to ini
tially disregard or greatly minimize the senior class' input
on this important issue as disrespectful and insulting,"
Ndubuizu said in an e-mail to the Daily. "We, as students,
are important stakeholders in this institution and to be ig

nored or dismissed during this decision-making process
is appalling."
When Commencement was held in Stanford Stadium,
graduating students were encouraged to invite as many
guests as they wanted, but only four guests per graduate
will be allowed if the ceremonies are held at Frost. In ad
dition, undergraduate and graduate ceremonies would
