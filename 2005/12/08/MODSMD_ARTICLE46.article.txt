## CAMPUS LIFE Administration reconsiders ceremony site Students protested original decision to use Frost Amphitheater 
### NICK PARKER SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
In response to intense student protest over the deci
sion to use Frost Amphitheater as the site for this year's
Commencement ceremonies, University administrators
announced Wednesday that they would reconsider that
decision.
In an open letter to graduating students and their par
ents, University President John Hennessy explained that
administrators will now consider Roble Field and the
football practice field, located behind Maples Pavilion, in
addition to Frost Amphitheater as potential sites for this
year's graduation festivities.
On Sunday, University officials announced that they
had chosen the 9,000-seat Frost — which has been the
site of graduation ceremonies in the past — as the re
placement site for the 85,000-seat Stanford Stadium,
which will be undergoing major renovations at the time
of Commencement.
Almost immediately, members of the class of 2006
began to protest the decision, generating at least two on
line petitions — one for faculty and students and anoth
er for parents. The graduates' main concern was the lim
ited seating capacity in the amphitheater.
"Everyone that I know sent some form of letter ac
knowledging their dislike of the choice to use Frost Am
phitheater for Commencement," said senior Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, former ASSU President.
The administration responded swiftly to the rapid
number of complaints they received regarding the deci
sion.
"Based on the feedback of those people who contact
ed us in the last few days, the most important criterion for
a Commencement site for many students is the ability to
accommodate the maximum number of guests," Hen
nessy's letter stated. "For that reason, we have decided to
reconsider the decision."
An e-mail was sent by the senior class presidents out
lining to their peers the new options for commencement

location and urged seniors to respond with their prefer
ences.
Additionally, they discussed a system that is in the
works to help accommodate everyone's attendance
needs.
"Regardless of the ultimate decision, the administra
tion has agreed to work with us to set up a ticket ex
change system so that students who have excess tickets
can redistribute them to students in need of additional

tickets stated the senior class presidents in the e-mail.
Some students, such as senior Rosemary Ndubuizu,
who created one of the online petitions, said they were
deeply upset hy the University's first decision.
"Honestly, I find the administration's decision to ini
tially disregard or greatly minimize the senior class' input
on this important issue as disrespectful and insulting,"
Ndubuizu said in an e-mail to the Daily. "We, as students,
are important stakeholders in this institution and to be ig

nored or dismissed during this decision-making process
is appalling."
When Commencement was held in Stanford Stadium,
graduating students were encouraged to invite as many
guests as they wanted, but only four guests per graduate
will be allowed if the ceremonies are held at Frost. In ad
dition, undergraduate and graduate ceremonies would

be held on different days with differ
ent speakers.
"I was very shocked to hear that«,
each one of us could only bring four
guests," said senior Jennifer Lee. "1
know many seniors had wanted to
invite friends as well as family, which
is almost impossible to do with only
four tickets. For myself, as well as
others, four tickets is not even
enough for my immediate family to
attend together, which made me
very disappointed."
There would also be restrictions
placed on the number of guests at
the other two locations the adminis
tration is now considering. If the cer
emonies are held at Roble Field,
graduates could invite seven guests,
while they could bring nine guests to
the football practice field.
"I am pleased that these adminis
trators are now taking the time to lis
ten to our suggestions even though it
is within a narrow set of options,"
Ndubuizu said. "However, it is my
hope that the administrators do not
commit the same mistake they have
done in the past and listen to our rec
ommendations only to dismiss them
and impose their own opinion with
out reasonable justification [e.g. cost
effectiveness]."
"Ideally, I would support a site
that holds the traditional number of
50 guests, so that Stanford demon
strates even with changes in Com
mencement venue, it financially sup
ports this event to the point where
precedent is not frivolously
trumped," she added.
However, Jeff Wachtel, senior as
sistant to Hennessy, stated that price
was not the primary issue in the ad
ministration's initial choice of hold
ing Commencement at Frost Am
phitheater.
"Cost is a secondary factor and
continues to be one but did not drive
the initial decision nor does it drive
the decision now," Wachtel said."We
spend several hundred thousand
dollars on Commencement each
year, but that doesn't take into ac
count staff time, overhead costs, etc.
Again, cost is not influencing our de
cision."
At both Roble Field and the
football practice field, the ceremo
ny would be held on a raised stage
and seating would be in the form of

folding chairs. In addition, two Jum
botron-style screens would be set
up to enhance viewing. In both
cases, alternate indoor seating
would be available at a nearby loca
tion where the ceremonies would
be telecast.
"I think it's a good idea, either to
accommodate the guests who don't
have tickets into the actual location
or for those who prefer indoor and
cooler seating, such as the elderly
and young children," Lee said.
Most students said they would
like Commencement at the football
practice field because it provides the
most space.
"I'm in support of the football
practice stadium because it accom
modates the largest attendance for
the graduating class," Borgelt-Mose
said.
Ndubuizu agreed.
"My choice would be the football
field because it holds the highest
number of guests and most closely
resembles Stanford's traditional lo
cation," she said.
A major concern for University
officials is the amount of nearby
parking available for ceremony at
tendees. Traditionally, when gradua
tion was held at Stanford Stadium,
guests were able to park in the stadi
um parking lots; however, while the
stadium lots could be used for the
Frost Amphitheater and football
practice field sites, the Roble Field
site has limited parking nearby and
would thus require a walk of up to
one-half mile for many guests.
"No matter what the final deci
sion is, there will always be some
people who are unhappy with it,"
Lee said."However, I think it's great
that the University is working with
the senior class to consider other
possible solutions for the Com
mencement venue in an attempt to
make graduation run smoothly this
year. I also think it is important to re
member that there are issues the ad
ministration might have to take into
consideration that we are not aware
of, and we should try to keep open
minds."
Borgelt-Mose also emphasized
the importance of cooperation be
tween the administration and the
student body.
"It's a great example of how we
can effect change even on a small
level and why student input is need
ed early on," Borgelt-Mose said.
"The administration was able to rec
ognize the issues the students had
and address them."

graduating students were encouraged to invite as many
guests as they wanted, but only four guests per graduate

be held on different days with differ
ent speakers.
"I was very shocked to hear that«,
each one of us could only bring four
guests," said senior Jennifer Lee. "1
know many seniors had wanted to
invite friends as well as family, which
is almost impossible to do with only
four tickets. For myself, as well as
others, four tickets is not even
enough for my immediate family to
attend together, which made me
very disappointed."
There would also be restrictions
placed on the number of guests at
the other two locations the adminis
tration is now considering. If the cer
emonies are held at Roble Field,
graduates could invite seven guests,
while they could bring nine guests to
the football practice field.
"I am pleased that these adminis
trators are now taking the time to lis
ten to our suggestions even though it
is within a narrow set of options,"
Ndubuizu said. "However, it is my
hope that the administrators do not
commit the same mistake they have
done in the past and listen to our rec
ommendations only to dismiss them
and impose their own opinion with
out reasonable justification [e.g. cost
effectiveness]."
"Ideally, I would support a site
that holds the traditional number of
50 guests, so that Stanford demon
strates even with changes in Com
mencement venue, it financially sup
ports this event to the point where
precedent is not frivolously
trumped," she added.
However, Jeff Wachtel, senior as
sistant to Hennessy, stated that price
was not the primary issue in the ad
ministration's initial choice of hold
ing Commencement at Frost Am
phitheater.
"Cost is a secondary factor and
continues to be one but did not drive
the initial decision nor does it drive
the decision now," Wachtel said."We
spend several hundred thousand
dollars on Commencement each
year, but that doesn't take into ac
count staff time, overhead costs, etc.
Again, cost is not influencing our de
cision."
At both Roble Field and the
football practice field, the ceremo
ny would be held on a raised stage
and seating would be in the form of

folding chairs. In addition, two Jum
botron-style screens would be set
up to enhance viewing. In both
cases, alternate indoor seating
would be available at a nearby loca
tion where the ceremonies would
be telecast.
"I think it's a good idea, either to
accommodate the guests who don't
have tickets into the actual location
or for those who prefer indoor and
cooler seating, such as the elderly
and young children," Lee said.
Most students said they would
like Commencement at the football
practice field because it provides the
most space.
"I'm in support of the football
practice stadium because it accom
modates the largest attendance for
the graduating class," Borgelt-Mose
said.
Ndubuizu agreed.
"My choice would be the football
field because it holds the highest
number of guests and most closely
resembles Stanford's traditional lo
cation," she said.
A major concern for University
officials is the amount of nearby
parking available for ceremony at
tendees. Traditionally, when gradua
tion was held at Stanford Stadium,
guests were able to park in the stadi
um parking lots; however, while the
stadium lots could be used for the
Frost Amphitheater and football
practice field sites, the Roble Field
site has limited parking nearby and
would thus require a walk of up to
one-half mile for many guests.
"No matter what the final deci
sion is, there will always be some
people who are unhappy with it,"
Lee said."However, I think it's great
that the University is working with
the senior class to consider other
possible solutions for the Com
mencement venue in an attempt to
make graduation run smoothly this
year. I also think it is important to re
member that there are issues the ad
ministration might have to take into
consideration that we are not aware
of, and we should try to keep open
minds."
Borgelt-Mose also emphasized
the importance of cooperation be
tween the administration and the
student body.
"It's a great example of how we
can effect change even on a small
level and why student input is need
ed early on," Borgelt-Mose said.
"The administration was able to rec
ognize the issues the students had
and address them."
In response to intense student protest over the deci
sion to use Frost Amphitheater as the site for this year's
Commencement ceremonies, University administrators
announced Wednesday that they would reconsider that
decision.
In an open letter to graduating students and their par
ents, University President John Hennessy explained that
administrators will now consider Roble Field and the
football practice field, located behind Maples Pavilion, in
addition to Frost Amphitheater as potential sites for this
year's graduation festivities.
On Sunday, University officials announced that they
had chosen the 9,000-seat Frost — which has been the
site of graduation ceremonies in the past — as the re
placement site for the 85,000-seat Stanford Stadium,
which will be undergoing major renovations at the time
of Commencement.
Almost immediately, members of the class of 2006
began to protest the decision, generating at least two on
line petitions — one for faculty and students and anoth
er for parents. The graduates' main concern was the lim
ited seating capacity in the amphitheater.
"Everyone that I know sent some form of letter ac
knowledging their dislike of the choice to use Frost Am
phitheater for Commencement," said senior Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, former ASSU President.
The administration responded swiftly to the rapid
number of complaints they received regarding the deci
sion.
"Based on the feedback of those people who contact
ed us in the last few days, the most important criterion for
a Commencement site for many students is the ability to
accommodate the maximum number of guests," Hen
nessy's letter stated. "For that reason, we have decided to
reconsider the decision."
An e-mail was sent by the senior class presidents out
lining to their peers the new options for commencement

location and urged seniors to respond with their prefer
ences.
Additionally, they discussed a system that is in the
works to help accommodate everyone's attendance
needs.
"Regardless of the ultimate decision, the administra
tion has agreed to work with us to set up a ticket ex
change system so that students who have excess tickets
can redistribute them to students in need of additional

tickets stated the senior class presidents in the e-mail.
Some students, such as senior Rosemary Ndubuizu,
who created one of the online petitions, said they were
deeply upset hy the University's first decision.
"Honestly, I find the administration's decision to ini
tially disregard or greatly minimize the senior class' input
on this important issue as disrespectful and insulting,"
Ndubuizu said in an e-mail to the Daily. "We, as students,
are important stakeholders in this institution and to be ig

football practice field, the ceremo
ny would be held on a raised stage
and seating would be in the form of

folding chairs. In addition, two Jum
botron-style screens would be set
up to enhance viewing. In both
cases, alternate indoor seating
would be available at a nearby loca
tion where the ceremonies would
be telecast.
"I think it's a good idea, either to
accommodate the guests who don't
have tickets into the actual location
or for those who prefer indoor and
cooler seating, such as the elderly
and young children," Lee said.
Most students said they would
like Commencement at the football
practice field because it provides the
most space.
"I'm in support of the football
practice stadium because it accom
modates the largest attendance for
the graduating class," Borgelt-Mose
said.
Ndubuizu agreed.
"My choice would be the football
field because it holds the highest
number of guests and most closely
resembles Stanford's traditional lo
cation," she said.
A major concern for University
officials is the amount of nearby
parking available for ceremony at
tendees. Traditionally, when gradua
tion was held at Stanford Stadium,
guests were able to park in the stadi
um parking lots; however, while the
stadium lots could be used for the
Frost Amphitheater and football
practice field sites, the Roble Field
site has limited parking nearby and
would thus require a walk of up to
one-half mile for many guests.
"No matter what the final deci
sion is, there will always be some
people who are unhappy with it,"
Lee said."However, I think it's great
that the University is working with
the senior class to consider other
possible solutions for the Com
mencement venue in an attempt to
make graduation run smoothly this
year. I also think it is important to re
member that there are issues the ad
ministration might have to take into
consideration that we are not aware
of, and we should try to keep open
minds."
Borgelt-Mose also emphasized
the importance of cooperation be
tween the administration and the
student body.
"It's a great example of how we
can effect change even on a small
level and why student input is need
ed early on," Borgelt-Mose said.
"The administration was able to rec
ognize the issues the students had
and address them."
