## Students from Gulf Coast react to Katrina Devastation hits close to home for some coming back to Stanford 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A number of Stanford students and faculty will begin
their school year with more than academic stress on their
minds. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, many are more
concerned with the safety of their friends and family, and
what lies ahead after so much has been destroyed.
"It's hard to describe it," said junior Brice Rolston, one
of the many Stanford students directly affected by the
storm.
Rolston lives in Mandeville, La., a town on the North
Shore of Lake Pontchartrain across from New Orleans,
but was at Stanford when the hurricane hit. Unable to
communicate with his family, he immediately booked a
flight to Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital, where he was
able to communicate with his family.
Rolston spent the next week doing anything that he
could to help out spending time to search for supplies.
"It was a total madhouse;you could not even get drink
ing water," he said. "You take advantage of all the mod
ern conveniences until you live without them fora few
days."
Rolston's family was lucky. Though half the houses in
his neighborhood had trees that had fallen through their
roofs, Rolston's house suffered no serious damage.
There were downed power lines in the road, trees that
had uprooted and taken neighbors' lawns with them, and
very little water pressure. Because Rolston's home was
above sea level, there was little flood damage. Nearby
homes located on Lake Pontchartrain, however, were
simply pushed over by the water, the walls parallel to the
lakefront collapsing.
Early on, several houses in the neighborhood were

looted. Rolston's family and the neighbors quickly set up
their own security detail and patrolled the neighborhood
with firearms. More than anything else, it was a tactic in
tended to scare looters away and the looting stopped after
a few days.
For the week that Rolston was in Louisiana, he and his
neighbors were constantly doing whatever they could to
better the situation.
"In our community, the hurricane really brought us all
together." he said. "The bleak picture you see in New Or
leans was somewhat countered by the people on the
North Shore."
Junior Julia Saladino had a somewhat different experi

ence. Because her mother was used to New Orleans' an
nual hurricane warnings, she initially did not want to leave
the city.
At 2 a.m. on the Saturday night before the storm, Sal
adino's brother woke her up and made her watch the
news. When they saw the hurricane's destructive poten
tial. Saladino's family immediately began packing and
drove into Texas.
Shifting between the houses of several different fami
ly members, Saladino had to return to Stanford early for
medical reasons since she could not see her doctor in New
