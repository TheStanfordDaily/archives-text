## Students from Gulf Coast react to Katrina Devastation hits close to home for some coming back to Stanford 
### BOB BOREK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A number of Stanford students and faculty will begin
their school year with more than academic stress on their
minds. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, many are more
concerned with the safety of their friends and family, and
what lies ahead after so much has been destroyed.
"It's hard to describe it," said junior Brice Rolston, one
of the many Stanford students directly affected by the
storm.
Rolston lives in Mandeville, La., a town on the North
Shore of Lake Pontchartrain across from New Orleans,
but was at Stanford when the hurricane hit. Unable to
communicate with his family, he immediately booked a
flight to Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital, where he was
able to communicate with his family.
Rolston spent the next week doing anything that he
could to help out spending time to search for supplies.
"It was a total madhouse;you could not even get drink
ing water," he said. "You take advantage of all the mod
ern conveniences until you live without them fora few
days."
Rolston's family was lucky. Though half the houses in
his neighborhood had trees that had fallen through their
roofs, Rolston's house suffered no serious damage.
There were downed power lines in the road, trees that
had uprooted and taken neighbors' lawns with them, and
very little water pressure. Because Rolston's home was
above sea level, there was little flood damage. Nearby
homes located on Lake Pontchartrain, however, were
simply pushed over by the water, the walls parallel to the
lakefront collapsing.
Early on, several houses in the neighborhood were

looted. Rolston's family and the neighbors quickly set up
their own security detail and patrolled the neighborhood
with firearms. More than anything else, it was a tactic in
tended to scare looters away and the looting stopped after
a few days.
For the week that Rolston was in Louisiana, he and his
neighbors were constantly doing whatever they could to
better the situation.
"In our community, the hurricane really brought us all
together." he said. "The bleak picture you see in New Or
leans was somewhat countered by the people on the
North Shore."
Junior Julia Saladino had a somewhat different experi

ence. Because her mother was used to New Orleans' an
nual hurricane warnings, she initially did not want to leave
the city.
At 2 a.m. on the Saturday night before the storm, Sal
adino's brother woke her up and made her watch the
news. When they saw the hurricane's destructive poten
tial. Saladino's family immediately began packing and
drove into Texas.
Shifting between the houses of several different fami
ly members, Saladino had to return to Stanford early for
medical reasons since she could not see her doctor in New

Orleans. Her family is staying in Texas
indefinitely.
Because Saladino's home is above
sea level, it suffered little damage.
"We are certainly one of the fami
lies that were very lucky," she said. "I
know so many people who lost every
thing in that storm and I can't imagine
how that must feel."
Freshman Sarah Woodward and
her family may not have been as for
tunate. They were at their vacation
home when the hurricane hit, and still
do not know if their house weathered
the storm.
"The hurricane completely trans
formed the area that 1 was in," Wood
ward said. "It was not even recogniza

ble."
She said that everyone in the
neighborhood was extremely sup
portive. They had no running water,
electricity or air-conditioning after
the hurricane, but three different peo
ple came with truckloads of supplies
for them and their neighbors, two of
whom were strangers.
Woodward said that being with her
family immediately after the storm
struck helped. She talked to some of
her friends who had already left for
college when the hurricane hit, but it
was difficult to speak with them be
cause everyone was already caught up
in college life.
"It's hard not being able to go back
even at Thanksgiving," she said. "A lot
of my friends are not even coming
back. I may not even see some of them
again."
Junior Zataia Richburg, who
evacuated to Montgomery, Ala. be

fore the storm hit said that it helps to
try to go from day to day as normal
ly as possible. She and her family are
now in Cincinnati, Ohio, where they
have been reading books, watching
movies and talking to friends.
"I always knew my family was im
portant," Richburgsaid."! was always
wondering about [the] hurricane sea
son before I left for school, what
would happen if the big one hit. I'd
rather be here with my parents and
know that they're safe."
Originally from Louisiana, Jan
Barker Alexander, assistant dean of
students and director of the Black
Community Services Center, has col

When asked about the hurricane, she
quickly rattled off the names of a
number of people she knew here at
Stanford who were affected in one
way or another.
"The stories are endless," she said.

very little water pressure. Because Rolston's home was
above sea level, there was little flood damage. Nearby
homes located on Lake Pontchartrain, however, were
simply pushed over by the water, the walls parallel to the
lakefront collapsing.
Early on, several houses in the neighborhood were

looted. Rolston's family and the neighbors quickly set up
their own security detail and patrolled the neighborhood
with firearms. More than anything else, it was a tactic in
tended to scare looters away and the looting stopped after
a few days.
For the week that Rolston was in Louisiana, he and his
neighbors were constantly doing whatever they could to
better the situation.
"In our community, the hurricane really brought us all
together." he said. "The bleak picture you see in New Or

North Shore."

"We are certainly one of the fami

know so many people who lost every
thing in that storm and I can't imagine
how that must feel."
Freshman Sarah Woodward and
her family may not have been as for
tunate. They were at their vacation
home when the hurricane hit, and still
do not know if their house weathered
the storm.
"The hurricane completely trans
formed the area that 1 was in," Wood
ward said. "It was not even recogniza

ble."
She said that everyone in the
neighborhood was extremely sup
portive. They had no running water,
electricity or air-conditioning after
the hurricane, but three different peo
ple came with truckloads of supplies
for them and their neighbors, two of
whom were strangers.
Woodward said that being with her
family immediately after the storm
struck helped. She talked to some of
her friends who had already left for
college when the hurricane hit, but it
was difficult to speak with them be
cause everyone was already caught up
in college life.
"It's hard not being able to go back
even at Thanksgiving," she said. "A lot
of my friends are not even coming
back. I may not even see some of them
again."
Junior Zataia Richburg, who
evacuated to Montgomery, Ala. be

fore the storm hit said that it helps to
try to go from day to day as normal
ly as possible. She and her family are
now in Cincinnati, Ohio, where they
have been reading books, watching
movies and talking to friends.

would happen if the big one hit. I'd

Originally from Louisiana, Jan
Barker Alexander, assistant dean of
students and director of the Black
Community Services Center, has col

When asked about the hurricane, she
quickly rattled off the names of a
number of people she knew here at
Stanford who were affected in one
way or another.
"The stories are endless," she said.
A number of Stanford students and faculty will begin
their school year with more than academic stress on their
minds. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, many are more
concerned with the safety of their friends and family, and
what lies ahead after so much has been destroyed.
"It's hard to describe it," said junior Brice Rolston, one
of the many Stanford students directly affected by the
storm.
Rolston lives in Mandeville, La., a town on the North
Shore of Lake Pontchartrain across from New Orleans,
but was at Stanford when the hurricane hit. Unable to
communicate with his family, he immediately booked a
flight to Baton Rouge, Louisiana's capital, where he was
able to communicate with his family.
Rolston spent the next week doing anything that he
could to help out spending time to search for supplies.
"It was a total madhouse;you could not even get drink
ing water," he said. "You take advantage of all the mod
ern conveniences until you live without them fora few
days."
Rolston's family was lucky. Though half the houses in
his neighborhood had trees that had fallen through their
roofs, Rolston's house suffered no serious damage.
There were downed power lines in the road, trees that
had uprooted and taken neighbors' lawns with them, and
very little water pressure. Because Rolston's home was
