# NEW DEVELOPMENTS
## Campus undergoes extensive renovations 
### JENNY ALLEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students should consider investing in a
hardhat based on the number of construction projects
happening on campus this year. In addition to a reno
vation project re-creatfng a new Old Union, the Uni
versity is adding graduate housing, a fitness center and
additional science and engineering facilities to its al
ready expansive campus.
"The University has undergone a lot of changes
since I first arrived as a freshman in 1994 and it contin

ues to evolve," said Graduate Student Council Co-
Chair Tom Lee, a fourth-year electrical engineering
graduate student. "In 11 years here, I don't think
there's ever been a time when something wasn't being
built or renovated."
Old Union Renovation
The historic building, constructed from 1909 to
1922, is being renovated into a more traditional student
union which will house a new multi-faith center as well
as the offices of the ASSU.
"The Old Union project is currently completing the
early phases of design and is estimated to complete

construction in late 2006," said Jack Cleary, director of
project management at Stanford.
Cleary explained that over the summer the Office of
Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid Office
moved to permanent locations in the newly-renovated
Bakewell'Building. Student Financial Services, Hous
ing Assignment Services, Residential Education and
the Registrar's Office will be moved to new modulars
next to the Toyon Eating Clubs at the intersection of
Argucllo Way and Scrra Street later this year. In addi-
tion, student activity programs will
be moved to temporary modulars
located in the parking lot next to the
Black Community Service Center.
Religious organizations housed in
the Old Union Clubhouse will also
move temporarily to Building 60,
the current home of the Archeology
and Scheduling Departments.
Once renovations are completed,
all groups will move back into the
building.The ASSU office will be re
located from Tresidder Memorial
Union to the first floor of Old
Union.
"Since most of our services are
for student groups, this move makes
sense as we will be much more easi
ly accessible to them," said ASSU
President Melanie Kannokada, a
senior, who said she hopes the reno
vated Old Union will become a hub
of student activity. "Ideally, the new
location will also encourage stu
dents to stop in and find ways to get
involved within the ASSU."
Munger Graduate Residences
After receiving a $43.5 million gift
last year from Charles Munger, the
Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hath
away and founder of the law firm
Munger,Tolles & Olson, and his wife,
Nancy, Stanford has been making
plans to use six acres of University

land behind the Law School to pro
vide housing to approximately S(X)
graduate and professional students.
The University will also add a subter
ranean parking structure under
Wilbur Field to provide necessary
parking spaces to support the build
ing.
"The Munger Graduate Resi
dences are progressing through the
design phase with construction
scheduled to start in mid-2006,"
Cleary said. "The construction start
date is contingent on the County of
Santa Clara planning approvals ex
pected in December 2005. Later this
year and into 2006, site preparations
will begin for utility work;relocation
of the Owen, Drell, Rogers, Mari
posa and Serra houses; and excava
tion of the underground parking
structure at Wilbur Field."
During the summer, the resident
fellow's house at Casa Zapata was
rebuilt in preparation for construc
tion of the new graduate housing
project. Six student rooms in Casa
Zapata were used for the cottage.
"All the people involved were
consulted about the reconstruction
process, working directly with Pro
ject Manager Mark Bonino and his
staff," said Education Prof. Deanne
Perez-Granados, Resident Fellow at
Zapata. "I am very pleased with the
result — a very nice living space for
current and future resident fellows."
Several members of the commu
nity. including faculty, staff and stu
dents living in the surrounding area

were concerned with the effect the
residences will have on the Stanford
campus, including an increase in
traffic and the overpowering size of
the proposed buildings.
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center
Directly across from the Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center is the
new two-story Arrillaga Family
Recreation Center developed by
donor John Arrillaga. The facility
will feature seven squash courts, a
4,000-square-foot multipurpose
room with wall-to-wall mats, a 24-
foot rock-climbing wall, three bas
ketball courts that can be trans
formed into volleyball and bad
minton courts, space for sports med
icine and tutoring services for stu
dents and a fitness center with a
weight room and workout machines.
The nearly 75,000-square-foot
recreation center is scheduled to
open on Oct. 3, according to Cleary
— right on schedule.
"Non-athletes have been want
ing more options to work out for
years now. so we are extremely glad
to see this need finally being ful
filled," Kannokada said. "Addition
ally, we imagine it will help the over
all wellness of students by providing
an outlet to de-stress. There is a lot
of potential for this space, and we
will want to ensure that students will
have a say in how it is used in the
years to come."
Returning students said they are
looking forward to the recreation
center opening in the near future.
