It was perhaps not as coveted as a guest spot on "The
0.C." or an acceptance to a top law school, but a ticket to
see the Dalai Lama speak last Friday was certainly a hot
commodity.
Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, spiritual leader
of the Tibetan people and winner of the 1989 Nobel
Peace Prize, spent a total of four hours discussing his
views on meditation, non-violent resistance and other
topics on Friday.
The 70-year-old leader delighted crowds with his mis
chievous wit. After lofty introductions from Rev. Scotty
McLennan,dean for Religious Life,and University Pres
ident John Hennessy, he carefully unlaced his shoes and
told the crowd "I first have to sit more comfortably," be
fore sitting cross-legged on his ornate chair and chuck
ling to himself.
The Dalai Lama's English is conversationally fluent,
but lacking in technical terms, and when he stumbled for
words he made use of his translator, Geshe Thupten
Jinpa, who sat at his side. At one point he gestured to
ward his long-term translator and marveled at the fact
that "My study of English started before this one's
birth," in 1958. Poking fun at Jinpa, he added, "His Eng
lish is better, but my voice is better."
The morning session, which took place in Maples
Pavilion, was attended by approximately 6,500 people.
The Dalai Lama, wearing his familiar red-and-yeliow
robes, took the stage bowing with his hands together in
front of his face in his famous gesture of peace. Among
other points, he commented on the power of education
to allow people to better recognize truths and the ability
of negative emotions to obscure that truth.
"Negative emotions are actually one of the greatest
obstacles of seeing reality clearly," he said.
He concluded his morning talk by leading a five
minute meditation session for the crowd.
"So now let us meditate," he said. "But if you take this
opportunity for sleep, you should not snore," he added,
eliciting laughter from the crowd.
His afternoon appearance in Memorial Church, be
fore a full-capacity audience of 1,500 people, consisted of
a dialogue between himself and McLennan on the topic
of non-violent resistance. He advocated a position that
was far from that of a strict pacifist, to the surprise of
many in the audience.
"Any action motivated by social concern, compassion
â€” that's essentially non-violent," he said in response to
a question from McLennan on the acceptability of vio
lence in self-defense.
