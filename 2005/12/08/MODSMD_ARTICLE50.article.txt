## Workers vote to give union right to strike SEIU Local 715 talks with University currently at impasse 
### JAMES HOHMANN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University service workers voted over
whelmingly last night to give their union the right to
strike.The vote passed with 96 percent support after
leaders of the negotiating team for Service Employ
ee International Union Local 715 (SEIU) told mem
bers that a vote to authorize a strike would be crucial
to gain leverage in talks with University officials.
While union leaders said that an imminent strike
is unlikely, the vote means that more than 1,300 Uni
versity employees could go on strike as early as
today. Last night's vote means that unionized Uni
versity workers can join the nearly 1,300 Stanford
Hospital workers who voted last TUesday to author
ize a strike in a work stoppage that could bring many
University operations to a standstill.
Workers gathered in three meetings through the
afternoon to be briefed by union representatives
and cast a small postcard-sized ballot. A "yes" vote
accepted University proposals — which union nego
tiators called inadequate — while a "no" vote reject
ed the University's offer and gave the negotiating
committee the right to call fora strike at its discre
tion.
SEIU Local 715 Chief Negotiator John Vellardita
said that both sides were "very far apart" on the de
tails of the renegotiation and that the University has
not taken the talks seriously.
"There are two major issues at stake — health in
surance and pensions," he said. "Our members are
damn serious about these issues, and they're pre
pared to draw a line in the sand over them."
The University strongly disputed SEIU's claims
that the contract is not fair to workers.
"Stanford's benefit package is very competitive
— Stanford spends over 30 cents on employee bene
fits for salary dollar," the University said in an un
signed statement released on Nov. 23. "The current
contract provides for competitive wages and also of
fers a generous and complete benefit package in
cluding health benefits, dental, life insurance and
pension benefits.
"In addition, employees receive generous educa
tional benefits, including staff training assistance,
staff tuition reimbursement and tuition grant bene
fits for children of eligible employees," the Universi
ty added in the statement. "Stanford also provides

health benefits for its retired employees."
Union and University representatives have con
tinued to meet even while the union has prepared
fora strike. Both sides met yesterday morning to
continue negotiations but made no progress. The
union's negotiators told workers and press last night
in a Bonair Siding meeting room that the University
has not been willing to compromise. The negotiators
are not scheduled to meet again until Dec. 8.
Union leaders said they hope that the vote to au
thorize the strike will force the University to "wake
up and smell the coffee."
"Our outlook is to go to the session [on Dec. 8)
and bargain in good faith," Vellardita said in an in
terview with The Daily, noting that a vote to author
ize a strike does not mean a strike is guaranteed." We
hope the University will as well."
The University contended in its press release last
week that a no-strike provision in the contract pro
hibits the union from stopping work until the current
contract ends on Aug. 31.2006.
Senior Assistant to the President Jeff Wachtel de
clined to comment on behalf of the University.
"We are discussing the situation and formulating
a plan," he said in a phone interview with Hie Daily.
"There's still a contract that does not expire until
August 2006."
Union representatives told The Daily that the no
strike provision does not apply because the Univer
sity officially reopened negotiations on five sections
of the existing contract three months ago.The agree
ment for the reopening of the contract did not con
tain a no-strike provision, Vellardita said.
Regardless of the outcome to the current negoti
ations over portions of the contract that have been
reopened, the entire contract will come up for rene-

gotiation next year. A win or perceived win by union
negotiators could embolden workers to demand
more benefits, salary increases and pension guaran
tees next year. A loss could weaken the union and
decrease its credibility in the eyes of its members.
The SEIU local chapter has already set aside $1
million fora fund to support workers if a strike be
comes necessary, Vellardita said.
Several union workers said in interviews after
closed meetings with union bosses that they would
not tolerate what they called benefit cuts.
"They're trying to put us back to where Leland
Stanford left his workers to suffer after finishing the
railroad," said Ted Gathright.a unionized technician
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, who de
scribed himself as a reluctant striker. "It is not right
for the University to unilaterally try to take away
our benefits.The only way to negotiate is to tell them
that we are going to stand up to them. The only way
to do that is to vote to authorize a strike."
"We have to show that we care about the issues
on the table," said groundskeeper Chris McGilvery,
likening the efforts of the union at Stanford to his
mother's struggle during the civil rights movement.
"We will do everything in our power to show the
University that these issues are important to us. We
won't rest until they are addressed."
A coalition of pro-Union student groups met at
10 p.m. last night in El Centro Chicano to discuss
worker solidarity activities. The Student Labor Ac
tion Coalition (SLAC), pledged to fully support
workers in whatever they decide to do.
"It is SLAC's position that workers' voices should
be heard," said SLAC spokesman Matt Seriff-Cul-

negotiations.
lick, a sophomore. "We'll do every
thing we can to make sure the Uni
versity knows that students care
about the workers and their quali
ty of life."
With both Stanford Hospital
and University employees free to
strike, Vellardita described what he
called an "emerging labor crisis at
Stanford."
Some experts warn that SEIU's
strategy at Stanford carries a high
risk for the union. Nelson Lichten
stein, a professor at UC-Santa Bar
bara who specializes in organized
labor issues, told the San Jose Busi
ness Journal in its current issue
that traditional moves like strikes
tend to be less effective today, forc
ing unions to find other, more cre
ative means to push their causes,
such as community outreach.
The debate to strike or try other
approaches for leverage with em
ployers exposes a deep rift within
organized labor as leaders struggle
to deal with shrinking union rolls
and dwindling contributions. The
SEIU, which represents many but
not all of Stanford's unionized
labor force, broke away from the
AFL-CIO in a summer meeting
this year.
Nonetheless, Vellardita said he
was confident that other unions
with members on campus — in
cluding construction workers —
would support a strike.
The 1,300 University workers
now eligible to strike include main
tenance employees, laboratory
support personnel, custodians,
food service employees, audiovisu
al operators, nonexempt computer
operations personnel, production
clerks and tape librarians.
