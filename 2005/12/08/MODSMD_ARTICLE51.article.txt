## Housing Overhaul Bravman unveils changes for undergrads 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to improve under
graduate students' residential expe
riences, the University unveiled yes
terday a proposal that would funda
mentally change the undergraduate
housing system in coming years.
The changes will provide 650 new
bed spaces for undergraduates, more
all-freshman housing, fewer occu
pants per room in several residences
and a Housing Draw that places
greater emphasis on seniority.
The proposal, entitled "Improv
ing Undergraduate Housing at
Stanford," was authored by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman, who presented
it twice yesterday afternoon, to the
University Board of Trustees and to
the ASSU executives.
The plan would be implemented
over the next two to six years, de
pending on construction timelines
and the University's ability to raise
enough funds.
However, Bravman said that
nothing in the proposal is final and
that decisions will not be made be
fore feedback is collected from stu
dents and other community mem
bers, a process that could take
months or even years.
"I expect it will be a vigorous and

honest debate that takes into ac
count the interests of the University
at large," he said in an interview with
The Daily. "I'm hoping to avoid
flame-wars on e-mail chat lists and
angry letters to The Daily."
Because the changes would relo
cate Ujamaa House, from Lagunita
to possibly Florence Moore Hall,
Bravman met with residents for an
hour and a half on Monday night to
go over the proposal.
He told The Daily that the pro
posed changes to housing would:
• Meet demands for more all
freshman housing: Bravman said
that last year, 300 to 400 incoming
students who listed a preference for
all-freshman housing were put else
where. He also said he believes that
most freshmen are better served by
all-freshman housing. Bravman's
proposal would turn the dorms in
Wilbur, Stern and Florence Moore
complexes, except for theme dorms,
into all-freshman housing.
• Create more desirable upper
class housing: The proposal would
convert Branner, Toyon, Roble and
Lagunita, "the four largest and most
elegant undergraduate residence
halls," as described in the proposal,
for upper-class use.
• Restore academic program
spaces to residences: "Students
tell us all the time they don't have
space to study in their dorms,"
Bravman said. The proposal
would create, through reorganiza
tion and construction, more study
and seminar spaces in residences

all over campus.
"Un-stuff" crowded dorm
rooms: Room occupancies would be
decreased at several residences on
campus. For example, Roble quads
would become doubles,and the Mir
rielees apartments would go back to
housing two people instead of three.
• Simplify the Housing Draw
along fairer lines: Bravman called
the current Housing Draw a
"labyrinthine" system that can re
sult in some students living in Bob or
Xanadu, popular Row houses, for
three years and other students living

in Wilbur all four years.The propos
al calls for "generally escalating
quality of housing over the course of
a student's time at Stanford.''
According to Bravman, the Uni
versity has been looking into ways
to bring "systemic change" to its res
idence program since 1997 when it
received sweeping recommenda
tions from the Task Force on Resi
dential Programs and Student
Housing.

reaching recommendations were set
aside because 650 more undergradu
ate bed spaces would be needed to
implement them.
Last winter, the University se
cured a donation from Charles
Munger fora large-scale graduate
housing project, which enabled
Bravman to gain a commitment
from the University to open up the
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
residences for undergraduate hous
ing — which wbuld provide an extra
360 bed spaces.

To bridge the remaining gap be
tween needed and available beds,
Bravman went to the University ad
ministration and obtained support
for the construction of new housing
structures.
One of the main hurdles facing
Bravman's proposal is obtaining the
necessary funding. At around
SlOO,OOO per bed space. Bravman pro
vided a rough estimate of $30 to $35
million for the new housing alone.The
University will also need several mil
lion more dollars to refit the Crothers
residences for undergraduates.
This funding must come either
from the University budget or. most
likely, from an outside donor.
Bravman emphasized that the
University would not pass on the

cost of new housing students. He said
the search for outside donors has al
ready started, but he noted the diffi
culty of finding people who are will
ing to make large contributions
specifically toward housing.
Before anything is finalized,
Bravman said that the University
would take time to bring both stu
dents and the ASSU to the table for
discussion.
"It's going to be a big, big multi
year effort," he said.
To this end. Director of Residen
tial Education Jane Camarillo said
her organization "will provide rec
ommendations on the different pop
ulations of student representatives
who should be engaged in the next
phase of planning."
