# BOARD OF TRUSTEES
## Trustees vote to divest from companies 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
The University Board ofThistees voted unan
imously Tuesday to divest from any directly-held
investments in petroleum companies PetroChi
na, Sinopec.Tatneft and ABB. Ltd., whose opera
tions support the Sudanese government. The
Khartoum regime has been condemned world
wide for genocidal acts in the region of Darfur.
The decision, announced Wednesday, was
made based on the recommendation of the
Board s Special Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility, or SCIR. The task of divestment will
now be passed to the Stanford Management
Company, which will also send letters to the Uni
versity's investment managers, urging them to

also divest from the four companies.
Burton McMurtry, chair of the Board of
Thistees, said he expects these letters to be sent
out within the next 10 days. He stressed the rarity
of the decision, adding that stringent standards
must be met before divestment is considered.The
situation in Darfur met these standards.
"This was an odd circumstance, but it shows
that we have a process that works," McMurtry
said. "Over time we'll likely get more requests for
divestiture than we can approve.but it will be done
on a case-by-case basis. We need to keep the bar
high."
According to the Stanford University State
ment on Investment Responsibility, the trustees
can take action if they judge that a company's
policies lead to "substantial social injury."

"Divestment is an act that should he made
rarely and carefully," University President John
Hennessy told the Stanford NewsService."ln this
case, it was clear that the genocide occurring in
Darfur, which appears to be at least partly en
abled by these four companies, is in direct oppo
sition to Stanford University principles."
Ilie issue came to the attention of the Board
when SCIR received a recommendation for di
vestment from the University's Advisory Panel
on Investment Responsibility, or APIR. a group
of faculty, staff and students that examines issues
related to Stanford's investment portfolio.
The recommendation was made after the
panel was approached by the campus group Stu-
dents Taking Action Now: Darfur, or
STAND, which presented research
on both the situation in Darfur and
the companies in question.The panel
voted in favor of divestment on May
24.
"I'm pleased with the students'
role in this," said APIR member
Debra Meyerson, associate profes
sor of education. "I am impressed
and I am proud of the students who
started this process that led to the
trustee vote. They acted carefully
and heroically."
APIR Chair George Parker, a
professor at the Graduate School of
Business," agreed with McMurtry
that the decision is exceptional.
"This is an exceedingly rare." he
said. "We would not anticipate an
other decision like this fora long
time. It is not done casually, easily or
quickly."
Junior Ben Elberger. who helped
lead the STAND effort, said that he
was thrilled with the outcome of the
Board's vote, adding that the student

group feared the decision would he
delayed until the fall.
"It took Stanford students years
to win divestment from companies
that supported apartheid in South
Africa: we are thrilled that this cam
paign took three months," he said.
"But, really, this was only doable
because Stanford acted in good
faith and made sure to move for
ward as quickly as possible."
Elberger and his STAND co
horts met with Hennessy within a
week of their first presentation to
APIR to discuss the details of their
campaign.
"Hennessy was very receptive to
helping us formulate the best way to
go about this,"he said. "He gave us
advice on the process — the good
and the bad ways to go about it."
Elberger admitted that when
STAND first began pushing for di
vestment — holding informational
meetings and peaceful protests —
members saw official divestment by
June as a long-shot.
STAND member Nikki Serapio,
a sophomore, said that while he ex
pected the decision to come later as
well, the group's message benefited
from the precedent set by the cam
paign to divest from companies op

crating in South Africa.
"We spent a lot of long nights
compiling and composing the re
port we presented to APIR, but we
received a lot of help from outside
human rights organizations, and a
lot of the information was already
there," Serapio said.
The group also gained momen
tum from Harvard's April decision
to divest about $4.4 million in shares
of PetroChina, and the Illinois Gen
eral Assembly's move to suspend
state investments in companies that
do business with Sudan.
"This development has just hit us,
but there is still a lot of work to be
done" Serapio said of the Board's
vote. "Last week STAND went to
Sacramento to lobby state senators
about a resolution [similar to that
approved in Illinois]."
Currently, the group is working to
encourage the University of Califor
nia schools to similarly divest, he
said.
"The UCs have $133 million in
companies doing business in Sudan,
and if that effort is successful, it will
be a much bigger success as far as fi
nancial impact on the Khartoum
regime." Serapio said. "It will also re
quire far more manpower."
