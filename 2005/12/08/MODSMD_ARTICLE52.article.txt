### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
The University Board ofThistees voted unan
imously Tuesday to divest from any directly-held
investments in petroleum companies PetroChi
na, Sinopec.Tatneft and ABB. Ltd., whose opera
tions support the Sudanese government. The
Khartoum regime has been condemned world
wide for genocidal acts in the region of Darfur.
The decision, announced Wednesday, was
made based on the recommendation of the
Board s Special Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility, or SCIR. The task of divestment will
now be passed to the Stanford Management
Company, which will also send letters to the Uni
versity's investment managers, urging them to

also divest from the four companies.
Burton McMurtry, chair of the Board of
Thistees, said he expects these letters to be sent
out within the next 10 days. He stressed the rarity
of the decision, adding that stringent standards
must be met before divestment is considered.The
situation in Darfur met these standards.
"This was an odd circumstance, but it shows
that we have a process that works," McMurtry
said. "Over time we'll likely get more requests for
divestiture than we can approve.but it will be done
on a case-by-case basis. We need to keep the bar
high."
According to the Stanford University State
ment on Investment Responsibility, the trustees
can take action if they judge that a company's
policies lead to "substantial social injury."

"Divestment is an act that should he made
rarely and carefully," University President John
Hennessy told the Stanford NewsService."ln this
case, it was clear that the genocide occurring in
Darfur, which appears to be at least partly en
abled by these four companies, is in direct oppo
sition to Stanford University principles."
Ilie issue came to the attention of the Board
when SCIR received a recommendation for di
vestment from the University's Advisory Panel
on Investment Responsibility, or APIR. a group
of faculty, staff and students that examines issues
related to Stanford's investment portfolio.
The recommendation was made after the
panel was approached by the campus group Stu-
