## Department of Labor reopens investigation 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In 1998, U.S. Department of Labor investigators began look
ing for evidence of discrimination at Stanford in response to
complaints by 32 female and minority staff members. Then, a
year-and-a-half later, they abruptly left — empty-handed. The
case remained open, and many of the complaints lingered.
Now, five years after the case dried up, the investigators are
back, lookipg for evidence that Stanford, a recipient of federal
aid money, violated federal anti-discrimination laws in their hir
ing and tenure processes.
No reason was ever given for the lengthy hiatus. Some of the
original complainants have said they believe that the Bush ad
ministration — which took office around the time that the in
vestigation petered out — used its political clout to take pres
sure off the University.
"We know the investigation at Stanford was put on hold."
said Colleen Crangle.a former researcher at the School of Med
icine and a member of the group complaint. "We're not sure
why. but we suspect that it had something to do with the admin
istration in Washington. But we knew it would come back. It
will not be dropped. It never has been summarily closed."
Although the federal government never completed the
case, the fallout from the original investigation resulted in the
departure of several prominent researchers and faculty mem
bers. In 1999 Karen Sawislak, a former assistant professor of
history and member of the group complaint, departed for UC-
Berkeley, claiming she could "not get a fair hearing at the Uni
versity." Other complainants, ostensibly fearing a similar fate,
withdrew their names after the Department of Labor agreed to
the University's request to release complainant names.
Crangle, the former researcher, won a $545.(XK) settlement
from the University after a jury determined she had been
wrongly dismissed for speaking out about gender discrimina
tion.Hie verdict was appealed by the University and settled out
of court in 2001.
"The minute you bring up a complaint, you will become the
enemy," said Crangle — who now runs a bioinformatics busi
ness — in an interview with The Daily last night. "You can
never step down from that — you've identified yourself as a
troublemaker. The whole idea that if you speak up you're being
courageous and can help improve things — that's not even in
the lexicon of responses."
"I think that's the academic game — that's what happens,"
said one member of the original complaint who is no longer at
Stanford and asked not to be identified." You'd have to be naive
to think that it doesn't."
This perception leads many of the complainants still at Stan
ford to avoid speaking out publicly about their allegations for
fear of retaliation. One faculty member, in an anonymous
phone call to The Daily, said that people that voice complaints
or consider making complaints are threatened with possible
pay cuts or job loss.
University officials denied such
claims.
"We encourage people to speak
out about any kind of thing that's
going on," said Debra Zumwalt, gen
eral counsel to the University. "We
want to encourage that and we will do
whatever is necessary to protect them.
We view that as a service to the Uni
versity."
She also denied anv wrongdoing

on the part of the University in con
nection with the Department of
Labor investigation.
"There was no evidence of any dis
crimination or any improper behav
ior " she said. "That was true then and
it's true today."
Discrimination cases apart from
the Department of Labor investiga
tion have continued to crop up since
then. In one prominent instance earli
er this year, the University's only fe
male African-American surgeon
claimed she had been paid less than
her white male counterparts, passed
over for promotions and required to
submit to random drug screenings.
The University denied all claims.
