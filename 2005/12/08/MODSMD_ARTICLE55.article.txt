who convened in the Sistine Chapel. Bells were rung,
white smoke billowed into the sky and 78-year-old

"From what I've heard, the new pope seems to be a
very warm, personable man, which stands in contrast to
his perceived hardness that comes across in his writings,"
said Father Carl Schlichte, acting director for the
Catholic Community at Stanford."! hope with the exam
ple of his predecessor John Paul 11, that this humanity
will be manifest to the Church and the world during
these next years."
Schlichte said he was surprised by the selection of the
name Benedict XVI, explaining that Benedict XV
served as pope during World War I and aimed to make
peace while maintaining Vatican neutrality.
"Perhaps in our current world that seems to be in a
state of conflict, Benedict XVI is hoping to bring his
skills as a diplomat and peacemaker to the forefront in
the same way the predecessor from whom he took his
name did," Schlichte said.
