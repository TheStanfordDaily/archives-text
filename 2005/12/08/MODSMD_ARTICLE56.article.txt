## Faculty Senate OKs GER changes 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Beginning next year. Stanford students will be required
to take one less course to graduate, according to an an
nouncement at yesterday afternoon's Faculty Senate meet
ing.
After fierce debates, the Senate approved a proposal by
the Committee on Undergraduate Standards and Policy to
significantly alter the General Education Requirements,
popularly known as GERs.The Senate mandated that the
changes to the core curriculum will go into effect at the be
ginning of the next academic year and will apply to current
students and incoming freshmen.
Current students, however, will still have the option of
using the old system to accumulate GERs. As usual, they
will be able to choose between any set of GER guidelines
that have been in effect since they matriculated.
Under the new policy. Area 2-newly entitled Discipli
nary Breadth-will be a combination of current Areas 2 and
3."Disciplinary Breadth" will be composed of the following
sub-categories: engineering and applied sciences, humani
ties, mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences. Stu
dents will have to take one course in each sub-category.
What is now known as Area 4 will be called Area 3: Ed
ucation for Citizenship. Current Area 4 sub-categories
World Cultures, American Cultures and Gender Studies
will be maintained, and sub-category Ethical Reasoning will
be added. A minimum of two courses in Area 4 will be re
quired, and the courses must be in two separate sub-cate
gories.
Notably, the title of sub-category World Cultures will
change to The Global Community as requested by the De
partment of Cultural and Social Anthropology. CAS A fac
ulty members believe that the previous name was constrain
ing and perpetuated a dichotomous understanding of "the
West" and"the Other."
Various Stanford professors are enthusiastic about the
addition of the Ethical Reasoning sub-category, claiming
that it fills a problematic gap in the current Area 4 require

ment.
"This new sub-area is intended to help make students
aware of how pervasive ethical reasoning and value judg
ments are throughout the curriculum," said Philosophy
Prof. Chris Bobonich. "We wanted to pitch the old require
ments in a broader context so that students could see why
they're required and also to add something to Area 4 that
was missing."
Ethical Reasoning was not added to the policy without
opposition. English Prof. Paula Moya was concerned, for in
stance, that the presence of the new sub-category could take
away from students' understanding of the interaction be
tween people of different race,ethnicity and gender because
of the often abstract and theoretical nature of ethics.
"Ethical Reasoning should not be there," Moya said. "It
allows students to go through their Stanford career and not
take courses that focus on human diversity."
Bobonich refuted this claim.
"It will not be possible to just take an Ethical Reasoning
Course and not take a course in the one of the other three
areas," he said. He also argued that ethics studies do success
fully address the role of diversity in interaction.
in addition to haggling over this Area 4 issue, some fac
ulty members disputed changing the GER system at all be
cause there will be a larger review of the academic system in
two years.
"Should we tinker with GERs now, two years before
there's a review when we can look at the total picture?"
asked History Prof. Albert Camarillo. "Maybe it makes
more sense to postpone it and incorporate it into the longer
review."
Lucky for students who want to take as few courses as
possible to graduate-ten instead of the eleven required
under the current system-the faculty members in support of
the changes came out of the debate victorious.
"I think this change is such a good change," said Provost
John Etchemendy, a professor of philosophy, whose excite
ment about the future GER policy might rival that of sloth
ful students."l can't wait to tell my new crop of freshman ad
visees that these are the new GERs and why"
