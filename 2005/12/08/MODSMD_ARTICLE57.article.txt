There's really no delicate way to say
this: the Fall Career Fair gave me terri
ble uiarrhea (just kidding — everyone
knows that girls don't have such bodily
functions). There I was, walking
through Braun archway on my way to
class, when all of a sudden I see White
Plaza swarming with eager students and
power-tripping recruiters like ants in
festing an animal carcass.
I should have known it was coming:
I receive updates from the Career De
velopment Center with the same fre
quency 1 receive emails with the subject
line,"GlT YOU'RE FREE PENIS EN
LARGER!!!"— about every seven
seconds. But nothing can prepare you
for that feeling of inadequacy as you
watch your classmates push the limits of
"business casual," desperately trying to
woo the lackeys of Prestigious Organi
zation X.
Nothing, that is, except maybe fre
quenting frat parties all weekend.
They have a lot of things in common,
career fairs and frat parties. Both events
involve lots of people in fairly close
quarters. Everyone there is dressed to
impress and prepared to sell themselves
(figuratively) over the course of a brief
interaction. But in my mind, the most
interesting similarity is the overwhelm
ing sense of groupthink. the pervasive
sentiment that "this is what we're sup
posed to be doing — if you're not part
of this, you're not part of us."
And what reason do you have to opt
out of the collective? The Career Fair is
a great way to find a high-paying job in
finance, which might as well be Buying.
Selling and Eating Orphaned Babies
for all most of us actually know about
the industry. And frat parties can be fun.
assuming you are drunk enough to for

get that the teeming masses are emit
ting an odor strong enough to knock
the wind out of a moose.
There's nothing inherently wrong
with either event. Which is why I was
surprised at the amount of guilt 1 felt
when I admitted to myself that I
don't particularly like either of them.
Acknowledging that you don't like
career fairs isn't really that big of a deal.
It's like announcing that you don't like
Helvetica font — unless you're talking
to someone who just LOVES Helveti
ca — I mean really gets off on Helveti
ca — people probably won't judge you
explicitly or otherwise.
But admitting that you're not a
huge fan of the frat scene is kind of
an issue, especially if you're a mem-

ber of the Greek community. 1 mean,
how else are you going to meet cute
boys? And what are you'going to do
on a Friday night when all of your
friends are at Sigma Epsilon Chi?
1 can't really answer either of
those questions, but 1 can say that the
way frat parties are structured does
not allow me to interact with the op
posite sex respectfully, and occasion
ally that weirds me out. Let's be hon
est — on that dance floor you're a
piece of meat, I'm a piece of meat,
we're all little meat pieces doing a
sweaty meat-jig. And that's cool if
that's what you want, and sometimes
that scene sounds pretty hot.
But sometimes that doesn't appeal
to me at all. A few years down the line,
I don't want my children to ask how
Mommy and Daddy met. and I have to
say "Well, Johnny . . . Mommy was
coked out of her mind when Daddy
danced up against her with his no-no
private parts. Mommy doesn't remem

her what happened after that, but nine
months later you came along!"
For me, one of the most pivotal as
pects of my college career has been re
alizing that there may be a difference
between what I think I should be
doing and what I actually want to do. I
don't want to go into investment
banking; I want to be a writer. I don't
want to feel like occasionally blowing
off a frat party fora more intimate
soiree will make me less cool. I want
acceptance. 1 want respect. 1 want men
who will softly kiss my neck and laugh
at my obscenely dumb jokes.
And I don't want to feel particularly had
about burning down the career fair either.
