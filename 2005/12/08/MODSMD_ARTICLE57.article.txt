There's really no delicate way to say
this: the Fall Career Fair gave me terri
ble uiarrhea (just kidding — everyone
knows that girls don't have such bodily
functions). There I was, walking
through Braun archway on my way to
class, when all of a sudden I see White
Plaza swarming with eager students and
power-tripping recruiters like ants in
festing an animal carcass.
I should have known it was coming:
I receive updates from the Career De
velopment Center with the same fre
quency 1 receive emails with the subject
line,"GlT YOU'RE FREE PENIS EN
LARGER!!!"— about every seven
seconds. But nothing can prepare you
for that feeling of inadequacy as you
watch your classmates push the limits of
"business casual," desperately trying to
woo the lackeys of Prestigious Organi
zation X.
Nothing, that is, except maybe fre
quenting frat parties all weekend.
They have a lot of things in common,
career fairs and frat parties. Both events
involve lots of people in fairly close
quarters. Everyone there is dressed to
impress and prepared to sell themselves
(figuratively) over the course of a brief
interaction. But in my mind, the most
interesting similarity is the overwhelm
ing sense of groupthink. the pervasive
sentiment that "this is what we're sup
posed to be doing — if you're not part
of this, you're not part of us."
And what reason do you have to opt
out of the collective? The Career Fair is
a great way to find a high-paying job in
finance, which might as well be Buying.
Selling and Eating Orphaned Babies
for all most of us actually know about
the industry. And frat parties can be fun.
