## Stanford grad prepares to launch Discovery space shuttle 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
For many kids and adults alike, working at NASA
would be a dream come true. For Kenneth Attocknie,
Class of 19%. working for one of the world's most in
novative space programs is a reality.
Attocknie, who majored in mechanical engineering,
is now preparing for the launch of the Discovery Space
Shuttle, the first manned space flight since the Colum

bia accident two years ago. Attocknie works as an offi
cer for the Thermal Operations and Resources division
of the Mission Control Center at the NASA Johnson
Space Center in Houston.Texas, and he and is respon
sible for protecting sensitive components of the Space
Station from thermal stress. When the Discovery Space
Shuttle launches on May 15 — taking its 31st voyage
into space — Attocknie will spend nine straight days
working at Houston monitoring the docking of the
shuttle to the International Space Station, specifically
monitoring heat-generating processes.
The Daily caught up with Attocknie recently in
order to gain insight into the preparation that goes

into getting ready fora space shuttle
launch.
The Daily: How did you start working
at NASA?
Kenneth Attocknie: It was luck, re
ally. Right after graduation, I started
working with the US Space Camp
Foundation in Moffet Field and met a
lot of people. I started talking to one
person, and [hej put me in touch with
their supervisor, who put me in touch
with someone else It's really funny
how it all happened. It's always some
thing I wanted to do. It's definitely a
dream job.
TD: I'm sure the words you'd least
like to hear are "Houston, we have a
problem." I imagine you must have
gone through extensive simulations to
plan for every possible system failure.

K A: We've gone through all types
of doomsday scenarios. They really
prepare us for that. It's a high-stress,
high-pressure environment; we all
have to work together to solve a
problem. When we are working real
time, it's actually kind of boring, as
opposed to the high-stress simula
tions. But I'd take the boring anytime
over an actual problem.
TD: What is one worst-case sce
nario? How would you deal with it?
KA:Thc Space Station is very in
tegrated - when we have a problem,
it affects everyone. For example,
there are a lot of micro-meteorites -
space debris - that hit the shuttle. In
one scenario, a piece hits the ammo
nia cooling lines,depicting my ability
to cool down the station. The fluid
leaking out also provides an addi
tional propulsion jet, so you have to
compensate for the propulsion force
that could take the shuttle out of
orbit. If the shuttle is out of orbit, the
solar rays won't hit the panels at the

right angle and we won't be able to
generate enough power.The key is to
prioritize and deal with things in the
right order. You have to look at the
big picture - that's very critical in
space station operations.
TD: Because you can't physically
go out and fix the problem, how are
you able to correct these types of
problems from the ground?
KA: There are definitely scenar
ios where you can't do anything right
there. If there's a problem with the
outside vehicle, the astronauts could
do a space walk, but that takes two to
three days of planning and prepar
ing. We have to practice and be
aware of situations we may not be
able to fix right away and mitigate
the situation. We're constantly learn
ing things everyday. It's all a big ex
periment.
TD: Why is this mission important?
KA:The main goal of this mission is
to get back to space. NASA's looking to
going out and looking at the tiles of the

space station and repairing possible
damage. This is a key milestone —
NASA really hasn't done this before.
TO: Do you feel like there is any ad
ditional pressure placed on the crew of
this mission as a result of the events that
occurred during the Columbia mission?
KA: From the meetings I've been
to, I don't sense additional pressure.
There's just diligence. We're here to
do the job. We're here to take a mon
umental flight. Every mission is im
portant — everyone puts their nose
to the grindstone. It's pretty amazing
to be in this environment.
TD: What advice would you im
part on Stanford students looking to
enter aeronautics?
KA:The best thing is: Utilize your
resources. Stanford's an amazing
place, surrounded by Silicon Valley
and with all of those Nobel laureates
and great faculty. Take advantage of
what is open to you.
