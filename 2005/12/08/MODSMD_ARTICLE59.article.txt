# drunk dial no more
## By CHRISTOPHER PEDREGAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER

You wake up Saturday morning
after a long night of partying. You're
sitting in bed. trying to piece together
what you remember from the previous
night, when a sudden fear grips you.
You grab your cell phone and check
the last numbers you called, praying
your parents' or ex-girlfriend's or cur
rent crush's number don't appear on
the list of outgoing calls.
If this has ever happened to you. you
are well aware of the dangers of calling
people while intoxicated. Due to a new
cell phone service, however, drunk dial
ing may soon be a thing of the past.
Drunk dialing has become a major
problem (or pastime) at American uni
versities where there is no shortage of
cell phones, alcohol or young people.
Virgin Mobile Australia is offering
a new service that allows cell phone
users to block certain numbers from
being called when drunk.
For the service to work, users need to
dial "333" plus the phone number they
want to protect. That number is then off
limits until 6 a.m. the next morning.
The hope is that users will protect
themselves from embarrassment and
block important phone numbers —
those of their boss, their parents or other
relatives — before they go out and party.
Virgin Mobile Australia decided to
offer the service after noticing an epi
demic rise in drunk-dialing across the
country. A recent survey done by the
company of more than 400 people
concluded that 95 percent of cell
phone users drunk dial, and that 30
percent of those calls were to former
significant others.
