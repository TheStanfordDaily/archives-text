# drunk dial no more
## By CHRISTOPHER PEDREGAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER

You wake up Saturday morning
after a long night of partying. You're
sitting in bed. trying to piece together
what you remember from the previous
night, when a sudden fear grips you.
You grab your cell phone and check
the last numbers you called, praying
your parents' or ex-girlfriend's or cur
rent crush's number don't appear on
the list of outgoing calls.
If this has ever happened to you. you
are well aware of the dangers of calling
people while intoxicated. Due to a new
cell phone service, however, drunk dial
ing may soon be a thing of the past.
Drunk dialing has become a major
problem (or pastime) at American uni
versities where there is no shortage of
cell phones, alcohol or young people.
Virgin Mobile Australia is offering
a new service that allows cell phone
users to block certain numbers from
being called when drunk.
For the service to work, users need to
dial "333" plus the phone number they
want to protect. That number is then off
limits until 6 a.m. the next morning.
The hope is that users will protect
themselves from embarrassment and
block important phone numbers —
those of their boss, their parents or other
relatives — before they go out and party.
Virgin Mobile Australia decided to
offer the service after noticing an epi
demic rise in drunk-dialing across the
country. A recent survey done by the
company of more than 400 people
concluded that 95 percent of cell
phone users drunk dial, and that 30
percent of those calls were to former
significant others.

Virgin Mobile USA is consider
ing offering the service, but does not
yet have a definitive timeline.
Sophomore Anish Hariharan
says he would consider using the
service if it came to Stanford.
"My mother really doesn't appreci
ate my drunken calls, so it might be ase
ful."
He does not think, however, that
the service would solve the drunk di
aling problem at Stanford.
"The reason people drunk-dial is
because they think it's fun, so a serv
ice like this won't stop it. I don't think
Stanford students would use it."
He may be right — at least six
students have drunk dialing listed
as one of their interests on their
profiles on TheFacebook.com. and
with free night time minutes, the
practice is becoming more and
more popular.

Freshman Matt Spitz thinks
drunk dialing is harmless most of the
time, but it has the potential to com
plicate relationships.
"It can be fun if you drunk dial the
right people. But if you call the wrong
people, it can be really, really tragic.
Since the person is not standing in
front of you. it's much easier to say
things you don't mean, and that can
cause problems."
Another problem with the serv
ice is that it is not fail-proof. In case
of emergency, a user can clear all
blocked numbers by dialing "333-
CLEAR."This is necessary for safe
ty reasons, but seems to void the
service since there is nothing to stop
people from doing that while under
the influence.
Using the service also has its costs
— Virgin Mobile Australia argues
that the 25-cent charge is a small
price to pay for your peace of mind.
The company has yet to say whether
the service has been successful.
